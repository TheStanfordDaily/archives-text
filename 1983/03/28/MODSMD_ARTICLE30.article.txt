# Stanford takes conference lead; sweeps USC, beats Devils twice
## 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Stanford assumed and then
solidified a front-running spot
in the 6-Pac during spring
break, sweeping rain
shortened series from South
ern California and Arizona
State.
Stanford, now 7-1 in confer
ence and 19-5-1 overall, won
both ends of a double-header
with then conference-leading
USC March 19 and then won
the first two games of a series
with defending conference
champion ASU Friday and

Saturday. Yesterday's series
finale against ASU was re
scheduled for 1 p.m. today at
Sunken Diamond because of
wet grounds.
"Obviously, I like our posi
tion and we're playing well,"
said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "But it's too early to tell
anything. There is a long way to
go and this league is very com
petitive."
The fireworks had already
started by the time ASU, now
4-7 in conference and 23-11
overall, and Stanford started
Friday's first game. Arizona

State coach )im Brock filed a
three-part protest with the
NCAA before the game saying
the field was damp and:
- the field was not approved
by a Stanford athletic official,
- no batting practice was al
lowed prior to the game; and
- the umpire should not have
allowed the game to begin.
Nearly halt an hour after the
scheduled start, lim Colton,
Stanford's director of produc
tion and advertising, inspected
the field and approved play.
Under warming sun and blue
skies, both teams exchanged a

series of dramatic comebacks
before Mike Aldrete ended the
game with a lead-off, solo
home run in the bottom of the
11th inning that gave the Car
dinal a 9-8 win.
Aldrete, who also ignited a
two-out rally in the eighth with
a two-run homer, lashed the
ball to the opposite-field
power alley off reliever David
Graybill. His first home run ch
ased starter Kendall Carter,
who had tamed the Cardinal
for just one run and four hits in
the first seven innings, giving
the Sun Devils a comfortable
6-1 lead.
Stanford followed Aldrete's
first home run with four more
eighth inning runs off ace re
liever jim "J.J." Jefferson.
After a single to left by Eric
Hardgrave, Jefferson was vic
timized by consecutive errors
by infielders Ramy Cucjen and
Bert Martinez that loaded the
bases. Mike Dotterer followed
with a one-run single to left be
fore Greg Lorenzetti built the
count to 3-2 and, with the run
ners moving on the pitch,
poked a single to right center
scoring three more runs and
giving the Cardinal a one-run
lead.
"It really looked to us like
Kendall (Carter) was tired,"
Brock said. "The inning before
he gave up a single and then a
line drive double play and then
some hits in the eighth, we
thought he was tired.
"J.J. came in and would have
had us out of the inning except
for a couple of mental mis
takes. Stanford just played an
outstanding game."
Arizona State quickly re
claimed the lead in their half of
the ninth. Greg Steen opened
with a led off single against
Gregg Lomnicky. With reliever
Jeff Ballard taking over on the
mound, Steve Moses laid
down a sacrifice bunt that was
so good he reached first. Od
dibe McDowell walked to load
the bases before freshman re
liever Kevin Kunkel came in for
the Cardinal.
Kunkel struck out Martinez,
but Don Wakamatsu tied the
game with a sacrifice fly to
center that scored Steen. Cuc
jen followed with a single that
scored a run but ended the in
ning.

Cucjen's drive up the middle
was stopped by a diving Pete
Stanicek. Stanicek recovered
to fire home to try to get
Moses. Catcher Rick
Lundblade blocked the plate
with the ball, but Moses jarred
the ball loose with a shoulder
block. Lundblade then fired to
Aldrete at first who had Cucjen
trapped between first and sec
ond. Before Aldrete was able to
tag Cucjen, McDowell broke
for the plate and Aldrete fired
to Lundblade who made the
tag to end the inning.
Stanford followed with the
third consecutive comeback to
tie the game after nine innings.
Stanicek singled and stole sec
ond base before Hardgrave hit
the game-tying single to center
off Graybill.
Stanford stranded two run
ners on base in both the ninth
and tenth innings before Al
drete's winning home run.
Kunkel picked up the win to
improve his record to 4-0 while
Graybill was tagged with the
loss.
"Control is real important,"
Kunkel said. "I just come in
and try and throw strikes
around the plate. A lot de
pends on the team you're play
ing with. I know the team be
hind me is great defensively so
I can let them hit the ball."
Stanford's defense and late
inning clutch hitting was again
the key in Saturday's topsy
turvy 6-5 win.
Hardgrave was again re

sponsible for the game's clutch
hit when he blasted a 3-2 Jeffer
son pitch over the right field
wall for the winning runs in the
bottom of the eighth.
Saturday's game was played
under a slight on-and-off driz
zle that turned into a steady
rain. When Hardgrave stepped
up against the hard-throwing
Jefferson, "rain was dripping
off my helmet,'' said
Hardgrave.
"I just wanted to hit it hard
with two strikes," Hardgrave
said. "With a 3-2 count, you
have to look fastball. He came
outside and I was just lucky to
hit it on the barrel. I didn't
think it was going to go out,
because the wind was blowing
in."
Arizona State had a chance
to blow Stanford out early, but
the Cardinal consistently
ended innings dramatically,
including a triple play in the
fourth.
The Sun Devils loaded the
bases on consecutive singles
by McDowell, Martinez and
Wakamatsu. McDowell scored
on a passed ball that slipped
past Lundblade and Arizona
State had runners on second
and third with no outs.
Cucjen then grounded to
Aldrete at first, who fired home
to Lundblade, catching Mar
tinez in a rundown. Martinez
was tagged near third and the
ball went back to Aldrete who
had Cucjen trapped. Aldrete
made the tag at second and

then fired to Lundblade cover
ing third who tagged
Wakamatsu trying to move up
from second.
"I think the thing that really
turned the game around and
gave us a chance to come back
was the triple play," Marquess
said. "They had us on the
ropes. That was a big play — it
gave us the momentum.
"Eric has been a clutch hitter
for us all year. Jefferson was
throwing the ball hard — har
der than yesterday, I think (sc
outs timed his fastball at 92
m.p.h. Saturday) — and you
have to hit it a ton to hit it out of
here when it rains."
Ballard picked up the win for
Stanford and Jefferson got the
loss. Aided by the inning
ending triple play on his first
batter, and an inning-ending
double play in the next inning,
Ballard gave up only two runs
in six innings of relief in the
rain.
"Jeff (Ballard) hasn't been
getting much work lately,"
Marquess said. "You hate to
save someone like him and
then never getting him in. I felt
if it was close, we were going to
go with him."
Stanford's game against
Oregon State scheduled for
last Wednesday was cancelled
due to rain. After today's game
against ASU, Stanford hosts
the University of Nevada-Reno
tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. and
Santa Clara Wednesday at 2:30
p.m.

outside and I was just lucky to
hit it on the barrel. I didn't
think it was going to go out,
because the wind was blowing
in."
Arizona State had a chance
to blow Stanford out early, but
the Cardinal consistently
ended innings dramatically,
including a triple play in the
fourth.
The Sun Devils loaded the
bases on consecutive singles
by McDowell, Martinez and
Wakamatsu. McDowell scored
on a passed ball that slipped
past Lundblade and Arizona
State had runners on second
and third with no outs.
Cucjen then grounded to
Aldrete at first, who fired home
to Lundblade, catching Mar
tinez in a rundown. Martinez
was tagged near third and the
ball went back to Aldrete who
had Cucjen trapped. Aldrete
made the tag at second and

then fired to Lundblade cover
ing third who tagged
Wakamatsu trying to move up
from second.
"I think the thing that really
turned the game around and
gave us a chance to come back
was the triple play," Marquess
said. "They had us on the
ropes. That was a big play — it
gave us the momentum.
"Eric has been a clutch hitter
for us all year. Jefferson was
throwing the ball hard — har
der than yesterday, I think (sc
outs timed his fastball at 92
m.p.h. Saturday) — and you
have to hit it a ton to hit it out of
here when it rains."
Ballard picked up the win for
Stanford and Jefferson got the
loss. Aided by the inning
ending triple play on his first
batter, and an inning-ending
double play in the next inning,
Ballard gave up only two runs
in six innings of relief in the
rain.
"Jeff (Ballard) hasn't been
getting much work lately,"
Marquess said. "You hate to
save someone like him and
then never getting him in. I felt
if it was close, we were going to
go with him."
Stanford's game against
Oregon State scheduled for
last Wednesday was cancelled
due to rain. After today's game
against ASU, Stanford hosts
the University of Nevada-Reno
tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. and

1-2-3 YOU'RE OUT: Stanford catcher Rick Lundblade falls backward after tagging ASU's
Don Wakamatsu at third base and completing a triple play the fourth inning of Saturday's 6-5
Stanford win.


MR. CLUTCH: Stanford designated hitter Eric Hardgrave follows through on a hit against
USC. Hardgrave hit a solo home run in the bottom of the eighth inning Saturday that gave
Stanford a 6-5 win. Hardgrave also drove in the tying run in the bottom of the ninth inning in
Friday's 9-8 win over ASU.
Stanford assumed and then
solidified a front-running spot
in the 6-Pac during spring
break, sweeping rain
shortened series from South
ern California and Arizona
State.
Stanford, now 7-1 in confer
ence and 19-5-1 overall, won
both ends of a double-header
with then conference-leading
USC March 19 and then won
the first two games of a series
with defending conference
champion ASU Friday and

Saturday. Yesterday's series
finale against ASU was re
scheduled for 1 p.m. today at
Sunken Diamond because of
wet grounds.
"Obviously, I like our posi
tion and we're playing well,"
said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "But it's too early to tell
anything. There is a long way to
go and this league is very com
petitive."
The fireworks had already
started by the time ASU, now
4-7 in conference and 23-11
overall, and Stanford started
Friday's first game. Arizona

State coach )im Brock filed a
three-part protest with the
NCAA before the game saying
the field was damp and:
- the field was not approved
by a Stanford athletic official,
- no batting practice was al
lowed prior to the game; and
- the umpire should not have
allowed the game to begin.
Nearly halt an hour after the
scheduled start, lim Colton,
Stanford's director of produc
tion and advertising, inspected
the field and approved play.
Under warming sun and blue
skies, both teams exchanged a

series of dramatic comebacks
before Mike Aldrete ended the
game with a lead-off, solo
home run in the bottom of the
11th inning that gave the Car
dinal a 9-8 win.
Aldrete, who also ignited a
two-out rally in the eighth with
a two-run homer, lashed the
ball to the opposite-field
power alley off reliever David
Graybill. His first home run ch
ased starter Kendall Carter,
who had tamed the Cardinal
for just one run and four hits in
the first seven innings, giving
the Sun Devils a comfortable
6-1 lead.
Stanford followed Aldrete's
first home run with four more
eighth inning runs off ace re
liever jim "J.J." Jefferson.
After a single to left by Eric
Hardgrave, Jefferson was vic
timized by consecutive errors
by infielders Ramy Cucjen and
Bert Martinez that loaded the
bases. Mike Dotterer followed
with a one-run single to left be
fore Greg Lorenzetti built the
count to 3-2 and, with the run
ners moving on the pitch,
poked a single to right center
scoring three more runs and
giving the Cardinal a one-run
lead.
"It really looked to us like
Kendall (Carter) was tired,"
Brock said. "The inning before
he gave up a single and then a
line drive double play and then
some hits in the eighth, we
thought he was tired.
"J.J. came in and would have
had us out of the inning except
for a couple of mental mis
takes. Stanford just played an
outstanding game."
Arizona State quickly re
claimed the lead in their half of
the ninth. Greg Steen opened
with a led off single against
Gregg Lomnicky. With reliever
Jeff Ballard taking over on the
mound, Steve Moses laid
down a sacrifice bunt that was
so good he reached first. Od
dibe McDowell walked to load
the bases before freshman re
liever Kevin Kunkel came in for
the Cardinal.
Kunkel struck out Martinez,
but Don Wakamatsu tied the
game with a sacrifice fly to
center that scored Steen. Cuc
jen followed with a single that
scored a run but ended the in
ning.

Cucjen's drive up the middle
was stopped by a diving Pete
Stanicek. Stanicek recovered
to fire home to try to get
Moses. Catcher Rick
Lundblade blocked the plate
with the ball, but Moses jarred
the ball loose with a shoulder
block. Lundblade then fired to
Aldrete at first who had Cucjen
trapped between first and sec
ond. Before Aldrete was able to
tag Cucjen, McDowell broke
for the plate and Aldrete fired
to Lundblade who made the
tag to end the inning.
Stanford followed with the
third consecutive comeback to
tie the game after nine innings.
Stanicek singled and stole sec
ond base before Hardgrave hit
the game-tying single to center
off Graybill.
Stanford stranded two run
ners on base in both the ninth
and tenth innings before Al
drete's winning home run.
Kunkel picked up the win to
improve his record to 4-0 while
Graybill was tagged with the
loss.
"Control is real important,"
Kunkel said. "I just come in
and try and throw strikes
around the plate. A lot de
pends on the team you're play
ing with. I know the team be
hind me is great defensively so
I can let them hit the ball."
Stanford's defense and late
inning clutch hitting was again
the key in Saturday's topsy
turvy 6-5 win.
Hardgrave was again re

sponsible for the game's clutch
hit when he blasted a 3-2 Jeffer
son pitch over the right field
wall for the winning runs in the
bottom of the eighth.
Saturday's game was played
under a slight on-and-off driz
zle that turned into a steady
rain. When Hardgrave stepped
up against the hard-throwing
Jefferson, "rain was dripping
off my helmet,'' said
Hardgrave.
"I just wanted to hit it hard
with two strikes," Hardgrave
said. "With a 3-2 count, you
have to look fastball. He came
outside and I was just lucky to
hit it on the barrel. I didn't
think it was going to go out,
because the wind was blowing
in."
Arizona State had a chance
to blow Stanford out early, but
the Cardinal consistently
ended innings dramatically,
including a triple play in the
fourth.
The Sun Devils loaded the
bases on consecutive singles

Wakamatsu. McDowell scored

"J.J. came in and would have
had us out of the inning except
for a couple of mental mis
takes. Stanford just played an
outstanding game."
Arizona State quickly re
claimed the lead in their half of
the ninth. Greg Steen opened
with a led off single against
Gregg Lomnicky. With reliever
Jeff Ballard taking over on the
mound, Steve Moses laid
down a sacrifice bunt that was
so good he reached first. Od
dibe McDowell walked to load
the bases before freshman re
liever Kevin Kunkel came in for
the Cardinal.
Kunkel struck out Martinez,
but Don Wakamatsu tied the
game with a sacrifice fly to
center that scored Steen. Cuc
jen followed with a single that
scored a run but ended the in
ning.

Cucjen's drive up the middle
was stopped by a diving Pete
Stanicek. Stanicek recovered
to fire home to try to get
Moses. Catcher Rick
Lundblade blocked the plate
with the ball, but Moses jarred
the ball loose with a shoulder
block. Lundblade then fired to
Aldrete at first who had Cucjen
trapped between first and sec
ond. Before Aldrete was able to
tag Cucjen, McDowell broke
for the plate and Aldrete fired
to Lundblade who made the
tag to end the inning.
Stanford followed with the
third consecutive comeback to
tie the game after nine innings.
Stanicek singled and stole sec
ond base before Hardgrave hit
the game-tying single to center
off Graybill.
Stanford stranded two run
ners on base in both the ninth
and tenth innings before Al
drete's winning home run.
Kunkel picked up the win to
improve his record to 4-0 while
Graybill was tagged with the
loss.
"Control is real important,"
Kunkel said. "I just come in
and try and throw strikes
around the plate. A lot de
pends on the team you're play
ing with. I know the team be
hind me is great defensively so
I can let them hit the ball."
Stanford's defense and late
inning clutch hitting was again
the key in Saturday's topsy
turvy 6-5 win.
Hardgrave was again re

sponsible for the game's clutch
hit when he blasted a 3-2 Jeffer
son pitch over the right field
wall for the winning runs in the
bottom of the eighth.
Saturday's game was played
under a slight on-and-off driz
zle that turned into a steady
rain. When Hardgrave stepped
up against the hard-throwing
Jefferson, "rain was dripping
off my helmet,'' said
Hardgrave.
"I just wanted to hit it hard
with two strikes," Hardgrave
said. "With a 3-2 count, you
have to look fastball. He came
outside and I was just lucky to
hit it on the barrel. I didn't
think it was going to go out,
because the wind was blowing
in."
Arizona State had a chance
to blow Stanford out early, but
the Cardinal consistently
ended innings dramatically,
including a triple play in the
fourth.
The Sun Devils loaded the
bases on consecutive singles
by McDowell, Martinez and
Wakamatsu. McDowell scored
on a passed ball that slipped
past Lundblade and Arizona
State had runners on second
and third with no outs.
Cucjen then grounded to
Aldrete at first, who fired home
to Lundblade, catching Mar
tinez in a rundown. Martinez
was tagged near third and the
ball went back to Aldrete who
had Cucjen trapped. Aldrete
made the tag at second and

then fired to Lundblade cover
ing third who tagged
Wakamatsu trying to move up
from second.
"I think the thing that really
turned the game around and
gave us a chance to come back
was the triple play," Marquess
said. "They had us on the
ropes. That was a big play — it
gave us the momentum.
"Eric has been a clutch hitter
for us all year. Jefferson was
throwing the ball hard — har
der than yesterday, I think (sc
outs timed his fastball at 92
m.p.h. Saturday) — and you
have to hit it a ton to hit it out of
here when it rains."
Ballard picked up the win for
Stanford and Jefferson got the
loss. Aided by the inning
ending triple play on his first
batter, and an inning-ending
double play in the next inning,
Ballard gave up only two runs
in six innings of relief in the
rain.
"Jeff (Ballard) hasn't been
getting much work lately,"
Marquess said. "You hate to
save someone like him and
then never getting him in. I felt
if it was close, we were going to
go with him."
Stanford's game against
Oregon State scheduled for
last Wednesday was cancelled
due to rain. After today's game
against ASU, Stanford hosts
the University of Nevada-Reno
tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. and
Santa Clara Wednesday at 2:30
p.m.


1-2-3 YOU'RE OUT: Stanford catcher Rick Lundblade falls backward after tagging ASU's
Don Wakamatsu at third base and completing a triple play the fourth inning of Saturday's 6-5
Stanford win.


MR. CLUTCH: Stanford designated hitter Eric Hardgrave follows through on a hit against
USC. Hardgrave hit a solo home run in the bottom of the eighth inning Saturday that gave
Stanford a 6-5 win. Hardgrave also drove in the tying run in the bottom of the ninth inning in
Friday's 9-8 win over ASU.
