# Hoopsters finish season with victory over OSU
## 
### STEVE ODELL Senior sports writer 
Finals came a little early for
[he Stanford basketball team,
and the results were that the
Cardinal achieved its best
marks in 10 years, finishing at
500 for the first time since the
1972-73 squad went 14-11
under Howie Dallman.
Stanford's efforts in its final
Pacific-10 Conference
weekend were typical of an
up-and-down season as the
Cardinal lost a sloppy, poorly
played game in a Dead Week
kind of performance to Ore
gon March 10 but then came on
to play its best basketball of the
year two nights later in a re
sounding defeat of Oregon
State.
The split allowed the Cardi
nal to finish 14-14 overall and
6-12 in the Pac-10, good for
seventh place, under first-year
head coach Tom Davis.
junior guard Keith )ones was
busy setting records of his
own, eclipsing the single
season scoring record by
dumping in 30 points in the
68-75 win over OSU, a game
Stanford dominated in every
way imaginable.
Stanford had more re
bounds, forced more turnov
ers and shot better from both
the free throw line and the field
in obliterating any Beaver
hopes of an NCAA tournament
berth. It also gives Stanford
some positive vibes to carry
through to the offseason.
"Stanford just outplayed
us," Oregon State head coach
Ralph Miller said. "We have no
excuses, and I'm not going to
give any. This is a 40-minute
game. You can't just sit around
and play bad basketball for 20
minutes and hope to catch up
against a fired up team like
Stanford.
"They beat us just about
every you can in a basketball
game."

/
The Cardinal was never re
ally threatened after assuming
the lead at 8-6 and achieved its
biggest advantage at 55-38 with
11:54 remaining when jones
hit a baseline jumper. Jones
was 10-of-16 from the field and
a perfect 10-of-10 from the line
in finishingthe season with 553
points to surpass Claude Ter
ry's 1971 record of 544.
OSU, which fell to 12-6 and
18-9 overall, was led by forward
A.C. Green, who scored 19
points and grabbed 10 re
bounds. The Beavers were
granted an National Invita
tional Tournament (NIT) post
season berth and won their
first two games before falling
to Fresno State to finish at 20-10
for the year.
Oregon winged its way to a
67-66 win over Stanford for
outgoing coach Jim Haney,
who resigned at the end of the
season. The winning margin
was provided by a Dave
Brantley foul shot with 10 sec
onds left, just one of the Duck
forward's career-high 24
points.
Oregon, which finished 9-18
overall and 5-13 in the Pac-10
following a loss to California
March 12, led the entire way
after an early 2-0 deficit and hit
five of its last six foul shots to
ice the victory.
"We didn't make all of our
foul shots," Haney said, "but
we make enough of them."
Stanford tied the game once
with 5:12 remaining on a Keith
Ramee jump shot from the
baseline, but Brantley followed
with an offensive rebound
bucket to give UO the lead for
good.
"The main thought is not to
be too critical of the players or
penetrating on the mistakes we
made," Davis said after the
Oregon loss. "We can't dwell
on it too much."

The Cardinal assured Ore
gon State that it hadn't just
48 hours later.
Stanford seniors Dave
Nussbaum, Darin Maurer,
Craig Foreman and John Platz
were honored before the game
against OSU.

Junior Keith Jones lays in two of his game-high 30 points in
Stanford's win over Oregon State while Andy Fisher (left) and

Keith Ramee (right) celebrate the victory.
Finals came a little early for
[he Stanford basketball team,
and the results were that the
Cardinal achieved its best
marks in 10 years, finishing at
500 for the first time since the
1972-73 squad went 14-11
under Howie Dallman.
Stanford's efforts in its final
Pacific-10 Conference
weekend were typical of an
up-and-down season as the
Cardinal lost a sloppy, poorly
played game in a Dead Week
kind of performance to Ore
gon March 10 but then came on
to play its best basketball of the
year two nights later in a re
sounding defeat of Oregon
State.
The split allowed the Cardi
nal to finish 14-14 overall and
6-12 in the Pac-10, good for
seventh place, under first-year
head coach Tom Davis.
junior guard Keith )ones was
busy setting records of his
own, eclipsing the single
season scoring record by
dumping in 30 points in the
68-75 win over OSU, a game
Stanford dominated in every
way imaginable.
Stanford had more re
bounds, forced more turnov
ers and shot better from both
the free throw line and the field
in obliterating any Beaver
hopes of an NCAA tournament
berth. It also gives Stanford
some positive vibes to carry
through to the offseason.
"Stanford just outplayed
us," Oregon State head coach
Ralph Miller said. "We have no
excuses, and I'm not going to
give any. This is a 40-minute
game. You can't just sit around
and play bad basketball for 20
minutes and hope to catch up
against a fired up team like
Stanford.
"They beat us just about
every you can in a basketball
game."

/
The Cardinal was never re
ally threatened after assuming
the lead at 8-6 and achieved its
biggest advantage at 55-38 with
11:54 remaining when jones
hit a baseline jumper. Jones
was 10-of-16 from the field and
a perfect 10-of-10 from the line
in finishingthe season with 553
points to surpass Claude Ter
ry's 1971 record of 544.
OSU, which fell to 12-6 and
18-9 overall, was led by forward
A.C. Green, who scored 19
points and grabbed 10 re
bounds. The Beavers were
granted an National Invita
tional Tournament (NIT) post
season berth and won their
first two games before falling
to Fresno State to finish at 20-10
for the year.
Oregon winged its way to a
67-66 win over Stanford for
outgoing coach Jim Haney,
who resigned at the end of the
season. The winning margin
was provided by a Dave
Brantley foul shot with 10 sec
onds left, just one of the Duck
forward's career-high 24
points.
Oregon, which finished 9-18
overall and 5-13 in the Pac-10
following a loss to California
March 12, led the entire way
after an early 2-0 deficit and hit
five of its last six foul shots to
ice the victory.
"We didn't make all of our
foul shots," Haney said, "but
we make enough of them."
Stanford tied the game once
with 5:12 remaining on a Keith
Ramee jump shot from the
baseline, but Brantley followed
with an offensive rebound
bucket to give UO the lead for
good.
"The main thought is not to
be too critical of the players or
penetrating on the mistakes we
made," Davis said after the
Oregon loss. "We can't dwell
on it too much."

The Cardinal assured Ore
gon State that it hadn't just
48 hours later.
Stanford seniors Dave
Nussbaum, Darin Maurer,
Craig Foreman and John Platz
were honored before the game
against OSU.
