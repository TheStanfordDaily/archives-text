## 
### Associated Press 
Underdog Georgia, led by
james Banks and Vern Fleming,
ruined North Carolina's bid for
a second straight national bas
ketball title yesterday in Syra
cuse, N.V., shocking the Tar
Heels 32-77 tor the NCAA East
Regional championship and a
trip to the Final Four.
In Kansas City, Mo., Larry
Micheaux and Akeem Olaju
won dominated Villanova in
side and top-ranked Houston
cruised to a 89-71 victory over
the cold-shooting Wildcats,
winning the NCAA Midwest
Regional championship and
earning a return trip to the
Final Four.
No. 18-ranked Georgia,
competing in the NCAA
playoffs for the first time, will
meet North Carolina State,
Saturday's upset winner over
Virginia and Ralph Sampson in
the West Region, in national

semifinals at Albuquerque,
N.M., next Saturday.
The small but quick Bulldogs
continued their victorious
march in post-season play by
dominating the Tar Fleels in
side and going on a 12-2 spree
early in the second half to pile
up a big enough lead to hold
off a desperate North Carolina
comeback.
Georgia, which got into the
NCAA playoffs only by winning
the Southeastern Conference
tournament, knocked off Vir
ginia Commonwealth and
third-ranked St. lohn's to ad
vance to the regional final.
Sunday, the Bulldogs did it de
spite the absence of their high
scorer, Terry Fair, for all but
two minutes of the second half
because of foul trouble.
Banks, a b-foot-6 junior, led
the way with 20 points, while
Fleming and Gerald Crosby
each scored 17.

A!l-American Michael Jordan
of North Carolina scored 16 of
his game-high 26 points in the
first half, when Georgia led
37-35.
With Syracuse and St. John's
already gone from the tourna
ment field, a crowd of 22,894 at
the Carrier Dome jumped on
the Bulldog bandwagon and
cheered them on as they
played a close first half.
The Cougars, 30-2 with 25
straight victories, will meet No.
2 Louisville, the Mideast
champion, in Saturday's semi
finals at Albuquerque, N.M.
Houston, with the 7-foot
Olajuwon and the 6-9
Micheaux, never allowed the
Wildcats to work inside, and
Villanova's normally sure
shooting touch from the
perimeter deserted the Big East
Conference tri-champions.


RUNNING AWAY: Stanford's Regina
Jacobs, followed by teammate Jessica Spies,
heads down the stretch in the 1500-meter

Artie Streiber/Daily
race. Jacobs tied Cecil Hopp's school record
time of 4.17.20.
