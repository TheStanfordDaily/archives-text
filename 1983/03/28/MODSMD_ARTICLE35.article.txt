# New faculty housing approved
## 
### JANE McCONNELL Staff writer 
A new faculty housing project ap
proved at a February meeting of the
board of trustees would help senior
faculty and staff members whose
homes have gotten too large for their
families.
"Many of the faculty are in homes
that are too big now that their chil
dren have moved away. They have no
desire to maintain large homes on
large lots but the existing con
dominiums on campus are too small
for them,'' said Robin Hamill, direc
tor of housing.

The project will be located on a
four-acre site known as Rural Lane,
southwest of the intersection of Al
pine Road and lunipero Serra. The
condominiums will overlook the
13th hole of the University golf
course.
About half the site now lies within
the confines of the City of Menlo
Park. The other half lies within an
unincorporated area in San Mateo
County, and annexation is being
sought for this half. Hamill said she
doesn't foresee any problems with
this.
The residential development will
consist of 15 units. Two floor plans

have been proposed: a one-story
unit of 1800 square feet with two bed
rooms, two baths and a study; and a
two-story unit of 2200 square feet
with three bedrooms, 2Vi baths and a
study.
Sale prices for the units are antici
pated to average about $300,000. The
units will range from $275,000 to
$325,000.
A report to the trustees noted that
"The opportunity for golf-course
views and low-maintenance homes
on campus lands should appeal to
families whose homes now exceed
their space requirements."
