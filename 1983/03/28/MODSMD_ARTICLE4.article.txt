# Student arrested for phony ticket sales

### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
A month-long police investigation
into the counterfeiting of Senior
Casino Night tickets culminated last
week with the arrest of Stanford
senior Aristotle "Aris" Economon.
Stanford police have charged
Economon with the forgery and sale
of 18 phony tickets to Senior Casino
Night, which was held at the Menlo
Circus Club on Feb. 4.
Law enforcement personnel ar
rested Economon Saturday, March
19, in his hometown of Sacramento,

where he was taking a Graduate
Management Aptitude Test (GMAT)
for student )orgen Kvick. Kvick, a 21
year-old student who is also from
Sacramento, has also been arrested
in connection with the forged-ticket
scam.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Neimeyer described Economon as "a
real bright guy. He signed in for the
test and took the first half. When he
came out during the break, we ar
rested him."
Police will not file criminal c harges
for the alleged test-taking switch,
Niemeyer added.
Fellow residents at 558 Mayfield

characterized Economon, a pre-med
student majoring in biology, as "out
spoken.''
He is free on bail pending an April
4 hearing date in Palo Alto Municipal
Court and was unavailable for com
ment.
Police said that Economon and
Kvick allegedly printed up the phony
tickets to the annual Casino Night,
sponsored by the Stanford Alumni
Association as a fundraiser for the
senior class. Flyers posted around
the Post Office, Tresidder Union and
the Old Union building instructed
students to call one of two telephone
numbers at specified times.
According to Stanford Police De
tective Katherine Miller, who con
ducted the investigation, the first
hint of wrongdoing appeared when a
potential buyer called at the wrong
time, and was told that he was calling
a pay phone located at Meyer Lib
rary. Miller said she was able to track
down the suspects because some
ticket-buyers knew Economon.
Later, police traced a number from
the flyers to the Meyer Library pay
telephone. According to senior De
nise Monza, who purchased a phony
ticket, one number also corres
ponded to the SURE escort service
telephone located outside of Meyer.
Apparently, the suspects also scan
ned the waiting list at Bowman
Alumni House for potential buyers of
the bonus tickets and called students
on the list to arrange delivery.
Students who had called the
number at the specified times were
able to set up a meeting with the for
gers to purchase the tickets. "They
often made arrangements to come
up to the person's house to deliver
the tickets," Miller said. The sus
pects also used Meyer Library for the
exchange.
