Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger said yesterday that Soviet development of a
futuristic anti-ballistic missile defense system parallel
to American efforts would be a step toward ending
the nuclear arms race.
"I know the Soviets are doing a fair amount of work
and have been for quite a while in this whole area,
and I would assume that at some point it might be
possible for both countries to develop the kind of sys
tem that could guarantee that there would be no
longer any danger from nuclear missiles, and that
would be an enormous step for mankind, Wein
berger said. .
Interviewed on "Meet the Press (NBC), Wein
berger said that he knows of no plans for joint U.S.-

Soviet development of the new systems, but "I
wouldn't mind at all" if the Soviets attempt to match
the U.S. effort.
While some critics have warned that the program
outlined by President Reagan last week could lead to
a new space-age weapons race, Weinberger said it
would produce "a new means of keeping the
strategic balance, which depends not on any kind of
fear or any kind of retaliation, but on a proven ability
to defend."
Questioned about whether the result might also be
a transfer of earthbound conflict into space, Wein
berger said, "Well, there's no question that as you try
to develop systems of this kind, others will try and de
velop countermeasures, others who are interested in
offensive capability. We're not. We're interested in
defensive capabilities.. .
Last week, administration officials suggested the
possibility of locating such high-technology defense
systems in space as well as on Earth. Although some
scientists have expressed doubts about the feasibility
of such technology, Weinberger recalled earlier
doubts about whether man could fly to the moon.
"So I don't have real doubts about the American
ability to do this," he said.
While administration officials last week estimated
the current cost of the U.S. effort toward a strategic
defense system at about $1 billion, Weinberger said
yesterday that only about $250 million of that amount
in the 1984 budget request is devoted to the futuristic
systems Reagan envisioned in his Wednesday night
speech.
The rest of the funds are for "more conventional"
strategic defense systems based on the ground, he
said, adding that "it might be possible to redirect
some of the conventional" funds into the high-tech
nology efforts.
Weinberger said that the systems Reagan described
last week would not be aimed only at intercontinental
ballistic missiles, but might target ground-hugging
cruise missiles as well. He said Reagan is seeking a sys
tem that is "thoroughly reliable and total."
Mideast talks might succeed soon
Jerusalem — A senior Israeli official said yesterday
that within thenext few weeks the Israel-Lebanon-
U.S. security talks either will produce an agreement
or will break down entirely, causing Israel to seek oth
er ways to safeguard its northern border.
The official, who talked to reporters on the condi
tion that he not be named following the regular week
ly Cabinet meeting, said that the end to the three
month-old talks "might not be too remote — many of
the problems have been cleared up.
"We'll either come to an agreement or see that it is
no use in going on," he said.
U.S. Special Envoy Philip Habib met with Defense
Minister Moshe Arens and Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir to discuss the remaining points in dispute. Is
rael television reported after the meeting that no
progress had been made.
The state-operated network said that Habib would
return today to Beirut to tell Lebanese officials that Is
rael was "uncompromising" in its demand that its
southern Lebanon ally, Maj. Saad Haddad, retain a
military command in the zone north of the Israeli
border.
Meanwhile, Ariel Sharon, the former defense min
ister who is now minister without portfolio, mounted
a sharp attack on Arens during the Cabinet meeting,
Israel radio reported.
The radio report said that Sharon claimed that
Arens' approach to the negotiations "would produce
a situation in which Israel would gain nothing" from
its invasion of Lebanon.
Crowd disrupts Mondale visit
Chicago — A hostile crowd of white demonstrators
forced Walter Mondale and Rep. Harold Washington,
the Democratic mayoral candidate, to abruptly cut
short a visit to a Palm Sunday church service here yes
terday.
The crowd of more than 150 shouted epithets at the
former vice president and at Washington, the first
black to win a Chicago mayoral nomination, as they
entered St. Pascal Catholic Church on the city's
northwest side.
The demonstrators swarmed ontothe church steps,
booing loudly and chanting, "Epton, Epton," for
Washington's Republican opponent Bernard Epton,
and "carpetbagger Mondale, carpetbagger Mon
dale."
After a few moments inside the church, Mondale
and Washington decided to leave rather than allow
the demonstrators to further disrupt services.

Police cleared a path down the church steps and
the two men calmly left in a motorcade as demon
strators shouted, "No more politics in the church,"

and"Washington, you're a tax evader," an apparent
reference to Washington's 1972 conviction for failing
to file income taxes for four years.
Washington aides later said it was the ugliest inci
dent that the two-term congressman has encoun
tered since he upset Mayor Jane Byrne and Cook
County State's Attorney Richard Daley in the Feb. 22
Democratic primary.
It also pointed out the dangers of racial politics for
both Republican and Democratic parties as the Chi
cago's mayor's race has become a "nationalized" af
fair, with both parties committing major resources.
Salvadoran military weakening
Washington — The Salvadoran government's mili
tary position has deteriorated so severely that leftist
guerrillas could launch major attacks into El
Salvador's capital by October unless dramatic action
is taken, according to the head of a U.S. conservative
group.
F. Andy Messing, executive director of the Conser
vative Caucus and a former member of the Green
Beret special combat force, said in a report on El
Salvador that the morale of the government soldiers
has eroded and corruption plagues the Salvadoran
military.
"El Salvador is corrupt from top to bottom," said
Messing, who has visited El Salvador five times since
last August. Hisorganization lobbies for legislation on
a wide range of issues.
Messing warned that the increasing desperation of
the military position will lead to soldiers executing
people that "they pick up in the field that they suspect
(are) terrorists .... As the deterioration occurs at a
quantum rate, the human rights violations by not only
the left, but the right, curve upward."
In an interview last week, Messing said President
Reagan's proposal for $110 million in increased mili
tary aid to El Salvador, coupled with a new emphasis
on using smaller fighting units, could turn the tide if
the aid is approved by Congress.
"If El Salvador goes down the tubes, it's Congress
that will be at fault," Messing said.
But in his report, Messing also cast a great deal of
blame on the Salvadoran army.
He said the Salvadoran military mustshift from con
ventional warfare to so-called "irregular" or fighting
with small units of men — an opinion shared by many
of Reagan's military advisers.
Gov't should ensure health care
Washington — The President's Commission on Ethi
cal Problems in Medicine told the president and Con
gress yesterday that society has an obligation to
ensure that everyone has access to an "adequate level
of health care" and that "the ultimate responsibility
. . . rests v\ ith the federal government."
The commission, in a 220-page report, said, "It is in
creasingly important that traditional American con
cerns with fairness in health care be kept in mind
when policymakers look for ways to control rising
health-care costs." The report's conclusionsare espe
cially significant now, the commission said, because
an estimated 30 million Americans lack health insur
ance coverage; hospitals are cutting back services,
even closing emergency rooms on weekends; health
care costs overall are escalating and the Reagan ad
ministration is reducing Medicaid coverage for the
poor.
The commission declared, however, that society's
responsibility should be balanced by that of the indi
vidual. "Individuals ought to pay a fair share of the
cost of their own health care and take reasonable
steps to provide for such care when they can do so
without excessive burdens," the report said. "Never
theless, the origins of health needs are too complex
and their manifestation too acute and severe to per
mit care to be regularly denied on the grounds that
individuals are responsible for their own health."
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today, with highs in the upper 50s to
mid-60s. A chance of showers tomorrow, with lows in
