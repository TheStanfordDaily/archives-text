# O'Connor pleads guilty to burglary charges
## 
### 
Robert O'Connor, the 40 year-old jogging
burglar accused of stealing as much as $2 million
worth of property from local residences, re
versed his position last Tuesday and pled guilty
to 21 counts of burglary and one count of being a
felon in possession of a handgun.
O'Connor will be sentenced in San lose
Superior Court on May 24 and could face up to 19
years in prison for these crimes. O'Connor was
involved in such a large number of crimes that
police are expecting anywhere from 20 to 30 vic
tims to speak at trial, ludge Robert Foley has
agreed to devote most of that day to O'Connor's
case. Ordinarily, as many as 30 sentences may be
issued in superior court in one day.
O'Connor admitted his guilt in order to obtain

a "fair resolution in the related cases of his
sister, wife, and friend, he said last Tuesday. All
three of these women, however, may still spend
some time behind bars.
As part of the plea bargain, O'Connor's wife,
Maureen Martinez O'Connor, and his friend,
Nancy Burt, both pletl guilty to single counts of
receiving stolen property. They face possible
state prison sentences.
O'Connor's sister, Maureen Delores O'Con
nor, also pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge
and could be incarcerated for a year in county
jail.
Since O'Connor was arrested and the stolen
property was discovered, more than 2000 people
have come on campus to view the goods that

have been stored in trailers next to the police
department. About 200 persons have positively
identified belongings.
Although O'Connor was suspected of numer
ous thefts, he was only charged with 21 counts.
According to District Attorney Tom Hanford,
"even if he were convicted on 100 counts, he
wouldn't get more time."
O'Connor may come face to face with many of
his victims this May. Because of Proposition 8,
the new victim's bill of rights, they will be given a
chance to describe in court how O'Connor's
crimes have affected their lives. Under the new
law, victims can also affect the sentencing deci
sion by writing letters to the judge before trial.
