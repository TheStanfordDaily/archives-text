# Law School enacts non-biased admissions rule for gay students
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Law School quietly
adopted a non-discrimination policy
on "sexual orientation" in its 1982-83
admissions bulletin. Although other
law schools have developed similar
policies, the Law School is the only
part of the University to have drafted
an explicit statement concerning
non-discrimination toward gay stu
dents.
The Cay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford (CLAS) is pushing for a

University-wide policy against dis
crimination based on sexual orienta
tion and has recently raised the issue
with University President Donald
Kennedy.
Kennedy is in the process of for
mulating a reply.
According to lamie Henderson,
president of the Stanford Gay Law
Students Association, the Law
School was able to adopt the policy
because it controls its own admis
sions process.
He said that while many law

schools have stated privately that
they do not discriminate in admis
sions on the basis of sexual orienta
tion, "explicit public statements"
can reassure applicants who might
not otherwise list involvement with
gay causes or organizations on their
law school applications.
"We have no reason to think that
the law school had been discriminat
ory," Henderson said. "But what
happens to a college student who
has been actively involved in a group
like the Gay and Lesbian Alliance at
Stanford? The printed policy will les
sen a gay student's chances of being
at a disadvantage in gaining admis
sion."
"Adopting these policies is not
going to result in large numbers of
gay people migrating to Stanford —
gays will come here, with or without
official policy — it is just giving them
a fair shot at admission," Henderson
said.
According to Prof, lack Friedent

hal, chair of the Law School Commit
tee on Admissions and Financial Aid,
the Cay Law Students Association
brought the issue to the committee's
attention.
Since a number of other schools
have recently adopted policies
against discrimination in admissions
based on sexual orientation, "the
committee thought that in an advanc
ing age we ought to so state in line
with the others," Friedenthal said.
"I didn't think it was necessary, but
we decided to make our policy abso
lutely clear," he said.
Columbia, Golden State, Harvard,
Hastings, the University of Pennsyl
vania, the University of Southern

California and Wayne State have simi
lar policies.
According to Henderson, the Gay
Law Students Association has been in
existence for fouryears. Although he
could not comment on the actual
number of members, the group is
"sizable," he said.
Although the Law School is the
only part of the University to have
drafted non-discrimination policy
concerning sexual orientation, GLAS
members feel strongly that the Uni
versity needs to draft its own non
discrimination policy.
"We cannot go on like this," said
GLAS member Stuart Reges. "If the
University is to make intelligent pol

icy decisions in this area, and if it is to
present a clear statement to the pub
lic of its decision-making process, it
must have a Stanford-written non
discrimination policy for students."
In 1980, Reges spearheaded an at
tempt to convince the University to
change its non-discrimination policy
to include sexual preference.
However, Kennedy has said he
feels that "merit" should be the
"prime determinant" in evaluating
any person and that "a person's sex
ual orientation" is a matter of private
concern and not related to merit.
The issue of discrimination has
been resurrected recently because a
private donor has expressed interest

in providing a scholarship for a gay
student here.
But according to Reges, the ques
tion of discrimination is irrelevant to
the scholarship issue.
"Just as the University currently
administers a scholarship program
where donors can specify a prefer
ence for students from particular
ethnic groups, the gay community is
arguing that donors should be able
to include a preference for a gay stu
dent," he said.
"This would not constitute dis
crimination on the basis of sexual
orientation, just as the other
categories do not discriminate on the
basis of race," he said.

concern and not related to merit.
The issue of discrimination has
been resurrected recently because a
private donor has expressed interest

in providing a scholarship for a gay
student here.
But according to Reges, the ques
tion of discrimination is irrelevant to
the scholarship issue.
"Just as the University currently
administers a scholarship program
where donors can specify a prefer
ence for students from particular
ethnic groups, the gay community is
arguing that donors should be able
to include a preference for a gay stu
dent," he said.
"This would not constitute dis
crimination on the basis of sexual
orientation, just as the other
categories do not discriminate on the
basis of race," he said.
