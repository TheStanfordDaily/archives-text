# H & S deans opting for longer tenure process
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
Assistant professors in the School
of Humanities and Sciences will now
face tenure decisions after seven
years of teaching, not six, Norman
Wessells, dean of Humanities and
Sciences, and Provost Albert Hastorf
announced at a March 3 Faculty Sen
ate meeting.
"This will mean that the tenure re
view process will start later — proba
bly in the sixth year — and the deci
sion will be made in the seventh
year," said Noel Kolak, assistant pro
vost.
"It provides a little bit more time
for assistant professors to get things
published and develop a good teach
ing record," she explained. Tenure
decisions are based upon quality and
quantity of published material, along
with teaching ability.
Wessells and the four associate
deans of Humanities and Sciences
decided upon the new procedures.
Although chairmen of the 28 de
partments within Humanities and
Sciences were consulted, the deci
sion took many professors by sur
prise.
"I never heard of it until it hap
pened," said German Prof. Gerald
Gillespie.
Individual schools have the option
of structuring their tenure policy
however they choose, as long as they
abide by certain University regula
tions. "As long as the deans stay
within the umbrella University-wide
tenure policy, then it's a matter be
tween the school and the provost,"
said Kolak.
The new Humanities and Sciences'
plan includes the same two-step pro
cess used in previous years. The Uni
versity hires assistant professors for a
three-year stint, and, if they pass an
evaluation, reappoints them for a
second term. Under the new policy,
the second phase lasts four years,
rather than three. The University al
lows a candidate denied tenure a
one-year grace period — now the
eighth — to remain at the school.
The administration claims that, de
spite the new interpretation adopted
by Humanities and Sciences, the te
nure policy has not changed. "The
overall policy states that you shall be
an assistant professor for seven
years. This still does that," said Jac
queline Bryan, assistant to the dean
of Humanities and Sciences.
Yet some professors perceive the
move as not only a departure from
previous policy, but as a serious mis
take.

"If people have an extra year, it
means that they have more time to
meet the same standards. People will
meet the lower standards, and there
fore you will slowly get people who
are inferior to their predecessors,"
said Gillespie.
Gillespie compared Stanford's
administration to a gigantic di
nosaur: not as nimble and quick as
other universities'. "Stanford does
everything out of phase with leading
universities. We wait until the polar
cap melts and hell freezes over be
fore restoring Western Culture," he
quipped.
Prof. James Sheehan, chairman of
the History Department, admitted, "I
don't think it's going to make much
difference. It might help some
people, it might hurt others. It might
help people finish their work, but it
may lead to an increase in expecta
tions, which could hurt people."
University officials claim they de
signed the modification to make the
tenure process more fair and effi
cient. "It should give them (assistant
professors) the maximum opportu
nity within the limitations of the um
brella tenure policy," said Kolak.
"It is a move to bring this school's
policy in line with others'," said
Kolak.
Indeed, Kolak noted that the Med
ical School, like Humanities and Sci
ences, operates on a three plus four
tenure plan. Similarly, both the Busi
ness and Law Schools use the full
seven years, with a four year initial
appointment followed by a three
year second term.
Despite Kolak's claim that "receiv
ingtenure is certainly not goingto be
any easier," Gillespie maintains that
the new policy is "just a cop-out."
"I don't understand the policy at
all. It's not clear to me. The only thing
that is clear is that there is an implicit
lowering of standards." Gillespie
likened the one-year addition to
lowering the rim in basketball — "it
allows people to perform at a lower
level."
While Sheehan and Bryan perceive
the extra year as something of a be
nefit to both the departments and
the assistant professors, Gillespie
claims that it will prolong procrasti
nation. "They'll have more time . . .
people who are slower have a ten
dency to remain slower the rest of
their lives.
"The question is why is it being
done now. You can hypothesize that
they're under pressure to get people
through (tenure) whom they
wouldn't get through otherwise."

all. It's not clear to me. The only thing
that is clear is that there is an implicit
lowering of standards." Gillespie
likened the one-year addition to
lowering the rim in basketball — "it
allows people to perform at a lower
level."
While Sheehan and Bryan perceive
the extra year as something of a be
nefit to both the departments and
the assistant professors, Gillespie
claims that it will prolong procrasti
nation. "They'll have more time . . .
people who are slower have a ten
dency to remain slower the rest of
their lives.
"The question is why is it being
done now. You can hypothesize that
they're under pressure to get people
through (tenure) whom they
wouldn't get through otherwise."
Assistant professors in the School
of Humanities and Sciences will now
face tenure decisions after seven
years of teaching, not six, Norman
Wessells, dean of Humanities and
Sciences, and Provost Albert Hastorf
announced at a March 3 Faculty Sen
ate meeting.
"This will mean that the tenure re
view process will start later — proba
bly in the sixth year — and the deci
sion will be made in the seventh
year," said Noel Kolak, assistant pro
vost.
"It provides a little bit more time
for assistant professors to get things
published and develop a good teach
ing record," she explained. Tenure
decisions are based upon quality and
quantity of published material, along
with teaching ability.
Wessells and the four associate
deans of Humanities and Sciences
decided upon the new procedures.
Although chairmen of the 28 de
partments within Humanities and
Sciences were consulted, the deci
sion took many professors by sur
prise.
"I never heard of it until it hap
pened," said German Prof. Gerald
Gillespie.
Individual schools have the option
of structuring their tenure policy
however they choose, as long as they
abide by certain University regula
tions. "As long as the deans stay
within the umbrella University-wide
tenure policy, then it's a matter be
tween the school and the provost,"
said Kolak.
The new Humanities and Sciences'
plan includes the same two-step pro
cess used in previous years. The Uni
versity hires assistant professors for a
three-year stint, and, if they pass an
evaluation, reappoints them for a
second term. Under the new policy,
the second phase lasts four years,
rather than three. The University al
lows a candidate denied tenure a
one-year grace period — now the
eighth — to remain at the school.
The administration claims that, de
spite the new interpretation adopted
by Humanities and Sciences, the te
nure policy has not changed. "The
overall policy states that you shall be
an assistant professor for seven
years. This still does that," said Jac
queline Bryan, assistant to the dean
of Humanities and Sciences.
Yet some professors perceive the
move as not only a departure from
previous policy, but as a serious mis
take.

"If people have an extra year, it
means that they have more time to
meet the same standards. People will
meet the lower standards, and there
fore you will slowly get people who
are inferior to their predecessors,"
said Gillespie.
Gillespie compared Stanford's
administration to a gigantic di
nosaur: not as nimble and quick as
other universities'. "Stanford does
everything out of phase with leading
universities. We wait until the polar
cap melts and hell freezes over be
fore restoring Western Culture," he
quipped.
Prof. James Sheehan, chairman of
the History Department, admitted, "I
don't think it's going to make much
difference. It might help some
people, it might hurt others. It might
help people finish their work, but it
may lead to an increase in expecta
tions, which could hurt people."
University officials claim they de
signed the modification to make the
tenure process more fair and effi
cient. "It should give them (assistant
professors) the maximum opportu
nity within the limitations of the um
brella tenure policy," said Kolak.
"It is a move to bring this school's
policy in line with others'," said
Kolak.
Indeed, Kolak noted that the Med
ical School, like Humanities and Sci
ences, operates on a three plus four
tenure plan. Similarly, both the Busi
ness and Law Schools use the full
seven years, with a four year initial
appointment followed by a three
year second term.
Despite Kolak's claim that "receiv
ingtenure is certainly not goingto be
any easier," Gillespie maintains that
the new policy is "just a cop-out."
"I don't understand the policy at
all. It's not clear to me. The only thing
that is clear is that there is an implicit
lowering of standards." Gillespie
likened the one-year addition to
lowering the rim in basketball — "it
allows people to perform at a lower
level."
While Sheehan and Bryan perceive
the extra year as something of a be
nefit to both the departments and
the assistant professors, Gillespie
claims that it will prolong procrasti
nation. "They'll have more time . . .
people who are slower have a ten
dency to remain slower the rest of
their lives.
"The question is why is it being
