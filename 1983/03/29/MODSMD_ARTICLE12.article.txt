## The 						Stanford Daily Reg day problems 
### 
Although everyone grumbles about registra
tion, no one seems to be able to come with any
concrete ideas for improving the system. Each
quarter all those who failed to register in ad
vance complain on registration day, yet each
quarter the system gets them through the pro
cess with relatively few problems.
The day seems to operate on a reward and
punishment theory. Early risers get through the
lines in 15 minutes while late risers are forced to
go to the 3:15 "all register" time and wait in line
for hours.
Yesterday, several women working at the de
ferment counter even offered students a
"reward"—basket of small candies—for waiting
patiently in line.
Monetary rewards and punishments are par
ticularly effective—s2o late fees plus 12 percent
interest to those who deter payment on registra
tion day, and $30 fees for those who register
late.
On the whole we find this system sound. Still,
it seems that some parts of the registration pro
cess could be improved.

Although we appreciate the spaciousness of
the Stanford campus, we can find no reason for
making it necessary to have the first step of
registration in Memorial Auditorium, 10 min
utes away from the site of the rest of registra
tion, Maples Pavilion. Pity the poor student who
thinks the first step is at Maples rather than at
Memorial Auditorium.
When one of these poor unfortunates finally
ends up at Memorial Auditorium he is often sent
elsewhere to collect his PTR or correct a clerical
error.
Finally, one would think that the University
would have made the payment procedure ex
tremely simple. Yet it, too, is confusing. Few
students wait in the correct line—or the fastest
one—first, because the signs, although large,
are often unclear. Thus, both seniors and
freshmen often become confused.
All in all, nobody likes registration, but since
it has to be done, we hope that the University
will continue working to iron out kinks in the
present system.
