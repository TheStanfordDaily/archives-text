## High tech not all it seems 
### 
The growing euphoria over high
tech industries has built to a cres
cendo in recent months. Steven
lobs' "US Festival," a kind of
Woodstock in reverse, sang the
praises of high tech to a new genera
tion of Pac Man junkies. Shortly
thereafter Time magazine hailed the
computer as "Machine of the Year."
Most recently, President Reagan, not
to be outdone by Gary Hart and the
"Atari Democrats," embraced high
tech as America's economic salvation
in his State of the Union address.
Following the lead of John Naibitt's
best selling book, Megatrends, high
tech enthusiasts have united around
a simple but alluring theme.
The American economy is in the
midst of an epochal structural trans
formation. The current economic
malaise is due neither to misdirected
government policies nor to any tradi
tional downturn in the business cy
cle. Instead, we are in a transition
stage between two eras of prosper
ity.
Smokestack industries such as
steel and autos which propelled the
economy during the past, are now in
terminal decline. Despite the pre
sent hardships accompanying this
turn of events, however, the future
holds the promise of a high tech re
naissance. Growth industries such as
telecommunications, genetic en
gineering, and, most importantly,
micro-electronics, will usher in a
new age of productivity and prosper
ity. This shift to an "informational so
ciety" parallels in significance the
shift from an agricultural to an indus
trial economy which occurred over a
century ago.
This comforting melody is familiar
to those of us who live at the gateway
to the Silicon Valley. Vet we are also
in a unique position to recognize the
dangers of this siren song.
The new, high tech industries, for
a variety of reasons, simply do not
have the job-creating capacities of
the older post-war industries such as
steel and automobiles. To fully grasp
this, we need to understand the basis
of the old industrial order and the
significance of its decline.
For more than 60 years, the auto
industry was the backbone of the
American economy. Alone, it pro
vided a vast number of relatively
well-paid jobs. More important,
however, were its spin off effects.
Huge supplier industries provided
materials such as steel, aluminum,
plastics, rubber, and glass which
were necessary to the production of
cars. The proliferation of auto travel
also stimulated the building of an ex
tensive road system and made possi
ble the growth of suburbia. This in
dustrial complex of steel, au
tomobiles, and construction pro
vided employment for millions and
constituted the hub of union
strength.
A variety of factors have contrib
uted to the decline of the auto indus
try, including market saturation,
foreign competition, and higher en
ergy prices. The important point,
however, is that the old industrial
order will never revive completely.
Domestic auto makers will continue
to produce fewer and smaller cars
with obvious effects on associated
industries. The impact of these
events on the American worker, of
course, has been disastrous. Millions
of well-paid )obs have been elimi
nated. Those who continue to work
have seen their real income drop and
the political and economic strength
of unions is at its lowest ebb since the
19205.
Much of this is widely recognized.
So too, are the political conse
quences for any politician or party
unlucky enough to be in power. Thus
politicos of all stripes have begun to
hold out the promise of a high tech
millenium as a means of escaping re
sponsibility for the current mess.

A little reflection, however, is
enough to reveal that the new high
tech industries can not fill the void
left by the decline of the older indus
t r i a i complex. The micro
electronics/computer industry can
not play the core economic role once
played by the automobile industry.
First, high tech industries are not
labor intensive. They require at best,
a moderate workforce. More impor
tantly, they do not stimulate the de
velopment of large-scale feeder in
dustries as did autos. No huge steel
plants are required to produce sili
con chips.
Second, while the auto industry
produced goods for direct consump
tion, many if not most computer and
micro-electronic applications are de
signed as business or industrial in
puts for the purpose of displacing
labor. The computerized office,
warehouse, and assembly line will
increase efficiency and cut costs by
eliminating labor. An example is the
recently announced GM/Toyota joint
venture in Fremont where robots will
be used along the assembly line. The
effect of this, of course, is to shrink
the work force.
Third, the American auto industry
enjoyed worldwide supremacy for
many years thus gaining time for un
interrupted expansion. The Ameri
can lead in micro-electronics, how
ever, is already being contested.
Partly in response to this competi
tion, American firms have shown a
strong interest in keeping down
labor costs. This has produced more
automation, resistance to unions,
and relocation of assembly plants to
Third World countries or in Sun Belt
states where wages are relatively low
and unions are weak. Atari, for in
stance, recently fired 1700 Santa
Clara County employees and an
nounced plans to move much of its
production to the Far East. Workers
are set against one another in com
petition tor jobs. In these recessio

nary times, even state and local gov
ernments have been forced to com
pete for new industry through offer
ing generous tax breaks or even sub
sidies. These are not the signs 01
coming economic health but of
desperation.
All of this is not to say that comput
ers are not handy things to have
around. But whatever their merits, it
is entirely misleading to portray
these so-called sunrise industries as
the means to economic salvation.
Despite the glib prophesies of ner
vous politicians, no high tech quick
fixes are in store for America's eco
nomy.
There are, in fact, no panaceas for
unemployment and the declining liv
ing standards of American workers.
There are, however, alternatives to
our present path which seldom gain
expression in the media or the halls
of power. In the short run, for in
stance, we could redirect our in
vestment in a wasteful and danger
ous military machine toward labor
intensive and socially useful indus
tries such as decentralized solar en
ergy, mass transit, recycling of waste
products, home weatherization and
rebuilding inner cities.
In the long run, democratic na
tional planning which emphasizes
jobs and social equity rather than
corporate priorities offers the best
chance for revitalization. Workers
should be given a greater voice in
investment decisions. Steel workers,
for instance, are rightfully reluctant
to offer wage concessions when the
savings are used to buy oil com
panies and drugstore chains rather
than for retooling antiquated and in
efficient steel plants. A long needed
restructuring of the national agenda
is in order. No technological quick
fix will save us of this necessity.
Euphoria passes quickly; hard
realities do not.
