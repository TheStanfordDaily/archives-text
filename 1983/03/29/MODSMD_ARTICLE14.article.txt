## Entertainment unfit for a queen 
### 
Weeks ago, when word was first
leaked that Queen Elizabeth and her
entourage were not only going to
visit and have lunch on campus, but
were going to be joined by a "diverse
representation" of students and fac
ulty as well, various plots were
hatched to gam admittance to the
privileged presence.
Inevitably, the guest list was cho
sen "randomly" and to no one's sur
prise was comprised of a noteworthy
group of Rhodes scholars, top
athletes and students in high-ranking
places. And then the "diversity" was
added to the list, in the guise of the
Leland Stanford junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB).
One can only wonder what pos
sessed the administration to choose
those bastions of questionable taste
to provide "entertainment" for our
guests. After all, it isn't as if this cam
pus has any number of fine, talented

musical groups to choose from, but
those were passed over for the dis
organized, seldom harmonized as
semblage of ragamuffin LSIUMB
members.
Obviously, the Band was a very
logical choice for the Queen. What
better way to entertain %-odd guests
than 80 band members and five
mini-skirted Dollies? Perhaps the de
cision to include the Band was based
on a feeling that a small vocal group
might fit in too well with the general
atmosphere of the luncheon, and
that the University's theme of diver
sity would not be served.
But surely it must have occurred to
someone, somewhere along the
line, that a band deemed unfit forthe
American public's eye just might not
be appropriate to entertain at a royal
luncheon, no matter how informal.
Undoubtedly, it is unfair to con
demn the entire band for an act that

was committed in the past, but cer
tain autumn quarter events at various
loCALities have not exactly bolstered
the image of the Band's responsibil
ity and musical prowess. The Band is
a highly enjoyable and integral part
of football games and rallies, but
their presence at the luncheon is
another matter.
Although too much may have been
made of the "Royal Visit," one can
only say the Band's presence at the
luncheon turned the event from an
exaggerated occasion to a farce.
With the choice of other outstanding
musical groups who indeed offered
their services, one must surmise that
the real reason for choosing the Band
was because so many of the other
groups were refused with a fiat,
"There will be no 'entertainment' for
the queen."
