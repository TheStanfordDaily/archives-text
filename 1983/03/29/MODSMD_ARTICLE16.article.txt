## 1984 is just around the bend 
### 
The Reagan administration's an
tagonism toward dissent is escalating
before our eyes into a full-fledged
assault. If that sounds overstated, I'd
welcome a more benign explanation
of three decisions just announced in
rapid, almost hurried, succession.
The justice Department designates
three Canadian films on acid rain and
nuclear arms "propaganda" and re
quires distributors to report the
name of anyone renting or buying
those films. Which is to say the gov
ernment requisitions a handy list of
those circulating and hearing opin
ions it doesn't like.
The State Department denies an
entry visa to the widow of Salvador
Allende, Chile's late socialist presi
dent. Mrs. Allende, who was to have
addressed American audiences on
international human rights viola
tions, meets every statutory re
quirement for a visa, but her visit
would be "prejudicial to U.S. in
terests." Which is to say the govern
ment prohibits visitors whose opin
ions it doesn't like, as well as our
exposure to them.
The FBI expands its domestic sur
veillance powers. It no longer needs
"probable cause" of an anti
government plot; now it can infil
trate, monitor, and investigate any
group that advocates activities that
the Bureau deems subversive. Which
is to say the government can legally

harass and intimidate, to a limit set by
the government itself, those with
opinions it doesn't like.
If this campaign continues
throughout the year—as I assume it
will unless we awake from our na
tional nap—can 1984 be fundamen
tally different from George Orwell's
preview?

Mosher case
Graduate student Steven Mosher
has been expelled from the Univer
sity for alleged misconduct in his re
searches in China. So far as has been
made known, his fault was publiciz
ing the use of very late abortion for
birth control. While he showed bad
judgment in publishing an article on
the subject in Taiwan, the penalty
seems so severe as to suggest that its
motivation may have at least partly,
been political.
It is fair to ask whether a graduate
student who returned from an inves
tigation in Guatemala to denounce
repressions against the Indians
would be punished or lauded for
idealism.

Humor as weapon
Les Firestein's satiric essay on the
Zapata mural ("Message of mural ex
plained," Daily, Feb. 24) seems more
like an indictment of him as a Stan
ford English major than a piece of
meaningful commentary. But this ;
won't surprise him since as a person
of letters he knows that irony can cut
two ways.
The sheer amount of hostile re
sponse — verbal and physical — that
the mural has provoked alerts us of
its significance. The painting is
clearly a response to the problem of
racism that pervades our society, and
whether one likes the mural's tenor
or not it is equally clear what attack
ing the mural means. Racial violence
is not a joke, nor are attacks on art.
Instead of poking sophomoric tun
at Hispanic students' affirmation of
identity, Firestein might consider his
own position. The humanities are the
other butt of his satire and that
strikes me as curious. Why should
someone choose an issue of racial
overtones to lambaste university life
and its privileges? The answer, I
think, lies somewhere between low
self-awareness (lack of self-irony)
and simple elitism.
