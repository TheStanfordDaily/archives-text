## Classic European one acts showcase in San Francisco 
### 
The Grand Tour is the title of
a slate of one-acts that opened
at the one-act Theatre Co. in
San Francisco on Friday, which
have no more to tie them to
gether than the fact that they
are European 'classics.'
Moliere's "The Forced Mar
riage," Shaw's "The Village
Wooing," and Chekhov's
"Swan Song" are all fine
pieces, and even though their
treatment is uneven and they
don't hold together particu
larly well, the Shaw alone is
well worth the price of admis
sion.
William Oliver, who directed
the Moliere never quite gets a
handle on managing the farce.

The play is very funny in spots,
but does not have the correct
timing to achieve the kind of
hilarity that should he possible
with this play. The play con
cerns a 52-year-old man about
to enter holy matrimony with a
rather unholy terror, who in
tends to wed in order to avoid
her father's confining gaze and
to live like a woman of the
world. Al Perez is funny as
Sgnarelle, the cuckold-to-be,
but throughout the play there
seemed to be moments that
were not played up to the hilt,
and there wre always more
laughs that just didn't happen.
Several of the supporting
characters were very good.

Angela Mason as Dorimene,
the buxom bride-to-be is quite
funny, and her hairdo is clas
sic. Frank Simons does a hys
terical bit as an effeminate,
skeptical philosopher who
does not believe that anything
is necessarily true, and an
swers all of Sgnarelle's ques
tions about his marriage with
statements like, "that could
very well be." Ed Markmann
does a less fortunate turn as
the Aristotelian philosopher
who is so concerned with his
own rhetoric that he cannot lis
ten. He is not aided by an un
happy directorial decision to
send him off stage in a volley of
thrown rolls which ceases to be
funny almost at once. Gerald
Winer as an old friend of Sig
narelle and lohn Furse as his
future brother-in-law also are
very funny. Bruce Brisson's act
is clever, and well-handled by
the director although it is curi
ous that they went to such ex
tent to create c hanges of scen
ery in a play which is supposed
to be observing the unities of
place and time. Overall, "The
Forced Marriage" shows that it
is possible to do this sort of
farce today, but fails to carry it
off in as funny a manner as is
possible.
"Village Wooing" is the
highlight of the evening.
Simon Levy's direction has cap
tured the wit and charm of this
story of a village girl who cap
tures the heart of a wandering
intellectual writer, and gets
him to marry herand live in her
village.
Maureen Coyne is excellent
as the witty, though unedu
cated telephone operator and
shop assistant. We first see her
aboard a luxury liner on a tour
she has won in a newspaper
contest. She sets eyes on the
writer, played by Rob Lerkan,
and decides he is someone she
could marry. She sets out to
converse with him, and despite
his attempts to stay tied up in
his work, she succeeds. She
manages at all times to carry off
the delicate balance between
being unlearned and having a
natural intelligence. She never
seems too clever for her back
ground or too ill-bred to be in
teresting. The later scenes in
her shop in the village show
her carefully in control of both
of their lives, and she glows as
she slowly carries out her in

tentions.
Lerman at first does not
seem like he will be up to her
level on stage. He stumbles
over the poetic and witty lan
guage a couple of times in the
first scene. He grows into the
part, though, and by the end of
the play is matching her line for
line in the best Shavian fash
ion. His biggest speech at the
end of the play, on the mean
ing of love, is brilliantly deliv
ered; it is a pleasure to hear
fine writing so well played on
stage. Brisson's set here is very
clever, and the set change into
the elaborate shop is wonder
ful. In short, "Village Wooing"
is a not-to-be missed produc
tion.
"Swan Song" is an interest
ing choice for the evening's
finale; it is the most serious of
the three works, about an actor
at the end of his career, and is
also, unfortunately, the least
well done of the evening. Di
rector Ric Prindle began with a
stagy "shutting down" of the
theater by the real stagehands;
the juxtaposition of the mod
ern crew with the turn of the
century cast did not work. It
would have been more effec
tive just to start on a dark stage.
Fd Markmann plays the old
burlesque actor who has fallen
asleep in his dressing room
after a performance. He comes
into the empty theater and
ponders his life. The prompter,
rather decrepit himself (played
engagingly by Q Lewis) acts as
an audience to him as he acts
out roles and stories from his
past. Markmann has a lot of
problems with the part. It is
unclear whether he ever had
any talent; it is only painfully
clear that he has none now. A
taint glimpse of some genius
inside, which might give us
some feeling for him and his
wasted life is never forthcom
ing, and he himself is not in
teresting enough to make us
care for what he is.
The Grand Tour will play at
the One Act Theater in San
Francisco through May 7. "Vil
lage Wooing" is probably the
best piece of theater I've seen
this year, and is worth going
out of your way for. The other
two pieces are not at the same
level, but when you take a
grand tour, you can't expect
the stops to all be equally
good.
