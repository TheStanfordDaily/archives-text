# 'Night of the Shooting Stars': war filmed through a child's eyes
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Vittorio and Paolo Taviani make movies on a grand
scale, with such a broad, passionate impasto that they
have the primal strength of folk legend. In terms of style
and temperament, one might class them as lyrical
primitivists, like D.W. Griffith, his great Russian con
temporary Alexander Dovzhenko and the German Ex
pressionist F.W. Murnau. That is to say that they are in
the company of masters. Their 1977 Padre Padrone,
about the efforts of an Italian shepherd's son to burst out
of his father's tyrannical grasp, embraced a colossal
theme: the struggle for self-expression through lan
guage. For the rural hero, language provided the key to
civilization — an escape from the brutal, elemental
world of his father's rule. In response to the nature of
the material, the Taviani brothers evolved the most
imaginative soundtrack of any movie in years — a wild
orchestration of animal sounds, interior monologue,
and rich, unrestrained music. Their new film, The Night
of the Shooting Stars, tells the story of the flight of some
of the townspeople of San Martino (in Tuscany) from the
Fascists in the final days before the Italian liberation in
August of 1944. The narrator, Cecilia, was six years old
when it happened, and is recalling her impressions. "I
don't know whether I was more afraid or fascinated,"
she says. "Everything in those days was so unusual."
And so the movie is scaled to a child's view of a world in
crisis: majestic, with sudden, quirky shifts of tone and
startling reversals that are often funny and horrifying at
the same time.
You can't pin down the style of this picture, because it
changes constantly — from burlesque to tragedy, to
lament, to erotic fantasy, to heroic romance — and it's all
so fresh that the Tavianis seem to be finding their tech
niques as they go along. The narrative begins with the
wedding of a young man, Corrado, and proud, pregnant
Bellindia: he pops out of the earth through a hillside
cellar trap door and pulls on the dress clothes his family
has brought him with urgency befitting a Buster Keaton
routine. We learn that he takes his life in his hands by
appearing in the open air, where German snipers can
pick him off; the rest of the town is huddled in the cellar
of a wealthy neighbor, who plays a prank on them — he
cranks up "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" on his
Victrola and they all prepare for the Americans — their
liberators — to arrive. One of the men, Galvano Galvani
(beautifully played by Omero Antonutti, the father of
Padre Padrone) urges the others to leave San Martino
and to try to find the Americans themselves; he is di
rectly disobeying Fascist orders to stay indoors — in the
local cathedral, where they'll be safe — because he
knows the Fascists can't be trusted. So, cloaking them
selves in dark coats and jackets and walking by night, the
bravest of the townspeople abandon their homes. They
wolf down a scant meal of bread and vegetables while
the others watch, envious of their neighbors' courage
and embarrassed by their own trepidation. One of the
pilgrims is Cecilia's mother, who carries the wide-eyed
child on her shoulders. What we see is what that child
sees: a journey as intense and bizarre as a Grimm fairy
tale.
Nothing in the movie occurs as we expect it to. Gal
vano, whom the others look to as their leader, decrees
that they must leave their dogs behind; instead of show
ing us the exodus of the travellers, the Tavianis give us a

wonderful image of a cellar full of yelping dogs running
free. When the travellers are gathered together in an
ticipation of the explosion that they know will destroy
San Martino, we hear their thoughts; when the bomb
goes off, there are close-ups of their ears, the keys
around their necks — it's a brutally direct manner of
articulating the immediacy of the tragedy to the people
on the screen, yet no other director would have thought
of presenting it in quite this way. Suddenly one of the
prodigals says he thinks they might have been turned
around — the explosion might have come from some
other town — and for a moment tragedy becomes comic
confusion.
San Martino — the whole countryside, in fact — is
divided between the Fascists and those who pray for the
Americans to release them from the Fascist vise. The
Americans in this movie are painted in delicately heroic
colors. In one scene, Cecilia and another little girl come
across a pair of G.l.s; Cecilia's friend gobbles down a
chocolate bar from one soldier's pack, and the other,
having no candy to offer Cecilia, digs a condom out of
his buddy's supply, blows it up like a fantastic white
balloon, and hands it to her. This entire sequence is
silent, though the faces are so expressive (Micol
Guidelli, who plays Cecilia, is a clever little scene stealer)
that the scene achieves a lunatic vaudeville status. These
are the only Americans we see, except in the fantasy of a
teenager, Mara, who has broken off from the others in

i search of the Sicilian-American outfit from Brooklyn of
I which she has heard. A bullet cuts her down, and in her
1 last moments she imagines an encounter with these
legendary redeemers, who hand her a glass paperweight
of the Statue of Liberty. Since the picture is drenched in
memory and concerned with the magical distortions of
private perceptions, the Tavianis never show us the "lib
eration" (we hear about it from other Tuscans who
have sheltered the San Martino people). We don't have
to; the fantasy Brooklynites and the mute C.l.s trans
formed by a child's imagination fit snugly inside the
Taviani brothers; marvelous, interior scheme.
Poetic and eruptive, The Night of the Shooting Stars is
the most extraordinary movie anyone has made about
war in more than 20 years — since Ichikawa's Fires on the
Plain, in 1961. And when you try to think of other war
films with a comparably special and complete vision,
only a handful come to mind — besides Fires on the
Plain, there are Birth of a Nation, Grand Illusion and
Rene Clement's Forbidden Games. The Fascists plant a
bomb inside the cathedral where all those who stayed
behind have gathered for safety; this sequence, which
contains little on-screen violence (the Tavianis shoot it
from outside the building),has Cuern/ca-like power. And
there is a stylized — grotesque — battle in the fields
between the travellers and the local Fascists that is
staged like a series of blackout sketches scanning the
emotional spectrum. At one point, one of the young
men kills an enemy held in an embrace — a blazing
metaphor for the divisiveness of war. Little Cecilia
watches it all, though her mind displaces some of the
horror with a medieval combat in which a blackshirt falls
back on his haunches, bearing a dozen spears in his
chest like San Sebastian. Mesmerized by these night
mares, she repeats the rhyme her mother taught her to
ward off fear — they rhyme that, at the end of the film,
the grown-up Cecilia will whisper to her child. In the
world of The Night of the Shooting Stars, where danger
is always imminent, magic is created out of fear, and out
of courage, too.
Winter Kills
For those who collect nutty movies, Winter Kills (made
in 1979 but not released generally until now) is indis
pensable. Writer-director William Richert, working out
of Richard Condon (the author of The Manchurian Can
didate and Mile High), has expanded on the two-gun
conspiracy theory of John Kennedy's death; here, Ken
nedy is called Tim Kegan, and the story unfolds about
two decades after his assassination, when his kid
brother Nick (played by Jeff Bridges) re-investigates the
facts of the event. The movie introduces a nightclub
owner named Joe Diamond (!) who shot the alleged
assassin, and contains references to the late president's
affair with a film star named Ella Mae Irving, but it's not
really in the Harold Robbins-Jacqueline Susann-Mario
Puzo vein of gossip column fiction: not even on the
most basic narrative level are we intended to take it
seriously. It's full of Looney Tunes characters imperso
nated by hammy actors. As Papa Kennedy, John Huston
plays a randy, obscene Big Daddy figure who makes his
first entrance in a golf cart with a voluptuous woman on
each side and an entourage behind him. As Nick's

mother, a disconnected southern belle with a poodle,
Dorothy Malone also seems to have emerged from a
Tennessee Williams play — a bad one, like Sweet Bird of
Youth or The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore —
and she is given lines like, "You were always mad be
cause Nick didn't want to be president like Tim did. He's
my son and he's sensitive." The cast also includes Ster
ling Hayden as a bizarre millionaire who holds war
games on the fields of his estate, Eli Wallach, Anthony
Perkins and Richard Boone — has any movie ever
boasted so many deliciously outrageous overactors?

(Toshiro Mifune, as a glorified Japanese houseboy, has
the worst role of his distinguished career; it's actually an
insult. He answers it by speaking a brand of English that
is indecipherable, like Fernando Rey's in Quintet.) Poor
Jeff Bridges, who is a tight, naturalisticactor incapable of
caricature, tries not to react in disbelief to the lunacy
around him, and ends up giving a dry, lifeless perform
ance.
I can't remember the last movie I've seen with so many
ridiculous oddball sequences. (Possibly Zardoz.) When
Nick makes love to his girl friend (Belinda Bauer), her
orgasmic screams are punctuated by his repeated pro
posals of marriage. At one point, a black chambermaid
attempts to kill him, and for some reason he rips off her
blouse in the ensuing struggle, so she runs down the
corridor bare-breasted. John Huston registers at a local
hospital for a "blood change," and there he lies in a regal
bed while a sexy nurse lets him lick whipped cream off
her fingers. Dreadful as it is, Winter Kills is often terrifi
cally funny, and the delight of most of the performers in
it is undisguised. Apparently Richert ran out of money
duringthe shooting, and had to resume a year and ahalf
laterwhen the needed cash came through, at which time
the cast reassembled to finish off the picture. They must
have perceived the process of putting this movie to
gether as perfectly consistent with what goes on in it.
Come and Get It

Frances Farmer, the Castro Theater in San Francisco

nold and Joel McCrea, to head off its three-week tribute
to producer Samuel Coldwyn. Playing a dual role — a
saloon entertainer in the Wisconsin timberlands in the
1880 sand her ambitious daughter — Farmer gives a
solid, authentic performance. This expensive movie, out
of an Edna Ferbe; novel, came very early in her brief
career (19*6), and you can see why so many people were
so confident she would have a glittering future: she is
clear-headed and unaffected here — an actress in the
Barbara Stanwyck-Jean Arthur no-nonsense school.
(She does particularly well as the bar fly in the early
scenes, singing "Aura Lee" in a mellow contralto and
falling touchingly in love with Fdward Arnold.) And the
film, scripted by lules Furthman and lane Murfin, is a

very amiable entertainment. Howard Hawks directed it,
and though William VVyler came in to finish it when
Hawks and Coldwyn fought, it has Hawks' sense of
humor — and a lively supporting cast, including Cecil
Cunningham, Mary Nash, Mady Christians and long
jawed Walter Brennan in a cheerfully fraudulent
Swedish accent. (One scene, in which Arnold breaks in
on his son — )oel McCrea — kissing Farmer, looks like
Wyler's handiwork: it is far more decorative and
finished than the rest of the picture, and the balance of
light and shadow suggests that GreggToland might have
shot it. Toland and Rudolph Mate are listed as co
cinematographers. 1 he year 1936 was Edna Ferber's sig
nal year in movies — besides Goldwvn's Come and Get
It, Universal brought out its deluxe film of Show Boat.
The melodramatic twists in Ferber's novels render them
totally unbelievable, but they have undeniable appeal in
their movie versions. Though Come and Get It is a bad
movie, it's a rollicking, ebullient one.
