# 'Morning at Seven': daytime TV comes of age in the theatre
## 
### MARC FAJER 
"Happily ever after" is not a bad way to end a play when
there is some doubt as to the outcome. However, when
a play says "happily ever after" from the opening curtain,
like a television sitcom, no matter how well it is per
formed it is not the satisfying experience that theater c an
he Paul Osborn's Morning at Seven, which opened last
week at A.C.T.'s Geary Theater in San Francisco is an
enjoyable production, but at its heart the play offers us
no more than any better-than-average evening of TV
(whi< h may, in itself, be something). It reaffirms the
comfortable nostalgic view of American small-town life
that we know so well, without offering any real insights.
The play originally opened in New York in iyi9, and
closed rather quickly. In 1980, riding the nostalgia wave
back to Broadway, the show did very well and garnered
several awards. The more recent New York production
was notable for a very broad over-played acting style
which turned th,e play into farce. Director Allen Fletcher
carefully avoids this at A.C.T. and the resulting realistic
acting and well-crafted staging are very impressive in
deed. The level of performance is almost up to that of
the superb Uncle Vanya A.C.T. produced earlier this
season. The parallel that Fletc her seems to draw, how
ever, only points out more clearly the shallowness and
utter lack of poetry in Osborn's play.
The very good cast is headed by Marrian Walters,
doing a very sensitive turn as the oldest of the four
sisters about whom the play revolves. Esther, the "smart"
sister, always knows the right thing to say, and yet is
never cloying. William Patterson is fine as her scholarly
husband who resents her communicating with her fam
ily whom he considers morons. In the end, he must
humble himself to get her back, and shows himself up to
be a rather pompous fool: a very American bit of anti
intellectualism indeed.
Sydney Walker is excellent as Carl Bolton, the hus
band of one of the sisters, who is prone to "spells"â€”a
kind of psychological glitch in which he wanders about

wondering plaintively "Where am l>" Walker manages
to make this difficult role come alive; the same role on
Broadway was utterly unbelievable. Carol Teitel as his
wife, Ida, is equally good. She is the slowest of the four,
clinging to her long-since-grown son, and getting hys
terical at the thought of his wife-to-be buying underwear
for him. Bruce Williams is very funny as the wimpy son,
Homer, and Mimi Carr is superb as his fiancee. She
manages to utter more polite word of praise in two hours
than would seem possible, and yet each superfluous
compliment sounds just as correct coming out ot her as
the last; she perfectly captures the sort of person who
finds it necessary to insist that each item in your house is
the finest she's ever seen.
Anne Lawder's performance as Cora, the mild sister, is
also very convincing, though marred by a dreadful
make-up job which was apparent every time she faced
theaudience. Pay Peinhardt is very tunny as her husband
Thor, and manages to hold on to a very convincing
Scandinavian accent throughout the production (a con
sistency that A.C.T. actors in A Christmas Carol failed to
master).
The only flaw in the cast is DeAnn Mears as the
youngest sister, Aaronetta. She manages to play a 62-
year-old woman as about 45, and has a consistently stagy
voice which stands out tremendously against the com
fortable Mid-western twang of the rest of the cast. Be
cause the role is so central to the play the gap is very
noticeable.
The set, by Ralph 112 unicello is a very persuasive set of
backyards; the worn houses, porch furniture and
stumps are where thy ought to be in prototypical nostal
gic America of the '30s. The reality which the acting, the
set and the directing create is very amusing, in the end,
but it certainly lacks both the poetry and the tragedy of
Vtinya. Fletcher's gallant attempt to make something of
the piece fails in the end, not for want of trying, but
because this sort of Americ an small-town life is merely
the stuff of which sitcoms are made of.
