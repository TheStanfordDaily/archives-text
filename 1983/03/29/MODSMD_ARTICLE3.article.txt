# Experts here rap Reagan arms plan

Leading arms control experts here
are critical of President Reagan's
plan, announced last Wednesday
night, to speed up research on
space-based Anti-Ballistic Missiles
(ABMs) which would "intercept and
destroy strategic ballistic missiles be
fore they reach our own soil."
Although Reagan did not specify
the type of weapons he would like to
see explored, many experts specu
late that his suggestion calls for exo
tic and futuristic weapons — for
example, laser weapons, military
space stations, particle beams and
nuclear weapon-pumped x-ray las
ers. Some experts also say any
space-based ABM system would be
destabilizing and ineffective, and
would signify a major shift in nuclear
weapon strategy.
"I don't know of any technology —
lasers or missiles — that would be an
effective defense," said Sidney Drell,
national weapon systems specialist
and deputy director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).
"And because of the enormity of the
power of nuclear warheads you need
a system which will be 100 percent
effective."
The experts' major criticism was
the effectiveness of a weapon system

like the one Reagan envisioned. Coit
Blacker, associate director of the
Stanford Arms Control and Disar
mament Program, and Ted Ralston, a
staff member of the program, both
suggested that constructing an effec
tive system would be extremely dif
ficult and expensive.
Ralston said a viable system would
cost at least $100 billion. The entire
defense budget for fiscal year 1983 is
$245 billion.
Ralston also said it would cost
much less, and probably be very
easy, for the Soviet Union to destroy
any space-based ABM system.
Reagan ordered "a comprehensive
and intensive effort to define a long
term research and development
program'' of ''defensive
technologies" which would protect
U.S. citizens who are being "held
hostage" by the present nuclear doc
trine of deterrence. A space-based
ABM system such as the one Reagan
proposes would probably not be
ready until after the year 2000.
Deterrence is based on the as
sumption that any rational nation will
not launch a nuclear attack if it knows
its citizens will be destroyed by a
retaliatory strike and has guided U.S.
policy ever since the Soviet Union
acquired the ability to launch a nu
