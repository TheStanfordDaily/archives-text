# Experts here rap Reagan arms plan
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
Leading arms control experts here
are critical of President Reagan's
plan, announced last Wednesday
night, to speed up research on
space-based Anti-Ballistic Missiles
(ABMs) which would "intercept and
destroy strategic ballistic missiles be
fore they reach our own soil."
Although Reagan did not specify
the type of weapons he would like to
see explored, many experts specu
late that his suggestion calls for exo
tic and futuristic weapons — for
example, laser weapons, military
space stations, particle beams and
nuclear weapon-pumped x-ray las
ers. Some experts also say any
space-based ABM system would be
destabilizing and ineffective, and
would signify a major shift in nuclear
weapon strategy.
"I don't know of any technology —
lasers or missiles — that would be an
effective defense," said Sidney Drell,
national weapon systems specialist
and deputy director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).
"And because of the enormity of the
power of nuclear warheads you need
a system which will be 100 percent
effective."
The experts' major criticism was
the effectiveness of a weapon system

like the one Reagan envisioned. Coit
Blacker, associate director of the
Stanford Arms Control and Disar
mament Program, and Ted Ralston, a
staff member of the program, both
suggested that constructing an effec
tive system would be extremely dif
ficult and expensive.
Ralston said a viable system would
cost at least $100 billion. The entire
defense budget for fiscal year 1983 is
$245 billion.
Ralston also said it would cost
much less, and probably be very
easy, for the Soviet Union to destroy
any space-based ABM system.
Reagan ordered "a comprehensive
and intensive effort to define a long
term research and development
program'' of ''defensive
technologies" which would protect
U.S. citizens who are being "held
hostage" by the present nuclear doc
trine of deterrence. A space-based
ABM system such as the one Reagan
proposes would probably not be
ready until after the year 2000.
Deterrence is based on the as
sumption that any rational nation will
not launch a nuclear attack if it knows
its citizens will be destroyed by a
retaliatory strike and has guided U.S.
policy ever since the Soviet Union
acquired the ability to launch a nu
clear attack. The ABM Treaty of 1972,
based on this theory, prohibited de
veloping, testing or deploying ABM
missiles.
Reagan said his plan would not
break the ABM Treaty, but it would, if
carried out, result in a major shift in
deterrence policy and go against the
present treaty.
Blacker sharply criticized this pol
icy shift because he said it would be
destabilizing, if it were effective, by
making the United States invulnera
ble to Soviet attack,
"A destabilizing situation in
creases the chance of war," Blacker
said.
"The Soviet Union has been re

searching the same kind of system
but hasn't made a high-level com
mitment because they think it will be
destabilizing," he said.
Blacker said Reagan's speech sig
nifies a high-level commitment to a
space-based ABM system, and that
Reagan's "heart is in the right place,"
but that the president made the
speech as a political move.
He wants to draw attention away
from the MX and his conventional
build-up and onto other programs so
he can achieve what he wants to
achieve in these areas," he said.
Ralston disagreed with Reagan's
claim that his plan would not break
the ABM Treaty, and said develop
ment of any ABM system would vio
late the treaty.
Drell said he was "puzzled" by
Reagan's claim. He added that arms

control, not Reagan's plan, is the so
lution to the arms race.
Edward Teller, a senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution, is a
principal proponent of one space
based ABM system that would in
volve nuclear weapon-pumped x-ray
lasers. He could not be reached for
comment.
A staff member at the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratories said two
weeks ago that a component of a
controversial proposal at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory (SSRL) would aid in the devel
opment of the x-ray laser weapons
system. The proposal review panel at
SSRL is expected to make a recom
mendation whether or not to accept
the proposal to the laboratory's di
rector, Arthur Bienenstock, within
the next two months.

Leading arms control experts here
are critical of President Reagan's
plan, announced last Wednesday
night, to speed up research on
space-based Anti-Ballistic Missiles
(ABMs) which would "intercept and
destroy strategic ballistic missiles be
fore they reach our own soil."
Although Reagan did not specify
the type of weapons he would like to
see explored, many experts specu
late that his suggestion calls for exo
tic and futuristic weapons — for
example, laser weapons, military
space stations, particle beams and
nuclear weapon-pumped x-ray las
ers. Some experts also say any
space-based ABM system would be
destabilizing and ineffective, and
would signify a major shift in nuclear
weapon strategy.
"I don't know of any technology —
lasers or missiles — that would be an
effective defense," said Sidney Drell,
national weapon systems specialist
and deputy director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).
"And because of the enormity of the
power of nuclear warheads you need
a system which will be 100 percent
effective."
The experts' major criticism was
the effectiveness of a weapon system

like the one Reagan envisioned. Coit
Blacker, associate director of the
Stanford Arms Control and Disar
mament Program, and Ted Ralston, a
staff member of the program, both
suggested that constructing an effec
tive system would be extremely dif
ficult and expensive.
Ralston said a viable system would
cost at least $100 billion. The entire
defense budget for fiscal year 1983 is
$245 billion.
Ralston also said it would cost
much less, and probably be very
easy, for the Soviet Union to destroy
any space-based ABM system.
Reagan ordered "a comprehensive
and intensive effort to define a long
term research and development
program'' of ''defensive
technologies" which would protect
U.S. citizens who are being "held
hostage" by the present nuclear doc
trine of deterrence. A space-based
ABM system such as the one Reagan
proposes would probably not be
ready until after the year 2000.
Deterrence is based on the as
sumption that any rational nation will
not launch a nuclear attack if it knows
its citizens will be destroyed by a
retaliatory strike and has guided U.S.
policy ever since the Soviet Union
acquired the ability to launch a nu
clear attack. The ABM Treaty of 1972,
based on this theory, prohibited de
veloping, testing or deploying ABM
missiles.
Reagan said his plan would not
break the ABM Treaty, but it would, if
carried out, result in a major shift in
deterrence policy and go against the
present treaty.
Blacker sharply criticized this pol
icy shift because he said it would be
destabilizing, if it were effective, by
making the United States invulnera
ble to Soviet attack,
"A destabilizing situation in
creases the chance of war," Blacker
said.
"The Soviet Union has been re

searching the same kind of system
but hasn't made a high-level com
mitment because they think it will be
destabilizing," he said.
Blacker said Reagan's speech sig
nifies a high-level commitment to a
space-based ABM system, and that
Reagan's "heart is in the right place,"
but that the president made the
speech as a political move.
He wants to draw attention away
from the MX and his conventional
build-up and onto other programs so
he can achieve what he wants to
achieve in these areas," he said.
Ralston disagreed with Reagan's
claim that his plan would not break
the ABM Treaty, and said develop
ment of any ABM system would vio
late the treaty.
Drell said he was "puzzled" by
Reagan's claim. He added that arms

control, not Reagan's plan, is the so
lution to the arms race.
Edward Teller, a senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution, is a
principal proponent of one space
based ABM system that would in
volve nuclear weapon-pumped x-ray
lasers. He could not be reached for
comment.
A staff member at the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratories said two
weeks ago that a component of a
controversial proposal at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory (SSRL) would aid in the devel
opment of the x-ray laser weapons
system. The proposal review panel at
SSRL is expected to make a recom
mendation whether or not to accept
the proposal to the laboratory's di
rector, Arthur Bienenstock, within
the next two months.
