# Forgery suspect has 'fraudulent' history
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Aristotle Economon — the senior here recently
charged with selling 18 phony Senior Casino
Night tickets — is no novice at conceiving com
plicated scams. In fact, Economon has a history
of initiating elaborate frauds.
In January, the 21-year-old biology major
pleaded guilty to charges of mail fraud against
the Sacramento Bee. Economon was the
ringleader of a group that won $10,000 by sup
posedly picking football winners in the See's
weekly football pool — but he later admitted that
he had mailed the winning scores after the games
were played, in pre-postmarked envelopes.
Economon and his friends mailed envelopes to
themselves, erased the addresses and then sent
the doctored envelopes to the See, he said.
Economon also used false identification to ac
quire more than $1000 worth of telephones. He
presented false driver's licenses at several tele
phone stores in the area to attain an array of
phone equipment. The pre-med student
pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charges fol
lowing this scam in San Mateo and Alameda
counties, and his case is pending in Santa Clara

County.
Economon's arrest March 19 on charges of
forging the tickets occurred while he was taking
the Graduate Management Aptitude Test
(GMAT) for Jorgen Kvick, a student at Sac
ramento State, who has also been arrested in
connection with the phony-ticket scam. Neither
student will be charged for the alleged test fraud.
Economon said he resented the police de
partment's handling of his arrest. His bail was set
at $100,000, and he and Kvick were arrested "like
we were public enemy number one." Six police
cars surrounded his house, according to Econo
mon, and four undercover agents arrested him
during a break at the GMAT.
Economon's arrest warrant was dated March
17, he said, which was while he was still here on
campus taking finals. Economon claimed that he
would have surrendered himself if the police had
contacted him, and that there was "no pro
cedural reason" for the "blatant waste of tax
payer money" of sending police officers to Sac
ramento. He said he didn't know how the police
knew that he was taking the GMAT, and claimed
his phone might have been wiretapped.
Economon and Kvick are currently charged

with forging tickets to Senior Casino Night, held
at the Menlo Circus Club on Feb. 4, and selling
them to unsuspecting students. Economon re
fusedyesterday to comment on the charges.
Economon said he engaged in the phone and
mail scams "essentially just to see if they could
be done." He said he is repentant now, and is
worried about a possible suspension from the
University. "It's a definite possibility," he said.
"That's what you get for screwing around."
The pre-med student is also worried about the
effect of his record on his professional future. "It
will most definitely hurt my chances for getting
into medical school," he said.
Ronald Hudson, assistant dean of student af
fairs, refused to disclose whether the Stanford
Judicial Council is initiating judicial proceedings
against Economon based upon the allegedly
forged tickets. Suspensions may be issued if a
student has violated the honor code or the fun
damental standard (which states, in part, that
students must show "respect for order, morality,
personal honor and the rights of others").
Economon is presently free on bail until his
April 4 hearing in Palo Alto Municipal Court.
