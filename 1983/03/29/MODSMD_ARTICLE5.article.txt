# Research info hard to obtain
## Student unable to get DoD index 
### JULIANN ANDERSON Staff writer 
Last November, a graduate student here unsuc
cessfully tried to obtain a Department of Defense
(DoD) index of research from the engineering library
while examining military funding. Now, a govern
ment paper shuffle prevents him from getting similar
documents.
The man digging for the papers is Peter
Hochschild, a third-year doctoral student in com
puter science. He said, referring to his department's
research, "What I'm trying to do is find out the mili
tary relevance of each research project."
Hochschild belongs to a 15-member group con
cerned about the use of Stanford research by the
Army, Navy, Air Force and the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA). These military
agencies provide partial funding to various University
departments.
Hochschild began his search last year by asking for
Technical Abstract Bulletins (TABs), which are pub
lished by DARPA. "A TAB is an index; it is like a
Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, except the
literature is research," he said.
When he requested the TABs, the engineering li
brary sent them back to the Defense Department.
According to Celine Walker, chief of science librar

ies, the documents were unclassified at the time.
Walker said DoD required assurance "that there
was no way he could use the data to embarrass the
U.S. government."
She explained, "There was no way I could control
how he could use the information — I would have to
stand over him and watch his every move."
She also said there was a $10,000 fine or two years in
jail for the person responsible for the TABs if use of
the index was abused.
"Stanford policy is to have open research. Informa
tion supporting research is open, except this (the
TABs)," she said. She added that the index was sent
back to Washington because it was "just too difficult
to police."
The TABs were declared classified documents as of
lanuary by DoD, according to Walker.
Charles Hitt, registration assistant at the Defense
Technical Information Center (DTIC), said the TABs
were classified because "the Secretary of Defense
said that too much information was hanging around."
However, Walker said this classification was not
retroactive — the old TABs are still unrestricted.
However, the engineering library no longer has any
of them.
Unable to obtain the index, Hochschild then tried
