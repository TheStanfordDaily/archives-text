# Research info hard to obtain
## Student unable to get DoD index 
### JULIANN ANDERSON Staff writer 
Last November, a graduate student here unsuc
cessfully tried to obtain a Department of Defense
(DoD) index of research from the engineering library
while examining military funding. Now, a govern
ment paper shuffle prevents him from getting similar
documents.
The man digging for the papers is Peter
Hochschild, a third-year doctoral student in com
puter science. He said, referring to his department's
research, "What I'm trying to do is find out the mili
tary relevance of each research project."
Hochschild belongs to a 15-member group con
cerned about the use of Stanford research by the
Army, Navy, Air Force and the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA). These military
agencies provide partial funding to various University
departments.
Hochschild began his search last year by asking for
Technical Abstract Bulletins (TABs), which are pub
lished by DARPA. "A TAB is an index; it is like a
Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, except the
literature is research," he said.
When he requested the TABs, the engineering li
brary sent them back to the Defense Department.
According to Celine Walker, chief of science librar

ies, the documents were unclassified at the time.
Walker said DoD required assurance "that there
was no way he could use the data to embarrass the
U.S. government."
She explained, "There was no way I could control
how he could use the information — I would have to
stand over him and watch his every move."
She also said there was a $10,000 fine or two years in
jail for the person responsible for the TABs if use of
the index was abused.
"Stanford policy is to have open research. Informa
tion supporting research is open, except this (the
TABs)," she said. She added that the index was sent
back to Washington because it was "just too difficult
to police."
The TABs were declared classified documents as of
lanuary by DoD, according to Walker.
Charles Hitt, registration assistant at the Defense
Technical Information Center (DTIC), said the TABs
were classified because "the Secretary of Defense
said that too much information was hanging around."
However, Walker said this classification was not
retroactive — the old TABs are still unrestricted.
However, the engineering library no longer has any
of them.
Unable to obtain the index, Hochschild then tried
to see some documents called Work Unit Summaries
related to these particular TABs.
He explained that a Work Unit Summary is written
for each research contract funded by the Army, Navy,
Air Force or DARPA. The dollar amount of military
funding and the project's military relevance are listed
on the form.
Like TABs, these documents are produced by
DARPA. However, the summaries remain in com
puter files of the Defense Technical Information Cen
ter.
Because they are unclassified, these files were
under no access restrictions when Hochschild re
quested them, but the computer accounts used to
summon the files were limited to certain professors

and the library. When the library sent back the TABs,
it also canceled its account for the summaries.
Previously, Hochschild had managed to acquire
quite a few Work Unit Summaries. He said, "The
library was very helpful with this."
However, he said that oncethe library canceled the
DTIC account he had no way of obtaining the sum
maries without using a professor's or friend's access.
He refused to do this, declining to resort to "connec
tions."
Hochschild then submitted a Freedom of Informa
tion Act request to DARPA. However, that agency did
not have the Work Unit Summaries for the Stanford
research contracts.
According to Lt. Col. Duane Adams, the official
who handled Hochschild's request, "We should have
been preparing them all along ... it was just an
oversight."
Adams subsequently sent the summary forms to

various Stanford professors for completion.
Hochschild said in a letter to those professors that
Adams gave him a choice: either have the forms filled
out at Stanford, or withdraw the request.
To spare the researchers extra paperwork,
Hochschild withdrew the request.
He said that even if the professors had filled out the
forms, he would not have obtained the information
he wanted, because DARPA is supposed to complete
the summaries, including the military relevance and
funding facts.
As for the next step, Hochschild said, "One thing
I'm working on now is getting other documents be
sides the TABs and Work Unit Summaries."
Jerry Plotnick, also a third-year Ph.D. computer
science student, founded the group Hochschild
works with; it is currently nameless.
Plotnick said, "The research projects are ongoing
— they may last three years or longer. New people

join projects in the middle. The question is 'Should a
student see what his work is applied to?' "
He added, "I wouldn't want to be involved in any
thing dealing with weapons research."
Commenting on secrecy in general, Hochschild
said, "In the last year or two, there has been growing
apprehension in the Department of Defense about
the leakage of technology. They used to worry about
machine guns being built and sent out to communist
nations. Now they're worryingabout ideas being sent
out.
"Stanford's got a big problem. On one hand, any
university wants to fight secrecy — it goes against
open research. On the other hand, if Stanford takes
funding from the military, it is in a weak position to
argue against secrecy. The Department of Defense
has tremendous leverage."
