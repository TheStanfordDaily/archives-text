# PA reviews Stanford West
## 
### SID ATKINS Senior staff writer 
The density and affordability of
housing units continue to be two
pressing issues surrounding the
Stanford West development project,
which is now being reviewed by Palo
Alto City Council.
The project is moving slowly
through council, which is scheduled
to meet two more times before fi
nally voting on the project in early
May. But William Massy, University
vice president for Business and Fi
nance, said he is "cautiously optimis
tic" that the plan will be approved
eventually.
Environmental and traffic issues
surrounding the Stanford West proj
ect first came before the council in a
meeting on March 16, when mem
bers listened to proposals from Uni
versity and city representatives, as
well as reports from outside consul
tants on traffic and architecture. "It
wasn't intended to be a decision
making meeting. We were there
mainly to assimilate data," said
councilman Larry Klein.
But expense and concentration of
the project also dominate much of
current debate.

If the University has its way, Stan
ford West would be a 1275-unit hous
ing facility located on 46 acres just off
Willow Road west of the shopping
center. The project's townhouses,
apartments and single-family houses
are designed to help alleviate the
area-wide housing shortage for fac
ulty and staff.
University President Donald Ken
nedy has labeled this shortage one of
the most serious problems confront
ing the University in the '80s.
A city planning commission earlier
had recommended that the overall
size of the project be cut from 1275
units down to 920, thereby lessening
the density of the housing. Univer
sity officials object to that reduction,
however, because it would drive up
the cost of an individual unit. Fixed
costs would have to be spread over
fewer people.
Frank Morrow, University director
of real estate, said, "The balance be
tween density and affordability is
very delicate. Specifically, by reduc
ing the density by 100 units, the cost
of the remaining units goes up by
approximately $1500 per unit. For the
next 100 units lost the cost of those
remaining rises $3000, and for the

third the cost of the remaining units
goes up nearly $7000 per unit."
According to Massy's statement to
council, the proposed project al
ready is 20 percent less dense than
zoning allows and would allow three
times as much space as required.
But Massy said, "That figure of
1275 is not set in concrete; 920 strikes
me as a little too low, but we'll be
discussing this with the council."
The planning commission did pro
pose an incentive plan whereby the
University could earn up to 100 more
units above the 920 base figure.
Under that plan, the University
would contract to leave other parts of
its land undeveloped for a set
number of years in exchange for
permission to build additional units
on Stanford West.
Massy "respectfully declined" this
proposal at the last meeting, saying
that he was not willing to commit
campus lands not related to Stanford
West in long-term open space con
tracts. "Our policy is that each proj
ect should stand on its own merits.
We cannot gauge the relative values
of 'incentive units' on Stanford West
on the one hand and the loss of irrep
lacable resources that may be
needed for future academic pur
poses on the other."
City Planning commissioner lack
Soutoius, however, reacted some
what negatively to the University's
rejection of the incentive plan.
"The University's concerns are
understandable, but I wonder if they
are real concerns that are insur
mountable."
If approved, Stanford West would
become the largest development
project built in Palo Alto since the
19505. It would increase the total

number of housing units in the city,
now at approximately 20,000, by
more than 5 percent.
Because this project is exception
ally large, creation of additional traf
fic lights and recreational facilities
mav be needed to meet Palo Alto city
standards. The costs of these im
provements — known as mitigations
— related to a project this large can
be substantial, and the University is
also discussing these with city offi
cials to try to reach a mutually agree
able solution.
Massy said, "We shall approach
the negotiations in a spirit of com
promise, and I am confident that we
can reach an understanding on most
of the issues. At the same time, I urge
everyone concerned to bpar in mind

the strong correlation between the
cost of mitigations and the ultimate
price of units.
After the initial hurdle of evaluat
ing the project's environmental im
pact has been surmounted, the focus
in council will then be the proposed
design of the units, which must also
be approved.
Andy Doty, University director of
community relations, said, "At this
point it's fair to say that there is a
certain amount of skepticism in
council on the design of the project.
Their feeling is that the buildings are
too largt» and look the same." Doty
emphasized, however, that the
stance of the University on this issue
is "flexibility and cooperation."

ect first came before the council in a
meeting on March 16, when mem
bers listened to proposals from Uni
versity and city representatives, as
well as reports from outside consul
tants on traffic and architecture. "It
wasn't intended to be a decision
making meeting. We were there
mainly to assimilate data," said
councilman Larry Klein.
But expense and concentration of
the project also dominate much of
current debate.

If the University has its way, Stan
ford West would be a 1275-unit hous
ing facility located on 46 acres just off
Willow Road west of the shopping
center. The project's townhouses,
apartments and single-family houses
are designed to help alleviate the
area-wide housing shortage for fac
ulty and staff.
University President Donald Ken
nedy has labeled this shortage one of
the most serious problems confront
ing the University in the '80s.
A city planning commission earlier
had recommended that the overall
size of the project be cut from 1275
units down to 920, thereby lessening
the density of the housing. Univer
sity officials object to that reduction,
however, because it would drive up
the cost of an individual unit. Fixed
costs would have to be spread over
fewer people.
Frank Morrow, University director
of real estate, said, "The balance be
tween density and affordability is
very delicate. Specifically, by reduc
ing the density by 100 units, the cost
of the remaining units goes up by
approximately $1500 per unit. For the
next 100 units lost the cost of those
remaining rises $3000, and for the

third the cost of the remaining units
goes up nearly $7000 per unit."
According to Massy's statement to
council, the proposed project al
ready is 20 percent less dense than
zoning allows and would allow three
times as much space as required.
But Massy said, "That figure of
1275 is not set in concrete; 920 strikes
me as a little too low, but we'll be
discussing this with the council."
The planning commission did pro
pose an incentive plan whereby the
University could earn up to 100 more
units above the 920 base figure.
Under that plan, the University
would contract to leave other parts of
its land undeveloped for a set
number of years in exchange for
permission to build additional units
on Stanford West.
Massy "respectfully declined" this
proposal at the last meeting, saying
that he was not willing to commit
campus lands not related to Stanford
West in long-term open space con
tracts. "Our policy is that each proj
ect should stand on its own merits.
We cannot gauge the relative values
of 'incentive units' on Stanford West
on the one hand and the loss of irrep
lacable resources that may be
needed for future academic pur
poses on the other."
City Planning commissioner lack
Soutoius, however, reacted some
what negatively to the University's
rejection of the incentive plan.
"The University's concerns are
understandable, but I wonder if they
are real concerns that are insur
mountable."
If approved, Stanford West would
become the largest development
project built in Palo Alto since the
19505. It would increase the total

number of housing units in the city,
now at approximately 20,000, by
more than 5 percent.
Because this project is exception
ally large, creation of additional traf
fic lights and recreational facilities
mav be needed to meet Palo Alto city
standards. The costs of these im
provements — known as mitigations
— related to a project this large can
be substantial, and the University is
also discussing these with city offi
cials to try to reach a mutually agree
able solution.
Massy said, "We shall approach
the negotiations in a spirit of com
promise, and I am confident that we
can reach an understanding on most
of the issues. At the same time, I urge
everyone concerned to bpar in mind

the strong correlation between the
cost of mitigations and the ultimate
price of units.
After the initial hurdle of evaluat
ing the project's environmental im
pact has been surmounted, the focus
in council will then be the proposed
design of the units, which must also
be approved.
Andy Doty, University director of
community relations, said, "At this
point it's fair to say that there is a
certain amount of skepticism in
council on the design of the project.
Their feeling is that the buildings are
too largt» and look the same." Doty
emphasized, however, that the
stance of the University on this issue
is "flexibility and cooperation."
The density and affordability of
housing units continue to be two
pressing issues surrounding the
Stanford West development project,
which is now being reviewed by Palo
Alto City Council.
The project is moving slowly
through council, which is scheduled
to meet two more times before fi
nally voting on the project in early
May. But William Massy, University
vice president for Business and Fi
nance, said he is "cautiously optimis
tic" that the plan will be approved
eventually.
