# PA reviews Stanford West
## 
### SID ATKINS Senior staff writer 
The density and affordability of
housing units continue to be two
pressing issues surrounding the
Stanford West development project,
which is now being reviewed by Palo
Alto City Council.
The project is moving slowly
through council, which is scheduled
to meet two more times before fi
nally voting on the project in early
May. But William Massy, University
vice president for Business and Fi
nance, said he is "cautiously optimis
tic" that the plan will be approved
eventually.
Environmental and traffic issues
surrounding the Stanford West proj
ect first came before the council in a
meeting on March 16, when mem
bers listened to proposals from Uni
versity and city representatives, as
well as reports from outside consul
tants on traffic and architecture. "It
wasn't intended to be a decision
making meeting. We were there
mainly to assimilate data," said
councilman Larry Klein.
But expense and concentration of
the project also dominate much of
current debate.

If the University has its way, Stan
ford West would be a 1275-unit hous
ing facility located on 46 acres just off
Willow Road west of the shopping
center. The project's townhouses,
apartments and single-family houses
are designed to help alleviate the
area-wide housing shortage for fac
ulty and staff.
University President Donald Ken
nedy has labeled this shortage one of
the most serious problems confront
ing the University in the '80s.
A city planning commission earlier
had recommended that the overall
size of the project be cut from 1275
units down to 920, thereby lessening
the density of the housing. Univer
sity officials object to that reduction,
however, because it would drive up
the cost of an individual unit. Fixed
costs would have to be spread over
fewer people.
Frank Morrow, University director
of real estate, said, "The balance be
tween density and affordability is
very delicate. Specifically, by reduc
ing the density by 100 units, the cost
of the remaining units goes up by
approximately $1500 per unit. For the
next 100 units lost the cost of those
remaining rises $3000, and for the

third the cost of the remaining units
goes up nearly $7000 per unit."
According to Massy's statement to
council, the proposed project al
ready is 20 percent less dense than
zoning allows and would allow three
times as much space as required.
But Massy said, "That figure of
1275 is not set in concrete; 920 strikes
me as a little too low, but we'll be
discussing this with the council."
The planning commission did pro
pose an incentive plan whereby the
University could earn up to 100 more
units above the 920 base figure.
Under that plan, the University
would contract to leave other parts of
its land undeveloped for a set
number of years in exchange for
permission to build additional units
on Stanford West.
Massy "respectfully declined" this
proposal at the last meeting, saying
that he was not willing to commit
campus lands not related to Stanford
West in long-term open space con
tracts. "Our policy is that each proj
ect should stand on its own merits.
We cannot gauge the relative values
of 'incentive units' on Stanford West
on the one hand and the loss of irrep
