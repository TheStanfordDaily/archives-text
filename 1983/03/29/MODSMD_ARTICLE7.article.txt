Governor proposes crime laws
Santa Cruz — Gov. Deukmejian outlined crime leg
islation "to spark a renaissance of public safety" yes
terday after telling educators that money for schools
would be tight this year.
In remarks prepared for the California State Sher
iffs' Association, the Republican governor gave gen
eral descriptions of the crime bills he plans to unveil
Thursday, including speedups in jury selection, re
strictions on appeals and a revival of grand jury indict
ments.
He did not specifically mention one of the most
controversial proposals to surface in press reports of
his package, a plan to reduce the size of juries from 12
to six in misdemeanor cases.
Deukmejian said he would support legislation, in

cluding a state constitutional amendment, "to speed
up the now-cumbersome and costly process of jury
selection."
He also said he would sponsor a measure to "bring
the grand jury system back to California."
The Legislature has alreay rejected several attempts
to reverse a 1978 state Supreme Court ruling that said
defendants indicted by grand juries were entitled to a
preliminary hearing, where they could appear in per
son, with a lawyer, and present evidence to contest
the charges. That ruling has reduced, but not
eliminated, the practice of closed-door grand jury in
dictments in California.
Criticism of Watt mounts
Washington — James Watt, President Reagan's

combative and controversial Interior secretary, yes
terday was described as a "political liability" by Re
publican Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the second
prominent GOP strategist in the last 10 days to suggest
that Watt is hurting Reagan politically.
Fahrenkopf's remarks came on the same day that a
group of environmental leaders stepped up their at
tacks on the interior secretary.
Although praising Watt as a loyalist who has
faithfully followed Reagan's "mandate" at the White
House, Fahrenkopf said in responding to questions at
a press luncheon that "if judged as an asset or a liabil
ity on a scale of 10, he (Watt) would be a liability to
day."
Edward Rollins, Reagan's assistant for political af
fairs, had previously told the Los Angeles Times that

Watt was becoming a political liability and suggested
the secretary might ultimately resign to spare the ad
ministration further damage over its controversial en
vironmental policies.
Despite those statements and even stronger com
ments along similar lines made earlier by several
White House aides who talked to reporters on condi
tion they not be identified, Watt has continued to en
joy the backing of Reagan, whom Watt describes as
his "soulmate."
