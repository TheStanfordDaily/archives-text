Governor proposes crime laws
Santa Cruz — Gov. Deukmejian outlined crime leg
islation "to spark a renaissance of public safety" yes
terday after telling educators that money for schools
would be tight this year.
In remarks prepared for the California State Sher
iffs' Association, the Republican governor gave gen
eral descriptions of the crime bills he plans to unveil
Thursday, including speedups in jury selection, re
strictions on appeals and a revival of grand jury indict
ments.
He did not specifically mention one of the most
controversial proposals to surface in press reports of
his package, a plan to reduce the size of juries from 12
to six in misdemeanor cases.
Deukmejian said he would support legislation, in

cluding a state constitutional amendment, "to speed
up the now-cumbersome and costly process of jury
selection."
He also said he would sponsor a measure to "bring
the grand jury system back to California."
The Legislature has alreay rejected several attempts
to reverse a 1978 state Supreme Court ruling that said
defendants indicted by grand juries were entitled to a
preliminary hearing, where they could appear in per
son, with a lawyer, and present evidence to contest
the charges. That ruling has reduced, but not
eliminated, the practice of closed-door grand jury in
dictments in California.
Criticism of Watt mounts
Washington — James Watt, President Reagan's

combative and controversial Interior secretary, yes
terday was described as a "political liability" by Re
publican Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the second
prominent GOP strategist in the last 10 days to suggest
that Watt is hurting Reagan politically.
Fahrenkopf's remarks came on the same day that a
group of environmental leaders stepped up their at
tacks on the interior secretary.
Although praising Watt as a loyalist who has
faithfully followed Reagan's "mandate" at the White
House, Fahrenkopf said in responding to questions at
a press luncheon that "if judged as an asset or a liabil
ity on a scale of 10, he (Watt) would be a liability to
day."
Edward Rollins, Reagan's assistant for political af
fairs, had previously told the Los Angeles Times that

Watt was becoming a political liability and suggested
the secretary might ultimately resign to spare the ad
ministration further damage over its controversial en
vironmental policies.
Despite those statements and even stronger com
ments along similar lines made earlier by several
White House aides who talked to reporters on condi
tion they not be identified, Watt has continued to en
joy the backing of Reagan, whom Watt describes as
his "soulmate."
Rebels attack Nicaraguan town
Managua, Nicaragua — Anti-Sandinista exiles from
Honduras besieged the town of Rancho Grande yes
terday, and fighting between rebels and government
troops was reported at other points in northern
Nicaragua.
The guerrillas of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force
attacked Rancho Grande, a town of 5000 people 138
miles north of Managua, early Friday. Residents re
ported by telephone yesterday at the town was sur
rounded, and the insurgents were firing ,50-caliber
machine guns and mortars.
In New York, the U .N. Security Council debated the
Nicaraguan government's charge that it is under at
tack from exiles based in Honduras who are armed
and supported by the United States, and Nicaraguan
Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco pro
posed Nicaraguan-Honduran and Nicaraguan-U.S.
negotiations.
Haddad blamed for deadlock
Beirut, Lebanon — Lebanese news media and Is
raeli sources said yesterday that the role of militia
commander Saad Haddad, Israel's ally in southern
Lebanon, is the last obstacle to progress in the troop
withdrawal negotiations.
"The talks remain deadlocked because Israel insists
on giving Maj. Saad Haddad and his militia a major se
curity role in the South," the Lebanese state radio re
ported as U.S. presidential envoy Philip Habib re
turned to Beirut from Israel with no indications of a
breakthrough.
The U.S.-Israeli-Lebanese talks on the withdrawal
of foreign troops from Lebanon resume Thursday in
the Israeli border town of Kiryat Shmona. Israeli
sources, who asked anonymity, agreed that settle
ment was blocked by the dispute over Haddad's
future role in security arrangements to keep the
Palestinian guerrillas from returning to south Leba
non.
The Lebanese government last week rejected Is
rael's demand that Haddad, who defied the Beirut

government and set up his own territory along the Is
raeli-Lebanese border, be reinstated in the Lebanese
army and put in charge of security arrangements in
the South.
US Steel may buy British steel
A bitter dispute between U.S. Steel Corp. and the
United Steelworkers Union erupted yesterday in the
wake of a disclosure by the company, the leading in
dustry critic of imported steel, that it is negotiating to
purchase subsidized British steel.
The company said that it was discussing a purchase
of steel from a British Steel Corp. mill in Scotland that
would be shipped to U.S. Steel's Fairless Works near
Philadelphia for finishing. The company said that the
talks were still in progress and "no conclusions have
been reached."
The union claimed that at least 2000 U.S. workers
could lose their jobs if, as result, the raw steel-produc
ing operations at Fairless were ended.

New York — Dpubts about the outlook for interest
rates helped push stock prices broadly lower yester
day in the quietest trading so far in 1983.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 5.81 on
Friday, dropped another 6.77 to 1133.32.

miles north of Managua, early Friday. Residents re

Nicaraguan government's charge that it is under at
tack from exiles based in Honduras who are armed

negotiations.
Haddad blamed for deadlock
Beirut, Lebanon — Lebanese news media and Is
raeli sources said yesterday that the role of militia
commander Saad Haddad, Israel's ally in southern
Lebanon, is the last obstacle to progress in the troop
withdrawal negotiations.
"The talks remain deadlocked because Israel insists
on giving Maj. Saad Haddad and his militia a major se
curity role in the South," the Lebanese state radio re
ported as U.S. presidential envoy Philip Habib re
turned to Beirut from Israel with no indications of a
breakthrough.
The U.S.-Israeli-Lebanese talks on the withdrawal
of foreign troops from Lebanon resume Thursday in
the Israeli border town of Kiryat Shmona. Israeli
sources, who asked anonymity, agreed that settle
ment was blocked by the dispute over Haddad's
future role in security arrangements to keep the
Palestinian guerrillas from returning to south Leba
non.
The Lebanese government last week rejected Is
rael's demand that Haddad, who defied the Beirut

government and set up his own territory along the Is
raeli-Lebanese border, be reinstated in the Lebanese
army and put in charge of security arrangements in
the South.
US Steel may buy British steel
A bitter dispute between U.S. Steel Corp. and the
United Steelworkers Union erupted yesterday in the
wake of a disclosure by the company, the leading in
dustry critic of imported steel, that it is negotiating to
purchase subsidized British steel.
The company said that it was discussing a purchase
of steel from a British Steel Corp. mill in Scotland that
would be shipped to U.S. Steel's Fairless Works near
Philadelphia for finishing. The company said that the
talks were still in progress and "no conclusions have
been reached."
The union claimed that at least 2000 U.S. workers
could lose their jobs if, as result, the raw steel-produc
ing operations at Fairless were ended.

Governor proposes crime laws
Santa Cruz — Gov. Deukmejian outlined crime leg
islation "to spark a renaissance of public safety" yes
terday after telling educators that money for schools
would be tight this year.
In remarks prepared for the California State Sher
iffs' Association, the Republican governor gave gen
eral descriptions of the crime bills he plans to unveil
Thursday, including speedups in jury selection, re
strictions on appeals and a revival of grand jury indict
ments.
He did not specifically mention one of the most
controversial proposals to surface in press reports of
his package, a plan to reduce the size of juries from 12
to six in misdemeanor cases.
Deukmejian said he would support legislation, in

cluding a state constitutional amendment, "to speed
up the now-cumbersome and costly process of jury
selection."
He also said he would sponsor a measure to "bring
the grand jury system back to California."
The Legislature has alreay rejected several attempts
to reverse a 1978 state Supreme Court ruling that said
defendants indicted by grand juries were entitled to a
preliminary hearing, where they could appear in per
son, with a lawyer, and present evidence to contest
the charges. That ruling has reduced, but not
eliminated, the practice of closed-door grand jury in
dictments in California.
Criticism of Watt mounts
Washington — James Watt, President Reagan's

combative and controversial Interior secretary, yes
terday was described as a "political liability" by Re
publican Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the second
prominent GOP strategist in the last 10 days to suggest
that Watt is hurting Reagan politically.
Fahrenkopf's remarks came on the same day that a
group of environmental leaders stepped up their at
tacks on the interior secretary.
Although praising Watt as a loyalist who has
faithfully followed Reagan's "mandate" at the White
House, Fahrenkopf said in responding to questions at
a press luncheon that "if judged as an asset or a liabil
ity on a scale of 10, he (Watt) would be a liability to
day."
Edward Rollins, Reagan's assistant for political af
fairs, had previously told the Los Angeles Times that

Watt was becoming a political liability and suggested
the secretary might ultimately resign to spare the ad
ministration further damage over its controversial en
vironmental policies.
Despite those statements and even stronger com
ments along similar lines made earlier by several
White House aides who talked to reporters on condi
tion they not be identified, Watt has continued to en
