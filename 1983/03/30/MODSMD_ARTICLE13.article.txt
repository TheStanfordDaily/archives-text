## The
						Stanford Daily See the world: study it here 
### 
A recent geography quiz given to university
students in Florida revealed that the majority of
students tested had a knowledge of the world so
poor they could not locate such places as the
Falkland Islands, India, or even Chicago or
Miami on a map.
Americans are reputed the world over for
their ignorance of other cultures and their in
ability to speak anything but English. In the eyes
of many, it is this cultural chauvinism which is
the source of alleged political and economic
imperialism.
We believe that as the world grows smaller
through technical advances, and as the prob
lems of those overseas increasingly become our
own, it is urgent for Americans generally, and
especially for the "educated," to become more
internationally aware.
We are encouraged by reports of growing
interest at Stanford in international relations
and area studies programs like Soviet and East
European Studies and East Asian Studies. Stu
dent enrollment in first year Russian, for exam
ple, has grown from 30 students last year to 50
this year. Enrollment in a Russian literature sur
vey course has doubled from 12 to 24.
the number of students taking first year
Chinese language classes has been roughly the
same in recent years, remaining level at approx
imately 42, but the number of students taking
first year japanese has increased since last year
from 34 to 50.
The most popular beginning language
courses are in the department of French and
Italian. Enrollment in first year French has in
creased by 40 from last year's level of 516. First
year Italian courses have had a slight decline in
enrollment from 275 last year to 250 this year.
The Stanford Overseas Studies programs are
also worthy of commendation. Among Ameri

can universities, Stanford has one of the most
geographically far reaching systems of overseas
campuses. A significant number of students
here participate in the wide range of courses
and living arrangements these campuses offer.
Although the enactment of a University-wide
foreign language requirement was a step, how
ever small, in the right direction, most Stanford
students remain strictly monolingual. Knowl
edge of such key countries as the Soviet Union
and China remains the possession of a relative
few, most of whom are political science and
international relations majors.
Much more progress needs to be made. Fifty
students studying first year Russian out of 12,000
university students is a shameful percentage. A
far larger number of Soviet students study En
glish. We strongly encourage students to take
courses relating to international affairs and to
pursue the study of foreign languages.
An international outlook should be attained
by all students at Stanford regardless of their
major; we do not believe that the study of other
cultures should be limited to international rela
tions majors or area specialists. The overseas
campuses should continue to expand their of
ferings in the natural sciences and in engineer
ing to allow more students who would other
wise be limited by rigid major requirements to
study abroad. More effort should be made to
bring students at these campuses into direct
contact with the surrounding population and
culture. (A "Farm" type atmosphere should be
avoided as much as possible.)
In the coming decades businessmen and en
gineers will need as much of an awareness of
the world as journalists and politicians. We no
longer live in an isolated country, and we can no
longer afford to educate people from an iso
lated standpoint.
