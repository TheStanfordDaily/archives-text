In Special Bulletin, a made-for-TV
movie aired March 20 on NBC, five
anti-nuclear terrorists threaten to
blow up Charleston, S.C., with a
homemade atomic bomb. They de
mand the triggers from all nuclear
warheads in the Charleston area,
planning to dump them at sea. After
the citv is evacuated, government
forces successfully raid the terrorists'
boat but are unable to disarm the
time-set bomb. Charleston is de
stroyed.
The movie contains much accurate
information about the awesome de
structive power of a nuclear
explosion—a relatively small explo
sion, of the magnitude that de
stroyed Hiroshima. The images of
firestorm and shock wreckage are
convincing and terrifying. Because
such facts and images are not readily
available to the American public,
NBC has done us a disservice in pre
senting them in a grotesquely mislead
ing fiction.
The two terrorist leaders in Special
Bulletin are former government sci
entists turned crazy and violent in
their crusade to stop the arms race.
The anti-nuclear movement—the
real anti-nuclear movement—has
many members in the scientific
community, many of whom have
been with the government. These
men and women, more aware than

most of us of the dangers of nuclear
arms, work peacefully for a nuclear
free world.
The movie's premise, that such
people would employ as blackmail
the very horror they have dedicated
their lives against, is an insult to them
and to the intelligence of the Ameri
can people.
The makers of Special Bulletin take
another cheap shot by clearly model
ling the terrorist ringleader, in ap
pearance and background, after
Daniel Ellsberg. Ellsberg has been
outspoken and active in his opposi
tion to nuclear weapons, but his ac
tions, and the actions of the anti
nuclear movement in general, have
been conscientiously non-violent.
For many of us, his is one of the
sanest voices in the country today.
Nuclear terrorism is a growing
possibility for one major reason: the
United States and the Soviet Union
continue to export nuclear technol
ogy of weapons-generating poten
tial. Despite our responsible talk,
and the non-proliferation treaty,
such nations as Israel, Libya, Iraq,
South Africa, India, and Argentina
have or are developing a nuclear
capability. By the end of the century
Col. Moammar Khadafy of Libya is
likely to have warheads to back up his
bluster. That is the terror, and Special
Bulletin ignores it.

Finally, the movie misleads us in a
more profound way. Nuclear
blackmail, by a band of crazies or a
third-world oligarch or anyone else,
is not the essential problem. The
problem is poised right now in
American and Soviet silos and bom
bers and submarines. It is potentially
far more terrible than anything in
Special Bulletin, and it is ticking to
ward detonation just as surely as the
fictitious bomb in Charleston.
If the warheads are launched, they
will fall not on a single evacuated city
while the rest of us watch on TV.
They will fall on us. Three days later,
we will not be talking of rebuilding.
We will be dead and continuing to
die, our hideous burns and wounds
untreated. Those who survive the
blasts and radiation will have to find a
way to live with the madness that al
lowed the missiles to be buili and to
be used.
Some people at NBC are thinking
about that madness, and I'm very
glad. But it's a matter for clear, in
formative documentaries, not
bizarre features. I hope the networks
find the courage to address it hon
estly and directly. We must think
about the unthinkable in order to
prevent it, and they have the power
to help us do that.
