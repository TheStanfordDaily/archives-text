## Nuclear freeze protects a few 
### 
When I read in the Daily about the
nuclear freeze and disarmament
movement, I think of the Vietnam
fiasco, the socio-economics of the
All-Volunteer Army, and the general
attitude of American society towards
the people in the military. These
thoughts make me believe the horri
ble power of nuclear weapons is a
positive influence for peace which
will force Americans to care about
the people who will serve as casual
ties in war.
The tragedy of 57,000 men killed
and over 300.000 wounded in Viet
nam for nothing was possible be
cause the Selective Service System
selected mainly the poor and the so
cially undesirables as casualties. (For
example, student deferments
excluded most upper-class young
men.) If only a few politically influen
tial people (e.g. congressmen ) were
forced to risk their lives in Vietnam,
America would have either stayed
out of the war or made a full national
commitment to winning a war that it
felt was necessary.
Instead, the people from a politi
cally influential background or
ganized and protested to ensure
their continued non-involvement on
"moral" grounds, while young men
from politically uninfluential back
grounds were sent to die in a no-win
war.
The social injustice of the Selective
Service System was acknowledged
when the lottery draft was enacted.
However, Congress, under political
pressure very similar to the nuclear
freeze movement, created the All-

Volunteer Army. The result is a dis
proportionate percentage of minor
ity members and poorly educated
people forced into service by an im
moral economic induction system.
Under this system, the most worth
less way for a young man to waste his
life is to die for America, because the
people who use him look down on
him socially and feel morally
superior.
The nuclear freeze movement and
disarmament movement attempts to
turn the clock back to a time when
societies sent selected soldiers to
war while the main body remained
reasonably comfortable and intact.
The horrible power of nuclear
weapons prevents this, and effec
tively implements what the politically
influential abhor: a universal,
egalitarian draft.
Americans must now face the ir
reversible fact that everyone wili
share equally in the risks and respon
sibilities of national defense. The re
sult must be a strong national com
mitment to protect the people who
will serve as casualties in war.

Khomeini's help
I never thought it possible that
Americans would be thankful to the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, of all
people. But it seems that his lust for

power and desire to maintain his rule
even surpasses his hatred for Ameri
cans.
How you ask? Well, it is no secret
that the demise of OPEC and the
rapid fall of oil prices would enor
mously benefit the Americans. With
the exception of a few large multina
tional banks, the rest of the economy
stands to benefit, making a strong
economic recovery a distinct possi
bility. And in all this, Khomeini has
played a crucial role. Faced with a
shattered and bankrupt economy,
and in desperate need for hard cur
rency to finance its war with Iraq and
its oppressive military apparatus at
home, the Iranian regime has steadily
increased its oil production and
slashed prices, as low as $20 a barrel
in some cases, to gain market and
increase its revenues.
In a market characterized by slug
gish demand for oil, and given the
lack of accord between major OPEC
producers on production quotas and
prices, the oil prices have started a
downward spiral with no end in
sight. It should be noted that Kho
meini's attempts to "export the re
volution," his insistence to continue
the war with Iraq, and his hatred for
and power struggle with the Saudis
have played a key role in creating the
current turmoil and disunity among
OPEC members.
So you see, we should be really
thankful to Khomeini for a job well
done!
