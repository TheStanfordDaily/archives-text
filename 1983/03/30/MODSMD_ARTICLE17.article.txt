## Love affair with undergrads 
### 
I'm in love. . . with 5000 young people—talented, car
ing, creative, intelligent, good looking, and fun to be
with. No, I haven't broken the news yet to my mom.
I think I have good taste, even if those 5000 include
both men and women, several of whom are under age.
It isn't that I fell in love with them all at once, either, or
picked them all up at a trat party. With some of them, I'll
admit it was love at first sight. Others took a while to get
to know. I had to overcome my own prejudices and
stereotypes in order to appreciate them.
Although I'm not the kind of guy who likes to kiss and
tell, I can't keep it a secret any longer. I'm in love with
5000 Stanford undergraduates.
It was difficult and unusual to do this as a graduate
student. Graduate students don't often want to as
sociate with undergraduates, and vice versa. Many
graduate students think that undergraduates are rich
and spoiled, emotionally shallow, young and foolish,
and primarily interested in parties and sports. They think
of them as Ken and Barbie dolls windsurfing for credit
and zipping around recklessly in expensive cars which
their suburban daddies bought for them. Stereotypes of
graduate students are not much more flattering.
It was worth the time to discover that the stereotypes
are not true. I have met with undergraduates in their
homes in New York, San Diego, Nebraska, Washington
D.C., Oklahoma and Los Angeles. They have taught me
about the places they live, about auto mechanics, pho
tography, great works, sculpture, and several other
things I probably wouldn't have learned on my own.
They have challenged my values, my ways of thinking,
and even the way I interact socially. They have done a
great deal for me, and I hope that maybe somewhere
along the way I gave something in return.
I mention all of this not because I think that the pages
of the Daily need to be filled with stories of peculiar
romance, but because I have found my relationships
with undergraduates to have been special, and I think
that Stanford ought to do more to encourage interaction
between undergraduate and graduate students.
Despite its appearance as a great University where
people of different backgrounds and disciplines con
tinually interact, Stanford is in some ways a series of
separate kingdoms, occupying the same space but invis
ible to each other.
Part of the problem is that disciplines hold tenaciously
to their own autonomy and insularity, believing, in many
cases I think wrongly, that they will produce more by
continuing to specialize, joint degree candidates know
this only too well.
Part of the problem, too, is that much of Stanford life
revolves around other cloistered units: residences. The
close relationships which develop in Stanford houses,
the sense of community and the amount of education
within the residences are truly wonderful things. But
there is one drawback. The'houses do become isolated
and they present social barriers to outsiders. In some

ways, they are obstacles to the interplay of diverse
peoples and ideas which Stanford prides itself on as a
national school and a university.
I raise this issue not only because it seems to be at the
heart of what a University is about, but because I have
met too many students and professionals who lack an
understanding of others and hold an overly narrow view
of their role and their disciplines.
Whether they realize it or not, I think that we are all
worse off for this. Specialization and exclusion fragment
our small community here as well as our larger commu
nity.
In time, perhaps, the University will encourage more
links between the various schools, more graduate stu
dents as Resident Assistants in undergraduate houses,
and other programs to encourage more student interac
tion.

Many graduate students think that
undergraduates are rich and
spoiled, emotionally shallow, young
and foolish, and primarily interested
in parties and sports.

While there are currently several proposals on the
table to further integrate graduate students into under
graduate housing, I would like to support one which has
received little attentioji. .... _. ...
One small suggestion which would help to foster this
beneficial interaction, serve the goals of residential edu
cation and ameliorate some of the bitterness between
graduates and the University over inequalities in housing
policy would be to allow a small number of graduate
students to enter the draw for undergraduate housing
next month.
Every year, the University designates a set number of
spaces for graduate student housing. In fact, several
housing spots—in Crothers, for example—are assigned
by priority to graduate students by stipulation of the will
of the donor.
Without increasing the number of housing spots
available to graduate students, the University could
allow those graduate students who are eligible for Uni
versity housing to renounce their spots in graduate
housing and to enter the draw. Those spots that are
renounced would then be open to everyone in the draw .
This is only one small step, which will probably not
involve many students, but it would be a significant
symbolic gesture toward recognition that we live in a
world where much is to be gained from the intermixing
of people of various ideas and backgrounds.
