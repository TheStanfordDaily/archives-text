# SLAC to cooperate on proposed nuclear weapons research
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) will "cooperate fully"
with a controversial proposal that
would aid in the research of nuclear
weapons at the Stanford Synchrot
ron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) if the
proposal is accepted by SSRL's di
rector, SLAC director Wolfgang
Panofsky asserted in a letter released
yesterday.
In a related development, Physics
Prof. Robert Mozley, a SLAC re
searcher, has submitted a proposal
to the faculty senate in which he asks
the senate's Committee on Research
to review and possibly restrict
weapons-related research here.
Mozley said he was motivated in part
by developments at SLAC and SSRL.
These two developments repre
sent a rise in public debate about the
prospect of nuclear weapons re
search here. The heightened discus
sion comes in the wake of President
Reagan's March 23 televised address
in which he called for a significant
increase in space-based Anti-Ballistic
Missiles (ABM). The proposal at SSRI
would aid in the research for nuclear
weapons-pumped x-ray lasers, one

type of space-based ABM.
Panofsky emphasized, in answer
ing 280 staff members who signed
petitions in January opposing the
proposal, that he did not have the
jurisdiction to tell SSRL how to pro
teed. SSRL is administratively inde
pendent of SLAC but it depends on
the accelerator for its functioning
and staff members at SLAC contri
bute to all research projects at SSRL.
Panofsky also said in an interview
that he could not oppose the pro
posed research at SSRL, despite the
fact that he is "not terribly happy
about the weapons" which would be
researched there, because "it is a
matter of academic freedom."
"As long as a researcher abides by
the rules, the community doesn't
have the authority to tell him what to
do," he said.
Panofsky said he wrote the letter
with the knowledge that the propo
sal would aid in research of space
based Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
systems which he has publicly de
cried.
Panofsky also said the only legal
means he could use to see that the
research does not take place is to
