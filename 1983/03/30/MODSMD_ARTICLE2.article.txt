# SLAC to cooperate on proposed nuclear weapons research
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) will "cooperate fully"
with a controversial proposal that
would aid in the research of nuclear
weapons at the Stanford Synchrot
ron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) if the
proposal is accepted by SSRL's di
rector, SLAC director Wolfgang
Panofsky asserted in a letter released
yesterday.
In a related development, Physics
Prof. Robert Mozley, a SLAC re
searcher, has submitted a proposal
to the faculty senate in which he asks
the senate's Committee on Research
to review and possibly restrict
weapons-related research here.
Mozley said he was motivated in part
by developments at SLAC and SSRL.
These two developments repre
sent a rise in public debate about the
prospect of nuclear weapons re
search here. The heightened discus
sion comes in the wake of President
Reagan's March 23 televised address
in which he called for a significant
increase in space-based Anti-Ballistic
Missiles (ABM). The proposal at SSRI
would aid in the research for nuclear
weapons-pumped x-ray lasers, one

type of space-based ABM.
Panofsky emphasized, in answer
ing 280 staff members who signed
petitions in January opposing the
proposal, that he did not have the
jurisdiction to tell SSRL how to pro
teed. SSRL is administratively inde
pendent of SLAC but it depends on
the accelerator for its functioning
and staff members at SLAC contri
bute to all research projects at SSRL.
Panofsky also said in an interview
that he could not oppose the pro
posed research at SSRL, despite the
fact that he is "not terribly happy
about the weapons" which would be
researched there, because "it is a
matter of academic freedom."
"As long as a researcher abides by
the rules, the community doesn't
have the authority to tell him what to
do," he said.
Panofsky said he wrote the letter
with the knowledge that the propo
sal would aid in research of space
based Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
systems which he has publicly de
cried.
Panofsky also said the only legal
means he could use to see that the
research does not take place is to
terminate the connection between
SLAC and SSRL. He said he did not
even consider this option because,
among other reasons, "SSRL is doing
extraordinarily good science."
Mary James, an engineering physi
cist who circulated the petition
which was eventually signed by the
280 staff members, said, however,
that the "petition hasn't been an
swered."
"Apparently he (Panofsky) didn't
understand what we asked for,"
James said. "We asked him to take a
serious look at constructing guide
lines to protect physicists from
changes such as this. It's tantamount
to switching projects in midstream.
It's an incredible departure from
what the accelerator has done in the
past."
SLAC has been for many years one
of the few places physicists could
work without directly contributing to
weapons research. James claimed in
a past interview that there was a
"tacit agreement" when she came to

work at SLAC that nuclear weapons
related research would not take
place there.
She also said she would be taking
part in research which she considers
"morally unacceptable" if the pro
posal is accepted.
John Harris, an engineer at SLAC
who signed the petition, said he
"wasn't surprised" by Panofsky's let
ter.
"I don't expect anybody to stop
this proposal," he said.
He said, however, that the propo
sal should be stopped somehow.
Motivated by student and faculty
opposition to weapons research, the
University in the early '70s adopted
policies which preclude classified re
search here. Research taking place
under the proposal would not be
classified.
The proposal was developed by
Lawrence Livermore, Sandia and Los
Alamos National Laboratories. It calls
for the construction of two addi
tional beam lines at SSRL which
would primarily aid in non
weapons-related research. Part of
the proposal would, however, aid re
search for nuclear weapons-pumped
x-rav lasers.

SSRL's proposal review panel,
composed of 10 experts outside of
the University, is expected to make a
recommendation to the laboratory's
director, Arthur Bienenstock, within
the next two months. Bienenstock
will make the final decision whether
or not to accept the proposal.
Bienenstock said last night that he
"appreciated" Panofsky's letter and
that he had expected him to cooper
ate with SSRL if Bienenstock decides
to accept the proposal.
Mozley's proposal, which will be
discussed at tomorrow's faculty sen
ate meeting, asks that the Committee
on Research "study the volume and
character of weapons-related re
search at Stanford, and possible
criteria relating to end use which
might be used to reduce the volume
of such research, if this proves desir
able."
"I'm basically asking the commit
tee to take a look at what kind of
weapons research is taking place,"
Mozley said last night. "I'm con
cerned now because there's more
and more funding being devoted to
defense-related work. This could
change the environment on cam
pus."
