# Music Center: rain slows tempo
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Every day thousands of people here see the Braun
Music Center under construction and wonder when it
will be completed The answer: November, Il'B.i1 l '8.i wea
ther permitting.
Although the new music facility adjacent to Din
kelspiel Auditorium was originally slated to open in Au
gust, heavy rain and wind damage—with a little help
from the fall United Stanford Workers' strike—caused a
three month setback.
Since construction began last March, damages in
cluded flooding and even the loss of part of the second
tloor, which was not cemented to the building.
Fortunately for the University, the subcontractors
must pay the extra costs.
But the extra costs seem insignificant in comparison to
the Music Department s long battle for a new building.
Currently housed in the Knoll, the department has been
fighting for a new building since its beginning in 194",
according to John Gilliland, the development officer in
charge of the Braun project. Vet the University continu
ously postponed the plans. That is, until the C arl Braun
Trust donated a substantial portion of the more than $6..i
million needed for the project, Gilliland said. Several
other sources, including the William and Flora Hewlitt
Foundation and the lames Irving Foundation, helped
foot the bill.
"They had plans over a decade ago, and just weren't
able to see where the money would come from, Gilli
land said. "It has been difficult finding people with the
capacity and the interest in helping music at Stanford to
meet the need. We still need almost $1 million . .(and)
the price will just keep going up."
Because the Unversity recognizes the need for a new
music facility to replace the inadequate Knoll, Gilliland
said, "they just bite the bullet." He added. "We'll just
keep working on it."

Most of the Music Department will move from the
Knoll to the Braun Music Center. (The Knoll, built in
1918, was previously the home of former University Pres
ident Wilbur.) But parts of the library, such as the Arc -
hive of Recorded Sound, and some faculty offices, will
probably remain in sections of the Knoll which are not
tilled by the facilities of the Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics which are moving to the
Knoll from its location on Arastradero Road.
According to John Planting, Music Department ad
ministrator, the new facility will house all the academic
ncvds of the department. It will include four classrooms
one large rehearsal hall, faculty offices, teaching studios
and a complete library system rather than a departmen
tal library.
The 9000 square-foot main music library, which will
include 53,000 books and scores and 14,000 recordings
will occupy the largest space in the new facility.
In addition to the library , the new building will inc luck"
faculty offices, four classrooms, a small rehearsal hail
and a 15-piano lab.
The largest classroom, seating r >o, will double as a small
theatre.
Dinkelspiel Auditorium built in 1957, will still serve as
the main performing center.
As for the projected November 198.i move-in, Planting
said, ' We'll move by piecemeal."
"It's been a long, slow road," Planting said of the
planning and construction of the Braun Music Center
The Music Department is small by University stan
dards, consisting of about 100 undergraduate students,
100 graduate students and a dozen tenured music pro
fessors.
Many believed the department suffered because ol
the physical isolation of the Knoll, but hope new interest
will be sparked by the upcoming move.
