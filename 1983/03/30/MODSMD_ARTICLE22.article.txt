# Pauling speaks against nuclear arms
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer SUSAN TUCKER 
The intelligence of the
human race will save the world
from nuclear destruction, ac
cording to Nobel Laureate Dr.
Linus Pauling.
In a speech entitled "Path to
World Peace" given earlier this
month in Me mo rial Au
ditorium, Pauling said the
world could be saved from nu
clear destruction through the
actions of individuals.
The talk focused on the
"immediate danger" of the
arms race. Pauling estimated
that at present there are 50 to
60,000 nuclear warheads in
existence, adding up to bO,OOO
megatons of warheads.
Twenty-megaton warheads are
capable of killing 10 million
people.
Pauling said that the force
and effect of nuclear weaponry
makes a "limited" nuclear war
next to impossible. In a
hypothetical war between the
United States and the Soviet
Union, he explained, a 10 to
15,000 megaton attack and
counterattack would kill 720 of
the 800 million people living in
the United States and the

Soviet Union. The 80 million
survivors of this limited nu
clear war would have to face
the devastating aftereffects of
nuclear radiation as well as the
political chaos resulting from a
major war. This, coupled with
the possible destruction of the
ozone layer, could lead to the
eventual extinction of the
human race.
Treaties which call for a
freeze in arms production are
an important step in combat
ting nuclear aggression, Paul
ing said, but he added that
more than treaties are needed
to prevent nuclear catas
trophe. "Treaties are effective
if they are adhered to," he said,
but added, "Treaties are not
enough." Often, he explained,
so much time is spent develop
ing these treaties that they be
come obsolete before they are
ratified.
Pauling said he felt that the
role of the U.S. government in
the arms race is more detri
mental than the public has
been led to believe. "The
United States has been taking
unilateral action for the past 25
years," Pauling said. "The
problem is that the action has

been in the wrong direction."
The U.S. defense policy, in
stead of centering around the
protection of the American
peoples, has been concerned
largely with staying ahead of
the Russians in the arms race.
"As President Reagan said
last year, we have a new na
tional security directive: to
exploit the weakness of the
Soviets and to prevent them
from threatening the United
States in several spheres,"
Pauling explained. He said that
Reagan had claimed the United
States was involved in a battle
of "Ideals and values against
Marxism," but added that the
U.S. attempt to bankrupt the
USSR had "bankrupted the
United States morally and
spiritually."
"The United States is not fal
ling behind in the arms race,"
Pauling said. "In fact, the
United States has maintained a
five year lead in arms produc
tion." He explained that argu
ments put forth by the gov
ernment such as the "window
of vulnerability" are lies put
forth to rationalize supple
menting the defense budget.
"These unilateral actions

that we are taking," Pauling
said, "are a danger to the
world."
Ignorance to the dangers of
an aggressive arms policy in
the main reason Pauling saw
for the continued U.S. nuclear
buildup. "About half of the
world's population knows
nothing about nuclear
weapons," he said.
Because the United States is
so aggressive in its arms policy,
it is largely up to its govern
ment to initiate a policy of arms
reduction. "I would like to see
the United States, which has
been taking the lead in
militarism, instigate a nuclear

freeze. See if the USSR fol
lows," Pauling said. He ex
plained that it was indeed quite
possible, due to the economic
situation in the USSR, for the
Soviets to begin an arms reduc
tion program to reduce the
strain on their defense budget.
But due to the ignorance of
U.S. citizens, action has not
been and may not be taken.
Pauling concluded by saying
that the stability of world peace
was endangered. "Now, we
must take unprecedented ac
tion to save the world," he
said. "I believe we can save the
world—if everyone does ev
erything he can."

clear destruction through the
actions of individuals.
The talk focused on the
"immediate danger" of the
arms race. Pauling estimated
that at present there are 50 to
60,000 nuclear warheads in
existence, adding up to bO,OOO
megatons of warheads.
Twenty-megaton warheads are
capable of killing 10 million
people.
Pauling said that the force
and effect of nuclear weaponry
makes a "limited" nuclear war
next to impossible. In a
hypothetical war between the
United States and the Soviet
Union, he explained, a 10 to
15,000 megaton attack and
counterattack would kill 720 of
the 800 million people living in
the United States and the

Soviet Union. The 80 million
survivors of this limited nu
clear war would have to face
the devastating aftereffects of
nuclear radiation as well as the
political chaos resulting from a
major war. This, coupled with
the possible destruction of the
ozone layer, could lead to the
eventual extinction of the
human race.
Treaties which call for a
freeze in arms production are
an important step in combat
ting nuclear aggression, Paul
ing said, but he added that
more than treaties are needed
to prevent nuclear catas
trophe. "Treaties are effective
if they are adhered to," he said,
but added, "Treaties are not
enough." Often, he explained,
so much time is spent develop
ing these treaties that they be
come obsolete before they are
ratified.
Pauling said he felt that the
role of the U.S. government in
the arms race is more detri
mental than the public has
been led to believe. "The
United States has been taking
unilateral action for the past 25
years," Pauling said. "The
problem is that the action has

been in the wrong direction."
The U.S. defense policy, in
stead of centering around the
protection of the American
peoples, has been concerned
largely with staying ahead of
the Russians in the arms race.
"As President Reagan said
last year, we have a new na
tional security directive: to
exploit the weakness of the
Soviets and to prevent them
from threatening the United
States in several spheres,"
Pauling explained. He said that
Reagan had claimed the United
States was involved in a battle
of "Ideals and values against
Marxism," but added that the
U.S. attempt to bankrupt the
USSR had "bankrupted the
United States morally and
spiritually."
"The United States is not fal
ling behind in the arms race,"
Pauling said. "In fact, the
United States has maintained a
five year lead in arms produc
tion." He explained that argu
ments put forth by the gov
ernment such as the "window
of vulnerability" are lies put
forth to rationalize supple
menting the defense budget.
"These unilateral actions

that we are taking," Pauling
said, "are a danger to the
world."
Ignorance to the dangers of
an aggressive arms policy in
the main reason Pauling saw
for the continued U.S. nuclear
buildup. "About half of the
world's population knows
nothing about nuclear
weapons," he said.
Because the United States is
so aggressive in its arms policy,
it is largely up to its govern
ment to initiate a policy of arms
reduction. "I would like to see
the United States, which has
been taking the lead in
militarism, instigate a nuclear

freeze. See if the USSR fol
lows," Pauling said. He ex
plained that it was indeed quite
possible, due to the economic
situation in the USSR, for the
Soviets to begin an arms reduc
tion program to reduce the
strain on their defense budget.
But due to the ignorance of
U.S. citizens, action has not
been and may not be taken.
Pauling concluded by saying
that the stability of world peace
was endangered. "Now, we
must take unprecedented ac
tion to save the world," he
said. "I believe we can save the
world—if everyone does ev
erything he can."
