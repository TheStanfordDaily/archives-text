## Kunkel follows his father to top 
### 
About the time Kevin and
Jeff Kunkel came to the
realization that they loved
to play baseball, they ea
gerly entrusted their future
to their father William.
William Kunkel was a
former major league
pitcher, who loved the
game enough to hang
around and become an
American League umpire,
which probably says some
thing about his feelings to-
The Sporting Muse
ward the game. His feelings
were one thing he didn't
have to teach his sons.
"I started practicing be
fore I remember. I was
probably four or five years
old," said Kevin, a Stanford
freshman, who improved
his pitching record to 4-0
Friday. "Our dad was a
pitcher so ever since we
were small, he talked to us
about pitching. It's not like
he forced us, though. We
both just loved the game
and always played."
But William Kunkel made
sure the boys maintained a
grip on the basics before
they got too involved with
the game.
"We had a (pitching) rub
ber and a home plate in our

backyard," Kevin said. "We
worked mainly on funda
mentals. For years, we just
worked around the
mound."
The path from these fun
damental beginnings to
promising college careers
was not typical sandlot glory
stuff. The backyard
diamond was located in the
baseball hotbed of
Leonardo, N.J. From there,
Kevin moved up to the
Moeller High of baseball —
Lawrenceville (N.J.) Prep,
and finally to Stanford.
These modest beginnings
did not make Kevin a high
draft choice, or even one at
all. But that's OK.
"I wasn't drafted out of
high school," Kunkel said.
"When I got the chance to
go to Stanford, I couldn't
pass it up. I think the scouts
knew that."
Kevin Kunkel is the
youngest of William and
Maxine's three children.
Jeff is a junior at Rider Col
lege where he is batting .592
as a shortstop and, accord
ing to brother Kevin, "might
be a No.l prospect."Kevin,
18, is the only freshman on a
strong Stanford pitching
staff.
This striving toward
achievement is not a coinci

dence, it is one of the fun
damental things William
Kunkel taught his children.
Three weeks ago, William
Kunkel underwent his sec
ond major operation for
cancer of the colon. The
cancer showed up again
after his first operation one
and-a-half years ago.
Now, William Kunkel is
on the road visiting his son
Kevin at Stanford. Kevin
said, "He's doing great."
William Kunkel's doctor
said he had never seen any
one heal as fast. Within a
month, he plans to be out at
the parks again, calling em
as he sees 'em.
Kevin is using all of his
time to learn more about
the art of pitching. Being the
only freshman, Kunkel en
joys lots of advice from the
older pitchers.
"Everyone helps each
other out," Kunkel said.
"I'm the only freshman so
they help me out a lot. Like
between innings, Brian
(Myers) was next to me talk
ing to me the whole time.
"I like to listen to the
coaches, too. They're pretty
smart. They know what
they're doing."
So far, Kunkel has known
what he has been doing,

too. In Tucson, Ariz., the
Cardinal was struggling in
the late innings of a game
against Arizona and the
Cardinal bullpen was find
ing the strike zone elusive.
But Kunkel came in, threw
strikes and ended the game.
Later, Stanford coach
Mark Marquess admitted he
knew of Kunkel's talent, but
wanted "to bring him along
slowly." But that's OK.
"I'm happy with the
amount of chances I've
had," Kunkel said. "This is a
tough staff for a freshman to
try and break into. I'm satis
fied with relief work. My
goal is to be a starter, but
right now I've got a lot of
work to do. I've got a
fastball and I'm getting com
fortable with my slider, but
I'm still working on a cur
veball and a change-up
every day in practice."
Kunkel is undefeated as a
college baseball pitcher,
but he is quick not to draw
any conclusions about his
future.
"Except for one start, I've
been coming into games
where it is close or tied,"
Kunkel explained. "Every
time I've pitched, these
guys have come through. I'll
just have to wait some more
to see how good I am."

after his first operation one
and-a-half years ago.
Now, William Kunkel is
on the road visiting his son
Kevin at Stanford. Kevin
said, "He's doing great."
William Kunkel's doctor
said he had never seen any
one heal as fast. Within a
month, he plans to be out at
the parks again, calling em
as he sees 'em.
Kevin is using all of his
time to learn more about
the art of pitching. Being the
only freshman, Kunkel en
joys lots of advice from the
older pitchers.
"Everyone helps each
other out," Kunkel said.
"I'm the only freshman so
they help me out a lot. Like
between innings, Brian
(Myers) was next to me talk
ing to me the whole time.
"I like to listen to the
coaches, too. They're pretty
smart. They know what
they're doing."
So far, Kunkel has known
what he has been doing,

too. In Tucson, Ariz., the
Cardinal was struggling in
the late innings of a game
against Arizona and the
Cardinal bullpen was find
ing the strike zone elusive.
But Kunkel came in, threw
strikes and ended the game.
Later, Stanford coach
Mark Marquess admitted he
knew of Kunkel's talent, but
wanted "to bring him along
slowly." But that's OK.
"I'm happy with the
amount of chances I've
had," Kunkel said. "This is a
tough staff for a freshman to
try and break into. I'm satis
fied with relief work. My
goal is to be a starter, but
right now I've got a lot of
work to do. I've got a
fastball and I'm getting com
fortable with my slider, but
I'm still working on a cur
veball and a change-up
every day in practice."
Kunkel is undefeated as a
college baseball pitcher,
but he is quick not to draw
any conclusions about his
future.
"Except for one start, I've
been coming into games
where it is close or tied,"
Kunkel explained. "Every
time I've pitched, these
guys have come through. I'll
just have to wait some more
to see how good I am."
About the time Kevin and
Jeff Kunkel came to the
realization that they loved
to play baseball, they ea
gerly entrusted their future
to their father William.
William Kunkel was a
former major league
pitcher, who loved the
game enough to hang
around and become an
American League umpire,
which probably says some
thing about his feelings to-
The Sporting Muse
ward the game. His feelings
were one thing he didn't
have to teach his sons.
"I started practicing be
fore I remember. I was
probably four or five years
old," said Kevin, a Stanford
freshman, who improved
his pitching record to 4-0
Friday. "Our dad was a
pitcher so ever since we
were small, he talked to us
about pitching. It's not like
he forced us, though. We
both just loved the game
and always played."
But William Kunkel made
sure the boys maintained a
grip on the basics before
they got too involved with
the game.
"We had a (pitching) rub
ber and a home plate in our

backyard," Kevin said. "We
worked mainly on funda
mentals. For years, we just
worked around the
mound."
The path from these fun
damental beginnings to
promising college careers
was not typical sandlot glory
stuff. The backyard
diamond was located in the
baseball hotbed of
Leonardo, N.J. From there,
Kevin moved up to the
Moeller High of baseball —
Lawrenceville (N.J.) Prep,
and finally to Stanford.
These modest beginnings
did not make Kevin a high
draft choice, or even one at
all. But that's OK.
"I wasn't drafted out of
high school," Kunkel said.
"When I got the chance to
go to Stanford, I couldn't
pass it up. I think the scouts
knew that."
Kevin Kunkel is the
youngest of William and
Maxine's three children.
Jeff is a junior at Rider Col
lege where he is batting .592
as a shortstop and, accord
ing to brother Kevin, "might
be a No.l prospect."Kevin,
18, is the only freshman on a
strong Stanford pitching
staff.
This striving toward
achievement is not a coinci

dence, it is one of the fun
damental things William
Kunkel taught his children.
Three weeks ago, William
Kunkel underwent his sec
ond major operation for
cancer of the colon. The
cancer showed up again
after his first operation one
and-a-half years ago.
