## Kenney and his swimmers get no respect 
### 
Indianapolis — It was the team that
wasn't supposed to win but always did.
Almost like a young kid disobeying his
mother.
However, Stanford's men's swim team
finally followed orders last week. It was
told not to win the NCAA Men's Swim
ming and Diving Championships last
weekend here and it didn't.
Coach Skip Kenney, now that it's all
over, must feel like Rodney Dangerfield
—the man who gets no respect.
His Cardinal team had done everything
necessary and more to gain the status of a
legitimate contender in the three-day
meet that would decide the national
championship.
The whole mess started Jan. 30 in Au
stin, Texas, in a pool recognized across
America as one of the nation's fastest.
Stanford swimmers were to take on the
University of Texas' No. I ranked swim
team in a dual meet. They were supposed
to lose, but they didn't. When the waters
had subsided, the Cardinal was on top,
58-55.
With the upset, especially since it was
in the Longhorns' home pool, Stanford
had a legitimate claim at the No. 1 rank
ing. Right? Not a chance.
Instead, the top spot went to UCLA — a
team Stanford was conveniently sched
uled to face at deGuerre Pool Feb. 4, just

five days after the meet with UT. If the
Bruins beat Stanford at Stanford, it would
prove what most of the country believed
— the Card's victory over Texas was a
fluke.
But Kenney and company made the ex
perts eat their words, convincingly crush
ing the Bruins 66-47 before a sizable de-
Guerre crowd. A day later, Stanford was
at it again, defeating another swim
power, USC, bu the same score.
Still no respect. Two weeks after the
USC meet, Stanford was scheduled to
take on rival UC-Berkeley at Cal's pool.
Certainly there was no way in hell the
Cardinal would beat the highly-touted
Bears, who were at that time many
people's No. 1 team.
Again, the Stanford swimmers weren't
supposed to defeat Cal, but they dis
obeyed orders and went ahead and won.
Next on the Cardinal's agenda was the
Pacific-10 Conference Championships, a
title Stanford hoped to successfully de
fend at East Los Angeles College. They
did, outscoring second place Cal by
nearly 100 points.
In the course of three weeks, the Stan

ford athletes had played giant killer three
times, completing the dual meet season
with a perfect 7-0 record. They had also
won the conference championship of the
Pac-10, the nation's best swimming con
ference from top to bottom.
By this time, though, a few coaches had
opened their eyes and recognized Stan
ford's legitimacy. The College Swimming
Coaches Association, in fact, was kind
enough to rank the Cardinal second in
their final ratings before the NCAA
Championships March 24-26 at In
dianapolis. But they ranked Texas first, a
team Stanford beat six weeks earlier in
the Longhorns' home pool.
So Kenney and his Cardinal swimming
and diving squad departed for Indy with
hopes of getting the long-overdue re
spect owed them by the swimming world.
A win at Indy would do the trick.
On the Wednesday before the start of
the competition, host Indiana University
held a pre-meet press conference in their
luxurious Champions Club in the base
ment of their tennis complex, home ot
the annual U.S. Clay Court Champion
ships.

Kenney came to the press conference
as a professional. He wore a coat and tie.
The media and other coaches in atten
dance wore dressy shirts, but no coats
and no ties. Kenney brought his four top
swimmers — Dave Bottom, John Moffet,
John Simons and Dave Sims — to the con
ference. They, too, wore coats and ties.
Kenney and his quartet of star swim
mers left theconference having said liter
ally nothing to the media. The answer was
simple. The reporters, not having fol
lowed collegiate swimming all season,
had read the NCAA Championships pro
gram. In it was a four-page preview of the
meet written by Swimming World's Bill
Bell.
The preview, sure enough, mentioned
Stanford and its chances. A total of three
paragraphs were about Stanford. The
story contained 66 paragraphs. And the
mention of Stanford was on page 44. The
program was 46 pages long.
Less than 24 hours before the start of
the NCAA, any and all hopes that Stan
ford had at least begun to get the respect
it deserved were dashed at a 45 minute
press conference.

So, in essence, the Cardinal swimmers
and divers were told they weren't going
to win the national championship, a feat
well within their realm of athletic ability.
They weren't supposed to win . . . and
they didn't.
Finally, in their last chance of the 1982-
83 season to do as told, Kenney and his
team obeyed orders. In fact, they fol
lowed them so well that they didn't live
up to their No. 2 ranking and finished in
fourth, well back of the leaders.
But Kenney and company will he back
next year. Only one member of this sea
son's team is lost — senior freestyler Bari
Weick. And, if things go right, Kenney
could pick up two of the top recruits in
the nation
Kenney and company will be back in
other ways, too. They will be more expe
rienced, both in the water and in the
mind. They have learned not to listen to
what others say and learned not to obey
orders.
Once again, they'll not only be told
they can't win the NCAA title. They'll be
told not to win, either.
But they can win the NCAA title in 1984
and they will. And then all those people
who all along doubted their chances will
come in droves to Kenney and his team to
congratulate them. And Kenney and his
team will tell them to go to hell.
