# University to give financial aid to non-registrants
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Those who failed to register for the draft and
need financial aid have some good news from
Stanford, some bad news from other institu
tions, and a helping hand from some Min
nesota students.
The Solomon Amendment, a provision in
ine De'ense Authorization Act which denies
federal financial aid to students who tiave not
registered for the draft, is slated to go into
effect July 6. Under the Solomon Amendment,
Stanford students who are non-registrants be
come ineligible for Federal financial aid — but

they need not despair. According to John
Schwartz, University legal counsel and vice
president, the University will continue its pol
icy of providing additional private aid loans to
students denied or refused federal funds.
"Stanford is not changing the existing pol
icy," Schwartz said, "because there seems to
be no need to change." He stressed that al
though funds would be available to replace
government loans, these private loans were
more costly to students.
Schwartz said that though the Solomon
Amendment would not be considered specif
ically when the Financial Aids Office plans the

budget, he felt that additional students could
be handled with the existing funds. The Uni
versity does not plan to increase the pool of
money from which the loans are made, accord
ing to Schwartz.
Vincent De Anda, associate director of the
Financial Aids office, said that the Solomon
Amendment would probably cause more stu
dents to compete for Stanford loans, but he
did not believe this would create a shortage of
funds.
"Every year we meet and decide how large
the budget will be; we anticipate the needs of
the students," he said. "The financial aid pool

increases each year."
De Anda also said that University President
Donald Kennedy was very negative about the
Solomon Amendment. "While it was being de
liberated, Kennedy wrote a letter explaining
that the law was a huge administrative bur
den," De Anda said, referring to the fact that
the government has requested universities to
collect Selective Service letters from students
to assure their eligibility for federal loans.
"Also, Kennedy felt that the law had limited
enforcement — only students who need finan
cial aid are implicated, meaning that wealthy


John Schwartz
students don't have to worry about
registering for the draft," he said.
Stanford's decision to provide
existing private funds for non
registrants mirrors that of many in
stitutions reacting to the amend
ment. But some schools, such as Bos
ton University, have announced that
they will deny non-registrants all fi
nancial aid, public and private.
Others, such as Brown, have decided
that they will give these students only
as much private aid as they would
have received had they gotten fed
eral loans. Students applying to
these schools will feel the full, in
tended effect of the Solomon
Amendment.
But the amendment has not yet
become untangled from a myriad Of
legal and administrative snags — the
most prominent of which is a Min
nesota court case,lohn Doe vs Selec
tive Service System.
According to Alan Schlosser of the
American Civil Liberties Union, six
Minnesota students, identifying
themselves as "John Does" and rep
resenting the Minnesota Public

Interest Research Croup, challenged
the amendment, calling it uncon
stitutional. They claimed that in re
vealing to universities that they were
non-registrants they were incriminat
ing themselves. The judge ruled on
March 9 that the amendment could
not be affected until the court case
was finished, and since no decision
has yet been reached, there is a
chance that the Solomon Amend
ment will be unable to assume its
scheduled enactment this summer.
lanet Hook, a reporter for the
American Chronicle on Higher Edu
cation, said that she thought the Sol
omon Amendment would eventually
become official, but that there would
be a long administrative battle and
regulations in the amendment would
be altered.
For example, she said the univer
sities would not be required to col
lect Selective Service letters for at
least the first two years of the
amendment, so that students and
universities would have time to pre
pare for the extra administrative bur
den. She added that the bill had re
ceived strong student opposition,
including a lobby of several
thousand students in Washington
about one month ago.

resenting the Minnesota Public

Interest Research Croup, challenged
the amendment, calling it uncon
stitutional. They claimed that in re
vealing to universities that they were
non-registrants they were incriminat
ing themselves. The judge ruled on
March 9 that the amendment could
not be affected until the court case
was finished, and since no decision
has yet been reached, there is a
chance that the Solomon Amend
ment will be unable to assume its
scheduled enactment this summer.
lanet Hook, a reporter for the
American Chronicle on Higher Edu
cation, said that she thought the Sol
omon Amendment would eventually
become official, but that there would
be a long administrative battle and
regulations in the amendment would
be altered.
For example, she said the univer
sities would not be required to col
lect Selective Service letters for at
least the first two years of the
amendment, so that students and
universities would have time to pre
pare for the extra administrative bur
den. She added that the bill had re
ceived strong student opposition,
including a lobby of several
thousand students in Washington
about one month ago.
