# University to give financial aid to non-registrants
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Those who failed to register for the draft and
need financial aid have some good news from
Stanford, some bad news from other institu
tions, and a helping hand from some Min
nesota students.
The Solomon Amendment, a provision in
ine De'ense Authorization Act which denies
federal financial aid to students who tiave not
registered for the draft, is slated to go into
effect July 6. Under the Solomon Amendment,
Stanford students who are non-registrants be
come ineligible for Federal financial aid — but

they need not despair. According to John
Schwartz, University legal counsel and vice
president, the University will continue its pol
icy of providing additional private aid loans to
students denied or refused federal funds.
"Stanford is not changing the existing pol
icy," Schwartz said, "because there seems to
be no need to change." He stressed that al
though funds would be available to replace
government loans, these private loans were
more costly to students.
Schwartz said that though the Solomon
Amendment would not be considered specif

budget, he felt that additional students could
be handled with the existing funds. The Uni
versity does not plan to increase the pool of
money from which the loans are made, accord

Vincent De Anda, associate director of the
Financial Aids office, said that the Solomon
Amendment would probably cause more stu
dents to compete for Stanford loans, but he
did not believe this would create a shortage of
funds.
"Every year we meet and decide how large
the budget will be; we anticipate the needs of
the students," he said. "The financial aid pool

increases each year."
De Anda also said that University President
Donald Kennedy was very negative about the
Solomon Amendment. "While it was being de
liberated, Kennedy wrote a letter explaining
that the law was a huge administrative bur
den," De Anda said, referring to the fact that
the government has requested universities to
collect Selective Service letters from students
to assure their eligibility for federal loans.
"Also, Kennedy felt that the law had limited
enforcement — only students who need finan
cial aid are implicated, meaning that wealthy
