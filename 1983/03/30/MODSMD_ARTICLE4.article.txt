# Proposal would simplify bio-tech patent license
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
A proposal designed to simplify
the way patents are licensed by uni
versities to biotechnology com
panies could dramatically ease prob
lems faced by institutions and indus
try in negotiating agreements.
The licensing plan, introduced by
Niels Reimers, director of the Uni
versity's office of technology licens
ing and Robert Ditzel, patent ad
ministrator for the University of
California, has raised interest among
universities. However, none have of
ficially endorsed the idea yet.
The concept would enable com
panies to "one-stop-shop" for pat
ents by streamlining unnecessary
transactions between companies
and universities. The plan would
"pool" university patents and license
them to a non-profit foundation.
The foundation, tentatively called
the University Licensing Association
for Biotechnology (ULAB), would act
as a clearinghouse for
"biotechnological tools" patented
by participating universities.
A biotechnological tool is a tech
nique used in the making of genet
ically engineered microorganisms,
which are used in turn to produce
industrial products.
The technology handled by ULAB
would involve specific biological
tools, rather than entire processes,
Reimers said. "This is unique be
cause we're talking about things

done only once — steps that begin
and end in the test-tube."
According to Reimers, the concept
has raised more questions than it has
answered. Specifically, industry
leaders have expressed concern that
the proposal would violate U.S. an
titrust regulations.
In addition, it is unclear whether
universities would be willing to con
tribute their best patents. Schools
would have to offer all of their pat
ents on biotechnology techniques
for the idea to work, he said.
In response to whether or not the
idea is worth pursuing, Reimers ac
knowledged that "this is still the key
question."
Stanford, the University of
California, and reportedly, Harvard
and other universities have refrained
from leasing negotiations involving
gene-splicing patents in order to see
if the proposal would attract industry
support.
"The problem is who will pick the
concept up from here," Reimers
said. "What we need at this point is
some entrepreneurial effort."
If a research corporation expresses
further interest in the idea and
comes up with a solid proposal, the
concept could be realized.
In any event, the proposal is one
alternative to the two choices cur
rently facing industries — negotiat
ing individually with universities, or
using the technique regardless of
