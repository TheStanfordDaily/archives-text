# Grad minority enrollment falls, but faculty appointments rise

### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
Two different affirmative action
reports to be presented at tomor
row's faculty staff meeting indicate
mixed results for affirmative action at
the University. One details a severe
drop in the enrollment of minority
students in graduate and profes
sional schools, while the other
shows a seemingly contradictory in
crease in tenure-track appointments

of women and minorities for
academic year 1981-82.
According to a report on graduate
student affirmative action, new en
rollments of minority students fell 42
percent last fall, while the number of
minority applicants to graduate and
professional programs decreased
from 1593 in 1981 to 1486 in 1982.
However, 18 women and 11 minor
ity group members, representing

approximately 38 percent of new
faculty appointments, joined the
faculty during the 1981-82 academic
year. This put tenure-track appoint
ments for minorities at a 10-year
high.
Reasons for the dip in minority
graduate student enrollment are un
clear, according to Keith Naylor, as
sistant dean of the Graduate Divi
