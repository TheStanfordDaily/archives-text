# Grad minority enrollment falls, but faculty appointments rise
## 
### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
Two different affirmative action
reports to be presented at tomor
row's faculty staff meeting indicate
mixed results for affirmative action at
the University. One details a severe
drop in the enrollment of minority
students in graduate and profes
sional schools, while the other
shows a seemingly contradictory in
crease in tenure-track appointments

of women and minorities for
academic year 1981-82.
According to a report on graduate
student affirmative action, new en
rollments of minority students fell 42
percent last fall, while the number of
minority applicants to graduate and
professional programs decreased
from 1593 in 1981 to 1486 in 1982.
However, 18 women and 11 minor
ity group members, representing

approximately 38 percent of new
faculty appointments, joined the
faculty during the 1981-82 academic
year. This put tenure-track appoint
ments for minorities at a 10-year
high.
Reasons for the dip in minority
graduate student enrollment are un
clear, according to Keith Naylor, as
sistant dean of the Graduate Divi
sion. Naylor suggested that the drop
in minority graduate enrollments
may be a shadow cast by a weak eco
nomy. "The best explanation I can
give is that the economic situation,
or students' perception of the eco
nomic situation and the relative
value of investing in graduate
education) had an effect on the
number of applicants," said Naylor.
Naylor added that preliminary re
search shows lower numbers of
minority applications and enroll
ments at other universities as well.
Naylor emphasized, however, that
the decrease did not reflect a di
minished recruiting effort by the

University. "As a matter of fact, we
had the most comprehensive minor
ity outreach program we've ever had
the year the number of applications
went down," said Naylor. "The re
sults may not always reflect this ef
fort, but it is constantly increasing."
While reasons for the decrease in
minority student enrollment last year
are unclear, causes for the upswing
in minority appointments to faculty
positions may be more clear. Cecilia
Burciaga, assistant provost, credits
the rise to efforts to recruit
minorities in general, and to changes
which are offering women in particu
lar greater opportunities.
"The increased number of ap
pointments is partly because we are
finding a more and more sizable ap
plication pool as more women be

come highly-competitive. More
women are in the pipelines now,"
said Burciaga. "Also, the University
has recognized a need for diversity.
The report states that 9.4 percent
of the tenure-line faculty here are
women. In 1977, women accounted
for only 8 percent of this pool. And
minorities, now comprising 7.3 per
cent of the tenure-line faculty, made
up only 6.7 percent of it.
Burciaga underscored the remain
ing differences between opportunity
for women and for other minorities
seeking tenured positions here.
However, she said, "Women and
minorities have very different his
tories now. We're seeing a critical
mass of women in faculty positions
be developed. You're seeing women
in non-traditional fields, such as en

gineering and sciences," said Bur
ciaga. She emphasized that for
women the concern is that of making
sure women are allowed further ad
vancements or granted tenure.
"But for minorities, we don't yet
have a critical mass of tenure-track
appointments," explained Burciaga.
The University must strive to in
crease this pool, she added.
Naylor also emphasized that
women and other minority groups
should be treated as separate issues.
"The number of women in graduate
positions has steadily increased
here," he said.
The number of female applicants
did increase in 1981, to 6898 from
6852 the year before, according to
the graduate student affirmative ac
