# Croup draws, returning residents affected
## Housing committee revises lottery system 
### JANE McCONNELL Staff writer 
A limit on returning residence claims and a
new policy to keep students who draw together
from being split up are two of the changes which
will affect this year's spring draw scheduled to
take place April 19 through 22.
"In effect, groups who draw together will be
almost guaranteed being assigned together,"
said Louis Friedman, head of the Committee on
Student Services-Residences which formulated
the changes.
Also under the new system, returning resi
dence claims will be limited to one year only.
Under the current system, residents of a particu
lar house may claim returning residence for the
following year and be guaranteed a spot.
The new rule will prevent students who
choose their sophomore year as their unguaran

teed year — but draw well enough to be assigned
to a highly-desirable residence that year — from
remaining there for three years.
According to Roger Whitney, director of hous
ing for residential education, students have
complained that under the old draw system,
those who draw into a desirable residence can
keep going back there, while students who draw
poorly are doomed for the next three years.
The returning residence system was the major
area examined in the proposed draw changes
recommended by the Committee on Student
Services-Residences.
According to Friedman, an assistant professor
at the Medical School, there was a need to strike
a balance between the benefits and disadvan
tages of the returning residence system.
"On one hand we want houses to have more
continuity to retain the same friends from year to

year and become a place you call home, but on
the other hand we want greater equity in the
draw, so that all have a fair chance to get a good
assignment," he said.
According to Whitney, "since most students
only daim returning residence once and since
the majority of the spaces in most houses turn
over anyway, it's really more of a clarification
than a change."
Currently, the average returning residence
rate in all houses is around 30 percent, with the
highest last year being l ambda Nu, with 46 per
cent.
The other major issue considered was the
problem of students who draw together being
split up. This year, groups who get split up in the
draw can petition to remain together, and over
the summer every effort will be made to get them
