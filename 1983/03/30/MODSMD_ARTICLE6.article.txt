# Croup draws, returning residents affected
## Housing committee revises lottery system 
### JANE McCONNELL Staff writer 
A limit on returning residence claims and a
new policy to keep students who draw together
from being split up are two of the changes which
will affect this year's spring draw scheduled to
take place April 19 through 22.
"In effect, groups who draw together will be
almost guaranteed being assigned together,"
said Louis Friedman, head of the Committee on
Student Services-Residences which formulated
the changes.
Also under the new system, returning resi
dence claims will be limited to one year only.
Under the current system, residents of a particu
lar house may claim returning residence for the
following year and be guaranteed a spot.
The new rule will prevent students who
choose their sophomore year as their unguaran

teed year — but draw well enough to be assigned
to a highly-desirable residence that year — from
remaining there for three years.
According to Roger Whitney, director of hous
ing for residential education, students have
complained that under the old draw system,
those who draw into a desirable residence can
keep going back there, while students who draw
poorly are doomed for the next three years.
The returning residence system was the major
area examined in the proposed draw changes
recommended by the Committee on Student
Services-Residences.
According to Friedman, an assistant professor
at the Medical School, there was a need to strike
a balance between the benefits and disadvan
tages of the returning residence system.
"On one hand we want houses to have more
continuity to retain the same friends from year to

year and become a place you call home, but on
the other hand we want greater equity in the
draw, so that all have a fair chance to get a good
assignment," he said.
According to Whitney, "since most students
only daim returning residence once and since
the majority of the spaces in most houses turn
over anyway, it's really more of a clarification
than a change."
Currently, the average returning residence
rate in all houses is around 30 percent, with the
highest last year being l ambda Nu, with 46 per
cent.
The other major issue considered was the
problem of students who draw together being
split up. This year, groups who get split up in the
draw can petition to remain together, and over
the summer every effort will be made to get them
back together. The group can request either to
be put together in their lower priority choice or
can attempt to move up into their higher priority
choice.
Other modifications in the draw include prior
ity changes for groups drawing in Manzanita Park
and the suites. Manzanita Park will be mainly a
graduate residence limited to three people per
trailer, with a four-person option available at re
duced rates.
Room and board rates will be modified to cor
rect discrepancies, based on the services each
house provides.
In addition to these changes, there will be a
separate draw held for graduate students in May.
Besides Manzanita Park and existing graduate
residences, 44 spaces in the co-ops will be open

ing up for graduate students.
"The co-ops have had a hard time filling up,
and graduate students have expressed an inter
est in that option," said Whitney.
Round one and two procedures have been
clarified and now stress that unless students ac
cept their round one assignments or drop out of
the draw completely, they are automatically en
tered in round two of the draw and can keep
moving up from there.
The opening up of Sterling quadrangle will add
360 new spaces to the draw. The four houses —
Potter, Schiff, Adams and Robinson —will prob
ably each have a special program, such as an
intellectual theme, and will instate the new food
service plan.
All of these changes and clarifications in the
draw are detailed in the drawbook, which will be
available next week. Open houses and informa
tional meetings will be held at various campus
residence halls from April 11 to 18.

Several alternatives were considered when
formulating this year's changes. One proposal
was for a cap on the percentage of spaces avail
able to returning residents in each house.
Another alternative was to have students rank
their years in order, and then according to their
ranking for that particular year, draw from one of
four boxes which would include only the num
bers from one to 1500 or from 1500 to 2500 and so
on.
Other future changes are also being consid
ered. The impact of the new housing on the
system is currently being studied by the Commit
tee on Residential Education, and further big
changes are in store for next year, according to
Friedman.
"What we've done this year is just a stepping
stone to greater changes in the system," said
Friedman. "There are a lot of problems with the
draw, and we're trying to correct these while still
preserving its best aspects."
