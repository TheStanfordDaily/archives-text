U.S. makes new arms proposal
Washington — The United States yesterday gave the
Soviet Union a compromise proposal to limit mid
range nuclear missiles in Europe, but President Rea
gan stressed again that his "ultimate goal" is to
eliminate all such weapons.
Reagan, in an exchange with a half-dozen reporters
in the Oval Office, said he would meet today with al
lied ambassadors to discuss the new proposal with
them and then give a formal, public explanation. Ad
ministration officials said the proposal was presented
by the U.S. negotiator at Geneva, Switzerland, to his
Soviet counterpart before the deadlocked talks on
European missiles adjourned until mid-May.
A statement by Reagan of a U.S. willingness to ne
gotiate an interim agreement to permit both sides

equal numbers of warheads on their European missile
arsenals had been expected this week. Letters from
Reagan to North Atlantic Treaty Organization mem
bers, disclosed in part at NATO headquarters in Brus
sels early this week, informed them that the new pro
posal would be presented in Geneva by Paul Nitze,
the U.S. negotiator, before yesterday's scheduled ad
journment.
Officials speaking privately to reporters have sug
gested that Nitze's proposal and Reagan's expected
presentation of it today would contain no precise
numbers of warheads. Instead, they said, the adminis
tration intends to invite the Soviets to consider a
partial dismantling of their 351 triple-warhead SS-20
missiles in return for a scaling-down of NATO plans to
deploy 108 Pershing 2 and 464 cruise missiles begin

ning in December.
Jordan asked to join talks
Amman, Jordan — The Reagan administration has
promised King Hussein it will act to attain a freeze of
the rapidly spreading Jewish settlements on the Is
raeli-occupied West Bank if he declares that he in
tends to join Middle East peace negotiations, accord
ing to Jordanian officials and Western diplomats here.
American diplomats have also signaled a willing
ness to accept expelled West Bank mayors as Palesti
nian representatives in a joint Jordanian-Palestinian
negotiating team, the sources said. The United States
refuses to deal directly with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
Among supporters of Reagan's initiative, there was

hope that Saudi Arabia would back the plan. Hussein
has indicated that Saudi backing, along with that of
the PLO, is essential for him to enter the peace nego
tiations.
Much of the anxiety here has found its focus in
growing expressions of doubt about the U.S. role in
the Middle East. Newspaper editorials and columns
question American will and desire to mediate any
peace settlement that would not be humiliating to the
Arabs.
Much of the commentary suggests that Hussein will
decline to join negotiations unless the United States
provides ironclad assurances that it will act forcefully
to halt West Bank settlements.
