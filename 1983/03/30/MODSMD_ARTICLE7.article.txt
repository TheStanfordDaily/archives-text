U.S. makes new arms proposal
Washington — The United States yesterday gave the
Soviet Union a compromise proposal to limit mid
range nuclear missiles in Europe, but President Rea
gan stressed again that his "ultimate goal" is to
eliminate all such weapons.
Reagan, in an exchange with a half-dozen reporters
in the Oval Office, said he would meet today with al
lied ambassadors to discuss the new proposal with
them and then give a formal, public explanation. Ad
ministration officials said the proposal was presented
by the U.S. negotiator at Geneva, Switzerland, to his
Soviet counterpart before the deadlocked talks on
European missiles adjourned until mid-May.
A statement by Reagan of a U.S. willingness to ne
gotiate an interim agreement to permit both sides

equal numbers of warheads on their European missile
arsenals had been expected this week. Letters from
Reagan to North Atlantic Treaty Organization mem
bers, disclosed in part at NATO headquarters in Brus
sels early this week, informed them that the new pro
posal would be presented in Geneva by Paul Nitze,
the U.S. negotiator, before yesterday's scheduled ad
journment.
Officials speaking privately to reporters have sug
gested that Nitze's proposal and Reagan's expected
presentation of it today would contain no precise
numbers of warheads. Instead, they said, the adminis
tration intends to invite the Soviets to consider a
partial dismantling of their 351 triple-warhead SS-20
missiles in return for a scaling-down of NATO plans to
deploy 108 Pershing 2 and 464 cruise missiles begin

ning in December.
Jordan asked to join talks
Amman, Jordan — The Reagan administration has
promised King Hussein it will act to attain a freeze of
the rapidly spreading Jewish settlements on the Is
raeli-occupied West Bank if he declares that he in
tends to join Middle East peace negotiations, accord
ing to Jordanian officials and Western diplomats here.
American diplomats have also signaled a willing
ness to accept expelled West Bank mayors as Palesti
nian representatives in a joint Jordanian-Palestinian
negotiating team, the sources said. The United States
refuses to deal directly with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
Among supporters of Reagan's initiative, there was

hope that Saudi Arabia would back the plan. Hussein
has indicated that Saudi backing, along with that of
the PLO, is essential for him to enter the peace nego
tiations.
Much of the anxiety here has found its focus in
growing expressions of doubt about the U.S. role in
the Middle East. Newspaper editorials and columns
question American will and desire to mediate any
peace settlement that would not be humiliating to the
Arabs.
Much of the commentary suggests that Hussein will
decline to join negotiations unless the United States
provides ironclad assurances that it will act forcefully
to halt West Bank settlements.
EPA changes belittled
Washington — The country's top conservation
groups said Monday it will take more to reverse Presi
dent Reagan's "uninformed and uncaring" environ
mental policies than just bringing in a newteam at the
Environmental Protection Agency.
At a joint news conference, the nine organizations
said Reagan's anti-environmental policies at the EPA
were just as prevalent in the dozen other government
agencies charged with protecting the public.
"EPA is but the tip of the iceberg," said Louise
Dunlap, president of the Environmental Policy Cen
ter. "The Reagan administration's campaign to strip
the American people of adequate environmental
protection has successfully penetrated nearly ever
federal agency whose programs impact on our natu
ral resources."
The groups said the same budget cuts and loss of
personnel which have hamstrung the EPA also have
harmed the Occupational Health and Safety Adminis
tration, the Mine Safety and Health Administration,
and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health.
William Turnage, executive director of the Wil
derness Society, said the people that Reagan selected
to staff the environmental agencies were "fundamen
tal, ideologically opposed" to the missions of these
agencies.
"The appalling insensitivity of these appointments,
the egregious conflicts of interest, the groveling to
regulated industry is truly without parallel in the his
tory of our great nation," he said. "We have a presi
dent who seems environmentally uninformed and
uncaring."
Commission talks MX increase
Washington — The special presidential commission
studying U.S. strategic nuclear forces is leaning
toward recommending the phased deployment of up
to 200 new MX missiles, twice as many as were pro
posed in earlier Reagan administration plans that
Congress rejected.
The missiles would be placed in existing Minute
man silos.
Sources say no final decision has been made on the
number of missiles to recommend to the president
next month. The 11-member commission has heard
suggestions ranging from 20 to 200. But the sources
say a majority of the commission members and eight
special counselors now seem to favor the higher fig
ure, even though it could prove controversial on
Capitol Hill.
The main reason is said to be a feeling among many
members that President Reagan genuinely wants an
arms control agreement with Moscow and that this
higher starting point will strengthen his negotiating
position and give the Soviets more incentive to reach
an accord.
The commission may recommend that the new mis
siles be deployed in stages. For example, if the com
mission does decide on 200 missiles, it could recom
mend that these be deployed in an initial phase of 100
with further groups of 50 to follow.
Officials say the commission is seeking a deploy
ment plan that on the one hand will be a "resolute"
statement that the administration plans to modernize
the land-based missile force, yet on the other hand
will leave Congress year-by-year budget control over
that force's size.
Europe reacts to Reagan speech
London — With U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms nego
tiations at a turning point, President Reagan's pro
posals for an advanced technology anti-ballistic mis
sile defense have been received in Europe as a set
back to hopes that the superpowers can stabilize the
nuclear balance.
Because it took Europeans by surprise, official re
sponse to the president's plan has emerged slowly.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who met on
the eve of Reagan's speech last week with his NATO

counterparts, did not brief them on its contents, dip
lomatic sources said yesterday. As a result, the sources
said, concern over the failure to consult on so impor
tant an initiative has influenced consideration of its
substance.
Public comments by the governments of Germany
and Britain, two of the countries scheduled to receive
new American medium-range missiles this year, were
cautious, tending to stress the long-range nature of
the plan. But privately, these governments and others
expressed serious concerns over the timing of the
move, its effect on the arms race and the implications
for Europe's own defenses.
Whatever the conceivable merits of developing a
space-age strategic defensive system, European of
ficials say that there is already so much on the nuclear
agenda that these proposals " create even more con
fusion in an already confused situation," as one Ger
man diplomat put it.
With arms talks deadlocked, both the allies and the
Soviets were awaiting details of a revised Reagan posi
tion on deployment of medium-range nuclear weap
ons to be announced this week when the president
abruptly swerved into a wholly new area. As viewed
from here, Soviet leader Yuri Andropov's bitter de
nunciation over the weekend of Reagan's remarks re
flected Moscow's suspicion that the president de
liberately upstaged the Geneva arms talks by in
troducing a new strategic factor outside the bargain
ing.
House may repeal new tax law
Washington — Republican lawmakers have sent
President Reagan a strong warning that Congress is
determined to repeal a new law requiring a 10 per
cent withholding tax on interest and dividend income
and will override his veto if necessary, a GOP House
leader said yesterday.
The Republican congressmen bluntly told the pres
ident last week that the issue is becoming so emo
tional that it could endanger his re-election prospects
in 1984, said Rep. Richard Cheney (R-Wyo.), chairman
of the House Republican Policy Committee.
But Reagan reiterated his support for the withhold
ing provision in an interview with six newspaper re
porters yesterday.
At last week's meeting, at which the president de
nounced bankers for not lowering interest rates, he
was told by Republican leaders in Congress of the vot
ers' backlash against the withholding requirement. It
is scheduled to take effect July 1.
The Senate is scheduled to consider the repeal
measure April 15 as an amendment to a bill on trade
reciprocity. Passage is virtually assured, although the
repeal effort may be bottled up in the House, where
Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill, (D-Mass.), is in Rea
gan's corner on this issue.
Meantime, the U.S. League of Savings Associations,
a leading advocate of repeal, said yesterday that a new
survey of congressional sentiment showed 68 sena
tors and more than 300 House members backed re
peal. "We have a veto-proof majority in both House
and Senate," said Alan Wade, a league spokesman.
"The president was told that withholding has be
come an extremely painful proposition for Re
publicans," Cheney told a group of reporters at
breakfast.
Stocks down amid mild trading
— Stock prices closed mostly lower in moderate
trading yesterday after an early advance faltered.
Energy, steel and forest-products issues paced the
gainers, while several airline, electronic and financial
stocks fell.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 6.77
points Monday, was up nearly 5 points after the open
ing hour of trading yesterday. But by the closing bell
the measure was down 2.13 points, to 1131.19.

were just as prevalent in the dozen other government
agencies charged with protecting the public.
"EPA is but the tip of the iceberg," said Louise
Dunlap, president of the Environmental Policy Cen
ter. "The Reagan administration's campaign to strip
the American people of adequate environmental
protection has successfully penetrated nearly ever
federal agency whose programs impact on our natu
ral resources."
The groups said the same budget cuts and loss of
personnel which have hamstrung the EPA also have
harmed the Occupational Health and Safety Adminis
tration, the Mine Safety and Health Administration,
and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health.
William Turnage, executive director of the Wil
derness Society, said the people that Reagan selected
to staff the environmental agencies were "fundamen
tal, ideologically opposed" to the missions of these
agencies.
"The appalling insensitivity of these appointments,
the egregious conflicts of interest, the groveling to
regulated industry is truly without parallel in the his
tory of our great nation," he said. "We have a presi
dent who seems environmentally uninformed and
uncaring."
Commission talks MX increase
Washington — The special presidential commission
studying U.S. strategic nuclear forces is leaning
toward recommending the phased deployment of up
to 200 new MX missiles, twice as many as were pro
posed in earlier Reagan administration plans that
Congress rejected.
The missiles would be placed in existing Minute
man silos.
Sources say no final decision has been made on the
number of missiles to recommend to the president
next month. The 11-member commission has heard
suggestions ranging from 20 to 200. But the sources
say a majority of the commission members and eight
special counselors now seem to favor the higher fig
ure, even though it could prove controversial on
Capitol Hill.
The main reason is said to be a feeling among many
members that President Reagan genuinely wants an
arms control agreement with Moscow and that this
higher starting point will strengthen his negotiating
position and give the Soviets more incentive to reach
an accord.
The commission may recommend that the new mis
siles be deployed in stages. For example, if the com
mission does decide on 200 missiles, it could recom
mend that these be deployed in an initial phase of 100
with further groups of 50 to follow.
Officials say the commission is seeking a deploy
ment plan that on the one hand will be a "resolute"
statement that the administration plans to modernize
the land-based missile force, yet on the other hand
will leave Congress year-by-year budget control over
that force's size.
Europe reacts to Reagan speech
London — With U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms nego
tiations at a turning point, President Reagan's pro
posals for an advanced technology anti-ballistic mis
sile defense have been received in Europe as a set
back to hopes that the superpowers can stabilize the
nuclear balance.
Because it took Europeans by surprise, official re
sponse to the president's plan has emerged slowly.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who met on
the eve of Reagan's speech last week with his NATO

counterparts, did not brief them on its contents, dip
lomatic sources said yesterday. As a result, the sources
said, concern over the failure to consult on so impor
tant an initiative has influenced consideration of its
substance.
Public comments by the governments of Germany
and Britain, two of the countries scheduled to receive
new American medium-range missiles this year, were
cautious, tending to stress the long-range nature of
the plan. But privately, these governments and others
expressed serious concerns over the timing of the
move, its effect on the arms race and the implications
for Europe's own defenses.
Whatever the conceivable merits of developing a
space-age strategic defensive system, European of
ficials say that there is already so much on the nuclear
agenda that these proposals " create even more con
fusion in an already confused situation," as one Ger
man diplomat put it.
With arms talks deadlocked, both the allies and the
Soviets were awaiting details of a revised Reagan posi
tion on deployment of medium-range nuclear weap
ons to be announced this week when the president
abruptly swerved into a wholly new area. As viewed
from here, Soviet leader Yuri Andropov's bitter de
nunciation over the weekend of Reagan's remarks re
flected Moscow's suspicion that the president de
liberately upstaged the Geneva arms talks by in
troducing a new strategic factor outside the bargain
ing.
House may repeal new tax law
Washington — Republican lawmakers have sent
President Reagan a strong warning that Congress is
determined to repeal a new law requiring a 10 per
cent withholding tax on interest and dividend income
and will override his veto if necessary, a GOP House
leader said yesterday.
The Republican congressmen bluntly told the pres
ident last week that the issue is becoming so emo
tional that it could endanger his re-election prospects
in 1984, said Rep. Richard Cheney (R-Wyo.), chairman
of the House Republican Policy Committee.
But Reagan reiterated his support for the withhold
ing provision in an interview with six newspaper re
porters yesterday.
At last week's meeting, at which the president de
nounced bankers for not lowering interest rates, he
was told by Republican leaders in Congress of the vot
ers' backlash against the withholding requirement. It
is scheduled to take effect July 1.
The Senate is scheduled to consider the repeal
measure April 15 as an amendment to a bill on trade
reciprocity. Passage is virtually assured, although the
repeal effort may be bottled up in the House, where
Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill, (D-Mass.), is in Rea
gan's corner on this issue.
Meantime, the U.S. League of Savings Associations,
a leading advocate of repeal, said yesterday that a new
survey of congressional sentiment showed 68 sena
tors and more than 300 House members backed re
peal. "We have a veto-proof majority in both House
and Senate," said Alan Wade, a league spokesman.
"The president was told that withholding has be
come an extremely painful proposition for Re
publicans," Cheney told a group of reporters at
breakfast.
Stocks down amid mild trading
— Stock prices closed mostly lower in moderate
trading yesterday after an early advance faltered.
Energy, steel and forest-products issues paced the
gainers, while several airline, electronic and financial
stocks fell.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 6.77
points Monday, was up nearly 5 points after the open
ing hour of trading yesterday. But by the closing bell
the measure was down 2.13 points, to 1131.19.

U.S. makes new arms proposal
Washington — The United States yesterday gave the
Soviet Union a compromise proposal to limit mid
range nuclear missiles in Europe, but President Rea
gan stressed again that his "ultimate goal" is to
eliminate all such weapons.
Reagan, in an exchange with a half-dozen reporters
in the Oval Office, said he would meet today with al
lied ambassadors to discuss the new proposal with
them and then give a formal, public explanation. Ad
ministration officials said the proposal was presented
by the U.S. negotiator at Geneva, Switzerland, to his
Soviet counterpart before the deadlocked talks on
European missiles adjourned until mid-May.
A statement by Reagan of a U.S. willingness to ne
gotiate an interim agreement to permit both sides

equal numbers of warheads on their European missile
arsenals had been expected this week. Letters from
Reagan to North Atlantic Treaty Organization mem
bers, disclosed in part at NATO headquarters in Brus
sels early this week, informed them that the new pro
posal would be presented in Geneva by Paul Nitze,
the U.S. negotiator, before yesterday's scheduled ad
journment.
Officials speaking privately to reporters have sug
gested that Nitze's proposal and Reagan's expected
presentation of it today would contain no precise
numbers of warheads. Instead, they said, the adminis
tration intends to invite the Soviets to consider a
partial dismantling of their 351 triple-warhead SS-20
missiles in return for a scaling-down of NATO plans to
deploy 108 Pershing 2 and 464 cruise missiles begin

ning in December.
Jordan asked to join talks
Amman, Jordan — The Reagan administration has
promised King Hussein it will act to attain a freeze of
the rapidly spreading Jewish settlements on the Is
raeli-occupied West Bank if he declares that he in
tends to join Middle East peace negotiations, accord
ing to Jordanian officials and Western diplomats here.
American diplomats have also signaled a willing
ness to accept expelled West Bank mayors as Palesti
nian representatives in a joint Jordanian-Palestinian
negotiating team, the sources said. The United States
refuses to deal directly with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
Among supporters of Reagan's initiative, there was

hope that Saudi Arabia would back the plan. Hussein
has indicated that Saudi backing, along with that of
the PLO, is essential for him to enter the peace nego
tiations.
Much of the anxiety here has found its focus in
growing expressions of doubt about the U.S. role in
the Middle East. Newspaper editorials and columns
question American will and desire to mediate any
peace settlement that would not be humiliating to the
Arabs.
Much of the commentary suggests that Hussein will
decline to join negotiations unless the United States
provides ironclad assurances that it will act forcefully
to halt West Bank settlements.
EPA changes belittled
Washington — The country's top conservation
groups said Monday it will take more to reverse Presi
dent Reagan's "uninformed and uncaring" environ
mental policies than just bringing in a newteam at the
Environmental Protection Agency.
At a joint news conference, the nine organizations
said Reagan's anti-environmental policies at the EPA

said, concern over the failure to consult on so impor

Public comments by the governments of Germany
and Britain, two of the countries scheduled to receive
new American medium-range missiles this year, were
cautious, tending to stress the long-range nature of
the plan. But privately, these governments and others
expressed serious concerns over the timing of the

for Europe's own defenses.

House may repeal new tax law
Washington — Republican lawmakers have sent
President Reagan a strong warning that Congress is
determined to repeal a new law requiring a 10 per
cent withholding tax on interest and dividend income
and will override his veto if necessary, a GOP House
leader said yesterday.
The Republican congressmen bluntly told the pres
ident last week that the issue is becoming so emo
tional that it could endanger his re-election prospects
in 1984, said Rep. Richard Cheney (R-Wyo.), chairman
of the House Republican Policy Committee.
But Reagan reiterated his support for the withhold
ing provision in an interview with six newspaper re
porters yesterday.
At last week's meeting, at which the president de
nounced bankers for not lowering interest rates, he
was told by Republican leaders in Congress of the vot
ers' backlash against the withholding requirement. It
is scheduled to take effect July 1.
The Senate is scheduled to consider the repeal
measure April 15 as an amendment to a bill on trade
reciprocity. Passage is virtually assured, although the
repeal effort may be bottled up in the House, where
Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill, (D-Mass.), is in Rea
gan's corner on this issue.
Meantime, the U.S. League of Savings Associations,
a leading advocate of repeal, said yesterday that a new
survey of congressional sentiment showed 68 sena
tors and more than 300 House members backed re
peal. "We have a veto-proof majority in both House
and Senate," said Alan Wade, a league spokesman.
"The president was told that withholding has be
come an extremely painful proposition for Re
publicans," Cheney told a group of reporters at
breakfast.
Stocks down amid mild trading
— Stock prices closed mostly lower in moderate
trading yesterday after an early advance faltered.
Energy, steel and forest-products issues paced the
gainers, while several airline, electronic and financial
stocks fell.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 6.77
points Monday, was up nearly 5 points after the open
ing hour of trading yesterday. But by the closing bell
the measure was down 2.13 points, to 1131.19.

U.S. makes new arms proposal
Washington — The United States yesterday gave the
Soviet Union a compromise proposal to limit mid
range nuclear missiles in Europe, but President Rea
gan stressed again that his "ultimate goal" is to
eliminate all such weapons.
Reagan, in an exchange with a half-dozen reporters
in the Oval Office, said he would meet today with al
lied ambassadors to discuss the new proposal with
them and then give a formal, public explanation. Ad
ministration officials said the proposal was presented
by the U.S. negotiator at Geneva, Switzerland, to his
Soviet counterpart before the deadlocked talks on
European missiles adjourned until mid-May.
A statement by Reagan of a U.S. willingness to ne
gotiate an interim agreement to permit both sides

equal numbers of warheads on their European missile
arsenals had been expected this week. Letters from
Reagan to North Atlantic Treaty Organization mem
bers, disclosed in part at NATO headquarters in Brus
sels early this week, informed them that the new pro
posal would be presented in Geneva by Paul Nitze,
the U.S. negotiator, before yesterday's scheduled ad
journment.
Officials speaking privately to reporters have sug
gested that Nitze's proposal and Reagan's expected
presentation of it today would contain no precise
numbers of warheads. Instead, they said, the adminis
tration intends to invite the Soviets to consider a
partial dismantling of their 351 triple-warhead SS-20
missiles in return for a scaling-down of NATO plans to
deploy 108 Pershing 2 and 464 cruise missiles begin

ning in December.
Jordan asked to join talks
Amman, Jordan — The Reagan administration has
promised King Hussein it will act to attain a freeze of
the rapidly spreading Jewish settlements on the Is
raeli-occupied West Bank if he declares that he in
tends to join Middle East peace negotiations, accord
ing to Jordanian officials and Western diplomats here.
American diplomats have also signaled a willing
ness to accept expelled West Bank mayors as Palesti
nian representatives in a joint Jordanian-Palestinian
negotiating team, the sources said. The United States
refuses to deal directly with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
Among supporters of Reagan's initiative, there was

hope that Saudi Arabia would back the plan. Hussein
has indicated that Saudi backing, along with that of
the PLO, is essential for him to enter the peace nego
tiations.
Much of the anxiety here has found its focus in
growing expressions of doubt about the U.S. role in
the Middle East. Newspaper editorials and columns
question American will and desire to mediate any
peace settlement that would not be humiliating to the
Arabs.
Much of the commentary suggests that Hussein will
decline to join negotiations unless the United States
provides ironclad assurances that it will act forcefully
to halt West Bank settlements.
EPA changes belittled
Washington — The country's top conservation
groups said Monday it will take more to reverse Presi
dent Reagan's "uninformed and uncaring" environ
mental policies than just bringing in a newteam at the
Environmental Protection Agency.
At a joint news conference, the nine organizations
said Reagan's anti-environmental policies at the EPA
were just as prevalent in the dozen other government
agencies charged with protecting the public.
"EPA is but the tip of the iceberg," said Louise
Dunlap, president of the Environmental Policy Cen
ter. "The Reagan administration's campaign to strip
the American people of adequate environmental
protection has successfully penetrated nearly ever
federal agency whose programs impact on our natu
ral resources."
The groups said the same budget cuts and loss of
personnel which have hamstrung the EPA also have
harmed the Occupational Health and Safety Adminis
tration, the Mine Safety and Health Administration,
and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health.
William Turnage, executive director of the Wil
derness Society, said the people that Reagan selected
to staff the environmental agencies were "fundamen
tal, ideologically opposed" to the missions of these
agencies.
"The appalling insensitivity of these appointments,
the egregious conflicts of interest, the groveling to
regulated industry is truly without parallel in the his
tory of our great nation," he said. "We have a presi
dent who seems environmentally uninformed and
uncaring."
Commission talks MX increase
Washington — The special presidential commission
studying U.S. strategic nuclear forces is leaning
toward recommending the phased deployment of up
to 200 new MX missiles, twice as many as were pro
posed in earlier Reagan administration plans that
Congress rejected.
The missiles would be placed in existing Minute
man silos.
Sources say no final decision has been made on the
number of missiles to recommend to the president
next month. The 11-member commission has heard
suggestions ranging from 20 to 200. But the sources
say a majority of the commission members and eight
special counselors now seem to favor the higher fig
ure, even though it could prove controversial on
Capitol Hill.
The main reason is said to be a feeling among many
members that President Reagan genuinely wants an
arms control agreement with Moscow and that this
higher starting point will strengthen his negotiating
position and give the Soviets more incentive to reach
an accord.
The commission may recommend that the new mis
siles be deployed in stages. For example, if the com
mission does decide on 200 missiles, it could recom
mend that these be deployed in an initial phase of 100
with further groups of 50 to follow.
Officials say the commission is seeking a deploy
ment plan that on the one hand will be a "resolute"
statement that the administration plans to modernize
the land-based missile force, yet on the other hand
will leave Congress year-by-year budget control over
that force's size.
Europe reacts to Reagan speech
London — With U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms nego
tiations at a turning point, President Reagan's pro
posals for an advanced technology anti-ballistic mis
sile defense have been received in Europe as a set
back to hopes that the superpowers can stabilize the
nuclear balance.
Because it took Europeans by surprise, official re
sponse to the president's plan has emerged slowly.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who met on
the eve of Reagan's speech last week with his NATO

counterparts, did not brief them on its contents, dip
lomatic sources said yesterday. As a result, the sources
said, concern over the failure to consult on so impor
tant an initiative has influenced consideration of its
substance.

and Britain, two of the countries scheduled to receive
