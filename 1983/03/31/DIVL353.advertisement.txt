and you have considered applying to be an RA, please
pick up application materials today in Res Ed, 3 1 1
Old Union. The greater the diversity of the RA staff,
the greater the likelihood that issues of race, ethnicity,
and cross-cultural interaction will be discussed in I
residences. Third-World RA's help influence the
whole staff to assume responsibility for addressing
issues of race and class in our society. Any
Third-World students who wish to discuss RA
responsibilities, compensation and time commitment
should call Alice Supton at 497-3044. I
The Office of Residential education is committed to I
appointing a culturally diverse residence staff and to
encouraging a program which promotes cross-cultural interaction.
