LANGUAGE AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF
HUMAN BEHAVIOR
This Sophomore Seminar has several spaces still
available: any interested student should attend the first
class Thursday evening, 7:30 p.m., in Meyer 143.
Human language specifies specific behavior: the nature and
functions of language as expressed in communicative efforts
from the first to the last cry. Do sub-human primates really speak?
(Animal and human communication compared). Pragmatics and
semantics; brain structure and language; language and
personality, normal, not quite normal, and abnormal. Non oral
language systems; body language. Language in dissolution
(senility and traumatic cerebral damage).
