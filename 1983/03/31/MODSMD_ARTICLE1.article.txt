### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
More than 200 protesters, includ
ing at least one Stanford student, are
still being held in jail for trespassing
on government property during a
large anti-nuclear demonstration at
Vandenberg Air Force Base last
week.
Many of the demonstrators now
being held, like junior Paul
Hodgdon, were previously released
from jail but intentionally allowed
themselves to be arrested again.
According to Doug Spalding, who
participated in the demonstration
but was not arrested, several protes
ters who had been released because
they were first-time offenders tres
passed on the air force base in Santa
Barbara County again in order to at
tain equal treatment for all the de
monstrators. Officials had been deal
ing more harshly with demonstrators
who had also been arrested in a pre
vious protest at Vandenberg, Spald
ing said.
Hodgdon, who is scheduled to be
arraigned tomorrow, was a partici
pant in the demonstration of "civil
disobedience" organized by the
Vandenberg Action Coalition, com
posed of several anti-nuclear groups,
which protested the nuclear missile
testing at the base.
Many of the demonstrators, ar
rested on misdemeanor charges of
trespassing on government prop
erty, are presently practicing civil
disobedience and not cooperating
with officials.
"They're not giving any informa
tion. That's part of the civil disobedi
ence," said senior Richard Hefter,
another participant in the demon

stration who was not arrested.
Spalding said the arrested people
are practicing "jail solidarity" by not
following the instructions of au
thorities and even engaging in a brief
hunger strike in the face of what he
claimed were "unconstitutional and
torturous" methods used by the
police.
Hefter said many of the de
monstrators went to the Vandenberg
protest intending to get arrested.
"The idea was to get as many people
arrested as possible to get it in the
news," he said. "You lie down oryou
walk across a barricade that's illegal
and that's all you need to get ar
rested. It was very non-violent."
