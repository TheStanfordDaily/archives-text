# Laser defense may be feasible

Within 10 to 12 years the United States could
have a space-based system of laser weapons that
would give the entire country a "foolproof" de
fense against missile attack, according to the
research director of a foundation which has ex
plored the concept since 1977.
A more limited ground-based laser system
that could defend key targets such as command
centers and important military bases could be
achieved in about seven years, said Dr. Uwe
Parpart, a physicist who heads research for the
Fusion Energy Foundation in New York City.
Parpart said he could not estimate the cost of
such a defense, but he suggested it ultimately
might require the United States to spend about
$10 billion a year. The entire defense budget
now exceeds $200 billion per year.
"A ballistic missile defense using lasers would
begin to shift the entire strategic equation and
get us away from mutually assured destruction
as a deterrent policy," Parpart said in a recent
telephone interview.
He stressed that his group is not suggesting
nuclear weapons in space, but that it focused

attention on lasers—concentrated light
beams—and charged beams of radiant energy
because they represent methods of igniting the
fusion process in generating nuclear energy on
earth.
"A limited system that could defend key
targets, but wouldn't cover the United States,
could be accomplished in five to seven years,
probably seven," Parpart said.
He added that the first phase of such a de
fense could be built around a ground-based
laser device which would shoot laser beams into
space to be relayed off orbiting mirrors to strike
Soviet missiles as they rose upward in their bal
listic trajectory enroute to the United States.
In a second phase, Parpart said, the United
States could put in operation a space-based sys
tem using x-ray lasers.
With such x-ray beams, Parpart said, "You
would only have to point and shoot."
X-rays are fast-acting, setting off a shock wave
when striking the surface of an intercontinental
ballistic missile and then running through the
entire missile, he said.
