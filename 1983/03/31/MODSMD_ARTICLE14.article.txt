## The 						Stanford Daily Sexual preference clause 
### 
The Law School's recent action implementing
an admissions policy of non-discrimination on
the basis of a student's sexual preference is one
worthy of both praise and emulation.
Because diversity in the student population is
the oft-proclaimed objective of the University,
we believe the same type of written policy
should also be enacted by every other admis
sions office here. Such a policy would not only
encourage gays and lesbians to apply here —
hopefully they are already doing this—it would
also encourage them to list their activities with
gay and lesbian groups without fear of facing
discrimination because of their sexual prefer
ence.
We are not suggesting that such discrimina
tion presently occurs in any admissions office

on campus. However, without publicity, an un
stated policy on this issue will lead to confusion
and misapprehension on the part of both gay
and heterosexual applicants. To clearly state
such a policy would lead to both greater diver
sity of applicants and admitted students.
Refusing to enact such a written policy leads
to confusion and apprehension among applic
ants. The University already has a policy of
non-discrimination based on race, sex, reli
gious preference, color, handicap or national
and ethnic origin, so why not sexual prefer
ence? It is high time that another barrier of ig
norance and distrust on the road to non
discrimination be shattered; the University's
admissions offices can and should play a key
role as battering ram.
