## Peacekeepers of U.S. politics 
### 
President Reagan has renamed the
MX missile "the Peacekeeper." In
only one way could he be right. The
MX missile could help to totally an
nihilate all of mankind in a nuclear
holocaust. And this could bring
thousands and even millions of years
of peace to planet Earth. Are we not
capable of outwitting a president
who believes that the best path to
peace is through the constant threat
of war?
Just how much intelligence does it
require to outsmart the Reagan
hawks? Let us put ourselves to the
test by asking and carefully answer
ing a few relevant questions.
What is the most effective way of
removing Reagan and his crowd as a
threat to peace? We must beat them
at the polls. A landslide victory by the
Democrats is not enough. For both
the Republican and Democratic par
ties support our dangerous military
industrial complex.
How can a new political party do
the job? Third parties are not new.
John Anderson, Eugene McCarthy
and Barry Commoner have daringly
and nobly tried this approach with
out much success. But, we can suc
ceed through the development of a
new kind of political party.
How can a new political party
achieve success? Let us develop a
party called "the Peacekeepers." We
must stick only to issues of peace,
survival and clean government. Our
issue must never involve
Reaganomics, but instead
Reaganatomics. Thus, we will have
both Republican and Democratic
Peacekeepers. Members of the
peacekeepers will ordinarily main
tain their Republican and Democra
tic Party membership. They will enter
the primaries of their own party and
run as Republicans and Democrats,
as the case may be. However, on a
few issues, they will be solidly united
— regardless of party affiliation. On
other issues, they will follow their
own convictions.
Each state should activate its own
organization of the national
Peacekeepers party. In addition to or

instead of entering its members into
the primary elections, the
Peacekeepers may — when wisdom
dictates — choose to endorse some
Republican or Democratic candi
dates that are not members of the
Peacekeepers, provided that they
clearly and unequivocally back the
Peacekeepers' stand on a few fun
damental issues. When a
Peacekeeper does not win in the
primaries, he could run as an inde
pendent Peacekeeper in the regular
election.
In each election, the Peacekeepers
should concentrate only on three or
four very essential issues. For exam
ple, in 1984:
—Promotion of the nuclear freeze.
—Rescinding the last pay raise and
tax break that Congress snuck
through for itself in the closing min
utes of the last session.
— The elimination of unnecessary
Congressional junkets and million
dollar presidential horseback riding
vacations in California — paid for by
the taxpayers.
— Rescinding the Solomon Act that
prevents federal financial aid to any
qualified male college student who
refuses to disclose whether or not he
has registered for the draft. This sets
a dangerous precedent of the inva
sion of privacy and civil rights on the
college campus.
In the 1984 presidential election,
the Peacekeepers should run a Re
publican, such as John Anderson,
and a Democrat, such as Eugene
McCarthy on the same ticket. Both
parties should be represented in
order to unify our efforts at peace,
survival and clean government.
Where is the best place to start the
development of the Peacekeepers
party in each stated On the college
campuses. Why? Because colleges
are still the center of creative think
ing in our country. Many college pro
fessors would make excellent,
knowledgeable, honest and sincere
political candidates. Furthermore,
the colleges can run much lower
cost elections for their candidates.

Students can house candidates in
their homes as they travel from town
to town during political campaigns.
They can furnish transportation.
They can ring doorbells. They can
give much free publicity.
But, aren't college students now
completely apathetic and totally in
different? Absolutely not! They feel
helpless and discouraged about the
future of our planet. As a result,
many of them drown themselves in
challenges that they can deal with —
such as preparing for economically
rewarding professions. However, we
are all well aware that there is no
future to prepare for in a world that
has been destroyed by a nuclear
holocuast. College students need
leadership and inspiration. When
they receive this, then they will do
their part to support and energize a
Peacekeepers Party. They have dem
onstrated this by becoming a power
ful force behind the nuclear freeze
movement, and in their developing
fight against the Solomon Act.
When should we start? Now! We
should investigate at once the legal
aspects of developing the
Peacekeepers Party so that college
campuses can be rolling in political
activity by next fall. Certainly, many
law schools can be called upon to
furnish the necessary legal informa
tion in their own states. Our action
can, in effect, produce a successful
peaceful revolution in our country.
The future is ours to create or de
stroy. Certainly, we can develop a
new political strategy to outwit the
Reagan hawks. Our ability to create
still remains almost unlimited unless
we helplessly bow to the fate of self
destruction. We must not let ourse
lves become victimized by a "Co
lumbus Syndrome" that would take a
world that was round and try to flat
ten it.

Peacekeepers Party. They have dem
onstrated this by becoming a power
ful force behind the nuclear freeze
movement, and in their developing
fight against the Solomon Act.
When should we start? Now! We
should investigate at once the legal
aspects of developing the
Peacekeepers Party so that college
campuses can be rolling in political
activity by next fall. Certainly, many
law schools can be called upon to
furnish the necessary legal informa
tion in their own states. Our action
can, in effect, produce a successful
peaceful revolution in our country.
The future is ours to create or de
stroy. Certainly, we can develop a
new political strategy to outwit the
Reagan hawks. Our ability to create
still remains almost unlimited unless
we helplessly bow to the fate of self
destruction. We must not let ourse
lves become victimized by a "Co
lumbus Syndrome" that would take a
world that was round and try to flat
ten it.

President Reagan has renamed the
MX missile "the Peacekeeper." In
only one way could he be right. The
MX missile could help to totally an
nihilate all of mankind in a nuclear
holocaust. And this could bring
thousands and even millions of years
of peace to planet Earth. Are we not
capable of outwitting a president
who believes that the best path to
peace is through the constant threat
of war?
Just how much intelligence does it
require to outsmart the Reagan
hawks? Let us put ourselves to the
test by asking and carefully answer
ing a few relevant questions.
What is the most effective way of
removing Reagan and his crowd as a
threat to peace? We must beat them
at the polls. A landslide victory by the
Democrats is not enough. For both
the Republican and Democratic par
ties support our dangerous military
industrial complex.
How can a new political party do
the job? Third parties are not new.
John Anderson, Eugene McCarthy
and Barry Commoner have daringly
and nobly tried this approach with
out much success. But, we can suc
ceed through the development of a
new kind of political party.
How can a new political party
achieve success? Let us develop a
party called "the Peacekeepers." We
must stick only to issues of peace,
survival and clean government. Our
issue must never involve
Reaganomics, but instead
Reaganatomics. Thus, we will have
both Republican and Democratic
Peacekeepers. Members of the
peacekeepers will ordinarily main
tain their Republican and Democra
tic Party membership. They will enter
the primaries of their own party and
run as Republicans and Democrats,
as the case may be. However, on a
few issues, they will be solidly united
— regardless of party affiliation. On
other issues, they will follow their
own convictions.
Each state should activate its own
organization of the national
Peacekeepers party. In addition to or

instead of entering its members into
the primary elections, the
Peacekeepers may — when wisdom
dictates — choose to endorse some
Republican or Democratic candi
dates that are not members of the
Peacekeepers, provided that they
clearly and unequivocally back the
Peacekeepers' stand on a few fun
damental issues. When a
Peacekeeper does not win in the
primaries, he could run as an inde
pendent Peacekeeper in the regular
election.
In each election, the Peacekeepers
should concentrate only on three or
four very essential issues. For exam
ple, in 1984:
—Promotion of the nuclear freeze.
—Rescinding the last pay raise and
tax break that Congress snuck
through for itself in the closing min
utes of the last session.
— The elimination of unnecessary
Congressional junkets and million
dollar presidential horseback riding
vacations in California — paid for by
the taxpayers.
— Rescinding the Solomon Act that
prevents federal financial aid to any
qualified male college student who
refuses to disclose whether or not he
has registered for the draft. This sets
a dangerous precedent of the inva
sion of privacy and civil rights on the
college campus.
In the 1984 presidential election,
the Peacekeepers should run a Re
publican, such as John Anderson,
and a Democrat, such as Eugene
McCarthy on the same ticket. Both
parties should be represented in
order to unify our efforts at peace,
survival and clean government.
Where is the best place to start the
development of the Peacekeepers
party in each stated On the college
campuses. Why? Because colleges
are still the center of creative think
ing in our country. Many college pro
fessors would make excellent,
knowledgeable, honest and sincere
political candidates. Furthermore,
the colleges can run much lower
cost elections for their candidates.

Students can house candidates in
their homes as they travel from town
to town during political campaigns.
They can furnish transportation.
They can ring doorbells. They can
give much free publicity.
But, aren't college students now
completely apathetic and totally in
different? Absolutely not! They feel
helpless and discouraged about the
future of our planet. As a result,
many of them drown themselves in
challenges that they can deal with —
such as preparing for economically
rewarding professions. However, we
are all well aware that there is no
future to prepare for in a world that
has been destroyed by a nuclear
holocuast. College students need
leadership and inspiration. When
they receive this, then they will do
their part to support and energize a
Peacekeepers Party. They have dem
onstrated this by becoming a power
ful force behind the nuclear freeze
movement, and in their developing
fight against the Solomon Act.
