## Act to offset discrimination 
### 
Since the Reagan administration has
come to power and the country has
shifted to the right, liberal ideas have
come under fire. One of the liberal
programs whose value is being debated
is Affirmative Action. According to
Garnett Tatum, an assistant affirmative
action officer here, "Affirmative action
is an effort to correct past discrimina
tion" through the ac tive recruitment of
minorities {Daily, lan. 25).
Two problems have resulted from
the implementation of affirmative ac
tion programs. First is the stigma that
the minorities who are hired, or ac
cepted to college, are inferior or less
capable than the other workers or
students. During the college applica
tion process, I repeatedly heard
people say, "You'll get in because
you're black." last year, the vice
president of Harvard University in
sinuated that black students did not
do as well as white students.
The second problem is the charge
that affirmative action unfairly dis
criminates against whites. This feel
ing was reflected in the Bakke court
case against the UC-Davis Medical
School. Charging that he had been
denied admission to the medical
school because his spot had been re
served for a minority, Bakke ap
pealed to the Supreme Court and
won.
Now that the economy has forced
businesses to lay off workers, affir
mative action has taken on a different
dimension. This latest development,
which is being decided in court now,
protects minorities with less senior

ity trom layoffs. Naturally, the work
ers who get laid off and have senior
ity are incensed.
In regard to the first problem, let
me say that lower SAT scores don't
necessarily indicate inferior intelli
gence. Many minorities attend
poorly funded, over-crowded
inner-city schools that just do not
provide an adequate education.
Lacking the educational back
ground, they cannot find jobs or get
any experience. Nearly half of the
black teenagers in the United States
cannot find jobs. Given the chance,
however, to sharpen their some
times blunt academic skills, these in
dividuals will perform just as well as
the people educated in more affluent
suburban and private schools.
As to the second problem, which
suggests unfair discrimination
against whites, we must never forget
that minorities are still discriminated
against and to a much greater extent
than the few whies who may be ad
versely affected by affirmative ac
tion. Make no mistake about it, op
portunity is not equal. Can you name
any black head coaches in the NFL?
You can't tell me that blacks don't
know the game. Why are so many
white democrats failing to support
Harold Washington in his candidacy
for mayor of Chicago? Even at Stan
ford, there is an alarming absence of
minorities. Stanford has no native
Americans on its faculty and no
minorities at all in upper-level ad
ministrative positions. Clearly, ag
gressive, positive action is required.

"Why," you may ask, "should I be
denied a job so that a minority with
less impressive credentials can have
it?" The fact is, you shouldn't. But
put yourself in their place. When
your ancestors were robbed of their
freedom and told they were less than
human, when your great
grandfather was conceived while his
mother was being raped by her mas
ter; when your parents, as the first
blacks in the neighborhood, ner
vously slept in their clothes because
they feared violence from the
neighbors; when you look around at
the students in your class and realize
that you are the only one who is
black; when you notice that, outside
of sports and music, there are virtu
ally no black role models forchildren
to emulate â€” then you start to un
derstand that the future of the black
race and the future of America de
pend upon a serious effort to make
the American Dream accessible to all
Americans.
Admittedly, affirmative action
does not work as well as it could, but
then no system is perfect. We cannot
just throw away programs for which
people have fought and died. We
must continue to correct the damage
that was done by 400 years of oppres
sion. The United States has been
standing on the throat of minorities
for centuries, choking out the hope.
Now it must extend a hand to help
them up. Affirmative action is that
hand.
