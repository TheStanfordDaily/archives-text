# The
						draw of life: what next?
## 
### 
On Dec. 22,1961, my parents drew
a lottery number—they won't tell me
what it was—and I was born.
I was born with a heart murmur
(cardiovascular system draw #4220),
with myopia (vision draw #4718) and
with bad teeth (orthodontic draw
#3962).
But despite these defects my
childhood was rather pleasant and
easy. . .until that fateful day when I
drew 4216 in the adolescence lottery.
4216. My social life was awful, my
complexion was worse, and my
romantic encounters were nil. I tried
petitioning the Adolescence Com
mittee and I tried forging a new
adolescence draw number, but it was
all to no avail.
My luck changed and I drew into
Stanford. Burbank House at Stan
ford, that is. My first choice for the
housing draw was "Any California
State Penitentiary," but anyway I was
placed in Burbank.
Now this year, for the first time,
Stanford seniors are "drawing" for
real-life events, post-graduation, I
drew a mixed batch.
I drew very high for marriage, and I
should get either Jodie Foster or
Maggie Trudeau. But my kids are
looking pretty marginal. My first
one—a 4448—wi1l be an Ozzy Os
bourne groupie. The next — a
3719—wi1l be mildly schizophrenic
and spoiled. It will also be addicted
to Dungeon and Dragons and to
foods derived from soy.
According to the Stanford Real Life
Event Lottery System Handbook, I'm
supposed to return to Stanford for
my 25-year class reunion in order to
draw for real life events, post-45. At
that point I'll be able to draw tor such
niceties as my mid-life crisis (severity
and duration), divorce and alimony

(size of settlement, custody of chil
dren), tax audits and the form of
cancer I'll be contracting. The way
my luck has been going, I might not
be around for that class reunion.
Okay, it's not fair to gripe about
the draw system without offering a
viable alternative. Here, then, is the
Les Firestein Five-Point Plan for
Abundant Stanford Student Hous
ing. Carried out in full or even in
part, this plan will at least DOUBLE
Stanford's present housing capacity.
Plan One: "The Great Stanford
Hospital/Wilbur—Stern Swap." Let's
face it, sick people are in no position
to protest, so let's pack them nine to
a dorm room. Three patients per
room should work fine; and physi
cians will be able to attend to more
victims at once with this system. Pa
tients will undoubtedly realize the
many benefits of sardine cohabita
tion; for instance, when they're
bored and lonely, they can always
play Hollywood Squares!
Meanwhile, valuable and luxuri
ous Stanford Hospital bed space will
have been freed up for new frater
nities and sororities—and all will
surely agree thatthis isa much better
use of space and structures.
Plan Two: "The Two-Mile-Long
Dormitory," SL\C has become too
controversial. The solution: close
down the linear accelerator, and put
up partitions every 10 feet. Also, par
tition the accelerator straight down
the middle. And then what do we
have? Two-thousand one-hundred
and twelve ten-foot by ten-foot dorm
singles! With high ceilings, too! And
students could be fed in their rooms
by means of a conveyer belt! The
room for innovation is endless.
Plan Three: "Escape to Alcatraz."

Buy and renovate Alcatraz.
Plan Four: "Do to Foothill What
We Did to the Indians," or "The Sec
ond Manhattan Project." Convince
the administration at Foothill College
that their land contains exorbitant
amounts of nuclear contamination.
When they buy the story, offer them,
say $24 and some pots and pans for
their "contaminated" land—we'll tell
them that we'd like to use the land
for "contamination research." If
Stanford scientists visit Foothill wear
ing those fancy white technician
jackets and slide-rules, we could get
some good, easily convertable build
ings at an incredibly low price.
Plan Five: "CPA Adjustments and
Trauma Points." Assuming that there
are always going t be students who
are unhappy with their housing as
signments, let's reward their poor
draw with a grade point average
boost. An extra .3 or .4 tagged onto
the GPA just for living in Stern and si
milar dorms seems about right. Then
there's the "trauma point." If you
drew 2500 and your dog died last
week, your adjusted draw number
would be 2400 (based on 100 points
per moderate trauma). Was Daddy
hauled off to San Quentin last week?
Was your roommate busted for deal
ing cocaine? Then your draw #2500 is
now a 500—it's only fair.
The Five-Point Plan potentially of
fers 10,000 more rooms for Stanford
housing—this would create enough
rooms to house all of Stanford's off
campus residents, plus maid's quar
ters for all, plus walk-in closets: Stan
ford has always led the way. This is no
time to stop.
