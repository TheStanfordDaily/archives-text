# Incomplete: an option for end of quarter blues?
## 
### SHELLY WENTKER 
It's dead week and you have
twopapers to write, a final and
two exams to look forward to
during finals week. Worse yet,
you have not finished the re
quired reading for your history
class. Realizing that you will
not be able to finish everything
without sacrificing something,
you begin to panic.
What should you do?
One possibility available to
students in such a position is to
accept an incomplete or "I"
grade, subject to the jurisdic
tion of the instructor.
The incomplete option has
been in existence since before
1970, according to Robert
Houghton, associate registrar.
At that time, the wording of the
policy was somewhat loose, he
said, since the instructor was
able to use an "I" when the
student had completed,"a
satisfactory part of the course
and valid grounds existed for
not completing the required
work."
During the autumn quarter
of 1975, the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and
Acheivement did a review on
the grading system, Houghton
continued. The result of this
study was that the "D" grade

was reinstated as a minimal
pass and the current stipula
tions for the incomplete were
made. The current policy is
that the instructor should use
an incomplete when a student
has completed a, 'substantial'
part of the course work 'satis
factorily.'
Technically, when a student
elects an incomplete and the
professor agrees, the student
has one calendar year to finish
the work or take the final exam,
Houghton explained. "We will
accept grades from faculty
members after one year," he
added.
Most cases regarding in
completes involve papers, ac
cording to Houghton. Post
ponement of final exams poses
problems, especially in large
courses, he added. It is hard
for a professor to create
another test of exactly compar
able difficulty, Houghton ex
plained.
While the student has the
option to take an incomplete,
the final decision is made by
the instructor, Houghton said.
The policy regarding the
choice of an incomplete really
exists for the faculty, not the
students, he added, since it
gives the individual instructor

the opportunity to grade the
student on a more equitable
basis than he would be able to
within the normal constraints
of the academic quarter.
Another motivation for the
incomplete policy is that the
Stanford transcript is different
from that of other schools. It is
considered a "record of
achievement rather than a re
cord of courses attempted,"
according to Susan Mattisoff,
chairperson of the Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement.
Many students have taken
advantage of this policy, ac
cording to Houghton, who
claims it would be a "monu
mental task" to tabulate the
exact number of incompletes
on students' records at the
present time. He estimated,
however, that since the newer
policy was instituted, the
number of students taking in
completes has decreased
somewhat.
Incompletes are there as a
"safety valve," Mattisoff ex
plained, and while there are
really numerical limits on the
number of incompletes a
student is allowed, re
quirements for good academic
standing impose restrictions

on a student's choice of the"I"
option. Mattisoff also noted
that too many incompletes on a
record look bad, especially for
students applying to graduate
school.
For this reason, despite the
availibility of the incomplete,
students have not really
abused the option, according
to Mattisoff. "No one has come
to our committee saying 'this is
a problem,' " she explained.
Mattisoff added that a stu
dent taking an incomplete,
"doesn't hurt anyone."

). Martin Evans, director of
undergraduate studies for the
English Department, disagreed,
saying that in allowing a stu
dent to take an incomplete, the
instructor puts the student as a
disadvantage. He explained
that he allows students to take
incompletes only in cases of,
"dire domestic emergency,"
or in the case of "documented
illness."
This discouragement of
choosing incompletes was
echoed by Gil Masters, as
sociate dean of student affairs
for the School of Engineering.

The problem with incom
pletes, according to Masters, is
that the instructor may change
the relative weights of mid
terms, papers, and the final for
a course from one year to the
next. If a student chooses to
take an incomplete and submit
the work a year later, the in
structor must then "reweight"
the work according to the pre
vious standards for the class,
Masters said.
In order to deter students
from taking incompletes, Mas
ters has his own policy. If a
term paper is handed in late
but prior to the final, he will
lower the letter grade on the
paper. However, if the student
takes an incomplete, submit
ting the work after the final,
Masters lowers the student's
course grade one letter.
Not all professors, however,
penalize in this way and some
students, therefore, do not
hesitate to take an incomplete.
Sophomore Eric Lim has an
incomplete in a class from fall
quarter that he is currently try
ing to complete. A physics
major, Lim's incomplete is in
an English class he was taking
as an elective, not as a re
quirement. Lim took the op
tion for an incomplete because

he felt he needed the time he
would have spent on a paper
for this elective to study for his
final exams in his major-related
courses.
While getting the incom
plete was, "pretty informal,"
Lim said that the instructor waj
"very reluctant," to let him do
so. This was because the in
structor had past students who
had taken incompletes and
never finished the required
work, Lim explained.
Lim added that he would
have dropped the elective class
if he had not gotten an incom
plete and the opportunity to
finish the paper after final
exam period.
Although the 'T'option is
available to all students some
react differently to the pros
pect of taking an incomplete.
Claiming that the incom
plete itself was easy to get,
Diana Dobbs, sophomore,
admitted she wouldn't do it
again unless it was a "very seri
ous situation."
Dobbs took an incomplete at
the end of last spring and was
given two weeks to complete
her paper because the profes
sor was leaving the area.
"It was really hanging over
my head," Dobbs concluded.
