# Spring brings tourist season to the Farm
## 
### KATHY BODOVITZ 
Zealous bikers have more
tour groups to dodge on cam
pus now that spring is here,
and will have even more after
next Monday or Tuesday,
when the Admissions Office is
expected to send out its accep
tances for next year's freshman
class.
As many students are notic
ing, spring quarter seems to
have brought not only much
welcomed sunshine, but an in
creasing abundance of tourists
to the campus.
The month of April is espe
cially busy, because pro
spective freshmen flock to the
Farm to check it out. Accep
tances for the following year's
freshman class usually go out
April 1 and decisions are due
May 1, so all of April is "jam
packed." The guide service,

which normally runs two tours
each day, adds a tour specif
ically for prospective freshmen
at 11 every morning through
out April.
Each tour is held to about 20
people, so two guides are usu
ally needed to accommodate
the prospective frosh. Tours
begin at the information desk
under the arch in the front of
the Ouad and then go past the
church, Alber's Wall, the sci
ence buildings, Terman, the
Firehouse, Tresidder Union
and through White Plaza. The
April tours for many prospec
tive freshmen end at the Ad
missions Office, but groups
want to end up at the
Bookstore.
And they don't just browse at
the Bookstore. Laura Dowling,
clothing and souvenir buyer
for the Bookstore, said she

purchases 40 percent more in
March than in February and
then increases that amount an
additional 40 percent in lune,
and a final 20 percent again in
August.
The clothing section of the
Bookstore carries clothes with
a different look during the
summer, Dowling said. While
Stanford students are more
experimental and like brighter
colored clothes, she said
summer shoppers prefer more
classic, traditional styles. "I
order lots of red, with the Stan
ford seal on everything," she
said.
The only real record of cam
pus visitors is the number of
people who pay to ride up to
the observation platform in
Hoover Tower, and each year
more than 50,000 people go up
for a panoramic view. In Feb

ruary, 1675 people paid, and
rode up, 444 in March (al
though the tower vv.is staffed
very little due to spring vaca
tion) and IH2B in April In Ma\
1467 ascended and I'iOl in
June. The number of visitors
shot up in July to S2<() and to
6638 in August.
The Guide Service run and
staffed by students, gives the
only general c ampus tours, but
tours of the Stanford linear
Accelerator Center, the Med
Center and the Museum and
Art Gallery are also available to
both groups and the public
Marie Arnold, tour c oordin.itor
at SI AC, said she schedules an
average of three public tours
per week.
At the Med Center, summer
is the most popular time for vis
itors. Linda Northway tour

Ihe Stanford Museum and
Art Gallery have the most vis
itors in the spring ac cording to
figures for I'WI-82. According
to Lilliam Ciarner, tour coor
dinator of the Committee for
Art which runs the doc ent pro
gram, most visitors come to the
museum in pre-arranged
groups.
