## De Niro, Scorsese or Lewis—Who is 'King of Comedy'? 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The King of Comedy makes severe emo
tional demands on the viewer — to no appa
rent purpose and with little compensation
ottered. It's an obsessive, steamed-up
movie, but I couldn't tell what had triggered
so much anger and bitterness in the di
rector, Martin Scorsese or the screenwriter,
Paul Zimmerman (Newsweek's movie critic),
or even at whom it was directed.
Robert De Niro, in his fifth picture for
Scorsese, plays Rupert Pupkin, autograph
hound and aspiring stand-up comic; he
spends hours practicing routines in his
room, where he has erected a life-size
mock-up of late-night talk show host lerry
Langford's studio set, with cardboard cut
outs of Langford (lerry Lewis) and Liza Min
nelli, and a gigantic poster of a TV audience
whose laughter and applause he imagines as
he addresses them. (It's his mother's place,
and her screechy complaints from next door
keep drowning him out.)
Though he has never actually performed
his act in public, he feels he is ready for the
Langford show, and one night he plants
himself outside the stage door and, ostensi
bly aiding Langford in getting safely away
from his ravenous fans, he |umps into the
limousine himself and promotes his own al
leged comic talents. To dispose of him,
Langford refers him to the producer's assis
tant (Shelley Hack), and when she doesn't
give him satisfaction, Rupert persists in try
ing to break through to Jerry — even show
ing up at Jerry's home in the company of a
woman he (Rupert) is eager to impress (Di
ahne Abbott). Finally, when all else tails,
Rupert and his friend Masha (Sandra Ber
nhardt a Langford groupie, kidnap lerry and
send a message to the station that unless
Rupert is permitted to open the show that
night, he will kill lerry.
Zimmerman and Scorsese have made
Rupert too calculating and immovable a
character to enlist our sympathies the way,
say, Al Pacino did in Dog Day Afternoon
when he turned a bank robbery into an
underdog cause. So we might presume that
they intended to make a black comedy. But
The King of Comedy is much too slowly
paced and contemplative for that: Scorsese
shoots long, long takes, so that the editor,
Thelma Schoonmaker, can't get a rhythm
going, and the actors linger over their lines
as if they were working through them in
rehears?!. There are jokes, but some of them
a't >o c. .'ml; they're insulting Rupert h Vds
up cue c ardi. for jerry to read over the ph. 'it
— at gunpoint — to his producer, played oy
lohnny Carson's real-life producer Fred De
Cordova, and keeps mixing up the order or
turning them upside down) and most of the
rest just don't seem funny in this slightly
rancid, bad-vibe atmosphere.

Is The King of Comedy supposed to be a
serious film, then? Since the movie indicts
everybody except Langford — Scorsese
slams the studio bureaucrats, and even
supplies an ugly close-up of Diahne Abbott
slipping a glass paperweight from lerry's cof
fee table into her purse), then either
Langford is the hero of the piece or else the
movie is an examination of the impulse in
crazies like Rupert and Masha to invade the
private lives of their idols and create their
own celebrity status, lerry Lewis gives a per
ceptive, lived-in performance as the Johnnv
Carson-style TV star, and he has almost all of
the best moments in the film, but he clearly
isn't at its core; sympathetic as he is, his
character isn't sufficiently developed — and
(surprisingly) we never get to see him acting
funny. No, Rupert Pupkin certainly draws
the focus of the movie — and he's inscruta
ble.
I'm not sure when Robert De Niro started
to bleed the life out of his acting. With an
actor like De Niro or Sissy Spacek or Gary
Busey, who seem to live inside the charac
ters they play, you can't always tell, when
you aren't interested in the character,
whether you're watching a precise depiction

of a boring character or just dull acting. (The
critic Peter Rainer, in his article "Dean vs.
Pryor: Acting in the Seventies," writes
eloquently about this "possessed" school of
acting.) De Niro's intelligent, subtly mod
ulated portrayal of a bourgeois priest in True
Confessions was considerably less exciting
to watch than Robert Duvall's or Charles
Durning's work in the same picture, but I
blamed the script and not De Niro; and
when I couldn't decipher the part he played
in The Deer Hunter, I thought I saw the un
compromising fidelity of an actor to a role
that was still partly in the director's head. But
when you work from deep, deep inside a
character — even brilliantly, as De Niro did
as Jake La Motta in Scorsese's Raging Bull —
you have to open up to the camera or the
audience will feel they've been left out in the
cold.
As usual, De Niro gets 'he behavioral
details of his character dead right: if you've
ever talked to the oddballs (especially in
New York) who sit on the top level of the
hierarchy of groupies, you will recognize the
rankled, superior tone he takes to Sandra
Bernhard, his mu r derously polite, unyield
ing presence in the studio reception room,

and his fiercely territorial stance at a pay
phone near Times Square as he tends off
other citizens who covet his phone. But he
never gives us to understand why Rupert
acts in so lunatic a fashion. The final shot is a
close-up of Rupert's face: the camera pulls
in closer and closer, but De Niro's eyes don't
tell us anything — he presents us with an
impenetrable wall. If you can imagine what
Taxi Driver would have been like it we had
never been admitted into Iravis Bickle's
psyche, then you've got De Niro's perform
ance in The King of Comedy.
As Masha, gangly Sandra Bernhard with
her screaming red curls and her huge
twisted scar of a mouth — always open and
always scowling — does an extended, per
verted version of the stargazer in the old
Judy Garland song "Dear Mr. Cable" or in
Noel Coward's "Mad About the 80. " She
has an aggressive, oripi >< I t.iicnt. m >■* !■.-> '•
quite good in the movie, but by the time she
and Rupert have kidnaped Langtord and tied
him up with masking tape, and — left alone
with him — she plays the big seduction
scene she's been working up to, you've
probably lost all patience with the movie.
She has a very creepy moment in the car,

when she smiles a malevolently sensuous
smile at lerry and stares at him through ,1 pair
ot metallic sunglasses, hut it's pomtlesaly
creepy, because Scorsese and Zimmerman
refuse to tell us why they're putting us
through so much discomfort. Rupert's
stand-up routine is a hit, though either it
isn't very tunny or else the movie had
deadened my sense of humor by then, and
his kidnaping stunt turns him into a real
celebrity whose fans gather to welcome him
back to TV when he gets out of prison. Are
the filmmakers saying that this schmuck is
really no worse than anyone else in show
business, or that all he needed was a break:'
The King of Comedy is a real emotional
workout — it takes you from bewilderment

Local Hero
Not having seen the Scottish writer
director Bill Forsyth's last picture, C,regor\
Girl, I didn't know what to expect from Lo( al
Hero. It turns out to be utterly charming
the most memorable offbeat comedy since
the 1981 All Night Long. Set mostly in a wee
oceanside village that is so underpopulat» d
that its only accountant doubles as an in
nkeeper (there are a few scenes at the offi<
of a large oil company in Houston), it has
many of the virtues of the best English com
edies of the '50s — relaxed mood, mana;;
able size, tight thematic control, a gorgeous
array ot anomalous characters.
The difference is that the directors ot il
most all of those films, including the verv
best ones (The Lavender Hill Mob, laughter
in Paradise, The Lady killers), shared in
anonymous style, but Forsyth has infusi-d
Local Hero with a distinctive temperame '
I he unrushed scenes snap back at you with a
delayed comic spring, and Forsyth keeps hi.
camera at a discreet distance, so that what
happens up on screen seems peculu- l\
self-contained, in a fairy tale world with its
own indigenous time scheme and systen of
logic; and the colors have a fantastical
storybook intensity. (A spanking reel pho <
booth — the sole such instrument in the
place — stands alone like an absurd beacon
on the shore amid the deep of the
evening sea and sky.) Forsyth has m le
something rare here — a poetic comic fan
tasy- And almost everything in its works „
i ne storv beats a certain resnmh
the tarnous Lerner and Loewe musit al i< .•
doon, in which a pair of New York busi
nessmen, lost in the Scottish Highlands, dis
cover a town that has successfullv protected
itself from worldly influences by emergint

from the mist for only one
day in every century. In
Local Hero, "Mac" Macln
tire (Peter Riegert), an oil
company executive, flies to
Scotland to buy up a village
so that his firm can set up a
refinery on the land. The
difference is that Forsyth's
Brigadoon, far from being
immune to worldly forces,
invites them in some meas
ure: with the single excep
tion of Ben (Fulton McKay),
an old man who resides
happily in a shack and
"works" the beach (i.e.,
combs it), the villagers are
eager to have Mac buy them
out and make them rich;
they string him along to jack
up the price. (The
accountant/innkeeper,
Gordon, played by Denis
Lawson, represents their
interests.)
What is magical in this vil
lage is that, living in a
breathtaking landscape,
under a showplace sky
where meteor showers
erupt and the aurora
borealis makes guest ap
pearances, the citizens have
established — evidently
without effort — an entirely
peaceful, laissez-faire soci
ety where a very strange mix
of people co-exist harmoni
ously. The cast of characters
includes a black minister
named Macpherson, a punk
teenage girl and a middle
class Soviet named Victor
(Christopher Rozycki) who
arrives for a visit with a
couple of bottles of vodka in
exchange for Gordon's ser
vices as financial adviser,
and gets up at a dance to
sing a country and western
songwith the local band. All
of Local Hero reminded me
of the one great comic mo
ment in Paul Mazursky's
Tempest, when a crowd of

Japanese tourists in a Greek
nightclub clapped merrily
along with a chorus of
"Hava Nagila."
Mac's style is unruffled
and off-the-cuff, so he fits
right in. He never says that
he has fallen in love with the
place, but as his clothes be
come more casual and he
begins to grow a beard
(which makes him itchy), to
take long walks on the be
ach, and to drink more of
Gordon's fine whiskey, we
can see that he has. Peter
Riegert, who played ]ohn
Heard's roommate in Chilly
Scenes of Winter, is a
minimalist comic actor —
and I mean that as a com
pliment. He never seems to
be working at all, because
he achieves his effects so
economically: with a per
fectly timed double take, an
incidental smile, a low-key
but totally unexpected line
reading. I don't imagine that
two characters in any film
have ever conducted busi
ness in quite the entertain
ing, unpressured way Mac
and Denis Lawson's Gordon
do in this movie.
If every fantasy must have
a magician, Local Hero's is
Burt Lancaster. As Felix
Happer, the oil company
chief who falls asleep in
board meetings, reigns
from a seemingly en
chanted office at the top of a
glistening stairway, and is
far more interested in as
tronomy than oil, Lancaster
does a peerless turn. He's
only in a few scenes, but he
embodies the quirkily be
nevolent spirit of the movie
— he makes Happer its cen
ter. Lancaster, who hit his
stride two years ago in At
lantic City and Cattle Annie
and Little Britches, is in a
great, assured period — we
want to grin every time he
appears. In fact, all of Local
Hero — to borrow a phrase
from a character in Diner —
is a smile.
The King of Comedy makes severe emo
tional demands on the viewer — to no appa
rent purpose and with little compensation
ottered. It's an obsessive, steamed-up
movie, but I couldn't tell what had triggered
so much anger and bitterness in the di

Local Hero
Not having seen the Scottish writer
director Bill Forsyth's last picture, C,regor\
Girl, I didn't know what to expect from Lo( al
Hero. It turns out to be utterly charming
the most memorable offbeat comedy since
the 1981 All Night Long. Set mostly in a wee
oceanside village that is so underpopulat» d
that its only accountant doubles as an in
nkeeper (there are a few scenes at the offi<
of a large oil company in Houston), it has
many of the virtues of the best English com
edies of the '50s — relaxed mood, mana;;
able size, tight thematic control, a gorgeous
array ot anomalous characters.
The difference is that the directors ot il
most all of those films, including the verv
best ones (The Lavender Hill Mob, laughter
in Paradise, The Lady killers), shared in
anonymous style, but Forsyth has infusi-d

happens up on screen seems peculu- l\
self-contained, in a fairy tale world with its
own indigenous time scheme and systen of
logic; and the colors have a fantastical
storybook intensity. (A spanking reel pho <

place — stands alone like an absurd beacon
on the shore amid the deep of the
evening sea and sky.) Forsyth has m le
something rare here — a poetic comic fan

doon, in which a pair of New York busi
nessmen, lost in the Scottish Highlands, dis
cover a town that has successfullv protected
itself from worldly influences by emergint

from the mist for only one
day in every century. In
Local Hero, "Mac" Macln
tire (Peter Riegert), an oil
company executive, flies to
Scotland to buy up a village
so that his firm can set up a
refinery on the land. The
difference is that Forsyth's
Brigadoon, far from being
immune to worldly forces,
invites them in some meas
ure: with the single excep
tion of Ben (Fulton McKay),
an old man who resides
happily in a shack and
"works" the beach (i.e.,
combs it), the villagers are
eager to have Mac buy them
out and make them rich;
they string him along to jack
up the price. (The
accountant/innkeeper,
Gordon, played by Denis
Lawson, represents their
interests.)
What is magical in this vil
lage is that, living in a
breathtaking landscape,
under a showplace sky
where meteor showers
erupt and the aurora
borealis makes guest ap
pearances, the citizens have
established — evidently
without effort — an entirely
peaceful, laissez-faire soci
ety where a very strange mix
of people co-exist harmoni
ously. The cast of characters
includes a black minister
named Macpherson, a punk
teenage girl and a middle
class Soviet named Victor
(Christopher Rozycki) who
arrives for a visit with a
couple of bottles of vodka in
exchange for Gordon's ser
vices as financial adviser,
and gets up at a dance to
sing a country and western
songwith the local band. All
of Local Hero reminded me
of the one great comic mo
ment in Paul Mazursky's
Tempest, when a crowd of

Japanese tourists in a Greek
nightclub clapped merrily
along with a chorus of
"Hava Nagila."
Mac's style is unruffled
and off-the-cuff, so he fits
right in. He never says that
he has fallen in love with the
place, but as his clothes be
come more casual and he
begins to grow a beard
(which makes him itchy), to
take long walks on the be
ach, and to drink more of
Gordon's fine whiskey, we
can see that he has. Peter
Riegert, who played ]ohn
Heard's roommate in Chilly
Scenes of Winter, is a
minimalist comic actor —
and I mean that as a com
pliment. He never seems to
be working at all, because
he achieves his effects so
economically: with a per
fectly timed double take, an
incidental smile, a low-key
but totally unexpected line
reading. I don't imagine that
two characters in any film
have ever conducted busi
ness in quite the entertain
ing, unpressured way Mac
and Denis Lawson's Gordon
do in this movie.
If every fantasy must have
a magician, Local Hero's is
Burt Lancaster. As Felix
Happer, the oil company
chief who falls asleep in
board meetings, reigns
from a seemingly en
chanted office at the top of a
glistening stairway, and is
far more interested in as
tronomy than oil, Lancaster
does a peerless turn. He's
only in a few scenes, but he
embodies the quirkily be
nevolent spirit of the movie
— he makes Happer its cen
ter. Lancaster, who hit his
stride two years ago in At
lantic City and Cattle Annie
and Little Britches, is in a
great, assured period — we
want to grin every time he
appears. In fact, all of Local
Hero — to borrow a phrase
from a character in Diner —
is a smile.
The King of Comedy makes severe emo
tional demands on the viewer — to no appa
rent purpose and with little compensation
ottered. It's an obsessive, steamed-up
movie, but I couldn't tell what had triggered
so much anger and bitterness in the di
rector, Martin Scorsese or the screenwriter,
Paul Zimmerman (Newsweek's movie critic),
or even at whom it was directed.
Robert De Niro, in his fifth picture for
Scorsese, plays Rupert Pupkin, autograph
hound and aspiring stand-up comic; he
spends hours practicing routines in his
room, where he has erected a life-size
mock-up of late-night talk show host lerry
Langford's studio set, with cardboard cut
outs of Langford (lerry Lewis) and Liza Min
nelli, and a gigantic poster of a TV audience
whose laughter and applause he imagines as
he addresses them. (It's his mother's place,
and her screechy complaints from next door
keep drowning him out.)
Though he has never actually performed
his act in public, he feels he is ready for the
Langford show, and one night he plants
himself outside the stage door and, ostensi
bly aiding Langford in getting safely away
from his ravenous fans, he |umps into the
limousine himself and promotes his own al
leged comic talents. To dispose of him,
Langford refers him to the producer's assis
tant (Shelley Hack), and when she doesn't
give him satisfaction, Rupert persists in try
ing to break through to Jerry — even show
ing up at Jerry's home in the company of a
woman he (Rupert) is eager to impress (Di
ahne Abbott). Finally, when all else tails,
Rupert and his friend Masha (Sandra Ber
nhardt a Langford groupie, kidnap lerry and
send a message to the station that unless
Rupert is permitted to open the show that
night, he will kill lerry.
Zimmerman and Scorsese have made
Rupert too calculating and immovable a
character to enlist our sympathies the way,
say, Al Pacino did in Dog Day Afternoon
when he turned a bank robbery into an
underdog cause. So we might presume that
they intended to make a black comedy. But
The King of Comedy is much too slowly
paced and contemplative for that: Scorsese
shoots long, long takes, so that the editor,
Thelma Schoonmaker, can't get a rhythm
going, and the actors linger over their lines
as if they were working through them in
rehears?!. There are jokes, but some of them
a't >o c. .'ml; they're insulting Rupert h Vds
up cue c ardi. for jerry to read over the ph. 'it
— at gunpoint — to his producer, played oy
lohnny Carson's real-life producer Fred De
Cordova, and keeps mixing up the order or
turning them upside down) and most of the
rest just don't seem funny in this slightly
rancid, bad-vibe atmosphere.

Is The King of Comedy supposed to be a
serious film, then? Since the movie indicts
everybody except Langford — Scorsese
slams the studio bureaucrats, and even
supplies an ugly close-up of Diahne Abbott
slipping a glass paperweight from lerry's cof
fee table into her purse), then either
Langford is the hero of the piece or else the
movie is an examination of the impulse in
crazies like Rupert and Masha to invade the
private lives of their idols and create their
own celebrity status, lerry Lewis gives a per
ceptive, lived-in performance as the Johnnv
Carson-style TV star, and he has almost all of
the best moments in the film, but he clearly
isn't at its core; sympathetic as he is, his
character isn't sufficiently developed — and
(surprisingly) we never get to see him acting
funny. No, Rupert Pupkin certainly draws
the focus of the movie — and he's inscruta
ble.
I'm not sure when Robert De Niro started
to bleed the life out of his acting. With an
actor like De Niro or Sissy Spacek or Gary
Busey, who seem to live inside the charac
ters they play, you can't always tell, when
you aren't interested in the character,
whether you're watching a precise depiction

of a boring character or just dull acting. (The
critic Peter Rainer, in his article "Dean vs.
Pryor: Acting in the Seventies," writes
eloquently about this "possessed" school of
acting.) De Niro's intelligent, subtly mod
ulated portrayal of a bourgeois priest in True
Confessions was considerably less exciting
to watch than Robert Duvall's or Charles
Durning's work in the same picture, but I
blamed the script and not De Niro; and
when I couldn't decipher the part he played
in The Deer Hunter, I thought I saw the un
compromising fidelity of an actor to a role
that was still partly in the director's head. But
when you work from deep, deep inside a
character — even brilliantly, as De Niro did
as Jake La Motta in Scorsese's Raging Bull —
you have to open up to the camera or the
audience will feel they've been left out in the
cold.
As usual, De Niro gets 'he behavioral
details of his character dead right: if you've
ever talked to the oddballs (especially in
New York) who sit on the top level of the
hierarchy of groupies, you will recognize the
rankled, superior tone he takes to Sandra
Bernhard, his mu r derously polite, unyield
ing presence in the studio reception room,

and his fiercely territorial stance at a pay
phone near Times Square as he tends off
other citizens who covet his phone. But he
never gives us to understand why Rupert
acts in so lunatic a fashion. The final shot is a
close-up of Rupert's face: the camera pulls
in closer and closer, but De Niro's eyes don't
tell us anything — he presents us with an
impenetrable wall. If you can imagine what
Taxi Driver would have been like it we had
never been admitted into Iravis Bickle's
psyche, then you've got De Niro's perform
ance in The King of Comedy.
As Masha, gangly Sandra Bernhard with
her screaming red curls and her huge
twisted scar of a mouth — always open and
always scowling — does an extended, per

reading. I don't imagine that
two characters in any film
have ever conducted busi
ness in quite the entertain
ing, unpressured way Mac
and Denis Lawson's Gordon
do in this movie.
If every fantasy must have
a magician, Local Hero's is
Burt Lancaster. As Felix
Happer, the oil company
chief who falls asleep in
board meetings, reigns
from a seemingly en
chanted office at the top of a
glistening stairway, and is
far more interested in as
tronomy than oil, Lancaster
does a peerless turn. He's
only in a few scenes, but he
embodies the quirkily be
nevolent spirit of the movie
— he makes Happer its cen
ter. Lancaster, who hit his
stride two years ago in At
lantic City and Cattle Annie
and Little Britches, is in a
great, assured period — we
want to grin every time he
appears. In fact, all of Local
Hero — to borrow a phrase
from a character in Diner —
is a smile.
The King of Comedy makes severe emo
tional demands on the viewer — to no appa
rent purpose and with little compensation
ottered. It's an obsessive, steamed-up
movie, but I couldn't tell what had triggered
so much anger and bitterness in the di
rector, Martin Scorsese or the screenwriter,
Paul Zimmerman (Newsweek's movie critic),
or even at whom it was directed.
Robert De Niro, in his fifth picture for
Scorsese, plays Rupert Pupkin, autograph
hound and aspiring stand-up comic; he
spends hours practicing routines in his
room, where he has erected a life-size
mock-up of late-night talk show host lerry
Langford's studio set, with cardboard cut
outs of Langford (lerry Lewis) and Liza Min
nelli, and a gigantic poster of a TV audience
whose laughter and applause he imagines as
he addresses them. (It's his mother's place,
and her screechy complaints from next door
keep drowning him out.)
Though he has never actually performed
his act in public, he feels he is ready for the
Langford show, and one night he plants
himself outside the stage door and, ostensi
bly aiding Langford in getting safely away
from his ravenous fans, he |umps into the
limousine himself and promotes his own al
leged comic talents. To dispose of him,
Langford refers him to the producer's assis
tant (Shelley Hack), and when she doesn't
give him satisfaction, Rupert persists in try
ing to break through to Jerry — even show
ing up at Jerry's home in the company of a
woman he (Rupert) is eager to impress (Di
ahne Abbott). Finally, when all else tails,
Rupert and his friend Masha (Sandra Ber
nhardt a Langford groupie, kidnap lerry and
send a message to the station that unless
Rupert is permitted to open the show that
night, he will kill lerry.
Zimmerman and Scorsese have made
Rupert too calculating and immovable a
character to enlist our sympathies the way,
say, Al Pacino did in Dog Day Afternoon
when he turned a bank robbery into an
underdog cause. So we might presume that
they intended to make a black comedy. But
The King of Comedy is much too slowly
paced and contemplative for that: Scorsese
shoots long, long takes, so that the editor,
Thelma Schoonmaker, can't get a rhythm
going, and the actors linger over their lines
as if they were working through them in
rehears?!. There are jokes, but some of them
a't >o c. .'ml; they're insulting Rupert h Vds
up cue c ardi. for jerry to read over the ph. 'it
— at gunpoint — to his producer, played oy
lohnny Carson's real-life producer Fred De
Cordova, and keeps mixing up the order or
turning them upside down) and most of the
rest just don't seem funny in this slightly
rancid, bad-vibe atmosphere.

Is The King of Comedy supposed to be a
serious film, then? Since the movie indicts
everybody except Langford — Scorsese
slams the studio bureaucrats, and even
supplies an ugly close-up of Diahne Abbott
slipping a glass paperweight from lerry's cof
fee table into her purse), then either
Langford is the hero of the piece or else the
movie is an examination of the impulse in
crazies like Rupert and Masha to invade the
private lives of their idols and create their
own celebrity status, lerry Lewis gives a per
ceptive, lived-in performance as the Johnnv
Carson-style TV star, and he has almost all of
the best moments in the film, but he clearly
isn't at its core; sympathetic as he is, his
character isn't sufficiently developed — and
(surprisingly) we never get to see him acting
funny. No, Rupert Pupkin certainly draws
the focus of the movie — and he's inscruta
ble.
I'm not sure when Robert De Niro started
to bleed the life out of his acting. With an
actor like De Niro or Sissy Spacek or Gary
Busey, who seem to live inside the charac
ters they play, you can't always tell, when
you aren't interested in the character,
whether you're watching a precise depiction

of a boring character or just dull acting. (The
critic Peter Rainer, in his article "Dean vs.
Pryor: Acting in the Seventies," writes
eloquently about this "possessed" school of
acting.) De Niro's intelligent, subtly mod
ulated portrayal of a bourgeois priest in True
Confessions was considerably less exciting
to watch than Robert Duvall's or Charles
Durning's work in the same picture, but I
blamed the script and not De Niro; and
when I couldn't decipher the part he played
in The Deer Hunter, I thought I saw the un
compromising fidelity of an actor to a role
that was still partly in the director's head. But
when you work from deep, deep inside a
character — even brilliantly, as De Niro did
as Jake La Motta in Scorsese's Raging Bull —
you have to open up to the camera or the
audience will feel they've been left out in the
cold.
As usual, De Niro gets 'he behavioral
details of his character dead right: if you've
ever talked to the oddballs (especially in
New York) who sit on the top level of the
hierarchy of groupies, you will recognize the
rankled, superior tone he takes to Sandra
Bernhard, his mu r derously polite, unyield
ing presence in the studio reception room,

and his fiercely territorial stance at a pay
phone near Times Square as he tends off
other citizens who covet his phone. But he
never gives us to understand why Rupert
acts in so lunatic a fashion. The final shot is a
close-up of Rupert's face: the camera pulls
in closer and closer, but De Niro's eyes don't
tell us anything — he presents us with an
impenetrable wall. If you can imagine what
Taxi Driver would have been like it we had
never been admitted into Iravis Bickle's
psyche, then you've got De Niro's perform
ance in The King of Comedy.
As Masha, gangly Sandra Bernhard with
her screaming red curls and her huge
twisted scar of a mouth — always open and
always scowling — does an extended, per
verted version of the stargazer in the old
Judy Garland song "Dear Mr. Cable" or in
Noel Coward's "Mad About the 80. " She
has an aggressive, oripi >< I t.iicnt. m >■* !■.-> '•
quite good in the movie, but by the time she
and Rupert have kidnaped Langtord and tied
him up with masking tape, and — left alone
with him — she plays the big seduction
scene she's been working up to, you've
probably lost all patience with the movie.
She has a very creepy moment in the car,

when she smiles a malevolently sensuous
smile at lerry and stares at him through ,1 pair
ot metallic sunglasses, hut it's pomtlesaly
creepy, because Scorsese and Zimmerman
refuse to tell us why they're putting us
through so much discomfort. Rupert's
stand-up routine is a hit, though either it
isn't very tunny or else the movie had
deadened my sense of humor by then, and
his kidnaping stunt turns him into a real
celebrity whose fans gather to welcome him
back to TV when he gets out of prison. Are
the filmmakers saying that this schmuck is
really no worse than anyone else in show
business, or that all he needed was a break:'

Local Hero
Not having seen the Scottish writer
director Bill Forsyth's last picture, C,regor\
Girl, I didn't know what to expect from Lo( al
Hero. It turns out to be utterly charming
the most memorable offbeat comedy since
the 1981 All Night Long. Set mostly in a wee
oceanside village that is so underpopulat» d
that its only accountant doubles as an in
nkeeper (there are a few scenes at the offi<
of a large oil company in Houston), it has
many of the virtues of the best English com
edies of the '50s — relaxed mood, mana;;
able size, tight thematic control, a gorgeous
array ot anomalous characters.
The difference is that the directors ot il
most all of those films, including the verv
best ones (The Lavender Hill Mob, laughter
in Paradise, The Lady killers), shared in
anonymous style, but Forsyth has infusi-d

camera at a discreet distance, so that what
happens up on screen seems peculu- l\
self-contained, in a fairy tale world with its
own indigenous time scheme and systen of
logic; and the colors have a fantastical
storybook intensity. (A spanking reel pho <
booth — the sole such instrument in the
place — stands alone like an absurd beacon
on the shore amid the deep of the
evening sea and sky.) Forsyth has m le
something rare here — a poetic comic fan
tasy- And almost everything in its works „
i ne storv beats a certain resnmh
the tarnous Lerner and Loewe musit al i< .•
doon, in which a pair of New York busi
nessmen, lost in the Scottish Highlands, dis
cover a town that has successfullv protected
itself from worldly influences by emergint

from the mist for only one
day in every century. In
Local Hero, "Mac" Macln
tire (Peter Riegert), an oil
company executive, flies to
Scotland to buy up a village
so that his firm can set up a
refinery on the land. The
difference is that Forsyth's
Brigadoon, far from being
immune to worldly forces,
invites them in some meas
ure: with the single excep
tion of Ben (Fulton McKay),
an old man who resides
happily in a shack and
"works" the beach (i.e.,
combs it), the villagers are
eager to have Mac buy them
out and make them rich;
they string him along to jack
up the price. (The
accountant/innkeeper,
Gordon, played by Denis
Lawson, represents their
interests.)
What is magical in this vil
lage is that, living in a
breathtaking landscape,
under a showplace sky
where meteor showers
erupt and the aurora
borealis makes guest ap
pearances, the citizens have
established — evidently
without effort — an entirely
peaceful, laissez-faire soci
ety where a very strange mix
of people co-exist harmoni
ously. The cast of characters
includes a black minister
named Macpherson, a punk
teenage girl and a middle
class Soviet named Victor
(Christopher Rozycki) who
arrives for a visit with a
couple of bottles of vodka in
exchange for Gordon's ser
vices as financial adviser,
and gets up at a dance to
sing a country and western
songwith the local band. All
of Local Hero reminded me
of the one great comic mo
ment in Paul Mazursky's
Tempest, when a crowd of

Japanese tourists in a Greek
nightclub clapped merrily
along with a chorus of
"Hava Nagila."
Mac's style is unruffled
and off-the-cuff, so he fits
right in. He never says that
he has fallen in love with the
place, but as his clothes be
come more casual and he
begins to grow a beard
(which makes him itchy), to
take long walks on the be
ach, and to drink more of
Gordon's fine whiskey, we
can see that he has. Peter
Riegert, who played ]ohn
Heard's roommate in Chilly
Scenes of Winter, is a
minimalist comic actor —
and I mean that as a com
pliment. He never seems to
be working at all, because
he achieves his effects so
economically: with a per
fectly timed double take, an
incidental smile, a low-key
but totally unexpected line
reading. I don't imagine that
two characters in any film
have ever conducted busi
ness in quite the entertain

As usual, De Niro gets 'he behavioral
details of his character dead right: if you've
ever talked to the oddballs (especially in
New York) who sit on the top level of the
hierarchy of groupies, you will recognize the
rankled, superior tone he takes to Sandra
Bernhard, his mu r derously polite, unyield
ing presence in the studio reception room,

and his fiercely territorial stance at a pay
phone near Times Square as he tends off
other citizens who covet his phone. But he
never gives us to understand why Rupert
acts in so lunatic a fashion. The final shot is a
close-up of Rupert's face: the camera pulls
in closer and closer, but De Niro's eyes don't
tell us anything — he presents us with an
impenetrable wall. If you can imagine what
Taxi Driver would have been like it we had
never been admitted into Iravis Bickle's
psyche, then you've got De Niro's perform
ance in The King of Comedy.
As Masha, gangly Sandra Bernhard with
her screaming red curls and her huge
twisted scar of a mouth — always open and
always scowling — does an extended, per
verted version of the stargazer in the old
Judy Garland song "Dear Mr. Cable" or in
Noel Coward's "Mad About the 80. " She

quite good in the movie, but by the time she
and Rupert have kidnaped Langtord and tied
him up with masking tape, and — left alone
with him — she plays the big seduction
scene she's been working up to, you've
probably lost all patience with the movie.
She has a very creepy moment in the car,

when she smiles a malevolently sensuous
smile at lerry and stares at him through ,1 pair

creepy, because Scorsese and Zimmerman
refuse to tell us why they're putting us
through so much discomfort. Rupert's
stand-up routine is a hit, though either it
isn't very tunny or else the movie had
deadened my sense of humor by then, and
his kidnaping stunt turns him into a real
celebrity whose fans gather to welcome him
back to TV when he gets out of prison. Are
the filmmakers saying that this schmuck is
really no worse than anyone else in show
business, or that all he needed was a break:'

Local Hero
Not having seen the Scottish writer
director Bill Forsyth's last picture, C,regor\
Girl, I didn't know what to expect from Lo( al
Hero. It turns out to be utterly charming
the most memorable offbeat comedy since
the 1981 All Night Long. Set mostly in a wee
oceanside village that is so underpopulat» d
that its only accountant doubles as an in
nkeeper (there are a few scenes at the offi<
of a large oil company in Houston), it has
many of the virtues of the best English com
edies of the '50s — relaxed mood, mana;;
able size, tight thematic control, a gorgeous
array ot anomalous characters.
The difference is that the directors ot il
most all of those films, including the verv
best ones (The Lavender Hill Mob, laughter
in Paradise, The Lady killers), shared in
anonymous style, but Forsyth has infusi-d
Local Hero with a distinctive temperame '

camera at a discreet distance, so that what
happens up on screen seems peculu- l\
self-contained, in a fairy tale world with its
own indigenous time scheme and systen of
logic; and the colors have a fantastical
storybook intensity. (A spanking reel pho <
booth — the sole such instrument in the
place — stands alone like an absurd beacon
on the shore amid the deep of the
evening sea and sky.) Forsyth has m le
something rare here — a poetic comic fan
tasy- And almost everything in its works „
i ne storv beats a certain resnmh
the tarnous Lerner and Loewe musit al i< .•
doon, in which a pair of New York busi
nessmen, lost in the Scottish Highlands, dis
cover a town that has successfullv protected
itself from worldly influences by emergint

from the mist for only one
day in every century. In
Local Hero, "Mac" Macln
tire (Peter Riegert), an oil
company executive, flies to
Scotland to buy up a village
so that his firm can set up a
refinery on the land. The
difference is that Forsyth's
Brigadoon, far from being
immune to worldly forces,
invites them in some meas
ure: with the single excep
tion of Ben (Fulton McKay),
an old man who resides
happily in a shack and
"works" the beach (i.e.,
combs it), the villagers are
eager to have Mac buy them
out and make them rich;
they string him along to jack
up the price. (The
accountant/innkeeper,
Gordon, played by Denis
Lawson, represents their
interests.)
What is magical in this vil
lage is that, living in a
breathtaking landscape,
under a showplace sky
where meteor showers
erupt and the aurora
borealis makes guest ap
pearances, the citizens have
established — evidently
without effort — an entirely
peaceful, laissez-faire soci
ety where a very strange mix
of people co-exist harmoni
ously. The cast of characters
includes a black minister
named Macpherson, a punk
teenage girl and a middle
class Soviet named Victor
(Christopher Rozycki) who
arrives for a visit with a
couple of bottles of vodka in
exchange for Gordon's ser
vices as financial adviser,
and gets up at a dance to
sing a country and western
songwith the local band. All
of Local Hero reminded me
of the one great comic mo
ment in Paul Mazursky's
Tempest, when a crowd of

Japanese tourists in a Greek
nightclub clapped merrily
along with a chorus of
"Hava Nagila."
Mac's style is unruffled
and off-the-cuff, so he fits
right in. He never says that
he has fallen in love with the
place, but as his clothes be
come more casual and he
begins to grow a beard
(which makes him itchy), to
take long walks on the be
ach, and to drink more of
Gordon's fine whiskey, we
can see that he has. Peter
Riegert, who played ]ohn
Heard's roommate in Chilly
Scenes of Winter, is a
minimalist comic actor —
and I mean that as a com
pliment. He never seems to
be working at all, because
he achieves his effects so
economically: with a per
fectly timed double take, an
incidental smile, a low-key
but totally unexpected line
reading. I don't imagine that
two characters in any film
have ever conducted busi
ness in quite the entertain
ing, unpressured way Mac
and Denis Lawson's Gordon
do in this movie.
If every fantasy must have
a magician, Local Hero's is
Burt Lancaster. As Felix
Happer, the oil company
chief who falls asleep in
board meetings, reigns
from a seemingly en
chanted office at the top of a
glistening stairway, and is
far more interested in as
tronomy than oil, Lancaster
does a peerless turn. He's
only in a few scenes, but he
embodies the quirkily be
nevolent spirit of the movie
— he makes Happer its cen
ter. Lancaster, who hit his
stride two years ago in At
lantic City and Cattle Annie
and Little Britches, is in a
great, assured period — we
want to grin every time he
appears. In fact, all of Local
Hero — to borrow a phrase
from a character in Diner —
is a smile.
