# The
						paradigmatic Pat Benatar

### TONY KELLY 
The problem in trying to figure out
Pat Benatar is not in developing a set of
assumptions and proceeding from
there. It's in deciding which set of as
sumptions you're going to start off be
lieving.
The first school of thought could be
called the Amazon Paradigm, and could
be close to your beliefs if you consider
the history of music to be essentially a
tale of horny men with guitars wooing
adoring female folk under the moon
light. It doesn't really matter whether
said musician is a crooning Sensitive
Male Type (available on page 174 of the
L.L.Bean catalogue, right next to the
down-filled vests) or an honors
graduate from the Electric Phallus
School of Macho Guitar. The crucial
point is that the musician—the one tak
ing the initiative, the aggressor, the
stronger partner— is, almost without
exception, a man. And that has pretty
unfortunate implications, both for the
men who assume the dominant posi
tions in the music business and the
women who, consciously or not, play
along with the same games because
that's rock and roll.
In this messy business of record-bin
politicking, Benatar stands out as a
strong exception to the rules, simply
because of the idiom she has chosen to
use in making her living. Here is a
woman—a gurl even—who is not only
singing (hell, she could have stuck to
opera training and done that), but
climbing up to the top of her stiletto
heels and wailing"you better run, you
better hide" and "don't you mess

around with me." She's not competing
with )oni Mitchell, she's down in the
trenches with )udas Priest—and win
ning, if the sellout crowd at Maples
Pavilion last Friday night was any indica
tion. All of a sudden, what seems like
just another night of arena rock on the
other side of campus (and what was
exactly that with Red Rider, an opening
act that acts like it wants to be one of
those generic male bands that you dnd I
both hate, but everybody else wants to
feed money) takes on a slight air of lib
eration, of a realized quality. Pat Be
natar looks just as foolish playing an air
guitar as any male rock and roller, and
because she has the guts to adopt the
near-misogynist language of rock and
use it for her own purposes, more
power to her.
OK, now for School of Thought
Number Two. This could be called the
|r. Geraldo Paradigm, in honor of the
little 1-shirt one rabid fan at Maples
gave Benatar during her encore, along
with a pair of baby booties. Faced with
this gift, what did Pat do? Shudder with
horror at the thought of the pitter
patter of little greaser-guitarist feet
around the house, as the future off
spring of Benatar and husband/lead
axeman Neil Geraldo shackle them
selves around those stiletto heels and
limit the career of this courageous
trooper of a rock singer? Not a chance.
Patty simply smiled demurely, held up
the shirt and crossed her fingers, look
ing far less like the Tough Chick and far
more like the Dutiful Wife. First Chris
sie marries Ray Davies, and now

this—looks like the end of the line for
roc k feminism.
It's easy to tall prey to this line of
thinking, too—all you have to do is re
member is that even though Benatar's
singing about messed-up men trying to
mess her up, she's also asking—
begging, even—those same screwed
up guys to treat her right and to hit her
with their best shot. She may have
traded her Spandex in for pink and la
vender (more in keeping with her
hubby Neil's home in the Valley), but
the same mind-set exists. It's kind of
designer-jean Catholicism, looking
flashy and promising steamy times
ahead but in the end convincing one
and all that maybe a quiet life in a semi
nary would be a good choice. Some
would say that this, rather than striking
blow for women in music, is more like
hammering another nail into the coffin,
playing right into the power chords of
the dangerous men unleashed on the
arenas of America.
Soooooo, which do you believe—
Paradigm A or Paradigm B? To tell you
the truth, I don't have a clue. A big part
of the reason is that, for all this
hypothesizing, there is absolutely no
evidence whatsoever from Benatar her
self. During her performance on Friday,
she unconsciously straddled the fine
line between assumptions, alternately
falling on either side as she hopped
around her curious repertoire of songs.
It's easy to guess which side of the
fence Neil Geraldo plays on, as his ex
tended leads descended steadily from

imitations of the jimmy Page songbook
to an incomprehensible exhibition of
the Stomp and Drone genre of solo
work. And as for his rhythm work while
Benatar was singing, well, hey, even I
play guitar.
But while poor Neil was floundering
on this assigned portion of the (nicely
designed) stage, only resting to floun
der in tandem with a keyboardist (ad
ded for this tour) who looked like he
just came out of the spin cycle, Pat was
sailing pretty smoothly—especially in
the encore. Now there are some con
certs where you think you have to
dance, and there are some concerts
where you feel you have to dance. But
at Maples Pavilion, where about half
the population of Santa Clara County
rushed the stage by jumping onto the
spring-supported floor, you literally
had to dance to keep your balance. Not
even a hamfisted version of "I Heard it
Through the Grapevine" (who ever
gave these guys the idea to play Marvin
Gaye? Or Otis Redding?) could stop
this bunch, obviously more concerned
with the professional shine of Benatar s
work (despite a slightly hoarse voice)
than the nagging theoretical questions
of a few folks who don't really want to
spoil the party, but do so 'cause they're
paid to put it in print. It was a fun show,
pure and simple; and even though
there is nothing that pure and that sim
ple about Benatar's music or even her
mere presence in the music business,
there's no real point in quibbling with
an accomplished singer over a few silly
paradigms.
