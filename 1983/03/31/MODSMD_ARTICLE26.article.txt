# Pink Floyd's 'The Final Cut'—a big step
## 
### BARRY LURIE 
No one thought they would
do it. I didn't either — although
I prayed they would. Finally,
after four years of anticipation,
Pink Floyd has belted out
another one. Anyone would
have been satisfied with an
alburn as good as The Wall, but
Floyd's The Final Cut far excels
its preceding classic and yes, is
probably even better than Dark
Side of the Moon. But let us not
forget how we said "Nothing
can top The Wall" and "they
should quit now while they're
ahead." That argument, which
could have equally been used
after Dark Side came out in '73,
thus seems to be unqualified
reasoning.
Subtitling the album "A Re
quiem for the Post-War
Dream," Roger Waters, Floyd's
main songwriter, shows his in
fatuation with war and its at
rocities — perhaps instigated
by his father's death in WWII.
But he shares this infatuation
with no one; in fact, he writes
all the songs to the album —
the final culmination to his
gradual take-over of the band
which started with Dark Side.
Despite this, the music does
not become bland. All the
songs reveal Floyd's typical
originality and technical in
genuity: varying from a simple
yet eerie guitar strumming
song to a wild and shocking
Indian-flavored masterpiece.
The album has something any
faithful Pink Floyd fan could
ever want: the lyrics and vocals
of Animals, the cynicism of
"Have a Cigar" in Wish You
Were Here, the background
sound effects on The Wall (this
time replacing helicopters with
F-15s) and use of other musi
cians (a tenor sax, female choir
and a philharmonic orchestra)
as found in Dark Side.
But to say Final Cut is a re
hash of earlier material is
equally unqualified: Waters is
dealing with something else

here — his own powertul emo
tions. A sense of hostility and a
basic anti-life view prevails all
over the record, and the
songwriter has really put him
self in a potentially dangerous
position with his extremism.
Fortunately, he contains it well
and the album thus has an
eerie, bitingly sarcastic tone
(although Waters seems to
have a fetish about pronounc
ing his consonants). The al
bum's front looks hideous, I
know, but we must not judge
an album by its cover.
The record starts off strong.
Waters simply questions the
ideals and purposes of the
modern age. "Whatever hap
pened to the post-war dream?"
he asks "Maggie" — that is,
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of England, of course.
Things now aren't the way they
were all set up to be. All we
have are unfulfilled hopes and
shattered dreams. The drab
and ordinary kitchen noises
immediately following the
song adds to the revulsion of
the humdrum life and unkept
promises.
"Your Possible Pasts," prob
ably one of the album's most
innovative songs, is one of re
trospect, telling unnamed sol
diers what they could have
done in lieu of fighting,
"strung out behind us the ban
ners and flags of our possible
pasts lie in tatters and rags."
The song is a real Floydian
shocker; sudden and gripping,
ending unexpectedly and
blending into the tick-tock of a
clock — Pink Floyd's famous
representation of time wasted.
In an almost Brechtian
mode, "One of the Few" is a
simple song — a chilling recipe
on how to produce willing sol
diers out of men: "Make them
me, make them you/ Make
them do what you want them
to/ Make 'em laugh, make
them cry, make them lie down
and die."

By far, Floyd's "The Hero's
Return" is their greatest tech
nical triumph: twisting guitars
to sound like shooting arrows,
synthesizers and a new step in
stereo — " holophonics,"
which gives any stereo an
added third-dimensional qual
ity to the music. The song itself
is not bad either: a vicious at
tack on social pressures to
maintain manliness and reject
emotions. "Even now part of
me flies over Dresden . . .
though they'll never fathom it,
behind my sarcasm desperate
memories lie." David Cilmour
here plays a fantastic sliding
guitar, while the song's wisp
and haunting style manages to
portray the perfect madman,
whose next moves we can
never predict.
Utopias are unattainable, as
we all know, and"The Gun
ners Dream" (sic) mocks hold
ing on to such fantasies. Wat
ers cynically screams out
"Hold on to the dream," the
last word of which drowns into
a sax solo, making the vocals
and sax indistinguishable from
each other. The song is beauti
ful and flawlessly performed
and although it is depressing,
asks us to treat social un
pieasantries at face value.
The second side, however,
differs just a tad. Suddenly,
enter Brezhnev, Begin and Gal
tieri, and of course "Maggie."
We hear Pink Floyd reacting,
unlike in any of their other al
bums to the more recent
events of 1982: a TV commen
tator discusses the aftermath of
the Falklands conflict, and
Waters dreams of a place
where "maniacs don't blow
holes in bandsmen by remote
control." Begin takes Beirut
and Brezhnev takes Afghanis
tan. Is this, then, a drawback?
Perhaps so, since such inci
dents will lose their political
impact with time. Neverthe
less, the famed British com
poser has a marvelous time

putting all of today's world
leaders in "The Fletcher
Memorial Home," a fictitious
old-politicians home "for in
curable tyrants and kings."
"Southampton Dock" is a
beautiful, simple song noting
how the country (here, En
gland) uses its soldiers: "and
when the fight was over/ We
spent what they had made."
This, Waters explains, is the
Final Cut — the incurred injus
tice, the mistreatment of any
body in war.
The title track, which im
mediately follows, is, well,
quite simply fantastic. By com
paring anyone's attempt to
achieve anything to a man try
ing to break through various
protective barriers to reach a
safe, Waters conveys the same
odd atmosphere of paranoia
and alienation which charac
terized The Wall. The song
deals with fears, the conse
quences of exposing fears, and
unrealized "hallucinations."
That is not, however, all that
resembles The Wall. In fact, the
song is eerily reminiscent of
"Comfortably Numb," but
maintains its own distinctive
sound all the same.
"Not Now John," probably
the album's nastiest and most
cynical cut, makes a great
parody of modern nations'
ever-increasing paranoias of
each other and their lusts for
conquering to prove to them
selves, if not others, their pro
wess: "Got to bring the Rus
sian bear to his knees/ Well,
maybe not the Russian bear/
Maybe the Swedes/ We
showed Argentina/ Now let's
go and show these/ Make us
feel tough/ Oh, wouldn't Mag
gie be pleased."
The album ends on a soft
note, as Floyd is known to do.
But midway through the last
song, Waters lurches into
black humor in describing the
last-minute thoughts of a car
driver just before he rams into

a truck. This, as the "Two Suns
in the Sunset" suggest, is how
we will feel during those few
seconds between seeing the
atomic flash of a nuclear
holocaustand our subsequent,
immediate deaths. Sure, there
are other moments of morbid
gestures in the album ("it can't
be much fun for them beneath
the rising sun, with all their
kids committing suicide"). But
the intention is clear enough:
Waters just doesn't want to
take life for granted, and is
pointing out how often the
thought of death never even
occurs to us — most signifi
cantly when we so boldly enlist
to fight in war.
Let us not forget David Gil
mour, whose superb guitar
leads have improved The Wall
even more since — even
though his songwriting has
temporarily been suspended.
Nick Mason, Floyd's drummer,
maintains a sense of perfect
timing, driving the album
powerfully. Waters' musical
talents, as well, once again de
fies the laws of bass guitars.
Despite the loss of the group's
keyboardist, Richard Wright,
keyboards ironically figure
more in this album than in any
of their others. So much, then,
for Richard Wright.
Overall, however, Waters
deserves all the honors for this
album. His is a genious which
stands out loud and clear —
improving with each new re
cord. As in all their works,
Waters has structured this one
to be pessimistic, but not
overbearingly depressing.
Perhaps the man does have an
overflowing sense of justice
and a touch of paranoia, but his
fears and cynicism lead to a
common theme: there are no
solutions to the atrocities of
the world, just watch out and
be careful of whatever you do
— for this next step may be
your last.
No one thought they would
do it. I didn't either — although
I prayed they would. Finally,
after four years of anticipation,
Pink Floyd has belted out

to/ Make 'em laugh, make
them cry, make them lie down
and die."

By far, Floyd's "The Hero's
Return" is their greatest tech
nical triumph: twisting guitars
to sound like shooting arrows,
synthesizers and a new step in
stereo — " holophonics,"
which gives any stereo an
added third-dimensional qual
ity to the music. The song itself
is not bad either: a vicious at
tack on social pressures to
maintain manliness and reject
emotions. "Even now part of
me flies over Dresden . . .
though they'll never fathom it,
behind my sarcasm desperate
memories lie." David Cilmour
here plays a fantastic sliding
guitar, while the song's wisp
and haunting style manages to
portray the perfect madman,
whose next moves we can
never predict.
Utopias are unattainable, as
we all know, and"The Gun
ners Dream" (sic) mocks hold
ing on to such fantasies. Wat
ers cynically screams out
"Hold on to the dream," the
last word of which drowns into
a sax solo, making the vocals
and sax indistinguishable from
each other. The song is beauti
ful and flawlessly performed
and although it is depressing,
asks us to treat social un
pieasantries at face value.
The second side, however,
differs just a tad. Suddenly,
enter Brezhnev, Begin and Gal
tieri, and of course "Maggie."
We hear Pink Floyd reacting,
unlike in any of their other al
bums to the more recent
events of 1982: a TV commen
tator discusses the aftermath of
the Falklands conflict, and
Waters dreams of a place
where "maniacs don't blow
holes in bandsmen by remote
control." Begin takes Beirut
and Brezhnev takes Afghanis
tan. Is this, then, a drawback?
Perhaps so, since such inci
dents will lose their political
impact with time. Neverthe
less, the famed British com
poser has a marvelous time

putting all of today's world
leaders in "The Fletcher
Memorial Home," a fictitious
old-politicians home "for in
curable tyrants and kings."
"Southampton Dock" is a
beautiful, simple song noting
how the country (here, En
gland) uses its soldiers: "and
when the fight was over/ We
spent what they had made."
This, Waters explains, is the
Final Cut — the incurred injus
tice, the mistreatment of any
body in war.
The title track, which im
mediately follows, is, well,
quite simply fantastic. By com
paring anyone's attempt to
achieve anything to a man try
ing to break through various
protective barriers to reach a
safe, Waters conveys the same
odd atmosphere of paranoia
and alienation which charac
terized The Wall. The song
deals with fears, the conse
quences of exposing fears, and
unrealized "hallucinations."
That is not, however, all that
resembles The Wall. In fact, the
song is eerily reminiscent of
"Comfortably Numb," but
maintains its own distinctive
sound all the same.
"Not Now John," probably
the album's nastiest and most
cynical cut, makes a great
parody of modern nations'
ever-increasing paranoias of
each other and their lusts for
conquering to prove to them
selves, if not others, their pro
wess: "Got to bring the Rus
sian bear to his knees/ Well,
maybe not the Russian bear/
Maybe the Swedes/ We
showed Argentina/ Now let's
go and show these/ Make us
feel tough/ Oh, wouldn't Mag
gie be pleased."
The album ends on a soft
note, as Floyd is known to do.
But midway through the last
song, Waters lurches into
black humor in describing the
last-minute thoughts of a car
driver just before he rams into

a truck. This, as the "Two Suns
in the Sunset" suggest, is how
we will feel during those few
seconds between seeing the
atomic flash of a nuclear
holocaustand our subsequent,
immediate deaths. Sure, there
are other moments of morbid
gestures in the album ("it can't
be much fun for them beneath
the rising sun, with all their
kids committing suicide"). But
the intention is clear enough:
Waters just doesn't want to
take life for granted, and is
pointing out how often the
thought of death never even
occurs to us — most signifi
cantly when we so boldly enlist
to fight in war.
Let us not forget David Gil
mour, whose superb guitar
leads have improved The Wall
even more since — even
though his songwriting has
temporarily been suspended.
Nick Mason, Floyd's drummer,
maintains a sense of perfect
timing, driving the album
powerfully. Waters' musical
talents, as well, once again de
fies the laws of bass guitars.
Despite the loss of the group's
keyboardist, Richard Wright,
keyboards ironically figure
more in this album than in any
of their others. So much, then,
for Richard Wright.
Overall, however, Waters
deserves all the honors for this
album. His is a genious which
stands out loud and clear —
improving with each new re
cord. As in all their works,
Waters has structured this one
to be pessimistic, but not
overbearingly depressing.
Perhaps the man does have an
overflowing sense of justice
and a touch of paranoia, but his
fears and cynicism lead to a
common theme: there are no
solutions to the atrocities of
the world, just watch out and
be careful of whatever you do
— for this next step may be
your last.
No one thought they would
do it. I didn't either — although
I prayed they would. Finally,
after four years of anticipation,
Pink Floyd has belted out
another one. Anyone would
have been satisfied with an
alburn as good as The Wall, but
Floyd's The Final Cut far excels
its preceding classic and yes, is
probably even better than Dark
Side of the Moon. But let us not
forget how we said "Nothing
can top The Wall" and "they
should quit now while they're
ahead." That argument, which
could have equally been used
after Dark Side came out in '73,
thus seems to be unqualified
reasoning.
Subtitling the album "A Re
quiem for the Post-War
Dream," Roger Waters, Floyd's
main songwriter, shows his in
fatuation with war and its at
rocities — perhaps instigated
by his father's death in WWII.
But he shares this infatuation
with no one; in fact, he writes
all the songs to the album —
the final culmination to his
gradual take-over of the band
which started with Dark Side.
Despite this, the music does
not become bland. All the
songs reveal Floyd's typical
originality and technical in
genuity: varying from a simple
yet eerie guitar strumming
song to a wild and shocking
Indian-flavored masterpiece.
The album has something any
faithful Pink Floyd fan could
ever want: the lyrics and vocals
of Animals, the cynicism of
"Have a Cigar" in Wish You
Were Here, the background
sound effects on The Wall (this
time replacing helicopters with
F-15s) and use of other musi
cians (a tenor sax, female choir
and a philharmonic orchestra)
as found in Dark Side.
But to say Final Cut is a re
hash of earlier material is
equally unqualified: Waters is
dealing with something else

here — his own powertul emo
tions. A sense of hostility and a
basic anti-life view prevails all
over the record, and the
songwriter has really put him
self in a potentially dangerous
position with his extremism.
Fortunately, he contains it well
and the album thus has an
eerie, bitingly sarcastic tone
(although Waters seems to
have a fetish about pronounc
ing his consonants). The al
bum's front looks hideous, I
know, but we must not judge
an album by its cover.
The record starts off strong.
Waters simply questions the
ideals and purposes of the
modern age. "Whatever hap
pened to the post-war dream?"
he asks "Maggie" — that is,
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of England, of course.
Things now aren't the way they
were all set up to be. All we
have are unfulfilled hopes and
shattered dreams. The drab
and ordinary kitchen noises
immediately following the
song adds to the revulsion of
the humdrum life and unkept
promises.
"Your Possible Pasts," prob
ably one of the album's most
innovative songs, is one of re
trospect, telling unnamed sol
diers what they could have
done in lieu of fighting,
"strung out behind us the ban
ners and flags of our possible
pasts lie in tatters and rags."
The song is a real Floydian
shocker; sudden and gripping,
ending unexpectedly and
blending into the tick-tock of a
clock — Pink Floyd's famous
representation of time wasted.
In an almost Brechtian
mode, "One of the Few" is a
simple song — a chilling recipe
on how to produce willing sol
diers out of men: "Make them
me, make them you/ Make
them do what you want them
to/ Make 'em laugh, make
them cry, make them lie down
and die."

By far, Floyd's "The Hero's
Return" is their greatest tech

note, as Floyd is known to do.
But midway through the last
song, Waters lurches into
black humor in describing the
last-minute thoughts of a car
driver just before he rams into

a truck. This, as the "Two Suns
in the Sunset" suggest, is how
we will feel during those few
seconds between seeing the
atomic flash of a nuclear
holocaustand our subsequent,
immediate deaths. Sure, there
are other moments of morbid
gestures in the album ("it can't
be much fun for them beneath
the rising sun, with all their
kids committing suicide"). But
the intention is clear enough:
Waters just doesn't want to
take life for granted, and is
pointing out how often the
thought of death never even
occurs to us — most signifi
cantly when we so boldly enlist
to fight in war.
Let us not forget David Gil
mour, whose superb guitar
leads have improved The Wall
even more since — even
though his songwriting has
temporarily been suspended.
Nick Mason, Floyd's drummer,
maintains a sense of perfect
timing, driving the album
powerfully. Waters' musical
talents, as well, once again de
fies the laws of bass guitars.
Despite the loss of the group's
keyboardist, Richard Wright,
keyboards ironically figure
more in this album than in any
of their others. So much, then,
for Richard Wright.
Overall, however, Waters
deserves all the honors for this
album. His is a genious which
stands out loud and clear —
improving with each new re
cord. As in all their works,
Waters has structured this one
to be pessimistic, but not
overbearingly depressing.
Perhaps the man does have an
overflowing sense of justice
and a touch of paranoia, but his
fears and cynicism lead to a
common theme: there are no
solutions to the atrocities of
the world, just watch out and
be careful of whatever you do
— for this next step may be
your last.
No one thought they would
do it. I didn't either — although
I prayed they would. Finally,
after four years of anticipation,
Pink Floyd has belted out
another one. Anyone would
have been satisfied with an
alburn as good as The Wall, but
Floyd's The Final Cut far excels
its preceding classic and yes, is
probably even better than Dark
Side of the Moon. But let us not
forget how we said "Nothing
can top The Wall" and "they
should quit now while they're
ahead." That argument, which
could have equally been used
after Dark Side came out in '73,
thus seems to be unqualified
reasoning.
Subtitling the album "A Re
quiem for the Post-War
Dream," Roger Waters, Floyd's
main songwriter, shows his in
fatuation with war and its at
rocities — perhaps instigated
by his father's death in WWII.
But he shares this infatuation
with no one; in fact, he writes
all the songs to the album —
the final culmination to his
gradual take-over of the band
which started with Dark Side.
Despite this, the music does
not become bland. All the
songs reveal Floyd's typical
originality and technical in
genuity: varying from a simple
yet eerie guitar strumming
song to a wild and shocking
Indian-flavored masterpiece.
The album has something any
faithful Pink Floyd fan could
ever want: the lyrics and vocals
of Animals, the cynicism of
"Have a Cigar" in Wish You
Were Here, the background
sound effects on The Wall (this
time replacing helicopters with
F-15s) and use of other musi
cians (a tenor sax, female choir
and a philharmonic orchestra)
as found in Dark Side.
But to say Final Cut is a re
hash of earlier material is
equally unqualified: Waters is
dealing with something else

here — his own powertul emo
tions. A sense of hostility and a
basic anti-life view prevails all
over the record, and the
songwriter has really put him
self in a potentially dangerous
position with his extremism.
Fortunately, he contains it well
and the album thus has an
eerie, bitingly sarcastic tone
(although Waters seems to
have a fetish about pronounc
ing his consonants). The al
bum's front looks hideous, I
know, but we must not judge
an album by its cover.
The record starts off strong.
Waters simply questions the
ideals and purposes of the
modern age. "Whatever hap
pened to the post-war dream?"
he asks "Maggie" — that is,
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of England, of course.
Things now aren't the way they
were all set up to be. All we
have are unfulfilled hopes and
shattered dreams. The drab
and ordinary kitchen noises
immediately following the
song adds to the revulsion of
the humdrum life and unkept
promises.
"Your Possible Pasts," prob
ably one of the album's most
innovative songs, is one of re
trospect, telling unnamed sol
diers what they could have
done in lieu of fighting,
"strung out behind us the ban
ners and flags of our possible
pasts lie in tatters and rags."
The song is a real Floydian
shocker; sudden and gripping,
ending unexpectedly and
blending into the tick-tock of a
clock — Pink Floyd's famous
representation of time wasted.
In an almost Brechtian
mode, "One of the Few" is a
simple song — a chilling recipe
on how to produce willing sol
diers out of men: "Make them
me, make them you/ Make
them do what you want them
to/ Make 'em laugh, make
them cry, make them lie down
and die."

By far, Floyd's "The Hero's
Return" is their greatest tech
nical triumph: twisting guitars
to sound like shooting arrows,
synthesizers and a new step in
stereo — " holophonics,"
which gives any stereo an
added third-dimensional qual
ity to the music. The song itself
is not bad either: a vicious at
tack on social pressures to
maintain manliness and reject
emotions. "Even now part of
me flies over Dresden . . .
though they'll never fathom it,
behind my sarcasm desperate
memories lie." David Cilmour
here plays a fantastic sliding
guitar, while the song's wisp
and haunting style manages to
portray the perfect madman,
whose next moves we can
never predict.
Utopias are unattainable, as
we all know, and"The Gun
ners Dream" (sic) mocks hold
ing on to such fantasies. Wat
ers cynically screams out
"Hold on to the dream," the
last word of which drowns into
a sax solo, making the vocals
and sax indistinguishable from
each other. The song is beauti
ful and flawlessly performed
and although it is depressing,
asks us to treat social un
pieasantries at face value.
The second side, however,
differs just a tad. Suddenly,
enter Brezhnev, Begin and Gal
tieri, and of course "Maggie."
We hear Pink Floyd reacting,
unlike in any of their other al
bums to the more recent
events of 1982: a TV commen
tator discusses the aftermath of
the Falklands conflict, and
Waters dreams of a place
where "maniacs don't blow
holes in bandsmen by remote
control." Begin takes Beirut
and Brezhnev takes Afghanis
tan. Is this, then, a drawback?
Perhaps so, since such inci
dents will lose their political
impact with time. Neverthe
less, the famed British com
poser has a marvelous time

putting all of today's world
leaders in "The Fletcher
Memorial Home," a fictitious
old-politicians home "for in
curable tyrants and kings."
"Southampton Dock" is a
beautiful, simple song noting
how the country (here, En
gland) uses its soldiers: "and
when the fight was over/ We
spent what they had made."
This, Waters explains, is the
Final Cut — the incurred injus
tice, the mistreatment of any
body in war.
The title track, which im
mediately follows, is, well,
quite simply fantastic. By com
paring anyone's attempt to
achieve anything to a man try
ing to break through various
protective barriers to reach a
safe, Waters conveys the same
odd atmosphere of paranoia
and alienation which charac
terized The Wall. The song
deals with fears, the conse
quences of exposing fears, and
unrealized "hallucinations."
That is not, however, all that
resembles The Wall. In fact, the
song is eerily reminiscent of
"Comfortably Numb," but
maintains its own distinctive
sound all the same.
"Not Now John," probably
the album's nastiest and most
cynical cut, makes a great
parody of modern nations'
ever-increasing paranoias of
each other and their lusts for
conquering to prove to them
selves, if not others, their pro
wess: "Got to bring the Rus
sian bear to his knees/ Well,
maybe not the Russian bear/
Maybe the Swedes/ We
showed Argentina/ Now let's
go and show these/ Make us
feel tough/ Oh, wouldn't Mag
gie be pleased."
The album ends on a soft
note, as Floyd is known to do.
But midway through the last
song, Waters lurches into
black humor in describing the
last-minute thoughts of a car
driver just before he rams into

a truck. This, as the "Two Suns
in the Sunset" suggest, is how
we will feel during those few
seconds between seeing the
atomic flash of a nuclear
holocaustand our subsequent,
immediate deaths. Sure, there
are other moments of morbid
