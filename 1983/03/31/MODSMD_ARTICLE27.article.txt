# Robbing the grave for some shy romance, good rock

### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Buddy Holly. The name con
jures up thoughts of the spirit
of early rock and roll. The
dark-rimmed glasses, the hic
cupping voice, the joyful guitar
fills, the streamlined har
monies — all of these were
trademarks of Buddy Holly in
his all too brief career from
1956 to 1959. But for one whose

importance was so great, his
accomplishments have tended
to be overlooked. Holly wrote
numerous rock classics includ
ing "That'll Be The Day"and
"Peggy Sue," but most listen
ers have rarely heard these
originals. Instead, it is the
many cover versions of his
songs that he inspired, which
are his legacy. These covers in
clude the Beatles' "Words Of
Love," the Rolling Stones' and
Grateful Dead's "Not Fade
Away," Blind Faith's "Well All
Right" and Linda Ronstadt's

"It's So Easy," which all show a
deep love and appreciation for
Holly.
His influence, though, is
even more apparent in the re
cent rockabilly revival of the
'80s. The Blasters and the Stray
Cats would not be around were
it not for Holly. Therefore, For
The First Time Anywhere is a
rare treasure that will initiate
the new listener into Holly's
frantic and playful rockabilly
style, along with presenting
the undoctored, original mas
tertape versions of his earliest
recordings to the Holly collec
tor. These versions, as the
album title states, have never
been released in their original
form. Some had been previ
ously released in overdubbed
versions with disastrously
added orchestrations and in
strumentations, but here, the
recordings present Holly as he
intended himself to be heard.
The results are fascinating and
vital to understanding why
rock music is still captivating
years after the music sup
posedly died.
The majority of the songs are
from 1956 when Holly was just

starting out with his band, the.
Crickets. Their style is simple
and basic (guitar, bass and
drums) in the rockabilly tradi
tion set forth by Elvis Presley in
his legendary Sun Session re
cordings from 1954 and 1955.
One can hear the influence of
Presley on the version of "Baby
Won't You Come Out To
night,"' where Holly thor
oughly imitates the raw in
strumentation and quavering
quality of voice that charac
terizes Presley's Sun Session
recordings, especially "Baby
Let's Play House." However,
though Presley's influence on
Holly was immeasurable, Holly
still derived a singularly,
unique rockabilly style that en
abled him to develop into one
of rock's foremost songwriters
of the '50s.
One can first hear this crea
tive style on an unreleased,
first version of Holly's classic
hit, "Maybe Baby." It is here,
that Holly goes beyond the
dirty sexuality inherent behind
Presley's sound, and produces
a style that suggests a more
shy, playful and teasing sen
suality. lust the irony present

in the lyrics — "Maybe baby,
I'll have you; Maybe baby,
you'll be true; Maybe baby, I'll
have you for me" — added a
twist that enabled his music to
take on a bashful romantic
quality. Yet still, Holly was able
to convey the underlying ex
citement and tension behind
his romantic visions of love
with kinetic and powerful in
strumentation. Such straight
forward rockabilly tunes such
as "Rock-a-Bye Rock" or "I'm
Gonna Set My Foot Right
Down" (which, unsurprisingly,
sounds exactly like the Stray
Cats' recent hit, "Rock This
Town") have the rollicking
qualities that one associates
with the finest dance bands.
The most memorable works
on this album, though, are
cover versions done by Holly
himself. "Brown-Eyed Hand
some Man" is a remake of a
Chuck Berry standard, but

Holly shows himself to be a
consummate musician in his
frenetic guitar work which
matches the pure sexual pump
of the lyrics ("Ever since the
world began, there's been a
whole lot of good women
shedding tears for that
brown-eyed handsome man").
The other cover is Bo
Diddley's classic, "Bo
Diddley." Here, Holly really
shows off his musical inven
tiveness. Instead of copying
the original, Holly turns it into
an acoustic rave-up. He places
less emphasis on the song's
famous tom-tom beat, and in
stead, heightens the song's
drive through his non-stop
acoustic guitar strumming and
an atypical slow-paced, yet
emotionally packed, instru
mental break.
The album, therefore, cap
tures a Holly that would be as
vital to the '80s as he was in the

'50s. His rockabilly roots are
represented to the fore on this
album and they are the key to
its success.(On thealbum's two
lush ballads, Holly fails to cap
tivate, so one's attention is di
rected towards the more fast
paced numbers). Hopefully,
the pleasurable and timeless
qualities of these songs will
generate enough listeners to
purchase this album. )ust a
single listen to this album
would make one realize that it
should have been Holly (and
Eddie Cochran and Carl Per
kins, etc.) that one was listen
ing to rather than those re
treads and copiers like the
Stray Cats. Holly must be re
membered as one of the best
and foremost rockabilly musi
cians. So the next time your
local radio station plays some
Stray Cats, call up to ask for
some equal time for Buddy
Holly.
