# LSAT blamed
## Law applications plummet 
### TROY EID Staff writer 
Applications to Stanford Law
School have decreased sharply due
primarily to scoring changes in the
national Law School Admissions Test
(LSAT), according to Law Prof. )ack.
Friedenthal, chairman of the admis
sions committee.
As of March 15, applications to the
Law School declined 22 percent from
a year ago, to 3357 from 4324 for 172
positions in the first-year class.
"I think the great bulk of this de
cline can be traced to the LSATs,"
Friedenthal said. "The tests discour
aged a lot of people from applying
who may have been qualified."
Informal checks with other top law
schools indicate similar declines,
Friedenthal said. He also noted the
possibility of corresponding in
creases in applications "at some les
ser law schools."
The drop in applications stems
from faulty scoring in the top range
of the new LSATs which led many
students to conclude that their
scores were not high enough to get
them into top law schools.
"The original (LSAT) figures were
based on one sample taken last
June," Friedenthal said. "Since then
there have been three samples."
Until June 1982, the LSAT was
based on a 200-800 point scale, but
the new test is scored between 10
and 50. With the old test, Friedenthal
said students with a score below 700
could not expect to be accepted at

Stanford Law School. A score of 47 on
the new test was originally believed
to correspond to the same percentile
and therefore the University's gen
eral policy was to accept only stu
dents with a 47 or better.
However, a score of 40 proved
equivalent to about the 91st percen
tile of those taking the test, instead of
the 90th percentile as it should have
been had the calculations been accu
rate. Between scores of 40and 50, the
median was expected to be 45. "In
stead of being the median, a 45 was
actually well above the median,"
Friedenthal said. "The original Stan
ford cut-off was 47, but the score ac
tually needed was 45."
Since the original LSAT percentiles
"were substantially off" the actual
median, Friedenthal noted the pos
sibility of "dramatic changes" in ap
plications to top law schools among
students who scored in the low 40's
on the test.
"I think many of these students
applied to lesser schools because
they thought they didn't have a
chance to get in here," he said.
According to Friedenthal, LSAT
scoring has recently been revised to
accommodate data from all three
samples. The Princeton, New
Jersey-based firm issued apologies
following the discovery of the "inac
curate" test scaling," he said.
Stanford was not responsible for
the LSAT's misleading scoring, Frie
denthal stressed. "It's not our fault,"
he said. "People made up their own

minds where to apply."
The change in LSAT scoring corre
sponds with a "slightly altered" test,
Friedenthal said. "The test was
thought to have a little too strict
mathematical analysis," he ex
plained. "They've substituted more
intellectual reasoning in place of it to
try to indicate the same type of skills.
"I think LSAT was lookingfora new
beginning," he said. "Dozens and
dozens of people were scoring
800s." By contrast, Friedenthal
claimed that "someone has yet to get
a 50" on the new test.

The Law School "isn't concerned"
about the shrinkingapplication pool,
Friedenthal stressed. "We have too
many applications," he said. He con
trasted the Law School's overall de
cline in applications with a record in
crease in minority applications. By
mid-March, the Law School had re
ceived 395 minority applications, up
15 from a year ago.
Widespread publicity that "law is
no longer an open field," with "an
overabundance of people pounding
the pavement" is "not true for
graduates at the top schools," he
said.
"Law is a marketable skill," Frie
denthal added. "Unlike other
graduate studies, people look to law
for high-paying jobs. That's not
going to change."
Friedenthal cited other factors to
account for the decrease in applica
tions to the most competitive law
schools, including economic condi
tions and higher costs. "There's no
question it's tougher to go," he ad
mitted. "That's true anywhere. Stan
ford tries very hard to find money for
those in need."
The sharp drop in Law School ap
plications contrasts with the other
Stanford professional schools. Busi
ness School applications are holding
about even with lastyear, while other
business schools are reporting a 5 to
10 percent decline. Applications to
the Medical School M.D. program
are running roughly 5 percent below
last year, accompanied by a slight na
tional decline in the number of stu
dents taking the Medical College
Admissions Tests (MCATs).
