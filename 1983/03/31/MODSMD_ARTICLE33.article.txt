No Daily
Because of Easter weekend, there
will be no Daily published Monday.
Like write
Oh my god, you know it's like so
tubular to write for a campus news
paper like, you know, the Daily. So
like stop by, you know, in a mini-skirt
or like some 501s, and say, "Gag me
with a story assignment." It's a totally
awesome experience, you know?

Sign-up
ASSU candidates and COP slates
"wishing to be considered for a Daily
endorsement must sign up at the
Daily office for an interview time.
Groups are encouraged to sign up
for an interview as well.
Go to class
The Daily may be on holiday Mon
day, but classes are still in session.
Sorry. . .
