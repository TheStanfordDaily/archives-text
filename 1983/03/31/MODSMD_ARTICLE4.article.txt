# '82 grads give University mixed grades

Although 94 percent of graduating 1981-82
Stanford seniors surveyed rated the overall qual
ity of a Stanford undergraduate education as
"good" or "excellent," areas of dissatisfaction —
including adequacy of faculty, staff and general
liberal education — were evident.
The senior survey is an annual effort by the
Office of the Vice-Provost for Undergraduate
Education to assess the retrospective views of
seniors concerning various aspects of their un
dergraduate experience.
Although the survey's report concluded that
students had a "globally positive view" of their
undergraduate education here, the faculty on
average as teachers received only 63 percent
high ratings and 9 percent of the students rated
them as being "poor" or "very poor." This par
ticularly violated initial expections of students,
with 36 percent of students reporting that faculty
were "worse" or "much worse" than expected.
According to John Boli, research coordinator
for the vice-provost for undergraduate educa
tion, who was responsible for analyzing the sur
vey responses, these statistics are probably true.

"It's no secret that the University puts more em
phasis on research than teaching."
Boli said he hopes that the results of the survey
will cause the University to give more emphasis
to teaching than it presently does, and explained
that teaching is not the only factor in evaluating
overall educational experience. "What you get
out of an undergraduate education is related to a
lot of other things besides teachers. Stanford
presents a valuable degree that opens a lot of
doors not open to students of other schools."
Boli also cited positive experiences in dorms,
overseas campuses and the large variety of
extra-curricular activities as playing a big part in
the overall picture of a Stanford education.
Norm Robinson, acting dean of the Office of
Student Affairs, agreed, explaining that "seeing
people on the cutting edge of their fields, and
informal interactions with faculty" are also very
important to students.
Members of the faculty were clearly well re
garded as scholars and researchers, receiving a 93
percent high rating, and the opportunities for indi
vidual work with faculty were considered great.
However, as advisers, especially for unde

clared freshmen and sophomores, the faculty
were rated "poor" or "very poor" by 46 percent
of the students surveyed, and 58 percent said
their advisers were "worse" or "much worse"
than expected.
801 l agreed, saying, "Advising is a real prob
lem." He explained that it is difficult to get pro
fessors to be advisers voluntarily, and said he
hopes the problem will get better. "The people
running the advising system are doing every
thing they can to improve the program," he said.
The adequacy of Stanford's general liberal
education received only 68 percent high ratings,
and only 42 percent of the students felt that they
had a "good" or "excellent" understanding of
western culture. Furthermore, the degree of im
provement in understanding western culture at
Stanford was only 35 percent.
These findings provide further evidence of the
necessity of the recent revision of the western
culture requirement. According to Boli, senior
survey results have never directly prompted
changes in University policy, but are used to
monitor the impact of policy decisions.
