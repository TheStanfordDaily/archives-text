# Quarter system maintained
## Panel suggests 15-week classes 
### MARK GILLIS 
An ad hoc committee appointed by
the Faculty Senate to study the ques
tion of switching to the semester sys
tem recommended at the end of
winter quarter that individual de
partments experiment with 15-week
classes but that the University in
general stay on the quarter system.
The committee, headed by Reli
gious Studies Prof. Edwin Good, was
formed to research and discuss the
possibilities of lengthening courses
according to the needs of individual
departments. Good said, "We rec
ommended ways for deans to get
around the shortcomings of the
quarter system."
The committee could not recom
mend a general change to the semes
ter system, Good said because,
"There is a majority (of professors)
that prefers to teach in this system."
It did, however, encourage indi
vidual departments to experiment
wi»h classes that can extend into a

second quarter.
laqueline Bryan, assistant to the
Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
said that coordinating classes of vary
ing lengths can be effective. "Con
ceptually, it's all there. The change
would just require some extremely
careful planning," she said.
One of the alternatives being dis
cussed within the University is the
Colub system in which academic
years would be divided into six equal
parts so that quarters and semesters
would have common divisions of five
weeks per golub. The system would
accommodate some computer sci
ence classes which only require five
weeks to finish, regular 10 week clas
ses, and any extended class that
would take 15 weeks.
German Studies Prof.Gerald Gilles
pie expressed concern that long
term uncoordinated experimenta
tion could create big problems for
students. He said the Golub system
could be a mess, causing students

trouble in "following their required
curriculum and taking the necessary
courses in order."
Gillespie said he is also concerned
that if departments staggered their
courses differently it would be very
difficult for students to coordinate
taking classes in more than one area
at a time. "The semester system
would have some advantages for the
humanities students, but it's not
worth agonizing over the problem
with too much experimentation."
Although the introduction of the
semester system would not solve all
of the problems of the quarter sys
tem, several professors said they be
lieve it would be advantageous for
their students.
"I think the quarter system hurts
some students in my classes," Good
said. "I get the feeling that if they had
more time to let the material soak in
they would do betterand write better
papers. It's the kind of learning that
involves maturity in taking many

things into account from what you've
read."
Good compared the difference to
letting the material simmer instead of
cramming it in.
Good said the brevity of the quar
ters makes it difficult to do readings
with sufficient depth and reflection

which makes it harder to write good
papers. "Maybe a full quarter can be
spent on the class work and half a
quarter spent for research and paper
writing," Good said. "I don't think
the process of learning in the
humanities is well served by the
quarter system."
The quarter system was intro
duced at Stanford in 1917 to improve
flexibility by adding the summer
term so that students and prn*f"" lift
could take any quarter off they
wished. Good said, "They thought it
might create different patterns of
teaching, but it just hasn't happened
that way."
