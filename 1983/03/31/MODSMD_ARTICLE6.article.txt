# ASSU denies request for Speakers Bureau fee
## 
### JANE McCONNELL Staff writer 
The Speakers Bureau has been denied its request to be placed on the
ASSU fee assessment ballot because of a failure to comply with the election
commission rules, despite the fact that the group had enough student body
support to obtain a place on the ballot.
Because the Speakers Bureau did not file a declaration of intent form — an
official statement saying an organization is going to run and an agreement to
abide by the campaign practices code and rules of the commission — by the
March 11 deadline, the fee assessment request was denied.
According to Craig Spearman, ASSU election commissioner, a group must
meet two requirements to earn a place on the ballot: getting 10 percent of
the student body to sign a petition supporting the group's place on the ballot
and filing the declaration of intent.
"The Senate has tried to put rules before purpose," said Susan Jones, head
of the Speakers Bureau. "To deny the existence of one of the most popular
and successful organizations on campus because of a simple legality is
ridiculous."
The loss of its fee assessment will force the Speakers Bureau to cut back its
program for next year. "We'll be able to have at the most three or four
relatively unknown speakers," lones said.
In previous years, the Speakers Bureau has had a $40,000 budget with which to
work, according to Jones. "This year, we'll be lucky if we can raise $10,000," she
said.
Speakers Bureau memberTed Wheeler, who was responsible for handling
the fee assessment campaign for the group, said, "It was an unfortunate
mistake. Obviously I don't feel very good about it."
According to Wheeler, he was chosen rather than Jones to handle the
campaign because of the time committment it involved. "This whole thing
about getting petitions signed was a total surprise to us," he said, since this is
the first year that every group had to get signatures to earn a place on the
ballot.
"We had more than an ample number of signatures," said Jones. "The
Speakers Bureau has passed by the largest margin every year."
Currently the Speakers Bureau is working on getting some funding
through the association fee, which is a separate funding reserved for small
organizations. "We should be able to get that," said Jones. "We are also
talking to the people in the ASSU to see if they'll reconsider."
All other groups that applied for places on the fee assessment ballot were
approved.
