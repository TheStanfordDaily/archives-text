NATO lauds Reagan's proposal
Bonn, West Germany — The United States' West
European allies hailed President Reagan's proposal
yesterday for an interim agreement with the Soviet
Union on land-based middle-range nuclear missiles
and called upon the Soviet Union to respond favor
ably to the offer.
The agreement would "substantially reduce" the
number of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Eu
rope to an equal number on both sides.
Reagan, who had been under pressure from North
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to offer an alter
native to his "zero-option" proposal that the Soviets
had rejected, emphasized that his ultimate goal still is
total elimination of such weapons.
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that the

proposal "opens a wide range of possibilities" for
breaking the 16-month deadlock in U.S.-Soviet arms
talks in Geneva, Switzerland.
Kohl said in a statement that he was disappointed
that the Soviet Union has refused to agree to a total
ban on all middle-range weapons as initially pro
posed by the president, but said the interim offer call
ing for reduced deployment by both sides should be
welcomed as a move toward the goal of a total ban.
A statement from British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's office said that an interim agreement that
would reduce the warheads on such weapons would
contribute to East-West stability and security. The
statement pledged Britain's "wholehearted support"
for the proposal.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization head
quarters in Brussels, Belgium, said in a statement that

it was now up to the Soviet Union to take up the offer
"in an effort to reach a militarily significant, equitable
and verifiable agreement in Geneva at the earliest
possible date."
In Paris, the French External Relations Ministry de
clared that France could "only be pleased by all the
efforts undertaken towards a satisfactory conclusion
which conforms to the interests of Europe."
The president's offer was seen as meeting West Eu
ropean objections to the "zero option" and coun
tering the widespread belief that the Reagan adminis
tration was inflexible on the missiles issue.
The zero option, which has been repeatedly re
jected by Moscow, calls for the Soviet Union to scrap
all of its 600 land-based middle-range missiles aimed
against targets in Europe and Asia. In return, NATO
would abandon plans to begin deployment in De

cember of 572 Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in
Western Europe.
Under Reagan's proposal, even if the Soviets
agreed to reduce their missiles, the United States
would proceed with its plan to begin deploying cruise
and Pershing 2 missiles in five European countries in
December to counter the Soviet buildup of missiles
aimed at NATO countries.
Indian demand for water denied
Washington— In a sweeping victory for the Metro
politan Water District of Southern California, the Su
preme Court voted 5 to 3 yesterday to reject requests
by five Indian tribes to obtain larger amounts of water
from the Colorado River.
The justices overturned a previous finding by a special
master that the tribes were entitled to a much greater share
of water than they obtained in 1964 when the Supreme Court
first parceled out allotments to water from the lower Colo
rado basin. The Metropolitan Water District, several other
California water agencies and state officials in California, Ari
zona and Nevada had all urged the Supreme Court to throw
out the master's report.
In an opinion for the court, justice Byron White said an in
crease in water for the Indian tribes "cannot help but ex
acerbate potential water shortage problems" for Southern
California and for the still-unfinished Central Arizona
Project. The three dissenters protested repeatedly that the
ruling perpetuated a "manifest injustice" for the Indian
tribes.
Officials for the Metropolitan Water District, the agency
responsible for obtaining Colorado River water for both the
Los Angeles and San Diego areas, said the decision effective
ly restores the district's access to 82,000 acre-feet of water a
year — the amount that would have been lost if the master's
report by U.S. Senior Circuit judge Elbert Tuttle had been
upheld. An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, the amount of
water necessary to cover an acre of land to a depth of one
foot.
The Metropolitan Water District now uses about 700,000t0
800,000 acre-feet of water annually from the Colorado River.
The ruling represented the latest chapter in the long
standing effort by the Supreme Court to settle disputes over
Colorado River water. The litigation dates back to 1952,
when Arizona asked the justices to limit California's use of
water from the river.
England plans oil price cut
London — Britain yesterday proposed cutting the price of
its North Sea oil by up to 75 cents, a reduction intended to
keep it competitive on world markets without provoking an
other crisis among producers about falling prices.
The state-owned British National Oil Co. offered buyers of
its Brent Field output a 50-cent reduction, with other grades
to drop by 75 cents. Last month, BNOC cut all North Sea
prices to $30.50, a reduction of S3 from the prevailing price,
but many customers said the figure still is too high.
That British action led to an emergency meeting of the Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which
earlier this month set a lower price and production schedule
for OPEC oil. The meeting set the price of Nigerian oil, which
competes directly with Britain's, at $30 and warned that
further price cuts by Britain could lead to a price-cutting
free-for-all.
The latest British pricing plan emerged after extensive
consultations with principal buyers. Assumingthe plan is ap
proved, it will bring British and Nigerian oil essentially into
parity. OPEC spokesmen have said that a cut of the size an
nounced yesterday should not set off a price war.
Nigeria's attitude, however, is crucial. Reports from Lagos
in recent days have indicated disagreement among Nigerian
officials about whether to insist on a lower price than Brit
ain's, no matter what the British plan is. Nigeria's economy
has been hurt seriously by the slump in global oil sales, and
even at reduced prices, output is thought to be running
below the minimum neccesary to meet Nigeria's revenue
needs.
Senators urge weapons withdrawal
Washington — Fifteen U.S. senators called on the Reagan
administration yesterday to withdraw from Western Europe
a substantial number of tactical nuclear weapons such as
land mines and artillery shells that they described as without
"a practical concept of usage."
In a letter to the president, they contended that such an

initiative would not upset delicate negotiations with the So
viet Union on the reduction of nuclear-tipped missiles
deployed by both the East and the West, but instead would
enhance the United States' standing as the leader of the
Western alliance.
Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), who drafted the three-page
letter, commended Reagan for the new initiative to the Sovi
ets, but he said that he believed that one-third of the West's
tactical nuclear explosives, whose use mainly would be lim
ited to Western Europe, could be dismantled without dam
aging the West's military posture.
"A military justification for overhauling NATO's short
range nuclear posture has been recognized for more than a
decade, the senators contended in their letter, which was re
leased right after Reagan had outlined his new proposal for
an interim tactical missile agreement with the Soviets.
Part of a tactical European arsenal totaling 5000 to 6000 nu
clear explosive devices, the short-range weapons were de
scribed not only impractical but also as in "danger of acci
dent, theft, or misuse."
Senators signing the letter included 11 Democrats, and
four Republicans, members of either the Foreign Relations
or Armed Services Committee.
Hondurans abandon towns
Tegicigalpa, Honduras —Hundreds of poor Honduran vil
lagers were reported fleeing their homes along the
Nicaraguan border yesterday, fearing attacks by leftist
Nicaragua's army in retaliation for attacks by rightist exiles
based in Honduras.
Eighty residents of the tense Choluteca border zone, on
the Gulf of Fonseca between Nicaragua and El Salvador, peti
tioned President Roberto Suazo Cordova for troop rein
forcements. They claimed Nicaragua's Sandinista govern
ment had put 1500 troops on the other side of the border.
The petition said hundreds of peasants have been leaving
their villages in recent weeks, fearing fighting would break
out.
The Sandinistas "are constantly watching our every move
ment," said the petitioners."We cannot live, we cannot
work, we cannot breathe in a ... climate charged with tension
due to constant incursions by air and overland by
Nicaragua's Sandinista guards."
There was no immediate comment from the Honduran
government, which has 400 soldiers patrollingtheCholuteca
area.
Shooting across the border has been reported frequently,
and the government claims the Sandinistas have been smug
gling weapons through the area to leftist r ebels fighting the
U.S.-supported conservative government of El Salvador. It
reported Tuesday that an army patrol intercepted 12
Nicaraguan soldiers last week near Nacaome, 52 miles from
the Nicaraguan border, with a "large amount" of weapons.
Economic growth slows
Washington — The government's index of leading in
dicators rose in February for the sixth month in a row, signal
ing a continued recovery but at a slower pace than January's
fast takeoff, the Department of Commerce reported yester
day.
The 1.4 percent rise in the index, on the heels of a spec
tacular 3.5 percent jump in the opening month of 1983, was
hailed as more "good news" by Secretary of Commerce
Malcolm Baldrige, while Secretary of the Treasury Donald
Regan termed it a sign that the upturn will be "solid and sus
tained."
Several private analysts, however, said that weak spots in
the economy were still retarding its advance and contended
that the strength of the snap-back from the recession that
started in mid-1981 cannot be gauged without more in
formation on whether consumer spending will start climbing
this spring.

In addition, a surge in the nation's money supply as
sociated with new forms of bank deposits apparently inflated
the index of leading indicators in both January and February.
Zambia president meets Reagan
Washington — One of Africa's senior leaders, President
Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, came away from two hours with
President Reagan yesterday saying the two men "share an
abhorrence of the apartheid system" of South Africa and
agree it should be ended quickly in the interest of peace, sta
bility and harmony in the region.
Kaunda, the first president of a "front-line state" near
South Africa to visit Washington in the Reagan adminis
tration, seemed happy about his meeting and luncheon at
the White House, praising the "warm hospitality" and saying
that a firm foundation had been laid for future relations.
Last October Kaunda said he had been shocked during a
1975 official visit when President Ford devoted only 45
minutes to discussions with him. On the other hand, Kaunda
praised President Carter for spending six hours with him dur
ing a 1978 visit.
Previously Kaunda had been critical both of Reagan and
his administration's policies, and openly indignant about re
ports that the administration considers South Africa to be a
friend.
Mideast bargaining hits impasse
Washington — Two weeks after Israeli Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's visit here raised hopes for early agreement
on withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon, the nego
tiations have become deadlocked again by what U.S. officials
say are unacceptable Israeli demands for security arrange
ments in southern Lebanon.
"We are one step away from being back to square one,"
one U.S. official, familiar with the negotiations, said yester
day in describing "a progressively negative" Israeli reaction
to the proposals for ensuring the security of Israel's northern
border made to Shamir by Secretary of State George Shultz.
Shamir, who conferred with Shultz for three days in mid-
March, returned home sounding optimistic about the
chances for a breakthrough. But, U.S. officials said yesterday,
in subsequent negotiations with President Reagan's special
Mideast envoy, Philip Habib, the Israelis have rejected the
idea that Lebanese forces can control terrorist activity in
southern Lebanon and have reiterated demands for arrange
ments unacceptable to Lebanese President Amin Gemayel.
Habib is expected to return here Thursday. He is coming
back partly for personal business, but the officials said he also
is expected to discuss with Reagan and Shultz possible new
U.S. steps for breaking the latest impasse.
Market bounces back after lull
New York — The stock market rebounded to near-record
highs yesterday with a rally spurred by signs of a continuing
economic recovery.
Energy and high-technology issues led the advance.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen
almost 15 points over the three previous sessions, climbed
12.10 to 1143.29. That left the average just short of the record
closing high of 1145.90 it reached last Thursday.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 75.80
million shares, against 65.30 million in the previous session.

ain's, no matter what the British plan is. Nigeria's economy
has been hurt seriously by the slump in global oil sales, and
even at reduced prices, output is thought to be running
below the minimum neccesary to meet Nigeria's revenue
needs.
Senators urge weapons withdrawal
Washington — Fifteen U.S. senators called on the Reagan
administration yesterday to withdraw from Western Europe
a substantial number of tactical nuclear weapons such as
land mines and artillery shells that they described as without
"a practical concept of usage."
In a letter to the president, they contended that such an

initiative would not upset delicate negotiations with the So
viet Union on the reduction of nuclear-tipped missiles
deployed by both the East and the West, but instead would
enhance the United States' standing as the leader of the
Western alliance.
Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), who drafted the three-page
letter, commended Reagan for the new initiative to the Sovi
ets, but he said that he believed that one-third of the West's
tactical nuclear explosives, whose use mainly would be lim
ited to Western Europe, could be dismantled without dam
aging the West's military posture.
"A military justification for overhauling NATO's short
range nuclear posture has been recognized for more than a
decade, the senators contended in their letter, which was re
leased right after Reagan had outlined his new proposal for
an interim tactical missile agreement with the Soviets.
Part of a tactical European arsenal totaling 5000 to 6000 nu
clear explosive devices, the short-range weapons were de
scribed not only impractical but also as in "danger of acci
dent, theft, or misuse."
Senators signing the letter included 11 Democrats, and
four Republicans, members of either the Foreign Relations
or Armed Services Committee.
Hondurans abandon towns
Tegicigalpa, Honduras —Hundreds of poor Honduran vil
lagers were reported fleeing their homes along the
Nicaraguan border yesterday, fearing attacks by leftist
Nicaragua's army in retaliation for attacks by rightist exiles
based in Honduras.
Eighty residents of the tense Choluteca border zone, on
the Gulf of Fonseca between Nicaragua and El Salvador, peti
tioned President Roberto Suazo Cordova for troop rein
forcements. They claimed Nicaragua's Sandinista govern
ment had put 1500 troops on the other side of the border.
The petition said hundreds of peasants have been leaving
their villages in recent weeks, fearing fighting would break
out.
The Sandinistas "are constantly watching our every move
ment," said the petitioners."We cannot live, we cannot
work, we cannot breathe in a ... climate charged with tension
due to constant incursions by air and overland by
Nicaragua's Sandinista guards."
There was no immediate comment from the Honduran
government, which has 400 soldiers patrollingtheCholuteca
area.
Shooting across the border has been reported frequently,
and the government claims the Sandinistas have been smug
gling weapons through the area to leftist r ebels fighting the
U.S.-supported conservative government of El Salvador. It
reported Tuesday that an army patrol intercepted 12
Nicaraguan soldiers last week near Nacaome, 52 miles from
the Nicaraguan border, with a "large amount" of weapons.
Economic growth slows
Washington — The government's index of leading in
dicators rose in February for the sixth month in a row, signal
ing a continued recovery but at a slower pace than January's
fast takeoff, the Department of Commerce reported yester
day.
The 1.4 percent rise in the index, on the heels of a spec
tacular 3.5 percent jump in the opening month of 1983, was
hailed as more "good news" by Secretary of Commerce
Malcolm Baldrige, while Secretary of the Treasury Donald
Regan termed it a sign that the upturn will be "solid and sus
tained."
Several private analysts, however, said that weak spots in
the economy were still retarding its advance and contended
that the strength of the snap-back from the recession that
started in mid-1981 cannot be gauged without more in
formation on whether consumer spending will start climbing
this spring.

In addition, a surge in the nation's money supply as
sociated with new forms of bank deposits apparently inflated
the index of leading indicators in both January and February.
Zambia president meets Reagan
Washington — One of Africa's senior leaders, President
Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, came away from two hours with
President Reagan yesterday saying the two men "share an
abhorrence of the apartheid system" of South Africa and
agree it should be ended quickly in the interest of peace, sta
bility and harmony in the region.
Kaunda, the first president of a "front-line state" near
South Africa to visit Washington in the Reagan adminis
tration, seemed happy about his meeting and luncheon at
the White House, praising the "warm hospitality" and saying
that a firm foundation had been laid for future relations.
Last October Kaunda said he had been shocked during a
1975 official visit when President Ford devoted only 45
minutes to discussions with him. On the other hand, Kaunda
praised President Carter for spending six hours with him dur
ing a 1978 visit.
Previously Kaunda had been critical both of Reagan and
his administration's policies, and openly indignant about re
ports that the administration considers South Africa to be a
friend.
Mideast bargaining hits impasse
Washington — Two weeks after Israeli Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's visit here raised hopes for early agreement
on withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon, the nego
tiations have become deadlocked again by what U.S. officials
say are unacceptable Israeli demands for security arrange
ments in southern Lebanon.
"We are one step away from being back to square one,"
one U.S. official, familiar with the negotiations, said yester
day in describing "a progressively negative" Israeli reaction
to the proposals for ensuring the security of Israel's northern
border made to Shamir by Secretary of State George Shultz.
Shamir, who conferred with Shultz for three days in mid-
March, returned home sounding optimistic about the
chances for a breakthrough. But, U.S. officials said yesterday,
in subsequent negotiations with President Reagan's special
Mideast envoy, Philip Habib, the Israelis have rejected the
idea that Lebanese forces can control terrorist activity in
southern Lebanon and have reiterated demands for arrange
ments unacceptable to Lebanese President Amin Gemayel.
Habib is expected to return here Thursday. He is coming
back partly for personal business, but the officials said he also
is expected to discuss with Reagan and Shultz possible new
U.S. steps for breaking the latest impasse.
Market bounces back after lull
New York — The stock market rebounded to near-record
highs yesterday with a rally spurred by signs of a continuing
economic recovery.
Energy and high-technology issues led the advance.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen
almost 15 points over the three previous sessions, climbed
12.10 to 1143.29. That left the average just short of the record
closing high of 1145.90 it reached last Thursday.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 75.80
million shares, against 65.30 million in the previous session.

NATO lauds Reagan's proposal
Bonn, West Germany — The United States' West
European allies hailed President Reagan's proposal
yesterday for an interim agreement with the Soviet
Union on land-based middle-range nuclear missiles
and called upon the Soviet Union to respond favor
ably to the offer.
The agreement would "substantially reduce" the
number of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Eu
rope to an equal number on both sides.
Reagan, who had been under pressure from North
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to offer an alter
native to his "zero-option" proposal that the Soviets
had rejected, emphasized that his ultimate goal still is
total elimination of such weapons.
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that the

proposal "opens a wide range of possibilities" for
breaking the 16-month deadlock in U.S.-Soviet arms
talks in Geneva, Switzerland.
Kohl said in a statement that he was disappointed
that the Soviet Union has refused to agree to a total
ban on all middle-range weapons as initially pro
posed by the president, but said the interim offer call
ing for reduced deployment by both sides should be
welcomed as a move toward the goal of a total ban.
A statement from British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's office said that an interim agreement that
would reduce the warheads on such weapons would
contribute to East-West stability and security. The
statement pledged Britain's "wholehearted support"
for the proposal.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization head
quarters in Brussels, Belgium, said in a statement that

it was now up to the Soviet Union to take up the offer
"in an effort to reach a militarily significant, equitable
and verifiable agreement in Geneva at the earliest
possible date."
In Paris, the French External Relations Ministry de
clared that France could "only be pleased by all the
efforts undertaken towards a satisfactory conclusion
which conforms to the interests of Europe."
The president's offer was seen as meeting West Eu
ropean objections to the "zero option" and coun
tering the widespread belief that the Reagan adminis
tration was inflexible on the missiles issue.
The zero option, which has been repeatedly re
jected by Moscow, calls for the Soviet Union to scrap
all of its 600 land-based middle-range missiles aimed
against targets in Europe and Asia. In return, NATO
would abandon plans to begin deployment in De

cember of 572 Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in
Western Europe.
Under Reagan's proposal, even if the Soviets
agreed to reduce their missiles, the United States
would proceed with its plan to begin deploying cruise
and Pershing 2 missiles in five European countries in
December to counter the Soviet buildup of missiles
aimed at NATO countries.
Indian demand for water denied
Washington— In a sweeping victory for the Metro
politan Water District of Southern California, the Su
preme Court voted 5 to 3 yesterday to reject requests
by five Indian tribes to obtain larger amounts of water
from the Colorado River.
The justices overturned a previous finding by a special
master that the tribes were entitled to a much greater share
of water than they obtained in 1964 when the Supreme Court
first parceled out allotments to water from the lower Colo
rado basin. The Metropolitan Water District, several other
California water agencies and state officials in California, Ari
zona and Nevada had all urged the Supreme Court to throw
out the master's report.
In an opinion for the court, justice Byron White said an in
crease in water for the Indian tribes "cannot help but ex
acerbate potential water shortage problems" for Southern
California and for the still-unfinished Central Arizona
Project. The three dissenters protested repeatedly that the
ruling perpetuated a "manifest injustice" for the Indian
tribes.
Officials for the Metropolitan Water District, the agency
responsible for obtaining Colorado River water for both the
Los Angeles and San Diego areas, said the decision effective
ly restores the district's access to 82,000 acre-feet of water a
year — the amount that would have been lost if the master's
report by U.S. Senior Circuit judge Elbert Tuttle had been
upheld. An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, the amount of
water necessary to cover an acre of land to a depth of one
foot.
The Metropolitan Water District now uses about 700,000t0
800,000 acre-feet of water annually from the Colorado River.
The ruling represented the latest chapter in the long
standing effort by the Supreme Court to settle disputes over
Colorado River water. The litigation dates back to 1952,
when Arizona asked the justices to limit California's use of
water from the river.
England plans oil price cut
London — Britain yesterday proposed cutting the price of
its North Sea oil by up to 75 cents, a reduction intended to
keep it competitive on world markets without provoking an
other crisis among producers about falling prices.
The state-owned British National Oil Co. offered buyers of
its Brent Field output a 50-cent reduction, with other grades
to drop by 75 cents. Last month, BNOC cut all North Sea
prices to $30.50, a reduction of S3 from the prevailing price,
but many customers said the figure still is too high.
That British action led to an emergency meeting of the Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which
earlier this month set a lower price and production schedule
for OPEC oil. The meeting set the price of Nigerian oil, which
competes directly with Britain's, at $30 and warned that
further price cuts by Britain could lead to a price-cutting
free-for-all.
The latest British pricing plan emerged after extensive
consultations with principal buyers. Assumingthe plan is ap
proved, it will bring British and Nigerian oil essentially into
parity. OPEC spokesmen have said that a cut of the size an
nounced yesterday should not set off a price war.
Nigeria's attitude, however, is crucial. Reports from Lagos
in recent days have indicated disagreement among Nigerian
officials about whether to insist on a lower price than Brit
ain's, no matter what the British plan is. Nigeria's economy
has been hurt seriously by the slump in global oil sales, and
even at reduced prices, output is thought to be running
below the minimum neccesary to meet Nigeria's revenue
needs.

Shamir, who conferred with Shultz for three days in mid-
March, returned home sounding optimistic about the
chances for a breakthrough. But, U.S. officials said yesterday,
in subsequent negotiations with President Reagan's special
Mideast envoy, Philip Habib, the Israelis have rejected the
idea that Lebanese forces can control terrorist activity in
southern Lebanon and have reiterated demands for arrange
ments unacceptable to Lebanese President Amin Gemayel.
Habib is expected to return here Thursday. He is coming
back partly for personal business, but the officials said he also
is expected to discuss with Reagan and Shultz possible new
U.S. steps for breaking the latest impasse.
Market bounces back after lull
New York — The stock market rebounded to near-record
highs yesterday with a rally spurred by signs of a continuing
economic recovery.
Energy and high-technology issues led the advance.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen
almost 15 points over the three previous sessions, climbed
12.10 to 1143.29. That left the average just short of the record
closing high of 1145.90 it reached last Thursday.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 75.80
million shares, against 65.30 million in the previous session.

NATO lauds Reagan's proposal
Bonn, West Germany — The United States' West
European allies hailed President Reagan's proposal
yesterday for an interim agreement with the Soviet
Union on land-based middle-range nuclear missiles
and called upon the Soviet Union to respond favor
ably to the offer.
The agreement would "substantially reduce" the
number of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Eu
rope to an equal number on both sides.
Reagan, who had been under pressure from North
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to offer an alter
native to his "zero-option" proposal that the Soviets
had rejected, emphasized that his ultimate goal still is
total elimination of such weapons.
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that the

proposal "opens a wide range of possibilities" for
breaking the 16-month deadlock in U.S.-Soviet arms
talks in Geneva, Switzerland.
Kohl said in a statement that he was disappointed
that the Soviet Union has refused to agree to a total
ban on all middle-range weapons as initially pro
posed by the president, but said the interim offer call
ing for reduced deployment by both sides should be
welcomed as a move toward the goal of a total ban.
A statement from British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's office said that an interim agreement that
would reduce the warheads on such weapons would
contribute to East-West stability and security. The
statement pledged Britain's "wholehearted support"
for the proposal.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization head
quarters in Brussels, Belgium, said in a statement that

it was now up to the Soviet Union to take up the offer
"in an effort to reach a militarily significant, equitable
and verifiable agreement in Geneva at the earliest
possible date."
In Paris, the French External Relations Ministry de
clared that France could "only be pleased by all the
efforts undertaken towards a satisfactory conclusion
which conforms to the interests of Europe."
The president's offer was seen as meeting West Eu
ropean objections to the "zero option" and coun
tering the widespread belief that the Reagan adminis
tration was inflexible on the missiles issue.
The zero option, which has been repeatedly re
jected by Moscow, calls for the Soviet Union to scrap
all of its 600 land-based middle-range missiles aimed
against targets in Europe and Asia. In return, NATO
would abandon plans to begin deployment in De

cember of 572 Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in
Western Europe.
Under Reagan's proposal, even if the Soviets
agreed to reduce their missiles, the United States
would proceed with its plan to begin deploying cruise
and Pershing 2 missiles in five European countries in
December to counter the Soviet buildup of missiles
aimed at NATO countries.
Indian demand for water denied
Washington— In a sweeping victory for the Metro
politan Water District of Southern California, the Su
preme Court voted 5 to 3 yesterday to reject requests
by five Indian tribes to obtain larger amounts of water
from the Colorado River.
The justices overturned a previous finding by a special
master that the tribes were entitled to a much greater share
of water than they obtained in 1964 when the Supreme Court
first parceled out allotments to water from the lower Colo
rado basin. The Metropolitan Water District, several other
California water agencies and state officials in California, Ari
zona and Nevada had all urged the Supreme Court to throw
out the master's report.
In an opinion for the court, justice Byron White said an in
crease in water for the Indian tribes "cannot help but ex
acerbate potential water shortage problems" for Southern
California and for the still-unfinished Central Arizona
Project. The three dissenters protested repeatedly that the
ruling perpetuated a "manifest injustice" for the Indian
tribes.
Officials for the Metropolitan Water District, the agency
responsible for obtaining Colorado River water for both the
Los Angeles and San Diego areas, said the decision effective
ly restores the district's access to 82,000 acre-feet of water a
year — the amount that would have been lost if the master's
report by U.S. Senior Circuit judge Elbert Tuttle had been
upheld. An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, the amount of
water necessary to cover an acre of land to a depth of one
foot.
The Metropolitan Water District now uses about 700,000t0
800,000 acre-feet of water annually from the Colorado River.
The ruling represented the latest chapter in the long
standing effort by the Supreme Court to settle disputes over
Colorado River water. The litigation dates back to 1952,
when Arizona asked the justices to limit California's use of
water from the river.
England plans oil price cut
London — Britain yesterday proposed cutting the price of
its North Sea oil by up to 75 cents, a reduction intended to
keep it competitive on world markets without provoking an
other crisis among producers about falling prices.
The state-owned British National Oil Co. offered buyers of
its Brent Field output a 50-cent reduction, with other grades
to drop by 75 cents. Last month, BNOC cut all North Sea
prices to $30.50, a reduction of S3 from the prevailing price,
but many customers said the figure still is too high.
That British action led to an emergency meeting of the Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which
earlier this month set a lower price and production schedule
for OPEC oil. The meeting set the price of Nigerian oil, which
competes directly with Britain's, at $30 and warned that
further price cuts by Britain could lead to a price-cutting
free-for-all.
The latest British pricing plan emerged after extensive
consultations with principal buyers. Assumingthe plan is ap
proved, it will bring British and Nigerian oil essentially into
parity. OPEC spokesmen have said that a cut of the size an
nounced yesterday should not set off a price war.
Nigeria's attitude, however, is crucial. Reports from Lagos
in recent days have indicated disagreement among Nigerian
officials about whether to insist on a lower price than Brit
ain's, no matter what the British plan is. Nigeria's economy
has been hurt seriously by the slump in global oil sales, and
even at reduced prices, output is thought to be running
below the minimum neccesary to meet Nigeria's revenue
needs.
Senators urge weapons withdrawal
Washington — Fifteen U.S. senators called on the Reagan
administration yesterday to withdraw from Western Europe
a substantial number of tactical nuclear weapons such as
land mines and artillery shells that they described as without
"a practical concept of usage."
In a letter to the president, they contended that such an

initiative would not upset delicate negotiations with the So
viet Union on the reduction of nuclear-tipped missiles
deployed by both the East and the West, but instead would
enhance the United States' standing as the leader of the
Western alliance.
Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), who drafted the three-page
letter, commended Reagan for the new initiative to the Sovi
ets, but he said that he believed that one-third of the West's
tactical nuclear explosives, whose use mainly would be lim
ited to Western Europe, could be dismantled without dam
aging the West's military posture.
"A military justification for overhauling NATO's short
range nuclear posture has been recognized for more than a
decade, the senators contended in their letter, which was re
leased right after Reagan had outlined his new proposal for
an interim tactical missile agreement with the Soviets.
Part of a tactical European arsenal totaling 5000 to 6000 nu
clear explosive devices, the short-range weapons were de
scribed not only impractical but also as in "danger of acci
dent, theft, or misuse."
Senators signing the letter included 11 Democrats, and
four Republicans, members of either the Foreign Relations
or Armed Services Committee.
Hondurans abandon towns
Tegicigalpa, Honduras —Hundreds of poor Honduran vil
lagers were reported fleeing their homes along the
Nicaraguan border yesterday, fearing attacks by leftist
Nicaragua's army in retaliation for attacks by rightist exiles
based in Honduras.
Eighty residents of the tense Choluteca border zone, on
the Gulf of Fonseca between Nicaragua and El Salvador, peti
tioned President Roberto Suazo Cordova for troop rein
forcements. They claimed Nicaragua's Sandinista govern
ment had put 1500 troops on the other side of the border.
The petition said hundreds of peasants have been leaving
their villages in recent weeks, fearing fighting would break
out.
The Sandinistas "are constantly watching our every move
ment," said the petitioners."We cannot live, we cannot
work, we cannot breathe in a ... climate charged with tension
due to constant incursions by air and overland by
Nicaragua's Sandinista guards."
There was no immediate comment from the Honduran
government, which has 400 soldiers patrollingtheCholuteca
area.
Shooting across the border has been reported frequently,
and the government claims the Sandinistas have been smug
gling weapons through the area to leftist r ebels fighting the
U.S.-supported conservative government of El Salvador. It
reported Tuesday that an army patrol intercepted 12
Nicaraguan soldiers last week near Nacaome, 52 miles from
the Nicaraguan border, with a "large amount" of weapons.
Economic growth slows
Washington — The government's index of leading in
dicators rose in February for the sixth month in a row, signal
ing a continued recovery but at a slower pace than January's
fast takeoff, the Department of Commerce reported yester
day.
The 1.4 percent rise in the index, on the heels of a spec
tacular 3.5 percent jump in the opening month of 1983, was
hailed as more "good news" by Secretary of Commerce
Malcolm Baldrige, while Secretary of the Treasury Donald
Regan termed it a sign that the upturn will be "solid and sus
tained."
Several private analysts, however, said that weak spots in
the economy were still retarding its advance and contended
that the strength of the snap-back from the recession that
started in mid-1981 cannot be gauged without more in
formation on whether consumer spending will start climbing
this spring.

In addition, a surge in the nation's money supply as
sociated with new forms of bank deposits apparently inflated
the index of leading indicators in both January and February.
Zambia president meets Reagan
Washington — One of Africa's senior leaders, President
Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, came away from two hours with
President Reagan yesterday saying the two men "share an
abhorrence of the apartheid system" of South Africa and
agree it should be ended quickly in the interest of peace, sta
bility and harmony in the region.
Kaunda, the first president of a "front-line state" near
South Africa to visit Washington in the Reagan adminis
tration, seemed happy about his meeting and luncheon at
the White House, praising the "warm hospitality" and saying
that a firm foundation had been laid for future relations.
Last October Kaunda said he had been shocked during a
1975 official visit when President Ford devoted only 45
minutes to discussions with him. On the other hand, Kaunda
praised President Carter for spending six hours with him dur
ing a 1978 visit.
Previously Kaunda had been critical both of Reagan and
his administration's policies, and openly indignant about re
ports that the administration considers South Africa to be a
friend.
Mideast bargaining hits impasse
Washington — Two weeks after Israeli Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's visit here raised hopes for early agreement
on withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon, the nego
tiations have become deadlocked again by what U.S. officials
say are unacceptable Israeli demands for security arrange
ments in southern Lebanon.
"We are one step away from being back to square one,"
one U.S. official, familiar with the negotiations, said yester
day in describing "a progressively negative" Israeli reaction
to the proposals for ensuring the security of Israel's northern
border made to Shamir by Secretary of State George Shultz.
Shamir, who conferred with Shultz for three days in mid-

800,000 acre-feet of water annually from the Colorado River.
The ruling represented the latest chapter in the long
standing effort by the Supreme Court to settle disputes over
Colorado River water. The litigation dates back to 1952,
when Arizona asked the justices to limit California's use of
water from the river.
England plans oil price cut
London — Britain yesterday proposed cutting the price of
its North Sea oil by up to 75 cents, a reduction intended to
keep it competitive on world markets without provoking an
other crisis among producers about falling prices.
The state-owned British National Oil Co. offered buyers of
its Brent Field output a 50-cent reduction, with other grades
to drop by 75 cents. Last month, BNOC cut all North Sea
prices to $30.50, a reduction of S3 from the prevailing price,
but many customers said the figure still is too high.
That British action led to an emergency meeting of the Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which
earlier this month set a lower price and production schedule
for OPEC oil. The meeting set the price of Nigerian oil, which
competes directly with Britain's, at $30 and warned that
further price cuts by Britain could lead to a price-cutting
free-for-all.
The latest British pricing plan emerged after extensive
consultations with principal buyers. Assumingthe plan is ap
proved, it will bring British and Nigerian oil essentially into
parity. OPEC spokesmen have said that a cut of the size an
nounced yesterday should not set off a price war.
Nigeria's attitude, however, is crucial. Reports from Lagos
in recent days have indicated disagreement among Nigerian
officials about whether to insist on a lower price than Brit
ain's, no matter what the British plan is. Nigeria's economy
has been hurt seriously by the slump in global oil sales, and
even at reduced prices, output is thought to be running
below the minimum neccesary to meet Nigeria's revenue
needs.
Senators urge weapons withdrawal
Washington — Fifteen U.S. senators called on the Reagan
administration yesterday to withdraw from Western Europe
a substantial number of tactical nuclear weapons such as
land mines and artillery shells that they described as without
"a practical concept of usage."
In a letter to the president, they contended that such an

initiative would not upset delicate negotiations with the So
viet Union on the reduction of nuclear-tipped missiles
deployed by both the East and the West, but instead would
enhance the United States' standing as the leader of the
Western alliance.
Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), who drafted the three-page
letter, commended Reagan for the new initiative to the Sovi
ets, but he said that he believed that one-third of the West's
tactical nuclear explosives, whose use mainly would be lim
ited to Western Europe, could be dismantled without dam
aging the West's military posture.
"A military justification for overhauling NATO's short
range nuclear posture has been recognized for more than a
decade, the senators contended in their letter, which was re
leased right after Reagan had outlined his new proposal for
an interim tactical missile agreement with the Soviets.
Part of a tactical European arsenal totaling 5000 to 6000 nu
clear explosive devices, the short-range weapons were de
scribed not only impractical but also as in "danger of acci
dent, theft, or misuse."
Senators signing the letter included 11 Democrats, and
four Republicans, members of either the Foreign Relations
or Armed Services Committee.
Hondurans abandon towns
Tegicigalpa, Honduras —Hundreds of poor Honduran vil
lagers were reported fleeing their homes along the
Nicaraguan border yesterday, fearing attacks by leftist
Nicaragua's army in retaliation for attacks by rightist exiles
based in Honduras.
Eighty residents of the tense Choluteca border zone, on
the Gulf of Fonseca between Nicaragua and El Salvador, peti
tioned President Roberto Suazo Cordova for troop rein
forcements. They claimed Nicaragua's Sandinista govern
ment had put 1500 troops on the other side of the border.
The petition said hundreds of peasants have been leaving
their villages in recent weeks, fearing fighting would break
out.
The Sandinistas "are constantly watching our every move
ment," said the petitioners."We cannot live, we cannot
work, we cannot breathe in a ... climate charged with tension
due to constant incursions by air and overland by
Nicaragua's Sandinista guards."
There was no immediate comment from the Honduran
government, which has 400 soldiers patrollingtheCholuteca
area.
Shooting across the border has been reported frequently,
and the government claims the Sandinistas have been smug
gling weapons through the area to leftist r ebels fighting the
U.S.-supported conservative government of El Salvador. It
reported Tuesday that an army patrol intercepted 12
Nicaraguan soldiers last week near Nacaome, 52 miles from
the Nicaraguan border, with a "large amount" of weapons.
Economic growth slows
Washington — The government's index of leading in
dicators rose in February for the sixth month in a row, signal
ing a continued recovery but at a slower pace than January's
fast takeoff, the Department of Commerce reported yester
day.
The 1.4 percent rise in the index, on the heels of a spec
tacular 3.5 percent jump in the opening month of 1983, was
hailed as more "good news" by Secretary of Commerce
Malcolm Baldrige, while Secretary of the Treasury Donald
Regan termed it a sign that the upturn will be "solid and sus
tained."
Several private analysts, however, said that weak spots in
the economy were still retarding its advance and contended
that the strength of the snap-back from the recession that
started in mid-1981 cannot be gauged without more in
formation on whether consumer spending will start climbing
this spring.

In addition, a surge in the nation's money supply as
sociated with new forms of bank deposits apparently inflated
the index of leading indicators in both January and February.
Zambia president meets Reagan
Washington — One of Africa's senior leaders, President
Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, came away from two hours with
President Reagan yesterday saying the two men "share an
abhorrence of the apartheid system" of South Africa and
agree it should be ended quickly in the interest of peace, sta
bility and harmony in the region.
Kaunda, the first president of a "front-line state" near
South Africa to visit Washington in the Reagan adminis
tration, seemed happy about his meeting and luncheon at
the White House, praising the "warm hospitality" and saying
that a firm foundation had been laid for future relations.
Last October Kaunda said he had been shocked during a
1975 official visit when President Ford devoted only 45
minutes to discussions with him. On the other hand, Kaunda
praised President Carter for spending six hours with him dur
ing a 1978 visit.
Previously Kaunda had been critical both of Reagan and
his administration's policies, and openly indignant about re
ports that the administration considers South Africa to be a
friend.
Mideast bargaining hits impasse
Washington — Two weeks after Israeli Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's visit here raised hopes for early agreement
on withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon, the nego
tiations have become deadlocked again by what U.S. officials
say are unacceptable Israeli demands for security arrange
ments in southern Lebanon.
"We are one step away from being back to square one,"
one U.S. official, familiar with the negotiations, said yester
day in describing "a progressively negative" Israeli reaction
to the proposals for ensuring the security of Israel's northern
border made to Shamir by Secretary of State George Shultz.
Shamir, who conferred with Shultz for three days in mid-
March, returned home sounding optimistic about the
chances for a breakthrough. But, U.S. officials said yesterday,
in subsequent negotiations with President Reagan's special
Mideast envoy, Philip Habib, the Israelis have rejected the
idea that Lebanese forces can control terrorist activity in
southern Lebanon and have reiterated demands for arrange
ments unacceptable to Lebanese President Amin Gemayel.
Habib is expected to return here Thursday. He is coming
back partly for personal business, but the officials said he also
is expected to discuss with Reagan and Shultz possible new
U.S. steps for breaking the latest impasse.
Market bounces back after lull
New York — The stock market rebounded to near-record
highs yesterday with a rally spurred by signs of a continuing
economic recovery.
Energy and high-technology issues led the advance.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen
almost 15 points over the three previous sessions, climbed
12.10 to 1143.29. That left the average just short of the record
closing high of 1145.90 it reached last Thursday.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 75.80
million shares, against 65.30 million in the previous session.
