NATO lauds Reagan's proposal
Bonn, West Germany — The United States' West
European allies hailed President Reagan's proposal
yesterday for an interim agreement with the Soviet
Union on land-based middle-range nuclear missiles
and called upon the Soviet Union to respond favor
ably to the offer.
The agreement would "substantially reduce" the
number of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Eu
rope to an equal number on both sides.
Reagan, who had been under pressure from North
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to offer an alter
native to his "zero-option" proposal that the Soviets
had rejected, emphasized that his ultimate goal still is
total elimination of such weapons.
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that the

proposal "opens a wide range of possibilities" for
breaking the 16-month deadlock in U.S.-Soviet arms
talks in Geneva, Switzerland.
Kohl said in a statement that he was disappointed
that the Soviet Union has refused to agree to a total
ban on all middle-range weapons as initially pro
posed by the president, but said the interim offer call
ing for reduced deployment by both sides should be
welcomed as a move toward the goal of a total ban.
A statement from British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's office said that an interim agreement that
would reduce the warheads on such weapons would
contribute to East-West stability and security. The
statement pledged Britain's "wholehearted support"
for the proposal.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization head
quarters in Brussels, Belgium, said in a statement that

it was now up to the Soviet Union to take up the offer
"in an effort to reach a militarily significant, equitable
and verifiable agreement in Geneva at the earliest
possible date."
In Paris, the French External Relations Ministry de
clared that France could "only be pleased by all the
efforts undertaken towards a satisfactory conclusion
which conforms to the interests of Europe."
The president's offer was seen as meeting West Eu
ropean objections to the "zero option" and coun
tering the widespread belief that the Reagan adminis
tration was inflexible on the missiles issue.
The zero option, which has been repeatedly re
jected by Moscow, calls for the Soviet Union to scrap
all of its 600 land-based middle-range missiles aimed
against targets in Europe and Asia. In return, NATO
would abandon plans to begin deployment in De

cember of 572 Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in
Western Europe.
Under Reagan's proposal, even if the Soviets
agreed to reduce their missiles, the United States
would proceed with its plan to begin deploying cruise
and Pershing 2 missiles in five European countries in
December to counter the Soviet buildup of missiles
aimed at NATO countries.
