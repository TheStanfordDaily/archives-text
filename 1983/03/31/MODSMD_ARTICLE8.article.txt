## Nuclear arms control: how can technology help? U.S. to compromise 
### 
Compiled trom news report and wire
services
President Reagan is giving
Soviet negotiators a com
promise arms proposal to take
back to Moscow to break the
deadlock on limiting medium
range nuclear missiles in
Europe.
The new U.S. proposal was
laid on the table in Ceneva,
Switzerland, on Tuesday, the
last day of the talks before an
eight-week recess. Reagan is
offering the Kremlin an
"interim agreement" that falls
short of his "zero-zero" plan to
eliminate all medium-range
missiles.
The Soviets have steadfastly
rejected the zero-zero plan,
and Reagan has come under
increasing pressure from
European allies to offer an al
ternative. NATO defense
chiefs told Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger last week

that Reagan should come up
with an option to the zero-zero
formula.
As an alternative, Reagan will
suggest a mutual cutback in the
number of ground-based nu
clear missiles to break the
negotiating deadlock, accord
ing to the official.
"There may not be precise
numbers," Reagan said. He
"holds fast for the eventual
elimination" of the medium
range weapons, but is offering
this proposal to break the
negotiating deadlock, he said.
Depending on the Soviet's
response, the modified U.S.
proposal could result in the
dismantling of most of the
triple-headed Soviet SS-20 mis
siles now aimed at Western
Europe while only a fraction of
the 572 American Pershing II
and cruise missiles would be
deployed.
