# Belligerent words may signal a new Cold War

The bitter public exchanges recently between President Re
agan and Soviet leader Yuri Andropov appear to foreshadow a
new and more serious crisis in Soviet-American relations and
the possible advent of a second Cold War.
This is the view of Soviet and foreign political observers in
Moscow following President Reagan's March 8 attack on Mos
cow as an "evil empire" and his March 23 proposal to shift the
U.S. posture to base nuclear deterrence on a new anti-ballistic
system.
Observers say the harshness of Andropov's March 26 re
sponse to the president's speech is virtually without prece
dent since the days of the Cold War. While the Soviet media
has assailed U.S presidents in bitter and vitriolic terms, top
Soviet leaders have resorted extremely rarely to direct per
sonal attacks on American leaders.
As seen from Moscow, Reagan has escalated the already
thorny dispute about the scheduled deployment on new U.S.
medium-range missiles in Western Europe., The Russians
have clearly indicated that the deployment of 108 Pershing II
missiles in West Germany could lead to a crisis in relations that
would be similar to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. But at the
same time they let it be known that they could live with the
deployment of U.S. cruise missiles—which are much slower
than the Pershing and thus easier to defend against—and that
they are prepared to negotiate a deal allowing one but not the
other.
The Pershing II is said to be unacceptable to Soviet military
chiefs because they regard it as a first-strike weapon capable of
launching a surprise attack.
Reagan's new proposal to develop more sophisticated
anti-ballistic missile systems including those based in space
raised a qualitatively new issue. Andropov and other Soviet
officials have made it clear that they would match any new U.S.
weapons system.
Behind the current dispute is the essential fact that Moscow,
like Washington, regards nuclear weapons not only as poten
tial agents of catastrophic devastation but also as instruments
of power and influence in the world.
In the Soviet view, the Reagan administration is intent on
denying equal status of any kind to the Soviet Union by aban
doning the agreements reached at the 1972 Moscow summit
between then President Richard Nixon and general secretary
Leonid Brezhnev. At the time Nixon conceded equal status to
Moscow by formally acknowledging the existence of strategic
parity between the two superpowers.
