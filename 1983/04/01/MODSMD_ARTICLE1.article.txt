# Hargadon to leave Old Union for Harvard post
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
University President Donald Kennedy told the
Faculty Senate yesterday that Fred Hargadon will
leave Stanford next year to become dean of the
Harvard Admissions Office.
Hargadon said in a personal letter to Kennedy
that he was leaving for personal reasons. His let
ter ended characteristically with the word,
"cheers," Kennedy said.
Hargadon had been considering the move for
some time but wanted to keep his decision secret
until he had made all necessary arrangements,
Kennedy said.
The announcement, made just after Hargadon
put the stamp on the last acceptance letter, was
timed to give the University the maximum time
to find a replacement, Kennedy said. Hargadon is
approaching his 15th year here.
Harvard University President Derek Bok said,
"We feel honored that the dean of the Harvard
of the West's Admissions Office has foresaken
palms for ivy."
Shocked staff members were seen sobbing in
Old Union yesterday as they heard the news. "I
can't believe it, he was like a father to me," said
admissions officer Keith Light.

The Admissions Office declined to speculate
who would replace Hargadon.
Drum major Simon Streets said the Band will
hold a "Don't go, Fred" rally at noon today in the
Admissions Office lobby.
"It's not all right now," Streets said.
Kennedy agreed, saying that Stanford "just
won't be the same without Fred."
Hargadon, affectionately called "Dean Fred,"
has admitted literally thousands of high school
seniors since he came here from Swarthmore in
1969. He is credited with breaking the color bar
rier of Stanford's basically all-white student
body.
Students are already wondering whether
Gaieties will continue without a cameo ap
pearance by Hargadon. "We may try to get an
ASSU fee assessment to fly Fred back for next
year's Big Game festivities," said senior Megan
Chesnut.
Several Ram's Head members are considering
scrapping Gaieties altogether.
The colorful dean of admissions said he will
drive across country in his Mustang, which bears
the license plate message "ADMITS."
Several students were heard speculating

whether Hargadon s sons will transfer to the East
Coast as well.
Hargadon was unavailable for comment. Ad
missions secretary Bamah Vaughn said, "He's
been smoking his pipe and reading applications
24 hours a day to get those letters out next
week."
Hargadon is the former resident fellow of the
American Studies House. Graduate Mark Breier,
the resident assistant in the house two years ago,
said, "We all loved Fred and looked up to him .. .
literally."
The popular campus figure, who once called
himself the "dean of rejections," is also chairman
of the College Entrance Examinations Boards'
board of trustees. He has repeatedly defended
the College Boards as the most objective criteria
a university has in evaluating its undergraduate
applications because all applicants take the same
test. Standardized entrance examinations enable
students from poorer schools to compete with
those from the top schools by offering a standard
for comparison, according to Hargadon.
Hargadon was an undergraduate at Haverford
and a graduate student at Harvard and Cornell.
