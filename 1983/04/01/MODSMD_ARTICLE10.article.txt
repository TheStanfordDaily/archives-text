In response to pressure from the American
Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the
National Institute ot Health (NIH), Stanford Med
ical School has established a special committee
to evaluate allegations of research fraud.
Both the AAMC and the NIH recently called
upon mcdical schools nationwide to create such
committees in an effort to curb research fraud,
although the number of such incidents remains
"vanishingly small," according to Medical
School Dean Dominick Purpura.
In a March 4 letter to Med School faculty mem
bers, Purpura announced the formation of a
committee to "deal with allegations of academic
fraud swiftly, fairly and honorably." Purpura is
chairman of the new Committee on Ethical Scien
tific Performance and appointed its members.
While the number of incidents remains small,
Purpura said, "even a rare instance of scientific

fraud damages science as an intellectual enter
prise, violates expectations of fundamental trust
and diminishes all who take special pride in a
commitment to the pursuit of truth and excel
lence."
While a procedure for disciplining an errant
researcher has long been established here,
evaluating the legitimacy of allegations has been
"torturous" in the past, Purpura said. "We now
have a framework within which we can examine
and resolve allegations swiftly," he said.
According to Prof. David Korn, committee
member and chairman of the Med School's
Pathology Department, the ethics group has only
met once for an organizational meeting. Korn
described the committee as "a mechanism that
has been set up in case research fraud should
occur." He said, "We have yet to hear any allega
tions. I suppose those of us on the committee
would be happiest if it were never used."
Korn called the ethics committee "a very new

thing" at Stanford and other medical schools. In
the past institutions have been "very slow" in
handling allegations of research fraud.
"The important thing to remember is that the
number of these episodes (of fraud) is only a tiny
traction of total scientific research," Korn said.
He cited recent "widely publicized" incidents of
scientific fraud by researchers at Harvard, Yale
and Boston universities.
"The NIH and the AAMC have decided that
schools have a public responsibility to prevent
fraud," he said. "We're dealing with public
funds."
Prof. Stanley Falkow, committee member and
chairman of the Department of Medical Mic
robiology, also stressed the ethics group's role as
a standing committee, a precaution "should the
need arise." But he said, "I hope we never
have to meet."
