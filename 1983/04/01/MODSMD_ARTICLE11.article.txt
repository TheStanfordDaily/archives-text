# Survey shows print media remains students' first information source
## 
### RICK BOECK 
Two decades after media philosopher Marshall McLu
han passed the death sentence on the printed word,
Stanford students say the print media endure as their
most important source of news and information.
McLuhan told a Life magazine interviewer in 1966,
"Our new gang of kids raised on TV face the world in a
spirit antithetical to literacy. They bring to print all their
senses, only to find that print rejects them. Print asks for
the isolated and stripped down visual faculty, not for
unified sensorium."
But now that the results are in on a survey of 529
students conducted last quarter by a graduate class in
precision journalism, it seems that the generation to
which McLuhan was referring has, in fact, not forsaken
print for the electronic media.
Newspapers are reported as students' most important
source of news, while books are their most important
information source. In terms of entertainment, televi
sion ranks fourth below movies, radio and books.
One student's comments reflect television's poor rat
ing in relation to print in all three areas: "I hate TV. I find
its presentation ugly and distracting. I haven't watched it
since I was 13. Most programs are unintelligent, news is
chatty and sensational and the commercials . . . well."
Obviously these findings run sharply counter to
McLuhan's 1964 predictions that young people would
find the print media unrewarding after what he called
the "total involvement" of television.
Kurt Wollenhaupt, a senior in economics, puts it this
way. "I don't really feel there is a replacement for either
a book in the hand or a newspaper in the hand and the
actual feel of the news."
Seventy percent of Stanford's undergraduate and
graduate students regularly read daily newspapers other
than the Stanford Daily and 50 percent read news maga
zines, as compared with 46 percent who said they listen

to radio news and the 28 percent who watch television
news. Of the students surveyed, 46 percent consider
newspapers their single most important source of na
tional news.
The most popular source of news on campus is the
Stanford Daily, which is delivered free and read by 79
percent of the students, followed by the San Francisco
Chronicle, which is read by 49 percent of the student
body.
On the average, students say tney spend nearly 20
hours a week reading from a variety of sources. While
many classes require extensive reading, most students
spend at least some leisure time with newspapers, mag
azines, books and even academic periodicals.
Writing in Understanding Media in 1964, McLuhan
envisioned a very different set of media habits for to
day's students. McLuhan, a University of Toronto En
glish professor, is best known for the statement "The
medium is the message," in which he suggested that the
method of communication may be more important than
the information communicated.
He argued, for example, that the print media had
imposed a regime of linear thinking on man, but that the
electronic media, particularly TV, can restore the com
plexity of face-to-face communication and even estab
lish a global village. Television's capacity to involve the
senses and demand involvement, McLuhan added, ex
plained the popularity of the medium that would even
tually render reading and even step-by-step classroom
teaching a bore.
Nearly all students said they had read a newspaper
during the survey week and they overwhelmingly rated
newspapers as their most important source of news.
"Well I rely on them pretty heavily," graduate student
John Leach said. "I read two newspapers. Being British, I
find that the New York Times doesn't give me enough

LEISURE READING: Sophomore Kourosh Gharachorloo browses through a magazine rack at the Store. A
recent survey has revealed that print media remains students' top information source compared to radio or
television. More than 70 percent of students here regularly read newspapers, while 50 percent read news
magazines, the survey said.
European information, so I
spend time reading the Euro
pean press tor that. I spend a
lot of time reading them. They
seem to supply me with a lot of
news."
Computer science graduate
student Stephen Bell spends
about four hours a week — a
figure slightly above the 3.4
hours Stanford students spend
on average — reading newspa
pers. In addition to the San
Francisco Chronicle, Bell regu
larly reads the Christian Sci
ence Monitor and the Wall
Street lournal.
"The Wall Street lournal is
sometimes a little too business
oriented," Bell said. "But their
columns are good. The Chris
tian Science Monitor is good
for world news; they mix
commentary with the news. In
a lot of ways, they're probably
the best international newspa
per."
The Stanford Daily is the stu
dents' single most important
source of information about
Stanford, a community of

about 13,000 students and
more than 10,000 employees.
"It's about my only source,"
said one student, while
another said, "It's as good as
anything else."
"The Stanford Daily tells you
what's going on around cam
pus," sophomore Todd Hol
zhauser said. "It's something
to read if the class you're in
isn't too exciting."
"I tend to flip through it
every day to see what's excit
ing," David Hoffer, another
sophomore, said. "I tend to
read the opinion section more
than anything else. I do look at
the headlines and that's prob
ably the best news about Stan
ford."
"As the Daily goes — which
is the paper I read most, prob
ably since I pick it up every day
— it's a pretty good newspa
per. It doesn't do a pheno
menal coverage but it is
adequate," another student
said.
But at least one student felt
no need for any information
about Stanford. "I really make
no attempt to find out what's
going on at Stanford," said
John Abelson, a doctoral stu

dent in materials science en
gineering. "You know, I as
sume if the sky is falling (my
wife) will tell me, having read it
in the Daily."
"I read the Chronicle for
more world news, and it does a
tolerable job and satisfies most
of my interests," sophomore
Greg Mullins said.
"The San Francisco Chroni
cle is kind of like a French
pastry," Bell said. "It's nice to
breeze through but there's not
much substance."
1 he Peninsula Times Tribune
attracts 14 percent of the stu
dent body. Another 12 percent
read the Wall Street Journal, 7
percent the San lose Mercury
and 3 percent the New York
Times.
The San Francisco Examiner,
the Los Angeles Times and the
Christian Science Monitor each
reach 2 percent of the popula
tion. The new national news
paper, USA Today, is only read
by 1 percent.
"I'd have to say I'm happy
with them," Leach said. "It is
mainly up to me to work out
what I want from the media, so
it's more a question of how I
read and I read them fairly

thoroughly."
But Bell complained, "I don't
think there's any newspaper in
the United States that does re
<illy good world news. I think
the level of world news is dis
gusting. There's no other word
for it."
I he 30 percent of the sample
that reported not reading a
newspaper other than the
Stanford Daily, gave a variety of
reasons for this. Students most
frequently indicated lack of
time (49 percent) or the un
availability of newspapers (21
percent). Others said they pre
fer news magazines (5 per
cent), radio news (3 percent)
and television news (2 per
cent).
Still, 81 percent of the sam
ple said they had read newspa
pers regularly before attending
college, and 94 percent intend
to read newspapers regularly
after college, although one re-
scribbled on the
(■uestionnaire, "No, I'll still be
too lazy."
Students often use the
>ource of news that is most
r onvenient to them. "I really
don't read that many publica
tions," said one under

graduate, "and usually only
those that are very convenient
for me."
Next to the Stanford Daily,
the most convenient source of
news is radio.
"I can listen to it while I'm
getting ready to go to school in
the morning and do things that
don't require too much con
centration," a graduate stu
dent said. "I listen to radio in
the interest of time, but I don't
think of it as very good news."
News magazines were rated
as the second most important
source of news after newspa
pers. Half of Stanford's stu
dents regularly read news
magazines. Of these, 39 per
cent prefer Time and 29 prefer
Newsweek. U.S. News and
World Report is read by 5 per
cent.
"I think the newspapers do a
good job with day-to-day
stories, with things you need to
know, such as the (recent)
storm," Mullins said. "But for
things like political coverage I
much prefer the news maga
zines because they have the
ability for a good deal more
depth and continuity that you
don't get on a daily basis."
Mullins also registered some dis
satisfaction with television news.
"Television news does an inde
quate job and I think half of it is just
the amount of time they spend on it
and half of it is that they just don't
take it seriously."
Only 28 percent of the sample said
they regularly watch television news,
and only 14 percent chose it as their
most important source of news
about national politics.
Television also scored below
books, newspapers and magazines

as a source of information and
knowledge. Stanford students spend
an average of 12.2 hours each week
hitting the books, which includes
textbooks and pleasure reading.
Compared to the national televi
sion viewing average of seven hours
a day, Stanford students watch little
TV. On the average, they watch 3.7
hours per week, and even students
who use the medium regularly say
they have little respect for it.
"As a primary source of enteratin
ment in terms of hours, I suppose it
would be TV," said one student. "It's
more or less innocuous and when
one starts to watch it the hours fly
by."

Abelson said of his disinterest in
television: "Television . . . well, we
have this paper drawing of a televi
sion here on the wall. The 'Fosdick
Hour,' that's the extent of my televi
sion watching. I have probably aver
aged no more than an hour a month
for the past 12 years. I just don't find
many programs of interest."
Although Marshall McLuhan mis
judged the impact of television on
today's college students, he cor
rectly understood the importance of
the media in daily and weekly
routine. From books to movies, Stan
ford students spend 33.5 hours a
week involved with some form of
media. And 42 percent said they use
media to keep from being lonely.
