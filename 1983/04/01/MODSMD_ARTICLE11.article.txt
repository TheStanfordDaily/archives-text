# Survey shows print media remains students' first information source
## 
### RICK BOECK 
Two decades after media philosopher Marshall McLu
han passed the death sentence on the printed word,
Stanford students say the print media endure as their
most important source of news and information.
McLuhan told a Life magazine interviewer in 1966,
"Our new gang of kids raised on TV face the world in a
spirit antithetical to literacy. They bring to print all their
senses, only to find that print rejects them. Print asks for
the isolated and stripped down visual faculty, not for
unified sensorium."
But now that the results are in on a survey of 529
students conducted last quarter by a graduate class in
precision journalism, it seems that the generation to
which McLuhan was referring has, in fact, not forsaken
print for the electronic media.
Newspapers are reported as students' most important
source of news, while books are their most important
information source. In terms of entertainment, televi
sion ranks fourth below movies, radio and books.
One student's comments reflect television's poor rat
ing in relation to print in all three areas: "I hate TV. I find
its presentation ugly and distracting. I haven't watched it
since I was 13. Most programs are unintelligent, news is
chatty and sensational and the commercials . . . well."
Obviously these findings run sharply counter to
McLuhan's 1964 predictions that young people would
find the print media unrewarding after what he called
the "total involvement" of television.
Kurt Wollenhaupt, a senior in economics, puts it this
way. "I don't really feel there is a replacement for either
a book in the hand or a newspaper in the hand and the
actual feel of the news."
Seventy percent of Stanford's undergraduate and
graduate students regularly read daily newspapers other
than the Stanford Daily and 50 percent read news maga
zines, as compared with 46 percent who said they listen

to radio news and the 28 percent who watch television
news. Of the students surveyed, 46 percent consider
newspapers their single most important source of na
tional news.
The most popular source of news on campus is the
Stanford Daily, which is delivered free and read by 79
percent of the students, followed by the San Francisco
Chronicle, which is read by 49 percent of the student
body.
On the average, students say tney spend nearly 20
hours a week reading from a variety of sources. While
many classes require extensive reading, most students
spend at least some leisure time with newspapers, mag
azines, books and even academic periodicals.
Writing in Understanding Media in 1964, McLuhan
envisioned a very different set of media habits for to
day's students. McLuhan, a University of Toronto En
glish professor, is best known for the statement "The
medium is the message," in which he suggested that the
method of communication may be more important than
the information communicated.
He argued, for example, that the print media had
imposed a regime of linear thinking on man, but that the
electronic media, particularly TV, can restore the com
plexity of face-to-face communication and even estab
lish a global village. Television's capacity to involve the
senses and demand involvement, McLuhan added, ex
plained the popularity of the medium that would even
tually render reading and even step-by-step classroom
teaching a bore.
Nearly all students said they had read a newspaper
during the survey week and they overwhelmingly rated
newspapers as their most important source of news.
"Well I rely on them pretty heavily," graduate student
John Leach said. "I read two newspapers. Being British, I
find that the New York Times doesn't give me enough

LEISURE READING: Sophomore Kourosh Gharachorloo browses through a magazine rack at the Store. A
recent survey has revealed that print media remains students' top information source compared to radio or
television. More than 70 percent of students here regularly read newspapers, while 50 percent read news
magazines, the survey said.
