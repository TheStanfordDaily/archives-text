Reagan urges freeze rejection
Los Angeles — President Reagan yesterday urged
rejection of a nuclear freeze and pushed for accep
tance of his arms control initiatives, saying the Soviets
would agree to them only if the United States and its
allies maintain a united commitment to military
strength.
In a speech that appeared to be directed as much at
his domestic political critics as at the Soviets, the pres
ident claimed that he had "launched the most com
prehensive program of arms control initiatives ever
undertaken" and hinted at new proposals to come.
Reagan also suggested that proponentsof a nuclear
freeze will bear a heavy responsibility if the super
powers fail to achieve a strategic nuclear arms pact.
"It is vital that we show patience, determination

and, above all, national unity," Reagan told an au
dience of 1300 persons who listened attentively and
applauded the president strongly at the conclusion of
his speech.
"If we appear to be divided — if the Soviets suspect
that domestic political pressure will undercut our
position — they will dig in their heels. And that can
only delay an agreement, and may destroy all hope
for an agreement," the president said.
Administration officials said Reagan would soon
embrace a proposal by Sens. Henry Jackson (D-
Wash.) and Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) that would establish a
U.S.-Soviet crisis center intended to reduce the risk of
accidental nuclear war.
