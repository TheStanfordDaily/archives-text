Reagan urges freeze rejection
Los Angeles — President Reagan yesterday urged
rejection of a nuclear freeze and pushed for accep
tance of his arms control initiatives, saying the Soviets
would agree to them only if the United States and its
allies maintain a united commitment to military
strength.
In a speech that appeared to be directed as much at
his domestic political critics as at the Soviets, the pres
ident claimed that he had "launched the most com
prehensive program of arms control initiatives ever
undertaken" and hinted at new proposals to come.
Reagan also suggested that proponentsof a nuclear
freeze will bear a heavy responsibility if the super
powers fail to achieve a strategic nuclear arms pact.
"It is vital that we show patience, determination

and, above all, national unity," Reagan told an au
dience of 1300 persons who listened attentively and
applauded the president strongly at the conclusion of
his speech.
"If we appear to be divided — if the Soviets suspect
that domestic political pressure will undercut our
position — they will dig in their heels. And that can
only delay an agreement, and may destroy all hope
for an agreement," the president said.
Administration officials said Reagan would soon
embrace a proposal by Sens. Henry Jackson (D-
Wash.) and Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) that would establish a
U.S.-Soviet crisis center intended to reduce the risk of
accidental nuclear war.
The principal theme of Reagan's expository speech
on arms control to the Los An? World Affairs
Council was that he is a peacemaker whose efforts are
made more difficult by well-meaning critics who give
the Soviets hope that they can achieve their goals
without negotiation.
Democrats praised the president for his efforts to
reduce the number of nuclear missiles in Europe, but
warned him against attacking proponents of the nu
clear freeze.
Soviets rebuff Reagan proposal
Moscow — State-controlled Soviet media yester
day criticized President Reagan's interim proposal for
limiting medium-range missiles in Europe, but the
Kremlin continued to withhold formal comment.
The official response is expected to be delivered
Saturday by Foreign Minister Andrei Cromyko. The
Soviet Foreign Ministry announced that he would
hold a press conference then, his first in six years.
The official press agency Tass, in its first report of
the president's initiative, said Reagan's proposal for a
"so-called interim agreement" had been accom
panied by "noisy publicity on the part of Washington
officials."
Radio Moscow dismissed the offer as a warmed
over version of the American "zero option" plan that
the Soviet leadership has already rejected in talks on
limiting European nuclear misiles in Geneva, Switzer
land.
In the most detailed Soviet commentary thus far,
the Novosti Press Agency attacked the president's of
fer as a negotiating ploy designed to pacify public op
position to U.S. missiles in Europe and one that could
not play a "constructive role" in the Geneva talks.
The commentary, one of two that Novosti
circulated fo foreign reporters yesterday, said it ap
peared that the interim offer was meant to "prevent a
new upsurge of protest" while allowing the United
States to deploy its 572 Persing 2 and cruise missiles in
Europe in stages.
Reagan withholds F-16s
Los Angeles — President Reagan, seeking to spur
movement in the deadlocked talks on troop with
drawals from Lebanon, said yesterday he will not ap
prove delivery of advanced F-16 jet fighter-bombers
to Israel while Israeli forces continue to occupy Leba
non.
Reagan had refused for months to say what action
he intended to take about the F-16 deliveries, and the
administration had turned aside all questions about
the situation by saying the president had it under con
sideration.
Yesterday, answering questions after a speech here,
Reagan was asked why the United States had not sent
the planes to Israel to counter the Soviet Union's de
livery of SAM-5 surface-to-air missiles to Syria, which
has an estimated 35,000 troops in northern and
eastern Lebanon. He answered:
"You must realize that under the law — the law ex

ists now — those weapons must be for defensive
purposes. 'Knd this is again one of the obstacles pre
sented by the stalemate in Lebanon. While those (Is
raeli) forces are in the position of occupying another
country ... we are forbidden by law to release those
planes .. . and it's as simple asthe other forces return
ing to their own countries and letting Lebanon be
Lebanon."
His response left some confusion about why he was
stating a policy about the F-16s at this time. Despite
Reagan's contention that the law bars him from send
ing weapons to Israel while its forces are in Lebanon,
the Pentagon last week notified Congress of its inten
tion to sell 200 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles worth
about $16 million tothe Jewish state.
'Supercomputer' supported
Washington — The Defense Department is plan
ning a major research project to create a new gener
ation of "supercomputers," hoping toovertake Japan
in a race to establish supremacy in computer technol
ogy in the 19905, officials said yesterday.
The project, called "Strategic Computing and Sur
vivability," but nicknamed the "Supercomputer" by
Defense Department officials, is designed to compete
with Japanese government and industry efforts to
create a so-called "Fifth Generation" computer. Oth
er department officials say the underlying purpose is
to assure U S. dominance over the Soviet Union in de
fense technology.
The new supercomputers would process informa
tion at rates thousands of times faster than existing
machines and would be imbued with "artificial in
telligence" software that would give them problem
solving capabilities far beyond today's computer sys
tems.
"This is in response to the Japanese," said a high
ranking official of the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, which will administer the project.
DARPA is tentatively seeking $50 million for fiscal
1984 and congressional hearings on the proposal are
scheduled for laterthis month.
