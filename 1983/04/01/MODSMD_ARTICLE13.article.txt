# Campus weathers costly rain season

### JERRY BALL 
The winter storms that whipped
the Bay Area in the last few months
did $115,000 worth of damage here,
according to |im Horgan, director of
operations and maintenance.
Storms this year have been unusu
ally severe, dumping more than 30
inches of rain on Palo Altoâ€”nearly
double the average for this time of
year.
But sun gods and goddesses and
frisbee-flingers take heart: the cen

ter ot the storm system "is st<Hting to
shift to the North," and April may be
even drier than usual," said Robert
Brown of the National Weather Ser
vice.
At any rate, he said, it is unlikely
that there will be any more storms
this year as destructive as the ones
that hit in February and March.
According to Horgan, the $115,000
came out of a "storm emergencies"
fund which is separate from the regu
lar maintenance budget. Since the
account contained $350,000 before

the storm hit, the University will not
need to take money from any other
budget in order to pay for the unex
pected damages, he said.
Horgan estimates "SO to6o percent
of the maintenance expense was
tree-work; about 100 trees blew
down." Horgan's crews have been
working around the clock. With the
exception of a few blank spaces
where trees used to be, Horgan said,
"there is nothing out there that is not
like it was" before the storms.
