## The
						Stanford Daily Reagan's plan: lost in space 
### 
President Reagan has called upon the scien
tific community to develop a system of anti
ballistic weapons, including space-based killer
satellites, which provide an impenetrable shield
against Soviet missile attacks. The plan, he
claims, "could free the world from the threat of
nuclear war." While Reagan's heart may be in
the right place, his "vision for the future" could
lead to a further escalation jn the arms race.
The issue hits especially close to home be
cause scientists here are being asked to join in
the national effort. Officials at the Stanford Syn
chotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), which has
previously shunned weapons-related research,
are now considering a research proposal which
would aid in the development of nuclear
weapons pumped x-ray lasers, one type of
space-based anti-ballistic weapon. Observers
say pressure is strong for SSRL, which depends
on federal funding for its research, to join in the
president's call to arms.
Reagan's vision raises false hopes of a
"solution" to an issue which requires a heavy
dose of critical analysis. Many physicists and
arms control strategists, here and across the
nation, have called the plan unfeasible and de
stabilizing.
First, the technology does not even exist yet,
unless the president knows something he is not
telling us, and the system could probably never
be developed to a 100 percent effectiveness
level. |112 either side thought that 1 percent of
missiles launched in an attack might possibly
penetrate the defense system, each side would
be encouraged to build up its offensive
weapons to unprecedented levels in order to
ensure that it could return a first-strike attack.
As Jerome Weisner, former president of M.I.T.
and adviser to presidents, explained, "It's wish
ful thinking to believe that they would provide
impenetrable defenses. There are 10,000 or
more nuclear weapons on each side. A defense
system that would knock out 90 or 95 percent
would be a miracleâ€”and the remaining five or
10 percent would be enough to totally destroy
civilization." The space-based system could not

defend against terrain-hugging cruise missiles
or low-flying bombers. Nor could they could
prevent a Soviet nuclear attack on Europe with
weapons transported on the ground.
Both nations could develop weapons to de
stroy the other's defense systems. Nobel
laureate and co-inventor of the laser, Arthur
Schawlow, explained that "a laser battle station
out in space would be a sitting duck. If the
enemy wanted to launch missiles at us, the first
thing they would do would be to destroy the
opponent's laser stations in space."
Reagan's "vision" would only escalate the
arms race, moving it out into space and eventu
ally leading to pre-emptive warfare in space to
destroy the defensive station platforms.
Here at Stanford, SSRL should not accept the
proposal to do research on these laser systems
for two reasons. By taking part in the research
SSRL would not only be taking part in Reagan's
folly, but would also be renegging on a com
mitment not to do weapons-related research at
SLAC or SSRL, a commitment which has helped
attract top physicists from all around the world.
Staff members at SLAC have continued to voice
their objections to the proposal even though
SLAC's director, Wolfgang Panofsky, has said
SLAC will "cooperate fully" with the project if it
is accepted. A project of this scope requires a
dedicated staff. Acceptance of the proposal will
certainly change the atmosphere of research at
SLAC and SSRL, creating difficult choices for
staff members committed to only doing non
weapons-related research.
In a broader sense, Reagan's speech repre
sents a dangerous shift in American deterrence
strategy which has for four decades succeeded
in preventing nuclear war. The argument for
anti-ballistic missiles was rejected more than 10
years ago, based on the notion that if either side
believed the other might soon be able to defend
against a first-strike attack, a quick pre-emptive
attack might appear more attractive. The best
method of preventing nuclear war isto continue
arms control negotiations, relying on deter
rence to keep the peace, without pursuing the
chimera of a perfect defense.
