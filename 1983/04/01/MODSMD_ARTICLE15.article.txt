## â€˜Fake' professor fools Stanford 
### 
Stanford Law Prof. Heinrich Sun
burger was in police custody today
when it was revealed that he had
been leading an amazing multiple
life holding full-time positions at at
least five western schools. A police
spokesperson said that the distin
guished bearded figure had been
found at Colorado State where he
was working as director of intercol
legiate rodeo under the name Dr.
Luke Buckskin. At the University of
San Francisco, he taught Theory of
Cay Lifestyles as Professor Gaylord
Dickie Quicheman. At Fresno State,
he was head of the French Depart
ment specializing in 19th century lit
erature and using the alias Hortense
Fifi Lablanche. Meanwhile, at UC-

Davis, he was a familiar figure in
Asian Studies where he passed as
Toshiro Yamamoto. Police have now
moved their inquiries to Hawaii.
At Stanford, Sunburger (a.k.a.
Buckskin-Quicheman-Lablanche-
Yamamoto) teaches courses in
forensic dentistry, water and gas law,
and Roman criminal procedure. FHe
has been with the faculty for eight
years. Law students today expressed
shock at the arrest. "We never sus
pected that he knew nothing about
his subjects," one said. "You see, he
always used the Socratic method so
it's impossible to tell. We should
have guessed that he wasn't a real
lawyer though he kept talking about
the values of truth, honesty and jus

tice."
Law Prof. Mandy Feegouger told
reporters that Sunburger (a.k.a.
etc.,) was very popular with faculty
since he was never seen. When
asked to comment on his estimated
total salary of $200,000, Feegouger
said, "I suppose he could always
supplement it with outside work."
The dean of the Law School
doubted whether Sunburger could
be dismissed from Stanford. "We'll
probably have to give him tenure on
the basis of distinguished commu
nity service and active outside con
sulting."
The investigation continues.
