## Stanford should reinstate ROTC 
### 
In the article "Draft protests com
pared" (Daily, March 4), Political Sci
ence Prof. Hugh Marshall is quoted
giving this assessment of the
Vietnam-era protests at Stanford: "I
think that getting rid of ROTC . . .
was an accomplishment." Such
commentary reveals a narrow
mindedness one would hope Stan
ford professors transcend.
The implication is that Marshall
found the ROTC program offensive
to his notions of intellectual purity
and integrity. But such highbrow
nose-wrinkling serve neither the
students, nor the university, nor the
nation very well.
The nature and substance of the
ROTC program boils down to this ex
change: students receive schol
arships which enable them to obtain
an advanced education, and our
armed forces receive the services of
men and women who have had four
years of exposure to the spectrum of
ideas and personalities one encoun
ters at college. It is uncertain as to
which side of the equation Marshall
takes umbrage: that students are fi
nancially assisted or that the military
is manned by better educated per
sons.
Assuming that Marshall entertains
a certain egalitarian ethic, he must
support the ridding of ROTC pro
grams at all colleges and universities,
not just Stanford. The effect of this
logical extension of his views would
be to create an unbridged gap be
tween those with liberal arts school
ing and those running-our nation's
military apparatus. Given the indis
pensable need for a defense estab
lishment, it only makes sense to try
to cultivate leadership which is not
only capable in strictly military mat
ters, but also thoughtful and well
read.
An ROTC program at Stanford
would not abridge the academic
freedom of the faculty, nor would it
translate info students goose
stepping in White Plaza.

It's time for Stanford to cure itself
of the Vietnam syndrome and
reinstate ROTC on campus.

I am writing this letter in response
to a recent policy statement made by
the Menlo Park City Council con
cerning the proposed development
of "Stanford West."
Currently, bicycling between my
home in Menlo Park and the Stanford
campus can be extremely hazardous,
primarily because of the Willow
Road/Pasteur Drive intersection near
the bike bridge across from San
Francisquito Creek. This is so be
cause there is no way of navigating
this stretch of Willow Road without
either crossing without a light or
traveling on the bike path on the
wrong side of the road (despite the
existence of a crosswalk).
Upon hearing about proposed de
velopments in the area, especially
that of making Willow Road a
through road to El Camino Real, I
assumed that any responsible local
government would have to take
steps to safeguard the lives of its citi
zens in their daily activities, by, in
this case, at least upgrading the cros
sing at the Willow/Pasteur intersec
tion and allowing for two-way bicycle
traffic on the "north" side of Willow
Road.
Hence, I hope you can understand
my surprise at reading in the above
policy statements that developers
are to "design bike paths in Stanford
West so that they will not attract in
creased bike traffic from the project
to Menlo Park.
This is outrageous and I should
hope that no one who long held this
view would be allowed to remain in a
position of responsibility. I should
expect that some thought will be
given to including provisions for safe

bicycling in this area long before any
proposed development is com
menced.

As members of the graduate com
munity, we applaud the University's
decision to include funds for a spe
cial increase in the graduate fellow
ship stipend in the 1983-84 operating
budget.
This is the third annual installment
of such increases, which were de
signed to bring the fellowship
stipend — which is the smallest
stipend received by Stanford
supported Ph.D. students, and
whose recipients are concentrated in
the humanities departments — up to
a target level of 70 percent of a mini
mal budget for living expenses.
While there will continue to be
disagreements about the adequacy
of the financial support provided to
Stanford graduate students, we rec
ognize that the University's decision
to follow through on its original in
tention of providing this third incre
ment was by no means trivial or au
tomatic, coming as it did at a time of
severe pressure on the University
budget.
We are confident that this effort to
increase the financial support for
graduate education represents a
solid long-run investment in the con
tinued excellence of Stanford Uni
versity.

assumed that any responsible local
government would have to take
steps to safeguard the lives of its citi
zens in their daily activities, by, in
this case, at least upgrading the cros
sing at the Willow/Pasteur intersec
tion and allowing for two-way bicycle
traffic on the "north" side of Willow
Road.
Hence, I hope you can understand
my surprise at reading in the above
policy statements that developers
are to "design bike paths in Stanford
West so that they will not attract in
creased bike traffic from the project
to Menlo Park.
This is outrageous and I should
hope that no one who long held this
view would be allowed to remain in a
position of responsibility. I should
expect that some thought will be
given to including provisions for safe

bicycling in this area long before any
proposed development is com
menced.

As members of the graduate com
munity, we applaud the University's
decision to include funds for a spe
cial increase in the graduate fellow
ship stipend in the 1983-84 operating
budget.
This is the third annual installment
of such increases, which were de
signed to bring the fellowship
stipend — which is the smallest
stipend received by Stanford
supported Ph.D. students, and
whose recipients are concentrated in
the humanities departments — up to
a target level of 70 percent of a mini
mal budget for living expenses.
While there will continue to be
disagreements about the adequacy
of the financial support provided to
Stanford graduate students, we rec
ognize that the University's decision
to follow through on its original in
tention of providing this third incre
ment was by no means trivial or au
tomatic, coming as it did at a time of
severe pressure on the University
budget.
We are confident that this effort to
increase the financial support for
graduate education represents a
solid long-run investment in the con
tinued excellence of Stanford Uni
versity.

In the article "Draft protests com
pared" (Daily, March 4), Political Sci
ence Prof. Hugh Marshall is quoted
giving this assessment of the
Vietnam-era protests at Stanford: "I
think that getting rid of ROTC . . .
was an accomplishment." Such
commentary reveals a narrow
mindedness one would hope Stan
ford professors transcend.
The implication is that Marshall
found the ROTC program offensive
to his notions of intellectual purity
and integrity. But such highbrow
nose-wrinkling serve neither the
students, nor the university, nor the
nation very well.
The nature and substance of the
ROTC program boils down to this ex
change: students receive schol
arships which enable them to obtain
an advanced education, and our
armed forces receive the services of
men and women who have had four
years of exposure to the spectrum of
ideas and personalities one encoun
ters at college. It is uncertain as to
which side of the equation Marshall
takes umbrage: that students are fi
nancially assisted or that the military
is manned by better educated per
sons.
Assuming that Marshall entertains
a certain egalitarian ethic, he must
support the ridding of ROTC pro
grams at all colleges and universities,
not just Stanford. The effect of this
logical extension of his views would
be to create an unbridged gap be
tween those with liberal arts school
ing and those running-our nation's
military apparatus. Given the indis
pensable need for a defense estab
lishment, it only makes sense to try
to cultivate leadership which is not
only capable in strictly military mat
ters, but also thoughtful and well
read.
An ROTC program at Stanford
would not abridge the academic
freedom of the faculty, nor would it
translate info students goose
stepping in White Plaza.

It's time for Stanford to cure itself
of the Vietnam syndrome and
reinstate ROTC on campus.

Bicycle routes
I am writing this letter in response
to a recent policy statement made by
the Menlo Park City Council con
cerning the proposed development
of "Stanford West."
Currently, bicycling between my
home in Menlo Park and the Stanford
campus can be extremely hazardous,
primarily because of the Willow
Road/Pasteur Drive intersection near
the bike bridge across from San
Francisquito Creek. This is so be
cause there is no way of navigating
this stretch of Willow Road without
either crossing without a light or
traveling on the bike path on the
wrong side of the road (despite the
existence of a crosswalk).
Upon hearing about proposed de
velopments in the area, especially
that of making Willow Road a
through road to El Camino Real, I
assumed that any responsible local
government would have to take
steps to safeguard the lives of its citi
zens in their daily activities, by, in
this case, at least upgrading the cros
sing at the Willow/Pasteur intersec
tion and allowing for two-way bicycle
traffic on the "north" side of Willow
Road.
Hence, I hope you can understand
my surprise at reading in the above
policy statements that developers
are to "design bike paths in Stanford
West so that they will not attract in
creased bike traffic from the project

hope that no one who long held this
