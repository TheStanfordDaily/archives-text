# Vacation daydreams turn sour
## 
### 
Spring vacation. Through talking
to people around campus, I have
found that there are two ways to use
this vacation week.
The first way involves going home
to visit parents and old friends.The
time that you spend with your par
ents, though, usually turns into dis
cussions in which your parents tell
you to get a good summer job, and
you tell them about the intrinsic be
nefits of working at the beach.
Nights with friends usually turn
into arguments about whose school
is best. One member of the group
will tell everyone else that they're
just jealous because they didn't get
into Harvard, another will say that
everyone is mad because their
schools didn't get into college bowl
games and another will say everyone
is jealous because their schools are
relatively asexual. Being from Stan
ford you're left to say something
dumb like, "Guess where the first
U.S. female astronaut went to col
lege?" or "Maybe we didn't get into a
bowl game but the trombone play
with Cal got more television cover
age than anything." These conversa
tions are ridiculous. You have them,
though, and you finish the evening
wondering howyou could have been
friends with such jerks in high
school.
In general, the best aspect of the
first type of vacation is that it leaves
much time to daydream about the
second type. This second type in
volves you and some friends going to
Hawaii, or it could mean your group
throwing some bathing suits into
your car and driving to Laguna Beach
or else maybe going backpacking up
in Yosemite.
It sounds "ideal." In speaking to
friends who have taken this "ideal"
vacation, however, I have learned
that some unexpected conflicts can
arise.
If you're in a hot-weather resort,
for example, there will invariably be
one member of your group who does
not tan well. You and the others will
be losing your Green Library pallor

gracefully, but your buddy will be up
in the room moaning over his pink
skin. You can help him or her forget
the pain by sending up a constant
flow of liquor. Being in such pain,
though, he would probably drink too
much. Then your room would not
only smell like sunburn soothing lo
tion, but it would also smell
like. . .well, you know what happens
when someone drinks too much. Ba
sically, you just have to tell your
friend to bear the pain.
Another problem can be food. Pic
ture this: it's 5:00 and you and your
friends are discussing what to do for
dinner. One person who claims to be
a chef says, "I'll make a pizza!" The
responses will run from "Studly
idea" to "Let's do it" to "How much
will it cost?"
An hour later, you're looking at a
homemade, seemingly delicious
pizza. You take a bite and. . .Wow!
Suddenly there's something in your
mouth that tastes like a mixture of
burning sulphur and rotten squash.
Soon your stomach is experiencing
eruptions on a par with those of
Mount Saint Helens. So much for
your friend the chef.
That leads to another problem.
What if there is only one bathroom?
Even worse, what if it is just one
small bathroom and it contains one
shower? If you're with four or five
others, and you're the last to use the
shower, then by the time you get it
the room will have turned into a
pseudo-swamp, complete with
luke-warm water on floor, hair in the
toothbrushes, and soap so slippery
you can't hold onto it.
Finally, what if there is just one
towel? Even more disastrous, what if
there is just one towel and your sun
burnt friend used it to clean up the
result of his excessive drinking? It
can become a brutal situation.
Cars can also be a problem on a
trip. Not the car itself, but rather the
people in it. First there is the driver.
Remember that the most mild
mannered individual can turn into a
mean, ferocious man-beast behind

the wheel. To him, every passing
lane is an excuse to step on the gas
pedal, and every yellow light is an
excuse to race the color change.
Even worse than bad drivers,
though, are the bad back-seat driv
ers. These are the ones who start to
whine if you drive over 50 mph, and
who insist on telling you to make a
turn at the next corner even though
they can see that your turn signal is
blinking."Screamers" are also a pain
in the neck. They scream if they see
an unusual car, or a cow on the side
of the road, or a McDonald's coming
up. Their enthusiasm is great, but
when they yell "LOOK!" it's often
tempting to slam on the emergency
brakes.
Night time activities can also cause
conflict. There are those who like to
party wildly, and there are those who
like to sit in front of the fireplace and
have deep discussion. You want to
keep your whole group together.
A philosopher-type out on the
town, however, will dampen
everyone's spirits by talking about
the religious implications of asking
somebody to dance. On the other
hand, a partier sitting around the
fireplace will start to fidget, and be
come agitated, and will probably
want to tell ghost stories. He will un
doubtedly hurt a conversation about
things like relationships, religion and
life. Thus this is also a potential prob
lem.
And so one must ask oneself,"ls it
better to lie on the couch in the den
and daydream about the ideal vaca
tion, or is it better to take the ideal
vacation, but find out this it isn't as
ideal as you had imagined?" I don't
know. I do know this, however. I re
cently took the ideal vacation, and
next time I'm not going to lie in the
sun too long, nor will I accept my
friend's alcohol, nor will I be the last
in line for the bathroom, nor will I
drive my car. Finally, I definitely
won't accept any of my friend's pizza.
