# Rush alcohol policy tightened
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER 
Departing from a tradition of
staying out of students' personal
lives, University officials announced
yesterday that "birthdate" identi
fication will be required for alcoholic
beverages to be obtained at fraterni
ty rush functions. In addition, no liq
uor can be served on school days.
The decision was made by the
Dean of Student Affairs Committee
on Alcohol which has been review
ing the University's general alcohol
policy for several months.
Commenting on the new policy,
Alice Supton, assistant dean of Resi
dential Education, said, "I know it
sounds radical, but as far as I'm con
cerned, those kids are far too radical.
"We're doing it for their safety and
health — particularly for their livers."
Supton said the committee is still
working out the logistics of checking
IDs at the frat houses. Most likely,
either RAs or other University em
ployees will be asked to guard the
bars or kegs of beer that are at the
parties. They will be trained to spot
fake IDs by bouncers from local bars,
including the Oasis and the Dutch
Goose, according to Supton, who
added that invalid IDs will be con
fiscated.
"We had already taken care of that
when we required non-alcoholic al
ternatives," he said. "The law would
probably never catch us anyway," he
added.
In addition to the requirement for
non-alcoholic alternatives, past poli
cy stated that no liquor could be
served after 10 p.m. on weeknights.
Supton said that the committee de
cided to stiffen that regulation "be
cause the students drink more than
enough on the weekends during
rush anyway."
She added, "God only knows what
else they're polluting their bodies
with."
Inter-fraternity Council President
Andy Beal called the new policy
"outrageous and ludicrous."
He said, "It's simply unfair to in
trude in our lives in this way. Even
though a few people under 21 may
drink at rush parties, they're not chil
dren."
Responding to Supton's claim that
the new policy will enable freshmen
and sophomores rushing to make
more coherent decisions about
which fraternity to join since they will
he sober at the parties, Beal said the
regulations will only hurt the
fraternities.

"It's obvious that less people will
attend the parties and houses are
going to have a harder time meeting
quota," he said. "I'd go as far as to say
that the University is trying to get rid
of some frats ....
"Maybe Supton thinks frat men are
sexist."
Although Bret Fuller, Phi Delta
Theta social chairman, refused to
comment on possible sexism among
Phi Delts, he said he is not worried
about meeting quota. "We have a
great house with great guys. No one
needs a drink to have fun here."
However, Fuller added, "I sure am
glad I'm over 211"
Alpha Delta Phi President David
Chenevert was upset when notified
of the new policy.
Alpha Delt rush may be particular
ly crippled by the "no alcohol during
the week" regulation because their
Wednesday night Happy Hourstradi
tionally attract many prospective
members.
Kappa Sigma brother Matt Gray
son said his house will be similarily
hurt because they too have drink
oriented gatherings on Wednesdays.
"I plan to speak to one of the Univer
sity chiefs about this," he said.
Vance McMahan, a member of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said he person
ally is not in agreement with the poli
cy, but others in his house are not op
posed to it. "We're the milk-and
cookie frat anyway."
Beta Theta Pi senior Larry Band has
a reputation as a teetotaler, but said
he likes to see others drink. "I espe
cially like to talk to girls who are gigg
ly," he said.
"I guess they'll just have to get a
rush off the caffeine in Tab now, " he
added.
The Delta Upsilon house in general
was not pleased with the new policy.
Geoff Bland said, "No way, man;"
Ben Wilson said, "Rush will be a bore
this year;" and jim Miles said, "I'll
punch whoever thought of this one."
Luke Cole and Dougjehl, DU pres
ident-elect and vice-president-elect
respectively, are planning to write a
formal protest to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy since they are
in Washington, D.C. for spring quar
ter and thus are unable to protest in
person.
"I'm not stoked, dude," Cole said
in a Daily telephone interview.
Jehl expressed concern about at
tracting rush hostesses — tradi
tionally freshmen and sophomore
females who enjoy drinking.

Departing from a tradition of
staying out of students' personal
lives, University officials announced
yesterday that "birthdate" identi
fication will be required for alcoholic
beverages to be obtained at fraterni
ty rush functions. In addition, no liq
uor can be served on school days.
The decision was made by the
Dean of Student Affairs Committee
on Alcohol which has been review
ing the University's general alcohol
policy for several months.
Commenting on the new policy,
Alice Supton, assistant dean of Resi
dential Education, said, "I know it
sounds radical, but as far as I'm con
cerned, those kids are far too radical.
"We're doing it for their safety and
health — particularly for their livers."
Supton said the committee is still
working out the logistics of checking
IDs at the frat houses. Most likely,
either RAs or other University em
ployees will be asked to guard the
bars or kegs of beer that are at the
parties. They will be trained to spot
fake IDs by bouncers from local bars,
including the Oasis and the Dutch
Goose, according to Supton, who
added that invalid IDs will be con
fiscated.
"We had already taken care of that
when we required non-alcoholic al
ternatives," he said. "The law would
probably never catch us anyway," he
added.
In addition to the requirement for
non-alcoholic alternatives, past poli
cy stated that no liquor could be
served after 10 p.m. on weeknights.
Supton said that the committee de
cided to stiffen that regulation "be
cause the students drink more than
enough on the weekends during
rush anyway."
She added, "God only knows what
else they're polluting their bodies
with."
Inter-fraternity Council President
Andy Beal called the new policy
"outrageous and ludicrous."
He said, "It's simply unfair to in
trude in our lives in this way. Even
though a few people under 21 may
drink at rush parties, they're not chil
dren."
Responding to Supton's claim that
the new policy will enable freshmen
and sophomores rushing to make
more coherent decisions about
which fraternity to join since they will
he sober at the parties, Beal said the
regulations will only hurt the
fraternities.

"It's obvious that less people will
attend the parties and houses are
going to have a harder time meeting
quota," he said. "I'd go as far as to say
that the University is trying to get rid
of some frats ....
"Maybe Supton thinks frat men are
sexist."
Although Bret Fuller, Phi Delta
Theta social chairman, refused to
comment on possible sexism among
Phi Delts, he said he is not worried
about meeting quota. "We have a
great house with great guys. No one
needs a drink to have fun here."
However, Fuller added, "I sure am
glad I'm over 211"
Alpha Delta Phi President David
Chenevert was upset when notified
of the new policy.
Alpha Delt rush may be particular
ly crippled by the "no alcohol during
the week" regulation because their
Wednesday night Happy Hourstradi
tionally attract many prospective
members.
Kappa Sigma brother Matt Gray
son said his house will be similarily
hurt because they too have drink
oriented gatherings on Wednesdays.
"I plan to speak to one of the Univer
sity chiefs about this," he said.
Vance McMahan, a member of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said he person
ally is not in agreement with the poli
cy, but others in his house are not op
posed to it. "We're the milk-and
cookie frat anyway."
