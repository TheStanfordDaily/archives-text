For us parents out in the boondocks, will you please
clarify conflicting information regarding the rate in
creases for 1983-84. The February, 1983, Observer, p.
9, says,"The trustees approved an 11.4 percent in
crease in the basic undergraduate room and board
rate to $3812 from $3423..." The Stanford Daily, p. 1,
February 8, 1983, says,"The University will raise room
and board rates an average of 11.4 percent. The basic
room rate will increase from $3812 to $4423 and the
board rate for 19 meals will increase B.9percent from
$1729 t052083."
Our freshman daughter's total room, board and tui
tion expenses are running about $12,000 for 1982-83
($4OOO per quarter). She tells us she understands that
room, board, and tuition for 1983-84 will run $15,533,
a whopping 29.44 percent increase. Please, publish
the correct amounts.
Distraught Parents
Well, here's egg in our collective face.
Your quotations are absolutely accurate. Un
fortunately, our figures weren't. The Financial Aids
Office will currently give you the following figures for

1983-84: tuition, $9027 (up from $8220); average room
and board in a University dormitory, $3812 (up from
$3423).
How we came to think that room and board next
year would total $6506,1 don't know. Since the person
who wrote the article is higher up than me, I probably
won't find out, either.
I'd be careful before you give your daughter
$15,533 for next year. Financial Aids estimates that the
average undergraduate will need $14,039 to scrape
through a year here in '83-'B4, not counting travel ex
penses.
Why doesn't the Daily give credit to The New York
Times as the source of your crossword puzzles? Does
Eugene T. Maleska (crossword editor of the Times)
syndicate them himselfP Why do you publish the
puzzles several months after they appear in the
Times? Would you consider giving us the special Sun
day puzzles as a bonusP

The Daily does not credit the Times because, as far
as we know, we aren't required to. The puzzles are
syndicated by the New York Times Syndicate, not
Eugene T.; but we print them exactly as we receive
them, and all they say is "Edited by Eugene T.
Maleska."
The puzzles run later than they do in the Times be
cause they build up over breaks (and Saturdays). The
syndicate stipulates that puzzles cannot be run before
they appear in the Times, but says nothing about how
long they can lie around afterward.
If the Da/7y ever comes out on Sunday, I suppose we
would look into running the Sunday puzzle. As it is,
we couldn't afford the space.
We must be doing something right, though. On the
wall here in the office is a note on New York Times
letterhead that reads: "Hello, Stanford Daily Staffers:
It's so nice to hear that I can count you among my afi
cionados and that I have a fan club at the university.
Good luck with your publications — and happy solv
ing! Pax, amor et felicitas — Eugene T. Maleska."
How many calories are there in a potsticker? After

putting away eight of them, my girlfriend wanted to
know this, but the manager of the restaurant could
not provide more information than "we use only lean
pork," etc.

You know, it's funny, but I just couldn't find a listing
for "potstickers" in any nutrition tables. And Chinese
cookbooks don't seem too concerned with calories.
Maybe you can figure something out from the fol
lowing data. A dozen potstickers take about a cup of
flour and anywhere from a quarter to half a pound of
pork. One cup of wheat flour, enriched or not, is
about 400 calories. A pound of pork will range, de
pending on what part of the pig it came from and how
it's sold, from 800 to 1400 calories.
Another variable here is how the potstickers are
cooked. American-Chinese cookbooks will tell you
to start the things in a few tablespoons of oil, then fill
the pan with water and cover it. A real Chinese recipe
will call for frying in half a cup of oil. One tablespoon
of peanut oil, the most common potsticker frying oil,
runs 124 calories.

Maybe you can figure something out from the fol
lowing data. A dozen potstickers take about a cup of
flour and anywhere from a quarter to half a pound of
pork. One cup of wheat flour, enriched or not, is
about 400 calories. A pound of pork will range, de
pending on what part of the pig it came from and how
it's sold, from 800 to 1400 calories.
Another variable here is how the potstickers are
cooked. American-Chinese cookbooks will tell you
to start the things in a few tablespoons of oil, then fill
the pan with water and cover it. A real Chinese recipe
will call for frying in half a cup of oil. One tablespoon
of peanut oil, the most common potsticker frying oil,
runs 124 calories.

For us parents out in the boondocks, will you please
clarify conflicting information regarding the rate in
creases for 1983-84. The February, 1983, Observer, p.
9, says,"The trustees approved an 11.4 percent in
crease in the basic undergraduate room and board
rate to $3812 from $3423..." The Stanford Daily, p. 1,
February 8, 1983, says,"The University will raise room
and board rates an average of 11.4 percent. The basic
room rate will increase from $3812 to $4423 and the
board rate for 19 meals will increase B.9percent from
$1729 t052083."
Our freshman daughter's total room, board and tui
tion expenses are running about $12,000 for 1982-83
($4OOO per quarter). She tells us she understands that
room, board, and tuition for 1983-84 will run $15,533,
a whopping 29.44 percent increase. Please, publish
the correct amounts.
Distraught Parents
Well, here's egg in our collective face.
Your quotations are absolutely accurate. Un
fortunately, our figures weren't. The Financial Aids
Office will currently give you the following figures for

1983-84: tuition, $9027 (up from $8220); average room
and board in a University dormitory, $3812 (up from
$3423).
How we came to think that room and board next
year would total $6506,1 don't know. Since the person
who wrote the article is higher up than me, I probably
won't find out, either.
I'd be careful before you give your daughter
$15,533 for next year. Financial Aids estimates that the
average undergraduate will need $14,039 to scrape
through a year here in '83-'B4, not counting travel ex
penses.
Why doesn't the Daily give credit to The New York
Times as the source of your crossword puzzles? Does
Eugene T. Maleska (crossword editor of the Times)
syndicate them himselfP Why do you publish the
puzzles several months after they appear in the
Times? Would you consider giving us the special Sun
day puzzles as a bonusP

The Daily does not credit the Times because, as far
as we know, we aren't required to. The puzzles are
syndicated by the New York Times Syndicate, not
Eugene T.; but we print them exactly as we receive
them, and all they say is "Edited by Eugene T.
Maleska."
The puzzles run later than they do in the Times be
cause they build up over breaks (and Saturdays). The
syndicate stipulates that puzzles cannot be run before
they appear in the Times, but says nothing about how
long they can lie around afterward.
If the Da/7y ever comes out on Sunday, I suppose we
would look into running the Sunday puzzle. As it is,
we couldn't afford the space.
We must be doing something right, though. On the
wall here in the office is a note on New York Times
letterhead that reads: "Hello, Stanford Daily Staffers:
It's so nice to hear that I can count you among my afi
cionados and that I have a fan club at the university.
Good luck with your publications — and happy solv
ing! Pax, amor et felicitas — Eugene T. Maleska."
How many calories are there in a potsticker? After

putting away eight of them, my girlfriend wanted to
know this, but the manager of the restaurant could
not provide more information than "we use only lean
pork," etc.

You know, it's funny, but I just couldn't find a listing
for "potstickers" in any nutrition tables. And Chinese
cookbooks don't seem too concerned with calories.
