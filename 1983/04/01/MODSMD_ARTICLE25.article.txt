# RESTAURANTS
## When spring springs, spring for a snack al fresco 
### 
Remember back in the good, Jry old days when
you could stroll with a fro yo around the shopping
center, amble through White Plaza with one of the
fruit vendor's apples, share a burger with the mos
quitos at Zot's. . . .
Well the kind of weather that you need to do that
finally seemed to have arrived yesterday and so,
struck by sun fever, we headed for The |oy of junque
and its patio on El Camino Real near Page Mill Road.
The dozen or so outdoor tables were filled when
we arrived, but we figured a table would open up by
the time our food was ready. We were wrong.
After ordering a Gobbler sandwich ($3.25) and a
baked potato stuffed with taco filling ($2.75) at the
Joy's counter, we stood outside and watched the
tables intently. No one left.
Finally, a waitress brought our lunch, glanced at the
tables, shrugged her shoulders and led us inside.
The sandwich was relatively non-descript; sliced
turkey breast, lettuce, tomatoes, sprouts, and a
gloppy mixture of grey poupon and mayonnaise . . .
we think. Plagued with the common pita bread
shortcoming of layered ingredients, it was a sandwich
which at various points appeared to be a sprout
sandwich, then a tomato sandwich, and finally a tur
key chunk sandwich.
The potato, called a Don Juan, contained ground
beef, onions, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and to
mato. It was tasty and filling, but the plastic plate it
came on was too small to hold the knife and fork I
needed to eat it. There is no placemat on the table, no
room on the plate, and therefore no place to set the
utensils while eating.
The )oy is tiny and relatively new, but has appar

ently attracted a loyal following. A large, handwritten
petition posted on the front window asks the restau
rant to start serving breakfast as well as lunch and
dinner.
We weren't the only ones who wanted fun in the
sun yesterday noon. The New Varsity, 456 University
Ave., Palo Alto, served lunch outdoors to a crowd
yesterday. After it was all over, a manager there
lamented, "We were the most popular place down
town today, and I 'm sweating to prove it." The restau
rant will soon offer live music at outdoor lunches and
dinners, he said.
Besides the Joy of Junque, at least four nearby
self-service restaurants offer outdoor dining.
At the Oasis Beer Garden, better known simply as
the "O", newly-installed heaters keep the garden
open "whenever it's not raining and they're not
spraying for the Medfly," according to one em
ployee. The "O" is at 241 El Camino Real, Menlo Park.
Kirk's, at 361 California Ave., Palo Alto, serves
steakburgers and hot dogs from 11 a.m. Patrons can
eat at outdoor tables anytime.
At the Alpine Inn, or Zot's, on Alpine Road in Por
tola Valley, several cats haunt old, wooden picnic
tables scattered around a fenced-in yard. This is
pleasant if you like cats.
Inside Liddicoat's is a long, skinny aisle lined with
mini-restaurants. Each offers a different kind of food,
so an adventuresome (and hungry) diner could load a
single tray with sushi, lasagne, felafel, chow mein,
pizza, fancy French pastry and a Mrs. Field's cookie.
Most seating is inside, but a few tables cluster in front
of the entrance on University Avenue in Palo Alto.
Outdoor dining is more of a problem at a full

service restaurant, where the manager and the pa
trons must agree that the weather is tine before an
outdoor area will be opened for the season.
The Fish Market, 3150 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, has
solved the problem with an all-weather patio.
Three area French restaurants serve outdoors. Le
Meursault, which bills itself as "Palo Alto's wine res
taurant," is now serving lunch in its pleasant, high
walled garden. The restaurant, at 651 Emerson, Palo
Alto, will open the patio for dinner guests when wea-
Jher permits.
At La Terasse, where the phone is answered with a
hearty Bon jour, the title terrace isn't open yet. Some
time this month, the restuarant hopes to begin offer
ing lunch and dinner al fresco.
The Holiday's Inn's Chez lustine, at 625 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto, serves a more than ample Sunday
brunch outside.
At Casa Real, the Mexican restaurant closest to
campus, customers can eat lunch on the patio. The
outdoor area will be open for dinner in the near
future, the restaurant reports.
A similar situation currently exists at The Gatehouse,
265 Lytton, Palo Alto. The "picturesque courtyard'' is
now open only at brunchtime and lunchtime.
Around the corner at 412 Emerson, the patio at Bun
Busters (AKAThe Emerson Street Bar and Grill) isn't in
use yet. When spring springs a little more, the restau
rant will serve food and drinks outside.
Mac Arthur Park, 27 University Ave., Palo Alto,
serves outdoor lunches and Sunday brunches on the
patio in the daytime. Cocktails are served outside
anytime.

shortcoming of layered ingredients, it was a sandwich
which at various points appeared to be a sprout
sandwich, then a tomato sandwich, and finally a tur
key chunk sandwich.
The potato, called a Don Juan, contained ground
beef, onions, sour cream, cheese, lettuce and to
mato. It was tasty and filling, but the plastic plate it
came on was too small to hold the knife and fork I
needed to eat it. There is no placemat on the table, no
room on the plate, and therefore no place to set the
utensils while eating.
The )oy is tiny and relatively new, but has appar

ently attracted a loyal following. A large, handwritten
petition posted on the front window asks the restau
rant to start serving breakfast as well as lunch and
dinner.
We weren't the only ones who wanted fun in the
sun yesterday noon. The New Varsity, 456 University
Ave., Palo Alto, served lunch outdoors to a crowd
yesterday. After it was all over, a manager there
lamented, "We were the most popular place down
town today, and I 'm sweating to prove it." The restau
rant will soon offer live music at outdoor lunches and
dinners, he said.
Besides the Joy of Junque, at least four nearby
self-service restaurants offer outdoor dining.
At the Oasis Beer Garden, better known simply as
the "O", newly-installed heaters keep the garden
open "whenever it's not raining and they're not
spraying for the Medfly," according to one em
ployee. The "O" is at 241 El Camino Real, Menlo Park.
Kirk's, at 361 California Ave., Palo Alto, serves
steakburgers and hot dogs from 11 a.m. Patrons can
eat at outdoor tables anytime.
At the Alpine Inn, or Zot's, on Alpine Road in Por
tola Valley, several cats haunt old, wooden picnic
tables scattered around a fenced-in yard. This is
pleasant if you like cats.
Inside Liddicoat's is a long, skinny aisle lined with
mini-restaurants. Each offers a different kind of food,
so an adventuresome (and hungry) diner could load a
single tray with sushi, lasagne, felafel, chow mein,
pizza, fancy French pastry and a Mrs. Field's cookie.
Most seating is inside, but a few tables cluster in front
of the entrance on University Avenue in Palo Alto.
Outdoor dining is more of a problem at a full

service restaurant, where the manager and the pa
trons must agree that the weather is tine before an
outdoor area will be opened for the season.
The Fish Market, 3150 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, has
solved the problem with an all-weather patio.
Three area French restaurants serve outdoors. Le
Meursault, which bills itself as "Palo Alto's wine res
taurant," is now serving lunch in its pleasant, high
walled garden. The restaurant, at 651 Emerson, Palo
Alto, will open the patio for dinner guests when wea-
Jher permits.
At La Terasse, where the phone is answered with a
hearty Bon jour, the title terrace isn't open yet. Some
time this month, the restuarant hopes to begin offer
ing lunch and dinner al fresco.
The Holiday's Inn's Chez lustine, at 625 El Camino
Real, Palo Alto, serves a more than ample Sunday
brunch outside.
At Casa Real, the Mexican restaurant closest to
campus, customers can eat lunch on the patio. The
outdoor area will be open for dinner in the near
future, the restaurant reports.
A similar situation currently exists at The Gatehouse,
265 Lytton, Palo Alto. The "picturesque courtyard'' is
now open only at brunchtime and lunchtime.
Around the corner at 412 Emerson, the patio at Bun
Busters (AKAThe Emerson Street Bar and Grill) isn't in
use yet. When spring springs a little more, the restau
rant will serve food and drinks outside.
Mac Arthur Park, 27 University Ave., Palo Alto,
serves outdoor lunches and Sunday brunches on the
patio in the daytime. Cocktails are served outside
anytime.

Remember back in the good, Jry old days when
you could stroll with a fro yo around the shopping
center, amble through White Plaza with one of the
fruit vendor's apples, share a burger with the mos
quitos at Zot's. . . .
Well the kind of weather that you need to do that
finally seemed to have arrived yesterday and so,
struck by sun fever, we headed for The |oy of junque
and its patio on El Camino Real near Page Mill Road.
The dozen or so outdoor tables were filled when
we arrived, but we figured a table would open up by
the time our food was ready. We were wrong.
After ordering a Gobbler sandwich ($3.25) and a
baked potato stuffed with taco filling ($2.75) at the
Joy's counter, we stood outside and watched the
tables intently. No one left.
Finally, a waitress brought our lunch, glanced at the
tables, shrugged her shoulders and led us inside.
The sandwich was relatively non-descript; sliced
turkey breast, lettuce, tomatoes, sprouts, and a
gloppy mixture of grey poupon and mayonnaise . . .
we think. Plagued with the common pita bread
shortcoming of layered ingredients, it was a sandwich
which at various points appeared to be a sprout
sandwich, then a tomato sandwich, and finally a tur
key chunk sandwich.
