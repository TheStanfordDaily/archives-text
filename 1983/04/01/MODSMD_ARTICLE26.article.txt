Jose's used to be one of those places
that catches your eye and you spend at
least half a dozen trips going by it think
ing, hmm, I'll have to try that place. At
least that's how it was when the sign
over the front door read "Jose's —the
worst pizza in town."
That sign is down now, but inside are
other references to "the baddest pizza"
or "the baddest ribs in town." An old
roommate is convinced that the origins
of the first sign lie in translation of 70s
slang for Cuban born Jose who thought
worst meant best.
Clearly, it's not worth checking into,
for that would ruin a raft of good
theories that give first-daters some
thing to speculate upon as they drive by

enroute to the Acapulco or the Fish
Market.
Back to the review. The first time I
went to Jose's was a year ago, when the
formica table and shellacked
hangman's noose hanging from a rafter
were only undercut by the cardboard
like pizza.
But dinner there recently, at the urg
ing of several friends who insisted that
the place had changed, proved that in
deed, the food is not the "worst" and
that some dishes are really quite good.
Jose's specials are Cuban pizza,
Argentinian pizza, smoked ribs, duck
and chicken and the empanada—a
baked cheese and mushroom or meat
pie.
The Cuban pizza has a wheatgerm,
almost cracker-like crust. Jose's selec
tion for this and for the Argentinian
pizza (sourdough and thick crust) are
standard, despite the italicized pre

sumably Cuban and Argentinian names
provided. Come on, a mushroom with
olives and sausage pizza — under
Cuban style, a Holguin, under Argenti
nian, a San Luis—smell as sweet. Prices
range from $5.65 for a small cheese, to
$14.90 for a large "everything."
Still remembering my first meal at
Jose's, I decided to order the smoked
duck, $7.95, which is cooked over a
charcoal fire until tender and juicy, and
served with Spanish rice, black beans
and sourdough bread; my dinner part
ner chose a beef empanada.
Both of us began our meals with a trip
to the salad bar. Somehow, we felt bet
rayed by the carrot shavings that
everyone thought were cheddar
cheese. With sidelong glances, we al
lowed a few (make that most) of the
orange slivers to slip out of the salad
tong's clutches, back into the bowl to
fool others.

The salad bar was clearly not to be
trusted, we surmised—no mushrooms,
and the ol' bait and switch with the car
rot shavings—but a tasty house dres
sing restored some of our optimism
about the meal ahead.
My partner, a master of appetite
spoiling adjectives, described the
smoked duck that arrived in front of me
as looking "shellacked." After slicing
through the tough skin and quarter
inch of fat, however, the meat was ten
der and tasty. Unfortunately, not
enough barbeque sauce was supplied
in which to dip the naked duck limbs.
Glancing around, it seems that this
problem does not happen with the ribs
and we overheard several patrons re
marking how K°od they were.
The empanada was nicely prepared,
quite filling and had a good taste. It's a
selection that should be ordered care
fully, however, since it comes in a

rather heavy, rich crust, it would prob
ably discourage one with a not-too
hearty appetite.
In addition to the items we ordered,
and the pizzas, lose's also offers cal
zone pizzas, Cuban style burritos and
enchiladas—distinguished by a splat of
black beans—and, for the adventurous
parties of six, Paella Valencia, a combi
nation of rice, string beans, peas,
clams, squid, shrimp, crab and chicken
with special spices, at the hefty price of
$14.50 per person, and the stipulation
that it must be ordered 24 hours in ad
vance.
Jose's is a hit-or-miss kind of place. A
hearty appetite will be satisfied by dis
hes like empanada or the burritos and
enchiladas. To those who like a
wheatgerm crust pizza, this one is ap
parently good, since we also overheard
several people particularly pleased with
their decision to order one.
