# Media escapism: daytime drama with a lot of Stanford actors
## 
### AMY BERNHARD JAY FRAMSON 
Stanford students do it in dark,
cave-like recreation rooms, in dorm
rooms and even at breakfast tables.
They do it after dinner, during lunch
and between classes.
When they are not hitting the
books, many Stanford students are
playing video games, or watching
movies, television sitcoms and even
(gasp!) soap operas.
The media use survey revealed that
turning on the radio or television is a
way to escape loneliness for many
students. Some media, such as televi
sion and movies, offer students a
chance for social interaction, while
for others, media use is simply a way
to avoid the rigors of studying.
A check of living units on campus
turned up several students who were
willing to talk about their u.->e of media
as escape. Many of them have be
come quite attached to a favorite
magazine or television show that
helps them get through a working
student day.
At Lagunita and ATO house, All My
Children is the rage among lunchtime
soap opera junkies. Residents of

these dorms revel in the machinations
of the loathsome Opal Gardner, prop
rietress of the Glamorama, Pine Val
ley's premier health spa.
I think Opal's my favorite, because
she's the funniest," said Lagunita res
ident Shannon Daugherty "She and
her spandex pants."
Asked why he liked the show, ATO
resident Darren Woodruff quipped,
"It's a lot of the same smut that goes
on at Stanford."
A check at Naranja during one of
the rare warm and sunny days of
Winter Quarter revealed seven
people huddled in a tiny, darkened
television room watching the daytime
drama.
"I hate Enid," one student said.
"Enid's the worst. Enid and Liza and
Tad "
Television set 1 at the dorms be
come a gathering spot again at dinner
time. The after-dinner favorite at
American Studies house is the CBS
Evening News which has been a 7 p.m.
ritual for more than a year. One stu
dent said he thought that the popular
ity of the news show might have
something to do with Dan Rather.

It's the vest," he speculated.
But at Lambda Nu, house members
avoid the evening news and opt in
stead for Gilligan's Island and Ihe
Courtship of Eddie's Esther. A spot
check at ATO revealed a small group
of students unwinding with Eight Is
Enough, although one student said
Lost in Space has also become popu
lar since Star Trek went off the air.
Nighttime favorites in the dorms in
clude M'A'S'H and Hill Street Blues,
which also attract loyal daily and
weekly rerun followings at ATO and
American Studies.
Karen Easterbrook, a sophomore,
said she likes to watch the show be
cause "it's not studying. There's very
little else that's worth watching."
Television is not the only form of
entertainment for the student seeking
to escape from the grind of studying
Other students say that for pleasure
reading they turn to publications
ranging from Business Week to
Playboy.
At The Store, where the New Yorker
shares a rack with Mad Magazine,
manager )ohn Hyde estimates that
magazine and newspaper sales
amount to about $500 a week.

Many students subscribe to favorite
magazines and then share them with
friends. At Kairos House, Dwayne
Virnau's monthly subscription to
Playboy makes the rounds. "You
leave them sitting out and they get
read," Virnau said.
I don't think that many people in
this house read that in depth," he
said, adding, "I only read the inter
views and stuff when I have the time."
While some students go for the
glossy pictures, others seek charts
and graphs. "I get enjoyment from
Forbes," said Al Revere, a senior
majoring in economics and history.
"This year, I'm taking it for an econ
course where it's directly applicable;
also,' I thought it'cJ be a good way to
look for a job."
Sophomore Eric Simone said that
he doesn't subscribe to any maga
zines, ever; though he enjoys regu
larly reading time, Newsweek, Omni
and Scientific American.
"I don't subscribe because in a
place like this where you can go to
Green or Meyer and look through
current magazines, it's not worth it,"
he said. "But if I didn't have access to
those magazines five minutes away, I

would probably subscribe."
Books are another popular form of
escape for students, although not the
ones they read for classes. Stanford
Bookstore book manager jim Arnold,
says the bookstore sells about 100,00 C
trade titles a year. Among those, he
said, mysteries are the most popular.
"Mysteries are definitely in vogue,"
Arnold said, noting that Dashiell
Hammett and John Ie Car re are
among the most popular novelists.
For movie afficionadoes, there are
always the ASSU Sunday Flicks and
the Chaparral Saturday Films, which
attract hoards of students every
weekend. During Winter Quarter,
students chose from popular film of
ferings like The Exorcist, Star Irck II
and The Last Tango in Paris.
And a number of video game fans
can usually be found playing "Par
Man,' 'Donkey Kong," "Frogger "
"Defender" or one i>l seveial other
popular games at the Recreation Cen
ter.
In between eating energy dots and
zapping flying saucers, senior Mike
Hale said that the video games offer "a
change from all the other things you
have to do."
