# A 						cultural deluge
## Chinese students pursue news, information 
### YING-HUANG ZHU 
"When I first came to
Stanford, I felt suddenly
plunged into an overwhelm
ing torrent of information, a
sort of information-shock,"
says Hong Chen, a Chinese
graduate student studying
engineering-economic sys
tems.
On the first registration
day in Maples Pavilion last
autumn, Chen said he was
amazed to find so many
handouts — pamphlets,
newspapers, leaflets, news
letters and ads littered
everywhere on the ground.
"It's a waste of paper, but
also a symbol of an
information-rich society,"
he says.
"The amount of informa
tion coming to me is so
shocking that I can never
hope to receive it all," says
another Chinese student,
Jia-su Chen, from the eco
nomics department.
Both Chens are among
the total 60 registered stu
dents — 45 graduate stu
dents, seven under
graduates and eight non
matriculated students —
from the People's Republic
of China. While adjusting
themselves to the new envi
ronment at Stanford,
Chinese students have
formed their own news
seeking habits.
"I have found most
Chinese students, besides
taking their academic study
as their principal aim at
Stanford, are anxious to
know more about
America,"says Xiao-yan
Zhao, a Chinese graduate
student in the communica
tion department. "And the
way they use most is
through reading newspa
pers and watching televi
sion, ' she adds.
Zhao has recently com
pleted a survey, together
with Michael Chang, a
Ph.D. student in the School
of Education, on Chinese
students' lifestyles and so

cial activities at Stanford.
One of the questions in
their survey mentioned six
ways through which re
spondents can know
America — namely going to
movies, making friends,
travelling, shopping, at
tending parties, reading
newspapers and watching
TV. It then asked them to
choose the one they would
most like to use. Ten of the
17 students listed reading
newspapers and watching
TV as their first choice.
"World news carried on
Stanford Daily is too brief,
so I watch TV for news
everyday," says Xiao-hua
He, a graduate student in
the Dept. of Aeronautics
and Astronautics, who
claims the biggest purchase
he has made since he came
to Stanford is a color TV set.
"Some of the world news
coverage on TV is really
good, and I usually spend
half an hour watching TV
news every evening, but I
hate to see too many ads,"
Chinese student Ping Yang
said.
To help in their quest for
information, especially
news from home, students
from the People's Republic
have easy access to a
Chinese-language newspa
per — People's Daily, Chi
na's largest circulation daily
published in Beijing. Since
late 1981, an American edi
tion of People's Daily has
been printed in San Fran
cisco and most Chinese
students are given a free
subscription to it by the
Chinese government.
Some Chinese students
who have been in America
for several years have
formed the habit of reading
American newspapers
Zhiping Yu, a Ph.D. stu
dent in the electrical en
gineering department, says
he relies on People's Daily
only for home news, and re
lies on American newspa
pers and news magazines

for information about
America and the world.
"I just force myself to
read English newspapers so
as to improve my language
ability."
"For one thing, my major
is economics, and for the
other, the paper has really
good world news coverage
on its front page," Chen ex
plains. living with several
American students in an
apartment in Palo Alto,
Chen has developed the
habit ot reading the news

paper at breakfast every
morning.
Hoover Library's East
Asian section has more than
440 Chinese-language
periodicals, 35 Chinese
language newspapers and
63 Western-language
periodicals published in
China. Among the 35
Chinese newspapers, about
19 are published in China's
mainland, three from
Taiwan and the rest are pub
lished in Flong Kong, Singa
pore or North America.

While being exposed to
more familiar media in
America, many Chinese
students are also learning to
use new media as well.
liasu Chen is now using
computers to do his Time
Series Program (TSP). "Just
push a few buttons, and in
five minutes the computer
will give you all the statistics
of gross national produc
tion, consumption, reve
nue, and taxes of this coun
try for the past 30 or more
years," he says.

Some Chinese students
who have been in America
for several years have
formed the habit of reading
American newspapers

he relies on People's Daily
only for home news, and re

for information about

as to improve my language

American students in an

Chen has developed the
habit ot reading the news

paper at breakfast every
morning.
Hoover Library's East
Asian section has more than
440 Chinese-language
periodicals, 35 Chinese
language newspapers and
63 Western-language
periodicals published in
China. Among the 35
Chinese newspapers, about
19 are published in China's
mainland, three from
Taiwan and the rest are pub
lished in Flong Kong, Singa
pore or North America.

While being exposed to
more familiar media in
America, many Chinese
students are also learning to
use new media as well.
liasu Chen is now using
computers to do his Time
Series Program (TSP). "Just
push a few buttons, and in
five minutes the computer
will give you all the statistics
of gross national produc

try for the past 30 or more
years," he says.
"When I first came to
Stanford, I felt suddenly
plunged into an overwhelm
ing torrent of information, a
sort of information-shock,"
says Hong Chen, a Chinese
graduate student studying
engineering-economic sys
tems.
On the first registration
day in Maples Pavilion last
autumn, Chen said he was
amazed to find so many
handouts — pamphlets,
newspapers, leaflets, news
letters and ads littered
everywhere on the ground.
"It's a waste of paper, but
also a symbol of an
information-rich society,"
he says.
"The amount of informa
tion coming to me is so
shocking that I can never
hope to receive it all," says
another Chinese student,
Jia-su Chen, from the eco
nomics department.
Both Chens are among
the total 60 registered stu
dents — 45 graduate stu
dents, seven under
graduates and eight non
matriculated students —
from the People's Republic
of China. While adjusting
themselves to the new envi
ronment at Stanford,
Chinese students have
formed their own news
seeking habits.
"I have found most
Chinese students, besides
taking their academic study
as their principal aim at
Stanford, are anxious to
know more about
America,"says Xiao-yan
Zhao, a Chinese graduate
student in the communica
tion department. "And the
way they use most is
through reading newspa
pers and watching televi
sion, ' she adds.
Zhao has recently com
pleted a survey, together
with Michael Chang, a
Ph.D. student in the School
of Education, on Chinese
students' lifestyles and so

cial activities at Stanford.
One of the questions in
their survey mentioned six
ways through which re
spondents can know
America — namely going to
movies, making friends,
travelling, shopping, at
tending parties, reading
newspapers and watching
TV. It then asked them to
choose the one they would
most like to use. Ten of the
17 students listed reading
newspapers and watching
TV as their first choice.
"World news carried on
Stanford Daily is too brief,
so I watch TV for news
everyday," says Xiao-hua
He, a graduate student in
the Dept. of Aeronautics
and Astronautics, who
claims the biggest purchase
he has made since he came
to Stanford is a color TV set.
"Some of the world news
coverage on TV is really
good, and I usually spend
half an hour watching TV
news every evening, but I
hate to see too many ads,"
Chinese student Ping Yang
said.
To help in their quest for
information, especially
news from home, students
from the People's Republic
have easy access to a
Chinese-language newspa
per — People's Daily, Chi
na's largest circulation daily
published in Beijing. Since
late 1981, an American edi
tion of People's Daily has
been printed in San Fran
cisco and most Chinese
students are given a free
subscription to it by the
Chinese government.
