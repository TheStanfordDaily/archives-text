When Armando Aguirre-Tamez, a foreign
graduate student studying statistics here,
wants to know what lias really happened in
Mexico, he says he has to go to the periodical
section of Green Library.
1 here, Unoma Suno, one of the major daily
papers in Mexico, is on the newspaper shell.
He looks for the latest peso-dollar exchange
rate.
Aguirre-Tamez's studies at Stanford are
supported by money from the Mexican gov
ernment. For the last three months, the gov
ernment has been sending him only one
sixth of the amount of money he received
before the peso devaluation. What is the cur
rent exchange rate now'
The newspaper lists the exchange rate at
149 pesos per dollar. Aguirre-Tamez knows
he is going to have a hard time; the peso
dollar exchange rate was 26-1 when he left his
country in January of 1982.
"American newspapers are for American
readers," he said. "I don't blame them but I
don't get what I want."
Aguirre-Tamez is interested in the eco
nomic situation in Mexico â€” how the food
prices are changing, what the government is
doing to improve the economy and what
people think of the government policies. He
can't find this information in American
newspapers.
There ate 1835 matriculated foreign stu
dents on the Stanford campus. They account
for 14 percent of the student population, ac
cording to the latest statistics released by
Bechtel International Center.
Stanford p r ovides a surprisingly good col
lection of foreign literature. Green Library
subscribes to 22 foreign newspapers and 2111
foreign magazines; the Hoover Library has
approximately 400 foreign newspapers and
2500 magazines from more than 100 countries
in the world.
For those students who don't find the li
braries or Bechtel International Center's

reading room convenient, a subscription to a
home newspaper or a trip to a local store is a
possibility.
John Leach, a Ph.D. student in applied
physics, buys the Manchester Guardian from
Printer's Inc. Bookstore every week.
"I read the Manc hester Guardian, which is
a review of the European press," said Leach,
who is from England. "But I still feel out of
tout h with I lie details of what is happening."
Erdal Erel, a Ph.D. student in industrial en
gineering from Turkey said his primary
source of information is newspapers from
lurkey. Turkish students on campus jointly
subscribe to a Turkish newspaper that is
mailed to the reading room at trie Interna
tional Center. Erel said Turkish newspapers
"cover much better and they tell reality, un
like the ones here."
Airtin Badr-el-din, a Ph.D. student in elec
trical engineering from Jordan, said he gets
an average of 20 letters from Jordan each
month. He spends about 20 to 30 minutes
each month on the 1 phone talking to people
in Jordan. He sees a lot of visitors from Jor
dan, talks with them, and learns what is going
on at home. But in addition, he has three
newspapers mailed to him from Jordan and
