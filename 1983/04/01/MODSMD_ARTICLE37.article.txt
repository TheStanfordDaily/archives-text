# Card sailors compete in East Coast
## 
### BETH KLEID 
The members of the Stanford Sail
ing Club are making a name for
themselves. The club is now ranked
No. h among college sailing teams.
The sailors have experienced the
competition of tough eastern
schools, and they have been suc
cessful. The Cardinal sailors are on
the rise.
Over spring break the top seven
skippers sailed in two prestigious
regattas on the East Coast. The first
was held in Annapolis and the sec-'
ond was in Boston. In the Fast the
Card encountered a new breed of
competition.
"The eastern schools are more
obviously competitive, ' said
freshman skipper Rona Sassin.
"There is more conservativism in
sailing in the east. Californians are
more casual about the sport, but our
trip East shows our seriousness
about sailing."
At the regatta held at the Naval
Academy in Annapolis, the Card
took fifth place overall. Senior Brian
May with crew of Sassin sailed to
third place, and senior Bill Buckin
gham came in fourth.
After the Annapolis races the team
saw the sights in Washington, D.C
and Boston, and practiced for the
Harvard Boston Dinghy Cup regatta.
In this regatta, Buckingham sailed
with Sassin to first place. "The re
sults of this regatta put us into the
top TO in the country, and the expe
rience gained by sailing against the
East Coast schools will aid our
chances at the Nationals in Texas,"

said May, team c aptain.
Last year the team was ranked
seventh, but they did not farewell in
the nationals, l ast year the team did
not goeast to c ompete. this year the
skippers will be accustomed to the
stiff competition of eastern schools,
and they expect to do better in the
Nationals. "We are all very en
thusiastic about this season. In addi
tion to going out east, we have done
a lot better on the West Coast. I
think we'll do well in the nationals
this year,'' said Sassin.
"We expected to do even better in
theeast over spring break, but it was
hard to adjust to the bigger boats
that eastern colleges use," added
Sassin. The boats used in the East are
called 4205, and the smaller boats
used by Western schools are called
flying juniors or collegiate dinghies.
While half of the team was sailing
in the c hilly east, the other half sailed
a regatta in Los Angeles. In this
South Series regatta senior Carolyn
Brown and her c rew junior Elizabeth
Edmonds sailed to victory in their
division.
"The performance in this regatta
further indicates the possibility of a
strong showing in the Nationals,
said May.
The members of the coed sailing
team prat tic e every clay in Redwood
City. Their coach, )oe Petrucci, is
"great," said Sassin. "He really cares
and wants us to do well. He is always
pushing and pulling us. He moti
vated us to go compete in the East."
The skippers on the team sail in
pairs. One steers the boat, and the

other serves as the crew. "Most
people don't understand what the
crew does. The crew works one of
the sails on the two sail boats, while
the other skipper steers and works
the other sail," said Sassin.
The men and women skippers sail
together in any combination irt coed
regattas. Some regattas are exclu
sively for the women sailors. "Our
women's team is very strong this
year," said Sassin.
An attitude of enthusiasm prevails
among the sailors. "To be on the
team you have to like or love sailing.
Not that mu<h experience is
needed. You just have to be willing
to put a lot of time into sailing. Usu
ally each team member teaches a
sailing class in the spring," con
tinued Sassin.
This weekend most ot the team
will compete in a regatta in Santa
Cruz which will include windsurfers.
I he top skippers will return to the
East in three weeks to compete in
two regattas. The Frees Trophy will
be held in Boston, and the Admirals
Cup in Annapolis. The team is also
planning a Sail-a-thon for this spring
to raise money.
In the east the Stanford sailors
compete against established sailing
schools such as Harvard the Naval
Academy and Turfs. In the West they
sail against tough competitors such
as UC-lrvine and UC-Santa Barbara.
In the midst of this competition
Stanford is being recognized as a top
sailing school. "We are very satisfied
with our progress," said Sassin.

sailing school. "We are very satisfied
with our progress," said Sassin.
The members of the Stanford Sail
ing Club are making a name for
themselves. The club is now ranked
No. h among college sailing teams.
The sailors have experienced the
competition of tough eastern
schools, and they have been suc
cessful. The Cardinal sailors are on
the rise.
Over spring break the top seven
skippers sailed in two prestigious
regattas on the East Coast. The first
was held in Annapolis and the sec-'
ond was in Boston. In the Fast the
Card encountered a new breed of
competition.
"The eastern schools are more
obviously competitive, ' said
freshman skipper Rona Sassin.
"There is more conservativism in
sailing in the east. Californians are
more casual about the sport, but our
trip East shows our seriousness
about sailing."
At the regatta held at the Naval
Academy in Annapolis, the Card
took fifth place overall. Senior Brian
May with crew of Sassin sailed to
third place, and senior Bill Buckin
gham came in fourth.
After the Annapolis races the team
saw the sights in Washington, D.C
and Boston, and practiced for the
Harvard Boston Dinghy Cup regatta.
In this regatta, Buckingham sailed
with Sassin to first place. "The re
sults of this regatta put us into the
top TO in the country, and the expe
rience gained by sailing against the
East Coast schools will aid our
chances at the Nationals in Texas,"

said May, team c aptain.
Last year the team was ranked
seventh, but they did not farewell in
the nationals, l ast year the team did
not goeast to c ompete. this year the
skippers will be accustomed to the
stiff competition of eastern schools,
and they expect to do better in the
Nationals. "We are all very en
thusiastic about this season. In addi
tion to going out east, we have done
a lot better on the West Coast. I
think we'll do well in the nationals
this year,'' said Sassin.
"We expected to do even better in
theeast over spring break, but it was
hard to adjust to the bigger boats
that eastern colleges use," added
Sassin. The boats used in the East are
called 4205, and the smaller boats
used by Western schools are called
flying juniors or collegiate dinghies.
While half of the team was sailing
in the c hilly east, the other half sailed
a regatta in Los Angeles. In this
South Series regatta senior Carolyn
Brown and her c rew junior Elizabeth
Edmonds sailed to victory in their
division.
"The performance in this regatta
further indicates the possibility of a
strong showing in the Nationals,
said May.
The members of the coed sailing
team prat tic e every clay in Redwood
City. Their coach, )oe Petrucci, is
"great," said Sassin. "He really cares
and wants us to do well. He is always
pushing and pulling us. He moti
vated us to go compete in the East."
The skippers on the team sail in
pairs. One steers the boat, and the

other serves as the crew. "Most
people don't understand what the
crew does. The crew works one of
the sails on the two sail boats, while
the other skipper steers and works
the other sail," said Sassin.
The men and women skippers sail
together in any combination irt coed
regattas. Some regattas are exclu
sively for the women sailors. "Our
women's team is very strong this
year," said Sassin.
An attitude of enthusiasm prevails
among the sailors. "To be on the
team you have to like or love sailing.
Not that mu<h experience is
needed. You just have to be willing
to put a lot of time into sailing. Usu
ally each team member teaches a
sailing class in the spring," con
tinued Sassin.
This weekend most ot the team
will compete in a regatta in Santa
Cruz which will include windsurfers.
I he top skippers will return to the
East in three weeks to compete in
two regattas. The Frees Trophy will
be held in Boston, and the Admirals
Cup in Annapolis. The team is also
planning a Sail-a-thon for this spring
to raise money.
In the east the Stanford sailors
compete against established sailing
schools such as Harvard the Naval
Academy and Turfs. In the West they
sail against tough competitors such
as UC-lrvine and UC-Santa Barbara.
In the midst of this competition
Stanford is being recognized as a top
sailing school. "We are very satisfied
with our progress," said Sassin.
