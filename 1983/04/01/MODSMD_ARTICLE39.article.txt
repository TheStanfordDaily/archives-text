NBA players strike averted
New York — The National Basketball As
sociation averted a threatened strike when its
players' union and management agreed on a
tentative contract yesterday that will make
the league the first to guarantee players a
share of gross revenues.
The proposed four-year pact will guaran
tee players a 53 percent share of gross reven
ues, effective with the 1903-84 season. But key
salary cap provisions will not begin until the
following year.
he cap would prevent teams from signing
other clubs' free agents or trading for players
who would increase their payroll. It also re
quires teams to spend a certain amount on
salaries, and if they do not have enough mon
ey to reach that figure, the NBA would use
other teams' revenues to bring the struggling
clubs up to the minimum standard.
However, the five teams with the highest
payrolls — Los Angeles, New jersey, New
York, Philadelphia and Seattle — will be
frozen at their current salary levels next sea
son, before the salary cap provision takes ef
fect.
The union, which had set a Saturday strike
deadline, will considerthe proposal Monday.
Larry Fleisher, the union's general counsel
and chief negotiator, said ratification was ex
pected by the 23 player representatives.
"It's a landmark labor agreement in pro
fessional sports," said NBA Commissioner
Larry O'Brien, who announced the pact on
behalf of the NBA Board of Governors. The
board has approved the settlement.
A strike would have been the third by a
professional sports league in as many years. In
1981, baseball players struck for 50 days; last
year, NFL players struck for 57 days.
Because of the minimum salaries and rev
enue sharing, Lanier said, "teams will be able
to compete with each other on an equal basis.
The large teams like Los Angeles and New
Vo'k jvould be bidding basically at the same
level as all the other teams in the league. This
is something the league has been concerned
about for year? and had finally ac
complished."

NBA players strike averted
New York — The National Basketball As
sociation averted a threatened strike when its
players' union and management agreed on a
tentative contract yesterday that will make
the league the first to guarantee players a
share of gross revenues.
The proposed four-year pact will guaran
tee players a 53 percent share of gross reven
ues, effective with the 1903-84 season. But key
salary cap provisions will not begin until the
following year.
he cap would prevent teams from signing
other clubs' free agents or trading for players
who would increase their payroll. It also re
quires teams to spend a certain amount on
salaries, and if they do not have enough mon
ey to reach that figure, the NBA would use
other teams' revenues to bring the struggling
clubs up to the minimum standard.
However, the five teams with the highest
payrolls — Los Angeles, New jersey, New
York, Philadelphia and Seattle — will be
frozen at their current salary levels next sea
son, before the salary cap provision takes ef
fect.
The union, which had set a Saturday strike
deadline, will considerthe proposal Monday.
Larry Fleisher, the union's general counsel
and chief negotiator, said ratification was ex
pected by the 23 player representatives.
"It's a landmark labor agreement in pro
fessional sports," said NBA Commissioner
Larry O'Brien, who announced the pact on
behalf of the NBA Board of Governors. The
board has approved the settlement.
A strike would have been the third by a
professional sports league in as many years. In
1981, baseball players struck for 50 days; last
year, NFL players struck for 57 days.
Because of the minimum salaries and rev
enue sharing, Lanier said, "teams will be able
to compete with each other on an equal basis.
The large teams like Los Angeles and New
Vo'k jvould be bidding basically at the same
level as all the other teams in the league. This
is something the league has been concerned
about for year? and had finally ac
complished."
