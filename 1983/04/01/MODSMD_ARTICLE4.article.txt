Watt to leave post
Washington — Interior Secretary James
Watt resigned his post yesterday after a se
cret memo obtained by The Washington
Post revealed that he hoped someday to "fill
the seas with oil rigs and cement America's
wilderness lands."
The handwritten memo, addressed to a
top official in the Exxon Corporation and
signed by Watt, said, "Don't worry about
the federal oil leasing desicions coming up.
I have it all taken care of. If I had my way, we
would fill the seas with oil rigs and cement
America's wilderness lands."
The release of the memo caused an im
mediate public outcry and a call for Watt's
resignation by Democrat and Republican

leaders. Reagan announced the acceptance
of Watt's resignation during a televised
press conference late yesterday afternoon.
Watt claimed that the remark was a "stu
pid, unfortunate joke" and that he re
mained committed to preserving America's
wildlife.
"It was a just a little, stupid, unfortunate
joke between me and Williamson. The rec
ord shows that I have always remained com
mitted to protecting America's wildlife," he
said at the press conference as he stood with
his wife and two children. Both Watt and his
wife wiped tears from their eyes during the
conference.
Watt has been criticized for previous off
the-cuff remarks. Last fall he told a New

York Times reporter, "when you've seen
one endangered species, you've seen them
all."
Reagan defended Watt's past record —
calling him a "dedicated public servant" —
but described the memo as "very regret
able." He also criticized the national press
for biased coverage of recent developments
in his administration.
Plant leaks radiation
Sacramento — A cloud of radiation was re
leased from the Rancho Seco nuclear power
plant 20 miles outside this city after what
plant officials called "an unfortunate acci
dent." Officials claimed the cloud, which is
headed toward San Francisco and is ex

pected to reach the area tonight, poses no
danger to the public.
"The cloud will raise radiation in the air to
a level no higher than you would get stand'
ing at the top of a mountain or sticking your
head in a microwave oven," a Sacramento
Municipal Utilities District official said.
Gov. Deukmejian arrived at the plant
minutes after the accident.
The accident is the first major one in this
country since the Three Mile Island acci
dent four years ago.
Reporters in towns along the path of the
radiation cloud said some animals, includ
ing cows and dogs, had experienced violent
periods of vomiting, but officials could not
confirm these incidents.
