Albuquerque, N.M. — Louis
ville coach Denny Crurn says
h? won't be changing his strat
egy when his No. 2 Cardinals
meet top-ranked Houston in
the semifinals of the NCAA
basketball tournament this
weekend.
"We're not going to change
what we do," Crum said Wed
nesday. "We've got to do what
we do best."
That includes using the press
on defense, Crum said, despite
the danger of allowing Hous
ton's ball-dunking big men to
go unchallenged underneath
the basket.
"Their rebounding and

board play is going to give us
some problems," Crum said.
Houston coach Guy Lewis
said 7-foot sophomore Akeem
Olajuwon will lead that effort.
Asked what Olajuwon does
best, Lewis said, "Rebounding,
scoring, shooting and blocking
shots."
The comments came Wed
nesday during the first joint
news conference by the four
coaches whose teams have
made it to college sports'
biggest event. Lewis, Crum,
Georgia's Hugh Durham and
North Carolina State's Jim Val
vano talked with reporters via a
telephone-conference call.
Crum and Lewis said they be

lieved the attention given to
their Saturday semifinal game
is overblown and that the win
ner is no shoo-in against the
victor of the other semifinal.
Valvano got to say the least
during the conference because
of technical problems with the
call. But even through the
static, it was clear he was in
good spirits.
"We have become a profes
sional pep rally," Valvano said,
adding that there have been
four rallies of 5000 to 6000
the school since the
Wolfpack upset Virginia on
Saturday.

Derreck Whittenburg, North
Carolina State's long-range
shooter, missed practice
Thursday for Saturday's NCAA
basketball semifinal because of
the flu.
"He has a 101 fever," said
North Carolina State Coach Jim
Valvano at a news conference
before the workout for the
semifinal against IBth-ranked
Georgia. "He has a bit of the flu
and is under medication."
"We hope it's just a 24-hour
thing," said assistant trainer
Jim Rehbock. "With rest and
medication, hopefully he'll be
ready Saturday."


Stanford's men's volleyball posted a 3-1 victory over
Loyola-Mary mount Wednesday night at Maples Pavilion.
