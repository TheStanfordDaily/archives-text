"The horror film genre
is a branch of filmmaking

magnificent films, but
should have produced
far more."
— William Everson
Frankenstein (1931) ★
Lagunita Dining Room; Larkin
West Lounge
Not Mary Shelley, really, but
in its own way quite marvelous.
Universal's horror expert,
James Whale, directed, and he
certainly knew what he was
doing: though the style is early
talkie Hollywood Gothic (the
source of the Garrett Fort-Fran
cis Faragoh-John L. Balderston
script is actually a stage play by
Peggy Webling), the movie is
still effective half a century lat
er. Boris Karloff's un
complicated performance as
the monster is surprisingly
touching. With Colin Clive as
Frankenstein, Mae Clarke, John
Boles, Edward Van Sloan,
Frederick Kerr and Dwight
Frye.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
Tuesday (Larkin).
One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest ★
Terman Auditorium
Ken Kesey's novel, one of the
signal books of the '60s, is the
tale of a renegade in a psy
chiatric hospital, told by anoth
er patient, a paranoid
schizophrenic; feverous and
eruptive, it would probably re
quire a director of Martin
Scorsese's caliber to translate it
to the screen faithfully — it's
certainly beyond the talents of
Mil os Forma n. But the
screenwriters, Lawrence
Hauben and Bo Goldman,
turned it into a more conven
tional, third-person narrative —
a first-rate one — and Forman
did a fine job with it. It's his best
sustained movie. Readers of the
novel pegged Jack Nicholson
for the role of McMurphy, the
rebel, even before Forman did,
but though he might have been
tempted to simply skate
through it, Nicholson gives an
unpredictable performance
that may be, along with The Last
Detail, his most impressive
work. The more unusual casting
coups are in the selection of
two relative unknowns, Louise
Fletcher and Brad Dourif, for
the roles of Nurse Ratched
(who must, in order for the
script to work, be considerably
more comprehensible than in
the book) and Billy Bibbitt;
both are superb.
Plays tomorrow evening.

Frenzy (1972)
Kresge Auditorium
When Alfred Hitchcock
brought this movie out — an
adaptation of Arthur La Bern's
novel Goodbye Piccadilly,
Farewell Leicester Square, in a
script by Englsh playwright An
thony Shaffer — many of his
fans rejoiced, because it was so
much better than anything else
he'(J done for years;
Hi tchcockia ns everywhere
(prematurely) declared a ren
aissance. Seen from the discreet
distance of years, however, it's a
dried-out, faintly unpleasant
movie with one or two shocks
in it. The Hitchcock trademarks
— the mixture of wry humor
and suspense, the perverseness
and misanthropy — cling to it
like moldering icing on old
birthday cake. A distinguished
cast (jon Finch, Alec McCowen,
Barry Foster, Vivien Merchant,
Anna Massey) performs im
personally, though McCowen
has a few neat moments. A
good photographer, Gilbert
I avlor, shot the thing, but you'd
never guess it.
Plays tomorrow evening.

The Phantom of Liberty
(1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In Luis Bunuel's movies,
anecdotes peripheral to the
main action are often among
the highlights (like the night
mare the soldier relates in The
Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie) This off-the-cuff
comedy is .ill anecdotes. The
structure is a lateral movement
from one story to another sug
gested by a detail in the first;
the joke is that nothing comes
along — a character, a theme,
even a plot device — to tie all
the episodes together, except
that they all operate on the
print iple of surprise reversal.
Unfortunately, very tew of the
scenes are genuinelv funny.
(One about a missing child is
amusing, and there is one gem
in the collection, depicting a
society in which the bathroom
has become a highly public
chamber, while people eat,
slightly embarrassed, in j
private.) The impressive cast in- I
eludes Adriana Asti, Jean- 1
Claude Brialy, Adolfo Celi, ■
Michel Lonsdale, |uI ie n I
Bertheau, Michel Piccoli, Jean ■
Rochefort, Bernard Verley and I
Monica Vitti.
Plays Monday with The Dis- I
creel Char in of ihc I
Bourgeoisie.

The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie (1972) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Luis Bunuel whips up a wick
edly amusing comedy out of a
single joke: the characters keep
trying to eat a meal, and for
some reason they never can. It's
not much of a movie, but you'll
be amazed at how graceful it is.

The Deer Hunter (1979) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Michael Cimino's
astonishingly powerful (and ex
tremely controversial) movie
about the effects of a Vietnam
ese P.O.W camp on three bud
dies from a Pennsylvania steel
town gives off both left-wing
and right-wing vibrations. Polit
ic ally it's a mess, and it is fuelled
bv a particularly inscrutable
brand of machismo, but Cimino
and Dene Washburn (who col
laborated with him on the
script) make an honest attempt
to grapple with the Vietnam ex
penence. The film flounders
out of an understandable in
ability to assimilate a far too re
cent nightmare; it isn't a hard
sell (as many outraged critics
have claimed). As the survivor,
Michael, Robert De Niro gives a
supremely intelligent reading
of a tough, c losed-off role, but
the most memorable per
formances are by Christopher
Walken as his best friend and
Meryl Streep as the woman
they share. With John Savage
and the late John Cazale. Vil
mos Zsigmond's meticulous
cinematography helps to keep
vou intrested through the over
long opening stateside section.
Plays tonight with first Blood.
Dersu Uzala (1977) *
New Varsitv, Palo Alto
\kira Kurosawa filmed this
picture in Russia; it is about an
ama/ing old Mongolian who is
hired as scout for a carto
graphical expedition and his
friendship with the chief of that
expedition. Dersu lives in
perfect harmony with nature;
he teaches the Russians how to
reap her benefits without dis
turbing her balance. This is a
very unusual movie: sweet-na
tured and yet so grand visually
that it takes one's breath away.
Kurosawa and his photogra
pher make woods, snow and
even the embers of a campfire
so vivid that Dersu's insistence
that each is the embodiment of
an independent spirit actually
seems likely. Among a number
of great sequences is one that
might have been conceived by
Hans Christian Andersen:
Dersu saves himself and his new
comrade from the fury of a
snowstorm by building a shelter
out of brush, and as the two
men set to work with apparent
ly superhuman speed and con
struct something strong and
astonishingly beautiful out of
nothing, the task takes on a
magical aura.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Fitzcarraldo.

Not Mary Shelley, really, but
in its own way quite marvelous.
Universal's horror expert,
James Whale, directed, and he
certainly knew what he was
doing: though the style is early
talkie Hollywood Gothic (the
source of the Garrett Fort-Fran
cis Faragoh-John L. Balderston
script is actually a stage play by
Peggy Webling), the movie is
still effective half a century lat

complicated performance as
the monster is surprisingly
touching. With Colin Clive as
Frankenstein, Mae Clarke, John
Boles, Edward Van Sloan,
Frederick Kerr and Dwight

Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
Tuesday (Larkin).
One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest ★
Terman Auditorium
Ken Kesey's novel, one of the
signal books of the '60s, is the
tale of a renegade in a psy
chiatric hospital, told by anoth
er patient, a paranoid
schizophrenic; feverous and
eruptive, it would probably re
quire a director of Martin
Scorsese's caliber to translate it
to the screen faithfully — it's
certainly beyond the talents of
Mil os Forma n. But the
screenwriters, Lawrence
Hauben and Bo Goldman,
turned it into a more conven
tional, third-person narrative —
a first-rate one — and Forman
did a fine job with it. It's his best
sustained movie. Readers of the
novel pegged Jack Nicholson
for the role of McMurphy, the
rebel, even before Forman did,
but though he might have been
tempted to simply skate
through it, Nicholson gives an
unpredictable performance
that may be, along with The Last
Detail, his most impressive
work. The more unusual casting
coups are in the selection of
two relative unknowns, Louise
Fletcher and Brad Dourif, for
the roles of Nurse Ratched
(who must, in order for the
script to work, be considerably
more comprehensible than in
the book) and Billy Bibbitt;
both are superb.

(prematurely) declared a ren
aissance. Seen from the discreet
distance of years, however, it's a
dried-out, faintly unpleasant
movie with one or two shocks
in it. The Hitchcock trademarks
— the mixture of wry humor
and suspense, the perverseness
and misanthropy — cling to it
like moldering icing on old
birthday cake. A distinguished
cast (jon Finch, Alec McCowen,
Barry Foster, Vivien Merchant,
Anna Massey) performs im
personally, though McCowen
has a few neat moments. A

The Phantom of Liberty
(1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In Luis Bunuel's movies,
anecdotes peripheral to the
main action are often among
the highlights (like the night
mare the soldier relates in The
Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie) This off-the-cuff
comedy is .ill anecdotes. The
structure is a lateral movement
from one story to another sug
gested by a detail in the first;
the joke is that nothing comes
along — a character, a theme,
even a plot device — to tie all
the episodes together, except
that they all operate on the
print iple of surprise reversal.
Unfortunately, very tew of the
scenes are genuinelv funny.
(One about a missing child is
amusing, and there is one gem
in the collection, depicting a
society in which the bathroom
has become a highly public

Michael Cimino's
astonishingly powerful (and ex

about the effects of a Vietnam

brand of machismo, but Cimino
and Dene Washburn (who col

script) make an honest attempt
to grapple with the Vietnam ex

out of an understandable in
ability to assimilate a far too re
cent nightmare; it isn't a hard

have claimed). As the survivor,
Michael, Robert De Niro gives a
supremely intelligent reading

the most memorable per

perfect harmony with nature;
he teaches the Russians how to
reap her benefits without dis
turbing her balance. This is a
very unusual movie: sweet-na
tured and yet so grand visually
that it takes one's breath away.
Kurosawa and his photogra
pher make woods, snow and
even the embers of a campfire
so vivid that Dersu's insistence
that each is the embodiment of
an independent spirit actually
seems likely. Among a number
of great sequences is one that
might have been conceived by
Hans Christian Andersen:
Dersu saves himself and his new
comrade from the fury of a
snowstorm by building a shelter
out of brush, and as the two
men set to work with apparent

Frankenstein (1931) ★
Lagunita Dining Room; Larkin
West Lounge
Not Mary Shelley, really, but
in its own way quite marvelous.
Universal's horror expert,
James Whale, directed, and he
certainly knew what he was
doing: though the style is early
talkie Hollywood Gothic (the
source of the Garrett Fort-Fran
cis Faragoh-John L. Balderston
script is actually a stage play by
Peggy Webling), the movie is
still effective half a century lat
er. Boris Karloff's un
complicated performance as
the monster is surprisingly
touching. With Colin Clive as
Frankenstein, Mae Clarke, John
Boles, Edward Van Sloan,
Frederick Kerr and Dwight
Frye.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
Tuesday (Larkin).
One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest ★
Terman Auditorium
Ken Kesey's novel, one of the
signal books of the '60s, is the
tale of a renegade in a psy
chiatric hospital, told by anoth
er patient, a paranoid
schizophrenic; feverous and
eruptive, it would probably re
quire a director of Martin
Scorsese's caliber to translate it
to the screen faithfully — it's
certainly beyond the talents of
Mil os Forma n. But the
screenwriters, Lawrence
Hauben and Bo Goldman,
turned it into a more conven
tional, third-person narrative —
a first-rate one — and Forman
did a fine job with it. It's his best
sustained movie. Readers of the
novel pegged Jack Nicholson
for the role of McMurphy, the
rebel, even before Forman did,
but though he might have been
tempted to simply skate
through it, Nicholson gives an
unpredictable performance
that may be, along with The Last
Detail, his most impressive
work. The more unusual casting
coups are in the selection of
two relative unknowns, Louise
Fletcher and Brad Dourif, for
the roles of Nurse Ratched
(who must, in order for the
script to work, be considerably
more comprehensible than in
the book) and Billy Bibbitt;
both are superb.
Plays tomorrow evening.

Frenzy (1972)
Kresge Auditorium
When Alfred Hitchcock
brought this movie out — an
adaptation of Arthur La Bern's
novel Goodbye Piccadilly,
Farewell Leicester Square, in a
script by Englsh playwright An
thony Shaffer — many of his
fans rejoiced, because it was so
much better than anything else
he'(J done for years;
Hi tchcockia ns everywhere
(prematurely) declared a ren
aissance. Seen from the discreet
distance of years, however, it's a
dried-out, faintly unpleasant
movie with one or two shocks
in it. The Hitchcock trademarks
— the mixture of wry humor
and suspense, the perverseness
and misanthropy — cling to it
like moldering icing on old
birthday cake. A distinguished
cast (jon Finch, Alec McCowen,
Barry Foster, Vivien Merchant,
Anna Massey) performs im
personally, though McCowen
has a few neat moments. A
good photographer, Gilbert
I avlor, shot the thing, but you'd
never guess it.
Plays tomorrow evening.

The Phantom of Liberty
(1974)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In Luis Bunuel's movies,
anecdotes peripheral to the
main action are often among
the highlights (like the night
mare the soldier relates in The
Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie) This off-the-cuff
comedy is .ill anecdotes. The
structure is a lateral movement
from one story to another sug
gested by a detail in the first;
the joke is that nothing comes
along — a character, a theme,
even a plot device — to tie all
the episodes together, except
that they all operate on the
print iple of surprise reversal.
Unfortunately, very tew of the
scenes are genuinelv funny.
(One about a missing child is
amusing, and there is one gem
in the collection, depicting a
society in which the bathroom
has become a highly public
chamber, while people eat,
slightly embarrassed, in j
private.) The impressive cast in- I
eludes Adriana Asti, Jean- 1
Claude Brialy, Adolfo Celi, ■

Monica Vitti.

Luis Bunuel whips up a wick

The Deer Hunter (1979) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Michael Cimino's
astonishingly powerful (and ex
tremely controversial) movie
about the effects of a Vietnam
ese P.O.W camp on three bud
dies from a Pennsylvania steel
town gives off both left-wing
and right-wing vibrations. Polit
ic ally it's a mess, and it is fuelled
bv a particularly inscrutable
brand of machismo, but Cimino
and Dene Washburn (who col
laborated with him on the
script) make an honest attempt
to grapple with the Vietnam ex
penence. The film flounders
out of an understandable in
ability to assimilate a far too re
cent nightmare; it isn't a hard
sell (as many outraged critics
have claimed). As the survivor,
Michael, Robert De Niro gives a
supremely intelligent reading
of a tough, c losed-off role, but
the most memorable per
formances are by Christopher
Walken as his best friend and
Meryl Streep as the woman
they share. With John Savage
and the late John Cazale. Vil
mos Zsigmond's meticulous
cinematography helps to keep
vou intrested through the over
long opening stateside section.
Plays tonight with first Blood.
Dersu Uzala (1977) *
New Varsitv, Palo Alto
\kira Kurosawa filmed this
picture in Russia; it is about an
ama/ing old Mongolian who is
hired as scout for a carto
graphical expedition and his
friendship with the chief of that
expedition. Dersu lives in
perfect harmony with nature;
he teaches the Russians how to
reap her benefits without dis
turbing her balance. This is a
very unusual movie: sweet-na
tured and yet so grand visually
that it takes one's breath away.
Kurosawa and his photogra
pher make woods, snow and
even the embers of a campfire
so vivid that Dersu's insistence
that each is the embodiment of
an independent spirit actually
seems likely. Among a number
of great sequences is one that
might have been conceived by
Hans Christian Andersen:
Dersu saves himself and his new
comrade from the fury of a
snowstorm by building a shelter
out of brush, and as the two
men set to work with apparent
ly superhuman speed and con
struct something strong and
astonishingly beautiful out of
nothing, the task takes on a
magical aura.
