## From the bedroom to the bomb: an interview with Ehrlich 
### LEE ALTENBERG 
(Editors note: Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a major
environmental lobbyist, helped form the zero
population growth movement.)

Do you conceive that even all of the ter
restrial vertebrates could die?
Nobody knows for sure. One of the pos
sibilities is that there would be a couple of
months of total darkness and below freezing
temperatures over the entire globe. If the
timing were unlucky then most of the ter
restrial vertebrates could go extinct — but
some, like rats, would almost certainly sur
vive.
This is what Dr. Paul Ehrlich, professor of
biology, replied when I asked him about the
possible effects of an all-out thermonuclear
war. Ehrlich is involved now in setting up a
series of meetings of scientists across the
country to discuss the environmental effects
of nuclear war. His involvement with en
vironmental issues is nothing new. In 1968
he published The Population Bomb, which
gained nationwide attention and helped
form the zero population growth move
ment, and he has continued to be a major
figure in the environmental movement. In
his travels from Stockholm to Berkeley he
has been called everything from an instru
ment of imperialism to an ivory tower social
engineer. Here, Ehrlich does research on
butterfly and plant coevolution.
One of your colleagues said that you had
done something that no one in history has
ever been able to do, namely, to bring
awareness of the dangers of overpopulation
into the bedrooms of couples throughout
the country and change their reproductive
behavior. When you were a college
freshman, did you have any idea that you
might be influencing the population growth
of the developed world?
Well, I'm not sure that I have. I may have
had some small part in it. But yes, when I was
atreshman incollege I started readingbooks
and participating in bull-sessions on popula
tion issues. Anci my interest in it persisted.
But I didn't have any idea ofwhetherl'd ever
do anything about it, that was pure serendip
ity. I didn't stand up one day and say, "My
Cod, I'm going to get everybody to stop
procreating."
Why has the environment been such a
major concern of yours? Should I be /ust as
worried?
Of course the reason I'm worried about
the environment is that, like other
ecologists, I understand that the environ
ment is what supports our lives; if it goes
down the tubes, we go down the tubes with
it. If you understand how the world works,
you know that to ignore the environment is
to destroy the economic system. If you
don't, then you're in a class with Secretary of
the Interior lames Watt or President Reagan
and a danger to society.
But a number of students here, particularly
from ethnic minorities, have said to me they
felt that environmental problems were a lux
ury issue when seen against problems of so
cial justice.
Environmental issues are reallv much
more critical for people in minority groups,
because they're tne ones who are forced, for
instance, to live down wind of *he pov.er
plants while the rich wind up n 2 most of
the poyver. The poor'are the ones •*.
suffer first when food occu * ~ie'.
are, and will be, the major -ure'ers
environmental problems.
It is a standard mistake - o ** v en
vironmental activism as being eq j <alen* *o
just concern for trout streams it ; c;ear at
some "environmentalists' only *- '< as-ou
the environment in terms of cozv su"o „nd
ings for them and their hobbies. That's d-***
of it, but that's only a minor part. T ne basic
message of the environmental movement
must be: understand that the ecosvstems of
this planet support our lives, and under
stand that we are busily destroying them and
when we've completed the job we'll be gone
too.
Is it that people don't believe the envi
ronment is in danger? Or that they don't
care, or are unable to change what they're
doingt
I think the major part of the problem is ] ust
plain lack of education. It's clear that no
sensible person, once they understood the
problems, would ignore them. But there are
very few places in our society where you can
learn anything about the basics of environ
mental problems. It's an issue that's rela
tively new in out society. Ecology was a little
known technical field until about 15 years
ago. That's not much time if you want to
educate people from grade school through

college. We are in a society that is falling
behind in its mathematics and science edu
cation anyway. And there are powerful
forces that don't want environmental educa
tion, people who feel extremely threatened
by the ecological message.
How can they be eased out of this feeling
of threat?
I think that there is no way, in all probabil
ity, to convert a Ronald Reagan or a lames
Watt to a sensible position. Watt thinks the
world is going to end in a few years and
doesn't care what happens between now
and then, and considering the foreign policy
of his boss, he may be right. What you have
to do is start educating younger people and
remove dangerous people like that from po
sitions of influence.
What do we need, then, in the way of
education?
What we need is people who have the
tools to analyze problems as they arise, and
expose some of the idiocy in the world. In
stead of courses on "how lo save society,"
I d rather have students learn to be confi
dent with math and to read and write well, to
have some basic acquaintance with physics,
chemistry and biology, as well as history and
literature. An entire generation of
economists has been produced who don't
even understand the second law of ther
modynamics and the implications of that for
their discipline, and that's like having blind
pilots flying your airplane.

How would you illustrate the second law,
say, in an economic context?
The second law says, basically, that in any
real world process, some energy is degraded
to a less useful form. It also states that, in the
absence of inputs of high grade energy,
there will be an inexorable tendency for
concentrations of substances to disperse.
Economic systems need inputs of energy to
replace what was degraded, and concen
trated materials to replace what was dis
persed. Anybody who has had an economics
course with a standard textbook can see, by
simply 100 king at the circular diagram of the
generation of gross national product or
gross national income, that there are no
physical inputs into the system. It is a dia
gram of a perpetual motion machine, which
the second law says cannot work. So the
world view of many economists is funda
mentally flawed.
So what is needed, in a sense, is a change
r the belief of an educated person as to
.-.hat is important knowledge. The second
a a of thermodynamics is not seen today as
something everybody should know.
That's right. And ignorance of basic
physics led an economist, Julian Simon, to
a rite in Science magazine that the only limit
'o the amount of copper that can be made
available to humanity is the weight of the
universe.
I heard a veteran of some atomic tests
being interviewed on KGO radio, who was
saying how our country could survive an all
out nuclear war. People were calling up and
saying he was crazy, and his reply was,
"Well, you're entitled to your opinions and
I'm entitled to mine." How much do you
think people believe that. . . .
. . . everybody's opinion is just as good as
everybody else's? Much too much. One of
the funniest things that ever happened to
me at Stanford was one day, a colleague and
I were sitting in the coffee room, and a guy
came in and he said, "I hear you people are
concerned with the world food problem and
shortages of water." We said "yeh," and he
said, "I got a plan to solve the water problem
of the United States." I said "What is it?" and
he said, "We're gonna dig a canal to bring
the water from the Greenland ice cap to the
southwest." I said, "It's going to be an in
teresting exercise, because you're going to

have to dig that canal through the north At
lantic Ocean," and he said, "That's your
opinion, not mine." And that's typical. He
thinks that whether Greenland's an island or
not is just a matter of opinion. This
economist Simon has the opinion you can
make copper in economic quantities out of
other metals. Well that's his opinion. The
point is, unfortunately, everybody's opinion
isn't as good as everybody else's.
What would you say are the "biggies" in
environmental problems?
Population is the most fundamental one.
We're only managing to support 4.fa billion
people by doing tnings that no sensible fam
ily would ever do in tneir personal finances:
we're living on our capital, we're using up a
one time bonanza of fossil fuels, other
highly concentrated minerals, fertile soils,
and biological riches — as many as 30 million
species by the most recent measure, and
billions of natural populations. It's a one
time bonanza, and when it's gone, humanity
will have to fall back on renewable re
sources. But the systems that supply us with
renewable resources depend largely on
those 30 million plant and animal species.
With the destruction of natural habitats, the
chain-sawing of the world's tropical rain
forests, half or more of these may disappear
in the next 50 years. We are loosing our
ability to live on income by reducing capital
in our attempts to maintain a high level of
overpopulation.
Acid rains are absolutely critical, and in
volved in the loss of diversity. It's causing
international incidents with Canada already.
We now have lost the fishes and much of the
rest of the aquatic biota of many lakes in the
northeastern parts of North America, in
Sweden, in Norway. Some biologists believe
acid rains in Europe are changing the soils so
that the forests of Europe are already
doomed — that there is no way to fix the soil
back up so that the forests can survive.
Development in general is, of course, an
enormous problem. We need to preserve
natural ecological systems that supply soci
ety with vital services. We've disturbed more
than enough of the planet. Ideally, not one
more square inch of the United States
should be developed, and not one more
acre of tropical rain forest should be cut
down. The rain forests help control our cli
mate. If they are largely destroyed, North
5 America may no longer be able to grow
5 surplus grain, and that alone could risk the
lives of hundreds of millions of people.
£
£ Is it economic systems that are leading to
3= this behavior?
o All industrial economic systems promote
- the wrong kind of behavior, be they com
munist, socialist or capitalist, because
they're all basically steel eating, radical sys
tems rather than conservative systems.
None of today's systems emphasize quality
of capital; they emphasize speed of
throughput. Both capitalist and communist
systems turn natural resources into rubbish
as fast as they can.
Where I grew up there were orange groves
and bean fields which are now covered by
tract houses. What do you do when there are
economic incentives to build them?
The economic system is shoving us con
tinually towards doom. Most economists
and businessmen think it's perfectly all right
to cover farmland with houses. Simon
explicitly states that you can always tear the
houses back off, and the soil will still be
there. Apparently, he doesn't know what
soil is.
Then what can we do when there is a
pressure for more housing?
What we should do is tear down a slum
area, put up more decent high rise apart
ments, and find social devices that will per
mit the people who previously lived in the
slum to afford the new housing. You could
tear down the plastic motels that are now
decaying along the highways of the South
eastern United States and put housing there.
We need redesign and redevelopment —
not the creation of more sprawl and more
"slums of tomorrow."
Then what do you say to the farmer and the
developer who want to make a deal?
You tell them they can't. You simply forbid
development. That's what governments are
for, to do the things corporately that people
will not do individually. One of the things
that we all want to do is eat, and if we allow
developers to get rich by developing farm
land, sooner or later no one, including the
developers, will be able to eat. And that's a
fact of nature. We don't put a tax on murder.
We don't say, if you murder somebody,
you're taxed a hundred thousand dollars, we
simply say "you can't do it." In a sense, con
verting farm land to ticky-tacky subdivisions
is killing people in the future. And so you
simply say, "you can't do it."
There is something of a new school in his
torical thought that is attributing the decline
of a number of ancient civilizations in large

measure to their destruction of their natural
environment.
That's right. No question that it was a fac
tor in a lot of them, including the ancient
Mayan, the Khmer, and the original Tigris
and Euphrates civilizations. If you've been to
the Mediterranean Basin, it's a goatscape,
and the destruction of their forests and the
looting of their natural resources make it
very unlikely that a major power will ever
appear there again.
When did this occur?
Over a long period going all the way back
to the Egyptians. There is a controversial
book by Donald Hughes that outlines many
of the arguments.
What could Stanford students do tomor
row that would make you most happy and
hopeful?
Get organized full scale to beat Ronald (
Reagan in the next election. Don't wait until
a couple months before the election of 1984.
There are all sorts of issues, but when you've
got a government that is absolutely dedi
cated to the destruction of environment,
and to fooling around with nuclear war, then
all the rest of it must take a back seat. This is
the leverage point right now, much better
than eating less beet or driving a less gas
consumptive car.
The thing that's such a shame is that so
much progress was made with the estab
lishment of the EPA, and with the National
Environmental Protection Act, and the Clean
Air Acts; environmental concerns were in
stitutionalized. The USA was moving in the
right direction on population growth and
giving people control of their reproduction.
Now we have an administration that's trying
to turn back the clock. And so rather than
worry about the relatively parochial con
cerns, we've got to elect a government that
is at least not outright dedicated to the de
struction of the country for fast profits. And I
would hope that Earth Day ana Earth Week
this year would be thought of as the launch
ing of a political campaign to rid us of the
worst problem this nation has ever faced.
The people in the Reagan administration
see themselves as doing the exact opposite,
don't they?
Oh I'm sure they do. Nobody sees them
selves as a bunch of greedy, ignorant fools. I
am certain that inside their heads, they have
nothing but the best of motives. Who ever
tries to destroy the world saying "I'm evil
and I'm going to destroy the world?" They all
think they're doing good. Ronald Reagan is
probably a very nice fellow. That doesn't
make any difference; what he is doing is evil.

I'm thinking of World War 11. It was an
example of wnat America can do when the
task is clear. You make it sound as if this is a
much more dangerous time in our history,
and yet it is as if we couldn't agree on
whether lapan had bombed us or not, or
whether Germany really existed.
That's a good analogy. The trouble with
the population, resource, and environmen
tal crisis, is that has developed relatively
slowly. And human beings aid not evolve
the cultural capacity to deal with crises that
appear gradually, because over the millions
of years of our history, most environmental
changes were slow enough that we could
adapt genetically. Human nervous systems
tere good at responding to sudden crises,
like a cave bear appearing back at the door of
the cave, but they are not good at respond
ing to things like climatic change or the
problems caused by gradual changes in
technology. When gradual crises do occur,
they tend to cause considerable disloca
tions, as the agricultural revolution did.
In the past, humanity did not have the
power to destroy the entire world in the
course of a cultural or historical convulsion.
In the past when these convulsions have oc-
individual societies have broken
down, there have been collossal wars, and
so on. But these have been localized. For the
first time now, the entire species has basic
ally a single global culture and economy,
and it's being screwed up. So when this one

collapses, the results are going to be enor
mously more catastrophic than those of past
collapses.
You've got to remember, I lived through
the Second World War, and it was a horrify
ing thing, but it's absolute peanuts com
pared to what a nuclear war would be. The
only debate I know scientists study
ing the effects of an all-out nuclear war is
"would there be any significant survivorship
in the Southern Hemisphere?" At the mo
ment no knowledgeable person questions
that civilization in the Northern Hemisphere
would be destroyed.

Environmental issues are
really much more critical for
people in minority groups,
because they're the ones who
are forced, for instance, to
live down wind of the power
plants while the rich wind up
getting most of the power.

You and others have warned us about
what population growth, environmental de
struction and nuclear weapons portend. I'm
thinking of World War II again. There were
lews in Northern Europe who eventually
died in concentration camps who had been
warned about what was going to happen to
them, but they risked that the warnings were
untrue rather than disrupt their lives in trying
to escape. How much have you disrupted
your life to deal with what you see?
To the extent of putting about half of my
time into this sort of policy issue when my
real interest is doing biological research. For
example, this year I've put a great deal of
time into studying the effects of thermonuc
lear war on ecosystems. That's about as in
teresting to a biologist as studying the ef
fects of putting a double barreled shotgun in
your mouth and pulling the trigger would be
to a physician. It is an issue of almost zero
interest for basic ecology, and yet it turns
out to be something from an educational
point of view that we've got to do.
I have disrupted my life by having one
child when I might have preferred more. But
I have not moved to New Zealand or Au
stralia because I don't think it would do any
good. But I would if I did. Everybody ought
to tithe to society — put 10 percent of their
time into trying to improve it. This year their
tithe should go into frying to prevent nuclear
war, because any other social issue that
you're concerned with becomes moot if we
blow up the Northern Hemisphere.
An ecologist, Aldo Leopold, said that to
"receive an ecological education is to live
alone in a world of wounds." How much
does the picture of the world that you see get
to you?
Well, first of all, I don't have to live alone
in a world of wounds because I've got 20 or
so colleagues here in the population biology
group who, to a very large degree, share my
perception of it. But it still — it doesn't
bother me continuously, I can shut it out —
but it is disturbing to realize that I have seen
an enormous deterioration of the planet in
my lifetime, and that my daughter and
people of your generation are inheriting a
very badly messed up and increasingly
dangerous planet, and that's very very sad.
But, I don't run around in a constant depres
sion. As long as there is wine and women
and an occasional song, you can live with it.
Besides these, along what avenues can we
gather up hope for the future of human ex
perience?
Well I think there is enormous potential
for turning things around. Most demog
raphers thought 15 years ago that it was im
possible to get the reproductive rate in the
U.S. to replacement level until aftertheyear
2000; it happened in the early 19705. There's
no reason at all why the economic system
couldn't be turned around extremely
rapidly, or why we couldn't change the ways
we treat each other — getting ria of racism,
and other forms of chauvinism — and get
together and solve these problems. The
challenge that faces humanity today is a very
interesting one; we are either going to
change our behavior or we're going to go
down the tubes. And the people who are
raving on about how many more people we
can have, and how we can make copper out
of other metals, and so on, are simply say
ing, "don't change your ways, go down the
tubes," and if nothing else, it's interesting.
But it is at least conceivable that we could
finally make the changes that need to be
made in the way we deal with our environ
ment, and in the way we deal with one
another. It's not very likely. In summary, I
am extremely optimistic about what we
could do, I am extremely pessimistic about
what we will do.
Dr. Ehrlich will be speaking in Kresge Au
ditorium, 7:30 p.m., April 7, on "Thoughts
for the design of a sane world."

natural ecological systems that supply soci
ety with vital services. We've disturbed more
than enough of the planet. Ideally, not one
more square inch of the United States
should be developed, and not one more
acre of tropical rain forest should be cut
down. The rain forests help control our cli
mate. If they are largely destroyed, North
5 America may no longer be able to grow
5 surplus grain, and that alone could risk the
lives of hundreds of millions of people.

£ Is it economic systems that are leading to
3= this behavior?
o All industrial economic systems promote
- the wrong kind of behavior, be they com
munist, socialist or capitalist, because
they're all basically steel eating, radical sys
tems rather than conservative systems.
None of today's systems emphasize quality
of capital; they emphasize speed of
throughput. Both capitalist and communist
systems turn natural resources into rubbish
as fast as they can.
Where I grew up there were orange groves
and bean fields which are now covered by
tract houses. What do you do when there are
economic incentives to build them?
The economic system is shoving us con
tinually towards doom. Most economists
and businessmen think it's perfectly all right
to cover farmland with houses. Simon
explicitly states that you can always tear the
houses back off, and the soil will still be
there. Apparently, he doesn't know what
soil is.
Then what can we do when there is a
pressure for more housing?
What we should do is tear down a slum
area, put up more decent high rise apart
ments, and find social devices that will per
mit the people who previously lived in the
slum to afford the new housing. You could
tear down the plastic motels that are now
decaying along the highways of the South
eastern United States and put housing there.
We need redesign and redevelopment —
not the creation of more sprawl and more
"slums of tomorrow."
Then what do you say to the farmer and the
developer who want to make a deal?
You tell them they can't. You simply forbid
development. That's what governments are
for, to do the things corporately that people
will not do individually. One of the things
that we all want to do is eat, and if we allow
developers to get rich by developing farm
land, sooner or later no one, including the
developers, will be able to eat. And that's a
fact of nature. We don't put a tax on murder.
We don't say, if you murder somebody,
you're taxed a hundred thousand dollars, we
simply say "you can't do it." In a sense, con
verting farm land to ticky-tacky subdivisions
is killing people in the future. And so you
simply say, "you can't do it."
There is something of a new school in his
torical thought that is attributing the decline
of a number of ancient civilizations in large

measure to their destruction of their natural
environment.
That's right. No question that it was a fac
tor in a lot of them, including the ancient
Mayan, the Khmer, and the original Tigris
and Euphrates civilizations. If you've been to
the Mediterranean Basin, it's a goatscape,
and the destruction of their forests and the
looting of their natural resources make it
very unlikely that a major power will ever
appear there again.
When did this occur?
Over a long period going all the way back
to the Egyptians. There is a controversial
book by Donald Hughes that outlines many
of the arguments.
What could Stanford students do tomor
row that would make you most happy and
hopeful?
Get organized full scale to beat Ronald (
Reagan in the next election. Don't wait until
a couple months before the election of 1984.
There are all sorts of issues, but when you've
got a government that is absolutely dedi
cated to the destruction of environment,
and to fooling around with nuclear war, then
all the rest of it must take a back seat. This is
the leverage point right now, much better
than eating less beet or driving a less gas
consumptive car.
The thing that's such a shame is that so
much progress was made with the estab
lishment of the EPA, and with the National
Environmental Protection Act, and the Clean
Air Acts; environmental concerns were in
stitutionalized. The USA was moving in the
right direction on population growth and
giving people control of their reproduction.
Now we have an administration that's trying
to turn back the clock. And so rather than
worry about the relatively parochial con
cerns, we've got to elect a government that
is at least not outright dedicated to the de
struction of the country for fast profits. And I
would hope that Earth Day ana Earth Week
this year would be thought of as the launch
ing of a political campaign to rid us of the
worst problem this nation has ever faced.
The people in the Reagan administration
see themselves as doing the exact opposite,
don't they?
Oh I'm sure they do. Nobody sees them
selves as a bunch of greedy, ignorant fools. I
am certain that inside their heads, they have
nothing but the best of motives. Who ever
tries to destroy the world saying "I'm evil
and I'm going to destroy the world?" They all
think they're doing good. Ronald Reagan is
probably a very nice fellow. That doesn't
make any difference; what he is doing is evil.

I'm thinking of World War 11. It was an
example of wnat America can do when the
task is clear. You make it sound as if this is a
much more dangerous time in our history,
and yet it is as if we couldn't agree on
whether lapan had bombed us or not, or
whether Germany really existed.
That's a good analogy. The trouble with
the population, resource, and environmen
tal crisis, is that has developed relatively
slowly. And human beings aid not evolve
the cultural capacity to deal with crises that
appear gradually, because over the millions
of years of our history, most environmental
changes were slow enough that we could
adapt genetically. Human nervous systems
tere good at responding to sudden crises,
like a cave bear appearing back at the door of
the cave, but they are not good at respond
ing to things like climatic change or the
problems caused by gradual changes in
technology. When gradual crises do occur,
they tend to cause considerable disloca
tions, as the agricultural revolution did.
In the past, humanity did not have the
power to destroy the entire world in the
course of a cultural or historical convulsion.
In the past when these convulsions have oc-
individual societies have broken
down, there have been collossal wars, and
so on. But these have been localized. For the
first time now, the entire species has basic
ally a single global culture and economy,
and it's being screwed up. So when this one

collapses, the results are going to be enor
mously more catastrophic than those of past
collapses.
You've got to remember, I lived through
the Second World War, and it was a horrify
ing thing, but it's absolute peanuts com
pared to what a nuclear war would be. The
only debate I know scientists study
ing the effects of an all-out nuclear war is
"would there be any significant survivorship
in the Southern Hemisphere?" At the mo
ment no knowledgeable person questions
that civilization in the Northern Hemisphere
would be destroyed.

Environmental issues are
really much more critical for
people in minority groups,
because they're the ones who
are forced, for instance, to
live down wind of the power
plants while the rich wind up
getting most of the power.

You and others have warned us about
what population growth, environmental de
struction and nuclear weapons portend. I'm
thinking of World War II again. There were
lews in Northern Europe who eventually
died in concentration camps who had been
warned about what was going to happen to
them, but they risked that the warnings were
untrue rather than disrupt their lives in trying
to escape. How much have you disrupted
your life to deal with what you see?
To the extent of putting about half of my
time into this sort of policy issue when my
real interest is doing biological research. For
example, this year I've put a great deal of
time into studying the effects of thermonuc
lear war on ecosystems. That's about as in
teresting to a biologist as studying the ef
fects of putting a double barreled shotgun in
your mouth and pulling the trigger would be
to a physician. It is an issue of almost zero
interest for basic ecology, and yet it turns
out to be something from an educational
point of view that we've got to do.
I have disrupted my life by having one
child when I might have preferred more. But
I have not moved to New Zealand or Au
stralia because I don't think it would do any
good. But I would if I did. Everybody ought
to tithe to society — put 10 percent of their
time into trying to improve it. This year their
tithe should go into frying to prevent nuclear
war, because any other social issue that
you're concerned with becomes moot if we
blow up the Northern Hemisphere.
An ecologist, Aldo Leopold, said that to
"receive an ecological education is to live
alone in a world of wounds." How much
does the picture of the world that you see get
to you?
Well, first of all, I don't have to live alone
in a world of wounds because I've got 20 or
so colleagues here in the population biology
group who, to a very large degree, share my
perception of it. But it still — it doesn't
bother me continuously, I can shut it out —
but it is disturbing to realize that I have seen
an enormous deterioration of the planet in
my lifetime, and that my daughter and
people of your generation are inheriting a
very badly messed up and increasingly
dangerous planet, and that's very very sad.
But, I don't run around in a constant depres
sion. As long as there is wine and women
and an occasional song, you can live with it.
Besides these, along what avenues can we
gather up hope for the future of human ex
perience?
Well I think there is enormous potential
for turning things around. Most demog
raphers thought 15 years ago that it was im
possible to get the reproductive rate in the
U.S. to replacement level until aftertheyear
2000; it happened in the early 19705. There's
no reason at all why the economic system
couldn't be turned around extremely
rapidly, or why we couldn't change the ways
we treat each other — getting ria of racism,
and other forms of chauvinism — and get
together and solve these problems. The
challenge that faces humanity today is a very
interesting one; we are either going to
change our behavior or we're going to go
down the tubes. And the people who are
raving on about how many more people we
can have, and how we can make copper out
of other metals, and so on, are simply say
ing, "don't change your ways, go down the
tubes," and if nothing else, it's interesting.
But it is at least conceivable that we could
finally make the changes that need to be
made in the way we deal with our environ
ment, and in the way we deal with one
another. It's not very likely. In summary, I
am extremely optimistic about what we
could do, I am extremely pessimistic about
what we will do.
Dr. Ehrlich will be speaking in Kresge Au
ditorium, 7:30 p.m., April 7, on "Thoughts
for the design of a sane world."


(Editors note: Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a major
environmental lobbyist, helped form the zero
population growth movement.)

Do you conceive that even all of the ter
restrial vertebrates could die?
Nobody knows for sure. One of the pos
sibilities is that there would be a couple of
months of total darkness and below freezing
temperatures over the entire globe. If the
timing were unlucky then most of the ter
restrial vertebrates could go extinct — but
some, like rats, would almost certainly sur
vive.
This is what Dr. Paul Ehrlich, professor of
biology, replied when I asked him about the
possible effects of an all-out thermonuclear
war. Ehrlich is involved now in setting up a
series of meetings of scientists across the
country to discuss the environmental effects
of nuclear war. His involvement with en
vironmental issues is nothing new. In 1968
he published The Population Bomb, which
gained nationwide attention and helped
form the zero population growth move
ment, and he has continued to be a major
figure in the environmental movement. In
his travels from Stockholm to Berkeley he
has been called everything from an instru
ment of imperialism to an ivory tower social
engineer. Here, Ehrlich does research on
butterfly and plant coevolution.
One of your colleagues said that you had
done something that no one in history has
ever been able to do, namely, to bring
awareness of the dangers of overpopulation
into the bedrooms of couples throughout
the country and change their reproductive
behavior. When you were a college
freshman, did you have any idea that you
might be influencing the population growth
of the developed world?
Well, I'm not sure that I have. I may have
had some small part in it. But yes, when I was
atreshman incollege I started readingbooks
and participating in bull-sessions on popula
tion issues. Anci my interest in it persisted.
But I didn't have any idea ofwhetherl'd ever
do anything about it, that was pure serendip
ity. I didn't stand up one day and say, "My
Cod, I'm going to get everybody to stop
procreating."
Why has the environment been such a
major concern of yours? Should I be /ust as
worried?
Of course the reason I'm worried about
the environment is that, like other
ecologists, I understand that the environ
ment is what supports our lives; if it goes
down the tubes, we go down the tubes with
it. If you understand how the world works,
you know that to ignore the environment is
to destroy the economic system. If you
don't, then you're in a class with Secretary of
the Interior lames Watt or President Reagan
and a danger to society.
But a number of students here, particularly
from ethnic minorities, have said to me they
felt that environmental problems were a lux
ury issue when seen against problems of so
cial justice.
Environmental issues are reallv much
more critical for people in minority groups,
because they're tne ones who are forced, for
instance, to live down wind of *he pov.er
plants while the rich wind up n 2 most of
the poyver. The poor'are the ones •*.
suffer first when food occu * ~ie'.
are, and will be, the major -ure'ers
environmental problems.
It is a standard mistake - o ** v en
vironmental activism as being eq j <alen* *o
just concern for trout streams it ; c;ear at
some "environmentalists' only *- '< as-ou
the environment in terms of cozv su"o „nd
ings for them and their hobbies. That's d-***
of it, but that's only a minor part. T ne basic
message of the environmental movement
must be: understand that the ecosvstems of
this planet support our lives, and under
stand that we are busily destroying them and
when we've completed the job we'll be gone
too.
Is it that people don't believe the envi
ronment is in danger? Or that they don't
care, or are unable to change what they're
doingt
I think the major part of the problem is ] ust
plain lack of education. It's clear that no
sensible person, once they understood the
problems, would ignore them. But there are
very few places in our society where you can
learn anything about the basics of environ
mental problems. It's an issue that's rela
tively new in out society. Ecology was a little
known technical field until about 15 years
ago. That's not much time if you want to
educate people from grade school through

college. We are in a society that is falling
behind in its mathematics and science edu
cation anyway. And there are powerful
forces that don't want environmental educa
tion, people who feel extremely threatened
by the ecological message.
How can they be eased out of this feeling
of threat?
I think that there is no way, in all probabil
ity, to convert a Ronald Reagan or a lames
Watt to a sensible position. Watt thinks the
world is going to end in a few years and
doesn't care what happens between now
and then, and considering the foreign policy
of his boss, he may be right. What you have
to do is start educating younger people and
remove dangerous people like that from po
sitions of influence.
What do we need, then, in the way of
education?
What we need is people who have the
tools to analyze problems as they arise, and
expose some of the idiocy in the world. In
stead of courses on "how lo save society,"
I d rather have students learn to be confi
dent with math and to read and write well, to
have some basic acquaintance with physics,
chemistry and biology, as well as history and
literature. An entire generation of
economists has been produced who don't
even understand the second law of ther
modynamics and the implications of that for
their discipline, and that's like having blind
pilots flying your airplane.

How would you illustrate the second law,
say, in an economic context?
The second law says, basically, that in any
real world process, some energy is degraded
to a less useful form. It also states that, in the
absence of inputs of high grade energy,
there will be an inexorable tendency for
concentrations of substances to disperse.
Economic systems need inputs of energy to
replace what was degraded, and concen
trated materials to replace what was dis
persed. Anybody who has had an economics
course with a standard textbook can see, by
simply 100 king at the circular diagram of the
generation of gross national product or
gross national income, that there are no
physical inputs into the system. It is a dia
gram of a perpetual motion machine, which
the second law says cannot work. So the
world view of many economists is funda
mentally flawed.
So what is needed, in a sense, is a change
r the belief of an educated person as to
.-.hat is important knowledge. The second
a a of thermodynamics is not seen today as
something everybody should know.
That's right. And ignorance of basic
physics led an economist, Julian Simon, to
a rite in Science magazine that the only limit
'o the amount of copper that can be made
available to humanity is the weight of the
universe.
I heard a veteran of some atomic tests
being interviewed on KGO radio, who was
saying how our country could survive an all
out nuclear war. People were calling up and
saying he was crazy, and his reply was,
"Well, you're entitled to your opinions and
I'm entitled to mine." How much do you
think people believe that. . . .
. . . everybody's opinion is just as good as
everybody else's? Much too much. One of
the funniest things that ever happened to
me at Stanford was one day, a colleague and
I were sitting in the coffee room, and a guy
came in and he said, "I hear you people are
concerned with the world food problem and
shortages of water." We said "yeh," and he
said, "I got a plan to solve the water problem
of the United States." I said "What is it?" and
he said, "We're gonna dig a canal to bring
the water from the Greenland ice cap to the
southwest." I said, "It's going to be an in
teresting exercise, because you're going to

have to dig that canal through the north At
lantic Ocean," and he said, "That's your
opinion, not mine." And that's typical. He
thinks that whether Greenland's an island or
not is just a matter of opinion. This
economist Simon has the opinion you can
make copper in economic quantities out of
other metals. Well that's his opinion. The
point is, unfortunately, everybody's opinion
isn't as good as everybody else's.
What would you say are the "biggies" in
environmental problems?
Population is the most fundamental one.
We're only managing to support 4.fa billion
people by doing tnings that no sensible fam
ily would ever do in tneir personal finances:
we're living on our capital, we're using up a
one time bonanza of fossil fuels, other
highly concentrated minerals, fertile soils,
and biological riches — as many as 30 million
species by the most recent measure, and
billions of natural populations. It's a one
time bonanza, and when it's gone, humanity
will have to fall back on renewable re
sources. But the systems that supply us with
renewable resources depend largely on
those 30 million plant and animal species.
With the destruction of natural habitats, the
chain-sawing of the world's tropical rain
forests, half or more of these may disappear
in the next 50 years. We are loosing our
ability to live on income by reducing capital
in our attempts to maintain a high level of
overpopulation.
Acid rains are absolutely critical, and in
volved in the loss of diversity. It's causing
international incidents with Canada already.
We now have lost the fishes and much of the
rest of the aquatic biota of many lakes in the
northeastern parts of North America, in
Sweden, in Norway. Some biologists believe
acid rains in Europe are changing the soils so
that the forests of Europe are already
doomed — that there is no way to fix the soil
back up so that the forests can survive.
Development in general is, of course, an
enormous problem. We need to preserve
natural ecological systems that supply soci
ety with vital services. We've disturbed more
than enough of the planet. Ideally, not one
more square inch of the United States
should be developed, and not one more
acre of tropical rain forest should be cut
down. The rain forests help control our cli
mate. If they are largely destroyed, North
5 America may no longer be able to grow
5 surplus grain, and that alone could risk the
lives of hundreds of millions of people.

2000; it happened in the early 19705. There's
no reason at all why the economic system
couldn't be turned around extremely
rapidly, or why we couldn't change the ways
we treat each other — getting ria of racism,
and other forms of chauvinism — and get
together and solve these problems. The
challenge that faces humanity today is a very
interesting one; we are either going to
change our behavior or we're going to go
down the tubes. And the people who are
raving on about how many more people we
can have, and how we can make copper out
of other metals, and so on, are simply say
ing, "don't change your ways, go down the
tubes," and if nothing else, it's interesting.
But it is at least conceivable that we could
finally make the changes that need to be
made in the way we deal with our environ
ment, and in the way we deal with one
another. It's not very likely. In summary, I
am extremely optimistic about what we
could do, I am extremely pessimistic about
what we will do.
Dr. Ehrlich will be speaking in Kresge Au
ditorium, 7:30 p.m., April 7, on "Thoughts
for the design of a sane world."


(Editors note: Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a major
environmental lobbyist, helped form the zero
population growth movement.)

Do you conceive that even all of the ter
restrial vertebrates could die?
Nobody knows for sure. One of the pos
sibilities is that there would be a couple of
months of total darkness and below freezing
temperatures over the entire globe. If the
timing were unlucky then most of the ter
restrial vertebrates could go extinct — but
some, like rats, would almost certainly sur
vive.
This is what Dr. Paul Ehrlich, professor of
biology, replied when I asked him about the
possible effects of an all-out thermonuclear
war. Ehrlich is involved now in setting up a
series of meetings of scientists across the
country to discuss the environmental effects
of nuclear war. His involvement with en
vironmental issues is nothing new. In 1968
he published The Population Bomb, which
gained nationwide attention and helped
form the zero population growth move
ment, and he has continued to be a major
figure in the environmental movement. In
his travels from Stockholm to Berkeley he
has been called everything from an instru
ment of imperialism to an ivory tower social
engineer. Here, Ehrlich does research on
butterfly and plant coevolution.
One of your colleagues said that you had
done something that no one in history has
ever been able to do, namely, to bring
awareness of the dangers of overpopulation
into the bedrooms of couples throughout
the country and change their reproductive
behavior. When you were a college
freshman, did you have any idea that you
might be influencing the population growth
of the developed world?
Well, I'm not sure that I have. I may have
had some small part in it. But yes, when I was
atreshman incollege I started readingbooks
and participating in bull-sessions on popula
tion issues. Anci my interest in it persisted.
But I didn't have any idea ofwhetherl'd ever
do anything about it, that was pure serendip
ity. I didn't stand up one day and say, "My
Cod, I'm going to get everybody to stop
procreating."
Why has the environment been such a
major concern of yours? Should I be /ust as
worried?
Of course the reason I'm worried about
the environment is that, like other
ecologists, I understand that the environ
ment is what supports our lives; if it goes
down the tubes, we go down the tubes with
it. If you understand how the world works,
you know that to ignore the environment is
to destroy the economic system. If you
don't, then you're in a class with Secretary of
the Interior lames Watt or President Reagan
and a danger to society.
But a number of students here, particularly
from ethnic minorities, have said to me they
felt that environmental problems were a lux
ury issue when seen against problems of so
cial justice.
Environmental issues are reallv much
more critical for people in minority groups,
because they're tne ones who are forced, for
instance, to live down wind of *he pov.er
plants while the rich wind up n 2 most of
the poyver. The poor'are the ones •*.
suffer first when food occu * ~ie'.
are, and will be, the major -ure'ers
environmental problems.
It is a standard mistake - o ** v en
vironmental activism as being eq j <alen* *o
just concern for trout streams it ; c;ear at
some "environmentalists' only *- '< as-ou
the environment in terms of cozv su"o „nd
ings for them and their hobbies. That's d-***
of it, but that's only a minor part. T ne basic
message of the environmental movement
must be: understand that the ecosvstems of
this planet support our lives, and under
stand that we are busily destroying them and
when we've completed the job we'll be gone
too.
Is it that people don't believe the envi
ronment is in danger? Or that they don't
care, or are unable to change what they're
doingt
I think the major part of the problem is ] ust
plain lack of education. It's clear that no
sensible person, once they understood the
problems, would ignore them. But there are
very few places in our society where you can
learn anything about the basics of environ
mental problems. It's an issue that's rela
tively new in out society. Ecology was a little
known technical field until about 15 years
ago. That's not much time if you want to
educate people from grade school through

college. We are in a society that is falling
behind in its mathematics and science edu
cation anyway. And there are powerful
forces that don't want environmental educa
tion, people who feel extremely threatened
by the ecological message.
How can they be eased out of this feeling
of threat?
I think that there is no way, in all probabil
ity, to convert a Ronald Reagan or a lames
Watt to a sensible position. Watt thinks the
world is going to end in a few years and
doesn't care what happens between now
and then, and considering the foreign policy
of his boss, he may be right. What you have
to do is start educating younger people and
remove dangerous people like that from po
sitions of influence.
What do we need, then, in the way of
education?
What we need is people who have the
tools to analyze problems as they arise, and
expose some of the idiocy in the world. In
stead of courses on "how lo save society,"
I d rather have students learn to be confi
dent with math and to read and write well, to
have some basic acquaintance with physics,
chemistry and biology, as well as history and
literature. An entire generation of
economists has been produced who don't
even understand the second law of ther
modynamics and the implications of that for
their discipline, and that's like having blind
pilots flying your airplane.

How would you illustrate the second law,
say, in an economic context?
The second law says, basically, that in any
real world process, some energy is degraded
to a less useful form. It also states that, in the
absence of inputs of high grade energy,
there will be an inexorable tendency for
concentrations of substances to disperse.
Economic systems need inputs of energy to
replace what was degraded, and concen
trated materials to replace what was dis
persed. Anybody who has had an economics
course with a standard textbook can see, by
simply 100 king at the circular diagram of the
generation of gross national product or
gross national income, that there are no
physical inputs into the system. It is a dia
gram of a perpetual motion machine, which
the second law says cannot work. So the
world view of many economists is funda
mentally flawed.
So what is needed, in a sense, is a change
r the belief of an educated person as to
.-.hat is important knowledge. The second
a a of thermodynamics is not seen today as
something everybody should know.
That's right. And ignorance of basic
physics led an economist, Julian Simon, to
a rite in Science magazine that the only limit
'o the amount of copper that can be made
available to humanity is the weight of the
universe.
I heard a veteran of some atomic tests
being interviewed on KGO radio, who was
saying how our country could survive an all
out nuclear war. People were calling up and
saying he was crazy, and his reply was,
"Well, you're entitled to your opinions and
I'm entitled to mine." How much do you
think people believe that. . . .
. . . everybody's opinion is just as good as
everybody else's? Much too much. One of
the funniest things that ever happened to
me at Stanford was one day, a colleague and
I were sitting in the coffee room, and a guy
came in and he said, "I hear you people are
concerned with the world food problem and
shortages of water." We said "yeh," and he
said, "I got a plan to solve the water problem
of the United States." I said "What is it?" and
he said, "We're gonna dig a canal to bring
the water from the Greenland ice cap to the
southwest." I said, "It's going to be an in
teresting exercise, because you're going to

have to dig that canal through the north At
lantic Ocean," and he said, "That's your
opinion, not mine." And that's typical. He
thinks that whether Greenland's an island or
not is just a matter of opinion. This
economist Simon has the opinion you can
make copper in economic quantities out of
other metals. Well that's his opinion. The
point is, unfortunately, everybody's opinion
isn't as good as everybody else's.
What would you say are the "biggies" in
environmental problems?
Population is the most fundamental one.
We're only managing to support 4.fa billion
people by doing tnings that no sensible fam
ily would ever do in tneir personal finances:
we're living on our capital, we're using up a
one time bonanza of fossil fuels, other
highly concentrated minerals, fertile soils,
and biological riches — as many as 30 million
species by the most recent measure, and
billions of natural populations. It's a one
time bonanza, and when it's gone, humanity
will have to fall back on renewable re
sources. But the systems that supply us with
renewable resources depend largely on
those 30 million plant and animal species.
With the destruction of natural habitats, the
chain-sawing of the world's tropical rain
forests, half or more of these may disappear
in the next 50 years. We are loosing our
ability to live on income by reducing capital
in our attempts to maintain a high level of
overpopulation.
Acid rains are absolutely critical, and in
volved in the loss of diversity. It's causing
international incidents with Canada already.
We now have lost the fishes and much of the
rest of the aquatic biota of many lakes in the
northeastern parts of North America, in
Sweden, in Norway. Some biologists believe
acid rains in Europe are changing the soils so
that the forests of Europe are already
doomed — that there is no way to fix the soil
back up so that the forests can survive.
Development in general is, of course, an
enormous problem. We need to preserve
natural ecological systems that supply soci
ety with vital services. We've disturbed more
than enough of the planet. Ideally, not one
more square inch of the United States
should be developed, and not one more
acre of tropical rain forest should be cut
down. The rain forests help control our cli
mate. If they are largely destroyed, North
5 America may no longer be able to grow
5 surplus grain, and that alone could risk the
lives of hundreds of millions of people.
£
£ Is it economic systems that are leading to
3= this behavior?
o All industrial economic systems promote
- the wrong kind of behavior, be they com
munist, socialist or capitalist, because
they're all basically steel eating, radical sys
tems rather than conservative systems.
None of today's systems emphasize quality
of capital; they emphasize speed of
throughput. Both capitalist and communist
systems turn natural resources into rubbish
as fast as they can.
Where I grew up there were orange groves
and bean fields which are now covered by
tract houses. What do you do when there are
economic incentives to build them?
The economic system is shoving us con
tinually towards doom. Most economists
and businessmen think it's perfectly all right
to cover farmland with houses. Simon
explicitly states that you can always tear the
houses back off, and the soil will still be
there. Apparently, he doesn't know what
soil is.
Then what can we do when there is a
pressure for more housing?
What we should do is tear down a slum
area, put up more decent high rise apart
ments, and find social devices that will per
mit the people who previously lived in the
slum to afford the new housing. You could
tear down the plastic motels that are now
decaying along the highways of the South
eastern United States and put housing there.
We need redesign and redevelopment —
not the creation of more sprawl and more
"slums of tomorrow."
Then what do you say to the farmer and the
developer who want to make a deal?
You tell them they can't. You simply forbid
development. That's what governments are
for, to do the things corporately that people
will not do individually. One of the things
that we all want to do is eat, and if we allow
developers to get rich by developing farm
land, sooner or later no one, including the
developers, will be able to eat. And that's a
fact of nature. We don't put a tax on murder.
We don't say, if you murder somebody,
you're taxed a hundred thousand dollars, we
simply say "you can't do it." In a sense, con
verting farm land to ticky-tacky subdivisions
is killing people in the future. And so you
simply say, "you can't do it."
There is something of a new school in his
torical thought that is attributing the decline
of a number of ancient civilizations in large

measure to their destruction of their natural
environment.
That's right. No question that it was a fac
tor in a lot of them, including the ancient
Mayan, the Khmer, and the original Tigris
and Euphrates civilizations. If you've been to
the Mediterranean Basin, it's a goatscape,
and the destruction of their forests and the
looting of their natural resources make it
very unlikely that a major power will ever
appear there again.
When did this occur?
Over a long period going all the way back
to the Egyptians. There is a controversial
book by Donald Hughes that outlines many
of the arguments.
What could Stanford students do tomor
row that would make you most happy and
hopeful?
Get organized full scale to beat Ronald (
Reagan in the next election. Don't wait until
a couple months before the election of 1984.
There are all sorts of issues, but when you've
got a government that is absolutely dedi
cated to the destruction of environment,
and to fooling around with nuclear war, then
all the rest of it must take a back seat. This is
the leverage point right now, much better
than eating less beet or driving a less gas
consumptive car.
The thing that's such a shame is that so
much progress was made with the estab
lishment of the EPA, and with the National
Environmental Protection Act, and the Clean
Air Acts; environmental concerns were in
stitutionalized. The USA was moving in the
right direction on population growth and
giving people control of their reproduction.
Now we have an administration that's trying
to turn back the clock. And so rather than
worry about the relatively parochial con
cerns, we've got to elect a government that
is at least not outright dedicated to the de
struction of the country for fast profits. And I
would hope that Earth Day ana Earth Week
this year would be thought of as the launch
ing of a political campaign to rid us of the
worst problem this nation has ever faced.
The people in the Reagan administration
see themselves as doing the exact opposite,
don't they?
Oh I'm sure they do. Nobody sees them
selves as a bunch of greedy, ignorant fools. I
am certain that inside their heads, they have
nothing but the best of motives. Who ever
tries to destroy the world saying "I'm evil
and I'm going to destroy the world?" They all
think they're doing good. Ronald Reagan is
probably a very nice fellow. That doesn't
make any difference; what he is doing is evil.

I'm thinking of World War 11. It was an
example of wnat America can do when the
task is clear. You make it sound as if this is a
much more dangerous time in our history,
and yet it is as if we couldn't agree on
whether lapan had bombed us or not, or
whether Germany really existed.
That's a good analogy. The trouble with
the population, resource, and environmen
tal crisis, is that has developed relatively
slowly. And human beings aid not evolve
the cultural capacity to deal with crises that
appear gradually, because over the millions
of years of our history, most environmental
changes were slow enough that we could
adapt genetically. Human nervous systems
tere good at responding to sudden crises,
like a cave bear appearing back at the door of
the cave, but they are not good at respond
ing to things like climatic change or the
problems caused by gradual changes in
technology. When gradual crises do occur,
they tend to cause considerable disloca
tions, as the agricultural revolution did.
In the past, humanity did not have the
power to destroy the entire world in the
course of a cultural or historical convulsion.
In the past when these convulsions have oc-
individual societies have broken
down, there have been collossal wars, and
so on. But these have been localized. For the
first time now, the entire species has basic
ally a single global culture and economy,
and it's being screwed up. So when this one

collapses, the results are going to be enor
mously more catastrophic than those of past
collapses.
You've got to remember, I lived through
the Second World War, and it was a horrify
ing thing, but it's absolute peanuts com
pared to what a nuclear war would be. The
only debate I know scientists study
ing the effects of an all-out nuclear war is
"would there be any significant survivorship
in the Southern Hemisphere?" At the mo
ment no knowledgeable person questions
that civilization in the Northern Hemisphere
would be destroyed.

Environmental issues are
really much more critical for
people in minority groups,
because they're the ones who
are forced, for instance, to
live down wind of the power
plants while the rich wind up
getting most of the power.

You and others have warned us about
what population growth, environmental de
struction and nuclear weapons portend. I'm
thinking of World War II again. There were
lews in Northern Europe who eventually
died in concentration camps who had been
warned about what was going to happen to
them, but they risked that the warnings were
untrue rather than disrupt their lives in trying
to escape. How much have you disrupted
your life to deal with what you see?
To the extent of putting about half of my
time into this sort of policy issue when my
real interest is doing biological research. For
example, this year I've put a great deal of
time into studying the effects of thermonuc
lear war on ecosystems. That's about as in
teresting to a biologist as studying the ef
fects of putting a double barreled shotgun in
your mouth and pulling the trigger would be
to a physician. It is an issue of almost zero
interest for basic ecology, and yet it turns
out to be something from an educational
point of view that we've got to do.
I have disrupted my life by having one
child when I might have preferred more. But
I have not moved to New Zealand or Au
stralia because I don't think it would do any
good. But I would if I did. Everybody ought
to tithe to society — put 10 percent of their
time into trying to improve it. This year their
tithe should go into frying to prevent nuclear
war, because any other social issue that
you're concerned with becomes moot if we
blow up the Northern Hemisphere.
An ecologist, Aldo Leopold, said that to
"receive an ecological education is to live
alone in a world of wounds." How much
does the picture of the world that you see get
to you?
Well, first of all, I don't have to live alone
in a world of wounds because I've got 20 or
so colleagues here in the population biology
group who, to a very large degree, share my
perception of it. But it still — it doesn't
bother me continuously, I can shut it out —
but it is disturbing to realize that I have seen
an enormous deterioration of the planet in
my lifetime, and that my daughter and
people of your generation are inheriting a
very badly messed up and increasingly
dangerous planet, and that's very very sad.
But, I don't run around in a constant depres
sion. As long as there is wine and women
and an occasional song, you can live with it.
Besides these, along what avenues can we
gather up hope for the future of human ex
perience?
Well I think there is enormous potential
for turning things around. Most demog
raphers thought 15 years ago that it was im
possible to get the reproductive rate in the
U.S. to replacement level until aftertheyear
2000; it happened in the early 19705. There's
no reason at all why the economic system
couldn't be turned around extremely
rapidly, or why we couldn't change the ways
we treat each other — getting ria of racism,
and other forms of chauvinism — and get
together and solve these problems. The
challenge that faces humanity today is a very
interesting one; we are either going to
change our behavior or we're going to go
down the tubes. And the people who are
raving on about how many more people we
can have, and how we can make copper out
of other metals, and so on, are simply say
ing, "don't change your ways, go down the
tubes," and if nothing else, it's interesting.
But it is at least conceivable that we could
finally make the changes that need to be
made in the way we deal with our environ
ment, and in the way we deal with one
another. It's not very likely. In summary, I
am extremely optimistic about what we
could do, I am extremely pessimistic about
what we will do.

one time bonanza of fossil fuels, other
highly concentrated minerals, fertile soils,
and biological riches — as many as 30 million
species by the most recent measure, and
billions of natural populations. It's a one
time bonanza, and when it's gone, humanity
will have to fall back on renewable re
sources. But the systems that supply us with
renewable resources depend largely on
those 30 million plant and animal species.
With the destruction of natural habitats, the
chain-sawing of the world's tropical rain
forests, half or more of these may disappear
in the next 50 years. We are loosing our
ability to live on income by reducing capital
in our attempts to maintain a high level of
overpopulation.
Acid rains are absolutely critical, and in
volved in the loss of diversity. It's causing
international incidents with Canada already.
We now have lost the fishes and much of the
rest of the aquatic biota of many lakes in the
northeastern parts of North America, in
Sweden, in Norway. Some biologists believe
acid rains in Europe are changing the soils so
that the forests of Europe are already
doomed — that there is no way to fix the soil
back up so that the forests can survive.
Development in general is, of course, an
enormous problem. We need to preserve
natural ecological systems that supply soci
ety with vital services. We've disturbed more
than enough of the planet. Ideally, not one
more square inch of the United States
should be developed, and not one more
acre of tropical rain forest should be cut
down. The rain forests help control our cli
mate. If they are largely destroyed, North
5 America may no longer be able to grow
5 surplus grain, and that alone could risk the
lives of hundreds of millions of people.

£ Is it economic systems that are leading to
3= this behavior?
o All industrial economic systems promote
- the wrong kind of behavior, be they com
munist, socialist or capitalist, because
they're all basically steel eating, radical sys
tems rather than conservative systems.
None of today's systems emphasize quality
of capital; they emphasize speed of
throughput. Both capitalist and communist
systems turn natural resources into rubbish
as fast as they can.
Where I grew up there were orange groves
and bean fields which are now covered by
tract houses. What do you do when there are
economic incentives to build them?
The economic system is shoving us con
tinually towards doom. Most economists
and businessmen think it's perfectly all right
to cover farmland with houses. Simon
explicitly states that you can always tear the
houses back off, and the soil will still be
there. Apparently, he doesn't know what
soil is.
Then what can we do when there is a
pressure for more housing?
What we should do is tear down a slum
area, put up more decent high rise apart
ments, and find social devices that will per
mit the people who previously lived in the
slum to afford the new housing. You could
tear down the plastic motels that are now
decaying along the highways of the South
eastern United States and put housing there.
We need redesign and redevelopment —
not the creation of more sprawl and more
"slums of tomorrow."
Then what do you say to the farmer and the
developer who want to make a deal?
You tell them they can't. You simply forbid
development. That's what governments are
for, to do the things corporately that people
will not do individually. One of the things
that we all want to do is eat, and if we allow
developers to get rich by developing farm
land, sooner or later no one, including the
developers, will be able to eat. And that's a
fact of nature. We don't put a tax on murder.
We don't say, if you murder somebody,
you're taxed a hundred thousand dollars, we
simply say "you can't do it." In a sense, con
verting farm land to ticky-tacky subdivisions
is killing people in the future. And so you
simply say, "you can't do it."
There is something of a new school in his
torical thought that is attributing the decline
of a number of ancient civilizations in large

measure to their destruction of their natural
environment.
That's right. No question that it was a fac
tor in a lot of them, including the ancient
Mayan, the Khmer, and the original Tigris
and Euphrates civilizations. If you've been to
the Mediterranean Basin, it's a goatscape,
and the destruction of their forests and the
looting of their natural resources make it
very unlikely that a major power will ever
appear there again.
When did this occur?
Over a long period going all the way back
to the Egyptians. There is a controversial
book by Donald Hughes that outlines many
of the arguments.
What could Stanford students do tomor
row that would make you most happy and
hopeful?
Get organized full scale to beat Ronald (
Reagan in the next election. Don't wait until
a couple months before the election of 1984.
There are all sorts of issues, but when you've
got a government that is absolutely dedi
cated to the destruction of environment,
and to fooling around with nuclear war, then
all the rest of it must take a back seat. This is
the leverage point right now, much better
than eating less beet or driving a less gas
consumptive car.
The thing that's such a shame is that so
much progress was made with the estab
lishment of the EPA, and with the National
Environmental Protection Act, and the Clean
Air Acts; environmental concerns were in
stitutionalized. The USA was moving in the
right direction on population growth and
giving people control of their reproduction.
Now we have an administration that's trying
to turn back the clock. And so rather than
worry about the relatively parochial con
cerns, we've got to elect a government that
is at least not outright dedicated to the de
struction of the country for fast profits. And I
would hope that Earth Day ana Earth Week
this year would be thought of as the launch
ing of a political campaign to rid us of the
worst problem this nation has ever faced.
The people in the Reagan administration
see themselves as doing the exact opposite,
don't they?
Oh I'm sure they do. Nobody sees them
selves as a bunch of greedy, ignorant fools. I
am certain that inside their heads, they have
nothing but the best of motives. Who ever
tries to destroy the world saying "I'm evil
and I'm going to destroy the world?" They all
think they're doing good. Ronald Reagan is
probably a very nice fellow. That doesn't
make any difference; what he is doing is evil.

I'm thinking of World War 11. It was an
example of wnat America can do when the
task is clear. You make it sound as if this is a
much more dangerous time in our history,
and yet it is as if we couldn't agree on
whether lapan had bombed us or not, or
whether Germany really existed.
That's a good analogy. The trouble with
the population, resource, and environmen
tal crisis, is that has developed relatively
slowly. And human beings aid not evolve
the cultural capacity to deal with crises that
appear gradually, because over the millions
of years of our history, most environmental
changes were slow enough that we could
adapt genetically. Human nervous systems
tere good at responding to sudden crises,
like a cave bear appearing back at the door of
the cave, but they are not good at respond
ing to things like climatic change or the
problems caused by gradual changes in
technology. When gradual crises do occur,
they tend to cause considerable disloca
tions, as the agricultural revolution did.
In the past, humanity did not have the
power to destroy the entire world in the
course of a cultural or historical convulsion.
In the past when these convulsions have oc-
individual societies have broken
down, there have been collossal wars, and
so on. But these have been localized. For the
first time now, the entire species has basic
ally a single global culture and economy,
and it's being screwed up. So when this one

collapses, the results are going to be enor
mously more catastrophic than those of past
collapses.
You've got to remember, I lived through
the Second World War, and it was a horrify
ing thing, but it's absolute peanuts com
pared to what a nuclear war would be. The
only debate I know scientists study
ing the effects of an all-out nuclear war is
"would there be any significant survivorship
in the Southern Hemisphere?" At the mo
ment no knowledgeable person questions
that civilization in the Northern Hemisphere
would be destroyed.

Environmental issues are
really much more critical for
people in minority groups,
because they're the ones who
are forced, for instance, to
live down wind of the power
plants while the rich wind up
getting most of the power.

You and others have warned us about
what population growth, environmental de
struction and nuclear weapons portend. I'm
thinking of World War II again. There were
lews in Northern Europe who eventually
died in concentration camps who had been
warned about what was going to happen to
them, but they risked that the warnings were
untrue rather than disrupt their lives in trying
to escape. How much have you disrupted
your life to deal with what you see?
To the extent of putting about half of my
time into this sort of policy issue when my
real interest is doing biological research. For
example, this year I've put a great deal of
time into studying the effects of thermonuc
lear war on ecosystems. That's about as in
teresting to a biologist as studying the ef
fects of putting a double barreled shotgun in
your mouth and pulling the trigger would be
to a physician. It is an issue of almost zero
interest for basic ecology, and yet it turns
out to be something from an educational
point of view that we've got to do.
I have disrupted my life by having one
child when I might have preferred more. But
I have not moved to New Zealand or Au
stralia because I don't think it would do any
good. But I would if I did. Everybody ought
to tithe to society — put 10 percent of their
time into trying to improve it. This year their
tithe should go into frying to prevent nuclear
war, because any other social issue that
you're concerned with becomes moot if we
blow up the Northern Hemisphere.
An ecologist, Aldo Leopold, said that to
"receive an ecological education is to live
alone in a world of wounds." How much
does the picture of the world that you see get
to you?
Well, first of all, I don't have to live alone
in a world of wounds because I've got 20 or
so colleagues here in the population biology
group who, to a very large degree, share my
perception of it. But it still — it doesn't
bother me continuously, I can shut it out —
but it is disturbing to realize that I have seen
an enormous deterioration of the planet in
my lifetime, and that my daughter and
people of your generation are inheriting a
very badly messed up and increasingly
dangerous planet, and that's very very sad.
But, I don't run around in a constant depres
sion. As long as there is wine and women
and an occasional song, you can live with it.
Besides these, along what avenues can we
gather up hope for the future of human ex
perience?
Well I think there is enormous potential
for turning things around. Most demog
raphers thought 15 years ago that it was im
possible to get the reproductive rate in the
U.S. to replacement level until aftertheyear
2000; it happened in the early 19705. There's
no reason at all why the economic system
couldn't be turned around extremely
rapidly, or why we couldn't change the ways
we treat each other — getting ria of racism,
and other forms of chauvinism — and get
together and solve these problems. The
challenge that faces humanity today is a very
interesting one; we are either going to
change our behavior or we're going to go
down the tubes. And the people who are
raving on about how many more people we
can have, and how we can make copper out
of other metals, and so on, are simply say
ing, "don't change your ways, go down the
tubes," and if nothing else, it's interesting.
But it is at least conceivable that we could
finally make the changes that need to be
made in the way we deal with our environ
ment, and in the way we deal with one
another. It's not very likely. In summary, I
am extremely optimistic about what we
could do, I am extremely pessimistic about
what we will do.
Dr. Ehrlich will be speaking in Kresge Au
ditorium, 7:30 p.m., April 7, on "Thoughts
for the design of a sane world."


(Editors note: Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a major
environmental lobbyist, helped form the zero
population growth movement.)

Do you conceive that even all of the ter
restrial vertebrates could die?
Nobody knows for sure. One of the pos
sibilities is that there would be a couple of
months of total darkness and below freezing
temperatures over the entire globe. If the
timing were unlucky then most of the ter
restrial vertebrates could go extinct — but
some, like rats, would almost certainly sur
vive.
This is what Dr. Paul Ehrlich, professor of
biology, replied when I asked him about the
possible effects of an all-out thermonuclear
war. Ehrlich is involved now in setting up a
series of meetings of scientists across the
country to discuss the environmental effects
of nuclear war. His involvement with en
vironmental issues is nothing new. In 1968
he published The Population Bomb, which
gained nationwide attention and helped
form the zero population growth move
ment, and he has continued to be a major
figure in the environmental movement. In
his travels from Stockholm to Berkeley he
has been called everything from an instru
ment of imperialism to an ivory tower social
engineer. Here, Ehrlich does research on
butterfly and plant coevolution.
One of your colleagues said that you had
done something that no one in history has
ever been able to do, namely, to bring
awareness of the dangers of overpopulation
into the bedrooms of couples throughout
the country and change their reproductive
behavior. When you were a college
freshman, did you have any idea that you
might be influencing the population growth
of the developed world?
Well, I'm not sure that I have. I may have
had some small part in it. But yes, when I was
atreshman incollege I started readingbooks
and participating in bull-sessions on popula
tion issues. Anci my interest in it persisted.
But I didn't have any idea ofwhetherl'd ever
do anything about it, that was pure serendip
ity. I didn't stand up one day and say, "My
Cod, I'm going to get everybody to stop
procreating."
Why has the environment been such a
major concern of yours? Should I be /ust as
worried?
Of course the reason I'm worried about
the environment is that, like other
ecologists, I understand that the environ
ment is what supports our lives; if it goes
down the tubes, we go down the tubes with
it. If you understand how the world works,
you know that to ignore the environment is
to destroy the economic system. If you
don't, then you're in a class with Secretary of
the Interior lames Watt or President Reagan
and a danger to society.
But a number of students here, particularly
from ethnic minorities, have said to me they
felt that environmental problems were a lux
ury issue when seen against problems of so
cial justice.
Environmental issues are reallv much
more critical for people in minority groups,
because they're tne ones who are forced, for
instance, to live down wind of *he pov.er
plants while the rich wind up n 2 most of
the poyver. The poor'are the ones •*.
suffer first when food occu * ~ie'.
are, and will be, the major -ure'ers
environmental problems.
It is a standard mistake - o ** v en
vironmental activism as being eq j <alen* *o
just concern for trout streams it ; c;ear at
some "environmentalists' only *- '< as-ou
the environment in terms of cozv su"o „nd
ings for them and their hobbies. That's d-***
of it, but that's only a minor part. T ne basic
message of the environmental movement
must be: understand that the ecosvstems of
this planet support our lives, and under
stand that we are busily destroying them and
when we've completed the job we'll be gone
too.
Is it that people don't believe the envi
ronment is in danger? Or that they don't
care, or are unable to change what they're
doingt
I think the major part of the problem is ] ust
plain lack of education. It's clear that no
sensible person, once they understood the
problems, would ignore them. But there are
very few places in our society where you can
learn anything about the basics of environ
mental problems. It's an issue that's rela
tively new in out society. Ecology was a little
known technical field until about 15 years
ago. That's not much time if you want to
educate people from grade school through

college. We are in a society that is falling
behind in its mathematics and science edu
cation anyway. And there are powerful
forces that don't want environmental educa
tion, people who feel extremely threatened
by the ecological message.
How can they be eased out of this feeling
of threat?
I think that there is no way, in all probabil
ity, to convert a Ronald Reagan or a lames
Watt to a sensible position. Watt thinks the
world is going to end in a few years and
doesn't care what happens between now
and then, and considering the foreign policy
of his boss, he may be right. What you have
to do is start educating younger people and
remove dangerous people like that from po
sitions of influence.
What do we need, then, in the way of
education?
What we need is people who have the
tools to analyze problems as they arise, and
expose some of the idiocy in the world. In
stead of courses on "how lo save society,"
I d rather have students learn to be confi
dent with math and to read and write well, to
have some basic acquaintance with physics,
chemistry and biology, as well as history and
literature. An entire generation of
economists has been produced who don't
even understand the second law of ther
modynamics and the implications of that for
their discipline, and that's like having blind
pilots flying your airplane.

How would you illustrate the second law,
say, in an economic context?
The second law says, basically, that in any
real world process, some energy is degraded
to a less useful form. It also states that, in the
absence of inputs of high grade energy,
there will be an inexorable tendency for
concentrations of substances to disperse.
Economic systems need inputs of energy to
replace what was degraded, and concen
trated materials to replace what was dis
persed. Anybody who has had an economics
course with a standard textbook can see, by
simply 100 king at the circular diagram of the
generation of gross national product or
gross national income, that there are no
physical inputs into the system. It is a dia
gram of a perpetual motion machine, which
the second law says cannot work. So the
world view of many economists is funda
mentally flawed.
So what is needed, in a sense, is a change
r the belief of an educated person as to
.-.hat is important knowledge. The second
a a of thermodynamics is not seen today as
something everybody should know.
That's right. And ignorance of basic
physics led an economist, Julian Simon, to
a rite in Science magazine that the only limit
'o the amount of copper that can be made
available to humanity is the weight of the
universe.
I heard a veteran of some atomic tests
being interviewed on KGO radio, who was
saying how our country could survive an all
out nuclear war. People were calling up and
saying he was crazy, and his reply was,
"Well, you're entitled to your opinions and
I'm entitled to mine." How much do you
think people believe that. . . .
. . . everybody's opinion is just as good as
everybody else's? Much too much. One of
the funniest things that ever happened to
me at Stanford was one day, a colleague and
I were sitting in the coffee room, and a guy
came in and he said, "I hear you people are
concerned with the world food problem and
shortages of water." We said "yeh," and he
said, "I got a plan to solve the water problem
of the United States." I said "What is it?" and
he said, "We're gonna dig a canal to bring
the water from the Greenland ice cap to the
southwest." I said, "It's going to be an in
teresting exercise, because you're going to

have to dig that canal through the north At
lantic Ocean," and he said, "That's your
opinion, not mine." And that's typical. He
thinks that whether Greenland's an island or
not is just a matter of opinion. This
economist Simon has the opinion you can
make copper in economic quantities out of
other metals. Well that's his opinion. The
point is, unfortunately, everybody's opinion
isn't as good as everybody else's.
What would you say are the "biggies" in
environmental problems?
Population is the most fundamental one.
We're only managing to support 4.fa billion
people by doing tnings that no sensible fam
ily would ever do in tneir personal finances:
we're living on our capital, we're using up a
one time bonanza of fossil fuels, other
highly concentrated minerals, fertile soils,
and biological riches — as many as 30 million
species by the most recent measure, and
billions of natural populations. It's a one

you're concerned with becomes moot if we
blow up the Northern Hemisphere.
An ecologist, Aldo Leopold, said that to
"receive an ecological education is to live
alone in a world of wounds." How much
does the picture of the world that you see get
to you?
Well, first of all, I don't have to live alone
in a world of wounds because I've got 20 or
so colleagues here in the population biology
group who, to a very large degree, share my
perception of it. But it still — it doesn't
bother me continuously, I can shut it out —
but it is disturbing to realize that I have seen
an enormous deterioration of the planet in
my lifetime, and that my daughter and
people of your generation are inheriting a
very badly messed up and increasingly
dangerous planet, and that's very very sad.
But, I don't run around in a constant depres
sion. As long as there is wine and women
and an occasional song, you can live with it.
Besides these, along what avenues can we
gather up hope for the future of human ex
perience?
Well I think there is enormous potential
for turning things around. Most demog
raphers thought 15 years ago that it was im
possible to get the reproductive rate in the
U.S. to replacement level until aftertheyear
2000; it happened in the early 19705. There's
no reason at all why the economic system
couldn't be turned around extremely
rapidly, or why we couldn't change the ways
we treat each other — getting ria of racism,
and other forms of chauvinism — and get
together and solve these problems. The
challenge that faces humanity today is a very
interesting one; we are either going to
change our behavior or we're going to go
down the tubes. And the people who are
raving on about how many more people we
can have, and how we can make copper out
of other metals, and so on, are simply say
ing, "don't change your ways, go down the
tubes," and if nothing else, it's interesting.
But it is at least conceivable that we could
finally make the changes that need to be
made in the way we deal with our environ
ment, and in the way we deal with one
another. It's not very likely. In summary, I
am extremely optimistic about what we
could do, I am extremely pessimistic about
what we will do.
Dr. Ehrlich will be speaking in Kresge Au
ditorium, 7:30 p.m., April 7, on "Thoughts
for the design of a sane world."


(Editors note: Biology Prof. Paul Ehrlich, a major
environmental lobbyist, helped form the zero
population growth movement.)

Do you conceive that even all of the ter
restrial vertebrates could die?
Nobody knows for sure. One of the pos
sibilities is that there would be a couple of
months of total darkness and below freezing
temperatures over the entire globe. If the
timing were unlucky then most of the ter
restrial vertebrates could go extinct — but
some, like rats, would almost certainly sur
vive.
This is what Dr. Paul Ehrlich, professor of
biology, replied when I asked him about the
possible effects of an all-out thermonuclear
war. Ehrlich is involved now in setting up a
series of meetings of scientists across the
country to discuss the environmental effects
of nuclear war. His involvement with en
vironmental issues is nothing new. In 1968
he published The Population Bomb, which
gained nationwide attention and helped
form the zero population growth move
ment, and he has continued to be a major
figure in the environmental movement. In
his travels from Stockholm to Berkeley he
has been called everything from an instru
ment of imperialism to an ivory tower social
engineer. Here, Ehrlich does research on
butterfly and plant coevolution.
One of your colleagues said that you had
done something that no one in history has
ever been able to do, namely, to bring
awareness of the dangers of overpopulation
into the bedrooms of couples throughout
the country and change their reproductive
behavior. When you were a college
freshman, did you have any idea that you
might be influencing the population growth
of the developed world?
Well, I'm not sure that I have. I may have
had some small part in it. But yes, when I was
atreshman incollege I started readingbooks
and participating in bull-sessions on popula
tion issues. Anci my interest in it persisted.
But I didn't have any idea ofwhetherl'd ever
do anything about it, that was pure serendip
ity. I didn't stand up one day and say, "My
Cod, I'm going to get everybody to stop
procreating."
Why has the environment been such a
major concern of yours? Should I be /ust as
worried?
Of course the reason I'm worried about
the environment is that, like other
ecologists, I understand that the environ
ment is what supports our lives; if it goes
down the tubes, we go down the tubes with
it. If you understand how the world works,
you know that to ignore the environment is
to destroy the economic system. If you
don't, then you're in a class with Secretary of
the Interior lames Watt or President Reagan
and a danger to society.
But a number of students here, particularly
from ethnic minorities, have said to me they
felt that environmental problems were a lux
ury issue when seen against problems of so
cial justice.
Environmental issues are reallv much
more critical for people in minority groups,
because they're tne ones who are forced, for
instance, to live down wind of *he pov.er
plants while the rich wind up n 2 most of
the poyver. The poor'are the ones •*.
suffer first when food occu * ~ie'.
are, and will be, the major -ure'ers
environmental problems.
It is a standard mistake - o ** v en
vironmental activism as being eq j <alen* *o
just concern for trout streams it ; c;ear at
some "environmentalists' only *- '< as-ou
the environment in terms of cozv su"o „nd
ings for them and their hobbies. That's d-***
of it, but that's only a minor part. T ne basic
message of the environmental movement
must be: understand that the ecosvstems of
this planet support our lives, and under
stand that we are busily destroying them and
when we've completed the job we'll be gone
too.
Is it that people don't believe the envi
ronment is in danger? Or that they don't
care, or are unable to change what they're
doingt
I think the major part of the problem is ] ust
plain lack of education. It's clear that no
sensible person, once they understood the
problems, would ignore them. But there are
very few places in our society where you can
learn anything about the basics of environ
mental problems. It's an issue that's rela
tively new in out society. Ecology was a little
known technical field until about 15 years
ago. That's not much time if you want to
educate people from grade school through

college. We are in a society that is falling
behind in its mathematics and science edu
cation anyway. And there are powerful
forces that don't want environmental educa
tion, people who feel extremely threatened
by the ecological message.
How can they be eased out of this feeling
of threat?
I think that there is no way, in all probabil
ity, to convert a Ronald Reagan or a lames
Watt to a sensible position. Watt thinks the
world is going to end in a few years and
doesn't care what happens between now
and then, and considering the foreign policy
of his boss, he may be right. What you have
to do is start educating younger people and
remove dangerous people like that from po
sitions of influence.
What do we need, then, in the way of
education?
What we need is people who have the
tools to analyze problems as they arise, and
expose some of the idiocy in the world. In
stead of courses on "how lo save society,"
I d rather have students learn to be confi
dent with math and to read and write well, to
have some basic acquaintance with physics,
chemistry and biology, as well as history and
literature. An entire generation of
economists has been produced who don't
even understand the second law of ther
modynamics and the implications of that for
their discipline, and that's like having blind
pilots flying your airplane.

How would you illustrate the second law,
say, in an economic context?
The second law says, basically, that in any
real world process, some energy is degraded
to a less useful form. It also states that, in the
absence of inputs of high grade energy,
there will be an inexorable tendency for
concentrations of substances to disperse.
Economic systems need inputs of energy to
replace what was degraded, and concen
trated materials to replace what was dis
persed. Anybody who has had an economics
course with a standard textbook can see, by
simply 100 king at the circular diagram of the
generation of gross national product or
gross national income, that there are no
physical inputs into the system. It is a dia
gram of a perpetual motion machine, which
the second law says cannot work. So the
world view of many economists is funda
mentally flawed.
So what is needed, in a sense, is a change
r the belief of an educated person as to
.-.hat is important knowledge. The second
a a of thermodynamics is not seen today as
something everybody should know.
That's right. And ignorance of basic
physics led an economist, Julian Simon, to
a rite in Science magazine that the only limit
'o the amount of copper that can be made
available to humanity is the weight of the
universe.
I heard a veteran of some atomic tests
being interviewed on KGO radio, who was
saying how our country could survive an all
out nuclear war. People were calling up and
saying he was crazy, and his reply was,
"Well, you're entitled to your opinions and
I'm entitled to mine." How much do you
think people believe that. . . .
. . . everybody's opinion is just as good as
everybody else's? Much too much. One of
the funniest things that ever happened to
me at Stanford was one day, a colleague and
I were sitting in the coffee room, and a guy
came in and he said, "I hear you people are
concerned with the world food problem and
shortages of water." We said "yeh," and he
said, "I got a plan to solve the water problem
of the United States." I said "What is it?" and
he said, "We're gonna dig a canal to bring
the water from the Greenland ice cap to the
southwest." I said, "It's going to be an in
teresting exercise, because you're going to

have to dig that canal through the north At
lantic Ocean," and he said, "That's your
opinion, not mine." And that's typical. He
thinks that whether Greenland's an island or
not is just a matter of opinion. This
economist Simon has the opinion you can
make copper in economic quantities out of
other metals. Well that's his opinion. The
point is, unfortunately, everybody's opinion
isn't as good as everybody else's.
What would you say are the "biggies" in
environmental problems?
Population is the most fundamental one.
We're only managing to support 4.fa billion
people by doing tnings that no sensible fam
ily would ever do in tneir personal finances:
we're living on our capital, we're using up a
one time bonanza of fossil fuels, other
highly concentrated minerals, fertile soils,
and biological riches — as many as 30 million
species by the most recent measure, and
billions of natural populations. It's a one
time bonanza, and when it's gone, humanity
will have to fall back on renewable re
sources. But the systems that supply us with
renewable resources depend largely on
those 30 million plant and animal species.
With the destruction of natural habitats, the
chain-sawing of the world's tropical rain
forests, half or more of these may disappear
in the next 50 years. We are loosing our
ability to live on income by reducing capital
in our attempts to maintain a high level of
overpopulation.
Acid rains are absolutely critical, and in
volved in the loss of diversity. It's causing
international incidents with Canada already.
We now have lost the fishes and much of the
rest of the aquatic biota of many lakes in the
northeastern parts of North America, in
Sweden, in Norway. Some biologists believe
acid rains in Europe are changing the soils so
that the forests of Europe are already
doomed — that there is no way to fix the soil
back up so that the forests can survive.
Development in general is, of course, an
enormous problem. We need to preserve
natural ecological systems that supply soci
ety with vital services. We've disturbed more
than enough of the planet. Ideally, not one
more square inch of the United States
should be developed, and not one more
acre of tropical rain forest should be cut
down. The rain forests help control our cli
mate. If they are largely destroyed, North
5 America may no longer be able to grow
5 surplus grain, and that alone could risk the
lives of hundreds of millions of people.
£
£ Is it economic systems that are leading to
3= this behavior?
o All industrial economic systems promote
- the wrong kind of behavior, be they com
munist, socialist or capitalist, because
they're all basically steel eating, radical sys
tems rather than conservative systems.
None of today's systems emphasize quality
of capital; they emphasize speed of
throughput. Both capitalist and communist
systems turn natural resources into rubbish
as fast as they can.
Where I grew up there were orange groves
and bean fields which are now covered by
tract houses. What do you do when there are
economic incentives to build them?
The economic system is shoving us con
tinually towards doom. Most economists
and businessmen think it's perfectly all right
to cover farmland with houses. Simon
explicitly states that you can always tear the
houses back off, and the soil will still be
there. Apparently, he doesn't know what
soil is.
Then what can we do when there is a
pressure for more housing?
What we should do is tear down a slum
area, put up more decent high rise apart
ments, and find social devices that will per
mit the people who previously lived in the
slum to afford the new housing. You could
tear down the plastic motels that are now
decaying along the highways of the South
eastern United States and put housing there.
We need redesign and redevelopment —
not the creation of more sprawl and more
"slums of tomorrow."
Then what do you say to the farmer and the
developer who want to make a deal?
You tell them they can't. You simply forbid
development. That's what governments are
for, to do the things corporately that people
will not do individually. One of the things
that we all want to do is eat, and if we allow
developers to get rich by developing farm
land, sooner or later no one, including the
developers, will be able to eat. And that's a
fact of nature. We don't put a tax on murder.
We don't say, if you murder somebody,
you're taxed a hundred thousand dollars, we
simply say "you can't do it." In a sense, con
verting farm land to ticky-tacky subdivisions
is killing people in the future. And so you
simply say, "you can't do it."
There is something of a new school in his
torical thought that is attributing the decline
of a number of ancient civilizations in large

measure to their destruction of their natural
environment.
That's right. No question that it was a fac
tor in a lot of them, including the ancient
Mayan, the Khmer, and the original Tigris
and Euphrates civilizations. If you've been to
the Mediterranean Basin, it's a goatscape,
and the destruction of their forests and the
looting of their natural resources make it
very unlikely that a major power will ever
appear there again.
When did this occur?
Over a long period going all the way back
to the Egyptians. There is a controversial
book by Donald Hughes that outlines many
of the arguments.
What could Stanford students do tomor
row that would make you most happy and
hopeful?
Get organized full scale to beat Ronald (
Reagan in the next election. Don't wait until
a couple months before the election of 1984.
There are all sorts of issues, but when you've
got a government that is absolutely dedi
cated to the destruction of environment,
and to fooling around with nuclear war, then
all the rest of it must take a back seat. This is
the leverage point right now, much better
than eating less beet or driving a less gas
consumptive car.
The thing that's such a shame is that so
much progress was made with the estab
lishment of the EPA, and with the National
Environmental Protection Act, and the Clean
Air Acts; environmental concerns were in
stitutionalized. The USA was moving in the
right direction on population growth and
giving people control of their reproduction.
Now we have an administration that's trying
to turn back the clock. And so rather than
worry about the relatively parochial con
cerns, we've got to elect a government that
is at least not outright dedicated to the de
struction of the country for fast profits. And I
would hope that Earth Day ana Earth Week
this year would be thought of as the launch
ing of a political campaign to rid us of the
worst problem this nation has ever faced.
The people in the Reagan administration
see themselves as doing the exact opposite,
don't they?
Oh I'm sure they do. Nobody sees them
selves as a bunch of greedy, ignorant fools. I
am certain that inside their heads, they have
nothing but the best of motives. Who ever
tries to destroy the world saying "I'm evil
and I'm going to destroy the world?" They all
think they're doing good. Ronald Reagan is
probably a very nice fellow. That doesn't
make any difference; what he is doing is evil.

I'm thinking of World War 11. It was an
example of wnat America can do when the
task is clear. You make it sound as if this is a
much more dangerous time in our history,
and yet it is as if we couldn't agree on
whether lapan had bombed us or not, or
whether Germany really existed.
That's a good analogy. The trouble with
the population, resource, and environmen
tal crisis, is that has developed relatively
slowly. And human beings aid not evolve
the cultural capacity to deal with crises that
appear gradually, because over the millions
of years of our history, most environmental
changes were slow enough that we could
adapt genetically. Human nervous systems
tere good at responding to sudden crises,
like a cave bear appearing back at the door of
the cave, but they are not good at respond
ing to things like climatic change or the
problems caused by gradual changes in
technology. When gradual crises do occur,
they tend to cause considerable disloca
tions, as the agricultural revolution did.
In the past, humanity did not have the
power to destroy the entire world in the
course of a cultural or historical convulsion.
In the past when these convulsions have oc-
individual societies have broken
down, there have been collossal wars, and
so on. But these have been localized. For the
first time now, the entire species has basic
ally a single global culture and economy,
and it's being screwed up. So when this one

collapses, the results are going to be enor
mously more catastrophic than those of past
collapses.
You've got to remember, I lived through
the Second World War, and it was a horrify
ing thing, but it's absolute peanuts com
pared to what a nuclear war would be. The
only debate I know scientists study
ing the effects of an all-out nuclear war is
"would there be any significant survivorship
in the Southern Hemisphere?" At the mo
ment no knowledgeable person questions
that civilization in the Northern Hemisphere
would be destroyed.

Environmental issues are
really much more critical for
people in minority groups,
because they're the ones who
are forced, for instance, to
live down wind of the power
plants while the rich wind up
getting most of the power.

You and others have warned us about
what population growth, environmental de
struction and nuclear weapons portend. I'm
thinking of World War II again. There were
lews in Northern Europe who eventually
died in concentration camps who had been
warned about what was going to happen to
them, but they risked that the warnings were
untrue rather than disrupt their lives in trying
to escape. How much have you disrupted
your life to deal with what you see?
To the extent of putting about half of my
time into this sort of policy issue when my
real interest is doing biological research. For
example, this year I've put a great deal of
time into studying the effects of thermonuc
lear war on ecosystems. That's about as in
teresting to a biologist as studying the ef
fects of putting a double barreled shotgun in
your mouth and pulling the trigger would be
to a physician. It is an issue of almost zero
interest for basic ecology, and yet it turns
out to be something from an educational
point of view that we've got to do.
I have disrupted my life by having one
child when I might have preferred more. But
I have not moved to New Zealand or Au
stralia because I don't think it would do any
good. But I would if I did. Everybody ought
to tithe to society — put 10 percent of their
time into trying to improve it. This year their
tithe should go into frying to prevent nuclear
war, because any other social issue that
you're concerned with becomes moot if we
blow up the Northern Hemisphere.
An ecologist, Aldo Leopold, said that to
"receive an ecological education is to live
alone in a world of wounds." How much
does the picture of the world that you see get
to you?
Well, first of all, I don't have to live alone
in a world of wounds because I've got 20 or
so colleagues here in the population biology
group who, to a very large degree, share my
perception of it. But it still — it doesn't
bother me continuously, I can shut it out —
but it is disturbing to realize that I have seen
an enormous deterioration of the planet in
my lifetime, and that my daughter and
people of your generation are inheriting a
very badly messed up and increasingly
dangerous planet, and that's very very sad.
But, I don't run around in a constant depres

and an occasional song, you can live with it.

I were sitting in the coffee room, and a guy
came in and he said, "I hear you people are
concerned with the world food problem and
shortages of water." We said "yeh," and he
said, "I got a plan to solve the water problem
of the United States." I said "What is it?" and
he said, "We're gonna dig a canal to bring
the water from the Greenland ice cap to the
southwest." I said, "It's going to be an in
teresting exercise, because you're going to

have to dig that canal through the north At
lantic Ocean," and he said, "That's your
opinion, not mine." And that's typical. He
thinks that whether Greenland's an island or
not is just a matter of opinion. This
economist Simon has the opinion you can
make copper in economic quantities out of
other metals. Well that's his opinion. The
point is, unfortunately, everybody's opinion
isn't as good as everybody else's.
What would you say are the "biggies" in
environmental problems?
Population is the most fundamental one.
We're only managing to support 4.fa billion
people by doing tnings that no sensible fam
ily would ever do in tneir personal finances:
we're living on our capital, we're using up a
one time bonanza of fossil fuels, other
highly concentrated minerals, fertile soils,
and biological riches — as many as 30 million
species by the most recent measure, and
billions of natural populations. It's a one
time bonanza, and when it's gone, humanity
will have to fall back on renewable re
sources. But the systems that supply us with
renewable resources depend largely on
those 30 million plant and animal species.
With the destruction of natural habitats, the
chain-sawing of the world's tropical rain
forests, half or more of these may disappear
in the next 50 years. We are loosing our
ability to live on income by reducing capital
in our attempts to maintain a high level of
overpopulation.
Acid rains are absolutely critical, and in
volved in the loss of diversity. It's causing
international incidents with Canada already.
We now have lost the fishes and much of the
rest of the aquatic biota of many lakes in the
northeastern parts of North America, in
Sweden, in Norway. Some biologists believe
acid rains in Europe are changing the soils so
that the forests of Europe are already
doomed — that there is no way to fix the soil
back up so that the forests can survive.
Development in general is, of course, an
enormous problem. We need to preserve
natural ecological systems that supply soci
ety with vital services. We've disturbed more
than enough of the planet. Ideally, not one
more square inch of the United States
should be developed, and not one more
acre of tropical rain forest should be cut
down. The rain forests help control our cli
mate. If they are largely destroyed, North
5 America may no longer be able to grow
5 surplus grain, and that alone could risk the
lives of hundreds of millions of people.
£
£ Is it economic systems that are leading to
3= this behavior?
o All industrial economic systems promote
- the wrong kind of behavior, be they com
munist, socialist or capitalist, because
they're all basically steel eating, radical sys
tems rather than conservative systems.
None of today's systems emphasize quality
of capital; they emphasize speed of
throughput. Both capitalist and communist
systems turn natural resources into rubbish
as fast as they can.
Where I grew up there were orange groves
and bean fields which are now covered by
tract houses. What do you do when there are
economic incentives to build them?
The economic system is shoving us con
tinually towards doom. Most economists
and businessmen think it's perfectly all right
to cover farmland with houses. Simon
explicitly states that you can always tear the
houses back off, and the soil will still be
there. Apparently, he doesn't know what
soil is.
Then what can we do when there is a
pressure for more housing?
What we should do is tear down a slum
area, put up more decent high rise apart
ments, and find social devices that will per
mit the people who previously lived in the
slum to afford the new housing. You could
tear down the plastic motels that are now
decaying along the highways of the South
eastern United States and put housing there.
We need redesign and redevelopment —
not the creation of more sprawl and more
"slums of tomorrow."
Then what do you say to the farmer and the
developer who want to make a deal?
You tell them they can't. You simply forbid
development. That's what governments are
for, to do the things corporately that people
will not do individually. One of the things
that we all want to do is eat, and if we allow
developers to get rich by developing farm
land, sooner or later no one, including the
developers, will be able to eat. And that's a
fact of nature. We don't put a tax on murder.
We don't say, if you murder somebody,
you're taxed a hundred thousand dollars, we
simply say "you can't do it." In a sense, con
verting farm land to ticky-tacky subdivisions
is killing people in the future. And so you
simply say, "you can't do it."
There is something of a new school in his
torical thought that is attributing the decline
of a number of ancient civilizations in large

measure to their destruction of their natural
environment.
That's right. No question that it was a fac
tor in a lot of them, including the ancient
Mayan, the Khmer, and the original Tigris
and Euphrates civilizations. If you've been to
the Mediterranean Basin, it's a goatscape,
and the destruction of their forests and the
looting of their natural resources make it
very unlikely that a major power will ever
appear there again.
When did this occur?
Over a long period going all the way back
to the Egyptians. There is a controversial
book by Donald Hughes that outlines many
of the arguments.
What could Stanford students do tomor
row that would make you most happy and
hopeful?
Get organized full scale to beat Ronald (
Reagan in the next election. Don't wait until
a couple months before the election of 1984.
There are all sorts of issues, but when you've
got a government that is absolutely dedi
cated to the destruction of environment,
and to fooling around with nuclear war, then
all the rest of it must take a back seat. This is
the leverage point right now, much better
than eating less beet or driving a less gas
consumptive car.
The thing that's such a shame is that so
much progress was made with the estab
lishment of the EPA, and with the National
Environmental Protection Act, and the Clean
Air Acts; environmental concerns were in
stitutionalized. The USA was moving in the
right direction on population growth and
giving people control of their reproduction.
Now we have an administration that's trying
to turn back the clock. And so rather than
worry about the relatively parochial con
cerns, we've got to elect a government that
is at least not outright dedicated to the de
struction of the country for fast profits. And I
would hope that Earth Day ana Earth Week
this year would be thought of as the launch
ing of a political campaign to rid us of the
worst problem this nation has ever faced.
The people in the Reagan administration
see themselves as doing the exact opposite,
don't they?
Oh I'm sure they do. Nobody sees them
selves as a bunch of greedy, ignorant fools. I
am certain that inside their heads, they have
nothing but the best of motives. Who ever
tries to destroy the world saying "I'm evil
and I'm going to destroy the world?" They all
think they're doing good. Ronald Reagan is
probably a very nice fellow. That doesn't
make any difference; what he is doing is evil.

I'm thinking of World War 11. It was an
example of wnat America can do when the
task is clear. You make it sound as if this is a
much more dangerous time in our history,
and yet it is as if we couldn't agree on
whether lapan had bombed us or not, or
whether Germany really existed.
That's a good analogy. The trouble with
the population, resource, and environmen
tal crisis, is that has developed relatively
slowly. And human beings aid not evolve
the cultural capacity to deal with crises that
appear gradually, because over the millions
of years of our history, most environmental
changes were slow enough that we could
adapt genetically. Human nervous systems
tere good at responding to sudden crises,
like a cave bear appearing back at the door of
the cave, but they are not good at respond
ing to things like climatic change or the
problems caused by gradual changes in
technology. When gradual crises do occur,
they tend to cause considerable disloca
tions, as the agricultural revolution did.
In the past, humanity did not have the
power to destroy the entire world in the
course of a cultural or historical convulsion.
In the past when these convulsions have oc-
individual societies have broken
down, there have been collossal wars, and
so on. But these have been localized. For the
first time now, the entire species has basic
ally a single global culture and economy,
and it's being screwed up. So when this one

collapses, the results are going to be enor
mously more catastrophic than those of past
collapses.
You've got to remember, I lived through
the Second World War, and it was a horrify
ing thing, but it's absolute peanuts com
pared to what a nuclear war would be. The
only debate I know scientists study
ing the effects of an all-out nuclear war is
"would there be any significant survivorship
in the Southern Hemisphere?" At the mo
ment no knowledgeable person questions
that civilization in the Northern Hemisphere
would be destroyed.

Environmental issues are
really much more critical for
people in minority groups,
because they're the ones who
are forced, for instance, to
live down wind of the power
plants while the rich wind up
getting most of the power.

You and others have warned us about
what population growth, environmental de
struction and nuclear weapons portend. I'm
thinking of World War II again. There were
lews in Northern Europe who eventually
died in concentration camps who had been
warned about what was going to happen to
them, but they risked that the warnings were
untrue rather than disrupt their lives in trying
to escape. How much have you disrupted
your life to deal with what you see?
To the extent of putting about half of my
time into this sort of policy issue when my
real interest is doing biological research. For
example, this year I've put a great deal of
time into studying the effects of thermonuc
lear war on ecosystems. That's about as in
teresting to a biologist as studying the ef
fects of putting a double barreled shotgun in
your mouth and pulling the trigger would be
to a physician. It is an issue of almost zero
interest for basic ecology, and yet it turns
out to be something from an educational
point of view that we've got to do.
I have disrupted my life by having one
child when I might have preferred more. But
I have not moved to New Zealand or Au
stralia because I don't think it would do any
good. But I would if I did. Everybody ought
to tithe to society — put 10 percent of their
time into trying to improve it. This year their
tithe should go into frying to prevent nuclear
war, because any other social issue that
you're concerned with becomes moot if we
blow up the Northern Hemisphere.
An ecologist, Aldo Leopold, said that to
"receive an ecological education is to live
alone in a world of wounds." How much
does the picture of the world that you see get
to you?
Well, first of all, I don't have to live alone
in a world of wounds because I've got 20 or
so colleagues here in the population biology
group who, to a very large degree, share my
perception of it. But it still — it doesn't
bother me continuously, I can shut it out —
but it is disturbing to realize that I have seen
an enormous deterioration of the planet in
my lifetime, and that my daughter and
people of your generation are inheriting a
very badly messed up and increasingly
dangerous planet, and that's very very sad.
But, I don't run around in a constant depres
sion. As long as there is wine and women
and an occasional song, you can live with it.
Besides these, along what avenues can we
gather up hope for the future of human ex
perience?
Well I think there is enormous potential
for turning things around. Most demog
raphers thought 15 years ago that it was im
possible to get the reproductive rate in the
U.S. to replacement level until aftertheyear
2000; it happened in the early 19705. There's
no reason at all why the economic system
couldn't be turned around extremely
rapidly, or why we couldn't change the ways
we treat each other — getting ria of racism,
and other forms of chauvinism — and get
together and solve these problems. The
challenge that faces humanity today is a very
interesting one; we are either going to
change our behavior or we're going to go
down the tubes. And the people who are
raving on about how many more people we
can have, and how we can make copper out
of other metals, and so on, are simply say
ing, "don't change your ways, go down the
tubes," and if nothing else, it's interesting.
But it is at least conceivable that we could
finally make the changes that need to be
made in the way we deal with our environ
ment, and in the way we deal with one
another. It's not very likely. In summary, I
am extremely optimistic about what we
could do, I am extremely pessimistic about
what we will do.
Dr. Ehrlich will be speaking in Kresge Au
ditorium, 7:30 p.m., April 7, on "Thoughts
for the design of a sane world."
