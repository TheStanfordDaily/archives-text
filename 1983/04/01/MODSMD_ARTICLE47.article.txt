# Fac/Sen debates cause of grad minority enrollment decline

The severe decline in minority graduate student en
rollment here reflects the situation nationwide and is
cause tor "grave concern and renewed action" in the
office of graduate studies, Assoc. Dean Albert Celpi told
the Faculty Senate yesterday.
"The tact that the situation at Stanford is repeated and
mirrored throughout American higher education in a
general and national decline in minority graduate stu
dents doesn't help us solve our problem, it only pro
vides a working context for this challenge that faces us,"
Gelpi said.
Medical School Prof. Saul Rosenberg argued that the
University's program was not at fault in the decline. "The
program at present has to be judged more or less a social
failure. What I mean by social failure is that in the fields
that I know about, there hasn't been any significant
improvement in the representation of minorities, par
ticularly at the professional level. I think the reason for
this is that the pool is not only limited but has in the past
few years gotten to be a poorer pool from which to
select.
"Stanford is inevitably and correctly going to be rather
elitist in its selection and if this continues, it will make
the problem more difficult as time goes on. Given the
lack of support for education in the cities, given the lack
of support for education in the public sector, and given
general circumstances that color the field of education
now, the maintenance of a serious affirmative action
program is very problematic," Rosenberg said.
Bernard Roth, a professor of mechanical engineering,
said the current minority recruitment system "is not
working." Roth suggested that individual faculty mem

bers might be willing to become more involved in the
recruiting process.
Gelpi replied that the dean's office was looking into
programs which might involve faculty "mentors" in an
effort to inspire additional minority students to attend
graduate school.
Gelpi also emphasized that in a year when minority
graduate student enrollment decreased, the Universi
ty's recruiting efforts were greater than any previous
year. Last year, three assistant deans pursued minority
recruitment, visiting campuses, attending conferences
and working to develop other programs such as name
exchanges, departmental recruitment and an intra
university faculty network system.
Keith Naylor, one of the three assistant deans, said
that the responsibility for recruitment should be shared
by the faculty and the dean's office. "You are the critical
people that would attract students to our programs.
Success or failure of affirmative action at Stanford rests
in large part on the schools and departments of the
University."
Despite the indications of the report, Gelpi said he
expected improvement in the near future. "I think the
senators will be glad to know that at Ifeast at this point
things look a little better in some respects than last year.
Prospects seem hopeful." He indicated that there was
approximately a 10 percent increase in the number of
minority applicants this year.
In a separate report, Cecilia Burciaga, associate pro
vost, told the senate that the University has succeeded in
increasing the number of minority faculty members.
This success has been minimal, however. Burciaga said
that there has been much more success with efforts to
recruit female faculty members.
