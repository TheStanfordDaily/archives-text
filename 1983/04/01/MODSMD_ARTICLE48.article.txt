### LIBBY LEONARD 
A small student-run grill will open Monday in the Elliot
Program Center to serve the 800 students living in Gov
ernor's Corner. The grill, called Frog's, is located on the
second floor, overlooking the west bank of Lake
Lagunita.
"Our goal for the grill is to provide a friendly place for
students to relax, get a late-night snack and take a break
from the computers," said senior Louis Friedman, one
of Frog's three student managers. The other managers
are junior |an Nash and sophomore Sue Muncaster.
Frog's will be open Sunday through Thursday from 8
to 12 p.m. After-a three-week trial period, the managers
plan to expand the hours to include afternoons. Nash
also said that the grill will operate during special events
such as the Aqua Follies.
Residential Education furnished funds to start the eat
ing establishment. Money made will support educa
tional and social programs at the center. The managers
will receive a percentage of the expected profits, in
addition to their fixed hourly wages.
"If it's a failure, we don't lose anything from our pock
ets," Muncaster said.
The three managers were selected after submitting a
proposal to Governor's School Director |an Van Houten
and Dean of Student Affairs Norm Robinson.
The managers are responsible for hiring employees,
planning marketing strategies, controlling inventory,
selecting products, meeting health code requirements

and maintaining full financial records.
Frog's menu featuresavariety of nutritious, affordable
snacks, according to Nash. Hamburgers, hot dogs,
nachos, milkshakes, bagels, soup, chili, cookiesand ice
cream will be available. Several contracted companies,
including the Stanford Commissary, Peninsula Cream
ery, Bagel Works and the Cookie Stop, are supplying
food and beverages.
Since space was designated for the grill, Frog'spays no
rent. "This means our prices may be lower than other
places on campus," said Muncaster. "But we're not try
ing to compete with food service or other campus out
lets."
Frog's must share the lakeside lounge with six newly
installed computer terminals. "The grill is meant to
facilitate the social nature of the computer area," Fried
man said.
