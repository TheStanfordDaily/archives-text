# Rain: more of same
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
The spring in spring quarter has
gone flat.
Students enthusiastically wel
comed this week's respite from the
rain, but according to a National
Weather Service (NWS) report re
leased yesterday, yet another storm is
expected to blow in late tonight.
A shift in Pacific jet streams has
channeled all the storms that usually
hit the Northwest region further
south, resulting in the stormy weath
er that has soaked California during
the last month. A new salvo of storms
currently stretches across the Pacific
and is expected to pound the Califor
nia coast for at least another month.
No significant breaks in the cloudy
weather are expected until early to
mid-May.
If the projections hold true, this
season's aggregate rainfall will reach
almost 42 inches, double the normal
figure and one and a half times last
year's total of 28 inches.
"In mid-February, we thought the
pattern would only hold up for two
weeks," said Alistair McGowan, re
gional director of the NSW. "Now it
looks as ifCalifornia is going to really
going to have to batten down the
hatches.l don't even want to con
template what will happen when the
snow pack in the Sierra begins to
melt."
Tom Castillo, a spokesman for the
California Department of Transpor
tation, said, "It's a disaster. Our roads
are just going to melt away. We'll
spend months trying to patch High
way 1 (the coast highway) back to
gether." Santa Clara County officials
echoed this concern, saying that
many of the roads in the hil's around
Woodside will become impassable.
The implications are no less
ominous for the University com
munity which has already sustained
damages of more than $75,000 due to
the storms, said Jason Mavis, as
sociate vice president for facilities

and services. The fains of the last
month have soaked the ground so
that even moderately high winds will
blow over trees.
Mavis said that his department will
do all it can to weather the coming
onslaught. Workmen are already col
lectingsandbagsto hold back the wa
ters of Lake Lag. Large trees adjacent
buildings will be braced in an effort
to avoid accidents. Mavis also said he
had discussed closing the area
around the Dish until the weather
breaks.
Row houses have already had
problems with flooding during this
winter and the dorms surrounding
Lake Lag must also take measures to
combat flooding, Horgan said. If the
waters rise high enough, it is possible
that an evacuation of the lower floors
of Roble and Lagunita Halls as well as
the suites may have to be under
taken.
"This is really a drag. Some people
in my house hadto hangtheirclothes
from the rafters during the last
storms," said Liz Landsverk, an RA in
Granada. "I thought when I left my
parents in Kansas after spring break
that I had left the bad weather for a
change. But I guess it's true: there's
no place like home."
The weather may also affect stu
dent's emotional health, according
to David Dorosin, director of Coun
seling and Psychological Services.
"Although I can't point to any specif
ic statistics, I know bad weather bums
people out," said Dorosin. "
Bob Levy and Brian Mariscal — re
spectively commodore and admiral
of the Big Way Yacht Club — said
they have not given up hope that the
club's success this year will outshine
last year's performance despite the
rainy weather.
"If the rain stops, we'll just work
harder to make up for the lost time,"
said Levy. "If the rain doesn't stop,
we'll just have to expand into gon
dolas."
