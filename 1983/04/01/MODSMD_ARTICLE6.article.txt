# Grad students to enter housing draw
## 
### JAN MIRELES 
Graduate students will be sharing
living residences with under
graduates here next fall, according to
an official University statement is
sued late yesterday afternoon.
Reading from a one-page
statement, University President
Donald Kennedy announced the
startling policy change during a
meeting with University officials and
three members of the graduate stu
dent community. The move is un
precedented and represents a radical
departure from the University's
stance that graduate students should

not be part of the undergraduate res
idence system.
Though members of the graduate
student community have long lob
bied for increased on-campus hous
ing, the University previously gave
no indication it would consider in
cluding graduate students in the up
coming undergraduate residence
draw.
Earlier this week the Committee on
Student Services-Residences an
nounced changes in this year's draw
system, but made no mention of
graduate students. According to
committee head Louis Friedman, the

proposal was "kept under wraps until
a few last minute details could be
worked out." She added, "I said
before that what we've done this year
is just a stepping stone to greater
changes in the system."
Friedman, an assistant professor at
the Medical School, said that gradu
ate students would still be eligible for
a separate draw for Manzanita Park
and 44 spaces in co-ops if they
wanted to "avoid undergraduate liv
ing."
Though administrators admit the
scheduled changes will drastically al
ter the Residential Education system,

both Friedman and Kennedy were
quick to defend the decision. "Just
because we've done a 180 doesn't
mean we've been inconsistent,"
Friedman said.
"Lookat itthis way," Kennedy said,
"We're a diverse place. What better
way to follow through on that than to
mix grads with undergrads. I'm sure
thecombination will be stimulating."
Further explaining his apparent
enthusiasm for the decision, Ken
nedy later said, "Being a university
president isa rough business. I always
have to play the tough guy. It's nice
to play the good guy for once."
Graduate Student Association
president Dirk Van Compernolle,
treasurer Eric Berg and Council of
Presidents member Jim McGrath
were summoned to Kennedy's office
only a short time before the an
nouncement and were visibly
stunned. But amazement soon gave
way to back-slapping as the three ap
plauded the decision which will give
graduate students a place in the over
all residence draw for the first time in
University history.
Pandemonium reigned as the
three congratulated one another on
the successful bid to increase r r 'i
ate student housing options though
Berg admitted modestly, "I never in
my wildest dreams expected such a
breakthrough in University bureau
cracy. It was a total bombshell," he
said of the decision.
