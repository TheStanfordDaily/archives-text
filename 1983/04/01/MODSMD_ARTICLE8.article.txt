The School of Humanities and Sci
ences will begin overseeing the cur
riculum of the Athletic Department
on Sept. 1, Provost Albert Hastorf
told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
The move, based on the recom
mendations of an ad hoc committee,
is designed to reduce the isolation of
the Department of Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation-from other
academic departments, said Pamela
Strathairn, associate director of the
Athletic Department's Division of
Educational Programs.
Because the Athletic Department
is not currently affiliated with any
University school, communication
between it and other academic de
partments is limited, Strathairn said.
"On a university campus there are
certain lines of communication
which go on among people, and
those who have direct affiliation with
academic departments have those
lines of communication. We have an
academic program within this de
partment, but administratively we
are not associated with any of the
schools, which are the academic
components of a university,"
Strathairn said.
Registrar Sally Mahoney, who
headed the ad hoc committee, said
the recommendation comes partly
because atthistimethereisnoforum
for discussing standards for credit
and grading or for comparing athletic
department courses with classes
from other areas.
"The division's isolation di
minishes the University's ability to
see the full continuum of courses,
among them physical education ac
tivity courses, which the faculty have
decided can play only a limited role
in student completion of the bac
calaureate degree," Mahoney ex
plained.
Mahoney's committee has rec
ommended that Humanities and Sci
ences Dean Norman Wessells ap
point a committee, including at least
two faculty members from outside

MAKING A POINT: Robert Mozley asks the Faculty Senate to form a committee which would study
weapons-related research here during a meeting yesterday. Mozley's request for the committee, which was
approved by the senate, was prompted in part by a recent proposal for nuclear weapons-related research at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory.
the Athletic Department, to oversee
its curriculum.
Strathairn said that this committee
would oversee "every single class we
have listed in the Time Schedule,"
except intramural and recreational
classes where no instruction is pro
vided.

The committee also recom
mended that athletic classes gener
ally be graded on a pass/no credit
basis, and that new limitations be es
tablished "beyond those now in
place on the use of physical educa
tion courses in support of Stanford
baccalaureate degrees," Hastorf
said.
Currently students may use 12
units of physical education credit
toward their undergraduate degrees.
Strathairn said that although no new
limit has been set, the matter is
"under consideration."
The committee, which included
Education Dean Myron Atkin, Asst.
Provost Cecilia Burciaga, and Profs,
lack Friedenthal, law, Michael Kirst,
education, and Richard Thompson,
human biology and psychology, has
also recommended that the Athletic
Department's academic staff adopt
the titles of lecturer and senior lec
turer in keeping with the rest of the
University academic staff.
Hastorf suggested that Wessells,
Stathairn and Athletic Director Andy
Geiger review the recommendations
sometime after September 1.
In a memo to Strathairn and
Geiger, Hastorf said he believes the

change for the Athletic Department
"holds promise of added value for
our overall educational objectives.
"We think the promise is there in
large part because of the quiet and
effective attention you and your col
leagues have paid to the quality of a
curriculum that serves a wide variety
of undergraduates and the profes
sional training of a small number of
others," Hastorf said.
