# Fac/Sen to study weapons research
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH 
Senior staff writer
The Faculty Senate passed with lit
tle opposition yesterday a resolution
that asks the senate's Committee on
Research to study the volume and
character of weapons-related re
search here.
The resolution was prompted in
part by a proposal at the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL) which would aid research for
space-based Antiballistic Missiles
(ABMs). It asks the committee to de
liver a preliminary report sometime
this quarter.
The proposal, introduced by
Physics Prof. Robert Mozley, only
asks the committee to study
weapons-related research, and is
therefore not a formal protest. But it
represents a heightened concern
among faculty and staff members
about the nature of research here.
He said he introduced the resolu
tion because of fears that if the Uni
versity becomes too involved with
military research it may be liable to
governmental pressure.
Mozley said the issue is "very divi
sive." He said he has the "complete
support of about half of the SLAC
(Stanford Linear Accelerator Center)
faculty and a considerable number of
the staff."
In his opening remarks, Mozley
said "a slight move toward avoidance

of work with a clear direct military
mission might be desirable to pre
vent Stanford from becoming too
deeply involved in military re
search."
Mozley also referred to the Reagan
administration's interest in increas
ing research on space-based ABMs
and said this "makes clear the
pressures of funding availability
which may move University research
programs in a weapons-related
direction."
The University may be more liable
to government pressures when
weapons research is invQlved. At
some level such involvement could
change the character of students and
staff attracted to Stanford," he said.
The resolution was passed by a
mixed voice vote so a tally of the dis
senting senators was not kept. A few
did vote "nay" on the proposal and
many raised questions about its
wording. Mozley eventually drop
ped a clause which would ask the
committee to study "criteria relating
to end-use" because many senators
said studies of end-use for research
projects would excessively compli
cate the issue.
After the meeting Mozley con
ceded that determining end-use is a
problem because "you can't tell
what's going to happen in 10 years"
to a project.
Despite the fact that the resolution
only asks the committee the study
weapons-related research, Econom
ics Prof. Kenneth Arrow said he has
reservations about the resolution
because he "wouldn't want it to be
construed that this (the researc) is a
significant problem. It's not a prob
lem that needs ratification."
German Prof. Gerald Gillespie said
the amount of weapons-related re
search is not now a problem.

"If two-thirds of our research were
weapons-related it would be a prob
lem," Gillespie said. "The amount
we have is not a problem now."
Gillespie also pointed out that re
search at SSRL would be completely
open. The University prohibits clas
sified research.
Electrical Engineering Prof, lames
Meindl, the chairman of the Commit
tee on Research, said it will take a
year to complete the requested
study. Other senators said the com
mittee's crowded schedule will make

it difficult to complete the prelimi
nary study this quarter.
Fifteen faculty and 280 staff mem
bers of SLAC have signed petitions
opposing the proposal which would
aid in research of space-based ABMs
at SSRL. SLAC Director Wolfgang
Panofsky answered the staff petition
earlier this week by stating that SLAC
would "cooperate fully" with the
proposal if it is approved by Arther
Bienenstock, the director of SSRL.
University President Donald Ken
nedy said at the meeting that he will
discuss issues relating to SSRI at an
Academic Council meeting today.
