# Fac/Sen to study weapons research

The Faculty Senate passed with lit
tle opposition yesterday a resolution
that asks the senate's Committee on
Research to study the volume and
character of weapons-related re
search here.
The resolution was prompted in
part by a proposal at the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL) which would aid research for
space-based Antiballistic Missiles
(ABMs). It asks the committee to de
liver a preliminary report sometime
this quarter.
The proposal, introduced by
Physics Prof. Robert Mozley, only
asks the committee to study
weapons-related research, and is
therefore not a formal protest. But it
represents a heightened concern
among faculty and staff members
about the nature of research here.
He said he introduced the resolu
tion because of fears that if the Uni
versity becomes too involved with
military research it may be liable to
governmental pressure.
Mozley said the issue is "very divi
sive." He said he has the "complete
support of about half of the SLAC
(Stanford Linear Accelerator Center)
faculty and a considerable number of
the staff."
In his opening remarks, Mozley
said "a slight move toward avoidance

of work with a clear direct military
mission might be desirable to pre
vent Stanford from becoming too
deeply involved in military re
search."
Mozley also referred to the Reagan
administration's interest in increas
ing research on space-based ABMs
and said this "makes clear the
pressures of funding availability
which may move University research
programs in a weapons-related
direction."
The University may be more liable
to government pressures when
weapons research is invQlved. At
some level such involvement could
change the character of students and
staff attracted to Stanford," he said.
The resolution was passed by a
mixed voice vote so a tally of the dis
senting senators was not kept. A few
did vote "nay" on the proposal and
many raised questions about its
wording. Mozley eventually drop
ped a clause which would ask the
committee to study "criteria relating
to end-use" because many senators
said studies of end-use for research
projects would excessively compli
cate the issue.
After the meeting Mozley con
ceded that determining end-use is a
problem because "you can't tell
what's going to happen in 10 years"
to a project.
