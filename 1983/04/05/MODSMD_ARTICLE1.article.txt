## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Industrial Engineering Prof. Henry
Riggs will assume the post of vice
president for development on July
15, President Donald Kennedy an
nounced Friday. Riggs will replace
acting vice-president Bruce Hin
chliffe, who will become associate
vice-president of development.

Until then, Hinchliffe will continue
working as acting vice-president for
the Office of Development, a posi
tion he has held since Joel Smith re
signed the vice-presidency last June
after a long medical absence.
Vice-Provost Ray Bacchetti, vice

chair of the search committee that
recommended Riggs, said that Riggs,
together with Hinchliffe, "will make a
terrific team, the best team in univer
sity fund-raising today."
The two will head the Office of De
velopment, which handles all Uni
versity fundraising and provides a
major source of revenue for the Uni
versity.
Riggs, a veteran Silicon Valley en
trepreneur, has headed the Depart
ment of Industrial Engineering and
Engineering Management here since
1980. Currently on sabbatical leave in
Japan, he will return to campus later
this month and assume the vice
presidency on July 15.
Asst. to the Vice-Provost John
Hughes, who worked as staff for the
search committee, said that Hin
chliffe was in the running for the
permanent vice-presidency "until
the very end." Although neither he
nor Bacchetti anticipates any prob
lems between Riggs and Hinchliffe,
Hughes said the relationship be
tween the two may be "something
they'll have to work through."
He explained that the committee
selected Riggs over about 100 other
candidates because it was "looking
for someone with significant experi
ence in a major research institution."
Hughes said Riggs was especially
qualified for the post because he
"knows a tremendous amount about
