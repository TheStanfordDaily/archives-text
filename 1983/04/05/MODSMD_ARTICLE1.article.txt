# Riggs to fill VP post
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Industrial Engineering Prof. Henry
Riggs will assume the post of vice
president for development on July
15, President Donald Kennedy an
nounced Friday. Riggs will replace
acting vice-president Bruce Hin
chliffe, who will become associate
vice-president of development.

Until then, Hinchliffe will continue
working as acting vice-president for
the Office of Development, a posi
tion he has held since Joel Smith re
signed the vice-presidency last June
after a long medical absence.
Vice-Provost Ray Bacchetti, vice

chair of the search committee that
recommended Riggs, said that Riggs,
together with Hinchliffe, "will make a
terrific team, the best team in univer
sity fund-raising today."
The two will head the Office of De
velopment, which handles all Uni
versity fundraising and provides a
major source of revenue for the Uni
versity.
Riggs, a veteran Silicon Valley en
trepreneur, has headed the Depart
ment of Industrial Engineering and
Engineering Management here since
1980. Currently on sabbatical leave in
Japan, he will return to campus later
this month and assume the vice
presidency on July 15.
Asst. to the Vice-Provost John
Hughes, who worked as staff for the
search committee, said that Hin
chliffe was in the running for the
permanent vice-presidency "until
the very end." Although neither he
nor Bacchetti anticipates any prob
lems between Riggs and Hinchliffe,
Hughes said the relationship be
tween the two may be "something
they'll have to work through."
He explained that the committee
selected Riggs over about 100 other
candidates because it was "looking
for someone with significant experi
ence in a major research institution."
Hughes said Riggs was especially
qualified for the post because he
"knows a tremendous amount about


Harry Riggs
the University through his work here
and his academic strength meshes
nicely with the parts of the University
that are going to be doing fund
raising, such as the Engineering De
partment and all the sciences."
Bacchetti said Riggs has "marvel
ous qualities. He has managerial ex
perience and will provide closer links
to faculty."
Riggs' work in Silicon Valley in
dustries should give him "pheno
menal success" in fund-raising in
that area, Hughes said.
Kennedy said that together Riggs
and Hinchliffe "will provide a strong
faculty imprint and imaginative, ef
fective leadership in fund-raising and
management for the University."
Bacchetti said it should come as no
surprise that after a national search,
the committee selected someone
from Stanford. "It is our policy when
filling major positions to search for
candidates from here and from
abroad. We selected someone who
is both from here and abroad right
now," Bacchetti said.
Hinchliffe told the Daily late last
year that Smith's long medical ab
sence before his resignation from
the vice-presidency caused some in
stability in the office. "During the

interim period when he was absent
and there wasn't anyone in the as
signment, I think there was some
loss of momentum," Hinchliffe said.
Hughes predicted that, until Riggs
takes over in July, there will still be
some instability and "a little wonder
ing about the direction in the de
partment."
Bacchetti disagreed, claiming that
there never was any instability in the
Development Office. "I don't think it
existed and therefore it's not over.
Work has kept on and enthusiasm
has kept on. They're experienced
people there who know their busi
ness," he said.
Both Riggs and Hinchliffe received
bachelor's degrees here in 1957.
Riggs went on to earn an M B.A. at
Harvard with high distinction in 1960.
He worked as a process engineer at
Ampex and as an industrial
economist at Stanford Research In
stitute before helping to begin
ICORE Industries in 1963. In the late
'60s, while president of ICORE, Riggs
taught an 8 a.m. class here three
times a week.
From 1970t0 1974, he served simul
taneously as vice-president for fi
nance to the Measurex Corporation
and as a consulting professor at Stan
ford. He became an adjunct profes
sor in 1976 and a full professor in
1980.
