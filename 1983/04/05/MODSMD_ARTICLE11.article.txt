# Optimal health and fitness
## 300 students make commitment 
### JULIE HAGEN 
This spring at Stanford
nearly 300 students enrolled
in a four unit physical edu
cation class called Optimal
Health and Fitness have ac
cepted Jack Martin's chal
lenge to improve their per
sonal health.
Anyone who expects this
class to be a four unit rnick is
in for a big surprise. The
course entails a weekly 2Vi
hour lecture, two fitness
sections, a health seminar,
requires four textbooks,
five quizzes, participation in
either the Stanford Chal
lenge (a multi-event race
held annually) or the Health
Faire, and perhaps most dif
ficult, a commitment to
changing personal be
haviors and habits in a per
manent way.
The course approaches
the matter of fitness com
prehensively, including
conditioning of the mind as
well as the body. Students
combine the traditional
academic learning proce
dures (textbooks, lectures)
with actual behavior
changes. Optimal Health
and Fitness was designed by
Martin, a graduate student
in the School of Education,
five years ago, initially to
improve his own personal
health.
Martin said there was a
need for a class which
would combine "both the
academic and the practical
aspects" of fitness.
Although the course has
been successful and popu
lar since the first time it was
offered, there have been
criticisms in the past that it
was too impersonal. In an
effort to correct this, this
year's course includes 20
teaching assistants,
selected by Martin, who will
each lead a section of 15 to
20 students, helping and
encouraging them to meet
their personal goals.
Since Martin said that
the involvement of students

in the development of any
course is helpful and rele
vant, these T.A.s had a lot to
say about the format of this
year's course. During
winter quarter T.A.s under
went the fitness tests in
cluded in the course, re
viewed the readings and
helped select lecturers. Ac
cording to Martin they pro
vided invaluable insight be
cause, "they know what
they, and other students,
want to get out of it" more
than any faculty member or
instructor.
The lecture part of the
class will include speakers
on various aspects of fit
ness, including nutrition,
stress management, the
prevention of cancer and
heart disease, and particular
student issues, such as al
cohol and drug abuse.
Fitness sections begin
with a fitness assessment
test which includes flexibil
ity and endurance tests, and
the measuring of percent
age body fat for each stu
dent. T.A. Nicole Rosen
berg claimed that although
she had initial fears of these
tests being viewed as in
timidating or embarrassing
by students, the atmos
phere on the test day was
"warm and supportive,"

with everyone encouraging
each other. Based on the re
sults of these tests, students
then set personal goals
which they hope to attain by
the end of the course. Fit
ness sections continue
twice a week, including ac
tivities such as ultimate fris
bee, innertube waterpolo
and jazzaerobics. These fit
ness sections will be
graduated for ability
differences, including an
advanced section for those
already in good shape.
Weekly health seminars
conducted by T.A.s are de
signed not only to ensure
that students understand
lectures and readings, but
to provide a kind of "sup
port system," according to
Martin, where students can
help each other to meet
their goals. For instance,
said Martin, if you want to
lose 10 pounds, but you are
doing it all by yourself, you
might have a bad day and
say, "Oh, forget it." But if
you have 10 people doing it
with you, you're more likely
to receive the support
necessary to be successful.
In addition to exercising
regularly, students are
asked to modify their diet in
one of four specific ways,
and keep a journal, record
ing each day's successes or

defeats. These journals are
turned in periodically to the
T.A.s.
Whether or not your per
sonal goals in the class bring
you to actual "optimal"
health physically, it is hoped
the course will make you
health and fitness conscious
for your whole life, stated
Rosenberg. You'll come out
optimally fit mentally, and
"that's the beauty of the
whole course."
Rosenberg said she en
joyed being a T.A. because
it gives one "a chance to
spread personal convictions
about what is healthy and
important."
At the end of the course
fitness assessment tests are
repeated, and nearly all stu
dents show great improve
ment. "Their lives are
changed by it, so I get a lot
of reward for it out of it,"
Martin said. Despite the
academic requirements of
the course, Martin never
loses sight of the idea that it
should be an enjoyable ex
perience for students, men
tally and physically. "It's
fun!" he insisted, and stu
dents agree. "It's not only
fun, but it makes you feel
good about yourself, and
what you're doing," one
student said.
