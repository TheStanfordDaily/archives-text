## The 						Stanford Daily Minority recruitment 
### 
Like the dean of graduate studies, the Faculty
Senate and, we assume, the University commu
nity as a whole, we were disturbed by the find
ings of the latest study on minority graduate
student enrollment. According to the study, en
rollment of minorities in graduate programs fell
42 percent last fall despite intensive recruiting
efforts and the work of three assistant deans
charged specifically with the responsibility of
strengthening the affirmative action program.
Although we do not question University ded
ication to the principles of affirmative action,
we wonder if the strategy which it has chosen to
follow is as effective as it could be. The program
at Stanford and at similar institutions seems
more akin to Pac-10 athletic recruiting than to
anything which will produce truly "affirmative"
results. As it now stands, energetic affirmative
action programs at top-notch graduate schools
across the country have led to stepped up com
petition between the schools for the same
group of highly qualified students while failing
to impact significantly the total number of
minority graduate students.
The reasons for the nation-wide decline in
minority enrollment last year, as well as a re
ported increase in the number of minority
applicants to graduate schools this year, are un
clear to Keith Naylor, assistant dean of the
Graduate Division, and to us as well. What is
clear is that whatever recruiting activity is going
on is apparently not a primary factor in the de
termination of the trend's direction.
Whether the determining factors be eco
nomic, sociological or some combination of the

two, it seems that effective affirmative action
programing will have to follow a far-sighted ap
proach emphasizing cooperation between uni
versities in efforts designed to significantly in
crease the number of minority students pre
pared to enter graduate school.
Work in this area could begin as early as sec
ondary school when students with particular
interests and abilities could be identified, con
tacted and encouraged in cooperation with un
dergraduate affirmative action programs. Con
cerned faculty members in the student's par
ticular area of interest might even be assigned to
follow the student's progress and offer
academic assistance and counseling.
Another goal, perhaps national in scope, is
related to the quality of public education, par
ticularly in geographical areas where minority
populations are concentrated. The damage
which has been done to the public education
system by simple-minded budget-cutters will
not be easily or quickly reversed. Such a rever
sal, however, would most likely increase signifi
cantly the number of minority undergraduate
and graduate students.
The University has been careful to emphasize
the fact that its program is not to blame for the
severe decline in minority enrollment. Indeed,
it seems to us that this is the case. Unfortu
nately, we believe that this year's projected in
crease in minority graduate student enrollment
is also not significantly related to the Universi
ty's program. Hopefully, we will soon be able to
say otherwise.
