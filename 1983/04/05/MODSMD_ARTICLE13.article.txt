# Save the Speaker's Bureau
## 
### 
In an election, whether it be at the high
school or national level, there are certain pro
cedures and rules to which candidates must
adhere. The Speakers Bureau was denied a spot
on the ASSU fee assessment ballot because a
procedural requirement was not fulfilled.
To earn a place on the fee assessment ballot, a
group that has been given approval by the ASSU
Senate, as had the Speakers Bureau, must get 10
percent of the student body to sign a petition
supporting the group's place on the ballot and
also file a declaration of intent form. The latter is
an official statement indicating the intention to
run and agreement to follow the campaign prac
tices code and rules set by the election commis
sion.
The Speakers Bureau collected the necessary
signatures, but through an unfortunate mix-up,
did not file a declaration of intent.
Election commissioner Craig Spearman can
not be criticized for his decision to keep the
Speakers Bureau off of the ballot; rules are
made for a purpose and they are made to be
followed. It is a shame, however, that a techni

cality has prevented a worthwhile organization
from the opportunity to gain funds from the
students, who in the past have given strong
support to the Speakers Bureau.
While we do not criticize the senate for trying
to circumvent past errors and do not blame
them for the Speakers Bureau's oversight, they
must be aware that the election system is now
more complicated and they must bear the re
sponsibility of informing each potential candi
date about specific regulations. We hope that
next year a simple, explicit document of rules
and regulations will be produced and circu
lated.
And as for the fate of the Speakers Bureau, we
hope a miracle can be produced somewhere so
that the efforts of its members will not seem
futile. We urge the ASSU to provide them with
an association fee — a funding option reserved
for small groups — and hope that maybe the
senators can pull something out of their bag of
tricks which will make it possible for the
Speakers Bureau to continue bringing speakers
to campus next year.
