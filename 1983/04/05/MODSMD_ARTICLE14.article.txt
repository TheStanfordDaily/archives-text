# Athletes avoid opportunities
## 
### 
There are three types of student
athletes at Stanford. First, those who
have the ability to excel in a sport,
pursue a challenging curriculum of
studies, interact with other students
and engage in all sorts of other ac
tivities. These students live on Mt.
Olympus or thereabouts. Second,
we have those who consider learning
and the achievement of a marketable
degree the main reasons for being
here. For them there is the world of
second and third string backup posi
tions and the usual: "you could be an
outstanding athlete if you just
wanted it bad enough" said by the
coach. The third type of athlete is
represented by those individuals
who consider sports as the most sig
nificant part of their Stanford experi
ence. For them, training and compe
tition come first. Courses and
academic pursuits are stimulating
and worthy of one's best efforts so
long as they do not disrupt athletic
endeavors.
One might assume from this
categorization that students of the
first type are the star athletes who
don't know what a B looks like. The
ones of the second type, the dangl
ing jocks who get good grades and
pursue tougn uegrees. And the ones

of the third type the stereotypical
jocks who really don't care about
classes, majors or graduating for that
matter.
Well, that would be only partially
correct. Although no individual fits
neatly into any one particular cate
gory, I am sure that everyone has at
least a vague notion of where they
belong.
My intention here is not to de
nounce and condemn the increasing
level of competition, stress and time
commitment that has fostered this
categorization, as so many jour
nalists and educators have already
more eloquently done. Rather, I
would like to offer some thoughts on
how to avoid this categorization and
deal with a few of the unique chal
lenges facing student-athletes.
First, always make an effort to di
versify your friendships outside of
the circle of teammates and/or other
athletes. If not you'll find that your
athletic activity becomes suffocating
to you and those around you. Sec
ond, leave behind, or better yet, get
rid of the often not so subtle sense of
superiority with which you deal with
your non-athlete peers. Feel proud
of your accomplishments without

making those around you aware of
their non-accomplishments. Third,
remember that the primary purpose
for attending Stanford is to get an
education. An education implies
much more than a degree. I am re
ferring to, what Dean of Under
graduate Studies Herant Katchadou
rian so elegantly articulated in Ap
proaching Stanford as . . the seri
ous attempt to engage in intellectual
discourse, to the study of the first
principles and all that follows from
them, no matter what your field . . .
and to do this within as broad a spec
trum as possible. . .
This leads to my fourth and final
point. Give your best to a sport but
don't forego the other challenges,
equally stimulating and demanding,
that this campus offers. Whereas par
ticipation in intercollegiate competi
tion is obviously only a one-time op
portunity, you'll be surprised to dis
cover that being able to study, inter
act with other students or maybe go
overseas are not life-time opportuni
ties either.
