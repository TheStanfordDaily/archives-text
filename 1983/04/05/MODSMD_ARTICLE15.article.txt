## Stanford shouldn't subsidize non-registrants 
### 
I disagree with Stanford's decision
to provide existing private funds for
non-registrants who have been de
nied federal funds. This effectively
subsidizes defiance of the Solomon
Amendment, a provision in the De
fense Authorization Act which de
nies federal financial aid to students
who have not registered for the draft.
By refusing to register, young men
declare opposition to the law of a
nation which may call upon their ser
vices in times of national emergency.
These people are thus in a poor posi
tion to say that the same government

should come to their assistance with
money loans for school fees. Stan
ford is teaching that a person's en
joyment of society's generosity does
not entail an obligation to obey the
law.
President Donald Kennedy's ob
jections to the Solomon Amendment
ring hollow. Kennedy claims that the
law discriminates on the basis of
wealth But federal aid is principally a
subsidy for the middle and upper
middle classes. A student from a fam
ily with an income of $60,000 can be
eligible. I suggest that Kennedy

might worry about the fairness of a
young blue collar worker who com
plies with the draft-registration law
only to see his tax dollars subsidize
college education for a privileged
few who will not comply.
Kennedy also claims that the law
places a "huge administrative bur
den" on Stanford. I find it difficult to
believe that asking an applicant for
the letter he receives from the Selec
tive Service System is intolerable.
Even still, isn't Kennedy being selec
tive in his objections? Doesn't the
University act as an enforcement

agent for "affirmative action" re
quirements on behalf of the gov
ernment?
Stanford lacks the courage to do
something that is unpopular with an
outspoken and spoiled minority. In
stead, Stanford should teach that to
enjoy one of society's privileges, one
must be willing to shoulder an equal
level of responsibility.
