## Gov't holds reins on research 
### 
It comes as no surprise (Daily,
March 30) that SLAC, at the behest of
its director, will "cooperate fully"
with nuclear weapons-related work
that has been proposed to be done at
the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL): no surprise, be
cause the institutional structure of
science in the United States allowed
no other possibility. In a contest be
tween expediency and moral cour
age, the former had to win. As one
SLAC staff member recently re
marked to me, "No one in the SLAC
directorate or the University admin
istration is going to take the moral
high ground on this issue." Let's ex
plore why this is the situation.
The vast expansion of the scien
tific enterprise in the United States
after the Second World War is essen
tially due to the injection of large
amounts of federal funds. The major
ity of such funding (at present, about
60 percent), has always come from
military and related branches of the
government, such as the Depart
ment of Energy (SLACs patron),
which is in charge of all nuclear
weapons research. Of great signifi
cance is the attitude that managers of
military research offices actively
promote among funding applicants:
lust worry about doing your work
competently; let us worry about ap
plications. Not surprisingly, this at
titude has become dominant among
those on the military dole, for a
number of reasons that include the
following:
1) It allows the researcher to avoid
making ethical choices that might af
fect his career;
2) It is the attitude held by the rest
of the "old boy" network of
academic and governmental scien
tific elites;
3) It provides a shield against critics
saying "but I only do unclassified,
basic research!"
Projects funded by the military
often look highly attractive. Funding
levels are high, so the best, most up
to-date equipment is available to re
searchers. The opportunity to inter
act with many highly competent sci
entists beckons particularly at the
various national laboratories. Many
projects do not appear to be directly
linked to any weapons system, in

case some workers might have pangs
of conscience. But all is not quite so
rosy.
The level of military funding of re
search is so extraordinarily high that
entire fields of study can be made or
broken, depending on the decisions
made in the Pentagon. For re
searchers to maintain that their
choice of research topics is not influ
enced by the military funding offices
is absurd. Scientists in pursuit of
grant money tailor their proposals
according to the desires and pre
judices of the funding agency. If one
seeks funds from the Pentagon,
those prejudices usually reflect pol
icy decisions about weapons systems
to be developed. The link between
weaponry development and the in
dividual researcher is inextricable,
whether or not the researcher ac
knowledges it.

The level of military funding of research is so
extraordinarily high that entire fields of study can
be made or broken, depending on the decisions
made in the Pentagon.

Workers who have been drawn
into the military funding web have a
vested interest in maintaining the
status quo. Because this status quo is
based largely upon a bipolar world
view, acceptance of this view be
comes a convenient way of justifying
one's actions. If one accepts the idea
that "the Russians" are out to over
whelm us, then working on military
projects becomes not merely ac
ceptable, but indeed a duty. The role
of scientists from the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory (LLL) is a prime
example of this phenomenon.
A large number of LLL's directors
made the rounds of this state last au
tumn, campaigning against the nu
clear freeze referendum. Scary
stories about the "Soviet threat"
were a part of their stock-in-trade.
One wonders if these people were
subconsciously more concerned
about their jobs, status and
mortgages should LLL slow its opera
tions, than about the "Sovietthreat."
Commentors in the United States
often fault the USSR for the way in
which scientific enterprises in that

country have become so centralized
and tied into the military establish
ment. Is the "American way" really
that much better, if funding choices
push many people into military re
search; if moral and ethical consid
erations become buried under the
imperative of chasing grant money?
A recent incident at Stanford
(Campus Report, March 9) vividly il
lustrates the rank hypocrisy of in
stitutional attitudes toward military
research. Stanford has a policy that
faculty can do on-campus work on
military contracts only if the work can
be published in the open literature;
in official jargon, this means "unclas
sified." Even for these projects,
however, the Department of De
fense (DoD) compiles brief descrip
tions of the military relevance; these
compilations are known as Technical
Abstract Bulletins (TABs), and were

available from the engineering li
brary. However, when Peter
Hochchild, a giad student in com
puter science, asked to see the TABs,
librarian Celine Walker refused, in
stead sending the TABs back to the
DoD, which promptly classified
them. Other attempts by Hochchild
to get the information on military re
levance of Stanford research were
blocked by the library and petty
harassment by the DoD. Hochchild
eventually gave up his search.
It seems that the TABs—listed in
the library index as unclassified—are
available to public scrutiny only as
long as nobody wants to look at
them. Stanford's much-vaunted pol
icy about "no classified work on
campus" is essentially meaningless:
a fraud. At least the librarian who
obstructed Hochchild's efforts had
the honesty to recognize this fraud
for what it is; do the people doing
the "unclassified research? Or are
they all too busy scrambling to write
the next DoD grant proposal?
