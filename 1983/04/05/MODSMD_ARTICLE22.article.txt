# Interfacing with hackers: lingo the new 'mode'
## 
### RICK BOECk 
"My girlfriend and I aren't
interfacing very well," a
Stanford student tells his
professor as an excuse for a
late paper. Another under
graduate demands "access"
to his girlfriend on Saturday
night.
Stili another considers
skipping His biology lab.
"I'm |ust not in a learning
mode today," he explains.
Bit by bit, Ihe |argon as
sociated with computers —
otherwise known as com
puterbabble or comput
ereze — is creeping into the
language where it is certain
to separate people into two
groups: computer wizards
and computer illiterates.
Already these terms have
slipped into the mouths of
computer users, and, like
the creature in the movie
Alien spawned offspring
larger and more hideous
than themselves. "Inter
face," the common bound
ary between data process
ing systems or parts of sys
tems, led to parallel inter
face, interface management
and interface bus address.
And input and output have
produced throughput and
offputting, leading one lan
guage purist to remark,
"These words make me
want to upstand and out
v\alk."
But Mark Crispm, an as
sistant programmer witri
Stanford's SCORE com
puter Mcility, defends most
of the terminology. ' There
are concepts that come up
in the science that are not
described by any English
term."
So, to explain the strange
new parts and functions of
computers, computer man
agers, computer science
students and marketing
firms have stretched and
twisted words, given some
ruw meanings, assigned
others new roles or just in
vented ppw terms.
Prefixes and -uft'ixes are
added to words to form
mult'taxing digitalization
and i computerizing Com
pounds include downtime,
software, symbolic input
output referencing and
logitundmal parity checks.
fo simplify this language
inflation, computer mana
g( rs I.ave devised entire lex
icons of acronyms. CAL,
DAM and VAB, tor example,
describe such baffling func
tions as conversational
algt braic memory, descrip
tor attribute matrix or voice
answer back. And old words
are given n«-w meanings as
in "vanilla,' 1 a bland pro

gram or computer, and
"volatile," a program that
can be easily destroyed.
But computereze is most
distinguished by its free
dom from conventional
grammar. Words can be
used as any part of speech
and often are.
"There is no word that
can't be verbed or adver
halized," says Crispin, a
graduate ot the University's
computer science depart
ment. He offers examples
such as to format, to access
and to archive, traditionally
nouns now used as verbs by
the computer literate.
This new jargon has also
inspired a new selection of
sexual innuendos.
"Why don't you come up
and see my output?" a Stan
ford undergrad asked a re
sistant co-ed. Peripherals, a
term for equipment at
tached to computers, has
suggested several anatomi
cal analogies. And at LOTS,
Stanford's Low Overhead
Timesharing facility, a

"The other day
when it was
raining, a friend
suggested we go
out and take a look
at the land water
interface. He was
joking, or at least I
think he was."

monogamus relationship is
described as "frozen ac
cess" but "shared access" is
another matter altogether.
Computer wizards at
LOTS have found this tech
nical jargon inadequate to
describe the depth of their
experience with computers.
So along with the "Hackers"
— the current synonym for
computer wizards— at MIT,
thev have invented an entire
lexicon of computer slang.
Called the ' Hacker s dictio
nary" and available tin the
LOIS Bulletin Board, this
computer print-out lists
such terms as:
Crash: 1. n. A sudden,
usually drastic failure. Most
often said of the system,
sometimes said of magnetic
disk drives. "Three losers
lost their files in last night's
disk crash." 2. v. To fail sud
denly. "Has the system just
crashed? Sometimes said of
people."
Crufty: adj. Poorly built,
possibly overly complex.
Frobinicate: v. To manip

ulate or adjust, to tweak.
Hacker: (originally
someone who makes furni
ture with an axe) n. A person
who enjoys learning the de
tails of programming sys
tems and how to stretch
their capabilities, as op
posed to most users, who
prefer to learn only the
minimum necessary.
MUNC: (recursive ac
ronym for Mung Until No
Good) v. To destroy, usually
accidentally, occasionally
maliciously.
User: n. A programmer
who will believe anything
you tell them. One who asks
questions. Identified at MIT
with "loser" by the spelling
luser.
Win: v. To succeed. A
program wins if no unex
pected conditions arrive.
The dictionary has a
number of terms for disgust
including "bletcherous"
and "foo." "Grody" was
even a hacker term, says
Crispin, until the Valley girls
adopted it. "Slang is rather
incentous," says Crispin. "It
passes around from one
group to another like
herpes."
But one term of disgust
that Stanford's hackers will
not take credit for is "user
friendly," the brain child of
some marketing specialist.
"They're the ones re
sponsible for human
engineered, user
designable and system,"
says Crispin.
A marketing expert with a
local computer firm dis
agrees: "We're really down
to earth with people." But a
brochure for the firm's
latest computer discusses
the computer's enhanciabil
ity, expandibility and
software transportability.
Geoffrey Nunberg, an as
sistant professor of linguis
tics and usage editor for the
American Heritage Dictio
nary. sees nothing wrong
with the new terminology
' New technology has al
ways introduced new words
and phrases into thr lan
guage," he explained
"'Getting in gear and
'Coming in on a wing and a
prayer' are examples of ear
lier developments that have
influenced English. Most of
today's computer terms will
experience a brief vogue,
then die out.

Hacker: (originally
someone who makes furni
ture with an axe) n. A person
who enjoys learning the de
tails of programming sys
tems and how to stretch
their capabilities, as op
posed to most users, who
prefer to learn only the
minimum necessary.
MUNC: (recursive ac
ronym for Mung Until No
Good) v. To destroy, usually
accidentally, occasionally
maliciously.
User: n. A programmer
who will believe anything
you tell them. One who asks
questions. Identified at MIT
with "loser" by the spelling
luser.
Win: v. To succeed. A
program wins if no unex
pected conditions arrive.
The dictionary has a
number of terms for disgust
including "bletcherous"
and "foo." "Grody" was
even a hacker term, says
Crispin, until the Valley girls
adopted it. "Slang is rather
incentous," says Crispin. "It
passes around from one
group to another like
herpes."
But one term of disgust
that Stanford's hackers will
not take credit for is "user
friendly," the brain child of
some marketing specialist.
"They're the ones re
sponsible for human
engineered, user
designable and system,"
says Crispin.
A marketing expert with a
local computer firm dis
agrees: "We're really down
to earth with people." But a
brochure for the firm's
latest computer discusses
the computer's enhanciabil
ity, expandibility and
software transportability.

"'Getting in gear and
'Coming in on a wing and a

"But it won't hurt the lan

suggested we go out and
take a look at the land-water

at least I think he was."
"My girlfriend and I aren't

Stanford student tells his

Bit by bit, Ihe |argon as

to separate people into two
groups: computer wizards
and computer illiterates.
Already these terms have
slipped into the mouths of
computer users, and, like
the creature in the movie
Alien spawned offspring
larger and more hideous
than themselves. "Inter

and interface bus address.

Stanford's SCORE com

of the terminology. ' There
are concepts that come up
in the science that are not
described by any English
term."
So, to explain the strange
new parts and functions of
computers, computer man
agers, computer science
students and marketing
firms have stretched and
twisted words, given some

are given n«-w meanings as

can be easily destroyed.
But computereze is most
distinguished by its free
dom from conventional
grammar. Words can be
used as any part of speech
and often are.
"There is no word that
can't be verbed or adver

such as to format, to access

nouns now used as verbs by
the computer literate.
