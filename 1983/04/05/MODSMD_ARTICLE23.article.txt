# Majority favors electronic paper
## 
### ROSE RAGSDALE 
Although most have only a
vague idea about what the ser
vice could offer, many Stan
ford students are looking for
ward to the day when news and
information will be delivered
via computers to American
homes.
A slim majority of students,
51 pen ent, prefer newspapers
as we know them today, but 40
percent of those polled in a
random survey reported they
would actually prefer to re
ceive their news from an elec
tronic newspaper.
"If I could afford it, I'd prefer
the electronic newspaper be
cause of the convenience of
access to different things," one
freshman respondent said.
However, for the majority,
the traditional print media's
appeal outweighed the elec
tronic newspaper's potential
for convenience and versatil
ity.
Some 9 percent of the stu
dents said they would prefer a
combination of the print and
electronic services.
"I'd like the electronic
newspaper every day but I
would still like to get the Sun
day paper to read leisurely,"
observed a freshman from
Minnesota.
Despite the reluctance of a
majority of the students inter
viewed to give up the tradi
tional newspaper, 42 percent
felt that the widespread access
to computerized data banks
will eventually displace the
print media as a major source
of news and information.
Not surprisingly, the belief
that newspapers will be dis
placed is strongest among stu
dents who expressed a prefer
ence for an electronic newspa
per. Of these, 77 percent be
lieve that computerized sys
tems will replace newspapers.
In addition, twice as many
humanities majors preferred
print newspapers as compared
to science majors who split
evenly in preference between
electronic newspapers and
traditional ones.
Of those students who pre
ferred electronic newspapers,
73 percent a r e ma'ie and of
those students who preferred
newspapers btf percent were
female Women favored
newspaper two to one ov^r
electronic newspapers, <#s
compared with men who were
divided evenly on the ques
tion.
lohn McCarthy, Stanford
computer science professor
and pioneer in artificial intelli
gence, said there are popular
misconceptions about the po
tential of electronic newspa
pers. Having acquired a vid
eotext news service program in
1972 as part of SAIL (Stanford
Artificial Intelligence Labora
tory), McCarthy has studied
the medium for more than 10
years.
In an academic paper pub

lished in 1972 on "The Home
Information Terminal,"
McCarthy outlined the advan
tages that a videotext service
offers.
"A common complaint
about newspapers from read
ers and reporters alike is their
shallowness/' he wrote. "This
comes from an editorial neces
sity of producing a general
interest package every day."
McCarthy said videotext will
permit a reporter specializing
in a country or topic to pro
duce long articles it he also
produces the short items for
the casual reader.
"A correspondent for The
New York Times in Constan
tinople will be able to fully
satisfy the fans of Byzantine
politics, and there needn't be
more than a few hundred of
them to pay his salary," he ob
served.
Stressing that the physical

production and distribution of
newspapers, magazines and
books would disappear with
videotext, McCarthy said much
smaller organizations would
be needed to produce the
same packages of text and pic
tures.
"Moreover, the user does
not face a one-shot decision to
buy Time or Newsweek,"
McCarthy wrote. "He will be
able to read the 'cover' or table
of contents of each, read such

items that strike his fancy, and
the system will bill him tor what
he reads from each source."
McCarthy also said the role
of a magazine would change.
They would become more like
organizations that put out lists
of material for its readers that it
has edited and recommends. A
wide variety of magazines with
different standards of writing
and editing and different

operating budgets will be eas
ily accessible to readers.
Citing advertisers' objec
tions to videotext systems,
McCarthy explained that the
nature of advertising will
change in that people will no
longer be forced to read adver
tisements.
"However, people will still
want to know what's for sale
and will still want to see the
seller's story about why they
should buy it,"he said. "Prob
ably, Time magazine will still
get money from advertisers
because many people will still
want to know what is adver
tised in Time."
Bill Paisley, associate profes
sor of Communication in the
Institute for Communication
Research here, agreed with
McCarthy's view of advertis
ing's future in videotext ser
vices.

"The typical advertising for
mat in newspapers went
through an evolution to get
whf>re it is today and I believe
that a similar evolution will oc
cur" in videotext services, Pais
ley predicted.
He said the technology
necessary to install videotext
systems in American homes is
inexpensive and accessible.
"These systems are inher

ently cheap because they only
need a microcomputer at their
hub to function efficiently," he
explained. "A microcomputer
costs about $5000."
Paisley said such a system
could be easily accessed
through telephone lines and
one only needs a small per
sonal computer like the Com
modore Vic-20 ($lBO retail), a
television screen, and a
MODEM ($lOO retail) which
translates telephone signals
into computer signals to use
them.
"A peculiar aspect of vid
eotext systems is that they just
appear as part of grassroots ef
forts," Paisley said. "Many
community organizations are
sponsoring their own elec
tronic bulletin boards like the
Living Videotext System in
Menlo Park and Communities
in San Francisco."

He said these individual de
velopments are \V»at v\d
eotext systems are definitely
coming in the near future and
that the real threshold of com
puter use will come when de
coders are automatically built
into television sets.
Several large news organiza
tions such as The Times Mirror
Company which publishes the
Los Angeles Times, Knight-
Ridder which publishes the
San lose Mercury-Mews and
McClatchy Papers which pub
lishes the Sacramento Bee, are
currently offering videotext
services on an experimental
basis.

Several large news organiza
tions such as The Times Mirror
Company which publishes the
Los Angeles Times, Knight-
Ridder which publishes the
San lose Mercury-Mews and
McClatchy Papers which pub
lishes the Sacramento Bee, are
currently offering videotext
services on an experimental
basis.

Although most have only a
vague idea about what the ser
vice could offer, many Stan
ford students are looking for
ward to the day when news and
information will be delivered
via computers to American
homes.
A slim majority of students,
51 pen ent, prefer newspapers
as we know them today, but 40
percent of those polled in a
random survey reported they
would actually prefer to re
ceive their news from an elec
tronic newspaper.
"If I could afford it, I'd prefer
the electronic newspaper be
cause of the convenience of
access to different things," one
freshman respondent said.
However, for the majority,
the traditional print media's
appeal outweighed the elec
tronic newspaper's potential
for convenience and versatil
ity.
Some 9 percent of the stu
dents said they would prefer a
combination of the print and
electronic services.
"I'd like the electronic
newspaper every day but I
would still like to get the Sun
day paper to read leisurely,"
observed a freshman from
Minnesota.
Despite the reluctance of a
majority of the students inter
viewed to give up the tradi
tional newspaper, 42 percent
felt that the widespread access
to computerized data banks
will eventually displace the
print media as a major source
of news and information.
Not surprisingly, the belief
that newspapers will be dis
placed is strongest among stu
dents who expressed a prefer
ence for an electronic newspa
per. Of these, 77 percent be
lieve that computerized sys
tems will replace newspapers.
In addition, twice as many
humanities majors preferred
print newspapers as compared
to science majors who split
evenly in preference between
electronic newspapers and
traditional ones.
Of those students who pre
ferred electronic newspapers,
73 percent a r e ma'ie and of
those students who preferred
newspapers btf percent were
female Women favored
newspaper two to one ov^r
electronic newspapers, <#s
compared with men who were
divided evenly on the ques
tion.
lohn McCarthy, Stanford
computer science professor
and pioneer in artificial intelli
gence, said there are popular
misconceptions about the po
tential of electronic newspa
pers. Having acquired a vid
eotext news service program in
1972 as part of SAIL (Stanford
Artificial Intelligence Labora
tory), McCarthy has studied
the medium for more than 10
years.
In an academic paper pub

lished in 1972 on "The Home
Information Terminal,"
McCarthy outlined the advan
tages that a videotext service
offers.
"A common complaint
about newspapers from read
ers and reporters alike is their
shallowness/' he wrote. "This
comes from an editorial neces
sity of producing a general
interest package every day."
McCarthy said videotext will
permit a reporter specializing
in a country or topic to pro
duce long articles it he also
produces the short items for
the casual reader.
"A correspondent for The
New York Times in Constan
tinople will be able to fully
satisfy the fans of Byzantine
politics, and there needn't be
more than a few hundred of
them to pay his salary," he ob
served.
Stressing that the physical

production and distribution of
newspapers, magazines and
books would disappear with
videotext, McCarthy said much
smaller organizations would
be needed to produce the
same packages of text and pic
tures.
"Moreover, the user does
not face a one-shot decision to
buy Time or Newsweek,"
McCarthy wrote. "He will be
able to read the 'cover' or table
of contents of each, read such

items that strike his fancy, and
the system will bill him tor what
he reads from each source."
McCarthy also said the role
of a magazine would change.
They would become more like
organizations that put out lists
of material for its readers that it
has edited and recommends. A
wide variety of magazines with
different standards of writing
and editing and different

operating budgets will be eas
ily accessible to readers.
Citing advertisers' objec
tions to videotext systems,
McCarthy explained that the
nature of advertising will
change in that people will no
longer be forced to read adver
tisements.
"However, people will still
want to know what's for sale
and will still want to see the
seller's story about why they
should buy it,"he said. "Prob
ably, Time magazine will still
get money from advertisers
because many people will still
want to know what is adver
tised in Time."
Bill Paisley, associate profes
sor of Communication in the
Institute for Communication
Research here, agreed with
McCarthy's view of advertis
ing's future in videotext ser
vices.

"The typical advertising for
mat in newspapers went
through an evolution to get
whf>re it is today and I believe
that a similar evolution will oc
cur" in videotext services, Pais
ley predicted.
He said the technology
necessary to install videotext
systems in American homes is
inexpensive and accessible.
"These systems are inher

ently cheap because they only
need a microcomputer at their
hub to function efficiently," he
explained. "A microcomputer
costs about $5000."
Paisley said such a system
could be easily accessed
through telephone lines and
one only needs a small per
sonal computer like the Com
modore Vic-20 ($lBO retail), a
television screen, and a
MODEM ($lOO retail) which
translates telephone signals
into computer signals to use
them.
"A peculiar aspect of vid
eotext systems is that they just
appear as part of grassroots ef
forts," Paisley said. "Many
community organizations are
sponsoring their own elec
tronic bulletin boards like the
Living Videotext System in
Menlo Park and Communities
in San Francisco."
