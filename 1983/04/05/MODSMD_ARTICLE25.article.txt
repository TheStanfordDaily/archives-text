# Students prepare for the computer revolution
## Computer may have won battle of man and machine 
### KAREN DACHEY 
Stanford students can see
the computer revolution com
ing — and they're ready for it.
A survey of 529 students
conducted winter quarter by a
graduate class in precision
journalism found that the vast
majority of them had used
computers and welcomed
their burgeoning role in to
day's brave new world.
"Perhaps this is our third re
volution," said economics
major Kurt Wollenhaupt. "First
there was the pen and pencil,
(then) the printing press, and
now we have computers. I wel
come them. It's an excellent
tool to be using."
More than three-fourths of
the students questioned were
confident that they'd have the
skills to adapt to the computer
revolution. Although only 39
percent of them used comput
ers during the week before the
survey, 83 percent had used
them at some stage in their
lives. The average weekly time
spent with computers was 3.7
hours and the most
frequently cited reason for
using them was class work.
But even when Stanford stu
dents are not required to use
computers for course work,
those who have computer
skills are often keen to keep
them up-to-date.
"I'm not taking any courses
this quarter which specifically
require the use of a com
puter," said Kurt Wollenhaupt.
"However, I use LOTS ... to
keep my computer skills at an
appropriate level."
That so many students had at
some time used computers did
not surprise Stuart Reges, as
sistant to the chairman of Stan
ford's Computer Science De
partment.
"That's the way it's going to
be anywhere five years from
now," he said. "And Stanford
students are smart enough to
know that."
Reges added that "money is
not incidental." The over
whelming majority of students
surveyed — 83 percent — came
from families whose annual

household income was above
the U.S. median at the time
they left home for college. As
Reges noted, "There are a lot
of students at Stanford who
can afford to own their own
computers."
Patricia Box, assistant di
rector of the Instruction and
Research Information Systems
division at Stanford's Center
for Information Technology
(CIT), suggested another con
tributing factor.
"I .think there is probably
more use in high schools now
adays," she said. "Freshmen
are coming in having used a
computer a little bit in school."
But Box was surprised at the
high number of students who
claimed to have used comput
ers.
"I guess I would have put the
figure at 70 or 75 percent," she
said. "I suspect that some of
the students who make up this
83 percent have done only a
very small amount of comput
ing. They may have used LOTS
for just one quarter or some
thing like that."
In fact, LOTS — the Universi
ty's Low Overhead Time-
Sharing Facility — had been
used by 62 percent of all the
students surveyed. CIT had
been used by 19 percent.
Recognizing the increasingly
important role played by com
puters in society, more than
two-thirds of the students felt
that everyone should know
how to use them.
"I think it's important for
people to understand some
thing about computers be
cause they're becoming so
prevalent in society," said
Susan Johnson, a student in
the computer science depart
ment.
Tyler Ochoa, a senior in
economics and communica
tion, predicted that computers
would become the new com
munication medium.
"Computers are going to be

the method that everybody
uses to talk to everybody else,"
he said. "The role now is es
sentially massive amounts of
information storage and
transmission. It's going to in
crease."
And David Hoffer, an unde
clared sophomore, said he felt
that it wouldn't be long before
Americans find themselves liv
ing in "a micro-chip world.
"I think that computers are
very important," Hoffer said.
"I don't know exactly what
they do because I haven't
studied them, but I do think it's
important to understand
exactly how crucial they are
going to be."
Of those students who had
never used computers, 84 per
cent said they planned to use
them before they graduate.

Some, like history major Claire
McNulty, indicted that today's
technological society leaves
them little choice.
"I do intend to learn how to
use computers — it's unrealis
tic not to," she said. "I'd learn
as an efficiency move. I have
no burning desire."
lason Cole, a political sci
ence and communication
major, was also motivated
more by pragmatism than pas
sionate interest. A would-be
journalist, Cole said that he will
probably have to learn how to
use a video display terminal.
Many students, like Cole,
reported that they had faced
up to the future and ap
preciated the importance of
computers in today's job mar
ket. Nearly everyone agreed
that learning how to use com

puters gives people marketa
ble skills.
"I want to be literate — com
puter literate," said law stu
dent Rachel Bagby. "I want my
skills to be marketable. I want
to command the best price for
my dollar."
Some students, however,
were worried that heavy com
puter use could kill certain
basic skills. Curtis Norton, a
senior undergraduate in
physics, suggested that people
could become unnecessarily
dependent on computers.
"People could possibly lose
capabilities in areas like math
and reading skills," Horton
said.
Vet many respondents con
sidered computerization a
boon to creativity. Fewer than
one-quarter of them disagreed
with the proposition that com
puters will help individuals to
be more creative.
"It (the computer) has the
potential to be just like a pen
and pad to a writer — and the
brush and palate to the artist,"
said Stephen Bell, a graduate
studying computer science.
Similarly, Mark Webster — a
22-year-old graduate student in
aeronautics and astronautics
— noted that technology can
take care of mundane tasks.
"It enables man to be more
creative and implement his
ideas more quickly," he said.
Other students pointed out
that computers increase pro
ductivity and efficiency. They
can even help cops catch crim
inals, said Claude lohnson — a
graduate student in mechan
ical engineering.
"Without computers, we'd
be back in the days of Bonnie
and Clyde and Dillinger," he
said.
Only a quarter of the stu
dents surveyed feared that
computers will make our soci
ety too technical. And just 23
percent — more than half of
them women and more than
three-quarters of them under
graduates — confessed that
they felt intimidated by com
puters.

A minority of just over one
third of the students believed
that computers will have a de
humanizing effect on society.
This opinion was held by two
thirds of the graduate students
and by more than half the
women surveyed.
"I just hope that people
won't let machinery become
masters," said a female
graduate student in the School
of Education.
Claude Johnson agreed:
"You don't want to have a
computer as your boss. It
could be that computers will
control the world and make
theirown computers. We have
robots that make other robots
now — on automated assembly
lines."
Keith Kim, a sophomore un
dergraduate in economics and
international relations, was
also leery of the growing role
of computers in society.
"I think that society is losing
a personal touch," he said. "It
seems like we're getting domi
nated by the computer."
But the bulk of students sur
veyed stressed the potential
benefits of computers for soci
ety in general.
At least one humanities
course at Stanford is actually
taught by computer. Each
quarter, 100 students enrolled
in Philosophy 57 learn the
rules of logic from a computer
screen. The only time they
formally meet a flesh-and
blood teacher is at an introduc
tory session. From then on,
they are on their own — in
front of terminals connected to
a large main frame
DECSYSTFM-10.
"Course material is pre
sented on the screen," said
Bjorn Strand, a research assis
tant at the Institute for Mathe
matical Studies in the Social
Sciences. "Students get ques
tions on the material and learn
how to do programs."
Strand explained that stu
dents are evaluated on the
basis of how many lessons they
cover. To pass the five-unit
course, they spend an average
of seven hours a week using
the computer.
"Students don't have to have
had any previous experience,"
Strand said. "In fact, the
course is recommended for
people who are scared of com
puters."
Such courses may do much
to break down any lingering
hostility toward the computer.
But according to the Computer
Science Department's Reges,
the University should make
greater efforts to encourage
widespread computer use.
"Looking at the University as
a whole, we're not particularly
innovative in the level or kind
of support that we provide to
our students," Reges said.
"The University doesn't con
sider computing to be an im
portant resource in the same
sense that it regards its libraries
as being an important re

source. It doesn't perceive
computing as being something
special."
Reges was especially critical
of the University's narrow
views on the application of
computer use.
"You wouldn't turn off limits
people's access to books for
pleasure," he said. "And ye!
here you can't get free alloca
tion on any computer for non
academic work. There is no
free word processing except at
LOTS, where it's very limited."
But Reges applauded his
own department's track record
in computing development.
"Looking at the computer
science and electrical en
gineering departments, we're
extremely innovative," he said.
"There are a lot of exciting
things going on and we have
the most modern equipment.
We are on the cutting edge in
terms of facilities."
Two of the most innovative
development fields in which
Stanford is involved are Very
Large Systems Integration and
computer networking.
"There is a very large net
working project which we
think is about to start," Reges
said. "And if we aren't already
at the cutting edge in terms of
development, that will put us
there."
Stanford's location in the
heart of Silicon Valley has
clearly been an important fac
tor in pushingthe University to
the forefront of computer re
search.
"In terms of developing
hardware, it definitely makes a
difference that we're part of
the Silicon Valley environ
ment," Reges said.
"There's a lot of interaction
between Silicon Valley and the
University," he added.
"People in the industry come
here to give talks. And comput
ing is an important part of the
Stanford Instructional TV Net
work."
Local industry gets gifted
graduates from Stanford; and
the University gets gifts.
"We're very important for
Silicon Valley because it can at
tract better employees by tel
ling them they can takecourses
in computer science at Stan
ford," Reges said. "I think it's
probably oneof the reasons we
get so many gifts."
The University's computer
science department was re
cently ranked top nationally.
Graduate applications this year
leaped from 559 to 691 — much
more than double the number
five years ago.
Across the board, it seems
that Stanford attracts students
who are attracted to comput
ers. The survey indicates that,
in all departments, students
are eagerly preparing them
selves for their future in a
computer age.
Such confidence should
stand them in good stead if —
as some technological deter
minists maintain — the only
choice which history does not
make for us is that between op
timism and pessimism.
