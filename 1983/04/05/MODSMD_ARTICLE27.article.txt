# Conservative publications debated
## 
### First in a two-part series By FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
The newest "underground"
student publication at the Uni
versity of California at San
Diego was started almost two
years ago by a student who felt
his controversial political views
were not being fairly repre
sented on campus. Since its
beginnings, it has sparked
much controversy among stu
dents and faculty of UCSD—so
much so that its staffers have
been threatened with bodily
harm and students have
threatened to boycott its ad
vertisers. The publication is
printed off-campus and with
out any financial support from
the university or from student
organizations. In fact, much of
its funding comes from corpo
rate donations and local Re
publican groups
The publication, The
California Review, is one of a
growing number of conserva
tive student publications ap
pearing on campuses across
the country. Though varied in
size and format and aimed at
student audiences as diverse as
those of Dartmouth and UC-
Berkeley, each was published

with the same general pur
pose: to provide an alternative
to what their founders con
sider to be a liberal bias on
their respective campuses.
According to Paul Davies 111,
a member of the Stanford Con
servative Political Alliance and
co-founder of the three-year
old Stanford Review (not af
filiated with The California Re
view), he and several friends
decided to start the review in
order to "inspire thought on
campus" and to provide a bal
ance to what they considered a
"one-sided approach to every
thing" at Stanford.
The Stanford Review, unlike
the UCSD paper, receives its
funding from alumni and indi
vidual students on campus.
John Wierzbicki, editor of
UC-Berkeley's fledgling con
servative newspaper, The Ber
keley Review, which will pub
lish its first issue in April, ex
pressed similar sentiments. He
said that he and other Berkeley
conservatives "didn't like the
news sources we were getting
at Berkeley." He cited as an
example The Daily Californian,
which he said "most consider a
liberal paper." He empha
sized, however, that The Ber

keley Review is "not in direct
competition" with The Daily
Californian.
Michael Ciraolo, a city editor
for The Daily Californian, how
ever, denied that the paper
adhered to a particularly liberal
stance. The role of The Daily
Californian, he said, is that of
"reporting the news on cam
pus," not of propagating a par
ticular political viewpoint. The
paper's editorials, Ciraolo said,
are not centered around any
particular political ideology.
The issues covered by the
three conservative papers—
and their more liberal
counterparts —are the same.
Concerns about feminism, af
firmative action and ROTC in
stallations on campus are
common to all of the publica
tions, even though their views
toward the different issues and
their ways of expressing them
differ. The conservative
Dartmouth Review, for exam
ple, gained national attention
from such tactics as publishing
a list of names of gay students
on campus and printing an ar
ticle written in what was sup
posed to resemble "Black En
glish."
California Review Editor Eric

Young defended the legiti
macy of such actions. He cited
an incident involving his own
paper, in which the comment
"Women are women, men are
men, and homosexuals are a
phylum unto themselves" ap
peared in one of its articles and
was strongly protested by
UCSD students. Young said
the comment was meant to be
humorous and the protests
only occurred because the
more liberal students were
"uptight" and insecure in their
own position.
Such actions, however, are
not universally admired by
conservatives. Stanford senior
Tim Hanigan, who has worked
with the Stanford Review for
three years deplores their tac
tics. "They're really biting," he
said of the Dartmouth publica
tion. He added that The Stan
ford Review does not use such
tactics to gain attention.
"We don't want to cram it
down people's throats," he
said.
Davies also emphasized the
The Stanford Review is not as
sociated with The Dartmouth
Review.
