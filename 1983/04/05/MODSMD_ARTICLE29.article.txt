## A 						lot of punch left in powerful "Great White Hope" 
### MARK FAJER 
â– froward the end of the Pulitzer-prize win
ning play, "The Great White Hope," the
main character lack leffprson, tells a story

about a boxing match at a fair that he took
part in when he was very young. The ring
was backed by a canvas sheet, and whenever
he started doing too well in the match, the

grizzled pro would push him against the
canvas and someone in back would hit him
over the head with a stick. Each time he got
up and kept fighting. Jefferson, based on
World Heavyweight champ Jack Johnson,
spends his career and his life being hit over
the head in a white man's world, and getting
up to keep fighting. In a powerful Theat
re Works production which opened Satur
day night, Anthony Haney gives an extraor
dinary performance, showing us a man
reacting to prejudice and fear with grit,
humor, anger, and often, a devastating
smile.
Director Robert Kelley has done an excel
lent job in putting together this huge pro
duction. Thirty-seven performers give life to
the powerful emotions evoked by the pre
sence of a black champion of the world. The
play flows smoothly from one wrenching
scene to the next, aided by Bruce McLeod's
clever set pieces which float in and out as we
move from boxing ring to courtroom; from
Chicago to Belgrade. With a couple of ex
ceptions, the ensemble is up to their difficult
assignments, and almost every scene grabs
the audience with a new presentation of the
varied and terrible effects of prejudice.
To begin with, there is Haney. He domi
nates the stage as long as he is on it, which is
mostof theevening. Heshnwsthe prideand
determination of the character when insist
ing that the white woman that he loves stay
with him despite the pleas of his managers
and the problems that the relationship en
genders. He shows humor in a variety of
places. At his first title fight, the band stops
playing when he enters to weigh-in. He asks
ironically, with a grin, "How come they's no
music when I comes in?" After the reigning
(white) champ is shown to be heavier, he
flashes his winning smile and comments on
being "lighter" than his opponent. Later,
when a group of temperance fighters appear
outside his Chicago club, he brings them
seats and offers them drinks.
Carol Alexander, as the white woman,
Eleanor Bachman, is the weakest link in the
production. She has a coupie of good scenes
including a touching bedroom sequence
with Haney, where his tenderness brings out
genuine laughter and love that makes us un
derstand why he loves her. In the less happy
scenes in the play she is not as good. She is
not strong enough in her interrogation by

the Chicago police (who are trying desper
ately to find an excuse to arrest the champ).
In the second act, when they flee the U.S.
and live, increasingly badly, in Europe and
Mexico, Jefferson and Ellie begin to fight. In
these emotionally charged scenes, she is no
match for Haney, and her lack of strength
undercuts the powerful emotional build-up
that he presents. Thus, his ultimate decision
to go back and fight because of what hap
pens to her loses much of its bite.
Keith Bentley, as Jack's manager Goldie, is
often funny, and shows a clever understand
ing of both the businessman's mind and of
the nature of the society that Jefferson is
trying to fight in. His Jewish accent, unfortu
nately, comes and goes, and this detracts
from a lot of what he says. Gail Gholson as
Jefferson's black ex-girlfriend, Clara, whirls
around the stage, storming and wheedling
trying to get back with the champ. Gholson
beautifully captures the energy of the role,
as well as the bitterness at being thrown over
for a white woman. Viera Whye is superb as
Jefferson's mother, praying for him on the
one hand, while castigating herself for ruin
ing him by not beating him enough on the
other. Gregory Wright as Jefferson's trainer,
Marv Solomon as a federal agent, Brent
Davis as a Hungarian entrepreneur, and
Myles Patrick as a British official also give
notable performances.
There are two undercurrents that Kelley
brings out very well in this production. The
first is the nature of the white prejudice, and
the second is the way in which the other
blacks relate to the champion. The intoler
ance shown by the whites throughout the
play is especially frightening to watch be
cause it is not often loud or nasty or violent.
It is usually shown as basic, unthinking and
perfectly natural to the white characters.
Lee Carrau, who is very good as an ex
champ still involved in the business, is con
stantly making statements that show this
type of everyday ordinary ingrained pre
judice. A British matron who
wants to throw Jefferson and Eleanor
cut of England is frightening for the series
of perfectly natural" moral judgments she
makes about the inter-racial couple. In
America, this "natural view of the world"
leads the police to trump up a charge against
Jefferson because they are afraid of what his
public image will lead other blacks to do.

As a constant counterpoint to white pre
judice, Kelley presents us with images of
black servility and of the difficulty of defin
ing Jefferson's role within the black com
munity. Many blacks want him to win badly
for the race, but he points out that it they
don't have self-respect before a tight, his
winning won't give it to them. There is
another point of view, expressed by Rob
Robinson, who is often on stage as a sort of
omnipresent black conscience. Blacks
should not try to get ahead in a white world,
but instead create worlds of their own. In
two passages he accosts the audience di
rectly, castigating the blacks for sitting
among the whites, for swimming in the
"whitewash," and for measuring themselves
by how white they are. He is superb, and the
effect is disturbing and frightening.
The direction, which in general does very
well at bringing out the powerful emotions
and ideas of the play, falters occasionally.
Kelley indulges a bit too much in having
characters talk directly to the audience. This
causes these moments to lose some punch,
and sometimes interferes with the flow of
the show. The climactic fight scene at the
end of the show is a bit clumsy as well. There
is too much going on, and we don't know
who to listen to. The important events in the
ring are lost to us until the end of the scene,
and this is very frustrating, especially at the
end of such a fine show.
Despite the flaws, "The Great White
Hope" pounds at the audience like a ham
mer, or perhaps a right cross, demanding
our attention, straining our emotions, and
provoking our minds. Perhaps the best
scene in the show is one in which Jefferson,
Eleanor and the trainer, Tick, are forced, for
lack of money, to perform a scene from
Uncle Tom's Cabin in a burlesque house in
Budapest. As Haney and Alexander spit out
the words of the scene, we can see the pain
and humiliation that they are undergoing.
While the incongruity of the world champ
ion boxer prancing around in a silly wig is
hysterical at times, the scene was one of the
most painful that I have ever witnessed in
the theater. "The Great White Hope ' will be
performed April 8, 9 and 13 through 1b at the
Lucie Stern Community Center in Palo Alto.
It is an amazing theatrical experience, high
lighted by Anthony Haney's superb per
formance.
