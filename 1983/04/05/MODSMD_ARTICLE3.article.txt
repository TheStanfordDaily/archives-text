# Kennedy on SSRL: will not interfere

### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
Despite the fact that there are "a
variety of reason to be uncomforta
ble about weapons research," Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
told the Academic Council Friday
that he will not attempt to interfere
with a controversial proposal at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lab
oratory (SSRL).
Pointing out that past University
policies "foresaw that today's benign
restriction might become tomor
row's suffocation," Kennedy said he
does not "plan to try to change the
University's policy on research in
order to eliminate this proposed
program, nor do I think that my col
leagues should wish to do so."
Opponents of the proposal, which
would aid research for nuclear
weapons-pumped x-ray lasers, a type
of space-based Antiballistic Missile
(ABM), had indicated before Ken
nedy's speech that they did not ex
pect him to try to stop the proposal.
Nonetheless, the announcement
does indicate tacit approval of the
proposal on the basis of academic
freedom.
Kennedy's statement pointed out
that "principles" were behind his

decision. He stressed the wisdom of
past University decisions concerning
research restrictions which said
"once you begin making value
judgments about the possible out
comes of scientific work, there is no
place to stop.''
He said the University "placed (its)
faith in the ultimate net benefit of
free inquiry," despite the fact that
research may benefit causes with
which it doesn't sympathize."
Arthur Bienenstock, the director
of SSRL, who will make the ultimate
decision whether or not to accept the
proposal, has used similar language
to describe the resultant dilemma.
He said that he has historically been
skeptical about research with mili
tary applications. Yet he also consid
ers himself a champion of academic
freedom.
In a Daily interview yesterday,
Kennedy said his speech was not a
political statement meant to sway
opinion but instead a policy descrip
tion. He also said he had emphasized
that he would not attempt to inter
fere with the final decision because
"we have historically in this univer
sity laid a lot of stress on the faculty
making research policy."
