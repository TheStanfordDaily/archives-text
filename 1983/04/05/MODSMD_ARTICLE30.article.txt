# The 						Who without the Face-Townsend runs amuck
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
I: To begin on a derogatory
note, this "solo' double al
bum, Scoop, by Pete
Townshend of the Who, is not
for everyone. It is an album
thpt consists of demo tapes of
songs that Townshend re
corded singlehandedly over
the years. They are the "solo"
versions of Songs by which
Townshend presented the
Who with his ideas as to how
the songs should be recorded.
Therefore, one hears the origi
nal demos of Who classics
(such as "Magic Bus"), along
with other songs that the Who
declined to release. This
means that one is not getting
"new," vital music in a
minimalistic vein (as
Spri ngsteen's solo LP, Ne
braska, was). Because of this,
thc> album's worth and content
should not even interest any
Casual listener of rock and roll.
The definitive versions of all
the Who demos on this album
are performed in all their
splendor arid power on the var
ious Who LPs, and
Townshend's other solo works
\ (especially 1980s Empty Class)
fare far superior as a whole as
112 well. However, any diehard
I Who fan or any true believer in
rock and roll and its history,
' should be able to appreciate
and comprehend what this
album is all about. Scoop is not
an album to be listened to
lightly. Instead, it is an album
that needs to be studied.
Basically, the album contains
material that Townshend de
scribes, in his extensive liner
notes, as being "made for my

amusement, for film sound
tracks, for experimentation
purposes, or to submit mate
rial to the Who." Musically,
these demos range from in
sightful beginnings of Who
songs (such as the pure deli
cacy of "Behind Blue Eyes") to
mid-'6os forays into
psychedelia (as in "Melan
cholia"), to even jazz guitar
workouts (as in "To Barney
Kessell"). Not to be thought of

as being back-dated,
Townshend includes some
New Wave ventures. Unfortu
nately, the majority of these
New Wave influenced num
bers are pretentious, self
indulgent, and quite excessive.
Townshend usually fares badly
here because these demos lack
any lead guitar work and con
sist mostly of colorless synthe
sizer and electronic doodlings.
In addition, the lyrics to these

newer demos are his attempts
at what he calls "fused
streamed poetry with straight
lyrics," and he fails miserably.
The lyrics detract considerably
from the melodies (especially
on "Body Language" and
"Zelda"), and it is no wonder
that these songs never got re
leased previously.
However, when Townshend
is on, he is as passionate, emo
tional, honest and humorous

as ever. All of the demos of
Who songs are fine examples
of Townshend's inherent mus
ical genius. The demos of
"Bargain" (off 1971s Who's
Next) and "Love Reign O'er
Me" (off 1973s Quadrophenia)
are just as complicated and yet
as beautifully simple as the re
leased versions. What is even
more noteworthy is that the
very intricate, layered sound
effects found on the Who ver

sions were originally produced
by Townshend's meticulous
overdubbings done in his
''home'' studio. Even
Townshend revels in his con
summate production of these
demos by saying, "I still think
that . . . (these are) our best
sounding Who albums be
cause the demos for the record
were so good."
The most interesting demos
of a Who song, though, are
"Squeezebox" and "Magic
Bus." On the former, an ac
cordian is the lead instrument,
making it even more of a
"poorly aimed dirty joke," as
Townshend is apt to describe
it. On the latter, though, one is
given a "one-man band ver
sion, a voodoo-dub-freak-out
of a nothing song." Unlike the
Who's comical version of
"Magic Bus" though, here the
song has a much more forceful
Bo Diddley beat (much like the
sensual "Mona" by Bo
Diddley), thus enabling it to
take on a sexually frustrated
confusion.
Elsewhere on the album, one
finds some unreleased gems.
The best ones attempt to copy
a specific musical form. For in
stance, there is a maximum
R&B number from 1967, called
"Politician," which is a direct
steal from Martha and the Van
della's Motown classic "Heat
wave." Then there is "Things
Have Changed" from 1965,
which is a rollicking acoustic
number that sounds as if it be
longs on the Beatles' Rubber
Soul album and "You Came
Back," which is a gorgeous

Carole King derived tune.
Overall, I'm still studying
over this album and it fasci
nates me even more with each
listening. However, I do have
some gripes with it. Some of
Townshend's selections are
questionable, especially when
he tells us he has "hundreds of
such demos." My biggest gripe
though, deals with the inclu
sion of only one unreleased
demo from the "Lifehouse"
project. Townshend's follow
up to Tommy was to be a con
cept album and film called
"Lifehouse." Though the orig
inal project became too com
plex and he discarded the idea,
the rejected songs from this
project comprised most of the
Who's finest work, Who's
Next. However, except for one
demo (called "Mary," which is
the finest unreleased demo on
Scoop), Townshend does not
give us any other glimpses into
this supposed masterwork.
Mostly, though, my personal
gripes are the gripes of a lis
tener who wants Who perfec
tion at all costs. However, it
was Townshend's plan to re
lease this album as it is, with
both good and bad included.
As he says,". . . It emerges as a
fine example of. . . music that
was never intended to be
heard. . . . The real job I get
from playing and writing
comes through and that joy is
something I want to share. . . .
This isn't meant to be a defini
tive collection(s); just a
scoop." And I, for one, cannot
hold any gripes against that.

Mostly, though, my personal
gripes are the gripes of a lis
tener who wants Who perfec
tion at all costs. However, it
was Townshend's plan to re
lease this album as it is, with
both good and bad included.
As he says,". . . It emerges as a
fine example of. . . music that
was never intended to be
heard. . . . The real job I get
from playing and writing
comes through and that joy is
something I want to share. . . .
This isn't meant to be a defini
tive collection(s); just a
scoop." And I, for one, cannot
hold any gripes against that.

I: To begin on a derogatory
note, this "solo' double al
bum, Scoop, by Pete
Townshend of the Who, is not
for everyone. It is an album
thpt consists of demo tapes of
songs that Townshend re
corded singlehandedly over
the years. They are the "solo"
versions of Songs by which
Townshend presented the
Who with his ideas as to how
the songs should be recorded.
Therefore, one hears the origi
nal demos of Who classics
(such as "Magic Bus"), along
with other songs that the Who
declined to release. This
means that one is not getting
"new," vital music in a
minimalistic vein (as
Spri ngsteen's solo LP, Ne
braska, was). Because of this,
thc> album's worth and content
should not even interest any
Casual listener of rock and roll.
The definitive versions of all
the Who demos on this album
are performed in all their
splendor arid power on the var
ious Who LPs, and
Townshend's other solo works
\ (especially 1980s Empty Class)
fare far superior as a whole as
112 well. However, any diehard
I Who fan or any true believer in
rock and roll and its history,
' should be able to appreciate
and comprehend what this
album is all about. Scoop is not
an album to be listened to
lightly. Instead, it is an album
that needs to be studied.
Basically, the album contains
material that Townshend de
scribes, in his extensive liner
notes, as being "made for my

amusement, for film sound
tracks, for experimentation
purposes, or to submit mate
rial to the Who." Musically,
these demos range from in
sightful beginnings of Who
songs (such as the pure deli
cacy of "Behind Blue Eyes") to
mid-'6os forays into
psychedelia (as in "Melan
cholia"), to even jazz guitar
workouts (as in "To Barney
Kessell"). Not to be thought of

as being back-dated,
Townshend includes some
New Wave ventures. Unfortu
nately, the majority of these
New Wave influenced num
bers are pretentious, self
indulgent, and quite excessive.
Townshend usually fares badly
here because these demos lack
any lead guitar work and con
sist mostly of colorless synthe
sizer and electronic doodlings.
In addition, the lyrics to these

newer demos are his attempts
at what he calls "fused
streamed poetry with straight
lyrics," and he fails miserably.
The lyrics detract considerably
from the melodies (especially
on "Body Language" and
"Zelda"), and it is no wonder
that these songs never got re
leased previously.
However, when Townshend
is on, he is as passionate, emo
tional, honest and humorous

as ever. All of the demos of
Who songs are fine examples
of Townshend's inherent mus
ical genius. The demos of
"Bargain" (off 1971s Who's
Next) and "Love Reign O'er
Me" (off 1973s Quadrophenia)
are just as complicated and yet
as beautifully simple as the re
leased versions. What is even
more noteworthy is that the
very intricate, layered sound
effects found on the Who ver

sions were originally produced
by Townshend's meticulous
overdubbings done in his
''home'' studio. Even
Townshend revels in his con
summate production of these
demos by saying, "I still think
that . . . (these are) our best
sounding Who albums be
cause the demos for the record
were so good."
The most interesting demos
of a Who song, though, are
"Squeezebox" and "Magic
Bus." On the former, an ac
cordian is the lead instrument,
making it even more of a
"poorly aimed dirty joke," as
Townshend is apt to describe
it. On the latter, though, one is
given a "one-man band ver
sion, a voodoo-dub-freak-out
of a nothing song." Unlike the
Who's comical version of
"Magic Bus" though, here the
song has a much more forceful
Bo Diddley beat (much like the
sensual "Mona" by Bo
Diddley), thus enabling it to
take on a sexually frustrated
confusion.
Elsewhere on the album, one
finds some unreleased gems.
The best ones attempt to copy
a specific musical form. For in
stance, there is a maximum
R&B number from 1967, called
"Politician," which is a direct
steal from Martha and the Van
della's Motown classic "Heat
wave." Then there is "Things
Have Changed" from 1965,
which is a rollicking acoustic
number that sounds as if it be
longs on the Beatles' Rubber
Soul album and "You Came
Back," which is a gorgeous

Carole King derived tune.
Overall, I'm still studying
over this album and it fasci
nates me even more with each
listening. However, I do have
some gripes with it. Some of
Townshend's selections are
questionable, especially when
he tells us he has "hundreds of
such demos." My biggest gripe
though, deals with the inclu
sion of only one unreleased
demo from the "Lifehouse"
project. Townshend's follow
up to Tommy was to be a con
cept album and film called
"Lifehouse." Though the orig
inal project became too com
plex and he discarded the idea,
the rejected songs from this
project comprised most of the
Who's finest work, Who's
Next. However, except for one
demo (called "Mary," which is
the finest unreleased demo on
Scoop), Townshend does not
give us any other glimpses into
this supposed masterwork.
Mostly, though, my personal
gripes are the gripes of a lis
tener who wants Who perfec
tion at all costs. However, it
