# Pack wins NCAA title
## Houston 'slama jamad' at buzzer by NC State 
### Washington Post 
Albuquerque, N.M. — North Carolina
State believed it could, even if nobody else
did. It wasn't just rhetoric: Sidney Lowe could
control the pace, Dereck Whittenburg could
shoot jumpers over anybody and State's long
distance shots would count just as much as
Houston's dunks.
So when Lorenzo Charles slammed Whit
tenburg's 32-foot air ball to kingdom come
with one second remaining last night, it was
North Carolina State that had the last laugh,
and the last jama.
That basket, at the end of a broken play,
gave North Carolina State a 54-52 NCAA
championship victory over heavily favored
Houston before 17,327 in delirious University
Arena. It was the only basket State scored
from within 15 feet the second half.
"I could see it," Charles said. "I was under
the rim, where you can always see whether
the ball is long or short. And I knew it was
short. I could see it so clear. The closest Hous
ton player to me was Akeem (Abdul) Ola
juwon. He was right there, but he didn't
jump. I don't know why. It feels good to beat
them with a jama, but to tell you the truth, it
feels good to beat them any way you can."
State Coach Jim Valvano had called time
with 44 seconds left and the score tied. After
Benny Anders barely missed a steal with less
than 10 seconds left, Whittenburg spun
around and shot an airball from beyond the
top of the key, but Charles was under the
basket for the easy dunk.
N.C. State became the first team to win the
national championship with double-digit
losses. State (26-10) won this title nine years
ago, but was favored by almost no one to
come close to a top-ranked Houston team
that had won 26 straight with a running,
flying, dunking attack.
There was little flying or dunking last night
for the Cougars (31-3). Houston's only dunk
was a tip-slam by Olajuwon with five minutes
left in the first half. Led by senior forward

Thurl Bailey, who scored all of his 15 points in
the first 20 minutes, the Wolfpack ignored
that and went on to a 33-25 lead at in
termission.
The Cougars scored the first 10 points of
the second half, and went on a 17-2 run to
take a 44-37 lead with eight minutes left
before N.C. State gathered itself for the final
run.
"So many times, we've been down 12
points, 10 points, eight points to teams like
Virginia and Maryland and North Carolina,
that trailing this time didn't make us panic,"
said State's Terry Gannon. "We just said if we
get behind, we'll foul them the rest of the
game."
Houston, shooting 61.1 percent from the
foul line, had to expect that strategy, but
couldn't do a thing about it.
Clyde Drexler made two free throws with
3:19 remaining that put the Cougars ahead,
52-46. But Lowe made a 24-footer for 52-48.
Houston's Michael Young then missed the
front end of a one-and-one situation with
2:52 that gave the Wolfpack life, and the ball.
Whittenburg, only six of 17 from the field,
made a 20-footer from the right side with 2:22
left for 52-50. Olajuwon missed his eighth
shot in 15 attempts — an eight-footer from
the left baseline.
Whittenburg pulled up for another 20-
footer, this one from the right side, arching it
just over the gargantuan arms of Olajuwon, a
7-footer. That tied the game at 52 with 1:57
left and set up some expected strategy.
Whittenburg fouled Alvin Franklin with
1:05 left. A 63.6 percent foul shooter, Franklin
missed the front of the one-and-one so badly
that three State players nearly lost the ball out
of bounds trying to grab the rebound. But
Cozell McQueen (12 rebounds) controlled
the ball.
Houston Coach Guy Lewis was fighting
mad in his postgame interview. "Everybody's
been predicting all season that we couldn't
win the NCAA title if we didn't hit our free
throws. And that's exactly what happened. "
