### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Santa Clara disrupted Stanford's 12-
game winning streak yesterday with a 7-4
win behind the five-hit pitching of Roger
Samuels.
The loss stopped Stanford, now 24-6
overall and 8-1 conference, two games
short of tying the school record for con
secutive wins.
Despite poor hitting, the Cardinal
trailed by only 4-3 going into the sixth in
ning, but second baseman Mark Cummins
broke the game open with a three-run
homer off reliever Kevin Kunkel.
Samuels, who went the distance for
Santa Clara, held Stanford to just two hits
in the final seven innings as the Bronco's

sailed to the win.
Mike Aldrete briefly gave Stanford a 1-0
lead with a solo home run in the first in
ning and Rick Lundblade followed that
with a one-run homer in the second, but
the Cardinal could muster only three more
hits and two runs off Samuels the rest of
the way.
Santa Clara rapped out 13 hits against
three Stanford pitchers. David Harris, now
2-2, was tagged with the loss. Jeff Ballard
pitched the final 2% innings of scoreless
relief for Stanford.
The Cardinal picked up two wins over
the Easter weekend before the loss to
Santa Clara.
Steve Cottrell upped his record to 6-1
Saturday as Stanford ripped St. Mary's 7-2.

Eric Hardgrave, Vince Sakowski, Mike
Dotterer and Greg Lorenzetti each rapped
out two hits to pace the Cardinal offense.
In a make-up game Friday, Stanford
bombed San Jose 9-2.
Brian Myers went all the way on the
mount to improve his record to 5-1. Myers
gave up only five hits and one earned run.
Sakowski and Dotterer both had two
hits for Stanford.
