### PETER CASTILLO 
The 14th annual Martin
Luther King |r. Games, featur
ing athletes from around the
nation and world, lived up to
its pre-meet hype as one high
school, seven meet and eight
stadium records fell.
"The most eloquent state
ment that can be made is that
so many records were broken
and that speaks louder than
anything I could say about the
meet," said meet organizer
and Stanford track coach
Brooks Johnson.
The first record that fell
Saturday was in the women's
javelin, as Tina Lillak of Fin
land, the former world record
holder, won with a toss of 218
feet.
The Finnish national team
almost did not make it to the
meet because their car broke
down and they later took the
wrong turn off from their train
ing camp in Santa Barbara.
Another Finnish athlete who
won was Juha Tiainen in the

hammer with a 243-foot-6.
In the men's javelin Mike
Barnett of Azuza Pacific broke a
20-year-old stadium record
with a toss of 286-foot-10.
The high jump pit saw a lot of
action, beginning with
Maurice Crumby of San Fran
cisco's Balboa High School.
Crumby bettered the national
prep record by a quarter of an
inch with a 7-foot-4'/ 2 jump.
Two hours later Coleen
Sommers of Club Adidas broke
her own meet and stadium re
cord with a leap of 6-foot-s'/2,
which is the best women's
outdoor jump in the world this
year.
A second 20-year-old
stadium record fell in the meet,
this time in the long jump pit,
as Gwen Loud of Hawaii leaped
21-foot-2. Sharifa Barksdale of
Tennessee set records in the
400 meter hurdles in a time of
58.9.
In the 800 meters, Robin
Campbell of the Stanford Track
Club and loetta Clark of Ten

nessee, two of the nation's
finest half-milers, battled head
to head for the first half of the
race. But in the last 400,
Campbell pulled away to break
her own stadium and meet re
cords in 2:02.7.
The Tennessee 4x400 relay
team of kathy Rattesy,
Barksdale, Keilar Bolton and
Clark set the best mark in the
world so far this year in a re
cord time of 3:35.8.
The women's shot put fea
tured some of the world's best
athletes, but it was a surprise
competitor who won. Marita
Walton of Maryland bested her
own personal record by four
feet with a shot of 55-foot-9.
Carol Cady of Stanford
finished fourth with a shot of
53-foot-2'/i.
Meg Ritchie of Great Britain,
who is currently attending
Arizona, won the discus with a
throw of 207-foot-3. Cady had
the third longest American dis
cus throw with a toss of 197-
foot-8.

Other Stanford athletes who
competed were Shaun Picker
ing, who finished fourth in the
hammer in 201-foot-1, and Bill
Graham who took fifth in the
5000 meters with a 13:55.9
clocking.
Stanford men's 4 x 400 relay
team finished fourth in 41.66.
The women's 4\BBo yard team
of jessica Spies, Alison Wiley,
PattiSue Plimer and Regina
lacobs finished second in
8:44.2.
The distance medley team of
lacobs, Marcia Martin. Plumer
and Wiley won in 11:18.9.
Jacobs ran the 880 in 2:07.9,
Martin the 440 in 55.6, Plumer
the 1320 in 3:30.8 and Wiley the
mile in 4:40.6.
"I am looking forward to
next year's meet, but the costs
have to be evaluated every year
because of the great ex
penses," said Johnson. "Hope
fully we can get a sponsor next
year."
Stanford faces USC at Ber
keley Saturday.

The 14th annual Martin
Luther King |r. Games, featur
ing athletes from around the
nation and world, lived up to
its pre-meet hype as one high
school, seven meet and eight
stadium records fell.
"The most eloquent state
ment that can be made is that
so many records were broken
and that speaks louder than
anything I could say about the
meet," said meet organizer
and Stanford track coach
Brooks Johnson.
The first record that fell
Saturday was in the women's
javelin, as Tina Lillak of Fin
land, the former world record
holder, won with a toss of 218
feet.
The Finnish national team
almost did not make it to the
meet because their car broke
down and they later took the
wrong turn off from their train
ing camp in Santa Barbara.
Another Finnish athlete who
won was Juha Tiainen in the

hammer with a 243-foot-6.
In the men's javelin Mike
Barnett of Azuza Pacific broke a
20-year-old stadium record
with a toss of 286-foot-10.
The high jump pit saw a lot of
action, beginning with
Maurice Crumby of San Fran
cisco's Balboa High School.
Crumby bettered the national
prep record by a quarter of an
inch with a 7-foot-4'/ 2 jump.
Two hours later Coleen
Sommers of Club Adidas broke
her own meet and stadium re
cord with a leap of 6-foot-s'/2,
which is the best women's
outdoor jump in the world this
year.
A second 20-year-old
stadium record fell in the meet,
this time in the long jump pit,
as Gwen Loud of Hawaii leaped
21-foot-2. Sharifa Barksdale of
Tennessee set records in the
400 meter hurdles in a time of
58.9.
In the 800 meters, Robin
Campbell of the Stanford Track
Club and loetta Clark of Ten

nessee, two of the nation's
finest half-milers, battled head
to head for the first half of the
race. But in the last 400,
Campbell pulled away to break
her own stadium and meet re
cords in 2:02.7.
The Tennessee 4x400 relay
team of kathy Rattesy,
Barksdale, Keilar Bolton and
Clark set the best mark in the
world so far this year in a re
cord time of 3:35.8.
The women's shot put fea
tured some of the world's best
athletes, but it was a surprise
competitor who won. Marita
Walton of Maryland bested her
own personal record by four
feet with a shot of 55-foot-9.
Carol Cady of Stanford
finished fourth with a shot of
53-foot-2'/i.
Meg Ritchie of Great Britain,
who is currently attending
Arizona, won the discus with a
throw of 207-foot-3. Cady had
the third longest American dis
cus throw with a toss of 197-
foot-8.
