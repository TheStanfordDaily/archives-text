Women
The women's tennis coaches
rom Arizona and Arizona State
nust be happy they don't have
o face Stanford any more this
season.
The Cardinal's defending
»JCAA championship squad
showed just how much they
have improved since the last
meeting between Stanford and
the Arizona schools. In early
February, Stanford beat both
teams by identical 7-2 scores in
matches much closer than it
appears.
But it was a different story
this time around.
Despite a mid-match let-up
against UA, Stanford blasted
the Wildcats 7-2 in a match that
really wasn't all that close. And
a day later, shellacked ASU 9-0
in what may very well be their
most devasting "blow-out" all
season.
With the victories, the Car
dinal ran its overall season re
cord to 14-2 and solidified its
hold on second place in the
WCAA, upping its league mark
to 8-1.
And Brennan predicted no

lower than a No. 2 ranking for
his Cardinal when the next set of
national ratings are issued,
probably within a week.
Still, with key matches
against USC, UCLA and San
Diego State just over the hori
zon, coach Frank Brennan was
reluctant to "overlaud" his
troops.
"I was pleased with our con
sistancy. We all played well,"
he said. "But we're not a super,
super team. We're a good
team."
Elise Burgin remained unde
feated in Stanford matches,
beating UA's Cheryl Tebbut
6-1, 7-6 Friday and ASU's Sheri
Norris 6-2, 6-1 Saturday.
The women take on the Uni
versity of the Pacific tomorrow
at 1:30 p.m. at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium in a re
scheduled match of an earlier
rain-out.
Men
Coach Dick Gould's "damn
rookies" once again disproved
any notions that they are too
inexperienced to beat the na
tion's top collegiate tennis
teams.

With five freshmen in the six
singles spots, Stanford played
like a team stacked with expe
rienced seniors and staged a
come-from-behind 7-2 victory
over host UC-Berkeley Friday v
afternoon. The Cardinal took
four of the singles contest —
two of them in three sets—and
swept the doubles en route to
its 11th win of the season
against only one loss.
"We started very slowly, but
I was pleased with the way we
finished," Gould said of the
win. "But we can't be satisfied
with it. We just have to get bet
ter."
Stanford's top netter, junior
Scott Davis, played for the first
time in weeks Friday, but only
played doubles, teamming
with John Letts for a 6-2, 6-3
win.

"He played doubles and felt
a little bit weak," Gould said.
"We have to have him tor USC
and UCLA (April 15 and 16) to
have a realistic shot (against
them)."
Although the freshman
Letts, replacing Davis in the
No. 1 singles spot, lost to Cal's
Randy Nixon 6-7, 6-3, 6-1,
freshman Dan Goldie at No. 2
and Eric Rosenfeld at No. 3 re
corded straight set victories.
Two more "rookies"—Jim
Crabb and Geordie McKee—
also won their singles contests.
Stanford has a full schedule
of matches this week, taking
on San jose State at 1:30 p.m.
tomorrow, Arizona State Friday
and Arizona Saturday. All three
matches are at Stanford Tennis
Stadium.


junior Michelle Weiss went two-for-two in
singles matches over the weekend, beating
her Arizona opponent 7-6, 6-2 on Friday and
Kristi Schreck of Arizona State 6-1, 6-2 on

Greg Webb/Dailv
Saturday to help power Stanford to a pair of
victories. Stanford is 14-2 overall and 8-1 in

I was pleased with the way we
finished," Gould said of the
win. "But we can't be satisfied
with it. We just have to get bet
ter."
Stanford's top netter, junior
Scott Davis, played for the first
time in weeks Friday, but only
played doubles, teamming
with John Letts for a 6-2, 6-3
win.

"He played doubles and felt
a little bit weak," Gould said.
"We have to have him tor USC
and UCLA (April 15 and 16) to
have a realistic shot (against
them)."
Although the freshman
Letts, replacing Davis in the
No. 1 singles spot, lost to Cal's
Randy Nixon 6-7, 6-3, 6-1,
freshman Dan Goldie at No. 2
and Eric Rosenfeld at No. 3 re
corded straight set victories.
Two more "rookies"—Jim
Crabb and Geordie McKee—
also won their singles contests.
