The Sigma Chi fraternity's mud wrestling party last night got a little too dirty. At approximately 11:45
p.m., the Stanford police told Max Scheder, the Sigma Chi in charge of the function, that the party must
stop because they had received many complaints, including one from University President Donald
Kennedy. Although last night was the first official night of fraternity rush, Scheder said the party was not
a rush function.
