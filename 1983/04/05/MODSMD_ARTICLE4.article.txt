# Humane Society accuses researcher here of cruelty to animals
## 
### BOB JOHNSON 
The Humane Society of Santa Clara Valley charged
Friday that a Stanford researcher has been abusive and
cruel to a laboratory animal and will ask the county
district attorney to prosecute.
The charges stem from a March 24 incident in which a
Stanford medical student found an injured dog loose
near his laboratory at the U.S. Veterans Administration
Hospital in Palo Alto. The student, Peter Barran, took the
white samoyed to a private veterinarian and had it de
stroyed.
"The dog had multiple infected ulcers on all four
legs," Barran said. "One on the left hind leg went all the
way to the bone. There was an incision in the right groin
area, which was also infected. It looked as if the incision
had been sewn together before, but it was open. The
dog looked like he was in shock."
Barran took the dog home, then called Stanford vet
erinarian Carolyn Reed and asked her to come examine
it. She said that the dog had been in a fight and was
undergoing treatment. When she told him to return the
dog to the laboratory, Barran refused.
"I took it to an emergency clinic," Barran said. "Dr.
Randy Hemphill (a Palo Alto veterinarian' said it
wouldn't last more than 12 to 24 hours, so I consented to
have it put to sleep."
Hemphill then complained to the Humane Society
and asked that charges be made.

"Our investigators are still going over the evidence,"
said Jane Hutchinson of the Humane Society of Santa
Clara Valley Monday. "We don't know what charges will
he filed or if any civil charges can be applied."
The evidence will be taken to the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office. If the DA decides to pursue the
case, it will probably fall under Santa Clara County ordi
nance section 84-12, which states that "it shall be unlaw
ful to maliciously kill, maim, wound, mutilate, torment,
torture, or physically abuse any animal." Violation Is a
misdemeanor. Normally, however, animal experimenta
tion is exempt from cruelty laws.
Humane Society officials were also unsure Monday
whether the charges would be brought against the Uni
versity, the V.A. or the individual researcher.
lames Dewson, director of Stanford's Division of Lab
oratory Animal Medicine, declined to name the faculty
member who was running the experiment with the dog,
but said the experiment involved cardiovascular re
search. Reed added that an arterial graft had been per
formed on the dog.
"The dog had just had surgery and was not really able
to defend itself when it was attacked," she said. "This
was about 10 days before Barran took it from the hospital
corridor.
