# Humane Society accuses researcher here of cruelty to animals
## 
### BOB JOHNSON 
The Humane Society of Santa Clara Valley charged
Friday that a Stanford researcher has been abusive and
cruel to a laboratory animal and will ask the county
district attorney to prosecute.
The charges stem from a March 24 incident in which a
Stanford medical student found an injured dog loose
near his laboratory at the U.S. Veterans Administration
Hospital in Palo Alto. The student, Peter Barran, took the
white samoyed to a private veterinarian and had it de
stroyed.
"The dog had multiple infected ulcers on all four
legs," Barran said. "One on the left hind leg went all the
way to the bone. There was an incision in the right groin
area, which was also infected. It looked as if the incision
had been sewn together before, but it was open. The
dog looked like he was in shock."
Barran took the dog home, then called Stanford vet
erinarian Carolyn Reed and asked her to come examine
it. She said that the dog had been in a fight and was
undergoing treatment. When she told him to return the
dog to the laboratory, Barran refused.
"I took it to an emergency clinic," Barran said. "Dr.
Randy Hemphill (a Palo Alto veterinarian' said it
wouldn't last more than 12 to 24 hours, so I consented to
have it put to sleep."
Hemphill then complained to the Humane Society
and asked that charges be made.

"Our investigators are still going over the evidence,"
said Jane Hutchinson of the Humane Society of Santa
Clara Valley Monday. "We don't know what charges will
he filed or if any civil charges can be applied."
The evidence will be taken to the Santa Clara County
District Attorney's office. If the DA decides to pursue the
case, it will probably fall under Santa Clara County ordi
nance section 84-12, which states that "it shall be unlaw
ful to maliciously kill, maim, wound, mutilate, torment,
torture, or physically abuse any animal." Violation Is a
misdemeanor. Normally, however, animal experimenta
tion is exempt from cruelty laws.
Humane Society officials were also unsure Monday
whether the charges would be brought against the Uni
versity, the V.A. or the individual researcher.
lames Dewson, director of Stanford's Division of Lab
oratory Animal Medicine, declined to name the faculty
member who was running the experiment with the dog,
but said the experiment involved cardiovascular re
search. Reed added that an arterial graft had been per
formed on the dog.
"The dog had just had surgery and was not really able
to defend itself when it was attacked," she said. "This
was about 10 days before Barran took it from the hospital
corridor.

District Attorney's office may file charges of animal
abuse against the University.
"The attack was part of the reason why the dog had
been moved to a temporary post-operative area, and
that's where he escaped from."
Moreover, according to Dewson, the V.A. is renovat
ing its post-operative facilities, and the dog had not been
placed in a standard, secure cage.
"All I can say is that it was a mistake," he said.
Yet, according to Hutchinson, Hemphill does not be
lieve the wounds were from a fight. He said at a press
conference Friday that he thought the dog had had skin
grafts which were left to infect, because the wounds did
not look like dog bites. »
"It's conceivable that the dog was in a fight," Barran
said. "But it had not been cared for. The wounds were
completely infected. It wasn't even bandaged when I
found it."
"It's just not true that the wounds hadn't been
treated," Reed said. "The dog was in treatment for the
injuries. The bandages had been taken from its legs in
order to treat the wounds topically."

Dewson said that the University may file counter
charges.
"The theft of the animal was wrong, and it was wrong
for Hemphill to destroy it,"he said. "The dog was stolen
and he knew it."
Dewson suspects that this case may be an attempt by
anti-vivisectionists — those who oppose the use of ani
mals in research — to publicize protest rallies which will
be held across the nation April 24.
Friday's press conference, in fact, was held at the
home of Lise Ciraud, who is an organizer of the rallies,
an active animal rights advocate and a Stanford librarian.
"As ethical human beings, we have the responsibility
to care for these research animals," Ciraud said.
"Many of us are hoping this one animal will not have
died in vain. We want this case to help our efforts. And
certainly it will help publicize the animal rights rallies."
One Humane Society official, who asked not to be
named, said the press conference was kept "highly sec
ret" from the University.
"It's all building up to April 24," Dewson said. "This
month is going to be the month when all sorts of strange
things happen."
