# Student accused of forgery
## Plea: 'not guilty' 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
The student charged with forging
18 Senior Casino Night tickets
pleaded not guilty at his arraignment
yesterday.
Senior Aristotle Economon faces
the felony charge of one count of
forgery and one count of conspiracy
to commit forgery. The preliminary
setting for his case is scheduled for
April 29, at which time the court will
either dismiss the case or set a date
for a preliminary hearing.
. lorgen Kvick, a student at Sac
ramento State University and a friend
of Economon's is also charged in the
case.
The two students allegedly printed
and sold 18 phony $10 tickets to the
senior class fundraiser held at Menlo
Circus Club on Feb. 4. Economon
was arrested on the forgery charges
in Sacramento on March 19 while he
was taking the Graduate Manage
ment Admissions Test in Kvick's
name.

At the arraignment, the attorney
for Economon, John Virga of Sac
ramento, requested that Economon
be released on his own recogni
zance. The court did not accept or
refuse the motion, but will not con
sider it until the April 29 court date.
Economon is now free on $100,000
bail. His parents have put up their
home as security for the property
bond. Kvick, whose bail was also
originally set at $100,000, is now free
on his own recognizance.
Virga, who does not represent
Kvick, said he was surprised that
Economon's bail was set at $100,000,
adding that it is "highly unusual" for
such an amount to be set in a forgery
case. High bails are usually reserved
for "very serious offenses," Virga
said.
Virga speculated that the judge
who set the bail might have been in
fluenced by Stanford police officers
who portrayed Economon and Kvick
as the "arch-criminals of the cen
tury." Even if the students are guilty
as charged, their crime hardly merits
a $100,000 bail, Virga said.
"I don't mean to say with a nudge
and a wink that it (forgery) is not that
serious," Virga said. "You can't do
those things."
But such a high bail is usually re

served for "robbers, burglars and
rapists," Virga said. "We're not talk
ing about John Dillinger here."
Kvick has never been arrested be
fore, but Economon has been con
victed in earlier cases of fraud. In
lanuary, Economon pleaded guilty to
charges of mail fraud against the Sac
ramento Bee. In that case, he and a
group of friends had won $10,000 in
the Bee's football pool by submitting

correct football scores after the
games were played, using pre
postmarked envelopes.
Economon, a pre-med student,
was also convicted of illegally obtain
ing more than $1000 in telephone
equipment by using false identifica
tion.
Economon declined to comment
on the case yesterday on the advice
of his attorney.
