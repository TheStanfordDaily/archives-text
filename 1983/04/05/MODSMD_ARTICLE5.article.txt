# Student accused of forgery
## Plea: 'not guilty' 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
The student charged with forging
18 Senior Casino Night tickets
pleaded not guilty at his arraignment
yesterday.
Senior Aristotle Economon faces
the felony charge of one count of
forgery and one count of conspiracy
to commit forgery. The preliminary
setting for his case is scheduled for
April 29, at which time the court will
either dismiss the case or set a date
for a preliminary hearing.
. lorgen Kvick, a student at Sac

Economon is now free on $100,000
bail. His parents have put up their
home as security for the property
bond. Kvick, whose bail was also
originally set at $100,000, is now free
on his own recognizance.
Virga, who does not represent
Kvick, said he was surprised that
Economon's bail was set at $100,000,
adding that it is "highly unusual" for
such an amount to be set in a forgery
case. High bails are usually reserved
for "very serious offenses," Virga
said.
Virga speculated that the judge
who set the bail might have been in
fluenced by Stanford police officers
who portrayed Economon and Kvick
as the "arch-criminals of the cen
