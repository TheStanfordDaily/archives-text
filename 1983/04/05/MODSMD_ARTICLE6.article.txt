# Apathy surprises McCloskey
## 
### JULIANN ANDERSON Staff writer 
After extensive publicity surrounding the ASSU Sen
ate's approval of former Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) as a guest professor last quarter, atten
dance of his course is much lower than expected.
Only 48 students populated the 336-seat Bishop Au
ditorium at the course's third session yesterday morn
ing, which is about one-fifth the number of students
anticipated. An optimistic ASSU handout describing the
class, "The Congressional Decision-Making Process,
1964-1968," said "enrollment limited to 250."
Many of the 48 attending must have been afflicted with
spring fever, for the first six people McCloskey called
upon had not bothered to do the reading.
In response he said, "I asked you to read the Articles
of Confederation — how many of you were privileged to
have the opportunity to read that?"
Only three raised their hands.
No one knew the projected federal budget deficit,
either, which McCloskey subsequently estimated to be
around $200 billion.
Finally, when he asked his students what Rep. Ed
Zschau's (R-Palo Alto) voting record was, nobody volun
teered an answer.
"You kind of get the picture that not very much care is
taken back home to a congressman's voting record on a
national issue," McCloskey said.

He added, "Most people don't know how their con
gressman votes."
Several students queried about the course seemed
enthusiastic.
Senior |udy Swope said, "I think it's great. I've lived in
the congressman's district for quite a few years and I've
always admired him."
Another student, sophomore |on Bridges, com
mented, "It's a good class so far, but it has a lot of
reading for a three-unit course. He seems to be a good
lecturer and I like the way he runs the class; there is a lot
of question and answering where students play the role
of congressmen from their home districts."
He added, "It's not a three-unit mick."
Whether or not it's a "mick," the class meets on Mon
days, Wednesdays and Thursdays, with the latter desig
nated for a guest-lecturer — "someone presenting the
opposing point of view," according to McCloskey.
Included in the lectures will be two former Stanford
student body presidents, David Harris, who, according
to the former congressman, "led the efforts to burn draft
cards during the Vietnam War," and Dennis Hays, who
"was the father of Farth Day in 1970."
By far the most renowned speaker, however, will be
John Ehrlichman, formerly of the Nixon administration,
who will be lecturing on April 28.
After class, McCloskey said he was shocked at the
poor work habits of the students.
