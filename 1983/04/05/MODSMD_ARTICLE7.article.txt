Mideast peace plan considered
Amman, Jordan — Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion Chairman Yasser Arafat and Jordan's King
Hussein appeared yesterday to be nearing agreement
on a formula that would enable the king to respond
positively to President Reagan's Mideast peace in
itiative.
The indications were, however, that the arrange
ment would not be announced publicly until after it
received the blessings of Arab statesat a summit meet
ing in Morocco later this month, possibly April 16 or
17.
The developments followed a frenzied day here in
which Arafat and Hussein sought to resolve what
were described as minor differences in the language

of a draft joint communique they worked on overthe
last day. Arafat also convened here the first full
fledged session of the PLO's executive committee to
meet in Jordan since the group was banished during
the Black September civil war here in 1970.
Despite the newly optimistic mood around the
talks, Western and Arab diplomats cautioned that the
effort to reach agreement could still fail as the
bargaining over final details continued. Moreover,
they warned that going toa summit represented a cal
culated risk for Hussein and his moderate Arab sup
porters, who can expect to see a renewal of strong
pressure from Libya and Syria on the radical Palesti
nian groups within the PLO.
The executive committee apparently did not give
Arafat any strong endorsement to go ahead with the

peace negotiations. But, at the same time, it did not
reject the Reagan plan outright nor did it block Arafat
from cutting a deal with Hussein.
Moreover, even the most radical members of the
committee, complaining of the failure of the Reagan
plan to approve the idea of an independent Palesti
nian state and to recognize the PLO as the sole repre
sentative of Palestinians, went to great lengths to
stress the organization's good relations with Jordan.
According to diplomats here and advisers to
Hussein, the king feels that it is essential for him to
have Arafat's backing to begin negotiations for the
creation of a Palestinian entity in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip that would be linked to Jordan as en
visioned in the Reagan plan. He and Arafat have held
four meetings over the last three days to discuss the

initiative and there were indications that they may
meet again today.
There were reports that Saudi Arabia had played a
strong behind-the-scenes role in gaining Arafat's
agreement to come to terms with Hussein and that
the Saudis were behind the moves for an Arab summit
to endorse the arrangement.
