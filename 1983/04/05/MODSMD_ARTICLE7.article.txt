Mideast peace plan considered
Amman, Jordan — Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion Chairman Yasser Arafat and Jordan's King
Hussein appeared yesterday to be nearing agreement
on a formula that would enable the king to respond
positively to President Reagan's Mideast peace in
itiative.
The indications were, however, that the arrange
ment would not be announced publicly until after it
received the blessings of Arab statesat a summit meet
ing in Morocco later this month, possibly April 16 or
17.
The developments followed a frenzied day here in
which Arafat and Hussein sought to resolve what
were described as minor differences in the language

of a draft joint communique they worked on overthe
last day. Arafat also convened here the first full
fledged session of the PLO's executive committee to
meet in Jordan since the group was banished during
the Black September civil war here in 1970.
Despite the newly optimistic mood around the
talks, Western and Arab diplomats cautioned that the
effort to reach agreement could still fail as the
bargaining over final details continued. Moreover,
they warned that going toa summit represented a cal
culated risk for Hussein and his moderate Arab sup
porters, who can expect to see a renewal of strong
pressure from Libya and Syria on the radical Palesti
nian groups within the PLO.
The executive committee apparently did not give
Arafat any strong endorsement to go ahead with the

peace negotiations. But, at the same time, it did not
reject the Reagan plan outright nor did it block Arafat
from cutting a deal with Hussein.
Moreover, even the most radical members of the
committee, complaining of the failure of the Reagan
plan to approve the idea of an independent Palesti
nian state and to recognize the PLO as the sole repre
sentative of Palestinians, went to great lengths to
stress the organization's good relations with Jordan.
According to diplomats here and advisers to
Hussein, the king feels that it is essential for him to
have Arafat's backing to begin negotiations for the
creation of a Palestinian entity in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip that would be linked to Jordan as en
visioned in the Reagan plan. He and Arafat have held
four meetings over the last three days to discuss the

initiative and there were indications that they may
meet again today.
There were reports that Saudi Arabia had played a
strong behind-the-scenes role in gaining Arafat's
agreement to come to terms with Hussein and that
the Saudis were behind the moves for an Arab summit
to endorse the arrangement.
Reagan may cut MX budget
Washington — President Reagan, seeking to gener
ate support in Congress for the MX missile and at the
same time show flexibility on his defense buildup, to
day will tell Senate Budget Commmittee Republicans
that he can trim $8 billion to $10 billion from his mili
tary spending proposals during the next five years, ad
ministration sources said yesterday.
Most of the money would come from a less costly
plan for deployment of the MX, which Reagan soon
will propose to Congress. The administration's new
plan, its third, is due to be unveiled next Monday by a
special presidential commission. It calls for placing
100 missiles in improved Minuteman silos, which are
said to be cheaper than the new silos that were en
visioned in the "Dense Pack" basing plan rejected by
Congress last December.
Administration officials expressed confidence yes
terday that this MX vote could be turned around, al
though the White House count at this point still falls
slightly below what would be needed if every House
member voted. Officials said that 70 Democrats are
expected to support the MX and that 30 Republicans
are opposed to it, leaving the administration about a
dozen votes short of a majority.
Soviets criticize Reagan arms plan
Moscow — The Soviet Union last night described as
"clear and unambiguous" its rejection of President
Reagan's proposals for an interim agreement on mis
siles in Europe and it asserted that official U.S.
speculations that Moscow would change its position
"are built on sand."
A statement by the official news agency Tass said
that State Department officials "in their propagan
distic fever" appear to have failed to "read carefully"
the text of a press conference Saturday by Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko. He had described Rea
gan's proposals as "unacceptable" and "not serious."
Responding to a State Department spokesman's
statement Saturday that Gromyko's declaration was
not Moscow's last word on the issue and that the So
viets may in fact be ready to negotiate an accord on
the basis of Reagan's offer, Tass said that "the follow
ing words of Gromyko" should be noted in Washing
ton:
"If the position of the United States remains as it
was announced by the president, there are no
chances for an agreement" at the Geneva talks on lim
iting medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
"That is why it would be good if the U.S. adminis
tration adopted a more objective position meeting
the need to preserve the principle of equality and
equal security, and fully taking into account the legit
imate interest of the Soviet Union and of all the states
of the Warsaw treaty."
Challenger launched into space
Cape Canaveral, Florida — The United States rock
eted its new space shuttle Challenger into orbit yes
terday to begin building a revolutionary space track
ing and communications network that will replace
ground stations around the world.
With a four-man crew aboard, the stubby-winged
craft bored flawlessly into a 177-mile-high orbit
around the earth, with spacecraft commander Paul

Weitz, 50, reporting that "we recommend this heart
ily."
Before Weitz and his crew had completed their first
orbit, launch director Alfred O'Hara declared, "we
have two veterans now/' referring to Challenger and
the shuttle Columbia, which has made five flights in
the last two years.
The only discernible damage from the violent
blastoff and climb into orbit was the loosening of a
small section of nylon and silicon insulation near the
rear of the spacecraft.
Gloria Swanson dies in her sleep
New York — Gloria Swanson, the quintessential
glamour girl who reigned in Hollywood's golden age,
died in her sleep at New York Hospital early yester
day. She was 84.
Swanson celebrated her birthday March 27, about a
week after she entered the hospital for undisclosed
reasons. Friends, however, said she had suffered a
slight heart attack.
"She was a wonderfully vibrant lady whose name
was synonymous with Hollywood," comedian Bob
Hope said. "She had an aura of glamour that few stars
before or since have displayed."
Miss Swanson's career began before World War I,
and ended after the Vietnam War; she retired from
the screen in the early 19405, only to return in 1949 as
the demented, aging movie star of "Sunset
Boulevard."
But Swanson — the columnists sometimes called
her"Glorious Gloria" — never leftthe limelight. Mar
ried six times, a self-described paramour of the late
Joseph Kennedy, a fashion plate who swathed herself
in furs, she came to epitomize the glory and ex
travagance of Hollywood's golden age.
Hu Na granted asylum in U.S.
San Francisco — The United States, risking a rup
ture in cultural relations with China and a flood of re-,
quests for political asylum, granted sanctuary yester
day to teen-age tennis champion Hu Na.
The decision, which was announced in Washington
by the Justice Department, turned aside appeals from
China and cuts off eight and a half months of diplo
matic wrangling within the State Department over the
foreign policy implications.
The Chinese, who have been more vocal in this case
than in any other defection, have demanded Hu's re
turn since July 20, when she slipped away from the 32-
nation Federation Cup tournament in Santa Clara,
California. She has said she acted after refusing to join
the Communist Party and after receiving a threaten
ing letter from a high Chinese official.
Hu, 19, said in a statement released by herattorneys
that she was "very happy and relieved" to learn of the
decision.
"I want to thank the American people and the
American government for letting me remain in this
country," she said.
The Chinese had said the "innocent" teen-ager was
lured into defecting, and denied she was under pres

sure to join the Communist Party. The Chinese also
threatened to cut back on cultural exchanges if Hu
were granted asylum.
Attorneys for the 5-foot-0 tennis player say her case
is unique because she presented documentation to
back her claim that she has a well-founded fear of
persecution if returned to China.
DeLorean may be hiding millions
Los Angeles — John DeLorean may have access to
$17 million concealed in Switzerland, the govern
ment charged yesterday in a motion opposing reduc
tion of the millionaire auto maker's $5 million bail.
The government's grounds for opposing De-
Lorean's attempt to reduce his bail were disclosed
shortly before noon when U.S. District Court Judge
Robert Takasugi unsealed documents filed in the co
caine trafficking case. A bail-reduction hearing was
scheduled for later yesterday.
Besides suggesting that DeLorean, 58, may have
hidden millions, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Walsh
also cited three other grounds for opposing any re
duction in bail and in fact calling for increasing the
defendant's bail. They included allegations of:
—"Dishonest dealing" in prior bail matters by De-
Lorean.
Efforts by DeLorean to sell Logan Manufacturing
Co. in Utah on an "immediate cash" basis.
In raising the question of whether DeLorean may

have millions secreted in Switzerland, the prose
cution recounted the tangled organization and affairs
of GPD Services Inc., ostensibly formed by DeLorean
to develop his gull-winged, stainless steel sports car.
Citing an affidavit filed in a bankruptcy hearing for
DeLorean Motor Co. in Detroit, the government said
that $17.65 million paid to GPD was to be transmitted
to Lotus Cars in England, the firm that was to do the
actual development of DeLorean's car.
Trading slow on Wall Street
Stock prices drifted lower in quiet trading yesterday
in the aftermath of the selling that hit the market late
last week.

13.26 on Thursday before the three-day Easter week
end, dropped 2.42 yesterday to 1127.61.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled
66.01 million shares, down from Thursday's 100.57 mil
lion.
Today's weather
