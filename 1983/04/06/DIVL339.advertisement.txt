As a studcht and a food-service worker, I come into daily
contact with other students. I hear their complaints about food
service, campus safety, campus constraints, and college life in
general. Some grievances are well-founded, and I believe they
should be brought to the attention of all students, faculty, and
administration. The ASSU Senate can play a major role in
bringing problem to attention and eventually resulting in
changes. 1 hope to be able lo represent the sentiment of the
student body in the ASSU Senate.
TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT
