# Dollies: old squad passes on baton
## 
### JANE McCONNELL Staff writer 
Out with the old and in with the new — it's
time for last year's dolly squad to give up the
limelight to a new group of women.
Sophomores Julie Clinton and Karen Hanst
and freshmen Marisa Butler, Debbie Reza and
Carolyn Weisz, chosen last quarter, will now
have the chance to dance their way into Stan
ford's heart. Though each has different rea
sons for wanting to be a dolly, they all share a
common enthusiasm.

"Hearing 'All Right Now' at the football
games convinced me," Butler said. "I love the /
idea of really getting people into the games."
Others are doing it for the involvement. "I
was looking fora balance between academics,
athletics and relaxation time," Reza said. "Bp
sides just studying, this will give me the satis
faction of getting involved with the school."
Hanst added, "It's my contribution to Stan
ford."
The women were chosen through a process
involving two rounds of cuts. In the first

round, former dollies judged them on dance
ability, using videotapes. In the second round
the Band and certain athletes judged them on
their stage presence and personality. Finalists
then went to a party at the band shack where
band members made the final decision after
talking to each of the women. The next morn
ing those who had made it were kidnapped
for breakfast by the Band and old dollies.
"I was ecstatic," Butler said. "I couldn't find
any of my clothes to put on, and I woke up my

whole dorm screaming."
All of the new dollies felt the selection pro
cess was a good one. "They're looking for your
personality tocomeout in the dancing," Butler
said. "The way they do it, they get a good
mixture of both.''
The women have already begun practicing
fortheir debut, which will beat Splendorin the
Grass in Manzanita Park. They're now working
three to four hours a day, five days a week.
They will return to campus in August to prac
tice intensively and to live with their dolly
families, who willputthem upduringthis time
and bcome their surrogate families.
All agree it's worth the big time commit
ment. "I get so much energy out of doing it
that it gives me energy to get everything else
done," Reza said.
The women feel that being a dolly will be

cornea big part of their Stanford years. "I know
it will make Stanford mean more to me by
making me more a part of Stanford," Clinton
said.
For last year's dollies, the memories are all
that's left. Sophomores Sue Cameron, Betsy
De Palma, Diana Dobbs, Gina Moreno and
Melinda Myers all said that being a dolly is
something they'll always remember.
"I'll never forget some things — like Big
Came," said Cameron. "Performing for the
Queen is something I'll remember," added
Myers.
Their advice to the new dollies is to enjoy it
while they can. "You have to enjoy every min
ute of it because you don't realize it's passing
until it's over," said Cameron.
The sheer fun of it is what all the dollies
agree was the best part. "We got to play
around, laugh, and dance in front of people,
which is what we love," said De Palma.
Myers enjoyed the experience enough to do
it all over again. "It was the best year of my

life," she said. She had wanted to be a dolly
since sixth grade, when she started coming to
football games and saw the dollies in action.
"It's hard to believe I actually did it," she said.
Besides the fun and memories, the women
said being a dolly gave them more of a feeling
of belonging to the school. Moreno said, "It
really made us feel a part of Stanford. We got
the inside story on athletics and got to know
the athletic director, we learned how budget
systems run through planningour budgets, we
got to know President Kennedy and got an idea
of school politics . . .We really got involved in
the school."
Not only did the women learn more about
the University, but they also made many out
side contacts. Cameron said, "There's so
much more involved than most students
realize. They just see us at football games and
rallies, but actually mostofourtimeisspentoff
campus, doing community functions, rallies
on road trips for alumni, and even performing
for birthdays and parties for big companies."

Moreno added, "There's so much interac
tion with people — students, alumni and
community. The more you do it the easier it
is."
Much of this interaction involves represent
ing Stanford to alumni who love the Univer
sity. "You becomea symbol in a little red dress
— something they can identify with and feel
close to," De Palma said.
But there were times when the women said
they felt they were only symbols. "You don't
know whether people are talking to you as a
person or just as a dolly," Myers said.
De Raima added, "You have to prove your
self right off the bat, and live down the typical
cheerleader image."
She summed up, "When the band played
the national anthem and we were standing in
front of 80,000 people with the sun shining and
the flag blowing, thinking how lucky we were
to be there ... It gives me the chills just think
ing about it!"
