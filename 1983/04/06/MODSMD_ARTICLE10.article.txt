## Liberal view represented in student publications 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
Despite the increased visibil
ity of conservative groups and
publications on college cam
puses recently, liberal and
left-wing groups still continue
to be an influential force in
campus thought.
The left-wing New Indicator,
a student newspaper at the
University of California at San
Diego, continues to be the
second most widely-read

Unlike their conser
vative counterparts
however, neither
paper receives any
corporate funding.
Both receive finan
cial support from
student fees.

paper on campus and one of
the nation's most widely
distributed college publica
tions off-campus, according to
staff member john Bekken.
The paper, which was founded
in 1%6, Bekken said, continues
to have the support of "a sub
stantial number of people" on
campus.
The Stanford Progressive,
the year-old publication of the
Stanford Progressive Alliance,
also continues to attract wide
readership despite the in
creased attention and publicity
given to its conservative coun
terpart, The Stanford Review,
in recent months. Response to
the paper, according to SPA
member Dana Price, has been
"favorable."
Though differing in audi
ence and focus (the New Indi
cator calls itself a "radical"
publication while the Progres
sive considers itself to be just
what its title implies), both
publications share the com
mon goal of spreading aware
ness of current social and polit
ical issues. Both publications,
like their conservative coun-

terparts, concern themselves
with such controversial current
issues as the draft and United
States domestic and foreign
policy.
Unlike most of their conser
vative counterparts, however,
neither paper receives any
corporate funding. Both re
ceive financial support from
student fees.
Neither publication, accord
ing to Bekken and Price, feels it
has been adversely affected by
the presence of right-wing
groups on campus. Price said
that SPA members generally
feel "no hostility" toward the
conservative Stanford Review.
"It's good to have those
things around," she said, re
ferring to the conservatives'
argument that both sides of the
political spectrum should be
represented on campus. She
added that although SPA
members do not agree with the
opinions voiced in the Review,
"most people read it."
Conversely, Stanford Con
servative Political Alliance
member Paul Davies also
said that he reads the Stanford

Progressive, and he affirmed
Price's statement that there
exists little hostility between
the groups.
Bekken, on the other hand,
said that the Mew Indicator had
often been criticized by the
UCSD conservative publica
tion, The California Review.
The New Indicator, he said, still
continues to carry a larger
readership than the Review.
The left-wing campus groups
also expressed the feeling that
the role of conservative groups
in campus politics has been
overplayed. Bekken said that
despite the popular belief that
radical thought died during the
'60s, left-wing groups at UCSD

experienced "a spiral of activ
ity" between 1978 and 1980. He
also pointed out that since
many conservative papers are
funded by corporations rather
than student groups, their pre
sence may not necessarily re
flect student support for their
views.
SPA member Mark Mazur
said that his group is still
"pretty busy" despite the pub
licized conservative trend on
college campuses. He said that
he believes that liberal thought
at Stanford is still strong. "The
neo-conservative trend has
been overstated," Mazur said.
Michael Ciraolo, a city editor
for UC-Berkeley's main news
paper, The Daily Californian,
said that Berkeley does not
have a publication dedicated
exclusively to advocating left
wing beliefs, even though pub
lications from groups such as
the campus communist party
do exist. The lack of a left-wing
publication and the presence
of a right-wing paper, Ciraolo
said, does not necessarily re
flect a conservative trend
among traditionally-liberal Cal

students.
"Conservatives here feel
they need to protect their
views while liberals don't."
Even left-wing supporters,
however, admit that the level
of campus activism is not what
they would like it to be. Bekken
described the UCSD student
body as one composed of
"moderate, middle-of-the
road" students who are chiefly
concerned with schoolwork
and getting jobs. He said that
the fact that the New Indicator
was published once every
week in 1966 and is now pub
lished only once every two
weeks reflects the changing
trend.

the role of conservative groups
in campus politics has been
overplayed. Bekken said that
despite the popular belief that
radical thought died during the
'60s, left-wing groups at UCSD

experienced "a spiral of activ
ity" between 1978 and 1980. He
also pointed out that since
many conservative papers are
funded by corporations rather
than student groups, their pre
sence may not necessarily re
flect student support for their
views.
SPA member Mark Mazur
said that his group is still
"pretty busy" despite the pub
licized conservative trend on
college campuses. He said that
he believes that liberal thought
at Stanford is still strong. "The
neo-conservative trend has
been overstated," Mazur said.
Michael Ciraolo, a city editor
for UC-Berkeley's main news
paper, The Daily Californian,
said that Berkeley does not
have a publication dedicated
exclusively to advocating left
wing beliefs, even though pub
lications from groups such as
the campus communist party
do exist. The lack of a left-wing
publication and the presence
of a right-wing paper, Ciraolo
said, does not necessarily re
flect a conservative trend
among traditionally-liberal Cal

students.
"Conservatives here feel
they need to protect their
views while liberals don't."
Even left-wing supporters,
however, admit that the level
of campus activism is not what
they would like it to be. Bekken
described the UCSD student
body as one composed of
"moderate, middle-of-the
road" students who are chiefly
concerned with schoolwork
and getting jobs. He said that
the fact that the New Indicator
was published once every
week in 1966 and is now pub
lished only once every two
weeks reflects the changing
trend.
Despite the increased visibil
ity of conservative groups and
publications on college cam
puses recently, liberal and
left-wing groups still continue
to be an influential force in
campus thought.
The left-wing New Indicator,
a student newspaper at the
University of California at San
Diego, continues to be the

paper on campus and one of
the nation's most widely
distributed college publica
tions off-campus, according to
staff member john Bekken.
The paper, which was founded
in 1%6, Bekken said, continues
to have the support of "a sub
stantial number of people" on
campus.
The Stanford Progressive,
the year-old publication of the
Stanford Progressive Alliance,
also continues to attract wide
readership despite the in
creased attention and publicity
given to its conservative coun
terpart, The Stanford Review,
in recent months. Response to
the paper, according to SPA
member Dana Price, has been
"favorable."
Though differing in audi
ence and focus (the New Indi
cator calls itself a "radical"
publication while the Progres
sive considers itself to be just
what its title implies), both
publications share the com
mon goal of spreading aware
ness of current social and polit
ical issues. Both publications,
like their conservative coun-

terparts, concern themselves
with such controversial current
issues as the draft and United
States domestic and foreign
policy.
Unlike most of their conser
vative counterparts, however,
neither paper receives any
corporate funding. Both re
ceive financial support from
student fees.
Neither publication, accord
ing to Bekken and Price, feels it
has been adversely affected by
the presence of right-wing
groups on campus. Price said
that SPA members generally
feel "no hostility" toward the
conservative Stanford Review.
"It's good to have those
things around," she said, re
ferring to the conservatives'
argument that both sides of the
political spectrum should be
represented on campus. She
added that although SPA
members do not agree with the
opinions voiced in the Review,
"most people read it."
Conversely, Stanford Con
servative Political Alliance
member Paul Davies also
said that he reads the Stanford

Progressive, and he affirmed
Price's statement that there
exists little hostility between
the groups.
Bekken, on the other hand,
said that the Mew Indicator had
often been criticized by the
UCSD conservative publica
tion, The California Review.
The New Indicator, he said, still
continues to carry a larger
readership than the Review.
The left-wing campus groups
also expressed the feeling that
the role of conservative groups
in campus politics has been
overplayed. Bekken said that
