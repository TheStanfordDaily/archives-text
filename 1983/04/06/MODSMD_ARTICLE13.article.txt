## The
						Stanford Daily Examine all housing options 
### 
Over the next several weeks virtually every
student on campus will be forced to ask them
selves: "Where am I going to live next year?"
Graduating seniors will have to fend for them
selves this time, but for those students return
ing in the fall, we'd like to offer a few sugges
tions on how to go about finding an answer.
The Housing Center hopes to have the draw
books ready for distribution by the beginning of
next week. This marks the opening kick-off of
the spring draw, wherein participating students
will be either assigned to a residence for next
year or assigned to the unassigned list.
The biggest favor you can do for yourself be
fore you draw that fateful number is to take the
time to explore all of the housing options avail
able. Even if you are positive that you want to
live in Stern again next year, take advantage of
the residence open-houses during the weeks
before the draw to discover what you will (or
won't) be missing when you choose your dorm
preferences.
In addition to the well-populated dorms,
there are 25 special priority and row houses
filled by the spring draw. These living groups

promote an atmosphere markedly different
than dorm-life. Limited numbers of residents
and strong common interests encourage a feel
ing of unity in the row and cluster houses.
Many of the special priority houses, such as
American Studies, La Casa Italiana and Haus
Mitt, are oriented around a central theme. They
offer an opportunity to add an extra dimension
to dorm life. While this type of living arrange
ment isn't for everyone, we again encourage
you to find out first-hand if it is right or wrong
for you.
The 12 residential fraternities on campus pro
vide yet another housing option for under
graduate males. Fraternity rush, which began
this Monday and will continue for three weeks,
is a chance for freshmen and sophomores to see
the inside of a fraternity house and meet with
this part of the Stanford population. Some will
discover that the fraternity system doesn't fit
their lifestyle, but many rushees will be sur
prised to discover more diversity among the
fraternities than they may have thought.
Finally, and most important, remember that
wherever you live next year, it's not where you
live, but who you live with.
