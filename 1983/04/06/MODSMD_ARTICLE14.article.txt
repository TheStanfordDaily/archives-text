## Reasons for 'gay policy' muddled 
### 
The first spring quarter issue of the
Daily treated us to a report of the Law
School's "explicit policy statement"
on sexual orientation in the evalua
tion of applicants ("Law School
enacts non-biased admissions rule
for gay students," March 28). Jamie
Henderson, president of the Gay Law
Students Association, expressed dis
connected and contradictory justifi
cations for the printed addition to
the Law School bulletin. Law Prof.
Jack Friedenthal, chairman of the
Admissions Committee, set forth
reasoning amounting to no more
than "everyone's doing it." I find this
example symptomatic of the
muddleheadedness pervading dis
cussions of "discrimination I find it
particularly distressing that the men
and women in training now to write,
interpret and go to court over legisla
tion , mcluding"anVt-discrimmation"

examine issues critically and respon
sibly.
Henderson states that "explicit
public statements" can reassure
applicants who might not otherwise
list involvement with gay causes or
organizations on their law school
applications. He claims that "the
printed policy will lessen a gay stu
dent's chances of being at a disad
vantage in gaining admission," ad
mitting nevertheless that "we have
no reason to think that the Law
School has been discriminatory."
Further, Henderson assures us that
"gays will come here, with or without
official policy — it's just giving them a
fair shot at admission."
If we believe along with Hender
son that the admissions policy of the
Law School has not included sexual
orientation as an exclusionary factor,
then it cannot follow that the printed
policy will lessen a gay student's "dis
advantage," since ipsofacto, such a
student is not at a disadvantage.
Labeling of a student as gay would
therefore have no effect on his or her
chances for admission, since sexual
preference is quite rightly consid
ered an irrelevant characteristic in
the evaluation of a student's compe
tence to study and practice law.
Hardly more persuasive is the jus
tification that a printed policy reas
sures applicants who might other
wise not list involvement in gay or
ganizations. With which gender one
shares intimacy should be a private
matter, as University President
Donald Kennedy expressed in the
same article, a matter of private con
cern and not related to merit. If the
sincere applicant lists gay causes and
organizations, he does so as evidence
of active expression of his values.
The Admissions Committee can
evaluate such evidence of a candi
date's interests and activities without

injecting personal biases for or
against the values. Democrats on the
committee would not denigrate an
applicant's energetic work in a Re
publican campaign because of their
own political orientation. All the
same, they would not feel compelled
to tell Republicans that they are back
ing the right party. The committee
can respect a student's choice in mat
ters of private life without agreeing
that his choice is right.
The only possible argument we
could construct for reassuring
applicants is as ludicrous as it is un
likely. The gay applicant whose en
tire organized extracurricular activity
revolved around explicitly gay causes
and organizations and who felt con
strained not to list them on an appli
cation would present to the Commit
tee a dismal record of no interests
outside studies. The paucity o< such a
record might lessen chances for ad
mission, expecially in the case of
less-than-extraordinary grades and
test scores. In my experience, which
has included gay roommates and
friends, students whose organized
extracurricular activities comprise
primarily gay causes are quite out
spoken about their values and would
have no hesitation whatsoever in list
ing all they have done.
Friedenthal stated that he "didn't
think it was necessary, but we de
cided to make our policy absolutely
clear." In addition, referring to other
schools which have recently adopted
similar policies, he said that "the
committee thought that in an advanc
ing age we ought to so state in line
with the others."
Clearly this shows that those im
plementing the policy did not see it
as any substantive alteration to the
status quo. Following suit in matters
of "discrimination" and "equal op
portunity," while a convenient op
tion in this day of ready bandwagons,
shows a certain lack of spine. We
ought to expect more certain, care
fully considered reasoning behind
decisions on a process so fundamen
tal as admissions. Because one stu
dent group made much noise and
because other schools are sup
posedly advancing toward en
lightenment is thin justification for
an alteration at best unneeded and at
worst actually detrimental.
Merit should be the "prime de
terminant" in evaluating any person,
according to Kennedy. Sexual orien
tation simply should not enter as a
relevant factor in the decision
making process. Yet a policy state
ment which explicitly sets forth an
irrelevant characteristic as a non
object of discrimination defeats the
purpose behind eliminating the ir
relevance. In the same way, policies
meant to remove ethnic origin as a

relevant factor encourage vigorous
recognition of this avowedly irrelev
ant factor — we have even come to
the absurd position of justifying "in
formal quotas" and "minority re
cruitment" as methods of eliminat
ing discrimination by race, all the
while making ethnic origin a
paramount factor in evaluation. With
the same contradictory results, the
much-vaunted Equal Rights Am
mendment included provision for a
federal Women's Bureau to coordi
nate activities, although its proposed
intent was to make unconstitutional
discrimination according to gender.
The word "discrimination," before
its meaning was besmirched by
name-calling, meant "to make clear
distinctions; to differentiate." It is
akin to "discern." We cannot nor
would we wish to eliminate the dis
cerning of all differences among
people, because differences make
richer our lives and our society as a
whole. People are in fact different —
and they are much the same.
When we blithely speak of
eliminating "discrimination," we
mean that we want to strive to recog
nize and act according to distinctions
only in matters where the distinc
tions are relevant. This is certainly
not an easy task; it demands careful
thought and examination of our
values as a society and how we ex
press them in the process of sharing
society's labors and rewards. Label
ing all discernment perjoratively as
"discrimination" and then writing up
laws and implementing policies to
"wipe out" discrimination exposes
the shallowness of our thinking con
cerning relevent distinctions and
how we should make them.
If sexual orientation is not relevant
to the selection of applicants, then it
should simply not be included in the
assessment of differences and
similarities which finally leads to
choosing one applicant over
another. Including a statement that
identifies this characteristic as ir
relevant undermines the reasoning
behind our decision to consider it
irrelevant.
Proponents of affirmative action
and explicit statements point out that
informal policies can change with
time and the constitution of
decision-making bodies. They also
insist that past grievances require
present and future corrective action.
This might be the case; before we
legislate and act to realize our values,
however, we should be clear about
what values we hold and what action
is consistent with them. Such clarifi
cation demands careful thought, and
can only be hurt by name-calling and
capitulation to a bandwagon mental
ity.
