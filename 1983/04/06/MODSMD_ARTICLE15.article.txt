## An unthinking recipe for bio lab 
### 
For the past four years, the De
partment of Biological Sciences here
has implemented an innovative un
dergraduate laboratory program.
This program has departed from the
traditional "cookbook" format often
employed in undergraduate lab
courses. Exactly what makes this
program different?
Biology 44X and 44Y teach think
ing. Rather than following a "recipe"
from a lab manual, students are in
troduced to a biological system and
applicable techniques. They are then
asked to formulate their own hy
pothesis and then proceed with their
lab. Students have access to the labs
for 60 hours per week, and to any
equipment or supplies they need.
Students are taught by a group
primarily composed of under
graduate TAs. In the past, students

have consistently praised (through
surveys and discussions) the staff for
its knowledge, dedication and avail
ability. Students enjoy the program,
and consider it more valuable than
"cookbook labs" they have taken.
Indeed, this program exemplifies the
supposed Stanford ideal of a liberal
education—a rarity in pre-med cur
ricula. So why are we writing this let
ter?
The Undergraduate Studies Com
mittee of the Biology Department is
currently proposing a new program
to replace Biology 44. The new pro
posal would bring back a cookbook
format. It calls for the students to
duplicate procedures from their lab
manuals, restricts lab time to three
hours per week, and replaces most
of the undergraduate TAs with
graduate students.

Basically, some of the biology pro
fessors and many of the graduate
students believe that under
graduates do not know what is good
for them. They explained that their
new proposal teaches "solid scien
tific techniques," which, they say,
must be perfected before a student is
capable of thinking about an experi
ment. They seek to replace a pro
gram which has successfully taught
both technique and thinking with
one that stresses conformity.
However, there are several faculty
members and graduate students who
support the current program. In
deed, it is, we think, one of the most
unique and educational under
graduate labs in the country. We'd
like to keep it.
