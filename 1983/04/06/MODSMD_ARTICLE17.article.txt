# El Salvador: Spanish for Vietnam
## 
### 
Much of the debate over U.S. policy in El Salvador has
centered on whether the United States is becoming in
volved in a situation analogous to that of the Vietnam
War. While the Reagan administration steadfastly re
fuses to recognize any parallels whatsoever (Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger recently made the sage re
mark that there were no parallels at all because "El Sal
vador is much closer"), there are a number of unmistak
able similarities between U.S. involvement in El Salvador
and that in Vietnam. The Reagan administration has
been steadily increasing U.S. military involvement in El
Salvador in the form of military advisers and military aid,
60 percent of which has so far gone without direct con
gressional approval.
Once again, this support of a corrupt and harshly
repressive government in a country in which the United
States has few intrinsic economic or strategic interests is
being justified on the basis of the "domino theory"; like
Vietnam, El Salvador has been turned into a test case in
the fight to stop the spread of communism. Finally,
many of the tactics the Reagan administration has used,
such as the use of "free and fair" elections to legitimize
the repressive government of El Salvador and the pro
posed "rural pacification" program, are sharply re
miniscent of the tactics employed in Vietnam more than
a decade ago.
As striking and important as these parallels are, there
are a number of even more fundamental conceptual
similarities between U.S. policies in El Salvador and
those in Vietnam. Many of these similarities are evident
in the academic analyses of Vietnam, one of the best of
which is a book by Leslie Gelb and Richard Betts entitled
The Irony of Vietnam: The System Worked.
In their book, Gelb and Betts argue that U.S. policy in
Vietnam was beset by a number of dilemmas which
caused a self-perpetuating stalemate in Vietnam similar
to the one that is presently forming in El Salvador. One
of the basic problems confronting the United States was
the paradox of "stakes versus leverage."
It appeared to many that the United States should be
able to use its massive support of the government of
South Vietnam as leverage to force that government to
institute the political and economic reforms necessary
to remove the demands for revolution. The United
States was paradoxically unable to use the threat of
withdrawal of aid as leverage, however, because it was
clear that the United States felt that its stakes in stopping
Communism in Vietnam were so high that it would con
tinue to aid the government of South Vietnam whether
or not it reformed.
Similarly, it is no accident that the Reagan administra
tion has been unwilling and unable to pressure the gov
ernment of El Salvador into instituting meaningful re
forms. It has become abundantly clear, from Reagan's
repeated certifications of progress of human rights in El
Salvador despite all evidence to the contrary, that mili
tary aid will continue no matter how repressive the gov
ernment of El Salvador is.
A second problem with U.S. policy in Vietnam, Gelb
and Betts argue, was that the United States attempted to
apply a military solution based on a bipolar world viewto
what was essentially a regional political problem. By so
doing, the United States actually exacerbated the under
lying political problems that caused the conflict in the

first place. Specifically, massive support of the govern
ment of South Vietnam laid that government open to the
charge that it was not a legitimate government repre
senting the interests of its people but an agent of a
foreign country. This allowed North Vietnam to capture
the banner of Vietnamese nationalism and the air of
legitimacy that allowed it to mobilize popular support.
In El Salvador, a similar process is taking place as the
legitimacy of the government is undermined by its obvi
ous dependence on a foreign power.
In addition, the emphasis on military solutions in both
cases precludes any peaceful negotiations. When the
United States periodically tried negotiations in Viet
nam, it tried to do so from positions of strength. The
predictable result was that the highly motivated and
ideological North Vietnamese became even more in
transigent.
Similarly, the Reagan administration have given signs
that it will make some attempts to bring the rebel oppo
sition in El Salvador into the next election, but the fact
that such a move was suggested only as an afterthought
to a military buildup in order to appease critics of the
administration indicates that military aggressiveness will
once again undermine the atmosphere of trust that is a
precondition of peaceful political participation.
The final and most important parallel between U.S.
involvement in Vietnam and that in El Salvador is that in
both cases the United States could not pursue a military
victory and could not accepta military defeat, thus mak
ing a prolonged stalemate inevitable. In Vietnam, Celb
and Betts argue, the United States was unable to pursue
a military victory because, due to its experience in
Korea, it resisted getting involved in a land war in Asiaas
long as it could while still avoiding defeat. The United
States also avoided bringing China or the USSR into the
conflict after the painful lesson of Korea. On the other
hand, successive presidents felt they could not afford to
lose in Vietnam because of a strong domestic consensus
for anti-communist containment.
The sources of stalemate differ in El Salvador, but they
are equally undeniable. Public opinion is firmly against
the commitment of U.S. combat troops to El Salvador,
even though virtually all military experts agree that a
military victory by the government is not possible with
out a substantial number of foreign troops no matter
how much other military aid the government receives.
The Reagan administration has even publicly stated that
it is not seeking, nor does it expect to achieve, a decisive
military victory. On the other hand, the commitment of
U.S. prestige and the ideological anti-communism of the
Reagan administration make it clear that it has no inten
tion of losing.
And so the stalemate continues, with the United
States unable to win and unwilling to lose, exactly as in
Vietnam. While the experience of Vietnam serves as a
dire warning of the future of present U.S. policies in Fl
Salvador, however, it also allows us to draw lessons from
our past mistakes. As Celb and Betts conclude, "The
need for pragmatism more than doctrines, formulas and
ideologies is the basic lesson of the Vietnam War."
