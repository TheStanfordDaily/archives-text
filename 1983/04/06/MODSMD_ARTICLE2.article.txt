# Administrators protest proposal for Tresidder control of dept. lounges
## 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
Administrators who run indepen
dent food service operations in
academic departments here have
denounced a recommendation by
the Tresidder Union Board that it
have the power to administer all cash
food sales on campus.
The set of recommendations,
made at a Tresidder Union Board
meeting Feb. 16, was designed to
maintain competitive prices among
the different food service opera
tions, according to Tresidder Union
Director Ellen Oppenheim.
The recommendations also asked
that on campus cash food operations
pay for such expenses as utilities,
maintenance and security, and that
any new cash food operations not
compete with any existing facilities.

In addition, the recommendations
requested that food concessions on
campus, except for those which can
be done at the actual location of sale,
be handled by Tresidder.
Another recommendation made
was that dorm cash food sales should
be limited in scope and not intended
for profit.
According to Susan Crawford, of
fice services manager for the School
of Education, responses to the rec
ommendations from the adminis
trators who oversee the various in
dependent food service operations
have been "all negative." She
pointed out that some of the opera
tions, such as the Poli Sci Cafe, had
been operated unsuccessfully by
Tresidder before and became more
successful when operated indepen
dently. She added that profits from

the food service in the School of
Education are a part of the de
partmental budget and provide
necessary funds for student ac
tivities, and that student programs
may suffer if the changes are im
plemented.
Paul lohnson, assistant dean of
administration for the Graduate
School of Business, expressed a simi
lar fear. The GSB lounge, he said, is
completely student-operated and its
profits provide complete funding for
student activities.
"We certainly would resist the no
tion that anyone come in and take it
over," lohnson said.
Oppenheim, however, empha
sized that the recommendations are
"just discussion so far" and that no
plans have yet been made to imple
ment them. The board, she said, had
been "discussing the need for policy
change" and the set of recom
mendations was first presented to
the Union Board in February.
According to Allison Rittenhouse,
Tresidder Food Committee student
representative, the recom
mendations were designed to
strengthen Tresidder's financial po
sition by ensuring that all on-campus
food services become competitively
priced and do not compete directly
with Fresidder's services. She said
that she "sympathizes with their core
goals" and recognizes Tresidder's
need for additional funding, espe
cially in light of the many planned
additions to the building. But she
added that she felt the recom
mendations would he "stepping on
too many peoples' toes."
"Tresidder is not trying to estab
lish itself as a monopoly," she said.
Tresidder is "not interested in seri
ously limiting food services" here,
she added.

UNCERTAIN FUTURE: A recommendation that on-campus food sales
be administered by Tresidder Union would affect many department
lounges, including Nuts & Mud (above) in Terman.
