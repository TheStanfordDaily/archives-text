# Students here realize uses of personal computers
## 
### BARBARA KELLEY 
Senior Mike Boone had the
first personal computer in the
house. He let several of his
housemates experiment with
his system on a term paper or
two. Before long, they were
hooked.
By winter quarter this year,
there were four personal com
puters at work in Adelfa in
Lagunita Court.
'We saw how great Mike's
computer was," personal
computer owner, Alex Knight
said, "and we all wanted one."
'It's just a question of
whether or not they can afford
one."
Knight, a freshman majoring
in economics and communica
tion, uses his IBM personal
computer for term papers, re
sumes and form letters. "It's a
great tool," he said. "It's faster,

the papers look betterand it's a
lot more efficient."
His IBM personal computer
features a word processing
program that is easy to use and
easy for Knight to explain to his
friends. "I'm not really inclined
technically," said Knight,
though he plans to write some
unsophisticated programs for
such chores as balancing his
checkbook.
Personal computer user
Chris McConnell, on the other
hand, is technically inclined.
Hp started his own computer
rompanv when he was 15.
McConnell,. a sophomore,
uses his personal computer
both for word processing and
for his computer business.

His friends frequently use
his computer to play one of
about 110 game programs he
keeps in his desk, McConnell
said.
McConnell finds that he can
write better papers in shorter
time on the computer. Free as
sociation is much easier on the
computer, according to
McConnell, because you can
get your ideas down and then
easily rearrange the text with
out retyping.
Although Knight and
McConnell were among the
first in their dorms to actually
buy their own personal com
puters, the survey conducted
winter quarter by a journalism
class found that 39 percent of
all Stanford students have used
or are using a personal com
puter. It's a trend that is
spreading from technology-

oriented programs to the
humanities.
At the American Studies
House, where most of the stu
dents are majoring in the
humanities, the residents seri
ously considered buying a per
sonal computer with a just
discovered windfall of $1000.
As it turned out, the personal
computer came in fourth in the
rank-order ballot, behind a
stereo, a video cassette re
corder and a "package" that
included Uwn rhairs and a
Mender
Computers started coming
to college in a big way this past
September, according to an ar
ticle in Electronics Magazine:

At Stevens Institute of
Technology in Hoboken, New
Jersey, all the incoming
freshmen in science and sys
tems planning were required
to purchase an Atari 800 for
$747.
At Carnegie-Mellon Univer
sity in Pittsburgh, the adminis
tration is reportedly consider
ing buying 8000 personal com
puters for students and faculty.
At Clarkson College of
Technology in Potsdam, New
York, the trustees |ust agreed
upon a plan to hand out per
sonal computers to all incom
ing 1983 freshmen for a one
time deposit of $200 arid a
charge of $200 each semester.
The article speculated that
"other colleges with strong
technology programs such as
Stanford University . . .will fol
low suit with similar student
computer plans."
According to Ralph Gorin,
Director of Stanford's LOTS
computer facility, "at this in
stant, there is no such plan."
If there were, it seems a
good bet that studpnts would
not welcome the plan with
open arms.
The survey found that stu
dents here would oppose a re
quirement that they purchase a
personal computer at their
own expense by a margin of
more than four to one.
The hypothetical question
asked students how they
would feel if a requirement
similar to those instituted at
Stevens Institute of Technol
ogy and Carnegie-Mellon were
instituted at Stanford.
Responses ranged from
one-word answers of the four
letter variety to cryptic one
liners. "I'd go to UCLA," one
male graduate student wrote
A few students objected to
the fact of computers per se. "I
cherish my right to ignore
computers," one freshman
wrote.
Some students wrote that
with thp statp-of- f he irt im
proving constantly, ( omputers
required freshman year would
be outdated by the time those
students graduated. "The next
generation of personals will be
far superior to those ot today,"

wrote one graduate student in
Education.
Other students objected on
the grounds that "Stanford
University is still a liberal arts
university." Still others
thought such a requirement
should depend on the major.
"Yes if you were a computer
science major," said a junior
Anthropology major. "No for
other students," he said.
By far, however, the majority
of students objected to a re
quirement on financial
grounds. Even those students
who thought the requirement
a good idea felt that the finan
cial burden of requiring stu
dents to make the purchase
was too great
One student majoring in
Psychology responded that "at
this point, personal computers
are too expensive. But eventu
ally, you won't need to require
them."
He may be right. According
to Mike Rain, a salesman at
Computerland, personal com
puters can cost anywhere from
$100 for a Timex Sinclair 1000

with one byte of memory to
$10,000 to $20,000 for a highly
sophisticated IBM system. A
typical student, he suggested,
could put together a very de-

cent system right now for
about $1500 to $2000.
Although prices of personal
computer systems aren t com
ing down, Kain said that what
the consumer gets for his
money is increasing all the
time. Personal computers on
the lower once end may soon

have all the capability a student
needs.
What's more, over the next
two years, the Stanford Uni
versity Network (SUNet) is

scheduled to become opera
tional, making the use ot per
sonal computers even more at
tractive than it is now. SUNet, a
broad-band, coaxial cable sys
tem, will run around the busi
ness end of the campus, link
ing all the cabled entities to the
central computer system at CIT

and to each other.
lacks installed in the dorm
rooms will allow students to
hook up their personal com
puters to the SUNet system.
Once on-line, students will be
able to access data bases any
where on the campus, utilize
memory storage or printing
centers, and send and receive
messages.
Jacks are already installed in
the newer dorms that have just
been built, said Paul Kaufman,
a member of the University's
Task Force Steering Committee
on Cable Television. The Uni
versity is working out an ar
rangement with the City of Palo
Alto whereby the city would in
troduce cable into the older
dorms and faculty residences,
he said, enablingthese residents
to hookup to SUNet, also.
Once SUNet is operational,
students might be able to write
a paper on their terminal in
their dorm in the evening, then
pick up a laser-printed copy at
a printing center in the morn
ing on their way to class.
Try that with lawn chairs and
a blender.

Although Knight and
McConnell were among the

buy their own personal com

winter quarter by a journalism

puter. It's a trend that is
spreading from technology-

oriented programs to the
humanities.
At the American Studies
House, where most of the stu

Computers started coming
to college in a big way this past
September, according to an ar
ticle in Electronics Magazine:

At Stevens Institute of
Technology in Hoboken, New
Jersey, all the incoming
freshmen in science and sys
tems planning were required
to purchase an Atari 800 for
$747.
At Carnegie-Mellon Univer
sity in Pittsburgh, the adminis
tration is reportedly consider
ing buying 8000 personal com
puters for students and faculty.
At Clarkson College of
Technology in Potsdam, New
York, the trustees |ust agreed
upon a plan to hand out per
sonal computers to all incom
ing 1983 freshmen for a one
time deposit of $200 arid a
charge of $200 each semester.
The article speculated that
"other colleges with strong
technology programs such as
Stanford University . . .will fol
low suit with similar student
computer plans."
According to Ralph Gorin,
Director of Stanford's LOTS
computer facility, "at this in
stant, there is no such plan."
If there were, it seems a
good bet that studpnts would
not welcome the plan with
open arms.
The survey found that stu
dents here would oppose a re
quirement that they purchase a
personal computer at their
own expense by a margin of
more than four to one.
The hypothetical question
asked students how they
would feel if a requirement
similar to those instituted at
Stevens Institute of Technol
ogy and Carnegie-Mellon were
instituted at Stanford.
Responses ranged from
one-word answers of the four
letter variety to cryptic one
liners. "I'd go to UCLA," one
male graduate student wrote
A few students objected to
the fact of computers per se. "I
cherish my right to ignore
computers," one freshman
wrote.
Some students wrote that
with thp statp-of- f he irt im
proving constantly, ( omputers
required freshman year would
be outdated by the time those
students graduated. "The next
generation of personals will be
far superior to those ot today,"

wrote one graduate student in
Education.
Other students objected on
the grounds that "Stanford
University is still a liberal arts
university." Still others
thought such a requirement
should depend on the major.
"Yes if you were a computer
science major," said a junior
Anthropology major. "No for
other students," he said.
By far, however, the majority
of students objected to a re
quirement on financial
grounds. Even those students
who thought the requirement
a good idea felt that the finan
cial burden of requiring stu
dents to make the purchase
was too great
One student majoring in
Psychology responded that "at
this point, personal computers
are too expensive. But eventu
ally, you won't need to require
them."
He may be right. According
to Mike Rain, a salesman at
Computerland, personal com
puters can cost anywhere from
$100 for a Timex Sinclair 1000

with one byte of memory to
$10,000 to $20,000 for a highly
sophisticated IBM system. A
typical student, he suggested,
could put together a very de-

cent system right now for
about $1500 to $2000.
Although prices of personal
computer systems aren t com
ing down, Kain said that what
the consumer gets for his
money is increasing all the
time. Personal computers on
the lower once end may soon

have all the capability a student
needs.
What's more, over the next
two years, the Stanford Uni
versity Network (SUNet) is

scheduled to become opera
tional, making the use ot per
sonal computers even more at
tractive than it is now. SUNet, a
broad-band, coaxial cable sys
tem, will run around the busi
ness end of the campus, link
ing all the cabled entities to the
central computer system at CIT

and to each other.
lacks installed in the dorm
rooms will allow students to
hook up their personal com
puters to the SUNet system.
Once on-line, students will be
able to access data bases any
where on the campus, utilize
memory storage or printing
centers, and send and receive
messages.
Jacks are already installed in
the newer dorms that have just
been built, said Paul Kaufman,
a member of the University's
Task Force Steering Committee
on Cable Television. The Uni
versity is working out an ar
rangement with the City of Palo
Alto whereby the city would in
troduce cable into the older
dorms and faculty residences,
he said, enablingthese residents
to hookup to SUNet, also.
Once SUNet is operational,
students might be able to write
a paper on their terminal in
their dorm in the evening, then
pick up a laser-printed copy at
a printing center in the morn
ing on their way to class.
Try that with lawn chairs and
a blender.

Senior Mike Boone had the
first personal computer in the
house. He let several of his
housemates experiment with
his system on a term paper or
two. Before long, they were
hooked.
By winter quarter this year,
there were four personal com
puters at work in Adelfa in
Lagunita Court.
'We saw how great Mike's
computer was," personal
computer owner, Alex Knight
said, "and we all wanted one."
'It's just a question of
whether or not they can afford
one."
Knight, a freshman majoring
in economics and communica
tion, uses his IBM personal
computer for term papers, re
sumes and form letters. "It's a
great tool," he said. "It's faster,

the papers look betterand it's a
lot more efficient."
His IBM personal computer
features a word processing
program that is easy to use and
easy for Knight to explain to his
friends. "I'm not really inclined
technically," said Knight,
though he plans to write some
unsophisticated programs for
such chores as balancing his
checkbook.
