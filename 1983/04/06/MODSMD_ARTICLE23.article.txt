# Students volunteer at local hospitals
## 
### ELISE CHAPIN 
Sixty children with terminal
or chronic diseases could
make for a depressing atmos
phere. Yet this is apparently
not the case at the Children's
Hospital at Stanford, since 150
people — including 100 Stan
ford students — are currently
volunteering their time to work
with the patients.
For University students who
volunteer their time at CHS,
work has provided them with
an opportunity to learn about
patient care and hospital or
ganization.
Shannon Johnson, the vol
unteer coordinator at CHS,
said the volunteers can v\ork in
many different areas of the
hospital, including the hospital
school, the information desk,
occupational therapy, outpa
tient clinic information, recrea
tional therapy, transportation,
the psychosomatic unit, nurs
ing, physical therapy, clerical
projects and the Ronald
McDonald House for the
families of sick children.
CHS volunteers work for
three hours each week in one
of the different departments in
the hospital. When they sign
up, volunteers must be pre
pared to work for six months at
a time.
In order to work at the hospi
tal, prospective volunteers
must attend an orientation
meeting held the first Wed
nesday night nf each month.
There they a r e prepared for
what will be expected of them
as volunteers. Pictures of pa
tients who have had radiation
therapy or who have "body
parts that might be a little bit
different" are shown during
the slide show, Johnson said.
Daryn Kagan, a sophomore
majoring in American Studies
and communication , said the
slide shov. nade her "stomach
turnabit'uutdid not deter her
from sig dg up.
After .ne meeting, students
arrangt appointments with
Johnsor to determine a con
venieni ime and area for vol
unteer v ->rk. "The determin
ing factor tor most volunteers

is their schedule," Johnson
said. Although most CHS vol
unteers are students, about 50
of the 150 volunteers hold full
time jobs.
Most of the 100 students are
pre-meds, Johnson said. She
said that most medical schools
require hospital experience for
admission.
Ed Swenson, a junior major
ing in human biology, began
working at CHS in order to see
how a hospital worked. But
since then he has found that the
work has helped him define his
career.
A recreation therapy worker,
Swenson spends most of his
Friday night time setting up
and supervising a planned ac
tivity. If there is no activity,
Swenson does "bedside'work
which may include helping pa
tients with homework, playing
checkers or |ust watching tele
vision and talking.
When asked about his reac
tion to some of the patients, he
said, "Some of the kids are in
pretty bad shape and they look
like hell. Sure vou feel (uncom
fortable), but you can't show
it."
Swenson encouraged mem
bers of his dorm to visit CHS on
Halloween. He is again plan
ning to have the dorm go with
patients to a pizza parlor in the
near future. Members of the
dorm, who had only been a.
the hospital for a few hours,
said they felt sympathy for the
patients and many suggested
that the dorm return to the
hospital for another function.
"The reactions of the patients
were especially moving," Les
lie Durboraw said.
Kagan, who began working
last spring, had had no previ
ous experience as a hospital
worker. She works in the oc
cupational therapy deparment
"helping kids do things for
themselves and feeling good
about themselves."
Kagan said she began work
ing because she "really likes
kids and finds that's one aspect
of the University that's mis
sing."
After spending the first half

of her hours in bedside work,
Kagan spends the rest of the
time in the recreation room.
"It's your own attitude' Kagan
said, that makes the experi
ence at CHS productive
"The atmosphere of the
hospital is very positive, very
much toward living, not dy
ing," she added.
But because some patients at
CHS eventually die, the volun
teers must learn to cope with
the loss of a patient. Swenson
said the hospital does not
"want you to get too attat hed
to anyone because of the reac
tion you may have when
someone dies."
Johnson said the loss ian
lead to a "burned-out situa
tion" and a reluctance to re
turn.
"You can't look at it like
you've lost something, but
you've gained something be
cause of what you gave them
while they were alive," Kagan
said.
