## Stanford now 25-6 Cardinal 9 crush Cossaks 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Stanford repaired its dikes after a one
game flood and rapped out 11 hits yester
day, bombarding Sonoma State 14-3.
Stanford, now 25-b overall and 8-1 con
ference, scored earlv and often, but never
pulled away until it exploded for six runs in
the seventh inning off three Cossak pitch
ers. Sonoma State used four pitchers on
the afternoon.
Gregg Lomnicky, now 2-0, pitched
seven innings, giving up two runs on five
hits for the win. John Radtke pitched two
innings of scoreless relief.
"I'm real happy that Lomnicky and
Radtke came back. That shows his (Radt
ke's) arm is strong again," said Stanford
coach Mark Marquess. "We played good
defense today. We had a little lapse (Mon
day) when we didn't play good defense,
but we played well today."
Mike Aldrete paced the Stanford of
fense with a solo home run in the fifth, two

runs hatted in and four runs scored.
Third baseman Vince Sakowski had
three hits and four RBl's offensively and
anchored the defense with seven assists.
The Cardinal opened the scoring early
when Pete Stanicek opened the first in
ning with a double into the right
centerfield gap. Mark Davis lined out to
right before Aldrete walked. Stantord exe
cuted a perfect double steal with the run
ners moving up to second and third before
Sakowski doubled down the left field line
to drive in two runs.
The Cardinal added single runs in the
second and fifth innings. In the crucial
seventh, Stanicek opened with a walk.
Mark Davis doubled to the left and Aldrete
and Sakowski followed with consecutive
RBI singles to left.
With runners on first and second, re
liever Terry Kintz balked to move both
runners up. Rick Lundblade struck out and
Kintz walked Mike Dotterer intentionally
to load the bases. Greg Lorenzetti drove in

two runs with a single to center and desig
nated hitter Mike Deßenon finished the
scoring with a RBI single to right.
Deßenon replaced Eric Hardgrave, who
has a muscle spasm in his back.
Hardgrave, who leads the nation in home
runs and RBl's, is expected to be back for
this weekend's series against UC-
Berkeley.
Stanford added four runs in the eighth
as reliever Ethan McHenry walked four
batters, mainly pinch-hitters, and gave up a
double to Sakowski.
Sonoma State scored single runs in the
second, fifth and ninth innings. Phil OU
brantz hit a solo home run in the fifth and
Bill Fitzpatric k tripled in the ninth and
scord on a ground ball to shortstop.
Starting pitcher Kevin McGaughy was
tagged with the loss for Sonoma State,
whose record dropped to 3-23.
The series opens Friday at Cal at 2:30
p.m. with Saturday's game at Sunken
Diamond at 1 p.m.
