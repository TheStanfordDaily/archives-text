Giants lose opener
San Francisco — Garry Templeton
drove in four runs and scored three and
pitcher Tim Lollar helped himself with
three runs batted in as the San Diego
Padres spoiled San Francisco's Opening
Day yesterday with a 16-13 victory.
The Padres pounded six Giants
pitchers for 17 hits, eight of them in a
eight-run fifth inning. Lollar pitched
the first five innings, giving up six runs
and eight of San Francisco's 16 hits.
Giants' pitcher Mike Krukow was the
loser.
The wild opener before a crowd of
49,519 was spiced by five home runs —
four by the Giants — and seven
doubles. It was the highest scoring
Opening Day in the Giants' 100-year
history.
A's opener spoiled, too
Oakland — Andre Thornton hit a
three-run homer on his first swing of
the season and the Cleveland Indians
gave their new manager, Mike Ferraro,
an 8-5 victory over the Oakland A's in
their American League opener Monday
night.
Toby Harrah led the Indians'ls hit-at
tack with four and Rick Manning and
Ron Hassey added three apiece, ruining
the major league managerial debut of
Oakland's Steve Boros.
Cleveland scored its first five runs off
Rick Langford, who took the loss and
failed in his fifth attempt at an opening
game victory. Winner Rick Sutcliffe
pitched 61-3 innings in his first open
ing-day start.
The Indians built a 5-1 lead before
rookie Kelvin Moore hit a two-run
homer off Sutcliffe in the sixth.
Rickey Henderson, who set a major

league record with 130 stolen bases last
season, walked to open the bottom of
the first, swiped second and scored on
Dwayne Murphy's two-out double.
Oakland's final two runs came in the
seventh when Henderson beat out an
infield single, Mike Davis tripled and
Murphy singled.
Dan Spi liner, the Indians' third
pitcher of the night picked up the save.
Seaver outduels Carlton
New York — Tom Seaver pitched six
shutout innings and Mike Howard's
seventh-inning single off Steve Carlton
ended a scoreless duel and lifted the
New York Mets to a 2-0 victory yester
day over the Philadelphia Phillies in
their 1983 National League opener.
Seaver, making his record-tying 14th
career Opening-Day start, allowed just
three singles through six innings before
leaving the game with a strained left
thigh, a recurrence of a late spring
training injury. The Mets batted for him
in the bottom of the sixth, then rookie
Doug Sisk took over.
Sisk, who appeared in only eight
games last season with the Mets, al
lowed two hits and two walks and struck
out three batters the rest of the way for
his first major-league victory.
NC State returns home
Raleigh, N.C. — North Carolina State
basketball coach Jim Valvano led his
NCAA champion Wolfpack home yes
terday to the cheers of a standing
room-only crowd of 15,500 at Reynolds
Coliseum.
Hoisting a bottle of champagne given
to him by a fan, Valvano wasted little
time giving the crowd a part of what it
wanted.
"You've heard of Phi Slama Jama,"
Valvano said. "Let me introduce you to
Phi Pack Attacka."
Phi Slama Jama was the name Hous
ton had given its "fraternity" of dunkers
in honor of its practice of dunking
shots, hard and often. But in Monday's
54-52 Wolfpack victory, the Cougar
fraternity had only one dunk.

"What time is it?" Valvano asked,
then lifting his arm and tugging at his
sleeve. "Let's look at our championship
watches."
The crowd started gathering long
before the Wolfpack's flight from Albu
querque and the Final Four had landed
at Raleigh-Durham Airport, nearly 20
miles from Reynolds Coliseum. By 4
p.m., officials estimated 12,000 were on
hand.
Cheerleaders and a band kept the
crowd busy most of that time, and the
curious had several banners to read.
Once, when the band struck up "The
Stripper," a student in a box high above
the floor began taking off clothes, stop
ping at his underwear.
The gathering was peaceful and or
ganized, unlike Monday night's cele
bration when 25,000 people partied
from the Brickyard, an area in the cen
ter of the campus, out into Hill
sborough Street.
Hu Na granted asylum
San Francisco — Chinese tennis
player Hu Na says she is "happy and re
lieved" at finally winning asylum and
starting a new life in the United States,
but fearful for the safety of her parents
in China.
The decision Monday to grant sanc
tuary to the 19-year-old defector after
BV2 months of delay prompted an angry
response from Chinese officials, who
said the "grave incident" would harm
political ties and sports and cultural ex
changes with the United States.
Miss Hu has said she decided to de
fect after refusing to join the Com
munist Party and receiving a threaten
ing letter from a high Chinese official.
In Peking today, a spokesman for the
Chinese tennis association said the case
definitely would affect cultural and
sports exchanges.
China, which has been more vocal in
this case than in any previous defection,
has demanded Miss Hu's return since
she slipped away from her hotel at the
32-nation Federation Cup tournament
in Santa Clara, Calif., last July 20.
