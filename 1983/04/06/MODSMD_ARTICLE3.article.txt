Satellite needs correction
Cape Canaveral, Florida — The world's biggest and
costliest communicationssatellite, launched with fan
fare from the space shuttle Challenger, traveled a mis
shapen orbit yesterday as experts on the ground tried
to improvise ways to salvage it. They voiced hope for
success.
The new shuttle, meanwhile, was coasting like a
seasoned traveler around the Earth. Its astronauts,
quietly busy with metals processing and other scien
tific experiments, wondered if they had anything to
do with the satellite's problems.
"We don't really have a story for you," said Mission
ControU'We'll probably be talking a lot about that
post-flight."

Plans were to use the satellite's nozzles and the fuel
it carries for small course corrections, to propel the
satellite into its proper 22,300-mile-high orbit.
The makers of the satellite and the rocket were
meeting with NASA engineers to decide when and
how to do that. The decision could take days.
A lot was riding on overcoming the problems with
the 2V2-ton, $100 million Tracking and Data Relay Sat
ellite (TDRS), which is needed urgently both for de
fense purposes and future missions of the shuttle.
Without TDRS, a spacelab flight in September is prac
tically an impossibility.
Challenger commander Paul Weitz and his
crewmen, pilot Karol Bobko and mission specialists
Story Musgrave and Donald Peterson, who had
ejected the satellite from their cargo bay late Mon
day, were asleep when the trouble began. They were
in the second day of the ship's five-day inaugural
flight.
"The Challenger is operating near flawlessly," said
flight director Randy Stone at a morning briefing.
"The crew is feeling fine."
Reagan to propose spending cuts
Washington — President Reagan intends to ask
Congress to reduce spending by about $900 million
next year to offset part of the cost of the $4.6 billion
jobs bill he signed last month, officials said yesterday.
Administration and congressional officials said the
president would submit the formal request next week
when he submits budget revisions for the 1984 fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1.
The disclosures came as Reagan arranged an after
noon meeting with Republican members of the Sen
ate Budget Committee to discuss his proposed 1984
tax and spending plan.
Most of the discussion was expected to center
around the president's proposed defense budget,
which Sen. Pete Domenici, the committee chairman,
and many other GOP lawmakers believe must be cut.
Sources said Domenici used a 10-day congressional
vacation to develop and submit to the White House a
revised budget blueprint calling for defense spending
increases averaging about 7 percent after inflation for
the next five years.
The 7 percent figure is significantly above the 5 per
cent spending increase Domenici favored earlier in
the year, but well below Reagan's original proposal,
which called for about a 10 percent increase.
There were no precise estimates in advance of the
meeting of how much Domenici's new proposal
would trim Reagan's spending request. But based on
recent statements from administration officials, it
would fall far short of satisfying the president.
Freak storm hits L.A. area
Anaheim, Calif. — Tornado-like winds, lightning
and rain roared through Southern California yester
day, ripping off roofs, knocking out power and stran
ding nearly 100 visitors on rides high above the Dis
neyland amusement park, authorities said.
One Thousand Oaks man was struck by lightning
during the freak storm that swirled across the Los An
geles area and authorities had an unconfirmed report
that a man was blown through a window in Orange
thrope. There were no other immediate reports of in
jury.
"With the lightning striking, he was walking down
the driveway and boom, a lightning bolt him him,"
said Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Hank Carrillo. "He is
severely burned ... in critical condition."
"Tornado-like" winds slammed into Disneyland at
about 1:15, knocking out power to People Mover and
Sky Tower rides, said Anaheim Fire Department In
spector Norm Morgan.
A strong burst of wind slammed into a Skyway gon
dola, which traverses the sprawling amusement park
on a cable 30 to 40 feet above the ground. A cable was
jerked out of the guide wheel and the ride im
mediately shut down, said Disneyland spokesman Joe
Aguirre.

"We have four ladder trucks down there in the
process of taking people down," said Morgan, noting
that there had been no reports of injuries at the park,
located about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
Aguirre said Disneyland cherry-pickers, used to
trim trees, were also used in the rescue.
"We had to close off some of the 'Tomorrowland'
area to let fire engines through — the submarine at
traction, the monorail, America Sings and the Mat
terhorn. All other attractions are operating on the
park."
Winds also pummelled an industrial complex on
the northeast side of the Anaheim near Orange
thorpe Avenue and Raymond Avenue, tearing off the
roof of at least one building, Beteag said.
Morgan described the winds as "very sharp, with
lightning and thunder along with it. I'd say they were
gusting up around 40 or 50 mph."
Soviets expelled on spy charges
Paris — France's leftist government expelled about
50 Soviets on charges of espionage yesterday in the
biggest spy sweep in the nation's history.
The Soviet Embassy called the expulsions an un
justified political act by the government of President
Francois Mitterrand and said France would have to
bear all the negative consequences.
The Interior Ministry would not state the exact
number of Soviets who hastily left the country on a
special plane sent from Moscow.
But French news reports said 47 Soviet officials were
involved, including the third-ranking official at the
Soviet Embassy.They said 40 deportees were
diplomats, two were journalistsand five were officials
with Soviet commercial institutions in Paris.
The Interior Ministry said the Soviets were de
ported because of "systematic" espionage activites
"particularly in the military domain."
The French purge put a serious strain on Franco-So
viet relations, which have been steadily deteriorating
since the victory two years ago of Mitterrand's Social
ist government.
In January, the U.S. State Department said that
"based on publicly available information, 49 Soviet
officials were expelled worldwide in 1982, up from 27
in 1981."
In recent weeks, Western European governments
have expelled more than a dozen Soviet diplomatic
personnel and journalists for espionage activities.
Stocks continue falling
Stock prices fell for the third straight session yester
day, reversing early gains, as traders appeared to
shrug off a central banker's assessment that long-term
interest rates are ripe for further declines.
Analysts said a setback among technology issues
spilled over to other stocks amid lingering uncertain
ty about the course of an economic recovery.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with highs in the mid-60s to
mid-70s and lows in the 40s. Northeast winds 10 to 20
mph today.
