Satellite needs correction
Cape Canaveral, Florida â€” The world's biggest and
costliest communicationssatellite, launched with fan
fare from the space shuttle Challenger, traveled a mis
shapen orbit yesterday as experts on the ground tried
to improvise ways to salvage it. They voiced hope for
success.
The new shuttle, meanwhile, was coasting like a
seasoned traveler around the Earth. Its astronauts,
quietly busy with metals processing and other scien
tific experiments, wondered if they had anything to
do with the satellite's problems.
"We don't really have a story for you," said Mission
ControU'We'll probably be talking a lot about that
post-flight."

Plans were to use the satellite's nozzles and the fuel
it carries for small course corrections, to propel the
satellite into its proper 22,300-mile-high orbit.
The makers of the satellite and the rocket were
meeting with NASA engineers to decide when and
how to do that. The decision could take days.
A lot was riding on overcoming the problems with
the 2V2-ton, $100 million Tracking and Data Relay Sat
ellite (TDRS), which is needed urgently both for de
fense purposes and future missions of the shuttle.
Without TDRS, a spacelab flight in September is prac
tically an impossibility.
