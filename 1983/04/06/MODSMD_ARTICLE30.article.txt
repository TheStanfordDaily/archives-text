# Strikers face No. 1 Hawaii
## 
### 
The men's volleyball team certainly will have
its hands full tonight when it takes on No.
1-ranked Hawaii in Maples Pavilion at 7:30.
Hawaii has an 8-2 California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association (CIVA) record and re
cently twice beat the team it replaced atop the
national rankings — UC-Santa Barbara.
Stanford, meanwhile, lost to second-ranked
UCLA in four sets Friday afternoon at Maples,
dropping its conference mark to 2-11. The Card
sits in eighth place in the nine-team league.
Although the Hawaii match may seem to be

the mis-match of the century, Stanford coach
Fred Sturm said he thinks otherwise. "To win, it
will take our best performance of the year.
"They (Hawaii) are probably the most consis
tent team in the conference. They really don't
have one weakness," he said.
The last time the Cardinal met Hawaii, it con
trolled the match for the first 2Vi sets before
losing in four, 15-7, 5-15, 15-8, 15-7.
"When we get the ball, we have to control it,"
Sturm said. "They (Hawaii) can be beaten, it's
just that they don't beat themselves."
