# Hewlett-Packard head warns against foreign competition
## 
### SID ATKINS Senior staff writer 
The United States will maintain its
worldwide supremacy in electronics
and other high technology fields
only if it can "take action and alter
the current flow of events," the pres
ident of Hewlett-Packard Corpora
tion told an overflow crowd of more
than 400 in Bishop Auditorium yes
terday.
"We cannot automatically and ef
fortlessly maintain our lead," said
John Young, president and chief
executive officer of the Palo Alto
based electronics firm. "We cannot
let our high technology industry go
the way our other industries have."
Young told the packed house that
while the United States has done
very well in the global electronics
market, its market share has begun
to slip. "Electronics is considered a
vital industry to the economic well
being of many nations, and they are
all pursuing programs to strengthen
themselves."
In recent years, according to
Young, Japan has gone from control
ling 4 percent of the world elec
tronics market to 12 percent, and
their national goal is to take over 18
percent of the current U.S. market.
Young, who graduated from the
Business School in 1958, said that
other countries were pursuing the

goal of national self-sufficiency in
electronics as well. "France wants a
two-and-one-half-fold increase in
electronics production by 1990, and
they are creating a set of new na
tional schools in each brand of elec
tronics." The United Kingdom and
West Germany have taken similar
measures, Young said.
To remain in the forefront of the
industry, Young advised that the
United States make sure there are
enough technically trained people in
this country to fill the necessary jobs.
He said that lapan produces two and

one-halt times as many engineers per
capita as we do.
"There are enough students in
terested in engineering, but our uni
versities simply do not have the ca
pacity to teach them," he said. "We
should be looking to expand the
number of Ph.D.s in the sciences
who will go on to teach."
Young cited research and devel
opment as "another strength to build
on" in order to assure U.S. predomi
nance. He said that the U.S. research
budget in the federal, university and
private sectors totals around $83 bil
lion, but the rate of spending is grow
ing at a much slower rate that in the
competing countries.
Young said that universities have
played a key role in conducting basic
science and that this role
needs to be strengthened.
With regard to other governmental
trade policies, Youngwarned that we
should not try to meet international
challenges by encouraging protec
tionism.
Throughout his talk, Young em
phasized the importance of the elec
tronics industry in general, which he
said accounts for more than 50 per
cent of current U.S. exports. Py the
year 2000, studies indicate that the
industry will be the second largest in
the country, trailing only health care.
