# University may get Reagan's library, decision in weeks
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
The University is currently study
ing the feasibility of housing Ronald
Reagan's presidential library here.
"We're looking at some questions
of academic feasibility and site loca
tion," University President Donald
Kennedy said yesterday. The studies
will probably be completed in a
"matter of weeks," he said.
In general, the University is en
thusiastic about the possibility of
having the Reagan library here,"
Kennedy said.
"We certainly want presidential
papers," he said, adding that they are
a "very important scholarly re
source."
Discussions between the Univer
sity and the White House concerning
the Reagan library began two years
ago when W. Glenn Campbell, di
rector of the Hoover Institution, in
vited Reagan to house his presiden
tial papers here.
"The invitation has been extended
to the president of the United States
to have his library here," Richard
Burress, associate director of the In
stitution, said. "He (Reagan) has re
plied that he's interested in explor
ing it."
Kennedy indicated that the admin
istration is more than just "in
terested" in Stanford.
"They (the administration) are
prepared to let the papers come here
if we provide the site," he said.
A White House official said it was
"too early" to release any informa
tion about the chances of having the
Reagan library here.

Campbell was out of the country
and unavailable for comment.
Kennedy said the government
would finance the cost of mainte
nance for the library. The capital cost
of the library would be provided by
donors who are interested in having
the library come here, he said.
Presidential papers must be lo
cated in an "approved archival de
pository," Burress said, which "very
well could" involve building a new
structure on campus, possibly near
Hoover Tower.
Kent Peterson, associate vice pres
ident for business and finance, has
been examining possible sites for the
library. The location for a presiden
tial library would depend on how
much academic interest there was
within the University, and how many
outside visitors the library would at
tract, he said.
Vice Provost Ray Bacchetti has
been interviewing faculty members
to determine the "academic value"
of having the library here. The schol
ars have told him the degree of inter
est in the library would depend on
the breadth of the material in the pa
pers, Bacchetti said.
Because of the president's "asso
ciation with the Hoover Institution,"
it is logical that he would choose
Stanford for the location of his presi
dential library, Burress said.
The Hoover Institution currently
holds Reagan's papers from his years
as the governor of California, from
his presidential campaigns and from
the transition period prior to his in
auguration as president. Reagan is
also an honorary fellow.
