# Freshman applicants get answer
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
The envelope, please. . .
That's what more than 14,000 high
school seniors are saying as they im
patiently await the arrival of their
local mailman. Letters of accep
tance to—and rejection from —
Stanford's Class of '87 were sealed,
metered and mailed yesterday by a
bleary-eyed admissions staff.
"I'd be very surprised if this wasn't
as powerful a group as we've ever
seen, both in terms of academic and
non-academic accomplishments,"
said Dean of Admissions Fred Harga
don.
"I think it was probably the tough
est set of decisions I ever made," he
said. "I don't think I've ever sweated
so much."
Hargadon and his staff perused a
record number of applications this
year. Of the 14,552 hopefuls—up
more than 500 from the previous
high two years ago—24oo were ad
mitted.
"We're expecting about 64 percent
will come (just more than 1500),
based on what has happened in past
years," Hargadon said. "If more than
that come I'm in trouble. At that
point is when I will take a vacation,"
he quipped, referring to his annual
April trek.
Hargadon noted that "a record
number of minority students have
been admitted," although he stres
sed that this was not the outcome of a
conscious or preconceived effort. "It
was just a very strong group.'' This is
the second consecutive year that
minority admission has hit a new
high.
Although the letters were mailed
five days late, prospective freshmen
will still receive Stanford's decision
more than a week before Ivy League
universities inform their class. This,
according to Hargadon, is not in
tended to give Stanford an advan
tage, but to give the students as
much time as possible for their deci
sions.
"We do it because we think stu
dents need that amount of time to
really sort out what is a very impor
tant decision,' Hargadon said. "We

tried to convince the Ivies to move
up to April 1 too so that the student
has a chance to evaluate all the op
tions." The Ivy League schools agree
to wait until the slowest school is
ready before mailing their replies,
and then they send all their decisions
at the same time.
Hargadon said he is now "waiting
for the phone to ring." Because more
than 13,000 students were turned
down, there are bound to be some
inquisitive or irate people out there.
"I just try and respond to each one as
they come in; be pleasant with the
pleasant ones and straightforward
with the unpleasant ones," he said.
While the dean declined to give
exact tigures on geographical distri

bution, financial aid and SAT
scores—"l'll know more about that
after the computer has worked on
it"—he did express his enthusiasm
for the class.
"As usual, I'm very humbled. It
seems to me we had a very good
year. Cod, I was overwhelmed."
Despite statistics that show a de
cline in student talent as measured
by aptitude and achievement tests,
Hargadon noted that this class does
not follow the trend. "What's hap
pening nationwide is not happening
here," he said.
Indeed, Stanford's record number
of applicants came in a year when
volume fell at Yale, Harvard, Prince
ton and Dartmouth.
