# ASSU reprieves Speakers Bureau
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
In an 11th-hour decision, the ASSU Senate voted last
night to reverse an election commission ruling and to
place the Speakers Bureau fee assessment request on
next week's election ballot.
Despite the fact that the Speakers Bureau submitted
the signatures of more than 10 percent of the student
body as required by ASSU election rules, it filed a form
declaring its intention to participate in the election one
day too late. The election commission had ruled last
month that the Speakers Bureau would not be permitted
a spot on the ballot because of this.
Craig Spearman, election commission chairman, ar
gued against making an exception. He said, "You made a
set of rules in lanuary. I told you at that time that you
were constraining yourself. The commission has fol
lowed your rules to the letter. The election commission

feels that any exceptions made for the Speakers Bureau
must he made for all candidates."
The senate considered calling a special meeting to
change the election rules and allow the Speakers Bureau
to he placed on the ballot but then opted for a second
alternative proposed by Council of Presidents (COP)
member Mark Epstein. He pointed to a provision in the
ASSU by-laws which allows the senate to place fee as
sessment requests on the ballot if the group requesting
the assessment was not able to meet the requirements of
the election rules because of "extenuating circum
stances."
Epstein said, "If you believe there are extenuating
circumstances, then you have the right to place the
Speakers Bureau on the ballot. Both deadlines (petition
and declaration deadlines) fell on the same day which
was not the original intention and as a result there was
no way for the commission to be able to assess the
completeness of the packet."
Graduate senator Eric Berg argued that the senate had
a responsibility to make a provision for the Speakers
Bureau: "I find it hard to believe that this kind of techni
cality would prevent this service from being made avail
able to students. This senate is going to look pretty bad if
it lets the Speakers Bureau crumble."
In response, Senator Roc Blumenthal said, "The fact is
we are playing games with things by making this in
terpretation."
In the proposal eventually passed by the senate, the
Speakers Bureau was directed to pay for any additional
costs incurred by the late decision to place its request on
the ballot. Ballots for next weeks ASSU elections have
already been printed and will have to be reprinted.
In other action, the senate approved a controversial
$155,553 budget for the association fee assessment. The
budget far surpasses any amount previously allocated to
the association assessment. This assessment distributes
funds to groups which are not large enough to qualify
for a specific fee assessment.
Among the budget items questioned and eventually
passed by the senators were $1500 for a developing

nations film series, $850 for the Stanford Transcenden
tal Meditation Club, $1350 for the Black Media Institute,
$800 for the Stanford Islamic Society, $650 for the Demo
cratic Socialists of America, $1250 for the El Centro
Community Activities Board and $4000 for Volunteers in
Asia.
The senate voted to shift $5000 originally allocated for
the Stanford Independent to a budget item labeled
"other publications." In an effort to keep closer watch
over finances, the ASSU (through the Publications
Board) will most likely distribute funds to the Indepen
dent on a quarterly basis.
