In an effort to combat rising costs,
the University has slashed 4.5 per
cent from the 1983-84 operations and
maintenance budget.
"The impact will be felt through
response times to certain emergen
cies," said lames Horgan, director of
operations and maintenance.
"Without the cut I would have less of
a worry about meeting my commit
ments."
He said the University will experi
ence "an adjustment period" when
the cuts go into effect next year and
noted increasing demands on his de
partment. "Basically the demands
are going up while our resources are
going down," he said.
Horgan stressed that operations
and maintenance will continue to
provide similar service despite the
cuts, a $317,416 reduction from the
total budget base of $7,309,451. "I
don't think it's going to be anything
serious," he said. "We would still re
spond to any real emergency."
Ray Bacchetti, director of Univer

sity budgets, said, "There may be
some layoffs" in operations and
maintenance "but those layoffs will
be very slight." He stressed that most
ot the cuts "will take place in other
areas."
In deciding where to make budget
reductions, Bacchetti noted that the
University "tried to look at places
where there would be the least pos
sible consequences."
John Listinsky, field representative
for United Stanford Workers Local
715, said the University hadn't an
nounced any layoffs despite the cuts.
"We're not sure what's going to hap
pen," he said. "The University has a
very strong record of not laying off
people. We're just trying to resolve
people's fears about losing their
jobs."
Karen Bennett, management assis
tant in the Office of Financial Plan
ning, claimed the operations and
maintenance cuts "could have some
noticeable impact on the Univer
sity," especially "on emergency re
sponse systems on certain areas of
the campus." She said the smaller

budget "was proposed to have as
minor impact as possible on the Uni
versity."
In addition to reductions of
$52,000 in grounds and $2300 in
elevator maintenance, custodial con
tracts will be cut by $90,000. Litter
and trash will be collected three in
stead of five times per week in all
campus areas except the au
ditoriums. Floor cleaning in offices
and administrative areas will be re
duced from twice to once weekly.
Other cuts affect plumbing, roof and
gutter systems, steam, ventilation
and electric power.
The operations and maintenance
cuts are part of a total University
budget determined in mid-lanuary at
a special retreat attended by various
University administrators and finan
cial officers. According to Bennett,
each area of operations and mainte
nance was asked to submit plans to
shave 6 percent off its individual
operating budget. The resulting total
reduction of 4.5 percent has been
approved by the University.
