# Senior serves term for antinuke protest, has no regrets

### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Ten days in jail wasn't what senior Paul Hodgdon had
in mind when he traveled south after finals week to take
part in the anti-nuclear protest at Vandenberg Air Force
Base.
But Hodgdon accepted the sentence he received for
trespassing twice on the air force base northeast of Los
Angeles, and did not regret his actions. Normally he
wouldn't condone breaking the law, Hodgdon said, but
this time he was forced to for a "higher moral reason."
More than 700 demonstrators were arrested for tres
passing during the protest two weeks ago. The protes
ters opposed the testing of first-strike nuclear missiles at
Vandenberg and the effect of this testing on the inhabit
ants of the Pacific islands.
The non-violent protest was organized by the Van
denberg Action Coalition, an umbrella anti-nuclear or
ganization, and was attended by several Stanford stu
dents.
Hodgdon said the demonstrators were committed to
disrupting the missile testing because they fear that such
technology will lead to a further escalation in the arms
race. The effect of the protesters on the missile testing
was "probably none," Hodgdon admitted, but the pro
testers were able to call public attention to the practice.
Originally, the demonstration was intended to be a
protest specifically against the testing of MX missiles at
Vandenberg, but Congress has withheld funding for the
MX until a basing mode for the missile is found. The

protesters decided to proceed with the demonstration
anyway, to express their opposition to the testing of
first-strike missiles there. "We all plan to go back" when
and if the MX is eventually tested, Hodgdon said.
Hodgdon was arrested March 21 for trespassing on the
base and was released the next morning. He decided to
return to Vandenberg, and was arrested for the second
time on March 23.
Several first-time offenders who had been released
allowed themselves to be arrested again, Hodgdon said,
in order to build solidarity with the second-time offend
ers and to attract additional attention to the protest.
According to Hodgdon, the arrested demonstrators
used some tactics of non-cooperation with the officials.
"We didn't give our names," he said, mainly to keep
officials from dealing more harshly with the protest
leaders and second-time offenders.
At first, Hodgdon was placed in a gymnasium at the
Lompoc Federal Penitentiary for seven days with more
than 100 other anti-nuclear protesters. He was arraigned
last Tuesday and sentenced to 10 days, including time
already served. After his arraignment, Hodgdon was
transferred to the Terminal Island Federal Correctional
Institution in Los Angeles and released Friday.
The two prison experiences were very different,
Hodgdon said. Being in the gymnasium with 100 other
anti-nuclear activists was "inspiring," he said, but the
Terminal Island facility was "scary." He was able to cope
with the prison life "knowing I would be there for just a
short while."
