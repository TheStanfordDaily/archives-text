MODEL SR3100 $350°° I
1. Excellent electronic design with high specifications.
2. Has separate mid-range controls, as well as standard bass & treble
controls.
3. In stereo receivers, total harmonic distortion is audible when above .1%,
but this Marantz is way below that level at both 4 ohms and 8 ohms.
4. Has tuning meter and Dual Wattaae Meters.
5. Rear Jacks: Certified 24K Gold Plated. (Gold will not corrode or rust as
base metal can; and provides a much better electrical contact.)
6. Three year service policy.
7. Can be used with 4 ohm, 8 ohm, or 16 ohm speakers.
8. Marantz Co. headquarters are located at 20525 Nordhoff St.,Chatsworth,
Cal., U.S.
In our opinion, the MARANTZ is far superior to the Yamaha; but we realize
that not everyone can afford a MARANTZ Thus, if you're short of cash, buy
the Yamaha now, and then when you can afford it, TRADE UP TO MARANTZ.
