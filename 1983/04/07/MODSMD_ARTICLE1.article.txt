The Los Angeles Olympic Organiz
ing Committee (LAOOC) has
selected Stanford to host the 1984
Olympic soccer games.
"This could be a once-in-a
generation event," said Steven Rac
zynski, assistant sports information
director. "It's the first time an Olym

home of the 1984 Summer Olympics.
Raczynski said Stanford is one of
four sites that will accommodate
Olympic soccer in the summer of
1984. "Except for soccer, all the
Olympic events will be in the greater
Los Angeles area. Soccer is currently
scheduled to be played at Stanford,
the Rose Bowl, Harvard and An
napolis."

trying to maximize national and in

played at Stanford between |uly 29
and Aug. 8, 1984, including six pre
liminary, two quarter-final and one
semi-final match.
All games will be played in Stan
ford Stadium, which Raczynski said
will be equipped with a new lighting
system for improved television
coverage. "The same lighting system
