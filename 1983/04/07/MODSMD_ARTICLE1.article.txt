# Stanford to host Olympic soccer
## 
### TROY EID Staff writer 
The Los Angeles Olympic Organiz
ing Committee (LAOOC) has
selected Stanford to host the 1984
Olympic soccer games.
"This could be a once-in-a
generation event," said Steven Rac
zynski, assistant sports information
director. "It's the first time an Olym
pic event has been staged on the
Farm. It will put us in the interna
tional limelight."
Stanford will also host about 55
members of the Norwegian Olympic
Team during the summer of 1984, ac
cording to Lois Fariello, manager of
conferences. She said the University
will probably house "the entire
Norwegian boxing, track, gymnas
tics, bicycling, wrestling and swim
ming Olympic teams."
The Norwegian teams will proba
bly not compete at Stanford but will
use the University as a training center
to prepare for events in Los Angeles,
home of the 1984 Summer Olympics.
Raczynski said Stanford is one of
four sites that will accommodate
Olympic soccer in the summer of
1984. "Except for soccer, all the
Olympic events will be in the greater
Los Angeles area. Soccer is currently
scheduled to be played at Stanford,
the Rose Bowl, Harvard and An
napolis."
Raczynski was not certain why the
LAOOC selected the two East Coast
sites but suggested that "they may be
trying to maximize national and in
ternational television coverage."
A total of nine soccer games will be
played at Stanford between |uly 29
and Aug. 8, 1984, including six pre
liminary, two quarter-final and one
semi-final match.
All games will be played in Stan
ford Stadium, which Raczynski said
will be equipped with a new lighting
system for improved television
coverage. "The same lighting system
may be used to televise the Super
Bowl in January of 1985," he said.
Fariello said Stanford was asked to
host Olympic soccer partly because
of the overflow at other California
universities. She explained that
many schools in the Los Angeles
area, such as UCLA and USC, "are
packed with Olympic teams."
All of the soccer players will be

housed in Branner Hall from )uly 29
to Aug. 10, 1984. Fariello said secu
rity at Branner "will include guards
and possible temporary fences" but
that additional building modifica
tions probably will not be necessary.
The various Norwegian teams will
stay together in Alpha Sigma Phi in
the Cowell Cluster from July 18-27,
1984. The Norwegians have not re
quested University security, accord
ing to Fariello, and will use athletic
facilities "at Stanford and the sur
rounding areas."
