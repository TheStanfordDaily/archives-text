# INSIDE MEWS
## Computer praise: computer addicts' confessions 
### COLLEEN GILLARD 
At 17, Sean Welsh was hired
by Citibank of New York to
troubleshoot its new million
dollar computer. Welsh had no
high school diploma and had
just failed his first year of col
lege.
Welsh has this thing about
computers, which he ex
plained as the natural outcome
of a childhood love of things
mechanical and electronic. A
delight in "switches and flash
ing lights" had him already
primed for his first encounter
with computers in junior high.
At 24, Victoria Pigman was
two years into a Ph.D. program
in logic at Boston University
and "fed up to the gills with
logic" when she fell in love
with the computer in the office
next door.
"I was never intimidated,"
she said. "I was awed by what it
could do." Pigman shortly
thereafter bailed out of logic
and into computer science.
What Welsh and Pigman
have in common is a fascina
tion with computers. This fas
cination got them into trouble
with their chosen fields of
academic study but eventually
led them to enroll in the mas
ter's program in computer sci
ence here.
Welsh studied physics at
Carnegie Mellon, but soon
found himself spending all his
time at the computer center. "I
was logged into their DEC 20s
any time of the day or night.
Because I worked there I had
unlimited hours. I ran around
with one of those pocket cal
culators on my belt. I must
have looked like the complete
computer nerd.
"But I discovered all these
fascinating things. . . . There
was this incredible drive to
make the computer do what
you wanted it to do. They
threw me out at the end of the
year because I wasn't ac
complishing anything in my
physics major. So I went out to
get a job . . . as a computer ex
pert of course . . . age 17 and
having just failed my first year
of college. But I knew just
about everything about DEC
-205," he said.

Somehow Welsh heard that
Citibank of New York had just
purchased some DEC-20s. "I
just looked up Citibank in the
phone book and gave them a
call. They had just bought their
system, which was still new on
the market. They were hurting
for someone to help out. So I
put on my suit and went to New
York. They took me out to
lunch and picked my brains. I
was offered a job. But the per-

sonnel office choked on my
application. Here I was, 17, no
high school diploma, no col
lege degree. The bank instead
suggested I sell my time as a
consultant. So that's what I
did," he added.
While Welsh was busy
peddling his skills, Pigman was
preparing to drop out of BU.
She found herself ignoring
logic to hang out with LISP
hackers.
"I got much more interested
in what they were doing than in
what I was doing," she said
simply.
Today Welsh and Pigman no
longer need feel guilty about
the number of hours they
spend "fooling around" with
computers. They are able to
pursue their interests and can
expect highly paid jobs when
they graduate.
Welsh continues to spend
most of his free time at a com
puter center. When he is not in
class, he's found at LOTS unty
ing knots in the two DEC 20s

there. Because of a contractual
agreement with Bell Labs
which is paying for his M.S.
degree, Welsh is prohibited
from hiring himself out while
in school. His time at LOTS is
donated free to the University.
Welsh isn't perturbed this
this: "I work at LOTS to main
tain my expertise," he says. "In
any aspect of the computer in
dustry, if you don't use it, you
lose it. You get out of date if

you're gone for even one
year."
Welsh enjoys problem
solving to the extent that to
wards the end of the quarter,
when LOTS becomes over
crowded, sluggish and more
prone to crash, he often
spends entire nights there
tending to the machines.
Because of a love of re
search, Pigman considers her
self lucky and well situated in
the computer science depart
ment: "People may complain
about the quality of teaching,"
she says,"and I'll admit it can
be boring, but that may be the
price orie pays in attending a
research versus teaching
school.
"On the other hand, you
don't have someone teaching
you stuff that's 10 years old,
which in this field can be 10
years out of date. It's always
fun to be on the forefront of
something," she said.
If the teaching is sometimes
weak, one's peers are not,

Pigman added. "They're one
of the reasons I came here,"
she says."The students here
can be one of your major re
sources. People here are very
good. I think I have an edge in
realizing this.
"I recognized long ago that
there's only so much you can
get from your professors. But
from your fellow students, you
can discuss what's going on,
and both get a better under
standing. It's nice to be in an
atmosphere where people get
ideas of their own and go off
and work on them," she said.
In reflecting on his work with
computers, Welsh finds it un
fortunate that computers are
not better comprehended by
the general public: "The term
'computer' is in today's world a

misnomer. They're really more
information processors, no
longer just computing ma
chines. They process, manipu
late, store, retrieve, disperse
and chart information.
"They draw maps, diagrams
and documents. They are really
more a tool to help you visu
alize or comprehend material
than to simply compute for
mulas. You feed a computer
data and instantly the data re
turns reorganized. I'd say that
computers as we know them
today are more communica
tion tools than calculating ma
chines."
While Welsh is talking to the
interviewer, the computer be
hind him beeps. Welsh swings
aroundto read a query from his
girlfriend who is working in the

adjoining room. Welsh shoots
off a reply without interrupting
the conversation.
One way of discussing this,
he says, is to look at the grow
ing interest in "networking"
computer facilities. Networks
are the electronic means of
connecting two computers
whether they're in the same
building or across the country.
The University is installing a
passive network system via
coaxial cables that will inter
connect all University systems.
Networks may also be estab
lished over phone lines, satel
lite transmissions or micro
waves.
The University is also
hooked into a nationwide net
work called "ARPAnet." AR
PAnet (sponsored by the De
fense Advanced Research
Project Agency) is owned by
the U.S. Department of De
fense and was established to
encourage and facilitate the
exchange of information be
tween government research
labs, corporate labs doing gov
ernment research, and educa
tional institutions with gov
ernment grants.
When Pigman eavesdropped
on her first computer conver
sation, she said she was thril
led: "It's actually due to com
puter communication that I'm
here. Through the computer I
got to know many people here
before I even thought of apply
ing to the program.
"Recently I've been talking
to a friend at MIT. He knows a
lot about LISP, and more im
portant knows how much I

know. He can give me better
help than anyone else â€” it's
nice that so many of my friends
in Boston are computer
people. Over ARPAnet it's easy
to stay in touch," she said.
With the development of
networks, Welsh says, the days
of the isolated personal com
puter are over. A local network
is too vital a communication
need for offices to ignore.
Networks sometimes replace
two traditional and time hon
ored means of interoffice and
home communication: the
telephone and mail service. A
computer link can obviate the
need to call to make an ap
pointment, or to read or dis
cuss a document. It is no
longer necessary to copy mate
rial and then send it across the
hall, city, or country. You can
send it instantly even if there is
no one to receive it. It will wait.
No time lag, no danger of in
terrupting someone, no trou
ble with making duplicates, no
danger of missing someone.
Messages of general interest
can be sent to a general file,
often called a "bulletin board,"
for everyone to read. There's
little physical inter-office mail.
All is sent electronically.
As Welsh pointed out, this is
not a description of the future.
It's here and Stanford students
like Welsh and Pigman are
using it instead of writing or
calling other computer users.
Many departments have been
using computers as communi
cation media for a long time
and it seems as though the
computer, like the telephone,
is here to stay.

Welsh isn't perturbed this
this: "I work at LOTS to main
tain my expertise," he says. "In
any aspect of the computer in
dustry, if you don't use it, you
lose it. You get out of date if

you're gone for even one
year."
Welsh enjoys problem
solving to the extent that to
wards the end of the quarter,
when LOTS becomes over
crowded, sluggish and more
prone to crash, he often
spends entire nights there
tending to the machines.
Because of a love of re
search, Pigman considers her
self lucky and well situated in
the computer science depart
ment: "People may complain
about the quality of teaching,"
she says,"and I'll admit it can
be boring, but that may be the
price orie pays in attending a
research versus teaching
school.
"On the other hand, you
don't have someone teaching
you stuff that's 10 years old,
which in this field can be 10
years out of date. It's always
fun to be on the forefront of
something," she said.
If the teaching is sometimes
weak, one's peers are not,

Pigman added. "They're one
of the reasons I came here,"
she says."The students here
can be one of your major re
sources. People here are very
good. I think I have an edge in
realizing this.
"I recognized long ago that
there's only so much you can
get from your professors. But
from your fellow students, you
can discuss what's going on,
and both get a better under
standing. It's nice to be in an
atmosphere where people get
ideas of their own and go off
and work on them," she said.
In reflecting on his work with
computers, Welsh finds it un
fortunate that computers are
not better comprehended by
the general public: "The term
'computer' is in today's world a

misnomer. They're really more
information processors, no
longer just computing ma
chines. They process, manipu
late, store, retrieve, disperse
and chart information.
"They draw maps, diagrams
and documents. They are really
more a tool to help you visu
alize or comprehend material
than to simply compute for
mulas. You feed a computer
data and instantly the data re
turns reorganized. I'd say that
computers as we know them
today are more communica
tion tools than calculating ma
chines."
While Welsh is talking to the
interviewer, the computer be
hind him beeps. Welsh swings
aroundto read a query from his
girlfriend who is working in the

adjoining room. Welsh shoots
off a reply without interrupting
the conversation.
One way of discussing this,
he says, is to look at the grow
ing interest in "networking"
computer facilities. Networks
are the electronic means of
connecting two computers
whether they're in the same
building or across the country.
The University is installing a
passive network system via
coaxial cables that will inter
connect all University systems.
Networks may also be estab
lished over phone lines, satel
lite transmissions or micro
waves.
The University is also
hooked into a nationwide net
work called "ARPAnet." AR
PAnet (sponsored by the De
fense Advanced Research
Project Agency) is owned by
the U.S. Department of De
fense and was established to
encourage and facilitate the
exchange of information be
tween government research
labs, corporate labs doing gov
ernment research, and educa
tional institutions with gov
ernment grants.
When Pigman eavesdropped
on her first computer conver
sation, she said she was thril
led: "It's actually due to com
puter communication that I'm
here. Through the computer I
got to know many people here
before I even thought of apply
ing to the program.
"Recently I've been talking
to a friend at MIT. He knows a
lot about LISP, and more im
portant knows how much I

know. He can give me better
help than anyone else â€” it's
nice that so many of my friends
in Boston are computer
people. Over ARPAnet it's easy
to stay in touch," she said.
With the development of
networks, Welsh says, the days
of the isolated personal com
puter are over. A local network
is too vital a communication
need for offices to ignore.
Networks sometimes replace
two traditional and time hon
ored means of interoffice and
home communication: the
telephone and mail service. A
computer link can obviate the
need to call to make an ap
pointment, or to read or dis
cuss a document. It is no
longer necessary to copy mate
rial and then send it across the
hall, city, or country. You can
send it instantly even if there is
no one to receive it. It will wait.
No time lag, no danger of in
terrupting someone, no trou
ble with making duplicates, no
danger of missing someone.
Messages of general interest
can be sent to a general file,
often called a "bulletin board,"
for everyone to read. There's
little physical inter-office mail.
All is sent electronically.
As Welsh pointed out, this is
not a description of the future.
It's here and Stanford students
like Welsh and Pigman are
using it instead of writing or
calling other computer users.
Many departments have been
using computers as communi
cation media for a long time
and it seems as though the
computer, like the telephone,
is here to stay.

At 17, Sean Welsh was hired
by Citibank of New York to
troubleshoot its new million
dollar computer. Welsh had no
high school diploma and had
just failed his first year of col
lege.
Welsh has this thing about
computers, which he ex
plained as the natural outcome
of a childhood love of things
mechanical and electronic. A
delight in "switches and flash
ing lights" had him already
primed for his first encounter
with computers in junior high.
At 24, Victoria Pigman was
two years into a Ph.D. program
in logic at Boston University
and "fed up to the gills with
logic" when she fell in love
with the computer in the office
next door.
"I was never intimidated,"
she said. "I was awed by what it
could do." Pigman shortly
thereafter bailed out of logic
and into computer science.
What Welsh and Pigman
have in common is a fascina
tion with computers. This fas
cination got them into trouble
with their chosen fields of
academic study but eventually
led them to enroll in the mas
ter's program in computer sci
ence here.
Welsh studied physics at
Carnegie Mellon, but soon
found himself spending all his
time at the computer center. "I
was logged into their DEC 20s
any time of the day or night.
Because I worked there I had
unlimited hours. I ran around
with one of those pocket cal
culators on my belt. I must
have looked like the complete
computer nerd.
"But I discovered all these
fascinating things. . . . There
was this incredible drive to
make the computer do what
you wanted it to do. They
threw me out at the end of the
year because I wasn't ac
complishing anything in my
physics major. So I went out to
get a job . . . as a computer ex
pert of course . . . age 17 and
having just failed my first year
of college. But I knew just
about everything about DEC
-205," he said.

Somehow Welsh heard that
Citibank of New York had just
purchased some DEC-20s. "I
just looked up Citibank in the
phone book and gave them a
call. They had just bought their
system, which was still new on
the market. They were hurting
for someone to help out. So I
put on my suit and went to New
York. They took me out to
lunch and picked my brains. I
was offered a job. But the per-

sonnel office choked on my
application. Here I was, 17, no
high school diploma, no col
lege degree. The bank instead
suggested I sell my time as a
consultant. So that's what I
did," he added.
While Welsh was busy
peddling his skills, Pigman was
preparing to drop out of BU.
She found herself ignoring
logic to hang out with LISP
hackers.
"I got much more interested
in what they were doing than in
what I was doing," she said
simply.
Today Welsh and Pigman no
longer need feel guilty about
the number of hours they
spend "fooling around" with
computers. They are able to
pursue their interests and can
expect highly paid jobs when
they graduate.
Welsh continues to spend
most of his free time at a com
puter center. When he is not in
class, he's found at LOTS unty
ing knots in the two DEC 20s

there. Because of a contractual
agreement with Bell Labs
which is paying for his M.S.
degree, Welsh is prohibited
from hiring himself out while
in school. His time at LOTS is
donated free to the University.
Welsh isn't perturbed this
this: "I work at LOTS to main

any aspect of the computer in

led: "It's actually due to com
puter communication that I'm
here. Through the computer I
got to know many people here
before I even thought of apply
ing to the program.
"Recently I've been talking
to a friend at MIT. He knows a
lot about LISP, and more im
portant knows how much I

know. He can give me better
help than anyone else â€” it's
nice that so many of my friends
in Boston are computer
people. Over ARPAnet it's easy
to stay in touch," she said.
With the development of
networks, Welsh says, the days
of the isolated personal com
puter are over. A local network
is too vital a communication
need for offices to ignore.
Networks sometimes replace
two traditional and time hon
ored means of interoffice and
home communication: the
telephone and mail service. A
computer link can obviate the
need to call to make an ap
pointment, or to read or dis
cuss a document. It is no
longer necessary to copy mate
rial and then send it across the
hall, city, or country. You can
send it instantly even if there is
no one to receive it. It will wait.
No time lag, no danger of in
terrupting someone, no trou
ble with making duplicates, no
danger of missing someone.
Messages of general interest
can be sent to a general file,
often called a "bulletin board,"
for everyone to read. There's
little physical inter-office mail.
All is sent electronically.
As Welsh pointed out, this is
not a description of the future.
It's here and Stanford students
like Welsh and Pigman are
using it instead of writing or
calling other computer users.
Many departments have been
using computers as communi
cation media for a long time
and it seems as though the
computer, like the telephone,
is here to stay.

At 17, Sean Welsh was hired
by Citibank of New York to
troubleshoot its new million
dollar computer. Welsh had no
high school diploma and had
just failed his first year of col
lege.
Welsh has this thing about
computers, which he ex
plained as the natural outcome
of a childhood love of things
mechanical and electronic. A
delight in "switches and flash
ing lights" had him already
primed for his first encounter
with computers in junior high.
At 24, Victoria Pigman was
two years into a Ph.D. program
in logic at Boston University
and "fed up to the gills with
logic" when she fell in love
with the computer in the office
next door.
"I was never intimidated,"
she said. "I was awed by what it
could do." Pigman shortly
thereafter bailed out of logic
and into computer science.
What Welsh and Pigman
have in common is a fascina
tion with computers. This fas
cination got them into trouble
with their chosen fields of
academic study but eventually
led them to enroll in the mas
ter's program in computer sci
ence here.
Welsh studied physics at
Carnegie Mellon, but soon
found himself spending all his
time at the computer center. "I
was logged into their DEC 20s
any time of the day or night.
Because I worked there I had
unlimited hours. I ran around
with one of those pocket cal
culators on my belt. I must
have looked like the complete
computer nerd.
"But I discovered all these
fascinating things. . . . There
was this incredible drive to
make the computer do what
you wanted it to do. They
threw me out at the end of the
year because I wasn't ac
complishing anything in my
physics major. So I went out to
get a job . . . as a computer ex
pert of course . . . age 17 and
having just failed my first year
of college. But I knew just
about everything about DEC
-205," he said.

Somehow Welsh heard that
Citibank of New York had just
purchased some DEC-20s. "I
just looked up Citibank in the
phone book and gave them a
call. They had just bought their
system, which was still new on
the market. They were hurting
for someone to help out. So I
put on my suit and went to New
York. They took me out to
lunch and picked my brains. I
was offered a job. But the per-

sonnel office choked on my
application. Here I was, 17, no
high school diploma, no col
lege degree. The bank instead
suggested I sell my time as a
consultant. So that's what I
did," he added.
While Welsh was busy
peddling his skills, Pigman was
preparing to drop out of BU.
She found herself ignoring
logic to hang out with LISP
hackers.
"I got much more interested
in what they were doing than in
what I was doing," she said
simply.
Today Welsh and Pigman no
longer need feel guilty about
the number of hours they
spend "fooling around" with
computers. They are able to
pursue their interests and can
expect highly paid jobs when
they graduate.
Welsh continues to spend
most of his free time at a com
puter center. When he is not in
class, he's found at LOTS unty
ing knots in the two DEC 20s

there. Because of a contractual
agreement with Bell Labs
which is paying for his M.S.
degree, Welsh is prohibited
from hiring himself out while
in school. His time at LOTS is
donated free to the University.
Welsh isn't perturbed this
this: "I work at LOTS to main
tain my expertise," he says. "In
any aspect of the computer in
dustry, if you don't use it, you
lose it. You get out of date if

you're gone for even one
year."
Welsh enjoys problem
solving to the extent that to
wards the end of the quarter,
when LOTS becomes over
crowded, sluggish and more
prone to crash, he often
spends entire nights there
tending to the machines.
Because of a love of re
search, Pigman considers her
self lucky and well situated in
the computer science depart
ment: "People may complain
about the quality of teaching,"
she says,"and I'll admit it can
be boring, but that may be the
price orie pays in attending a
research versus teaching
school.
"On the other hand, you
don't have someone teaching
you stuff that's 10 years old,
which in this field can be 10
years out of date. It's always
fun to be on the forefront of
something," she said.
If the teaching is sometimes
weak, one's peers are not,

Pigman added. "They're one
of the reasons I came here,"
she says."The students here
can be one of your major re
sources. People here are very
good. I think I have an edge in
realizing this.
"I recognized long ago that
there's only so much you can
get from your professors. But
from your fellow students, you
can discuss what's going on,
and both get a better under
standing. It's nice to be in an
atmosphere where people get
ideas of their own and go off
and work on them," she said.
In reflecting on his work with
computers, Welsh finds it un
fortunate that computers are
not better comprehended by
the general public: "The term
'computer' is in today's world a

misnomer. They're really more
information processors, no
longer just computing ma
chines. They process, manipu
late, store, retrieve, disperse
and chart information.
"They draw maps, diagrams
and documents. They are really
more a tool to help you visu
alize or comprehend material
than to simply compute for
mulas. You feed a computer
data and instantly the data re
turns reorganized. I'd say that
computers as we know them
today are more communica
tion tools than calculating ma
chines."
While Welsh is talking to the
interviewer, the computer be
hind him beeps. Welsh swings
aroundto read a query from his
girlfriend who is working in the

adjoining room. Welsh shoots
off a reply without interrupting
the conversation.
One way of discussing this,
he says, is to look at the grow
ing interest in "networking"
computer facilities. Networks
are the electronic means of
connecting two computers
whether they're in the same
building or across the country.
The University is installing a
passive network system via
coaxial cables that will inter
connect all University systems.
Networks may also be estab
lished over phone lines, satel
lite transmissions or micro
waves.
The University is also
hooked into a nationwide net
work called "ARPAnet." AR
PAnet (sponsored by the De
fense Advanced Research
Project Agency) is owned by
the U.S. Department of De
fense and was established to
encourage and facilitate the
exchange of information be
tween government research
labs, corporate labs doing gov
ernment research, and educa
tional institutions with gov
ernment grants.
When Pigman eavesdropped
on her first computer conver
sation, she said she was thril
led: "It's actually due to com
puter communication that I'm
here. Through the computer I
got to know many people here
before I even thought of apply
