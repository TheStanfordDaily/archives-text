## The
						Stanford Daily Some advice for advisers 
### 
Once again seniors have looked back on their
undergraduate careers and given it high marks.
The annual senior survey conducted by the Of
fice of the Vice-Provost for Undergraduate
Education reveals that 94 percent of the sur
veyed seniors rate the quality of their under
graduate education as "good" or "excellent."
The University has reason to be proud of the
survey results, which indicate a generally posi
tive evaluation for most aspects of the under
graduate program and academic environment.
Vet, for the third time in as manyyears, students
expressed a genuine dissatisfaction with the
faculty—not as researchers and scholars, but
as advisers.
The survey shows that 46 percent of the
seniors felt their adviser, while they were unde
clared, was "poor" or even "very poor." Advis
ers within individual majors fared just slightly
better; a majority of seniors rate them as aver
age to below average.
The problems inherent in student-faculty re
lations are not unique to Stanford. Faculty and
students at many universities often find them
selves working at cross-purposes. The student
wants the faculty member to advise, to evalu
ate; in short, to enrich the learning process
through a personal give and take. While the
faculty no doubt understands these student
concerns, they feel pressured to bolster their
professional livelihood through research and
publication. Often the result is that the most
desirable professors have little time to advise.
Granting the conflictual nature of a profes
sor's responsibilities, the result of the senior

survey with regard to the student-faculty rela
tionship nevertheless seems significant enough
to warrant concern.
In any relationship the participation must be
mutual. Faculty members recount stories of
students who flee upon seeing their adviser in
the dining hall. Students cite faculty brush-offs
and general unavailability as the biggest barrier
to the relationship.
To be sure, the responsibility of an adviser is
not easy or always rewarding. Even so, many
faculty members devote a commendable
amount of effort toward their advising respon
sibilities. But all too often faculty members take
a passive attitude toward student relations,
isolating themselves from student concerns and
languishing in the relative security of their re
search.
Students have stepped into the advising void.
The Advising Associate program in which
juniors and seniors serve as advisers to
freshman, will extend into each all-freshman
dorm next year. The popularity of the program
testifies both to its success and tothe desire of
the students for better advising.
We encourage students and faculty to initiate
what often becomes a valuable partnership and
an essential part of the educational process. The
survey indicates that the University is rated
higher than the people who constitute it. This
speaks well for the University as an institution
but poorly for its human element. What is
needed is a renewed commitment to a relation
ship that is central to the educational
experience—that of a student and his teacher.
