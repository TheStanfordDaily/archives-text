## Admit on merit, not numbers 
### 
I find a startling similarity between
the common arguments for and
against affirmative action, because
both sides consistantly begin by im
plying that minority candidates are
actually*"inferior."
A closer examination of the issues
would reveal that it is not the candi
dates who are inferior, but the tradi
tional methods of selecting those
candidates.
Somehow the educational system
has accepted a definition of merit
quite different from the rest of the
nation's. Educational merit is almost
always discussed quanititatively, in
terms of SAT scores and grade point
averages. Yet true social merit is
rarely discussed in these terms. Who
could intelligently argue that poten
tial for merit is not the point of the
educational system, and that select
ing individuals with this potential is
not the goal of the admissions pro
cess?
Why is it then that Albert Einstein
or Martin Luther King, Jr. would not
have been accepted to a university of
Stanford's caliber? It would be dif
ficult to show that these legendary
figures did not make meaningful
contributions to society as a whole.

In assessing the "quantitative merit"
of Einstein's application, we find he
once failed mathematics and, there
fore, is an unacceptable candidate.
We suggest his best choice might be
his local community college.
Using the archaic SAT/CPA system,
King is also excluded from our imag
inary freshman class.
Affirmative action is not an offset
to discrimination (there is none), but
the first step to improving an admis
sions process which is the modern
equivalent of numerology. Affirma
tive action programs have forced
admissions officers to finally look up
from their tables of normal distribu
tions of SAT/GPAs and ask them
selves, "What is the real potential for
social, political, intellectual and
technological achievement of this
candidate?"
Affirmative action, ideally, allows
the admissions officer to scrutinize
the social, economic and racial back
ground of a candidate to ferret out
any signs of future achievement. The
result of affirmative action decisions
is not the selection of inferior candi
dates, but the careful recognition of
a superior grade of future achievers.
Unfortunately, at this time there

have been many systems maliciously
hidden under the banner of affirma
tive action. Foremost among these is
the detrimental quota systems. If it
were found that quota systems were
developed by opponents of affirma
tive action, fully aware that the
American people would not tolerate
this blatant "reverse" inequity, it
would not be surprising.
But true affirmative action is help
ing to bring to light the inadequacies
of numerical admissions, by first
pointing out the way in which this
system has shortchanged minorities.
As the long-term benefits of affirma
tive action programs begin to man
ifest themselves, it is apparent that it
should not be terminated but ex
tended to similarly review all applic
ants. When all applicants are
analyzed by their potential to contri
bute to our society and not by a
number assigned by the Educational
Testing Service and incompetent
high school teachers, then there will
be no need to talk of minority admis
sions and affirmative action. We all
will benefit from the selection of
superior candidates identified by a
more humane and accurate process.
