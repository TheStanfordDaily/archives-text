## The
						Reagan papers: a clarification by Kennedy 
### 
The article by Kathy Olmsted
(Daily, April 6) about our considera
tion of the Reagan Presidential pa
pers was excellent, and accurate in
nearly all respects. It did, however
necessarily, leave out some aspects
of the history — and it may also leave
the wrong impression about what is
likely to happen next.
These discussions began in a pre
liminary way over two years ago.
They were reported quite widely in
the press, including the Daily, during
last academic year — when a White
House official made the erroneous
public assertion that Stanford had
"donated land" for a Reagan Presi
dential Library. In correcting that
misimpression, we made it clear that
the University was interested in ac
quiring the presidential papers as a
scholarly resource, but that a variety
of considerations — including the
nature of the building, the site and
the relationship between the Library
and other academic programs —
would have to be considered before
a final decision could be reached.
There the matter stood until the
White House indicated its interest
several months ago. The director of
the Hoover Institution, Glenn
Campbell, who extended the origi
nal invitation, has now defined the
scope and nature of the program
more completely, and we are en
gaged in the feasibility and site loca
tion studies described in yesterday's
Daily article.
It is thus not correct that the pa
pers will come here if we provide the
site. I expect that the President and
his advisers will want to look at a
number of aspects of the program we
work out here to determine its suita
bility. It cannot be guaranteed that
what we offer will meet their re
quirements.

ROTC reply
In a recent letter to the Daily
("Stanford should reinstate ROTC,"
April 1), Renard Strautman took ex
ception to my support of Stanford's
decision more than a decade ago "to
get rid of ROTC." Since the Daily
quoted only a passing comment I
made to one of its reporters, perhaps
it would be appropriate to review
some of the reasons for the Universi
ty's decision and for my support of
that decision.
The faculty majority who voted to
deny academic credit for ROTC
courses were agreed on two proposi
tions. The first was that ROTC
courses taught by military officers
lacked the intellectual content and
academic standards that generally
prevail at Stanford and hence were
not deserving of academic credit.
The second was that the method of
appointing the military officers who
taught ROTC was an unacceptable
departure from the procedure used
in appointing all other members of
the faculty.
In every Stanford department the
initiative for selecting new members
of the faculty lies with the faculty it
self. Searches are nationwide (even
international) and reviews of pro
posed appointments are conducted
by deans who are themselves mem
bers of the faculty and who are ad
vised by members of the faculty. In
short, quality control is always in the
hands of the faculty and is never del
egated to entities outside the Uni
versity. The Department of Defense
would not agree to such procedures
in the selection of ROTC faculty, and
for this reason, too, ROTC and the
University came to a parting of the
ways.
Other members of the faculty,
perhaps not a majority, concluded
also that it was inappropriate for the

University to run a training program
for the exclusive benefit of any single
employer. Surely we would not be
willing to dedicate the Electrical En
gineering Department to the exclu
sive task of training employees for
Hewlett-Packard or any other single
firm. Nor would we be willing to
convert the Business School into a
training program for the exclusive
benefit of General Motors, with CM
choosing the faculty and determin
ing the curriculum.
By the same logic, many faculty
members decided it was inapprop
riate to provide space, assistance
and credit-granting power to a de
partment whose sole purpose was to
train students who had a contractual
obligation to go to work for the mili
tary.
In defense of ROTC, Strautman
raises once again the timeworn myth
that ROTC produces officers who are
more "thoughtful and well-read"
and hence more liberally educated
than those who are trained in the
service academies. This may be the
case.
But the "old boy network" that
controls promotions in the military
ensures that relatively few ROTC
graduates are promoted to the high
est ranks where their purported lib
eral views might have some influ
ence on policy.
Finally, sad to say, there is not a
single scientific study that shows that
ROTC graduates who are promoted
to the highest ranks hold attitudes
that differ in any significant way from
those who graduated from the ser
vice academies.
Finally, implicit in much of Straut
man <letter is a confusion of the na
tion (orthe national interest) with the
federal government. The two are not
synonymous. In the last 20 years the
government has illegally tapped our
telephones, opened our mail, and

burgled our homes. It has defamed
perhaps our greatest citizen (Martin
Luther King, Jr.), has murdered inno
cent Americans (the Chicago Panth
ers) and killed at least one wholly
innocent and unsuspecting Ameri
can by giving him a lethal dose of LSD
(in a CIA "test"). It has overthrown or
undermined democratically-elected
governments abroad. None of these
actions was in the interests of the
American people.
Stanford University was founded
to serve the interests of all Ameri
cans, indeed people everywhere,
through teaching and research. That
purpose should not be confused
with doing whatever the government
asks us to do. Stanford will do best to
accepf private, corporate and gov
ernment gifts and contracts where
those serve our basic missions, and
beyond that to keep at arms length
from other institutions, includingthe
government.

VIA on campus
I was happy to see Beverly Ber
mudez's informative article, "A
broad spectrum of student travel op
tions open, (Daily, March 28), this
week, but was surprised to find that
Volunteers in Asia was not men
tioned among the options. For 20
years VIA has been providing living
and working opportunities in Asia to
Stanford students and recent
graduates. Unlike many of the pro
grams mentioned in the article, VIA s
office is located on the Stanford
campus. VIA encourages people in
terested in volunteering in China,
Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan, the Philip
pines or Korea to drop by the VIA
office in the basement of the
Clubhouse Building near Old Union.
