# Nixon's unsung public enemy
## 
### 
Call it "Lennonscam." In case you
missed it, it was revealed last week
that the FBI (Federal Bureau of Imbe
cility) carried out a widespread sur
veillance of the late john Lennonand
his wife, Yuko Ono, in the early
19705. Lennon's FBI file recently fell
into the hands of UC-lrvine History
Prof. Jon Wiener, who is writing a
book about the former Beatle. Ac
cording to the file, FBI director J.
Edgar Hoover ordered his boys to tail
Lennon, fearing, for some reason,
that he would instigate an anti-Nixon
demonstration at the 1972 Republi
can National Convention. The file
contains numerous FBI memos, let
ters from the Attorney General and
from the Senate Internal Security
Subcommittee, and even lyrics from
some of Lennon's songs.
None of this is very shocking. The
FBI has always suffered from an acute
case of paranoia, and this was par
ticularly true under Hoover. (It is ru
mored that the former director
would rarely turn his back on his own
bathroom mirror.) The story does,
however, create an interesting
scenario. Picture, if you will, Hoover,
seated at the head of a long confer
ence table located in some secret
corner of the FBI office building.
Around the table are 12 tireless FBI
agents, each dressed in a dark blue
suit and wearing sunglasses. Hoover
is nervously chewing on his pencil.
"Mr. Simpson," barks Hoover, "read
those lyrics one more time. There's
got to be a clue in there some
where."
"Yes sir. 'Here come o\' flattop, he
come groovin' up slowly, he "
"Wait a minute!" Hoover yells.
"Flat top. He could be talking about
Bob Haldeman. Go on."

"Let's see. Where was I? Oh yes.
'He wear no shoeshine, he got to jam
football. He got monkey finger, he
shoot Coca Cola, . . "
Hoover closes his eyes and thinks
out loud. "Monkev . . . monkey . . .
guerrilla! . . . shoot Coca Cola! That's
it — he's hired some underworld
guerilla to shoot the president of the
Coca Cola Bottling Company! Naw,
that's not it. Still, there must be
something. The guy's a singer — I
don't trust singers. Maybe his wife is
involved. Robinson, you've been
checking the media. Any clues?"
"Well sir, the newspapers said
she's gone to his head, they look just
like two gurus in drag. Hey, that's
kinda catchy."
"That doesn't help us." Hoover
now starts to eaf his pencil. "Mr. Fox,
give us your report on the activities
of the subject on March 3."
"Yes sir. The subject left his apart
ment at exactly 1:13 p.m. The subject
proceeded to a movie theater, which
was showing a short-subject. The
subject of the short-subject was . .
"SHUT UP, Mr. Fox," Hoover
screams, foaming at the mouth.
"Jenkins, have the commissary send
us down some more of those little
hot dogs with the dough wrapped
around them. And I want another
milkshake! Now c'mon, gentlemen,
let's figure out what this commie has
up his sleeve. He's got long hair. I
don't trust guys with long hair. Jen
kins, you know his history. He's
friends with Jerry Rubin. Does he
have any other radical ties?"
"Well, he does have one tie that's
bright yellow with pink and green
stripes and . . ."
"ENOUGH, Mr. Jenkins!" By now,
Hoover has crawled up onto the
table and is repeatedly pounding his
forehead against its surface. "I want

answers! Simpson, read me some
more of those lyrics!"
"Right away, sir! Um . . .
'Semolina Pilchard climbing up the
Eiffel Tower. Elementary penguin
singing Hare Krishna. Man, you
should have seen them kicking Edgar
Allan Poe. I am the eggman, they are
the eggmen, I am the walrus, Coo
Coo A'loob, G'Coo Goo G'Joob.'
Shall I go on?"
"No, what's the use? 'Goo Goo
A'Joob?' Must be some kind of code.
I've gotta admit it — this Lennon may
be a long-haired, commie, hippie
punk, but he's one clever long
haired, commie, hippie-punk! I've
dealt with his kind before, though.
Sure, the sneaky, slimey kind, who'll
jump out at you and cut your throat
when you least expect it! Yeah, I
know his type. I've seen those
people all my life — all around me.
Why, even in grammar school; I re
member it like it was yesterday. All
the kids hated me. I knew it. They'd
all talk about me when I'd leave the
room. But I showed them! I showed
them all! I . .
Hoover is interrupted by a mes
senger who bursts into the confer
ence room. "Excuse me, sir. We've
just received word that five men have
been apprehended breaking into the
Democratic headquarters at the
Watergate Hotel. Shall we send a
man out to investigate?"
"Are you kidding?" Hoover re
sponds impatiently. "We're working
on something big here. This guy
Lennon is probably part of some in
ternational espionage ring. You want
me to waste one of my men on some
third-rate burglary? Ridiculous!
Now, whare were we? Henderson,
have we questioned the girl with
kaleidoscope eyes yet?"

give us your report on the activities
of the subject on March 3."
"Yes sir. The subject left his apart
ment at exactly 1:13 p.m. The subject
proceeded to a movie theater, which
was showing a short-subject. The
subject of the short-subject was . .
"SHUT UP, Mr. Fox," Hoover
screams, foaming at the mouth.
"Jenkins, have the commissary send
us down some more of those little
hot dogs with the dough wrapped
around them. And I want another
milkshake! Now c'mon, gentlemen,
let's figure out what this commie has
up his sleeve. He's got long hair. I
don't trust guys with long hair. Jen
kins, you know his history. He's
friends with Jerry Rubin. Does he
have any other radical ties?"
"Well, he does have one tie that's
bright yellow with pink and green
stripes and . . ."
"ENOUGH, Mr. Jenkins!" By now,
Hoover has crawled up onto the
table and is repeatedly pounding his
forehead against its surface. "I want

answers! Simpson, read me some
more of those lyrics!"
"Right away, sir! Um . . .
'Semolina Pilchard climbing up the
Eiffel Tower. Elementary penguin
singing Hare Krishna. Man, you
should have seen them kicking Edgar
Allan Poe. I am the eggman, they are
the eggmen, I am the walrus, Coo
Coo A'loob, G'Coo Goo G'Joob.'
Shall I go on?"
"No, what's the use? 'Goo Goo
A'Joob?' Must be some kind of code.
I've gotta admit it — this Lennon may
be a long-haired, commie, hippie
punk, but he's one clever long
haired, commie, hippie-punk! I've
dealt with his kind before, though.
Sure, the sneaky, slimey kind, who'll
jump out at you and cut your throat
when you least expect it! Yeah, I
know his type. I've seen those
people all my life — all around me.
Why, even in grammar school; I re
member it like it was yesterday. All
the kids hated me. I knew it. They'd
all talk about me when I'd leave the
room. But I showed them! I showed
them all! I . .
Hoover is interrupted by a mes
senger who bursts into the confer
ence room. "Excuse me, sir. We've
just received word that five men have
been apprehended breaking into the
Democratic headquarters at the
Watergate Hotel. Shall we send a
man out to investigate?"
"Are you kidding?" Hoover re
sponds impatiently. "We're working
on something big here. This guy
Lennon is probably part of some in
ternational espionage ring. You want
me to waste one of my men on some
third-rate burglary? Ridiculous!
Now, whare were we? Henderson,
have we questioned the girl with
kaleidoscope eyes yet?"

Call it "Lennonscam." In case you
missed it, it was revealed last week
that the FBI (Federal Bureau of Imbe
cility) carried out a widespread sur
veillance of the late john Lennonand
his wife, Yuko Ono, in the early
19705. Lennon's FBI file recently fell
into the hands of UC-lrvine History
Prof. Jon Wiener, who is writing a
book about the former Beatle. Ac
cording to the file, FBI director J.
Edgar Hoover ordered his boys to tail
Lennon, fearing, for some reason,
that he would instigate an anti-Nixon
demonstration at the 1972 Republi
can National Convention. The file
contains numerous FBI memos, let
ters from the Attorney General and
from the Senate Internal Security
Subcommittee, and even lyrics from
some of Lennon's songs.
None of this is very shocking. The
FBI has always suffered from an acute
case of paranoia, and this was par
ticularly true under Hoover. (It is ru
mored that the former director
would rarely turn his back on his own
bathroom mirror.) The story does,
however, create an interesting
scenario. Picture, if you will, Hoover,
seated at the head of a long confer
ence table located in some secret
corner of the FBI office building.
Around the table are 12 tireless FBI
agents, each dressed in a dark blue
suit and wearing sunglasses. Hoover
is nervously chewing on his pencil.
"Mr. Simpson," barks Hoover, "read
those lyrics one more time. There's
got to be a clue in there some
where."
"Yes sir. 'Here come o\' flattop, he
come groovin' up slowly, he "
"Wait a minute!" Hoover yells.
"Flat top. He could be talking about
Bob Haldeman. Go on."

"Let's see. Where was I? Oh yes.
'He wear no shoeshine, he got to jam
football. He got monkey finger, he
shoot Coca Cola, . . "
Hoover closes his eyes and thinks
out loud. "Monkev . . . monkey . . .
guerrilla! . . . shoot Coca Cola! That's
it — he's hired some underworld
guerilla to shoot the president of the
Coca Cola Bottling Company! Naw,
that's not it. Still, there must be
something. The guy's a singer — I
don't trust singers. Maybe his wife is
involved. Robinson, you've been
checking the media. Any clues?"
"Well sir, the newspapers said
she's gone to his head, they look just
like two gurus in drag. Hey, that's
kinda catchy."
"That doesn't help us." Hoover
now starts to eaf his pencil. "Mr. Fox,
