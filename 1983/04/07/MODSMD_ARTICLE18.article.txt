# Survey indicates students reluctant to use computers

### DWAYNE VIRNAU 
Greg Mullins is mistrustful of computers.
"I've avoided taking courses in computers," explained the
Stanford sophomore. "I can think of better things to do with my
time than to sit in front of a computer terminal. I guess I don't
know exactly why I'm mistrustful. I'm afraid of becoming too
technical, of society becoming too technical and being so con
cerned with information and sitting in front of a TV screen that
our human interactions will be impaired somewhat," he said.
Mullins' attitude toward computers is typical of most students
here. A survey conducted winter quarter showed that only 13
percent of the students here have never used computers, 24
percent worry that computers will make society too technical and
36 percent feel that computers will havea dehumanizingeffert on
society.
Despite their misgivings, Mullins and all but 3 percent of those
surveyed who had not used computers plan to do so before
leaving Stanford.
"Maybe those fears are ungrounded," Mullins said. "People
seem to have adjusted well." He admitted, "I think eventually I will
take some computer courses myself."

Most student majors and eventual careers do not require profi
ciency in computers. In fact, only 68 percent of students in the
survey said they thought everyone should learn how to use com
puters. Why, then, do virtually all students feel that they, person
ally, need to learn how to use computers?
Sophomore Jason Cole, like 93 percent of students in the
survey, feels that learning how to use computers gives one a
marketable skill. "Eventually 100 percent of the students will have

to take some class or have some knowledge of how to use a
computer," he said.
"If 7ime maga/ine is going to name a computer as Man ot the
Year, or machine of the year, then computers are fairly vital And
so I'm going to have to use one," he added.
Another more subtle reason could be the fear of the unknown.
Although she has no "burning desire" to do so, Claire McNulty, a
junior history major, said she feels it would be unrealistic not to
learn to use computers.

have to take some class or have some knowl
edge of how to use a computer/

"I don't want computers to be a big mystery since they are
becoming such a big part of society," she said. "I don't want to be
intimidated."
In the survey, 19 percent of students said they were intimidated
by computers and 14 percent worried that they would not have
'he skills to be able to adapt to the computer revolution.
Fd Gresser, a junior majoring in political science, does not
share those worries, but instead said he wants to learn to use
computers just in case. "Computers don't need to be in
timidating. They are just a tool, an extension of what a person can
do that frees workers from doing mundane counting. They can
improve the quality of life," he said.
McNulty said she would learn to work with computers because
"I think I should and my advisor thinks I should," though she has
no specific career objectives in mind.
She expressed what many students seem to be feeling. "I can't
go through four years of college without one computer science
course," she concluded.
