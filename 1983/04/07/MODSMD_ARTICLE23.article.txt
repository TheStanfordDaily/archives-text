## Naturalism betrays Pinter's stagebound 'Betrayal' 
### STEVE VINEBERG Betrayal 
Though Harold Pinter has written effec
tively for the screen on occasion (The
Pumpkin Eater, 7he Servant), attempts to
film hi« plays invariably fail. The acid ex
(hanges between his characters, which bear
such a strong resemblance to the kind of
subtextual exploration actors regularly en
gage in during rehearsal, have a hollow
sound on tilm, and the ambiguities suddenly
seem bald and obvious. Pinter has been
fairly universally proclaimed a great and im
portant playwright, but there's not enough
going on in his plays to keep the camera
occupied. And so the multilayered conver
sations tend to sound stagy and forced.
Betrayal, which received its world pre
miere in London in 1978 and opened on
Broadway in 1979 (Blythe Danner, Roy
Scheider and Raul lulia appeared in the New
York production), has a particularly
stagebound structure: it traces the intimate
relationship of three people — husband wife
and lover (who is also the husband's best
friend) — beginning at the dissolution of the
marriage and moving backwards to the mo
ment of betrayal, i.e., the inception of the
affair.
Pinter did not originate this regression
gimmick; Kaufman and Hart had employed
it in Merrily We Roll Along in 1934 in order to
demonstrate how a set of miserable, self
centered adults had started out as idealistic
kids — what they had lost. But as the clock is
turned back in Betrayal, we don't learn much
about the characters that Pinter hasn't al
ready established, and so the entire ap
paratus seems to exist to accommodate an
actor's exercise: as we accumulate informa
tion about what a character knows and how
long he has known it, we see each actor
playingthe previous stagesot that secret and
concealing it from the others. (For instance,
in Scene One the wife tells the lover that her
husband has known about their affair for
four years; in Scene Four, three years ear
lier, we see the husband's reaction to the
lover, who doesn't know he knows, etc.)
Filming Betrayal, the English stagedirector
David Jones seeks to solve the problems in
herent in the bare-bones theatrical structure
b\ bringing the play as close as possible to
naturalism, the mostcomfortable style for a
movie. But when Pinter is tamed and made
to conform to the rules of naturalism, the
intricate set of hostile reversals in his
dialogue flattens out and sounds hopelessly
banal — Pinter begins to sound like bad Ib
sen. Jones has made strange choices for
someone familiar with the way Pinter works
in a theater: the heightened theme music
overlaid on the dialogue sentimentalizes ev
erything, there is far too much decor (and
almost all of it unattractive) for a spare, self
reflexive drama, and the actors fill in mo
ments of emotional release that the playw

right never intended. (Pinter wrote his own
screenplay, but surely it wasn't his idea to
follow Patricia Hodge out of the flat where
she and her lover, Jeremy Irons, have just
broken up, and into her car, where she
bursts into tears. He probably didn't think
up the establishing shots at the beginning of
scenes, either, since the ensuing dialogue is
always joined in progress and so we feel the
lack of a transition.)
The naturalistic performances Patricia
Hodge and Jeremy Irons offer here point up
all the wrong things about the material.
When Hodge, deciding to give up the flat
she and Irons steal to for their afternoon
assignations, insists, "I have a home, with
tablecloths and all the rest of it," here read
ing is so earnest and humorless that we
might be watching a daytime soap with dis
tinguished, well spoken guest stars. That
line should be funny. Patricia Hodge, who
has a strange, angular face that looks lovely
in some shots, awkward and insubstantial —
a line drawing — in others (and sometimes
reminds you of Laraine Newman), exhibits a
paltry emotional range, and her approach to
Pinter's dry-martini one-liners, which ought
to shiver with a chill wit, is unimaginative
and reductive. She's fairly unpleasant, but
not in the spooky way Pinter s characters are
written to be: she comes across like a
smiley, synthetic head nurse — without any
erotic resonance, like Julie Andrews always
does. For a Pinter play, where sex lurks
ominously between the lines, her approach
is a disaster. Jeremy Irons, on the other
hand, exhibits a great deal of intelligence
and some humor, and in the last few scenes
he is looser and more comfortable on cam
era than I've seen him before, but Jones'
misdirection victimizes him, especially in
the tete-a-tetes with Patricia Hodge.
There is, however, one actor in Betrayal
who has discovered how the material should
be played. As the cuckolded husband, Ben
Kingsley gives a triumphant performance —
richly ambiguous, astonishingly funny,
sharp as jagged glass.
When Kingsley first appears, he is so sub
tle and controlled that Jeremy Irons appears
to be acting all over the set. His eyes register
four or five levels of perception at once, and
the way he handles a line like "You're my
best friend'' suggests several more; he even
soaks a small gesture like lifting a glass with
unsuspected meaning — the glass becomes
a keen weapon for slicing the rotten, lie
ridden air. When — as a publisher — he
refers to the "art'' of one of his authors, he
slides into a sour, growling lower-class ac
cent, indicting the whole literary world for
pretentiousness in a single syllable. And his
big scenes — a speech about why men don't
want women around when they play squash
(in Pinter, this judgment constitutes a big
scene) and a drunken bit in a restaurant —
are tour de forces. Kingsley sometimes tum
bles into a halt-sunken voice that implies
years of grief and abuse, a frightening kind

of cynicism, and a weird, distorted perspec
tive of the human race. This airless, rasping
basso is a parody of a sob, and it is simulta
neously repellent and deeply moving. Kings
ley gives a stunningly complex demonstra
tion of Pinter's message in all his plays — that
human beings are capable of feeling and
inflicting greater injury that words can chart.
Within the limits of the style Pinter de
mands, it's a near-great performance. I've
never been convinced that Pinter is a creator
of masterpieces, and certainly Betrayal is a
light, minor work even in comparison with
some of his others (The Caretaker, The
Birthday Party, The Homecoming), but
Kingsley at least leaves the question open to
debate.
