# La 						Nuit de Varennes
## 
### 
Except for The Pizza Triangle and parts of
We All Loved Each Other So Much, every
thing I've seen by Ettore Scola has been
polished but stodgy. For La Nuit de Varen
nes, set on the eve of the French Revolution,
he certainly must have had the most ex
travagant budget of his career, but the pic
ture displays no extravagance of spirit — it's
respectably dull, an Italian equivalent to the
expensive historical pageant movies pro
duced here and in England in the '60s (A Man
for All Seasons, The Lion in Winter, Anne of
the Thousand Days). The cast is such an un
holy mix of nationalities and acting styles —
Jean-Louis Barrault (as Restif de la Bre

tonne), Marcello Mastroianni (as Casanova),
Hanna Schygulla, Harvey Keitel (as Tom
Paine), )ean-Claude Brialy, Andrea Ferreol
— that a director with any wit or imagination
would make comic use of the contrasts be
tween them, but except for Mastroianni no
one in it does anything you can recall a
month later. Do the people who say they
love La Nuit de Varennes or another current
art house favorite, the enigmatic, distasteful
Coup de Torchon, really believe that these
movies are great intellectual experiences?
Both have received inexplicably kind
notices, and their directors have been
lauded for their wisdom and incisiveness,
but I couldn't find a single idea in either film
worth retaining.
