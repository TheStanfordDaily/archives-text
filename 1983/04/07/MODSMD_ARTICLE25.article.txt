# The
						Twinkle Brothers: songs dat will last a tousand years
## 
### JOHN NORDELL 
I met Norman Grant for the
first time while interviewing
him in reggae publicist Karen
Jahlight's kitchen in Berkeley
Grant, the lead singer of The
Twinkle Brothers, casually
dressed in slacks and a t-shirt,
responded to my questions
with a cosmopolitan flair, laced
with references to his experi
ences in the United States, En
gland and his own country,
Jamaica.
In concert at the Keystone
Palo Alto last Sunday, Grant
shed this serene demeanor
and led his band in an impas
sioned manner: belting out
lyrics, flashing his dreadlocks
and dancing with abandon.
While this performance re
flects the harsh living condi
tions he grew up in, his
offstage air mirrors the warmth
of the people he grew up with.
These contrasts embodied in
Norman Grant are characteris
tic of reggae music itself. The
rhythm is restrained, hypnotic
and energizing while the lyrics
are often harsh: criticisms of
the oppressive world system,
depictions of Third World pov
erty and a call for revolution.
Yet other songs seek "One

Love" (unity of all peoples), in
the peaceful praise of Jah, the
Rastafarian god.
I asked Grant, who began
singing in tourist hotels at age
12, what the roots of his politi
cal music were. He said, "I
sing, I write songs bout tings I
see, tings dat happened to me
personally. You might say
somethin and, you know, it
soun good and you put it into
song, you know. So I think
more or less the way I figure
it. . . . I'm gonna sing songs I
want to sing, record songs dat
will last a lifetime, you know, a
tousand year to come, it still
have a meaning. So I think
when you sing songs, you
know, well, you might say well,
political, but it's the truth: you
see certain tings and you just
say it."
The Twinkle Brothers
opened their show with "Africa
is for Africans," illuminating
the Rastafarian belief based on
Marcus Garvey's teachings, of
repatriation to Africa. While to
outsiders, Rastafari is often a
bizarre, confusing mix of Bibli
cal references, the worship of
Haile Selassie as God, medita
tional use of ganja and dog
matic prediction, Grant de

fined the religion in one word;
"Rasta is Love." The Twinkles
presented another Rasta tenet
in their song "Throw away the
Comb" (an action that results
in dreadlocks). The song
ended with clear acapella har
monies followed with a thun
der crash of cymbols and
guitars.
The hard rhythms of Dono
van Black on drums and Der
rick Brown on electric bass
drive the band. Again con
trasts: Black does not sport
dreadlocks, wore a sailor cap
and sunglasses while ihomp
ing on chewing gum to the beat
as his drumsticks whipped
through the air. Meanwhile,
with solemn concentration,
Brown plucked his bass, wore a
knitted Rasta hat and gently
rocked back and forth in
fringed moccasins.
During the song "Never get
Burn," Black leaped from his
drum set and began wildly
prancing around the stage,
joined by other shanking and
jumping band members in a
joyous dance. Norman Grant,
who plays traps on most of the
Twinkles records, assumed the
drumming duties. This spirited
performance, absent from

their other Bay Area appear
ances, enlivened an already
enthusiastic crowd.
The band often extended its
songs by first: either Norman
Grant or percussionist Karl
Hyatt chanting in the half
speaking, half-singing often
rhythmically rhyming lamaican
D| fashion. This style allows for
spontaneous lyrics, e.g. they
sang about coming down
highway 280 and "Stepping ina

Palo Alto." After this DJ seg
ment, the band dubbed it out.
Dub is the separation and
minimization of instrumenta
tion: only the bass and drums
play, followed by a few meas
ures of |ust "chinka chinka"
from the guitar and the bubbl
ing organ, and so on. Thus
while the Twinkle Brothers
only played 14 songs, these dis
tinctive reggae touches
perhaps made up for the
skimpy length of the show.

What is Norman Grant s
message to the Bay Area<
"Well, the Bay Area now, you
know, tings kinda messy on ya,
you know, so I tell dem, well
we don't want no more Sodom
and Gomorrah on ya. So the
Sodom and Gomorrah-ism
dem a keep up, you got to stop
it, cause the Kather watch you
know, it gwane terrible pon
dem, so you |ust have to
change dem evil ways, you
know and just do good."
