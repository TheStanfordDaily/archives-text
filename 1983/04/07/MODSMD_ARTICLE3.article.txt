# Honor Code violation
## COP member to charge prof. 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Council of Presidents member
Mark Epstein will begin formal com
plaint procedures today against a
chemistry professor whom he claims
proctored final examinations in past
quarters.
Epstein said he will not name the
professor until after he meets with
him for the first time today.
According to Epstein, the profes
sor continually proctors his examina
tions in spite of wording in the Honor
Code instructing faculty members to
refrain from "proctoring examina
tions and from taking unreasonable
precautions to prevent" cheating.
The professor cannot be charged
officially with an Honor Code viola
tion because faculty members are
not bound to the Honor Code in the
same way students are.
Commenting on the Honor Code
in general, University Ombudsman
]ohn Goheen, a member of the
Honor Code Commission, said that
the lack of a binding agreement from
the faculty is a problem.
"All of you students sign the
Honor Code and swear to it when
you come in to take tests, but there's
no such binding statement that the
faculty signs. The faculty has voted to

sustain the Honor Code, but they're
not bound to it. I'd like to see a
greater commitment on the part of
the faculty," Goheen said.
Epstein, former chairman of the

Honor Code Commission, claimed
that the professor caught a student
cheating while he was proctoring an
exam fall quarter. The student was
suspended for an Honor Code viola
tion, Epstein said, even though the
professor caught the student while
he himself was violating the Honor
Code.
"Unfortunately, there's no

exclusionary rule with the Honor
Code" that would preclude evidence
obtained by a professor while violat
ing the Code, Epstein explained.
"The biggest problem with the
Honor Code isthatthewhiletimethe
Honor Code has been around, no
faculty member has ever been tried"
for violating it, he said.
Epstein said if, after meeting with
the professor today, he belives it
necessary, he will discuss the matter
with the department chairman and
then the provost's office, in keeping
with University complaint proce
dures.
The alleged Honor Code violation
is representative of the differing
views among faculty members and
the Honor Code Commission on the
rules against proctoring examina
tions.
Sophomore Donald Grunz, a
member of the commission, said he
believes most faculty understand the
Honor Code but do not always follow
it. "A lot of profs, do continue to
proctor tests. They say that TAs are in
the room to answer questions, and
that's sometimes true, but some
times not. I think sometimes the
profs, want to make sure there's
nothing funny going on," Grunz


Mark Epstein
said.
Crunz said some professors be
lieve not proctoring an examination
creates temptation for students to
cheat. Because the Honor Code
states that professors "should avoid,
as far as practicable, academic pro
cedures that create temptations to
violate the Honor Code," some pro
fessors believe not proctoring is ac
tually an Honor Code violation,

Crunz said.
But the Honor Code says they
can't proctor tests. I think that's
pretty clear," Grunz explained.
Chemistry Prof. Hans Andersen
has disagreed. In 1980 Andersen told
the Daily he had proctored tests in
the past and would proctor tests in
the future if he thought it was neces
sary to keep students from cheating.
"I feel some obligation to preserve
the integrity of the exam process and
the grading process. I don'tthinkthe
students have the right to dismantle

that process by default," Andersen
said in a 1980 interview.
"There seems to be a feeling
among the faculty, at least the ones
I've talked to, that third-party re
sponsibility is regarded as somewhat
of a joke, in that I've heard of very
few cases where that (one student
turning in another) happened," An
dersen explained at the time. "Either
you have a third-party system that
works, or you have teachers proctor
ing their exams. I don't see it any
other way."
