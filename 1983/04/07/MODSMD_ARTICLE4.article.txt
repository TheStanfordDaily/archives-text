# Red tape bars nine students from ASSU ballot spot
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Of the 39 would-be ASSU Senate candidates
who submitted petitions in order to qualify for
next week's election, one-fourth have been
denied a spot on the ballot due to various
technical violations of the election rules, ac
cording to ASSU Elections Commissioner
Craig Spearman.
Sophomore Chip Roellig, one of the nine
students denied a place on the ballot, ex
plained that he had obtained 9b signatures —
two fewer than the required number—on the
front sides of the four pages of his petition and
10 additional signatures on the back of the last
page. The candidates were required to put
their name on the top of each sheet. However,
Roellig neglected to put his name on the back
of the last sheet.
"Craig Spearman said that was violation of

the rules, the way he interpreted them," Roel
lig said. "He said the reason that they have this
rule is so that someone cannot pass around a
petition under the pretense of being someone
that they are not. I don't think that applies in
my case. I completely complied with the spirit
of the rule but he said that they cannot make
any adjustments to see that justice is done."
Although Spearman said he was sympathetic
to Roellig's plight, he stood by the decision of
the election committee. "A piece of paper has
two faces and his name was not on the second
face. When you cut the numbers so close—
when you need 100 and you turn in 108—you
really have to be doubly on top of your own
actions. Not enough people are taking the
commision seriously. The slightest breach of
the rules will be dealt with in the harshest
manner possible."
Sophomore Bill Lo, another of the nine, was

removed from the ballot on a similar pretext.
In contrast to Roellig, however, Lo said he
felt he had received fair treatment. "I'd rather
be in the senate race but they did have their
rule stated in the campaign practices hand
book and as such it was my obligation to read it
and follow it. They did have grounds to dis
qualify me from the race."
At last Tuesday's senate meeting Roellig told
the senators he would "like to see a little more
discretionary power given to the election
commission." He also asked that the senate act
to make it possible for him to be listed on the
ballot.
Despite the efforts of senator Andy Messing
on behalf of Roellig, the senate declined to call
a special meeting to change the election rules
and make it possible for Roellig to appear on
the ballot. In reaction, Roellig said, "I'm really

disappointed because I'm not going to get a
fair shake. The senate is becoming a bureau
cratic mess. Many senators voiced the realiza
tion that I had not broken the spirit of the rule,
but they still seem unwilling to do anything
about it." Roellig said he now plans to run as a
write-in candidate.
At the same meeting, the senate used a pro
vision in the by-laws to reverse a decision by
the election commission, ruling that the
Speakers Bureau should be placed on the bal
lot because its technical violation of the rules
was the result of "extenuating circumstances."
In reference to the senate ruling, Spearman
said, "I personally resent the way that the sen
ate is interfering in the elections. Extenuating
circumstances did not apply to the Speakers
Bureau. I have become disillusioned with the
senate as a whole. However, I refuse to resign
just because of the senate's childishness."
