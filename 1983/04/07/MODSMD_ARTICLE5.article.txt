# Liquor store to restrict deliveries

### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Undergraduate students who are accustomed to ordering alcohol from
Frog Pond Liquor store in Mountain View may find that for them the pond
has dried up. After a meeting with Acting Dean of Student Affairs Norm
Robinson and Asst. Dean of Residential Education Alice Supton, the
management of Frog Pond has decided to require proof of age for all
campus deliveries and to refuse to deliver alcohol to freshman dorms.
Robinson said he and Supton have been contacting and meeting with several
of the "major suppliers" of alcohol to the campus to discuss the Universi
ty's concerns about student alcohol use on campus.
"Resident fellows, resident advisers and students have written to the
Res. Ed. office and suggested that we pass on their concerns," Robinson
said. During the meeting with Frog Pond, the attitudes of students and
faculty were expressed, but Robinson stressed that no advice was given
about what sort of action Frog Pond should take.
"We were not making a decision about how he should run his busi
ness," Robinson said.
Supton has contacted two other liquor stores, Liquor Barn in Mountain
View and Beltramo's in Menlo Park, and plans to contact several more.
However, she said she was not sure whether the action will have any great
effect. "We're still in the process of trying to understand the nature of the
alcohol problem at Stanford," Supton said.
Bill Roser, owner of Frog Pond, said that following the meeting he
decided to request identification for all on-campus deliveries and to no
longer deliver to all-freshman dorms. "I was not aware that there resi
denced on campus where the students are entirely underage.," Roser
said, "and where even some of the RAs are under 21."
He added that the law, not the University, prompted him to make his
decision. "I am, after all, a businessman in the community, and there are
laws I have to follow," he said.
Sophomore Donald Howard said he had tried to obtain liquor from
Frog Pond recently, and had been asked on the phone if he was 21. "The
salesman on the phone said something about the University telling them
not to deliver without proof, but I wasn't really listening," he said. "When
the deliveryman got there the person who had I.D. had to put the money
into his (the deliveryman's) hands," Ftoward said.


I.ie So/Daily
BEG FOR A KFG: Students under 21 may experience more difficulty
obtaining alcohol because of University administrators' recent discus
sion with area liquor stores. The Frog Pond has already tightened its
delivery procedures.
