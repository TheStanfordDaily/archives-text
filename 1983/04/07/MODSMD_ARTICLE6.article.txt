# More patrol of animal facilities
## Intruders injure guard 
### BOB JOHNSON 
Following an assault on a security
guard Saturday, extra security has
been added at animal facilities
housed at the Medical Center.
The assault occurred the day after
the Humane Society of Santa Clara
Valley announced that it intended to
file charges of animal abuse in the
case of a dog that had been attacked
by another dog, taken from a Palo
Alto Veterans Administration Hospi
tal laboratory by a Stanford medical
student, and put to sleep. It is not
known, however, if the assault had
any connection to the case.
The dog had been part of a V.A.
Hospital study by University faculty
members and other researchers
from the Medical School. Most V.A.
physicians have dual appointments
at the University.
Harold Spencer, operations man
ager of the Division of Laboratory
Animal Medicine (DLAM), said, "All I
know is that there were two intruders
on the fourth floor of the Medical
Center. One hit the guard, and then
they fled.''
The guard suffered a cut lip.
"Security was increased im
mediately following the assault,"
Spencer said. "We had thought the
area, especially near the Medical
Center, was secure. Apparently il
wasn't."
Spencer said the increased patrols
included areas near the DLAM of
fices, which are near the Anatomy

Building. He also said that animal
facilities in other University depart
ments are being patrolled more.
"As far as I am concerned, these
additions should be permanent,"
Spencer said. "But it's up to Marvin
Harrington (Stanford Police Chief) to
decide that."
Mike Goodkind of the Stanford
Medical Center News Bureau em
phasized that there was no way of
knowing if the intruders were pro
testing animal research.
"There was no indication of direct
connection to laboratory animals,"
he said.
At the V.A. Hospital, officials said
yesterday that a panel will look into
the incident concerning the attacked
dog.
Barbara Gleason, administrative
officer for research at the hospital,
said the review is of this case and is
not an investigation of overall prac
tices.
'We are researching this incident
basically to reassure everyone that
while the accident involving this dog
was unfortunate, it does not reflect
negatively on the high-quality animal
care provided by the V.A. center,"
Gleason said.
The V.A.'s review will be con
ducted by its Animal Care Subcom
mittee. A University review is not ap
propriate because although the re
searchers were from Stanford, the
dog was from the V.A. and was at
tacked in a V.A. facility.
