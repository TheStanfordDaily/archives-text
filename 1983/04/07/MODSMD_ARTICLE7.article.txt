Arms control pact chances slim
Washington — There is little chance for a U.S.-Sovi
et arms control agreement in the foreseeable future,
members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
said yesterday after a confidential and unusually
gloomy briefing from the top U.S. arms negotiators.
Lawmakers disagreed about who is to blame, with
Republicans tending to hold the Soviets responsible
and Democrats allotting a large share of the responsi
bility to what they see as Reagan administration mis
handling.
Senators who spoke to reporters, however, agreed
that prospects seem poor for early progress in the Ge
neva negotiations on medium-range missiles in Eu
rope. Their reports contrasted with the adminis

tration's official "hope" that the Soviets will bargain
seriously on the basis of President Reagan's recent
"interim" stand.
Another feature of the closed meeting, according
to participants, was a new explanation by retired Gen.
Edward Rowny, the chief strategic arms negotiator, of
a controversial memorandum that he handed to Ken
neth Adelman, the administration's embattled nomi
nee for director of the Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency.
After publication of reports about the memo,
which sharply criticized other members of his nego
tiating team, Rowny claimed that it did not represent
his views but was only "informal talking points" pre
pared by staff aides. Senators said Rowny went further

yesterday, telling the committee that he had not read
the document at the time he delivered it to Adelman.
Thisexplanation appearstoconflict with Adelman's
private description of the memo as "Ed Rowny's con
fidential views on people." For this reason, it may
further complicate the task of obtaining confirmation
of Adelman in a Senate floor debate scheduled to be
gin Monday.
Student loan/draft link overruled
Washington — The Department of Justice, warning
the Department of Education that it may be in con
tempt of court, has advised it to stop requiring male
student loan applicants to certify that they have regis
tered for the military draft, it was learned yesterday.

U.S. District Judge Donald Alsop ruled March 10 in
St. Paul, Minn., that the certification requirement for
federal education loans probably violated students'
contitutional rights against self-incrimination. But
Department of Education officials took the position
that Alsop's preliminary injunction barring the re
quirement applied only to Alsop's judicial district in
Minnesota.
Department of Justice lawyers, in a letter Friday that
a Department of Education official described as
"strongly worded," warned that continuing to re
quire aid applicants to complete the certification on
their "student aid report" could run afoul of Alsop's
order.
Spokesmen for both departments refused to make
the letter public, contending that it is "a privileged
document" protected by "the attorney-client rela
tionship." But the advice appears to have caused De
partment of Education officials to soften their hard
line on the requirement.
As a result, prospects that the draft certification rule
will be applied to student loan applications for the
1983-84 school year have dimmed further.
The Department of Justice letter, according to
sources who have seen it, made clear that the govern
ment will continue to seek a final ruling upholding
the constitutionality of the requirement, which Con
gress passed overwhelmingly and President Reagan
signed into law Sept. 8.
Alsop has yet to rule on a Minnesota Civil Liberties
Union request for a permanent injunction, which the
Department of Justice said it would await before ap
pealing.
Sources said that as a result of the Department of
Justice's warning, the Department of Education plans
to write to about 6000 student aid officers around the
nation advising them that schools may no longer re
quire students applying for federal aid to certify that
they have registered for the draft.
Kissinger met secretly with PLO
Washington — Former Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer conferred secretly with a senior aide to
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat in Morocco several months ago in a meeting
that has become a complicating factor in the Reagan
administration's drive for a Middle East peace settle
ment.
U.S. officials who confirmed the encounter yester
day vehemently denied that Kissinger had sought to
set up a "back channel" with the PLO that would have
undercut the Reagan administration's efforts to bring
Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein together on a for
mula allowing Hussein to enter peace negotiations
with Israel.
Kissinger, who said he had met for half an hour with
Ahmed Dajani, a member of the PLO's executive
committee, in Rabat in late November, also asserted
that the meeting with Dajani "had absolutely no polit
ical significance. I am not conducting my own foreign
policy." Kissinger said he was not aware before the
meeting that Dajani was a PLO official.
Other sources report that the meeting was ar
ranged by Morocco's King Hassan 11, with the involve
ment of the U.S. ambassador to Morocco, Joseph
Reed, who, like Kissinger, has long been a close as
sociate of New York banker David Rockefeller. A sen
ior State Department official said yesterday he did not

know if Reed had played a role in setting up the en
counter.
The long-delayed talks between Arafat and Hussein
on a joint negotiating formula began in Amman last
weekend and have reached a critical point, Arab and
U.S. sources said yesterday. Arafat is due to return to
Amman later this week for a final negotiating session
with the Jordanian monarch.
Reagan jeered by steelworkers
Pittsburgh — President Reagan was confronted yes
terday by derisive protests from thousands of laid-off
steelworkers as he carried a message of economic
hope in the computer age into the nation's troubled
industrial heartland.
A rain-soaked crowd of about 4000 blue-collar
workers, chanting "Reagan, Reagan, he's no good,
send him back to Hollywood" and carrying placards
such as "Jobs Not Bombs," assembled outside the Pit
tsburgh Hilton, where Reagan delivered a speech on
job retraining.
But the president's limousine was diverted into an
underground garage to avoid a direct confrontation
with the demonstrators, who booed and jeered as his
motorcade approached. Some carried banners of the
United Steel Workers union and others held signs,
"Feed the Hungry, Not the Pentagon," and "This is
not Reagan country, 17.2 percent unemployed in
western Pennsylvania."
The protests were not the only reminder of eco
nomic hardship on a day in which Reagan sought to
highlight economic recovery and what he described
as a "basic transition" from smokestack industries to
high technology.
After speaking to a class of 120 blue-collar workers
being retrained for computer repair and main
tenance, one trainee, Ron Bricker, unexpectedly
called out to Reagan and offered the president his re
sume.
"I've been looking for a job for a year. And I can't
find one," he said as his colleagues voiced their ap
proval.
Unemployment in Pittsburgh topped 17 percent in
January, and Reagan's trip here was designed to ad
dress his larger political problem of disenchantment
among the blue-collar workers, who were a key to his
1980 victory.
Panel withdraws racial quota brief
Washington — The White House and the Justice
Department, attempting to squelch a major internal
dispute over civil rights policy, have successfully pres
sured the Equal Employment Opportunities Com
mission to withdraw an appeals court brief that sharp

ly criticized administration stands on racial quotas
and affirmative action.
The "friend of the court" brief had attacked the Jus
tice Department's position objecting to the use of
quotas in a New Orleans police department dis
crimination case. The EEOC said justice's position had
no legal merit and was a threat to efforts to eradicate
employment discrimination.
The commission unanimously approved filing of
the brief in January, telling the Justice Department
that the expression of conflicting views would be of
"considerable public benefit."
Concerned that the administration speak with "one
voice," however, top officials began a campaign to
kill the brief. The campaign included a high-level
White House meeting last week with presidential
counselor Edwin Meese, warnings from the Justice
Department that the commission lacked legal author
ity to express independent views .n such cases and a
reminder from Civil Rights Division chief Bradford
Reynolds that opposition to racial hiring and promo
tion quotas was "explicitly set forth in the Republican
party platform."
The commission voted 4 to 1 Tuesday nottosubmit
the brief. The dissenter was the sole member not ap
pointed by President Reagan, Armando Rodriguez.
The commission announced the reversal yesterday
ina terse statement. lt"would be withinthepublicin
terest not to file" views that conflict with the Justice
Department, the statement said. At the same time, it
urged the department to "consider" the EEOC's posi
tion when writing its own brief in the New Orleans
case, which is now before the sth Circuit Court of Ap
peals.
Watt's rock ban raises furor
Washington — Secretary of the Interior James Watt,
already the most controversial member of the Reagan
administration because of his environmental policies,
found himself besieged yesterday by an even more
vocal constituency: the high-decibel disciples of rock
and roll.
Watt banned the Beach Boys and other rock groups
from the government-sponsored Fourth of July cele
bration on the Washington Mall, saying they attract
"the wrong element" and telling the National Park
Service, "It is imperative that we get entertainment
that will point to the glories of America in a patriotic
and inspirational way that will attract the families."
Concerts by the Beach Boys and other such groups
"have not attracted families and have in fact created
drug and alcohol problems and other serious dangers
for visitors," he said.
Watt's action has touched off a furor in the nor
mally staid capital. Washington radio stations were

deluged with protest calls, with one broadcasting the
White House telephone number yesterday so that in
dignant music fans could take their case to the presi
dent. The Beach Boys termed Watt's edict "un
believable."
Engineers devise satellite rescue
Houston — Teams of engineers made careful plans
yesterday to rescue the $100 million tracking-and
data-relay satellite from the egg-shaped orbit where it
wound up Tuesday after a misfiring rocket sent it
tumbling out of control for about three hours.
At the same time, astronauts aboard the space shut
tle Challenger, which hauled the satellite on the first
leg of its journey into space Monday, prepared for a
space walk today.
But in the midst of their preparation and their work
on science experiments, they chatted with Houston
about efforts to save the satellite.
The scheme for saving the revolutionary TDRS ve
hicle called for using two of its 24 tiny control
thrusters to lift it into a circular orbit at an altitude of
21,950 miles above the equator. That would raise the
present orbit's low point by about 8400 miles.
If that succeeds, an attempt would be made to
nudge the vehicle on up to 22,300 miles, where it is
supposed to remain stationary over Brazil's north
eastern tip, relaying satellite communications for 10
years.
Word of the rescue plan was radioed to the four
astronauts aboard the space shuttle as they passed
over the South Pacific yesterday afternoon.
Astronaut Roy Bridges in Mission Control told the
Challenger crew that it would be 10 to 14 days before
officials know whether the effort has been successful,
but he said that they are confident they have suffi
cient fuel to save the satellite from the disaster that
had been feared after the rocket misfired.
Stocks continue downward trend
The stock market, in its longest losing streak so far
this year, posted its fourth straight decline yesterday
amid interest-rate worries and some earnings disap
pointments.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
6.67 to 1,113.49, bringing its loss over the past four
trading days to 29.80 points.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled
77.14 million shares, against 76.81 million in the pre
vious session.

Watt's rock ban raises furor
Washington — Secretary of the Interior James Watt,
already the most controversial member of the Reagan
administration because of his environmental policies,
found himself besieged yesterday by an even more
vocal constituency: the high-decibel disciples of rock
and roll.
Watt banned the Beach Boys and other rock groups
from the government-sponsored Fourth of July cele
bration on the Washington Mall, saying they attract
"the wrong element" and telling the National Park
Service, "It is imperative that we get entertainment
that will point to the glories of America in a patriotic
and inspirational way that will attract the families."
Concerts by the Beach Boys and other such groups
"have not attracted families and have in fact created
drug and alcohol problems and other serious dangers
for visitors," he said.
Watt's action has touched off a furor in the nor
mally staid capital. Washington radio stations were

deluged with protest calls, with one broadcasting the
White House telephone number yesterday so that in
dignant music fans could take their case to the presi
dent. The Beach Boys termed Watt's edict "un
believable."
Engineers devise satellite rescue
Houston — Teams of engineers made careful plans
yesterday to rescue the $100 million tracking-and
data-relay satellite from the egg-shaped orbit where it
wound up Tuesday after a misfiring rocket sent it
tumbling out of control for about three hours.
At the same time, astronauts aboard the space shut
tle Challenger, which hauled the satellite on the first
leg of its journey into space Monday, prepared for a
space walk today.
But in the midst of their preparation and their work
on science experiments, they chatted with Houston
about efforts to save the satellite.
The scheme for saving the revolutionary TDRS ve
hicle called for using two of its 24 tiny control
thrusters to lift it into a circular orbit at an altitude of
21,950 miles above the equator. That would raise the
present orbit's low point by about 8400 miles.
If that succeeds, an attempt would be made to
nudge the vehicle on up to 22,300 miles, where it is
supposed to remain stationary over Brazil's north
eastern tip, relaying satellite communications for 10
years.
Word of the rescue plan was radioed to the four
astronauts aboard the space shuttle as they passed
over the South Pacific yesterday afternoon.
Astronaut Roy Bridges in Mission Control told the
Challenger crew that it would be 10 to 14 days before
officials know whether the effort has been successful,
but he said that they are confident they have suffi
cient fuel to save the satellite from the disaster that
had been feared after the rocket misfired.

Arms control pact chances slim
Washington — There is little chance for a U.S.-Sovi
et arms control agreement in the foreseeable future,
members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
said yesterday after a confidential and unusually
gloomy briefing from the top U.S. arms negotiators.
Lawmakers disagreed about who is to blame, with
Republicans tending to hold the Soviets responsible
and Democrats allotting a large share of the responsi
bility to what they see as Reagan administration mis
handling.
Senators who spoke to reporters, however, agreed
that prospects seem poor for early progress in the Ge
neva negotiations on medium-range missiles in Eu
rope. Their reports contrasted with the adminis

tration's official "hope" that the Soviets will bargain
seriously on the basis of President Reagan's recent
"interim" stand.
Another feature of the closed meeting, according
to participants, was a new explanation by retired Gen.
Edward Rowny, the chief strategic arms negotiator, of
a controversial memorandum that he handed to Ken
neth Adelman, the administration's embattled nomi
nee for director of the Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency.
After publication of reports about the memo,
which sharply criticized other members of his nego
tiating team, Rowny claimed that it did not represent
his views but was only "informal talking points" pre
pared by staff aides. Senators said Rowny went further

yesterday, telling the committee that he had not read
the document at the time he delivered it to Adelman.
Thisexplanation appearstoconflict with Adelman's

Student loan/draft link overruled
Washington — The Department of Justice, warning
the Department of Education that it may be in con
tempt of court, has advised it to stop requiring male
student loan applicants to certify that they have regis
tered for the military draft, it was learned yesterday.

U.S. District Judge Donald Alsop ruled March 10 in
St. Paul, Minn., that the certification requirement for
federal education loans probably violated students'
contitutional rights against self-incrimination. But
Department of Education officials took the position
that Alsop's preliminary injunction barring the re
quirement applied only to Alsop's judicial district in
Minnesota.
Department of Justice lawyers, in a letter Friday that
a Department of Education official described as
"strongly worded," warned that continuing to re
quire aid applicants to complete the certification on
their "student aid report" could run afoul of Alsop's
order.
Spokesmen for both departments refused to make
the letter public, contending that it is "a privileged
document" protected by "the attorney-client rela
tionship." But the advice appears to have caused De
partment of Education officials to soften their hard
line on the requirement.
As a result, prospects that the draft certification rule
will be applied to student loan applications for the
1983-84 school year have dimmed further.
The Department of Justice letter, according to
sources who have seen it, made clear that the govern
ment will continue to seek a final ruling upholding
the constitutionality of the requirement, which Con
gress passed overwhelmingly and President Reagan
signed into law Sept. 8.
Alsop has yet to rule on a Minnesota Civil Liberties
Union request for a permanent injunction, which the
Department of Justice said it would await before ap
pealing.
Sources said that as a result of the Department of
Justice's warning, the Department of Education plans
to write to about 6000 student aid officers around the
nation advising them that schools may no longer re
quire students applying for federal aid to certify that
they have registered for the draft.
Kissinger met secretly with PLO
Washington — Former Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer conferred secretly with a senior aide to
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat in Morocco several months ago in a meeting
that has become a complicating factor in the Reagan
administration's drive for a Middle East peace settle
ment.
U.S. officials who confirmed the encounter yester
day vehemently denied that Kissinger had sought to
set up a "back channel" with the PLO that would have
undercut the Reagan administration's efforts to bring
Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein together on a for
mula allowing Hussein to enter peace negotiations
with Israel.
Kissinger, who said he had met for half an hour with
Ahmed Dajani, a member of the PLO's executive
committee, in Rabat in late November, also asserted
that the meeting with Dajani "had absolutely no polit
ical significance. I am not conducting my own foreign
policy." Kissinger said he was not aware before the
meeting that Dajani was a PLO official.
Other sources report that the meeting was ar
ranged by Morocco's King Hassan 11, with the involve
ment of the U.S. ambassador to Morocco, Joseph
Reed, who, like Kissinger, has long been a close as
sociate of New York banker David Rockefeller. A sen
ior State Department official said yesterday he did not

know if Reed had played a role in setting up the en
counter.
The long-delayed talks between Arafat and Hussein
on a joint negotiating formula began in Amman last
weekend and have reached a critical point, Arab and
U.S. sources said yesterday. Arafat is due to return to
Amman later this week for a final negotiating session
with the Jordanian monarch.
Reagan jeered by steelworkers
Pittsburgh — President Reagan was confronted yes
terday by derisive protests from thousands of laid-off
steelworkers as he carried a message of economic
hope in the computer age into the nation's troubled
industrial heartland.
A rain-soaked crowd of about 4000 blue-collar
workers, chanting "Reagan, Reagan, he's no good,
send him back to Hollywood" and carrying placards
such as "Jobs Not Bombs," assembled outside the Pit
tsburgh Hilton, where Reagan delivered a speech on
job retraining.
But the president's limousine was diverted into an
underground garage to avoid a direct confrontation
with the demonstrators, who booed and jeered as his
motorcade approached. Some carried banners of the
United Steel Workers union and others held signs,
"Feed the Hungry, Not the Pentagon," and "This is
not Reagan country, 17.2 percent unemployed in
western Pennsylvania."
The protests were not the only reminder of eco
nomic hardship on a day in which Reagan sought to
highlight economic recovery and what he described
as a "basic transition" from smokestack industries to
high technology.
After speaking to a class of 120 blue-collar workers
being retrained for computer repair and main
tenance, one trainee, Ron Bricker, unexpectedly
called out to Reagan and offered the president his re
sume.
"I've been looking for a job for a year. And I can't
find one," he said as his colleagues voiced their ap
proval.
Unemployment in Pittsburgh topped 17 percent in
January, and Reagan's trip here was designed to ad
dress his larger political problem of disenchantment
among the blue-collar workers, who were a key to his
1980 victory.
Panel withdraws racial quota brief
Washington — The White House and the Justice
Department, attempting to squelch a major internal
dispute over civil rights policy, have successfully pres
sured the Equal Employment Opportunities Com
mission to withdraw an appeals court brief that sharp

ly criticized administration stands on racial quotas
and affirmative action.
The "friend of the court" brief had attacked the Jus
tice Department's position objecting to the use of
quotas in a New Orleans police department dis
crimination case. The EEOC said justice's position had
no legal merit and was a threat to efforts to eradicate
employment discrimination.
The commission unanimously approved filing of
the brief in January, telling the Justice Department
that the expression of conflicting views would be of
"considerable public benefit."
Concerned that the administration speak with "one
voice," however, top officials began a campaign to
kill the brief. The campaign included a high-level
White House meeting last week with presidential
counselor Edwin Meese, warnings from the Justice
Department that the commission lacked legal author
ity to express independent views .n such cases and a
reminder from Civil Rights Division chief Bradford
Reynolds that opposition to racial hiring and promo

Reagan jeered by steelworkers
Pittsburgh — President Reagan was confronted yes
terday by derisive protests from thousands of laid-off
steelworkers as he carried a message of economic
hope in the computer age into the nation's troubled
industrial heartland.
A rain-soaked crowd of about 4000 blue-collar
workers, chanting "Reagan, Reagan, he's no good,
send him back to Hollywood" and carrying placards
such as "Jobs Not Bombs," assembled outside the Pit
tsburgh Hilton, where Reagan delivered a speech on
job retraining.
But the president's limousine was diverted into an
underground garage to avoid a direct confrontation
with the demonstrators, who booed and jeered as his
motorcade approached. Some carried banners of the
United Steel Workers union and others held signs,
"Feed the Hungry, Not the Pentagon," and "This is
not Reagan country, 17.2 percent unemployed in
western Pennsylvania."
The protests were not the only reminder of eco
nomic hardship on a day in which Reagan sought to
highlight economic recovery and what he described
as a "basic transition" from smokestack industries to
high technology.
After speaking to a class of 120 blue-collar workers
being retrained for computer repair and main
tenance, one trainee, Ron Bricker, unexpectedly
called out to Reagan and offered the president his re
sume.
"I've been looking for a job for a year. And I can't
find one," he said as his colleagues voiced their ap
proval.
Unemployment in Pittsburgh topped 17 percent in
January, and Reagan's trip here was designed to ad
dress his larger political problem of disenchantment
among the blue-collar workers, who were a key to his
1980 victory.
Panel withdraws racial quota brief
Washington — The White House and the Justice
Department, attempting to squelch a major internal
dispute over civil rights policy, have successfully pres
sured the Equal Employment Opportunities Com
mission to withdraw an appeals court brief that sharp

ly criticized administration stands on racial quotas
and affirmative action.
The "friend of the court" brief had attacked the Jus
tice Department's position objecting to the use of
quotas in a New Orleans police department dis
crimination case. The EEOC said justice's position had
no legal merit and was a threat to efforts to eradicate
employment discrimination.
The commission unanimously approved filing of
the brief in January, telling the Justice Department
that the expression of conflicting views would be of
"considerable public benefit."
Concerned that the administration speak with "one
voice," however, top officials began a campaign to
kill the brief. The campaign included a high-level
White House meeting last week with presidential
counselor Edwin Meese, warnings from the Justice
Department that the commission lacked legal author
ity to express independent views .n such cases and a
reminder from Civil Rights Division chief Bradford
Reynolds that opposition to racial hiring and promo
tion quotas was "explicitly set forth in the Republican
party platform."
The commission voted 4 to 1 Tuesday nottosubmit
the brief. The dissenter was the sole member not ap
pointed by President Reagan, Armando Rodriguez.
The commission announced the reversal yesterday
ina terse statement. lt"would be withinthepublicin
terest not to file" views that conflict with the Justice
Department, the statement said. At the same time, it
urged the department to "consider" the EEOC's posi

Watt's rock ban raises furor
Washington — Secretary of the Interior James Watt,
already the most controversial member of the Reagan
administration because of his environmental policies,
found himself besieged yesterday by an even more
vocal constituency: the high-decibel disciples of rock
and roll.
Watt banned the Beach Boys and other rock groups
from the government-sponsored Fourth of July cele
bration on the Washington Mall, saying they attract
"the wrong element" and telling the National Park
Service, "It is imperative that we get entertainment
that will point to the glories of America in a patriotic
and inspirational way that will attract the families."
Concerts by the Beach Boys and other such groups
"have not attracted families and have in fact created
drug and alcohol problems and other serious dangers
for visitors," he said.
Watt's action has touched off a furor in the nor
mally staid capital. Washington radio stations were

deluged with protest calls, with one broadcasting the
White House telephone number yesterday so that in
dignant music fans could take their case to the presi
dent. The Beach Boys termed Watt's edict "un
believable."
Engineers devise satellite rescue
Houston — Teams of engineers made careful plans
yesterday to rescue the $100 million tracking-and
data-relay satellite from the egg-shaped orbit where it
wound up Tuesday after a misfiring rocket sent it
tumbling out of control for about three hours.
At the same time, astronauts aboard the space shut
tle Challenger, which hauled the satellite on the first
leg of its journey into space Monday, prepared for a
space walk today.
But in the midst of their preparation and their work
on science experiments, they chatted with Houston
about efforts to save the satellite.
The scheme for saving the revolutionary TDRS ve
hicle called for using two of its 24 tiny control
thrusters to lift it into a circular orbit at an altitude of
21,950 miles above the equator. That would raise the
present orbit's low point by about 8400 miles.
If that succeeds, an attempt would be made to
nudge the vehicle on up to 22,300 miles, where it is
supposed to remain stationary over Brazil's north
eastern tip, relaying satellite communications for 10
years.
Word of the rescue plan was radioed to the four
astronauts aboard the space shuttle as they passed
over the South Pacific yesterday afternoon.
Astronaut Roy Bridges in Mission Control told the
Challenger crew that it would be 10 to 14 days before
officials know whether the effort has been successful,
but he said that they are confident they have suffi
cient fuel to save the satellite from the disaster that
had been feared after the rocket misfired.

Arms control pact chances slim
Washington — There is little chance for a U.S.-Sovi
et arms control agreement in the foreseeable future,
members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
said yesterday after a confidential and unusually
gloomy briefing from the top U.S. arms negotiators.
Lawmakers disagreed about who is to blame, with
Republicans tending to hold the Soviets responsible
and Democrats allotting a large share of the responsi
bility to what they see as Reagan administration mis
handling.
Senators who spoke to reporters, however, agreed
that prospects seem poor for early progress in the Ge
neva negotiations on medium-range missiles in Eu
rope. Their reports contrasted with the adminis

tration's official "hope" that the Soviets will bargain
seriously on the basis of President Reagan's recent
"interim" stand.
Another feature of the closed meeting, according
to participants, was a new explanation by retired Gen.
Edward Rowny, the chief strategic arms negotiator, of
a controversial memorandum that he handed to Ken
neth Adelman, the administration's embattled nomi
nee for director of the Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency.
After publication of reports about the memo,
which sharply criticized other members of his nego
tiating team, Rowny claimed that it did not represent
his views but was only "informal talking points" pre
pared by staff aides. Senators said Rowny went further

yesterday, telling the committee that he had not read
the document at the time he delivered it to Adelman.
Thisexplanation appearstoconflict with Adelman's
private description of the memo as "Ed Rowny's con
fidential views on people." For this reason, it may
further complicate the task of obtaining confirmation
of Adelman in a Senate floor debate scheduled to be
gin Monday.
Student loan/draft link overruled
Washington — The Department of Justice, warning
the Department of Education that it may be in con
tempt of court, has advised it to stop requiring male
student loan applicants to certify that they have regis
tered for the military draft, it was learned yesterday.

U.S. District Judge Donald Alsop ruled March 10 in
St. Paul, Minn., that the certification requirement for
federal education loans probably violated students'
contitutional rights against self-incrimination. But
Department of Education officials took the position
that Alsop's preliminary injunction barring the re
quirement applied only to Alsop's judicial district in
Minnesota.
Department of Justice lawyers, in a letter Friday that
a Department of Education official described as
"strongly worded," warned that continuing to re
quire aid applicants to complete the certification on
their "student aid report" could run afoul of Alsop's
order.
Spokesmen for both departments refused to make
the letter public, contending that it is "a privileged
document" protected by "the attorney-client rela
tionship." But the advice appears to have caused De
partment of Education officials to soften their hard
line on the requirement.
As a result, prospects that the draft certification rule
will be applied to student loan applications for the
1983-84 school year have dimmed further.
The Department of Justice letter, according to
sources who have seen it, made clear that the govern
ment will continue to seek a final ruling upholding
the constitutionality of the requirement, which Con
gress passed overwhelmingly and President Reagan
signed into law Sept. 8.
Alsop has yet to rule on a Minnesota Civil Liberties
Union request for a permanent injunction, which the
Department of Justice said it would await before ap
pealing.
Sources said that as a result of the Department of
Justice's warning, the Department of Education plans
to write to about 6000 student aid officers around the
nation advising them that schools may no longer re
quire students applying for federal aid to certify that
they have registered for the draft.
