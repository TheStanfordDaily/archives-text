Arms control pact chances slim
Washington — There is little chance for a U.S.-Sovi
et arms control agreement in the foreseeable future,
members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
said yesterday after a confidential and unusually
gloomy briefing from the top U.S. arms negotiators.
Lawmakers disagreed about who is to blame, with
Republicans tending to hold the Soviets responsible
and Democrats allotting a large share of the responsi
bility to what they see as Reagan administration mis
handling.
Senators who spoke to reporters, however, agreed
that prospects seem poor for early progress in the Ge
neva negotiations on medium-range missiles in Eu
rope. Their reports contrasted with the adminis

tration's official "hope" that the Soviets will bargain
seriously on the basis of President Reagan's recent
"interim" stand.
Another feature of the closed meeting, according
to participants, was a new explanation by retired Gen.
Edward Rowny, the chief strategic arms negotiator, of
a controversial memorandum that he handed to Ken
neth Adelman, the administration's embattled nomi
nee for director of the Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency.
After publication of reports about the memo,
which sharply criticized other members of his nego
tiating team, Rowny claimed that it did not represent
his views but was only "informal talking points" pre
pared by staff aides. Senators said Rowny went further

yesterday, telling the committee that he had not read
the document at the time he delivered it to Adelman.
Thisexplanation appearstoconflict with Adelman's
private description of the memo as "Ed Rowny's con
fidential views on people." For this reason, it may
further complicate the task of obtaining confirmation
of Adelman in a Senate floor debate scheduled to be
gin Monday.
Student loan/draft link overruled
Washington — The Department of Justice, warning
the Department of Education that it may be in con
tempt of court, has advised it to stop requiring male
student loan applicants to certify that they have regis
tered for the military draft, it was learned yesterday.

U.S. District Judge Donald Alsop ruled March 10 in
St. Paul, Minn., that the certification requirement for
federal education loans probably violated students'
contitutional rights against self-incrimination. But
Department of Education officials took the position
that Alsop's preliminary injunction barring the re
quirement applied only to Alsop's judicial district in
Minnesota.
Department of Justice lawyers, in a letter Friday that
a Department of Education official described as
"strongly worded," warned that continuing to re
quire aid applicants to complete the certification on
their "student aid report" could run afoul of Alsop's
order.
