## France gets tough with Soviets; 47 expelled as spies Agent's death is related 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
France's mass expulsion of Soviet diplomats
and other officials Tuesday could be at least
partially connected with the mysterious killing
of one of its top secret-service agents in Febru
ary.
When the body of Lt. Col. Bernard Nut was
discovered on a winding mountain road north of
the southern port of Nice with his Smith and
Wesson .357 Magnum near his head, his col
leagues in the French intelligence community in
sisted at first that he had committed suicide.
This theory was soon discarded, however, and
this week word leaked out from investigators
that the 47-year-old agent had been murdered,
probably by a close friend or associate.
The most tantalizing hypothesis raised so far
forNut'smurderisthathe was killed by a double
agent because he knew too much about Soviet
Bloc espionage operations in Italy and southern
France. His work for the Alpine division of the
France's DGSE foreign intelligence agency took
him frequently to Italy, where he was reportedly
involved in the unmasking earlier this year of

KGB colonel, Viktor Pronin. who worked in the
Aeroflot office in Rome and was caught with
microfilms of western defense plans.
Much remains mysterious about the affair,
and it is impossible to confirm reports in the
French press that Nut may also have been in
volved in assisting the Italian secret service in
investigating the so-called "Bulgarian connec
tion" in the attempted assassination of Pope
John Paul II in 1981.
French intelligence sources have said that Nut
was "on a mission " at the time of his death on
Feb. 15, but have refused to specify exactly what
it was. Nut himself told collegues that he had a
meeting with a contact in the mountains above
Nice.
An autopsy on Nut showed that he had con
sumed food and alcohol less than three hours
before his death, and one of the hypotheses
on which investigators are now working is that
he dined with his murderer. Forensic evidence
suggests that the killer acted very quickly and
did not take careful aim. It also proves conclu
sively that Nut could not have shot himself.
