# French attempt to stop espionage
## Action may be tied with defection 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire
services
The French government's
expulsion of 47 Soviet diplo
mats and two journalists on ac
cusations of spying has put a
rare spotlight on the shredded
struggle between the Kremlin
and the counter-espionage
agencies of the West.
When the news broke, the
French action appeared to be
linked to the defection last
June of Vladimire Kuzichkin, a
Soviet KGB officer, who was
presumably identifying Krem
lin agents in Western Europe.
The Soviet officer defected to
the British, and the French ex
pulsions followed the deporta
tion of three Soviet citizens by
the British government last
week and after others had
been thrown out of other
European countries earlier this
year.
But according to U.S. intelli
gence sources interviewed in
Washington on Tuesday, the
French crackdown had been
long in preparation and was
due more to dogged coun
terintelligence surveillance
than to new information from a
single defector or double
agent.
And the immediate trigger
for the French move may have
been the discovery of some
particularly blatant—but thus
far undisclosed—Soviet es
pionage attempt that violated
the unwritten rules governing
what is acceptable conduct by
intelligence agencies operat
ing in foreign countries.
While spying is illegal, all
governments engage in it and
up to a point tolerate it within
their own borders. But actions
by foreign agents that are seen
as going beyond tolerable lim
its can bring quick retaliation,
the sources said, refusing to be
identified.
Another important factor in
the French decision to act, they

said, is that the mass
expulsion — the largest in
French history—served as a
graphic demostration of that
the Socialist government of
President Francois Mitterrand,
despite the two communists in
its Cabinet, was tougher to
ward Moscow that Mitter
rand's conservative predeces
sor or than many conservative
European governments.
The sources said that Mit
terrand had always shown
greater determination to cur-

tail Soviet espionage than
former President Valery Gis
card d'Estaing, whom he de
feated in 1981.
He has a long memory, one
source said, referring to the
fact that Mitterrand has blamed
Moscow for his defeat by Gis
card in the 1978 elections,
when the French Communist
Party, instead of giving Mit
terrand key support as it did
when he triumphed two years
later, suddenly withdrew its
cooperation in the middle of
the campaign.
Mitterrand apparently be
lieved reports, which were
widespread at the time, that
the French communists pulled
out under orders from the
Kremlin.
The largest previous mass
expulsion of Soviet spies,
which occurred in 1971 when

Britain threw out 105 Russians,
is generally attributed to the
defection of a single Soviet
KGB agent. Parallels with that
British case led initially to
speculation that a lone defec
tor was also the precipitating
factor in the French case.
However, one source said
that the surfacing of a defector
from a Soviet espion
vice, whether the KGB or the
Soviet military intelligence
agency called the GRU, may
only have provided an oppor-

tunity for a Western govern
ment to take the kind of strong
action against Moscow that
had been contemplated but
postponed for a long time.
Such a defection, it was ex
plained, makes it possible for
western intelligence agencies
to cloud the real source or
sources of information that led
to the identification of Soviet
diplomats as spies. Such
sources might be double
agents, working for both the
Western government and the
Soviets. They are often ethnic
Russians forced to spy for
Moscow under threat of harm
to relatives still in Russia.
Exposure of those sources as
a result of a crackdown could
not only jeopardize those rela
tives but also end the double
agent's value, it was said. As a
result, a Western may prefer to

maintain close watch over
known intelligence operatives
from a foreign embassy, feed
ing them wrong information as
well as correct data of relatively
small value, rather than expel
them immediately.
Expulsions of Soviet agents
also risk reprisals in Moscow
against Western diplomats,
some of whom are presumably
also engaged in espionage ac
tivities and probably known to
the counterintelligence de
partment of the Soviet KGB.
It is for that reason that mass
expulsion such as the French
move often are ordered to take
advantage of the cover pro
vided by a known defection.
Because at least some of the
Soviet officials now expelled
had been previously identified
as agents, the conclusion was
the defecting KGB agent was
not the cause for French ac
tion.
The official French statement
on the expulsions cited the
"frequency and gravity of the
acts" by the expelled Soviets.
But sources pointed to two ear
lier incidents:
—The murder in February in
the south of France of a French
intelligence officer. Police said
he was killed by an "acquain
tance" but there was specula
tion that the incident was
linked to the present case.
—The arrest last week of a
25-year-old Frenchman, who
had worked for a state-owned
French company. He is
charged with passing secrets to
one of the five Soviet commer
cial attaches expelled Tuesday.
That arrest was reportedly one
of several important moves by
French counterintelligence
agents recently.
Before the current incident,
the Soviets were caught trying
to steal secrets on the most ad
vanced French fighter plane,
the Mirage 2000, in February
1980, three months before Mit
terrand took office.
