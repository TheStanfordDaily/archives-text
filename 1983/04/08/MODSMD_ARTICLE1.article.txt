# Chemistry prof. denies Honor Code violation charge
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Council of Presidents member Mark Eps
tein named Chemistry Prof, lames Collman
the target of his Honor Code violation
charges last night. Epstein alleged that Col
lman has broken University policies by hav
ing TAs proctor examinations. Collman de
nied that his actions were violations of the
Honor Code.
After a meeting with Collman yesterday,
Epstein said he would take his charges to
Chemistry Department Chairman john
Brauman and Assoc. Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences David Kennedy
next week.
Collman said the TAs were needed in the
room during the exams to answer students'
questions and that they were not proctoring
the exams.
'Maybe what I'm doing is considered
proctoring," Collman said. "But I would
continue to do it for a quick response to
student questions. I try to do my job the best

I can, and I don't have time for things like
this."
But University Ombudsman John Go
heen, a member of the Honor Code Com
mission, said that when TAs stay in test
rooms students have reason to believe they
are proctoring.
"The typical procedure is for the TAs to be

outside the room to answer questions, and if
they're inside, I see that as proctoring," Go
heen said.
Epstein and Collman both said that having
Ms in exam rooms is a common practice in
the Chemistry Department.
Goheen said that, should Epstein's case go
that far, the Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences "has the right as the dean to take
measures to correct the situation. He would
look at the situation and decide what would
be done." Goheen would not speculate
what action, in any, the Dean would take.
Epstein said the mere presence of the TAs
in the exam rooms is a violation of University
policy. Epstein cited academic policies that
state that an instuctor must "leave the test
room after the first ten minutes and not re
turn except to transmit additional instruc
tions concerning test and/or to collect the
exams at the end of the period.
lunior Peter Green, a TA in Collman's
Chemistry 131 course winter quarter, said
that, although he and other TAs remained in

the examination room, they did not proctor
the examinations.
"We sat down in the front of the room,
taking the podium as our waiting area. I
worked on a take-home exam of my own,
and another TA read a book. We weren't
walking down the aisles, looking over
peoples' shouldersâ€”that I would call proc
toring," Green said.
But Green said that in "time-pressured"
tests like those in Collman's classes, "any bit
of time" going outside the room to find a TA
is "time that can't be spent."
Epstein said he has "offered Collman
every opportunity until the final step of this
thing to stop proctoring. But he is a very
stubborn man. My meeting with him was
completely unproductive. I didn't make
much ground at all. All I've asked him to do
is the bare minimum for what I consider
acceptable, that his TAs not proctor," Eps
tein said.
Collman said he believes that Epstein is
trying to "make an issue out of something.

He seems to be fairly interested in his inves
tigative powers, or maybe he's just at ting as
a self-rightous person. I believe it's the lat
ter," Collman said.
Epstein said he has been working to keep
Collman from leaving TAs in test rooms
through the entire year. In an effort to se
cure evidence of proctoring, Epstein took
photographs at the beginning of Collman's
winter quarter final examination and col
lected signatures of students who believed
they were being proctored.
"I have signatures of 23 students who say
they saw TAs in the front of the room with
their heaos up," Epstein said.
"This guy Epstein wrote me a letter that
was somewhat insulting that said I proctor
examinations. But the practices I engage in
that he considers to be proctoring are the
same things my colleagues do and that I've
been doing for 17 years," Collman said.
Epstein claims the precedent set by the


James Collman
Chemistry Department of leaving
TAs in exam rooms is a hard thing to
fight.
According to Epstein, students,
unlike professors, are often
penalized for violating the Honor
Code. Epstein claimed that when
students work as TAs proctoring
exams, they are in violation of the
Honor Code and "their academic
positions are in jeopardy" since the
could be penalized for Honor Code
violations.
Epstein explained that Collman's
TAs are in a "difficult position in that
they are both students and employ
ees."
"My concern is that theTAs should
be protected in their dual role of stu
dents and employees. I would like to
stop Collman from proctoring too,
but I had hoped to protect the stu
dents in the meantime, and then re
solve it so it wasn't a personal issue,
so I didn't have to charge him per

sonally. But Prof. Collman hasn't left
me that room. I either have to do
nothing or charge him, and I don't
think I have a choice. People aren't
elected to do nothing," Epstein said.
According to Epstein, TAs in the
exam room discovered a student
using a crib sheet during one of Col
lman's winter quarter midterms. Eps
tein said that the student was disci
plined for violating the Honor Code
after he was caught cheating by stu
dents who, he claimed, were proc
toring the exam.
Collman said that this was not the
case. "There was an incident in my
class last quarter for the first time in
my 17 years here. A student sus
pected of cheating was reported to
my TAs by other students. The TAs
alerted me, and I went to the rlass
and became appraised of the situa
tion, which was that this student had
a crib sheet with a succinct list of
information from the second part of
the quarter. The student has since
talked to the dean of students about
the matter," Collman explained.
Collman said he would not say if

any action was taken against the stu
dent because the issue was "an indi
vidual matter of the students and his
rights."
Epstein claims that the absence of
an "exclusionary rule" in the Honor
Code allows professors to use evi
dence they obtain while they them
selves are violating the code.
"What incentive do they have not
to violate the Honor Code? None,
except for honor," Epstein said.
