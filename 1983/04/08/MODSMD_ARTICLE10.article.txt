# Career Week:
## dress for success 
### KATHY BODOVITZ 
If you haven't found a job
yet, it may be because you've
been wearing the wrong color
suit to your interviews. For
both men and women, navy
blue "wins hands down" as the
most preferred interview
color, with grey, plain or
pinstriped coming in a close
second.
This fashion advice came
from representatives of Casual
Corner and Grodins speaking
on "How to Dress for the Job
Interview" Wednesday. The
program was one of 15 spon
sored by the Career Planning
and Placement Center during
this week's "Career Week."
Other programs included
"Careers in Sales and Market
ing, "Careers in Energy,"
"The Self-Directed job Search''
and Dual Career Couples."
Career Week is an innova
tion this year, according to its
coordinator Hector Cuevas,
that "came about after careful
assessment of last year's pro
grams." In past years the CPPC
has offered career programs
throughout theyear, but notall
were well-attended. The deci
sion was thus made to con
dense the programs and offer
them all during one week.
The first Career Week was
held winter quarter and
Cuevas said it was very suc
cessful, with an average of 40
people at each program. "We
wanted to try it in the spring
with the same quality but
smaller in scope."
Whether sunshine or satisfac
tion with present wardrobes
was responsible for the limited
turnout, the "How to Dress"
program was attended by
fewer than 20 people, seven of
whom were CPPC employees.
lanet Griffin and Debra
Wolger of Casual Corner, a
women's clothing store in the
Stanford Shopping Center,
said that women should dress
conservatively for the first
interview. Closed-toe shoes
and a classic-cut suit are essen

should br"in the hloiiir, ;ind
not in the suit itself. "No-nos"
for the first interview include
red or "California white" suits,
over-accessorizing yourself,
and most of all, pants.
While dressing conserva
tively is important, Griffin and
Wolger said that does not pre
clude your own touches, such
as a ruffle blouse which is
"nice, conservative, yet
feminine."
For men, Kevin Bruechert,
manager of Grodins men's
clothing store also in the Stan
ford Shopping Center, said,
"The navy blue suit is a clas
sic," and recommended "stay

"ng with navy. Grey and
medium blue were his second
and third choices, and he
counseled "staying away from
browns, camels and tans."
Bruechert suggested white,
blue or crepe shirt colors and a
•ie that is "bold but not over
powering" such as burgundy,
should coordinate with
the suit color, and can be
lace-up or loafers, which ever
is most comfortable, but
make sure they're clean and
polished."
Quoting a survey of job in
terviewees, Bruechert noted
four types of people who have
a definite advantage at getting
a job." The first is people who
are good-looking. Their odds
are three to four times better.
Second are people from
upper-middle class back
grounds because they tend to
express themselves well and to
be self-assured. Athletic
people come in third because
they are at ease with their
mannerisms, and those in the
acting field are fourth.
So now you know how to
dress, but where do you go
from there? Panelists in the
"Women in Management"
program were inspired as well
as encouraging.
Jean Fetter, associate dean for
graduate studies and research,
discussed several essentials for
success in management.
"There is no doubt that there
has to be an enormous amount
of hard work and preparation"
in finding position, "so choose
something you like and give it
your all."
The second requirement,
Fetter said, is persistence and
resilience — the ability to pick
yourself up when you're
knocked down. Confidence is
also a necessity. "You have to
be willing to speak up when
you believe in something."
Another essential is daring.
"Be willing to take a risk and
take on something you think
you can't do. Thinking about it
is always worse than doing it."
Fetter also listed flexibility,
perspective and
humor as valuable characteris
tics in coping with the working
world.
Linda Graebner, director of
marketingat Crown Zellerbach
Corp., also encouraged self
confidence. "Once I relaxed
and said I know I can do this,'
everything fell into place."
All the panelists agreed that
the future for women in man
agement looks promising. Fet
ter's example was Stanford
University. "Stanford has six
vice presidents — all men, and
seven deans — all men. There's
only one way for women in
university management to go
— up."
