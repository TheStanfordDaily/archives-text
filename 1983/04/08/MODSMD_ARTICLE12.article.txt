## The 						Stanford Daily Separate but equal housing 
### 
Last week the University Committee on Stu
dent Scrvices-Residences announced several
substantive changes in the housing draw tor
next year. Changes in the draw, which will take
place April 19-22, include plans to allow stu
dents to exercise the returning-resident option
only once, to prevent student draw groups from
being split up among several different resi
dences and to place 44 graduate students in
various cooperatives that were previously for
undergraduates only.
The first two changes will ensure a more
equitable draw this year and in later years, since
they will allow more students to live in the "bet
ter" houses.
On the surface the decision to open a total of
44 spots in all the cooperatives (Columbae,
Synergy, Hammerskjold, Terra, Phi Psi and
Theta Chi) seems to us a sensible one. Last year
the demand among undergraduates for these
spaces was generally low, and the opening of
Governor's Corner will lead to even less de
mand for on-campus housing.
However, on closer examination this plan is
flawed. We do not mean to suggest that
graduates should be denied housing—the Uni
versity should commit itself to building
graduate housing within the near future.
However, combining undergraduates and
graduates in the same residences strikes us as,
at best, a short-sighted interim solution to a
problem that demands more far-sighted plan
ning.
Graduates and undergraduates are two
different kinds of students. Graduate students
are engaged in intensive research in one par
ticular area of knowledge; because of this, their

residential needs are different. This is not to
suggest that graduate students are "nerds" who
never engage in extra-curricular activities, but
to recognize that the demands of advanced de
gree programs here are such that school often
must come before play.
Undergraduates, by contrast, are here to ob
tain a broader, less intensive education. Under
graduate residences are set up with this in
mind: attention is paid to arranging field trips to
the City, group outings, parties and other un
dergraduate "things to do."
Although mixing undergraduates and
graduates sounds like an easy solution to a nag
ging problem, we believe it will lead to more
basic problems. Graduate students will have dif
ficulty studying and living in an undergraduate,
while undergraduates will find more problems
organizing social activities in a more intense
academic atmosphere.
But a need for graduate housing still exists.
We suggest that the 1 Iniversity consolidate the
coops involved, reduce their number by one
and open this house to graduates only.
Graduate students will find the ideal environ
ment for their academic pursuits (and their
extra-curricular activities) while under
graduates will continue to live in houses de
signed to meet their needs.
Meanwhile, the University should commit it
self to a long-term solution to graduate housing
woes, so that some day all who wish to live on
campus will be given the opportunity. Short
term solutions to long-term problems may seem
like a nice quick-fix, but they cause more prob
lems than they solve.
