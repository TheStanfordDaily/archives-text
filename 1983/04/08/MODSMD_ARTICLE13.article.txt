## Joint ABM system a necessity 
### 
"Long ago, in a solar system far, far
away, there was a civilized planet
called Earth. There were two major
countries on the planet, each about
equal in size and military strength.
Each had tremendous weapons that
could destroy the entire population
of (/?<• p/.»/7 112 r rr» «* rt y f/n»es o\sc r.
Though citizens from both countries
pleaded with their leaders to reduce
or eliminate these terrible weapons,
the countries could never agree on a
way to control their mighty arsenals.
In the end, an accident set off the
nuclear holocaust that destroyed
both nations; the aftereffects of the
disaster soon eliminated all higher
forms of life on the planet. Many
modern historians contend the en
tire affair could have been prevented
if only the countries had worked to
gether. . .
An excerpt from a future alien his
tory book? Very probably—if the
United States and the Soviet Union
continue their dangerous roles as
nuclear adversaries. A new power
balance is needed if the human race
is to survive the nuclear age. The new
balance involves the cooperation of
the two superpowers in controlling
the nuclear arsenals of the entire
world by developinga global antibal
listic missile (ABM) system.
Much of the debate in the past few
weeks concerning the possibility of
the United States employing a
space-based ABM system has been
one-dimensional; that is, propo
nents and critics alike have consid
ered the threat of nuclear war to be a
struggle between the two super
powers—us against then, good guys
vs. bad guys. If this unilateral think
ing continues, we are on the road
toward an endless arms race in
space, an inevitable 21st century ver
sion of Star Wars that neither country
can afford nor endure with any
semblance of stability.
On the other hand, to do nothing
now and rely solely on arms negotia
tions and deterrence is equally as
dangerous. Though deterrence has
"worked" to prevent nuclear war for
four decades, many recognize that
we have been merely lucky so far.
When the ABM treaty was signed
with the Soviets in 1972 as part of
SALT I, implicit was the understand
ing that no rational country would
ever launch a nuclear attack if it knew
it was assured self-destruction.

1 his policy of mutually-assured de
struction is unsettling enough when
applied to the United States and the
Soviet Union, but consider for a
moment the day in the not-too-dis
tant future when the Khomeni-like
regimes of the Middle East will be able
to pose «i r»uc/«,ir f<>o. Oin fheso
countries seriously be considered ra
tional? When dealing with nations
whose political ideologies are so
foreign to us, deterrence stands on
pretty shaky ground.
Further, imagine a scenario in the
year 2010 where a terrorist group
takes over the missile control
facilities of one of these smaller
countries. With the group's only goal
to destroy America, or at least harm it
in some irreparable way, they would
care little for their own safety;
hence, deterrence would have no ef
fect. In fact, the United States could
not rationally retaliate with nuclear
weapons, killing people in a country
that did not attack. The satisfaction of
destroying a terrorist group could
never offset the ruthless incineration
of one of our major cities.
Another very serious considera
tion that neither superpower has
come to terms with is the accidental
launching of a nuclear warhead. This
is becoming a distinct possibility with
the increasing reliance on computers
for control of missile systems. Many
false reports of Soviet attack have
been documented within the last two
decades, some caused by human er
ror, while others were the result of
faulty integrated - circuit chips!
The question of confirmation of at
tack is a complex one that requires a
nearly instantaneous decision.
When are you sure an attack has
been launched? Do you trust your
detection systems or wait until a mis
sile has landed, after which it may be
too late? An accidental catastrophe
and such weighty decisions could be
avoided by employing an effective
ABM system.
In short, man has created a mons
ter. Man must now control its beast
as well as he can. It is time for the
United States and the Soviet Union to
reconsider their policy of deterrence
and seriously negotiate an effective
restraint on this incredible waste of
human and natural resources. Both
countries are financially burdened
by tremendous defense budgets, the
Soviets more so than the United

States.
The time has never been better to
halt the unnecessary offensive de
fense projects of both countries and
work together to eliminate the nu
clear threat of both nations. This tan
be done only with a concerted effort
on fwo fronts: uci n g the* nuc lf*ar
arsenals of both countries consid
erably and engaging in an all-out
joint research and development ef
fort to produce a worldwide nuclear
defense network.
It is crucial that this defense net
work be a joint effort between
American and Soviet scientists and
engineers so that neither country will
attempt to undermine the system.
The crucial "power balance" would
be maintained by a system that
would be equally effective for either
side.
Can an effective system be con
structed? Space-based or not, the
technology for such a system is
probably not as futuristic as critics
have claimed. David Packard and
Edward Teller, among others, claim a
"fully effective" missile defense sys
tem could be designed with today's
technology. In a joint effort, the
American lead in electronics and
guidance control coupled with the
Soviet lead in laser technology could
work to shorten the development
time of such a system. It took only
seven years to progress from fission
to the atomic bomb. Though this
could take much longer, much could
be gained, both scientifically and di
plomatically, in an unprecedented
mutual effort between the United
States and the Soviet Union to har
ness the most malevolent creature in
the history of mankind.
However great the technical bar
rier to developing such a system, it is
miniscule in comparison to the gar
gantuan diplomatic feat required to
bring the two superpowers together
to work on such a project. Until then,
we must continue arms reduction
negotiations and live by our policy of
deterrence, however disconcerting.
Calling the Soviet Union "the focus
of evil in the modern world." as our
President did, will achieve nothing.
Cooperation between the super
powers in this concern is essential to
end the arms race and achieve world
peace.
