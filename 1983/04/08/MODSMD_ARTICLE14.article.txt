# Freedom of speech is a myth
## 
### 
We Americans glorify our intellec
tual freedom. The freedom of speech
is praised as a necessary virtue of
government by reactionaries and
radicals alike. On examination of re
ality, however, we don't find the
much revered free and open
exchange of ideas. Instead we dis
cover both direct and indirect
means of suppressing some of them.
Examples of direct suppression are
numerous. Many can be found in var
ious levels of our educational sys
tem. At the public school level are
the obvious "concerned parents" or
"involved citizens" groups that take
on the responsibility of overseeing
the educational process. In many
cases, the term "citizen censorship
organizations" would be more ap
propriate in describing these groups.
The activities of these self-appointed
vigilantes of truth and morality range
from preventing "dangerous" texts
from being used to trying, and suc
ceeding, in removing "offensive"
books from library shelves.
Another way in which "concerned
parents" can become "involved" is
by applying pressure to school
boards regarding the hiring and fir
ing of teachers. This is the primary
reason why Marxists can't become
high school history teachers in this
country. For most schools, "main
stream" history, or an interpretation
slightly right of center, is the only
type of history taught. This means
that the attitudes of most Americans
are formed in a conservative mode.
More important is that once deter
mined, these ideas are rarely if ever
challenged.
For the few Americans that not
only go to college but also take
courses in the social sciences, the

"good-old-fashioned-patriotic-
America-can-do- no-wrong- never
has-never-will" inteipretations must
be unlearned before more balanced
perspectives can renlace them. It is
important to remember here that
flaming radical high school teachers
do indeed exist in America; it is as
important to remember that these
are by far the exception and not the
rule.
Even the University is not free
of direct intellectual suppression. In
illustrating this point, an example
from our own biology department
comes to mind. Biology 44 is the core
biology lab class. As it is now ar
ranged, there are open labs (as op
posed to students attending weekly
at a specified time) supervised by
undergraduate TAs. Students are ex
pected to learn a given biological sys
tem and then devise (heir own exper
iment to answer questions they have
about the system. All in all, this man
datory pass/no credit class is enjoyed
by the vast majority of students who
take it. It is one of the few, possibly
the only, "pre-med"class that en
courages (even requires) imagina
tion, creativity, curiosity; in short,
the ability to think. Let it be remarked
here that Stanford is one of the few
schools with this set-up.
Thiscourse, nevertheless, is under
attack because of its flexibility. Pro
posed changes will replace the
three-year-old program with a more
traditional, graded, "cookbook"
type lab. This structure is preferred
because it teaches undergraduates
the techniques they need. It is thus
implied that the ability to apply the
scientific method to concrete prob
lems is far outweighed by the ability
to prepare culture plates. Under
graduates who are supposedly ma
ture enough to plan their own cur
riculum as well as career are,

nevertheless, incapable of intelli
gently designing their own experi
ments for a biology class.
As opposed to the above exam
ples, indirect suppression is less bla
tent and is yet more powerful. The
university is a garden spot for finding
examples of indirect suppression.
Whenever a scholar is denied re
search funding because of the vol
atile nature of his ideas, there is indi
rect suppression.
Whenever a book can't get pub
lished because it espouses unpopu
lar sentiments, there is indirect sup
pression.
Whenever students are forced to
choose careers not according to their
primary interests but according to fi
nancial considerations, there is indi- I
rect suppression.
When in class we make an effort to
write what we think the professor be-
lleves rnstead of what we twlievc soâ„¢
that we can get good grades and thus
get into business, law, or medical
schools, there is indirect suppres
sion.
We thus see that these indirect
forms of repression are directly at
tributable to economic causes. The
nature of our economic system is
such that the value of any thing, ser
vice, or idea is based on the price it
fetches in the market or "real
world." New ideas, especially those
that question the soundness and
fairness of the economic system are
greeted with hostility in the "mar
ketplace" of ideas.
Regardless of how much and often
we extol the virtues of "free" speech,
we methodically and ceremoniously
instill in the following generation our
own biases, prejudices, and
closed-mindedness. Both direct and
indirect means of repression are
simply methods of conveying these
three unsung values.
