# LETTER
## Mosher case 
### 
To paraphrase Robert Wesson's
letter (Daily, March 29), it is fair to ask
whether a senior research fellow at
the Hoover Institution can take the
trouble to check his facts before he
leaps to hasty and incorrect conclu
sions.
Wesson repeats the canard that
Steven Mosher was expelled from
the Ph.D. program for publishing in
formation on the Chinese birth con
trol program. The Anthropology De
partment (on March 7), released a
part of the Report of the Investigating
Committee which is quite explicit on
this point: "We feel that although
the Chinese are clearly linking
Mosher's article to the restrictions
they are imposing on foreign schol
ars, we cannot hold Mosher respon
sible for actions the Chinese are tak
ing. Although we believe that
Mosher was unwise to publish his
article in a popular Taiwanese weekly
where it would he read as a political
attack on the PRC, we cannot judge
this act to be misconduct, both be
cause we are not convinced that
Mosher fully understood the impli
cations of his choice of publishing
medium and because we believe that
Mosher's right to publish where he
chooses is protected by the right to
freedom of speech."
The unanimous finding of the fac
ulty, reached by secret ballot, that
Mosher committed illegal and seri
ously unethical acts is based on per
suasive evidence that cannot be re
vealed without endangering inno
cent persons. Mosher has stated in
writing that the crucial evidence
against him would physically en
danger innocent persons and appro
priately he has not released that criti
cal information.
