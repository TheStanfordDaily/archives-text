# Computing not gender-neutral: females more intimidated
## 
### KAREN DACHEY 
Women could be cutting
themselves out of the job mar
ket by cold-shouldering com
puters.
Designing and selling these
modern-day marvels has be
come a billion-dollar business,
lust knowing how to use a
computer can guarantee a
paycheck.
But studies have found that
the culture of computing is
overwhelmingly male. And
now a survey of Stanford stu
dents shows that men are
much more likely than women
to use computers and to have
positive attitudes toward them.
When asked whether they
had used computers during a
Communications Department
survey, 39 percent of the 529
students surveyed said "yes."
A breakdown by sex showed
that half of the men had used
computers as compared with
just under a quarter of the
women respondents.
Not surprisingly, perhaps,
more women than men said

they were worried that they
would not have the skills to be
able to adapt to the computer
revolution. The proportion of
male students who confessed
to such a fear was 13 percent as
compared to 22 percent of the
female students.
More than a third of the
women students surveyed
were worried that computers
will make our society too tech
nical. Almost a quarter of the
male students felt the same
way.
And a much higher propor
tion of women than men felt
intimidated by computers—a
third of them compared with 17
percent of their male counter
parts.
"I think that computers can
be intimidating," said a senior in
political science and communi
cation. "I think guys are as in
timidated but they just don't
admit it."
But the same difference be
tween the sexes was found
when respondents were asked
whether they thought com
puters would have a de
humanizing effect on society.
More than half the female stu
dents as compared with 38 per
cent of the males believed that
computers would have this ef
fect.
And when students were
asked whether they agreed
that computers will help indi

viduals to be more creative,
three quarters of the male re
spondents said "yes." Just over
half the women agreed.
The survey's findings did not
surprise Henry Walker, an as
sistant professor who teaches
the sociology of gender here.
"I have read several items
recently which indicated that
this is basically a uniform find
ing throughout the country,"
he said.
Walker suggested that the
differences between the sexes
in their levels of computer use
and attitudes toward comput
ers stem from feelings about
appropriate behavior for men
and women in society.
"Computers are initially as
sociated with math and unfor
tunately it is still the case that
women are discouraged from
developing math skills," he
said. "There comes a time at
certain stages in the educa
tional process when girls are
either subtly discouraged from
pursuing math or explicitly told
that they should do something
else."
Walker stressed that such
differences are the result of so
cial, rather than genetic fac
tors.
"It's been demonstrated that
differences in math tests usu
ally seem to appear around the
age of 10 or 11," he said. "That
suggests that there's a social

process at work."
The survey's findings leave
no doubt as to which way the
social process works for men.
Several male students, now ac -
tively involved in computer
use, acknowledged that they'd
been encouraged by family
and friends.
Sandy Gillard, for example,
was an "electronics buff" as a
c hild and is now studying for a
master's degree in computer
science.
"My father always gave me
great encouragement," he
said.
Scientifically-inclined girls
are more likely to encounter
skepticism than support. But
when they are given the type of
encouragement that is typically
reserved for boys, they can
successfully overcome the
countervailing influences of
societal stereotyping.
Gillard's family background
is a case in point. Unusually,
perhaps, his two sisters re
ceived the same sort of support
that he enjoyed. Both went on
to study engineering.
And Susan johnson, one of
the few female master's stu
dents in Stanford's computer
science department, is con
vinced that parental encour
agement played a crucial role
in her career choice.
"It's definitely made a
difference that I had such en

couragement from my par
ents," she said. "If I hadn't had
it, I probably would have done
foreign languages."
Johnson, who worked for
three years as a computer pro
grammer before enrolling
here, does not come from a
scientific background.
"But I guess my parents felt
that math and science were
very important and that I had
talent," she said.
lohnson recalled that she
was "definitely encouraged to
take a lot of math in high
school." She was, she added,
the only girl in the calculus
class.
Yet lohnson insisted that
women who aren't mathemat
ically minded should not be
leery of computers.
"I don't think math should
stop them," she said. "If
doesn't have to be a very math
ematical profession at all."
Only a quarter of Johnson's
231 fellow students in the all
graduate computer science
department are female. And
here, as at most universities,
women are significantly
under-represented in courses
where computer use is a re
quirement. There are about a
quarter more males than
female students in the univer
sity as a whole but in the en
gineering school, for example,
men outnumber women by

more than five to one. Only 432
of the 2697 engineering stu
dents are women.
The imbalance is reflected in
computer classes which are
recommended as part of the
engineering requirement.
"Half our students come
from the engineering depart
ment," said Bjorn Strand, who
introduces a computer-taught
philosophy course to an intake
of 100 students each quarter.
"As only 20 percent of students
in engineering are women,
that ration is reflected in the
engineering students that we
take," he said.
The women who do enroll in
computer classes may be con
sidered the fortunate few,
if—as 93 percent of the stu
dents surveyed believe —
learning how to use computers
gives one marketable skills.
"Clearly the importance of
computer skills as an entry into
the job market is consider
able," Henry Walker said.
Rick Reis, until recently a
science and engineering
placement director at Stan
ford's Career Planning and
Placement Center, agreed. He
said about 80 percent of the
engineering students he
helped each year were male
but was unable to give details
about computer science
graduates—for a very good
reason.

"Given the high demand for
computer science people, not
all that many tame to see me,"
Reis said. "They could find jobs
on their own."
Most women, said Susan
Johnson, just haven't thought
of computing as a possible
career.
"A lot of women haven't
considered anything other
than the traditional women's
jobs of teaching, nursing and
occupational therapy," she
said.
But the connection between
computer literacy and career
opportunities was clearly rec
ognized by the vast majority of
women surveyed—9B percent
of them agreed that computers
give people marketable skills.
And many of those whose
majors are not in relevant sub
jects claim that they intend to
learn computer skills.
"I want to be literate, com
puter literate," said Rachel
Bagby, a third-year law stu
dent. "I want my skills to be
marketable."
But the overall picture pre
sented by the survey findings is
that far fewer female than male
students use computers and
that they are much more likely
to feel intimidated by them.
The reason, say sociologists,
is social conditioning.
Computer scientists might
call it programming.

And many of those whose
majors are not in relevant sub
jects claim that they intend to
learn computer skills.
"I want to be literate, com
puter literate," said Rachel
Bagby, a third-year law stu
dent. "I want my skills to be
marketable."
But the overall picture pre
sented by the survey findings is
that far fewer female than male
students use computers and
that they are much more likely
to feel intimidated by them.
The reason, say sociologists,
is social conditioning.
Computer scientists might
call it programming.
Women could be cutting
themselves out of the job mar
ket by cold-shouldering com
puters.
Designing and selling these
modern-day marvels has be
come a billion-dollar business,
lust knowing how to use a
computer can guarantee a
paycheck.
But studies have found that
the culture of computing is
overwhelmingly male. And
now a survey of Stanford stu
dents shows that men are
much more likely than women
to use computers and to have
positive attitudes toward them.
When asked whether they
had used computers during a
Communications Department
survey, 39 percent of the 529
students surveyed said "yes."
A breakdown by sex showed
that half of the men had used
computers as compared with
just under a quarter of the
women respondents.
Not surprisingly, perhaps,
more women than men said

they were worried that they
would not have the skills to be
able to adapt to the computer
revolution. The proportion of
male students who confessed
to such a fear was 13 percent as
compared to 22 percent of the
female students.
More than a third of the
women students surveyed
were worried that computers
will make our society too tech
nical. Almost a quarter of the
male students felt the same
way.
And a much higher propor
tion of women than men felt
intimidated by computers—a
third of them compared with 17
percent of their male counter
parts.
"I think that computers can
be intimidating," said a senior in
political science and communi
cation. "I think guys are as in
timidated but they just don't
admit it."
But the same difference be
tween the sexes was found
when respondents were asked
whether they thought com
puters would have a de
humanizing effect on society.
More than half the female stu
dents as compared with 38 per
cent of the males believed that
computers would have this ef
fect.
And when students were
asked whether they agreed
that computers will help indi

viduals to be more creative,
three quarters of the male re
spondents said "yes." Just over
half the women agreed.
The survey's findings did not
surprise Henry Walker, an as
sistant professor who teaches
the sociology of gender here.
"I have read several items
recently which indicated that
this is basically a uniform find
ing throughout the country,"
he said.
Walker suggested that the
differences between the sexes
in their levels of computer use
and attitudes toward comput
ers stem from feelings about
appropriate behavior for men
and women in society.
"Computers are initially as
sociated with math and unfor
tunately it is still the case that
women are discouraged from
developing math skills," he
said. "There comes a time at
certain stages in the educa
tional process when girls are
either subtly discouraged from
pursuing math or explicitly told
that they should do something
else."
Walker stressed that such
differences are the result of so
cial, rather than genetic fac
tors.
"It's been demonstrated that
differences in math tests usu
ally seem to appear around the
age of 10 or 11," he said. "That
suggests that there's a social

process at work."
The survey's findings leave
no doubt as to which way the
social process works for men.
Several male students, now ac -
tively involved in computer
use, acknowledged that they'd
been encouraged by family
and friends.
Sandy Gillard, for example,
was an "electronics buff" as a
c hild and is now studying for a
master's degree in computer
science.
"My father always gave me
great encouragement," he
said.
Scientifically-inclined girls
are more likely to encounter
skepticism than support. But
when they are given the type of
encouragement that is typically
reserved for boys, they can
successfully overcome the
countervailing influences of
societal stereotyping.
Gillard's family background
is a case in point. Unusually,
perhaps, his two sisters re
ceived the same sort of support
that he enjoyed. Both went on
to study engineering.
And Susan johnson, one of
the few female master's stu
dents in Stanford's computer
science department, is con
vinced that parental encour
agement played a crucial role
in her career choice.
"It's definitely made a
difference that I had such en

couragement from my par
ents," she said. "If I hadn't had
it, I probably would have done
foreign languages."
Johnson, who worked for
three years as a computer pro
grammer before enrolling
here, does not come from a
scientific background.
"But I guess my parents felt
that math and science were
very important and that I had
talent," she said.
lohnson recalled that she
was "definitely encouraged to
take a lot of math in high
school." She was, she added,
the only girl in the calculus
class.
Yet lohnson insisted that
women who aren't mathemat
ically minded should not be
leery of computers.
"I don't think math should
stop them," she said. "If
doesn't have to be a very math
ematical profession at all."
Only a quarter of Johnson's
231 fellow students in the all
graduate computer science
department are female. And
here, as at most universities,
women are significantly
under-represented in courses
where computer use is a re
quirement. There are about a
quarter more males than
female students in the univer
sity as a whole but in the en
gineering school, for example,
men outnumber women by

more than five to one. Only 432
of the 2697 engineering stu
dents are women.
The imbalance is reflected in
computer classes which are
recommended as part of the
engineering requirement.
"Half our students come
from the engineering depart
ment," said Bjorn Strand, who
introduces a computer-taught
philosophy course to an intake
of 100 students each quarter.
"As only 20 percent of students
in engineering are women,
that ration is reflected in the
engineering students that we
take," he said.
The women who do enroll in
computer classes may be con
sidered the fortunate few,
if—as 93 percent of the stu
dents surveyed believe —
learning how to use computers
gives one marketable skills.
"Clearly the importance of
computer skills as an entry into
the job market is consider
able," Henry Walker said.
Rick Reis, until recently a
science and engineering
placement director at Stan
ford's Career Planning and
Placement Center, agreed. He
said about 80 percent of the
engineering students he
helped each year were male
but was unable to give details
about computer science
graduates—for a very good
reason.

"Given the high demand for
computer science people, not
all that many tame to see me,"
Reis said. "They could find jobs
on their own."
Most women, said Susan
Johnson, just haven't thought
of computing as a possible
career.
"A lot of women haven't
considered anything other
than the traditional women's
jobs of teaching, nursing and
occupational therapy," she
said.
But the connection between
computer literacy and career
opportunities was clearly rec
ognized by the vast majority of
women surveyed—9B percent
of them agreed that computers
give people marketable skills.
And many of those whose
majors are not in relevant sub
jects claim that they intend to

Reis said. "They could find jobs
on their own."
Most women, said Susan
Johnson, just haven't thought
of computing as a possible
career.
"A lot of women haven't
considered anything other
than the traditional women's
jobs of teaching, nursing and
occupational therapy," she
said.
But the connection between
computer literacy and career
opportunities was clearly rec
ognized by the vast majority of
women surveyed—9B percent
of them agreed that computers
give people marketable skills.
And many of those whose
majors are not in relevant sub
jects claim that they intend to
learn computer skills.
"I want to be literate, com
puter literate," said Rachel
Bagby, a third-year law stu
dent. "I want my skills to be
marketable."
But the overall picture pre
sented by the survey findings is
that far fewer female than male
students use computers and
that they are much more likely
to feel intimidated by them.
The reason, say sociologists,
is social conditioning.
Computer scientists might
call it programming.
