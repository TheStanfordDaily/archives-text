# It's final: Speakers Bureau off fee ballot
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
The on-the-ballot, off-the-ballot
Speakers Bureau is off again, follow
ing an ASSU election commission
decision yesterday to bump the
bureau from next week's fee assess
ment ballot.
The bureau, which had budgeted
$40,000 for next year's programs, will
likely have to make do with a $6000
association fee that the ASSU Senate
voted them Tuesday. The loss of
funding will surely curtail the
bureau's ability to bring big-name
speakers to campus.
The election commission action
follows Tuesday's decision by the
senate to allow the group on the bal
lot. The senate reversed an earlier
elections commission ruling which
disqualified the group from seeking
fee assessment funding.
According to Elections Commis
sioner Craig Spearman, there is no
way for the Speakers Bureau to ob
tain a spot on the ballot. A write-in
campaign is not feasible because
"there would be no mechanisms for
a person to vote against a write-in fee
assessment," Spearman said.
The decision to strike the bureau
from the ballot was made yesterday
by Spearman and Associate Elections
Commissioner Brian |ans when it was
brought to their attention that the
petitions the Speakers Bureau had
circulated failed to list "the original
detailed budget for the current fiscal
year," as required by the election
rules.
"All the petitions that were handed
in are invalid," said Spearman.
"There's no excuse for it. No one
else did it. Unlike the declaration of
intent rule, this is no technicality,
this is a core requirement."
According to Spearman, every
group seeking a fee assessment was
notified at least four timesof the peti
tion rule.
Ted Wheeler, sponsor of the
Speakers Bureau fee assessment ef
forts, said, "At this point, not much
could amaze me. It's just ridiculous.

I'm annoyed. I volunteered to be on
the Speakers Bureau because I
wanted to bring speakers to Stan
ford. For the past two weeks they
have forced me into the position of
being a politician.
"There really is no chance of get
ting on the ballot now and I think
frankly that we're all just plain tired
of the whole issue," Wheeler said.
Mark Epstein, council of presi
dents member, said, "We force no
one to be a politician, but we do
force everyone to be a bureaucrat.
There's a certain amount of technical
work that has to go into getting large
amounts of funding."
Epstein said the problems which
came up during last year's ASSU elec
tions prompted this year's expanded
election rules. Epstein said last year
"people complained that there was
not enough that was definite and ob
jective."
Graduate Senator Roland Van
Gaalen said, "I have absolutely no
regrets that the Speakers Bureau is
not exempted this time. This time it's
clear that they really screwed up. An
organization that's in charge of a
budget of $40,000 should be more
careful. I think the elections com
missioner was correct. He acted in
the spirit as well as in the letter of the
law."
Senator Roc Blumenthal was re
portedly working on a last-ditch ef
fort to fund the Speakers Bureau
through ASSU legislative action but
could not be reached for comment.
)ans explained that the reason for
delay in the discovery of the petition
rule violation was that the elections
commission did not begin reviewing
the petitions until after the senate
decision to allow the Speakers
Bureau a place on the ballot. "Since
they didn't have a declaration of in
tent, they were just kind of shelved,"
he said.
The commission had previously
ruled that the Speakers Bureau could
not appear on the ballot when it
submitted a "declaration of intent"
form one day late.
