Whatever happened to the guy who drove
his car into the Big Game Rally in San Francis
co last yearf

This was one of the first questions I re
ceived, early last quarter, and I've been trying
(off and on) ever since to find out. I'm happy
to say I've finally given up — neither the San
Francisco Police Department, nor the city
courts, will give out to a random member of
the press details of a person's post-arrest his
tory. Whether or not the man was brought to
trial, and if so, what resulted, I don't know. I
suppose one could find out by contacting his
lawyer, if he had one, or checking with one of
the injured students, but for $12.50 a month I
don't need the headaches.
Columbus thought the world was
spherical; he believed that going west would
bring him to the East, not to the end of the
world. While this was a daring concept, so
was its implementation. It meant that Chris
would have to sail perpendicularly away from
Spain, Queen Isabella and all the little Co
lumbusettes. He may have been one of the
first westerners to purposely sail far away
from sight of land.
The question: If Columbus thought the
world was spherical, why didn't he sail north
or south to get east? (Planes from New York to
Moscow do that now.) By doing this, he
would have been able to sail in sight of land,
and the Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria would
have had a far less risky voyage.
I've asked several Liberal Arts types (history
majors included) but no one knows. Please
help.

I would have thought they'd teach this stuff
in History 1, or, where it really belongs, in Poli
Sci 25 (Colonialism and Nationalism). (Maybe
they do).
Your question is based on two misconcep
tions regarding Columbus, and the great Eu
ropean explorations in general. Don't worry
— nearly everyone educated in America be
lieves the same things, even today. It's one of
the by-products of empire.
First: every educated European of Colum
bus' time (the latter half of the 15th century)
knew that the world was a sphere. Greek
scholars knew this in the sixth century 8.C.,
and in later antiquity various attempts were
made (including one by Aristotle) to come up
with a system of longitude and to determine
the earth's circumference. A spherical earth
was the accepted view through the first cen
tury A.D.; this knowledge was lost during the
Middle Ages, but it emerged again in the ear
ly Renaissance, when treatises by ancients
such as Ptolemy were rediscovered. (The
earth's roundness was once again proved em

pirically, this time by Europeans, before Co
lumbus' birth.) The idea of a spherical earth
was approved of, in the 15th century, by both
the scientific community and the church (for
which the circle and sphere were the most
perfect forms, which is why Renaissance
cathedrals have domes rather than towers).
The need to prove the earth's roundness
would never have entered Columbus' mind,
and the grade-school image of a daring,
ahead-of-his-time Columbus is, in this re
spect, completely false.
Second: the problem with attempts to
reach China and India in Columbus' time is
that they were bound to the shoreline. Portu
guese sailors had been pushing farther and
farther south along the coast of Africa, but by
1492 had only just managed to cross the Gulf
of Guinea. The voyage was too long and too
dangerous for the ships and navigational
techniques they possessed. On the other
hand, no one wanted to try and cross the At
lantic westward, either. The theoretical possi
bility of doing so had been known to the Ro
mans, and was knowntothe 15th-century Eu
ropeans; but common sense told people it
would be too long a journey without fresh
provisions, and there was, as you acknowl
edge, a fear of the open ocean. (It wasn t that
great, though — before Columbus sailed, the
Portuguese had already colonized the
Azores, one-third of the way to America. Co
lumbus was definitely not among the first to
purposely sail far away from the sight of land.
And don't forget, from several centuries
before, the Vikings voyage to Vinland and St.
Brendan's voyage, both of which probably
took place.)
Enter Columbus. He did have an idea to
sell, one which, if true, made a westward voy
age to the Orient conceivable. Fortunately or
unfortunately, depending on your view
point, his calculations were absurdly incor
rect. Columbus managed, through misread
ing of the ancient sources and wilfull mis
calculation, to convince himself and others
that the distance from Portugal to Asia (spe
cifically, Japan) was one-fourth of what it ac
tually was — 2400 rather than 10,000 miles. If
he hadn't hit upon America (the existence of
which no suspected at all — Columbus went
to his grave thinking he'd made it to Asia)
he'd never have been heard from again.
Why didn't he try a Polar Route, you ask.
You have to remember that Columbus was
not flying above the ocean, he was sailing on
it. He knew there was a good westerly current
starting just off the Canary Islands, and that
determined his route. You may ask, why
didn't anyone try to sail north and east
around the European/Asian landmass, espe
ciaffy Since they knew they were in the
northern hemisphere? Well, it's cold up
there. And there's lots of ice.
