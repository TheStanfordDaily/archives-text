# Doctors seek lymph cancer cure
## 
### PHYLLIS BURTON 
Investigational therapy using
monoclonal antibodies grown
in the body of a mouse to treat
lymphomas, a fatal cancer of
the lymph system, is taking
place at Stanford University
Medical Center, under the
direction of Ron Levy, M.D.,
associate professor of
Medicine/Oncology.
Although the treatment is in
vestigational, and has limited
applications at present, it has
shown promising results. Ac
cording to Michelle Meyers,
R.N., the nurse coordinating
the research, one of the first
patients treated with the anti
body has been in remission for
20 months, after having re
ceived no treatment other than
antibodies during a trial period
or in the month preceding it.
He had progressive disease,
where the cancer advances in
spite of treatment, im
mediately before receiving the
anti-idiotype antibody.
Anti-idiotype antibodies are
specifically directed at a par
ticular cell-type, in this case
usually B-cell or T-cell lym
phomas or leukemias. The
process of identifying an anti
idiotype antigen and produc
ing sufficient quantities of
antibody takes about six
months.
In this process, antigens on
the surface of the tumor cell
must be isolated, according to
Meyers, and the specific an
tibodies to these antigens must

be developed. This technique
begins by immunizing a mouse
with the desired antigen. The
mouse spleen cells are then
removed and fused with
mouse myeloma cells to form a
hybridoma.
This fusion is necessary be
cause spleen cells cannot sur
vive in culture. By adding the
myeloma cells, immortality of
the hybrid cell is guaranteed.
The hybrids, with the use of a
special growth medium, are
then selected and cloned for
the desired antibody produc
tion.
At this point the clones may
be frozen for future use, grown
in mass culture, or injected
into a mouse, producing a
monoclonal myeloma that sec
retes antibody. One hundred
mice are needed to produce
enough antibody to treat one
patient.
The investigative team under
Levy includes Tim Meeker,
M.D., Mike Link, M.D., Stan
ford Stewart, M.D. and David
Maloney, M.D. They hope to
eventually reduce the time it
takes to identify and produce
anti-idiotype antibodies and to
find more common types.
Currently the treatment is
limited mostly to patients with
T-cell lymphomas, who have
not been responsive to
chemotherapy, X-ray therapy,
or Interferon, explained
Meyers. The patient must have
had progressive disease for at
least nine months, and must

suffer from enlargement of the
lymph glands so the patient
can provide cells for the pro
cess.
Meyers emphasized that the
treatment is also still experi
mental: only 20 patients have
been treated so far. Of these,
one patient was treated with
anti-idiotypeantibody; the rest
were treated with anti-T-cell
antibody. She said that the re
search team hopes to identify
more common B-cell type anti
gens, and hopes to treat six pa
tients over the next year with
anti-idiotype antibody.
The investigators hope that
with more experience they
may be able to treat patients in
an earlier stage of the disease,
with more success, instead of
waiting until everything else
has failed.
The researchers believe
there may be a "treatment
window," that is, a time when
treatment would be most ef
fective during the disease pro
cess. One possibility they envi
sion would be to grow an
tibodies from the cells of an
untreated patient and have
these available if the patient
later relapses.
So far, according to the re
searchers, there have been
very few complications for pa
tients receivingtheantibody. It
is given intravenously, over
four to six hours, twice a week
for four weeks. The antibody is
less toxic than chemotherapy,

and has caused no major organ
dysfunction, not even to the
kidney, which the investigators
had surmised would happen.
Complications have in
cluded an "anti-mouse re
sponse," which is a reaction to
the mouse imunoglobulin.
Meyers said that administering
the antibody only two times
per week, rather than daily,
minimized this effect.
Another complication, ac
cording to Myers, is "modula
tion," a phenomenon whereby
the antigen disappears from
the cell surface after adminis
tration of the antibody. This
remains unexplained.
Researchers also report that
a few patients have developed
hives when receiving the anti
body. The risk of this is re
duced by giving the patient
Tylenol and Benedryl before
administration of the antibody.
The team receives many calls
from people who have read or
heard about the study. But the
researchers emphasize that the
patients they treat must meet
the investigational criteria, and
must be referred by a physi
cian. The treatment of the indi
vidual patient must also be ap
proved by the Human Subjects
Committeeat the Medical Cen
ter.
Grant money presently
covers some treatmentcosts, al
lowing those who meet the
criteria to be treated regardless
of their financial status.

anti-idiotype antibody.
Anti-idiotype antibodies are
specifically directed at a par
ticular cell-type, in this case
usually B-cell or T-cell lym
phomas or leukemias. The
process of identifying an anti
idiotype antigen and produc
ing sufficient quantities of
antibody takes about six
months.
In this process, antigens on
the surface of the tumor cell
must be isolated, according to
Meyers, and the specific an
tibodies to these antigens must

be developed. This technique
begins by immunizing a mouse
with the desired antigen. The
mouse spleen cells are then
removed and fused with
mouse myeloma cells to form a
hybridoma.
This fusion is necessary be
cause spleen cells cannot sur
vive in culture. By adding the
myeloma cells, immortality of
the hybrid cell is guaranteed.
The hybrids, with the use of a
special growth medium, are
then selected and cloned for
the desired antibody produc
tion.
At this point the clones may
be frozen for future use, grown
in mass culture, or injected
into a mouse, producing a
monoclonal myeloma that sec
retes antibody. One hundred
mice are needed to produce
enough antibody to treat one
patient.
The investigative team under
Levy includes Tim Meeker,
M.D., Mike Link, M.D., Stan
ford Stewart, M.D. and David
Maloney, M.D. They hope to
eventually reduce the time it
takes to identify and produce
anti-idiotype antibodies and to
find more common types.
Currently the treatment is
limited mostly to patients with
T-cell lymphomas, who have
not been responsive to
chemotherapy, X-ray therapy,
or Interferon, explained
Meyers. The patient must have
had progressive disease for at
least nine months, and must

suffer from enlargement of the
lymph glands so the patient
can provide cells for the pro
cess.
Meyers emphasized that the
treatment is also still experi
mental: only 20 patients have
been treated so far. Of these,
one patient was treated with
anti-idiotypeantibody; the rest
were treated with anti-T-cell
antibody. She said that the re
search team hopes to identify
more common B-cell type anti
gens, and hopes to treat six pa
tients over the next year with
anti-idiotype antibody.
The investigators hope that
with more experience they
may be able to treat patients in
an earlier stage of the disease,
with more success, instead of
waiting until everything else
has failed.
The researchers believe
there may be a "treatment
window," that is, a time when
treatment would be most ef
fective during the disease pro
cess. One possibility they envi
sion would be to grow an
tibodies from the cells of an
untreated patient and have
these available if the patient
later relapses.
So far, according to the re
searchers, there have been
very few complications for pa
tients receivingtheantibody. It
is given intravenously, over
four to six hours, twice a week
for four weeks. The antibody is
less toxic than chemotherapy,

and has caused no major organ
dysfunction, not even to the
kidney, which the investigators
had surmised would happen.
Complications have in
cluded an "anti-mouse re
sponse," which is a reaction to
the mouse imunoglobulin.
Meyers said that administering
the antibody only two times
per week, rather than daily,
minimized this effect.
Another complication, ac
cording to Myers, is "modula
tion," a phenomenon whereby
the antigen disappears from
the cell surface after adminis
tration of the antibody. This
remains unexplained.
Researchers also report that
a few patients have developed
hives when receiving the anti
body. The risk of this is re
duced by giving the patient
Tylenol and Benedryl before
administration of the antibody.
The team receives many calls
from people who have read or
heard about the study. But the
researchers emphasize that the
patients they treat must meet
the investigational criteria, and
must be referred by a physi
cian. The treatment of the indi
vidual patient must also be ap
proved by the Human Subjects
Committeeat the Medical Cen
ter.
Grant money presently
covers some treatmentcosts, al
lowing those who meet the
criteria to be treated regardless
of their financial status.
Investigational therapy using
monoclonal antibodies grown
in the body of a mouse to treat
lymphomas, a fatal cancer of
the lymph system, is taking
place at Stanford University
Medical Center, under the
direction of Ron Levy, M.D.,
associate professor of
Medicine/Oncology.
Although the treatment is in
vestigational, and has limited
applications at present, it has
shown promising results. Ac
cording to Michelle Meyers,
R.N., the nurse coordinating
the research, one of the first
patients treated with the anti
body has been in remission for
20 months, after having re
ceived no treatment other than
antibodies during a trial period
or in the month preceding it.
He had progressive disease,
where the cancer advances in
spite of treatment, im
mediately before receiving the
anti-idiotype antibody.
