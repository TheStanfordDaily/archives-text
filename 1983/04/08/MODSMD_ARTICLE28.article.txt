# Pioneer 10 to leave solar system this year after 11-year trip
## 
### 
From the NASA News Service
On June 13 of this year, the
U.S. unmanned spacecraft,
Pioneer 10, will cross the orbit
of Neptune. With that cros
sing, Pioneer will be farther out
from the Sun than any known
planet, and will, in effect, have
left the solar system. Though
Pluto is normally the outer
most planet, its orbit is so ellip
tical (elongated) that for the
next 17 years it will be inside
Neptune's orbit, and Pluto will
never again catch up with

Pioneer.
Experts at NASA's Deep
Space Network expect to be
able to track Pioneer out to
somewhere beyond five billion
miles. Pioneer has already
traveled more than 3 billion
miles.
Since launch in 1972, Pioneer
10, the first spacecraft to Jupi
ter, has traversed the asteroid
belt, survived lupiter's punish
ing radiation belts, and oper
ated almost without flaw. By
June 13, 1983, Pioneer 10 will

have traveled 3.59 billion miles
on its flight path, will have re
ceived over 98,900 commands
from Earth, and transmitted
more than 126 billion bits of
scientific data. At Neptune
orbit-crossing, rate of travel for
Pioneer will be 30,558 mph.
The Pioneer 10 project is
managed by NASA's Ames Re
search Center in Mountain
View and was built by TRVV's
Space & Technology Croup at
Redondo Beach. The spacec
raft had an original design life

of 21 months and has per
formed almost perfectly for
more than 11 years.
The spacecraft is currently
engaged in a new enterprise,
defining the extent and be
havior of the Sun's atmos
phere, the magnetic bubble
which contains theSunandthe
planets. This "bubble" in the
interstellar medium is called
the heliosphere.
Despite damage from in
tense Jovian radiation, and hits
by tiny micrometeoroids, plus

11 years of continuous opera
tion, almost all systems are per
forming well. Pioneer's mag
netometer ceased to function
in 1975, but experimenters can
calculate the interplanetary
field from magnetic data al
ready gathered and several
correlations from other in
struments.
Scientists await current
spacecraft findings "with in
tense excitement," says Dr.
James Van Allen, University of
lowa, Pioneer 10 experi

menter, "because we think the
Sun is typical of a majority of
the stars in the universe. It's
the only star we can measure
from 'close up.' Finding the ex
tent and exact mechanisms of
the Sun's atmosphere will tell
us a great deal about the Sun
itself, about the interstellar gas
surrounding the solar system
and hence about stars in gen
eral."
Pioneer 10 has already con
tributed to outer space re
search the first trip to Jupiter,

the first crossing of the As
teroid Belt, the discovery that
Jupiter is a liquid planet, the
first model of Jupiter's huge,
pulsating, magnetosphere and
tremendously powerful radia
tion belts, the first accurate
measurements of mass and
densities of Jupiter's planet
sized moons, key to the
planet's formation history, and
the first closeup pictures of
Jupiter's Great Red Spot and
belts and zones showing de
tails of atmosphere circulation.
