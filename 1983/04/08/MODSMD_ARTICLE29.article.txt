## 'Scuse': getting overwhelmed by Hendrix experience 
### SCOTT AREY 
"One early morning, alone in his apart
ment in the Village, he answers the doorbell.
Strange men are at the door. He is taken
forcibly from his apartment and stuffed in
the back of a car by four dudes. They act
tough yet they still handle him more gently
than expected. He is blindfolded. Oneofthe
guys kneels on him, his knee in his back. He
is shunted and reeled through black vectors
to a dry-brick-smelling bare cement floor.
"In very tough voices the guys tell him
how they are going to hurt him. He waits but
they don't hurt him. He just sits and sits.
Then after a while there is a commotion.

Shouts and curses. Doors slamming and feet
running. He hears people running towards
him. His blindfold is ripped off. It is Mike
leffery and the guys from the office. His
bonds are untied. He is relieved. He is grate
ful.
"They hustle him out of the building, talk
ing some shit. He is dazed, wonder
ing. . . .What kind of shit is this? How did
they know where I was? What happened?
They jabber a story to him, but he is too busy
wondering in his mind. . . .Was it a setup or
was it for real?"
While this scene seems to lack believabil
ity, for Jimi Hendrix it is almost routine in a
life that in the space of three and a half years
went from starvation poverty to superstar
dom to confused and tragic death. In his
recently reprinted paperback 'Scuse Me
While I Kiss the Sky, David Henderson gives
a strikingly detailed account of Hendrix's life
and explosion onto the rock n' roll scene of
the late '60s.
While Hendrix's life is inherently exciting
and interesting, it is somewhat overstated by
Henderson, whose use of cliches as a substi
tute for actual writing seriously detracts
from the Hendrix story. For this reason a
person reading this book with no interest in
Hendrix or the music industry will find
themselves as bored by this book as they
would be by reading the same National En
quirer from cover to cover-including ads
-500,000 times. That is not to say that this
book is totally without value, or is bird cage
material, but rather that most upper middle
class Stanford students would rather eat six
day old Stern food than read the first 100
pages of this 400 page biography. Stated
simply, if you are not a Hendrix fan or a
musician of any kind, you need read no
further, for nothing I can say will cause you
to read any more of this book than you have
already foolishly read.
If, however, you are a member of the two
categories previously mentioned, you could
be interested in this book. In the first few
pages of the book Henderson describes
limi's death, which was so characteristic of
his life and eminently reflected in his music,
limi died accidently, in a desire to escape the

world that would not leave him alone. On
September 18, 1970 he was pronounced
dead. He had choked on his own vomit the
previous evening.
It was four years earlier that he had first set
foot in England with his manager Chas
Chandler, formerly one of the Animals, in
search of what was to be "The Experience,"
his new band. Of all the accidents that made
up his life, this one had to be the strangest.
Hp was only able to make it as a black blues

musician by going to England to play rock
blues with two then Beatle-ish looking musi
cians, Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchel.
(They soon grew Afros).
Jimi used his music as the escape from
everything; To get out of the army, out of
Seattle, out of Harlem, out of the Village,
and out of poverty to the top of the English
pop-rock scene inside of four months. Es
cape is what drove the magic stratocaster,

which he played left-handed, upside down
and strung backwards. This is the story that
every pop-rock-jazz musician wants to hear.
The story of the impossible person, beating
the impossible odds, and making it to the
top.
This is the story in the first half of the
book. Hendrix setting records, making re
cords, playing the guitar with his teeth, set
ting it on fire, and driving crowds wild. The
sprond nart of the story with his in-

creasing paranoia, in part as a result of the
kinds of incidents similar to that desribed at
the beginning of this article, and the increas
ing failure of his music as a viable escape
from the world around him.
Many of Hendrix's songs simply could not
be recorded because of the lack of sophisti
cation in early recording equipment. He was
constrained by this, and by the recording
companies who did not want him experi

meriting with new kinds of music that might
not be as profitable as what he was currently
doing. Before his fame, people were awed
by his incredible playing ability, his daring
and musicianship, but afterwards they came
to expect all this and sometimes even more.
This drove Hendrix to turn to drugs and al
cohol in increasing amounts as an escape.
This is the story that every musician outside
of the "classical" field fears, but expects, to
hear. It often seems to the reader that Hen
drix deals with his situation better than
many, despite fact that it ultimately de
feats him.
The book also serves as a guide for the
untrained ear, to the music of Jimi Hendrix.
Henderson does a reasonable job of describ
ing the conditions under which particular
songs were recorded, and what to listen for
when playing Hendrix. Hendrix's music is
somewhat rough by today's standards of
audio excellence, but can be immensely en
joyed if one learns to ignore the non
relevant sound distortion and hiss. If you are
a musician and have either heard Hendrix
and not liked it, or never seriously listened
to Hendrix, you are missing out on some
great music and should purchase this book
as well as several Hendrix records im
mediately.
As a guitarist Hendrix is unquestionably
the greatest of all time. He played the best,
baddest, and most innovative solos, while
simultaneously playing rythm licks on the
same guitar. His music is his own, neither
jazz, nor pop, nor rock, but a strange fusion
crossing all barriers. Those with open minds
and souls will learn to love Hendrix through
the music he left behind, and will mourn his
death with every note heard.
Rolling Stone has called this biography of
Hendrix the "strongest and most ambitious
biography yet written about any rock and
roll performer." Hopefully this is not the
case, but for the potentially interested party
this book does offer some insights to the
music industry, the life and times of |imi
Hendrix, and occasionally overcomes its
own romanticism and cumbersome detail.

constrained by this, and by the recording
companies who did not want him experi

meriting with new kinds of music that might
not be as profitable as what he was currently
doing. Before his fame, people were awed
by his incredible playing ability, his daring
and musicianship, but afterwards they came
to expect all this and sometimes even more.
This drove Hendrix to turn to drugs and al
cohol in increasing amounts as an escape.
This is the story that every musician outside
of the "classical" field fears, but expects, to
hear. It often seems to the reader that Hen
drix deals with his situation better than
many, despite fact that it ultimately de
feats him.
The book also serves as a guide for the
untrained ear, to the music of Jimi Hendrix.
Henderson does a reasonable job of describ
ing the conditions under which particular
songs were recorded, and what to listen for
when playing Hendrix. Hendrix's music is
somewhat rough by today's standards of
audio excellence, but can be immensely en
joyed if one learns to ignore the non
relevant sound distortion and hiss. If you are
a musician and have either heard Hendrix
and not liked it, or never seriously listened
to Hendrix, you are missing out on some
great music and should purchase this book
as well as several Hendrix records im
mediately.
As a guitarist Hendrix is unquestionably
the greatest of all time. He played the best,
baddest, and most innovative solos, while
simultaneously playing rythm licks on the
same guitar. His music is his own, neither
jazz, nor pop, nor rock, but a strange fusion
crossing all barriers. Those with open minds
and souls will learn to love Hendrix through
the music he left behind, and will mourn his
death with every note heard.
Rolling Stone has called this biography of
Hendrix the "strongest and most ambitious
biography yet written about any rock and
roll performer." Hopefully this is not the
case, but for the potentially interested party
this book does offer some insights to the
music industry, the life and times of |imi
Hendrix, and occasionally overcomes its
own romanticism and cumbersome detail.


'Scuse Me While I Kiss the Sky
The Life of Jimi Hendrix
Bantam Books


For Music Lovers Only
"One early morning, alone in his apart
ment in the Village, he answers the doorbell.
Strange men are at the door. He is taken
forcibly from his apartment and stuffed in
the back of a car by four dudes. They act
tough yet they still handle him more gently
than expected. He is blindfolded. Oneofthe
guys kneels on him, his knee in his back. He
is shunted and reeled through black vectors
to a dry-brick-smelling bare cement floor.
"In very tough voices the guys tell him
how they are going to hurt him. He waits but
they don't hurt him. He just sits and sits.
Then after a while there is a commotion.

Shouts and curses. Doors slamming and feet
running. He hears people running towards
him. His blindfold is ripped off. It is Mike
leffery and the guys from the office. His
bonds are untied. He is relieved. He is grate
ful.
"They hustle him out of the building, talk
ing some shit. He is dazed, wonder
ing. . . .What kind of shit is this? How did
they know where I was? What happened?
They jabber a story to him, but he is too busy
wondering in his mind. . . .Was it a setup or
was it for real?"
While this scene seems to lack believabil
ity, for Jimi Hendrix it is almost routine in a
life that in the space of three and a half years
went from starvation poverty to superstar
dom to confused and tragic death. In his
recently reprinted paperback 'Scuse Me
While I Kiss the Sky, David Henderson gives
a strikingly detailed account of Hendrix's life
and explosion onto the rock n' roll scene of
the late '60s.
While Hendrix's life is inherently exciting
and interesting, it is somewhat overstated by
Henderson, whose use of cliches as a substi
tute for actual writing seriously detracts
from the Hendrix story. For this reason a
person reading this book with no interest in
Hendrix or the music industry will find
themselves as bored by this book as they
would be by reading the same National En
quirer from cover to cover-including ads
-500,000 times. That is not to say that this
book is totally without value, or is bird cage
material, but rather that most upper middle
class Stanford students would rather eat six
day old Stern food than read the first 100
pages of this 400 page biography. Stated
simply, if you are not a Hendrix fan or a
musician of any kind, you need read no
further, for nothing I can say will cause you
to read any more of this book than you have
already foolishly read.
If, however, you are a member of the two
categories previously mentioned, you could
be interested in this book. In the first few
pages of the book Henderson describes
limi's death, which was so characteristic of
his life and eminently reflected in his music,
limi died accidently, in a desire to escape the

world that would not leave him alone. On
September 18, 1970 he was pronounced
dead. He had choked on his own vomit the
previous evening.
It was four years earlier that he had first set
foot in England with his manager Chas
Chandler, formerly one of the Animals, in
search of what was to be "The Experience,"
his new band. Of all the accidents that made
up his life, this one had to be the strangest.
Hp was only able to make it as a black blues

musician by going to England to play rock
blues with two then Beatle-ish looking musi
cians, Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchel.
(They soon grew Afros).
Jimi used his music as the escape from
everything; To get out of the army, out of
Seattle, out of Harlem, out of the Village,
and out of poverty to the top of the English
pop-rock scene inside of four months. Es
cape is what drove the magic stratocaster,

which he played left-handed, upside down
and strung backwards. This is the story that
every pop-rock-jazz musician wants to hear.
The story of the impossible person, beating
the impossible odds, and making it to the
top.
This is the story in the first half of the
book. Hendrix setting records, making re
cords, playing the guitar with his teeth, set
ting it on fire, and driving crowds wild. The
sprond nart of the story with his in-

creasing paranoia, in part as a result of the
kinds of incidents similar to that desribed at
the beginning of this article, and the increas
ing failure of his music as a viable escape
from the world around him.
Many of Hendrix's songs simply could not
be recorded because of the lack of sophisti
cation in early recording equipment. He was
constrained by this, and by the recording
companies who did not want him experi

meriting with new kinds of music that might
not be as profitable as what he was currently
