# Compelling, paranoid reading in 'Lying Low'
## 
### LAURENCE ADLER 
Fear and paranoia are justified in Diane Johnson's new
novel, Lying Low. A story of ordinary people living under
cover, it is powerful, frightening and intelligent. Despite
its gloomy subject matter, the story's humor flows natu
rally from the events; Johnson even manages to evoke
sentiment and hope amid the ever-looming horror.
Johnson shows us characters with valid reasons to live
in fear. For example, Marybeth, a withdrawn young
woman posing as a student, is actually a fugitive on the
F.8.1.'s most-wanted list. Similarly, Ouida, an illegal
alien, fears the immigration officials will deport her back
to her native Brazil. We follow the characters through
four agitating days in which Johnson proves that their
world is indeed a dangerous one, a place where disaster
is inevitable and lurks in surprising places.
Surprises, moreover, also lie in Johnson's control of
character. Our affection for, say, Marybeth dips and
soars remarkably as the checkered events of her past are
gradually revealed. We see all sides of Marybeth: she is
sensitive to Ouida's language and social problems, but
she is inconsiderate in caring for a small child. What's
more, Marybeth's desire to flee from recognition and
the law is tempered by her sexual desire for the man
she'd leave behind. Her lusty daydreams demonstrate
the frustration and misery of her life, yet her thoughts
are humorous in their exaggeration and genital focus.
Similarly, Ouida, despite her wide-eyed innocence,
has a depth of character Johnson gradually reveals;
Ouida, in fact, is perhaps the most vividly drawn of all

the story's characters. As she prepares a special Brazilian
feast to raise money, she bursts with industry and anxi
ety. Her premonitions and mysterious religious faith —

she claims to radiate healing power — contribute a
frightening edge to her character, and increase the
foreboding atmosphere.
Each figure in the novel is gradually, but brilliantly
defined, includingTheo, the prima donna landlady, who
likes to make a show of her philanthropy; and Chuck
Sweet, whose generosity emerges through his interest
in Marybeth. Johnson doesn't want the reader to get too
close to her characters, however. In Ouida's case, we
can admire or pity her at times, for instance, when she
unsuccessfully tries to entertain some school children
with a presentation of Brazilian culture. But the reader's
/nvo/vemenf with Ou/c/«i is distanced t>y Ai<*r repe//t*nf
mysticism, her secretiveness. Marybeth's crime and
Theo's haughtiness also repel us. This distance, how
ever, is perfectly suited to this mysterious story: the
reader's anxiety over the characters underscores the
story's theme of anxiety.
Tension is also built through the brevity of the chap
ters, which drives the reader briskly on. The writing is
perceptive and dramatic, never cluttered or overbear
ing. Johnson turns simple details into telling moments:
"Marybeth loved the elevator. She wanted to rise and
rise and rise and just escape out the top into air. She
relished the appalled swoop of her own stomach, proof
she wasn't dead." Pictures like this make Lying Low
compelling and full-bodied reading.
