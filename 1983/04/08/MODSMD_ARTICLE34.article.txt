What Has Cone Before
It rtou dbe va*e :o !*ut the >erie> — the
pair of tr 0" jcllj that this book
ends v\ fkfn'.j >be the biggest selling
line i fanus* s' ence ration bigger than
the HobtMt or Foundation series. The
last book perched itselt on the N.Y. Times
bestse. er s: tor a long time, and this book
actualU has preprinted order cards in some
stores.
But how good are these books? •
\ er\ good. The first trilogy created a world
unique in fiction writing, bearing next to no
resemblance to the others mentioned above
or an\ of the other 'whole cloth' creations in

the field, which is quite a feat considering
the sheer number of fictional worlds that
have so far been created and explored.
Furthermore, he peopled it with races and
types that are not just traditional stock char
acters. If another book comes out stocked
with elves and trolls I will be on the front
lines of the mob storming the author's
home. Donaldson uses Stonedownors,
VVoodhelvenans and Haruchai as the human
elements, Waynhim, Ur-Viles and
Cavewights are among the 'monsters.'
This isn't just using new names for races, as
Donaldson has created cultural identities for
all his human types, and has even given so
cial organization to his 'monsters.' He does
use giants, but they are a people, distinct and
idiosyncratic, not merely tall humans — or
trolls.
However, the whole question of
Donaldson's vision— as praiseworthy as it
may be— relates more to the past books,
brings up another point of fact. Do
not buy this book if you have not read the
two previous books in this trilogy, and think
very hard about the wisdom — read that 'fol
ly'— of reading this trilogy before the first
one. If you read this book alone you will get
nothing out of the experience.
Forget the fact that there's a neat little
summation in front of tho hook. That's
there because the public was watting with
baited breath for the next book and it was
felt they needed a refresher on the book
they had read as soon as it came out some
months ago. It'll tell you of the encounter
with the Elohim— but you won't give a damn
about it.
There's the reason for reading the books
in order. The first book in the first series
stood on its own, the others less and less so.
However, the second trilogy is more strictly
one book, as it traces one story interrupted
only by the time gap involved in printing the
books. The story builds upon itself, and a tale
that rests so greatly on the psychological de
velopement of the two lead characters loses

a lot for a reader who hasn't witnessed that
growth.
Mso, as was said about one of the charac
ters, how can you appreciate the struggle to
restore the land, how can you grieve for its
lost beauty, if you have neverseen it healthy?
A reader who jumps in at the second trilogy
w ill not appreciate Thomas Covenant's char
acter or the poignancy of his memories
without knowing of his struggles in the pre
vious trilogy. Frankly, such a reader is cheat
ing himself.
There is Also Love in the World
Assuming from this point that the readers
of this piece are familiar with the books the
topic switches to the major sub-plot of the
book, namely the Thomas Covenant-Linden
Avery romance. It is obvious from the start of
the second series that something of the sort
was going to happen. For whatever reasons
they mav have had for including her in the
series, neither Lord Foul, the Creator, nor
Donaldson could have expected anyone not
to see a relationship bearing down upon the
two of them.
When it finally happened in The One Tree
I breathed a sigh of relief that they had finally
gotten it out of the way. If the book had
ended with a climax consisting of Covenant
finally saving himself by finding the strength
to declare his love for her, and the force of
that love blasting Lord Foul to oblivion (pre
sumably shouting "Curses! Foiled again!")
once again would a posse have assembled,
aimed at yet another author's house.
It is good that that kind of predictable
scene was avoided. Donaldson must be
praised for his restraint in writing this sequel
for a number of reasons. The situation of the
first three books was so rich that it could be
mined for a very long time, but, by the na
ture of Covenant's character, it would in
evitably become a parody of itself. A very
profitable mockery, but a terrible thing
nonetheless.
The Power That Preserves
The change of the world in the second
trilogy was vital to the respectability of
Donaldson's vision— it would have been too
easy to leave things as they were and write a
very satisfying book. Likewise, half the prob
lem most readers had with The One Tree was
that it introduced places outside of the land,
somehow cheapening it. Still, it was neces
sary for there to be a reason to get out of the
land, otherwise Covenant would look
foolish for wandering around screwing up
his courage to 'do what has to be done.'
The one thing that the previous book in
troduced that pleased the readers White
Cold Wielder puts aside: Covenant's power.
As are so many things in the trilogy, things
that were signifigant but hard to understand
previously are fully explained in the last
book. When Covenant fought the Worm of
the World's end at the One Tree it was re
vealed that his power sang too strongly in
him for him to control, it fought too strongly
for release that it was doubtful that he could
rein it in before breaking the arch of time.
It's sad to t-nr-MKo it vvas exhilarating
iu jcv .ov, .u. , getting to use this
power that had so cursed him, but as a plot
device it was played out. Having previously
established it as enough to defeat Lord Foul
and further strengthened it by the venom in
his system, there would be no way to make
the forces of evil competitive in this book if
he had control of this power.
, Still, Covenant is not gratuitously stripped
of his power. Another subplot, tied to the ro
i mance but independent of it, neatly adds
I strength to his restraint, aside from his fear of
! breaking the arch of time.
» Those Who Part
At the end of the last book Covenant sent
5 Dr. Avery back to the other world to try to

save hisearthly life from a stab wound. Avery
comes back and tells him that she can't, not
without his spirit there. Covenant, aware of
the physical continuity between the two
worlds, knows then he is doomed without
some miracle.
His power then, tied as it is to his spirit
remember that Mhoram said "You are the
White Gold"? — becomes blackened with
his despair. No longer is it the pure silver
white force but instead 'black fire, black
poison, black ruin.' Covenant has no more
power then: he is afraid to use it, and he is
afraid of what it represents to his life.
There's a weird balance in this book: Cov
enant swings from impotence to power and
back, Linden swings back and forth in her es
timation by her companions, and both char
acters swing back and forth in their depic
tion by the author. Donaldson seems to tell
usto likeonecharacter at one time anoth
er at another. Covenant starts the book
treated like, well, a leper, while Linden is a
paragon of virtue. The positions change as
Covenant starts to pursue his death, becom
ing almost angelic in the middle of the book
while Linden seems hysterical and grasping.
At the end of the book Linden swings over to
virtuousagain, completing the cycle.
This little game of 'musical respectability'
cheapens the characters, as it is too much too
quick. I suppose Donaldson does it to make a
'real' character in the reader's eyes, to estab
lish a case for her value. The resentment
most readers felt over her inclusion in the
book must surely have reached his ears.
At heart, the first trilogy dealt with a male
figure who had been abused and degraded
yet finds the strength of will to triumph over
the force of evil. When you add a female fig

ure in an equal role it is surely going to upset
that audience. What has she done? Why is
she so special?
One of the major problems of the second
trilogy is that Covenant's love for Linden
seems unjustified, a bit more so than her love
for him. We are told that he loves her be
cause she's not afraid of his leprosy, doesn't
blame him for it. That may be quite powerful
to him, being as he has lived with 'leper out
cast unclean' ringing in his ears for many
years now, but it doesn't communicate well
to the reader. It seems that her bravery is
more due to her physician's detachment
than affection for him. To those jealous eyes,
it would be worse than just Donaldson giving
a bad grounding of his love for her, he would
be being misled by her, strung along.
At any rate, they fall strongly out of love in
White Gold Wielder, due to the guilt that
Covenant feels over letting her think there
would be a future to their relationship while
knowing that he's dying from a knife wound.
That's a rather odd view of relationships, and
Covenant takes this 'lie' he has told her rath
er strongly, to a degree impossible to believe
in anybody who has displayed a less passion
ate nature than he has.
Again, it's inevitable that he should finally
mend their relationship, but a good thing
that their reunion does not mystically defeat
Lord Foul. Donaldson tends to write very
morally, perhaps he has to to tell the story of
a character as ethical as Covenant, and it
seemed depressingly likely that he would
opt to end the trilogy with that kind of love
affirming conclusion.
Enactors of Desecration
There's tension throughout the book,
making it read almost like a detective story:
How will it end? I've let slip that Covenant

and Avery don't defeat Lord Foul by love,
and you're welcome to that bit of knowl
edge. After the first trilogy, however, the
readers have too much faith in Covenant, so
Donaldson throws all types of obstructions
in his way, and in Avery's way, too.
It would be little fun to be sure of the out
come, but it's taken too far. The tension is
not just present in the book, it practically
predominates. Will Covenant finally get his
gear together? Will Avery have to do it all?
Will she take the ring from him? Will —dare I
even say it — Lord Foul finally win?
That mystery is cleared up in the end. As
are some other mysteries. I can't say that I
was pleased by the resolution of all of them,
especially the fate of the Haruchai and Fin
dail, the Elohim. However, that's personal
taste. The only thread that was left hanging
was the resolution of the cosmic mystery.
One of the biggest charms of the new
trilogy was the revised mythology of the
people. They had been told they were in
hell, punished with A-Jeroth, who had
seduced the Creator's wife. There is also a
new view of the heavens, and the story of the
worm of world's end. However, one thing is
left hanging that could have been interesting
(which is a decidedly unfair thing to say) is
the connection between the 'Weird' of the
Waynhim, the 'Wurd' of the Elohim and the
'Word' of some other strays. This was hinted
to and accented in several places, but no real
peak was reached.
The Power that Criticizes
So much for sniping and justification.
What is the sum total of this book, or, more
properly, the second series? The second
chronicles are not as good as the first. There
was a freshness to the first that wasn't
equalled in the second. The first had more
memorable characters. Everyone in the sec
ond has their echo in the first three books,
and with the inevitable exception of Linden
Avery, all the dopplegangers from the first
were better drawn.
Comparison is inevitable, and Donaldson
encourages it with Covenant's flashes of
rueful memory. Still, Cail is Bannor with
slightly less personality and definitely less
mystique. The Giants all shadow Foam
follower, and Sunder is an amalgam of all the
common characters Covenant befriended or
wronged in the first book.
Without changing the place of Covenant's
call (I would be little interested in "Thomas
Covenant of Space," drifting from world to
world, and that would still retain a lot of the
problems) or mystically re-incarnating the
characters of the first book (too execrable to
even be considered) this is inescapable. How
much different can a continuation be?
The book does introduce some interesting
new things and places, and one or two that
could be easily done without (see arghuleh,
ferocious ice-beasts). It was good to read
more about the land and Covenant's will and
weaknesses. For those reasons I waited with
breath as baited as any for the last book, and
I would guess that 90 per cent of the people
who buy it in paperback will have already
read it in hardcover.
Our Friend the Woodchuck
Beyond one last swipe at Donaldson's writ
ing style (if I never read of a gaunt, febrile in
dividual with a roynish grin but leashed
power in his potent eyes again, that'll mean
there is no third trilogy) there's not much left
to say. I enjoyed all the books, more with
each re-reading. Maybe that's why I was so
angry when I finished White Cold Wielder
Doyle brought back Sherlock Holmes be
cause of fan demand, but I doubt Donaldson
will do the same, even in the face of a posse
surrounding his house. "And so the glory of
the world becomes less than it was."
