## David slays Goliath: Spikers stop No.1 Hawaii 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford's men's volleyball
team played David Wednesday
night at Maples Pavilion and, as
the story goes, slew the giant
Goliath. And in this case, the
giant was No. 1-ranked Hawaii.
But the Cardinal not only
upset the nation's top-rated
team, it trounced it, giving
Stanford head coach Fred
Sterm reason to call the victory
the single biggest in Cardinal
men's volleyball history.
Stanford won the first two
games by identical 15-12
scores, caught its breath while
Hawaii won the third 15-10, and
then devastated the Rainbow
15-3 to clinch the contest.
The victory lifted the struggl
ing Cardinal's CIVA (California
Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation) record to 3-11 and
improved its overall mark to
10-14.
Hawaii, meanwhile, fell to
10-4 overall and 8-3 in the con
ference, a half-game behind
CIVA leader UCLA.

"The key to the match was
that all six players on the floor
played very well," Sturm said.
"We were very cohesive.
"Overall, we did an out
standing job controlling the
ball and dictating the action."
Sturm said the turning point
in the match came in the sec
ond name when Stanford came
back from a 12-6 deficit and
scored nine unanswered
points to win the game and put
it ahead 2-0.
Although Hawaii bounded
back to win the third game
15-10, the Card did not fold in
the fourth.
"I think we took advantage
of the opportunities Hawaii
gave us (in the fourth game),
more so than in any of the
other three games," Sturm ex
plained. "They kept lots of
balls in play, but we just domi
nated them."
The statistics told a similar
story. In the fourth game, the
Card spikers compiled a

phenomenal .404 hitting per
centage to Hawaii's .209.
On the night, Stanford hit a
.357 clip, while Hawaii was at
.221. In volleyball, a .250 per
centage in considered high.
"We needed a win like this to
get us going," Sturm said. "If
we can improve from the way
we played against Hawaii, we'll
do just fine (the rest of the sea
son)."
Before Wednesday night's
upset, Stanford's two previous
victories were over CIVA
doormat Loyola-Marymount.
Nonetheless, Sturm insisted
his players were not intimi
dated by the top-ranked
Hawaii squad. "We have a tre
mendous amount of respect
for a lot of teams, but we fear
no one," he said.
Individually, freshman )on
Root led the attack with 18 kills
and a .394 hitting percentage.
Senior team captain Mark Re
agan had a .368 percentage, in
cluding 16 kills against only two
errors.

Sophomore Dan Parr had 18
kills, while another sopho
more Craig Lauchner had 17.
Freshman Brett Monello had 15
kills, 2 errors and a .333 per
centage.
But perhaps the hero for
Stanford was senior Bob Dean,
who has seen limited action
before Wednesday's match
with Hawaii. Dean ended with
9 kills in 16 total attempts, a
.563 hitting percentage.
"I think Bob Dean came off
the bench and did a fantastic
job," Sturm said of the veteran
spiker. "He know our system
so well that he know what kind
of things need to be done. It's
like having another coach on
the floor."
Stanford takes on UC-Santa
Barbara Wednesday at Maples
Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. The
Gauchos are presently ranked
fifth nationally, although they
recently held the top spot be
fore the Rainbow beat them
twice in Hawaii.
