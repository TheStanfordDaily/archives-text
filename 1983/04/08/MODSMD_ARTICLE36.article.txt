## Card resumes 6-Pac play with series against Cal 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Stanford and California are
anchored at opposite ends of
the 6-Pac standings heading
into today's series opener be
tween the two clubs at Ber
keley's Evans Diamond at 2:30
p.m.
Stanford, 25-6 overall and 8-1
conference, comfortably leads
the 6-Pac with a three-game
lead over second place USC.
California, 17-19 overall and 3-7
conference, is five and one
half games back, but Stanford
coach Mark Marquess said
there is more to the Berkeley
story than has been shown so
far.
"Cal is a very good team,"
Marquess said. "They haven't
played as well as they can.
They're kind of a sleeping
giant. I think the weather kind
of set them back this spring."
Berkeley has shown life re
cently, winning five of their last
seven games and eight of their
last 12.
The Bears are led by leftfiel
der Lance Blankenship (.357,13
RBl's, and 28 stolen bases) and
rightfielder Dave Hangel (.318,
seven home runs, and 29
RRI'O.

The key to Berkeley's of
however, is speed and the will
ingness to run.
"They have good pitching
and they have good team
speed," Marquess said. "They
always try and run to create
things. They'll run this
weekend."
California is expected to start
Bryan Price (3-4, 3.09 ERA),
Nick Esposito (2-4, 3.33 FRA)
this weekend.
Marquess said he will start
Brian Myers in this afternoon's
game. Myers is 5-1 with a 2.81
ERA. Steve Cottrell (6-1, 3.86
ERA) will start in Saturday's
home game at I p.m. and David
Harris (2-2) will start Sunday's
final game back at Berkeley,
also at 1 p.m.
Santa Clara stopped a 12-
game Stanford winning streak
Monday, but the Cardinal re
bounded to blast Sonoma State
14-3 Tuesday.
Freshman centerfielder
Mark Davis, who spent much
of the last couple of weeks
breaking out of a slump, went
10-for-20 on the week, increas
ing his batting average to .355.
Davis was named Pac-10 Player
of the Week for his effort.
Designated hitter Eric

Hardgrave leads Stanford in
batting average at .3%, and
leads the nation in both home
runs with 12 and RBl's with 52.
Marquess expects
Flardgrave to be ready for this
weekend's series after sitting
out Tuesday's game with a mild
back spasm. Mike De√üenon,
who is hitting .358, will replace
FHardgrave if he cannot play.
Mike Aldrete, .373, and
Vince Sakowski, .360, continue
to hit well for the Cardinal as
well as anchoring the corners
of a solid defensive infield that
includes a pair of sophomores -
Pete Stanicek at second base
and |ohn Verducci at
shortstop.
The Bears, who finished in
fifth place in the 6-Pac last year
with a 9-18 conference record,
lead the overall series with the
Cardinal 175 to 134. Stanford,
however, beat Cal in five of
their six meetings last season.
Stanford has another three
game stint with the Bears later
this season, March 13-15 - the
final weekend of conference
play. In the second three-game
series, two games will be at
Sunken Diamond and only one
at Cal's Evans Diamond.
