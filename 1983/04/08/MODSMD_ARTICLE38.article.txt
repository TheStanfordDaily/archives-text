### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford's women's tennis
team walked over another
patsy Wednesday, blanking
the University of Pacific Tigers
9-oat Stanford Tennis Stadium.
The win gave Stanford a 15-2
overall record heading into this
afternoon's match with UC
livine, scheduled to start here
at 1 p.m.
The Cardinal won eight of
the nine singles and doubles
matches in straight sets. Only
senior Suzy Barbe, at No. 6
singles, needed three sets to
win, rebounding from a slow
start to record a 1-6, 6-1, 6-2
over UOP's Kathy Caplener.
lunior Elise Burgin, the No. 1
amateur in the world, was not
in the line-up against the Tigers
and was replaced by sopho
more Linda Gates at the top
singles spot.
Gates filled Burgin's shoes
masterfully, easily disposing of
Trina Lee at No. 1, 6-1, 6-1.
The No. 2 through No. 5 sing
les matches were just as lop
sided. Freshman Alyce Werdel
downed UOP's Eve Zimmer
man 6-2, 6-4 at No. 2, senior
Caryn Copeland beat Annette
Ward 6-2, 6-2 at No. 3, junior
Michelle Weiss blasted Linda
Treloar 6-1, 6-1 at No. 4 and Ali
son Hardey defeated Paige
Hodge f»-4. 6-1 at No. 5

Stanford swept the doubles
with Copeland/Weiss at No. 1,
Hardy/Jackie Joseph at No. 2
and Barbe/Baughman at No. 3.
Wednesday's UOP match
was originally scheduled for
Feb. 15, but was rained out.
Irvine is considerably better
than UOP, but still is not of the
calibre of a USC or UCLA.
"They (Irvine) are fairly good.
They're better than UOP,"
Brennan said. "They're just a
step behind Cal."
"We're pointing towards the
match April 17 against UCLA,"
Brennan said. "If we win on the
17th, no matter what happens,
we'll be seeded No. 2 (at the
NCAA Championships in May).
"If we can beat UCLA, that
gives us a little cushion to work
with." Stanford's two losses
this season have both been at
the hands of No. 1 ranked USC
and both by 5-4 scores.
The Cardinal beat UCLA
early last month at the National
Indoor Championships in Ann
Arbor, Mi., and a victory April
17 would assure Stanford the
advantage in the teams' Ihree
game series this season.
The Card will travel to Los
Angeles to face the Bruins May
7 in its final match before the
NCAA Championships in Al
buquerque, N.M.
