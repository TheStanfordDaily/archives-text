# Arms research opposition grows
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
A number of small student groups here are slowly
mobilizing in opposition to a proposal at the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) which would
aid research in nuclear weapons.
In a related development, Bernd Crasemann, a
member of SSRL's proposal review panel, said he ex
pects the panel to make a recommendation whether or
not to accept the proposed research project within a
week after its April 20 meeting.
SSRL Director Arthur Bienenstock said he would make
the ultimate decision on the proposal soon after he

receives the panel's recommendation.
The campus groups' actions are the first signs of con
solidated student opposition to the proposal, which has
stirred tangible concern among faculty and staff mem
bers at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
and elsewhere in the University.
• lon Adelstein, a junior majoring in political science,
is circulating a petition that he hopes will be signed by
iOOO people on campus asking the ASSU Senate to adopt
a resolution opposing the proposed research project
and any other research dedicated to nuclear weapons.
• The Stanford Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum, which as a body has not taken an official position
on the proposal, is planning discussions on the question
of weapons research on campus.
• Graduate students John Larson and Peter Hochschild
are developing a proposal for an autumn quarter
SWOPSI course entitled "Military Funding in the Uni
versity," which would explore the nature of defense
funding here and touch on the proposal at SSRL.
• Individual members of the Stanford chapter of the
Democratic Socialists of America expressed concern
about the proposal and said the group will discuss offi
cial actions in the future.
Adelstein's petition, which was introduced and signed
yesterday by about 250 people, including many faculty
members, is part of the platform for his ASSU Senate
campaign. Promising to introduce the resolution to the
senate if elected, he said the SSRL proposal "should be
heavily criticized by students as well as the faculty."
"I feel it's wrong to have nuclear development on
campus. But I'm not a radical. I'm just trying to work to
save the future," Adelstein said.
Adelstein's resolution was written to assert agreement
with 280 staff members at SLAC who have signed a peti
tion protesting the proposal. The resolution says that the
staff members "would be unwilling collaborators in
programs they find unacceptable." SSRL is administra
tively independent of SLAC but its continued operation

depends on the accelerator.
The proposed research at SSRL would be sponsored
by Lawrence Livermore, Sandia and Los Alamos National
Laboratories in conjunction with the University of
California.
It would provide for the construction of additional
beam lines at SSRL which would research, among many
other non-military subjects, nuclear weapons-pumped
X-ray lasers, a type of space-based anti-ballistic missile.
It would be the first time SSRL has been involved in
weapons research and the first time SLAC, which is one
of the few laboratories in the United States that now
steers clear of nuclear weapons-related research, would
be involved in such research.
"It's involuntary servitude," said Larson. "They (the
SLAC staffers who have signed the petition) morally
don't want to work on weapon systems and they would
be forced to."
Larson said many staff members at SLAC said they
would quit if the proposal is accepted.
Hochschild said, however, that the proposed research
"is nothing new." Hochschild said many department,
on campus have as their primary source of
funding the Department of Defense and that the SSRL
proposal "is just one more step towards turning this
place into a military lab."
The Faculty Senate accepted last week a resolution
introduced by Physics Prof. Robert Mozley asking its
Committee on Research to examine "the character and
volume of weapons-related research" here.
