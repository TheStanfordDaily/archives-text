# Arms research opposition grows
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
A number of small student groups here are slowly
mobilizing in opposition to a proposal at the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) which would
aid research in nuclear weapons.
In a related development, Bernd Crasemann, a
member of SSRL's proposal review panel, said he ex
pects the panel to make a recommendation whether or
not to accept the proposed research project within a
week after its April 20 meeting.
SSRL Director Arthur Bienenstock said he would make
the ultimate decision on the proposal soon after he

receives the panel's recommendation.
The campus groups' actions are the first signs of con
solidated student opposition to the proposal, which has
stirred tangible concern among faculty and staff mem
bers at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
and elsewhere in the University.
• lon Adelstein, a junior majoring in political science,
is circulating a petition that he hopes will be signed by
iOOO people on campus asking the ASSU Senate to adopt
a resolution opposing the proposed research project
and any other research dedicated to nuclear weapons.
