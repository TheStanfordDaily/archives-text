# Cardinal crew clubs oar off at Classic

### BETH KLEID 
While most Stanford students vac
ationed during spring break, the men
and women's crew teams stuck around
and went through grueling double
workouts. But in the end the crew
teams got their break. While students
had to return for the first week of clas
ses, the crew teams got to take a trip to
San Diego to row in the San Diego Crew
Classic.
Last Thursday morning the crew
teams piled into rented vans, and
headed south to participate in the Crew
Classic held last Saturday on San
Diego's Mission Bay. This race is eagerly
awaited because it is the first of the sea
son.
"Everyone was really excited about
the -race," said women's crew captain
Margi Fetter. "It comes at a time when
we have just had no fun at all during
spring break, and it gives us a chance to

have some fun. It is also a good time
because it comes early in the quarter.
People aren't worried about school and
they can concentrate on crew."
The crew teams prepared for the re
gatta with intensive workouts over
spring break. Unfortunately, poor wea
ther conditions disrupted the spring
training. Both men and women's per
formances in San Diego were affected
by the fact that they did not practice
enough over break because of rainy
weather.
"The weather affected our practice,
and the men didn't build as much speed
as we had hoped to build. Because of
the rain during break we had to row
double workouts the first three days of
last week, and everyone was tired at the
race in San Diego," said men's crew
'captain Steve Debtnham.
Women's coach, John Davis, echoed
Debenham's complaints about the wea
ther. "The bad weather affected our

ability to go fast. We have to work on
finding more speed," he said.
Both men and women's teams were
not totally satisfied with their perform
ances at the Crew Classic. The varsity
men took sixth place in the petit finals.
They did not make the finals because
they were beat out by University of
Washington, UCLA and Vale.
The junior varsity men too were
knocked out of the finals. UC-lrvine
took third in the )V race, coming in
ahead of the Card boat. The freshmen
took fourth in the finals, and the novice
boat took third behind UC-Berkeley
and UCLA.
"The freshmen and novice did better
than they were expected to do, but the
varsity and )V had a disappointing
weekend," commented Debenham.
"The vArsity had had lUi:k of the draw,
and faced the toughest competitors in
their race."
The varsity women took fourth place

in their race, behind Yale, University of
Victoria and University of Washington.
The Card women's novice boat cap
tured first place, pulling in ahead of
Loyola, San Diego State and UCLA.
Because it was the first race of the
season, the San Diego Crew Classic al
lowed the teams to find out where they
stand in relation to other crews. "We
definitely have our work cut out for us.
The men's crew is a team on the rise,
and I think that we are going to surprise
a lot of teams this season," said De
benham.
The women assessed the coming sea
son after the Crew Classic, too. "Now
we are the second fastest crew in the
West. Washington is No. 1 and nobody
has beaten them in two years. We
would love to be the first," said Davis.
The Sari Crew Classic host&cJ
rowers from the United States and
Canada, and attracted 15,000 spec
tators.
