Augusta, Ca. - Ray Floyd shoul
dered his way into a tie yesterday for
the first round lead in the 47th Mas
ters golf tournament.
Floyd's 7-foot birdie putt finished
off a 5-under-par67 that put him in a
share of the top spot with Jack Ren
ner and Dr. Gil Morgan, the non
practicing optometrist who won the
first two tournaments of the season.
But the day belonged to Arnold
Palmer, that much-loved 53-year
man who won the first of his four
Masters crowns a quarter-century
ago.
Cheered on by an enthusiasticgal
lery of thousands, slipping and slid
ing in joyous abandon over the rain
slickened rolling hills of the Augusta
National Golf Club course, Arnold
scrambled in and out of trouble,
found a ditch and hit a tree and still
produced a 68 that left him a single
stroke off the pace.
Tied with him at 68 were 21-year
old amateur Jim Hallet, J.C. Snead,
former Masters champions Seve

Hiallesteros of Spain and 45-year-old
Charles Coody, whose last official
triumph came in this event in 1971.
Defending titleholder Craig
Stadler played the last seven holes
five under to get in at 69. He was tied
with Bruce Lietzke.
Tom Watson, a two-time winner
here and currently the holder of the
U.S. and British Open titles, birdied
the two back-nine par-5 holes to get
in at 70.
Jack Nicklaus, five-time Masters
winnerand holderof a record 17 ma
jor professional titles, struggled to a
73 that left him six shots back.
China breaks sports ties
Peking — China yesterday can
celed all remaining sports and cul
tural exchange programs with the
United States this year in sharp re
taliation for America's granting polit
ical asylum to a leading woman ten
nis player.
China's Culture Ministry and the
All-China Sports Federation an
nounced the cancellation of eight
cultural exchange programs and
China's withdrawal from 10 interna
tional tournaments in the United
States in 1983.
The Chinese decision apparently
will not affect China's plans to send
about 300 athletes to the 1984 Sum
mer Olympics in Los Angeles, its first
full-scale participation in a summer
games.

The order does not apply to tour
ism and also apparently does not af
fect the 8,000 to 10,000 Chinese stu
dents and scholars in the United
States and the 300 American students
and 250 experts in China.
The sports events China now will
not enter are tournaments in water
polo, women's softball, track and
field, cycling, equestrian events,
wind surfing, swimming, rowing,
canoeing and a pre-Olympic vol
leyball tournament in October.
China's women's team has won
the world volleyball championship
for two years in a row.

Oakland — Andre Thornton went
4-for-5 with a double, a homer and
four runs batted in to raise his season
RBI totaltoeightastheCleveland In
dians dumped the Oakland A's 9-1
last night.
The Indians jumped out to a 6-0
lead after two innings to provide
plenty of cushion for winning
pitcher Len Barker, who allowed six
hits in seven innings. Neal Heaton
pitched the final two innings. Loser
Tom Underwood lasted only 1 1 /3 in
nings as the first of three Oakland
pitchers.
On Wednesday, pitcher Mike
Norris, who said he was lucky he
wasn't killed in a car accident on the
way to the ballpark, and Rickey Hen

derson led the A's to a 5-3 over the
Indians.
Norris escaped serious injury but
destroyed his new BMW car when
the front wheels locked rounding a
curve on a hillside, sending him
crashing into a telephone poll at 25
mph.
Norris shook off the scare and had
a two-hit shutout going when he left
because of tightening back muscles
in the sixth inning.

China breaks sports ties
Peking — China yesterday can

China's Culture Ministry and the
All-China Sports Federation an
nounced the cancellation of eight
cultural exchange programs and
China's withdrawal from 10 interna
tional tournaments in the United

will not affect China's plans to send
about 300 athletes to the 1984 Sum
mer Olympics in Los Angeles, its first
full-scale participation in a summer
games.

The order does not apply to tour
ism and also apparently does not af

States and the 300 American students
and 250 experts in China.
The sports events China now will
not enter are tournaments in water
polo, women's softball, track and
field, cycling, equestrian events,
wind surfing, swimming, rowing,
canoeing and a pre-Olympic vol
leyball tournament in October.
China's women's team has won
the world volleyball championship
for two years in a row.
