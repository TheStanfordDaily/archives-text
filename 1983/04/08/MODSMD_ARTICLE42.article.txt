### SARAH CARREL 
Stanford's premier gymnast,
John Levy, competed last night
in the all-around competition
of the NCAA finals at Penn
State University.
The freshman showed he
can hold his own against the
best in the nation, tying for
23rd with Michigan State's
Milan Stanovich in the all
around competition. His final
score from the six events was
53.30.
Levy's performance was not
his best, though. He scored an
astonishing 56.55 at the Pac-10
competition here at Stanford
only three weeks ago, a
career-best mark for the native
of New Orleans, La.
Head coach Sadao Hamada
thought the 56.55 score was tel
ling of things to come. "John
Levy has a great future," said
Hamada, who went on to state
that experience was the only
needed element to make Levy
one of the nation's elite.

mar lived up to his No. I rank

scored a 9.30 in this area, with a
9.20 on the floor and an 8.95 in
the rings, one of Levy's spe
cialties. The freshman is also
