"/ can make a movie
out of the worst thing
you ever wrote/'
— Howard Hawks to
Ernest Hemingway
"You know how to
whistle, don't you? You
just put your lips togeth
er and blow."
— Originally written by
Howard Hawks for a
Lauren Bacatt screen fesr.
To Have and Have Not
(1944) *
Festival, Palo Alto
Warner Brothers bought the
title of an Ernest Hemingway
novella, but the crackling Jules
Furthman-William Faulkner
script has virtually nothing to
do with the book. In this first of
four movies Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall made togeth
er, she teaches him how to
whistle and seems far too sexy
to turn into the dried-up, stri
dent trouper she would be
come after his death. They play
together marvellously in this
immensely enjoyable romantic
adventure melodrama, super
bly crafted by Howard Hawks
and co-starring Walter Bren
nan, Hoagy Carmichael,
Sheldon Leonard, Dolores
Moran, Dan Seymour and even
Marcel Dalio (of Renoir's
Grand Illusion and Rules of the
Game).
Plays through Wednesday
with Dead Reckoning.
The King and I (1956)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The famous Rodgers & Ham
merstein musical, based on the
Margaret Landon novel Anna
and (he King of Siam. Like all
their hit shows (and the movie
adaptations), it has a pre
posterously inflated reputa
tion: if the maudlin makes you
cringe, stay away. Deborah Kerr
(her singing voice dubbed by
Marni Nixon, of course) plays
the hoop-skirted English widow
who trundles herself and her
son off to 19th-century Siam,
where the king (Yul Brynner)
employs her to teach his dozens
and dozens of children. He is
supposed to be caught be
tween the traditions he was
raised in and a desire for his
country to join the modern
world, but since both alter
natives are represented by in
terminable series of homilies,
the conflict may strike you as
less than earth-shattering. Yul
Brynner's performance is so fa
mous that it may seem almost
impolite to point out that he
isn't very good. Ernest Lehman
adapted the script (he hardly
it, in fact); Wal'er Lang
directed; and the cast also in
cludes Rita Moreno, Martin
Benson, Alan Mowbray, Geof
frey Toone and Terry Saunders.
There is one well-staged
number — the "Small House of
Uncle Thomas" ballet. (The ori
ginal prints contained two
numbers, "I Have Dreamed"
and "Shall I Tell You What I
Think of You?," that have since
been cut.)
Plays Sunday with The Sound
of Music.
The Marquise of O (1976)
Haus Mitteleuropa
In the famous Heinrich von
Kleist story, a widow raped dur
ing a siege becomes pregnant
and seeks her seducer; the
handsome young count who is
really responsible for her con
dition is the last person she sus
pects. In the hands of Eric
Rohmer, this ironic little fable
becomes dull and overdressed,
like literature reduced to its
Masterpiece Theatre
equivalent. The only possible
reason to sit through it is Edith
Clever, who plays the title role.
(Bruno Ganz's performance as
the Count may drive you away.)
Plays Thursday evening.

Harold and Maude (1971)
Kresge Auditorium
This was one of Hal Ashby's
early pictures, and though it has
an eccentric appeal, it is
clumsy: sequences are ended
before they have been
punctuated with the laughs
they seem to be heading for,
and all the jokes seem to repeat
themselves. Bud Cort, the wim
py, virginal star of Robert
Altman's Brewster McCloud
(he was also the boy Robert
Duvall intimidated in
M*A*S*H) certainly hasn't the
presence to hold the focus of a
whole movie; the scenes that
require "him to take the camera
are dull. But Ruth Gordon, in
one of her rare good movie per-

Diabolique (1955) ★
Fox, Redwood City
In Henri-Georges Clouzot's
macabre classic, the head
master of a boys' school (Paul
Meurisse) is so cruel and exerts
such an unyielding grip on the
two women in his life — his wife
(Vera Clouzot) and his mistress
(Simone Signoret) — that they
plot his demise together. Very,
very scary, though not always a
pleasant experience. (Don't see
it by yourself.) Boileua and
Narcejac wrote the novel on
which Clouzot based his film,
and the supporting cast in
cludes Charles Vanel and
Michel Serrault.
Plays Monday with Picnic at
Hanging Rock.

formances, makes us under
stand why her career has en
dured so long. These two have a
reverse May-December affair.
Despite the treacly, pedantic
side of the picture (which is all
about embracing life and living
it to the fullest), it gets to you —
perhaps because Gordon, strut
ting like a grand old
vaudevillian, is a living embodi
ment of what Maude believes
in.
Plays tomorrow evening.

Inherit the Wind (1960)
Kresge Auditorium
The Jerome Lawrence-Rob
ert E. Lee play about the Scopes
Monkey Trial is a dreadful
fraud, and this Stanley Kramer
production of it sticks fast to the
synthetic original — not even
the gospel singer who croons
"That Old Time Religion" be
hind the opening credits and
"The Battle Hymn of the Re
public" behind the end credits
sounds authentic. The deluded
townspeople are the easy target
of the first half of the movie
(and Kramer stages their scenes
as though he were working on
The Music Man), but by the end
it's the cynical journalist — the
H.L. Mencken character, who
tells the Clarence Darrow
stand-in, "I may be rancid but
ter, but I'm on your side of the
bread" — who has become the
villain, and Darrow gives us
some reason to believe that he,
too (unlike Mencken), is a re
ligious man. Were the film
makers afraid we couldn't like

an atheist? Spencer Tracy gives
a stuffy, pedantic performance
as Darrow, and Fredric March
isn't terribly good as William
Jennings Bryan, though at least
he's fairly rousing. (Was it a a
deliberate iriove to bury him in
simian make-up?) Gene Kelly is
too square and slow to play
Mencken — too nice a guy. The
big cast also includes Florence
Eldridge, in a boring grand-lady
performance as March's wife,
Dick York, Donna Anderson,
Harry Morgan and Jimmy Boyd.
Plays tonight.
Tron
Memorial Auditorium
Jeff Bridges plays a young
renegade computer genius
whose best ideas have been sto
len by villainous David Warner;
when he investigates, the "mas
ter controller" in the system
sucks him in and turns him into
a video game pawn. The story
by Steven Lisberger and Bonnie
Macbird has a few clever ideas
in it (the funniest: inside the
computer, power runs in

streams, and the computer
creatures refresh themselves
from these and talk about the
joy of finding a "pure source"),
but the narrative is a mess, and
it's very hard to figure out
where you are in the constantly
changing computer landscape.
Only diehard video game
freaks are likely to assimilate all
the rules. And the sound rec
ording, in Dolby Stereo, can
drive you crazy: the dialogue
fades in and out, and there's so
much noise in the side speakers
that you can't always make out
the relevant information. What
dialogue you can hear is
squeaky clean and utterly un
convincing. Jeff Bridges is made
up to look vaguely stony and
disreputable, and you can see
that he's aching to talk like a
real human being, but he's
stuck — and still he's the best
thing in the movie. Lisberger
wrote and directed; Bruce Box
leitner, Cindy Morgan and
Barnard Hughes co-star.
Plays Sunday evening.
The Sound of Music (1965)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
It's the apotheosis of a
Hallmark Greeting Card world
— an almost perfect movie, a
complete movie. Everything in
it has been programmed for
maximum efficiency: Robert
Wise's shrewd, buy-a-tear
with-every-frame direction,
Ted McCord's flawless postcard
photography, the lavish, unin
ventive Boris Leven set designs,
the l-love-a-crescendo or
chestrations of the Richard
Rodgers-Oscar Hammerstein
songs. Nothing is better than
mediocre, but nothing is less
than superbly polished; you

can't attack The Sound of Music
for being tacky. You can't attack
the music, because by its very
nature it's beyond criticism
(like Lawrence Welk or Man
tovani); you can't attack the act
ing, because there's really no
body in the movie except Julie
Andrews, and the image she
projects — running through the
Alps with her pursed lips and
her perfect round tones and
her butch haircut — is the em
bodiment of everything the
film stands for. But if all this
doesn't make you drunk with
joy, you may vomit. Ernest
Lehman adapted the Howard
Lindsay-Russel Crouse play.
With Christopher Plummer
(who, to his credit, seems to be
in a different picture), Richard
Haydn, Peggy Wood, Eleanor
Parker, and a gaggle of revolt
ing children.
Plays Sunday with The King
and I.
Persona (1967) ★
Fox, Redwood City
Because of the beauty and
suggestiveness of some of the
sequences, the intriguing way
in which the film deconstructs
the process of filmmaking, and
Bibi Andersson's masterly per
formance in the central role, In
gmar Bergman's essentially
two-character movie is often
considered his best, and one of
the masterpieces of the cinema.
Certainly there is greatness in it,
but you may be bewildered and
finally frustrated by it if you sus
pect that its ambiguousness de
rives from indecision rather
than art — that Bergman simply
didn't work out his ideas. An
dersson plays a nurse hired to
care for an actress (played by Liv
Ullmann) who has given up
speech; as the silence grows
ever more ponderous, the
nurse begins to articulate her
own problems, and in some un
explained way the two women
switch roles. At one point, the
nurse describes an orgy she par
ticipated in with a girl friend
and a pair of adolescent boys:
it's an extraordinary sequence,
and so vivid that years after
seeing Persona some people
think they remember that
Bergman actually filmed the
orgy.
Plays Wednesday with Elvira
Madigan.

Plays Sunday with The King

Persona (1967) ★
Fox, Redwood City
Because of the beauty and
suggestiveness of some of the
sequences, the intriguing way
in which the film deconstructs
the process of filmmaking, and
Bibi Andersson's masterly per
formance in the central role, In
gmar Bergman's essentially
two-character movie is often
considered his best, and one of
the masterpieces of the cinema.
Certainly there is greatness in it,
but you may be bewildered and
finally frustrated by it if you sus
pect that its ambiguousness de
rives from indecision rather
than art — that Bergman simply
didn't work out his ideas. An
dersson plays a nurse hired to
care for an actress (played by Liv
Ullmann) who has given up
speech; as the silence grows
ever more ponderous, the
nurse begins to articulate her
own problems, and in some un
explained way the two women
switch roles. At one point, the
nurse describes an orgy she par
ticipated in with a girl friend
and a pair of adolescent boys:
it's an extraordinary sequence,
and so vivid that years after
seeing Persona some people
think they remember that
Bergman actually filmed the
orgy.
Plays Wednesday with Elvira
Madigan.

To Have and Have Not
(1944) *
Festival, Palo Alto
Warner Brothers bought the
title of an Ernest Hemingway
novella, but the crackling Jules
Furthman-William Faulkner
script has virtually nothing to
do with the book. In this first of
four movies Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall made togeth
er, she teaches him how to
whistle and seems far too sexy
to turn into the dried-up, stri
dent trouper she would be
come after his death. They play
together marvellously in this
immensely enjoyable romantic
adventure melodrama, super
bly crafted by Howard Hawks
and co-starring Walter Bren
nan, Hoagy Carmichael,
Sheldon Leonard, Dolores
Moran, Dan Seymour and even
Marcel Dalio (of Renoir's
Grand Illusion and Rules of the
Game).
Plays through Wednesday
with Dead Reckoning.
The King and I (1956)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The famous Rodgers & Ham
merstein musical, based on the
Margaret Landon novel Anna
and (he King of Siam. Like all
their hit shows (and the movie
adaptations), it has a pre
posterously inflated reputa
tion: if the maudlin makes you
cringe, stay away. Deborah Kerr
(her singing voice dubbed by
Marni Nixon, of course) plays
the hoop-skirted English widow
who trundles herself and her
son off to 19th-century Siam,
where the king (Yul Brynner)
employs her to teach his dozens
and dozens of children. He is
supposed to be caught be
tween the traditions he was
raised in and a desire for his
country to join the modern
world, but since both alter
natives are represented by in
terminable series of homilies,
the conflict may strike you as
less than earth-shattering. Yul
Brynner's performance is so fa
mous that it may seem almost
impolite to point out that he
isn't very good. Ernest Lehman
adapted the script (he hardly
it, in fact); Wal'er Lang
directed; and the cast also in
cludes Rita Moreno, Martin
Benson, Alan Mowbray, Geof
frey Toone and Terry Saunders.
There is one well-staged
number — the "Small House of
Uncle Thomas" ballet. (The ori
ginal prints contained two
numbers, "I Have Dreamed"
and "Shall I Tell You What I
Think of You?," that have since
been cut.)
Plays Sunday with The Sound
of Music.
The Marquise of O (1976)
Haus Mitteleuropa
In the famous Heinrich von
Kleist story, a widow raped dur
ing a siege becomes pregnant
and seeks her seducer; the
handsome young count who is
really responsible for her con
dition is the last person she sus
pects. In the hands of Eric
Rohmer, this ironic little fable
becomes dull and overdressed,
like literature reduced to its
Masterpiece Theatre
equivalent. The only possible
reason to sit through it is Edith
Clever, who plays the title role.
(Bruno Ganz's performance as
the Count may drive you away.)

such an unyielding grip on the
two women in his life — his wife

Inherit the Wind (1960)
Kresge Auditorium
The Jerome Lawrence-Rob
ert E. Lee play about the Scopes
Monkey Trial is a dreadful
fraud, and this Stanley Kramer
production of it sticks fast to the
synthetic original — not even
the gospel singer who croons
"That Old Time Religion" be
hind the opening credits and
"The Battle Hymn of the Re
public" behind the end credits
sounds authentic. The deluded
townspeople are the easy target
of the first half of the movie
(and Kramer stages their scenes
as though he were working on
The Music Man), but by the end
it's the cynical journalist — the
H.L. Mencken character, who
tells the Clarence Darrow
stand-in, "I may be rancid but
ter, but I'm on your side of the
bread" — who has become the
villain, and Darrow gives us
some reason to believe that he,
too (unlike Mencken), is a re
ligious man. Were the film
makers afraid we couldn't like

an atheist? Spencer Tracy gives
a stuffy, pedantic performance
as Darrow, and Fredric March
isn't terribly good as William
Jennings Bryan, though at least
he's fairly rousing. (Was it a a
deliberate iriove to bury him in
simian make-up?) Gene Kelly is
too square and slow to play
Mencken — too nice a guy. The
big cast also includes Florence
Eldridge, in a boring grand-lady
performance as March's wife,
Dick York, Donna Anderson,
Harry Morgan and Jimmy Boyd.

Jeff Bridges plays a young
renegade computer genius
whose best ideas have been sto
len by villainous David Warner;
when he investigates, the "mas
ter controller" in the system
sucks him in and turns him into
a video game pawn. The story
by Steven Lisberger and Bonnie
Macbird has a few clever ideas
in it (the funniest: inside the
computer, power runs in

streams, and the computer
creatures refresh themselves
from these and talk about the
joy of finding a "pure source"),
but the narrative is a mess, and
it's very hard to figure out
where you are in the constantly
changing computer landscape.
Only diehard video game
freaks are likely to assimilate all
the rules. And the sound rec
ording, in Dolby Stereo, can
drive you crazy: the dialogue
fades in and out, and there's so
much noise in the side speakers
that you can't always make out
the relevant information. What
dialogue you can hear is
squeaky clean and utterly un
convincing. Jeff Bridges is made
up to look vaguely stony and
disreputable, and you can see
that he's aching to talk like a
real human being, but he's
stuck — and still he's the best
thing in the movie. Lisberger
wrote and directed; Bruce Box
leitner, Cindy Morgan and
Barnard Hughes co-star.
Plays Sunday evening.
The Sound of Music (1965)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
It's the apotheosis of a
Hallmark Greeting Card world
— an almost perfect movie, a
complete movie. Everything in
it has been programmed for
maximum efficiency: Robert
Wise's shrewd, buy-a-tear
with-every-frame direction,
Ted McCord's flawless postcard
photography, the lavish, unin
ventive Boris Leven set designs,
the l-love-a-crescendo or
chestrations of the Richard
Rodgers-Oscar Hammerstein
songs. Nothing is better than
mediocre, but nothing is less
than superbly polished; you

can't attack The Sound of Music
for being tacky. You can't attack
the music, because by its very
nature it's beyond criticism
(like Lawrence Welk or Man
tovani); you can't attack the act
ing, because there's really no
body in the movie except Julie
Andrews, and the image she
projects — running through the
Alps with her pursed lips and
her perfect round tones and
her butch haircut — is the em

fades in and out, and there's so
much noise in the side speakers
that you can't always make out
the relevant information. What
dialogue you can hear is
squeaky clean and utterly un
convincing. Jeff Bridges is made
up to look vaguely stony and
disreputable, and you can see
that he's aching to talk like a
real human being, but he's
stuck — and still he's the best
thing in the movie. Lisberger
wrote and directed; Bruce Box
leitner, Cindy Morgan and
Barnard Hughes co-star.
Plays Sunday evening.
The Sound of Music (1965)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
It's the apotheosis of a
Hallmark Greeting Card world
— an almost perfect movie, a
complete movie. Everything in
it has been programmed for
maximum efficiency: Robert
Wise's shrewd, buy-a-tear
with-every-frame direction,
Ted McCord's flawless postcard
photography, the lavish, unin
ventive Boris Leven set designs,
the l-love-a-crescendo or
chestrations of the Richard
Rodgers-Oscar Hammerstein
songs. Nothing is better than
mediocre, but nothing is less
than superbly polished; you

can't attack The Sound of Music
for being tacky. You can't attack
the music, because by its very
nature it's beyond criticism
(like Lawrence Welk or Man
tovani); you can't attack the act
ing, because there's really no
body in the movie except Julie
Andrews, and the image she
projects — running through the
Alps with her pursed lips and
her perfect round tones and
her butch haircut — is the em
bodiment of everything the
film stands for. But if all this
doesn't make you drunk with
joy, you may vomit. Ernest
Lehman adapted the Howard
Lindsay-Russel Crouse play.
With Christopher Plummer
(who, to his credit, seems to be
in a different picture), Richard
Haydn, Peggy Wood, Eleanor
Parker, and a gaggle of revolt
ing children.
Plays Sunday with The King
and I.
Persona (1967) ★
Fox, Redwood City
Because of the beauty and
suggestiveness of some of the
sequences, the intriguing way
in which the film deconstructs
the process of filmmaking, and
Bibi Andersson's masterly per
formance in the central role, In
gmar Bergman's essentially
two-character movie is often
considered his best, and one of
the masterpieces of the cinema.
Certainly there is greatness in it,
but you may be bewildered and
finally frustrated by it if you sus
pect that its ambiguousness de
rives from indecision rather
than art — that Bergman simply
didn't work out his ideas. An
dersson plays a nurse hired to
care for an actress (played by Liv
Ullmann) who has given up
speech; as the silence grows
ever more ponderous, the
nurse begins to articulate her
own problems, and in some un
explained way the two women
switch roles. At one point, the
nurse describes an orgy she par
ticipated in with a girl friend
and a pair of adolescent boys:
it's an extraordinary sequence,
and so vivid that years after
seeing Persona some people
think they remember that
Bergman actually filmed the
orgy.
Plays Wednesday with Elvira
Madigan.

"/ can make a movie
out of the worst thing
you ever wrote/'
— Howard Hawks to
Ernest Hemingway
"You know how to
whistle, don't you? You
just put your lips togeth
er and blow."
— Originally written by
Howard Hawks for a
Lauren Bacatt screen fesr.
To Have and Have Not
(1944) *
Festival, Palo Alto
Warner Brothers bought the
title of an Ernest Hemingway
novella, but the crackling Jules
Furthman-William Faulkner
script has virtually nothing to
do with the book. In this first of
four movies Humphrey Bogart
and Lauren Bacall made togeth
er, she teaches him how to
whistle and seems far too sexy
to turn into the dried-up, stri
dent trouper she would be
come after his death. They play
together marvellously in this
immensely enjoyable romantic
adventure melodrama, super
bly crafted by Howard Hawks
and co-starring Walter Bren
nan, Hoagy Carmichael,
Sheldon Leonard, Dolores
Moran, Dan Seymour and even
Marcel Dalio (of Renoir's
Grand Illusion and Rules of the
Game).
Plays through Wednesday
with Dead Reckoning.
The King and I (1956)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The famous Rodgers & Ham
merstein musical, based on the
Margaret Landon novel Anna
and (he King of Siam. Like all
their hit shows (and the movie
adaptations), it has a pre
posterously inflated reputa
tion: if the maudlin makes you
cringe, stay away. Deborah Kerr
(her singing voice dubbed by
Marni Nixon, of course) plays
the hoop-skirted English widow
who trundles herself and her
son off to 19th-century Siam,
where the king (Yul Brynner)
employs her to teach his dozens
and dozens of children. He is
supposed to be caught be
tween the traditions he was
raised in and a desire for his
country to join the modern
world, but since both alter
natives are represented by in
terminable series of homilies,
the conflict may strike you as
less than earth-shattering. Yul
Brynner's performance is so fa
mous that it may seem almost
impolite to point out that he
isn't very good. Ernest Lehman
adapted the script (he hardly
it, in fact); Wal'er Lang
directed; and the cast also in
cludes Rita Moreno, Martin
Benson, Alan Mowbray, Geof
frey Toone and Terry Saunders.
There is one well-staged
number — the "Small House of
Uncle Thomas" ballet. (The ori
ginal prints contained two
numbers, "I Have Dreamed"
and "Shall I Tell You What I
Think of You?," that have since
been cut.)
Plays Sunday with The Sound
of Music.
The Marquise of O (1976)
Haus Mitteleuropa
In the famous Heinrich von
Kleist story, a widow raped dur
ing a siege becomes pregnant
and seeks her seducer; the
handsome young count who is
really responsible for her con
dition is the last person she sus
pects. In the hands of Eric
Rohmer, this ironic little fable
becomes dull and overdressed,
like literature reduced to its
Masterpiece Theatre
equivalent. The only possible
reason to sit through it is Edith
Clever, who plays the title role.
(Bruno Ganz's performance as
the Count may drive you away.)
Plays Thursday evening.

Harold and Maude (1971)
Kresge Auditorium
This was one of Hal Ashby's
early pictures, and though it has
an eccentric appeal, it is
clumsy: sequences are ended
before they have been
punctuated with the laughs
they seem to be heading for,
and all the jokes seem to repeat
themselves. Bud Cort, the wim
py, virginal star of Robert
Altman's Brewster McCloud
(he was also the boy Robert
Duvall intimidated in
M*A*S*H) certainly hasn't the
presence to hold the focus of a
whole movie; the scenes that
require "him to take the camera
are dull. But Ruth Gordon, in
one of her rare good movie per-

Diabolique (1955) ★
Fox, Redwood City
In Henri-Georges Clouzot's
macabre classic, the head
master of a boys' school (Paul
Meurisse) is so cruel and exerts
such an unyielding grip on the
two women in his life — his wife
(Vera Clouzot) and his mistress
(Simone Signoret) — that they
plot his demise together. Very,
very scary, though not always a
pleasant experience. (Don't see
it by yourself.) Boileua and
Narcejac wrote the novel on
which Clouzot based his film,
and the supporting cast in
cludes Charles Vanel and
Michel Serrault.
Plays Monday with Picnic at
Hanging Rock.

stand why her career has en
dured so long. These two have a
reverse May-December affair.
Despite the treacly, pedantic
side of the picture (which is all
about embracing life and living
it to the fullest), it gets to you —
perhaps because Gordon, strut
ting like a grand old
vaudevillian, is a living embodi
ment of what Maude believes
in.
Plays tomorrow evening.

Inherit the Wind (1960)
Kresge Auditorium
The Jerome Lawrence-Rob
ert E. Lee play about the Scopes
Monkey Trial is a dreadful
fraud, and this Stanley Kramer
production of it sticks fast to the
synthetic original — not even
the gospel singer who croons
"That Old Time Religion" be
hind the opening credits and
"The Battle Hymn of the Re
public" behind the end credits
sounds authentic. The deluded
townspeople are the easy target
of the first half of the movie
(and Kramer stages their scenes
as though he were working on
The Music Man), but by the end
it's the cynical journalist — the
H.L. Mencken character, who
tells the Clarence Darrow
stand-in, "I may be rancid but
ter, but I'm on your side of the
bread" — who has become the
villain, and Darrow gives us
some reason to believe that he,
too (unlike Mencken), is a re
ligious man. Were the film
makers afraid we couldn't like

an atheist? Spencer Tracy gives
a stuffy, pedantic performance
as Darrow, and Fredric March
isn't terribly good as William
Jennings Bryan, though at least
he's fairly rousing. (Was it a a
deliberate iriove to bury him in
simian make-up?) Gene Kelly is
too square and slow to play
Mencken — too nice a guy. The
big cast also includes Florence
Eldridge, in a boring grand-lady
performance as March's wife,
Dick York, Donna Anderson,
Harry Morgan and Jimmy Boyd.
Plays tonight.

Memorial Auditorium
Jeff Bridges plays a young
renegade computer genius
whose best ideas have been sto
len by villainous David Warner;
when he investigates, the "mas
ter controller" in the system
sucks him in and turns him into
a video game pawn. The story
by Steven Lisberger and Bonnie
Macbird has a few clever ideas
in it (the funniest: inside the
computer, power runs in

streams, and the computer
creatures refresh themselves
from these and talk about the
joy of finding a "pure source"),
but the narrative is a mess, and
it's very hard to figure out
where you are in the constantly
changing computer landscape.
Only diehard video game
freaks are likely to assimilate all
the rules. And the sound rec
ording, in Dolby Stereo, can
drive you crazy: the dialogue
fades in and out, and there's so
much noise in the side speakers
that you can't always make out
