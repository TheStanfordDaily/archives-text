# Biology Prof. Ehrlich's speech urges nuclear disarmament
## 
### VICKI MOORE 
The end of all war and a smaller
human population are necessary for
a "sane world" in the future, Biology
Prof. Paul Ehrlich told a friendly au
dience last night in Kresge Au
ditorium.
The political power of the people
can be mobilized to stop the arms
race, just as it was mobilized to stop
the Vietnam War, he told the crowd
of about 200.
"We must takethe risk in thedirec
tion of disarmament. Why take the
risk of a bigger arms race . . . which
will have only one outcome in the
end?" Ehrlich said.
The world must be totally free of
war, not just nuclear war, because
the knowledge of nuclear weapons
will always be around even if nuclear
disarmament occurs, he said.
According to Ehrlich, many people
are missing the fact that conventional
weapons are being built up so much
"that even without nuclear weapons
we will still be able to destroy the
planet."
Ehrlich, who is currently organiz
ing meetings with other scientists to
"get a firm grasp of the ecological
effects of nuclear war," said that
nothing resembling this society will
persist in the Northern Hemisphere
after a full scale nuclear war. He also
acknowledged the possibility of total
extinction of the human race pro
posd by jonathan Schell, author of
Fate of the Earth.
"If we get rid of war, (an addi

tional) $600 billion per year would be
available for poor people which
would vastly improve their condi
tion," said Ehrlich.
In response to a question about
what individuals can do to help
change the world for the better,
Ehrlich said people should do every
thing possible to remove the current
presidential administration. "The
Reagan administration is the most
dangerous thing that ever happened
to us. . . . We have never faced a
time this critical with such a level of
ignorance," he said.
Former President limmy Carter
had some notions of the problems of
the world, and was an ineffective
politician; but Reagan has no notion
of the problems of the world and is a
consummate politician, he said.
A smaller human population must
also be achieved, said Ehrlich, foun
der of the zero population growth
movement and author of The Popula
tion Bomb. "We are already vastly
overpopulated, burning up capital as
if there's no tomorrow. We have
managed to build our present level
of overpopulation by exploiting a
one-time bonanza of fossil fuels,
deep fertile soils, aquifers, rich
biological diversity . . . and in addi
tion we are destroying species in
volved life support systems."
"We are nickel and diming to
death our life support systems," said
Ehrlich. There are five to 30 million
other species on this planet, provid
ing us with a whole series of abso

lutely indespensible public services
such as the degredation of waste,
supply of fresh water, control of wea
ther and supply of nutrients to ag
ricultural soil, said Ehrlich, and there
are no substitutes.
Ehrlich said that the agricultural
revolution was probably the biggest
mistake humankind made. "Agricul
ture led to cities, which in turn led to
kings, empires, science, the popula
tion explosion . . . which in turn al
lowed homosapiens to become a
global force." The big difference be
tween now and then is that now the
most serious problems have global
implications, rather than being lim
ited to local areas, he said.
