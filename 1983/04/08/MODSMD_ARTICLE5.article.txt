China cuts cultural ties with U.S.
Peking — China severed all sports and official cul
tural exchanges yesterday with the United States until
the end of this year in retaliation for the Reagan ad
ministration's decision to grant political asylum to
Chinese tennis star Hu Na.
The move, coming four days after Hu's request for
asylum wasapproved, cancels Chinese planstopartic
ipate in 10 international sporting events to be held in
the United States. It also revokes a governmental
agreement to exchange films, art shows and concerts
but stops short of halting the numerous cultural af
fairs arranged unofficially in both nations.
Explaining the reprisal, Chinese officials said grant
ing Hu political refuge was "extremely unfriendly" to
China and contradicted the "essential principle' of

promoting wider people-to-people contacts.
Foreign analysts said that while the reprisal cuts
away the least substantive aspects of ties between the
two countries, it signifies a new adversarial quality in
Sino-American relations and shows the limits of co
operation between two societies with such starkly dif
ferent concepts of individual freedom.
Diplomats said the issue has driven a once-budding
strategic partnership to its lowest ebb since Washing
ton and Peking normalized relations in 1979. With
persistent friction over U.S. arms sales to the rival
Taiwanese and with a textile dispute sharply aggravat
ing trade relations, Peking is said to be showing signs
of distancing itself from the United States as it moves
to reduce tensions with the Soviet Union,
