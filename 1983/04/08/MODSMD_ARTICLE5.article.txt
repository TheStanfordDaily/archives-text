China cuts cultural ties with U.S.
Peking — China severed all sports and official cul
tural exchanges yesterday with the United States until
the end of this year in retaliation for the Reagan ad
ministration's decision to grant political asylum to
Chinese tennis star Hu Na.
The move, coming four days after Hu's request for
asylum wasapproved, cancels Chinese planstopartic
ipate in 10 international sporting events to be held in
the United States. It also revokes a governmental
agreement to exchange films, art shows and concerts
but stops short of halting the numerous cultural af
fairs arranged unofficially in both nations.
Explaining the reprisal, Chinese officials said grant
ing Hu political refuge was "extremely unfriendly" to
China and contradicted the "essential principle' of

promoting wider people-to-people contacts.
Foreign analysts said that while the reprisal cuts
away the least substantive aspects of ties between the
two countries, it signifies a new adversarial quality in
Sino-American relations and shows the limits of co
operation between two societies with such starkly dif
ferent concepts of individual freedom.
Diplomats said the issue has driven a once-budding
strategic partnership to its lowest ebb since Washing
ton and Peking normalized relations in 1979. With
persistent friction over U.S. arms sales to the rival
Taiwanese and with a textile dispute sharply aggravat
ing trade relations, Peking is said to be showing signs
of distancing itself from the United States as it moves
to reduce tensions with the Soviet Union,
Senate halves defense increase
Washington — The Republican-controlled Senate
Budget Committee rebelled against President Reagan
yesterday and voted 17-4 to cut his military buildup
program for the next fiscal year by roughly half.
With most Republicans joining all Democratic
members in what committee Chairman Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.), described acerbically asa "repri
mand to the people who advise" the president, the
committee approved a 5 percent increase in military
spending authority after accounting for inflation.
Reagan had requested a 10 percent after-inflation
increase for the Pentagon.
That proposal was rejected 19-2 in the first vote of
the day, which Democrats demanded to show the
degree of opposition to the president's position.
The committee then rejected, 14-7, a "com
promise" proposal from Armed Services Committee
Chairman John Tower (R-Tex.), for an 8 percent in
crease now but more later that would have given Rea
gan roughly what he wanted over a longer period of
time.
The votes added up to Reagan's second major de
feat on defense spending this year, following adop
tion of a budget last month by the Democratic-con
trolled House that would curtail his military buildup
even more severely and, in addition, provide $30
billion in new taxes and $33 billion in social welfare
spending that the administration does not want.
MX called indefensible
Washington — President Reagan's arms advisers
now are saying there is no practical way to protect the
MX missiletothe point of closingthe"windowof vul
nerability" Reagan campaigned against so vigorously
in 1980, it was learned yesterday.
Senators said this shift in position came through
loud and clear as they were briefed on the recom
mendations to be made Monday by Reagan's special
advisory commission on the MX.
It will urge the deployment of 100 MX missilesin ex
isting Minuteman silos in Wyoming, starting in 1987,
plus a crash program to build a new smaller, mobile
and less vulnerable missile by 1991.
Retired Gen. Brent Scowcroft, chairman, and other
members of the panel briefing the senators said they
had concluded that there is no practical way to
harden existing Minuteman silos so they would make
the MX invulnerable, that the MX will be too big and
heavy to be mobile and that the Minuteman silos are
spaced too far apart to make an antiballistic missile
defense feasible.
Astronauts take space walk
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — Tied to 50-foot leashes, two
astronauts took the first U.S. space walk in nearly a
decade yesterday, perfecting ways for shuttle crews to
fix ailing satellites in years to come.
Against the dramatic backdrop of the cloud-mot
tled Earth turning below, astronauts Story Musgrave
and Don Peterson turned an energetic work day into
a joyous and acrobatic outing.
After 3 hours and 50 minutes in Challenger's open
cargo bay, Musgrave took one last look over the side
at the Hawaiian Islands befow.
"It's pretty cloudy over the islands right here," he
said when Mission Control asked if he could see the
volcano Kilauea which has been erupting in recent
weeks.
Musgrave and Peterson tested their $2.1 million
space suits and their own ability to work in the hostile
environment of open space. They practiced with
tools, pretended to free a stuck satellite, maneuvered
a winch with a 100-pound load and carried a 50-
pound object across the cargo bay.
CIA rebuked on Nicaragua
Washington — The chairman of the House In
telligence oversight subcommittee, just retuned from
a trip to Central America, said yesterday that the Rea
gan administration is violating the congressional ban
against supporting attempts to overthrow the leftist
government of Nicaragua.
His statement is the most authoritative con
gressional assertion to date that the two-year-old cov
ert CIA operation has broken the legal bounds im
posed by Congress.
Rep. Wyche Fowler (D-Ga.), told a news con
ference that "under the best of circumstances" the
congressional ban, known as the Boland amendment,
"is not being fully adhered to."
The language in the Boland amendment was first
passed in secret by a House-Senate budget con
ference last August and then sponsored publicly by
Boland during the December budget resolution de
bate. It forbids the administration from taking any ac
tion "for the purpose of overthrowing the govern
ment of Nicaragua or provoking a military exchange
between Nicaragua and Honduras."
Fowler said that he would introduce legislation
next week to set statutory standards for covert actions

to make sure that such "extraordinary" activities are
essential to national security; that potential benefits
outweigh risks, and that covert objectives are consis
tent with "publicly avowed foreign policy."
The legislation also would give the House and Sen
ate Intelligence oversight committees veto power "to
disapprove such operations."
Watt bends on Beach Boys
Washington — Interior Secretary James Watt hur
riedly replaced the capital's welcome mat for the
Beach Boys yesterday after being set straight by
one of their favorite "California Girls." And when
Nancy Reagan got done, the president himself put a
heavy foot to him.
Reagan, it seems, is a fan of the surfin' sound as
much as his wife. So after learning that Watt had
banned the Beach Boys and other rock groups from
the capital's July 4 celebration, he handed the Interior
Secretary a stark reminder of what not to do any
more: a plaster of paris foot with a hole in it.
Watt, who earlier complained that "hard rock" mu
sic had attracted the "wrong element" to the tradi
tional fireworks extravaganza on the Mall, pro
claimed himself a likely fan of the Beach Boys, whose
performances had drawn hundreds of thousands of
people in years past.
"The president is a friend of the Beach Boys and he
likes them, and I'm sure when I get to meet them I'll
like them," Watt said, standing in a drizzling rain after
emerging from the White House.
Changes proposed for senate
Washington — A Senate-created committee has
proposed fundamental changes in the structure and
procedures of that body, known to admirers as the
world's greatest deliberative forum and to frustrated
critics as a cave of the winds.
The recommendations are certain to be con
troversial — Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.), said they will "scare some people to death" —
but the authors say they also would increase Senate
effectiveness greatly.
The proposals are considerable. They include:
— Creating a powerful new position: permanent
presiding officer of the Senate.
— Establishing an agreed-upon annual Senate
agenda for each legislative week with provisions mak
ing it harder to deviate from that agenda.
— Putting restraints on individual senators' rights to
delay proceedings by such devices as quorum calls
and insisting on record votes and the right to place
holds on items awaiting consideration on the floor.
There also would be new restrictions on debate that
might shorten, if not eliminate, filibusters.
— Restructuring the present congressional budget
process, putting it on a two-year cycle and abolishing
the system of reconciliation under which budget res
olutions are made binding.
— Consolidating the various Senate committees,
limiting the number of committee assignments for
each senator and altering the role and composition of
subcommittees drastically.
FDA OKs contraceptive sponge
Washington —The Food and Drug Administration
has approved the marketing of a contraceptive
sponge, a new birth control device for women that
can be purchased without a prescription and that al
lows more "sexual spontaneity" than do some other
products, company officials said.
The manufacturer, VLI Corp. of Costa Mesa, Calif,
said that the one-size-fits-all, disposable
polyurethane sponge, soaked with a commonly used
sperm-killing chemical, is expected to be available
nationwide in early fall. Under the name "Today," the
sponges will be sold for about $1 each.
"The testing of the sponge in nearly 1600 women
since 1979 has shown it to be about 85 percent effec
tive in preventing pregnancy. This effectiveness rate is
in the same range as other vaginal contraceptives
such as the diaphragm or spermicide alone," said FDA
official Faye Peterson.
Diaphragms, however, require fitting in a physi
cian's office, and non-prescription products such as
foams and gels require insertion immediately before
intercourse. The new sponge would provide protec
tion up to 24 hours after insertion.
Stocks gain; volume dips
Retailing issues were the standout performers as the
stock market staged a modest rally yesterday, ending
a four-session decline.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 29.80
points in the last four trading days, recovered 4.16 to
1117.65.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled
69.48 million shares, against 77.14 million in the pre
vious sessio - .
Today's weather
Sunny today with highs in the 60s to low 70s. Light
winds. Fair tonight, with increasing clouds Saturday.
Lows in the upper 30s and 40s.

Senate halves defense increase
Washington — The Republican-controlled Senate
Budget Committee rebelled against President Reagan
yesterday and voted 17-4 to cut his military buildup
program for the next fiscal year by roughly half.
With most Republicans joining all Democratic
members in what committee Chairman Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.), described acerbically asa "repri
mand to the people who advise" the president, the
committee approved a 5 percent increase in military
spending authority after accounting for inflation.
Reagan had requested a 10 percent after-inflation
increase for the Pentagon.
That proposal was rejected 19-2 in the first vote of
the day, which Democrats demanded to show the
degree of opposition to the president's position.
The committee then rejected, 14-7, a "com
promise" proposal from Armed Services Committee
Chairman John Tower (R-Tex.), for an 8 percent in
crease now but more later that would have given Rea
gan roughly what he wanted over a longer period of
time.
The votes added up to Reagan's second major de
feat on defense spending this year, following adop
tion of a budget last month by the Democratic-con
trolled House that would curtail his military buildup
even more severely and, in addition, provide $30
billion in new taxes and $33 billion in social welfare
spending that the administration does not want.
MX called indefensible
Washington — President Reagan's arms advisers
now are saying there is no practical way to protect the
MX missiletothe point of closingthe"windowof vul
nerability" Reagan campaigned against so vigorously
in 1980, it was learned yesterday.
Senators said this shift in position came through
loud and clear as they were briefed on the recom
mendations to be made Monday by Reagan's special
advisory commission on the MX.
It will urge the deployment of 100 MX missilesin ex
isting Minuteman silos in Wyoming, starting in 1987,
plus a crash program to build a new smaller, mobile
and less vulnerable missile by 1991.
Retired Gen. Brent Scowcroft, chairman, and other
members of the panel briefing the senators said they
had concluded that there is no practical way to
harden existing Minuteman silos so they would make
the MX invulnerable, that the MX will be too big and
heavy to be mobile and that the Minuteman silos are
spaced too far apart to make an antiballistic missile
defense feasible.
Astronauts take space walk
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — Tied to 50-foot leashes, two
astronauts took the first U.S. space walk in nearly a
decade yesterday, perfecting ways for shuttle crews to
fix ailing satellites in years to come.
Against the dramatic backdrop of the cloud-mot
tled Earth turning below, astronauts Story Musgrave
and Don Peterson turned an energetic work day into
a joyous and acrobatic outing.
After 3 hours and 50 minutes in Challenger's open
cargo bay, Musgrave took one last look over the side
at the Hawaiian Islands befow.
"It's pretty cloudy over the islands right here," he
said when Mission Control asked if he could see the
volcano Kilauea which has been erupting in recent
weeks.
Musgrave and Peterson tested their $2.1 million
space suits and their own ability to work in the hostile
environment of open space. They practiced with
tools, pretended to free a stuck satellite, maneuvered
a winch with a 100-pound load and carried a 50-
pound object across the cargo bay.
CIA rebuked on Nicaragua
Washington — The chairman of the House In
telligence oversight subcommittee, just retuned from
a trip to Central America, said yesterday that the Rea
gan administration is violating the congressional ban
against supporting attempts to overthrow the leftist
government of Nicaragua.
His statement is the most authoritative con
gressional assertion to date that the two-year-old cov
ert CIA operation has broken the legal bounds im
posed by Congress.
Rep. Wyche Fowler (D-Ga.), told a news con
ference that "under the best of circumstances" the
congressional ban, known as the Boland amendment,
"is not being fully adhered to."
The language in the Boland amendment was first
passed in secret by a House-Senate budget con
ference last August and then sponsored publicly by
Boland during the December budget resolution de
bate. It forbids the administration from taking any ac
tion "for the purpose of overthrowing the govern
ment of Nicaragua or provoking a military exchange
between Nicaragua and Honduras."
Fowler said that he would introduce legislation
next week to set statutory standards for covert actions

to make sure that such "extraordinary" activities are
essential to national security; that potential benefits
outweigh risks, and that covert objectives are consis
tent with "publicly avowed foreign policy."
The legislation also would give the House and Sen
ate Intelligence oversight committees veto power "to
disapprove such operations."
Watt bends on Beach Boys
Washington — Interior Secretary James Watt hur
riedly replaced the capital's welcome mat for the
Beach Boys yesterday after being set straight by
one of their favorite "California Girls." And when
Nancy Reagan got done, the president himself put a
heavy foot to him.
Reagan, it seems, is a fan of the surfin' sound as
much as his wife. So after learning that Watt had
banned the Beach Boys and other rock groups from
the capital's July 4 celebration, he handed the Interior
Secretary a stark reminder of what not to do any
more: a plaster of paris foot with a hole in it.
Watt, who earlier complained that "hard rock" mu
sic had attracted the "wrong element" to the tradi
tional fireworks extravaganza on the Mall, pro
claimed himself a likely fan of the Beach Boys, whose
performances had drawn hundreds of thousands of
people in years past.
"The president is a friend of the Beach Boys and he
likes them, and I'm sure when I get to meet them I'll
like them," Watt said, standing in a drizzling rain after
emerging from the White House.
Changes proposed for senate
Washington — A Senate-created committee has
proposed fundamental changes in the structure and
procedures of that body, known to admirers as the
world's greatest deliberative forum and to frustrated
critics as a cave of the winds.
The recommendations are certain to be con
troversial — Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.), said they will "scare some people to death" —
but the authors say they also would increase Senate
effectiveness greatly.
The proposals are considerable. They include:
— Creating a powerful new position: permanent
presiding officer of the Senate.
— Establishing an agreed-upon annual Senate
agenda for each legislative week with provisions mak
ing it harder to deviate from that agenda.
— Putting restraints on individual senators' rights to
delay proceedings by such devices as quorum calls
and insisting on record votes and the right to place
holds on items awaiting consideration on the floor.
There also would be new restrictions on debate that
might shorten, if not eliminate, filibusters.
— Restructuring the present congressional budget
process, putting it on a two-year cycle and abolishing
the system of reconciliation under which budget res
olutions are made binding.
— Consolidating the various Senate committees,
limiting the number of committee assignments for
each senator and altering the role and composition of
subcommittees drastically.
FDA OKs contraceptive sponge
Washington —The Food and Drug Administration
has approved the marketing of a contraceptive
sponge, a new birth control device for women that
can be purchased without a prescription and that al
lows more "sexual spontaneity" than do some other
products, company officials said.
The manufacturer, VLI Corp. of Costa Mesa, Calif,
said that the one-size-fits-all, disposable
polyurethane sponge, soaked with a commonly used
sperm-killing chemical, is expected to be available
nationwide in early fall. Under the name "Today," the
sponges will be sold for about $1 each.
"The testing of the sponge in nearly 1600 women
since 1979 has shown it to be about 85 percent effec
tive in preventing pregnancy. This effectiveness rate is
in the same range as other vaginal contraceptives
such as the diaphragm or spermicide alone," said FDA
official Faye Peterson.
Diaphragms, however, require fitting in a physi
cian's office, and non-prescription products such as
foams and gels require insertion immediately before
intercourse. The new sponge would provide protec
tion up to 24 hours after insertion.
Stocks gain; volume dips
Retailing issues were the standout performers as the
stock market staged a modest rally yesterday, ending

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 29.80

China cuts cultural ties with U.S.
Peking — China severed all sports and official cul
tural exchanges yesterday with the United States until
the end of this year in retaliation for the Reagan ad
ministration's decision to grant political asylum to
Chinese tennis star Hu Na.
The move, coming four days after Hu's request for
asylum wasapproved, cancels Chinese planstopartic
ipate in 10 international sporting events to be held in
the United States. It also revokes a governmental
agreement to exchange films, art shows and concerts
but stops short of halting the numerous cultural af
fairs arranged unofficially in both nations.
Explaining the reprisal, Chinese officials said grant
ing Hu political refuge was "extremely unfriendly" to
China and contradicted the "essential principle' of

promoting wider people-to-people contacts.
Foreign analysts said that while the reprisal cuts

committee approved a 5 percent increase in military
spending authority after accounting for inflation.
Reagan had requested a 10 percent after-inflation
increase for the Pentagon.
That proposal was rejected 19-2 in the first vote of
the day, which Democrats demanded to show the
degree of opposition to the president's position.
The committee then rejected, 14-7, a "com
promise" proposal from Armed Services Committee
Chairman John Tower (R-Tex.), for an 8 percent in
crease now but more later that would have given Rea
gan roughly what he wanted over a longer period of
time.
The votes added up to Reagan's second major de
feat on defense spending this year, following adop
tion of a budget last month by the Democratic-con
trolled House that would curtail his military buildup
even more severely and, in addition, provide $30
billion in new taxes and $33 billion in social welfare
spending that the administration does not want.
MX called indefensible
Washington — President Reagan's arms advisers
now are saying there is no practical way to protect the
MX missiletothe point of closingthe"windowof vul
nerability" Reagan campaigned against so vigorously
in 1980, it was learned yesterday.
Senators said this shift in position came through
loud and clear as they were briefed on the recom
mendations to be made Monday by Reagan's special
advisory commission on the MX.
It will urge the deployment of 100 MX missilesin ex
isting Minuteman silos in Wyoming, starting in 1987,
plus a crash program to build a new smaller, mobile
and less vulnerable missile by 1991.
Retired Gen. Brent Scowcroft, chairman, and other
members of the panel briefing the senators said they
had concluded that there is no practical way to
harden existing Minuteman silos so they would make
the MX invulnerable, that the MX will be too big and
heavy to be mobile and that the Minuteman silos are
spaced too far apart to make an antiballistic missile
defense feasible.
Astronauts take space walk
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — Tied to 50-foot leashes, two
astronauts took the first U.S. space walk in nearly a
decade yesterday, perfecting ways for shuttle crews to
fix ailing satellites in years to come.
Against the dramatic backdrop of the cloud-mot
tled Earth turning below, astronauts Story Musgrave
and Don Peterson turned an energetic work day into
a joyous and acrobatic outing.
After 3 hours and 50 minutes in Challenger's open
cargo bay, Musgrave took one last look over the side
at the Hawaiian Islands befow.
"It's pretty cloudy over the islands right here," he
said when Mission Control asked if he could see the
volcano Kilauea which has been erupting in recent
weeks.
Musgrave and Peterson tested their $2.1 million
space suits and their own ability to work in the hostile
environment of open space. They practiced with
tools, pretended to free a stuck satellite, maneuvered
a winch with a 100-pound load and carried a 50-
pound object across the cargo bay.
CIA rebuked on Nicaragua
Washington — The chairman of the House In
telligence oversight subcommittee, just retuned from
a trip to Central America, said yesterday that the Rea
gan administration is violating the congressional ban
against supporting attempts to overthrow the leftist
government of Nicaragua.
His statement is the most authoritative con
gressional assertion to date that the two-year-old cov
ert CIA operation has broken the legal bounds im
posed by Congress.
Rep. Wyche Fowler (D-Ga.), told a news con
ference that "under the best of circumstances" the
congressional ban, known as the Boland amendment,
"is not being fully adhered to."
The language in the Boland amendment was first
passed in secret by a House-Senate budget con
ference last August and then sponsored publicly by
Boland during the December budget resolution de
bate. It forbids the administration from taking any ac
tion "for the purpose of overthrowing the govern
ment of Nicaragua or provoking a military exchange
between Nicaragua and Honduras."
Fowler said that he would introduce legislation
next week to set statutory standards for covert actions

to make sure that such "extraordinary" activities are
essential to national security; that potential benefits
outweigh risks, and that covert objectives are consis
tent with "publicly avowed foreign policy."
The legislation also would give the House and Sen
ate Intelligence oversight committees veto power "to
disapprove such operations."
Watt bends on Beach Boys
Washington — Interior Secretary James Watt hur
riedly replaced the capital's welcome mat for the
Beach Boys yesterday after being set straight by
one of their favorite "California Girls." And when
Nancy Reagan got done, the president himself put a
heavy foot to him.
Reagan, it seems, is a fan of the surfin' sound as
much as his wife. So after learning that Watt had
banned the Beach Boys and other rock groups from
the capital's July 4 celebration, he handed the Interior
Secretary a stark reminder of what not to do any
more: a plaster of paris foot with a hole in it.
Watt, who earlier complained that "hard rock" mu
sic had attracted the "wrong element" to the tradi
tional fireworks extravaganza on the Mall, pro
claimed himself a likely fan of the Beach Boys, whose
performances had drawn hundreds of thousands of
people in years past.
"The president is a friend of the Beach Boys and he
likes them, and I'm sure when I get to meet them I'll
like them," Watt said, standing in a drizzling rain after
emerging from the White House.
Changes proposed for senate
Washington — A Senate-created committee has
proposed fundamental changes in the structure and
procedures of that body, known to admirers as the
world's greatest deliberative forum and to frustrated
critics as a cave of the winds.
The recommendations are certain to be con
troversial — Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.), said they will "scare some people to death" —
but the authors say they also would increase Senate
effectiveness greatly.
The proposals are considerable. They include:
— Creating a powerful new position: permanent
presiding officer of the Senate.
— Establishing an agreed-upon annual Senate
agenda for each legislative week with provisions mak
ing it harder to deviate from that agenda.
— Putting restraints on individual senators' rights to
delay proceedings by such devices as quorum calls
and insisting on record votes and the right to place
holds on items awaiting consideration on the floor.
There also would be new restrictions on debate that
might shorten, if not eliminate, filibusters.
— Restructuring the present congressional budget
process, putting it on a two-year cycle and abolishing
the system of reconciliation under which budget res
olutions are made binding.
— Consolidating the various Senate committees,
limiting the number of committee assignments for
each senator and altering the role and composition of
subcommittees drastically.
FDA OKs contraceptive sponge
Washington —The Food and Drug Administration
has approved the marketing of a contraceptive
sponge, a new birth control device for women that
can be purchased without a prescription and that al
lows more "sexual spontaneity" than do some other
products, company officials said.
The manufacturer, VLI Corp. of Costa Mesa, Calif,
said that the one-size-fits-all, disposable
polyurethane sponge, soaked with a commonly used
sperm-killing chemical, is expected to be available
nationwide in early fall. Under the name "Today," the
sponges will be sold for about $1 each.
"The testing of the sponge in nearly 1600 women
since 1979 has shown it to be about 85 percent effec
tive in preventing pregnancy. This effectiveness rate is
in the same range as other vaginal contraceptives
such as the diaphragm or spermicide alone," said FDA
official Faye Peterson.
Diaphragms, however, require fitting in a physi
cian's office, and non-prescription products such as
foams and gels require insertion immediately before
intercourse. The new sponge would provide protec
tion up to 24 hours after insertion.
Stocks gain; volume dips
Retailing issues were the standout performers as the
stock market staged a modest rally yesterday, ending
a four-session decline.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 29.80
points in the last four trading days, recovered 4.16 to
1117.65.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled
69.48 million shares, against 77.14 million in the pre
vious sessio - .

China cuts cultural ties with U.S.
Peking — China severed all sports and official cul
tural exchanges yesterday with the United States until
the end of this year in retaliation for the Reagan ad
ministration's decision to grant political asylum to
Chinese tennis star Hu Na.
The move, coming four days after Hu's request for
asylum wasapproved, cancels Chinese planstopartic
ipate in 10 international sporting events to be held in
the United States. It also revokes a governmental
agreement to exchange films, art shows and concerts
but stops short of halting the numerous cultural af
fairs arranged unofficially in both nations.
Explaining the reprisal, Chinese officials said grant
ing Hu political refuge was "extremely unfriendly" to
China and contradicted the "essential principle' of

promoting wider people-to-people contacts.
Foreign analysts said that while the reprisal cuts
away the least substantive aspects of ties between the
two countries, it signifies a new adversarial quality in
Sino-American relations and shows the limits of co
operation between two societies with such starkly dif
ferent concepts of individual freedom.
Diplomats said the issue has driven a once-budding
strategic partnership to its lowest ebb since Washing
ton and Peking normalized relations in 1979. With
persistent friction over U.S. arms sales to the rival
Taiwanese and with a textile dispute sharply aggravat
ing trade relations, Peking is said to be showing signs
of distancing itself from the United States as it moves
to reduce tensions with the Soviet Union,
Senate halves defense increase
Washington — The Republican-controlled Senate
Budget Committee rebelled against President Reagan
yesterday and voted 17-4 to cut his military buildup
program for the next fiscal year by roughly half.
With most Republicans joining all Democratic
members in what committee Chairman Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.), described acerbically asa "repri
mand to the people who advise" the president, the
committee approved a 5 percent increase in military
spending authority after accounting for inflation.
