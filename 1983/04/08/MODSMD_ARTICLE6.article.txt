# Paralyzed student sues University
## 
### JERRY BALL 
A senior who was injured during
dormitory horseplay last year is suing
the University for negligence, ac
cording to University counsel Rod
ney Johnson.
Senior Mike Lung broke his spine
and was paralyzed below the waist in
an accident in Toyon Hall last April
10. His arms were partially paralyzed
as well.
According to Toyon Resident Fel
low Gregson Davis, Lung and several
other Toyon residents were taking
turns jumping onto a fast-rolling
chair. A rope attached to the bottom
of the chair would jerk the chair out
re a "n e'a *d"*s n'o r r 'staTrWay' Yfie'ricJer
would fly up to 15 feet before landing
on cushions at the bottom of the
stairway, he said.
Lung accidentally pushed the
cushions out of his way when he
landed and injured his spinal cord.
Lung said he filed the complaint in
Santa Clara Superior Court because a
Stanford police officer was present
during the horseplay and never cau
tioned the students that the activity
was dangerous.
Lung said the officer watched the
students for about 10 minutes. "He
encouraged us, saying, 'It looks like
fun.' "
Johnson said that he would "rather
not comment on the facts of the case
because it's in litigation."
"All I can say at this point is that the
University has looked into it, and we
don't see how we're responsible in
any way," he said.
Lung says that he is not at all bitter
toward the University. "The Univer
sity has been really good about help
ing me to fit in again this year," he
said.
The University provides Lung with
wheelchair services, and placed him
in Storey House which has facilities
for the handicapped. In addition, he
said the University pays his room and
board costs.
Lung said that he is quite happy

with the way the University has han
dled his case so far, but he needs to
make sure that he will continue to
have the financial support his condi
tion requires. "The suit is strictly be
tween insurance companies," he
said.
Lung said that his chances of re
covery "are about a trillion to one."
Stanford has previously awarded
substantial amounts of money to ac
cident victims. In October, the Uni
versity settled out of court with
graduate student William Brodie
Lockard, a former member of the
gvmnastic team.
Lockard was practicing on campus

contending that the University was
guilty of "a lack of due care in con
structing the pit" where he fell.
The lawyers refused to disclose the
actual amount that Lockard was
awarded.
Last year the University also pro
vided a $140,000 out of court case
settlement to Bill Buchanan for in
juries sustained when his hand went
through a glass door in November,
1979. Bu< hanan's suit claimed that
the University was negligent in main
taining the safety har, which was
loose.
