# Bats hang out in Meyer Library

### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Gotham City's Bruce Wayne
and Dick Grayson may have had a
bat-cave, a hat-mobile and a bat
phone, but chances are they
never had a bat-library.
Stanford students are more for
tunate.
Dozens of bats call Meyer Li
brary home every year from just
before Christmas until late spring.
"Bats, like undergraduates,
seem to prefer the library during
the rainy winter months. I think
they hang out at Lake lag in the
spring," said David Swaddel,
Meyer's circulation supervisor.
No one seems to know how
many of the flying creatures live in
the undergraduate library, but
Meyer secretary Kathy Fehrn said,
"It |ust seems like a lot."
Swaddel said students see "at
least half a dozen bats per day,
and that's only a slight exaggera
tion,"
Students have reported seeing
bats "hanging out" in virtually all
parts of Meyer, but especially on
the fourth floor and in the cracks
above the elevators.
"They used to love to hang up
side down by the top of the center
well. In fact, that used to be a

great place to pick them off. We
could plan to come in at 8 a.m.
and see one or two. But since
we've glassed in the well that
doesn't seem to be the place they
like to congregate," Fehrn said.
Most students are accustomed
enough to the bats that they are
not surprised when they see one
fly by. But infrequent library pa
trons are usually a bit shocked.
"The bats do dive upon people
sometimes if they've been dis
turbed and some people don't re
ally like that. But that's mostly

people who don't use the library
very much because they don't
know the bats are here. But we're
used to it. For us it's just, 'Oh god,
there's another bat.' But I guess
that I'd be a little upset too if I sa»\
one for the first time," Febm said.
Assoc. Biology Prof. Craig Hel
ler said that bats suffer from bad
publicity and that library patrons
have little to worry about.

vampires. I don't think you need
to be afraid that they're going to
fly in your hair. There are a lot of
myths about bats, and it's just a bit
of nonsense. In general, they're
not dangerous unless they're in
fected with a disease like rabies,
and I don't think we have any
rabies on the Peninsula right
now." Heller said.
Swaddel agreed. "Bats gener
ally don't try to attack things big

ger than themselves, unlike a lot
of people," he said.
Heller said that bats are actually
our friends because they eat in
sects and therefore may be keep
ing Meyer free of other pests.
But the official University policy
on bats is that they are an an
noyance and should be removed.
If library staff members find bats
on the floor in Meyer, they cover
them with overturned wastebas
kets until crews from the Rose Ex
terminator Company arrive to
take the bats away.

"It seems as if we've been mak
ing daily call to the Rose man, but
I'm sure it can't be that often,"
Fehrn said. "But we've never
matched the record from last Jan
uary when the Rose man took out
10 bats in one day."
What the Rose exterminator
does with the bats is a bit of a
secret. Repeated calls to the Rose
Exterminator company provided
no help, and University Facility
Engineer Lee Morgan told the
Daily that the firm is under con
tract to his department and there

fore "not at liberty to talk to you."
Morgan did say, however, that
most of the bats the exterminators
remove are "already deceased,"
and that the live bats are taken to
"a wooded area somewhere near
lasper Ridge."
Some students are worried
about the fate of the Meyer bats.
Freshman David Lippeat tried to
rescue a grounded one Tuesday
night.
"I figured there were these guys
that walk around in the library:
exterminators, trying to get the li

brary rid of the bats. I wanted to
try do something to save the bats.
I don't find them repulsive like a
lot of people do," Lippeat ex
plained.
"I found this bat on the ground
and he was in pretty bad shape.
He was obviously hurt and maybe
disoriented. We thought he might
have fallen from the roof. I took
him outside and hung him on a
bush in the same position I found
him in the library. I haven't gone
back to check on him yet, but I
probahly will," Lippeat said.

Many people claim feelings of
affection toward the bats.
"They're sort of library pets, like
library mascots," Swaddel said.
But not all students are so wil
ling to call a bat their buddy.
Senior Les Firestein found a bat
on the fourth floor Tuesday night
as he looked for his missing keys.
"It's a very smart bat. . . He
hangs out by the French litera
ture, and I hate French literature. I
think he's an expert on Voltaire,"
Firestein said.

Freshman David Lippeat tried to
rescue a grounded one Tuesday
night.
"I figured there were these guys
that walk around in the library:
exterminators, trying to get the li

brary rid of the bats. I wanted to
try do something to save the bats.
I don't find them repulsive like a
lot of people do," Lippeat ex
plained.
"I found this bat on the ground
and he was in pretty bad shape.
He was obviously hurt and maybe
disoriented. We thought he might
have fallen from the roof. I took
him outside and hung him on a
bush in the same position I found
him in the library. I haven't gone
back to check on him yet, but I
probahly will," Lippeat said.

Many people claim feelings of
affection toward the bats.
"They're sort of library pets, like
library mascots," Swaddel said.
But not all students are so wil
ling to call a bat their buddy.
Senior Les Firestein found a bat
on the fourth floor Tuesday night
as he looked for his missing keys.
"It's a very smart bat. . . He
hangs out by the French litera
ture, and I hate French literature. I
think he's an expert on Voltaire,"
Firestein said.
Gotham City's Bruce Wayne
and Dick Grayson may have had a
bat-cave, a hat-mobile and a bat
phone, but chances are they
never had a bat-library.
Stanford students are more for
tunate.
Dozens of bats call Meyer Li
brary home every year from just
before Christmas until late spring.
"Bats, like undergraduates,
seem to prefer the library during
the rainy winter months. I think
they hang out at Lake lag in the
spring," said David Swaddel,
Meyer's circulation supervisor.
No one seems to know how
many of the flying creatures live in
the undergraduate library, but
Meyer secretary Kathy Fehrn said,
"It |ust seems like a lot."
Swaddel said students see "at
least half a dozen bats per day,
and that's only a slight exaggera
tion,"
Students have reported seeing
bats "hanging out" in virtually all
parts of Meyer, but especially on
the fourth floor and in the cracks
above the elevators.
"They used to love to hang up
side down by the top of the center
well. In fact, that used to be a

great place to pick them off. We
could plan to come in at 8 a.m.
and see one or two. But since
we've glassed in the well that
doesn't seem to be the place they
like to congregate," Fehrn said.
Most students are accustomed
enough to the bats that they are
not surprised when they see one
fly by. But infrequent library pa
trons are usually a bit shocked.
"The bats do dive upon people
sometimes if they've been dis
turbed and some people don't re
ally like that. But that's mostly

people who don't use the library
very much because they don't
know the bats are here. But we're
used to it. For us it's just, 'Oh god,
there's another bat.' But I guess
that I'd be a little upset too if I sa»\
one for the first time," Febm said.
Assoc. Biology Prof. Craig Hel
ler said that bats suffer from bad
publicity and that library patrons
have little to worry about.

vampires. I don't think you need
to be afraid that they're going to
fly in your hair. There are a lot of
myths about bats, and it's just a bit
of nonsense. In general, they're
not dangerous unless they're in
fected with a disease like rabies,
and I don't think we have any
rabies on the Peninsula right
now." Heller said.
Swaddel agreed. "Bats gener
ally don't try to attack things big

ger than themselves, unlike a lot
of people," he said.
Heller said that bats are actually
our friends because they eat in
sects and therefore may be keep
ing Meyer free of other pests.
But the official University policy
on bats is that they are an an
noyance and should be removed.
If library staff members find bats
on the floor in Meyer, they cover
them with overturned wastebas
kets until crews from the Rose Ex
terminator Company arrive to
take the bats away.

"It seems as if we've been mak
ing daily call to the Rose man, but
I'm sure it can't be that often,"
Fehrn said. "But we've never
matched the record from last Jan
uary when the Rose man took out
10 bats in one day."
What the Rose exterminator
does with the bats is a bit of a
secret. Repeated calls to the Rose
Exterminator company provided
no help, and University Facility
Engineer Lee Morgan told the
Daily that the firm is under con
tract to his department and there

fore "not at liberty to talk to you."
Morgan did say, however, that
most of the bats the exterminators
remove are "already deceased,"
and that the live bats are taken to
"a wooded area somewhere near
lasper Ridge."
