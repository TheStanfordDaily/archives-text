# Bats hang out in Meyer Library

Gotham City's Bruce Wayne
and Dick Grayson may have had a
bat-cave, a hat-mobile and a bat
phone, but chances are they
never had a bat-library.
Stanford students are more for
tunate.
Dozens of bats call Meyer Li
brary home every year from just
before Christmas until late spring.
"Bats, like undergraduates,
seem to prefer the library during
the rainy winter months. I think
they hang out at Lake lag in the
spring," said David Swaddel,
Meyer's circulation supervisor.
No one seems to know how
many of the flying creatures live in
the undergraduate library, but
Meyer secretary Kathy Fehrn said,
"It |ust seems like a lot."
Swaddel said students see "at
least half a dozen bats per day,
and that's only a slight exaggera
tion,"
Students have reported seeing
bats "hanging out" in virtually all
parts of Meyer, but especially on
the fourth floor and in the cracks
above the elevators.
"They used to love to hang up
side down by the top of the center
well. In fact, that used to be a

great place to pick them off. We
could plan to come in at 8 a.m.
and see one or two. But since
we've glassed in the well that
doesn't seem to be the place they
like to congregate," Fehrn said.
Most students are accustomed
enough to the bats that they are
not surprised when they see one
fly by. But infrequent library pa
trons are usually a bit shocked.
"The bats do dive upon people
sometimes if they've been dis
turbed and some people don't re
ally like that. But that's mostly

people who don't use the library
very much because they don't
know the bats are here. But we're
used to it. For us it's just, 'Oh god,
there's another bat.' But I guess
that I'd be a little upset too if I saÂ»\
one for the first time," Febm said.
Assoc. Biology Prof. Craig Hel
ler said that bats suffer from bad
publicity and that library patrons
have little to worry about.
