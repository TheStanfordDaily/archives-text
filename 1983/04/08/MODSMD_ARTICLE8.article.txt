## Applications for University jobs on rise 
### LESLIE WEEDEN 
Reflecting the double-digit unem
ployment rate around the country,
the University and the Hospital are
receiving a significantly higher
number of applications for a dwin
dling number of available jobs, ac
cording to employment managers
here.
"In general, the applicant load has
gone up over the past six months,"
said Keith Copeland, assistant man
ager of Employment for the Univer
sity. "The trend experienced by most
businesses in the country has been
similar here."
Copeland, whose department
handles all staff jobs at the Univer
sity, excluding faculty, said that

applicant traffic increased 15 percent
in 1982 over that of 1981, while the
number of jobs open on a regular
basis has been lower for the past
year.
One major reason for the smaller
number of available jobs, according
to Copeland, is that job turnover has
been slower.
"People haven't been willing to
leave out of fear that they won't be
able to find another job," he said.
Another reason is that the Univer
sity is in "a budget-cutting and con
solidation mode," Copeland said.
However, he emphasized that
budget cuts are not the primary
cause of layoffs. Most layoffs occur
when departments reorganize in

order to be more efficient, he said.
According to a department report
the number of employees on layoff
status is actually less than the
number throughout almost all of
1982. Concerning those laid off,
Copeland said, "We take active steps
to find another job for them in the
University." However, he said that
the success rate depends on how
easily transferable the job is.
Renee Wald, manager of Employ
ment and Recruiting for Stanford
Hospital, said, "Our applicant vol
ume increased dramatically last fall.
An upward surge occurred when the
auto industry went through its layoffs
. . . now that it is close to summer
we've had an influx of students ap
plying for summer jobs. Also, a lot of
secretaries are applying tor positions
now due to layoffs in the electronics
industry."
However, there are fewer jobs
available at the Hospital, according to
Wald, also due to slower turnover,
but largely because the number of
patients is lower than had been proj
ected. The patient census has de
clined, Wald said, because people
who have lost their jobs have also
lost their medical insurance.
Wald strongly emphasized that the
Hospital is not in a layoff mode. Its
policy has always been to cut back in
programs rather than people, she
said.
Wald said that the hospital has im
plemented cost containment meas
ures such as vacancy factor control
which was put into effect last Sep
tember. This requires that vacated
jobs be left open for 30 days before
being filled. The program has been
very successful, according to Wald,
because it protects existing jobs and
saves money.

Wald said that last January guide
lines for alternatives to staffing re
ductions were issued to hospital ad
ministrators. These alternatives in
cluded reductions in staff hours to
respond to the decline in activity and
financial need. Since then, Wald
said, some departments have
changed to a seven-hour day in order
to avoid layoffs.
Wald's department is responsible
tor hiring all staff except Registered
Nurses.
kathryn Stucki, a recruiter in the
Nurse Recruiting Department said,
"We're still as active as we have been
in the past . . . we have as many
nurses working but we're not hiring
as many."
Stucki said that one nursing unit
has been closed down since last fall.
She also attributed the decline in
available jobs to slow turnover and
the decline in the number of pa
tients.
Copeland said that he did not an
ticipate a need to implement similar
cost containment measures among
University staff because the Univer
sity is having no trouble filling its
classrooms.
He is optimistic about a change in
the current trend. "I don't expect to
see hiring get any worse," he said.
"I've been predicting that in late
spring and early summer things will
pick up."
However, he said that the situation
is complex because despite the
number of applications that his de
partment receives, his staff still
spends a lot of time and money seek
ing out qualified people for jobs.
"Often the applications just don't
meet the requirements for high level
management and technical posi
tions."

|OB HOPEFULS: The nationwide unemployment crunch is felt at Stan
ford as increasing numbers of applicants face a decline in available
positions on campus.
Reflecting the double-digit unem
ployment rate around the country,
the University and the Hospital are
receiving a significantly higher
number of applications for a dwin
dling number of available jobs, ac
cording to employment managers
here.
"In general, the applicant load has
gone up over the past six months,"
said Keith Copeland, assistant man
ager of Employment for the Univer
sity. "The trend experienced by most
businesses in the country has been
similar here."
Copeland, whose department
handles all staff jobs at the Univer
sity, excluding faculty, said that

applicant traffic increased 15 percent
in 1982 over that of 1981, while the
number of jobs open on a regular
basis has been lower for the past
year.
One major reason for the smaller
number of available jobs, according
to Copeland, is that job turnover has
been slower.
"People haven't been willing to
leave out of fear that they won't be
able to find another job," he said.
Another reason is that the Univer
sity is in "a budget-cutting and con
solidation mode," Copeland said.
However, he emphasized that
budget cuts are not the primary
cause of layoffs. Most layoffs occur
when departments reorganize in

order to be more efficient, he said.
According to a department report
the number of employees on layoff
status is actually less than the
number throughout almost all of
1982. Concerning those laid off,
Copeland said, "We take active steps
to find another job for them in the
University." However, he said that
the success rate depends on how
easily transferable the job is.
Renee Wald, manager of Employ
ment and Recruiting for Stanford
Hospital, said, "Our applicant vol
ume increased dramatically last fall.
An upward surge occurred when the
auto industry went through its layoffs
. . . now that it is close to summer
we've had an influx of students ap
plying for summer jobs. Also, a lot of
secretaries are applying tor positions
now due to layoffs in the electronics
industry."
However, there are fewer jobs
available at the Hospital, according to
Wald, also due to slower turnover,
but largely because the number of
patients is lower than had been proj
ected. The patient census has de
clined, Wald said, because people
who have lost their jobs have also
lost their medical insurance.
Wald strongly emphasized that the
Hospital is not in a layoff mode. Its
policy has always been to cut back in
programs rather than people, she
said.
Wald said that the hospital has im
plemented cost containment meas
ures such as vacancy factor control
which was put into effect last Sep
tember. This requires that vacated
jobs be left open for 30 days before
being filled. The program has been
very successful, according to Wald,
because it protects existing jobs and
saves money.

Wald said that last January guide
lines for alternatives to staffing re
ductions were issued to hospital ad
ministrators. These alternatives in
cluded reductions in staff hours to
respond to the decline in activity and
financial need. Since then, Wald
said, some departments have
changed to a seven-hour day in order
to avoid layoffs.
Wald's department is responsible
tor hiring all staff except Registered
Nurses.
kathryn Stucki, a recruiter in the
Nurse Recruiting Department said,
"We're still as active as we have been
in the past . . . we have as many
nurses working but we're not hiring
as many."
Stucki said that one nursing unit
has been closed down since last fall.
She also attributed the decline in
available jobs to slow turnover and
the decline in the number of pa
tients.
Copeland said that he did not an
ticipate a need to implement similar
cost containment measures among
University staff because the Univer
sity is having no trouble filling its
classrooms.
He is optimistic about a change in
the current trend. "I don't expect to
see hiring get any worse," he said.
"I've been predicting that in late
spring and early summer things will
pick up."
However, he said that the situation
is complex because despite the
number of applications that his de
partment receives, his staff still
spends a lot of time and money seek
ing out qualified people for jobs.
"Often the applications just don't
meet the requirements for high level
management and technical posi
tions."
