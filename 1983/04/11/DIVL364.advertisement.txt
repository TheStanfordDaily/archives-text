mistakes over and over, why we forget so much. It wi II also consider the steps that
led to the human mind and our current social organization: how walking led to the
human adaptation; how biology and culture coevolve; how biological and
"metabiological evolution" can happen. We will investigate how society affects
us: how health is dependent on many psychosocial factors; research that shows
that friends/4/fE good medicine, and a consideration of the social pathology that
