# Council of Presidents
## 
### 
KSVP slate
The KSVP slate, consisting of Karol Watson,
Su Uhland, Vinnie Freda and Peter Spivack, is
the only responsible, qualified and experienced
group running for Council of Presidents.
The four members have a good knowledge of
the University and realistic goals. They appear
to have a genuine commitment to the job.
The Council is an important group which re
quires responsible individuals. Peter Spivack
served as an ASSU senator this year. Vinnie
Freda is business manager of the Chaparral and

head of the Concert Network. Karol Watson is
active in black and pre-medical organizations.
And Su Uhland is chair of the ASSU Nomina
tions Commission and general manager of La
Pizzeria.
Among their stands: They favor more empha
sis on graduate housing, on teaching quality in
the tenure process and on enforcing Dead
Week, and they oppose racial quotas for theme
houses and University subsidy of COP salaries.
Slate members say they will improve the AS
SU's image and visibility and claim they "will act
like students, not University administrators."
