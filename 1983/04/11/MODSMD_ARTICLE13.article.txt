# Constitutional amendment-Yes
## 
### 
This amendment seeks to rectify the current
iniquity in the graduate senate districts. Under
the present system, undergraduates can vote
for 10 senators while graduates can only vote for
one. This amendment would change the ASSU
Constitution by giving graduates the same
number of votes as there are graduate senators
in their district. As a result, graduate students in
the School of Humanities and Sciences would

be able to vote for three senators, since there
are three senators in that district.
The amendment would give graduates a more
equitable voice in the senate, would eliminate a
current iniquity in the voting process, yet would
continue the senate districting system. For all of
these reasons we urge a yes vote on the
amendment.
