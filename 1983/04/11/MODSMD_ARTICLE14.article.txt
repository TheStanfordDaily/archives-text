# Ballot measure-Yes
## 
### 
This ballot measure is an attempt to clarify
certain procedures of the Student Conduct
I egislative Council (SCLC) and the Stanford Jud
icial Council (SJC), two bodies which are con
cerned with honor code policy on campus.
The measure is primarily an attempt to give
students a greater voice in the student conduct
process here while at the same time providing
for increased clarification of faculty respon

sibilities under the Honor Code. It is designed
so that students would not be excluded from
such decisions as the Mosher expulsion (in
which no students had a say) or the kicking of
the Zeta Psi fraternity off campus (which was an
administrative action by the Office of Residen
tial Education) and would increase student par
ticipation in a process which affects each one of
them. We recommend a yes vote on this meas
ure.
