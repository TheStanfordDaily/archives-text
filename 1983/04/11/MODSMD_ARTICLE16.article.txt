# Fee assessments
## 
### 
ASSU Guest Prof Bureau - Yes
Newly revived this year, the GPB is seeking
out qualified guest professors to teach here.
Although much controversy surrounded its de
cisions this year, the board attempts to bring
qualified teachers here who might not other
wise come here. Although its request of $58,158
is the largest of any group, the cost per course is
much smaller than regular Stanford courses. For
all these reasons we urge a yes vote for the GPB.
ASSU Legal Counseling - Yes
The Legal Counseling office has functioned
since 1973 as an effective aid to students need
ing legal help. For the services it will render, the
$43,915 is not excessive and is wisely spent. The
services are open to all students who do not ask
for a refund and, according to the office, 8 per
cent of the student body uses it each year. We
recommend a yes vote for this service.
ASSU Lobby Office - No
Although the function it hopes to provide
seems a worthy cause, the large amount of
money requested ($20,151), the possible dupli
cation of University lobbying and the difficulty
of ascertaining student consensus on possible
lobbying issues all serve to recommend a no
vote on this group's fee request.
The Band - Yes
The Band has entertained students, faculty
and alumni foryears, and it wants to continue to
do so next year. It is producing a non-profit
album, is planning a trip to the University of
Illinois and is a public relations asset to the
University. Because its budget indicates a finan
cially healthy organization and the $51,742 re
quested is not excessive given the costs of run
ning such a large organization, we heartily sup
port the Band's request.
Black Student Union - Split
This group, which supports a number of
worthy programs, is seeking all of its 1983-84
funding — $16,165 — from a student fee as
sessment. This year it obtained all of its funding
from other sources, such as the Dean of Student
Affairs Office, Ujaama house and the Program
Board, but it was unable to put on as many
activities as it wishes to next year because of the
amount of time its officers spent soliciting
funds. Because of these strong arguments both
for and against the assessment, the editorial
board was split on the issue and thus is making
no recommendation on the BSU's assessment.
Club Sports - Yes
An efficiently run organization, Club Sports
serves as an umbrella organization for 29 sports
groups. The $36,000 requested represents only
a small part of the total budget. The remaining
funds are provided by the Athletic Depart
ment and raised by the individual clubs them
selves. The money from the fee assessment is
budgeted for essential items. We recommend a
yes vote for this group.
The Daily - Ves
The Stanford Daily keeps the entire commu
nity informed of activities and events, on cam
pus and off, on a daily basis. Putting out a paper
is an expensive proposition, and the requested
$50,000 fee assessment is less than 10 percent of
the money needed to produce the Daily. Be
cause advertisers supply most of our revenue,
you pay less than 3 cents per day for the Daily.
We strongly urge you to vote yes for the Daily.

Graduate Student Association - Yes
The GSA, which is requesting $27,000, exists
to serve the needs of an often forgotten seg
ment of the University community, graduate
students, and it does so effectively. It sponsors a
variety of activities for graduates and works to
provide better understanding between
graduate students in diverse fields. For these
services, it deserves a yes vote.
KZSU - Yes
Despite talk of financial mismanagement and
University control, the "Zoo" deserves and
needs student support, particularly since the
radio station is not allowed to solicit advertisers.
To ensure continued student control of the
student-run radio station, we urge a yes vote.
Rape Education Project - Yes
Rape awareness is an issue of concern to all
students here. When all can walk safely on this
campus, everyone benefits. This group's efforts
to educate the community on rape issues de
serves the support of all students. The $5500
requested is a small price to pay for such a
cause. We recommend a yes vote for this proj
ect.
SEE - No
Despite its claims to the contrary, Stanford for
Environmental Education is a partisan organiza
tion. It seeks not to educate students on
environmental issues but to sway them. For this
reason, in addition to the allocation of its funds
— substantial salaries for its interns and a hefty
newsletter fee — and the large amount of
money requested ($15,000) for such a small or
ganization, we recommend a no vote.
Stanford Progressive Alliance - No
With a large budget SPA seeks to represent a
number of progressive groups on campus and
educate students on current issues. But after
sponsoring such events as a symposium entitled
"U.S. Militarism and the Third World," its claim
to nonpartisanship rings hollow. Finally, the
large amount of money requested ($33,735)
leads us to recommend a no vote for SPA.
SURE - Yes
A group dedicated to eliminating rape, SURE
provides an escort service available to all stu
dents. But it is not available enough of the time
because of the lack of people willing to work as
escorts. Next year SURE wants to pay its em
ployees so that more students will work as es
corts. We see nothing wrong with this attempt
to increase the service, and feel that the amount
of money requested ($12,500) is not too high a
price to pay for the elimination of rape.
Women's Center - Yes
The Women's Center provides a needed ser
vice to the University community, which is al
most half female. This year it organized a film
series, a Take-Back-The-Night rally and a full
moon dance; next year it hopes to do more. It
needs the $16,625 from the fee assessment to
continue its worthy projects. We support the
Women's Center fee request.

funds. Because of these strong arguments both
for and against the assessment, the editorial
board was split on the issue and thus is making
no recommendation on the BSU's assessment.
Club Sports - Yes
An efficiently run organization, Club Sports
serves as an umbrella organization for 29 sports
groups. The $36,000 requested represents only
a small part of the total budget. The remaining
funds are provided by the Athletic Depart
ment and raised by the individual clubs them
selves. The money from the fee assessment is
budgeted for essential items. We recommend a
yes vote for this group.
The Daily - Ves
The Stanford Daily keeps the entire commu
nity informed of activities and events, on cam
pus and off, on a daily basis. Putting out a paper
is an expensive proposition, and the requested
$50,000 fee assessment is less than 10 percent of
the money needed to produce the Daily. Be
cause advertisers supply most of our revenue,
you pay less than 3 cents per day for the Daily.
We strongly urge you to vote yes for the Daily.

Graduate Student Association - Yes
The GSA, which is requesting $27,000, exists
to serve the needs of an often forgotten seg
ment of the University community, graduate
students, and it does so effectively. It sponsors a
variety of activities for graduates and works to
provide better understanding between
graduate students in diverse fields. For these
services, it deserves a yes vote.
KZSU - Yes
Despite talk of financial mismanagement and
University control, the "Zoo" deserves and
needs student support, particularly since the
radio station is not allowed to solicit advertisers.
To ensure continued student control of the
student-run radio station, we urge a yes vote.
Rape Education Project - Yes
Rape awareness is an issue of concern to all
students here. When all can walk safely on this
campus, everyone benefits. This group's efforts
to educate the community on rape issues de
serves the support of all students. The $5500
requested is a small price to pay for such a
cause. We recommend a yes vote for this proj
ect.
SEE - No
Despite its claims to the contrary, Stanford for
Environmental Education is a partisan organiza
tion. It seeks not to educate students on
environmental issues but to sway them. For this
reason, in addition to the allocation of its funds
— substantial salaries for its interns and a hefty
newsletter fee — and the large amount of
money requested ($15,000) for such a small or
ganization, we recommend a no vote.
Stanford Progressive Alliance - No
With a large budget SPA seeks to represent a
number of progressive groups on campus and
educate students on current issues. But after
sponsoring such events as a symposium entitled
"U.S. Militarism and the Third World," its claim
to nonpartisanship rings hollow. Finally, the
large amount of money requested ($33,735)
leads us to recommend a no vote for SPA.
SURE - Yes
A group dedicated to eliminating rape, SURE
provides an escort service available to all stu
dents. But it is not available enough of the time
because of the lack of people willing to work as
escorts. Next year SURE wants to pay its em
ployees so that more students will work as es
corts. We see nothing wrong with this attempt
to increase the service, and feel that the amount
of money requested ($12,500) is not too high a
price to pay for the elimination of rape.
Women's Center - Yes
The Women's Center provides a needed ser
vice to the University community, which is al
most half female. This year it organized a film
series, a Take-Back-The-Night rally and a full
moon dance; next year it hopes to do more. It
needs the $16,625 from the fee assessment to
continue its worthy projects. We support the
Women's Center fee request.
ASSU Guest Prof Bureau - Yes
Newly revived this year, the GPB is seeking
out qualified guest professors to teach here.
Although much controversy surrounded its de
cisions this year, the board attempts to bring
qualified teachers here who might not other
wise come here. Although its request of $58,158
is the largest of any group, the cost per course is
much smaller than regular Stanford courses. For
all these reasons we urge a yes vote for the GPB.
ASSU Legal Counseling - Yes
The Legal Counseling office has functioned
since 1973 as an effective aid to students need
ing legal help. For the services it will render, the
$43,915 is not excessive and is wisely spent. The
services are open to all students who do not ask
for a refund and, according to the office, 8 per
cent of the student body uses it each year. We
recommend a yes vote for this service.
ASSU Lobby Office - No
Although the function it hopes to provide
seems a worthy cause, the large amount of
money requested ($20,151), the possible dupli
cation of University lobbying and the difficulty
of ascertaining student consensus on possible
lobbying issues all serve to recommend a no
vote on this group's fee request.
The Band - Yes
The Band has entertained students, faculty
and alumni foryears, and it wants to continue to
do so next year. It is producing a non-profit
album, is planning a trip to the University of
Illinois and is a public relations asset to the
University. Because its budget indicates a finan
cially healthy organization and the $51,742 re
quested is not excessive given the costs of run
ning such a large organization, we heartily sup
port the Band's request.
Black Student Union - Split
This group, which supports a number of
worthy programs, is seeking all of its 1983-84
funding — $16,165 — from a student fee as
sessment. This year it obtained all of its funding
from other sources, such as the Dean of Student
Affairs Office, Ujaama house and the Program
Board, but it was unable to put on as many
activities as it wishes to next year because of the
amount of time its officers spent soliciting
funds. Because of these strong arguments both
for and against the assessment, the editorial
board was split on the issue and thus is making
no recommendation on the BSU's assessment.
