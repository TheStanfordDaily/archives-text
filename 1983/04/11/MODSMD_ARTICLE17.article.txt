# LETTER
## Computer series 
### 
I have been reading the series on
students and computers for the past
several days. Overall, it has been in
formative, and the statistics gathered
by the Stanford Student Media Use
Survey were interesting. However,
there are two instances of poor jour
nalism that spurred me to write this
letter.
The first concerns an editor's un
fortunate choice of a subheading for
the article "Students prepare for
computer revolution" (Daily, April
5). The subheading "Computer may
have won battle of man and ma
chine" has little to do with the article
and only perpetuates the view of
computers as omniscient beings in
some grave struggle with humans. A
computer is simply a tool, like a car,
telephone, or a tractor, which is
meant to make life easier and more
pleasant for all of us.
Second, the article, "Survey indi
cates students reluctant to use com
puters," (Daily, April 7) was down
right bad. The author claims that a
negative view of computers is "typi
cal of most students here." He then
goes on to say in the next sentence
that "only 13 percent of the students
here have never used computers, 34
percent worry that computers will
have a dehumanizing effect on soci
ety."
Since when has a response of 24 or
36 percent been considered "typical
of most?" In my book at least, most
means the majority (more than 50
percent in this case). Either the au
thor doesn't know how to interpret
statistics, or he is merely writing
about his own bias.
