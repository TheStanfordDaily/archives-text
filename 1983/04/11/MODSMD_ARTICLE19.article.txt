### MARY CATHERINE FISH 
As part of their first tour on
the West Coast, the interna
tionally known, all-black Mor
gan State University Choir
charmed an audience of 250 in
Memorial Church last Wed
nesday.
The concert fell on the third
day of the group's tour. The
first two were spent in San
Francisco and Berkeley, and
the tour will end with three
concerts in the Los Angeles
area this weekend. Nathan
Carter, conductor of the choir,
noted that although the
group's timeat Stanford was
short, "A brief encounter can
be of the natureto form a last
ing impression."
Carter's group is considered
one of the best college choral
groups and is uniquely distin
guished in its performance of
music by black composers and
composers of gospel music.
They recently went to Helsinki
where they made recordings
for Columbia Records which
will becomepart of a collection
of music by black composers.
The choir has also made re
cordings with the London
Symphony Orchestra and in
live concerts during their ex
tensive tours. They have made
notable performances at pre
stigious events such as the
Music Educators National Con
ference and the annual meet
ing of the American Choral Di
rector's Association.
The program opened with
pieces by George Handel, fol
lowed by selections from Ran
dall Thompson. A new ar
rangement by Donald Dillard
of "You Must Have True Reli
gion" was especially well

received. The first half ended
with a standing ovation for
"Ezekial Saw de Wheel."
The Stanford Gospel Choir
performed after intermission.
This group of more than 30
Christian students strives to
present the gospel in song.
Choir member Rick Williams
introduced them with a
chuckle as having "a style all
our own." Their last number
had many in the audience
standing up to dance and clap
along.
The second half of the Mor
gan State show consisted
mainly of songs from the musi
cal Eubie. The choir performed
these as part of a special tribute
to Eubie Blake which will be
aired on public television
sometime in May. The choir
closed with a song by the
Commodores.
Carter introduced the last
song by noting that diversity is
the key element of the choir.
He said, "We are capable of
doing a full concert in any one
of the groups you have seen
tonight."
Carter holds both bachelor
and masters degrees from the
Juilliard School of Music and
has received awards including
the Distinguished Service
Award of the National Associa
tion of Negro Musicians and
the Phi Mu Alpha Service
Award.
Wednesday's concert was
sponsored by the Stan
ford Gospel Choir, Stanford
Black Community Caucus,
Memorial Church and the
United Campus Christian
Ministries.
