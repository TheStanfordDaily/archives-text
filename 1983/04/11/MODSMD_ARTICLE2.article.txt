# Court ruling halts East Palo Alto incorporation vote
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
The increasingly bitter East Palo
Alto cityhood election, which is
planned for June 7, was halted by a
San Mateo Superior Court judge
Thursday because he said county of
ficials did not follow state law in set
ting up the incorporation vote.
Judge Melvin Cohn said petition
gatherers in East Palo Alto should
have gathered 25 percent of the sig
natures of the registered voters in
the community instead of the 5 per
cent they obtained.
He also said state law prohibits the
community from having an election
for two years after its first election,
which took place last year, unless
San Mateo County's Local Agency
Formation Committee (LAFCO) doc
uments that the election is is the pub
lic interest. LAFCO had not properly
shown that the election was in the
public interest, Cohn said.
East Palo Alto Municipal Council
member Ruben Abrica, a proponent
of cityhood, said he would appeal
the decision. He also said he expects
the appeals judge to rule in favor of
maintaining the June 7 election date.
Abrica said unless the appeals
judge rules against the election be
fore June 7, the vote will still take
place. If the judge rules against the
election after June 7, its results will

be invalidated, according to Abrica.
Proponents and opponents of in
corporation hailed the decision as a
victoryâ€”though proponents admit
ted their victory was somewhat less
direct.
"The opposition is doing more
damage to themselves by trying to
stop election," Abrica said. "I feel
the court of appeals will rule in our
favor and when they do people will
see the opposition's hypocritical at
titude."
Abrica said opponents of incorpo
ration claim they want a vote on
cityhood but that they are being
"contradictory" by filing the lawsuit
against the vote.
"People wonder what the opposi
tion is working for," Abrica said.
"This is just a momentary obstacle.
We have already won in terms of de
bating the issues. We will succeed in
the end."
Henry Anthony, chairman of the
Municipal Council, called Abrica's
claims "childish," however.
"This is politics. I wish those guys
(proponents of incorporation) would
just quit the bullshit. We've won this
round and it's not over yet. They
should stop calling people hypocriti
cal. It's just so stupid. I play by the
rules and I don't pull the childish
stuff they are pulling," Anthony said.
Anthony said the community
needs to obtain 25 percent of its vot
ers' signatures on petitions and that
he would help get the signatures if
necessary.
"We're not saving we don't want it
(the vote). We're just saying we don't
have the money to incorporate
now,'' he said.
Abrica said the petitioners thought
they onlv needed signatures of 5 per
cent of the voters because they
thought the District Reorganization
Act, filed in 1969, was germane.
Cohn ruled that a 19/7 law, the
Muni( ipal Organization Act, which
requires 25 percent, had prece
dence.
L.A. Breckinridge, an East Palo Alto

resident who was one of four people
to bring the suit, said he would like to
see the vote take place. He said,
however, that East Palo Alto resi
dents will oppose incorporation if
the vote does not happen.
' The older people who are
homeowneis will vote against it.
"Ihey know this community doesn't
have a tax base," Breckinridge said.
He said cityhood would bring
about a complete overhaul of the city
and that these homeowners will bear
the brunt of the over haul. Hesaidhe
brought the suit because he wants to
prevent changes in the community.
East Palo Alto barely rejected in
corporation last year in a controver
sial election that included many
Menlo Park voters. Supporters
Jaimed the June 7 election, which
would only involve East Palo Alto
voters, would reverse last year's re
sults.
