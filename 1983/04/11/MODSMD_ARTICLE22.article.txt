# Students here staying in the red

### JULIE BULIAVAC 
It's hard to be in the
red. . .sitting on the grass in
front of Tresidder, munching
on carrot sticks and red
licorice, drinking George Kil
lian's Red Ale, and simply hav
ing a great time.
Perhaps it's not so hard after
all. . .if you're a member of
"The Cardinal Heads," a new
association of redheads or
ganized by seniors )ohn Sage
and Tom Bridenbaugh.
"The Cardinal Heads" is an
official University club dedi
cated to organizing activities
that will make their club more
noticed, more visible to non
member, non-car rot-topped
University students.
When questioned about the
non-discriminative nature of
the club, Sage replied, "Sure
it's non-restrictive. Anyone
who feels like a redhead is wel
come to come—they don't
necessarily have to be one!'
The dub was initially or
ganized several weeks ago
when Sage noticed a letter in a
"Dear Abby"column concern
inga redheaded club located in
southern California. After
some research, Sage found
that this club, a branch of the
"Redhead Club of America,"
was basically a money-making
organization. Sage, by con
trast, was more interested in
starting a redheaded club
"strictly for fun."
To get the club off the
ground, Sage and Bridenbaugh
held an organizational meeting
with a tew interested friends,
sent out flyers and waited for
the response. The response
was positive. Fifteen people
were in attendance at the sec
ond meeting and another 15
expressed interest but were
unable to attend. In describing
the events of this second meet
ing, Sage explained, "We just
sat around, joked about our
hair, discussed our heritage
and experiences we've had,
and drank Killian's Red Beer."
The primary goal for the fu
ture is to gain recognition, to
become a more visible campus
organization. Junior Dayna
Wood, an enthused "Cardinal
Head" who plans to continue
co-ordinating club activities
after Sage and Bridenbaugh
graduate, said, "We want to

get more known on campus.
We want people to notice
us—even to laugh at us!" One
suggestion for accomplishing
this is to have some sort of
gathering at Tresidder or White
Plaza. "It should be interest
ing," Wood said. "You don't
often see 20 or 30 redheads in
the same place at the same
time."
Sage already has specific
plans for the tuture. He plans
to use money from fundraising
for club T-shirts, membership
cards and perhaps a wine
tasting event and parties. "A
'Come as your favorite red
head party would be great,"
Sage said. "There are so many
famous redheads that no one
really knows about."
The spirit of the "Cardinal
Heads" is light and the en
thusiasm high. As redheaded
freshman Lisa Archer expres
ses, "I haven't gone to the
meetings yet but I'm definitely
going to! Redheads stand out
in a crowd, and it would be fun
to just get together with these
'outstanding' people and have
a good time."
As for the motivation behind
founding the club, Sage said,
"Its purpose is to promote
brotherhood for my race."
"The Cardinal Heads" does in
deed provide this opportunity:
the opportunity to get to
gether, to form a lively and
tun-loving community of red
heads.
