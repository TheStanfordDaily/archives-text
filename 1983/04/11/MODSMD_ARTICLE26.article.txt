## Star forward may transfer Rogers stops out of school 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Sophomore basketball
player Johnny Rogers, the
Pacific-10 Rookie of the
Year in 1982, has stopped
out of school this quarter
"to evaluate the past two
seasons at Stanford."
Although the six-foot
eight forward may play
basketball again in Maples
Pavilion, it may not be in a
Cardinal uniform.
Rogers, listed among the
nation's top 35 high school
players two years ago by
Basketball Weekly, said he
may consider transferring to
another school.
"I decided to leave school
for the quarter just to eval
uate the past two seasons at
Stanford and decide if it's
the right thing for me," he
told the Daily last night in a
phone interview.
Rogers, who is currently
living at his home in Foun
tain Valley, Calif., said he is
satisfied with Stanford aca
demically and socially. "It's
mostly basketball that I'm
concerned about.
"My ultimate goal is to
play basketball beyond the
college level," he said.
The Card forward said he
ultimately decided to stop
out this quarter over the
week-long break separating
winter and spring sessions.
"But the decision about
leaving has culminated
since the beginning of the
season," he said
Rogers refused to confirm
or deny reports that he was
disenchanted with Stan

ford's "new" basketball
program. Tom Davis took
over for former Cardinal
coach Dick Dißiaso this sea
son and implemented con
siderable changes in the
team's style of play.
"I think I've improved as
an overall player (this sea
son)," Rogers said. "The
ironic thing is my stats
(statistics) haven't improved
from the past year."
Rogers averaged 12.5
points and 4.7 rebounds per
game his freshman season
and was named Pac-10
Rookie of the Year for his ef
forts. In his first year under
Davis, he dropped to 10.4
points and 4.0 rebounds an
outing.
The graduate of West
minster's La Quinta High
School started all but one of
27 games as a freshman, but
got the starting nod only
eight times last season. Rog
ers' minutes played per
game also fell — from 28 in
1981-82 to 24 in 1982-83.
"I had goals for other
things like personal hon
ors," he said. "They weren't
attained."
Assistant basketball coach
Bruce Pearl expressed his
hope that Rogers would re
turn to Stanford next fall.
However, he said, "What
ever's best for Johnny is best
for us as far as I'm con
cerned." Davis, in the San
Diego area yesterday, was
unavailable for comment.
Rogers now awaits his re
lease from Davis and Stan
ford, an act which would
enable him to talk with oth
er schools about their

basketball offerings.
Rogers is in no academic
difficulty at the present time
and said he needs just six
units of academic credit
(which he could receive at
summer school) to be
eligible to play at Stanford
next season.
If he decides to transfer,
Rogers would be forced to
sit out one season. If he
chooses to attend another
Pac-10 school, he would
also forfeit one of his two re
maining years of eligibility.
"I don't really have a
schedule in which a de

cision will be made," he
said, indicating that he will
probably look at other
schools and compare them
to Stanford once he gets his
release from Davis.
"If possible, I would like
to stay on the West Coast.
But my choices would be
limited if I chose such an av
enue."
Asked if he would sacri
fice academic opportunities
for athletic ones, Rogers re
plied, "As of right now, I
think basketball is more im
portant, but I'm not ignor
ing academics in the least."
