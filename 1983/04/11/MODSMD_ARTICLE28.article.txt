# Sluggers shaken by Cal in two of three games
## 
### SID SPAETH Senior staff writer 
It was business as usual for
Stanford last weekend even
though they dropped two-of
three games to last-place
California.
The Cardinal continued to
exude the kind of confidence
that makes them the nation's
No. 4-ranked team, although
their ranking will certainly
slide. They continued to swing
aggressively amid the throes of
a team-deep hitting drought —
not the oh-for-everyone kind
of slump that gets you buried,
but a nagging, lethargic hitting
spell nonetheless.
"You are going to get into
hitting slumps," Marquess
said. "You don't know when or
for how long, but its going to
happen two or three times a
year. You just have to hope you
can win a couple of close
games when it does happen."
The Cardinal, now 26-8-1
overall and 9-3 conference,
had its hands full of close
games, including an I l-inning,
3-2 loss at Cal yesterday.
Stanford did manage to win
at home Saturday when they
held off a late-game Cal attack,
including a dramatic pick-off of
the tying run in the ninth, to
nip the Bears 5-4. In Friday's
opener, Stanford committed
five errors in handing the Bears
a 7-4 win.
California, now 19-20 overall
and 5-8 conference and whose
hitting was equally dismal yes
terday, took advantage of a
rare error by third baseman
Vince Sakowski to score the
winning run in the 11th.
Chris Gibbons hit a one-out
double off John Radtke and
moved to third on a ground out
by Terry Greene. Lance Blan

kenship then ripped a two-two
pitch at Sakowski that rocketed
through his legs to drive in
Gibbons.
Stanford has been hampered
by anemic hitting for weeks,
but appeared to bottom out
yesterday. The Cardinal did not
score and had only two hits
until the ninth inning when
they trailed 2-0.
Mike Aldrete reached first
on an error and scored on a
double to deep right-center by
Eric Hardgrave. Walt Harris was
called in to pinch run and was
bunted to third by Sakowski.
Mike Dotterer then grounded
to the third baseman who
nailed Harris at the plate, but
Greg Lorenzetti followed with
a double to left-center that
scored Dotterer and tied the
game.
Cal starter Nick Esposito
held Stanford to two hits in
seven innings. Bill Hawkins,
who came in for the 11th inning
got the win and Radtke, now
0-2, was tagged with the loss.
The only sigh of relief on the
weekend was Saturday's nar
row win.
Marquess jostled his line-up
slightly before the game to try
and loosen things up. Aldrete
and Mark Davis traded spots in
the batting line-up and Lyle
Smith started at catcher in
place of Rick Lundblade.
"I just moved it around a lit
tle bit to give usa different look
— there is really no rhyme or
reason to it," Marquess said.
Dotterer, who drove in four
runs, provided most of the of
fensive reason for Stanford's
win and Jeff Ballard's second
straight appearance from the
bullpen netted him the win.
"It was a good win," Mar
quess said. "It was a good job

by Ballard and Dot (Dotterer)
drove in all the runs."
Stanford had only seven hits,
but Dotterer's first-inning tri
ple, a sacrifice fly by Davis in
the first and atwo-out single by
Dotterer in the seventh were
good for five runs.
Cal nearly came charging
back with a solo home run in
the eighth and the lead-off bat
ter on first in the ninth.
Ballard, now 5-1, walked
second baseman Frank Mattox
to lead off the last inning with
Stanford clinging to a 5-4 lead.
The sophomore southpaw
made several moves to first be
fore firing over one final time
to catch Mattox breaking for
second. Stanford easily snuf
fed him out in a rundown and a
vehement Cal coach Bob
Milano stormed the field cry
ing "balk."
"There is no question it was a
balk," Milano said later. "He
came up with his regular kick,
leaned to home and then actu
ally flipped the ball to first. As
soon as he leans to home, he
has to pitch."
Ballard maintained that the
movement was not a balk — "I
do that move all the time" —
and was happy with the per
formance.
"I felt good today," Ballard
said. "I was a little arm-weary
from yesterday (Friday), but I
was getting the ball down and
my stuff was 0.K."
Ballard struck out three bat
ters in only 2 i /i innings and
gave up one hit — the solo
home run by Gibbons in the
eighth.
"I got behind (3-1 to Gib
bons)," Ballard said, "and
didn't want to walk him so I
threw a fastball andsaid hititas
hard as you can . . . and he

did."
S[ lford starter Steve Cot
trell 'as getting himself in
troubl early — Cat's lead-off
batter i 'ached first in each of
the first four innings — but
used his relief experience to
bail himself out and left the
game with a 3-3 tie.
After four stolen bases Friday
and another four Saturday,
Stanford finally neutralized
Cal's speed, picking three run
ners off the basepaths Satur
day.
Dotterer was happy with the
win and felt the need for Stan

ford to continue challenging
people.
"Right now we're kind of
struggling," Dotterer said.
"That's why (Saturday's) win
was so important. We really
haven't been the aggressor
lately. We've been sitting back
waiting for Cal to do things.
"We have to keep swinging
the bat and be aggressive. If
you sit back and take pitches
you can prolong the thing. But
if you're aggressive, you might
make mistakes, but they're ag
gressive mistakes and those
aren't so bad."

Friday, the Cardinal looked
as though they might end their
batting woes when Davis hit a
towering two-run homer
against a heavy Bay wind in the
first inning. But the Cardinal
could score only two more
times, while their five defen
sive errors coaxed the Bears to
seven runs.
Despite the errors and the
outcome, Marquess was not
devastated.
"We haven't swung the bat
well for a couple of weeks,"
Marquess said. "I thought we
pitched well enough and even

though we didn't play that well
defensively, it wasn't a total
breakdown. Whenever you
make five errors, you'd think
you booted the ball all over the
place, hut it wasn't that bad."
Brian Myers picked up the
loss to lower his record to 5-2
while Bryan Price got the win
and Tom Beck got the save for
California.
Stanford's next game will be
Friday against UCLA at noon at
Sunken Diamond. Tuesday's
game at Fresno State has been
cancelled.

a 7-4 win.
California, now 19-20 overall
and 5-8 conference and whose
hitting was equally dismal yes
terday, took advantage of a
rare error by third baseman
Vince Sakowski to score the
winning run in the 11th.
Chris Gibbons hit a one-out
double off John Radtke and
moved to third on a ground out
by Terry Greene. Lance Blan

kenship then ripped a two-two
pitch at Sakowski that rocketed
through his legs to drive in
Gibbons.
Stanford has been hampered
by anemic hitting for weeks,
but appeared to bottom out
yesterday. The Cardinal did not
score and had only two hits
until the ninth inning when
they trailed 2-0.
Mike Aldrete reached first
on an error and scored on a
double to deep right-center by
Eric Hardgrave. Walt Harris was
called in to pinch run and was
bunted to third by Sakowski.
Mike Dotterer then grounded
to the third baseman who
nailed Harris at the plate, but
Greg Lorenzetti followed with
a double to left-center that
scored Dotterer and tied the
game.
Cal starter Nick Esposito
held Stanford to two hits in
seven innings. Bill Hawkins,
who came in for the 11th inning
got the win and Radtke, now
0-2, was tagged with the loss.
The only sigh of relief on the
weekend was Saturday's nar
row win.
Marquess jostled his line-up
slightly before the game to try
and loosen things up. Aldrete
and Mark Davis traded spots in
the batting line-up and Lyle
Smith started at catcher in
place of Rick Lundblade.
"I just moved it around a lit
tle bit to give usa different look
— there is really no rhyme or
reason to it," Marquess said.
Dotterer, who drove in four
runs, provided most of the of
fensive reason for Stanford's
win and Jeff Ballard's second
straight appearance from the
bullpen netted him the win.
"It was a good win," Mar
quess said. "It was a good job

by Ballard and Dot (Dotterer)
drove in all the runs."
Stanford had only seven hits,
but Dotterer's first-inning tri
ple, a sacrifice fly by Davis in
the first and atwo-out single by
Dotterer in the seventh were
good for five runs.
Cal nearly came charging
back with a solo home run in
the eighth and the lead-off bat
ter on first in the ninth.
Ballard, now 5-1, walked
second baseman Frank Mattox
to lead off the last inning with
Stanford clinging to a 5-4 lead.
The sophomore southpaw
made several moves to first be
fore firing over one final time
to catch Mattox breaking for
second. Stanford easily snuf
fed him out in a rundown and a
vehement Cal coach Bob
Milano stormed the field cry
ing "balk."
"There is no question it was a
balk," Milano said later. "He
came up with his regular kick,
leaned to home and then actu
ally flipped the ball to first. As
soon as he leans to home, he
has to pitch."
Ballard maintained that the
movement was not a balk — "I
do that move all the time" —
and was happy with the per
formance.
"I felt good today," Ballard
said. "I was a little arm-weary
from yesterday (Friday), but I
was getting the ball down and
my stuff was 0.K."
Ballard struck out three bat
ters in only 2 i /i innings and
gave up one hit — the solo
home run by Gibbons in the
eighth.
"I got behind (3-1 to Gib
bons)," Ballard said, "and
didn't want to walk him so I
threw a fastball andsaid hititas
hard as you can . . . and he

did."
S[ lford starter Steve Cot
trell 'as getting himself in
troubl early — Cat's lead-off
batter i 'ached first in each of
the first four innings — but
used his relief experience to
bail himself out and left the
game with a 3-3 tie.
After four stolen bases Friday
and another four Saturday,
Stanford finally neutralized
Cal's speed, picking three run
ners off the basepaths Satur
day.
Dotterer was happy with the
win and felt the need for Stan

ford to continue challenging
people.
"Right now we're kind of
struggling," Dotterer said.
"That's why (Saturday's) win
was so important. We really
haven't been the aggressor
lately. We've been sitting back
waiting for Cal to do things.
"We have to keep swinging
the bat and be aggressive. If
you sit back and take pitches
you can prolong the thing. But
if you're aggressive, you might
make mistakes, but they're ag
gressive mistakes and those
aren't so bad."

Friday, the Cardinal looked
as though they might end their
batting woes when Davis hit a
towering two-run homer
against a heavy Bay wind in the
first inning. But the Cardinal
could score only two more
times, while their five defen
sive errors coaxed the Bears to
seven runs.
Despite the errors and the
outcome, Marquess was not
devastated.
"We haven't swung the bat
well for a couple of weeks,"
Marquess said. "I thought we
pitched well enough and even

though we didn't play that well
defensively, it wasn't a total
breakdown. Whenever you
make five errors, you'd think
you booted the ball all over the
place, hut it wasn't that bad."
Brian Myers picked up the
loss to lower his record to 5-2
while Bryan Price got the win
and Tom Beck got the save for
California.
Stanford's next game will be
Friday against UCLA at noon at
Sunken Diamond. Tuesday's
game at Fresno State has been
cancelled.

It was business as usual for
Stanford last weekend even
though they dropped two-of
three games to last-place
California.
The Cardinal continued to
exude the kind of confidence
that makes them the nation's
No. 4-ranked team, although
their ranking will certainly
slide. They continued to swing
aggressively amid the throes of
a team-deep hitting drought —
not the oh-for-everyone kind
of slump that gets you buried,
but a nagging, lethargic hitting
spell nonetheless.
"You are going to get into
hitting slumps," Marquess
said. "You don't know when or
for how long, but its going to
happen two or three times a
year. You just have to hope you
can win a couple of close
games when it does happen."
The Cardinal, now 26-8-1
overall and 9-3 conference,
had its hands full of close
games, including an I l-inning,
3-2 loss at Cal yesterday.
Stanford did manage to win
at home Saturday when they
held off a late-game Cal attack,
including a dramatic pick-off of
the tying run in the ninth, to
