# Card to face UCLA, USC
## Men sizzle both Arizona squads 
### 
by BILL AINSWORTH
The sixth-ranked Stanford
men's tennis team routed
Arizona State and 20th-ranked
Arizona by the same score of
8-1 over the weekend to rack
up its 12th and 13th consecu
tive wins and gain momentum
for crucial matches against
USC and UCLA scheduled for
this weekend.
Despite injuries to key
plavers and a lineup filled with
freshmen, the Cardinal con
tinued to play outstanding
tennis. In a season that was
supposed to be a rebuilding
year, Stanford has slowly be

come a legitimate contender
for the national championship.
The Cardinal victories
helped prepare the team for its
most important contests of the
season — its upcoming home
weekend matches against No.
4-ranked USCand No. 5 UCLA.
Stanford Coach Dick Could
called the pair of wins "a pretty
impressive performance over
all."
The victories also assured
Stanford of receiving an invita
tion and a seed in the NCAA
team championships in mid-
May.
Based on his team's victories

so far this season, Could ex
pects no less than a sixth seed
ing at the NCAAs. Last year
Stanford did not earn a bid to
the championships.
In both Arizona contests, the
Cardinal dropped only one set
en route to sweeping the sing
les matches and wrapping up
the wins early.
Stanford's top-rated player,
Scott Davis, still not fully re
covered from a bout with
mononucleosis, looked im
pressive in breezing to two
singles wins.
On Friday, the junior star de
feated Arizona State's Jim

Bauman 6-2, 6-3 and on Satur
day disposed of Arizona's Paul
Chamberlain 6-3, 6-3. Though
scheduled to play doubles in
both matches, Davis was re
placed by Jeremy Semple in the
pairs after the Cardinal had
won enough individual
matches to clinch the team vic
tory.
According to Gould, Davis
will try to play a little more each
day to increase his strength for
the weekend matches. Gould
said it was too early to tell
whether Davis would be strong
enough to play both singles
and doubles against USC and
UCLA. But unless he has a re
lapse, Davis will at least play
singles this weekend.
Another top player,
freshman Dan Goldie, was also
not fully healthy last weekend.
Goldie, the No. 3 singles
player, sat out the Arizona
State match with a sore right
arm. On Saturday, however,
he bounced back to defeat
Arizona's Mike Lee 4-6, 6-1, 6-2.
Freshman sensation John
Letts continued to dominate
the No. 2 singles position by
knocking off Andis Luters of
Arizona 6-1, 6-2 and beating
Arizona State's Stan Perry 6-1,
1-6, 6-3.
The closest match of the
weekend, featuring Stanford
freshman Eric Rosenfeld and
Geordie McKee at No. 3 dou
bles against Arizona's Ken
MacDougal and Tod Mason,
ended with a 7-6, 2-6, 7-6 Car
dinal triumph.
The only losses the Cardinal
suffered over the weekend
were in No. 1 doubles, where
the team of Semple and
Lotts dropped both matches. At
No. 2 and No. 3 doubles the
Cardinal teams of Grabb/
McKeen and Rosenfeld/McKee
recorded victories.
The women's team picked
up a surprisingly easy WCAA
victory over UC-lrvine Friday,
blanking the Anteaters 9-0.
The Cardinal won all six sing
les matches in straight sets.
Junior Elise Burgin remained
undefeated at No. 1 singles in
Stanford matches, recording a
6-3, 6-1 win.


Stanford captain Mark McKeen collected
two straight set victories in weekend action
against Arizona State and Arizona. McKeen

Greg Webb/Daily
defeated ASU's Dewey Grattan 6-2, 6-4 on
