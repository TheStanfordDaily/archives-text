# Schmidt blasts winnable nuclear war in Law School speech

### RANDY BROBERG ALAN TRIPP 
Although he said he did not come to the United States
to criticize the government, former West German Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt said here Friday that Europeans
are "irritated at voices coming our of this country that
talk of limited nuclear war or the possibility of winning a
nuclearwaror even regionally limiting a nuclear war. . . .
"Quite a number of people in this country seem to
think that the more you spend, the better your defenses
get to be." By contrast, Schmidt said he believes it is the
soldiers, not the dollars, that count.
Schmidt has been staying at the campus home of Sec
retary of State George Shultz. He spoke to a capacity
crowd of approximately 200 at a barely publicized "class
room talk" Friday at the Law School.
As chancellor of West Germany from 1974 to 1982,
Schmidt was instrumental in the making of detente,
especially in negotiating the "German treaties" which
opened the doors for many West Germans to visit their
relatives in the communist German Democratic Repub
lic. Schmidt's party, the Social Democrats, lost a no
confidence vote in the German Parliament late last year.
A'though he is no longer the head of his party,
Schmidt was re-elected to the Parliament and will also
continue to speak out on German and international is
sues as an editor of the German daily, Die Zeit.
He said, "There is no chance for you to hope that I
should ever change my basic political attitudes."
Schmidt said he was very concerned about the build
up of so-called "Russian Furo-strategic Rockets."
"(Former President jimmy) Carter did not include the
Euro-strategic missiles in SALT II to our great discontent
and anxiety in Europe. In hindsight we are legitimate for
having disputed Jimmy Carter's approach."
Schmidt reminded his audience that all the nations in
Europe "dearly want serious arms control negotiations

between the superpowers. That means they want
treaties and ratification of treaties in the end."
When asked about the recent German elections,
Schmidt responded that the results were "by no means
disastrous."
He argued that the change in government was healthy
and that there is only "stinking normality" in Germany.
The Green Party, which for the first time won seats in
the Parliament, will be short-lived, according to
Schmidt. Although he admitted the Green vote ex
pressed a "general dissatisfaction. . .after a couple of
years they will turn into pretty conservative people. They
will probably be re-elected once but probably not for a
third term. By 1990 they will disappear."
German forces alone are capable of holding off an
aggression of the Warsaw Pact, Schmidt said. "We have
an army of 500,000 troops; within seven days we could
enlarge these forces up to 1.3 million, which is quite
good, certainly in the eyes of the Soviet military which
has had some experience of their own with German
forces.
"You gather from what I say that I don't suffer from
any inferiority complex, as long as they don't use nuclear
weapons. And since along with the German troops there
are 200,000 American soldiers, we will be able to hold
any thrust."
Schmidt said he does not believe that "detente" is a
dirty word. "Germans are much more interested in re
ducing tensions than any other people in Europe. . . .
Our country would be the battlefield.
"But we must maintain a posture, politically, econom
ically, and militarily which can contain expansionist Rus
sia and to maintain an equilibrium. I do not believe in
attaining superiority or pushing them back. I believe in
balances of forces and power to see that there is no
violation of the peace," he said.
