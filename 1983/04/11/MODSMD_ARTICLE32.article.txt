Two tied at Augusta
Augusta, Ca. — Defending cham
pion Craig Stadler rolled in a long
birdie putt on the 17th hole and tied
Ray Floyd for the third-round lead
yesterday in the rain-delayed 47th
Masters golf tournament.
Stadler, seeking to become only
the second man to take consecutive
titles in this event, scrambled his way
to a 3-under-par 69 —■ the best score
of the day.
He finished 54 holes over the rain
slickened, rolling hills of the Augusta
National Golf Club course in 210, 6-
under-par, and will be paired with
Floyd in the final twosome Monday
in the day-late finish of the most
weather-troubled Masters of them
all.
Floyd, one of six men stranded on
the course by darkness Saturday

night, matched that total with a
hard-won 71. He, and the other five
who were unable to complete play
Saturday, returned early in the
morning and finished the round.
Floyd parred the two holes he had
remaining and completed that
round in par 72.
Seve Ballesteros of Spain, a former
Masters and British Open
titleholder, birdied the last hole
from about 18 feet and was alone at
211, a single shot back with one
round to go.
Stanford alumnist Tom Watson,
twice a winner here and the current
U.S. and British Open champion,
and young Jodie Mudd, who turned
pro immediately after he'd been low
amateur in the 1982 Masters, were
next at 212.
Jack Nicklaus, winner of five Mas
ters titles, was forced to withdraw
from the tournament after the first
round due to back spasms.
Rookie wins for A's
Oakland — Left-hander Bill
Krueger broke into the major
leagues in luxury yesterday, being

staked to an early nine-run lead and
pitching the Oakland A's to an 11-4
victory over the California Angels.
The A's totaled 14 hits, including
three apiece by Mike Davis and
Wayne Gross. They led 7-1 after two
innings and 10-1 through four.
The 24-year-old Krueger, who
never pitched above the Class AA
level in the minors, was promoted to
the A's roster last week when Rick
Langford was placed on the disabled
list. He went seven innings Sunday,
allowing nine hits and four runs, and
Steve Baker worked the final two in
nings.
Giants blasted at Stick
San Francisco — Gary Mathews'
three-run homer capped an eight
run seventh inning yesterday that
carried Steve Carlton and the Phila
delphia Phillies to a 10-2 drubbing of
the San Francisco Giants.
Carlton pitched eight innings,
striking out 11 batters and scattering
six hits.
Loser Bill Laskey, 0-2, had a two
hitter entering the seventh and had a
two-strike count on Joe Morgan
before walking him. Mike Schmidt
walked on four pitches, then Greg

Minton replaced Laskey and Tony
Perez lined a double to left for a 2-0
lead.
Borg loses final outing
Tokyo — Sweden's Bjorn Borg bid
farewell to tennis yesterday by losing
a hard-fought decision to Jimmy
Connors of the United States, his
toughest rival during a decade of
stardom in the game.
Connors, 30, played inspired and
near-perfect tennis in beating the
26-year-old Borg 6-3, 6-4 in the
championship of the four-man,
$250,000 Suntory Cup tournament.
It was a bittersweet finale for the
five-time Wimbledon, six-time
French Open winner. There was
adulation, from 14,700 cheering
Japanese fans, and frustration, from
losing to the man he had once sup
planted as the best in the game.
Borg, who reached the final after
an impressive victory Saturday over
American John McEnroe, the third
member of the triumvirate of tennis
in recent years, started badly, losing
his first serve on several misplaced
shots.

striking out 11 batters and scattering
six hits.
Loser Bill Laskey, 0-2, had a two
hitter entering the seventh and had a
two-strike count on Joe Morgan
before walking him. Mike Schmidt
walked on four pitches, then Greg

Minton replaced Laskey and Tony
Perez lined a double to left for a 2-0
lead.
Borg loses final outing
Tokyo — Sweden's Bjorn Borg bid
farewell to tennis yesterday by losing
a hard-fought decision to Jimmy
Connors of the United States, his
toughest rival during a decade of
stardom in the game.
Connors, 30, played inspired and
near-perfect tennis in beating the
26-year-old Borg 6-3, 6-4 in the
championship of the four-man,
$250,000 Suntory Cup tournament.
It was a bittersweet finale for the
five-time Wimbledon, six-time
French Open winner. There was
adulation, from 14,700 cheering
Japanese fans, and frustration, from
losing to the man he had once sup
planted as the best in the game.
Borg, who reached the final after
an impressive victory Saturday over
American John McEnroe, the third
member of the triumvirate of tennis
in recent years, started badly, losing
his first serve on several misplaced
shots.
