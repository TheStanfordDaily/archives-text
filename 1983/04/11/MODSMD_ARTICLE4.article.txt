## ISC to kick off sorority rush tonight 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
The Inter-Sorority Council (ISC)
expects 300 to 350 women to partici
pate in an expanded spring rush dur
ing the next three weeks, according
to ISC President Suzanne Schendel.
This year's rush is twice as long as
last year's, when only five sororities
participated. According to ISC Rush
Chairman Sara Rostand, the addition
of a sixth sorority, Sigma Delta Tau,
this year meant that there was no way
the rush could be completed in less
than three weeks.

"Open House" parties tonight will
kick off the series of rush activities
for Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, Kappa
Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma,
Pi Beta Phi and Sigma Delta Tau.
Following Open House parties this
week, rushees will cut their choices
to first five and then three sororities
for "Invitational" parties.
Finally, the women will list two
sororities for the "Preference" par
ties, held on the seventh party night
of spring rush at homes of sorority
alumnae.
Unlike fraternities here and

sororities at many schools, Stan
ford's sororities will issue bids from
the sorority they most want to join.
All rushees are promised a spot in
one of the six groups.
Because no sorority has a house on
campus, all rush parties will be held
off campus, at a nearby school and at
the homes of sorority alumnae.
"Only three of the six sororities are
recognized (by the University), and
those three thought it would be best
not to split up the whole group,"
Rostand said.
