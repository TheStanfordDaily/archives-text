An informal survey of Stanford fraternities shows rush
turnout equal or higher than expected.
Alpha Delta Phi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Kappa Sigma,
Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi Omega
and Zeta Psi reported high party attendance as the first
week of spring rush drew to a close.
"This is the finest group of rushees I've ever seen,"
said Phil Ebling.. president of Sigma Chi Omega. "Our
turnout has been higher than expected. We'll have no
trouble filling our quotas."
Despite some predictions of decreased interest in
fraternities due to an overall increase in University hous
ing, informal checks with several houses indicated a
rising number of rushees this year. John Scanlon, Kappa
Sigma president, said, "All of the fraternities are off to
great start.
"We were kind of surprised at the turnout," said Scan
lon. "The first week seems to have been pretty strongj.
The new housing might be a factor, but I think rush is
going okay just about everywhere."
Initial concern that higher University-imposed mem
bership quotas would result in underfilled fraternity

houses have not materialized in many chapters on cam
pus, according to Ebling.
"Ouotas went up this year for all fraternities, but we
have all the people we need," he said. "I think that
fraternities offer more than just housing and that people
who are interested in frats aren't affected by more hous
ing this year."
Rick Hoskins of Delta Kappa Epsilon also claimed his
house "won't have any problems" filling quotas. "We
had a really good turnout for the first party," he said.
"We don't expect any problems during rush."
At Phi Delta Theta, house member Tom Bridenbaugh
noted "a very good turnout" after one week of rush.
"Freshmen are more informed about what they want in a
house this year. They pretty much know what they want
before they come here. I'd say people are more in
terested in living in the house despite the new housing."
Alpha Delta Phi rush chairman Dave Ehrlich also said
that "the concentration of people seem to be more
interested in the house" this year. He predicted that an
increase in University housing will have "no effect" on
"people who really want to join frats."
