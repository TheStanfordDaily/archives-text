Hussein backs out of peace talks
Amman, Jordan — Jordan's King Hussein declared
an end yesterday to efforts to negotiate an arrange
ment with the Palestine Liberation Organization for
joining talks under President Reagan's Middle East
peace initiative.
In a stinging, 11-page statement issued here,
Hussein accused PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat of re
neging on tentative agreements "in principle and in
detail" that they had made in recent talks.
Giving the strong impression he was washing his
hands of the matter, Hussein said Jordan now "will
neither act separately nor in lieu of anybody in
Middle East peace negotiations." He said it was now
up to the PLO and the Palestinian people to find ways

to recover land captured by Israel in the 1967 war.
The Jordanian monarch said his country had secur
ity interests in the outcome of negotiations, but he
said he does not intend to break ranks and begin sep
arate talks with Israel.
"We leave it to the PLO and the Palestinian people
to choose the ways and means for the salvation of
themselves and their land, and for the realization of
their declared aims in the manner they see fit,"
Hussein said.
(Israeli television last night quoted an unnamed
senior official as saying that Israel could not be disap
pointed in Hussein's announcement, since it never
had expected the United States to succeed in itseffort
to persuade the king to enter peace talks, Washington
Post correspondent Edward Walsh reported.)

Hussein's words appeared to sound the death knell
for Reagan's initiative, but some optimists here said
Hussein's statement might prompt a response of
positive action from either the United States or from
Arafat, who flew to the Persian Gulf last Tuesday and
has given no datefor returning, although Husseinsaid
the PLO leader had promised him he would be back
in two days. Arafat reportedly was in North Yemen
yesterday.
But even before the long Jordanian Cabinet ses
sion, presided over by the king, that preceded the
statement, PLO advisers here were doubtful that
Arafat would return soon, or that any agreement with
Hussein would be concluded in the near future.
Laced through Hussein's statement laying out the
recent history of efforts to reach an accommodation

between Jordan and the PLO was a tone of weary ex
asperation.
"Jordan has .. . cautioned against letting time pass
by without concluding a just and comprehensive
peace settlement because time was, and still is, essen
tial to Israel's aim of creating new facts and bringing
about a fait accompli," Hussein said.
Reagan still hopeful on Hussein
Washington — President Reagan, facing a poten
tially fatal blow to his Middle East peace initiative, in
sisted yesterday that he still is "very hopeful" that Jor
dan's King Hussein will join talks with Israel, and Rea
gan said he already is in personal contact with Hussein
