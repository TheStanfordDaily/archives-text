Hussein backs out of peace talks
Amman, Jordan — Jordan's King Hussein declared
an end yesterday to efforts to negotiate an arrange
ment with the Palestine Liberation Organization for
joining talks under President Reagan's Middle East
peace initiative.
In a stinging, 11-page statement issued here,
Hussein accused PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat of re
neging on tentative agreements "in principle and in
detail" that they had made in recent talks.
Giving the strong impression he was washing his
hands of the matter, Hussein said Jordan now "will
neither act separately nor in lieu of anybody in
Middle East peace negotiations." He said it was now
up to the PLO and the Palestinian people to find ways

to recover land captured by Israel in the 1967 war.
The Jordanian monarch said his country had secur
ity interests in the outcome of negotiations, but he
said he does not intend to break ranks and begin sep
arate talks with Israel.
"We leave it to the PLO and the Palestinian people
to choose the ways and means for the salvation of
themselves and their land, and for the realization of
their declared aims in the manner they see fit,"
Hussein said.
(Israeli television last night quoted an unnamed
senior official as saying that Israel could not be disap
pointed in Hussein's announcement, since it never
had expected the United States to succeed in itseffort
to persuade the king to enter peace talks, Washington
Post correspondent Edward Walsh reported.)

Hussein's words appeared to sound the death knell
for Reagan's initiative, but some optimists here said
Hussein's statement might prompt a response of
positive action from either the United States or from
Arafat, who flew to the Persian Gulf last Tuesday and
has given no datefor returning, although Husseinsaid
the PLO leader had promised him he would be back
in two days. Arafat reportedly was in North Yemen
yesterday.
But even before the long Jordanian Cabinet ses
sion, presided over by the king, that preceded the
statement, PLO advisers here were doubtful that
Arafat would return soon, or that any agreement with
Hussein would be concluded in the near future.
Laced through Hussein's statement laying out the
recent history of efforts to reach an accommodation

between Jordan and the PLO was a tone of weary ex
asperation.
"Jordan has .. . cautioned against letting time pass
by without concluding a just and comprehensive
peace settlement because time was, and still is, essen
tial to Israel's aim of creating new facts and bringing
about a fait accompli," Hussein said.
Reagan still hopeful on Hussein
Washington — President Reagan, facing a poten
tially fatal blow to his Middle East peace initiative, in
sisted yesterday that he still is "very hopeful" that Jor
dan's King Hussein will join talks with Israel, and Rea
gan said he already is in personal contact with Hussein
and other Arab leaders to keep the U.S. proposals on
track.
Reagan, who spoke to reporters when he returned
to the White House after a weekend at Camp David,
refused to accept as anything more than a temporary
setback the announcement that Hussein was break
ing off talks with Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat.
Those talks were aimed at winning PLO approval
for Hussein to join the peace process, and the Jor
danian announcement said the king will notenterthe
process independently.
Reagan, blaming the failure of the Hussein-Arafat
negotiations on "some radical elements of the PLO,"
said he had been in touch yesterday with Hussein and
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and planned To com
municate later in the day with other Arab heads of
state
Secretary of State George Shultz and his wife spent
the weekend at Camp David with the Reagans. It had
been billed as a social occasion, but U.S. officials said
privately that the president and Shultz had kept in
close touch with Mideast events and were studying
various steps to save the Reagan initiative from col
lapse.
The initiative, worked out by Shultz and an
nounced by Reagan in a nationally televised speech
last Sept. 1, calls for expanded negotiations to give the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip eventual
independence "in association with lordan." Israel has
rejected the idea, but the administration has been
working on the assumption that if Hussein agreed to
negotiate, the Israelis eventually could be won over
by guarantees of security and recognition from the
Arab world.
Since Hussein is crucial to further progress on the
U S. plan, the administration has emphasized trying to
help him win PLO approval to negotiate on behalf of
the Palestinian inhabitants of the occupied territories.
On Friday the administration said publicly that if
Hussein does join the peace talks, the United States
would put pressure on Israel to freeze the estab
lishment o' Jewish settlements in the territories.
In his brief remarks vesterday Reagan said, "Some
radical elements of the PLO have introduced changes
in the proposals that have been made .... Those pro
posals are unacceptable to King Hussein; they're un
acceptable to King Fahd; they're unacceptable to me.
And I have been in touch with King Fahd and King
Hussein and am going to be in touch with other Arab
leaders about this."
PIO spokesman assassinated
Albuieira, Portugal — a Leading PLO advocate of
reconciliation with Israel was assassinated yesterday
l»V j gUi i.d r who pumped five bi'llets into his head

and chest at point-blank range in a crowded hotel
lobby and escaped under police gunfire.
An extremist Palestinian splinter group claimed re
sponsibility for the murder.
Issam Sartawi, the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion's European coordinator, collapsed in a pool of
blood by the hotel reception desk. Police said he died
instantly and that an aide suffered a thigh wound in
the attack.
Sartawi was representing the PLO at the 16th Social
ist International, a conference of socialist politicians
held in this coastal resort.
Witnesses said bystanders screamed in panic as the
gunman, dressed in a light suit, walked up to Sartawi,
shot him, then ran out of the hotel waving a pistol.
In Damascus, Syria, a fanatic PLO splinter group
blamed for several attacks on moderate Palestinians
claimed responsibility for the killing, saying Sartawi
had tried to sell out the Palestinian cause.
"It is our pleasure to communicate to you our suc
cess in implementing the death sentence towards a
criminal and a traitor,'' said a statement by the Revo
lutionary Council of the Fatah.
China blasts Reagan
Peking — In one of its sharpest attacks on President
Reagan since he took office, China yesterday accused
the American leader of having "seized away" Chinese
tennis star Hu Na from her parents by personally de
ciding to grant her political asylum in the United
States.
People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper,
also branded as "stupid" U.S. policy-makers' han
dling of relations with China.
The front-Dage commentary in the newspaper's
Sunday edition said, "The president of an awe-inspir
ing big power... has seized away alive a Chinese girl
from her own parents and has offered himself as her
foreign father."
The editorial was one of the most stinging in a
fusillade of anti-American rhetoric touched off here
last week by a Reagan administration decision Mon
day to approve the 19-year-old tennis player's request
for asylum. Peking Thursday responded by severing
all sports and official cultural exchanges with the
United States this year.
Western diplomats here speculated that the sharp
personal attack on Reagan yesterday reflected a wide
ly held belief among the Chinese leadership that Rea
gan had deliberately snubbed the country's top lead
er, Deng Xiaoping, by brushing aside Deng's personal
appeal tc return Hu *o China.
i j br >eved to Have pressed the issue with Sec
r< ar> of State George S.iultz during talks in Peking in
February. China repeatedly has issued public guaran
tees that Hu would not face political persecution if
she returred home. The Chinese press has given pro

mininent play to the anguished pleas of Hu's family
and former teammates calling on American leaders to
"release" her.
The Reagan administraton's action on the issue,
diplomats here said, represented a major loss of face
for Deng in a politcal culture where such considera
tions are paramount. Deng reportedly has been un
der fire from hard-line opponents who charge that his
reformist policies and pursuit of relations with the
United States have compromised China's sovereignty
and "national dignity."
Hu, China's top-seeded woman tennis player, left
her team while competing in an international tour
nament in Santa Clara, Calif., last July. She requested
asylum in the United States on grounds that she faced
persecution in China for her refusal to join the Com
munist Party and serve as one of its socialist models for
youth.
Congressman Phil Burton dies
San Francisco — U.S. Rep. Phillip Burton, an en
vironmental champion and Democratic liberal in
Congress since 1964, died yesterday after complain
ing of back pains. He was 56.
The death of Democratic Congressman Phil Burton,
a tough, canny man whose gentle, sly smile and
backslapping campaign style belied a shrewd political
instinct, marks the end of an era in California politics.
Burton, the leader of a tight-knit political machine
and the head of California's congressional delegation
who was once described by an ally as "the most ob
noxious man in American government," died early
yesterday of heart disease in San Francisco, after near
ly 20 years in the House. He was 56.
Mixing street savvy and political subtlety, Burton
was the closest thing in California to the traditional
East Coast pol — a man who regularly walked the
streets of his Chinatown-"Polk Gulch"-Presidio
Heights constituency in a perpetual quest for support.
Peering over the spectacles which often slipped to
the end of his nose, Burton appeared donnish and
scholarly at news conferences, discussing crucial po
litical issues in soft tones but leaving no doubt about
the clout of his machine, centered in his 6th Con
gressional District.
Former Assembly Speaker and current state Treas
urer Jesse "Big Daddy" Unruh said yesterday he was
"very sorry to hear" of Burton's death.
"It leaves a big hole in Congress," Unruh said. "He
was one of the great political technicians. Everyone
had universal respect for his abilities and he will be
sorely missed."
It was Burton, much to the anger of California Re
publicans, who devised the intricate arid con
troversial reapportionment plan for the state's 45 con
gressional districts, strengthening the Democratic
majority in the state's delegation and solidifying his

own power base.
A backer of welfare reform and environmentalist is
sues — he is credited with the creation of the Golden
Gate National Recreation Area — Burton is best
known for his political infighting in that most partisan
of political arenas, reapportionment. Burton, an at
torney who served in the Army in World War II and
Korea, came one vote short of being elected House
Majority Leader in 1976.
Despite early predictions by political observers, he
easily won re-election in 1982 over liberal Republican
Milton Marks.
Space shuttle in good shape
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. — Challenger, Amer
ica's newest entry in space shuttles, came out of its
maiden flight "in beautiful shape ... a lot cleaner"
than its predecessor, Columbia, after its five flights, a
National Aeronautics and Space Administration of
ficial said yesterday.
James Harrington, ground operations manager for
the shuttle orbiter program, said the black-and-white
Challenger looked almost as shiny as it did when it
was rolled out of its hangar before its launch last Mon
day at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
Much like a used-car buyer kicking the tires and
peering at the engine, Harrington spent most of late
Saturday and all day Sunday inspecting Challenger.
He said it sustained some damage to six thermal
blankets, a new type of shield on each side of the tail
that was designed to protect the engines from the
furnace-like heat of re-entry from space.
Some of the blankets were peeled down to their
red felt interior, but the vehicle's "skin" was un
touched, Harrington said.
The blankets, each about 18 inches square, re
placed some of the heat-protective tiles on parts of
the orbiter.
Harrington said there also was a chip in one tile on a
door that opens to let down the landing gear. He said
Challenger had only "normal scuffing" on its tires and
undersurface.
None of the problems, he said, should prevent the
Challenger's takeoff early Thursday after it is
mounted piggyback on a Boeing 747 carrier plane for
a one-day trip to Kennedy Space Center at Cape Ca
naveral. Nor, he said, should anything cause the
spaceplane to be kept from meeting its next sched
uled launch in early June, the shortest turnaround of
any shuttle flight.
