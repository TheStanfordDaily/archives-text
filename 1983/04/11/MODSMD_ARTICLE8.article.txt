# University says 'Hello' to Ram's Head's Dolly
## Alexandra Coku brings youthful appeal to lead 
### LISA CARLOS 
Who is the lady we see coyly peer
ing from beneath the wide-brimmed
hat on Ram's Head's latest spring
production poster? Most will recog
nize her as Dolly Levi, the notori
ous matchmaker in Hello, Dolly! But
only a few know that she is also
dynamic junior Alexandra Coku, an
aspiring opera singer.
Coku exudes vitality and humor.
She has been described as "un
doubtedly exuberant," "comical,"
and "with a great zest for life" by
those who work with her on and off
stage.
While spending winter quarter in
Vienna, Coku decided, after much
deliberation, to pursue a profes
sional classical singing career, ignor
ing the pressure to join the pragmatic
engineeringand medical professions
of her peers.
She currently studies voice under
Lila Stewart. "I'm very seriously
studying opera—l even hope to sing
at La Scala or the Met someday," she
said.
Coku, who is of Albanian-Creek
descent, began to seriously pursue a
musical career after performing as a
senior in her high school's produc
tion of Fiddler On The Roof. From
there she performed in many other
musical productions. Her favorite
role is Nancy in Oliver. "This was a
meaty part, but I was only 18 and I felt
too young to play the part. I would
like to do it again," she said.
Here she has performed in various
productions. In Night Music she
played Petra, in last year's Godspell
she sang "Bless the Lord My Soul,"
and in Shakespeare's As You Like It
she played Audry. Besides currently
working in Hello, Dolly! and carrying
a full load of 18 units, Coku is also
preparing for a recital at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium where she will sing
Mozart's "Exultate Jubilate."
"Sometimes our work suffers from
doing these plays," explained Coku.
"Even though academics are the
most important part of being at Stan
ford, I can't perform as well as a stu
dent without music. I need that
pressure to perform well at every
thing else, also."
Watching Coku after rehearsal,
holding up an unhemmed velvet
skirt, followed by the costume de
signer, one wonders where she finds
the drive to bellow out songs, stay
awake into the early hours of the

morning rehearsing and still manage
to greet people with a genuine smile.
"I don't think I can face a quarter
without a show—l need the adrena
lin to keep my energy level up," said
Coku.
The amount of time Coku spends

with the other 75 people involved in
the production depends on whether
a person is a member of the cast, a
director or a technician. "On the av
erage," said director Lauren
Coldman, "they spend about 20
hours a week, or 40 if you count the

worry." She also said that most of
them sacrificed spring break to stay
on campus and rehearse.
As an actress, Coku faces many
challenges in portraying Dolly
Levi. Dolly traditionally has been

depicted as a more matronly woman,
performed by such actresses as Bar
bara Streisand and Carol Channing.
Asst. Director Andy Duxbury said
that because of her age, Coku plays a
Dolly "who is younger, sexier and

more desirable. . .whose steamrol
ler personality allows her to domi
nate."
Goldman said the most difficult
hurdle for an at tress like Coku is "to
be a more honest performer, bring
ing in aspects of her own personal
ity" to the character Dolly. The di
rector's main task is "to find a charac
ter for Dolly that is unique and incor
porates aspects of the actress' own
personality." Duxbury also noted that
playing Coku's role is difficult be
cause "Dolly is a spontaneous per
son who knows the first and last step,
and gets what she wants." However,
Golciman believes that Coku "is a
very talented performer."
Another challenging aspect of her
acting is the working relationship she
maintains with the other leads in the
musical. The lead playing opposite
her is Horace Vandergelder, played
by Richard Gerrig, a doctoral candi
date in the Psychology Department.
Coku said the cast was all "very
buddy-buddy" and "Richard and I
work marvellously together."
She candidly added that on stage,
as characters "they are an odd
couple" with conflicting per
sonalities. This is further exagger
ated by the differences in their
height. Gerrig is 5 feet 7 inches tall
and Coku is 5 feet 10 inches. "In one
scene we are fighting with each other
and I'm looking down on him," she
said, adding, "In another I'm dipping
him instead of him dipping me."
In order to add more depth to the
character of Dolly the directors inte
grated parts of Thornton Wilder's
original The Matchmaker, the play
that was later adapted into the
Broadway musical Hello, Dolly!
Coku said anyone with the
slightest interest in theater or music
should try them. "Students are afraid
to show their talent. There is such
amazing talent hidden behind walls
that I encourage anyone to audition
for anything." Coku also said that
she perceives a lack of musically
gifted actors. "We have many tal
ented ac tors here at Stanford, but we
need more people with musical abili
ties."
"Other than a very few, no one
really wants to be a professional
actor or actress in this production.
On the whole it is just a release from
the normal strictly academic life, it's
something fun. We do work hard,
but in a different, exciting way."

holding up an unhemmed velvet
skirt, followed by the costume de
signer, one wonders where she finds
the drive to bellow out songs, stay
awake into the early hours of the

morning rehearsing and still manage
to greet people with a genuine smile.
"I don't think I can face a quarter
without a show—l need the adrena
lin to keep my energy level up," said
Coku.
The amount of time Coku spends

with the other 75 people involved in
the production depends on whether
a person is a member of the cast, a
director or a technician. "On the av
erage," said director Lauren
Coldman, "they spend about 20
hours a week, or 40 if you count the

worry." She also said that most of
them sacrificed spring break to stay
on campus and rehearse.
As an actress, Coku faces many
challenges in portraying Dolly
Levi. Dolly traditionally has been

depicted as a more matronly woman,
performed by such actresses as Bar
bara Streisand and Carol Channing.
Asst. Director Andy Duxbury said
that because of her age, Coku plays a
Dolly "who is younger, sexier and

more desirable. . .whose steamrol
ler personality allows her to domi
nate."
Goldman said the most difficult
hurdle for an at tress like Coku is "to
be a more honest performer, bring
ing in aspects of her own personal
ity" to the character Dolly. The di
rector's main task is "to find a charac
ter for Dolly that is unique and incor
porates aspects of the actress' own
personality." Duxbury also noted that
playing Coku's role is difficult be
cause "Dolly is a spontaneous per
son who knows the first and last step,
and gets what she wants." However,
Golciman believes that Coku "is a
very talented performer."
Another challenging aspect of her
acting is the working relationship she
maintains with the other leads in the
musical. The lead playing opposite
her is Horace Vandergelder, played
by Richard Gerrig, a doctoral candi
date in the Psychology Department.
Coku said the cast was all "very
buddy-buddy" and "Richard and I
work marvellously together."
She candidly added that on stage,
as characters "they are an odd
couple" with conflicting per
sonalities. This is further exagger
ated by the differences in their
height. Gerrig is 5 feet 7 inches tall
and Coku is 5 feet 10 inches. "In one
scene we are fighting with each other
and I'm looking down on him," she
said, adding, "In another I'm dipping
him instead of him dipping me."
In order to add more depth to the
character of Dolly the directors inte
grated parts of Thornton Wilder's
original The Matchmaker, the play
that was later adapted into the
Broadway musical Hello, Dolly!
Coku said anyone with the
slightest interest in theater or music
should try them. "Students are afraid
to show their talent. There is such
amazing talent hidden behind walls
that I encourage anyone to audition
for anything." Coku also said that
she perceives a lack of musically
gifted actors. "We have many tal
ented ac tors here at Stanford, but we
need more people with musical abili
ties."
"Other than a very few, no one
really wants to be a professional
actor or actress in this production.
On the whole it is just a release from
the normal strictly academic life, it's
something fun. We do work hard,
but in a different, exciting way."

WELL HELLO!: Alexandra Coku (right) and Chaveta Bryant (left) prac
tice for the upcoming Ram's Head production of Hello Dolly! Many of
the cast members sacrificed their spring break to rehearse for the musi
cal.
Who is the lady we see coyly peer
ing from beneath the wide-brimmed
hat on Ram's Head's latest spring
production poster? Most will recog
nize her as Dolly Levi, the notori
ous matchmaker in Hello, Dolly! But
only a few know that she is also
dynamic junior Alexandra Coku, an
aspiring opera singer.
Coku exudes vitality and humor.
She has been described as "un
doubtedly exuberant," "comical,"
and "with a great zest for life" by
those who work with her on and off
stage.
While spending winter quarter in
Vienna, Coku decided, after much
deliberation, to pursue a profes
sional classical singing career, ignor
ing the pressure to join the pragmatic
engineeringand medical professions
of her peers.
She currently studies voice under
Lila Stewart. "I'm very seriously
studying opera—l even hope to sing
at La Scala or the Met someday," she
said.
Coku, who is of Albanian-Creek
descent, began to seriously pursue a
musical career after performing as a
senior in her high school's produc
tion of Fiddler On The Roof. From
there she performed in many other
musical productions. Her favorite
role is Nancy in Oliver. "This was a
meaty part, but I was only 18 and I felt
too young to play the part. I would
like to do it again," she said.
Here she has performed in various
productions. In Night Music she
played Petra, in last year's Godspell
she sang "Bless the Lord My Soul,"
and in Shakespeare's As You Like It
she played Audry. Besides currently
working in Hello, Dolly! and carrying
a full load of 18 units, Coku is also
preparing for a recital at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium where she will sing
Mozart's "Exultate Jubilate."
"Sometimes our work suffers from
doing these plays," explained Coku.
"Even though academics are the
most important part of being at Stan
ford, I can't perform as well as a stu
dent without music. I need that
pressure to perform well at every
thing else, also."
Watching Coku after rehearsal,
holding up an unhemmed velvet
skirt, followed by the costume de
signer, one wonders where she finds
the drive to bellow out songs, stay
awake into the early hours of the

morning rehearsing and still manage
to greet people with a genuine smile.
