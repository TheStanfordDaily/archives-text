## The 						Stanford Daily The 						Daily recommends 
### 
The nine-member Daily editorial board inter
viewed 22 ASSU Senate candidates, eight
groups seeking a fee assessment and two Coun
cil of Presidents slates during the past two
weeks.
The Daily considered for endorsement only

senate candidates who were interviewed. We
considered all groups for fee assessment en
dorsements.
While it is always important that students
vote, remember that this year only students
who vote may claim fee assessment refunds.
