# H & S Dean receives Freedman grievance
## 
### TROY EID Staff writer 
Estelle Freedman, assistant his
tory professor whose repeated
tenure denials last year spawned
controversy nationwide, has filed
an official grievance with the
Dean of Humanities and Sciences.
Freedman's appeal for tenure
probably will not be granted by
Humanities and Sciences Dean
Norm Wessells, according to As
sistant Provost Noel Kolak. "I
don't think Dean Wessells will re
verse his decision," Kolak said
yesterday.
However, Kolak said that she
thought the Freedman case was
likely to reach the provost's of
fice, the next level in the appeal
process.
The unusually long tenure bat
tle began in March, 1982, when
Freedman was informed by
then-History Department Chair
man Peter Stansky that she had
been denied tenure. That deci
sion was met with opposition by
many students and faculty mem
bers here and led to a second
hearing which ended in a denial

by the Committee on Appoint
ments and the deans of
Humanities and Sciences last De
cember.
"I can't imagine tha t Dean Wes
sells will go through this case
again," said History P rof. Carl De
