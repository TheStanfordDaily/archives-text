# H & S Dean receives Freedman grievance
## 
### TROY EID Staff writer 
Estelle Freedman, assistant his
tory professor whose repeated
tenure denials last year spawned
controversy nationwide, has filed
an official grievance with the
Dean of Humanities and Sciences.
Freedman's appeal for tenure
probably will not be granted by
Humanities and Sciences Dean
Norm Wessells, according to As
sistant Provost Noel Kolak. "I
don't think Dean Wessells will re
verse his decision," Kolak said
yesterday.
However, Kolak said that she
thought the Freedman case was
likely to reach the provost's of
fice, the next level in the appeal
process.
The unusually long tenure bat
tle began in March, 1982, when
Freedman was informed by
then-History Department Chair
man Peter Stansky that she had
been denied tenure. That deci
sion was met with opposition by
many students and faculty mem
bers here and led to a second
hearing which ended in a denial

by the Committee on Appoint
ments and the deans of
Humanities and Sciences last De
cember.
"I can't imagine tha t Dean Wes
sells will go through this case
again," said History P rof. Carl De


Estelle Freedman
gler, who headed an academic
committee that supported
Freedman's scholarship during
the second hearing. "The dean
has been through this thing twice.
It needs to be evaluated by some
one on a different level."
Degler said that Freedman "in
tends to appeal as far as she can"
in order to be granted tenure. He
noted recent editorials in the Los
Angeles Times and The Chronicle
of Higher Education supporting
Freedman's appeal.
"Many of us feel that the public
ity this case has gotten is inexplic
able," Degler added. "I think the
publicity has not been good. It is
not fitting for a university of Stan
ford's reputation.

"I just returned from a conven
tion of the Organization of Ameri
can Historians in Cincinnati.
There was some concern over the
Freedman case. My colleagues
ana I want this to receive the
proper attention."
Law School Prof. Barbara Bab
cock, chair of Freed man's support
committee, said that "all of Dr.
Freedman's supporters are very
hopeful" that she will be granted
tenure. "The grievance is an
elaborate and compelling docu
ment," she said. "I think a
number of people have already
written to the provost."
Babcock noted a New York
Times editorial supporting
Freedman as typical of growing
interest in the case across the
country. She said the Center for
Research on Women has created a
file to keep up with articles in var
ious American publications con

cerned with Freedman's appeal.
"I was just giving a speech in
Cleveland and everyone there
knew about it," Babcock said.
Both Freedman and Wessells
were unavailable for comment.
Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences William Chace
noted that "a grievance is a very
detailed document. Dr. Freedman
has filed a grievance, as was ap
propriate with this office." Chace
said that Wessells "is consider
ing" Freedman's case but de
clined further comment.
lacqueline Bryan, assistant to
the dean of Humanities and Sci
ences, said she "couldn't di
vulge" specific information about
Freedman's grievance or Wes
sells' opinions on the case. "We
have told her that we have re
ceived the grievance, which is
customary for this department,"
she said."
