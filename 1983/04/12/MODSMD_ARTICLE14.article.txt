# Nuclear freeze isn't solution
## 
### 
Only 10 years ago, basking in the
imagined security of the SALT I Tre
aty, Americans felt generally confi
dent that a permanent formula had
been found to prevent nuclear war:
namely, the Nixon-Brezhnev doc
trine of MAD—Mutual Assured De
struction. The two lynchpins of this
concept were the invulnerably
destructive arsenals of missiles of
each nation and the joint renuncia
tion of any anti-ballistic missile de
fense systems. Thus, total offensive
capability and utter lack of defensive
capability were seen as the keys to
peace.
Today, any consensus Americans
may once have had about nuclear
weapons policy is totally shattered.
At one pole of a very polarized spec
trum, the president of the United
States advocates massive new spend
ing and programs to achieve an elu
sive "equality," if not superiority,
vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. At the
other pole, a growing coalition
feverishly advocates a "nuclear
freeze," in the equally elusive hope
that a quick fix can be found to stop
the nuclear arms race in its tracks.
Both extremes in this debate seem
blinded to a realistic appraisal of the
situation and the vision of both is
clouded by unreasoning fear: for Re
agan, fear of the Soviets, and for the
Freeze advocates, fear of nuclear
war. Not, let me hasten to say, that
fear of nuclear war is unreasonable
— of course any sane person fears
such a prospect — but that this fear
has driven some to take an unreason
ing attitude toward how to solve the
problem.
I am sure the motives of the many
people who back the Nuclear Freeze
proposal are unimpeachable, but it is
a simple fact that the Nuclear Freeze
would not solve the arms race, would
not increase our security and would
not reduce the chances of nuclear
war. The Freeze proposal substitutes
an emotional, simplistic panacea for
cool-headed reasoning. And no, the
reason I oppose the Freeze is not be
cause I think that it will "freeze the
United States into a position of in
feriority" as President Reagan main
tains. I oppose it because it would do
too well precisely what it is supposed
to: freeze into place an unacceptable
and dangerous situation and destroy
any incentive on the part of the
Soviets to take what is clearly the
only sane route out of our joint nu
clear madness.
Unlike Reagan, I do not believe the
danger of the present situation has
anything much to do with American
nuclear inferiority; actually, our po
sition is quite good. In fact, the two
factors contributing most to the
danger of today's world and the
chances of a nuclear war are:
—Both the United States and the
Soviet Union have land-based mis
siles, and
—The Soviet Union in particular

has too many land-based missiles
and too few submarine-based mis
siles.
At the present numerical level of
nuclear weapons, simply increasing
the number of our present systems
neither increases nor decreases our
security or the chances of a nuclear
war. It is largely for this reason that
the Freeze, as far as its numerical ef
fect goes, would also neither in
crease nor decrease our security
from nuclear war. The dangerous
impact of the Freeze would be its
"freezing" of the current mix of our
(and the Soviets') nuclear weapons.
Foritisthatmixof weapons that con
stitutes the real threat to world
peace.
Everyone agrees that nuclear
weapons are bad, but it is rarely ap
preciated just how especially bad
one particular type of nuclear deliv
ery system is: I am speaking of land
based missiles. In caseanyone needs
convincing, let me catalogue the
evils of land-based missiles. First,
they are frighteningly reflexive
weapons. Soviet and American
ICBM's would reach theirtargets less
than 30 minutes after launch. Once
launched, no second thoughts are
possible, since land-based missiles
can't be recalled.
The speed and accuracy of land
based missiles gives rise to First
Strike Temptation. Land-based mis
siles are easy targets for other land
based missiles, which makes it
tempting to use then as counterforce
weapons (that is, to use them to de
stroy the other guy's land-based mis
siles before he gets the same idea).
Fear and temptation conspire to en
courage any nation with a counter
force capability to contemplate
launching a first-strike against its
enemy.
By a grim irony, civilian popula
tions are almost forgotten (although
they'll still suffer the consequences)
in the counterforce race, as the two
nations become obsessed with being
able to destroy the other guy's capa
bility before hecan destroyyours be
fore you can destroy his before he
can destroy yours before. . .you get
the picture. Even worse, this simul
taneous fear of, and temptation to
ward, a first-strike, which is brought
about by the peculiar characteristics
of land-based missiles (namely, their
extreme destructive power and their
extreme vulnerability), gives rise to
the even more hair-raising phenom
enon of the Launch-on-Warning
Syndrome.
For two nations dependent mostly
on the opposing nation leads to a
hair-trigger readiness to launch on
even the slightest warning of a
launch by the other nation. This is
only a rational policy, after all, since
if Nation A waits for Nation B's mis
siles to actually hit him, then he has
already lost the capability to retaliate.
Thus, each nation's concern for its

own survival leads to a situation
where the slightest false alarm or
miscalculation could unleash a
holocaust.
Fortunately, the United States and
the Soviet Union are not as bad off as
Nations A and B, because we are not
totally dependent on land-based
missiles. But we are still far too de
pendent on land-based missiles. It is
absolutely imperative, as a first step
toward sharply reducing the likeli
hood of nuclear war, that we and the
Soviets change the mix of our nu
clear arsenals to eventually eliminate
land-based missiles, while upgrading
our submarine-based missiles. The
latter step is necessary, especially for
the Soviets, if we are to have any
realistic hope of getting rid of land
based missiles, because the Soviets
have historically emphasized land
based missiles to a lopsided degree,
and thus at the moment feel very de
pendent on them.
Development of the Soviet Ty
phoon submarine program would
increase their sense of security and
help them to feel safer about relin
quishing their huge land-based arse
nal, while development of our own
Trident submarine program would
strengthen our submarine deterrent,
while prodding the Soviets to recog
nize that land-based missiles are ob
solete. The Trident program, you
see, has the capability of destroying
Soviet land-based missiles, just as
their present missiles already have
the capability of destroying ours.
Anti-nuclear and Freeze activists
foolishly oppose the Trident pro
gram for that reason, not under
standing that only powerful sub
marine forces on both sides will ena
ble either of us eliminate land-based
missiles and feel safe while doing so.
Submarines are essentially invul
nerable targets, at least in terms of a
preemptive first-strike, and they thus
form a nuclear trump card or "safety
net" which should deter any use of
nuclear weapons. Development of
Trident will make the Soviets realize
what we already know: that land
based missiles, while terribly de
stabilizing and destructive, are also
hopelessly vulnerable and obsolete.
For example, our own proposed
MX missile program, foolishly touted
by the Reagan administration as "in
vulnerable," would in fact be a $30
billion boondoggle: most experts
predict its "invulnerability" would
last approximately four years. The
freeze, with its obsession on numeri
cally halting the arms race, ignorees
these subtleties, and could lock us
into the present no-win situation. All
nuclear weapons are bad, but better
to have the "safe" deterrent of
submarine-launched missiles than
the present emphasis on destabiliz
ing land-based missiles.
