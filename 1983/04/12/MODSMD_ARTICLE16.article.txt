# Hatred: it's in their faces
## 
### 
One of the strongest weapons on the public opinion
of the civil rights protesters of the '60s was the television
coverage of their marches. The marchers walked to
gether, smiling, often holding hands or singing. And by
contrast, the hostile crowds on the sidewalks displayed
their hatred. Their faces appeared distorted, ugly, sub
human. Even on the fuzzy replays of old newsclips,
those faces are a terrible thing to see.
Everycoupleof months, in the papersoron television,
you can observe small groups of middle-aged men pub
licly demonstrating for thier own strongly held beliefs.
They don't appear very powerful, or especially charisma
tic, and they clearly represent a tiny minority of political
feeling. But they need police protection to march, be
cause all around them are the distorted, hating faces of
people threatening and screaming obscenities. They are
members of a group like the American Nazi Party or the
Ku Klux Klan. The only difference in the appearance of
the crowds is that the hatred has become multiracial.
The motivation of the crowds differs, of course.
Somehow, violence and hatred seem morally justified
when they are applied against a group that advocates
racism and hatred. Croups like the Nazis and the Klan
espouse wholly repugnant ideas, but this country has
a history of giving overt and tacit consent to racism.
Race bigotry should be offensive to everyone, but it is
not. Thus, people must guard against racism having any
greater influence on public discourse.
But I cannot believe that the vicious, hate-filled
crowds that hurl rocks and curses provide protection
from racists.
I am not the type of civil libertarian who desires to
extend the absolute constitutional guarantees of free
speech to groups that advocate institutionalized hatred
and racism. In extreme cases, the state should be able to
ban groups like the Nazis and the Klan from publicly
expressing their views at certain times in certain places.
For example, I would not have protested if the Nazis had
been banned from marching in front of the many
holocaust survivors in Skokie, 111. a few years ago.
However, even if the government has the power to
prevent such groups from public disclosure, it should
almost never exercise that power, for two reasons. First,
such great power, for two reasons. First, such great
power carries with it responsibility of great restraint. No
democratic government should be responsible with
exercising all its authority. Second, people can only

learn to oppose white supremacist groups if those
groups can make their views heard. The Nazis and the
Klan are their own worst advocates, for their presence is
a reminder of an evil that haunts our past and stalks our
future. Understanding and opposing that evil is better
than concealing and ignoring it.
The theory seems true to me, but the practice does not
always support it. Surely, many people who hear of
racist demonstrations strengthen their determinations
to fight prejudice and unjust discrimination in our soci
ety by educational and legal means. Their protests have
political worth and human dignity. But my mind keeps
returning to those faces in the violent, hating crowds. All
protesters seem to have learned from the haters is how
to hate. Their response to peacefully-advocated evil is to
practice the violent evil of trying to tear other people
into pieces.
Certainly, the world has worse problems than
whether racists are treated with punctilious courtesy,
bul I feel a need to tackle this worst case, to deny that
hatred ever has a valid place in public discourse, even in
opposing other hatred. Organized public violence
seems to rei eive a < ertain moral sanction if it is a political
protest against an extreme group or if it is part of a labor
dispute. Such violence is often understandable, but it is
neither justifiable nor good.
When political hatred is accepted in one context, it
leaks into others. The U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations is yelled down and forced from a podium in
Berkeley. A mayoral candidate in Chicago is chased from
a church. Political personages like Ronald Reagan or the
Queen of England are hawked by protesters only two
shades less intense than those who confront the Nazis
and the Klan.
Some types of raw passion are ennobling and uplift
ing: the love for another person or the pursuit of per
sonal excellence. Those passions are an affirmation of
the worth and potential of human beings, and thus of
the community around you and yourself. By contrast,
whose who are so self-righteous as tho shout down,
physically threaten and hate other people are only af
firming a politics of hatred and violence. They are mak
ing themselves less than human. You can see it in their
faces.

Everycoupleof months, in the papersoron television,
you can observe small groups of middle-aged men pub
licly demonstrating for thier own strongly held beliefs.
They don't appear very powerful, or especially charisma
tic, and they clearly represent a tiny minority of political
feeling. But they need police protection to march, be
cause all around them are the distorted, hating faces of
people threatening and screaming obscenities. They are
members of a group like the American Nazi Party or the
Ku Klux Klan. The only difference in the appearance of
the crowds is that the hatred has become multiracial.
The motivation of the crowds differs, of course.
Somehow, violence and hatred seem morally justified
when they are applied against a group that advocates
racism and hatred. Croups like the Nazis and the Klan
espouse wholly repugnant ideas, but this country has
a history of giving overt and tacit consent to racism.
Race bigotry should be offensive to everyone, but it is
not. Thus, people must guard against racism having any
greater influence on public discourse.
But I cannot believe that the vicious, hate-filled
crowds that hurl rocks and curses provide protection
from racists.
I am not the type of civil libertarian who desires to
extend the absolute constitutional guarantees of free
speech to groups that advocate institutionalized hatred
and racism. In extreme cases, the state should be able to
ban groups like the Nazis and the Klan from publicly
expressing their views at certain times in certain places.
For example, I would not have protested if the Nazis had
been banned from marching in front of the many
holocaust survivors in Skokie, 111. a few years ago.
However, even if the government has the power to
prevent such groups from public disclosure, it should
almost never exercise that power, for two reasons. First,
such great power, for two reasons. First, such great
power carries with it responsibility of great restraint. No
democratic government should be responsible with
exercising all its authority. Second, people can only

learn to oppose white supremacist groups if those
groups can make their views heard. The Nazis and the
Klan are their own worst advocates, for their presence is
a reminder of an evil that haunts our past and stalks our
future. Understanding and opposing that evil is better
than concealing and ignoring it.
The theory seems true to me, but the practice does not
always support it. Surely, many people who hear of
racist demonstrations strengthen their determinations
to fight prejudice and unjust discrimination in our soci
ety by educational and legal means. Their protests have
political worth and human dignity. But my mind keeps
returning to those faces in the violent, hating crowds. All
protesters seem to have learned from the haters is how
to hate. Their response to peacefully-advocated evil is to
practice the violent evil of trying to tear other people
into pieces.
Certainly, the world has worse problems than
whether racists are treated with punctilious courtesy,
bul I feel a need to tackle this worst case, to deny that
hatred ever has a valid place in public discourse, even in
opposing other hatred. Organized public violence
seems to rei eive a < ertain moral sanction if it is a political
protest against an extreme group or if it is part of a labor
dispute. Such violence is often understandable, but it is
neither justifiable nor good.
When political hatred is accepted in one context, it
leaks into others. The U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations is yelled down and forced from a podium in
Berkeley. A mayoral candidate in Chicago is chased from
a church. Political personages like Ronald Reagan or the
Queen of England are hawked by protesters only two
shades less intense than those who confront the Nazis
and the Klan.
Some types of raw passion are ennobling and uplift
ing: the love for another person or the pursuit of per
sonal excellence. Those passions are an affirmation of
the worth and potential of human beings, and thus of
the community around you and yourself. By contrast,
whose who are so self-righteous as tho shout down,
physically threaten and hate other people are only af
firming a politics of hatred and violence. They are mak
ing themselves less than human. You can see it in their
faces.
