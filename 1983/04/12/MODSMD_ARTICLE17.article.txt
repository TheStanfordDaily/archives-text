In its election endorsements, the
Daily claims SEE "seeks not to educate,
but to sway people." The only stand
SEE takes is that environmental is
sues are worth learning about.
SEE's Environmental Course Guide
is a valuable resource for students
from Biology, Civil Engineering,
Hum Bio, Earth Sciences, VTS, Eco
nomics and other majors planning
concentrations relating to energy,
ecology, and management of scarce
resources.
Last week, SEE-sponsored lectures
by David Brower, the Lovins and
Stanford professor Paul Erhlich drew
crowds of 200, 500 and 300 students.
Prof. Ehrlich explicitly cautioned
"Don't take everything I say for
grantedâ€”search out primary sources
for yourselves."
Next year, student interns, work
ing part time for minimum wage, will
help to expand and improve the
events and publications SEE presents
to the students. SEE's budget is the
result of careful planning stemming
from two years of successful experi
ence. The ASSU elections pamphlet
presents SEE's budget in full detail,
providing the opportunity for stu
dents to make their own judgments.
