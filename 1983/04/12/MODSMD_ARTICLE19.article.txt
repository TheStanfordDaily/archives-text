# Memorial Forum to help students confront troubling issues
## 
### JULIE HAGEN Staff writer 
At some time during their
college career, most students
here question their decision to
attend college, the worth of a
Stanford education and the va
lidity of their achievement
oriented goals which often ig
nore other important values.
I he direction and substance of
their personal goals becomes
uncertain and unclear. They
often question previously held
values concerning religion,
philosophy and morality. The
Chris Johnson Forum, estab
lished in the memory of Chris
Johnson who took his own life
at Stanford last May, is aimed at
helping students con front
many of these troubling ques
tions.
Last May 4, Johnson took his
own life by diving off the roof
of two-story Terra House,
where he had been a resident,
leaving his questions perma
nently unanswered.
Johnson was described by
those who knew him as "bril
liant," "a poet," a person who
"loved life" and "loved learn
ing," a person who believed in
action to accompany words, a
student with a deep desire to
understand and know, a per
son who constantly pushed
others to explore ideas, feel
ings and questions, a friend
who helped and taught many
with whom he came in contact.
Why should such a person,
at the age of 20, decide to kill
himself?
No one will ever know all the
factors which contributed to
Johnson's decision to end his
life last spring. After Johnson's
death, his parents, Francis and
Gordon Johnson, both
graduates of Stanford, spent
two and-a-half days at Terra
House trying to find out more

about the issues and questions
which concerned Chris.
What they found out led
them to believe that Johnson
was indeed not alone in his
questions. Many students
question the "mill-like" ap
proach to learning, or the im
pact of the high technology
which is espoused so strongly
in society. The transition to
college life brings with it a de
velopmental stage which con
tains many crucial decisions.
According to Asst. Dean of
Student Affairs Sylvia Castillo,
the Johnsons wanted to know
what they could do to guide
other young people through
this difficult part of their lives.
"They felt very strongly that
they needed to do something
in order to have these issues
come to the surface and for
there to be a forum for stu
dents who have these kinds of
questions and issues unan
swered to participate in, to be
able to come forward and talk
about these issues," Castillo
said.
The Johnsons subsequently
raised $18,000 through a Chris
Johnson Memorial Fund to be
used toward the establishment
of the Chris Johnson Forum.
The goal of the forum is stated
as being, "Administered by
and for Stanford students and
the University community to
enable Stanford University un
dergraduates to use their com
passion and vision to search for
truth, dispell confusion, en
gender hope and self
confidence, and prepare
themselves and their friends
for the new era of history now
breaking. The Memorial Forum
will open doors to individuals
like Christian Johnson who
search for truth, cherish free
dom and individuality and
want to make a difference in

the world."
Although the forum is de
signed to encourage discus
sion of any possible student
concern, proposed topics in
clude such questions as indi
vidual power to bring about
change, choosing a lifestyle,
the student and world affairs,
and education at Stanford,
which would be broken down
into several sub-topics includ
ing values, education for living
and faculty optimism/
pessimism. Personal writings
of Chris Johnson and favorite
readings of Johnson will form
the base for some discussion
topics, and supplement
others.
A committee, made up of
Castillo, Dr. James McClena
han, director of Cowell Stu
dent Health Center and acting
chairman of the committee,
other members of the faculty
and staff, and five students, in
cluding Brigham Johnson,
Chris' brother, currently in his
fourth year here, has been
working since January to make
the Forum a reality.
Although there have been
other student suicides at Stan
ford, this case is unique in the
follow-up by the parents. "I
think they (the Johnsons) defi
nitely felt more could have
been done by Stanford and I
think what they wanted to do
was both have something that
was a memorial, literally a
memorial, but also to raise the
sorts of issues that bothered
Chris a lot, and what connec
tion the University was in that
situation," McClenahan said.
Although changes within the
University community are one
goal of the Forum, McClena
han stressed that the Univer
sity cannot be held solely ac
countable for the issues which
disturb students, and thus the

raising of the questions may be
an even more important ser
vice of the Forum.
McClenahan said, "Around
here you hope you can tailor
the environment somewhat to
make working through those
issues a lower risk, but I don't
think there's anything the in
stitution could do to make the
problems all go away, or the
issues go away . . . it's always a
personal choice somewhere.
What you'd hope is to raise the
issues, see that others are con
cerned about them, and in that
process make some of the
other options apparent to the
person."
"I don't want to sound de
fensive. In one way, Stanford
does a lot of things; that is, it
generates pressure. It gets very
able students and they gener
ate pressure among them
selves. But it also has a very
supportive system â€” residen
tial education, R.A.'s, counsel
ing services, programs. One
side says there's a lot of sup
port, and another side says
there's a lot that centers in the
institutional system," he ad
ded.
McClenahan said he sees the
Forum as ". . . raising some
questions and seeing what we
can do about some of them,
both vis-a-vis the individual
who might have similar prob
lems, and the institution."
The particular structure,
format and content of the
Forum are yet "somewhat
nebulous," according to
Brigham Johnson. The current
committee is now looking for
people who would like to be
involved on a steering commit
tee for the academic year '83-
'84.
"There's a lot of defining still
to do in it, and it's going to
really take people who

want to do something the
University's actually con
cerned with, 'cause they know
that there's something valu
able to people's education
which is different from resi
dential education, which is
different from regular class
room education ... in that
sense it has the University's
backing. It has to find it's own
little niche and be something
that people think of as kind of
cool in the sense that its be
lievable and it means some
thing and is not just on the
level of just a bunch of talk . . .
people who are interested will
see what they can do and what
they want to do," he said.
Johnson's brother points out
that the questions and issues
were present before Johnson's
suicide, and were just as rele
vant then. It is unfortunate, but
perhaps typical, that it took
such a drastic move on the part
of one person to bring the
ideas out in the open. This
awareness of issues, he
pointed out, is a goal of the
Forum which is not directly
concerned with Johnson's de
ath.
"It's not necessarily that

Chris Johnson died here so
now we have a forum to figure
out how to change Stanford so
other people won't die here. I
don't think its necessarily
changing Stanford. It may deal
with topics such as making the
Stanford experience more
meaningful or worthwhile, or
helping make it possible to
deal with the pressures unique
to this place. It's mostly a
forum taking, for example,
some of the stuff Chris said and
wrote about as a starting place
. . . it will be cJefined as it
moves along. I see it doing
different things over tHe years,
and within the year," Brigham
lohnson added.
The members of the new
steering committee will have
the largest say in what the
Forum does, and how it does it.
Castillo stated that the Forum
was looking for creative,
thoughtful students, con
cerned about the Stanford
community and interested in
non-traditional learning op
portunities, as Johnson was.
These students would not be
selected in the traditional
application-interview-decision
process, Castillo stressed. In

an effort to find interested stu
dents, the committee will be
hosting a sherry hour at Storey
House on April 20, at whit h as
sociate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Caroline Lougee
will speak.
They will also sponsor an
essay contest, complete with
prizes, probably based on or
inspired by something
Johnson had written Rxact de
tails of the ( ontest will be avail
able at the sherry hour. The es
says are basically to give stu
dents a chance to voice their
concern over any issue,
whether at Stanford or on an
international scale.
Marie Springer, a resident of
Terra, said she believes
Johnson would have approved
of the forum. "It would fit in so
much with what fie believed,
because we are making a step
towards doing something, in
stead of just talking about it
arid being sad about it, we're
doing something. He would be
very happy that he had made a
dent and made some people
really look at something and
feel enough to do something. I
think he would be ver\ proud
of us," she said
