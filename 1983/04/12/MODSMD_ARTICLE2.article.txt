# Kennedy joins budget appeal
## 
### SID ATKINS Senior staff writer 
As a member of a 500-member group known as the
Bipartisan Budget Appeal, University President Donald
Kennedy supported a proposal for a more moderate
defense build-up and a $60 billion cut in non-defense
spending as measures to decrease the federal deficit.
The proposal was part of a two-page ad which ran last
week in the New York Times. Kennedy was one of the
many prominent U.S. citizens whose names were listed
in the ad as approving the proposal.
Other University faculty, whose names were listed as
"supporters of the bipartisan appeal on the budget
crisis" include economists Michael Boskin, Walter
Hoadlev find F_/ra Solomon
former Stanford president and current President of
the Rockefeller Foundation, Richard Lyman, is also a
member of the group.
The goal of the Bipartisan Budget Appeal as stated in
the ad is to influence President Reagan and the Congress
to reduce the fiscal budget deficit for 1985 by about $175
billion. Their program combines reductions of $60 bil
lion in non-defense spending and $25 billion in defense
spending with measures to raise an additional $60 billion
in revenue in 1985.
"We strongly urge the president and the congres
sional leadership to join together in supporting a bipar
tisan resolution that commits the nation to a more
gradual, but significant and sustained increase in the

defense budget for the next several years/' the ad reads.
Throughout this ad the group tried to emphasize that
dlefense cuts were indeed feasible without jeopardizing
t he national security. "We would respond to Soviet mili
tary expansion and our own comparative decline not by
s electing a numerically impressive figure for defense
s pending growth, but rather by asking what defense
c apability we need," the ad reads.
Kennedy was approached by the group in early Janu
ary and asked to support its proposals, according to
Marlene Wine, special assistant to the president. In the
past, he has been reluctant to take a stand on political
issues not related directly to education.
Wino that Kennedy, v.-ho wan unavailable for
comment, does not believe that this advertisement was
political in nature and confirmed that his policy is not to
make political statements. "It's just a proposal to im
prove the economy. He (Kennedy) thinks the deficit
should be reduced by even more than the ad calls for."
Boskin said that the ad was basically a "statement
about the state of the economy and what can be done to
improve it."
"It wasn't designed to further the aims of any political
personality or group, but in a sense it's political because
it differs from the current administration's views and
one cannot divorce fiscal policy from the political re
alm."
