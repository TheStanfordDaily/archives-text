# Undergrad specials provide new options

Although Stanford certainly offers
students more than just courses in
reading, writing and arithmetic, few
students are aware of the variety of
special courses open to them
through the Undergraduate Special
Program (UCS).
According to program director
Laura Selznick, the main purpose of
the UCS program is to expand cur
ricular choices available to students.
"To me the program represents a
shadow curriculum of the University
because it offers courses not avail
able elsewhere," Selznick said.
Alongwith SWOPSI and SCIRE, the
program which was initiated by fac
ulty in 1964 is now one of the extra
departmental programs under the
Dean of Humanities and Sciences.
Particular interests seem to attract
Stanford students to UCS courses.
Sophomore Sharon Boyle said of her
UCS course on the stock market,
"Nothing else at Stanford gave me
that opportunity. We used imaginary
money to test our theories, and saw
how our stocks were going up."
Junior Pam Maes described her
freshman UGS course on philosophy
as being more of a personal invest
ment than other classes. "People
took it because they were genuinely
interested. Everybody there wanted
to be there," she said.
Although any qualified individual
can propose a course, all courses
must be approved by the Under
graduate Special Committee. Ac
cording to Selznick, the committee
will not give credit for just an activity.
"The intellectual and historical com
ponents of the UCS are necessary for
its approval," she said.
Of the 23 UCS courses available for
spring quarter, eight are taught by
undergraduates and the rest by regu
lar faculty, graduate students and
other members of the community.
Senior Mike Orsak had his stu
dents take an initial screening test to
get into his course entitled, "Entre
preneurship: Managing New Ven
tures."
"Students had to submit an idea
for their own business," Orsak said.
"They were very motivated and all
had taken initiative in the past. Most
are interested in starting their own
business, and are dynamic people
who are doing things," he added.
Similarly, sophomores Frank Col
cord, Warren Habib and Cam Baker
used their UCS course on Art and
Criticism as a guide for a SWOPSI
course they later designed them
selves.
"The UGS course provided the
focal point for the intellectual at
mosphere of our SWOPSI course,"
Colcord said. "It let us group to
gether the particulars necessary for
our course to begin."
According to Selznick, a wide
range of UGS courses were actually
used as testing grounds for regular
courses within the University. "Hu
man Sexuality," the first sleep and

dreaming class, and a course on
Slavic bibliography, were all origi
nally taught as undergraduate spe
cials.
The teachers of UCS courses vary
as much in motivations and interests
as the UCS courses themselves.
Marty Pulvers, a post office em
ployee, teaches a UCS course enti
tled the "Literature of Baseball." Al
though Pulvers realizes that many
students view the idea of a baseball
course as being frivolous, he is in
terested in examining the degree to
which baseball and our culture are
integrated.
For Pulvers, teaching is exceed
ingly rewarding. "It's exciting to be
touching students' lives by exposing
them to some of the best American
literature using baseball," he said. "I

must be a pedagogue by nature, I
love it. It's easy to see how one might
become an eccentric professor, but I
think I'll gracefully avoid that," Pul
vers joked.
Although UCS courses are taught
by volunteers and instructors re
ceive no regular academic units,
many found their efforts to be worth
their time.
Senior Thomas Hahn, a biology
major, said of his course on
birdwatching, "You learn way more
from teaching it than taking it, be
cause you have to know the material
enough to be able to explain it to
someone. It's a worthwhile thing to
do."
Scott Simon, a Stanford graduate
with a double degree in economics
and English, agreed. "The caring is

there on the part of whoever
teaches," Simon said.
In addition to teaching a UCS
course on recent American fiction,
Simon also took UCS courses on
American fiction and Stock Options.
"I really had agood experience in the
first one I took. I thought, if I could
give someone what I got out of it, it
would be great," he said.
Simon found teaching to be easier
than he expected, and said he
learned just as much as his students.
"A lot of people get a lot out of it,"he
said. "The bottom line was it was
fun."
According to Selznick, the future
direction of the UGS program lies
wherever due interest takes it."The
ability to be responsive to changing
student needs and interests is impor
tant," she concluded.
