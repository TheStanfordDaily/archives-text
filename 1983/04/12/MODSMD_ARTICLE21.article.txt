## 'Maskarade,' an indoor festival, belongs outdoors 
### TONY KELLY 
I'll admit it as soon as anyone — I don't like sitting
outdoors to see a play. The decision to move a show
outside the friendly, manipulable confines of a theater,
while usually preparing for the possibility of rain, often
doesn't take into account other hazards of festival thea
ter — things like wind, cold or the poor acoustic qual
ities of open air.
It was probably on these grounds that the Drama De
partment decided to move their production of Sylvia
Wynter's new play Maskarade off the grounds of the Old
Union courtyard and back into the familiar (to them)
Nitery. And on a purely pragmatic level, the move makes
sense; but after seeing the show, one can't- help but
wonder if things wouldn't have been better outdoors.
To put the issue in blunt terms, what we have here is a
terrific production of a not-so-hot play, which is some
thing the department has been doing quite a lot this
year. But the reason behind this dichotomy is more
apparent in Maskarade than in other department pro
ductions this year, making it both better and worse —
and profoundly different — than the rest.
When a play is inside a theater the size of the Nitery,
with its crackerbox risers and you-are-there seating de
signs, you tend to notice little things (especially little
flaws) more quickly than large-scale spectacles. Which is
not to say that the place is only meant for chamber plays
(many chamber plays aren't meant to be seen any
where), but you should think a while before trying a
showy musical in there. To Wynter's and director Sandra
Richards' minds, Maskarade is more than that; the festi
val of Jonkunnu is explained in their notes to be a
"community ritual" that could be a popular model of a
new cultural revolution.
This sociopolitical game of Twenty Questions ("Is it
bigger than a banana-boat republic?"), unfortunately,
gets in the way of the show, making it a little too
academic and self-conscious for its own good.
Despite its pretensions, Maskarade is essentially a
backstage musical, complete with casting couches,
prima donas and local lovers thrown into turmoil when
the local girl makes good. Driver (James Cadena), the
leader of a traveling Jonkunnu troupe and a second-rate
Don Juan, woos Quasheba (Suzette Craft) by casting her
as his queen in the festival of 1841, ignoring the wrath of
her beau Cuffie (Cory Williams) and his own wife (Sonia
Anderson). Sure enough, the conflicts don't stay
backstage, spilling over into the festival itself. Nonethe
less, the show concludes with an affirmation of Jon
kunnu, true love, and the power of carnival.
This ending is an example of Wynter's thematic prob
lems; you know that you're supposed to see the carnival
as liberating, unifying, subject only to the democratic
laws of community freedom. Yet in Maskarade, all the
goals and hopes of the characters are patently materialis
tic: Driver's plan to buy Quasheba by naming her
queen, Quasheba's and Catha's jealous desires to be
queen, Brainsy's (Driver's sidekick, played by Keith Ar
chuleta) desires for money and respect. If this is what
Jonkunnu is about, no wonder it was banned.
What do Wynter and Richards want us to see in Mas
karade? How a carnival can be messed up by the wrong
intentions? The hazards of infidelity? Why Maroons
shouldn't be cast in battle scenes? It's impossible to say
—all that we see in the show is two and-a-half hours of
people ruining their lives for the sake of a festival, then an

extravagant celebration of that same festival spirit. This
is more than a dramatic dichotomy; it is a thematic and
conceptual imprecision that simply shouldn't happen in
a play as well executed as Maskarade.
And make no mistake, the execution is by and large
superlative. There are a couple of problems with the
acting, where the cast tends to err on the side of impas
sioned histrionics, at the same time letting their concen
tration drop when they're not speaking. But especially
with Cadena and Archuleta, there's an actorish flair that
transcends the textual difficulties. Driverand Brainsy are
actors, and so they can get away with deliveries and
gestures that seem overblown in, say, Cuffie and Maud
(played by Karen Mitchell). Archuleta is especially good,
with an outstanding voice (for speaking as well as sing
ing) and a good comic sense. He serves as a better chorus
than the chorus of villagers, who often seem present
only to fill the stage and formalize the storytelling
framework of the show (unnecessarily so). They dance
magnificently, but they really don't do much as a theatri
cal device.
As a rule, the show works best while it's using its many
levels of artifice, whether it's the framework of a legend

related by an aged storyteller or the structure of the
lonkunnu play itself. The best scenes are the most over
tly theatrical, partly because they use Cadena and Ar
chuleta (and Jim Lee, by far the show's best dancer)
more and partly because there're fewer obvious at
tempts to look and sound natural. The climactic Jon
kunnu play, for example, is far more entertaining than
the melodramatic story that precedes it, simply because
the Jonkunnu play (performed in masks and peppered
with left-field contemporary political jokes) isn't sup
posed to be real.
In a similar way, the music of the show is subtly out
standing. Under Michael Britt's direction, speeches as
well as songs are orchestrated, with two percussionists
and two drummers imposing rhythms on the actors'
voices and movements When that mixture of sound is
present, the results are remarkable, especially with
Gatha, whose three songs say more about her and the
story than any amount of text. When the percussion is
absent and the rhythms are supposedly in the actors'
voices, the speeches seem slow and a little clubfooted,
like in the slower songs by Cadena and Williams. This
again may be Wynter's problem, for she wrote the two
songs in question.

The other production values of Maskarade —
c horeography, costumes and the like — are uniformly
amazing, following the high standard of production that
the Drama Department is getting accustomed to. It's
really unfortunate that these elements at times play sec
ond fiddle to the staging and the script, the weaker parts
of Maskarade. But that's part of the price for playing the
Nitery.
Again, if this show were outdoors, none of these dis
crepancies would be as noticeable; it would be far easier
to ignore the chinks in the armor and admire the whole
glistening product if it was in a larger, more opf-n atmos
phere. This is really the first time I've seen that possibil
ity in a Drama Department production. Last quarter's
Cyclops, for example, had its thematic inconsistenci >i ,
but it was also so intricately wrapp- J in Sht closest
thing-to-a-masterpiece-that-you'll-ever-see Little
Theatre that you couldn't imagine it anywhere else. Out
side, with a little more realism in settingand a little more
artifice in dramatic presentation, Maskarade wouldn't
have to be seen warts and all; it would look more like a
celebration, rather than a slightly dry, self-conscious
reenactment of a celebration.

tic: Driver's plan to buy Quasheba by naming her
queen, Quasheba's and Catha's jealous desires to be
queen, Brainsy's (Driver's sidekick, played by Keith Ar
chuleta) desires for money and respect. If this is what
Jonkunnu is about, no wonder it was banned.
What do Wynter and Richards want us to see in Mas
karade? How a carnival can be messed up by the wrong
intentions? The hazards of infidelity? Why Maroons
shouldn't be cast in battle scenes? It's impossible to say
—all that we see in the show is two and-a-half hours of
people ruining their lives for the sake of a festival, then an

extravagant celebration of that same festival spirit. This
is more than a dramatic dichotomy; it is a thematic and
conceptual imprecision that simply shouldn't happen in
a play as well executed as Maskarade.
And make no mistake, the execution is by and large
superlative. There are a couple of problems with the
acting, where the cast tends to err on the side of impas
sioned histrionics, at the same time letting their concen
tration drop when they're not speaking. But especially
with Cadena and Archuleta, there's an actorish flair that
transcends the textual difficulties. Driverand Brainsy are
actors, and so they can get away with deliveries and
gestures that seem overblown in, say, Cuffie and Maud
(played by Karen Mitchell). Archuleta is especially good,
with an outstanding voice (for speaking as well as sing
ing) and a good comic sense. He serves as a better chorus
than the chorus of villagers, who often seem present
only to fill the stage and formalize the storytelling
framework of the show (unnecessarily so). They dance
magnificently, but they really don't do much as a theatri
cal device.
As a rule, the show works best while it's using its many
levels of artifice, whether it's the framework of a legend

related by an aged storyteller or the structure of the
lonkunnu play itself. The best scenes are the most over
tly theatrical, partly because they use Cadena and Ar
chuleta (and Jim Lee, by far the show's best dancer)
more and partly because there're fewer obvious at
tempts to look and sound natural. The climactic Jon
kunnu play, for example, is far more entertaining than
the melodramatic story that precedes it, simply because
the Jonkunnu play (performed in masks and peppered
with left-field contemporary political jokes) isn't sup
posed to be real.
In a similar way, the music of the show is subtly out
standing. Under Michael Britt's direction, speeches as
well as songs are orchestrated, with two percussionists
and two drummers imposing rhythms on the actors'
voices and movements When that mixture of sound is
present, the results are remarkable, especially with
Gatha, whose three songs say more about her and the
story than any amount of text. When the percussion is
absent and the rhythms are supposedly in the actors'
voices, the speeches seem slow and a little clubfooted,
like in the slower songs by Cadena and Williams. This
again may be Wynter's problem, for she wrote the two
songs in question.

The other production values of Maskarade —
c horeography, costumes and the like — are uniformly
amazing, following the high standard of production that
the Drama Department is getting accustomed to. It's
really unfortunate that these elements at times play sec
ond fiddle to the staging and the script, the weaker parts
of Maskarade. But that's part of the price for playing the
Nitery.
Again, if this show were outdoors, none of these dis
crepancies would be as noticeable; it would be far easier
to ignore the chinks in the armor and admire the whole
glistening product if it was in a larger, more opf-n atmos
phere. This is really the first time I've seen that possibil
ity in a Drama Department production. Last quarter's
Cyclops, for example, had its thematic inconsistenci >i ,
but it was also so intricately wrapp- J in Sht closest
thing-to-a-masterpiece-that-you'll-ever-see Little
Theatre that you couldn't imagine it anywhere else. Out
side, with a little more realism in settingand a little more
artifice in dramatic presentation, Maskarade wouldn't
have to be seen warts and all; it would look more like a
celebration, rather than a slightly dry, self-conscious
reenactment of a celebration.

I'll admit it as soon as anyone — I don't like sitting
outdoors to see a play. The decision to move a show
outside the friendly, manipulable confines of a theater,
while usually preparing for the possibility of rain, often
doesn't take into account other hazards of festival thea
ter — things like wind, cold or the poor acoustic qual
ities of open air.
It was probably on these grounds that the Drama De
partment decided to move their production of Sylvia
Wynter's new play Maskarade off the grounds of the Old
Union courtyard and back into the familiar (to them)
Nitery. And on a purely pragmatic level, the move makes
sense; but after seeing the show, one can't- help but
wonder if things wouldn't have been better outdoors.
To put the issue in blunt terms, what we have here is a
terrific production of a not-so-hot play, which is some
thing the department has been doing quite a lot this
year. But the reason behind this dichotomy is more
apparent in Maskarade than in other department pro
ductions this year, making it both better and worse —
and profoundly different — than the rest.
When a play is inside a theater the size of the Nitery,
with its crackerbox risers and you-are-there seating de
signs, you tend to notice little things (especially little
flaws) more quickly than large-scale spectacles. Which is
not to say that the place is only meant for chamber plays
(many chamber plays aren't meant to be seen any
where), but you should think a while before trying a
showy musical in there. To Wynter's and director Sandra
Richards' minds, Maskarade is more than that; the festi
val of Jonkunnu is explained in their notes to be a
"community ritual" that could be a popular model of a
new cultural revolution.
This sociopolitical game of Twenty Questions ("Is it
bigger than a banana-boat republic?"), unfortunately,
gets in the way of the show, making it a little too
academic and self-conscious for its own good.
Despite its pretensions, Maskarade is essentially a
backstage musical, complete with casting couches,
prima donas and local lovers thrown into turmoil when
the local girl makes good. Driver (James Cadena), the
leader of a traveling Jonkunnu troupe and a second-rate
Don Juan, woos Quasheba (Suzette Craft) by casting her
as his queen in the festival of 1841, ignoring the wrath of
her beau Cuffie (Cory Williams) and his own wife (Sonia
Anderson). Sure enough, the conflicts don't stay
backstage, spilling over into the festival itself. Nonethe
less, the show concludes with an affirmation of Jon
kunnu, true love, and the power of carnival.
This ending is an example of Wynter's thematic prob
lems; you know that you're supposed to see the carnival
as liberating, unifying, subject only to the democratic
laws of community freedom. Yet in Maskarade, all the
goals and hopes of the characters are patently materialis
tic: Driver's plan to buy Quasheba by naming her
queen, Quasheba's and Catha's jealous desires to be
queen, Brainsy's (Driver's sidekick, played by Keith Ar
