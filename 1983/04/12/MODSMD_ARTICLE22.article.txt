# Teens on screen: two murky views of rites of passage
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The Outsiders
There seems to be some
thing about the teenage expe
rience that resists transference
to the screen. What some tic
t ion v\ riters have done tor ado
lescent rites ot passage —
Twain in Huckleberry Finn,
Faulkner in Intruder in the
Dust, Salinger in Catcher in the
Rye, Carson Mi Cullers in The
Member of the Wedding —
screenwriters and directors
have rarely succeeded in
achieving, except, occasion
ally, at second hand. (There are
superb movie versions of both
Intruder in the Dust and The
Member of the Wedding.)
!n >rder to cater to the high
school audience, and partly,
too perhaps, because of the
iecent proliferation of gifted
young actors, more films about
teenagers have come out in the
last four years than at any other
time in Hollywood's history: A
Little Romance, The Warriors,
The Wanderers, Rich Kids,
Breaking Away, Over the Edge,
Foxes, Little Darlings, The
Great Santini, Fame, Taps, Four
Friends, Personal Best, Fast
7imes at Ridgemont High, Tex,
and now The Outsiders and
Bad Boys not to mention the
ones I haven't seen.
Of that list, only two —
Breaking Away and Personal
Best — can be discussed seri
ously as representations of
American adolescence, and in
both cases the protagonists
have passed high school age.

Some of the others contain
memorable sequences, and
almost all of them feature at
least a couple of talented ac
tors, but in general that pecul
iar balance of puerility and

maturity that is the basis of
teenage confusion rarely finds
authentic expression in the
movies that are allegedly dedi
cated to it.
i taught high school tor tive
years — mostly, I think, out ot a
compulsion to take a second
look, from a different vantage
point, at a time I found mys
terious and uncomfortable
when I had to suffer through it
and which I had never entirely
sorted out. It's still largely a
mystery to me, I confess, but I
did come away from teaching
with a renewed respect and at
fection for those who are con
fronted with all the painful
contradictions of being a teen
ager. Few of the pictures I've
mentioned manage to pre
serve the real mysteries of
these troubled years, but al
most all of them suggest
others.
The major puzzle for me in
The Outsiders is whether Fran
cis Ford Coppola, who di
rected it, S.E. Hinton, the au
thor of the novel (and several
others similar to it — all ex
tremely popular among young
readers), and Kathleen knut
sen Rowell, who adapted it.
truly believe that kids talk and
behave in the way they've por
traved them. All the characters
in The Outsiders — western
youths who belong to either
the upper crust ("Socs") or the
working class ("Greasers") —
are hooked on talking jags:
they articulate issues of friend
ship, loyalty, enmity, romance,
family and death, practically

solving all the problems of the
world in their sugary, over
explicit bull sessions. Some
times you may think you're lis
tening to the authors-device
street gangs in West Side Story,

and sometimes to The Crapes
of Wrath, because the lan
guage Hinton and Rowell have
put in these kids' mouths has a
Steinbeckian gee-gosh traudu
lence. (It might be halfway be
lievable if it were at least pep
pered with obscenities. VVhen
was the last time you heard a
16-year-old say "If you had the
sense of a billygoat" or "My
friends might think I'm off my
rocker"?)
Coppola takes pains to show
us the rough environment
these kids are growing up in,
where switchblades flash at the
slightes' provocation (and al
ways in close-up) and looking
with appreciation at a girl of the
wrong class can lead to gang
warfare* But, fanhtu! to the es
sentially soft-centered,
children's-fable conception of
Hinton's fiction, he and Rowell
have made the hero, Ponyboy
(Thomas Howell) and his
friends nice, simple kids —
Bud Andersons stuck in the
middle of a steamy, hostile
town. (A scene in which one of
the boys sits down to demolish
a chocolate cake single
handed is pure '50s TV.)
Worse: they're respectable
at the core, and such unmis

takable instinctive heroes that
they rush unthinking into a
burning schoolhouse to rescue
some young children. If the
movie had taken as its theme
the discrepancy between the
facade of toughness Ponyboy
and his buddies must adopt in
order to survive, and the ten
der, frightened kids behind it;
or between their rebellious
stance and their solidly
middle-class concerns; or be
tween their image of them
selves as hardened street
fighters and our perception of
them as sweet-natured young
sters — then The Outsiders
would really be about some
thing.

Do they truly believe that kids talk and be
have the way they've portrayed them?

But Coppola presents a hero
whose only apparent vices are
chain smoking and wearing his
hair long, who uses the hours
when he and his pal Johnny
(Ralph Macchio) are holed up
in a railroad shack to read
Gone With the Wind out loud,

and who recites Robert Frost's
"Nothing Cold Can Stay"
when he sees a sunset. (Frost
knew what he was doing, but
the filmmakers don't: they re
duce the poem to a sickening
homily that echoes through
the entire second half of the
movie. There's even a syrupy
theme song by Stevie Wonder
called "Stay Cold," and so
many lingering sunsets that
you think you're watching On
Golden Pond.) Three boys die
in thecourseofthe picture,yet
the director of The Godfather
fails to convince us that violent
death is really a possibility in
this gold-tinted world.
Many of us who consider the

two parts of The Godfather the
greatest epic film ever made by
an American may have hoped
that, after the abandoned ex
travagance of Apocalypse Now
and the insulated, inhuman
craftsmanship of One from the
Heart, Coppola might find his
way home with a pair of movies
about kids in conflict. (His sec
ond S.E. Flinton adaptation,
Rumble Fish, is due out later
this year.) But The Outsiders
suffers from Zoetrope disease,
too: it's scaled too big, and it's
too fancy and expensive for its
subject. Stephen Burum's pho
tography is so dazzling that
you're always conscious of the
way the dreamy orange light
plays on Ponyboy's anti john
ny's faces or of the differences

between the glaring, intrusive
neon look of the drive-in and
the barroom scenes and the
dark, autumnal quality of the
deserted exteriors: the camera
upstages the drama.
There's so much mist front
ing the rumble between the
Greasers and the Socs that we
might be watching the opening
of Macbeth, but the fight itself
is an anticlimax, largely be
cause Coppola hasn't built up
enough tension between these
two groups. (It's in the script,
all right, but he doesn't make
us feel it — the scene doesn't
explode, it just happens.) And
the moment when johnny be
comes a murderer is artsy and
enigmatic, so that we can't fol
low the action, let alone un
derstand what caused it. Cop
pola really must have got lost in
that jungle in Apocalypse Now
— he's forgotten how to say
anything simply.
The Outsiders contains one
astonishing moment — in a
nightmare, Ponyboy relives his
parents' death in a car acci
dent, and the image expands as
if seen suddenly through a dis
torted mirror — and a couple
of relaxed, funny bits by tmilio
Estevez (as Two-Bit) and Matt
Dillon (as Dallas). Given the
plum role, the authentic tough
all the other Greasers regard
with a mixture of awe and fear,
Matt Dillon redeems every
scene he can. At first, he's like
a juvenile version of Brando at
his most playful, ur De Niro in
the jokey parts of Mean Streets,
so gleefully cognizant of the
impression he's making that
his grinning promise of hell
raising is an irresistible invita
tion. (He doesn't recite Robert
Frost.) The last sequences
allow him to reveal what under
lies Dallas's bravado, and he's
magnificent — until Coppola
layson the heavy visual artillery
and sabotages his perform
ance.
It's ironic that throughout
the picture, Coppola relies on
young actors without enough
skill to carry off the long takes
and brutally tight close-ups he
insists on employing, but when
he gets hold of an actor who
really could be the poet of ado
lescent contusion and trapped
sensitivity, he wrecks his big
scene by turning it into over
scaled, overwrought film noir.
Still, Matt Dillon walks off with
the picture — and with more
self-assurance than he's ever
shown before.
Bad Boys
If The Outsiders can boast
Matt Dillon, Bad Boys has Sean
Penn. Without speaking three
consecutive sentences, Penn
(who played the amiable
stoner, Spicoli, in Fast Times at
Ridgemont High) gives a stun
ning performance. He plays
Mick O'Brien, a young Chicago
punk who ends up in a juvenile
detention center when his ef
forts to intercept a dope deal

and make off with the goods
himself lead to a shootout. The
glaze in Mick's eyes is both a
balm for the pain you ran see
just beneath it and a guard rail
that keeps him locked inside
and keeps intruders out. With
his hair long and flowing and
his body graceful yet tense —
held in check — he has an es
tranged, Indian beauty, a
genuine nobility.
When Mick learns that his
enemy (Esai Morales) has
beaten and raped his girl friend
(the preposterously aristocra
tic Ally Sheedy), Penn makes
his suffering so eloquent and
dignified that we want to si
lence the busybody counselor
(Reni Santoni) who tries to in
trude on his privacy and force
him to voice his feelings. Can't
he see what Mick is going
through without having it spel
led out for him? The writer of
Bad Boys, Richard Di Lello,
can't figure out what to do with
Mick (he certainly can't seem
to write dialogue for him), but
Penn's understanding of the
character triumphs over Di Lel
lo's inadequacies.
Bud Boys is a strong movie,
but most of its power derives
from the violence in it, which
erupts out of so much tension
in the Rainford juvenile Facility
scenes that it's almost a relief. I
didn't enjoy watching this
movie, though I was certainly
wrapped up in it: the director,
Richard Rosenthal, has some
talent for structuring a drama
tic situation and for creating a
distinctive environment. (He
received expert assistance
from the production designer,
J. Michael Riva, and the photo
graphers, Bruce Surtees and
Donald Thorin.)
But once Mick has been shut
up inside Rainford, the inevit
able series of violent encoun
ters and jockeyings for power
between the inmates deter
mines the pattern of the rest of
the movie. There are no sur
prises (except, perhaps,for the
final scene, which is cleverly
accomplished) — and our
knowledge that we can expect
the worst at every turn makes
the picture hard going. It's set
up so that we cheer when
Mick's cellmate, a malevolent
genius named Horowitz (Erie
Gurry of Author! Author/, in
another incarnation of the
teenager as wisecracking
midget), rigs a radio to blow
up, injuring a bully who's out
to get Mick.
And I'm not sure that Ro
senthal and Di Lello can en
tirely be blamed for this kind of
manipulation, either — it's
probably inherent in the kind
of material they're working on.
But they certainly don't solve
any of its problems, nor do
they succeed in removing it
very far from its roots: Bad
Boys is just a more savage and
contemporary revamping of
the Warner Brothers prison
pictures of the 19305.

Heart, Coppola might find his
way home with a pair of movies
about kids in conflict. (His sec
ond S.E. Flinton adaptation,
Rumble Fish, is due out later
this year.) But The Outsiders
suffers from Zoetrope disease,
too: it's scaled too big, and it's
too fancy and expensive for its
subject. Stephen Burum's pho
tography is so dazzling that
you're always conscious of the
way the dreamy orange light
plays on Ponyboy's anti john
ny's faces or of the differences

between the glaring, intrusive
neon look of the drive-in and
the barroom scenes and the
dark, autumnal quality of the
deserted exteriors: the camera
upstages the drama.
There's so much mist front
ing the rumble between the
Greasers and the Socs that we
might be watching the opening
of Macbeth, but the fight itself
is an anticlimax, largely be
cause Coppola hasn't built up
enough tension between these
two groups. (It's in the script,
all right, but he doesn't make
us feel it — the scene doesn't
explode, it just happens.) And
the moment when johnny be
comes a murderer is artsy and
enigmatic, so that we can't fol
low the action, let alone un
derstand what caused it. Cop
pola really must have got lost in
that jungle in Apocalypse Now
— he's forgotten how to say
anything simply.
The Outsiders contains one
astonishing moment — in a
nightmare, Ponyboy relives his
parents' death in a car acci
dent, and the image expands as
if seen suddenly through a dis
torted mirror — and a couple
of relaxed, funny bits by tmilio
Estevez (as Two-Bit) and Matt
Dillon (as Dallas). Given the
plum role, the authentic tough
all the other Greasers regard
with a mixture of awe and fear,
Matt Dillon redeems every
scene he can. At first, he's like
a juvenile version of Brando at
his most playful, ur De Niro in
the jokey parts of Mean Streets,
so gleefully cognizant of the
impression he's making that
his grinning promise of hell
raising is an irresistible invita
tion. (He doesn't recite Robert
Frost.) The last sequences
allow him to reveal what under
lies Dallas's bravado, and he's
magnificent — until Coppola
layson the heavy visual artillery
and sabotages his perform
ance.
It's ironic that throughout
the picture, Coppola relies on
young actors without enough
skill to carry off the long takes
and brutally tight close-ups he
insists on employing, but when
he gets hold of an actor who
really could be the poet of ado
lescent contusion and trapped
sensitivity, he wrecks his big
scene by turning it into over
scaled, overwrought film noir.
Still, Matt Dillon walks off with
the picture — and with more
self-assurance than he's ever
shown before.
Bad Boys
If The Outsiders can boast
Matt Dillon, Bad Boys has Sean
Penn. Without speaking three
consecutive sentences, Penn
(who played the amiable
stoner, Spicoli, in Fast Times at
Ridgemont High) gives a stun
ning performance. He plays
Mick O'Brien, a young Chicago
punk who ends up in a juvenile
detention center when his ef
forts to intercept a dope deal

and make off with the goods
himself lead to a shootout. The
glaze in Mick's eyes is both a
balm for the pain you ran see
just beneath it and a guard rail
that keeps him locked inside
and keeps intruders out. With
his hair long and flowing and
his body graceful yet tense —
held in check — he has an es
tranged, Indian beauty, a
genuine nobility.
When Mick learns that his
enemy (Esai Morales) has
beaten and raped his girl friend
(the preposterously aristocra
tic Ally Sheedy), Penn makes
his suffering so eloquent and
dignified that we want to si
lence the busybody counselor
(Reni Santoni) who tries to in
trude on his privacy and force
him to voice his feelings. Can't
he see what Mick is going
through without having it spel
led out for him? The writer of
Bad Boys, Richard Di Lello,
can't figure out what to do with
Mick (he certainly can't seem
to write dialogue for him), but
Penn's understanding of the
character triumphs over Di Lel
lo's inadequacies.
Bud Boys is a strong movie,
but most of its power derives
from the violence in it, which
erupts out of so much tension
in the Rainford juvenile Facility
scenes that it's almost a relief. I
didn't enjoy watching this
movie, though I was certainly
wrapped up in it: the director,
Richard Rosenthal, has some
talent for structuring a drama
tic situation and for creating a
distinctive environment. (He
received expert assistance
from the production designer,
J. Michael Riva, and the photo
graphers, Bruce Surtees and
Donald Thorin.)
But once Mick has been shut
up inside Rainford, the inevit
able series of violent encoun
ters and jockeyings for power
between the inmates deter
mines the pattern of the rest of
the movie. There are no sur
prises (except, perhaps,for the
final scene, which is cleverly
accomplished) — and our
knowledge that we can expect
the worst at every turn makes
the picture hard going. It's set
up so that we cheer when
Mick's cellmate, a malevolent
genius named Horowitz (Erie
Gurry of Author! Author/, in
another incarnation of the
teenager as wisecracking
midget), rigs a radio to blow
up, injuring a bully who's out
to get Mick.
And I'm not sure that Ro
senthal and Di Lello can en
tirely be blamed for this kind of
manipulation, either — it's
probably inherent in the kind
of material they're working on.
But they certainly don't solve
any of its problems, nor do
they succeed in removing it
very far from its roots: Bad
Boys is just a more savage and
contemporary revamping of
the Warner Brothers prison
pictures of the 19305.



Matt Dillon in Outsiders

Sean Penn in Bad Boys
The Outsiders
There seems to be some
thing about the teenage expe
rience that resists transference
to the screen. What some tic
t ion v\ riters have done tor ado
lescent rites ot passage —
Twain in Huckleberry Finn,
Faulkner in Intruder in the
Dust, Salinger in Catcher in the
Rye, Carson Mi Cullers in The
Member of the Wedding —
screenwriters and directors
have rarely succeeded in
achieving, except, occasion
ally, at second hand. (There are
superb movie versions of both
Intruder in the Dust and The
Member of the Wedding.)
!n >rder to cater to the high
school audience, and partly,
too perhaps, because of the
iecent proliferation of gifted
young actors, more films about
teenagers have come out in the
last four years than at any other
time in Hollywood's history: A
Little Romance, The Warriors,
The Wanderers, Rich Kids,
Breaking Away, Over the Edge,
Foxes, Little Darlings, The
Great Santini, Fame, Taps, Four
Friends, Personal Best, Fast
7imes at Ridgemont High, Tex,
and now The Outsiders and
Bad Boys not to mention the
ones I haven't seen.
Of that list, only two —
Breaking Away and Personal
Best — can be discussed seri
ously as representations of
American adolescence, and in
both cases the protagonists
have passed high school age.

Some of the others contain
memorable sequences, and
almost all of them feature at
least a couple of talented ac
tors, but in general that pecul
iar balance of puerility and

maturity that is the basis of
teenage confusion rarely finds
authentic expression in the
movies that are allegedly dedi
cated to it.
i taught high school tor tive
years — mostly, I think, out ot a
compulsion to take a second
look, from a different vantage
point, at a time I found mys
terious and uncomfortable
when I had to suffer through it
and which I had never entirely
sorted out. It's still largely a
mystery to me, I confess, but I
did come away from teaching
with a renewed respect and at
fection for those who are con
fronted with all the painful
contradictions of being a teen
ager. Few of the pictures I've
mentioned manage to pre
serve the real mysteries of
these troubled years, but al
most all of them suggest
others.
The major puzzle for me in
The Outsiders is whether Fran
cis Ford Coppola, who di
rected it, S.E. Hinton, the au
thor of the novel (and several
others similar to it — all ex
tremely popular among young
readers), and Kathleen knut
sen Rowell, who adapted it.
truly believe that kids talk and
behave in the way they've por
traved them. All the characters
in The Outsiders — western
youths who belong to either
the upper crust ("Socs") or the
working class ("Greasers") —
are hooked on talking jags:
they articulate issues of friend
ship, loyalty, enmity, romance,
family and death, practically

solving all the problems of the
world in their sugary, over
explicit bull sessions. Some
times you may think you're lis
tening to the authors-device
street gangs in West Side Story,

and sometimes to The Crapes
of Wrath, because the lan
guage Hinton and Rowell have
put in these kids' mouths has a
Steinbeckian gee-gosh traudu
lence. (It might be halfway be
lievable if it were at least pep
pered with obscenities. VVhen
was the last time you heard a
16-year-old say "If you had the
sense of a billygoat" or "My
friends might think I'm off my
rocker"?)
Coppola takes pains to show
us the rough environment
these kids are growing up in,
where switchblades flash at the
slightes' provocation (and al
ways in close-up) and looking
with appreciation at a girl of the
wrong class can lead to gang
warfare* But, fanhtu! to the es
sentially soft-centered,
children's-fable conception of
Hinton's fiction, he and Rowell
have made the hero, Ponyboy
(Thomas Howell) and his
friends nice, simple kids —
Bud Andersons stuck in the
middle of a steamy, hostile
town. (A scene in which one of
the boys sits down to demolish
a chocolate cake single
handed is pure '50s TV.)
Worse: they're respectable
at the core, and such unmis

takable instinctive heroes that
they rush unthinking into a
burning schoolhouse to rescue
some young children. If the
movie had taken as its theme
the discrepancy between the
facade of toughness Ponyboy
and his buddies must adopt in
order to survive, and the ten
der, frightened kids behind it;
or between their rebellious
stance and their solidly
middle-class concerns; or be
tween their image of them
selves as hardened street
fighters and our perception of
them as sweet-natured young
sters — then The Outsiders
would really be about some
thing.

Do they truly believe that kids talk and be
have the way they've portrayed them?

But Coppola presents a hero
whose only apparent vices are
chain smoking and wearing his
hair long, who uses the hours
when he and his pal Johnny
(Ralph Macchio) are holed up
in a railroad shack to read
Gone With the Wind out loud,

and who recites Robert Frost's
"Nothing Cold Can Stay"
when he sees a sunset. (Frost
knew what he was doing, but
the filmmakers don't: they re
duce the poem to a sickening
homily that echoes through
the entire second half of the
movie. There's even a syrupy
theme song by Stevie Wonder
called "Stay Cold," and so
many lingering sunsets that
you think you're watching On
Golden Pond.) Three boys die
in thecourseofthe picture,yet
the director of The Godfather
fails to convince us that violent
death is really a possibility in
this gold-tinted world.
Many of us who consider the

two parts of The Godfather the
greatest epic film ever made by
an American may have hoped
that, after the abandoned ex
travagance of Apocalypse Now
and the insulated, inhuman
craftsmanship of One from the
Heart, Coppola might find his
way home with a pair of movies
about kids in conflict. (His sec
ond S.E. Flinton adaptation,
Rumble Fish, is due out later
this year.) But The Outsiders
suffers from Zoetrope disease,
too: it's scaled too big, and it's
too fancy and expensive for its
subject. Stephen Burum's pho
tography is so dazzling that
you're always conscious of the
way the dreamy orange light
plays on Ponyboy's anti john
ny's faces or of the differences

between the glaring, intrusive
neon look of the drive-in and
the barroom scenes and the
dark, autumnal quality of the
deserted exteriors: the camera
upstages the drama.
There's so much mist front
ing the rumble between the
Greasers and the Socs that we
might be watching the opening
of Macbeth, but the fight itself
is an anticlimax, largely be
cause Coppola hasn't built up
enough tension between these
two groups. (It's in the script,
all right, but he doesn't make
us feel it — the scene doesn't
explode, it just happens.) And
the moment when johnny be

enigmatic, so that we can't fol
low the action, let alone un
derstand what caused it. Cop
pola really must have got lost in
that jungle in Apocalypse Now
— he's forgotten how to say
anything simply.
The Outsiders contains one
astonishing moment — in a
nightmare, Ponyboy relives his
parents' death in a car acci

if seen suddenly through a dis
torted mirror — and a couple

rience that resists transference
to the screen. What some tic
t ion v\ riters have done tor ado
lescent rites ot passage —
Twain in Huckleberry Finn,
Faulkner in Intruder in the
Dust, Salinger in Catcher in the
Rye, Carson Mi Cullers in The
Member of the Wedding —
screenwriters and directors
have rarely succeeded in
achieving, except, occasion
ally, at second hand. (There are
superb movie versions of both
Intruder in the Dust and The
Member of the Wedding.)
!n >rder to cater to the high
school audience, and partly,
too perhaps, because of the
iecent proliferation of gifted
young actors, more films about
teenagers have come out in the
last four years than at any other
time in Hollywood's history: A
Little Romance, The Warriors,
The Wanderers, Rich Kids,
Breaking Away, Over the Edge,
Foxes, Little Darlings, The
Great Santini, Fame, Taps, Four
Friends, Personal Best, Fast
7imes at Ridgemont High, Tex,
and now The Outsiders and
Bad Boys not to mention the
ones I haven't seen.
Of that list, only two —
Breaking Away and Personal
Best — can be discussed seri
ously as representations of
American adolescence, and in
both cases the protagonists
have passed high school age.

Some of the others contain
memorable sequences, and
almost all of them feature at
least a couple of talented ac
tors, but in general that pecul
iar balance of puerility and

maturity that is the basis of
teenage confusion rarely finds
authentic expression in the
movies that are allegedly dedi
cated to it.
i taught high school tor tive
years — mostly, I think, out ot a
compulsion to take a second
look, from a different vantage
point, at a time I found mys
terious and uncomfortable
when I had to suffer through it
and which I had never entirely
sorted out. It's still largely a
mystery to me, I confess, but I
did come away from teaching
with a renewed respect and at
fection for those who are con
fronted with all the painful
contradictions of being a teen
ager. Few of the pictures I've
mentioned manage to pre
serve the real mysteries of
these troubled years, but al
most all of them suggest
others.
The major puzzle for me in
The Outsiders is whether Fran
cis Ford Coppola, who di
rected it, S.E. Hinton, the au
thor of the novel (and several
others similar to it — all ex
tremely popular among young
readers), and Kathleen knut
sen Rowell, who adapted it.
truly believe that kids talk and
behave in the way they've por
traved them. All the characters
in The Outsiders — western
youths who belong to either
the upper crust ("Socs") or the
working class ("Greasers") —
are hooked on talking jags:
they articulate issues of friend
ship, loyalty, enmity, romance,
family and death, practically

solving all the problems of the
world in their sugary, over
explicit bull sessions. Some
times you may think you're lis
tening to the authors-device
street gangs in West Side Story,

and sometimes to The Crapes
of Wrath, because the lan
guage Hinton and Rowell have
put in these kids' mouths has a
Steinbeckian gee-gosh traudu
lence. (It might be halfway be
lievable if it were at least pep
pered with obscenities. VVhen
was the last time you heard a
16-year-old say "If you had the
sense of a billygoat" or "My
friends might think I'm off my
rocker"?)
Coppola takes pains to show
us the rough environment
these kids are growing up in,
where switchblades flash at the
slightes' provocation (and al
ways in close-up) and looking
with appreciation at a girl of the
wrong class can lead to gang
warfare* But, fanhtu! to the es
sentially soft-centered,
children's-fable conception of
Hinton's fiction, he and Rowell
have made the hero, Ponyboy
(Thomas Howell) and his
friends nice, simple kids —
Bud Andersons stuck in the
middle of a steamy, hostile
town. (A scene in which one of
the boys sits down to demolish
a chocolate cake single
handed is pure '50s TV.)
Worse: they're respectable
at the core, and such unmis

takable instinctive heroes that
they rush unthinking into a
burning schoolhouse to rescue
some young children. If the
movie had taken as its theme
the discrepancy between the
facade of toughness Ponyboy
and his buddies must adopt in
order to survive, and the ten
der, frightened kids behind it;
or between their rebellious
stance and their solidly
middle-class concerns; or be
tween their image of them
selves as hardened street
fighters and our perception of
them as sweet-natured young
sters — then The Outsiders
would really be about some
thing.

Do they truly believe that kids talk and be
have the way they've portrayed them?

But Coppola presents a hero
whose only apparent vices are
chain smoking and wearing his
hair long, who uses the hours
when he and his pal Johnny
(Ralph Macchio) are holed up
in a railroad shack to read
Gone With the Wind out loud,

and who recites Robert Frost's
"Nothing Cold Can Stay"
when he sees a sunset. (Frost
knew what he was doing, but
the filmmakers don't: they re
duce the poem to a sickening
homily that echoes through
the entire second half of the
movie. There's even a syrupy
theme song by Stevie Wonder
called "Stay Cold," and so
many lingering sunsets that
you think you're watching On
Golden Pond.) Three boys die
in thecourseofthe picture,yet
the director of The Godfather
fails to convince us that violent
death is really a possibility in
this gold-tinted world.
Many of us who consider the

two parts of The Godfather the
greatest epic film ever made by
an American may have hoped
that, after the abandoned ex
travagance of Apocalypse Now
and the insulated, inhuman
craftsmanship of One from the
Heart, Coppola might find his
way home with a pair of movies
about kids in conflict. (His sec
ond S.E. Flinton adaptation,
Rumble Fish, is due out later
this year.) But The Outsiders
suffers from Zoetrope disease,
too: it's scaled too big, and it's
too fancy and expensive for its
subject. Stephen Burum's pho
tography is so dazzling that
you're always conscious of the
way the dreamy orange light
plays on Ponyboy's anti john
ny's faces or of the differences

between the glaring, intrusive
neon look of the drive-in and
the barroom scenes and the
dark, autumnal quality of the
deserted exteriors: the camera
upstages the drama.
There's so much mist front
ing the rumble between the
Greasers and the Socs that we
might be watching the opening
of Macbeth, but the fight itself
is an anticlimax, largely be
cause Coppola hasn't built up
enough tension between these
two groups. (It's in the script,
all right, but he doesn't make
us feel it — the scene doesn't
explode, it just happens.) And
the moment when johnny be
comes a murderer is artsy and
enigmatic, so that we can't fol
low the action, let alone un
derstand what caused it. Cop
pola really must have got lost in
that jungle in Apocalypse Now
— he's forgotten how to say
anything simply.
The Outsiders contains one
astonishing moment — in a
nightmare, Ponyboy relives his
parents' death in a car acci
dent, and the image expands as
if seen suddenly through a dis
torted mirror — and a couple
of relaxed, funny bits by tmilio
Estevez (as Two-Bit) and Matt
Dillon (as Dallas). Given the
plum role, the authentic tough
all the other Greasers regard
with a mixture of awe and fear,
Matt Dillon redeems every
scene he can. At first, he's like
a juvenile version of Brando at
his most playful, ur De Niro in
the jokey parts of Mean Streets,
so gleefully cognizant of the
impression he's making that
his grinning promise of hell
raising is an irresistible invita
tion. (He doesn't recite Robert
Frost.) The last sequences
allow him to reveal what under
lies Dallas's bravado, and he's
magnificent — until Coppola
layson the heavy visual artillery
and sabotages his perform
ance.
It's ironic that throughout
the picture, Coppola relies on
young actors without enough
skill to carry off the long takes
and brutally tight close-ups he
insists on employing, but when
he gets hold of an actor who
really could be the poet of ado
lescent contusion and trapped
sensitivity, he wrecks his big
scene by turning it into over
scaled, overwrought film noir.
Still, Matt Dillon walks off with
the picture — and with more
self-assurance than he's ever
shown before.
Bad Boys
If The Outsiders can boast
Matt Dillon, Bad Boys has Sean
Penn. Without speaking three
consecutive sentences, Penn
(who played the amiable
stoner, Spicoli, in Fast Times at
Ridgemont High) gives a stun
ning performance. He plays
Mick O'Brien, a young Chicago
punk who ends up in a juvenile
detention center when his ef
forts to intercept a dope deal

and make off with the goods
himself lead to a shootout. The
glaze in Mick's eyes is both a
balm for the pain you ran see
just beneath it and a guard rail
that keeps him locked inside
and keeps intruders out. With
his hair long and flowing and
his body graceful yet tense —
held in check — he has an es
tranged, Indian beauty, a
genuine nobility.
When Mick learns that his
enemy (Esai Morales) has
beaten and raped his girl friend
(the preposterously aristocra
tic Ally Sheedy), Penn makes
his suffering so eloquent and
dignified that we want to si
lence the busybody counselor
(Reni Santoni) who tries to in
trude on his privacy and force
him to voice his feelings. Can't
he see what Mick is going
through without having it spel
led out for him? The writer of
Bad Boys, Richard Di Lello,
can't figure out what to do with
Mick (he certainly can't seem
to write dialogue for him), but
Penn's understanding of the
character triumphs over Di Lel
lo's inadequacies.
Bud Boys is a strong movie,
but most of its power derives
from the violence in it, which
erupts out of so much tension
in the Rainford juvenile Facility
scenes that it's almost a relief. I
didn't enjoy watching this
movie, though I was certainly
wrapped up in it: the director,
Richard Rosenthal, has some
talent for structuring a drama
tic situation and for creating a
distinctive environment. (He
received expert assistance
from the production designer,
J. Michael Riva, and the photo
graphers, Bruce Surtees and
Donald Thorin.)
But once Mick has been shut
up inside Rainford, the inevit
able series of violent encoun
ters and jockeyings for power
between the inmates deter
mines the pattern of the rest of
the movie. There are no sur
prises (except, perhaps,for the
final scene, which is cleverly
accomplished) — and our
knowledge that we can expect
the worst at every turn makes
the picture hard going. It's set
up so that we cheer when
Mick's cellmate, a malevolent
genius named Horowitz (Erie
Gurry of Author! Author/, in
another incarnation of the
teenager as wisecracking
midget), rigs a radio to blow
up, injuring a bully who's out
to get Mick.
And I'm not sure that Ro
senthal and Di Lello can en
tirely be blamed for this kind of
manipulation, either — it's
probably inherent in the kind
of material they're working on.
But they certainly don't solve
any of its problems, nor do
they succeed in removing it
very far from its roots: Bad
Boys is just a more savage and
contemporary revamping of
the Warner Brothers prison
pictures of the 19305.

ond S.E. Flinton adaptation,
Rumble Fish, is due out later
this year.) But The Outsiders
suffers from Zoetrope disease,
too: it's scaled too big, and it's
too fancy and expensive for its
subject. Stephen Burum's pho
tography is so dazzling that
you're always conscious of the
way the dreamy orange light
plays on Ponyboy's anti john
ny's faces or of the differences

between the glaring, intrusive
neon look of the drive-in and
the barroom scenes and the
dark, autumnal quality of the
deserted exteriors: the camera
upstages the drama.
There's so much mist front
ing the rumble between the
Greasers and the Socs that we
might be watching the opening
of Macbeth, but the fight itself
is an anticlimax, largely be
cause Coppola hasn't built up
enough tension between these
two groups. (It's in the script,
all right, but he doesn't make
us feel it — the scene doesn't
explode, it just happens.) And
the moment when johnny be
comes a murderer is artsy and
enigmatic, so that we can't fol
low the action, let alone un
derstand what caused it. Cop
pola really must have got lost in
that jungle in Apocalypse Now
— he's forgotten how to say
anything simply.
The Outsiders contains one
astonishing moment — in a
nightmare, Ponyboy relives his
parents' death in a car acci
dent, and the image expands as
if seen suddenly through a dis
torted mirror — and a couple
of relaxed, funny bits by tmilio
Estevez (as Two-Bit) and Matt
Dillon (as Dallas). Given the
plum role, the authentic tough
all the other Greasers regard
with a mixture of awe and fear,
Matt Dillon redeems every
scene he can. At first, he's like
a juvenile version of Brando at
his most playful, ur De Niro in
the jokey parts of Mean Streets,
so gleefully cognizant of the
impression he's making that
his grinning promise of hell
raising is an irresistible invita
tion. (He doesn't recite Robert
Frost.) The last sequences
allow him to reveal what under
lies Dallas's bravado, and he's
magnificent — until Coppola
layson the heavy visual artillery
and sabotages his perform
ance.
It's ironic that throughout
the picture, Coppola relies on
young actors without enough
skill to carry off the long takes
and brutally tight close-ups he
insists on employing, but when
he gets hold of an actor who
really could be the poet of ado
lescent contusion and trapped
sensitivity, he wrecks his big
scene by turning it into over
scaled, overwrought film noir.
Still, Matt Dillon walks off with
the picture — and with more
self-assurance than he's ever
shown before.
Bad Boys
If The Outsiders can boast
Matt Dillon, Bad Boys has Sean
Penn. Without speaking three
consecutive sentences, Penn
(who played the amiable
stoner, Spicoli, in Fast Times at
Ridgemont High) gives a stun
ning performance. He plays
Mick O'Brien, a young Chicago
punk who ends up in a juvenile
detention center when his ef
forts to intercept a dope deal

and make off with the goods
himself lead to a shootout. The
glaze in Mick's eyes is both a
balm for the pain you ran see
just beneath it and a guard rail
that keeps him locked inside
and keeps intruders out. With
his hair long and flowing and
his body graceful yet tense —
held in check — he has an es
tranged, Indian beauty, a
genuine nobility.
When Mick learns that his
enemy (Esai Morales) has
beaten and raped his girl friend
(the preposterously aristocra
tic Ally Sheedy), Penn makes
his suffering so eloquent and
dignified that we want to si
lence the busybody counselor
(Reni Santoni) who tries to in
trude on his privacy and force
him to voice his feelings. Can't
he see what Mick is going
through without having it spel
led out for him? The writer of
Bad Boys, Richard Di Lello,
can't figure out what to do with
Mick (he certainly can't seem
to write dialogue for him), but
Penn's understanding of the
character triumphs over Di Lel
lo's inadequacies.
Bud Boys is a strong movie,
but most of its power derives
from the violence in it, which
erupts out of so much tension
in the Rainford juvenile Facility
scenes that it's almost a relief. I
didn't enjoy watching this
movie, though I was certainly
wrapped up in it: the director,
Richard Rosenthal, has some
talent for structuring a drama
tic situation and for creating a
distinctive environment. (He
received expert assistance
from the production designer,
J. Michael Riva, and the photo
graphers, Bruce Surtees and
Donald Thorin.)
But once Mick has been shut
up inside Rainford, the inevit
able series of violent encoun
ters and jockeyings for power
between the inmates deter
mines the pattern of the rest of
the movie. There are no sur
prises (except, perhaps,for the
final scene, which is cleverly
accomplished) — and our
knowledge that we can expect
the worst at every turn makes
the picture hard going. It's set
up so that we cheer when
Mick's cellmate, a malevolent
genius named Horowitz (Erie
Gurry of Author! Author/, in
another incarnation of the
teenager as wisecracking
midget), rigs a radio to blow
up, injuring a bully who's out
to get Mick.
And I'm not sure that Ro
senthal and Di Lello can en
tirely be blamed for this kind of
manipulation, either — it's
probably inherent in the kind
of material they're working on.
But they certainly don't solve
any of its problems, nor do
they succeed in removing it
very far from its roots: Bad
Boys is just a more savage and
contemporary revamping of
the Warner Brothers prison
pictures of the 19305.
