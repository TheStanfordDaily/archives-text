# 'Meaning of Life'â€”if you've got the guts to take it
## 
### RICHARD KYLBERG 
Monty Python's The
Meaning of Life
While some films seek our
hearts, others capture our
minds, and Monty Python's
The Meaning of Life, currently
at the Guild, flies with a ven
geance to our stomachs to
create a visceral collage of
laughter, disgust and popcorn
consumed during the film's
tedious moments.
The Pythons, six of Britain's
most acclaimed comedians,
slice life into 100 minutes and
eight parts (or six if you can
find any similarity in 1A and IB
or6Aand6B)inan effort to find
meaning in life, if not their
film, and to unsettle their vie
wers' stomachs.
Primarily we ache from
laughter. The film allows us to
laugh at the Pythons, at the En
glish, at Americans, and indi
vidually at ourselves. For those
who view the film to answer
the definitive question, the
Pythons adeptly reveal with
uncanny insight that life's
meaning has something to do
with fish and a lot to do with
bodily excretions.
Still, if fish and excretions
don't in and of themselves
make you laugh, the film is
loaded with enough quick and
clever social satire to delight
even the most puritanical vie

wer. After John Cleese de'ivers
a child to a woman who asks
what sex her baby is, he rapidly
responds, "A little early to be
imposing sex roles, now, isn't
it?" Also, the Pythons draw the
only logical conclusion to a
sketch portraying a general be
fore a military chart stating, "If
we don't need an army, may
God strike me down."
In addition to the laughter,
however, your stomach will
most likely hurt from disgust.
And of stomachs, yours hasn't
churned until you've seen
someone else's explode. Gal
lons of blood and vomit mixed
with intestinal tracts and lop
ped off limbs grow wearisome

after a time, whether tossed
around by a Dawn of the Dead
zombie or a Meaning of Life
Python. Regardless, in keeping
with Life of Brian and Monty
Python and the Holy Grail, it is
a fact of their humor that the
Pythons seem to maintain that
the best offense lies in the

strongly offensive, and The
Meaning of Life proves no ex
ception.
Finally, your stomach will
suffer if you eat popcorn dur
ing the film's dull moments.
The Pythons are at their best
when they are brisk, and much
of this film simply drags on.

When the impoverished
Catholic sector of Yorkshire
dances in the street singing
"Every Sperm is Sacred" as if in
a Dr. Pepper commercial, al
though it may be funny at first,
the joke is worn out after the
first three minutes and we wish
it would stop. The Pythons
elongate some of the film's
worst segments as if they know
that they are bad, and are try
ing to somehow salvage them
through repetition.
The Pythons' years of enter
taining experience is reflected
in the high quality of their act
ing, as they frequently seem to
respond to the film viewers as
if performing on stage before a

live audience. The Pythons ap
pear to somehow know when
their viewers are laughing, and
adjust the film's excitement
and pate accordingly. Geese's
performance is particularly
outstanding, as he comes
across as the only Python in
control of the film, as well as
the only one who apparently
understands what is going on.
Admirers of Cleese will delight
when he cleverly assumes a
Basil Fawlty (from Fawlty Tow
ers) type of character in the
film's restaurant scenes.
Terry Gilliam, the only
American Python, again works
wonders with his animation.
His special sequences add not
only humor, but some coher
ence to the film. In the final
series, the Pythons attempt to
interrelate the sketches into
some semblance of an integral
whole which might not be pos
sible without the subtle in
sights and mood afforded by
Gilliam's animation earlier in
the film. At least these special
sequences won't make your
stomach hurt.
Monty Python's Ihe Mean
ing of Life is very entertaining
and truly worth seeing, even if
occasionally offensive and
tedious. If 1979's Life of Brian
could be a runner-up in the
New York Times' annual 10
Best films list, then the Mean
ing of Life should this year
make the 10, as it is to date one
of tfie Pythons' best efforts.

sights and mood afforded by
Gilliam's animation earlier in
the film. At least these special
sequences won't make your
stomach hurt.
Monty Python's Ihe Mean

and truly worth seeing, even if
occasionally offensive and
tedious. If 1979's Life of Brian
could be a runner-up in the
New York Times' annual 10
Best films list, then the Mean

make the 10, as it is to date one

Monty Python's The
Meaning of Life
While some films seek our
hearts, others capture our
minds, and Monty Python's
The Meaning of Life, currently
at the Guild, flies with a ven
geance to our stomachs to
create a visceral collage of
laughter, disgust and popcorn
consumed during the film's
tedious moments.
The Pythons, six of Britain's
most acclaimed comedians,
slice life into 100 minutes and
eight parts (or six if you can
find any similarity in 1A and IB
or6Aand6B)inan effort to find
meaning in life, if not their
film, and to unsettle their vie
wers' stomachs.
Primarily we ache from
laughter. The film allows us to
laugh at the Pythons, at the En
glish, at Americans, and indi
vidually at ourselves. For those
who view the film to answer
the definitive question, the
Pythons adeptly reveal with
uncanny insight that life's
meaning has something to do
with fish and a lot to do with
bodily excretions.
Still, if fish and excretions
don't in and of themselves
make you laugh, the film is
loaded with enough quick and
clever social satire to delight
even the most puritanical vie

wer. After John Cleese de'ivers
a child to a woman who asks
what sex her baby is, he rapidly
responds, "A little early to be
imposing sex roles, now, isn't
it?" Also, the Pythons draw the
only logical conclusion to a
sketch portraying a general be
fore a military chart stating, "If
we don't need an army, may
God strike me down."
In addition to the laughter,
however, your stomach will
most likely hurt from disgust.
And of stomachs, yours hasn't
churned until you've seen
someone else's explode. Gal
lons of blood and vomit mixed
with intestinal tracts and lop
ped off limbs grow wearisome

after a time, whether tossed
around by a Dawn of the Dead
zombie or a Meaning of Life
Python. Regardless, in keeping
with Life of Brian and Monty
Python and the Holy Grail, it is
a fact of their humor that the
Pythons seem to maintain that
the best offense lies in the

strongly offensive, and The
Meaning of Life proves no ex
ception.
Finally, your stomach will
suffer if you eat popcorn dur
ing the film's dull moments.
The Pythons are at their best
when they are brisk, and much
of this film simply drags on.

When the impoverished
Catholic sector of Yorkshire
dances in the street singing
"Every Sperm is Sacred" as if in
a Dr. Pepper commercial, al
though it may be funny at first,
the joke is worn out after the
first three minutes and we wish
it would stop. The Pythons
elongate some of the film's
worst segments as if they know
that they are bad, and are try
ing to somehow salvage them
through repetition.
The Pythons' years of enter
taining experience is reflected
in the high quality of their act
ing, as they frequently seem to
respond to the film viewers as
if performing on stage before a

live audience. The Pythons ap
pear to somehow know when
their viewers are laughing, and
adjust the film's excitement
and pate accordingly. Geese's
performance is particularly
outstanding, as he comes
across as the only Python in
control of the film, as well as
the only one who apparently
understands what is going on.
Admirers of Cleese will delight
when he cleverly assumes a
Basil Fawlty (from Fawlty Tow
ers) type of character in the
film's restaurant scenes.
Terry Gilliam, the only
American Python, again works
wonders with his animation.
His special sequences add not
only humor, but some coher
ence to the film. In the final
series, the Pythons attempt to
interrelate the sketches into
some semblance of an integral
whole which might not be pos
sible without the subtle in
sights and mood afforded by
Gilliam's animation earlier in
the film. At least these special
sequences won't make your
stomach hurt.
