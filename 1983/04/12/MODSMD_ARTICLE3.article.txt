# Jury trial granted
## Shockley sues for libel 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
William Shockley, a Stanford pro
fessor emeritus of electrical en
gineering known for his controver
sial views about genetics and racial
inequality, has been granted a jury
trial for a $1.25 million libel suit
against the Atlanta Constitution. In
the suit, Shockley contends that an
article in the Constitution implied
that he approved of Hitler's genoci
dal race programs.
The article, written in 1980 by sci
ence writer Roger Witherspoon,
stated, "The Shockley program (to
alleviate the problem of dysgenetics)
was tried out in Germany during
World War II." It also stated that "In
discussing Shockley. . .his propo
sals are not new, but reworked Hitle
rian experiments."
Shockley, who won the Nobel
prize in 1956 for his contributions to
the invention of the transistor, con
tends that blacks are genetically in
ferior to whites, and that dysgene
tics, the overbreeding of genetically

inferior persons, is a threat to Ameri
can society.
Shockley has proposed two plans
to solve the problems of dysgene
tics: a voluntary sterilization bonus
plan, which would offer monetary
bonuses to low-income individuals
who Shockley claims are genetically
inferior, and, a cert ifkute plan which
would allow worn en to barter gov
ernment certificates for the right to
bear children.
On March 31 a preliminary hearing
was held in Atlanta. The defense
moved to dismiss the case on the
grounds that sino? Shockley was a
pi blic figure, he could not claim
damages for libel unless he could
prove actual malice â–  of intent or prove
that Witherspoon';* statements were
false.
U.S. District judge Robert Vining
granted Shockley n trial because, ac
cording to the cou rt order: "there is
absolutely no has is in fact for Mr.
Witherspoon's statement that the
Shockley program was tried out in
Germany duriing World War

11. . .There is a vast difference in urg
ing monetary sterilization through
monetary bonuses and mass mur
der."
Murray Silver, Shockley's lawyer,
maintained that the Witherspoon ar
ticle contained "numerous false
statements."
"I don't think that there is any
question that Dr. Shockley is a public
figure," he said, referring to the mo
tion to dismiss the suit, but he said he
felt the nature of Witherspoon's
statements were enough to merit a
jury trial.

Albert Norman, counsel for the de
fense, said that he would "prefer not
to speculate" about the outcome of
the case but added he felt that Wiih
erspoon's comments were opinions
rather than factual misstatements.
Shockley said that of the collection
of articles that had been written
about him, there had been no case
in which I had tried so carefully," to
avoid being misquoted.
"I don't know of everything that's
been written about me; I do know
there may have been worse things,
but this is the worst I have seen," he
said.
