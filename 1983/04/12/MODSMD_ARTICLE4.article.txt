Jordan's peace role ends
Amman, Jordan — Jordan, which the United
States had seen as the vehicle for President Rea
gan's Middle East peace initiative, called a halt
yesterday to its role in the process until there is a
substantial policy shift by either the United
States or the Palestine Liberation Organization.
An authoritative Jordanian source, who
asked that he not be identified and that his re
marks not be quoted directly, said that his coun
try's involvement in the Reagan plan had
reached a dead end. He said that the next move
would not come from Jordan because there is
no negotiating room left for Jordan's King
Hussein.

The Reagan plan received its most severe
blow to date when lordan announced Sunday
th;it its talks with the PLO had broken down.
Hussein had been seeking an agreement by the
PL O and its chairman, Yasser Arafat, for Jordan
to speak for the Palestinians in negotiations
over the future of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
Under the Reagan plan, the Palestinian resi
de nts of the two territories would be granted
se !f-rule "in association with Jordan." But in the
official announcement Sunday, the Jordanian
government said that, after an apparent agree
ment had been reached between Hussein and
Ai afat, the PLO submitted a new set of pro
posals that effectively negated it.

The gloomy appraisal by the Jordanian source
was in distinct contrast to the reaction of Rea
gan, who maintained Sunday that he remained
"very hopeful" that his plan would ultimately
meet with success.
The Jordanians said Sunday that they would
"leave it to the PLO and the Palestinian people
to choose the ways and means for the salvation
of themselves and their land."
In explaining why the Hussein-Arafat
dialogue broke down, the Jordanian source
said yesterday that the new PLO proposals re
instated the demands for an independent
Palestinian state and PLO participation in the
bargaining process.
The Reagan plan called for neither, but rather for
Hussein to act as a bridge between the Palestinians
and the Israelis at the bargaining table. The source
said the agreement between Hussein and Arafat was
ready for signature when the talks broke down.
New MX plan criticized
Washington — A renewed proposal to put the MX
missile in Minuteman silos and a plan to build a new,
smaller nuclear missile have come under fire in ad
vance of a presidential commission's recommenda
tion of a basing plan for the long-delayed defense sys
tem.
The commission was to recommend building 100
MX weapons and putting them in 100 Minuteman
silos in Wyoming and Nebraska, along with develop
ing a smaller, single warhead missile that could be
deployed in the next decade, according to details of
the report that already have become public.
The report by a commission headed by retired Air
Force Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, a former national se
curity adviser to President Gerald Ford, was to be re
leased today.
President Reagan is expected to wait at least a week
before endorsing the plan developed by a com
mission he appointed after Congress voted against
the missile last December, rejecting his "dense pack"
basing scheme.
Reagan does not want his comments about the
newest MX plan to detract from administration efforts
to oppose a House resolution calling for a nuclear
freeze, according to White House sources who de
clined to be named publicly.
These sources also noted the administration's lob
bying battle for Senate confirmation of Kenneth
Adelman, Reagan's nominee to head the arms control
agency.
Congressional votes on both the Adelman nomi
nation and the nuclear freeze issue are scheduled this
week.
The administration says the 10-warhead MX is
needed to replace the Minuteman missile because
the 1000 Minutemen, the backbone of America's
land-based nuclear deterrent, are vulnerable to a first
strike by increasingly accurate Soviet missiles.
More than 30 MX plans have been studied and re
jected since the weapon was first proposed a decade
ago.
Even before the latest plan was formally proposed,
it was the subject of congressional criticism.
Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) a leader of the suc
cessful fight against MX production money last De
cember, said, "I still think the MX is dead."
Sen. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) said, "We are back to
where we were in 1980. I am not convinced we ought
to go with the MX."
Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S D.) said, "We are going in
circles on this. It does not have my support."
"By no means am I convinced that the MX missile is
the way to solve the problem," said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg (D-N.J.).
But Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker of Ten
nessee was more optimistic. "I suspect they will have

broad appeal," the Republican leader said of the pro
posals.
Two earlier Reagan administration MX plans were
rejected by Congress, including a 1981 plan to put 40
of the missiles into Minuteman silos.
Poland delays nod to U.S. envoy
Warsaw, Poland — Poland is holding up approval of
a new American ambassador until the Reagan admin
istration makes "a sort of positive gesture" toward
Warsaw, a senior Polish official conceded yesterday.
The official said that the nominee — John Scanlan, a
career foreign service officer — had been proposed
more than three months ago by Washington. Am
dassador Francis Meehan, whom Scanlan was to re
place, left Warsaw in February, and the embassy cur
rently is under a lower ranking diplomat.
The State Department declined to comment on the
report. A U.S. official said Scanlan, who has served
three times in Poland, is now at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy.
The Polish Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on
condition he not be named, indicated that Poland in
tended to take some steps toward further national
reconciliation before Pope John Paul ll's arrival for a
visit to his native land on June 16. He asserted, how
ever, that it was up to the United States to make the
first moves toward breaking the ice in U.S.-Polish rela
tions.
"Certainly the visit may play an important role in
East-West relations, in improving the psychological
climate," he said. "Some Western colleagues are tell
ing us the visit will be important in changing the line
of Western policy toward Poland in terms of isolation
and on sanctions. Of course, I would be very happy if
that would be the case."
Poland's Communist authorities have been reluc
tant to appear to be making concessions under pres
sure from the church or Western states. But the min
istry official stated that the papal trip, although os
tensibly a religious pilgrimage, would have a
domestic political impact.
The official admitted, however, that Poland would
not be lifting martial law before the planned June visit
of the pope, nor would it meet calls by the Roman
Catholic Church for a general amnesty for political
prisoners, but he added "there will be a lot of im
provements" in the country's internal situation
before the pope's arrival.
El Salvador involvement opposed
By a wide margin, the American public opposes
U.S. involvement in war-torn El Salvador, saying that
U.S. efforts to prevent an overthrow of the Salvadoran
government by leftist rebels are not morally justified,
are not vital to U.S. national defense and will not end
in victory, according to the latest Los Angeles Times
poll.
The nationwide poll, taken as the Reagan adminis
tration is seeking a winning strategy in El Salvador and
battling with Congress for more military and econom
ic aid for the Central American country, also reveals
that a majority of Americans are against the use of U.S.
troops there — even if the Salvadoran government

was about to fall to the guerrillas.
Moreover, nearly two-thirds of the American peo
ple believe that the CIA should not back an invasion
of Nicaragua to overthrow the leftist Sandinista gov
ernment there, despite administration claims that the
Sandinistas have created an unprecedented military
buildup and threaten the security of the region.
The poll also indicates that the American public has
a largely unfavorable impression of the Salvadoran
government — particularly in regards to its human
rights record — and fears that the civil war there could
turn into a protracted conflict much like Vietnam.
The poll surveyed 1233 Americans 18 years of age
and older by telephone for five days between April 4
and 10 amid continuing reports of a joint U.S.-
Salvador plan to win over the countryside and its peo
ple from the rebels and mounting criticism from both
Republicans and Democrats in Congress over covert
U.S. intelligence operations in Nicaragua.
President Reagan, in speeches and news con
ferences, has repeatedly sounded the alarm over the
civil war in El Salvador, declaring it a direct threat to
U.S. interests and warning of a domino effect if the
communist rebels are victorious.
"It is not nutmeg that is at stake in the Caribbean
and Central America. It is the United States' national
security," he said in a major foreign policy speech last
month before the National Association of Manufac
turers. The speech also called for an additional $110
million in emergency military aid for El Salvador.
And, as the latest Times poll shows, resistance to the
president's appeals is strong among the public at
large. Asked whether U.S. involvement in the embat
tled Central American country is morally justified, 49
percent said it is not while 26 percent said it is — an
almost 2-1 margin.
Similarly, 45 percent declared that U.S. involve
ment in El Salvador is not vital to this country's na
tional defense against 33 percent who believe the op
posite. And 40 percent of the poll's respondents said
that U.S. efforts to bolsterthe Salvadoran government
will not end in victory against the rebels — nearly
twice the 23 percent who believe that U.S. involve
ment is a losing proposition.
Fearing another Vietnam, a majority of the public
also opposes sending U.S. troops into El Salvador.
Asked whether they would approve of using armed
U.S. forces if leftist rebels were about to topple the
Salvadoran government, 53 percent of the re
spondents were opposed, 31 percent were in favor
and 14 percent were undecided.
Close vote expected on Adelman
Washington — Bucking heavy odds, critics of Rea
gan administration policy on nuclear weapons are
pushing for the few votes they need to defeat arms
control nominee Kenneth Adelman in the Re
publican-controlled Senate.
Both supporters and opponents of the 36-year-old
United Nations diplomat predict that the vote, sched
uled for Thursday, will be close.
But one of the leaders of the opposition in GOP
ranks, Sen. Charles Mathias of Maryland, has con
ceded that "you have to give the presumption to the
president."

Debate on the nomination is scheduled to begin to
day and is one of two arms control issues on the con
gressional agenda this week.
Pravda prints 'American letters'
Moscow — The Communist Party newspaper Prav
da yesterday printed excerpts of letters to party leader
Yuri Andropov — letters it said were written by Amer
ican citizens.
Pravda ran a photograph of a batch of letters and
said that in some Western circles the fact that the let
ters expressed respect for Andropov and the Soviet
Union was met with disapproval.
There was no means of verifying the letters' authen
ticity.
It was the second time in two months that Pravda
has carried such a selection of excerpts. Its article yes
terday, referring to a similar one Feb. 22, said "Unpre
judiced readers saw, in the quoted expressions of the
Americans, the exposure of respect by the foreign
public of the Soviet leader, and their understanding
of the important role which the U.S.S.R. plays in in
ternational affairs, as well as acknowledgement of the
constructive contribution of our country in search of
peaceful solutions of the most acute problems of our
time."
Pravda said "Those in the West who are dropping
venomous seeds of hostility and tension, as well as
(who) try to poison the conscience of people by fables
of Soviet military threat and whip up the arms race did
not like the letters."
It said The iVew York Times tried to question the
authenticity of the letters by reportingsomeoftheau
thors could not be found in telephone books and that
some of those identified as letter writers denied hav
ing written to Andropov.
"But never mind how (this irritates) these specialists
on disinformation," Pravda said. "Everything which
we quote in our view was expressed by real, existing
Americans and accurately reprinted."
The newspaper said many of the letters expose the
"disinformation of Americans, and the results of the
protagonists of the military-industrial complex."
Dow Jones hits near-record highs
Stock prices surged upward yesterday, carrying
some market indexes to record highs, in buying
sparked by falling interest rates and signs of stabilizing
world oil prices.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped
17.12 to 1141.83, a few points shy of the record closing
high of 1145.90 it reached on March 24.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index, up
1.20 at 89.07, and the American Stock Exchange mar
ket value index, up 4.14 at 393.28, surpassed their pre
vious peaks.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today with highs in the upper 50s to
mid 60s. Northwesterly winds 15 to 30 mph especially
during the afternoon. Tonight and tomorrow will be
fair and breezy. Lows in the 40s and highs in the upper
50s and 60s.

istration makes "a sort of positive gesture" toward
Warsaw, a senior Polish official conceded yesterday.
The official said that the nominee — John Scanlan, a
career foreign service officer — had been proposed
more than three months ago by Washington. Am
dassador Francis Meehan, whom Scanlan was to re
place, left Warsaw in February, and the embassy cur
rently is under a lower ranking diplomat.
The State Department declined to comment on the
report. A U.S. official said Scanlan, who has served
three times in Poland, is now at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy.
The Polish Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on
condition he not be named, indicated that Poland in
tended to take some steps toward further national
reconciliation before Pope John Paul ll's arrival for a
visit to his native land on June 16. He asserted, how
ever, that it was up to the United States to make the
first moves toward breaking the ice in U.S.-Polish rela
tions.
"Certainly the visit may play an important role in
East-West relations, in improving the psychological
climate," he said. "Some Western colleagues are tell
ing us the visit will be important in changing the line
of Western policy toward Poland in terms of isolation
and on sanctions. Of course, I would be very happy if
that would be the case."
Poland's Communist authorities have been reluc
tant to appear to be making concessions under pres
sure from the church or Western states. But the min
istry official stated that the papal trip, although os
tensibly a religious pilgrimage, would have a
domestic political impact.
The official admitted, however, that Poland would
not be lifting martial law before the planned June visit
of the pope, nor would it meet calls by the Roman
Catholic Church for a general amnesty for political
prisoners, but he added "there will be a lot of im
provements" in the country's internal situation
before the pope's arrival.
El Salvador involvement opposed
By a wide margin, the American public opposes
U.S. involvement in war-torn El Salvador, saying that
U.S. efforts to prevent an overthrow of the Salvadoran
government by leftist rebels are not morally justified,
are not vital to U.S. national defense and will not end
in victory, according to the latest Los Angeles Times
poll.
The nationwide poll, taken as the Reagan adminis
tration is seeking a winning strategy in El Salvador and
battling with Congress for more military and econom
ic aid for the Central American country, also reveals
that a majority of Americans are against the use of U.S.
troops there — even if the Salvadoran government

was about to fall to the guerrillas.
Moreover, nearly two-thirds of the American peo
ple believe that the CIA should not back an invasion
of Nicaragua to overthrow the leftist Sandinista gov
ernment there, despite administration claims that the
Sandinistas have created an unprecedented military
buildup and threaten the security of the region.
The poll also indicates that the American public has
a largely unfavorable impression of the Salvadoran
government — particularly in regards to its human
rights record — and fears that the civil war there could
turn into a protracted conflict much like Vietnam.
The poll surveyed 1233 Americans 18 years of age
and older by telephone for five days between April 4
and 10 amid continuing reports of a joint U.S.-
Salvador plan to win over the countryside and its peo
ple from the rebels and mounting criticism from both
Republicans and Democrats in Congress over covert
U.S. intelligence operations in Nicaragua.
President Reagan, in speeches and news con
ferences, has repeatedly sounded the alarm over the
civil war in El Salvador, declaring it a direct threat to
U.S. interests and warning of a domino effect if the
communist rebels are victorious.
"It is not nutmeg that is at stake in the Caribbean
and Central America. It is the United States' national
security," he said in a major foreign policy speech last
month before the National Association of Manufac
turers. The speech also called for an additional $110
million in emergency military aid for El Salvador.
And, as the latest Times poll shows, resistance to the
president's appeals is strong among the public at
large. Asked whether U.S. involvement in the embat
tled Central American country is morally justified, 49
percent said it is not while 26 percent said it is — an
almost 2-1 margin.
Similarly, 45 percent declared that U.S. involve
ment in El Salvador is not vital to this country's na
tional defense against 33 percent who believe the op
posite. And 40 percent of the poll's respondents said
that U.S. efforts to bolsterthe Salvadoran government
will not end in victory against the rebels — nearly
twice the 23 percent who believe that U.S. involve
ment is a losing proposition.
Fearing another Vietnam, a majority of the public
also opposes sending U.S. troops into El Salvador.
Asked whether they would approve of using armed
U.S. forces if leftist rebels were about to topple the
Salvadoran government, 53 percent of the re
spondents were opposed, 31 percent were in favor
and 14 percent were undecided.
Close vote expected on Adelman
Washington — Bucking heavy odds, critics of Rea
gan administration policy on nuclear weapons are
pushing for the few votes they need to defeat arms
control nominee Kenneth Adelman in the Re
publican-controlled Senate.
Both supporters and opponents of the 36-year-old
United Nations diplomat predict that the vote, sched
uled for Thursday, will be close.
But one of the leaders of the opposition in GOP
ranks, Sen. Charles Mathias of Maryland, has con
ceded that "you have to give the presumption to the
president."

Debate on the nomination is scheduled to begin to
day and is one of two arms control issues on the con
gressional agenda this week.
Pravda prints 'American letters'
Moscow — The Communist Party newspaper Prav
da yesterday printed excerpts of letters to party leader
Yuri Andropov — letters it said were written by Amer
ican citizens.
Pravda ran a photograph of a batch of letters and
said that in some Western circles the fact that the let
ters expressed respect for Andropov and the Soviet
Union was met with disapproval.
There was no means of verifying the letters' authen
ticity.
It was the second time in two months that Pravda
has carried such a selection of excerpts. Its article yes
terday, referring to a similar one Feb. 22, said "Unpre
judiced readers saw, in the quoted expressions of the
Americans, the exposure of respect by the foreign
public of the Soviet leader, and their understanding
of the important role which the U.S.S.R. plays in in
ternational affairs, as well as acknowledgement of the
constructive contribution of our country in search of
peaceful solutions of the most acute problems of our
time."
Pravda said "Those in the West who are dropping
venomous seeds of hostility and tension, as well as
(who) try to poison the conscience of people by fables
of Soviet military threat and whip up the arms race did
not like the letters."
It said The iVew York Times tried to question the
authenticity of the letters by reportingsomeoftheau
thors could not be found in telephone books and that
some of those identified as letter writers denied hav
ing written to Andropov.
"But never mind how (this irritates) these specialists
on disinformation," Pravda said. "Everything which
we quote in our view was expressed by real, existing
Americans and accurately reprinted."
The newspaper said many of the letters expose the
"disinformation of Americans, and the results of the
protagonists of the military-industrial complex."
Dow Jones hits near-record highs
Stock prices surged upward yesterday, carrying

high of 1145.90 it reached on March 24.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index, up
1.20 at 89.07, and the American Stock Exchange mar

Jordan's peace role ends
Amman, Jordan — Jordan, which the United
States had seen as the vehicle for President Rea
gan's Middle East peace initiative, called a halt
yesterday to its role in the process until there is a
substantial policy shift by either the United
States or the Palestine Liberation Organization.
An authoritative Jordanian source, who
asked that he not be identified and that his re
marks not be quoted directly, said that his coun
try's involvement in the Reagan plan had
reached a dead end. He said that the next move
would not come from Jordan because there is
no negotiating room left for Jordan's King
Hussein.

The Reagan plan received its most severe
blow to date when lordan announced Sunday
th;it its talks with the PLO had broken down.
Hussein had been seeking an agreement by the
PL O and its chairman, Yasser Arafat, for Jordan
to speak for the Palestinians in negotiations
over the future of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
Under the Reagan plan, the Palestinian resi
de nts of the two territories would be granted
se !f-rule "in association with Jordan." But in the
official announcement Sunday, the Jordanian
government said that, after an apparent agree
ment had been reached between Hussein and
Ai afat, the PLO submitted a new set of pro
posals that effectively negated it.

The gloomy appraisal by the Jordanian source
was in distinct contrast to the reaction of Rea
gan, who maintained Sunday that he remained
"very hopeful" that his plan would ultimately
meet with success.
The Jordanians said Sunday that they would
"leave it to the PLO and the Palestinian people
to choose the ways and means for the salvation
of themselves and their land."
In explaining why the Hussein-Arafat
dialogue broke down, the Jordanian source
said yesterday that the new PLO proposals re
instated the demands for an independent
Palestinian state and PLO participation in the
bargaining process.
The Reagan plan called for neither, but rather for
Hussein to act as a bridge between the Palestinians
and the Israelis at the bargaining table. The source
said the agreement between Hussein and Arafat was
ready for signature when the talks broke down.
New MX plan criticized
Washington — A renewed proposal to put the MX
missile in Minuteman silos and a plan to build a new,
smaller nuclear missile have come under fire in ad
vance of a presidential commission's recommenda
tion of a basing plan for the long-delayed defense sys
tem.
The commission was to recommend building 100
MX weapons and putting them in 100 Minuteman
silos in Wyoming and Nebraska, along with develop
ing a smaller, single warhead missile that could be
deployed in the next decade, according to details of
the report that already have become public.
The report by a commission headed by retired Air
Force Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, a former national se
curity adviser to President Gerald Ford, was to be re
leased today.
President Reagan is expected to wait at least a week
before endorsing the plan developed by a com
mission he appointed after Congress voted against
the missile last December, rejecting his "dense pack"
basing scheme.
Reagan does not want his comments about the
newest MX plan to detract from administration efforts
to oppose a House resolution calling for a nuclear
freeze, according to White House sources who de
clined to be named publicly.
These sources also noted the administration's lob
bying battle for Senate confirmation of Kenneth
Adelman, Reagan's nominee to head the arms control
agency.
Congressional votes on both the Adelman nomi
nation and the nuclear freeze issue are scheduled this
week.
The administration says the 10-warhead MX is
needed to replace the Minuteman missile because
the 1000 Minutemen, the backbone of America's
land-based nuclear deterrent, are vulnerable to a first
strike by increasingly accurate Soviet missiles.
More than 30 MX plans have been studied and re
jected since the weapon was first proposed a decade
ago.
Even before the latest plan was formally proposed,
it was the subject of congressional criticism.
Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) a leader of the suc
cessful fight against MX production money last De
cember, said, "I still think the MX is dead."
Sen. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) said, "We are back to
where we were in 1980. I am not convinced we ought
to go with the MX."
Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S D.) said, "We are going in
circles on this. It does not have my support."
"By no means am I convinced that the MX missile is
the way to solve the problem," said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg (D-N.J.).
But Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker of Ten
nessee was more optimistic. "I suspect they will have

broad appeal," the Republican leader said of the pro
posals.
Two earlier Reagan administration MX plans were
rejected by Congress, including a 1981 plan to put 40
of the missiles into Minuteman silos.

gan administration policy on nuclear weapons are
pushing for the few votes they need to defeat arms
control nominee Kenneth Adelman in the Re
publican-controlled Senate.
Both supporters and opponents of the 36-year-old
United Nations diplomat predict that the vote, sched
uled for Thursday, will be close.
But one of the leaders of the opposition in GOP
ranks, Sen. Charles Mathias of Maryland, has con
ceded that "you have to give the presumption to the
president."

Debate on the nomination is scheduled to begin to
day and is one of two arms control issues on the con
gressional agenda this week.
Pravda prints 'American letters'
Moscow — The Communist Party newspaper Prav
da yesterday printed excerpts of letters to party leader
Yuri Andropov — letters it said were written by Amer
ican citizens.
Pravda ran a photograph of a batch of letters and
said that in some Western circles the fact that the let
ters expressed respect for Andropov and the Soviet
Union was met with disapproval.
There was no means of verifying the letters' authen
ticity.
It was the second time in two months that Pravda
has carried such a selection of excerpts. Its article yes
terday, referring to a similar one Feb. 22, said "Unpre
judiced readers saw, in the quoted expressions of the
Americans, the exposure of respect by the foreign
public of the Soviet leader, and their understanding
of the important role which the U.S.S.R. plays in in
ternational affairs, as well as acknowledgement of the
constructive contribution of our country in search of
peaceful solutions of the most acute problems of our
time."
Pravda said "Those in the West who are dropping
venomous seeds of hostility and tension, as well as
(who) try to poison the conscience of people by fables
of Soviet military threat and whip up the arms race did
not like the letters."
It said The iVew York Times tried to question the
authenticity of the letters by reportingsomeoftheau
thors could not be found in telephone books and that
some of those identified as letter writers denied hav
ing written to Andropov.
"But never mind how (this irritates) these specialists
on disinformation," Pravda said. "Everything which
we quote in our view was expressed by real, existing
Americans and accurately reprinted."
The newspaper said many of the letters expose the
"disinformation of Americans, and the results of the
protagonists of the military-industrial complex."

Jordan's peace role ends
Amman, Jordan — Jordan, which the United
States had seen as the vehicle for President Rea
gan's Middle East peace initiative, called a halt
yesterday to its role in the process until there is a
substantial policy shift by either the United
States or the Palestine Liberation Organization.
An authoritative Jordanian source, who
asked that he not be identified and that his re
marks not be quoted directly, said that his coun
try's involvement in the Reagan plan had
reached a dead end. He said that the next move
would not come from Jordan because there is
no negotiating room left for Jordan's King
Hussein.

The Reagan plan received its most severe
blow to date when lordan announced Sunday
th;it its talks with the PLO had broken down.
Hussein had been seeking an agreement by the
PL O and its chairman, Yasser Arafat, for Jordan
to speak for the Palestinians in negotiations
over the future of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
Under the Reagan plan, the Palestinian resi
de nts of the two territories would be granted
se !f-rule "in association with Jordan." But in the
official announcement Sunday, the Jordanian
government said that, after an apparent agree
ment had been reached between Hussein and
Ai afat, the PLO submitted a new set of pro
posals that effectively negated it.

The gloomy appraisal by the Jordanian source
was in distinct contrast to the reaction of Rea
gan, who maintained Sunday that he remained
"very hopeful" that his plan would ultimately
meet with success.
The Jordanians said Sunday that they would
"leave it to the PLO and the Palestinian people
to choose the ways and means for the salvation
of themselves and their land."
In explaining why the Hussein-Arafat
dialogue broke down, the Jordanian source
said yesterday that the new PLO proposals re
instated the demands for an independent
Palestinian state and PLO participation in the
bargaining process.
The Reagan plan called for neither, but rather for
Hussein to act as a bridge between the Palestinians
and the Israelis at the bargaining table. The source
said the agreement between Hussein and Arafat was
ready for signature when the talks broke down.
New MX plan criticized
Washington — A renewed proposal to put the MX
missile in Minuteman silos and a plan to build a new,
smaller nuclear missile have come under fire in ad
vance of a presidential commission's recommenda
tion of a basing plan for the long-delayed defense sys
tem.
The commission was to recommend building 100
MX weapons and putting them in 100 Minuteman
silos in Wyoming and Nebraska, along with develop
ing a smaller, single warhead missile that could be
deployed in the next decade, according to details of
the report that already have become public.
The report by a commission headed by retired Air
Force Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, a former national se
curity adviser to President Gerald Ford, was to be re
leased today.
President Reagan is expected to wait at least a week
before endorsing the plan developed by a com
mission he appointed after Congress voted against
the missile last December, rejecting his "dense pack"
basing scheme.
Reagan does not want his comments about the
newest MX plan to detract from administration efforts
to oppose a House resolution calling for a nuclear
freeze, according to White House sources who de
clined to be named publicly.
These sources also noted the administration's lob
bying battle for Senate confirmation of Kenneth
Adelman, Reagan's nominee to head the arms control
agency.
Congressional votes on both the Adelman nomi
nation and the nuclear freeze issue are scheduled this
week.
The administration says the 10-warhead MX is
needed to replace the Minuteman missile because
the 1000 Minutemen, the backbone of America's
land-based nuclear deterrent, are vulnerable to a first
strike by increasingly accurate Soviet missiles.
More than 30 MX plans have been studied and re
jected since the weapon was first proposed a decade
ago.
Even before the latest plan was formally proposed,
it was the subject of congressional criticism.
Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) a leader of the suc
cessful fight against MX production money last De
cember, said, "I still think the MX is dead."
Sen. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) said, "We are back to
where we were in 1980. I am not convinced we ought
to go with the MX."
Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S D.) said, "We are going in
circles on this. It does not have my support."
"By no means am I convinced that the MX missile is
the way to solve the problem," said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg (D-N.J.).
But Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker of Ten
nessee was more optimistic. "I suspect they will have

broad appeal," the Republican leader said of the pro
posals.
Two earlier Reagan administration MX plans were
rejected by Congress, including a 1981 plan to put 40
of the missiles into Minuteman silos.
Poland delays nod to U.S. envoy
Warsaw, Poland — Poland is holding up approval of
a new American ambassador until the Reagan admin
istration makes "a sort of positive gesture" toward
Warsaw, a senior Polish official conceded yesterday.
The official said that the nominee — John Scanlan, a
career foreign service officer — had been proposed
more than three months ago by Washington. Am
dassador Francis Meehan, whom Scanlan was to re
place, left Warsaw in February, and the embassy cur
rently is under a lower ranking diplomat.
The State Department declined to comment on the
report. A U.S. official said Scanlan, who has served
three times in Poland, is now at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy.
The Polish Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on
condition he not be named, indicated that Poland in
tended to take some steps toward further national
reconciliation before Pope John Paul ll's arrival for a
visit to his native land on June 16. He asserted, how
ever, that it was up to the United States to make the
first moves toward breaking the ice in U.S.-Polish rela
tions.
"Certainly the visit may play an important role in
East-West relations, in improving the psychological
climate," he said. "Some Western colleagues are tell
ing us the visit will be important in changing the line
of Western policy toward Poland in terms of isolation
and on sanctions. Of course, I would be very happy if
that would be the case."
Poland's Communist authorities have been reluc
tant to appear to be making concessions under pres
sure from the church or Western states. But the min
istry official stated that the papal trip, although os
tensibly a religious pilgrimage, would have a
domestic political impact.
The official admitted, however, that Poland would
not be lifting martial law before the planned June visit
of the pope, nor would it meet calls by the Roman
Catholic Church for a general amnesty for political
prisoners, but he added "there will be a lot of im
provements" in the country's internal situation
before the pope's arrival.
El Salvador involvement opposed
By a wide margin, the American public opposes
U.S. involvement in war-torn El Salvador, saying that
U.S. efforts to prevent an overthrow of the Salvadoran
government by leftist rebels are not morally justified,
are not vital to U.S. national defense and will not end
in victory, according to the latest Los Angeles Times
poll.
The nationwide poll, taken as the Reagan adminis
tration is seeking a winning strategy in El Salvador and
battling with Congress for more military and econom
ic aid for the Central American country, also reveals
that a majority of Americans are against the use of U.S.
troops there — even if the Salvadoran government

was about to fall to the guerrillas.
Moreover, nearly two-thirds of the American peo
ple believe that the CIA should not back an invasion
of Nicaragua to overthrow the leftist Sandinista gov
ernment there, despite administration claims that the
Sandinistas have created an unprecedented military
buildup and threaten the security of the region.
The poll also indicates that the American public has
a largely unfavorable impression of the Salvadoran
government — particularly in regards to its human
rights record — and fears that the civil war there could
turn into a protracted conflict much like Vietnam.
The poll surveyed 1233 Americans 18 years of age
and older by telephone for five days between April 4
and 10 amid continuing reports of a joint U.S.-
Salvador plan to win over the countryside and its peo
ple from the rebels and mounting criticism from both
Republicans and Democrats in Congress over covert
U.S. intelligence operations in Nicaragua.
President Reagan, in speeches and news con
ferences, has repeatedly sounded the alarm over the
civil war in El Salvador, declaring it a direct threat to
U.S. interests and warning of a domino effect if the
communist rebels are victorious.
"It is not nutmeg that is at stake in the Caribbean
and Central America. It is the United States' national
security," he said in a major foreign policy speech last
month before the National Association of Manufac
turers. The speech also called for an additional $110
million in emergency military aid for El Salvador.
And, as the latest Times poll shows, resistance to the
president's appeals is strong among the public at
large. Asked whether U.S. involvement in the embat
tled Central American country is morally justified, 49
percent said it is not while 26 percent said it is — an
almost 2-1 margin.
Similarly, 45 percent declared that U.S. involve
ment in El Salvador is not vital to this country's na
tional defense against 33 percent who believe the op
posite. And 40 percent of the poll's respondents said
that U.S. efforts to bolsterthe Salvadoran government
will not end in victory against the rebels — nearly
twice the 23 percent who believe that U.S. involve
ment is a losing proposition.
Fearing another Vietnam, a majority of the public
also opposes sending U.S. troops into El Salvador.
Asked whether they would approve of using armed
U.S. forces if leftist rebels were about to topple the
Salvadoran government, 53 percent of the re
spondents were opposed, 31 percent were in favor
and 14 percent were undecided.

In explaining why the Hussein-Arafat
dialogue broke down, the Jordanian source
said yesterday that the new PLO proposals re
instated the demands for an independent
Palestinian state and PLO participation in the
bargaining process.
The Reagan plan called for neither, but rather for
Hussein to act as a bridge between the Palestinians
and the Israelis at the bargaining table. The source
said the agreement between Hussein and Arafat was
ready for signature when the talks broke down.
New MX plan criticized
Washington — A renewed proposal to put the MX
missile in Minuteman silos and a plan to build a new,
smaller nuclear missile have come under fire in ad
vance of a presidential commission's recommenda
tion of a basing plan for the long-delayed defense sys
tem.
The commission was to recommend building 100
MX weapons and putting them in 100 Minuteman
silos in Wyoming and Nebraska, along with develop
ing a smaller, single warhead missile that could be
deployed in the next decade, according to details of
the report that already have become public.
The report by a commission headed by retired Air
Force Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, a former national se
curity adviser to President Gerald Ford, was to be re
leased today.
President Reagan is expected to wait at least a week
before endorsing the plan developed by a com
mission he appointed after Congress voted against
the missile last December, rejecting his "dense pack"
basing scheme.
Reagan does not want his comments about the
newest MX plan to detract from administration efforts
to oppose a House resolution calling for a nuclear
freeze, according to White House sources who de
clined to be named publicly.
These sources also noted the administration's lob
bying battle for Senate confirmation of Kenneth
Adelman, Reagan's nominee to head the arms control
agency.
Congressional votes on both the Adelman nomi
nation and the nuclear freeze issue are scheduled this
week.
The administration says the 10-warhead MX is
needed to replace the Minuteman missile because
the 1000 Minutemen, the backbone of America's
land-based nuclear deterrent, are vulnerable to a first
strike by increasingly accurate Soviet missiles.
More than 30 MX plans have been studied and re
jected since the weapon was first proposed a decade
ago.
Even before the latest plan was formally proposed,
it was the subject of congressional criticism.
Sen. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) a leader of the suc
cessful fight against MX production money last De
cember, said, "I still think the MX is dead."
Sen. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) said, "We are back to
where we were in 1980. I am not convinced we ought
to go with the MX."
Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S D.) said, "We are going in
circles on this. It does not have my support."
"By no means am I convinced that the MX missile is
the way to solve the problem," said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg (D-N.J.).
But Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker of Ten
nessee was more optimistic. "I suspect they will have

broad appeal," the Republican leader said of the pro
posals.
Two earlier Reagan administration MX plans were
rejected by Congress, including a 1981 plan to put 40
of the missiles into Minuteman silos.
Poland delays nod to U.S. envoy
Warsaw, Poland — Poland is holding up approval of
a new American ambassador until the Reagan admin
istration makes "a sort of positive gesture" toward
Warsaw, a senior Polish official conceded yesterday.
The official said that the nominee — John Scanlan, a
career foreign service officer — had been proposed
more than three months ago by Washington. Am
dassador Francis Meehan, whom Scanlan was to re
place, left Warsaw in February, and the embassy cur
rently is under a lower ranking diplomat.
The State Department declined to comment on the
report. A U.S. official said Scanlan, who has served
three times in Poland, is now at the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy.
The Polish Foreign Ministry official, who spoke on
condition he not be named, indicated that Poland in
tended to take some steps toward further national
reconciliation before Pope John Paul ll's arrival for a
visit to his native land on June 16. He asserted, how
ever, that it was up to the United States to make the
first moves toward breaking the ice in U.S.-Polish rela
tions.
"Certainly the visit may play an important role in
East-West relations, in improving the psychological
climate," he said. "Some Western colleagues are tell
ing us the visit will be important in changing the line
of Western policy toward Poland in terms of isolation
and on sanctions. Of course, I would be very happy if
that would be the case."
Poland's Communist authorities have been reluc
tant to appear to be making concessions under pres
sure from the church or Western states. But the min
istry official stated that the papal trip, although os
tensibly a religious pilgrimage, would have a
domestic political impact.
The official admitted, however, that Poland would
not be lifting martial law before the planned June visit
of the pope, nor would it meet calls by the Roman
Catholic Church for a general amnesty for political
prisoners, but he added "there will be a lot of im
provements" in the country's internal situation
before the pope's arrival.
El Salvador involvement opposed
By a wide margin, the American public opposes
U.S. involvement in war-torn El Salvador, saying that
U.S. efforts to prevent an overthrow of the Salvadoran
government by leftist rebels are not morally justified,
are not vital to U.S. national defense and will not end
in victory, according to the latest Los Angeles Times
poll.
The nationwide poll, taken as the Reagan adminis
tration is seeking a winning strategy in El Salvador and
battling with Congress for more military and econom
ic aid for the Central American country, also reveals
that a majority of Americans are against the use of U.S.
troops there — even if the Salvadoran government

was about to fall to the guerrillas.
Moreover, nearly two-thirds of the American peo
ple believe that the CIA should not back an invasion
of Nicaragua to overthrow the leftist Sandinista gov
ernment there, despite administration claims that the
Sandinistas have created an unprecedented military
buildup and threaten the security of the region.
The poll also indicates that the American public has
a largely unfavorable impression of the Salvadoran
government — particularly in regards to its human
rights record — and fears that the civil war there could
turn into a protracted conflict much like Vietnam.
The poll surveyed 1233 Americans 18 years of age
and older by telephone for five days between April 4
and 10 amid continuing reports of a joint U.S.-
Salvador plan to win over the countryside and its peo
ple from the rebels and mounting criticism from both
Republicans and Democrats in Congress over covert
U.S. intelligence operations in Nicaragua.
President Reagan, in speeches and news con
ferences, has repeatedly sounded the alarm over the
civil war in El Salvador, declaring it a direct threat to
U.S. interests and warning of a domino effect if the
communist rebels are victorious.
"It is not nutmeg that is at stake in the Caribbean
and Central America. It is the United States' national
security," he said in a major foreign policy speech last
month before the National Association of Manufac
turers. The speech also called for an additional $110
million in emergency military aid for El Salvador.
And, as the latest Times poll shows, resistance to the
president's appeals is strong among the public at
large. Asked whether U.S. involvement in the embat
tled Central American country is morally justified, 49
percent said it is not while 26 percent said it is — an
almost 2-1 margin.
Similarly, 45 percent declared that U.S. involve
ment in El Salvador is not vital to this country's na
tional defense against 33 percent who believe the op
posite. And 40 percent of the poll's respondents said
that U.S. efforts to bolsterthe Salvadoran government
will not end in victory against the rebels — nearly
twice the 23 percent who believe that U.S. involve
ment is a losing proposition.
Fearing another Vietnam, a majority of the public
also opposes sending U.S. troops into El Salvador.
Asked whether they would approve of using armed
U.S. forces if leftist rebels were about to topple the
Salvadoran government, 53 percent of the re
spondents were opposed, 31 percent were in favor
and 14 percent were undecided.
Close vote expected on Adelman
Washington — Bucking heavy odds, critics of Rea
gan administration policy on nuclear weapons are
pushing for the few votes they need to defeat arms
control nominee Kenneth Adelman in the Re
publican-controlled Senate.
Both supporters and opponents of the 36-year-old
United Nations diplomat predict that the vote, sched
uled for Thursday, will be close.
But one of the leaders of the opposition in GOP
ranks, Sen. Charles Mathias of Maryland, has con
ceded that "you have to give the presumption to the
president."

Debate on the nomination is scheduled to begin to
day and is one of two arms control issues on the con
gressional agenda this week.
Pravda prints 'American letters'
Moscow — The Communist Party newspaper Prav
da yesterday printed excerpts of letters to party leader
Yuri Andropov — letters it said were written by Amer
ican citizens.
Pravda ran a photograph of a batch of letters and
said that in some Western circles the fact that the let
ters expressed respect for Andropov and the Soviet
Union was met with disapproval.
There was no means of verifying the letters' authen
ticity.
It was the second time in two months that Pravda
has carried such a selection of excerpts. Its article yes
terday, referring to a similar one Feb. 22, said "Unpre
judiced readers saw, in the quoted expressions of the
Americans, the exposure of respect by the foreign
public of the Soviet leader, and their understanding
of the important role which the U.S.S.R. plays in in
ternational affairs, as well as acknowledgement of the
constructive contribution of our country in search of
peaceful solutions of the most acute problems of our
time."
Pravda said "Those in the West who are dropping
venomous seeds of hostility and tension, as well as
(who) try to poison the conscience of people by fables
of Soviet military threat and whip up the arms race did
not like the letters."
It said The iVew York Times tried to question the
authenticity of the letters by reportingsomeoftheau
thors could not be found in telephone books and that
some of those identified as letter writers denied hav
ing written to Andropov.
"But never mind how (this irritates) these specialists
on disinformation," Pravda said. "Everything which
we quote in our view was expressed by real, existing
Americans and accurately reprinted."
The newspaper said many of the letters expose the
"disinformation of Americans, and the results of the
protagonists of the military-industrial complex."
Dow Jones hits near-record highs
Stock prices surged upward yesterday, carrying
some market indexes to record highs, in buying

1.20 at 89.07, and the American Stock Exchange mar
ket value index, up 4.14 at 393.28, surpassed their pre
vious peaks.
