Jordan's peace role ends
Amman, Jordan â€” Jordan, which the United
States had seen as the vehicle for President Rea
gan's Middle East peace initiative, called a halt
yesterday to its role in the process until there is a
substantial policy shift by either the United
States or the Palestine Liberation Organization.
An authoritative Jordanian source, who
asked that he not be identified and that his re
marks not be quoted directly, said that his coun
try's involvement in the Reagan plan had
reached a dead end. He said that the next move
would not come from Jordan because there is
no negotiating room left for Jordan's King
Hussein.

The Reagan plan received its most severe
blow to date when lordan announced Sunday
th;it its talks with the PLO had broken down.
Hussein had been seeking an agreement by the
PL O and its chairman, Yasser Arafat, for Jordan
to speak for the Palestinians in negotiations
over the future of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
Under the Reagan plan, the Palestinian resi
de nts of the two territories would be granted
se !f-rule "in association with Jordan." But in the
official announcement Sunday, the Jordanian
government said that, after an apparent agree
ment had been reached between Hussein and
Ai afat, the PLO submitted a new set of pro
posals that effectively negated it.

The gloomy appraisal by the Jordanian source
was in distinct contrast to the reaction of Rea
gan, who maintained Sunday that he remained
"very hopeful" that his plan would ultimately
meet with success.
The Jordanians said Sunday that they would
"leave it to the PLO and the Palestinian people
to choose the ways and means for the salvation
of themselves and their land."
In explaining why the Hussein-Arafat
dialogue broke down, the Jordanian source
said yesterday that the new PLO proposals re
instated the demands for an independent
Palestinian state and PLO participation in the
bargaining process.
