# Projects here indirectly aid laser weapons
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
Two projects here that are funded by the De
partment of Defense (DoD) indirectly aid laser
weapons research, the Daily has learned through
interviews and government documents.
The documents and interviews with professors
show that a controversial proposal at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL)
which would aid research for nuclear weapon
pumped x-ray lasers would not be the first time
laser weapon-related research would take place
here.
Tony Siegman, professor of electrical en
gineering and director of the Ginzton Laboratory
here — part of the Hansen Laboratories, where
the projects are being conducted — said, how
ever, that the projects are primarily non
weapons related. He also speculated that it was
"unlikely" that the projects could ever be turned
into laser weapons.
The projects are unclassified as is all research
conducted at Stanford as a result of policies
adopted in 1971 which preclude the University
from taking part in classified research.
In related developments, Gerald Lieberman,
vice-provost and dean of graduate studies and
research, said the DoD's funding for research
here rose from $22 million in 1980-81 to $24 mil
lion for 1981-82.
Other documents indicate Stanford is a major
university contributor to the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency's High Energy Laser
Technology project. The documents do not spe
cifically state how the University participates in
the project, but says the project directly aids

laser weapons research.
Lieberman said he was not concerned about
the rise in DoD funding or the two laser
weapon-related projects.
The two documents, which are called work
unit summaries and were filed by the Air Force to
justify DoD funding for the projects, are dated
July 8, 1982. They list the DoD as giving two-year
grants of $499,334 for one project and $451,315
for the other.
One of the projects, which is being conducted
by research associate John Madey, develops free
electron lasers, which the Air Force report says
"have great potential for very high powers and
efficiencies needed for weapons applications."
The other project concerns radiative colli
sional processes, which Siegman said could pos
sibly lead to the development of small x-ray las
ers. The project is being researched by Stephen
Harris, professor of physics, and lames Young,
an adjunct professor of electrical engineering.
But, according to Young research has been at a
standstill since winter quarter.
Young denied his project had any direct mili
tary application, however.
"No piece of knowledge can be developed
that won't eventually hurt someone," Young
said. "Some projects have (military) applications
closer than others."
Young also said he is not concerned about the
fact that the DoD funds his research and pointed
out that all of his research is unclassified. He also
praised the DoD as being the most efficient
source of research money.
Lieberman said decisions about whether or
not to consider the end-use of a project were

"troublesome" because "a hell of a lot of re
search going on here has no weapons use now,
but it could be utilized for weapons research in
the future," he said.
Lieberman said the University could only
judge a research project on the basis of its scien
tific merit and whether or not it is classified.
According to Lieberman, both projects have
demonstrated that they would benefit basic sci
ence.
According to Siegman, the project investigating
free electron lasers could be used in many non
weaon applications, such as inspecting under
ground insulation cables. He also said he felt it
was "pretty unlikely" that the project could ever
be used as a weapon.
"It's a long ways from being done," Siegman
said. "Making weapons is not what Madey in
tends to do."
He said both chemical lasers and nuclear
weapons-pumped x-ray lasers would be more
powerful and efficient wapons than would free
electron lasers.
"The DoD has been the primary patron of fun
damental research, it's just another funding
source," he said.
Siegman said, however, that many people are
concerned about the DoD as a source of funding
because they are "scared by the excessively
hawkish attitude of the current (Reagan) admin
istration."
Approximately 280 staff members of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center signed petitions
two months ago opposing the proposal at SSRL
because it would aid research in nuclear
weapons-pumped x-ray lasers.

the project, but says the project directly aids

laser weapons research.
Lieberman said he was not concerned about
the rise in DoD funding or the two laser
weapon-related projects.
The two documents, which are called work
unit summaries and were filed by the Air Force to
justify DoD funding for the projects, are dated
July 8, 1982. They list the DoD as giving two-year
grants of $499,334 for one project and $451,315
for the other.
One of the projects, which is being conducted
by research associate John Madey, develops free
electron lasers, which the Air Force report says
"have great potential for very high powers and
efficiencies needed for weapons applications."
The other project concerns radiative colli
sional processes, which Siegman said could pos
sibly lead to the development of small x-ray las
ers. The project is being researched by Stephen
Harris, professor of physics, and lames Young,
an adjunct professor of electrical engineering.
But, according to Young research has been at a
standstill since winter quarter.
Young denied his project had any direct mili
tary application, however.
"No piece of knowledge can be developed
that won't eventually hurt someone," Young
said. "Some projects have (military) applications
closer than others."
Young also said he is not concerned about the
fact that the DoD funds his research and pointed
out that all of his research is unclassified. He also
praised the DoD as being the most efficient
source of research money.
Lieberman said decisions about whether or
not to consider the end-use of a project were

"troublesome" because "a hell of a lot of re
search going on here has no weapons use now,
but it could be utilized for weapons research in
the future," he said.
Lieberman said the University could only
judge a research project on the basis of its scien
tific merit and whether or not it is classified.
According to Lieberman, both projects have
demonstrated that they would benefit basic sci
ence.
According to Siegman, the project investigating
free electron lasers could be used in many non
weaon applications, such as inspecting under
ground insulation cables. He also said he felt it
was "pretty unlikely" that the project could ever
be used as a weapon.
"It's a long ways from being done," Siegman
said. "Making weapons is not what Madey in
tends to do."
He said both chemical lasers and nuclear
weapons-pumped x-ray lasers would be more
powerful and efficient wapons than would free
electron lasers.
"The DoD has been the primary patron of fun
damental research, it's just another funding
source," he said.
Siegman said, however, that many people are
concerned about the DoD as a source of funding
because they are "scared by the excessively
hawkish attitude of the current (Reagan) admin
istration."
Approximately 280 staff members of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center signed petitions
two months ago opposing the proposal at SSRL
because it would aid research in nuclear
weapons-pumped x-ray lasers.
