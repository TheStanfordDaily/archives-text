# PA, Menlo residents oppose Stanford West

Area residents raised environmen
tal and traffic issues as well as ar
cheological concerns at a public
hearing before the Palo Alto City
Council last night on the proposed
Stanford West housing project.
"Stanford proposes to place a city
of 3000 people a block from my front
door," said Wray Huests, a Palo Alto
resident "Personally, I would rather
have a disposal site for hazardous
wastes as my neighbor than the Stan
ford West housing project."
The Stanford West proposal calls
for the construction of a 1275-unit,
46-aore housing facility located just
off Willow Road west of the shopping
center. The project's townhouses,
apartments and single-family
houses, ranging in price from $60,000
to $250,000, are designed to help al
leviate the area-wide housing short
age to' faculty and staff.
Because Stanford West is the
largest proposed development proj
ect for Palo Alto since the '50s and

would increase the number of hous
ing units in the city by more than 5
percent, residents have expressed
concern that its construction would
create traffic and aesthetic problems.
Palo Altan David Blumenthal said the
density of the project will "create
havoc and a catastrophe."
Affordability is another issue sur
rounding the proposal. Blumenthal
responded to the University projec
tion that a reduction in density by 100
units would cause the cost of the re
maining units to go up by $1500 per
unit by saying, "The Stanford real es
tate boys are out to squeeze every
last penny that they can get."
Blumenthal said, "The land (the
46-acre site) was donated to Stanford
free and therefore can't be sold." He
called the University's method of
using the assessed value of the land,
which he feels is an unrealisticly
high figure to estimate the cost of
the units, "an attempt to justify what
they know is a little bit out of line."
The possibility of the site's ar
chaeological value was another con
cern raised. Archaeologist and Palo
Altan Bert Gerow, who said that the
land is "extremely valuable ar
chaeologically," called for a review
by "qualified archaeologists" before
further steps are taken.
Another archaeological expert,
Robert Cartier, said, "The site is over
1000 years old and likely contains In
dian burial remains." He recom
mended capping the site with an in
sulation layer of dirt before building.

In support of the project, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
spoke of the "desperate need for
reasonably priced housing for faculty
and staff" which Stanford West will
fulfill.
Director of Personnel Rob Parker
also spoke of the importance of ac
cess to reasonably priced housing for
staff and said, "The absence of af
fordable and proximate housing is
the single largest barrier to our re
cruitment efforts."
Former Palo Alto Mayor Al Hen
derson, speaking for the Housing
Corporation Board, said "The final
result has our full endorsement."
