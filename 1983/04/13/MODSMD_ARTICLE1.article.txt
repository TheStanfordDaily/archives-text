# McCloskey: cut U.S. aid to Israel
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
The United States should cut off
aid to Israel unless the Israelis "stop
the West Bank settlements, get out of
Lebanon and start negotiating fairly
for autonomy on the West Bank,"
former U.S. Rep. Paul "Pete"
McCloskey said last night to about 50
people in Branner lounge.
President Reagan does not dare
cut Israeli aid because he is afraid
that Congress, pressured by the
American Jewish lobby, "the most
powerful lobby in America, bar
none," would override him,
McCloskey said.

McCloskey, who currently teaches
a class here titled "Congressional
Decisionmaking," was the center of
controversy this winter when stu
dent groups tried unsuccessfully to
block his appointment as a guest pro
fessor because of allegedly "anti-
Semitic" statements he made about
the American Jewish lobby.
McCloskey last night criticized the
students who had opposed his class,
saying that attempts to bar him from
such actions raised serious questions
about academic freedom.
At the same time, McCloskey said
Stanford students in general are
apathetic. "The apathy on this cam
pus you could cut with a knife," he
said. "Don't ask me what you can do;
go out and do something."
Such apathy is dangerous because

it leads politicians to fail to define
their positions. "It is the nature of
politicians not to address issues if
they can avoid it," McCloskey said.
"You get beaten by taking posi
tions."
One issue McCloskey isn't afraid
to take a stand on is Israel. The
former congressman said the emo
tional commitment of Jews to Israel
prevents them from expressing pub
licly their private dissatisfaction with
Israeli Prime Minister Begin.
"Begin is a disaster for Israel,"
McCloskey said, adding that the Is
raeli leader is leading his country
down the path to possible nuclear
destruction.
McCloskey is the first former pres
idential candidate to speak in the
Stanford Law Forum presidential
election series. He dropped out of
the 1972 race for the Republican pres
idential nomination three days after
receiving only 20 percent of the vote
in the New Hampshire primary.
The guest professor commented
on this race in a brief speech before a
frank and often sharp question-and
answer session with students.
McCloskey said he entered the
1972 campaign because he felt it was
essential that "someone in the Re
publican party debate Richard Nixon
on the Vietnam War."
Nixon had been elected on his
promise to end the war, McCloskey
said, but the president had reneged
on this promise by bombing Laos and
invading Cambodia. The resulting
confrontation was "as cruel a war as
has ever occurred," he said.
McCloskey later said, "I worry in
creasingly that we are repeat
ing. . .the Vietnam mistake (in El Sal
vador). I think Reagan's dead
wrong."
If the United States persists in
shoring up right-wing dictators in the
process of defeating communist in
surgencies, McCloskey said, Ameri
cans are simply making an ultimate
communist victory more likely.
In a wide-ranging discussion,
McCloskey also commented on the
death of Rep. Phil Burton, the liberal
Democratic representative from San
Francisco who died Sunday. While
saving that Burton "will be missed on


Pete McCloskey
the liberal wing of the Democratic
Party," McCloskey added that Bur
ton's influence on environmental
and labor legislation had waned
lately.

McCloskey, who represented a
district covering parts of San Matec
and Santa Clara counties for 15 years,
gave up his House seat to make an
unsuccessful bid for the Republican
nomination for the U.S. Senate last
spring. He received his bachelor's
and law degrees Irom Stanford and
now practices law on the peninsula.
