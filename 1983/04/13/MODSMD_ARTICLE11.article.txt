## Fighting sexism at Stanford 
### 
This week marks a series of ac
tivities surrounding the themp of
'Working against Sexism In choos
ing topics for the week, some ot us
were concerned that we would he
saving the same things to the same
audiences while a significant portion
of the campus would see the word
'sexism" and immediately dismiss
the week as unimportant. Such a re
sponse is puzzling. How can sexism,
a topic which seems so obviously
relevant to many of us be so easily
dismissed by many others?
On closer examination, there
seem to be three major reasons why
people in the Stanford community
consider sexism to be an unimpor
tant topic. First, and most impor
tantly, is the view that the battle
against sexism is over. Certainly
women have had to struggle for an
equal place in society, but they have
achieved their goals. Evidence
abounds at Stanford where confi
dent young women, who are prepar
ing to enter any number of success
ful career paths, appear to be sur
rounded by open-minded young
men who respect the intelligence

and integrity of their women friends.
There is no sexism for our genera
tion.
Second there is the belief that
those who argue about sexism havt=
no answers to otter While they may
be successful in pointing out a vari
ety of societal ills, the solutions of
fered are vague and idealistic at best.
Given that society is imperfect, who
has the time to listen to Utopian vis
ions?
Third, there is an image of
feminists and those who discuss
sexism as being life's social misfits.
Given that the major battle against
sexism has been won, the straggling
snipers are simply aimless, unhappy
people looking for a cause.
There is undoubtedly a variety of
campus opinions on sexism.
Nevertheless, we would like to ad
dress these three common beliefs.
First, while considerable progress
has been made, it does not necessar
ily follow that sexism no longer
exists. For those who believe that
major problems have been solved,
we would like to pose the following
questions:

- Did you know that a 1980 Boston
Globe article reported that 30 per
c enr of Berkeley's female seniors re
ported to have been sexually harras
sed by male intructors. The article
< ited results from other institutions
as high as 55 percent
— Did you know that a Redbook
survey of 6000 working women
found a significant number reporting
experiences with sexual harrassment
on the job?
— Did you know that one in five
college age adults have experienced
physical violence with their dates or
lovers while 78 percent believe that
this violence is not detrimental to
their relationships?
Considering these statistics, it is
dificult to conclude that women and
men have achieved a comfortable
balance for social and professional
interaction. It is also likely that these
dramatic cases are symptomatic of
other gender related problems in
modern society.
