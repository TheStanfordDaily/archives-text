# Coping through cooperation
## 
### 
It's 11:30 at night, and you've just spent four straight
hours in Meyer Library, cramming for a mid-term in the
history of French art from 1843 to 1846. You're sick of it
all and you want to catch the next bus back to Kansas
City. But you can't, so you go back to your house in
stead. You walk in and you find six of your friends stand
ing around the kitchen table, talking and eating hot,
fresh, homemade bread. Maybe things aren't so bad
after all.
Hot bread and kitchen conversations are a part of what
makes the co-operative houses (co-ops) here what they
are. So are meals cooked by students, low board bills,
and weekend housecleanings. They are much more
than that, however. In spite of their differences, the six
co-ops at Stanford (Columbae, Hammarskjold, Phi Psi,
Synergy, Terra and Theta Chi) all share a common dedi
cation to the principles and practices of co-operative
living.
Two of the basic principles of co-operatives (and there
are many types besides housing co-ops) are illustrated
by looking at the origins of two different systems of
student co-ops — the co-operatively owned student
housing in Berkeley, and the university-owned co-ops at
Stanford.
The Berkeley co-ops, perhaps theoldest in the nation,
were started in the depression years of the thirties be
cause co-operatives have ec onomic advantages. The re
liance on the members for various types ot labor gener
ates one kind of> savings; this is consistently demon
stiated at the Stanford co-ops as well, which have board
bills often less than half that of food service. And, in the
cases like Berkeley where the houses are student
owned, the rent is held down by the fact that the resi
dents are not paying for the owner's profits.
The Stanford co-ops were started for a different rea
son—they arose out of a desire for community through
co-operation. Students who were tired of hotel-like
dormitories and institutional food sought a way to put
into practice some of the ideals of group living. Students
were seeking greater control over their living arrange
ments, more responsibility for themselves and for each
other, and, to re-use the term I'm trying to define, a
more co-operative and loving home.
As we have probably all observed at one time or
another, Stanford can be a very competitive and often
alienating place. One of its functions is to serve as a
filtering system, channelling people into various places
in the society; and as such it is often seen as a means to
reaching some desired place. And the more competitive
we become, the less our residence seems like a home; it
becomes more like a group of people randomly thrown
together until they can get on to something else.
Living in a co-op, however, you are involved in the
basic day-in and day-out activities that sustain the lives of

you and your housemates. It helps you to realize that not
all of Stanford is means to an end. Vou have to ask
questions about your own needs and those ot the
people you live with, as you do in your family; and vou
have to take responsibility for seeing that those 'v>,. ( is
are met. In doing so, you come to see people ih .is
competitors for scarce resources, but as beings like your
selt who can give and receive as equals.
So much for the idealistK rhetoric What do o ops
look like in practice?
At all of the co-ops, cooking and cleaning is shared by
all the members of the house, The systems to
distribute the tasks vary; in fart it is one of the signify ant
aspects of the co-ops that the organ : zation of work is
determined by the people who will do it. As an ex- nple,
at Columbae, each person serves on a cook rrew once a
week (a standard practice). and likewise does one h< use
job a week. A certain number of jobs (ordering produce,
dairy products and other foods; managing the finances
sorting the phone bills) are taken care ot by one or two
volunteer managers.
The house jobs have at different times been assigned
different methods, including a simple work wheel, a "d<
what needs doing" approach, and a system of small
work teams. The number of systems 'hat Hav* Hppn
tried, discarded and tried again po'nN >t * \> i
about co-op life with equal responsibility y
irresponsibility. People are reluctant to criticize men
ber> who seem to be tree-loading, and there is m om
person whose job it is to oversee and dist iplme ii s
very easy to make an excuse about why hk>»« : gi tt your
job won't really matter; and after all, you do have <t
midterm Monday. . . .
And, just as there is non-cooperation at co-ops, it is
certainly true that there is co-operation in other types of
housing as well. The self-ops (which have hired < ooks),
the frats, and the trailers, for example, all have their
members involved in various forms of house mainte
nance. But there is still a difference. Perhaps one way to
express it is by saying that the co-ops make co-operation
an end in itself.
I feel as if I have just begun to scratch the surface
There is much more that could be said about co
operatives in general, and there could be books written
just on the differnces between the six co ops here But
better than that, go and visit one or two or three ot them
Check the draw book for schedules about informational
meetings. Or just drop by sometime It' ll , a rare co-op
ster who wouldn't love to tell a stranger about the house
she or he lives in.
