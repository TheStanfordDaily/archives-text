## Letter on threat to biology lab uninformed 
### 
I would like to respond to the un
fortunate letter from Joe Isner re
garding the biology undergraduate
laboratories. As Isner describes, the
Biology Department began an in
novative new program of biology
laboratories four years ago. This pro
gram was designed and im
plemented by Prof. Dow Woodward
with the support and encourage
ment of the faculty. The program has
been structured in a way that en
courages independent thinking and
self-motivation. Isner was correct in
this regard but little else.
The Undergraduate Studies Com
mittee of the Biology Department
each year reviews the departmental
curriculum The evaluation this year
has focused on our core courses:
Biology 40, 41, 42, 43, 44x and 44y.
Isner, an undergraduate teaching as
sistant in the labs, has participated in
some of those discussions but has
somehow misunderstood, misrepre
sented and inappropriately pub
licized the committee's discussions.
I would like to correct the major fac
tual errors contained in his letter.
-The Biology Department has not
proposed a new program to replace
the current one.
-We have not proposed replace
ment of current experiments with
the "cookbook" type.
-We have not proposed limiting
access to the laboratories to three
hours per week.
-We have not proposed replace
ment of most of the undergraduate
TAs with graduate students.
-We do not feel "that under
graduates do not know what's good
for them."
The Undergraduate Study c ommit

tee has discussed ways in which the
current program could be improved.
Even those most closely associated
with the program recognize areas of
possible improvement, not surpris
ing for something that is a radical de
parture from traditional laboratory
courses. We have discussed rede
sign or replacement of experiments
which do not work well, and we have
discussed ways in which the exper
tise and effectiveness of the teaching
assistants could be improved to
make the laboratory experience
more effective for our students.
It is unfortunate that Isner inter
prets these discussions as threats to
the program. Regrettably, his parti
cipation in the program has com
promised his objectivity in a way that
makes his contribution to further
improvements in our course offering
impossible. We will, however, con
tinue in this effort; our students de
serve no less.

Nuclear freeze
In his column, "Nuclear freeze
isn't solution" {Daily, April 12), Brian
Wildenthal states that . . it is a
simple fact that the Nuclear Freeze
would not solve the arms race . . .
and would not reduce the chances of
nuclear war, (because) it would
freeze into place an unacceptable
and dangerous situation and destroy
any incentive on the part of the
Soviets to take what is clearly the
only sane route out of our nuclear

madness."
Wildenthal later presents his rea
sonable solution: "It is imperative
. . . that we and the Soviets change
the mix of our nuclear arsenal to
eventually eliminate land-based mis
siles, while upgrading our
submarine-based missiles."
In response to Wildenthal's dis
cussion of land- versus submarine
based missiles, I feel that his is the
same "military strategist" type rea
soning that blinds people of the real
issues and got us into the arms race
in the first place. A nuclear missile
launched from a submarine does as
much insane destruction as one
launched from the ground. So,
perhaps putting our weapons under
the ocean waters will help ease the
threat of first-strike by a few incalcul
able percentage points.
I wouldn't feel any safer knowing
that the United States and the Soviets
have an equal number of missiles on
an equal number of submarines.
How long do you think it would take
for one of us to come up with a
technology to track submarines so
that they are no longer "invulnerable
targets" as Wildenthal calls them?
The nuclear freeze advocates be
lieve that freezing the situation as it is
now is merely a first step. The second
step is to eliminate existing nuclear
arsenals; not "freeze them into
place" as Wildenthal oversimplifies.
A nuclear freeze would not "de
stroy any incentive on the part of the
Soviets " Contrary to images created
by the media, the humans living in
Russia don't want to turn the earth
into a radioactive wasteland. They
have the same incredibly strong in
centive to freeze and eventually elim

inate nuclear weapons as we do: to
stay alive.
The only way to eliminate the
threat of nuclear weapons is to elim
inate all nuclear weapons, and an
immediate nuclear weapons freeze is
the first step. If this seems like an
"emotional, simplistic panacea," as
Wildenthal refers to it, perhaps
you're being blinded by "reasonable
and complex" solutions like Wil
denthal's, which simply continue the
ludicrous technological one
upmanship.

sonable solution: "It is imperative
. . . that we and the Soviets change
the mix of our nuclear arsenal to
eventually eliminate land-based mis
siles, while upgrading our
submarine-based missiles."
In response to Wildenthal's dis
cussion of land- versus submarine
based missiles, I feel that his is the
same "military strategist" type rea
soning that blinds people of the real
issues and got us into the arms race
in the first place. A nuclear missile
launched from a submarine does as
much insane destruction as one
launched from the ground. So,
perhaps putting our weapons under
the ocean waters will help ease the
threat of first-strike by a few incalcul
able percentage points.
I wouldn't feel any safer knowing
that the United States and the Soviets
have an equal number of missiles on
an equal number of submarines.
How long do you think it would take
for one of us to come up with a
technology to track submarines so
that they are no longer "invulnerable
targets" as Wildenthal calls them?
The nuclear freeze advocates be
lieve that freezing the situation as it is
now is merely a first step. The second
step is to eliminate existing nuclear
arsenals; not "freeze them into
place" as Wildenthal oversimplifies.
A nuclear freeze would not "de
stroy any incentive on the part of the
Soviets " Contrary to images created
by the media, the humans living in
Russia don't want to turn the earth
into a radioactive wasteland. They
have the same incredibly strong in
centive to freeze and eventually elim

inate nuclear weapons as we do: to
stay alive.
The only way to eliminate the
threat of nuclear weapons is to elim
inate all nuclear weapons, and an
immediate nuclear weapons freeze is
the first step. If this seems like an
"emotional, simplistic panacea," as
Wildenthal refers to it, perhaps
you're being blinded by "reasonable
and complex" solutions like Wil
denthal's, which simply continue the
ludicrous technological one
upmanship.

I would like to respond to the un
fortunate letter from Joe Isner re
garding the biology undergraduate
laboratories. As Isner describes, the
Biology Department began an in
novative new program of biology
laboratories four years ago. This pro
gram was designed and im
plemented by Prof. Dow Woodward
with the support and encourage
ment of the faculty. The program has
been structured in a way that en
courages independent thinking and
self-motivation. Isner was correct in
this regard but little else.
The Undergraduate Studies Com
mittee of the Biology Department
each year reviews the departmental
curriculum The evaluation this year
has focused on our core courses:
Biology 40, 41, 42, 43, 44x and 44y.
Isner, an undergraduate teaching as
sistant in the labs, has participated in
some of those discussions but has
somehow misunderstood, misrepre
sented and inappropriately pub
licized the committee's discussions.
I would like to correct the major fac
tual errors contained in his letter.
-The Biology Department has not
proposed a new program to replace
the current one.
-We have not proposed replace
ment of current experiments with
the "cookbook" type.
-We have not proposed limiting
access to the laboratories to three
hours per week.
-We have not proposed replace
ment of most of the undergraduate
TAs with graduate students.
-We do not feel "that under
graduates do not know what's good
for them."
The Undergraduate Study c ommit

tee has discussed ways in which the
current program could be improved.
Even those most closely associated
with the program recognize areas of
possible improvement, not surpris
ing for something that is a radical de
parture from traditional laboratory
courses. We have discussed rede
sign or replacement of experiments
which do not work well, and we have
discussed ways in which the exper
tise and effectiveness of the teaching
assistants could be improved to
make the laboratory experience
more effective for our students.
It is unfortunate that Isner inter
prets these discussions as threats to
the program. Regrettably, his parti
cipation in the program has com
promised his objectivity in a way that
makes his contribution to further
improvements in our course offering
impossible. We will, however, con
tinue in this effort; our students de
serve no less.

Nuclear freeze
In his column, "Nuclear freeze
isn't solution" {Daily, April 12), Brian
Wildenthal states that . . it is a
simple fact that the Nuclear Freeze
would not solve the arms race . . .
and would not reduce the chances of
nuclear war, (because) it would
freeze into place an unacceptable
and dangerous situation and destroy
any incentive on the part of the
Soviets to take what is clearly the
only sane route out of our nuclear

madness."
Wildenthal later presents his rea
sonable solution: "It is imperative
. . . that we and the Soviets change
the mix of our nuclear arsenal to
eventually eliminate land-based mis
siles, while upgrading our
submarine-based missiles."
