# COWELL
## Student health center offers a variety of services 
### JOHN BURNS 
Though Cowell Student
Health Center is not equipped
to handle all types of health
care, treatment offered "in
cludes practically all outpatient
services—x-rays, labs, physical
therapy, etc.," according to
Dr. James McClenahan, di
rector of Cowell.
Since Cowell is funded
through the general funds of
the University, McClenahan
finds it very important to avoid
costly double-coverage. Ap
proximately two-thirds of the
students have personal insur
ance through their families and
the other one-third are offered
the Stanford Student Supple
mental Blue Cross plan which
covers outpatient care at 80
percent of total costs with $25
per year deductible, all hos
pitalization and surgery as well
as dental care, eyeglasses,
drugs and cosmetic surgery are
not covered by Cowell. Care at
Cowell is also available for stu
dent families at a 15 percent
reduction from normal fees.
When care is not available at
Cowell and a specialist is
needed, the patient is directed
to the Palo Alto Medical Clinic
at 300 Homer Avenue. Stu

dents' biggest complaint about
this is the transportation has
sle, but B. Oaks, a registered
nurse in the infirmary for 13
years, finds that students al
most always can arrange a ride
from a friend, an RA or an RF.
The reasons that patients are
sent to the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic rather than the medical
school are two-fold. Besides
having a contract with Cowell
before the hospital was built,
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic is
less expensive and is a "pri
mary care-giving facility," ac
cording to McClenahan.
The Cowell staff includes in
ternists, nurses, general physi
cians, psychiatrists and psy
chologists as well as a
gynecologist, dermatologist,
and pediatrician. The infirmary
is open 24 hours per day and
can accomodate 28 patients
overnight, though six to 12 pa
tients is the norm. It is always
staffed by at least one regis
tered nurse and ward assistant,
and two doctors (medical and
psychological) are on call at all
times. Often the nurse will
consult the doctor about
treatment over the phone.
"Care is superior," accord
ing to Oaks, and she added

that, "this is not true of all
campuses." Student reactions
to this service seem to be
mixed. Sophomore Maria Lus
tik recalled the night she spent
at Cowell with a knee injury,
"They were so nice. They
wouldn't let me do anything,"
she said. On the contrary,
senior A.J. Mundt remembers
visiting Cowell with a bruised

knee cap and being told that it
would heal itself, only to later
pass out because he had not
properly elevated the leg.
Another main branch of the
health center is Counseling
and Psychological Services
(CAPS) which offers free, con
fidential short-term
psychotherapy, though one
must pay for long-term care.

Cowell's proximity to stu
dent residences makes it easily
accessible to students. Not only
is it easy for friends to visit pa
tients, but some students can
attend morning class and re
turn to a quiet bed in the even
ing.
There are numerous Cowell
health centers throughout the
state—from UCLA to Berkeley

to Davis. Though the buildings
are donated by the Cowell
foundation, the operation of
the facility is completely up to
each school. Now in its seven
teenth year of operation, the
"Cowell plan" seems to take
care of most all of the students'
medical needs, though the
care may not necessarily take
place on campus.
