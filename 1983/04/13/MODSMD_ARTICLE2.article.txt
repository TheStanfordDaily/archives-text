# High voter turnout for ASSU election
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Voter turnout yesterday appeared
to be up from last year as the long
awaited ASSU election got under
way.
Voting for the ASSU Senate and
next year's fee assessments will con
tinue until 9 p.m. today.
Although some current senators
attributed the apparent increase in
voters to a new ASSU rule which al
lows only those students who vote in
the election to claim fee assessment
refunds, students interviewed at the
polls said the rule had little impact on
them.
"I always vote," said junior Sarah
Carrel. She said although the fee as
sessment rule did not motivate her to
vote, it "caused me to see that I have
a say in the matter. The ASSU is run
by students."
Following the problems with last
year's elections, a lot of effort and a
$15,000 budget have gone into ensur
ing that nothing goes wrong this
year. According to Elections Com
missioner Craig Spearman, "Every
thing is running smoothly so far."
One expense which has been
questioned by some current
senators was the $700 used to pur
chase a set of walkie-talkies. Spear
man, nevertheless, insisted the set
was needed: "If we didn't have these
things, the election would be a disas
ter. It's essential that we be in con

stant contact with all of the polling
places in case they run out of ballots
or have some other sort of problem.
Many students complained about
the difficulty of choosing among 30
candidates running for 10 under
graduate senate seats. "I see all these
names and half of them I've never
even heard of before," said senior
Robert Houston. I only voted for
eight people."
Junior Bob Mulligan said he found
little reason to be concerned about
the senate elections. I don't follow
it (the ASSU) too much. It seems like
the elections won't affect me." He
was, however, concerned about the
fee assessment elections. "A lot of
these groups are important. I've
never gotten a refund. I can afford
the $14 or whatever it is."
According to Spearman, the
graduate turnout is "especially good
so far."
Yukiko Hanawa, a graduate stu
dent in history, said she was not cer
tain who to vote for in the graduate
senate race. "I'm sure that what the
senate does is important," she said,
"but I'm not always able to follow it. I
have no idea who these people
(graduates running for the senate)
are." She said she did not expect to
vote in the graduate senate election.
Hanawa did, however, support
many of the fee assessment initia
tives. "Many of the fee assessment
