# Spikers face UCSB tonight at Maples
## 
### 
Coach Fred Sturm and his
men's volleyball team will
have a second chance in a
week to play giant killer to
night when Stanford hosts
UC-Santa Barbara at 7:30
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Last Wednesday, the Car
dinal defeated No. 1-ranked
Hawaii in four games (15-12,
15-12,10-15, 15-3) at Maples
Pavilion in what Sturm
called the single biggest win
in the history of Stanford
men's volleyball.
UCSB was ranked first na
tionally earlier this season,
but dropped a pair of games
to the Rainbow at Hawaii.
The Gauchos are 22-7 over
all and 9-5 in the CIVA
(California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association),
good for third place.
Stanford is 8-14 overall

and in eighth place in the
nine-team conference at
3-11. Besides Hawaii, the
only team the Card has de
feated in the highly com
petitive OVA is Loyola-
Marymount, who has not
prevailed in a league match
all season.
While Stanford has not
played since its upset vic
tory over Hawaii, UCSB has
played three times, winning
twice. The Gauchos beat
USC and Loyola-
Marymount, but lost to
Pepperdine, a half game
behind first-place UCLA in
the CIVA.
In the teams' last meet
ing, the Gauchos were on
the favo' able end of a 15-13,
9-15, 15-4, 15-8 score in a
match played at Santa Bar
bara.
