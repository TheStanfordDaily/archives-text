# Card picks up three hoop recruits
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Although today is the official Na
tional Letter of Intent Day for college
basketball, Stanford has already signed
three recruits for next season.
In fact, coach Tom Davis signed the
trio to letters of intent Nov. 11 of last
year. Davis took advantage of a new
NCAA rule allowing high school
hoopsters to sign during an eight-day
period in November.
All three have been accepted and
plan to attend Stanford this fall
Topping the list is Novian Whitsitt, a
six-foot-one point guard from San
Pedro High School in San Pedro, Calif.
Grady Johnson, a 6-8 center, and Doug
Wall, a 6-6 forward, will join Whitsitt
next season
Whitsitt, a guard with unusual
quickness, averaged more than 20
points per game in both his junior and
senior seasons at San Pedro and is con
sidered one of the best guards to come
out of the Los Angeles area this year.
He is also a classical flutist and was
selected to be one of three scholarship
recipients to attend the Master Class at
the Los Angeles Music Center by Ann
Giles, the first flutist of the New York
Symphony Orchestra

Johnson, from Atlanta, Ga., was the
team captain at Booker T. Washington
High School and collected 15 points
and 10 rebounds per game this season
on a 14-10 team. He also averaged eight
blocked shots an outing. For his efforts,
he was named Honorable Mention All-
State.
Johnson, the president of his senior
class, just returned from Germany,
where he played on the American team
in the 12th annual Albert Schweitzer
Basketball Tournament. He also carries
a 3.86 gradepoint average, sings in the
gospel choir and is considering a major
in electrical engineering.
Davis' third recruit is Doug Wall from
Nevada Union High School in Grass Val
ley Calif Wall, while shooting 52 per
cent from the floor and 84 percent from
the free throw line, averaged 20.2
points and V 2 rebounds a game. Ne
vada Union finished the season with a
25-5 record.

Davis said yesterday he has not yet
given forward Johnny Rogers his re
leasp to talk to otherschools about their
basketball programs
Rogers, a 6-8 sophomore forward,
stopped out of school this quarter "to

evaluate the past two seasons at Stan
ford." He was named the Pacific-10
Conference Rookie of the Year in 1982
and averaged 10 plus points a game this
season, starting the final eight games for
the Cardinal.
"We're just trying to let Johnny sort
things out," Davis said. "Whatever is
best for Johnny is best for us."
Davis has indicated that Rogers has
three basic options: he tan return and
play for Stanford next fall, he can return
and redshirt here or he can transfer to
another school.
But Davis said he is in no hurry to
have Rogers reach a decision and con
sequently will not use his scholarship
for incoming recruits.

can team in the Games — the tour
naments will include the Japanese na
