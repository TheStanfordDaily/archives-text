## Sports SPOTLIGHT Freshman Root blooms on volleyball team 
### BETH KLEID 
lon Root, the starting middle blocker
on the Stanford volleyball team, was an
all-around athlete in high school. He
plaved basketball and particularly liked
baseball, and had plans to concentrate on
the latter sport.
But one day during his sophomore year
at Loyola High School in Los Angeles
things changed.
The volleyball coach came up to me
jrid asked me if I wanted to give volleyball
a try — it sounded like a good idea. I then

played organized volleyball in high
school tor two years and loved it,"Root
said.
"It was a freak thing that I started plav
ing volleyball.''
Root had no trouble learning vol
leyball. His b-foot-5 frame is an asset in
the sport, and Root is a natural athlete.
"Somebody just had to teach me what to
do, and I could do it,"he said.
In last week's upset victory over No. 1
ranked Hawaii, Root led the Stanford at
tack with 18 kills and a .394 hitting per
centage. On the season, he is second on
the team in kills with 159 and third in
hitting percentage at .263.
Out of high school, Root was one ot the
nation's top volleyball prospects, some
thing that prompted Stanford coach Fred
Sturm to predict that "lon could de
velop into one of the best middle bloc

kers we've ever had here."
Root continues to learn about the game
on Stanford's team. He had to make the
often difficult transition trom high school
to college volleyball, and he said that the
program here has helped to make that
transition a smooth one. "I have progres
sed since I came here, but I still have a
long wav to go."
Root is an aggressive athlete, and he
believes in being verbal on the court."I
want things to go right so badly that I can
get carried away," he said. Coming to
Stantord as a freshman, Root had to learn
not to act like a "freshman" on the court.
"Now I m really learning to control my
temperament. Once I accomplish this I
feel it will be one of my greatest personal
achievements," he noted.
Root is aware of his other weaknesses
on the court. He wants to improve his
digging skills and his back row defense,
but said he is generally satisfied with his
play this year.
Root is also satisfied with the men's
volleyball team here. "The one word that
describes the team is 'positive.' We are
such a young team, and with more expe
rience things will fall into place. We have
so much talent on the team, we just have
to pull it together. The past three years we
have gotten the top recruits out of high
schools."
The men's varsity volleyball Cardinals
have been a losing team for the past four
years, but Root sees a change in this
trend. I think that we are going to turn
around. When we beat No. 1 Hawaii (last
Wednesday), it showed what we can do
as a team. It really opened people's
eyes."
Root is looking forward to next season.
"This year we beat ourselves through our
own inexperience. Once we gain experi
ence I don't think that there will be a team
we can't handle."
As for his own personal goals, Root
would like to continue playing volleyball
after he graduates from college. "I want
to take it one step further," he said. "I
would like to play on a national team.
Who knows it might be the Olympics
fot me one day."
Last July, Root was a member of the
West team that won a gold medal at the
National Sports Festival in Indianapolis,
but he couldn't play because of an injury.
This summer Root will play on the team at
Colorado Springs, the site of this year's
Sports Festival.
Root has learned to combine
academics with athletics during his first
year here. "You just have to learn how to

allot your time.
"At first I placed limitations on myself; I
was worried about doing too much at one
time. Now I have adjusted and I'm not
that worried. I don't think I'll miss out on
anything in college because of vol
leyball," explained Root, who plans to
major in international relations.
As 1982's No. 2 recruit in the nation,

Root had the chance to play for top vol
leyball schools such as USC arid UCLA.
He is happy that he decided on Stanford.
"I would rather start from the bottom
and go up than start at the top. I like a
challenge. We are going to be the under
dogs for a while, until we prove ourselves
consistently. Then we are really going to
surprise people."

Colorado Springs, the site of this year's
Sports Festival.
Root has learned to combine
academics with athletics during his first
year here. "You just have to learn how to

allot your time.
"At first I placed limitations on myself; I
was worried about doing too much at one
time. Now I have adjusted and I'm not
that worried. I don't think I'll miss out on
anything in college because of vol
leyball," explained Root, who plans to
major in international relations.
As 1982's No. 2 recruit in the nation,

Root had the chance to play for top vol
leyball schools such as USC arid UCLA.
He is happy that he decided on Stanford.
"I would rather start from the bottom
and go up than start at the top. I like a
challenge. We are going to be the under
dogs for a while, until we prove ourselves
consistently. Then we are really going to
surprise people."

lon Root, the starting middle blocker
on the Stanford volleyball team, was an
all-around athlete in high school. He
plaved basketball and particularly liked
baseball, and had plans to concentrate on
the latter sport.
But one day during his sophomore year
at Loyola High School in Los Angeles
things changed.
The volleyball coach came up to me
jrid asked me if I wanted to give volleyball
a try — it sounded like a good idea. I then

played organized volleyball in high
school tor two years and loved it,"Root
said.
"It was a freak thing that I started plav
ing volleyball.''
Root had no trouble learning vol
leyball. His b-foot-5 frame is an asset in
the sport, and Root is a natural athlete.
"Somebody just had to teach me what to
do, and I could do it,"he said.
In last week's upset victory over No. 1
ranked Hawaii, Root led the Stanford at
tack with 18 kills and a .394 hitting per
centage. On the season, he is second on
the team in kills with 159 and third in
hitting percentage at .263.
Out of high school, Root was one ot the
nation's top volleyball prospects, some
thing that prompted Stanford coach Fred
Sturm to predict that "lon could de
velop into one of the best middle bloc

kers we've ever had here."
Root continues to learn about the game
on Stanford's team. He had to make the
often difficult transition trom high school
to college volleyball, and he said that the
program here has helped to make that
transition a smooth one. "I have progres
sed since I came here, but I still have a
long wav to go."
Root is an aggressive athlete, and he
believes in being verbal on the court."I
want things to go right so badly that I can
get carried away," he said. Coming to
Stantord as a freshman, Root had to learn
not to act like a "freshman" on the court.
"Now I m really learning to control my
temperament. Once I accomplish this I
feel it will be one of my greatest personal
achievements," he noted.
Root is aware of his other weaknesses
on the court. He wants to improve his
digging skills and his back row defense,
but said he is generally satisfied with his
play this year.
Root is also satisfied with the men's
volleyball team here. "The one word that
describes the team is 'positive.' We are
such a young team, and with more expe
rience things will fall into place. We have
so much talent on the team, we just have
to pull it together. The past three years we
have gotten the top recruits out of high
schools."
The men's varsity volleyball Cardinals
have been a losing team for the past four
years, but Root sees a change in this
trend. I think that we are going to turn
around. When we beat No. 1 Hawaii (last
Wednesday), it showed what we can do
as a team. It really opened people's
eyes."
Root is looking forward to next season.
"This year we beat ourselves through our
own inexperience. Once we gain experi
ence I don't think that there will be a team
we can't handle."
As for his own personal goals, Root
would like to continue playing volleyball
after he graduates from college. "I want
to take it one step further," he said. "I
would like to play on a national team.
Who knows it might be the Olympics
fot me one day."
Last July, Root was a member of the
West team that won a gold medal at the
National Sports Festival in Indianapolis,
but he couldn't play because of an injury.
This summer Root will play on the team at
Colorado Springs, the site of this year's
Sports Festival.
