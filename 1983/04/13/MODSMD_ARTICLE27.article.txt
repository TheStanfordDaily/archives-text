Ballesteros wins Masters
Augusta, Ga. — Seve Ballesteros,
bolstered by a birdie-eagle start, took ad
vantage of Tom Watson's three-putt self
destruction and stalked unchallenged to
a four-stroke victory Monday in the day
late windup of the 47th Masters golf tour
nament.
Ballesteros, 26, a Spaniard who twice
has declined credentials to play on the
American PGA Tour, acquired his third ti
tle in golf's Big Four events with a final
round 69 and a 280 total, eight strokes un
der par on the still-wet Augusta National
Golf Club course.
Ballesteros, winner of the 1979 British
Open and the 1980 Masters, took com
mand immediately with an approach shot
to six feet for a first-hole birdie and fol
lowed with a wood-club second shot to 10
feet for an eagle-three on the long N0.2
hole.

That put him in fronttostay. His playing
partner, Watson, once got close with a
long putt — perhaps 35 or 40feet — for an
eagle on the eighth. That halved
Ballesteros' lead to two strokes.
But Watson, twice a Masters winner
and the 1982 U.S. and British Open cham
pion, suddenly fell victim to problems
that were, for him, extremely unusual. He
calls the phenomena "hammer-mitts."
His putting touch, among the best in golf,
deserted him.
He three-putted three times in a row.
And Ballesteros was home safe.
"Ballesteros got off to such a good start,
he kind of put a damper on everyone's
spirits," said Tom Kite, who birdied the
last two holes. Kite, who has yet to win the
Masters, now has finished fifth or better
seven of the past eight years.
"He just blasted us. I'm surprised any
one could do that."
Ben Crenshaw and Kite, former team
mates at Texas, tied for second at 284.
Neither, however, ever really got in the ti
tle chase.
Watson, Player of the Year five of the
last six seasons, had protested all week
that he really wasn't playing well — "just
managing my way around the course," he
said.
He finished with a 73 and was at 285, five
strokes back of the man he was trying to
catch.

Arnold Palmer, the 53-year-old master
who gave his aging army a nostalgic thrill
with his first round 68, couldn't keep it
going. He struggled over the rolling hills,
still wet from the rains that washed out
Friday's play and disrupted the tour
nament schedule, in 78. He played the
back in 41 and finished at 2%.
A's beat Twins in 14
Oakland, Calif. — Bill Almon lined a
two-out single in the bottom of the 14th
inning to score Bob Kearney from second
base and give the Oakland A's a 4-3 vic
tory over the Minnesota Twins last night.
Kearney led off the 14th with a single
off losing pitcher Len Whitehouse, 0-1,
and was sacrificed to second by Tony Phil
lips. After Rickey Henderson was inten
tionally walked, Whitehouse struck out
Mike Davis. But Almon then singled to
right to make a winner out of Oakland re
liever Dave Beard, 2-0.
Oakland's jeff Burroughs had tied the
game at 3-3 by hitting reliever Ron Davis'
first pitch for a two-run homer with two
out in the bottom of the eighth inning.
Davis hits 2 HRs for SF
San Diego — Chili Davis homered twice
and right-hander Fred Breining con
tinued his mastery over San Diego, pacing
the San Francisco Giants to a 6-5 victory

over the Padres in a rain-delayed game
last night.
Davis, now with four homers this sea
son, cracked a two-run blast to right-cen
ter field in the first inning and added a
solo shot to left in the fourth.
A crowd of 45,397, which sat through a
54-minute rain delay in the eighth inning,
saw the Padres lose their fifth in a row de
spite a late rally.
Breining, 2-0, is now 5-0 lifetime against
the Padres. He also drove in the Giants'
fourth run with a fifth-inning single.
Steve Garvey, playing his first game at
home since being acquired by San Diego
as a free agent, accounted for the Padres'
first run with a fifth-inning homer, his first
blast of the year.
San Diego scored twice in the ninth as
Gene Richards singled, fetching reliever
Greg Minton, who got his second save.
NC State nixes Reagan visit
Raleigh, N.C. — North Carolina State's
championship basketball team finally lost
one in the closing minutes yesterday
when the NCAA ruled it could not accept
a company's offer to pay for a trip to meet
President Reagan.
Capitol Broadcasting Co., based in
Raleigh, had offered to pay for the trip to
Washington after it learned the university
could not pay the team's way. Air fare for

each player was $118. The total fare for 15
players would be $1,770.
Reagan invited the team to the White
House after it won the National Col
legiate Athletic Association cham
pionship on April 4 in Albuquerque,
N.M., beating Houston 54-52.
The team was to meet with Reagan
Monday, but the trip was delayed as the
NCAA's administrative council discussed
whetherto make an exception to a ban on
postseason travel outside a 100-mile limit.
The NCAA said the rules can only be
changed at the NCAA convention. The
next convention is scheduled for January
1984.
David Berst, director of enforcement
for the NCAA, said permission was de
nied because the trip because it was not
connected with intercollegiate competi
tion or an established award.
He said similar requests from North
Carolina, Indiana, and last year for the Al
abama football team also were denied.
He said the only way for team members to
make the trip is to pay their own way.
Coach Jim Valvano was unavailable for
comment, but two team members said
they, too, were disappointed .
"Somewhere along the way, they need
to make an exception," said forward
Thurl Bailey. "We wanted to meet the
president, and I think he wanted to meet
us, too."
