# Student unpaid loan rate here lower than national average
## 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
Even though about 7000 students here defer tuition
payments each quarter, the University suffers "very little
loss from late payments and enjoys one of the lowest
rates of delinquent loan payment in the country, accord
ing to University Bursar loseph )edd.
About 5000 students defer payment during advance
registration and about 1500 more defer on registration
day, according to Pamela Hansson, supervisor for stu
dent accounts receivable. Most of these students, she
said, pay off their deferments by the final due date,
which is 45 days after the start of classes.
Penalties for late payment can be severe. The Univer
sity can deny academic credit to students who re
peatedly fail to meet payments. This tactic, |edd said, is
not often used because students with delinquent pay
ments usually have "good reason" for being late.
"We've been pretty lenient about it,"he said.
)edd added that the University often tries to work out
individual payment schedules for students who have
trouble paying on time.
Students who repeatedly fail to meet payments with
out good reason, however, can face stiff penalties. A few
students in past years, Jedd said, have been prevented
from graduating because of failure or refusal to pay. A far
more common occurence is for the Office of the Bursar
to ask the registrar to withhold a student's transcripts.
About "700 or so" students, he said, have their trans
cripts held each quarter.

In even more drastic cases involving students who
have graduated without paying back money owed to the
University, ledd said, the Unviersity attempts to keep in
touch with the student through letters and phone calls.
As a last resort, he said, the University would send out a
collection agency to gather the funds. This tactic, he
said, is rarely practiced and has not been used this year.
Although additional fees are charged for late pay
ment, the University does not profit from these fees.
According to ledd, money from late fees is returned to
the fund for student loans.
Students here have generally been responsible about
meeting payments. Stanford, according to ledd, has a
lower delinquent payment rate than any of the Ivy
League universities.
While the national average for delinquent payment to
universities is 12 percent, he said, Stanford has a delin
quency rate of 3.5 percent. Because of this strong re
cord, the National Direct Student Loan program (NDSL)
has allotted Stanford $1 million extra this year for stu
dent loans.
About 13,000 past and present students are currently
taking or paying back loans to the University. Some of
these accounts, ledd said, go back as far as 20 years.
Although graduating students are usually given 10
years to pay back NDSL loans and six to nine months to
pay back loans from other sources, deadlines are often
extended for those who are unable to make payment.
University policy, )edd said, is to try to combine firm
ness with "compassion and understanding."
