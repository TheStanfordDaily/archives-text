# Discriminatory ritual cited
## Nine Kappa Sigs reject national group 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Nine members of the Stanford chapter of
Kappa Sigma have decided not to join their
fraternity brothers in a reaffiliation with the
Kappa Sigma national after a two-year split
caused by an initiation ceremony that "could be
interpreted as discriminatory by some individu
als," according to senior Gary Tyrrel, one of the
nine.
The local Beta Zeta chapter of Kappa Sigma
reaffiliated itself with the national fraternity last
week. The national group kicked out the Stan
ford chapter in 1981 when it became aware that

the local chapter was omitting parts of the initia
tion ritual.
Although the nine dissenting house members
will not be affiliated with the national fraternity,
they will continue to be active members of the
local chapter and are participating fully in this
week's rush activities, according to Robert Ivy,
Kappa Sigma media contact.
Tyrrel and Kappa Sigma resident assistant Alan
Hartford said they will not reaffiliate themselves
with the national because they believe that some
of the wording in the national's initiation ritual
could be interpreted as being religiously dis
criminatory. The other house members who will

not reaffiliate could not be reached for com
ment. But Ivy said that many of the nine left
because of "principles and things they can't
agree with "
Tyrrel said, "On a personal level I wasn't com
fortable with the agreement made with the na
tional and with certain secret rituals, which, in
my opinion, could be interpreted as discriminat
ory by some individuals, on a religious basis."
Because the fraternity's initiation ritual is sup
posed to be kept secret, Hartford would not say
exactly what in the ritual bothered him.
