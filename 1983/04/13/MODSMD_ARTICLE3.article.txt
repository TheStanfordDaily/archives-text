# Discriminatory ritual cited
## Nine Kappa Sigs reject national group 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Nine members of the Stanford chapter of
Kappa Sigma have decided not to join their
fraternity brothers in a reaffiliation with the
Kappa Sigma national after a two-year split
caused by an initiation ceremony that "could be
interpreted as discriminatory by some individu
als," according to senior Gary Tyrrel, one of the
nine.
The local Beta Zeta chapter of Kappa Sigma
reaffiliated itself with the national fraternity last
week. The national group kicked out the Stan
ford chapter in 1981 when it became aware that

the local chapter was omitting parts of the initia
tion ritual.
Although the nine dissenting house members
will not be affiliated with the national fraternity,
they will continue to be active members of the
local chapter and are participating fully in this
week's rush activities, according to Robert Ivy,
Kappa Sigma media contact.
Tyrrel and Kappa Sigma resident assistant Alan
Hartford said they will not reaffiliate themselves
with the national because they believe that some
of the wording in the national's initiation ritual
could be interpreted as being religiously dis
criminatory. The other house members who will

not reaffiliate could not be reached for com
ment. But Ivy said that many of the nine left
because of "principles and things they can't
agree with "
Tyrrel said, "On a personal level I wasn't com
fortable with the agreement made with the na
tional and with certain secret rituals, which, in
my opinion, could be interpreted as discriminat
ory by some individuals, on a religious basis."
Because the fraternity's initiation ritual is sup
posed to be kept secret, Hartford would not say
exactly what in the ritual bothered him.
"I can't really say. This is awfully difficult be
cause I can't go into the details because I'm not
supposed to say. I just really don't feel comforta
ble with the way it (the ritual) is phrased. I sup
pose it has something to do with Cod, and it
might have something to do with ludeo-
Christian beliefs, but this is really just an in
terpretation," he said.
Hartford's decision not to reaffiliate has noth
ing to do with his own religious beliefs, he said.
"It's not that I'm an atheist or don't believe in
Cod, because I'm a Christian and I believe in
Cod. I just don't feel comfortable with the way
it's phrased."

Ivy said he is confident now that the local chap
ter is "not discriminating religiously," and that
any disagreements house members may have
with the initiation ceremony are strictly matters
of personal interpretation.
"It is all a matter of how to interpret wording in
the ritual. We came back and looked into it. We
talked to alums and a priest. We had been leaving
out some phrass (in the ritual) that, at the time,
we found objectionable and possibly dis
criminatory against potential members. Now the
wording is back in," Ivy said.
Ivy said the members who will not reaffiliate
have an interpretation of the ritual "that doesn't
coincide with the majority" of the members of
the local chapter.
Hartford agreed, saying, "I think this really
boils down to matters of personal interpretation.
Anytime a person looks at any kind of oath or
individual, each person has to look at it himself.

The house has looked at this foralong time, and I
personally don't feel comfortable with it (the
agreement to reaffiliate) the way it stands. But
the vast majority of the house doesn't have any
difficulty with it."
In a public statement given this week, Ivy and
chapter president Scott Debarger affirmed that
Kappa Sigma "does not discriminate on the basis
of race, religion or national origin; nor political
affiliation, scholastic achievement, physical
handicap or athletic ability."
Although it is once again affiliated with its na
tional, the local chapter will, in keeping with
University policy, remain "completely free of ex
ternal controls in matters of membership selec
tion and group governance, and will continue to
govern its collective behavior in accordance with
the principles embodied in the University's fun
damental standard," Ivy and Debarger wrote in
