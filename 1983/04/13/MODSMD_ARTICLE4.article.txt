# Sophomore receives Truman scholarship
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
The 98 students across the nation
who were selected to receive a
$20,000 Harry S Truman Memorial
Scholarship were notified of their
success Monday — and an elated
Stanford sophomore was one of the
lucky winners.
Alice Wells, 19, was awarded one
of the prestigious scholarships,
which are given to students who
demonstrate outstanding leadership
potential and a commitment to pur
sue a career in public service. The
award consists of an annual stipend
of $5000 over the next four years.
The scholarship came as a "nice
surprise," Wells said.
"I didn't think I was going to get
it," she said, especially after a "con
frontational" regional interview with
three political science professors
from the Washington area. "I didn't
see any hope after that interview,"
she said. But when she saw the "big,
fat'' envelope addressed to her
Monday, she knew that she had won.
Their universities nominated the
scholarship recipients for the award.
The staff of the Truman Foundation
in Washington, D.C., reviewed the
nominations and selected the semi
finalists.

The semi-finalists were then inter
viewed at the regional level. Each
state finally selected one scholarship
recipient; in addition, 48 at-large
scholars were chosen. Wells, who
comes from Bainbridge Island,
Washington, is an at-large scholar.
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall, chairman of the committee
which selects Stanford's nominees
for the scholarship, said he was "just


Alice Wells
delighted" that Wells had won.
According to Marshall, Stanford
has "one of the best records in the
nation" in having Truman Schol
arship winners. Stanford usually
makes an impressive showing be
cause the University takes the schol
arship seriously, tries hard to get
many applications and has superior
students, he said.
"I don't want to be too chauvinis
tic," he said, but "we're just better."
According to Wells, the long appli
cation process, which began in Oc
tober, has slightly numbed the reality
of receiving the scholarship. "It
hasn't really sunk in," she said.
The sophomore, a resident of

Zapata and one of the editors of Ap
proaching Stanford, works 15 to 20
hours a week at deCuerre Pool and
"locking up Stern Hall" for Residen
tial Education. She is also a member
of the Program Board and thechairof
the ASSU Nominations Commission.
Wells, whose major is "probably
poli sci," tentatively plans to use the
$10,000 allotted for graduate study to
attend law school or graduate school
in international relations.
Stanford students have a competi
tive edge in getting regional inter
views, Wells said, because of the
University's academic reputation.
The Stanford nomination was proba
bly the "most competitive step," she
said.
Two Stanford students have re
ceived the award in each of the past
two years.
