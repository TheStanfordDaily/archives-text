Washington edges Epton
Chicago — Rep. Harold Washington won the
election as Chicago's first black mayor late last
night, riding a huge black turnout and strong
Hispanic support to thwart Bernard Epton's bid
to become the city's first Republican mayor in
half a century.
The 60-year-old two-term Democratic con
gressman's victory margin was less than 5 per
cent of the nearly 1.3 million votes cast in the
city's biggest election turnout since the 1944
presidential race.
With 2793 of 2914 precincts reported, Wash
ington had 636,136 votes or 51.5 percent, to

595,694 or 48.2 percent for Epton. Socialist F.d
Warren had 3590 votes.
Board of Elections Commissioners spokes
man Tom Leach said the outstanding votes were
concentrated in three lakefront wards, where
Washington could be expected to do well, and
four predominantly black wards of the city.
Epton had refused to concede late last night,
claiming he would emerge the victor from a
"neck-and-neck" finish.
Washington benefitted from an exceptional
black turnout, and his campaign manager Al
Raby said he was running better than 50 percent
among the swing Hispanic voters.
Massive numbers of whites who voted Dem
ocratic in the primary switched to Epton. But

Washington ran better among whites than he
had in the February primary — up from 6 per
cent to about 20 percent, according to an As
sociated Press-WMAQ-TV sampling.
Bigger cutback requested
Washington —The United States has pro
posed at the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks
(START) in Geneva that the Soviet Union make
much bigger cuts in its long-range nuclear mis
sile forces than the Reagan administration has
indicated publicly, administration officials re
vealed yesterday.
The officials said the U.S. proposal at the START ne
gotiations would require Moscow to scrap roughly
two-thirds of its biggest and most powerful missiles
and more than 70 percent of all its multiple-warhead
missiles
President Reagan and top administration officials
have described the U.S. proposal, made in Geneva
last June, as calling for each side to reduce its existing
force of intercontinental-range ballistic missiles to a
maximum of 850. The implication was that each su
perpower could decide what kinds of missiles to keep
within that limit.
Bargaining offered to Nicaragua
Washington — Responding to congressional
criticism of its Central American policies, the Reagan
administration yesterday declared its willingness to
negotiate with the Marxist Sandinista government of
Nicaragua, which it termed the key to peace in Cen
tral America.
Thomas Enders, assistant secretary of state for inter-
American affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee that "we are not going to give up" on ef
forts to get the Nicaraguan regime to engage in a "fair
and equitable dialogue" about its role in the region.
The United States has accused the regime of "ex
porting revolution" to El Salvador and other coun
tries.
As Enders defended administration policies, Dem
ocratic members of the House Foreign Affairs sub
committee on Latin America pushed through a series
of proposed restrictions on aid to El Salvador and oth
er Central American nations.
Enders said that his attempts to begin bilateral talks,
first made in August 1981, failed. Subsequent efforts
to bring Nicaragua to regional talks with its four Cen
tral American neighbors have yet to succeed.
Defeat of MX predicted
Washington — The congressman who led the suc
cessful fight to deny the Defense Department money
to produce the MX missile predicted yesterday that
the new nuclear weapon will finally go to its grave this
year.
But the MX critic, Rep. Joseph Addabbo (D-N.V.)
also said he believes the margin of defeat for the mis
sile will be far closer this time than the 245-176 vote
last December by which the House deleted the $988
million earmarked for building the first five missiles.
Addabbo, chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee on defense, said part of the reason,
besides the simple reluctance of some congressman
to kill the MX, is that a presidential advisory com
mission has linked its development to a proposal to
build a small, single-warhead missile that would be
more politically popular.
In what was seen as an effort to make the MX pro
gram more palatable, the panel recommended Mon
day that 100 of the 96-ton, 72-foot MX missiles be
placed in underground silos now housing Minute
man 111 weapons in Wyoming and Nebraska, while an
arsenal of 1000 15-ton mobile missiles is developed
and produced over the next decade.
Arms nomination debate begins
Washington — With about a dozen still-undecided
senators to determine the outcome, the Senate
opened a three-day showdown debate yesterday on
the controversial nomination of Deputy U.N. Am
bassador Kenneth Adelman to head the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
said he was increasingly confident that Adelman will
be confirmed, although the nomination came to the
Senate floor from the Foreign Relations Committee

with an unusual recommendation of disapproval.
The two-month battle over the nomination has
evolved into a contest between the White House and
Senate Democrats over arms control policy, using
Adelman as the vehicle tor debate. That linkage was
decried yesterday by Sen. Charles Percy (R-lll.) chair
man of the Foreign Relations Committee, who called
for approval of the 36-year-old nominee despite the
committee's 9-8 recommendation against confirma
tion.
The sources said it was crucial for the White House
and the Republican leadership to line up solid GOP
support for Adelman because it appeared that only
about six Democrats would support confirmation.
Adelman ran into serious trouble before the for
eign relations panel Jan. 27 when several senators said
they found him uninformed and lacking strong con
viction on arms control issues.
Oscar winner jailed
Los Angeles — A Polish emigre who won an
Academy Award Monday night for the best animated
short subject was arrested and jailed after he allegedly
kicked both a security guard and a sheriff's deputy in
the groin outside the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.
Investigators said deputies saw Zbigniew
Rvbczynaki, 34, kick the security guard shortly after
Rybczynaki walked out of the building where he had
received his Oscar. The awards ceremony was still in
progress.
"While Rvbczynaki was being taken into custody,
he kicked a sheriff's sergeant in the groin," said Depu
ty Ward Finch of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's In
formation Bureau.
The security guard and sergeant suffered "no in
jury, just pain," Finch said.
Rybczynaki did not have his statuette with him
when he was arrested, officers said.
Gandhi, which dominated the 55th Academy
Awards with eight Oscars Monday night, won best
picture and Ben Kingsley the best actor award. Meryl
Streep was named best actress for her role as the trag
ic Polish survivor of a concentration camp in Sophie's
Choice.
State land preserved
Washington — The House agreed by a 297-96 vote
yesterday to preserve 2.3 million acres of wilderness
in California, approving what Democratic con
gressmen called "a living memorial" to Rep. Phillip
Burton of San Francisco, who died over the weekend.
The bill, which Burton had hoped to push through
the congressional process himself this session, weath
ered an effort by Rep. Norman Shumway (R-Calif.) to
virtually halve the acreage of newly designated
roadless lands that would be kept wild and spared
future development except in a national emergency.
Stocks rise in strong trading
Stock prices gained ground for the fourth straight
session yesterday, leaving the Dow Jones industrial
average just short of a record high.
Nearly all other indicators of market trends did
reach new peaks, amid hopes that the recovery from
the recession would gather momentum in the months
ahead.
Dow Jones' average of 30 blue chips rose 3.49 to
1145.32, coming within a fraction of the all-time clos
ing high of 1145.90 it reached on March 24. Since last
Wednesday the average has gained almost 32 points.
Today's weather
Mostly sunny with highs in the upper 50s and 60s.
Northwest winds 10 to 20 mph during the afternoon,
lows in the 40s tonight.
