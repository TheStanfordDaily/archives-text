Washington edges Epton
Chicago — Rep. Harold Washington won the
election as Chicago's first black mayor late last
night, riding a huge black turnout and strong
Hispanic support to thwart Bernard Epton's bid
to become the city's first Republican mayor in
half a century.
The 60-year-old two-term Democratic con
gressman's victory margin was less than 5 per
cent of the nearly 1.3 million votes cast in the
city's biggest election turnout since the 1944
presidential race.
With 2793 of 2914 precincts reported, Wash
ington had 636,136 votes or 51.5 percent, to

595,694 or 48.2 percent for Epton. Socialist F.d
Warren had 3590 votes.
Board of Elections Commissioners spokes
man Tom Leach said the outstanding votes were
concentrated in three lakefront wards, where
Washington could be expected to do well, and
four predominantly black wards of the city.
Epton had refused to concede late last night,
claiming he would emerge the victor from a
"neck-and-neck" finish.
Washington benefitted from an exceptional
black turnout, and his campaign manager Al
Raby said he was running better than 50 percent
among the swing Hispanic voters.
Massive numbers of whites who voted Dem
ocratic in the primary switched to Epton. But

Washington ran better among whites than he
had in the February primary — up from 6 per
cent to about 20 percent, according to an As
sociated Press-WMAQ-TV sampling.
Bigger cutback requested
Washington —The United States has pro
posed at the Strategic Arms Reductions Talks
(START) in Geneva that the Soviet Union make
much bigger cuts in its long-range nuclear mis
sile forces than the Reagan administration has
indicated publicly, administration officials re
vealed yesterday.
