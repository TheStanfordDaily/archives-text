## University defends policies on graduate student housing 
### GLENN BAKER Staff writer 
A group of graduate students and University adminis
trators met at Escondido Village Center last night to once
again restate their positions regarding the increase in
room rates for graduate housing.
Graduate students here have protested the 1983-84
14.5 percent room rate hike, claiming that they must un
fairly bear the cost of the newly built undergraduate
housing at Governor's Corner.
The primary cause of concern for the Graduate Stu
dents Association, however, is not the increase in room
rates but the University's refusal to build new graduate
housing, according to GSA treasurer Eric Berg.
"We would like to see the University make a very defi
nite effort to build new graduate housing," Berg said.
But Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost and dean of grad
uate studies and research, said, "Although the University
has an open mind on the issue, there has not been a
strong case for the need of graduate housing on campus.
(University President) Don Kennedy hasn't seen it, and I
haven't seen it."
Although the University could make new graduate
housing in a shorter time and at a cheaper price than cur
rently thought, Lieberman said, "there has been no need
shown in the future (for such housing)." He added, "The
argument that graduate students are paying for under
graduate housing is counter-productive, for it will lead
to a cyclical happening of those who haven't been bene
fited recently complaining about those who have."
Berg, the only graduate student on the panel, re

iterated the graduate students' position that they would
gain nothing from the new housing, and thus should not
have to pay for it. Indeed, he said, the University has
always put undergraduate housing ahead of graduate
housing, even though graduate students have paid
equally for the housing.
The University position was given by Roger Whitney,
assistant dean of residential education, who said that the
construction of new undergraduate housing actually
opens an equal amount of spaces for graduate students
on campus.
About 800 undergraduates will be living in Governor's
Corner, opening up 450 spots in Manzanita, leaving
them with 350 total new spots. Because the University
will switch the trailer housing from four to three person
residences, graduates will get 350 new spots in Man
zanita, the same housing gain as undergraduates.
Housing Director Ed Scoles said the graduate students'
concern for new housing was met with "not a bright fi
nancial picture." Because of the $36 million price tag tor
Governor's Corner and the subsequent $4 million an
nual mortgage payment, the University is in a "debt situ
ation," he said. The University must pay this debt before
any new housing is begun.
Second, he said, "we must decide what is necessary.
The University has needs in the library and for new com
puters and these must be met first."
Scoles commented that it will probably be "the late
1980s before new graduate housing is likely to occur on
campus."
