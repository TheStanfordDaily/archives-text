## Aid to individuals, industry and the disabled through robotics Robotics maybe the stuff of science fiction 
### SHEILA HENNESSEY 
Hand in hand with the computer revolu
tion, a new revolution is occurring. And
perhaps even more than computers, it is the
stuff of which science fiction is made.
The new revolution is in the field of robo
tics t— the manufacture of robots for such
diverse applications as industry, use in the
home, and aids for the disabled. The last of
these applications has garnered a great deal
of publicity recently, particularly at Stan
ford, which is a forerunner in the research
and development of rehabilitative robotic
aids.
Funded by the Veterans Administration, a
group of engineers and specialists directed
by Stanford Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Larry Leifer, is conducting research at the
Rehabilitative Engineering Research and
Development (RER&D) center at the Veter
ans Administration Hospital in Palo Alto.
The group is attempting to develop a de
vice controlled by the disabled individual
through a computer, which would perform
tasks that otherwise require human care.
The outcome of this research could greatly
increase the self-sufficiency of severely dis
abled individuals, particularly quadraplegics
who, suffering from spinal injuries, have lost
the use of their legs and at least partial use of
their arms.
Clinical pretesting on the Stanford Robo
tic Aid, a robotic manipulator which resem
bles a large jointed "arm" with a two
fingered "hand," began at the VA Hospital in
1981. The device does not attempt to replace
the anatomy of a missing or disabled limb —
in fact, it is not in contact with the user's
body at all.
The device, mounted on a table, is instead
a small-scale industrial robot which has been
adapted for use as a rehabilitative robotic
aid. Stanford purchased the manipulator
arm and the computer which controls its
movements from Unimation, a robot man
ufacturing company.
In order to make the device more useful as
an aid for the disabled, more sophisticated
elements were added, such as voice recog
nition and voice synthesis units. This ena
bled the robotic aid to perform movements
in response to voice commands, and to pro
vide feedback to the user through an elec
tronic voice. Using a BASIC-like computer
language called VAL, the user comands the
manipulator to perform a pre-programmed
task, or gives the device a series of com
mands which cause it to perform a sequence

of pre-programmed movements, thus guid
ing the robot step by step through the mo
tions of a task.
At present the Stanford Robotic Aid is still
being tested, and research is being con
ducted toward improving the device. Ac
cording to John Walecka, a recent Stanford
graduate and a research assistant for the
project, some of the most important im
provements will be to mount the robot on a
mobile base and to install force sensors at
the wrist and on the hand. These sensors
would enable the manipulator to gain feed
back regarding the object it is working with,
such as the weight of the object or the
amount of pressure the manipulator is ap
plying to the object, and to correct its own
motions without intervention by the human

operator.
Both improvements are steps toward the
final goal of all areas of robotics: making
robots intelligent. This is the focus of re
search conducted at Stanford's Artificial In
telligence (Al) Laboratory in the basement of
Margaret Jacks Hall, funded by the National
Science Foundation.
According to a recent graduate of the
computer science PhD program who con
ducts research in the Al Lab, robotics is now
in its second stage. In the first stage the
robot did not interact with its environment.
The robot simply performed its tasks with
out gathering feedback from the objects
with which it came in contact. Even in to
day's second state, he said, "With the cur
rent state of manipulators (robotic devices),

there's no smarts at all there (in the robot)."
In other words, though today's robots use
force sensors to gain feedback from their
environment, they are unable to interpret
the information.
The robots of the future - the last stage of
robotics - will possess artificial intelligence,
enabling them to interpret sensory feed
back, and make their own decisions based
on this information. These intelligent
robots, when confronted with a command
to perform a task, will be able to think
through a plan of action and carry it out
without guidance from the human operator.
The present generation of robots, on the
other hand, can perform only pre
programmed motions or tasks. Because the
robot can perform only these learned mo

tions, it is not able to respond when pre
sented with uncertainties, or to adapt to
changes in its environment.
The environment must be carefully struc
tured in order to present the robot with the
exact situation in which it has learned a task
or motion. In other words, according to
Walecka, a robot can pick up a glass of water
if the glass is in the exact location where the
robot has been programmed to find it, or if
the human operator gives a series of com
mands telling the robot which direction to
move. "But it can't figure out that that's a
glass of water,'' he said. "And you can't just
say Go tind a glass of water ."
The robot is unable to think through all
the processes necessary to perform this
task. Robotic aids with artificial intelligence
will someday be able to make the decisions
necessary to perform a complicated task
such as this, while another feature will be
the ability of mobile robots to plan a path
around unforeseen obstacles.
Robots will also find a wider application in
industry when they are equipped with artifi
cial intelligence. At present they are limited
to use where their environment is very struc -
tured, such as welding and spray painting
applications, according to Walecka, in
which". . .they know exactly where the part
is and what to do with it." The robot is able to
repeat a learned motion without being con
fronted with unforeseen situations.
This will make industrial robots much
more cost-effective, since less money will
have to be spent in creating a suitably struc
tured environment. Robots will be able to
take over many tasks which now require
human labor in order to make judgements
and decisions.
Personal robots will also become popular
when artificial intelligence makes them cap
able of performing tasks in the home. A few
personal robots are already on the market,
and one model is said by its manufacturer,
Androbot Inc., to be the first commercial
robot to have artificial intelligence. How
ever, all it is capable of at present is wander
ing about avoiding objects.
According to Oussama Khatlib, research as
sociate at the Al Lab, "We are still far from
intelligent' robots." The obstacle to over
come before robots can move on to more
complicated tasks is developing the neces
sary computer software, and no one can be
certain when this will be accomplished.
Until that time, the thinking robot still be
longs to the realm of science fiction.
