# Controversy clouds election

### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
I he ASSU elections which ended yesterday may be
headed tor controversy even before the results are an
nounced tonight as several groups seeking fee assess
ments face the possibility of disqualification and one
senator charged a fellow senator with violation of elec
tion rules.
According to several sources in the ASSU, the Black
Student Union (BSU), Club Sports, KZSU, the ASSU
Lobby and the Women's Center may be recommended
for disqualification by Elections Commissioner Craig
Spearman because they failed to list their sponsor's
name on campaign posters. If the recommendation is
made, groups can be disqualified only by a vote of the
ASSU Senate. Most senators contacted said they did not
expect the senate to vote for disqualification of any of
the groups.
"Although this is valid grounds for disqualification,
the senate has the option of not enforcing the rule,"
senator Roland Van Gaalen said. "I would be very much
against disqualification."
Senator Charlie Jackson, who reported some of the
campaign violations to the Elections Commission, said.
"I would anticipate that the senate will allow the groups
to continue on the ballot."
Some senators said they felt that many of the election

rules were unnecessary although the election reform bill
was approved overwhelmingly when it was presented to
the senate earlier this year.
"They (the authors of the election reform bill) tried to
make it so everything would be very explicit, but I think
we went too far," senator David Porter said. "We're
going to have to look at the good and bad points of this
election and refine the system."
Speaking as a representative of the BSU. Porter said,
"We printed 5000 flyers before we became aware of the
rule. We put all the flyers through a mimeograph ma
chine so that the sponsor's name would appear on them
but the quality was less than perfect. We can't help it if
the copier missed a couple copies."
Richard Sobel, sponsor of the Club Sports fee assess
ment effort, discussed the extent of his group's violation
of the rules: "By the time we realized we had broken the
rules, it had been no more than 24 hours.
"At that point we just took all the signs down because
we figured that no matter what we did we would break
some little rule. The new rules were just too meticulous.
We appreciate all of (senator) Jim McCrath's (a principle
author of the election reform bill) efforts, and we hope
that he graduates next year."
lackson maintained, however, that "the rules were
tricky but many groups did comply with them." More
