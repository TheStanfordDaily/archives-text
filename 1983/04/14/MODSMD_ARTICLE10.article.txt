# Next move up to Arabs
## Radicals blamed

Compiled from news reports and wire
services
The Reagan administration
blamed Arab radicals Tuesday
for derailing President
Reagan's peace initiative and
suggested that the Palestinian
Liberation Organization no
longer deserves to be the des
ignated Arab spokesman for
the Palestinians.
At the White House, Reagan
declared that the United States
"will not permit the forces of
violence and terror to exercise
a veto over the peace process"
in the Middle East, and he
called on Palestinians and
moderate Arabs to choose be
tween "the status quo" and his
Sept. 1 peace initiative.
Addressing a news confer
ence, Secretary of State
George Shultz issued a similar
challenge to the Arab world.
While asserting the administra
tion's determination to press
the Reagan initiative, however,
Shultz in effect ruled out any
active U.S. steps to bringabout
that outcome.
But Shultz also proposed
that the PLO no longer de
serves the special role as "sole
legitimate representative of
the Palestinian people" con
ferred upon it by an Arab
League summit in 1974. Invok
ing the bureaucratic saying
"use it or lose it," Shultz said of
the PLO's special role: "I think
that if people have the ability to
do something or other, then
they ought to live up to those
responsibilities; and they
aren't doing so."
The net effect of Tuesday's
statements was to underline
administration frustration over
the PLO's effective veto of the
Reagan plan when it refused to
authorize Jordan's King Hus
sein to join peace talks with Is
rael. At the same time, the ad
ministration was suggesting it
is up to the Arabs to salvage
that plan.

"I don't think that we ought
to equate constructive efforts
with visible moves of some
kind," Shultz said when asked
whether he intended to travel
to the region or call a Camp
David style summit to revive
the peace initiative. "In fact,"
he added, "it may be that the
best thing we can do right now
is to keep quiet for a while."
"For our part, we will not
permit the forces of violence
and terror to exercise a veto
over the peace process," Re
agan said.
In his news conference,
ShulLz carried that point a step
further by suggesting that the
Arabs themselves are to blame
for handing the PLO a veto
over more moderate policies
when they designated the PLO
the sole representative of the
Palestinians at an Arab league
summit at Rabat in 1974.
The problem, he said, "was
created by the decision of the
Arab League to place on the
PLO the mantle of negotiator
for the Palestinian people. And
it's that decision that basically
King Hussein deferred to when
he looked for support in his ef
forts to enter the peace pro
cess."
With the disclaimer that the
Arabs would have to decide for
themselves whether to rescind
the Rabat decision as a first
step toward reviving the Re
agan initiative Shultz added,
"On the other hand, I wonder
if it isn't going to become appa
rent to people that when you
seem to give such power to a
radical group, you've made a
mistake."
Shultz left little doubt that he
believes the main responsibil
ity lies in Arab hands. Asked
whether the United States
should now press Israel for a
rapid withdrawal from Leba
non and a freeze on lewish set
tlements in occupied ter
ritories, Shultz responded with
a curt "no."
