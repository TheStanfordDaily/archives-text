## The
						Stanford Daily Election rules burdensome 
### 
Reflecting on ASSU election history, it is the
casualties of the process that are most quickly
brought to mind. There was the case of Chip
Roellig, a senatorial candidate denied a place on
the ballot because he neglected to put his name
on the back of the last page of his petition,
pleading his case to deaf ears in the ASSU Sen
ate. And there are the words of Ted Wheeler,
sponsor of the Speakers Bureau's ill-fated at
tempt to place itself on the fee assessment bal
lot: "I volunteered to be on the Speakers
Bureau because I wanted to bring speakers to
Stanford. For the past two weeks they have
forced me into the position of being a politi
cian."
Election reformers claimed that last year's
election fiasco was the result of an election pro
cess which was too loose and subjective. They
justified their attempts at codifying every aspect
of the election process by pointing to a need for
greater objectivity.
Although we basically agree with the line of
reasoning that led to the extensive reform
passed by the senate this year, we are saddened
by the fact that little reasoning went into the
reform itself. We believe the intricate web of
rules authored by a small minority of the senate
was designed in such a way as to make it ex
tremely difficult for groups to get fee assess
ments and for students to get on the ballot. This
legislation was then given the rubber-stamp ap
proval of a senate which was apparently too
busy to consider what effects the endless pages
of fine print might have on their constitutents —
students.

The net effect has been that one-fourth of all
groups which sought a spot on the fee assess
ment ballot were eliminated from the process
due to technicalities — the Speakers Bureau,
one of the worst offenders according to several
sources in the ASSU, was guilty of forgetting to
print its current budget alongside its projected
budget on the cover of each petition. In the
senate race, nine of the 39 original candidates
suffered the fate of Roellig and were eliminated
for one technicality or another.
It seems fairly clear that any election reform
which produced results such as these is in need
of additional reform. The most glaring flaw with
the current system is that there is virtually no
possibility of appeal for students and groups
that are not placed on the ballot. The elections
commissioner is simply bound by the rules to
act in a particular way regardless of the intent
behind any infraction.
Another problem concerns the excessive de
tail of the election rules. These rules need to be
reviewed and condensed so that their intent
and their language will be made clearer. Many
senatorial candidates and fee assessment spon
sors complained that they have trouble under
standing and interpreting the rules as they now
stand.
Judging from the rhetoric of their campaigns,
next year's senators will be much more con
cerned with the rights of students in the elec
tion process. We can only hope that some
among them will have the energy and the in
sight to attempt further reform of a system
which is clearly unwieldy and unjust.
