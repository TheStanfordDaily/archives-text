Though political campaigns may not be
memorable for the candidates in them, the
ideas that are conceived, stirred up or just
kicked around often are worth noting. In this
year's ASSU election, the stated opinions on
many of the issues were as diverse as the candi
dates themselves, but in interviews with the
candidates we noted many similar strains of
thought.
Most of the candidates in the recent election
were concerned with intangibles such as the
credibility, visibility and image of the ASSU. To
improve these weak areas candidates suggested
the need for greater visibility and a stronger
sensitivity to student concern by these leaders.
A more general thought implicit in the candi
dates statements, was the belief that the senate
shouid concentrate on meeting student needs
bv making the ASSU more ot a service body than
a legislative one. It was their belief that this
year s senate became bogged down in bureau
cratic haggling over mostly trivial legislative is
sues. Candidates criticized the inefficiency of
senate meetings, saying that the senate has be
come a forum for a few senators to exercise
their egos at the expense of efficiency and re
sponsiveness.
Some specific ideas are worth consideration.
One candidate proposed that each senator es
tablish a contact in his district dorm. This con

tact would inform the senator of dorm problems
while serving as a liaison between the dorm and
the senator. Other candidates proposed the
overhaul of the food service system. One advo
cated hiring a commercial food service com
pany and others wanted the institution of a
pay-as-you-go system. In response to the con
troversy over fee assessment proposals, candi
dates urged streamlining the process to rid it of
technicalities. Other ideas making the rounds
included the return of the ASSU Corre
spondent, better campus lighting, permanent
extension of library hours during Dead Week, a
student-run book exchange service, and, of
course, the ritual call for making Dead Week
more "dead."
Candidates vipwpd the current senate as iso
lated from a majority df the student body Can
didates said they would be responsive by being
responsible. To achieve this, the candidates ar
gued, requires a serious and continuing com
munication with students. It is not surprising
then that the election platforms promised ser
vices rather than legislation.
Of course, it is one thing to promise and
another to perform. With this in mind, we hope
the next student leaders will remember not
only that they were elected but why they were
elected.
