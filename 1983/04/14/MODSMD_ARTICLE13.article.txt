## Grads in co-ops is sensible... 
### 
I read with interest your editorial
entitled "Separate but equal hous
ing" (Daily, April 8), and while I agree
with your belief that the University
should address and seek long-term
solutions to the problems of
graduate student housing, I believe
that the reason for allowing some
graduate students to live in the
largely undergraduate co-ops is not
clearly articulated in the editorial. Al
though the editorial implies that the
reason for such mixing of the two
populations is to increase the
number of graduate students housed
on-campus, that is not the case. In
fact, the number of graduate stu
dents housed in the co-ops will be
offset by an equal number of under
graduate students being housed in
Manzanita Park next year, when that
facility becomes home for almost 300
single graduate students.
1 he primary reason for the integra
tion of graduates and under
graduates in the co-ops is that it
makes sense to do so. In recent years
graduate students and the co-ops
alike have requested this option. No
graduate student will be assigned to
a co-op unless he or she specifically
requests this type of housing. Given
the decreased demand on the part of
undergraduate students for co-op
living as evidenced by the difficulty
in tilling most of these houses with
students who have chosen them
specifically, and given the interest in
this housing option by graduate stu
dents, the Committee on Services to
Students-Residences and the Office
of Residential Education both feel it
wise to try mixing the two popula
tions.
They further believe that it is heal
thier for the co-ops to have residents
who desire and choose to live there
than to simply fill them with under
graduates who did not choose and
really do not want co-op living. Many
students and others feel that the na
ture of co-op living makes the dis
tinction between graduates and un
dergraduates meaningless for this
particular housing option. Many
graduate students have participated

in cooperative living when they were
undergraduates and will add a new
and valuable perspective to the co
ops, just as the graduate eating as
sociates do now. Moreover, by al
lowing some graduate students to
live in co-ops, we are able to provide
some spaces in Manzanita for under
graduates.
The net result of all of this is that
both graduate students and under
graduates will be housed in the kinds
of facilities in which they want to live
and the range of options available to
both categories of students is in
creased. Thus, the real purpose of
this new housing arrangement is to
maximize resident satisfaction, not
to increase the number of graduate
students housed on campus The lat
ter is an issue that continues to be
addressed. It is worth noting that
next year's integration of graduate
students and undergraduates in the
co-ops is an experiment that will be
evaluated before any decision is
made about continuing the ar
rangement for 1984-85.

. . .and practical
May I say that your editorial enti
tled "Separate but equal housing,"
concerning graduate students being
assigned to co-ops, was one of the
most uninformed pieces of non
sense I've ever read in this "newspa
per ." First of all, the editorial accuses
the plan of being "short-sighted." It
then goes on to suggest that the
co-ops be "consolidated" and that
one of them be turned over to
graduate housing. As an example of
the short-sightedness of that think
ing, consider the fraternities, which
several years ago were having their
own problems filling. At that time,
the only one that were converted
were the ones which could not wea
ther the times and therefore died
their own death. It would have been
a shame, looking at the popularity of

this year's rush, had the fraternities
been ruthlessly closed down and
changed into some other form when
the going was a little rough. And a
look at the numbers from last year
will show that the open spaces in the
co-ops were mainly confined to one
house and were not very large com
pared to the 230 co-op spaces in any
case.
But that is a minor gripe. My main
complaint is that the editorial dis
played an amazing lack of informa
tion about the reasons for the deci
sion. Putting graduate students in
the co-ops has almost nothing to do
with providing more housing for
graduates. The 44 spaces that are
being assigned are a trivial number
compared to the number of
graduates who want housing.
The sole reason that graduates
have been placed in the co-ops is
that, for some years, they have been
asking to be put there. The notion
that "grads and undergrads are two
different kinds of students" and that
they can't live together without caus
ing each other all kinds of problems
is hogwash. Since it's never been
tried here except in Mirrielees,
which is hardly more than an apart
ment complex, there is no reason
able basis to say surh a thing Andthe
fact that the graduates have been re
questing it, coupled with the fact that
the decision was made after asking
the coops whether they even wanted
grads and, if so, how many, shows
even more that both parties are at
least willing to give the situation a try.
In fact, I think that Res Ed is to be
congratulated, for once, for having
made a decision that satisfies all par
ties involved.
The kind of thinking displayed by
your editorial, if implemented,
would leadtoaone-dimensional, un
imaginative housing scheme, rather
than the varied one that now exists.
Next time you decide to address an
issue, please get at least some infor
mation from a source that can fill you
in on the facts.
