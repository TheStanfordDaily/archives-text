# The 						man, the myth, the t-shirt

The new 12-foot-tall statue of Dean
Fred White Plaza doesn't really
bother me. Nor did it bother me
when the Band formed Fred's profile
at Big Game. It also didn't bother me
when the hostages were given hon
orary Stanford acceptance letters a
few years ago.
It doesn't surprise me that the
facade of the Stanford Church now
reads "Faith," "Hope," "Love,"
"Charity," and "Cheers." And I have
to admit that the new Mattel Action
Fred Hargadon Doll 0 ® and Custom
lalopv Mustang 7 * are kind of cute. I
also saw The Dean Fred Story at the
Varsity last week, and I think that
Walter Matthau did a masterful job
portraying the great dean of admis
sions. But there's something about
the just-released Dean Fred T shirt
that irks me, and it's not that it
doesn't come in assorted new wave
colors,
For the time being let's forget
about the fact that the same $10 that
buys a Dean Fred T-shirt could also
buy:
— one one-thousandth of a used
BMW
— one-third of a Stanford application
— 333 pieces of Bazooka Bubble
Gum
— or three meals a day for a Third
World family for a year.
Certainly one of the reasons that
Dean Fred Action Sportswear per
turbs me is that most people proba
bly don't know the RFAL Dean Fred.
If people did know the real Dean
Fred, I don't think they'd want him
on their T-shirts, and they probably
wouldn't want him on their campus,
either.
Private sources have revealed to
me strong evidence that Fred Harga
don is/was responsible for:
— the Falklands War
— the Bay of Pigs crisis
— the loss of Big Game

— the current herpes epidemic
— Three-Mile Island
— the eruption of Mt. St. Helens
— the invention of leg warmers
— ear wax
— and acne.
As if this weren't bad enough, re
miniscent of the late )ohn Lennon,
Dean Hargadon was recently over
heard mumbling, "I'm bigger than
jesus Christ." Others claim that the
maniacal dean actually believes Him
self to be Christ: "Have you ever
seen the two of us together at a
party? I rest my case." I ask you, is
this the man you want to advertise on
YOUR T-shirt? (Note: an anagram for
Hargadon is "a god horn " We know
what this means!)
Vet despite his obvious flaws, I
have nothing against Dean Fred.
After all, if it weren't for my mother
and my father and Dean Fred, I
wouldn't hp hp>-e And I 'nust also
confess that ' hjyr- seen prod
only twice since I've been he r e
once in Gaieties thp othpr time I saw
Him walking across Lake Lagunita —
so I have little reason to be person
ally biased either for Fred or against
Him.
But's there's a more important
issue to be addressed here and it is
this: why does the Dean Fred T-shirt
exist? Pushing aside existentialist
philosophy, we can come up with a
number of reasonable explanations.
— Some Stanford students believe
that their acceptance to Stanford is
akin to St. Peter's selection of the
Chosen in Heaven; these students
thus feel greatly indebted to the man
who made it all possible. But this, of
course, is rather unlikely.
— People want to own Dean Fred
T-shirts because Dean Fred is a hand
some man, and the caricature of him
is handsome, as well. Everyone de
sires to possess what is beautiful.
— Dean Fred is a great guy, and we

want to show our appreciation
Him and the great job thai Mo <-j,
by wearing his likeness as oth<
might wear, say, a crucifix
Maybe the Dean Fred t-sh
shouldn't surprise me because *-v
ford students have ottt n show, n m,
gadon how much they ?pp r ecic<
Him. Take the Daily April FooN issi
for instance. Thp headline that o
read, "Hargadon to leave H|H Uni
for Harvard post." I find this c urioi
First of all, none o? my friends
other colleges know their dean
admissions by name first or la
Second, even if thev did know 112
name, these people
couldn't care less if Dean X left fo
"Harvard post."
So why do WE care so much abo
our dean of admissions and w 1
does He grace thp frr,nm of ou r
T-shirts? Is it because we feel !ik«
"chosen people" - lit«-• g or ' 1
Olympus, r-eam the

aren't. The Dean Fred T-shi r ' pvi'
either because:
— we cherish Dean Fred, the pers.
and we feel He should know this, <
— there's a market for it, and th." s
why it exists. At least I hope the
why the Dean Fred shirt exists
But why, one might then ask, do
we also have Donald Kenne
T-shirts, and Phil Zimbardo T-shii
and T-shirts for ALL of our oth
cherished Stanford stars?
Probably because each year, '
grettablv, there are many mo
people applying for demi god stat
at Stanford than can be acron

ified candidates have »o be turn
down all the time.

so I have little reason to be person
ally biased either for Fred or against
Him.
But's there's a more important
issue to be addressed here and it is
this: why does the Dean Fred T-shirt
exist? Pushing aside existentialist
philosophy, we can come up with a
number of reasonable explanations.
— Some Stanford students believe
that their acceptance to Stanford is
akin to St. Peter's selection of the
Chosen in Heaven; these students
thus feel greatly indebted to the man
who made it all possible. But this, of
course, is rather unlikely.
— People want to own Dean Fred
T-shirts because Dean Fred is a hand
some man, and the caricature of him
is handsome, as well. Everyone de
sires to possess what is beautiful.
— Dean Fred is a great guy, and we

want to show our appreciation
Him and the great job thai Mo <-j,
by wearing his likeness as oth<
might wear, say, a crucifix
Maybe the Dean Fred t-sh
shouldn't surprise me because *-v
ford students have ottt n show, n m,
gadon how much they ?pp r ecic<
Him. Take the Daily April FooN issi
for instance. Thp headline that o
read, "Hargadon to leave H|H Uni
for Harvard post." I find this c urioi
First of all, none o? my friends
other colleges know their dean
admissions by name first or la
Second, even if thev did know 112
name, these people
couldn't care less if Dean X left fo
"Harvard post."
So why do WE care so much abo
our dean of admissions and w 1
does He grace thp frr,nm of ou r
T-shirts? Is it because we feel !ik«

aren't. The Dean Fred T-shi r ' pvi'
either because:

and we feel He should know this, <
— there's a market for it, and th." s

why the Dean Fred shirt exists
But why, one might then ask, do

Probably because each year, '

The new 12-foot-tall statue of Dean
Fred White Plaza doesn't really
bother me. Nor did it bother me
when the Band formed Fred's profile
at Big Game. It also didn't bother me
when the hostages were given hon
orary Stanford acceptance letters a
few years ago.
It doesn't surprise me that the
facade of the Stanford Church now
reads "Faith," "Hope," "Love,"
"Charity," and "Cheers." And I have
to admit that the new Mattel Action
Fred Hargadon Doll 0 ® and Custom
lalopv Mustang 7 * are kind of cute. I
also saw The Dean Fred Story at the
Varsity last week, and I think that
Walter Matthau did a masterful job
portraying the great dean of admis
sions. But there's something about
the just-released Dean Fred T shirt
that irks me, and it's not that it
doesn't come in assorted new wave
colors,
For the time being let's forget
about the fact that the same $10 that
buys a Dean Fred T-shirt could also
buy:
— one one-thousandth of a used
BMW
— one-third of a Stanford application
— 333 pieces of Bazooka Bubble
Gum
— or three meals a day for a Third
World family for a year.
Certainly one of the reasons that
Dean Fred Action Sportswear per
turbs me is that most people proba
bly don't know the RFAL Dean Fred.
If people did know the real Dean
Fred, I don't think they'd want him
on their T-shirts, and they probably
wouldn't want him on their campus,
either.
Private sources have revealed to
me strong evidence that Fred Harga
don is/was responsible for:
— the Falklands War
— the Bay of Pigs crisis
— the loss of Big Game

— the current herpes epidemic
— Three-Mile Island
— the eruption of Mt. St. Helens
— the invention of leg warmers
— ear wax
— and acne.
As if this weren't bad enough, re
miniscent of the late )ohn Lennon,
Dean Hargadon was recently over
heard mumbling, "I'm bigger than
jesus Christ." Others claim that the
maniacal dean actually believes Him
self to be Christ: "Have you ever
seen the two of us together at a
party? I rest my case." I ask you, is
this the man you want to advertise on
YOUR T-shirt? (Note: an anagram for
Hargadon is "a god horn " We know
what this means!)
Vet despite his obvious flaws, I
have nothing against Dean Fred.
After all, if it weren't for my mother
and my father and Dean Fred, I
wouldn't hp hp>-e And I 'nust also
confess that ' hjyr- seen prod
only twice since I've been he r e
once in Gaieties thp othpr time I saw
Him walking across Lake Lagunita —
so I have little reason to be person
ally biased either for Fred or against
Him.
