# Housing draw nears; annual hysteria starts

From the observation deck of
Hoover Tower-oratop the footh
ills along the "dish"-the Stanford
campus looks like a homogenous
mass of connected red-tiled roofs;
an aerial view shows no variety
among the University buildings.
At ground level, however, even
the most casual observer sees a
striking diversity among the vari
ous structures known collectively
as sluc/ent rasir/«nces
With next week's housing draw
just around the corner, many stu
dents are overwhelmed by the de
tails of the draw system and
under-educated about what the
assorted housing options offer.
For the next three days the Daily
will explore the opinions and at
titudes of students concerning
Stanford's three main on-campus
housing alternatives - dor
mitories, co-operative and theme
houses, and row houses.
For most people, living in a
dormitory represents the epitome
of college residential life. Living in
a dorm means living co-ed. It
means institutional food. It means
study breaks and parties. It means

sharing your toothpaste. It means
lasting friendships.
At Stanford, it also means the
most popular form of campus
housing. More than half the un
dergraduates here live in dorms in
a given year, and nearly all spend
at least one of their four years in a
University dorm.
"Dorms are great because you
get to meet more people and you
have a hand in planning social
events," said Peter Boyle, a junior
in Toyon.
Students have the option — de
pending on the luck of the draw
of living anywhere from Mir
rielees to Stern Hall to Governor's
Corner; some call the golf course
their backyard, others the Cam
pus Shell station; some are
cramped in tight one-room Wil
bur doubles, others lounge in
spacious new suites.
Whether in all-freshmen,
three-class or four-class dorms,
most students are happy where
they are.
"Granted this isn't luxurious,
but it isn't bad either," said
sophomore Jon Wolf about his
Burbank abode. "It's been a very
good year."
