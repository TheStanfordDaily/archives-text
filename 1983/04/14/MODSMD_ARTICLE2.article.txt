# Housing draw nears; annual hysteria starts

From the observation deck of
Hoover Tower-oratop the footh
ills along the "dish"-the Stanford
campus looks like a homogenous
mass of connected red-tiled roofs;
an aerial view shows no variety
among the University buildings.
At ground level, however, even
the most casual observer sees a
striking diversity among the vari
ous structures known collectively
as sluc/ent rasir/«nces
With next week's housing draw
just around the corner, many stu
dents are overwhelmed by the de
tails of the draw system and
under-educated about what the
assorted housing options offer.
For the next three days the Daily
will explore the opinions and at
titudes of students concerning
Stanford's three main on-campus
housing alternatives - dor
mitories, co-operative and theme
houses, and row houses.
For most people, living in a
dormitory represents the epitome
of college residential life. Living in
a dorm means living co-ed. It
means institutional food. It means
study breaks and parties. It means

sharing your toothpaste. It means
lasting friendships.
At Stanford, it also means the
most popular form of campus
housing. More than half the un
dergraduates here live in dorms in
a given year, and nearly all spend
at least one of their four years in a
University dorm.
"Dorms are great because you
get to meet more people and you
have a hand in planning social
events," said Peter Boyle, a junior
in Toyon.
Students have the option — de
pending on the luck of the draw
of living anywhere from Mir
rielees to Stern Hall to Governor's
Corner; some call the golf course
their backyard, others the Cam
pus Shell station; some are
cramped in tight one-room Wil
bur doubles, others lounge in
spacious new suites.
Whether in all-freshmen,
three-class or four-class dorms,
most students are happy where
they are.
"Granted this isn't luxurious,
but it isn't bad either," said
sophomore Jon Wolf about his
Burbank abode. "It's been a very
good year."
Sophomore Ron Chin said of Yost House,
"The food is better, the rooms are better, the
furniture is better. The rest of campus just can't
compare."
"Toyon is a very positive place," said F.J Rol
lusson, a residential assistant in the dorm. "It
benefits by the fact that it's almost half
freshmen.
Toyon, with its two-room triples and over
head lofts, is usually popular in the draw. "It's
big (about 200 students). You meet a lot of
different people — you don't get stuck with
people you don't want to be with," said Boyle,
Toyon dorm president.
In a recent survey, Toyonites rated their dorm
1.4 on a scale of Ito 5, with I being "very good."
The extensive questionnaire touched on sub
jects including alcohol and drug use, sex, en
ergy conservation and the eating clubs.
The survey was conducted "to get the pulse of
the dorm," quipped Rollusson. Despite the
overwhelmingly positive response, some resi
dents found fault with the dorm: Toyon is too
hall-oriented, "it's dark," "the walls are too
thin" and it's not always clean. Several respon
dents were particularly upset by the evidently
messy occurrence of "throwing up and not
cleaning it up."
One of the great advantages of Toyon, accord
ing to residents, is the eating club system. All
members belong to one of the nearby clubs,
which provide social and cultural programs in
addition to meals. "It's a really good system
because students have control of what they're
eating. It mixes up the dorm; you eat with
people from all over, not just your hall," Rollus
son said.
"You know what's good about eating clubs?
Right now I'm going to get some blueberries,"
said Boyle, cup in hand. All eatingclub members
receive a key to the club and around-the-clock
snacking privileges. Indeed, the 24-hour avail
ability and assortment of food make eating clubs
attractive to many food service-regulars.
Yet sophomore john Powell, an eating club
member autumn quarter, characterizes them as
"greasy. They don't slice carrots — they rip 'em
apart. It's like the yellow brick road —all yellow
and weavy.
"Sure the kitchen is open 24 hours a day, but
you see the same food from day one. It just
changes color," he continued. "More often
than not they'll run out of food."
Meals are also a source of sorry-stomached
complaints in other dorms. "Stern food is the
one thing that's least attractive about this
place," said Burbank's jon Wolf. "It's the one
that matters — more than the small rooms and
limited space — because you have to put it in
your stomach. If you can tolerate food service,
Stern is fine," he said.

Although residents claim they don't get lost in
the cool intricate maze of locked doors and
connecting sundecks at Flo Mo, Speer finds
"that, like Wilbur, there's not much intermingl
ing between the (six) individual houses."
Freshman Carol Irish of Flo Mo's Cardenal
noted the advantages of four-class dorms. "It's
not too noisy, and you do get to seek out advice
from upperclassmen . . . although I would imag
ine you'd have more lasting friendships in an
all freshman dorm." Irish said that in four-class
dorms, "a small nucleus of frosh really organize
everything."
The still-new Independent Ftouses (EAST,
Murray and Yost) represent the first three-class
dorms on campus. Although everyone has been
raving about the lakeside accommodations,
some tind the absence of freshmen disturbing
or, perhaps, not disturbing enough.
It would be a little more enthusiastic around
here if there were freshmen," said sophomore
Tom Moore of Yost house.
"This is pretty dead, relative to freshmen
dorms," agreed Murray's Luann Teschmacher.
"Some people kind ot wish it was a little more
rowdy . . . things are pretty mellow around
here."
Another complaint about Governor's Corner
is that it is not central to the rest of campus.
"Sometimes it's a little far away," admitted Ron
Chin. "We had an IM game today and that was a
long way to go."
F3ut Teschmacher admitted that the physical
state of the new structures is somewhat less than
perfect. "Someof the rooms have paint cracking
already, leaking ceilings and faulty fire alarms."
One student quipped, "What were the builders
thinking when they glued this place together?"
Despite all the negative things one can say
about the new housing, many students recog
nize Governor's Corner — with the lake, driving
range, Roble field, tennis, basketball and vol
leyball courts only a stone's throw away — as the
best housing on campus. The added amenities
ot ice machines, sundecks, study rooms, com
puter outlets in the rooms, a student-run snack
shop and a white courtesy phone paging sys
tem combine to make it all "sound like a resort,"
according to Moore.
The completion and opening of Sterling Quad
next year, featuring four houses of 90 members
each, is predicted to bring additional interest
and attention to the east side of campus.
So whether you draw high or low, dorm life is
always an option on campus, fcven if you draw
4000 and can't get in your first — or even fifth —
choice, don't fret it. As Wolf noted, "The key
thing is the people. Wherever you live on the
Stanford campus you're going to meet a lot of
cool people."


THE DORM: It has much to offer. . .and in many different
contexts. Clockwise from the top left, the options appear:
Facing the exterior of Florence Moore; a student studying in
the posh surroundings of Murray House; the arches in Toyon
telescope down the hall; lofts are the theme structure of
Toyon; even the windowsills in the new housing are pretty.
