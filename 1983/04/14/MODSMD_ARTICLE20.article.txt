## John Sayles' 'Lianna': even when it's bad, it's good 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
lohn Sayles is such a waimly gifted, sim
patico writer that even when his projects
don't work out, the characters he draws cap
ture your imagination and charge you up,
and you replay scenes in your head months
afterwards. So far, he has had the best luck
with his short stories (collected in a pheno
menal volume called The Anarchists' Con
vention) and his wonderfully scripted first

one marvellously funny episode in which a
group of austerely dedicated leftists get
and lighten up. Even the worst pas
sages in Sayles show a burgeoning,
humanistic talent", a creatively skewed per
spective, and a burning curiosity about the

kinds of people and situations most writers
either neglect or neglect to examine with
real sensitivity So lianna, which (like Sec

edited, is rewarding arid memorable — even
when it's awful.
Lianna (Linda Griffiths) is married to a film
instructor, Dick (Jon DeVries) at a small, in
cestuous east coast college. She never com
pleted school herself because when she
began sleeping with Dick, she was still his
student, and he thought it inadvisable to
continue an academic relationship while
they were sharing a romantic one. Now, fed
up with the life of a faculty spouse, she and
her friend Sandy (Jo Henderson), the foot
ball coach's wife, enroll in a child psychol
ogy course taught in the evenings hv a visit
ing professor, Ruth (Jane Hallaren). Ruth
and Lianna become friends, then lovers —
and the growing rift between Lianna and
Dick, aggravated by his infidelities, deepens
irreparably when she confesses her own.
The movie concerns itself with Lianna's
adjustment to life alone, to her new lesbian
identity, to her estrangement from her chil
dren (Jessica Wight Mac Donald and Jesse
Solomon). It's a hopscotch movie — good
and bad scenes, cliches and fresh insights
alternate straight through. Sayles estab
lishes Lianna and Dick's disintegrating mar
riage in a trite sequence in which she comp
lains about her reluctance to help him out
with his research and she responds unen

thusiastically to his sexual overtures. (Any
post-Germaine Greer audience can predict
the movement of this scene.) But the first
sexual contact between lianna and Ruth is
unusually textured and a little ambiguous —
it's not clear who is making the advances.
And though there are dreadful, implausible
encounters between Lianna and her hus
band's prize student, Lianna and her new
landlady, Lianna and another woman at the
employment agency, they are balanced by

So Liana, which Sayles wrote /
directed and edited, is
rewarding and
memorable-even when it's
awful.

funny, offbeat passages — a conversation
between Lianna and her 13-year-old son
about his liberal English teacher, Ruth's
suggestion that Lianna call her kids for per
mission to stay to dinner, an irresistible ex
change between Griffiths and Maggie Renzi
(Katie in Secaucus Seven) as her friendly new
neighbor. Most of the material involving the
children is hopelessly bungled and painful,
but the last scene between Lianna and her
daughter — a reconciliation — has a sharp

tender, Shoot the Moon-like quality. You
can't guess which moments Sayles is going
to pull off.
The Canadian actress Linda Griffiths' face
has a hazy, slightly off-center beauty, which
the frizzy ends of her hair pick up; with her
prominent nose, she resembles some of the
French film actresses of the '30s (Orane De
mazis, Florelle, Daniele Parola). She has no
visible technique — and since I've never
seen her before, I don't know if she simply
suspended it to fit Sayles' scheme — but she
carries off some intensely difficult speeches,
and she uses her eyes for a subtle kind of
emotional shorthand, registering not only
hurt and anger but also, and more uncon
ventionally, sexual vibrancy. (She has a fine
scene of true liberation: having determined
she is really gay, she allows herself to watch
the women she passes on the street with
appreciation for the first time.) At first lane
Hallaren's steely eyes burn a hole in the
screen, and she makes Ruth flat and distant,
but she turns in a creditable performance,
with some felt moments that sound lower
notes than one might have imagined. (We
also find out why Ruth behaves in such a
coldly professional manner.)
Sayles has a taste for actors who don't
come off as actors on camera, and when he
works with someone like Linda Griffiths or
Jane Hallaren or Maggie Renzi, or when he
h'mself appears (he wrote himself a blue
ribbon part as Dick's lecherous buddy, and

he plays it superbly), the near-documentary
style he is trying for works. With others —

cessful. Henderson's reticence as an actress
weakens the friendship between Lianna and
Sandy, and so the affirmation of it, which is
the note Sayles chose to end the film on,
doesn't carry as much power as he must
have wanted.
Sayles isn't really a director yet — he
hasn't learned the value of long shots (he
should take a look at Local Hero), and the
abrupt, clumsy editing wrecks a couple of
key scenes. When he tries to be jazzy (in a
gay women's bar sequence) or lyrical (Lian
na's first lesbian experience), we can feel the
strain. But he's daring, and he keeps push
ing his writing talents through. His movies
say that even if you're not primarily a
filmmaker, there's a place foryou in movies;
we walk out feeling hopetul about Sayles
and thankful that there are ways (however
difficult they are to find) to finance indepen
dent filmmakers in this country.

Lianna (Linda Griffiths) is married to a film
instructor, Dick (Jon DeVries) at a small, in
cestuous east coast college. She never com
pleted school herself because when she
began sleeping with Dick, she was still his
student, and he thought it inadvisable to
continue an academic relationship while
they were sharing a romantic one. Now, fed
up with the life of a faculty spouse, she and
her friend Sandy (Jo Henderson), the foot
ball coach's wife, enroll in a child psychol
ogy course taught in the evenings hv a visit
ing professor, Ruth (Jane Hallaren). Ruth
and Lianna become friends, then lovers —
and the growing rift between Lianna and
Dick, aggravated by his infidelities, deepens
irreparably when she confesses her own.
The movie concerns itself with Lianna's
adjustment to life alone, to her new lesbian
identity, to her estrangement from her chil
dren (Jessica Wight Mac Donald and Jesse
Solomon). It's a hopscotch movie — good
and bad scenes, cliches and fresh insights
alternate straight through. Sayles estab
lishes Lianna and Dick's disintegrating mar
riage in a trite sequence in which she comp
lains about her reluctance to help him out
with his research and she responds unen

thusiastically to his sexual overtures. (Any
post-Germaine Greer audience can predict
the movement of this scene.) But the first
sexual contact between lianna and Ruth is
unusually textured and a little ambiguous —
it's not clear who is making the advances.
And though there are dreadful, implausible
encounters between Lianna and her hus
band's prize student, Lianna and her new
landlady, Lianna and another woman at the
employment agency, they are balanced by

funny, offbeat passages — a conversation
between Lianna and her 13-year-old son
about his liberal English teacher, Ruth's
suggestion that Lianna call her kids for per
mission to stay to dinner, an irresistible ex
change between Griffiths and Maggie Renzi
(Katie in Secaucus Seven) as her friendly new
neighbor. Most of the material involving the
children is hopelessly bungled and painful,
but the last scene between Lianna and her
daughter — a reconciliation — has a sharp

tender, Shoot the Moon-like quality. You
can't guess which moments Sayles is going
to pull off.
The Canadian actress Linda Griffiths' face
has a hazy, slightly off-center beauty, which
the frizzy ends of her hair pick up; with her
prominent nose, she resembles some of the
French film actresses of the '30s (Orane De
mazis, Florelle, Daniele Parola). She has no
visible technique — and since I've never
seen her before, I don't know if she simply
suspended it to fit Sayles' scheme — but she
carries off some intensely difficult speeches,
and she uses her eyes for a subtle kind of
emotional shorthand, registering not only
hurt and anger but also, and more uncon
ventionally, sexual vibrancy. (She has a fine
scene of true liberation: having determined
she is really gay, she allows herself to watch
the women she passes on the street with
appreciation for the first time.) At first lane
Hallaren's steely eyes burn a hole in the
screen, and she makes Ruth flat and distant,
but she turns in a creditable performance,
with some felt moments that sound lower
notes than one might have imagined. (We
also find out why Ruth behaves in such a
coldly professional manner.)
Sayles has a taste for actors who don't
come off as actors on camera, and when he
works with someone like Linda Griffiths or
Jane Hallaren or Maggie Renzi, or when he
h'mself appears (he wrote himself a blue
ribbon part as Dick's lecherous buddy, and

he plays it superbly), the near-documentary

cessful. Henderson's reticence as an actress
weakens the friendship between Lianna and
Sandy, and so the affirmation of it, which is
the note Sayles chose to end the film on,
doesn't carry as much power as he must
have wanted.
Sayles isn't really a director yet — he
hasn't learned the value of long shots (he
should take a look at Local Hero), and the
abrupt, clumsy editing wrecks a couple of
key scenes. When he tries to be jazzy (in a
gay women's bar sequence) or lyrical (Lian
na's first lesbian experience), we can feel the
strain. But he's daring, and he keeps push
ing his writing talents through. His movies
say that even if you're not primarily a
filmmaker, there's a place foryou in movies;
we walk out feeling hopetul about Sayles
and thankful that there are ways (however
difficult they are to find) to finance indepen
dent filmmakers in this country.
