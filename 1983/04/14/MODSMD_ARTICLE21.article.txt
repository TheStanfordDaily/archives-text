# A
						mishmash of Chekhov in 'Masha'

### MARC FAJER 
When Judith Dresch, director of the world pre
miere of Masha which opened Friday night at the
Manhattan Playhouse in Palo Alto, steps onto the
stage in the role of Matchmaker, Prokhorowna,
she is captivating. Amongst the collection of di->i
pated Russian aristocrats and stuffy nouveau ric he
who inhabit the play, this little peasant wo
man is a refreshing touch of humor and reality;
her accent and movements are genuine, and
knows how to deliver a line and get a laugh. Untor
tunately, Dresch's skill as an actress has not been
conveyed to the rest of the company, and the
result is a very long evening in the theater.
Masha, by Tim Kelly, is based on an Anton
Chekhov short story. The wit and poetr> of
Chekhov are not present, however, and the result
is close to an American stereotype of had
Chekhov: boredom. The play concerns a down
and out Russian family and the relations of the
daughter, Masha (Ewa Cabzdel), to two former ser
vants of the tamily who have gone on to become
successful as a banker and a doctor. There are
occasional witty or moving passages, but on the
whole, the play comes across as a fairly weak at

tempt at drawing room comedy.
There are real problems with many of the
characterizations. With the exception of the
banker, Furov, played very competently by Earl
Kern, the educated characters do not appear to
have the amount of schooling and literacy they
ought to. Both Masha and her mother (played by
Andrea Peck) are trying so hard to sound upper
class that they are almost incapable of speaking
like human being. Cabzdel in particular affects a
singsong delivery that can be very annoying. Pr
ince Yegor, Masha's brother, is played by Peter
Shapiro, who appears to be a much better actor
than either of the women. The characterization is
of an American spoiled rich kid, and is out of place
with the overplayed Aristocracy of the rest of his
family and with the nature of a Russian prince. Tim
Burkhard as the doctor Masha lovers is wooden
and unconvincing. He too shows no evidence of
the considerable schooling he. ought to have.
The two finest points in the show were Ed Cer
ney as the old servant Nikifor, and Susan Larson as
kalereiya, the lower class lover of Prince Yegor.
Cerney wanders around the stage grumbling
through his senilitv, and delivering almost every

truly tunny line in the show. His dying speech is
the most moving point in the whole evening. Lar
son sparkles as the conniving mistress, bringing
life to the stage when she is on it, and totally
stealing sympathy from Masha, who seems stuffy
and boring in comparison.
There were a variety of little technical gaffes that
further hindered the production. The old princes
ses make-up was blotchy and poorly done; she
looked scarred rather than old. A couple of times
the lighting of a single candle brought oceans of
light onto the stage. A bunch of flowers clunked
into a vase which didn't have water. Very long
American cigarettes were smoked. The addition of
gray hair to the doctor left gray paint on his face. In
addition, the passing of time was very muddy.
There were eight scenes in the play, but I have no
idea how much time passed between any of them.
Masha will be performed at the Manhattan
Playhouse Fridays and Saturdays through April. In
general, though there are a few bright spots, this is
not a very exciting production. It might, on the
whole, be wiser to leave Chekhov to Chekhov,
who, after all, did it quite well.
