# New office to aid handicapped
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
In response to a two-fold increase
in "self-identified" handicapped stu
dents over last year, the University
has established the Office of Services
to Physically Limited Students.
Located in Old Union room 307,
the office will accommodate the
needs of the almost 50 self-identified
physically limited students here, a
job that was previously handled by a
"number of different people in a
number of different roles," accord

ing to Jim Bouquin, head of the new
office. "But now we've put it all to
gether," he said.
"Any service regarding disabled
students in the past has been han
dled by various people in an ad hoc
sort of role. They were forced to be in
a role where they could respond to
emergencies. But with the creation
of a new office and a great deal of
support from the University, we're
going to be better equipped for
emergencies and for preventing
them before problems arise," Bou
quin said.
The new office will work to im
prove all aspects of life for Stanford's
growing physically limited popula
tion . "We want students to know tWat
they have someplace to go if they
have access problems anywhere, and
I don't mean just stairs," Bouquin
said.
"I mean things like if a hearing
impaired person is in a seminar, he
or she may need an oral interpreter.
We want students to know where to
go, and we want the University
community to know where to go. If a
problem arises, say, in the

Geophysics Department, we'll work
with the department and with the
students," Bouquin explained.
"We're in place now where we can
figure out with the housing depart
ment where the best housing is for
visually-impaired students, and how
we can assist in planning for them
ahead of time. We can help them
with academic planning too. Gener
ally vision-impaired students use
(audio) recorded textbooks. But
those tapes can take up to four weeks
to make. For the first time we can
have cassette tapes ready before they
enter classes," Bouquin said.
The new office is the University's
response to both the increasing
numbers of physically limited stu
dents here and to government guide
lines that tie federal funds to accessi
bility for handicapped students.
"We've done a lot of work on
structural accessibility and now
we're approaching the realm of pro
gram accessibility. There are legal
guidelines that say we have to make
things accessible. But certainly Stan
ford is going to go well beyong those
guidelines."
