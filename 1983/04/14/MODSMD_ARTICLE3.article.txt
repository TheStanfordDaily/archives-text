## 
### TROY EID Senior staff writer 
A Tresidder Union Board recom
mendation to administer all cash
food sales on campus has been re
turned to committee for further con
sideration.
"I think the idea of Tresidder tak
ing over all the food services on
campus would be inefficient and un
necessary," said Shi ila Scobba, head
of the Tresidder Union Board. "You
have to have a de-centralized food
service base on this campus."
The recommedations, presented
at a Tresidder Union Board meeting
Feb. 16, were designed to maintain
competitive prices among the
different food servicers at Stanford,
according to Tresidder Union Di
rector Ellen Qppenheim. They fea
tured a controversial request that
some food concessions, including
independent operations in academic
departments, would be adminis
tered by Tresidder.

Scobba called the original set of
recommendations "badly written
and inaccurate." She added that they
have been returned to the Tresidder
Food Committee to be rewritten be
fore the board will reconsider them.
"They were never in the form of a
proposal," Scobba said of the rec
ommendations. "It was just an idea. I
bear people no ill for reacting in a
negative way."
Tresidder Union Board member
said, "We wanted to develop a
University-wide food service plan
that would help everyone." She
added that the Food Committee
would meet again "within two
weeks" to consider additional rec
ommendations, which include the
possibility of an open-bid proposal
on food concessions around cam
pus.
Ray Bacchetti, vice provost for
management and budget, noted that
Tresidder Union has "a lot of respon
sibilities" regarding food service and
stressed that all the arguments must
be carefully weighed before a rea
sonable recommedation can be
made. He said he had not formed a
personal opinion concerning Tre
sidder's administration of food ser
vice.
Susan Crawford, offices services
managerfor the School of Education,
said she was "pleased" at the Board's
decision. Crawford said she had writ
ten a complaint to the Tresidder
Union Board following the an

nouncement of the original recom
mendations.
"I think the existing system works
well," Crawford said. "I'd like to
keep the status quo."
Paul Johnson, assistant dean of
administration for the Graduate
School of Business, expressed little
surprise over the Tresidder Union
Board decision.
"I don't really think that we ever
felt that Tresidder was going to take
over the food service," Johnson said,
referring to the student-operated
GSB lounge. He added that the Busi
ness School's concern was its "posi
tion should be maintained" in ad
ministering the lounge, which pro
vides funds for student activities.
