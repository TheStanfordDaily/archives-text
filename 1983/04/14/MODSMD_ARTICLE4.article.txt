Washington promises 'healing'
Chicago — Harold Washington promised an
"open-handed, healing" administration yesterday as
Chicago's first black mayor, but his defeated Re
publican opponent skipped a promised unity lunch
eon and left for a Florida vacation.
Bernard Epton, who lost a quest to be the city's first
Republican mayor in 52 years, dispatched his brother
to the reconciliation meeting with a note offering
"heartfelt congratulations" and pledging his "total
support."
Epton also apologized for missing the luncheon he
had said he would attend, win or lose. He said it was
impossible for him to attend and Washington said he
wasn't offended.

With 99 percent of the ballots counted, Washington
had 656,727 or 51.4 percent of the votes to 617,159 or
48.3 percent of the votes for Epton and 3,725 votes for
Socialist candidate Ed Warren.
Raiders win suit against NFL
Los Angeles — A federal jury awarded damages of
$11.5 million to the Los Angeles Raiders and $4.8 mil
lion to the Los Angeles Coliseum yesterday in their
antitrust suit against the National Football League,
with the amounts automatically trebled to about $49
million total.
The verdict in U.S. District Court came in the dam
ages phase of the antitrust suit won by the Raiders and
Coliseum against the NFL last spring.
The Raiders had asked about $20 million from the
league and the Coliseum asked approximately what it
was awarded.
In antitrust cases, damages awarded by juries are
automatically tripled unless reduced by the presiding
judge. They were not in this instance.
The damages phase of the antitrust trial, with Judge
Harry Pregerson presiding, lasted 17 days and the jury
of six women deliberated 24V2 hours. That was more
than four times longer than it took them to find last
spring that the NFL had violated federal antitrust laws
by blocking the Raiders' move from Oakland in 1980.
The Raiders managing general partner, Al Davis,
was in the courtroom when the damages verdict was
announced.
Maxwell Blecher, attorney for the Coliseum, ap
peared well satisfied, but he had said, "It's a certainty
the NFL will appeal."
Last May 7, the same jury found the NFL's rule 4.3
was in violation of antitrust law. It also determined the
league had not acted with "good faith and fair deal
ing" in handling the Raiders' situation.
Police detain Walesa
Gdansk, Poland — Lech Walesa had thought he
might be arrested Tuesday, just after he announced
that he had held clandestine talks over the weekend
with underground leadersof the banned Solidarity la
bor union that he once headed.
But police surprised him, waiting until yesterday
when they came to his home here, threatened to use
force if he resisted them, and took him away for five
hours of questioning as his wife shouted at them and
several of his seven children cried and screamed.
"You should abide by the laws," the hero of Po
land's crushed independent labor movement
chastised the police, who had come without a war
• rant.
Then, as they led him to their unmarked car, he
turned to me as I stood in the doorway of his home
and said, "Tell the whole world they are breaking the
law in an obvious way."
I had been interviewing Walesa's wife Danuta in
their apartment in a suburb of Gdansk yesterday af

te-noon when the police came and I waited with his
family and friends through the tense hours of uncer
tainty as they tried frantically to find out what was
happening to him.
When he returned five hours later, tired and tense,
he said he had refused to answer questions by the po
lice about his weekend talks and did not expect
further charges to be brought against him.
Nonetheless, he said, as he greeted his joyous fami
ly, "They once again stole several hours from my life."
Jerzy Urban, the chief spokesman for the Polish
government, said in Warsaw that Walesa had not
been charged but he gave no details of his detention.
Soviets open to freeze talks
Moscow — The proposed freeze on U.S. and Soviet
nuclear weapons would create the "appropriate at
mosphere" for arms reduction talks, say high-ranking
Soviet officials.
Three officials, in an interview yesterday with The
Associated Press, also indicated the Kremlin has not
closed the door to compromise in negotiations on
limiting "Euromissiles."
The U.S. House of Representatives ia scheduled to
vote on a resolution calling for immediate U.S.-Soviet
negotiations to seek a "mutual and verifiable freeze"
on testing, production and deployment of atomic
weapons and reductions in the number of existing
weapons.
Israel may cut dependence
Jerusalem — Defense Minister Moshe Arens said
yesterday that Israel must minimize its dependence
on U.S. weaponry as a result of President Reagan's
embargo on F-16 warplanes, which Arens described
as the gravest action ever taken against Israel by an
American president.
"There is no precedent for such an action in the 35
years of U.S.-Israel relations," Arens said. "It has nev
er happened, to the best of my knowledge, that an
American president said that delivery of aid, that the
U.S. was committed to deliver to us, was withheld on
condition that we make political concessions."

He said that as a result of the embargo, Israel was
impelled to reassess its entire arms purchasing policy.
"Already, I can say with confidence that such re
assessment will lead us to the conclusion that we must
minimize our dependence on outside sources," he
said.
"We'll have no comment until we see the whole in
terview," said a White House official who asked that
he not be named. "There's no question about the
American commitment to the security of Israel. The
president has made it clear over and over, most re
cently Monday night, that there will be no com
promise on the security of Israel."
DeLorean claims gov't conspiracy
Los Angeles — John De Lorean's defense team is
seeking a full scale evidentiary hearing to explore al
leged "improper government influences and ac
tivities" in the automaker's cocaine trafficking case, it
was disclosed in documents released by the trial
judge yesterday.
The De Lorean attorneys suggested a conspiracy ex
ists among government agencies to leak information
to the news media damaging to De Lorean and preju
dicing his right to a fair trial.
"Specifically, it now appears that representatives of
the Internal Revenue Service, the creditors' commit
tee of De Lorean Motor Company and the United
States Department of Justice have improperly shared
information, hunches and confidential information
among themselves and with the news media," the de
fense motion said.
.. The relationship now enjoyed among these
groups, if investigted by the government, would be
termed a conspiracy," the defense attorneys said.
The motion accused the IRS of having tried "at least
since 1979, to arrange a prosecution of John De
Lorean.
Latin American leaders meet
Tegucigalpa, Honduras — Attempting to avert a
threatened war between Honduras and Nicaragua
and to ease other regional conflicts, foreign ministers

of four Latin nations flew to Guatemala yesterday to

capitals.
In each nation, they met with heads of state and for
eign ministers. Winding up their talks in Guatemala
City, the foreign ministers were expected to confer
