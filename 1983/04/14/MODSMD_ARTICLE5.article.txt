# Proctoring violations to be investigated
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Since members of the Honor Code Commis
sion see "no possibility" that University adminis
trators will reprimand Chemistry Prof. James Col-
Iman for alleged Honor Code violations, the
commission decided yesterday to conduct a
widespread study of proctoring violations in
general, according to freshman Karen Ruth
Adams, commission chairman.
Adams said that, although she herself is certain
that Collman violated the Honor Code by having
teaching assistants stay in examination rooms,
"none of the members of the commission see
any possibility for Collman to be reprimanded
because the Honor Code is very vague and the
faculty has never had a binding part in it."
Council of Presidents member Mark Epstein
announced last week that he would charge Col
lman with violating the Monr»r r.orl« »-»v
VAs to remain in test rooms. Epstein took his
charges one step farther yesterday when he met

with Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sciences
David Kennedy to discuss the case, but neither
Kennedy nor Epstein was available for comment.
Adams said regardless of Epstein's action, she
anticipates that the University will take no action
against Collman. "I'm not exactly sure what Mark
plans to do, but I don't see that anything will
come out of it," she said.
Although the commission has no actual power
to try Collman for the alleged violations, it can
make recommendations to the offices of the
University president and provost as to how the
Collman case should be handled. But the com
mission decided yesterday that the best way to
stop proctoring here is to look at proctoring
practices in all parts of the University and not just
in Collman's chemistry classes.
"We decided that before we issued any sort of
statement to the administration (about the Col
\man Cntt*;) w« rweedodi to have a Viclter tor the
prevalence of proctoring, what the faculty sees
as their role, and what the students' view is and

whether they see proctoring as something that
needs to be dealt with," Adams said.
Adams said she expects her commission to
find that proctoring takes place mostly in the
science-related departments of the University.
"I think it's beyond the Chemistry Depart
ment, but it's my experience that the proctoring
is pretty concentrated in the sciences. There are
a lot of theories. I'm not sure what my personal
explanation would be, but there is the explana
tion that pre-meds are pretty intense. But I think
the engineers are pretty intense too, but they
don't seem to have that problem," Adams said.
The commission, she said, will now divide the
responsibility of studying the different aspects of
proctoring throughout the University. The
commission is interested in finding out why

proctor."
