# Transfer wins Truman Scholarship
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER 
A student who tranferred here
rom Evergreen Valley College at the
beginning of winter quarter won a
Harry S. Truman Memorial Schol
arship after being nominated by her
rormer school, the Daily learned yes
â€¢erday.
Sophomore Shawadean Bateman
will receive $5000 each year for the
next four years to pursue a career in
public service.
"It's really exciting. I was de
lighted," said Bateman, who is
California's recipient of the schol
arship. One student is chosen from
each state, and in addition, 48 at
large scholars representing national

regions are selected. Stanford
sophomore Alice Wells is one of this
year's at-large scholars.
Winning the Truman Scholarship
was particularly important, Bateman
said, because she would not have
had adequate funds to attend Stan
ford next year without the annual
stipend. The scholarship, however,
is based on leadership potential, not
financial need.
Bateman, 22, currently lives in
south San lose, where Evergreen Val
ley College is located, with her hus
band and two c hildren. She attended
Overfelt High School in south San
lose, but "dropped out very young,''
in 197f>. "I worked and helped sup

port my family," she said.
Bateman plans to supplement her
humanities honors major with
courses in biology and other sci
ences, in the hopes of attending
medical school.
She said she would eventually like
to work in "neighborhood like I grew
up in," promoting health care. She
referred to her native south San lose
neighborhood as "incredibly poor
and impoverished" and said, "I want
to go back there and do something
about it."
Bateman said that the University
"has made everything fine" for her
family because her mother is now
employed at SLAC.
