## Reagan's peace initiative suffers setback in Jordan U.S. tries to protect Hussein 
### 
Compiled trom news reports and wire services
U.S. officials are concerned about preserving
the American-Jordanian relationship in the af
termath of the collapse of talks on President
Reagan's Middle East peace initiative.
They are understood to be particularly anxi
ous to protect King Hussein from being made a
scapegoat in the failure of those efforts.
Those U.S. interests appear \T) explain, at least
in part, the reason for the stark differences in
assessments here and in Washington about the
prospects for reviving the peace plan soon.
The United States apparently plans to main
tain the Reagan initiative as a framework for
future efforts. Also, faint hopes remain that
Hussein's Sunday declaration terminating talks
with Palestine Liberation Organization Chair
man Yasser Arafat on the Reagan plan might
have shock value and cause moderate Arab
states to support a new effort.
It is understood, however, that the point has
been driven home to Reagan that Hussein him
self intends now to "hunker down" and wait to
see what Saudi Arabia, the PLO and the United
States do.
There is said to be strong appreciation by the
Reagan administration for what they see as Hus
sein's "artful" performance in trying to get an
agreement with Arafat to enable the king to re
spond positively to Reagan's initiative. The ad
ministration also is said to be understandingthat
once Arafat declined to do so, Hussein could
not take the large risk of breaking ranks with
fellow Arabs and entering talks alone.
It is understood that the upbeat statements
now coming out of Washington about the ef
forts were carefully constructed, at least in part,
tocredit Hussein with a strong effort and ascribe
the failure to radical PLO factions bent on doom
ing the initiative.
Hussein is described here as being relieved at
the initial reaction from Washington. Repor
tedly Jordanians here were concerned that if he
did not deliver, the monarchy would be held
responsible.
But the initial signals — Secretary of State
George Shultz's comments Monday and
Reagan's two telephone calls to Hussein on
Sunday, after Hussein had decided to make the
statement — have brought a measure of relief.
Jordanians and Western diplomats have said
that they think Arafat made a strong effort to get
his organization to support the initiative, but
questions are still being raised here whether he
was simply deceiving Hussein about reaching

tentative agreement in their intensive discus
sions.
The document that became the centerpiece of
negotiations set forth principles that would have
authorized Hussein to enter negotiations, but it
was not as specifically detailed as previous ac
counts indicated, knowledgeable sources said
here Tuesday.
The significance of the document, said one
who studied it and was an ardent suppoiter of
the initiative, was in its principles, both explicit
and implicit.
This person speculated that PLO leaders re
jected it because they understood that if Arafat
signed it, the PLO was "not only going to be in
the rear seat, they were going back there in the
rumble seat."
Jordanians reportedly counted heads when
they thought there was hope for beginning
negotiations and calculated that 17 of 21 Arab
states would be supportive.
It is this sentiment on which U.S hopes for
future moves in the context of the Reagan initia
tive are said to rest.
U.S. officials reportedly hope that the Saudis,
whose role is still regarded as "pivotal," might
"corner" Arafat and coax him into going along.
If not, they hope that Arafat might decide to
abandon his consensus-style politics and risk a
split within the PLO by agreeing to the peace
plan.
Another possibility is that the Arab world
might decide that the PLO is now an irrelevancy
and withdraw its status as sole legitimate repre
sentative of the Palestinians, removing the ob
stacle Hussein saw when he decided against en
tering talks alone after railing to reach agree
ment with Arafat.
There is a strong sense here that Reagan is not
going to change or alter the initiative he an
nounced on Sept. 1 although it is understood
that option papers for future diplomatic moves
are being prepared by U.S. officials here and in
Washington.
Some Jordanians still hope that the Europeans
might be helpful in getting the United States to
bend a bit on the issues of recognition of the
PLO and the right of self-determination for
Palestinians on the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza.
The United States has refused to recognize
the PLO until it recognizes Israel. The Reagan
plan envisions a Palestinian entity linked to Jor
dan on the West Bank and Gaza while the Pales
tinians demand a fully independent state of their
own.
