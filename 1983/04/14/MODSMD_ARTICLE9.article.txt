erty by Arab businessmen through six secret Caribbean com

A similar scheme is used by American tax cheaters and
drug traffickers, the committee was told.
Charles Kimball, a Miami real estate expert and frequent
consultant to state and federal law enforcement agencies,
testified that live Syrian and Iraqui investors had "laundered"
$7.8 million in proceeds from arms sales through companies in
the Netherlands Antilles from 1979 to 1981.
The so-called "shell" companies controlled by the Arab
group used PLO payments to help acquire office buildings,
luxury apartments and land in the Miami and Houston areas,
Kimball told the House Coverment Operations subcommittee
on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs.
Robert Edwards, deputy commissioner of the Florida De
partment of Law Enforcement, who testified with Kimball, told
reporters that he could not comment on whether the PLO case
was under official investigation.
Kimball said that a sworn affidavit by a former member of the
group, which told of weapons sales to the PLO, was part of a
little-noticed civil lawsuit in Miami that grew out of the invest
ments.
