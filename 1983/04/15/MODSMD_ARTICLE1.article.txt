In an election which boasted a voter turnout of 43
percent, the highest in more than a decade, the KSVP
slate of Vinnie Freda, Peter Spivack, Su Uhland and Karol
Watson took the Council of Presidents (COP) race by a
wide margin while nearly every fee assessment initiative,
with the exception of the Stanford Progressive Alliance
and the ASSU Lobby Office, was approved. Election
results are still preliminary as overseas ballots have yet to
be tallied.
In the undergraduate senate race, Donna Anderson
was the top vote-getter with 1576 votes. The remaining
nine senators-elect are: Jim Kohn, Mark Fleischauer,
Shawna Perry, Stephen Yamaguchi, Diane Harvey, Chris
O-Brien, David Porter, Bob Slater and Robert Blum.
For the first time in several years, representatives were
elected to fill every graduate senate seat. They are: Bill
lenkins, Law School; Kathy Colwell, Medical School;
Nathan Arnell, Education; Joseph Sweeney, Business;
Dirk Van Compernolle, Andy Cutler and Roc Blument
hal, Engineering; and Eric Berg, Jim McGrath and Eric
Diesel, Humanities and Sciences.
The victory in the senior class presidents race went to
Andy Chan, Trish Conroy, Rick Naimark and Susie
Rasinski of Mem Slate.
Despite numerous complaints with the election pro
cess this year, graduate senator James McGrath, a prin
cipal author of the election reform bill, said he thought
the election had been conducted well, especially in
comparison to last year's elections. "The much hated
election system worked," he said.
Future COP member Uhland reacted to news of the
win with: "We want to relate to students as students, not
as administrators. We aren't happy with the present
state of ASSU and the reputation it has with the student
body. We want to improve that image."
Freda also said he was concerned with student per

ceptions of the ASSU: "Usually the ASSU takes on the
image of the COP. We want that to be a good image."
Freda said he also hoped to improve the ASSU's rela
tionship with the press.
Spivack said, "I'd like to see the student government
as a positive force. We want to be for students. We're
going to end the era of ultra-professionalism. Our first
priority is to be student advocates."
Dana Price, sponsor of SPA's request for a fee assess
ment, said the loss "wasn't any huge surprise. I thought
we had a chance of winning because we put a lot of etfort
and money into the election. We got some bad press,
though. We were surprised when the Daily did not en
dorse us.
"I'd like to see more political opinions expressed and
having SPA on campus adds to that. I feel that people
think there's something wrong with expressing a strong
political opinion," she said.
Looking to next year, Price said, "I don't think our
campus will be as interesting without this funding. We
won't be able to put on as many programs next year but I
don't think SPA is going to die."
A representative of the lobby office could not be
reached for comment.
David Porter, a spokesman for the Black Student
Union (BSU) said he "didn't know how Stanford stu
dents would react" to the BSU's first attempt at getting a
fee assessment. "I was concerned," he said. "I guess I
always felt down deep that students would approve the
BSU."
"When I heard that our fee request had passed by 500
votes, it really made me happy," he said. "I think it
makes a good statement about Stanford students. Now
we'll be able to put a greater emphasis on programming
because we won't have to spend as much time on fun
draising."
Anderson said she was "shocked"
when the results were announced.
"It's going to hit me tomorrow. I'm
glad that the voters have faith in me.
Now I want to bring the interests of
the students to their government."
Fleischauer said he planned to
work for more "student involve
ment" in the ASSU. He also said his
first priority as a senator would be to
lobby the University for a combina
tion student ID-meal card, some
thing he touted in his campaign.
Chip Roellig, an undergraduate
write-in candidate who managed to
garner 12th place and a spot as a sen
ate alternate, said, "It's obvious from
the way the election was run that the
senate is too bureaucratic. I'd like to
see it loosen up a bit." Roellig was
not allowed a spot on the ballot when
he failed to place his name on the
back of the last page of his petition.
Conroy, one of the future senior
class presidents, said, "We have lots
of energy and we have new ideas,
like the Dean Fred Roast as well as
the usual senior activities like pub
nights. My favorite idea is to bring
back the train down to the USC foot
ball game."
Chan said, "We're really looking
forward to next year. We want to get
a lot of seniors involved in organizing
events and participating in them too.

We're psyched!"
Voters also approved a referen
dum on the Committee of 15, a group
which concerns itself with student
conduct issues that has been largely
inoperative this year. Sources in the
senate said the referendum will
make it possible for the committee to
more effectively oversee student

conduct next year.
A constitutional amendment of a
technical nature passed easily. The
amendment eliminates the district
ing of graduate senate seats. In the
next election, graduate senators will
be elected at-large in the same way
that undergraduate senators are cur
rently chosen.

In an election which boasted a voter turnout of 43
percent, the highest in more than a decade, the KSVP
slate of Vinnie Freda, Peter Spivack, Su Uhland and Karol
Watson took the Council of Presidents (COP) race by a
wide margin while nearly every fee assessment initiative,
with the exception of the Stanford Progressive Alliance
and the ASSU Lobby Office, was approved. Election
results are still preliminary as overseas ballots have yet to
be tallied.
In the undergraduate senate race, Donna Anderson
was the top vote-getter with 1576 votes. The remaining
nine senators-elect are: Jim Kohn, Mark Fleischauer,
Shawna Perry, Stephen Yamaguchi, Diane Harvey, Chris
O-Brien, David Porter, Bob Slater and Robert Blum.
For the first time in several years, representatives were
elected to fill every graduate senate seat. They are: Bill
lenkins, Law School; Kathy Colwell, Medical School;
Nathan Arnell, Education; Joseph Sweeney, Business;
Dirk Van Compernolle, Andy Cutler and Roc Blument
hal, Engineering; and Eric Berg, Jim McGrath and Eric
Diesel, Humanities and Sciences.
The victory in the senior class presidents race went to
Andy Chan, Trish Conroy, Rick Naimark and Susie
Rasinski of Mem Slate.
Despite numerous complaints with the election pro
cess this year, graduate senator James McGrath, a prin
cipal author of the election reform bill, said he thought
the election had been conducted well, especially in
comparison to last year's elections. "The much hated
election system worked," he said.
Future COP member Uhland reacted to news of the
win with: "We want to relate to students as students, not
as administrators. We aren't happy with the present
state of ASSU and the reputation it has with the student
body. We want to improve that image."
Freda also said he was concerned with student per

ceptions of the ASSU: "Usually the ASSU takes on the
image of the COP. We want that to be a good image."
Freda said he also hoped to improve the ASSU's rela
tionship with the press.
Spivack said, "I'd like to see the student government
as a positive force. We want to be for students. We're
going to end the era of ultra-professionalism. Our first
priority is to be student advocates."
Dana Price, sponsor of SPA's request for a fee assess
ment, said the loss "wasn't any huge surprise. I thought
we had a chance of winning because we put a lot of etfort
and money into the election. We got some bad press,
though. We were surprised when the Daily did not en
dorse us.
"I'd like to see more political opinions expressed and
having SPA on campus adds to that. I feel that people
think there's something wrong with expressing a strong
political opinion," she said.
Looking to next year, Price said, "I don't think our
campus will be as interesting without this funding. We
won't be able to put on as many programs next year but I
don't think SPA is going to die."
A representative of the lobby office could not be
reached for comment.
David Porter, a spokesman for the Black Student
Union (BSU) said he "didn't know how Stanford stu
dents would react" to the BSU's first attempt at getting a
fee assessment. "I was concerned," he said. "I guess I
always felt down deep that students would approve the
BSU."
"When I heard that our fee request had passed by 500
votes, it really made me happy," he said. "I think it
makes a good statement about Stanford students. Now
we'll be able to put a greater emphasis on programming
because we won't have to spend as much time on fun
draising."
Anderson said she was "shocked"
when the results were announced.
"It's going to hit me tomorrow. I'm
glad that the voters have faith in me.
Now I want to bring the interests of
the students to their government."
Fleischauer said he planned to
work for more "student involve
ment" in the ASSU. He also said his
first priority as a senator would be to
lobby the University for a combina
tion student ID-meal card, some
thing he touted in his campaign.
Chip Roellig, an undergraduate
write-in candidate who managed to
garner 12th place and a spot as a sen
ate alternate, said, "It's obvious from
the way the election was run that the
senate is too bureaucratic. I'd like to
see it loosen up a bit." Roellig was
not allowed a spot on the ballot when
he failed to place his name on the
back of the last page of his petition.
Conroy, one of the future senior
class presidents, said, "We have lots
of energy and we have new ideas,
like the Dean Fred Roast as well as
the usual senior activities like pub
nights. My favorite idea is to bring
back the train down to the USC foot
ball game."
Chan said, "We're really looking
forward to next year. We want to get
a lot of seniors involved in organizing
events and participating in them too.

We're psyched!"
Voters also approved a referen
dum on the Committee of 15, a group
which concerns itself with student
conduct issues that has been largely
inoperative this year. Sources in the
senate said the referendum will
make it possible for the committee to
more effectively oversee student

conduct next year.
A constitutional amendment of a
technical nature passed easily. The
amendment eliminates the district
ing of graduate senate seats. In the
next election, graduate senators will
be elected at-large in the same way
that undergraduate senators are cur
rently chosen.
