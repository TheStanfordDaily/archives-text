" Mex you make a difference in our

hie him to relaize it was just an illu
sion; but that illusion made him see
Stanford through a different prism.
He wrote of his ambivalence upon
leaving the new Moonie farm to
come back to the old ( ardinal farm:
"I was relieved to be on my own
iin but o sad. I'e 'Ole showed
me lov(■ in Ideal City, but I chose to
return to a plate where the pro
gramming w is easier to avoid, with
all mv struggles, loneliness and fair
weather friends."
Liter, Alex used his knowledge of
the standardized strategies em
ployed bv this cult to help a more
naive Stanford student to leave this
group which also had seemed so ap
pealing to her. But doing so meant
All x had to -hatter her illusions, too:
he helped her to "grow up" to the
realitie of a world where there is no
santa, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy or
fou I-weather friends. She was
helped to acknowledge the objective
reality of "making it" at Stanford and
the future benefits that iwaited the
Stanford graduate Tlt-m* would he
time then perhaps to make less sup
erficial friendships
Recently, it seerru d that Alex had
at las' i' si ned himself to traveling
alorv; the path thai his degree had
charted for him - medical school, and

in some vears to come, Alex Armour,
MD, a physician who would >ase
pain and relieve suffering of society's
sick.
But, that won't ever be because
Alex is dead now. Dead not from
fighting the gallant struggle against
all his enemies of indifference, ot un
loving, of blind ambition and of nu
clear war. He died on March 12, 1983
from a cocaine overdose. This won
derful, vibrant boy-man had to turn
to chemicals to get'what he never
could quite find enough of among
his fellow students and teachers - the
chemistry of caring that forms the
unbreakable human connection.
I think you would have loved Alex
too, if you knew him - if you could
have managed to find the time in
your busy schedule to get around to
really knowing him.
But it will serve his memory well il
each of us would begin'to give to one
another some of the substance thai
those strangers in some group'
called 'cults" make a business 01 ap
pearing to give Ireely - a little atten
tion, a deserved compliment, ;
smile, an embrace, and maybe ever
some love. And, at the risk of sound
mg old-fashioned, maybe the
time when we are about to re ,ea
from human contact behind the il
iusofy comfort of some drug o
other, you and I might pause to re
