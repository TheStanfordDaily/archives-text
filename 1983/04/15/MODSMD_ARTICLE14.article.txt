m - t Stanford date, lust what is it? How does
i ut experiencing it? If you put these questions
around campus, vou will get a variety of answers,
•itu will soy, "The perfect date is when the girl takes
m! '.-'vc rything. She keeps the conversation going,
ireiers the wine, she drives the car, she fixes the tire
n; el a flat and she is even the one who starts the
;;.aht kiss. I m sorrv to say it, but these guys are
sically losers.
r m-n will say "The perfect date is with a girl who
c ual about things. You can take her to Ramo
i'id she isn't going to have problems with
wn half o a medium stromboli. She will even
; ,li two or three beers with you. You don't have
ii i bout th«. way you dress either. You know she's
. »e v taring jeans and a sweater." The men who
thi are nice guys, but they're lazy.

Vt hi i.'i 'V'.-d to your friends that you could do it. This

w.-,uM v on: to go out with twice. Unless of course she
ft?i ; like heaiing about his life story twice.
\noth( t type of man on campus will say, "The perfect

dish. You .ind your date take picnic baskets to a peaceful

you b< h sto'tch out in the sun and fall asleep." This type
o. ;>r i; very t". uie and very well-adjusted. He may
be ■< lilt' i to mellow, though. Don't be surprised if he
falls asleep in a loud night club.

much, other than the fact that he is just plain lucky.
There is one final response that should be given con
sideration. Some guys will say, "]ust give me my chemis
try book and a seat in the library. The only person I'm
dating these days is Cecil Green." These guys are protu
bly getting As, but they must be bored.
These are the six responses that you will get from men
on campus. Now one must ask oneself, 'Is is really that
important to go on a perfect Stanford date ? Is it worth
the time and effort to find that special person? Wh t
about relationships? They take even more time and of
fort. Are they worthwhile?"

Some guys will say, "Just give me
my chemistry books and a seat at the
library. The only person I'm dating
these days is Cecil Green/'

I would say yes. To those who say that they have no
time for dating because they have to study, I would tell
them to inspect how much they really get done on
weekend nights in the library..To those who sav they
don't have the money for dating, I would tell them to
look at their checkbooks and see how much they have
spent on Domino's pizza in the past month. To those
who say there aren't any women at Stanford, I would tell
them to clear the cobwebs away from their eyes To
those who say that no girl would go out with them, I
would tell them not to be so wimpy and to give it a shot
Romance injects energy and excitement into our lives.
It's a great thing. And think of the future. In 40 years
we're all going to be sitting around fireplaces somewhere
with our spouses and granchildren. That will be a nice
time of life, but it certainly won't be overly ext iting. At
least not in the way a first or even second date can be
You've just got to go for it!
