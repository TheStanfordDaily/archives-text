Why do so few of the outdoor sculptures at
Stanford have plaques identifying the artist
and the title of the work?
It seems that an educational institution
should use every opportunity to educate.
Exetastes
It seems that way, does it? Well, it seems to
me that most of the outdoor sculptures here
do have plaques. A short list of
sculptures: Dirmtri Hadzi's Pillars of Hercules
111 and Francois Stahly's les Oiseaux Flam
tries, both at the GSB; Alexander Calder's Le
Faucon at the Law School; Kenneth Snelson's
Mozart I near Meyer Library; Bruce Beasley's
Vanguard behind the Law School; Benjamin
Bufano's Shadows of the Future behind Tre
sidder; Albers' Wall (the plaque is on the
grass, on the side facing the Quad;) and the
Pomodoro cube in front of the Museum.
Two other sculptures that aren't labeled
are meant to be: the Henry Moore piece that
stands between the Quad and Art Building
had a plaque, but it was stolen; and the new
Miro in the Annenberg Auditorium stairwell
will be given a plaque when it is dedicated
this summer.
According to Art History Prof. Albert Elsen,
a member of the University Panel on Out
door Art and somewhat of a magnet where
sculptures are concerned (he attracts them to
campus), there is no official policy regarding
the labeling of sculptures. In practice, he
said, sculptures are given plaques as a matter
of course.
There's one other piece of sculpture—
perhaps the finest on campus—that may or
may not havea plaque. I don't know—l didn't
have time to run up to the Dish and check.

What are those funny white boxes that
hang on the walls of Bishop Auditorium? I
thought they might be smoke detectors, but
why do the little red lights blink off and on
periodically? And why is the symmetrical pat
tern incomplete?
Bored in Bishop
Maybe vou wouldn't be so bored if you
knew that those funny white boxes were
bombardingvou with ultrasonic waves, sens
ing your presence and setting in motion
sophisticated electronic systems.
That is, they turn the lights on and off.
Using a technology developed in the security
industry (a friend of mine has a funny white
box in his house that blinks when you enter
his hall—it's the same thing on a smaller
scale), the "occupancy sensors" send out
signals that detect motion in the room. If the
lights are on, and the sensors don't detect
any motion after a certain period of time, the
lights will automatically switch off. When the
sensors detect motion again, the lights will
come on. Automatically. The sensors are
sensitive—they will turn the lights on even if
only one person enters the room.
The system has "manual override" capabil
ity: it only operates when the regular wall
switch is "on." If you switch the lights off
manually when you leave, they will not come
on again automatically.
According to Peter Skinner of the Energy
Program Office, the Bishop sensors are part
of a test program in energy conservation that
began with the installation of white boxes in
some of the Meyer Library classrooms last
May. There are now about 14 classrooms
around campus that have occupancy sen
sors, including three at the GSB. Bishop is the
only auditorium so equipped. According to
Skinner, the University is also looking into
other sensors, both ultrasonic and infrared.
