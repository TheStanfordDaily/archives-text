# H & S dept. secretaries overburdened
## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS 
As the only staff member for the seven
member Slavic department, Anisa Kurbanali is
the undergraduate secretary, graduate secre
tary, supplies controller and administrator
wrapped into one.
In fulfilling the requirements of these tasks,
Kurbanali's duties range from allocating office
supplies and equipment to coordinating
graduate admissions to working on the time
schedule for Slavic courses. In addition, Kur
banali has helped to start a Russian club at
Stanford.
Among the departments in the School of
Humanitiesand Sciences, Kurbanali's plight is
not unique. A surprising percentage of the
departments in the School of Humanities are
understaffed, their ratio of secretaries to fac
ulty members comparing unfavorably with
other departments and schools at Stanford
and not only burdening the secretaries but
also leaving the faculty, and the students,

without adequate support.
Outside the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, secretaries have a more reasonable
workload that enables them to serve faculty
members and student more effectively.
The statistics demonstrate drastic
differences in the ratio of faculty members to
staff throughout the campus:
• In the History Department, three sec
retaries serve 42 professors.
• In the Political Science Department, three
secretaries work for eight or nine professors
and one undergraduate secretary who works
for three faculty members.
• In the Classics Department, two sec
retaries serve 27 professors.
• The Geology Department in the School of
Earth Sciences has four secretaries to 28 fac
ulty members.
• The Graduate School of Business has 20
secretaries to 75 faculty members and lectur
ers.

•The Law School has 21 secretaries to 41
faculty members.
These discrepancies do not stem directly
from University policy. As many staff mem
bers have noted, the situation "has grown out
of history." Differences in staff support result
from the schools' varying abilities to attract
funds but also from a school's failure to assign
sufficient priority to secretarial services.
Whatever the origins, the problem still
exists. Seymour Martin Lipset, a professor of
sociology and a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, said the University does present
"an unusual situation" when "distinguished
scholars type their own books and manu
scripts" and when many "do their own corre
spondence." He said, "The University in a
sense is paying for secretarial support at a
higher rate."
Both the Political Science Department and
the History Department provide illuminating
examples of severe understaf
fing in the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
History Prof. Barton Berstein
remarked, "Walk in at any
three times during the day.
Vou will notice that the sec
retaries are never idle."
According to Barbara
Wawrzynski, the History De
partment administrator, the
department generates a huge
workload. "The three sec
retaries respond to the needs
of the moment rather than
working on long term proj
ects."
The Political Science De
partment also faces an insur
mountable workload that
never seems to be completed.
Administrator Arlee Ellis de
scribed the secretarial job as "a
constant steady pressure,
plowing through mountains of
paperwork." The faculty to
staff ratio in the Poli Sci De
partment is about 8 to 1. The
Political Science Department
employs five staff persons: a
graduate secretary, an under
graduate secretary who also
works for three faculty mem
bers and three other staff mem
bers who each work for eight or
nine faculty members.
Other departments in the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences reflect the problems of
History and Political Science.
The Slavic Department, in
which Kurbanali works, con
sists of seven faculty members,
along with several lecturers
and teaching assistants. Ac
cording to Kurbanali, the
meager ration of one stait per
son to seven faculty members
did not always exist. In 1976,
the Slavic Department had five

work study students and an
additional half time secretary.
But Kurbanali said, "The Of
fice of Humanities and Sci
ences wanted to cut back on
secretaries in this depart
ment." Today Kurbanali works
without the half-time secretary
and with only one work-study
student. "The professors
help," she said. "If they have to
do something like xeroxing,
they do it themselves." Al
though she channels a great
deal of time and energy into
the Slavic Department, she
said, "I love this office. I just
feel that I was born into it."
The Anthropology Depart
ment utilizes three secretaries
and one administrator for 27
faculty members, the 19 mem
bers in the Classics Depatment
rely on two staff people and
the French and Italian Depart
ment has two staff members
for 13 faculty members and 11
lecturers.
The low level of secretarial
support results in not only a
tremendous workload on the
secretaries, but also in severe
inconveniences and burdens
on the faculty.
Harry Harding, a professor
of political science, must han
dle all of his correspondence,
type all of his manuscripts, re
trieve all necessary materials
from the library and make all of
his travel arrangements. Even
the small duty of answering the
telephone becomes a hassle
for a faculty member who must
leave his office to teach classes
or to obtain research materials.
Harding, who had realized that
he was missing many .mpor
tant telephone calls, finally
bought an answering machine
at his own expense.

"The University has one of
the most antiquated telephone
systems, and it's a disgrace for
a University that prides itself
on advanced technology,"
Harding said. "If I'm not in my
office, and someone is trying
to call me, no one answers the
phone. I cannot think of any
comparable institution, busi
ness or government that
would allow that to happen."
The lack of secretarial sup
port imposes the greatest bur
den on faculty research. Al
though Harding describes re
search as "the most important
function of the faculty," the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences advocates a different
policy.
Sydney Burkhart, an assis
tant dean at H&S, stressed,
"Staff are provided for ad
ministrative and support needs
for teaching programs. We do
not provide services for their
scholarly works, such as re
search and writing."
The secretaries in thevarious
departments echo the impor
tance of course work, agreeing
that course work comes first.
Wawrzynski, of the History
Department, remarked that
"Student-related activities,
such as classroom materials,
time schedules, courses and
degrees, and student ques
tions, are first priority."
Ellis, of Poli Sci, refers to
manuscript typing as "having a
piece of knitting to pick up oc
casionally." Although impor
tant, manuscripts receive at
tention only when a lull in
coursework occurs.
University policy thus em
bodies a frustrating contradic
tion: professors must re
search, yet some receive little if

any secretarial support for
their activities.
Receiving little help from the
University, professors often
must seek their own solutions.
Bernstein occasionally hires an
outside typist, a task which not
only proposes an inconveni
ence but also must be funded
through his travel money.
"It makes )ou tired," he
said. "It's just one more diffi
culty."
Harding finallv used $600 of
his own mone\ to buy his own
microcomputer, an instrument
that he uses for the mainte
nance of his research files, his
correspondence and for the
storageof his writings. Harding
envisioned no alternative in a
University that "assigns the
lowest priority to the typing of
research manuscripts."
The lack of secretarial sup
port also affects students.
"There are severe time
pressures when many student
recommendations are due,"
Ellis said. "Faculty and staff try
very hard to meet the dead
lines, and sometimes that's
hard."
A faculty member who de
votes time to typing corre
spondence and manuscripts
may not have sufficient time to
spend with students in confer
ence or to publish lectures
notes. Harding remarked, "I
don't have enough time to do
all things that I both want to do
and think I shouid, that is de
veltping courses or revising
courses that I've taught be
fore."
Other schools
Outside of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, sec
retaries have a more reason
able workload that enables
them to serve faculty members
more effectively.
The Business School utilizes
20 full-time secretaries for 75
faculty members and lecturers.
Paul Johnson, the assistant
dean for administration, re
marks that "our deans are ab
solutely commited to faculty
research and course develop
ment."
The Law School, according
to the Registrar's office, has 20
faculty secretaries for4l faculty
members. Secretarial duties
include working on course ma
terials and correspondence,
answering telephones, and
typing manuscripts.
Funding
While the statistics demon
strate drastic differences in the
ratio of faculty members to
staff throughout the campus, a
great deal of these inequities
occur because some depart
ments and schools attract
grants and contracts more ef
fectively. Usually when a pro
fessor obtains an outside grant
or contract, he funds at least a
part time secretary to help with
the workload.
According to Associate Con
troller Frank Riddle, last year
the H&S obtained enough
grants to spend about $250,000
on secretaries, while the Medi
cal School spent $1.5 million
and the School of Engineering
utilized almost $700,000 of its
funds for secretarial help.
Even within the School of
Humanities and Sciences, the
presence of grants can cause
great inequities. The Psychol
ogy Department has 30 faculty
members to 14 secretaries, a
far more reasonable amount of
support than other H&S de
partments, but about 12 of the
secretaries receive their
salaries through professors'
grants, not through University
funding.
Grants, however, do not
completely solve the problem

of understaffing in a depart
ment. In the Biological Sci
ences Department of
Humanities and Sciences —
which funds some of their sec
retaries through grants — eight
secretaries work for 29 faculty
members. As department
chairman Philip Hanawalt ox
plained, two of the faculty
members have their own sec
retaries, while one secretary
supports eight faculty mem
bers.
"She's very good, but she's
overworked," Hanawalt said.
Not only failing to solve the
problem of inequities between
each faculty member's sup
port, grants also do not always
explain the presence of in
equities between the various
schools.
Last year the Law School did
not fund a single secretary
through grant or contract
money, and the School ot
Business spent only about
$5000. The professional
schools are more nearly self
supporting and can afford to
obtain more secretarial assist
ance. Neither school suffers
from a shortage of secretaries.
Solutions
The professional schools
that possess adequate secretar
ial services can afford to oper
ate more efficiently. In the
Graduate School of Business,
Katherine Bostick, faculty ser
vices officer, coordinates the
secretarial support with the
needs of the faculty members.
When Bostick looks for an
additional secretary, she ascer
tains how the faculty perceive
their needs and attempts to
hire accordingly. If a large re
search project comes up, the
faculty have Bostick arrange for
an outside typist so as not to
interrupt the flow of daily
work.
Bostick said, "Part of it is
trying to be as creative as you
can with the limited re -
sources."
Some departments, how
ever, cannot search for inven
tive methods to maximize effi
ciency because they lack the
most basi( resource, an
adequate number of sec
retaries.

As Lipset said, "There should
be more money in the secretar
ial supports," tor those de
partments that lack research
funds or those that attract
enough research money only
to grant a percentage of the
faculty with a sufficient
number of secretaries. With
out enough staff to handle the
volume of work, neither sec
retaries nor faculty can operate
at maximum potential
Currently, the understaffed
departments in the School of
Humanities and Sciences may
chose from three solutions to
solve the problem. Grants pro
vide the first option, but they
do not uniformly distribute
staff support over a depart
ment.
In addition, the costs of ob
taining a grant purely for secre
tarial help may not pay off.
Harding noted that the time
that you save by getting a sec
ic is eaic-n up Dy ihe pro
cess of applying, accounting
for, administering the grant
and its associated activities." In
order to hire a secretary at
about $18,000 a year, Harding
pointed out that he must re
ceive a grant three times that
amount, since "the University
takes about two-thirds of
whatever you raise right off the
top as their overhead."
The second option open to
understaffed departments is
petitioning the Dean's office
for more secretaries, a method
that faculty and staff believe to
have varying degrees of suc
cess.
Wray Wolfe, administrator
of biological sciences, views
petitioning as a possibility.
"Due to our growth in biologi
cal sciences, we would antici
pate additional secretarial help
in the future," she said.
Bernstein, however, con
tended, "They would not be
sympathetic if I did complain."
lean Mahoney also consid
ers petitioning to be a futile
device. Mahoney. the adminis
trator of Asian languages, sup
ports five piofessors and three
associate professors, with only
one half time secretary to aid
her.
"I have been in the same job

for 15 years," she said. "Every
year the workload gets more
demanding. My respon
sibilities increase every year."
Despite the expanding depart
ment, Mahoney asserts that
"they have yet to hear my
cries." She no longer bothers
to petition because she is too
busy keeping up with the work
load."
Burkhart, associate dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, noted that the school
works on a limited budget. She
believes that "most of the
humanities are fairly balanced;
the staff are fairly similar." Any
attempts at reform presents a
zero-sum game, according to
Burkhart. If the Office of H&S
were to grant an additional sec
retary to one office, they must
remove the funding for a secre
tary in another office.
The final solution open to
some understaffed depart
ments is TIRO, a program that
provides word processors to
humanists to aid them with
their research. The program
was made possible by a large
outside foundation. The fac
ulty believe that the program
has been useful. All but five
members of the History De
partment accepted a word pro
cessor and utilize it effectively.
TIRO does not include the
social scientists. Harding de
scribes the social scientists as
the middle class of the Univer
sity. He said, "We have enough
access, supposedly, to outside
funding that we should be able
to be like the natural sciences
and engineering. We don't de
serve to be subsidized; there
fore, we are right in the mid
dle."
To fulfill the needs of faculty
members, the School of
Humanities and Sciences sim
ply must assign a higher prior
ity to secretarial services, ac
cording to Harding.
Until this happens, the
cooperative relationships be
tween faculty and staff must
continue to suftice in the face
of work pressures and lack of
time. Bernstein said, "If the
secretaries were less agreeable
personally, it would be even
more of a crisis."


Mark Davidian/Daily
THE ONE: Ideally, each department in the University would have several secretaries, but this ideal
doesn't always exist, especially in the School of Humanities and Sciences. In the Slavic Studies
Department, Anisa Kurbanali (above) must be undergraduate secretary, graduate secretary,
administrator and personal secretary to seven faculty members, a faculty/secretary ratio of seven
to one. In other departments, this ratio is as low as two to one.
