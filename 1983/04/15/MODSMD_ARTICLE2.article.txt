# H & S dept. secretaries overburdened

### NANCY WILLIAMS 
As the only staff member for the seven
member Slavic department, Anisa Kurbanali is
the undergraduate secretary, graduate secre
tary, supplies controller and administrator
wrapped into one.
In fulfilling the requirements of these tasks,
Kurbanali's duties range from allocating office
supplies and equipment to coordinating
graduate admissions to working on the time
schedule for Slavic courses. In addition, Kur
banali has helped to start a Russian club at
Stanford.
Among the departments in the School of
Humanitiesand Sciences, Kurbanali's plight is
not unique. A surprising percentage of the
departments in the School of Humanities are
understaffed, their ratio of secretaries to fac
ulty members comparing unfavorably with
other departments and schools at Stanford
and not only burdening the secretaries but
also leaving the faculty, and the students,

without adequate support.
Outside the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, secretaries have a more reasonable
workload that enables them to serve faculty
members and student more effectively.
The statistics demonstrate drastic
differences in the ratio of faculty members to
staff throughout the campus:
• In the History Department, three sec
retaries serve 42 professors.
• In the Political Science Department, three
secretaries work for eight or nine professors
and one undergraduate secretary who works
for three faculty members.
• In the Classics Department, two sec
retaries serve 27 professors.
• The Geology Department in the School of
Earth Sciences has four secretaries to 28 fac
ulty members.
• The Graduate School of Business has 20
secretaries to 75 faculty members and lectur
ers.

•The Law School has 21 secretaries to 41
faculty members.
These discrepancies do not stem directly
from University policy. As many staff mem
bers have noted, the situation "has grown out
of history." Differences in staff support result
from the schools' varying abilities to attract
funds but also from a school's failure to assign
sufficient priority to secretarial services.
Whatever the origins, the problem still
exists. Seymour Martin Lipset, a professor of
sociology and a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, said the University does present
"an unusual situation" when "distinguished
scholars type their own books and manu
scripts" and when many "do their own corre
spondence." He said, "The University in a
sense is paying for secretarial support at a
higher rate."
Both the Political Science Department and
the History Department provide illuminating
