## Federal and state rulings may help fill Mono Lake 
### JENNIFER KREGER 
Decisions made by the
California State Senate, the
U.S. House of Representatives
and a federal district court
judge in the near future will
collectively determine the fu
ture of Mono Lake, one of the
oldest and most unusual lakes
on the planet.
Mono Lake, an "inland sea"
south of Lake Tahoe, has de
pended since the Ice Ages on
streams carrying snowmelt
down the eastern slope of the
Sierra. Over thousands of
years the trace amounts of salts
and minerals washed down
from the mountains have col
lected in the Mono Basin to
make this lake, which has no
outlet save evaporation, three
times as much saline and 80
times more alkaline than sea
water. The results have been
the strange landscape of "tufa
towers" or calcified springs,
and a very simple ecosystem of
algae, brine shrimp and brine
flies that nourish 79 species of
water birds.
In 1941, however, the major
streams feeding Mono Lake
were diverted south, joining
Owens Lake water along the
way, through an aquaduct built
by the Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power (DWP),
which owns the land adjacent
to the streams. As fresh water
evaporates, the water level of
this shallow lake drops, islands
become peninsulas and ex
panses of alkaline lakebottom
are exposed and dry into dust.

Meanwhile, southern Califor
nia homes, farms and industry
are provided with clear, inex
pensive water which has gen
erated $15 million per year of
hydroelectricityon its downhill
journey south. Replacement of
Mono water by purchases from
the Colorado River or from
state water projects would cost
$17 million per year in addition
to the electricity cost, for a total
of $10 per year per consumer,
according to Bruce Kuebler,
senior Water Works engineer
and water rights spokesman
for the DWP.
The State Senate will soon
decide whether to make water
projects exempt from the
California Health and Safety
Code air quality standards. SB
270, a bill introduced by six
southern California senators
has just passed the Committee
on Government Organization
to be considered by the Sen
ate. Without the passage of SB
270, the DWP will have diffi
culty obtaining permission
from the Great Basin Unified
Air Pollution Control District to
build its proposed geothermal
wells, since the dust blown
thousands of feet into the air
from Mono shores and from
the now dry Owens lakebed
has violated both state and
federal ambient air quality
standards.
According to the DWP,
which has offered means other
than the permit for dealing
with the dust problem, such
violations have been rare and

not threatening to human
health. "I think that concern
over Mono dust is an emo
tional reaction," Knebler said.
"The studies of the dangers of
particulates have focused on
smog that is combustion re
lated and that is much more
acidic than the Mono shores.
Secondly, the storms happen
very infrequently up there.
We've taken photographs
every day since February 1980,
and on only 11 or so days has
the airborne dust been consid
ered extensive. Thirdly, the
winds there blow only away
from town, toward the desert
on the east. Only four or five
families live downwind, and no
one has ever sought any medi
cal attention. Perhaps if you
breathed the dust every day for
hours some would irritate your
lungs, but nobody does."
David Takemoto-Wertz, the
Mono Lake Committee's
(MLC) Legislative Representa
tive in Sacramento, expressed
more concern. "It is such fine
dust and so jagged that its par
ticles can reach the innermost
recesses of the lungs and be a
harsh irritant. . . Mono dust is
worse than Owens dust be
cause of the volcanic combus
tion in its history. And even
Owens dust which billows out
of its valley harms the trees in
Inyo County." The small
number of people now breath
ing the dust does not reassure
those who are working to de
feat SB 270, who fear that as
Mono Lake shrinks further,

more dust will enter the air,
endangering not only area res
idents but the many visitors
and the clear views in nearby
Vosemite.
Steve Catton, information
specialist for the MLC pointed
out that "There are increasing
numbers of pec.ple coming to
enjoy the vistas and an increas
ing amount of alkaline smog.
The March 31 windstorm was
so bad at Owens that Highway
395 had to be closed after a
nine-car pileup."
The storm occurred just as
DWP members were showing
Senate aides around Owens
valley to convince them of the
air's purity; and despite the
DWP's insistence that that
day's dust arose from a newly
plowed field rather than from
the lakebed, Mono Lake sup
porters found it a whimsical
coincidence. To Dan Taylor of
the National Audubon Society
it was reminiscent of well
timed Biblical miracles like the
opening of the Red Sea.
The federal bill, HR 1341, in
troduced by Rep. Richard
Lehman (D-Calif.), would es
tablish Mono Lake as a Na
tional Monument, provide sci
entific monitoring of biological
resources, and study alterna
tive water management
policies that would conserve
water and reduce the need for
diversions. Though HR 1341
would not in itself force
Los Angeles to stop its use of
Mono water, it would put
pressure on the DWP to divert

less water.
Obviously they don't want to
he in the position of destroying
a National Monument," Catton
said. He said that HR 1341
might actually he favorable to
DWP because a federal study
would increase the DWP's
chances of being compensated
financially for any cutbacks in
diversions.
Both the air quality bill and
the National Monument pro
posal are likely to affect or to
be affected by the decision
forthcoming from U.S. Federal
District Court Judge Larry
Carlton in Sacramento. In 1979,
several environmental groups
filed a lawsuit against the DWP
alleging that the unrestricted
diversions of Mono Lake's
tributary streams violates the
public trust, a doctrine protect
ing the rights of all citizens to
enjoy their natural environ
ment. The needs of the five
species of birds which might
die with the lake, as well as
questions of pollution, recrea
tion and scientific research at
the Lake and the problems of
California water policy in gen
eral, must all'be taken into
consideration along with the
need of Los Angeles.
Taylor said the DWP and other
large utilities take for granted
the increasing need for water
and look for the best way to
meet that demand. "People all
over the state depend on water,
and if they can't use water from
Mono Lake they can get it from a

more expensive project," Kue
bler said. "We're only using
one-half of what's available â€”the
rest is still flowing into the
ocean."
On the other hand, en
vironmental groups prefer
policies of increased efficiency
of water use to those encourag
ing the destruction of one
body of water after another.
Taylor said he doubted that

California would ever have be
come a place to grow cotton if
water were not so heavily sub
sidized. Catton agreed that all
Californians are very profligate
in their water use, so that
"eventually we must face the
fact that we have run out of
convenient sources of new wa
ter; the only source left that
doesn't involve the sacrifice of
an important ecosystem is con
servation. . .

TUFA TOWERS: In 1940 all of Mono Lake's calcium carbo
nate towers, formed owver thousands of years, were under
water. However, since the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power has been diverting water from flowing to the lake,
the water level has dropped substantially, exposing the tow
ers.
