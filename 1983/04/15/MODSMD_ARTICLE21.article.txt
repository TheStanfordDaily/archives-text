# Lovins' speak on soft energy path
## 
### FAY DUFFNER 
Amory and Hunter Lovins, staunch
proponents of the "soft energy path,"
spoke here last week as part of a under
graduate special course entitled "The
Energy Controversy." The "hard" and
"soft" energy paths are textural terms
coined by Amory Lovins which describe
their flexibility, resilience, sustainabil
ity and benignity. The distinction be
tween the soft and hard energy paths
rests, according to the Lovins' , "not
on how much energy is used, but on
the technical and sociopolitical stric
ture of the energy system."
According to the Lovins', the soft
path requires the use of several diffuse
and fairly decentralized renewable en
ergy sources and their related
technologies (solar, wind, hydroelec
tric, and biomass energy production).
The hard path prescribes a continued
reliance on a few centralized high
technologies (coal, oil, natural gas and
nuclear energy production).
In their first lecture, the Lovinses
stressed that the most important aspect
of the soft path is energy conservation
with technical fixes. They claim that we
can reduce our growth in energy con
sumption without changes in lifestyle,
pointingout that the last few years have
shown no correlation between energy
consumption and growth in GNP.
Amory Lovins presented chart after
chart of long and short term costs of
various conservation technologies
from economically and energy efficient
refrigerators to efficient cars, light
bulbs, and appliances. He said, "We
have already seen 100 times as much
from savings (of energy) as from expan
sion in our energy output in the last few
years."
In the second lecture, the Lovins'
reinforced their arguments for the soft
path with the results of a study they did
for the Pentagon. They presented the
problem of the vulnerability of central
ized hard path energy systems with
several plausible and actual cases of
terrorism and accidents, as outlined in
their book, Brittle Power. Ninety per
cent of our energy system is susceptible
to terrorism. . . we have reached the
point where a handful of people in a
single night could stop for a year more
than three-quarters of the natural gas

supplies to the Eastern U.S. — without
ever leaving Louisiana," said Amory Lo
vins.
Their solution to the current central
ized and "brittle" energy system is a
more resilient soft path energy system.
These resilient soft path strategies
stress energy conservation through
technical fixes and the matching of en
ergy quality, scale and geographic dis
tribution to their "end use" needs.
The Lovins' emphasize the end use of
energy resources because "There is no
demand for raw kilowatts, only for
lighting, transportation, etc," Hunter
Lovins said. There are several ways to
get the best energy for one's dollar by

matching the scale of energy produc
tion and the quality of energy of energy
used to the specific end use activity for
which it is to be used. For example, the
Lovins' do not support the hard path
expansion of electrical utilities for low
temperature heating and cooling be
cause many of these energy needs can
be more efficiently and inexpensively
met by other energy forms. Active and
passive solar systems, wood or
kerosene combustion or wea
therstripping and insulation could
more efficiently heat dwelling.
The Lovins' also oppose electrical
power production using the hard path
for the following reasons:
1) Electrical generation is inefficient.
For every three units of fuel put into the
process, two come off as waste heat
and only one is delivered as usable en
ergy.
2) The immense, decentralized elec
trical grid makes our energy system
"brittle" and vulnerable to uncon
trolled tampering and attack.

3) Increased fossil fuel burning for
electricity production increases the re
lease of carbon dioxide into the atmos
phere, possibly leading to a worldwide
atmospheric warming known as the
"Greenhouse Effect".
When asked what they would like to
see as the future energy scenario, the
Lovins' advocated a simple working of
the free market in which the soft path,
by means of being economically more
disirable with less consequent en
vironmental and political repercus
sions, would implement itself. But they
said that a free energy market is not a
plausable possibility at this time, so
they have come to base some of their
arguments on other associated issues
such as the security problem of central
ized hard path energy systems.
The greatest barrier to implementing
the soft path right now is economical
and ultimately institutional in nature
because of huge subsidies on hard path
energy such as nuclear power, the Lo
vins' said. They emphasized that this
barrier could be lifted if all energy strat
egies were desubsidized and if public
energy information programs were put
back into effect. They do foresee, how
ever, a slow takeover of the soft path
technologies, which they claim are not
only cheaper but also more job inten
sive, over the next 10 to 40 years.
According to the Lovins', Swedish
and West German energy conservation
measures and those of other highly de
veloped countries have been very suc
cessful compared with the relatively
slow U.S. conservation movement.
They warn that other countries, such as
Japan, are moving far faster than the
U.S. in soft energy technology devel
opment, particularly photovoltaics,
and that we may see foreign competi
tion in those markets similar to the
competition created by the importation
of foreign automobiles.
The Lovins' plan to move further with
their work onto a "soft water path."
They are interested in looking at many
of the intricate policy issues relating
water, energy, land and money "be
cause we think water will be a bigger
problem in the next century than en
ergy was for the last one,'' Amory Lo
vins said.

"brittle" and vulnerable to uncon
trolled tampering and attack.

3) Increased fossil fuel burning for
electricity production increases the re
lease of carbon dioxide into the atmos

atmospheric warming known as the
"Greenhouse Effect".
When asked what they would like to
see as the future energy scenario, the
Lovins' advocated a simple working of
the free market in which the soft path,
by means of being economically more
disirable with less consequent en
vironmental and political repercus
sions, would implement itself. But they
said that a free energy market is not a
plausable possibility at this time, so
they have come to base some of their
arguments on other associated issues
such as the security problem of central
ized hard path energy systems.
The greatest barrier to implementing
the soft path right now is economical
and ultimately institutional in nature
because of huge subsidies on hard path
energy such as nuclear power, the Lo
vins' said. They emphasized that this
barrier could be lifted if all energy strat
egies were desubsidized and if public
energy information programs were put
back into effect. They do foresee, how
ever, a slow takeover of the soft path
technologies, which they claim are not
only cheaper but also more job inten
sive, over the next 10 to 40 years.
According to the Lovins', Swedish
and West German energy conservation
measures and those of other highly de
veloped countries have been very suc
cessful compared with the relatively
slow U.S. conservation movement.
They warn that other countries, such as
Japan, are moving far faster than the
U.S. in soft energy technology devel
opment, particularly photovoltaics,
and that we may see foreign competi
tion in those markets similar to the
competition created by the importation
of foreign automobiles.
The Lovins' plan to move further with
their work onto a "soft water path."
They are interested in looking at many
of the intricate policy issues relating
water, energy, land and money "be
cause we think water will be a bigger
problem in the next century than en
ergy was for the last one,'' Amory Lo
vins said.

Amory and Hunter Lovins, staunch
proponents of the "soft energy path,"
spoke here last week as part of a under
graduate special course entitled "The
Energy Controversy." The "hard" and
"soft" energy paths are textural terms
coined by Amory Lovins which describe
their flexibility, resilience, sustainabil
ity and benignity. The distinction be
tween the soft and hard energy paths
rests, according to the Lovins' , "not
on how much energy is used, but on
the technical and sociopolitical stric
ture of the energy system."
According to the Lovins', the soft
path requires the use of several diffuse
and fairly decentralized renewable en
ergy sources and their related
technologies (solar, wind, hydroelec
tric, and biomass energy production).
The hard path prescribes a continued
reliance on a few centralized high
technologies (coal, oil, natural gas and
nuclear energy production).
In their first lecture, the Lovinses
stressed that the most important aspect
of the soft path is energy conservation
with technical fixes. They claim that we
can reduce our growth in energy con
sumption without changes in lifestyle,
pointingout that the last few years have
shown no correlation between energy
consumption and growth in GNP.
Amory Lovins presented chart after
chart of long and short term costs of
various conservation technologies
from economically and energy efficient
refrigerators to efficient cars, light
bulbs, and appliances. He said, "We
have already seen 100 times as much
from savings (of energy) as from expan
sion in our energy output in the last few
years."
In the second lecture, the Lovins'
reinforced their arguments for the soft
path with the results of a study they did
for the Pentagon. They presented the
problem of the vulnerability of central
ized hard path energy systems with
several plausible and actual cases of
terrorism and accidents, as outlined in
their book, Brittle Power. Ninety per
cent of our energy system is susceptible
to terrorism. . . we have reached the
point where a handful of people in a
single night could stop for a year more
than three-quarters of the natural gas

supplies to the Eastern U.S. — without
ever leaving Louisiana," said Amory Lo
vins.
Their solution to the current central
ized and "brittle" energy system is a
more resilient soft path energy system.
These resilient soft path strategies
stress energy conservation through
technical fixes and the matching of en
ergy quality, scale and geographic dis
tribution to their "end use" needs.
The Lovins' emphasize the end use of
energy resources because "There is no
demand for raw kilowatts, only for
lighting, transportation, etc," Hunter
Lovins said. There are several ways to
get the best energy for one's dollar by

matching the scale of energy produc
tion and the quality of energy of energy
used to the specific end use activity for
which it is to be used. For example, the
Lovins' do not support the hard path
expansion of electrical utilities for low
temperature heating and cooling be
cause many of these energy needs can
be more efficiently and inexpensively
met by other energy forms. Active and
passive solar systems, wood or
kerosene combustion or wea
therstripping and insulation could
more efficiently heat dwelling.
The Lovins' also oppose electrical
power production using the hard path
for the following reasons:
1) Electrical generation is inefficient.
For every three units of fuel put into the
process, two come off as waste heat
and only one is delivered as usable en
ergy.
2) The immense, decentralized elec
trical grid makes our energy system
"brittle" and vulnerable to uncon
trolled tampering and attack.

3) Increased fossil fuel burning for
electricity production increases the re
lease of carbon dioxide into the atmos
phere, possibly leading to a worldwide
atmospheric warming known as the
"Greenhouse Effect".
