# The
						EPA dispute in retrospect

### MARY RUCKELSHAUS 
The Environmental Protection Agency has re
cently been through the unsettling process of
being turned inside out, upside down and then
shaken to make sure every last bit was exposed.
The events leading to former EPA administrator
Anne Burford's resignation have a history that
may have begun as early as the day President
Reagan took office. Reagan's choices for agency
heads, and the subsequent build-up of
tension between the executive and legislative
branches in Washington, are two major underly
ing causes of the controversy surrounding Bur
ford and the EPA, according to many Capitol Hill
observers.
In the more recent past, the conflict climaxed
with the following events:
• Fall 1982. House subcommittees began in
vestigating the EPA management of "Super
fund" including the agency's ability to clean up
hazardous wastes and to prosecute violators.
Superfund is the term used to describe the $1.6
billion designated in the Carter administration,
to be used as an emergency clean-up fund for
hazardous waste disposal sites. The EPA was
given the responsibility of determining which
sites were "emergency"sites, and also in charge
of overseeing the clean up process.
• Nov. 22, 1982. House Public Works and
Transportation subcommittee subpoenaed
documents from the EPA in response to their
inquiry. Later, inquiries were begun by four
other House subcommittees and by the Senate
Committee on Environmental and Public
Works. Burford, (acting in accordance with
Reagan's request) refused to yield the docu
ments.
• Dec. 16, 1982. The House charged Burford
with contempt of Congress. Later, investiga
tions by congressional panels turned up a con
flict of interest issue with Rita Lavelle, assistant
administrator for solid waste and emergency re
sponse.
• Feb. 7, 1983. Reagan dismissed Lavelle and
allowed documents to be released. The con
tempt charge against Burford was withdrawn.
Susequent probes yielded four main problem
areas:
1. Alleged political manipulation of agency's
toxic waste clean up program.
2. Possible conflicts of interest and perjury
involving top former and current officials of the
agency.
3. Political "hit lists" and surveillance of
agency employees.
4. Possible favoritism toward toxic waste
dumpers and other industrial polluters.
• March 9,1983. As the accusations stacked up
against Burford, she resigned.

According to several environmental group
spokespeople, Reagan had abandoned any
serious goals for environmental protection and
preservation by appointing two conservatives
with "bad" environmental records to crucial
administrative posts. (James Watt and Burford to
the Department of the Interior and to the EPA,
respectively). Thus, her resignation was viewed
as a small victory in the battle for recognition of
environmental concerns.
Reagan took several important steps in an at
tempt to stop the criticisms of his environmental
policies, which were revealed in a recent Harris
poll which said that 74 percent of Americans
disapprove of Reagan's handling of cleaning up
the environment. He allowed the subpoenaed
documents to be released to Congress, ac
cepted Burford's resignation and appointed Wil
liam Ruckelshaus to be the new EPA adminis
trator. Ruckelshaus, the EPA's first adminis
trator, has a reputation for being tough yet fair
on environmental issues. Reagan also said that
he is giving Ruckelshaus greater leeway and au
tonomy in making decisions and taking actions
to revitalize the EPA's reputation and effective
ness.
Reagan's actions were viewed by some to be a
compromise in his idealogies concerning en
vironmental policies, while others said that his
policies have not changed. Elizabeth Davenport
of Environmental Action Inc, a Washington
based lobbying group, said that Reagan's recent
actions have been "a reaction to a political is
sue," and that "belatedly Reagan has recog
nized that this is the great political albatross."
Dan Cannon of the National Association of
Manufacturers, on the other hand, sees no par
ticular significance in Reagan's recent actions
concerning the EPA. According to Cannon, the
new developments at the EPA "do not necessar
ily mean that Reagan has come out and an
nounced that he is changing the administra
tions' policies" concerning environmental is
sues.
There is, however, almost unanimous agree
ment among interest groups on both sides of
the environmental fence that the EPA needs
help. Davenport explained that the "integrity of
the EPA has, in the last few years, been badly
damaged. . . It has been crippled by budget cuts
and "bad people at the helm.'' These combined
factors has made implementations of its laws
and regulations inefficient and "just plain bad,"
according to an EPA staff member. He said that
there is now a disillusioned, tired staff at the
EPA, and hopes the newly appointed adminis
trator will administer a booster shot to the
agency.
