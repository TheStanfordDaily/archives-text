### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
The Stanford Cardinal finds itself in a
position it worked hard to avoid as it opens
a five-game series against UCLA today at
noon.
The Cardinal, ranked seventh nationally
is narrowly leading the 6-Pac Con
ference by only one-halt game after own
ing a barely-challengeable margin | list one
week ago.
Last weekend, the last-place California
Bears took two-of-three games from Stan
ford while USC was sweeping UCLA to
sneak back onto the Cardinal s heels.
There are bright spots for Stanford
though. Today s contest at noon opens
with the Cardinal leading 7-1 in the bottom
of the sixth inning and the Bruins at bat.
The game was started in Los Angeles
earlier this season but threatening skies
warranted that the teams agree to suspend
the game at a certain point should rain
come. Monday's 2:30 p.m. game will also
be a make-up with UCLA playing host at

Sunken Diamond.

today after completion of the suspended
game and continues Saturday and Sunday
at 1 p.m.

Hardgrave leads the Stanford offense in all
three triple crown jewels. He has a .386
