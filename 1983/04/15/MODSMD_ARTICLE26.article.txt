# Big weekend in store for Card tennis teams
## Men's match with UCLA to be finished in Maples 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
Facing its toughest challenge
of the season, the Stanford
men's tennis team hosts
fourth-ranked USC and fifth
ranked UCLA this weekend in
matches that will determine
whether the team has a rea
sonable shot at winning the na
tional championship.
Two injured Cardinals, No. 1
Scott Davis — who has been
suffering from mononucleosis
— and No. 3 Dan Goldie —
who has struggled with a sore
arm — will both be playing
singles and doubles, although
neither will be at full strength.
Coach Dick Could, whose
sixth-ranked team has won 13
consecutive matches, includ
ing five wins over top 20 teams,
said this weekend "will be an
indicator of how good we re
ally are."
junior Mark McKeen, the
team captain, said the team
was "really excited about this

weekend. It'll be a telltale sign
of how we'll do in the NCAAs
(team championships)."
Gould said the weekend's
matches should be kept in per
spective because the NCAA
Championships are a month
away and that during that
month the team would have
several matches against col
leges in the top five. "It's just
one of the steps along the
way," he said.
On both days the No. I sing
les slot promises a close
match-up. Today Davis goes up
against USC star and 14th
ranked Matt Anger and on
Saturday Davis faces UCLA's
Danny Salt/ inside Maples
Pavilion.
Saturday's match in Maples
Pavilion represents the 10th
year in a row that Stanford has
staged an inside match. Ac
cording to Gould, the 3000 to
6000 people the Maples event
traditionally attracts, usually
represents the biggest crowd
at any tennis collegiate match
all year, including the NCAAs.
Because Stanford lines up so
evenly with both teams in the
singles, Gould predicted that

whoever wins the match will
have to win two of the three
doubles contests.
Today's match begins at
noon on varsity courts and to
morrow's mate h, which will be
split between the varsity courts
and Maples, starts at noon at
the varsity courts and then
moves indoor-, at 6:30 p.m.
The tirst indoor match fea
tures Davis against Salt/, the
second includes the No 2
doubles team of Mc Keen and
Jim Grabb against UCLA's
probable team of John Davis
and Craig Venter.
The final and possibly decid
ing match of the evening fea
tures the No. 1 team of Davis
and freshmen John Letts — the
third-rated team in the nation
against the Bruin pair of
Mark Basham and Barry Buss.
Gould hopes the matches
will draw large student t rowds,
especially Saturday's indoor
portion of the UCLA contest at
which the Stanford Band will
play. "There is a tremendous
home court advantage in ten
nis. A large student turnout
might make a difference with
these players."
