# Women face No. 4 UCLA Sunday
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
A depleted Stanford
women's tennis team sur
vived a momentary scare
and recovered to defeat
UC-Santa Barbara 7-2 yes
terday at Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
The non-conference
match, which upped Stan
ford's overall record to 17-2,
was the Cardinal's final
tune-up before Sunday's
key WCAA match with
UCLA, scheduled to start at
noon at Stanford Stadium.
The Card is in second place
in the WCAA at 8-1.
In the most recent college
tennis polls, Stanford is
ranked second by the NCAA
and third bv thn ITCA (Inter
collegiate Coaches
Association. UCLA, IS-4
overall and 6-1 in th °
WCAA, is <"a Uv d fourth in
both polls.
The UCLA match takes on
such importance because
Stanford, who defeated the
Bruins 5-4 earlier this sea
son, will be guaranteed a
No. 2 or No. 3 seeding at
next month's NCAA Cham
pionships with a win Sun
day.
A No. 4 seed at Albuquer
que, N.M., the site of the
NCAAs, would mean having
to face No. 1 ranked USC in
the semi-finals, something
any team competing would
like to avoid at all costs.
But if Stanford should
lose Sunday, it would have
to beat the Bruins on their
home turf May 7.
"If we can beat them
here, it doesn't matter what

happens down there," said
Cardinal head coach Frank
Brennan.
Brennan's biggest con
cern at the present time,
however, is putting to
gether a healthy squad for
Sunday's match.
The Card's No. 1 singles
player Elise Burgin, also the
nation's top-ranked col
legiate netwoman, did not
play singles yesterday
against UCSB due to a knee
injury. Senior team captain
Caryn Copeland, ranked
37th nationally, has bron
chitis and did not play at all.
Brennan expects Burgin
to be ready for Sunday and
her match against UCLA's
Barbara Gerkin, but said
Copeland's status is still up
in the air.
Brennan is not looking
forward to the possibility of
not having Copeland ready
for Sunday. "She's been
playing the best singles of
her career and she's our
team captain," he said. "So
it would definitely hurt play
ing without her."
Without Burgin and
Copeland yesterday — the
No. 1 and No. 4 singles
players — Stanford strug
gled through the singles
and held a 3-2 advantage
over UCSB with only Alison
Hardey's No. 5 match re
maining.
Hardey had lost the first
set of her contest with
UCSB's Lynn Flachman 6-3,
but had prevailed in the
second, 7-5 and was ahead
3-2 in the third
The Card junior stormed

past Flachman in the next
three games, breaking her
serve once and increasing
Stanford's team lead to 4-2.
Hardey's three-set victory
provided the necessary
momentum as Stanford
swept the three doubles
contests with the Gauchos.
Burgin was mobile
enough to team with Linda
Gates in the doubles and re
cord a quick 6-0, 6-3 win to
nail down the match for
Stanford.
In the singles depart
ment, the Cardinal won the
top three matches, but had
problems at the bottom of
the ladder.
Gales beat lena Strozier
6-2, 7-5 at No 1. Alvce Wer
del defeated Molly Shea 6-2,
7-5 at No. ?. tnd Mi< helle
Weiss downed Andrea
Gonzales, the daughter of
tennis great Pancho Gon
zales, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
Stanford netters lost
matches at No. 4 and No. 6
singles, lackie Joseph falling
to Leslie Lipson 6-3, 2-6, 6-3
and Barb Baughman losing
to June Angus 7-6, 6-4.
In the doubles, Hardey
and loseph combined to
beat UCSB's team of Shea
and Gonzales at No. 2 while
Weiss/Werdel came back to
defeat Flac hman/Beth Rush
ing 4-6, 6-2, 6-4.
In the last meeting be
tween Stanford and UCLA,
the Cardinal prevailed
March 5 in a 5-4 thriller at
the National Indoor Cham
pionships in Ann Arbor,
Mich.

NCAAs, would mean having
to face No. 1 ranked USC in
the semi-finals, something
any team competing would
like to avoid at all costs.
But if Stanford should
lose Sunday, it would have
to beat the Bruins on their
home turf May 7.
"If we can beat them
here, it doesn't matter what

happens down there," said
Cardinal head coach Frank
Brennan.
Brennan's biggest con
cern at the present time,
however, is putting to
gether a healthy squad for
Sunday's match.
The Card's No. 1 singles
player Elise Burgin, also the
nation's top-ranked col
legiate netwoman, did not
play singles yesterday
against UCSB due to a knee
injury. Senior team captain
Caryn Copeland, ranked
37th nationally, has bron
chitis and did not play at all.
Brennan expects Burgin
to be ready for Sunday and
her match against UCLA's
Barbara Gerkin, but said
Copeland's status is still up
in the air.
Brennan is not looking
forward to the possibility of
not having Copeland ready
for Sunday. "She's been
playing the best singles of
her career and she's our
team captain," he said. "So
it would definitely hurt play
ing without her."
Without Burgin and
Copeland yesterday — the
No. 1 and No. 4 singles
players — Stanford strug
gled through the singles
and held a 3-2 advantage
over UCSB with only Alison
Hardey's No. 5 match re
maining.
Hardey had lost the first
set of her contest with
UCSB's Lynn Flachman 6-3,
but had prevailed in the
second, 7-5 and was ahead
3-2 in the third
The Card junior stormed

past Flachman in the next
three games, breaking her
serve once and increasing
Stanford's team lead to 4-2.
Hardey's three-set victory
provided the necessary
momentum as Stanford
swept the three doubles
contests with the Gauchos.
Burgin was mobile
enough to team with Linda
Gates in the doubles and re
cord a quick 6-0, 6-3 win to
nail down the match for
Stanford.
In the singles depart
ment, the Cardinal won the
top three matches, but had
problems at the bottom of
the ladder.
Gales beat lena Strozier
6-2, 7-5 at No 1. Alvce Wer
del defeated Molly Shea 6-2,
7-5 at No. ?. tnd Mi< helle
Weiss downed Andrea
Gonzales, the daughter of
tennis great Pancho Gon

matches at No. 4 and No. 6
singles, lackie Joseph falling
to Leslie Lipson 6-3, 2-6, 6-3
and Barb Baughman losing
to June Angus 7-6, 6-4.
In the doubles, Hardey
and loseph combined to
beat UCSB's team of Shea
and Gonzales at No. 2 while
Weiss/Werdel came back to
defeat Flac hman/Beth Rush
ing 4-6, 6-2, 6-4.
In the last meeting be
tween Stanford and UCLA,
the Cardinal prevailed
March 5 in a 5-4 thriller at
the National Indoor Cham
pionships in Ann Arbor,
Mich.

Junior Alison Hardy turned the match around for Stan
ford yesterday with her come-from-hehind 3-6, 7-5, 6-2
win over UCSB's Lynn Flachman. Stanford won the
match 7-2 and improved its overall record to 17-2 with a
key match against UCLA this weekend.
A depleted Stanford
women's tennis team sur
vived a momentary scare
and recovered to defeat
UC-Santa Barbara 7-2 yes
terday at Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
The non-conference
match, which upped Stan
ford's overall record to 17-2,
was the Cardinal's final
tune-up before Sunday's
key WCAA match with
UCLA, scheduled to start at
noon at Stanford Stadium.
The Card is in second place
in the WCAA at 8-1.
In the most recent college
tennis polls, Stanford is
ranked second by the NCAA
and third bv thn ITCA (Inter
collegiate Coaches
Association. UCLA, IS-4
overall and 6-1 in th °
WCAA, is <"a Uv d fourth in
both polls.
The UCLA match takes on
such importance because
Stanford, who defeated the
Bruins 5-4 earlier this sea
son, will be guaranteed a
No. 2 or No. 3 seeding at
next month's NCAA Cham
pionships with a win Sun
day.
A No. 4 seed at Albuquer
que, N.M., the site of the
NCAAs, would mean having
to face No. 1 ranked USC in
the semi-finals, something
any team competing would
like to avoid at all costs.
