NL umpires may boycott
National League umpires
could stage a one-day walkout next week to
press their union's demand that Com
missioner Bowie Kuhn suspend Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner, according to a
published report.
The action would take the form of a visit by
several umpires to Kuhn's New York office on
a day when they were scheduled to officiate
at ball games, the New York Times reported
in today's editions.
The source, described as being familiar
with discussions between the Major League
Umpires Association and the commissioner's
office, said the boycott would take place un
less Kuhn acted by the weekend.
Kuhn's office has said he is studying a de
mand by Richie Phillips, general counsel to
the union, that Steinbrenner be suspended
'or attacking the umpires' integrity. Phillips
•is cited remarks Steinbrenner made during
in exhibition game last month in which he
>aid, "The National League will always give
the close call to the National League."
Steinbrenner has said his comments were
made to a friend, were considered private
jnd not meant to be heard by reporters. The
Yankees owner made them as he stood be
hind a fence near first base during a March 25
game against the Montreal Expos soon after a
close call at first.

day.
The exact cause of the deflation is not yet
known.
The National Weather Service said 13.6 in
ches of new snow fell at Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport Thursday, with similar
amounts throughout the Twin Cities.
