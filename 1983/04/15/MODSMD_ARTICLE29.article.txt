# Spikers stopped by Santa Barbara

### MARK ZEIGLER 
Killing tvvi' giants in one
week proved too much for
David — Stanford's men's vol
leyball team — Wednesday
night at Maplo Pavilion.
After slaying one monster-
No. 1-ranked Hawaii — last
week, coach Fred Sturm and
his spikers could not do it
again, this time against fifth
ranked UC-Santa Barbara and
the Gaucho- consequently
crushed the Cardinal in three
straight garm'S, 15-3, 15-12,
15-11. Match-time was one

hour, 15 minutes.
"The main problem was that
as a team no one really had an
outstanding match," Sturm
said. "It was just one of those
matches. . . ."
The loss dropped Stanford's
overall record to 8-15 and its
CIVA (California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association)
mark to 3-12 with just one
match remaining this season.
UCSB, meanwhile, moved to
23-7 overall and 10-5 in the con
ference, solidifying its chances

for post-season play.
"You've got to give Santa
Barbara a lot of credit,'' Sturm
said. "Four errors in three
games is unheard of. And .418
is a fantastic hitting percent
age."
Stanford, on the other hand,
made a total of 17 errors in the
three games and had a .243 hit
ting percentage, a far cry from
UCSB's phenominal statistics.
Craig Lauchner led the Car
dinal with 10 kills and a .364
hitting percentage. )on Root

had nine kills, while Dan Pan
finished with tight.
Stanford's next match will be
its final one of the season, a
home affair with No. 2 ranked
Pepperdine. The match is
scheduled for this Tuesday
night at 7:30 at Maples Pavil
ion.
Sturm hopes to end the sea
son on a positive note or, in
other words, with a win over
the Waves "We have nothing
to lose and everything to gain
against a team like Pepper
dine," he said.
