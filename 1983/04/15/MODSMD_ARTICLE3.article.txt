President Reagan's arms control
policies may shift the focus of the
arms race toward first strike technol
ogy, Herbert Scoville told the third
annual Arms Control and Disarma
ment Forum at Kresge Auditorium
last night.
In a somber speech before approx
imately 125 people, Scoville, a
former assistant director of the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency,
explained that although "Reagan's
proposal maks some good efforts to
decrease the total number of
weapons, it doesn't go far enough in
stopping the advance of technology.
"He wants to stop, but he also
wants to keep the new weapons,"
said Scoville. The advance of
technology, however, creates a first
strike, offensive weapon. First strike
weapons represent a drastic change
from the previously defensive post
ure of both the United States and the
Soviet Union.
"We constantly try to develop bet
ter weapons so that we will have the
upper hand in negotiations. But in
stead of an upper hand, we merely

push the Soviets into developing bet
ter, more offensive weapons," said
Scoville.
Scoville used the MX missile as an
example of this technology-based
arms race. "The MX missile is only
useful if used as a first strike weapon.
This forces the Soviets into counter
action."
According to Scoville, the Reagan
administration is now pushing for
not only the MX missile system, but
has also resurrected the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) defense system.
A recent report by the Scocroft
Commission will fuel the Reagan
case for the MX, he said, because the
commission is made up of pro-MX
experts. "But everything about the
MX says that it is a weapon that
makes the world dangerous," said
Scoville.
Scoville also criticized the ABM de
fense system suggested by Reagan,
saying the ABM is based on laser
satellites which are designed to
shoot down attacking missiles. "It's
like trying to hit a dime from a
hundred miles. No one would deny
the possibility, but they (the lasers)

DECRIES REAGAN'S ARMS POLICY: In an address at Kresge Au
ditorium, Herbert Scoville, former director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said that the current arms policy seems devoted
to technology more capable of a first-strike than acting as a defensive
force.
