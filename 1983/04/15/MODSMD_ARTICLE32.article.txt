It's hard to say when the
"croissant (raze" started. Al
most overnight the buttery
trench pastries appeared iri
l),ike shops and cafes across
the country.
At first the croissants were
simple: layers of light flaky
pastry shaped like the crescent
moon tempted bakery regu
lar? But the croissant creators

dirln t stop there. Soon they
were sending out < heese crois
sants and apple croissants and
for the chocolate fanatics,
chocolate chip croissants. Like
Perrier and quiche, croissants
quickly captured the hearts of
the masses.
A look around campus is
convincing evidence of the
wide base of appeal croissants
enjoy. Marcel's, Vhe Coffee
House, Nuts'n Mud, and prac
tically every department
lounge on campus feature the
delicate pastry. Students and

faculty alike munch on (rois
sants for breakfast, in between
classes and at lunch.
With such a growing follow
ing it seems understandable
that slick imitators would jump
on the bandwagon and peddle
their version of the French
croissant. But no imitation can
fool the true croissant con
noiseur. And Oh! Croissant, a
newcomer to the wealth of
croissant shops serving the
Palo Alto area has taken this
into account in developing its
menu.

Open tor only one week,
Oh! ( roissant is located just
past the overpass on University
Avenue. The cafe is small and
perfectly designed tor the
shopper who wants a meal
with a minimum of fuss. I fieri'
is limited counter seating.
Many < ustomers simply stop m
to pick up their order I he ser
vers are friendly and though
thf wail is seldom more than a
few minutes customers take
advantage of the time to try
free croissant samples.
Oh! Ctoissant offers a well

rounded and moderately
priced menu. The sandwich
< roissants are sure to become
art aiea favorite. Though their
p nit does not yet allow them
to make the concoctions on
the premises, manager Rose
Guerriero said they are pre
pared fresh each day at one of
1 h t e e other local cafe
branches. Sandwiches are all
5i.95 and include ham and
cheese, turkey, roast beef,
chicken saiad, pastrami and
vegetarian.
\c cording to Guerriero, Oh!

Croissant is the only cafe to
garnish the croissants with let
tuce and tomato and serve the
entire combination oven
warmed. Whether or not they
are the only ones doesn't mat
ter. What matters is that it's a
great idea and Oh! Croissant
takes pride in its ingredients.
"Our policy is to give quality,"
Cuerriero said.
Quality is definitely present
in Oh! Croissant's menu. The
raspberry and apple desert
croissants are delicious. At
$1.10 the raspberry croissant is

a tart treat and the apple a full
bodied filling, though it does
seem that a little cinnamon
would go a long way in increas
ing the croissants' popularity.
Natural sodas and juices as
well as exotic coffees ranging
from 50 cents to $1.50 are also
available.
I he cafe is open seven days a
week, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Monday through Saturday and
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sun
day.
