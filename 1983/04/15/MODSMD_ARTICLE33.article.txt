Since moving to the Bay Area a few years
ago, I never really thought of San Mateo as
my shangri-la of restaurant dreams. My
skepticism has been tested, however, by a
night at Borel's—an establishment that is
true to its theme—"Seafood from a higher
point of view."
Being a perennially tardy individual, I
made it a point to be prompt on this evening.
Speeding along Highway 280, and not being
familiar with the restaurant's location, I was
sure I d be late once again. Not to worry,
though, as Borel's is conveniently located a
brief distance off of Highway 92, overlook
ing the bay.
Arriving precisely at our pre-arranged
timeof 7 p.m., my partner and I were some
what disappointed to find that our reserva
tions were not recorded at the desk inside
Borel's front entrance. Immediately my date
and I looked apprehensively at one another,
fearing a repeat of some past reviews. Our
worries were put to rest promptly as the
hostess shrugged off the mistakeand invited
us to proceed downstairs into the dining
area.
Descending from the upper level we
reached checkpoint number two—a loca
tion, I've concluded, where a second hos
tess confirms whether or not you re still
interested in eating that evening. Not quite
relaxed as yet, I hesitantly replied in the af
firmative and with a tightened grip on my
partner's hand, approached our table.
The entire dining area was arranged in var
ious levels, each of which faced the beautiful
setting outside. Our table was situated in a
row with others on the second tier one level
away from the bay window. My partner, al
ways attentive, brought up the fact that there
were no "bad seats" in the house. The set
ting reminded me of the Shakespearian
adage—"All the world's a stage", with the
treetop view of San Mateo, its bridge, and
the country on the other side of the water as
our backdrop.

Our attention was pleasantly diverted
from the surroundings only a few moments
after we had settled into our vinyl cylinder
shaped chairs with K-Mart rollers allowing
for a smooth, secretary-like slide to and from
the edge of the table. Dave, our extremely
congenial waiter, informed us of the day's
specialties. The selection that evening
ranged from salmon and halibut to filet
mignon with bernaise sause. My date's eyes
lit up on the mention of the latter dish, so I
decided to turn to the menu for a taste of the
regular items.
Choosing an appetizer became really
tough when I realized the many ways I could
have oysters or shrimp. For about $4, the
selection offered oysters on the half shell,
barbecued oysters or oysters Rockefeller. I
selected the Gulf Shrimp Cocktail, $4.95,
among shrimp Remoulade, vermicelli
tredda with bay shrimp and bay shrimp
papaya.
My choice turned out to be just about
what I expected. Curled around the edge of
a large, iced, wine-shaped glass were seven,
two bite-sized shrimp arranged around a
bed of lettuce. The long-tailed crustaceans
were tresh and delicious—my apprehen
sions were beginning to dissipate.
My date selected a fresh artichoke from
the a la carte section for her appetizer. It was
nice to see they could be ordered either hot
or cold. Her hot" appetizer was also plainly
presented; admittedly, how many ways can a
little green vegetable be served? The dish
included either mayonnaise or melted but
ter for dipping the leaves into and arrived
with the top already chopped off—l assume
to allow one a chance to eat the vegetable
and not get an occasional "poke" from the
leaves' thorns.
The main entree was even more difficult to
select—everything looked good. The menu
offers dinners between $9.95 and $18.95,
with a clear choice between fish and meat
dishes. In the fish section, I noticed three
tvpes of scallops, broiled swordtish, chicken
picatta, t'ettuccine with smoked salmon, a
few shrimp dishes and the old standby of
lobster tail or steak and lobster.

In addition to the specialty meat dish of
the day, the menu also offers a regular or
Borel's cut of prime rib, about $17, and a
top sirloin steak, also within the $17 to
$18 range. Borel •> must have added its
meat selections onl\ to appease those of the
family who hate fish hut relent and go out for
a fish dinner anywav. At any rate, the small
selection was in no way indicative of the
quality.
For a change of p.ite, I picked the Stuffed
Sole Monterey, $11.95, which later proved
quitean addition to my regular Friday menu.
Before the arrival of our main entrees, our
respective dinner salads were placed before
us. Mine, a tossed i> eberg lettuce salad, was
crisp, fresh, and not too big. The typical
small tomatoes, c.irrots, red onions and
olives garnished its top. The Borel's blue
cheese dressing, meanwhile, was
spectacular—no chunks, just smooth and
spicy. My partner requested the alternative,
a fresh spinach salaii topped with bacon and
mushrooms.
At Dave's suggestion, we ordered a Char
donnay to accompanv our entrees. Not only
was our waiter correct with his suggestion,
but the Curgich Hills vino was more than
either myself or my date expected. This little
known Napa wine was fantastic —a little dry
but slightly sweet—the results are out of this
world. One contingency, however, is that a
beverage such as this should be saved for
very special occasions, since it does carry a
price tag of $25 a pop, (no pun intended).
With the freshly corked wine gracing our
table, my date and I were more than ready
for the main attraction. My mouth gaped
open as the filet mignon was placed in front
of my partner. The thick, juicy, sizzling meat
topped with a delicious bernaise sauce,
melted into my eyes and stomach. The piece
was large enough for one-and-a-half meals,
without an ounce of fat to waste any of its
bulk.
Still in awe, I saw my Stuffed Monterey
Sole bulging on my plate. Underneath the
white fish meat lay an overwhelming combi
nation of cheese, fresh tomatoes and other
tasty vegetables. The fish melted in my

mouth just as the filet had, yet the flavor was
bountiful and savory.
On either side of our entrees was a curi
ous combination of fresh vegetables, which
looked as if they were in an undecided state
between fresh and semi-sauteed/greasy.
As an afterthought I had ordered sauteed
mushrooms, and, reflecting later, I decided
the meal would have been almost perfect
without the latter two additions—the veget
ables and the fungi.
Quite convinced at this point that I had
been introduced into a first class fish/meat
operation, I waited optimistically for mv
white chocolate partait dessert. My partner
chose the carrot cake as an alternative to the
ice cream and cheese cake choices.
Dave seemed to cringe almost as much as
my date and I had when he placed her sup
posed dessert at her place. What appeared
to be a chunk of road pavement with pow
dered sugar was meant to be, of course, the
cake. The ever-polite waiter excused the res
taurant, and himself, and requested our for
giveness for the obviously horrible facsimile
of a dessert.
My parfait, however, was quite the con
trast. The smooth and light dessert was a

perfect topping to what was, tor the most
part, a perfect night. Neither was it too rich
nor was it too sweet; rather, the dessert was
similar to a creamy white chocolate, yet
without its bulkiness.
The saga of "whatever happened to the
real carrot cake" ended when Dave insisted
that we not pay for the alleged carrot cake.
Not only did this lift my already high marks
for Borel's, but it gave me a satisfaction I
have rarely seen a restaurant—a waiter who
was sincere, polite and trustworthy to his
customers.
Borel's also has an attractive little lounge
which features nightly "aspiring" enter
tainmentand a pleasantatmosphere. Unlike
the suit-and-tie crowd in the dining area,
howe\er, this appears to be a come-as-you
are spot. Yet both seem to mix into a
homogeneous solution . Another item which
may catch your eyes are the modern twisted
and polished sculptures that decorate the
establishment. I would venture a guess that
whoever decorated Borel's must have had a
hand in some of the Stanford campus
beauties. At least they fit at Borel's.

Since moving to the Bay Area a few years
ago, I never really thought of San Mateo as
my shangri-la of restaurant dreams. My
skepticism has been tested, however, by a
night at Borel's—an establishment that is
true to its theme—"Seafood from a higher
point of view."
Being a perennially tardy individual, I
made it a point to be prompt on this evening.
Speeding along Highway 280, and not being
familiar with the restaurant's location, I was
sure I d be late once again. Not to worry,
though, as Borel's is conveniently located a
brief distance off of Highway 92, overlook
ing the bay.
Arriving precisely at our pre-arranged
timeof 7 p.m., my partner and I were some
what disappointed to find that our reserva
tions were not recorded at the desk inside
Borel's front entrance. Immediately my date
and I looked apprehensively at one another,
fearing a repeat of some past reviews. Our
worries were put to rest promptly as the
hostess shrugged off the mistakeand invited
us to proceed downstairs into the dining
area.
Descending from the upper level we
reached checkpoint number two—a loca
tion, I've concluded, where a second hos
tess confirms whether or not you re still
interested in eating that evening. Not quite
relaxed as yet, I hesitantly replied in the af
firmative and with a tightened grip on my
partner's hand, approached our table.
The entire dining area was arranged in var
ious levels, each of which faced the beautiful
setting outside. Our table was situated in a
row with others on the second tier one level
away from the bay window. My partner, al
ways attentive, brought up the fact that there
were no "bad seats" in the house. The set
ting reminded me of the Shakespearian
adage—"All the world's a stage", with the
treetop view of San Mateo, its bridge, and
the country on the other side of the water as
our backdrop.

Our attention was pleasantly diverted
from the surroundings only a few moments
after we had settled into our vinyl cylinder
shaped chairs with K-Mart rollers allowing
for a smooth, secretary-like slide to and from
the edge of the table. Dave, our extremely
congenial waiter, informed us of the day's
specialties. The selection that evening
ranged from salmon and halibut to filet
mignon with bernaise sause. My date's eyes
lit up on the mention of the latter dish, so I
decided to turn to the menu for a taste of the
regular items.
Choosing an appetizer became really
tough when I realized the many ways I could
have oysters or shrimp. For about $4, the
selection offered oysters on the half shell,
barbecued oysters or oysters Rockefeller. I
selected the Gulf Shrimp Cocktail, $4.95,
among shrimp Remoulade, vermicelli
tredda with bay shrimp and bay shrimp
papaya.
My choice turned out to be just about
what I expected. Curled around the edge of
a large, iced, wine-shaped glass were seven,
two bite-sized shrimp arranged around a
bed of lettuce. The long-tailed crustaceans
were tresh and delicious—my apprehen
sions were beginning to dissipate.
My date selected a fresh artichoke from
the a la carte section for her appetizer. It was
nice to see they could be ordered either hot
or cold. Her hot" appetizer was also plainly
presented; admittedly, how many ways can a
little green vegetable be served? The dish
included either mayonnaise or melted but
ter for dipping the leaves into and arrived
with the top already chopped off—l assume
to allow one a chance to eat the vegetable
and not get an occasional "poke" from the
leaves' thorns.
The main entree was even more difficult to
select—everything looked good. The menu
offers dinners between $9.95 and $18.95,
with a clear choice between fish and meat
dishes. In the fish section, I noticed three
tvpes of scallops, broiled swordtish, chicken
picatta, t'ettuccine with smoked salmon, a
few shrimp dishes and the old standby of
lobster tail or steak and lobster.

In addition to the specialty meat dish of
the day, the menu also offers a regular or
Borel's cut of prime rib, about $17, and a
top sirloin steak, also within the $17 to
$18 range. Borel •> must have added its
meat selections onl\ to appease those of the
family who hate fish hut relent and go out for
a fish dinner anywav. At any rate, the small
selection was in no way indicative of the
quality.
For a change of p.ite, I picked the Stuffed
Sole Monterey, $11.95, which later proved
quitean addition to my regular Friday menu.
Before the arrival of our main entrees, our
respective dinner salads were placed before
us. Mine, a tossed i> eberg lettuce salad, was
crisp, fresh, and not too big. The typical
small tomatoes, c.irrots, red onions and
olives garnished its top. The Borel's blue
cheese dressing, meanwhile, was
spectacular—no chunks, just smooth and
spicy. My partner requested the alternative,
a fresh spinach salaii topped with bacon and
mushrooms.
At Dave's suggestion, we ordered a Char
donnay to accompanv our entrees. Not only
was our waiter correct with his suggestion,
but the Curgich Hills vino was more than
either myself or my date expected. This little
known Napa wine was fantastic —a little dry
but slightly sweet—the results are out of this
world. One contingency, however, is that a
beverage such as this should be saved for
very special occasions, since it does carry a
price tag of $25 a pop, (no pun intended).
With the freshly corked wine gracing our
table, my date and I were more than ready
for the main attraction. My mouth gaped
open as the filet mignon was placed in front
of my partner. The thick, juicy, sizzling meat
topped with a delicious bernaise sauce,
melted into my eyes and stomach. The piece
was large enough for one-and-a-half meals,
without an ounce of fat to waste any of its
bulk.

Quite convinced at this point that I had

white chocolate partait dessert. My partner
chose the carrot cake as an alternative to the
ice cream and cheese cake choices.
Dave seemed to cringe almost as much as

two bite-sized shrimp arranged around a
bed of lettuce. The long-tailed crustaceans
were tresh and delicious—my apprehen
sions were beginning to dissipate.
My date selected a fresh artichoke from
the a la carte section for her appetizer. It was
nice to see they could be ordered either hot
or cold. Her hot" appetizer was also plainly
presented; admittedly, how many ways can a
little green vegetable be served? The dish
included either mayonnaise or melted but
ter for dipping the leaves into and arrived
with the top already chopped off—l assume
to allow one a chance to eat the vegetable
and not get an occasional "poke" from the
leaves' thorns.
The main entree was even more difficult to
select—everything looked good. The menu
offers dinners between $9.95 and $18.95,
with a clear choice between fish and meat
dishes. In the fish section, I noticed three
tvpes of scallops, broiled swordtish, chicken
picatta, t'ettuccine with smoked salmon, a
few shrimp dishes and the old standby of
lobster tail or steak and lobster.

In addition to the specialty meat dish of
the day, the menu also offers a regular or
Borel's cut of prime rib, about $17, and a
top sirloin steak, also within the $17 to
$18 range. Borel •> must have added its
meat selections onl\ to appease those of the
family who hate fish hut relent and go out for
a fish dinner anywav. At any rate, the small
selection was in no way indicative of the
quality.
For a change of p.ite, I picked the Stuffed
Sole Monterey, $11.95, which later proved
quitean addition to my regular Friday menu.
Before the arrival of our main entrees, our
respective dinner salads were placed before
us. Mine, a tossed i> eberg lettuce salad, was
crisp, fresh, and not too big. The typical
small tomatoes, c.irrots, red onions and
olives garnished its top. The Borel's blue
cheese dressing, meanwhile, was
spectacular—no chunks, just smooth and
spicy. My partner requested the alternative,
a fresh spinach salaii topped with bacon and
mushrooms.
At Dave's suggestion, we ordered a Char
donnay to accompanv our entrees. Not only
was our waiter correct with his suggestion,
but the Curgich Hills vino was more than
either myself or my date expected. This little
known Napa wine was fantastic —a little dry
but slightly sweet—the results are out of this
world. One contingency, however, is that a
beverage such as this should be saved for
very special occasions, since it does carry a
price tag of $25 a pop, (no pun intended).
With the freshly corked wine gracing our
table, my date and I were more than ready
for the main attraction. My mouth gaped
open as the filet mignon was placed in front
of my partner. The thick, juicy, sizzling meat
topped with a delicious bernaise sauce,
melted into my eyes and stomach. The piece
was large enough for one-and-a-half meals,
without an ounce of fat to waste any of its
bulk.
Still in awe, I saw my Stuffed Monterey
Sole bulging on my plate. Underneath the
white fish meat lay an overwhelming combi
nation of cheese, fresh tomatoes and other
tasty vegetables. The fish melted in my

mouth just as the filet had, yet the flavor was
bountiful and savory.
On either side of our entrees was a curi
ous combination of fresh vegetables, which
looked as if they were in an undecided state
between fresh and semi-sauteed/greasy.
As an afterthought I had ordered sauteed
mushrooms, and, reflecting later, I decided
the meal would have been almost perfect
without the latter two additions—the veget
ables and the fungi.
Quite convinced at this point that I had
been introduced into a first class fish/meat
operation, I waited optimistically for mv
white chocolate partait dessert. My partner
chose the carrot cake as an alternative to the
ice cream and cheese cake choices.
Dave seemed to cringe almost as much as
my date and I had when he placed her sup
posed dessert at her place. What appeared
to be a chunk of road pavement with pow
dered sugar was meant to be, of course, the
cake. The ever-polite waiter excused the res
taurant, and himself, and requested our for
giveness for the obviously horrible facsimile
of a dessert.
My parfait, however, was quite the con
trast. The smooth and light dessert was a

perfect topping to what was, tor the most
part, a perfect night. Neither was it too rich
nor was it too sweet; rather, the dessert was
similar to a creamy white chocolate, yet
without its bulkiness.
The saga of "whatever happened to the
real carrot cake" ended when Dave insisted
that we not pay for the alleged carrot cake.
Not only did this lift my already high marks
for Borel's, but it gave me a satisfaction I
have rarely seen a restaurant—a waiter who
was sincere, polite and trustworthy to his
customers.
Borel's also has an attractive little lounge
which features nightly "aspiring" enter
tainmentand a pleasantatmosphere. Unlike
the suit-and-tie crowd in the dining area,
howe\er, this appears to be a come-as-you
are spot. Yet both seem to mix into a
homogeneous solution . Another item which
may catch your eyes are the modern twisted
and polished sculptures that decorate the
establishment. I would venture a guess that
whoever decorated Borel's must have had a
hand in some of the Stanford campus
beauties. At least they fit at Borel's.
