Reviews by Steve Vineberg

"He was a great actor if
you got his attention .."
— Howard Hawks on
John Barrymore
"You've heard a lot
about the Barrymore
temperament. It's not
true except maybe about
Ethel and she's full of
prunes."
— John Barrymore
Possibly apocryphal ex
change:
Katharine Hepburn:
"I'm never going to act
with you again."
fonn Barrymore: "I
wasn't aware that you
had."
Twentieth Century (1934)
Kresge Auditorium ★
Ben Hecht and Charles
Mac Arthur adapted this
brilliant screwball comedy from
Charles Bruce Millholland's
play Napoleon of Broadway,
and Howard Hawks directed, in
the frantic, crack style he would
later use for Bringing Up Baby
and His Girl Friday. This picture
is not as well known as either of
the others, but it's in the same
league. As the ruthless, ego
maniacal Broadway producer
Oscar Jaffe, John Barrymore
gives a magnificent, full-scale
parodistic performance; he,
Hawks and the script bring out
the best in Carole Lombard,
who plays Mildred Plotka, the
nobody he turns into a star
(changing her name to Lily Gar
land) and hounds mercilessly.
These two are the ultimate the
atrical monsters who turn every
moment of their lives into ex
travagant melodrama. The film
is called Twentieth Century be
cause most of it takes places on
the famous train of that name
that crossed the continent in
the '30s. The extremely skillful
supporting cast features Roscoe
Karns and Walter Connolly as
Jaffe's loyal associates, Ralph
Forbes, Charles Lane, Edgar
as the meek luna
tic, Etienne Cirardot.
Plays tonight.
Adam's Rib (1949) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ruth Gordon and Carson
Kanin, a husband-and-wife
screenwriting team, came up
with an inspired plot idea for
this Spencer Tracy-Katharine
Hepburn movie: the stars play
husband-and-wife lawyers who
argue opposite sides of a case of
attempted murder. It's a prize
comedy. Tracy and Hepburn
had already made five films to
gether (and would make three
more), and their teamwork
glistened with wit and finesse;
furthermore, they had never
had anywhere near as sharp a
script to play. (Three years later,
Gordon and Kanin wrote a still
better one for them — Pat and
Mike.) George Cukor directed,
seamlessly, Cole Porter wrote
the (mediocre) theme song,
"Amanda," and a number of
buoyantly talented people pro
vided support for the stars —
David Wayne, Tom Ewell, Judy
Holliday and Jean Hagen. (Ewell
and Holliday play the plaintiff
and defendant in the court
case.)
Plays Thursday with The Phil
adelphia Story.

A Clockwork Orange (1971)
Kresge Auditorium
Anthony Burgess' novel was
a satire on the polarized state
he felt Western society was ap
proaching: young Alex is a des
picable thug who is "re
habilitated" by behavioral psy
chologists, i.e., reduced to a
benign blur. The nasty joke, of
course, is that the two alter
natives — social and anti-social
conduct — are equally re
pellent. But in Stanley Kubrick's
film version, Alex is made so
sympathetic — and all of socie
ty's representatives are such
megalomaniacal halfwits — that
we are manipulated into cheer
ing for his highly objectionable
acts of rebellion. Shrewdly,
Kubrick has cast vivacious, win
ning Malcolm McDowell — a
performer whom no one could
dislike — in the role of Alex.
This is a morally questionable
film, directed in such an im

personal manner that even the
violence doesn't affect us; it
seems to transpire in a vacuum.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Performance (1970)
Fox, Redwood City
James Fox and Mick Jagger
play opposite numbers — a
gangster and a rock singer —
who, Personalike, merge and
switch personalities in this
druggy cult favorite by Nicolas
Roeg (who also photographed)
and Donald Cammell (who
wrote the script). Roeg hadn't
yet acquired his talent for erot
ica: the sex scenes, in which all
sorts of combinations are
hinted at, make so little visual
sense that they have a distinctly
soporific quality. Incoherent
and extremely unpleasant, this

is a film that perhaps can only
be comprehended by mov
iegoers who see it under the in
fluence of chemicals but can be
detested by all of us. The only
redeeming few moments are
provided by Jagger, who per
forms one terrific number.
Anita Pallenberg heads an un
distinguished supporting cast.
lays today with The Man Who
Fell to Earth.
The Thin Man (1934) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
Most people have forgotten
who the murderer is in this fa
mous adaptation of the Dashiell
Hammett novel, but not who
the detectives are: Nick and
Nora Charles, the most elegant
sleuthing combination in the
history of movies. Never
without a highball or a bon mot,
they suavely killed off the stage
bound, schematic thrillers of

the early talkie period, and be
came so popular that five se
quels were made (the last one
in 1947). (An amusing bit of triv
ia: the title alludes to a detail of
the mystery, but it caught on so
fast that all the follow-ups had
The Thin Man stuck, irrelevant
ly, in their titles.) William
Powell and Myrna Loy proved
to be so good together (and
such a smash at the box office)
that they teamed on several
other films, too, including The
Great Ziegfeld, in which he
played the celebrated show
man and she played Billie
Burke. Screenplay (a smart one)
by Frances Goodrich and Albert
Hackett; W.S. Van Dyke
directed (more deftly than usu
al). With Maureen O'Sullivan,
Nat Pendleton, Minna Gom
bell, Edward Ellis, Porter Hall,

Cesar Romero, Edward Brophy
and others.
Plays through Wednesday
with Murder Ahoyl
A Geisha (1953)
Geology Corner, Room 320
Although he is famous for
the visual splendor of costume
epics like Ugetsu Monogatari
and Sansho the Bailiff, Kenji
Mizoguchi also made a number
of i.ielodramas on feminist
themes, such as this one about
the life of a geisha. Michiyo
Kogure and Ayako Wakao play,
respectively, an experienced
geisha and a novice in her care
(the illegitimate daughter of
her closest friend, now dead);
the film shows us the indignities
they are obliged to suffer. Their
employer (Chieko Naniwa) ex
pects them to comply with the
sexual requests of the men they
entertain, because above all

they must not offend their cus
tomers. It's certainly a great
subject, and Miaoguchi han
dles it in a fairly intelligent, low
key manner, but the movie nev
er catches fire. (Mizoguchi's re
fusal to sensationalize is both
the film's major virtue and its
major vice.) The acting is for
gettable, except for a bit by
Eitaro Shindo as Wakao's weak,
bankrupt father. Yoshikata
Yoda wrote the script (based on
a magazine story).
Plays tonight.
Reds (1981) ★
Memorial Auditorium
Warren Beatty produced,
directed, co-wrote (with Trevor
Griffiths) and stars in an in
telligent, unconventional,
craftsmanlike movie chiefly

about the love affair between
John Reed, the American cor
respondent who wrote Ten
Days That Shook the World,
and Louise Bryant (Diane
Keaton). He keeps the narrative
line remarkably clear, though
the first part could stand
restructuring. In the second
part, when Reed and Bryant go
to Russia, the movie jerks them
into adulthood, and they turn
out to be fascinating people —
which does wonders for Beat
ty's and Keaton's acting.
Maureen Stapleton and Jack
Nicholson give first-rate per
formances as Emma Goldman
and Eugene O'Neill. Carefully
shot by Vittorio Storaro.
Plays Sunday evening.
The Marriage of Maria
Braun (1979)
Haus Mitteleuropa
The opening scenes are in
triguing — Maria (Hanna
Schygulla) loses her husband to
the war on their wedding day;
after it is over she parades up
and down the platform at the
train station with a placard ask
ing homecoming soldiers for
information on his where
abouts. But the movie soon de
generates into a political fable
about Germany and capitalism
that is alternately obvious and
opaque. Though much better
crafted than Rainer
Fassbinder's earlier movies, it's
emotionally blank. Schuygulla,
Fassbinder's favorite actress,
looks amazing and gives an in
teresting, Dietrich-like per
formance.
Plays Thurdsay evening.
Bananas (1971) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen's funniest mov
ie (co-written with Mickey
Rose). Much of it takes place in
a banana republic where
Woody is fighting for the revo
lution; there is also a screwball
r courtroom sequence in the sec
ond half that is a classic. Louise
Lasser co-stars as a woman
whose every action seems to be
a parody of something in an In
gmar Bergman picture. The
direction and photography are
clumsy beyond the telling, but
most of the time you're too
helpless with laughter to no
tice.
Plays tomorrow with Ev
erything You A/ways Wanted to
Know About Sex and Sleeper.
Everything You Always
Wanted to Know About Sex
(1972) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Wildly erratic as it is, this
movie contains the best 15
minutes Woody Allen has ever
done: the sketch in which he
plays a sperm being prepared
for launching. (Tony Randall
and Burt Reynolds are at the
controls.) The other gem in the
picture is the episode in which
an inspired Gene Wilder plays a
doctor who falls in love with a
sheep named Daisy. The first
skit, with Allen as an unfunny

jester and Anthony Quayle and
Lynn Redgrave as his king and
queen, begins promisingly but
declines quickly when Allen
gets his hand caught in Red
grave's chastity belt. There are
also a parody of Antonioni (rea
sonably funny), a sci-fi take-off
about a giant breast (silly), a
quiz show called "What's My
Perversion?" (pretty bad), and a
quarter of an hour with Lou
Jacobi as a transvestite (hope
less).
Plays tomorrow with Sleeper
and Bananas.
Demon Pond (1980) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Masahiro Shinoda made this
beautiful, offbeat movie with
Japan's leading Kabuki actor,
Tamasbuto Bando, in the two
pivotal (female) roles. The film
is double-layered: the main
plot concerns a young
schoolteacher whose search for
his best friend leads him to the
home of a young woman whose
love holds the lost friend cap
tive, and the secondary plot is
the legend of Demon Pond,
which runs by the woman's
home in the hills. Shinoda
didn't work out a successful
technique for merging the
styles of the two stories, but the
power of his imagery fires
across the narrative and charac
terological confusion, even if
Bando's peculiar stylization and
the weird, highly charged ma
terial take some getting used to.
(When you do get used to him,
Bando is extraordinary.) One
might best describe Demon
Pond as a Hans Christian An
dersen tale told by a Japanese
artist who is a combination of
Gustave Dore and Salvador
Daii.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with I Kwaidan.
Sleeper (1973) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Woody Allen's mostly visual
futuristic comedy is consistent
ly funny but never takes off into
the far-out realm of the craziest
sequences in Bananas and Ev
erything You Always Wanted to
Know About Sex. He plays the
owner of a health food store
who is frozen in the 20th cen
tury and wakes up in the 21st;
the first thing he learns is that
junk food, scientists have dis
covered, is really good for you.
With Diane Keaton, who does a
memorable imitation of Brando
in A Streetcar Named Desire,
John Beck and Mary Gregory.
Marshall Brickman co-wrote
the screenplay.
Plays tomorrow with Bananas
and Everything You Always
Wanted to Know About Sex.
Body Heat (1981)
Fox, Redwood City
This openly derivative film
noir, made with relentless at
tention to the title metaphor
(smoke and flame fill almost ev
ery scene) but little style,
caused a lot of fuss when it
came out last year, for some
reason. The explicit dialogue
seems peculiar in a story so ob
viously carved after James M,
Cain (with William Hurt as the

sap and Kathryn Walker as the
femme fatale), and since the
setting is contemporary, you
wonder what's wrong with
these weird, obsessed charac
ters who walk around as though
they were caught in a '40s mov
ie. Hurt does a couple of good
double takes, but he doesn't
hold a candle (if I can extend
the metaphor) to Mickey
Rourke's bit as an arsonist.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with Still of the Ni^ht.
Still of the Night
Fox, Redwood City
Yolk know a mystery's in
trouble when the corpse is
more interesting than any of
the live characters. In this mov
ie, written and directed by Rob
ert Benton (from a story by Ben
ton and David Newman), a psy
chiatrist (Roy Scheider) tries to
solve the murder of one of his
patients (Josef Sommer) by re
constructing their sessions and
interpreting one of his dreams,
and in the flashbacks Sommer
has some of the same elegant
malevolence Robert Ryan used
to display in his psychotic roles.
The rest of the picture is splen
didly composed (Nestor
Almendros shot it) and
absolutely lethal — a bloodless
tribute to Alfred Hitchcock.
Scheider gives a dry, drowsy
performance, and Meryl
Streep, playing a neurotic
woman who had an affair with
the dead man and may or may
not have killed him, is silly and
finicky. With Sara Bostford in a
brief role — she has a couple of
vibrant scenes — and Jessica
Tandy.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with Body Heat.
Gandhi
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
A three-and-a-quarter-hour
soporific. Richard Atten
borough doesn't have the right
qualities for epic filmmaking;
furthermore, out of either a
lack of personal resources or an
ascetic refusal to vulgarize
Gandhi's story, he resists turn
ing it into theater. And in the
process of purifying it of his
torical lumps, he has buried
much essential factual informa
tion and obfuscated the issues.
Ben Kingsley brings a fascinat
ing mixture of understated pas
sion and unpredictable wit to
the title role — he humanizes
the icon John Briley's homiletic
screenpay sets up — but the rest
of the cast (John Gielgud, Ed
ward Fox. Trevor Howard,
Martin Sheen, Candice Bergen,
Ian Charleson, Michael
Hordern, John Mills, etc., etc.)
is just expensive dressing.
