Senate OKs Adelman

Washington — The senate voted 57 to 42 yesterday
to confirm President Reagan's controversial nomi
nation of Kenneth Adelman to head the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency.
The margin of victory, bolstered by eight Demo
crats who voted with the Republican majority, was
surprisingly large.
A disappointed aide to Senator Claiborn Pell (D-
R. 1.), the Democratic floor manager, attributed the
turnabout to the fact that the campaign against
Adelman ran out of ammunition in the final days and
to effective lobbying by the administration.

The lobbying was most evident in a rare appearance
by Vice President George Bush on the senate podium
to preside during the final roll call.
The confirmation puts and end to 13 weeks of con
troversy. Opponents hotly protested the nomination,
charging that Adelman was neither experienced or
committed enough to be an effective advocate for
arms control.
Such criticism continued throughout the three days
of Senate debate. Senators opposed to the nomi
nation repeatedly spoke of the Adelman appearance
before the Foreign Relations Committee in which he
demonstrated scant knowledge of key facets of arms
control. He told Pell, for instance, that he didn't know
whether nuclear war could be limited.
But his supporters emphasize that in subsequent
appearances a less-nervous, better informed
Adelman impressed the committee with his in
telligence, and insisted that he supported arms con
trol.
Much of the debate, however, revolved less around
the Adelman nomination than on the adminis
tration's arms control policy. Senators ranging from
Jake Garn (R-Utah) to Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) pledged
their ardent support of arms control with most insist
ing that it is the paramount political problem of our
time.
Reagan denies Nicaraguan plot
Washington — President Reagan said yesterday
that the United States is not trying to overthrow the
Nicaraguan government and that all his adminis
tration is attempting to do is sever the supply of arms
from Nicaragua to leftist guerrillas in U.S.-backed El
Salvador.
The president's remarks represented the furthest
any administration official has gone in publicly com
menting on the increasingly controversial situation in
Nicaragua. Several congressmen and some former
U.S. diplomats have accused the administration of
supplying arms and training guerrillas attempting to
overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista-dominated gov
ernment.
Cuba not to receive missiles
Moscow — The Soviet Union has "no need" to put
nuclear missiles in Cuba in retaliation for U.S. deploy
ment of new medium-range rockets in Europe later
this year, a top Soviet general says.
It was the clearest signal yet from the Soviets that
Cuba does not figure in their threat to retaliate forthe
planned "Euromissile" deployment.

The comments were made by Maj. Gen. Yuri
Lebedev, a military adviser to Soviet arms-control ne
gotiators, in an interview with The Associated Press.
Solidarity calls for demonstrations
Warsaw, Poland — The Solidarity underground yes
terday urged Polish workers to demonstrate na
tionwide on May Day to protest "the taking of our
holiday" by the Communist regime.
The appeal was issued after police interrogated the
wife of Solidarity chief Lech Walesa for three hours.
Danuta Walesa said police in Gdansk frisked her
before questioning her about her husband's contacts
with the underground.
The underground communique, distributed to
Western reporters, said "We are calling for demon
strations under the slogans: free all political pris
oners; end price increases; (give) the fruits of labor to
society; (and) peace and solidarity."
It urged supporters to prepare protest marches,
paint placards and leaflets, and boycott official May
Day celebrations as "an expression of our opposition
against the taking of our holiday by the authorities
who declared war on their own society," a reference
to the declaration of martial law.

post their sixth straight gain and another record high
yesterday as Wall Street's eight-month-old bull mar
ket continued.

than 5 points in the early going, finished with an 8.61
gain at 1,165.25. In the last six trading days, the average
has soared 51.76 points.
