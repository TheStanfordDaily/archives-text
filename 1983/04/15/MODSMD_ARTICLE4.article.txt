Senate OKs Adelman

Washington â€” The senate voted 57 to 42 yesterday
to confirm President Reagan's controversial nomi
nation of Kenneth Adelman to head the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency.
The margin of victory, bolstered by eight Demo
crats who voted with the Republican majority, was
surprisingly large.
A disappointed aide to Senator Claiborn Pell (D-
R. 1.), the Democratic floor manager, attributed the
turnabout to the fact that the campaign against
Adelman ran out of ammunition in the final days and
to effective lobbying by the administration.

The lobbying was most evident in a rare appearance
by Vice President George Bush on the senate podium
to preside during the final roll call.
The confirmation puts and end to 13 weeks of con
troversy. Opponents hotly protested the nomination,
charging that Adelman was neither experienced or
committed enough to be an effective advocate for
arms control.
Such criticism continued throughout the three days
of Senate debate. Senators opposed to the nomi
nation repeatedly spoke of the Adelman appearance
before the Foreign Relations Committee in which he
demonstrated scant knowledge of key facets of arms
control. He told Pell, for instance, that he didn't know
whether nuclear war could be limited.
