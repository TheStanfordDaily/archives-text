## University rejects gay scholarship 
### LESLIE WEEDEN Staff writer 
The University has refused tor the
final time a $500 scholarship re
stricted to a male medical student
who openly declares his homosexu
ality, according to the potential
donor.
Robert Ragland, M.D., a psychia
trist from Florida, made his identity
known to the Daily by sending the
newspaper copies of his corre
spondences with University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy about the is
sue. The University had previously
refused to reveal the donor's name in
order to protect his privacy.
In a phone interview from his
Jacksonville home last night, Ragland
said that he received his $500 check
back from Stanford "some days ago"
and was "disappointed that they ha
ven't been able to discuss (the sub
ject)."
"They don't want to soil their
hands with it,"he said. "They are
keeping their distance from it like
sending a bomb."
"The whole point of the schol
arship was not to give money to gay
students," he said, "but to get the
issue—that they're not able to be
open—discussed, and get the cli
mate changed so people can be
open."
Ragland said that he prefers not to
use the term "homosexuality" be
cause he feels that it is used nega
tively in our society and is upsetting
to people when they hear it. In his
proposal to the University he de
scribed a homosexual as a person
"who has openly and publicly make
his gender affinity/preference man
ifest," because that description
"emphasizes his personhood."
Ragland characterized himselt as
"a person who has homosexual feel
ings."
Iris Brest, legal counsel here, said
yesterday that in several corre
spondences between Kennedy and
the potential donor, the president
had suggested various modifications
of the scholarship that would be ac
ceptable. These changes, however,

were not acceptable to the donor,
she said.
"There was never a suggestion that
the University was considering the
proposal and the donor never
suggested that he was interested in
changing it," she said
Brest said the University's position
has remained consistent all along
and reflects Kennedy's statement
during the KZSU Campus Confer
ence in February, that the proposal
had "two strikes against it." Not only
does the proposal require a declara
tion of faith which he was "very, very
worried about," but it "requires a
declaration that would not be possi
ble for an institution to validate with
out impermissible interference."
Brest said that she agreed with the
University's position that "it is an in
appropriate thing to ask in connec
tion with getting financial aid that
someone should suggest their sexual
preference. It is blatantly irrelevant
and intrusive to offer the opportunity
to someone to offer this informa
tion," she said.
Ragland claimed that Kennedy said
in a letter that the scholarship
"would be unfair to those who might
need help just as much but who
would prefer to keep their gender
preference private."
Ragland countered that "it is not a
matter of privacy but a matter of the
freedom to be open that is at stake."
"The excuse they always bring
up," he said, "is privacy, ignoring the
fact that it is an inalienable right,
given in the First Amendment, to be
open."
Concerning the problem of the re
quirement of a declaration of faith,
Ragland said that no one would be
asked to offer that information. "I
emphasized that applicants would al
ready have made manifest their pref
erence simply by applying."
In addition, he said that his propo
sal did not require validation. "All
you have to do is just accept their
statement," he said. Ragland said
that after asking the University to
make his proposal available to the
medical students, "which the secre
tary dutifully did," he received a let
ter from a female medical student
who said she knew that some medi
cal students were gay, but also knew
that none of them would openly de
clare it.
Ragland said he does not believe
that "there are any medical students
at Stanford or elsewhere who prefer
to keep their same gender prefer
ence private' any more than there are
Polish citizens who prefer to limit the
exercise of their freedom."
He said he feels strongly that "Both
are coerced to take the actions they
take by the threat of sanctions
against them, violence, incarcera
tion, lossof job, friends, family, etc."

Ragland said the great majority of
heterosexual students display their
sexual preferences quite freely and
without objection from society; in
fact society often demands this kind
of behavior declaration. He said he
feels that it is very unhealthy for
those with same gender affinity to
have to stifle their preferences.
"Homosexuality is not a problem
unless society makes it one," he said.
Ragland said that the University
did offer some suggestions such as
establishing a student counseling
center, but he called that "putting
bandaids on cancer," where the
cancer is the social problem.
He said that another University
suggestion was to accept a Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford proposal
to begin a scholarship that would
give preference to medical students
who have served the gay community.

Although Ragland was "very
pleased with what they've done," he
said that their plans "just didn't send
me" because their proposal did not
do anything to promote discussion
and openness about homosexuality
"I'm for talking," he said. He wants
to "get people to discuss the reper
cussions of not discussing this for a
University dedicated to pursuing
truth and knowledge."
Ragland said that he does not plan
to keep trying to get Stanford to ac
cept the scholarship. He said that he
has offered the same scholarship to
12 other universities, many of which
are much closer to Florida. These will
therefore be easier to communicate
with, he said.
Ragland said that he had suggested
hiring some openly gay physicians
and professors in the medical
school.

and reflects Kennedy's statement
during the KZSU Campus Confer
ence in February, that the proposal
had "two strikes against it." Not only
does the proposal require a declara
tion of faith which he was "very, very
worried about," but it "requires a
declaration that would not be possi
ble for an institution to validate with
out impermissible interference."
Brest said that she agreed with the
University's position that "it is an in
appropriate thing to ask in connec
tion with getting financial aid that
someone should suggest their sexual
preference. It is blatantly irrelevant
and intrusive to offer the opportunity
to someone to offer this informa
tion," she said.
Ragland claimed that Kennedy said
in a letter that the scholarship
"would be unfair to those who might
need help just as much but who
would prefer to keep their gender
preference private."
Ragland countered that "it is not a
matter of privacy but a matter of the
freedom to be open that is at stake."
"The excuse they always bring
up," he said, "is privacy, ignoring the
fact that it is an inalienable right,
given in the First Amendment, to be
open."
Concerning the problem of the re
quirement of a declaration of faith,
Ragland said that no one would be
asked to offer that information. "I
emphasized that applicants would al
ready have made manifest their pref
erence simply by applying."
In addition, he said that his propo
sal did not require validation. "All
you have to do is just accept their
statement," he said. Ragland said
that after asking the University to
make his proposal available to the
medical students, "which the secre
tary dutifully did," he received a let
ter from a female medical student
who said she knew that some medi
cal students were gay, but also knew
that none of them would openly de
clare it.
Ragland said he does not believe
that "there are any medical students
at Stanford or elsewhere who prefer
to keep their same gender prefer
ence private' any more than there are
Polish citizens who prefer to limit the
exercise of their freedom."
He said he feels strongly that "Both
are coerced to take the actions they
take by the threat of sanctions
against them, violence, incarcera
tion, lossof job, friends, family, etc."

Ragland said the great majority of
heterosexual students display their
sexual preferences quite freely and
without objection from society; in
fact society often demands this kind
of behavior declaration. He said he
feels that it is very unhealthy for
those with same gender affinity to
have to stifle their preferences.
"Homosexuality is not a problem
unless society makes it one," he said.
Ragland said that the University
did offer some suggestions such as
establishing a student counseling
center, but he called that "putting
bandaids on cancer," where the
cancer is the social problem.
He said that another University
suggestion was to accept a Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford proposal
to begin a scholarship that would
give preference to medical students
who have served the gay community.

Although Ragland was "very
pleased with what they've done," he
said that their plans "just didn't send
me" because their proposal did not
do anything to promote discussion
and openness about homosexuality
"I'm for talking," he said. He wants
to "get people to discuss the reper
cussions of not discussing this for a
University dedicated to pursuing
truth and knowledge."
Ragland said that he does not plan
to keep trying to get Stanford to ac
cept the scholarship. He said that he
has offered the same scholarship to
12 other universities, many of which
are much closer to Florida. These will
therefore be easier to communicate
with, he said.
Ragland said that he had suggested
hiring some openly gay physicians
and professors in the medical
school.
The University has refused tor the
final time a $500 scholarship re
stricted to a male medical student
who openly declares his homosexu
ality, according to the potential
donor.
Robert Ragland, M.D., a psychia
trist from Florida, made his identity
known to the Daily by sending the
newspaper copies of his corre
spondences with University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy about the is
sue. The University had previously
refused to reveal the donor's name in
order to protect his privacy.
In a phone interview from his
Jacksonville home last night, Ragland
said that he received his $500 check
back from Stanford "some days ago"
and was "disappointed that they ha
ven't been able to discuss (the sub
ject)."
"They don't want to soil their
hands with it,"he said. "They are
keeping their distance from it like
sending a bomb."
"The whole point of the schol
arship was not to give money to gay
students," he said, "but to get the
issue—that they're not able to be
open—discussed, and get the cli
mate changed so people can be
open."
Ragland said that he prefers not to
use the term "homosexuality" be
cause he feels that it is used nega
tively in our society and is upsetting
to people when they hear it. In his
proposal to the University he de
scribed a homosexual as a person
"who has openly and publicly make
his gender affinity/preference man
ifest," because that description
"emphasizes his personhood."
Ragland characterized himselt as
"a person who has homosexual feel
ings."
Iris Brest, legal counsel here, said
yesterday that in several corre
spondences between Kennedy and
the potential donor, the president
had suggested various modifications
of the scholarship that would be ac
ceptable. These changes, however,

were not acceptable to the donor,
she said.
"There was never a suggestion that
the University was considering the
proposal and the donor never
suggested that he was interested in
changing it," she said
Brest said the University's position
has remained consistent all along
and reflects Kennedy's statement
during the KZSU Campus Confer
