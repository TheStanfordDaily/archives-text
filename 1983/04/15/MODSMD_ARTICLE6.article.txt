# Faculty Senate changes districting
## 
### FELICIA LEE Staff writer 
The School of Humanities and Sci
ences will lose two Faculty Senate
representatives next year due to
reapportionment changes approved
by the group yesterday.
The senate also discussed a propo
sal for rigorous new course require
ments for Human Biology majors.
Under the reapportionment,
which would make the body's mem
bership reflect the changing num
bers of students in the various
schools, the Schools of Engineering
and Medicine each will gain one rep
resentative while humanities and
sciences will lose two. The total

number of 53 senators remains un
changed.
According to the senate charter,
the number of senate members from
each school is determined by the
number of students and the number
of Academic Council members from
each school. The reapportionment
for this year would provide each
school with one senate representa
tive for every 502 students enrolled in
the school.
The senate approved the proposal,
but agreed not to implement the
changes until next year.
Currently, humanities and sci
ences has 25 senate seats, engineer
ing holds nine and medicine holds

eight.
A committee set up to review the
Human Biology program presented
seven recommendations for change
to the senate yesterday. Among the
changes proposed were the tighten
ing of course requirements for each
of the three concentrations of the
major and that the program become
more dependent upon course se
quences offered by other depart
ments.
Other changes have recently been
made in the program. According to
Prof. Richard Thompson, Human
Biology chairman, changes in the
course requirements were madr this
summer which "increase signifi
f antly the vigor of the program."
These changes, he said, include
the additional requirement of 20-25
units ot 'foundation-level courses"
in regular departments.
The immense popularity of the
program was cited as a reason tor the
proposed changes. According to
Thompson, the number ot students
majoring in Human Biology has in
t reased significantly in recent years.
In the 1979-1980 school year,
Thompson said, 144 students were
enrolled in the program, in 1981-1982
there were 365 students, and this
\eat the number of students in the
program rose to 403.
A controversy erupted during the
senate s discussion of the
Humanities Honors Program. Some
faculty members expressed concern
about a loophole which allows pre
medical students in the program to
tiSe their pre-medical courses to ful
fil requirements for their concentra
t on in the humanities.

Humanities Special Program
chairman Lawrence Ryan argued
against suggestions that require
ments for the Honors Program be
tightened. The "additional burden,"
he said, would discourage students
in the sciences from exploring the
humanities. He added that some of
the top students in the program in
the past have been pre-medical stu
dents.
Each year, he said, the honors
thesis which the taculty considers
the best is published, and on several
occasions, the published thesis had
been written by pre-medical stu
dents.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Norman Wessells warned against al
lowing pre-medical students to use
their science courses in the
humanities program, arguing that
pre-medical course demands are
"really not that heavy" and pre
medical students could still have
room in their schedules for extra
courses in the humanities.
Medical School Prof. Kenneth
Melmon agreed with Wessells, ad
ding that medical schools, contrary
to popular belief, welcome students
with backgrounds in the humanities.
