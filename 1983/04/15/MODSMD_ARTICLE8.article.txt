## Theme and co-op houses offer unique alternatives 
### BOB COHN Staff writer second in a series 
A sign near the entrance
reads "bienvenidos." lust in
side the door the visitor is
greeted by a host of painted
wall murals, a group of stu
dents discussing baseball and a
series of newspaper clippings
concerning Fl Salvador.
Around the corner a visitor
enters a large, lofty old house.
The distinct smell of baking
bread and strum of a guitar can
be detected from somewhere
beyond the foyer. Furniture,
clothing and storage boxes are
strewn rather casually, lending
a loose and comfortable at
mosphere to the surround
ings. Upstairs students live in
spacious co-ed rooms.
These subtle welcomings in
troduce the unsuspecting to
two of the more unique modes
of campus living — theme and
co-operative houses. As the
above descriptions of Casa
Zapata and Columbae show,
living in a theme or co-op
house can be a vastly different
— and for many, a better —
experience than traditional
campus residences.
The University offers cross
cultural houses in black,
Asian-American and
Mexican-A merican/Chicano
themes. Although other
houses, such as the French and
American Studies, are thematic
by nature, only Ujamaa, Okada
and Casa Zapata offer special
ethnic priority.
Residential Education's draw
guide describes theme houses
as "the educational experience
of residence life enriched by
the cross-cultural activities . . .
the experience of day-to-day
living in a cross-cultural house
broadens outlooks, creates
opportunities to form new
friendships, and encourages
an appreciation and under
standing of cultural

differences."
Eloisa Carrillo, j residential
assistant in Zapata, perceives
theme houses as "bringing
more awareness" to the cam
pus. Through activities such as
a Latin American film series,
guest panels and lectures on a
variety of topics, Carrillo hopes
Zapata can "bring to Stanford
something about the theme of
Chicanos."
Sophomore Todd
Weitzman, a resident of
Okada, said, "It (the theme)
makes you aware of different
perspectives and concerns.
There's no hostility and very lit
tle segregation" at Okada, lie
said.
Yet, as Weitzman noted,
much of the theme house
problems and controversy
stem from people who are
there not because they want to
be, but because they drew
poorly. "Very few Caucasians at
Stanford choose to be in a
theme house. I'm here be
cause I drew 4702. Still, it's not
so bad; it's an educational ex
perience . . . but one year is
enough."
Some residents of Zapata
feel that there is a hazy line of
tension separating "themers"
and the Caucasian residents. "I
think the themers — those who
are really 'into' the theme —
are a little cliquish," said one
freshman. "I sometimes feel
resentment, like if I walk into a
study room and it's all Mexi
cans. But that's because you'd
feel resentment if you walked
into any room filled with a
clique of friends," she said.
Another resident com
plained about the "spouting
political dogma" that charac
terizes house meetings. She
also said the majority of the
dorm dues go towards "Mexi
can functions. We (the non
themers) haven't used any of it.
"In fact there was a big de
bate at one house meeting

about whether to send all the
money to CI Salvador/' she
said. This divisive element —
"us" and "them" — does not
make for a totally harmonious
living situation.
And yet Carrillo does not
equate conflict with failure.
"Sometimes you need a little
bit of conflict to bring out is
sues, to learn things. I don't
like to put down conflict as
necessarily bad," she said.
Even those who find fault
with theme houses, and with

Zapata in particular, admit,
"It's not as bad as everyone
says it is. I have made some
really good friends ht-re."
Like theme houses, co-ops
are often politically and cultur
ally active residences which are
generally easy to draw into.
The University offers six co
operative houses through the
draw system: Columbae,
H a m m a r s k jo I d , Phi Psi,
Synergy, Terra and Theta Chi.
The draw book states that
"the common theme (of co

ops) is the idea that by sharing
in the full spectrum of house
activities, the members of the
house develop a greater sense
of community and commit
ment to each other. The
houses' members plan and
prepare all the menus, as well
as keep the houses clean and
manage their operation."
Many students opt for
co-ops precisely because of
this self-sufficiency. The fact
that co-ops offer substantially
cheaper room and board —

typically one-half the rate of
dormitories — is an additional
factor which favors co-op life.
"I guess the big thing (about
co-ops) is trying to be self
sufficient — doing our own
gardening, our own solar heat
ing, our own recycling and
composting our own food,"
said sophomore Doug
Macklin, a resident of Synergy.
Food composting is a unique
process at Synergy. Meal lef
tovers are fed to the house
chickens, who cluck around in
the backyard coop. The chick
ens, in turn, provide the house
with eggs. Whatever food is
still left is placed in a compost
bin. After a short period of time
this substance is spread over
the extensive backyard garden,
which in turn brings veggies
back to the plates of Synergy
diners.
"We end up eating it all
again," said Macklin. "It's a
cosmic cycle."
Like many of the other co
ops, Synergy offers primarily
vegetarian food, although
meat is available. "It's totally
self-run. We decide what we
want to eat and the menu man
ager makes sure the meal has
enough protein, and stuff like
that," said Macklin. Still, the
emphasis is on the organic.
Theta Chi, on the other
hand , lakes pride in its "variety
of menus" and more main
stream approach to living. "We
are unique among the co-op
genre: we are not 'PC' (politi
cally correct), we eat meat, and
we have lots of inorganic, pro
cessed foods," boasts their
draw book description. "Come
and meet the Cap'n for break
fast," it continues.
Like the theme houses,
some co-ops are not without
their political disputes.
Macklin related one house
meeting in which a member
urged the house to stop buying

bananas because the banana
industry was exploiting Latin
American farmers.
Another problem at many
co-ops has been the existence
of unsolicited, non-student
boarders, sometimes known as
"roofers." Although after
much debate Synergy recently
asked its roofers to leave, the
topic is one of much con
troversy in other co-ops as
well.
Yet students in co-ops, like
those across campus, rate their
housing very highly. "I just re
ally like the people. You know
everyone in the house very
well," Macklin said.
In response to cynics who
dismiss co-op housing as a
place for radicals and '60s hol
dovers, he insists, "The reputa
tion is entirely unjustified.
"The stereotype is the
granola-eating, pot-smoking,
long-haired freak. People here
don't fit the stereotype."
VVhv live in a theme or co-op
house? Some are simply ena
mored of that particular life
style. For others, the low cost
of co-ops and cultural diversity
of theme houses is attractive.
And for those who draw poorly
or are not guaranteed housing,
these options often represent
the student's sole chance of Iiv
ingon campus. In addition, the
opening of co-op housing to
graduate students next year
will provide the opportunity
for undergraduates and
graduates to live together.
But for some it's just the
people. Carrillo explained why
she returned to Zapata for a
second year. "I find a sense of
community here in terms of
people who come from similar
backgrounds. I don't have to
be your typical Stanford stu
dent here — there are people
here who are willing to accept
you as you are. You're not con
stantly trying to mold yourself
to what is 'Stanford.' "
