# Med Center opposes animal bill

The University Medical Center is
opposing a state senate bill designed
to prevent medical researchers from
conducting research on animals ob
tained from shelters and pounds.
The bill, which is strongly backed
by a number of animal-rights activist
groups, would prohibit shelters from
selling unclaimed impounded ani
mals to research institutions. In
stead, biomedical researchers would
have to obtain animals from breeders
who raise animals specifically for use
in research.
Medical Center officials said yes
terday the measure would severely
hamper biomedical research, in
crease research costs and result in
more animals being killed.
According to Lawrence Crowley,
vice president for medical affairs, the
legislation would "severely limit our
ability to use animals for biomedical
research."
Medical School Dean Dominick
Purpura agreed the bill would de
crease "tremendously" the amount
of research conducted here.
Researchers depend on animal ex
periments for vital information in at
tempts to cure diseases, Purpura
said. A prohibition against buying
impounded animals for research
purposes would result in a "major
decrease in the capacity to get new
information," he said.
Animal experiments are crucial for
research on "every aspect of the
kinds of diseases that affect man
kind," Purpura said. Animal subjects
are often used in the testing of new
operative procedures and new
drugs.
Advocates of the bilf claim that re
search institutions often subject
their animals to inhumane treat
ment, and that the pounds which sell
the animals do not try hard enough
to find the owners of the lost ani
mals. The sponsor of the bill, Sen.
David Roberti (D-Los Angeles), was
not available for comment yesterday.
The bill would make it very difficult
to obtain the animals necessary for
research, Crowley said. Biomedical
researchers would be forced to ac
quire animals from specialized
breeders, but genetically pure ani
mals are not always appropriate for
biomedical research, he said.
In addition, obtaining research
animals from breeders would cost
"at least twice as much" as current
methods, according to David Men
delow, associate dean for adminis
tration at the Medical School.
The bill is scheduled for a hearing
before the Senate judiciary Commit
tee tomorrow. Representatives from
Stanford and from other universities
around the state will present evi
dence against the measure.
