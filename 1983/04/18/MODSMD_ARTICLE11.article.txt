## The
						Stanford Daily Adelman and arms control 
### 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D.-Calif.) called last
Thursday's Senate confirmation of Kenneth
Adelman as director of the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency (ACDA) "a victory for the
enemies of arms control within the Reagan ad
ministration." We agree.
Adelman is poorly qualified for the post he
will assume as head of the agency responsible
for all U.S. arms negotiations; worse yet, his
commitment to such talks with the Soviet Union
seems poor at best.
Adelman's experience on arms control issues
is limited to his recent stint as deputy to jeane
Kirkpatrick, the U.S. delegate to the United Na
tions, where he was the delegation's "expert"
on arms control.
However, he spent his time at the United Na
tions accusing the Soviets of using chemical
warfare weapons in Indochina and Afghanistan.
Regardless of the validity of these allegations,
this is hardly the type of relationship one wishes
to start with future negotiating partners.
His primary qualifications, at least for Presi
dent Reagan, are apparently his views on the
administration's policies on rearmament and
the Soviet Union. He supports Reagan's arms
buildup and has shown himself a firm believer
in Reagan's view of the Soviet Union as the "evil

empire."
President Reagan's nomination of Adelman
leads us to question the arms tactics of the cur
rent administration. Adelman is perceived by
both friends and foes as being a less than fer
vent supporter of arms control. (He has al
legedly been quoted as calling such negotia
tions a "sham.") It is the perception of a figure
such as Adelman that counts more in the diplo
matic tug-of-war between the United States and
the Soviet Union than his actual views.
There is still hope for arms control, however.
Adelman and a host of administration officials,
including Secretary of State George Shultz,
have promised to continue working toward an
arms control agreement with the Soviet Union,
and Reagan has at least budged slightly on his
views and offered the so-called interim solution
in the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF)
talks with the Soviets.
We question Adelman's qualifications and
commitment. But signs such as the INF talks
give hope that the Reagan administration may
work seriously toward some form of arms
agreement with the Soviets, and that Adelman's
appointment does not signal further curtailing
of negotiations on the administration's part.
Otherwise, we are all in for a cold summer.
