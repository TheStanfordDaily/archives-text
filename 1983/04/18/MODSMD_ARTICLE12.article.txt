# Food is for people, not profit

People are starving in this world.
This is not only a well-known fact but
is apparently a widely understood
phenomenon as well. Popular expla
nations include over-population,
climatic conditions, "backward" ag
ricultural techniques and even
shiftlessness on the part of the Third
World farmer. Popular sentiment has
an almost Malthusian edge when it
characterizes hunger as a sad yet un
avoidable fact of nature.
The only reply to this set of beliefs
is that public opinion is often incor
rect. Many Third World countries
produceenough food fortheir popu
lations and still have hunger. India is
a good example. Other nations have
thriving cash crop exports as well as
countless numbers of people with lit
tle land, food or money. Many Latin
American countries, including El Sal
vador, fit this description.
A single word that goes far in ex
plaining both of these circumstances
is "inequality." Inequality of land
distribution is one of the foremost
contributors to world hunger today.
Four percent of the world's landow
ners control over half of the world's
cropland. In 83 of the poorest coun
tries, those with the severest hunger
problems, we find 3 percent of the
landowners controlling four-fifths of
the land. In many of these same
countries, between one-third and
one-half of the rural population
owns no land at all.
In agrarian societies, the amount
of land you own directly affects how
much money you make. Thus the in
equality of income ranges from In
dia, where the richest 10 percent re
ceive 35 percent of the income while
the poorest 20 percent get only 6
percent, to Brazil where the top 10
percent take in over one-half of the
income leaving the lowest 20 percent
with a paltry 3 percent.
The origins of present day in
equalities can be traced back to col
onial times. The economic structure
of colonialism was such that the col
ony produced raw materials or food
for the sole benefit of the mother
country. To implement this objec-

After the bad harvest, the self-provisioning farmer is
often forced to sell his land in order to buy already
expensive food (lower supply means higher prices)
so he and his family can survive the year. The effect
of this action is to increase the differences between
the rich and the poor. The large landholdings tend to
set larger, and the small ones tend to zero.

tive, the mother country would levy a
tax on the inhabitants of the colony.
The only way to pay this tax would be
to grow cash crops which the mother
country would purchase giving the
colonists hard currency that could be
used to pay their taxes. Thus the
central power extracts wealth, in the
form of gold, labor or cash crops, at
no cost to itself.
This form of economic system
necessitated the consolidation of
land holdings and conversion of
food grain growing land to cash crop
(i.e. indigo, tobacco, coffee, cotton,
tea, peanuts, etc.) land.
When independence was attained
in many of these colonies, the land
holdings often remained stable. The
control of the land passed from the
colonial power to the new upper
class of the independent nation. Un
less explicit and extensive land re

form measures were taken, the di'j
tribution of land . hanged little in the
transition.
The implications of this are tre
mendous. After bad harvests, the
self-provisioning farmer is otten
forced to sell his land in order to buy
already expensive food (lower sup
ply means higher prices) so he and
his family can survive the year. The
effect of this action is to increase the
difference between the rich and the
poor. The large landholdings tend to
get larger, and the small ones tend to
zero.

A single word that goes far in explaining both of
these circumstances is 'inequality/ Inequality of
land distribution is one of the foremost contributors
to world hunger today.

In addition to increasing maldis
tribution, the present economic
structure encourages the large
land owner to grow less food grain.
It makes good "economic sense" for
him to grow more exportable cash
crops that bring in capital which he
can reinvest in his farm. The modern
multi-national corporation takes the
place of colonial power in transfer
ring raw materials out of a less
developed country in return for ex
pensive "value-added" goods: all of
which in no way helps the peasant
farmer.
The industrial West, of course, has
taken a differing view of hunger. We
tend to see it as basically a problem
of "under-development." As such,
our efforts to remedy the problem
have concentrated on two programs:
zero population growth and the
"Green Revolution."
The Green Revolution is an at
tempt to teach American farming
techniques (i.e. chemical fertilizers,
machinery, irrigation, etc.) to the
Third World. However noble the in
tentions behind these efforts, they
have had devastating effects.
First, a replacement of labor-

intensive farming with capital
intensive farming requires the dis
placement of countless laborers; this
refers to not only farm workers but to
farm owners as well. Western-style
farming is inefficient on small plots.
Small farms must be consolidated
before the new techniques can be
used. More often than not, this re
sults in pauperizing the small farmer
and significantly, and suddenly, ad
ding to the city dwelling (often un
employed) proletariat.
This result may be a welcome
change for multi-national corpora
tions desiring cheap labor, but as a
reform measure, the westernizing of
farming will only amplify the present
negatives.
A second argument against
capital-intensive (energy-intensive)
farming is more immediate and
doesn't rely on any ethical consid

erations. Put simply, energy
inte.isive farming is not a viable op
tion for the world. Our agricultural
system needs 1400 liters of oil per
American per year. If we were to at
tempt to feed the world using our
methods, we would deplete all
known oil reserves in only 11 years.
Barring the sudden (very sudden)
development of fusion energy or
practical solar power, energy
intensive agriculture for everyone is
an impossibility.
Why, then, does the West refuse
to encourage structural economic

and land reform in the Third World?
A look at the benefits we receive
from the existing set-up is helpful in
finding an answer. The United
States, with only 6 percent of the
world's population, consumes 35
percent of the world's energy re
sources. An argument used against
these figures invokes the concept of
comparative advantage. Because we
are best at producing energy
intensive goods, we produce more
goods than we need so that others
can have them. Ifthisargumentwere
valid, then why does the industri
alized or "developed" or "First"
world (with only 25 percent of the
world's population) consume two
thirds of all the globe's food? Why do
First World animals alone eat one
third of all the world's supply of
grain?
Perhaps the reason we are unwil
ling to promote land reform (we're
even repressing it in El Salvador) is
because we are unwilling to accept
the economic ramifications of such a
policy; that is, the weakening of our
dominating status. The same struc
tural changes that bring equity and
security to hundreds of millions of
Third World peasants will also cut
into multi-national corporation prof
its and result in a lowered standard of
living for the West. We make at
tempts to slow population growth
because large numbers of hungry,
angry people are potentially de
stabilizing to the world economic
order. Population will stabilize, as it
did in the West, when large numbers
of offspring are no longer needed for
economic security.
We must come to the realization
that only the eradication of poverty
through equality will ever bring real
' security to this world. This view is not
turning its back on science and de
velopment. Instead of using the
American method of dumping piles
of chemicals in the ground and using
energy inefficient machines to har
vest our food, we must take a step
further in technology and learn to
co-exist with the natural environ
ment rather than conquer it. Our
methods of farming are leading to
the slow poisoning of our bodies and
the erosion of our topsoil. We are
certainly a poor example for the
Third World to emulate. Long-term
existence is only possible when the
root causes of discord, both man
versus man and man versus envi
ronment, are eliminated.
