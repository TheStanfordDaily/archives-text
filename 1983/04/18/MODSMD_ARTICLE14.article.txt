## Students, tests and honor 
### 
Hypocrisy is a rather unkind word, but unfortunately it
was the first word that popped into my mind while listen
ing to a recent lunchtime discussion. The topic con
cerned the action taken against a chemistry professor,
who was accused of consistently employing teaching
assistants to proctor exams, in addition to taking other
"unreasonable" examination precautions. The general
consensus was that the chemistry professor in particular
and the Chemistry Department in general finally got
what they deserved.
At no time, however, was the subject of student re
sponsibility for the affair addressed. To my way of think
ing, the picture of the evil, proctoring professor oppres
sing his 200 angelic students just doesn't wash. The
double standard which pervades student attitudes con
cerning the Honor Code is damaging to the letter and
spirit, in addition to being slightly hypocritical. Students
should clean up their own act before complainingabout
faculty violations of the Honor Code.
Of course, the Chemistry Department is notorious for
proctoring tests. The standard justification that TAs are
in the room only to answer questions is somewhat
specious; after all, they can just as easily answer the ques
tions in the auditorium foyer that they currently answer
in the auditorium itself. Whether or not this particular
professor is guilty of proctoring is beside the point,
because if he doesn't, there are plenty of his colleagues
who do. I've taken seven classes from the Chemistry
Department, and in every exam there has been a slurry
of teaching assistants present, scanning the auditorium.
Other departments, of course, are not immune to the
proctoring syndrome, with introductory biology and
physics classes being notable examples. Viewed in this
light, action taken against a single professor is somewhat
analogous to a little boy stopping a leaky dam with his
finger while the floodgates are open nearby.
The blame for proctoring, however, lies with the stu
dents, not the faculty. By not accepting the responsibil
ity which accompanies the Honor Code, students are
almost forcing the faculty to take countermeasures in
certain instances. A few cases in point:
• In a recent chemistry final taken in Memorial Au
ditorium, a student in one of the first five rows got up,
with his chemistry book, with his exam and walked out
of the auditorium. Ten minutes later, still carrying his
book and exam, he calmly walked the length of Mem
Aud to take his seat in the fifth row. Not one student,
during or after the exam, reported this rather suspicious
behavior.
• In a human biology midterm, given at two different
times for convenience, two students signed out tests for
the early exam under fictitious names. They came back

and took the same exam at the later time, which gave
them a few hours in between to figure out the correct
answers. A TA handing out the exams tentatively iden
tified one student, but no students with any knowledge
of the impropriety have volunteered any information.
• I talked with a chemistry professor (not Prof, lames
Collman) who admitted that TAs remained in the exam
room to discourge cheating. The professor was quick to
point out, however, that "I get unsigned notes every
year, complaining that so-and-so is cheating during
exams. If no one is going to come forward, what else can
I do?"

Nobody likes to play policeman, but
students must actively uphold and en
force the standards of the Honor Code
or the entire system falls apart.

This is a very legitimate problem, and the only solution
is for students, not just the faculty, to shoulder the
burden to actively uphold and enforce the standards of
the Honor Code. This requires a fundamental change in
attitude among the student population, from passive
acceptance of the state of the Honor Code as it exists
today, to an active dedication for the creation of a com
pletely honest and honorable academic atmosphere
which the Honor Code was meant to provide. The
Honor Code isn't self-enforcing, and when any violation
occurs, whether it is exam cheating, faking lab data,
whatever, students themselves must see to it that the
violations are stopped. Nobody likes to play policeman,
but students must actively uphold and enforce the stan
dardsof the HonorCodeortheentiresystem fallsapart.
Faculty proctoring is a problem, but it is a problem that
was created by students, one which can only be solved
when students are ready to come forward and accept
their responsibilities which are inherent under the
Honor Code. Complaints against the faculty may suc
ceed in removing the nuisance of proctoring during
exams, but this won't remove the underlying cause, a
lack of dedication to the Honor Code on the part of the
students. Ultimate elimination of the underlying cause
of proctoring remains the responsibility of the student
population.
