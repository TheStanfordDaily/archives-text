# Civil rights activism, investment skill: trustee brings new perspective
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
W. James Ware is obviously a
regular at 42nd Street, a fashiona
ble restaurant and bar just a five
minute walk from his law office.
As the newest Stanford board of
trustees member entered the res
taurant, the manager apologized.
"I'm sorry, Jim, it will be about a
10-minute wait."
But within five minutes, Ware
and his seated, served
club soda, and their orders had
been taken. Ware joked about the
prompt service, "They just want
me to come here more often . . .
they want my money."
Though he wouldn't be quick to
make an issue of it, Ware has ar
rived: arrived at professional suc
cess with Blase, Valentine and
Klein, a prestigious law firm, at
social acceptance in the suburb of
Mountain View, at personal suc
cess with his wife, two young
children and a Scout troop, at ma
terial success complete with a
house, station wagon, Porsche
and sailboat.
At first glance, Ware seems
much too young to have achieved
so much; he is slightly out of place
in his pin-striped suit. He looks
college-age, maybe not even an
upperclassman. But his eyes ex
press maturity.

Currently the board's only
black member — there have been
two others — Ware has taken
stands on undergraduate educa
tion, affirmative action, proxy vot
ing, East Palo Alto and defense
related research at Stanford.
Hisviewof the board of trustees
— which functions much like a
corporate board of directors —
does not differ appreciably from
that of other trustees. He de
scribed the board's role with
terms like "fiduciary," "long
range planning" and "apolitical."
Provost Albert Hastorf said of
Ware's first meeting, "He spoke
several times with consummate
skill."
Ware, 36, has had many previ
ous contacts with the University.
Since he graduated from the Law
School in 1972, Ware has taught
two courses sponsored by Stan
ford Workshops on Social and
Political Issues (SWOPSI) and
served as an alumni member of
the Stanford Committee on In
vestment Responsibility.
In 1978, he applied for an
alumni trustee position, but was
not elected by the alumni. His
current seat is not one of those
reserved for trustees elected by
alumni.

Ware said he feels he will con
tribute to the board most in the
area of investment, a field he
deals with in his law practice. He
supported the trustees' recent
move to streamline the proxy vot
ing process by severely limiting
the number of corporate proxy
votes the board will cast in areas
of societal import.
"The issue is not whether or not
to vote," said Ware. "We tried to


W. James Ware
clarify Stanford's own goal. We
did not feel that the trustees
should use the vote in a political
sense, but simply to make sure
that Stanford is not engaged in
causing substantial harm to soci
ety."
But while Ware's goal of serving
Stanford may be shared by many,
his manner of doing so may be
unique. It is largely a function of
the atypical path he has taken to
reach his current position.
Ware was raised in segregated
Birmingham, Alabama. His father
was a coal miner. Ware said he
had no sense at first that the Ala
bama system was oppressive. "It
was home, hot summers, bare
feet, good friends," Ware said. "It
took me a long time to realize that
I was black."
That realization came during
the height of the civil rights

movement and it came hard. One
day when Ware was a sophomore
in high school, he gave his
brother a ride on the handlebars
of his bike.
Two white boys jumped out and
shot at them. Ware's brother was
killed. The white boy who Ware
said fired the shot was acquitted.
"It was a violent time for my
family," Ware said. Around the
same time, the 16th St. Baptist
Church in Ware's town was
bombed. His minister was beaten
with chains.
After this string of events, the
young man became involved in
the civil rights struggle. He was
sprayed with firehoses by police
officers, arrested and jailed. "It
was exhilarating . . . just being ar
rested," Ware said. "What was
ironic was that they took us to the
county fairgrounds, which were
segregated, after we had been ar
rested. I had never been to the
county fair until I was arrested."
After this, Ware went to Los

Angeles to visit his sister. In
California he landed a work-study
job with the Westminster Neigh
borhood Association, a commu
nity help group serving the Los
Angeles ghetto of Watts. While
working for the neighborhood
group, Ware became embroiled
in the notorious Watts riot, and
delivered food to poor families
during the seven days that the Los
Angeles Police cordoned off the
Watts area to keep the upheaval
from spreading.
"There was a lot of bitterness,"
Ware remembered. "That has
slowly subsided and given me a
resolve to go beyond that kind of
hatred."
Ware said, however, that he
feels his experiences with racism
enhance the outlook which he
brings to the board. "I would like
to bring a different perspective, a
different background to the
board," Ware said. "I'm sensitive
to civil rights, to affirmative ac
tion, more sensitive than others
might be . . . not to say that

they re not.
According to Ware, the Univer
sity should take a more active role
in ministering to the problems of
1 ast Palo Alto, though he cited
past Law School and Business
School clinics in East Palo Alto as
positive efforts. "There ought to
be a concerted effort by Stanford
to break through that kind of bar
rier. That kind of barrier follows
one throughout life." Crossing
Ihe barrier is enlightenment,
Ware said.
Ware worked all through high
school to "amass a war chest for
college." As a student at Califor
nia Lutheran College, he filled a
disc jockey slot at a local radio sta
tion.
While studying at the Law
School, he "worked everywhere"
at almost everything. During his
three years here, Ware worked as
a resident assistant and in Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
The trustee attributes his drive
to his parents. "It was the con

stant admonishment — although
that's too fancy a word for my
father — of my parents, especially
myfather,"said Ware. "Education
was very important, and since we
didn't have money, I worked."
When Ware graduated, he
joined the Palo Alto law firm of
Blase, Valentine and Klein. Now a
partner in the firm, Ware has also
been involved in various Univer
sity and community service
groups.
Ware said he feels politics have
no place on the board of trustees.
"I don't believe the board can be
political. The job of the board is to
create an open university so that
everyone can be political."
Though unique experiences
have shaped his views, Ware said
he usually tries to keep the details
of his background separate from
his professional life. "I don't
make a lot of it because it often
evokes sympathy," said Ware.
"But sympathy is not something
that spurs action. I don't want
sympathy, I want respect."

alumni trustee position, but was
not elected by the alumni. His
current seat is not one of those
reserved for trustees elected by
alumni.

Ware said he feels he will con
tribute to the board most in the
area of investment, a field he
deals with in his law practice. He
supported the trustees' recent
move to streamline the proxy vot
ing process by severely limiting
the number of corporate proxy
votes the board will cast in areas
of societal import.
"The issue is not whether or not
to vote," said Ware. "We tried to


W. James Ware
clarify Stanford's own goal. We
did not feel that the trustees
should use the vote in a political
sense, but simply to make sure
that Stanford is not engaged in
causing substantial harm to soci
ety."
But while Ware's goal of serving
Stanford may be shared by many,
his manner of doing so may be
unique. It is largely a function of
the atypical path he has taken to
reach his current position.
Ware was raised in segregated
Birmingham, Alabama. His father
was a coal miner. Ware said he
had no sense at first that the Ala
bama system was oppressive. "It
was home, hot summers, bare
feet, good friends," Ware said. "It
took me a long time to realize that
I was black."
That realization came during
the height of the civil rights

movement and it came hard. One
day when Ware was a sophomore
in high school, he gave his
brother a ride on the handlebars
of his bike.
Two white boys jumped out and
shot at them. Ware's brother was
killed. The white boy who Ware
said fired the shot was acquitted.
"It was a violent time for my
family," Ware said. Around the
same time, the 16th St. Baptist
Church in Ware's town was
bombed. His minister was beaten
with chains.
After this string of events, the
young man became involved in
the civil rights struggle. He was
sprayed with firehoses by police
officers, arrested and jailed. "It
was exhilarating . . . just being ar
rested," Ware said. "What was
ironic was that they took us to the
county fairgrounds, which were
segregated, after we had been ar
rested. I had never been to the
county fair until I was arrested."
After this, Ware went to Los

Angeles to visit his sister. In
California he landed a work-study
job with the Westminster Neigh
borhood Association, a commu
nity help group serving the Los
Angeles ghetto of Watts. While
working for the neighborhood
group, Ware became embroiled
in the notorious Watts riot, and
delivered food to poor families
during the seven days that the Los
Angeles Police cordoned off the
Watts area to keep the upheaval
from spreading.
"There was a lot of bitterness,"
Ware remembered. "That has
slowly subsided and given me a
resolve to go beyond that kind of
hatred."
Ware said, however, that he
feels his experiences with racism
enhance the outlook which he
brings to the board. "I would like
to bring a different perspective, a
different background to the
board," Ware said. "I'm sensitive
to civil rights, to affirmative ac
tion, more sensitive than others
might be . . . not to say that

they re not.
According to Ware, the Univer
sity should take a more active role
in ministering to the problems of
1 ast Palo Alto, though he cited
past Law School and Business
School clinics in East Palo Alto as
positive efforts. "There ought to
be a concerted effort by Stanford
to break through that kind of bar
rier. That kind of barrier follows
one throughout life." Crossing
Ihe barrier is enlightenment,
Ware said.
Ware worked all through high
school to "amass a war chest for
college." As a student at Califor
nia Lutheran College, he filled a
disc jockey slot at a local radio sta
tion.
While studying at the Law
School, he "worked everywhere"
at almost everything. During his
three years here, Ware worked as
a resident assistant and in Meyer
Undergraduate Library.
The trustee attributes his drive
to his parents. "It was the con

stant admonishment — although
that's too fancy a word for my
father — of my parents, especially
myfather,"said Ware. "Education
was very important, and since we
didn't have money, I worked."
When Ware graduated, he
joined the Palo Alto law firm of
Blase, Valentine and Klein. Now a
partner in the firm, Ware has also
been involved in various Univer
sity and community service
groups.
Ware said he feels politics have
no place on the board of trustees.
"I don't believe the board can be
political. The job of the board is to
create an open university so that
everyone can be political."
Though unique experiences
have shaped his views, Ware said
he usually tries to keep the details
of his background separate from
his professional life. "I don't
make a lot of it because it often
evokes sympathy," said Ware.
"But sympathy is not something
that spurs action. I don't want
sympathy, I want respect."
W. James Ware is obviously a
regular at 42nd Street, a fashiona
ble restaurant and bar just a five
minute walk from his law office.
As the newest Stanford board of
trustees member entered the res
taurant, the manager apologized.
"I'm sorry, Jim, it will be about a
10-minute wait."
But within five minutes, Ware
and his seated, served
club soda, and their orders had
been taken. Ware joked about the
prompt service, "They just want
me to come here more often . . .
they want my money."
Though he wouldn't be quick to
make an issue of it, Ware has ar
rived: arrived at professional suc
cess with Blase, Valentine and
Klein, a prestigious law firm, at
social acceptance in the suburb of
Mountain View, at personal suc
cess with his wife, two young
children and a Scout troop, at ma
terial success complete with a
house, station wagon, Porsche
and sailboat.
At first glance, Ware seems
much too young to have achieved
so much; he is slightly out of place
in his pin-striped suit. He looks
college-age, maybe not even an
upperclassman. But his eyes ex
press maturity.

Currently the board's only
black member — there have been
two others — Ware has taken
stands on undergraduate educa
tion, affirmative action, proxy vot
ing, East Palo Alto and defense
related research at Stanford.
Hisviewof the board of trustees
— which functions much like a
corporate board of directors —
does not differ appreciably from
that of other trustees. He de
scribed the board's role with
terms like "fiduciary," "long
range planning" and "apolitical."
Provost Albert Hastorf said of
Ware's first meeting, "He spoke
several times with consummate
skill."
Ware, 36, has had many previ
ous contacts with the University.
Since he graduated from the Law
School in 1972, Ware has taught
two courses sponsored by Stan
ford Workshops on Social and
Political Issues (SWOPSI) and
served as an alumni member of
the Stanford Committee on In
vestment Responsibility.
