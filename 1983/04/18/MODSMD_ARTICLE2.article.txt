# Civil rights activism, investment skill: trustee brings new perspective

### HEATHER MILLAR 
W. James Ware is obviously a
regular at 42nd Street, a fashiona
ble restaurant and bar just a five
minute walk from his law office.
As the newest Stanford board of
trustees member entered the res
taurant, the manager apologized.
"I'm sorry, Jim, it will be about a
10-minute wait."
But within five minutes, Ware
and his seated, served
club soda, and their orders had
been taken. Ware joked about the
prompt service, "They just want
me to come here more often . . .
they want my money."
Though he wouldn't be quick to
make an issue of it, Ware has ar
rived: arrived at professional suc
cess with Blase, Valentine and
Klein, a prestigious law firm, at
social acceptance in the suburb of
Mountain View, at personal suc
cess with his wife, two young
children and a Scout troop, at ma
terial success complete with a
house, station wagon, Porsche
and sailboat.
At first glance, Ware seems
much too young to have achieved
so much; he is slightly out of place
in his pin-striped suit. He looks
college-age, maybe not even an
upperclassman. But his eyes ex
press maturity.

Currently the board's only
black member — there have been
two others — Ware has taken
stands on undergraduate educa
tion, affirmative action, proxy vot
ing, East Palo Alto and defense
related research at Stanford.
Hisviewof the board of trustees
— which functions much like a
corporate board of directors —
does not differ appreciably from
that of other trustees. He de
scribed the board's role with
terms like "fiduciary," "long
range planning" and "apolitical."
Provost Albert Hastorf said of
Ware's first meeting, "He spoke
several times with consummate
skill."
Ware, 36, has had many previ
ous contacts with the University.
Since he graduated from the Law
School in 1972, Ware has taught
two courses sponsored by Stan
ford Workshops on Social and
Political Issues (SWOPSI) and
served as an alumni member of
the Stanford Committee on In
vestment Responsibility.
In 1978, he applied for an
alumni trustee position, but was
not elected by the alumni. His
current seat is not one of those
reserved for trustees elected by
alumni.

Ware said he feels he will con
tribute to the board most in the
area of investment, a field he
deals with in his law practice. He
supported the trustees' recent
move to streamline the proxy vot
ing process by severely limiting
the number of corporate proxy
votes the board will cast in areas
of societal import.
"The issue is not whether or not
to vote," said Ware. "We tried to
