## Stanford batters USC, UCLA tennis teams 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
The Stanford men's tennis team con
tinued to roll this weekend by squeaking
past UCLA 5-4 in a contest decided in the
last match Saturday night when the No. 1
doubles team of Scott Davis and )ohn Letts
pulled out a three-set victory in front of
3500 in Maples Pavilion.
On Friday, the Cardinal blew out USC
6-2 in a match that was not as close as the
score indicates. Stanford wrapped up the
victory early by winning five of the six sing
les contests.
The pair of victories over No. 4-ranked
USC and No. 5-rated UCLA establish the
Cardinal netters as legitimate contenders
for the national team championships to be
held next month in Athens, Ga.
The wins also put Stanford on top of the
Pac-6 league with a 7-0 mark and ran the
team's dual match win streak to 15.
"I think we got through a big hurdle. I'm
really encouraged by our performance,"
said Stanford coach Dick Could.
On the strength of the weekend vic
tories, the currently sixth-ranked Cardinal
stands a chance to move up in the polls,
maybe as high as fourth in the nation.
Could said the victories will give his
team more respect on the national scene.
"I think we've proved that we're a real
factor. Now the word's out: Hey, watch
out for Stanford.' "
Gould was also pleased the way his
young team, with four freshmen in the
starting six, has improved throughout the
season. "If you had told me a month ago

that we were going to beat USC and UCLA,
I would have thought you were crazy."
Although coming into the weekend
series the Cardinal had some question
marks in its lineup — Davis, who has not
yet fully recovered from mononucleosis
and freshmen Dan Goldie, who had been
suffering from a sore elbow — the team
ended up being hurt less by injuries than
its opponents.
On Friday, the Trojans played without
the services of No. 2 Jorge Lazano and on
Saturday the Bruins did not play No. 1
Danny Saltz and No. 4 john Davis.
Davis at No. 1 impressively defeated the
Trojan's Matt Anger on Friday but lost to
the Bruin's Jeff Klaparda a day later in a
minor upset that would have a major one
had Davis been completely healthy.
However, even in his win over Anger, it
was clear by Davis' subdued style of play —
far different than his normal serve and vol
ley power game — that he wasn't fully
healthy.
He's not anywhere near in shape,"
Gould said. "I was just pleased that he was
able to play in all four matches."
Goldie, at No. 3 singles, looked healthy
in both of his wins.
The most consistent performanceof the
two-match series for the Cardinal came
from No. 6 singles player Jim Crabb, who
racked up two wins in singles and com
bined with team captain Mark McKeen for
a crucial No. 2 doubles victory against the
Bruins.
At the time of the win in Maples Pavilion,

the Bruins had taken a 4-3 lead over (he
Cardinal on the strength of Klaparda's
upset and they needed onh one more vic
tory to clinch the match.
fhe turning point in that match came in
the first set when the Cardinal, leading 3-2
in the set, broke the Bruins' serve on a
cross-court forehand return that McKeen
hit tor a winner. After that the Cardinal
finished off the Bruin team easily.

beat their opponents 6-2, 7-5 in the match
against UCLA. Overall, the Card came out
ahead of the Trojans 6-2, and beat the Bruins
5-4.
The Stanford men's tennis team con
tinued to roll this weekend by squeaking
past UCLA 5-4 in a contest decided in the
last match Saturday night when the No. 1
doubles team of Scott Davis and )ohn Letts
pulled out a three-set victory in front of
3500 in Maples Pavilion.
On Friday, the Cardinal blew out USC
6-2 in a match that was not as close as the
score indicates. Stanford wrapped up the
victory early by winning five of the six sing
les contests.
The pair of victories over No. 4-ranked
USC and No. 5-rated UCLA establish the
Cardinal netters as legitimate contenders
for the national team championships to be
held next month in Athens, Ga.
The wins also put Stanford on top of the
Pac-6 league with a 7-0 mark and ran the
team's dual match win streak to 15.
"I think we got through a big hurdle. I'm
really encouraged by our performance,"
said Stanford coach Dick Could.
On the strength of the weekend vic
tories, the currently sixth-ranked Cardinal
stands a chance to move up in the polls,
maybe as high as fourth in the nation.
Could said the victories will give his
team more respect on the national scene.
"I think we've proved that we're a real
factor. Now the word's out: Hey, watch
out for Stanford.' "
Gould was also pleased the way his
young team, with four freshmen in the
starting six, has improved throughout the
season. "If you had told me a month ago

that we were going to beat USC and UCLA,
I would have thought you were crazy."
Although coming into the weekend
series the Cardinal had some question
marks in its lineup — Davis, who has not
yet fully recovered from mononucleosis
and freshmen Dan Goldie, who had been
suffering from a sore elbow — the team
ended up being hurt less by injuries than
its opponents.
On Friday, the Trojans played without
the services of No. 2 Jorge Lazano and on
Saturday the Bruins did not play No. 1
Danny Saltz and No. 4 john Davis.
Davis at No. 1 impressively defeated the
Trojan's Matt Anger on Friday but lost to
the Bruin's Jeff Klaparda a day later in a
minor upset that would have a major one
had Davis been completely healthy.
However, even in his win over Anger, it
was clear by Davis' subdued style of play —
far different than his normal serve and vol
ley power game — that he wasn't fully
healthy.
He's not anywhere near in shape,"
Gould said. "I was just pleased that he was
able to play in all four matches."
Goldie, at No. 3 singles, looked healthy
in both of his wins.
The most consistent performanceof the
two-match series for the Cardinal came
from No. 6 singles player Jim Crabb, who
racked up two wins in singles and com
bined with team captain Mark McKeen for
