# Bruins barely beat netwomen
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Women's tennis fans were
treated to tennis' version of a
come-from-behind victory
yesterday in Stanford's match
with the UCLA Bruins here.
Stanford, unfortunately for
the nearly 1000 in attendence,
didn't do the treating.
The Cardinal held a 4-2 ad
vantage after the singles por
tion of the match and needed a
win in just one of the three
doubles contests to nail down
the team victory. They didn't
get it.
Fourth-ranked UCLA swept
the doubles and, with its pair of
singles wins, recorded a 5-4 up
set win over a Stanford team
ranked secondorthird, depen
ding on which poll you listen
to.
The contest was a re-match
of last year's NCAA Cham
pionships final in Salt Lake City,
which Stanford won 6-3.
Just as things were looking
good for Stanford yesterday,
they turned sour. Not only was
the Cardinal ahead 4-2 afterthe
singles, but two of UCLA'S
three doubles teams had never
played together before.
The doubles started and im
mediately the Card's No. 1 and
No. 2 teams began losing —
and losing badly.
At No. 1, the previously un
defeated pair of Elise Burgin
and Linda Gates found them
selves quickly behind 4-0 while
Caryn Copeland and Michelle
Weiss lost their first set 6-1. At
No. 3, Alison Hardey and Jackie
Joseph lost a tough first set 6-4.
Copeland/Weiss came back
to win the second set 6-2, but
dropped the third 6-4. A few
moments earlier,
Joseph/Hardey had lost their
match 6-4, 6-4.
That tied the team score at
4-4 and left the match up to
Burgin/Gates, who at the time
were serving at 3-4 in the sec
ond set, having lost the first in a
tiebreaker. The Bruin team of
Barbara Gerken and Heather
Ludloff broke serve and then
held at 5-3 to record the 7-6
(7-5), 6-3 victory.
Although the loss dropped
the Card to 16-3 overall and 8-2
in the WCAA, it more im
portantly set up Stanford's May
7 match with UCLA (16-4 and
7-1) in Westwood as the key
match of the regular season for
both teams.
Stanford was on the favor
able end of a 5-4 score against
UCLA a month ago at the Na
tional Indoor Championships
in Ann Arbor, Mich., making
the Bruins' win yesterday the
equalizer in the teams' series
this season.
Unless the Card beats USC in
two weeks or loses to San Die
go State May 6, the winner of
the upcoming Stanford-UCLA
contest will be the No. 3 seed at
the NCAA Championships in

Albuquerque, N.M., May
14-22. Barring a major upset,
Trinity will be seeded second
behind No. 1 ranked USC.
The importance of being
seeded second or third at
Albuquerque is simple — you
don't have to face USC until
the finals. The way the tour
nament ladder is set up, the
first and fourth seeds ideally
meet in the semi-finals.
And although Stanford
coach Frank Brennan doesn't
think the Trojans are as domi
nant as they have been in the
past, they are nonetheless un
defeated, including a pair of
wins over both UCLA and Stan
ford.
Had Brennan and company
prevailed yesterday, they
would have for all practical
purposes sewn up at least a No.
3 seeding at Albuquerque.
"I'm very pleased with the
singles," Brennan said of yes
terday's match. "And actually,
I'm not too disappointed with
the doubles."
Each team was without one
of its top singles players. The
Card was missing No. 4 netter
and team captain Copeland,
ranked 37th nationally, who
was still suffering from a bout
with bronchitis and only
played doubles. Penny Barg,
the Bruins' No. 3 netter, played
neither singles nor doubles.
Burgin, a junior, remained
undefeated as the nation's No.
1 ranked collegiate player with
a 6-4, 7-6 (9-7) victory over
Bruin Ludloff, a senior.
"Elise Burgin has been hav
ing problems with her knee,"

Brennan said. "But she was
good enough to win."
That she was. Despite miss
ing most of her first serves and
lobbing poorly, Burgin man
aged to break open a close first
set with a service break in the
seven game, putting her ahead
to stay at 4-3.
In the second set, however,
Burgin found herself down 4-5
to Ludloff, who has one of the
best net games in the college
ranks. The two players traded
games and Burgin held in the
12th game to tie it at six apiece.
Burgin squandered two
match points in the tiebreaker
before she won the set and the
match on a spectacular fore
hand winner down the lineand
just past Ludloff's outstretched
racquet.
But the afternoon belonged
to Burgin's understudy, No. 2
Gates. The Card sophomore
upset the freshman Gerken,
UCLA's usual No. 1 player and a
quarter-finalist in last year's
U.S. Open.
Gates broke Gerken early
and held on for a 6-4 first set
win. Hitting winners like they

were going out of style, Gates
blasted Gerken in the second
6-0, prompting Brennan to call
it"the match of her life."
At No. 3 singles, Alyce
Werdel's meticulous baseline
game proved too much for
UCLA's Andrea Kriva to the
tune of a 6-1, 6-4 win.
Stanford lost at No. 4 and No.
5, but super-sub Alison Hard
ey, filling in for Copeland,
handily defeated Karin
Huebner 6-4, 6-1 at No. 6.
"She played a good clutch
match," Brennan said. "She's
such a super, super athlete."
The Cardinal travels south to
Ojai, Calif., later this week for
the Ojai Intercollegiates, a
series of individual singles and
doubles tournaments.
Brennan said Burgin would
not make the trip so she could
fully recover from the knee in
jury that has been nagging her
recently.
The following week, Stan
ford takes on UC-Berkely
Wednesday, Pepperdine Fri
day and No. 1 USC Saturday in
three home matches at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.


Sophomore Linda Gates played what Stan
ford coach Frank Brennan called "the match
of her life" yesterday and beat UCLA

Greg Webb/Daily
freshman Barbara Gerken 6-4, 6-0. II wasn't
enough for the Cardinal, though, and Stan
ford lost the team battle to the Bruins 5-4.

behind No. 1 ranked USC.
The importance of being
seeded second or third at
Albuquerque is simple — you
don't have to face USC until
the finals. The way the tour
nament ladder is set up, the
first and fourth seeds ideally
meet in the semi-finals.
And although Stanford
coach Frank Brennan doesn't
think the Trojans are as domi
nant as they have been in the
past, they are nonetheless un
defeated, including a pair of
wins over both UCLA and Stan
ford.
Had Brennan and company
prevailed yesterday, they
would have for all practical
purposes sewn up at least a No.
3 seeding at Albuquerque.
"I'm very pleased with the
singles," Brennan said of yes
terday's match. "And actually,
I'm not too disappointed with
the doubles."
Each team was without one
of its top singles players. The
Card was missing No. 4 netter
and team captain Copeland,
ranked 37th nationally, who
was still suffering from a bout
with bronchitis and only
played doubles. Penny Barg,
the Bruins' No. 3 netter, played
neither singles nor doubles.
Burgin, a junior, remained
undefeated as the nation's No.
1 ranked collegiate player with
a 6-4, 7-6 (9-7) victory over
Bruin Ludloff, a senior.
"Elise Burgin has been hav
ing problems with her knee,"

Brennan said. "But she was
good enough to win."
That she was. Despite miss
ing most of her first serves and
lobbing poorly, Burgin man
aged to break open a close first
set with a service break in the
seven game, putting her ahead
to stay at 4-3.
In the second set, however,
Burgin found herself down 4-5
to Ludloff, who has one of the
best net games in the college
ranks. The two players traded
games and Burgin held in the
12th game to tie it at six apiece.
Burgin squandered two
match points in the tiebreaker
before she won the set and the
match on a spectacular fore
hand winner down the lineand
just past Ludloff's outstretched
racquet.
But the afternoon belonged
to Burgin's understudy, No. 2
Gates. The Card sophomore
upset the freshman Gerken,
UCLA's usual No. 1 player and a
quarter-finalist in last year's
U.S. Open.
Gates broke Gerken early
and held on for a 6-4 first set
win. Hitting winners like they

were going out of style, Gates
blasted Gerken in the second
6-0, prompting Brennan to call
it"the match of her life."
At No. 3 singles, Alyce
Werdel's meticulous baseline
game proved too much for
UCLA's Andrea Kriva to the
tune of a 6-1, 6-4 win.
Stanford lost at No. 4 and No.
5, but super-sub Alison Hard
ey, filling in for Copeland,
handily defeated Karin
Huebner 6-4, 6-1 at No. 6.
"She played a good clutch
match," Brennan said. "She's
such a super, super athlete."
The Cardinal travels south to
Ojai, Calif., later this week for
the Ojai Intercollegiates, a
series of individual singles and
doubles tournaments.
Brennan said Burgin would
not make the trip so she could
fully recover from the knee in
jury that has been nagging her
recently.
The following week, Stan
ford takes on UC-Berkely
Wednesday, Pepperdine Fri
day and No. 1 USC Saturday in
three home matches at Stan
ford Tennis Stadium.


Sophomore Linda Gates played what Stan
ford coach Frank Brennan called "the match
of her life" yesterday and beat UCLA

Greg Webb/Daily
freshman Barbara Gerken 6-4, 6-0. II wasn't
enough for the Cardinal, though, and Stan
ford lost the team battle to the Bruins 5-4.
Women's tennis fans were
treated to tennis' version of a
come-from-behind victory
yesterday in Stanford's match
with the UCLA Bruins here.
Stanford, unfortunately for
the nearly 1000 in attendence,
didn't do the treating.
The Cardinal held a 4-2 ad
vantage after the singles por
tion of the match and needed a
win in just one of the three
doubles contests to nail down
the team victory. They didn't
get it.
Fourth-ranked UCLA swept
the doubles and, with its pair of
singles wins, recorded a 5-4 up
set win over a Stanford team
ranked secondorthird, depen
ding on which poll you listen
to.
The contest was a re-match
of last year's NCAA Cham
pionships final in Salt Lake City,
which Stanford won 6-3.
Just as things were looking
good for Stanford yesterday,
they turned sour. Not only was
the Cardinal ahead 4-2 afterthe
singles, but two of UCLA'S
three doubles teams had never
played together before.
The doubles started and im
mediately the Card's No. 1 and
No. 2 teams began losing —
and losing badly.
At No. 1, the previously un
defeated pair of Elise Burgin
and Linda Gates found them
selves quickly behind 4-0 while
Caryn Copeland and Michelle
Weiss lost their first set 6-1. At
No. 3, Alison Hardey and Jackie
Joseph lost a tough first set 6-4.
Copeland/Weiss came back
to win the second set 6-2, but
dropped the third 6-4. A few
moments earlier,
Joseph/Hardey had lost their
match 6-4, 6-4.
That tied the team score at
4-4 and left the match up to
Burgin/Gates, who at the time
were serving at 3-4 in the sec
ond set, having lost the first in a
tiebreaker. The Bruin team of
Barbara Gerken and Heather
Ludloff broke serve and then
held at 5-3 to record the 7-6
(7-5), 6-3 victory.
Although the loss dropped
the Card to 16-3 overall and 8-2
in the WCAA, it more im
portantly set up Stanford's May
7 match with UCLA (16-4 and
7-1) in Westwood as the key
match of the regular season for
both teams.
Stanford was on the favor
able end of a 5-4 score against
UCLA a month ago at the Na
tional Indoor Championships
in Ann Arbor, Mich., making
the Bruins' win yesterday the
equalizer in the teams' series
this season.
Unless the Card beats USC in
two weeks or loses to San Die
go State May 6, the winner of
the upcoming Stanford-UCLA
contest will be the No. 3 seed at
the NCAA Championships in

Albuquerque, N.M., May
14-22. Barring a major upset,

behind No. 1 ranked USC.
