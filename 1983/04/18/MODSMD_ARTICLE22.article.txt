# Host Card wins tourney by a shot on final hole
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The USC men's golf team
is probably still wondering
what hit it.
Host Stanford, trailing the
I in ksters of Troy by 13
strokes with 18 holes re
maining, charged back and
nipped the Trojans by a shot
on the final hole yesterday
to win the U.S. Intercol
legiates held last weekend
at Stanford Golf Course.
Lew Dickey sunk a three
foot putt for par on the 18th
hole yesterday to lock up
the team title for the Cardi
nal in the 18-team, 54-hole
tournament.
Stanford finished with a
three-round total of 1101,
one stroke lower than USC
at 1102. UCLA was third with
1113, followed by San Diego
State with 1116, the Univer
sity of the Pacific with 1122
and Stanislaus State with
1140.
Nevada-Reno, who beat
the Card last weekend at the
Nevada-Reno Invitational,
finished in 11th place, while
UC-Berkeley was 14th and
San Jose State 15th.
Although Stanford coach
Tim Shaaf said the win does
not guarantee his team an
invitation to the NCAA
Championships, he was
confident it would help.
"This is a good tourna
ment to win and a very good
time of the year to win it,"
he said. "It does give us a
good chance (to get a bid to
the NCAAs).
"Respectable showings in
the next two tournaments
should get us into the
NCAAs."
Because the 54-hole tour
nament was over only two
days, 27 holes were played
each day. Attei the first day,
USC held a seven-stroke
lead over Stanford, 538-545,
and extended that advan
tage to 13 in the first nine
holes yesterday.
"We caught them shortly
after the turn (to the back
nine)," Shaaf explained.
"Lew (Dickey) and
(USC's) Sam Randolf came
down to the last hole and
they had to tie for us to win.
Randolf had a 12-footer for

birdie, but he left it short."
Randolf won medalist
honors with his three
round, two-under-par 211.
San Diego State's Greg
Twiggs was second at even
par with a 213.
Individually, Stanford
golfers fared well â€” three
placed in the top seven and
five in the top 16.
Dickey and Josh Mondry
tied for third place individu
ally, both firing 2195. Dickey
had rounds of 71, 72 and 76,
while Mondry put together
scores of 72, 77 and 70.
Shaaf called Mondry's
one-under-par7othe Card's
key round yesterday.
lack Skilling finished
seventh with a 221 (73-73-75)
while Lanny Sawchuck (78-
73-73) and Carl Wagner (69-
77-78) tied with four others
for 11th at 224.
Wagner's score, how
ever, did not count toward
Stanford's team tally since
he was entered in the indi

vidual and not the team
competition.
Also for Stanford, Scott
fcrickson fired three rounds
of 75 tor a 225 and Don
Walsworth checked in at 231
(71-77-83).
Shaaf did not think Stan
ford's home-course advan
tage was as much a factor as
usual. "There's always a lit
tle advantage," he said
"But the course only
opened last week (after
heavy winter rains) and we
haven't realty played in
thiee weeks.
"I don't want to minimize
the home-course advan
tage, but if ever there wasn't
one, this was it."
With the first-place finish,
Card golfers have taken first
twice and second once in
their last five tournaments.
Stanford won the Rancho-
Murietta Invitational and
was second at the Nevada-
Reno Invitational last week.
