# Hardgrave hammers Card back into swing of things
## Card takes 3 of 4 from Bruins 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
About the time Eric
Hardgrave's 14th home run
disrupted a sinter game on
neighboring Maloney Field
Saturday, it was evident that
the Cardinal was rocked out of
its prolonged hitting slump-
Stanford banged out of its
batting lapse in stvle and in
time to take three-offour con
ference from UCLA last
weekend and keep sole pos
session of first place in the
b-Pac.
The series concludes today
at 2 p.m. at Sunken Diamond
with Kevin Kunkel on the
mound for Stanford.
In completing a suspended
game Friday, the Cardinal went
in with a 7-1 lead and he'd on
for a 13-8 win, but lost the
regularly-scheduled bout, or
slugfest, 12-11 tor their first
home loss of the year.
It was not until Saturday's
10-4 Stanford win, however,

that coach Mark Marquess
could confidently feel they
were back.
"I think we're out of it and it
feels nice," Marquess said
Saturday after the Cardinal
pounded out 15 hits including
four home runs.
Hardgrave's first-inning,
three-run blast and his sixth
inning solo shot appropriately
broke the Stanford record for
season's home run work.
Neither home run landed until
it had reached nearly 450 feet
or beyond.
"Those weren't cheap
ones," Marquess said. "When
you reach the center-field side
of the scoreboard, you're talk
ing 450."
Marquess, who has been at
Stanford for four years as a
player, five years as an assistant
coach and six years as head
coach, said he has never seen
two balls hitas far in one game.
Hardgrave was four-for-five
on the day with four RBl's and

Mike AI d r e t e and Vi n c e
Sakowski each homered to up
stage five innings of shutout
pitching by Brian Myers. Myers
picked up the win to improve
his record to 6-2.
"Brian gave us five shutout
innings which is what we really
needed," Marquess said. "We
made a couple of great (defen
sive) plays and we were able to
hit early. That was the
difference. I was hoping we
wouldn't stay in the slump too
long."
Stanford needed only eight
hits to score 10 runs yesterday
as Bruin pitchers walked eight
batters.
Mike Dotterer broke a 4-3
game open with a three-run
triple in the fifth. Sakowski led
the inning off with a single be
fore UCLA starter Pat Clements
walked three straight batters
for one run.
After one pitch, Dotterer
turned for a minor beef with
the home plate umpire over a

strike call. Two pitches later he
used his anger to slam the ball
deep center field for three runs
and 8-3 lead.
John Radtke, who is working
his way back from arm trouble,
went 5 2 /» innings for his first
win of the season against two
losses and Steve Cottrell, who
was tagged with Friday's loss,
returned for 3'/» innings of
one-hit, shutout relief.
"Cottrell threw better today
than he did the other day,"
Marquess said."l don't know
why, but if we find out we'll tell
him to do it when he's start
ing."
Cottrell admitted he was
pressuring himself for a good
outing Friday and it hurt him.
"It was building up for a
couple weeks because I hadn't
had a good outing," Cottrell
said. "I went in looking for a
big game and everything I was
hoping 'or didn't happen. I

went in and my arm felt pretty
strong. I just didn't get my
rhythm."
"I was getting better every
inning, but I couldn't seem to
get over the hump where I'd
get a 1-2-3 inning. After a point
I got discouraged, and wasn't
competitive. Today I didn't
worry about the hits and made
sure I didn't have such big ex
pectations."
Friday, Cottrell, now 6-2,
surrendered nine runs on 11
hits while a punch-drunk left
Pries (5-4) struggled the dis
tance, giving up 11 runs and 15
hits, but getting the win.
Aldrete got Stanford on the
board first with a three-run
homer in the first inning, but
UCLA answered with a three
run homer by Brent Brakebill in
the fourth. The lead stood at
6-4 when the Bruins erupted
for six hits in the fifth.
UCLA chased Cottrell with
five consecutive hits, including
a lead-off homer by Rich
Amaral, and then drilled a

couple more hits otf reliever
Kunkel before the freshman
could stop the rally. Kunkel
also gave up a two-run home to
Lundsey Meggs in the sixth.
Stanford fought t>ack with
two runs in both the fifth and
sixth innings and had a chance
to win in the ninth.
With Sakowski on third and
two outs, shortstop Vince
Lopez threw a routine groun
der L)y Verducci into the dirst
near first, scoring Sakowski
and moving Verducci to sec
ond. A visibly shaken Pries
walked Stank ek and moved
the runners to second and
third with a wild pitch, but got
Mark Davis to fly out to end the
game.
Elsewhere in the 6-Pac,
Arizona State swept a three
game series from second-place
USC to drop the Trojans three
and one-half games off the
pace. Arizona State is in sec
ond place, two and a half
games behind the Cardinal.
Stanford plays a non
conference game at Sonoma
State Tuesday before visiting
Arizona State for a three-game
series next weekend.
