# McCloskey claims Guest Prof. Board 'torpedoed' class
## 
### JULIE HAGEN Staff writer 
Guest Prof. Paul "Pete" McClos
key has accused Seth Unfield, di
rector of the Guest Professorship
Board, of trying to "torpedo"
McCloskey's class, "The Congres
sional Decision-Making Process."
McCloskey told the Daily that the
omission of the course from the time
schedule, along with the board's
printingof only 35 syllabi and reading
packets for the course, were deliber
ate attempts to keep students from
knowing about and enrolling in the
course
McCloskey also charged Linfield
with an "invasion of academic free
dom'' by deleting from the course
reading list one book called Israel's
Defense Line in Washington. Accord
ing to McCloskey, l.infield vetoed
the book, saying, "You can't use
that. We don't think that's fair
enough."
McCloskey said Linfield, who is
Jewish, and Jewish students here
who opposed the course because of
McCloskey's strong statements
about cutting off U.S. aid to Israel,
are guilty of reverse anti-Semitism.
"I'll tell you, that's Jewish censor
ship That's the reverse of what used
to be called anti-Semitism, when
people condemned people because
they were Jewish. This kid, and that
group of people, are trying to pre
vent freedom of expression on the
Stanford campus."
Ironically, Linfield said that he had
spent a good part of the year defend
ing McCloskey when the extension
of the invitation was being debated,
and that without his efforts, and the
efforts of the board, the invitation to
teach here would not have been of
fered.
Linfield, a third-year law student,
denied any purposeful attempts to
suppress publicity. "There was no
such intent in mind. We progressed

as quickly as we could, first with the
approval of the board, and then the
senate."
According to Linfield, it was
McCloskey who "did not move
quickly enough on the syllabus"
which the board needed to review
before approving the class.
Only 36 students registered for the
course at advance registration, a fact
McCloskey attributed to the lack of
publicity for the course. Since the
beginning of the quarter, enrollment
in the course has increased to 51.
Linfield also denied that censor
ship had occurred, stating that the
reading list was reviewed with "cer
tain procedural safeguards" to en
sure a manageable reading list of
challenging selections. Linfield said
that McCloskey had planned some
"unacademic, non-rigorous, rather
silly lessons" which the board found
inadequate. Content of the reading
was not considered, he said.
"Not one iota of his academic
freedom has been violated," said
Linfield, "we are just trying to ensure
that he is a competent teacher. In any
case, he accepted the position with
tull notice of the express conditions
of the senate."
The former congressman blamed
Linfield for inadequate advertising
efforts. "Linfield was the one that
told me that they were going to give
the class publicity, post it and put it
out all over campus, so he must have
been the one that saw that didn't
happen," he said.
Although some members of the
Guest Professorship Board agreed
that the omission of the course from
the time schedule did hurt enroll
ment severely, Linfield said that at
the deadline for entering courses in
the time schedule McCloskey's class
had not been approved.
Linfield said the course was placed
in the "Time Schedule Changes" ad
vertisement in the Daily. In addition,
an ad for the course appeared and a
circular was posted around campus
publicizing the course.
Syllabi and reading materials were
printed after advance registration,
according to Linfield. Thirty-five
packets were printed in response to a
pre-registration of 36, anticipating
that some students would drop the
course.
According to McCloskey, a third of
these students are still without a syl
labus or reading packet, but Linfield
â€¢>aid these materials were printed and
have been available since the second
week of the quarter.
Linfield and McCloskey are split as
well on the question of how guest
speakers for the course are to be
selected and paid.
McCloskey was originally con
tracted to teach here only two days a
week. The board increased this to
three days a week, stipulating that on
the third day a guest speaker present
ing opposing political views would
lecture. This speaker would receive
$200 in payment from the Guest Pro
fessorship Board.
Linfield said that the board stipu
lated that they must approve all
speakers before they were invited to
lecture. According to Linfield,

McCloskey "tor some reason known
only to him, misunderstood," and
believed he had sole authority over
the guest speakers.
Former student body president
David Harris spoke on April 14, |ohn
Erlichmann is scheduled for April 28
and Dennis Hayes will speak on May
5.
"I have now had two speakers and
I haven't been able to pay them the
$200," said McCloskey.
McCloskey was acting outside the
terms and conditions of his contract,
Linfield said. A phone call from
McCloskey about the matter con
tained an "obscene and foul
mouthed tirade," Linfield added.
"It is my duty as Guest Professor
ship Board Director to ensure the
class be conducted in the highest
manner. Rep. McCloskey is demon
strating, again and again, that he is
not conforming to the highest ethical
standards. He has changed many
agreements between the board and
himself."
Linfield said he thought McClos
key was "huffing and puffing" in
order to create a smokescreen so the
board would not be able to see what
he was doing. He also said that he
thought McCloskey wanted to
"create controversy in order to in
crease the excitement and promote
interest in his class. That's his per
sonality. I think he would enjoy
creating controversy."
Some students in the class say that

they have not detected any persua
sive or biased statements in McClos
key's lectures. David Marks, a
member of the Guest Professorship
Board who was instrumental in bring
ing McCloskey here, said, "In the
beginning (when the invitation to
McCloskey was being debated) we
had some problems with the course.
Being Jewish myself, it had upset me
a little. But I figured as an educator
he could do an excellent job, and he
has. I respect the man, and I like
him."
