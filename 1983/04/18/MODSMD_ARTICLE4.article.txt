### JULIE HAGEN Staff writer 
Guest Prof. Paul "Pete" McClos
key has accused Seth Unfield, di
rector of the Guest Professorship
Board, of trying to "torpedo"
McCloskey's class, "The Congres
sional Decision-Making Process."
McCloskey told the Daily that the
omission of the course from the time
schedule, along with the board's
printingof only 35 syllabi and reading
packets for the course, were deliber
ate attempts to keep students from
knowing about and enrolling in the
course
McCloskey also charged Linfield
with an "invasion of academic free
dom'' by deleting from the course
reading list one book called Israel's
Defense Line in Washington. Accord
ing to McCloskey, l.infield vetoed
the book, saying, "You can't use
that. We don't think that's fair
enough."
McCloskey said Linfield, who is
Jewish, and Jewish students here
who opposed the course because of
McCloskey's strong statements
about cutting off U.S. aid to Israel,
are guilty of reverse anti-Semitism.
"I'll tell you, that's Jewish censor
ship That's the reverse of what used
to be called anti-Semitism, when
people condemned people because
they were Jewish. This kid, and that
group of people, are trying to pre
vent freedom of expression on the
Stanford campus."
Ironically, Linfield said that he had
spent a good part of the year defend
ing McCloskey when the extension
of the invitation was being debated,
and that without his efforts, and the
efforts of the board, the invitation to
teach here would not have been of
fered.
Linfield, a third-year law student,
denied any purposeful attempts to
suppress publicity. "There was no
such intent in mind. We progressed

as quickly as we could, first with the
approval of the board, and then the
senate."
According to Linfield, it was
McCloskey who "did not move
quickly enough on the syllabus"
which the board needed to review
before approving the class.
Only 36 students registered for the
course at advance registration, a fact
McCloskey attributed to the lack of
publicity for the course. Since the
beginning of the quarter, enrollment
in the course has increased to 51.
Linfield also denied that censor
ship had occurred, stating that the
reading list was reviewed with "cer
tain procedural safeguards" to en
sure a manageable reading list of
challenging selections. Linfield said
that McCloskey had planned some
"unacademic, non-rigorous, rather
silly lessons" which the board found
inadequate. Content of the reading
was not considered, he said.
"Not one iota of his academic
freedom has been violated," said
Linfield, "we are just trying to ensure
that he is a competent teacher. In any
case, he accepted the position with
tull notice of the express conditions
of the senate."
The former congressman blamed
Linfield for inadequate advertising
efforts. "Linfield was the one that
told me that they were going to give
the class publicity, post it and put it
out all over campus, so he must have
been the one that saw that didn't
happen," he said.
Although some members of the
Guest Professorship Board agreed
that the omission of the course from
the time schedule did hurt enroll
ment severely, Linfield said that at
the deadline for entering courses in
the time schedule McCloskey's class
had not been approved.
Linfield said the course was placed
in the "Time Schedule Changes" ad
