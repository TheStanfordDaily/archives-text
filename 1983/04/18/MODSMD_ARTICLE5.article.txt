# Rock stars may play this summer

The Committee on Contemporary Entertainment is
waiting to hear from student groups before giving Uni
versity concert representative Vicky Holt the go-ahead
to negotiate a possible summer concert series with Bill
Graham Presents. Potential performers include Elton
John and James Taylor.
Holt, director of Events and Services and this
quarter's chair of the Committee on Contemporary En
tertainment (COCE), said that while no formal negotia
tion for these concerts has taken place, "We have re
served Frost Amphitheater for several days during the
summer and fall and have talked with Bill Graham about

the groups that will be touring at those times."
Elton John will be on the West Coast in July, Christ
opher Cross in August, James Taylor in September and
the Beach Boys in October. The Grateful Dead may be
available to play later in the fall as well, Holt said.
Before formal negotiations may begin, COCE must
first approve a campus organization to co-promote a
concert with Graham. Holt said that no student organi
zation has yet received that approval.
I he Rugby Club, Delta Upsilon fraternity, Yost House,
KZSU and the Concert Network have all expressed
interest in co-promoting a concert, Holt said.
"It we didn't block some dates in Frost, we weren't
going to have it available. The dates were rapidly being
taken up by weddings and alumni functions," Holt said.
Holt met last Monday with Danny Scher, vice
president of Bill Graham Presents and a Stanford grad, to
discuss these dates. She said, "I was explicitly clear with
him that if we didn't have any student groups, then there
wouldn't be any concerts."
Scher would not comment on the summer series,
other than to say that the relationship between
Graham's group and Stanford is "very good" right now.
The chairman of the Concert Network, Vinnie Freda,
said that the network is interested in promoting shows
over the summer. "We're going to propose in the next
week to do a couple of shows in Frost during the sum
mer and then one more in October," Freda said.
Jim Mooney, station manager for KZSU, said the radio
station will probably not get involved with rock concerts
until next winter, although they are looking into doing a
smaller jazz show at Dinkelspiel this quarter. "We'll
have a skeletal staff this summer, so we're not going to
get involved with big concerts yet. But we're definitely
interested. That's where the money is," Mooney said.
The Concert Network is currently finishing up the
paperwork involved with the Pat Benatar concert. Held
in Maples Pavilion over spring break, the Benatar con
cert was the third and most recent concert to be held on
campus this year.
Any student or University group can propose to do a
concert, but as Freda said, "There's a major, major
difference in proposing a concert and having it ap
proved."
The first step toward being approved for a concert
involves sending a written proposal to the executive
committee of COCE. COCE then examines the group's
financial stability, experience in entertainment events,
and expected benefits from producing a concert.
If the group meets all of the executive committee's
standards, it may then come forth with a second propo

sal for a specific concert, including approximately how
much money the group wants to make. This proposal is
presented to the concert committee of COCE.
If the proposal again passes, its sponsor can ask Holt
to begin contract negotiations with Bill Graham Pre
sents.
There is very little money risk involved for the student
group and none for the University because concerts are
co-promoted with Graham. "The risk for the student
group isn't zero, it's just minimal," Freda said.
Freda said that the Concert Network made $2000-
$.3000 on the Benatar concert.
According to Freda, this system has its drawbacks.
"You're teaching a new group how to promote a concert
every time, which slows down the process considerably.
It's a situation which is great for student group, but not
for students."
Holt agreed that there may be a more efficient way to
produce concerts. "Next fall, after we've had about a
year-and-a-half's worth of experience, I suspect there
will be some evaluation of the system."
