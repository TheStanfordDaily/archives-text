He promised more "interesting
and eye-catching stunts," but de
clined to elaborate further.
Robinson also said he has some
changes in mind for what he believes
is the real foundation of the Band, its
music. "I think we've drifted a bit
away from the majority of students'
taste, playing too much old rock and
roll. We'll always play the rock, but
I'd like to see us do some more slow
numbers and some newer stuff."
Robinson said he has 10 to 15 new
pieces for next year, most of them
recommended to him by students.
"People just come up to me and ask

'Why don't you play this?' and I say
'Okay, I will,' and we do.
"We welcome student input into
the band because we're here to en
tertain the students," Robinson said.
He said he sees the elimination of
"ringers"—students and non
students who "come to party, not to
play"—as one of the most important
changes in the Band this year. "They
thinned out our sound," he ex
plained. "Music is the whole reason
for the Band, and they contributed
nothing in that area."
For the last two years, the Band has
been in the process of altering what
had become, according to Streets, "a

selfish and egotistical attitude."
"The Band is now much more con
cerned with how it is perceived bv
the students. There is much less of
the macho hands in the air attitude
which has characterized us in the
past," Streets said.
What will not be seen on the field
next fall are the "inside jokes" which
have drawn criticism of the Band's
presentations in the past. "Things
like that turned a lot of people off on
the Band. They got the idea that we
were a self-contained unit just out to
have a good time," Robinson said.
The inside jokes were also
symptomatic, according to Robin
son, of the improper direction the
Band had been taking until last year.
"We have been concentrating more

on school spirit these last two years.
It should be the main focus of a col
lege band, and it wasn't here until
recently."
While Streets wryly complimented
the football team on providing
"good entertainment" between the
pre-game, half-time and post-game
concerts, Robinson took a more
modest tack regarding the impor
tance of the Band. "We're here to
support the team, we're not an end
in ourselves."
For this reason, Robinson said he
sees a good rapport with the athletic
teams as essential. Both he and
Streets said they are pleased with an
improvement in this area despite the
statements of some football players
regarding the role of the Band in the
loss to UC-Berkeley this year.
Asst. Band Manager Ben Langlotz
played down these criticisms, saying
thev resulted from the frustrations of

losing the Big Game on a series of
questionable call by the officials.
"Stanford students are knowledge
able and aware enough to know that
the Band did not lose the game," he
said.
In fact, Robinson said he sees the
Big Game as a boon to the Band, "It
made us the most famous college
band in the United States, we've had
offers to play private parties pouring
in from the national publicity we
got."
The Band will also appear in"*3an
Francisco at the Bay to Breakers race
May 12 as well as a surprise engage
ment at the Black and White Ball.
Robinson and Streets both said
they want to be sure people do not
think the Band is turning more con
servative. "We're getting more or
ganized, but definitely not more
conservative. We'll always be irreve
rent.".
