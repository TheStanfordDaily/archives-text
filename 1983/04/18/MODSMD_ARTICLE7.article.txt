China shells, warns Vietnam
Peking — Shelling Vietnamese border positions for
the second day in a row, China warned Hanoi in
strong terms yesterday that it risks war if it presses its
offensive against nationalist guerrillas in Cambodia
and continues "armed provocations" along the Chi
nese-Vietnamese border.
Chinese troops in southern Yunnan Province
shelled the Vietnamese border positions heavily for
most of the day in retaliation for what Peking de
scribed as repeated Vietnamese attacks across the
frontier during the last month, the official New China
News Agency reported. There was no immediate in
formation about casualties.
Moreover, a toughly worded commentary in the

Communist Party newspaper People's Daily made it
clear that Peking views the Vietnamese offensive in
Cambodia, especially the fighting along the border
with Thailand, with as much concern as the tension
along the Sino-Vietnamese border.
"The Vietnamese authorities have increased provo
cations on the Sino-Vietnamese border in an attempt
to tie up China and prevent it from supporting the just
struggle of the people of Kampuchea (Cambodia) and
Thailand," the People's Daily said. "But the Vietnam
ese authorities have miscalculated. . . .
"The counter-attacks by the Chinese frontier
guards are both a forceful blow to the arrogance of
the Vietnamese authorities and a serious warning
against their ambitions of regional hegemonism."
Begin refuses settlement freeze
Jerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin offered yesterday to resume the deadlocked U.S.-
Israeli-Egyptian negotiations for Palestinian auton
omy, but flatly ruled out a freeze on Jewish settlement
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a precondition for
reopening the talks.
In a nationally televised speech marking Israel's
35th Independence Day, Begin said Israel has an "in
alienable right" to hold and settle the territoriesthat it
occupied during the Israel-Arab 1967 war.
To dramatize its settlement policy, the government
scheduled ceremonies for today to mark the con
version of a military outpost to a civilian settlement on
Mount Bracha overlooking Nablus, the largest and
most volatile Arab city on the West Bank of the Jordan
River.
Senate faces withholding debate
Washington — The Senate is gearing up to renew a
battle that has produced a deep split in the Re
publican Party — whether to repeal a new law
withholding taxes from interest and dividends. ,
President Reagan and some of the Senate Re
publican leaders who have been instrumental in his
congressional victories want to retain withholding.
They are being aided by a handful of liberal Demo
cratic senators and key Democrats in the House.
On the other side are most Republicans in both
houses and the Democratic leadership in the Senate.
Sen. Bob Kasten (R-Wis.), who is leading the charge
to repeal withholding, says the GOP has been forced
into a politically untenable position because of Rea
gan's support for the new law. The millions of letters
that have poured into Washington urging repeal of
withholding prove the party leadership is on the
wrong side, he added.
Volker supports currency stability
Rome — Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker is advocating that the United States and other
major nations agree to intervene modestly in foreign
exchange markets to control extreme fluctuations in
the value of the dollar compared with other major
currencies.
In a private address to the Trilateral Commission
here last night, Volcker reportedly offered hissugges
tion as one with limited goals.

But the question of how to deal with fluctuating ex
change rates has been a matter of intense debate late
ly, and although market intervention has been op
posed by the Reagan administration, it will be a major
topic at the Williamsburg, Va. economic summit at
the end of May.
It was learned that Volcker specifically ruled out as
counterproductive any notion of a new Bretton
Woods conference or any suggestion of a complete
return to fixed exchange rates. The Bretton Woods
Conference of 1944 tied the international monetary
system to gold, priced at $35 an ounce.
That system was abandoned by former President
Richard Nixon in August 1971, when he broke the link
between gold and the dollar. Since then, exchange
rates have been allowed to fluctuate against each oth
er according to the dictates of the foreign exchange
market.
Police disrupt Warsaw ceremony
Warsaw, Poland — Polish police harassed a pro-Sol
idarity crowd of 1000 people yesterday as they tried to
honor heroes of the 1943 Jewish uprising in the War
saw Ghetto, but the gathering was finally allowed to
conduct a 15-minute ceremony of prayers and laying
of flowers at a central Warsaw monument tothe ghet
to victims.
"They are close to us because they fought for the
ideals... that were the cornerstone of Solidarity and
that are dear to all of us," Janusz Onyszkiewicz,
former spokesman of the now-outlawed independ
ent trade union, said of the victims.
"If the heroes of the ghetto lived today, we firmly
believe that they would join us in our fight for free
dom, truth, and human dignity," he added to loud ap
plause.
Minutes after addressing the crowd, Onyszkiewicz
was detained by plainclothes policemen, who were
seen escorting away several other participants.
The crowd had gathered for an unofficial ob
servance to counter official ceremonies com
memorating the 40th anniversary of the ghetto upris
ing.
Yesterday's confrontation was only the latest in a
series of developments that have marred the most
ambitious official celebration of the uprising ever or
ganized.
Today's weather
Showers likely. Strong, gusty winds. Partly cloudy.
