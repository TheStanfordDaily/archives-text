China shells, warns Vietnam
Peking â€” Shelling Vietnamese border positions for
the second day in a row, China warned Hanoi in
strong terms yesterday that it risks war if it presses its
offensive against nationalist guerrillas in Cambodia
and continues "armed provocations" along the Chi
nese-Vietnamese border.
Chinese troops in southern Yunnan Province
shelled the Vietnamese border positions heavily for
most of the day in retaliation for what Peking de
scribed as repeated Vietnamese attacks across the
frontier during the last month, the official New China
News Agency reported. There was no immediate in
formation about casualties.
Moreover, a toughly worded commentary in the

Communist Party newspaper People's Daily made it
clear that Peking views the Vietnamese offensive in
Cambodia, especially the fighting along the border
with Thailand, with as much concern as the tension
along the Sino-Vietnamese border.
"The Vietnamese authorities have increased provo
cations on the Sino-Vietnamese border in an attempt
to tie up China and prevent it from supporting the just
struggle of the people of Kampuchea (Cambodia) and
Thailand," the People's Daily said. "But the Vietnam
ese authorities have miscalculated. . . .
"The counter-attacks by the Chinese frontier
guards are both a forceful blow to the arrogance of
the Vietnamese authorities and a serious warning
against their ambitions of regional hegemonism."
