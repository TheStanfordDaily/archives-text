# Row Houses
## Low draw number is a ticket to cozy campus living 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
(Last in a three-part series.)
Life on the row: croquet on
the front lawn, open kitchen,
central location and that
"homey" atmosphere.
Row houses — primarily
those residences along
Mayfield Avenue and in the
Cowell Cluster — are tradi
tionally the most favored stu
dent residential housing on
campus. The 23 dwellings open
their doors each September to
a high percentage of returning
residents and some lucky new
comers clutching a low draw
number.
One explanation for the
popularity oi the row houses is
the house living that reminds
many students of their family
homes. "I like the house as
pect. It's better than big dorms
that look like shoe boxes," said
sophomore Kari Skilbred, a
resident of Grove-Lasuen.
"The neighborhood has a
very residential feeling. It (row
life) offers a lot of coziness,"
said Diana Conklin, director of
the row.
Conklin divides the row into
"self-ops, U-ops and theme
houses." As the names
suggest, self-ops are basically
student-run, U-ops are man
aged by the University and
theme houses are organized
around a particular focus.
Self-ops offer students the
opportunity to "take care of
their own affairs without very
much outside assistance,"
Conklin said. "It's kind of indi

vidual living," she said, where
residents are responsible for
their own finances, food and
house cleaning. They "or
ganize their own lives," she
explained.
U-ops "combine the advan-

tage of the dorm with the small
house coziness and indepen
dence," she continued. They
feature University cleaningand
food service.
Theme houses — such as the
French, Italian and American
Studies houses — emphasize
learning about a particular cul
ture. Dinner at the French
House or Italian House typi
cally includes speaking the

language and eating the
cuisine unique to their respec
tive regions.
Like students across the
campus, food is a primary con
sideration of students along
the row. Open kitchen —

where house members car

scrounge through leftovers or
specially marked snacks at all
hours of the day and, more
commonly, the night — is one
of the most popular features of
the row houses, according to
residents.
"One of the things I really
like is open kitchen," said
senior Tim Friedlander, a resi
dent of Cowell Cluster's ZAP

House. "Right now I'm having
a banana milkshake that I made
myself. You have more flexibil
ity in what and when you eat,"
he added.
Ann Remley, also a ZAP resi
dent, said, "It (open kitchen)
makes the kitchen a focal
point."
Meals — som< times delect
able, other times barely palat
able — are nevertheless a con
stant source of conversation
and controversy I thought I
was getting the best food on
campus. The food is horrible.
Most of the time it is barely
chokeable — like tortellini
said Claude Mi 11 ma n , a
sophomore in the Italian
House.
Vet Danilo Purlia, also a
sophomore in the Italian
House, disagrees. The food is
better here than you would
find in any dorm on campus,"
he countered.
One problem plaguing the
Italian House — and perhaps
characteristic ot three-class
houses across campus — is
"sedateness" and student
afTftthy. "The Italian House is a
nice place to live physically but
whenever you move into a
three-class house it's a lot
more sedate (than an all -
freshman dorm)," Purlia said.
"There is a lot of apathy in
the hcjuse. That's what makes it
so sedate," he admitted. But
this attitude is probably "indi
cative of all row louses — ex
cept the frats," he said.
Millman, a bit more outspo
ken on the subject, said,
"There would bt times when
you were having a fun time in
the house and then all of the
sudden the apathetic, studious
Italian House members would
come out of their rooms and
tell us to shut up. Fun is not
permitted in the house."
Purlia insisted, "Still there
are more positive things than
negative."
Ski I bred likes Grove because
of its location. "I like the vari
ety — Columbae, frats, theme
houses all on the row. Socially,
it's kind of good because frats
have parties and happy hours,"
she said.
In addition, she noted the

social cohesion between the
two Grove houses — Lasuen
and Mayfield. "We work as
one," she said. Some events at
the Grove houses include
happy hours, wine-tasting, a
Halloween party and football

game tailgaters.
Because of the small size of
row houses, usually between
! 0 to residents, there is a
great opportunity to meet all of
your fellow house members.
"You get to know them really
well, but then again there's a
grapevine, and that's kind of a
drag sometimes," Skilbred
said.

Whereas Skilbred likes the
fact that Grove is a U-op —
"someone comes and cleans
for us and stuff" — some resi
dents of the theme houses
think that their houses could
be stronger if the theme was

less emphasized.
Sophomore Jeff Blain. a resi
dent of the Italian House, said,
"I think the theme stifles social
activity to some degree he
cause people don't really
interact with other people in
general. That's one of the
major problems. You try to
think of what it would be like
with no theme — it'd be fantas
tic."

Like Okada's Tea House and
the new Frog's at Governor's
Corner, the Row boasts a res
taurant of its own. La Pizzeria,
the student-operated restau
rant in the Italian House, is
popular both among house
residents and Saturday fre
quenters in search of the
weekly special.
"La Pizzeria is great. It's
completely student-run.
Everybody in the house has an
opportunity to get involved
with it," Purlia said.
While the University consid
ers the structures in Cowell
Cluster "row" houses, these
residences hardly share the
same proximity to White Plaza.
Still, the Cowell Cluster enjoys
many of the amenities of row
living, most notably small,
close-knit residences sharing
in that "homey'' atmosphere.
Friedlander and Remley said
they enjoy ZAP because it has a
cook, they get paid for house
jobs and there are a small
number of residents. Like all
houses in Cowell Cluster (ex
cept Terra, a co-op), ZAP is a
self-op. "The place usually
stays pretty clean anyway,"
said Remley.
So, while Blair noted that
"each house on the Row has its
own merits and its own prob
lems," all share a sense of self
reliance, an ever-popular
kitchen and the cozy side of
campus living.

French, Italian and American
Studies houses — emphasize
learning about a particular cul
ture. Dinner at the French
House or Italian House typi
cally includes speaking the

language and eating the
cuisine unique to their respec
tive regions.
Like students across the
campus, food is a primary con
sideration of students along
the row. Open kitchen —

where house members car

scrounge through leftovers or
specially marked snacks at all
hours of the day and, more
commonly, the night — is one
of the most popular features of
the row houses, according to
residents.
"One of the things I really
like is open kitchen," said
senior Tim Friedlander, a resi
dent of Cowell Cluster's ZAP

House. "Right now I'm having
a banana milkshake that I made
myself. You have more flexibil
ity in what and when you eat,"
he added.
Ann Remley, also a ZAP resi
dent, said, "It (open kitchen)
makes the kitchen a focal
point."
Meals — som< times delect
able, other times barely palat
able — are nevertheless a con
stant source of conversation
and controversy I thought I
was getting the best food on
campus. The food is horrible.
Most of the time it is barely
chokeable — like tortellini
said Claude Mi 11 ma n , a
sophomore in the Italian
House.
Vet Danilo Purlia, also a
sophomore in the Italian
House, disagrees. The food is
better here than you would
find in any dorm on campus,"
he countered.
One problem plaguing the
Italian House — and perhaps
characteristic ot three-class
houses across campus — is
"sedateness" and student
afTftthy. "The Italian House is a
nice place to live physically but
whenever you move into a
three-class house it's a lot
more sedate (than an all -
freshman dorm)," Purlia said.
"There is a lot of apathy in
the hcjuse. That's what makes it
so sedate," he admitted. But
this attitude is probably "indi
cative of all row louses — ex
cept the frats," he said.
Millman, a bit more outspo
ken on the subject, said,
"There would bt times when
you were having a fun time in
the house and then all of the
sudden the apathetic, studious
Italian House members would
come out of their rooms and
tell us to shut up. Fun is not
permitted in the house."
Purlia insisted, "Still there
are more positive things than
negative."
Ski I bred likes Grove because
of its location. "I like the vari
ety — Columbae, frats, theme
houses all on the row. Socially,
it's kind of good because frats
have parties and happy hours,"
she said.
In addition, she noted the

social cohesion between the
two Grove houses — Lasuen
and Mayfield. "We work as
one," she said. Some events at
the Grove houses include
happy hours, wine-tasting, a
Halloween party and football

game tailgaters.
Because of the small size of
row houses, usually between
! 0 to residents, there is a
great opportunity to meet all of
your fellow house members.
"You get to know them really
well, but then again there's a
grapevine, and that's kind of a
drag sometimes," Skilbred
said.

Whereas Skilbred likes the
fact that Grove is a U-op —
"someone comes and cleans
for us and stuff" — some resi
dents of the theme houses
think that their houses could
be stronger if the theme was

less emphasized.
Sophomore Jeff Blain. a resi
dent of the Italian House, said,
"I think the theme stifles social
activity to some degree he
cause people don't really
interact with other people in
general. That's one of the
major problems. You try to
think of what it would be like
with no theme — it'd be fantas
tic."

Like Okada's Tea House and
the new Frog's at Governor's
Corner, the Row boasts a res
taurant of its own. La Pizzeria,
the student-operated restau
rant in the Italian House, is
popular both among house
residents and Saturday fre
quenters in search of the
weekly special.
"La Pizzeria is great. It's
completely student-run.
Everybody in the house has an
opportunity to get involved
with it," Purlia said.
While the University consid
ers the structures in Cowell
Cluster "row" houses, these
residences hardly share the
same proximity to White Plaza.
Still, the Cowell Cluster enjoys
many of the amenities of row
living, most notably small,
close-knit residences sharing
in that "homey'' atmosphere.
Friedlander and Remley said
they enjoy ZAP because it has a
cook, they get paid for house
jobs and there are a small
number of residents. Like all
houses in Cowell Cluster (ex
cept Terra, a co-op), ZAP is a
self-op. "The place usually
stays pretty clean anyway,"
said Remley.
So, while Blair noted that
"each house on the Row has its
own merits and its own prob
lems," all share a sense of self
reliance, an ever-popular
kitchen and the cozy side of
campus living.

Life on the row: croquet on
the front lawn, open kitchen,
central location and that
"homey" atmosphere.
Row houses — primarily
those residences along
Mayfield Avenue and in the
Cowell Cluster — are tradi
tionally the most favored stu
dent residential housing on
campus. The 23 dwellings open
their doors each September to
a high percentage of returning
residents and some lucky new
comers clutching a low draw
number.
One explanation for the
popularity oi the row houses is
the house living that reminds
many students of their family
homes. "I like the house as
pect. It's better than big dorms
that look like shoe boxes," said
sophomore Kari Skilbred, a
resident of Grove-Lasuen.
"The neighborhood has a
very residential feeling. It (row
life) offers a lot of coziness,"
said Diana Conklin, director of
the row.
Conklin divides the row into
"self-ops, U-ops and theme
houses." As the names
suggest, self-ops are basically
student-run, U-ops are man
aged by the University and
theme houses are organized
around a particular focus.
Self-ops offer students the
opportunity to "take care of
their own affairs without very
much outside assistance,"
Conklin said. "It's kind of indi

vidual living," she said, where
residents are responsible for
their own finances, food and
house cleaning. They "or
ganize their own lives," she
explained.
U-ops "combine the advan-

tage of the dorm with the small
house coziness and indepen
dence," she continued. They
feature University cleaningand
food service.
