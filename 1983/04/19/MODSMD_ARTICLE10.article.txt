# Student artists creatively decorate University rooms
## 
### SARAH CARREL 
Some of the most intriguing
artwork by Stanford artists is
hidden away in students'
rooms. Much of it will be
viewed only by friends or
people who happen to wander
by. The majority of it will be
destroyed before the room is
occupied by another student in
another year. A phenomenal
number of hours, including
careful planning, goes into the
completion of most murals
painted by students inside
their dormitory rooms. At the
end of the academic year,
these works of art are covered
by a quick layer of paint, never
to be seen again.
One junior worked for four
weeks last year to finish a mural
in his Granada single. It was a
reproduction of the cover of
Elvis Costello's Armed Forces
album. The finished product
involved many colors in an in
tricate pattern. What may look
like paint slops on the album
cover were extremely hard to
copy in the exact form. At the
end of the year the student
found that he was going to live
in thatsame room again. Think
ing this meant an opportunity
to save his artwork, he was

happy. "I left a note on it (the
mural), saying that I was proud
of what I had done," said the
artist, who requested that the
mural not be destroyed since
he was returning to the room
for another year of residence.
His efforts were in vain. The
junior returned this year to find
that his walls had been sloppily
repainted. "I felt a large
amount of work had been
poured down the drain," he
said. He went on to say that a
tree, painted in a friend's room
down the hall had been left
alone. "Maybe because that
was nice," he added with a
smile. "Mine was garrish."
Indeed, the policy of Bob
Mibach, the facilities manager
for the residence halls, is that
a mural is in "The eyes of the
beholder." Many students are
offended or bothered if they
move into a new room to find a
mural on the wall, especially if
they view it as unattractive.
"Sometimes new students
even request that a mural be
removed," Mibach said. "It is
then our responsibility to do
that." As far as repainting is
concerned, Mibach works en
tirely under the wording of the
Stanford University Residence

Agreement, signed by every
student before he or she
moves into University housing.
This states that when the room
is vacated, it is expected to be
left exactly as it was found. A
room is considered damaged if
this is not the case, and a stu
dent is charged for any main
tenance, including the removal
of murals. Another problem
mentioned by Mibach was that
many of the rooms are used as
housing for summer confer
ences, and must be attractive
and neutral. The policy seems
sound enough, and yet there
are murals that have remained
in the housing system for
years.
Doug Needles is a senior liv
ing in Roble. This year he had
the highest number of priority
points in the entire dormitory,
meaning he had first choice of
all the rooms. Needles chose a
room with the inside cover of
Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the
Moon album painted over an
entire wall. The mural was
completed in 1977 by a student
named John Cheney. Since
then, the occupants of the
room have lived there because
of the mural. Each has been a
good friend of the student liv

ing there the previous year.
Each has signed his name on
the wall under Cheney's signa
ture, and added the date of oc
cupancy. Needles had to sign a
form stating that he would
paint over the mural at the end
of the year if the next occupant
did not want it."I knew the
guys who lived here three of
the last four years, Needles
said. "We always wanted to
keep it in the family, so I'm not
worried." Needles has already
been approached by students
who want the room and the
mural next year. Although ar
tist john Cheney has j ust be
come "The name on the wall,"
this mural is now a Stanford
tradition.
Cecilia Riviera is another
Roble resident who has man
aged to save her mural. The
senior completed her rainbow
in September of 1981. This
year, as an RA, she chose to live
in the room again, and left a
huge note on her wall, plead
ing to have the work saved. In
her case, the painting was
spared. "The room was so ugly
I had to do something with it,"
said Riviera, who spent the first
and only all-nighter of her life
finishing the job. She con

tinued, "I think all students
should be allowed to paint
murals. It really gives a room its
own identity. One night at
home last summer I had a
dream that it had been painted
over. It was really terrible!"
Zapata, the home of many
famous murals in its common
rooms, dining hall and stair
wells, also houses some fas
cinating work within the stu
dent rooms. Sandy Stewart is a
sophomore who has worked in
acrylics on her walls. She has
finished an amazingly realistic
work of Bruce Springsteen and
another of a cowboy. Stewart
estimates nine or 10 hours of
work for each picture. "I really
don't want to paint over th
ese," she said. "It would de
stroy the character of the
room." Her painting is so
popular that friend Randy
Vogel asked her to do a paint
ing of Jim Morrison on his
Zapata wall.
Many students have painted
their murals with the knowl
edge that the work will have to
be destroyed. Ken Schum, an
Arroyo freshman, knew that
the camouflage colors he
covered his room with would

have to be painted over. "It
didn't bother me at first," he
said, "but it's bothered me a lot
lately because the work has
grown on me." Schum painted
one splotch of the mural a
bright red, and added Joseph
Conrad's words, "The horror,
the horror," from the novel
Heart of Darkness. The
freshman was a pre-med at the
time he painted the mural, and
said that he felt like Conrad's
character Kurtz, thrown among
savages, when he was thrown
among Stanford's competitive
pre-meds. Thus the mural has
come to mean more to him,
and would beconsidered more
of a tragedy should it be de
stroyed.
Finally, there are those ar
tists who are of the attitude that
their work can never really be
destroyed. Pierre "Clovis"
Valette and Dave Ream are
roommates in Arroyo who
painted half their room bright
red and the other pitch black.
Then, using plastic spoons,
paint brushes, fingers, or any
thingthatdid notinvolvedirect
contact with the walls, they
flicked the opposing color
onto each half of the room.
Valette smilingly interpreted

the work. "We had no idea
how it would turn out, so it's
sort of an expression of the
subconscious. I think these
colors have always been
there, ' the freshman added.
"Black and red have so much
force. I don't ever think this
will really be destroyed, even if
it is painted over. This is our
gift to Stanford."
Ream, also a freshman, had
other things to say. "We just
did it for fun," he grinned. "It
was an integral part of our
freshman experience. "The
color combinations can get
hard to deal with, but it was
something different."
So murals are continually
painted in the University hous
ing system and continue to be
destroyed. Students are fight
ing the system. One student is
at work on a second mural, this
time painted in acrylics, which
aren't as easily destroyed as the
watercolors of his previous
mural. Other paintings, which
can only be loved by their
creators, need to be removed.
Yet the mural-painting goes
on, and no doubt will continue
as long as students have space
to paint.
