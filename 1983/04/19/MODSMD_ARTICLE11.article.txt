## The
						Stanford Daily Open door for physically limited 
### 
Not always, but usually, Stanford exceeds the
federal minimum daily requirements.
By creating the new Office of Services to Phys
ically Limited Students, the University has
shown a commitment to improving conditions
for physically limited students exceeding gov
ernment guidelines.
During the past year, the number of self
identified physically limited students has dou
bled and students seem more at ease with iden
tifying themselves.
With the new office, students with limitations
ranging from food allergies to diabetes to re
spiratory ailments to hearing impairments will
be even less hesitant to identify themselves and
prospective students who are handicapped will
not be discouraged by the environment here.
Previously, many different people and de
partments accommodated self-identified physi
cally limited students in an ad hoc role. The new
office should unify physically limited services
and better equip the University for preventing
potential problems and treating emergencies.
Wheelchair restricted students will know that

they have a place to go tor access problems,
hearing impaired students will know that they
have a place to go for an oral interpreter and
visually impaired students will be able to have
cassette tapes of textbooks before they enter
class.
We ar'e heartened by the University's growing
interest in improving the quality of life for the
physically limited. "Bike" or wheelchair ramps
were almost nonexistent as recently as five years
ago. Old dormitories, unlike the new Gover
nor's Corner housing, were not wheelchair ac
cessible. Now, planners keep accessibility in
mind â€” although there have been mistakes,
such as constructing inaccessible stacks in
Green Library. Storey House and the first floor
of Governor's Corner are wheelchair accessible
(although there are no elevators). New facilities,
such as the Communication Department build
ing, contain braille elevator buttons.
1 here are still many nonaccessible areas here,
and the University has a way to go until physi
cally limited students are not "handicapped."
Happily, the creation of the office indicates that
the University is moving in the right direction.
