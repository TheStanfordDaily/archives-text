## Combining sports and study 
### 
In his column entitled "Athletes
avoid opportunities" (Daily, April 5),
lan Boyer makes several valid points
about the place of athletics within
the college environment. Upon this
worthy theme, I would like to give a
Stanford athlete's perspective on col
lege athletics as a participant within
the "system" — as opposed to a
journalist or educator who is outside
the infrastructure and not accessible
to various insights on this matter.
My viewpoint attacks both the
shortcomings of intercollegiate
sports along with the strengths and
potential that the proper balance of
athletics can provide within a college
environment — an ideal that Stan
ford comes remarkably close to
achieving. For this reason, Boyer's
point regarding the relative unlikeli
hood of finding a student-athlete at
Stanford who can "have the ability to
excel in a sport, pursue a challenging
curriculum of studies, interact with
other students and engage in all sorts
of other activities" is grossly over
stated add I am perstthaUy disap
pointed by such a categorization. It is
for the sole reason that academics
and athletics must be a compatible
mix, and not a trade-off, that I ex
press my opinion on this subject.
The first matter that greatly disap
points me in the arena of college ath
letics is the lowering of expectations
by administrators when it comes to
dealing with athletes. Although this
observation does not pertain to Stan
ford for the most part, it is a problem
that requires the attention of stu
dents who are both participants and
non-participants in intercollegiate
sports.
At too many colleges, athletes are
kept separate from the rest of the
student body, housed in plush athle
tic dorms. Too often, they are not
challenged academically — since
they are good athletes, they are not
expected to be good students.
As an athlete myself, it is this in
stitutionalized dichotomy between
"athletes" and "students" at many
major universities that greatly dis
tresses me. Although for the most
part it is not present here, it is this
observed dichotomy on college
campuses that often makes me
apologetic for my own involvement
in athletics.
With increasing salaries and prize
money available to the approxi
mately 2 percent of collegians that
make the professional ranks, this
problem of lower academic expecta
tions for athletes is likely to increase
at colleges across the country. Many
coaches and educators appear to be
indifferent to so-called "disengage
ment trauma," the devastating effect
of being disengaged from sport after
a virtual lifetime of getting a free ride
through scholarships for sports par
ticipation.

As UC-Berkeley Sociology Prof.
Harry Edwards so correctly articu
lates, young people "should be in
spired, motivated, incited towards
academic excellence, whether an
athlete or not. The dumb jock is not
born, he is systematically created by
hindsight thinkers who only empha
size that these youngsters are un
able. Of course they would beable, if
the system would underscore
academics in junior high and high
school, to get them ready for the real
world." One should hope that the
combination of athletics and
academics would serve to heighten a
student's personal goals and
achievements, not function as an ex
cuse for shortcomings and in
adequacies in either area.
It is at Stanford that Boyer's belief
that true scholar-athletes live on
"Mt. Olympus or thereabouts" is
badly mistaken and in need of closer
examination. Better than at any
school across the nation, Stanford
has shown the country that both
high-level academics and NCAA
Championship athletics can coincide
on the same campus. Although his
article makes valid points, Boyer's di
rect advice to athletes to "remember
that the primary purpose for attend
ing Stanford is to get an education" is
both patronizing and degrading to
myself and other Stanford student
athletes.
Athletes here have shown their ac
complishments and positive input to
the Stanford "experience" both in
and out of the classroom and will
continue to do so in the future. A
primary reason for this result, and
the high percentage of athletes here
that go on to graduate school, is that
academic expectations are not low
ered here just because one has a
superior athletic skill.
It is in this manner that the combi
nation of athletics and academics
here presents perhaps the greatest
challenge that can be found on any
collegiate campus. No other school
provides the opportunities and in
centives that are crucial to both ath
letic and academic excellence — but
it is vital that the student-athlete here
understands the special place that
he/she holds in the collegiate envi
ronment.
lust as another student is gifted in
music or the arts, athletic ability that
has been developed over the years of
one's life is but a talent that must be
kept in perspective with one's own
contribution to society. In both
academic and athletic exertion to
ward excellence, the highest reward
for this effort is not what the indi
vidual gets for it but what he be
comes by it. It is through this en
thusiastic attitude in all areas of col
lege life that the challenge of
superior performance can be upheld
at Stanford — bv both those who do

and do not compete within the athle
tic environment.
As shared by many of my fellow
classmates, my experience concern
ing the positive impact of intercol
legiate athletics on my Stanford
"education" cannot be overempha
sized. To be certain, there have been
various afternoon classes that I
would have liked to have taken dur
ing my first three years here that ath
letic practice has denied. Many sac
rifices have been made, organization
has been crucial, and perhaps an op
portunity here and there has been
unavoidably missed. But the oppor
tunity to pursue academic and athle
tic excellence simultaneously against
the best in each category is a chal
lenge that perhaps a setting as
stimulating as Stanford can only pro
vide.
I know what it feels like to be on a
national championship team and I
know what it is like to debate an intel
lectual subject; both experiences
add to the enjoyment and personal
enrichment of my time here. As
Boyer clearly points out, to get the
most out of Stanford, one must con
scientiously strive to put the most
into Stanford — whet her he or she be
a serious athlete or not.
Although we are obviously not be
yond fault, the student-athlete here
has shown the nation throughout the
years that academics and athletics
can be a complementary and com
patible mix. Because those with ath
letic skills are not separated and iso
lated from other students, under
graduates here can both learn and
share their interests with other tal
ented and energetic students from
all backgrounds. Since expectations
of academic performance are not
lowered just because you can catch a
football or hit a tennis ball, student
athletes here have the unique oppor
tunity to be scholar-athletes if they
accept this exciting challenge.
As the competitive and enthusias
tic exertion applied to intercollegiate
athletics can in turn perpetuate de
sire to pursue academic goals, and
vice-versa, Stanford exemplifies to
colleges across the country that intel
lectual expectations can be
heightened without disrupting athle
tic performance. Through the dedi
cation and commitmentof University
administrators, coaches and stu
dents to the pursuit of this combined
excellence, let us continue to strive
to be a standard for the proper bal
ance of collegiate athletic and
academic endeavors.
