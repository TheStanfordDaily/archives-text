## Tresidder 'robber-barons' squelch competition 
### 
The article about Tresidder and
departmental lounges (Daily, April 6)
illuminates the reality that Tresidder
Union seeks an uncontested
monopoly over all cash food sales on
campus. The proposals made at the
Feb. 16 Tresidder Hoard meeting
recommend that Tresidder run all
cash food sales on campus and that
new food operations not be allowed
to compete with existing facilities.
That such ideas were even dis
cussed is inconceivable. This is Stan
ford, 1983, remember? . . . the egg
from which hatched the Silicon Val
ley, the home of the entrepreneur
and bastion of free enterprise. The
infamous days of Uncle Eeland's as
sociation with Crocker, Hopkins,
and Huntington are history ... or
are they?
Tresidder claims to foster entre
preneurial activity such as the Corner
Pot ket. Notice, however, that it's en
trepreneurial activity within the exist
ing Tresidder structure. Tresidder

Union is a monopolistic leech which
seeks to tap the wealth of ideas and
energy of the Stanford community.
Change and competition are two
things that the Tresidder manage
ment fears most. Rocking the boat is
not permitted; that is why Encina Sta
tion has never gotten off the ground.
A keg does not transform a sterile
cafeteria into a pub. Several people
(myself in< luded) have sought to
make Encina a bona fide student pub
— an improvement that would
necessitate genuine change — but
the powers that be at Tresidder have
always put the kibosh on.
Inherent to the concept of entre
preneurialism is competition and the
opportunity to manage one's own
enterprise. The independent de
partmental lounges are organized in
this spirit, and the University should
not allow the Tresidder monopoly to
absorb them, nor should new enter
prises be required to operate within
the Tresidder bureaucracy. Remov

ing competition would eliminate
whatever incentive Tresidder now
has to provide better food and would
make a mockery of the University's
entrepreneurial reputation.
It's high time we stop the Neo-
Robber Barons of Tresidder!

Bikes at Green
As I looked out the window from
my carrel on Green Library's third
floor, I was amazed at the great
number of bicycles parked im
mediately in front of the library,
blocking access to the ramp and to
the designated bike parking area. I
was troubled by the obstacle they
presented for several people need
ing to use the ramp or wanting to
park a bike in the proper place.
To be sure, it is a small area to fit
the many bikes riden to this destina
tion, and it is understandable to want

to deposit a bike as quickly and as
close to the door as possible. But
please be considerate of others
needing to get to the library who re
quire access to the ramp. Park your
bike away from the steps and the
ramp, preferably in the designated
areas. It is a small action for each
person to take, but it can help many
in a large way.

Collman support
I am writing to express my support
for Chemistry Prof, lames Collman
and proctoring. Cheaters are the
only ones who should feel
threatened by proctoring—
unfortunately, they make it neces
sary. When cheaters are eliminated,
then proctoring can be as well.
