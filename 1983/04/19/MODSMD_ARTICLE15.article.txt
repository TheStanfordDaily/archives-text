# Gandhi: legacy of nonviolence
## 
### 
The movie Gandhi was honored at
last week's Academy Awards cere
mony with eight Oscars. For most of
us, who were not around in the
period between the early 1920s and
late 19405, Mohandas Gandhi was,
prior to this film, merely one among
many political leaders who, like
Roosevelt, Mao, Hitler and others,
make a significant impact on the his
tory of this country.
A closer look at the life and ac
complishments of the Mahatma
demonstrate that he contributed
enormously to the establishment of
peace and freedom not only in India
but throughout the world. The politi
cal significance of his actions is re
flected, in part, in the inspiration that
many subsequent leaders have re
ceived from his legacy. Gandhi ad
dressed the crucial question of
whether political change should be
pursued within the structure of the
existing governmental system or
outside of it and whether or not the
recourse to violence was ever neces
sary or justified in order to achieve
equality, justice or freedom.
It would be interesting to apply his
thinking to the analysis of some of
the problems that have confronted
humankind in the last part of the
20th century. Was the strength
of his "non-violence at all costs" phi
losophy a result of the specific his
toric, cultural and political realitiesof
colonial India and as such is not ap
plicable to other periods of history?
The American Civil Rights move
ment stands as one of the strongest
testimonies of the influence of Gan
dhi on the modern world. In fact,
Martin Luther King in Stride Toward
Freedom confesses that:
"(t)he intellectual and moral satis
faction that I failed to gain from the
utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill
(and) the revolutionary methods of

Marx and Lenin, I found in the non
violent resistance philosophy of
Gandhi. I came to feel that this was
the only morally and practically
sound method open to oppressed
people in their struggle for free
dom."
Undoubtedly, the monumental
task, as Hodding Carter points out in
The Wall Street Journal, "of forcing
America to face up to the inherent
contradiction of a South which lived
by a code of white supremacy within
a nation whose basic documents
spoke to the equality of all men
would not have had the same impact
on American society if a path other
than that of active civil disobedience
had been followed."
What about the plight of the people
of Afghanistan? According to Professor
Gene Sharp, a renowned Gandhi
scholar, from the perspective of the
philosophy of non-violence, war,
tyranny and oppression should be

equality, justice or freedom.

fought with similar methods. But
would it be rational for the Mujihad
den rebels to lay down their arms by
using methods of passive resistance?
The continuing war between the
government of Great Britain and the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) over the
independence of Northern Ireland
which has resulted in more than 2000
deaths stands as one of the most hor
rifying demonstrations of what poli
tics through violence will achieve.
The IRA's stated goal is to wage "a

war of national liberation" against
the colonial power of England. In
other words, IRA leaders are willing
to sacrifice peace in order to gain
freedom. At the other end of the
spectrum are the British who are
striving for a peaceful solution to the
conflict without considering the im
portance that freedom and unity
have for the Irish people. The tradi
tion of democracy within both the Re
public of Ireland and Great Britain
would allow for a negotiated solu
tion to the problem of separation.
But tor this to occur violence would
have to stop.
Perhaps, Gandhi was, as some his
torians have argued, a man ahead of
his time. His goal to remove political
violence from society remains still a
dream. India in the '30s and '40s might
have constituted the historical ex
ception in which people accepted
non-violence instead of violence
as a practical course of political ac-

tion. I don't support this view. Gan
dhi was more than a dreamer, he be
lieved that men and women would
meet the challenge to alter their at
titude towards violence. The time
when freedom and peace can be pre
served and extended to the whole
world is near. Hopefully we will wit
ness it within our lifetime.

Scratching the surface
The movie Gandhi was honored at
last week's Academy Awards cere
mony with eight Oscars. For most of
us, who were not around in the
period between the early 1920s and
late 19405, Mohandas Gandhi was,
prior to this film, merely one among
many political leaders who, like
Roosevelt, Mao, Hitler and others,
make a significant impact on the his
tory of this country.
A closer look at the life and ac
complishments of the Mahatma
demonstrate that he contributed
enormously to the establishment of
peace and freedom not only in India
but throughout the world. The politi
cal significance of his actions is re
flected, in part, in the inspiration that
many subsequent leaders have re
ceived from his legacy. Gandhi ad
dressed the crucial question of
whether political change should be
pursued within the structure of the
existing governmental system or
outside of it and whether or not the
recourse to violence was ever neces
sary or justified in order to achieve
equality, justice or freedom.
It would be interesting to apply his
thinking to the analysis of some of
the problems that have confronted
humankind in the last part of the
20th century. Was the strength
of his "non-violence at all costs" phi
losophy a result of the specific his
toric, cultural and political realitiesof
colonial India and as such is not ap
plicable to other periods of history?
The American Civil Rights move
ment stands as one of the strongest
testimonies of the influence of Gan
dhi on the modern world. In fact,
Martin Luther King in Stride Toward
Freedom confesses that:
"(t)he intellectual and moral satis
faction that I failed to gain from the
utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill
(and) the revolutionary methods of

Marx and Lenin, I found in the non
violent resistance philosophy of
Gandhi. I came to feel that this was
the only morally and practically
sound method open to oppressed
people in their struggle for free
dom."
Undoubtedly, the monumental
task, as Hodding Carter points out in
The Wall Street Journal, "of forcing
America to face up to the inherent
contradiction of a South which lived
by a code of white supremacy within
a nation whose basic documents
spoke to the equality of all men
would not have had the same impact
on American society if a path other
than that of active civil disobedience
had been followed."
What about the plight of the people
of Afghanistan? According to Professor
Gene Sharp, a renowned Gandhi
scholar, from the perspective of the
philosophy of non-violence, war,
tyranny and oppression should be

equality, justice or freedom.

fought with similar methods. But
would it be rational for the Mujihad
den rebels to lay down their arms by
using methods of passive resistance?
The continuing war between the
government of Great Britain and the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) over the
independence of Northern Ireland
which has resulted in more than 2000
deaths stands as one of the most hor
rifying demonstrations of what poli
tics through violence will achieve.
The IRA's stated goal is to wage "a

war of national liberation" against
the colonial power of England. In
other words, IRA leaders are willing
to sacrifice peace in order to gain
freedom. At the other end of the
spectrum are the British who are
striving for a peaceful solution to the
conflict without considering the im
portance that freedom and unity
have for the Irish people. The tradi
tion of democracy within both the Re
public of Ireland and Great Britain
would allow for a negotiated solu
tion to the problem of separation.
But tor this to occur violence would
have to stop.
Perhaps, Gandhi was, as some his
torians have argued, a man ahead of
his time. His goal to remove political
violence from society remains still a
dream. India in the '30s and '40s might
have constituted the historical ex
ception in which people accepted
non-violence instead of violence
as a practical course of political ac-

tion. I don't support this view. Gan
dhi was more than a dreamer, he be
lieved that men and women would
meet the challenge to alter their at
titude towards violence. The time
when freedom and peace can be pre
served and extended to the whole
world is near. Hopefully we will wit
ness it within our lifetime.
