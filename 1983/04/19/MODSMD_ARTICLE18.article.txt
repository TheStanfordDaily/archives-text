# Administration inbreeding: Stanford grads who have become administrators
## PAST PRESENT 
### JONATHAN LUTZ 
There is absolutely no policy preference to Stanford graduates,"
said the University's manager of employment, though adding that
in practice it has turned out that it can be a positive influence/' So
why are there so many ex-Stanford students working here? They
love Stanford.

As any number of people on
the admissions staff, in the
provost's office, or in the office
of development will attest,
graduating from Stanford does
not necessarily mean leaving
Stanford.
Although no statistics are
available on the total number
of ex-Stanford students who
are now administrators here,
spot checks with various of
fices revealed that they are
numerous. Five out of nine of
the professional staff in the
Admissions Office are Stanford
graduates; and the proportion
in the Office of Residential
Education, is four out of eight.
Other admininstrative of
fices have had varying num
bers — some none — but a
couple have a significant
number: in the Office of Man
agement and Budget, five of 13
administrators are from Stan
ford, and in the Office of Public
Affairs, the proportion is three
out of five.
Though the number of Stan
ford grads in the University
administration is large, this is
not unusual, according to
Robert Freelen, acting vice
president of the Office of Pub
lic Affairs and Stanford grad. "If
anything, the University ad
ministration is less ingrown
now than it was 20 years ago.
It's just an accident of history
that there are fewer now than
before."
Joseph Jedd, bursar, agreed.
"The number varies. It's just a
coincidence." Jedd himself has
only two Stanford graduates in
an office of 27 people, seeming
to confirm what he said.
"There is absolutely no pol
icy preference to Stanford
graduates," said Linda Haynes,
manager of employment,
speaking about Stanford's hir
ingpractices. "In practice it has
turned out that (having been a
Stanford student) can be a
positive influence, but there's
no official policy," she said.
Why then are there so many
ex-Stanford students still work
ing at Stanford? No policy
statement has been issued, no
formal declarations have been
made. What then can it be?
Talking with several students
turned-administrators, the an
swer becomes obvious: these
people love Stanford.
Bob Freelen, currently acting
vice president of the Office of
Public Affairs, is a representa

tive example of a Stanford stu
dent turned administrator. At
graduation he had no intention
of eventually working for his
alma mater. The first two years
after he received his MBA from
Stanford in 1959 were spent in
the army and in the mortgage
banking business in San Fran
cisco. He was "not captivated"
by the latter, so when he heard
about a position open in Stan
ford's first Capital Campaign,
hetook it.Thiswasin 1961,and
he's been here ever since.
"Gratified" was the word
Freelen used in speaking about
his long association with Stan
ford — gratified that there have
always been different and new
things for him to work on here.
He has worked for the office of
development, the alumni as
sociation, and the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs.
Freelen said, "My purpose
here is not to re-live my stu
dent days," but he said he does
enjoy seeing faces he has
known since then. Among
them are Henry Riggs, profes
sor of industrial engineering,
John Hays, the director of the
major gifts section of the Office
of Development, and Bruce
Hinchliffe, director of corpo
rate relations, who used to live
across the hall from him.
Noel Kolak graduated from
Stanford in 1968 with a B.A. in
French. She, like Freelen, had
no expectation of working for
Stanford. "While I was looking
for a job in the area, though, a
friend told meabout a secretar
ial job at the Faculty Club. I
took the job for the time being,
but ended up staying two
years," said Kolak. Two years
later she began work at Tresid
der Union , and in 1972, ir« what
she described as the "signifi
cant change," she moved to
the position of supervisor in
the president's office.
Now an assistant provost,
Kolak said, "having been here
as a student gives me a greater
feeling of loyalty and dedica
tion toward the University than
I would have had coming from
the outside." This sense of
identity with the place, and her
fond memories of it, "leave me
wanting to do all that I can per
sonally for the University," she
added. This aspect of the job is
perhaps all the more important
to her because as a student,
she had little contact with the
administration and its work

ings. Finally, working with
other administrators who were
also Stanford students, leads to
a "higher level of commitment
because we have a common
base and shared experiences,"
she concluded.
One of these students
turned-administrators is Robin
Hamill, also a member of the
class of '68, and a graduate of
the Law School, class of '78.
Takingabreak from theworkat
her law firm in Los Angeles, she
came back to campus in Sep
tember of 1980 to visit former
law professors, and seek ad
vice on changing careers.
When Joel Smith, then vice
president of development and
a friend of Hamill's, asked her
what she would like to be do
ing, she replied, "I'd like to be
riding my bike to work every
day like you!" In response,
Smith offered her a position in
the Office of Development. She
accepted. "It was the best
thing I've ever done," she said.
Working with former class
mates is "wonderful, and not at
all like an old boys' network,"
she added.
To have been here as a stu
dent also gives a "sense of
what the place is all about," ac
cording to Wayne Price, as
sociate provost and graduate
of the Class of '65. The fact that
he knows people throughout
the campus helps him deal
with the variety of administra
tive tasks that come his way, a
job which he describes loosely
as "problem-solving through
out the University."
It is perhaps because he is
now on the inside of this vast
administrative apparatus that
Price considers Stanford to be
a more corr\p\Vcateci place lhan
it was when he was a student.
But in any case, he calls it "my
place to be" and feels "terrific"
to have been here the last 20
years.
Michelle Fisher, who studied
at the Tours campus at the
same time as Kolak, and who
also graduated with the Class
of'6B, is now the director of the
Center for Teaching and Learn
ing. Reflecting on 20 years of
the "Stanford experience,"
she gave the simplest and most
convincing explanantion of
administrative in-breeding:
"What's most remarkable
(about Stanford) is what hasn't
changed. It's still an incredibly
satisfying place to be."

no official policy," she said.
Why then are there so many
ex-Stanford students still work
ing at Stanford? No policy
statement has been issued, no
formal declarations have been
made. What then can it be?
Talking with several students
turned-administrators, the an
swer becomes obvious: these
people love Stanford.
Bob Freelen, currently acting
vice president of the Office of
Public Affairs, is a representa

tive example of a Stanford stu
dent turned administrator. At
graduation he had no intention
of eventually working for his
alma mater. The first two years
after he received his MBA from
Stanford in 1959 were spent in
the army and in the mortgage
banking business in San Fran
cisco. He was "not captivated"
by the latter, so when he heard
about a position open in Stan
ford's first Capital Campaign,
hetook it.Thiswasin 1961,and
he's been here ever since.
"Gratified" was the word
Freelen used in speaking about
his long association with Stan
ford — gratified that there have
always been different and new
things for him to work on here.
He has worked for the office of
development, the alumni as
sociation, and the Office of the
Dean of Student Affairs.
Freelen said, "My purpose
here is not to re-live my stu
dent days," but he said he does
enjoy seeing faces he has
known since then. Among
them are Henry Riggs, profes
sor of industrial engineering,
John Hays, the director of the
major gifts section of the Office
of Development, and Bruce
Hinchliffe, director of corpo
rate relations, who used to live
across the hall from him.
Noel Kolak graduated from
Stanford in 1968 with a B.A. in
French. She, like Freelen, had
no expectation of working for
Stanford. "While I was looking
for a job in the area, though, a
friend told meabout a secretar
ial job at the Faculty Club. I
took the job for the time being,
but ended up staying two
years," said Kolak. Two years
later she began work at Tresid
der Union , and in 1972, ir« what
she described as the "signifi
cant change," she moved to
the position of supervisor in
the president's office.
Now an assistant provost,
Kolak said, "having been here
as a student gives me a greater
feeling of loyalty and dedica
tion toward the University than
I would have had coming from
the outside." This sense of
identity with the place, and her
fond memories of it, "leave me
wanting to do all that I can per
sonally for the University," she
added. This aspect of the job is
perhaps all the more important
to her because as a student,
she had little contact with the
administration and its work

ings. Finally, working with
other administrators who were
also Stanford students, leads to
a "higher level of commitment
because we have a common
base and shared experiences,"
she concluded.
One of these students
turned-administrators is Robin
Hamill, also a member of the
class of '68, and a graduate of
the Law School, class of '78.
Takingabreak from theworkat
her law firm in Los Angeles, she
came back to campus in Sep
tember of 1980 to visit former
law professors, and seek ad
vice on changing careers.
When Joel Smith, then vice
president of development and
a friend of Hamill's, asked her
what she would like to be do
ing, she replied, "I'd like to be
riding my bike to work every
day like you!" In response,
Smith offered her a position in
the Office of Development. She
accepted. "It was the best
thing I've ever done," she said.
Working with former class
mates is "wonderful, and not at
all like an old boys' network,"
she added.
To have been here as a stu
dent also gives a "sense of
what the place is all about," ac
cording to Wayne Price, as
sociate provost and graduate
of the Class of '65. The fact that
he knows people throughout
the campus helps him deal
with the variety of administra
tive tasks that come his way, a
job which he describes loosely
as "problem-solving through
out the University."
It is perhaps because he is
now on the inside of this vast
administrative apparatus that
Price considers Stanford to be
a more corr\p\Vcateci place lhan
it was when he was a student.
But in any case, he calls it "my
place to be" and feels "terrific"
to have been here the last 20
years.
Michelle Fisher, who studied
at the Tours campus at the
same time as Kolak, and who
also graduated with the Class
of'6B, is now the director of the
Center for Teaching and Learn
ing. Reflecting on 20 years of
the "Stanford experience,"
she gave the simplest and most
convincing explanantion of
administrative in-breeding:
"What's most remarkable
(about Stanford) is what hasn't
changed. It's still an incredibly
satisfying place to be."

There is absolutely no policy preference to Stanford graduates,"
said the University's manager of employment, though adding that
in practice it has turned out that it can be a positive influence/' So
why are there so many ex-Stanford students working here? They
love Stanford.

As any number of people on
the admissions staff, in the
provost's office, or in the office
of development will attest,
graduating from Stanford does
not necessarily mean leaving
Stanford.
Although no statistics are
available on the total number
of ex-Stanford students who
are now administrators here,
spot checks with various of
fices revealed that they are
numerous. Five out of nine of
the professional staff in the
Admissions Office are Stanford
graduates; and the proportion
in the Office of Residential
Education, is four out of eight.
Other admininstrative of
fices have had varying num
bers — some none — but a
couple have a significant
number: in the Office of Man
agement and Budget, five of 13
administrators are from Stan
ford, and in the Office of Public
Affairs, the proportion is three
out of five.
Though the number of Stan
ford grads in the University
administration is large, this is
not unusual, according to
Robert Freelen, acting vice
president of the Office of Pub
lic Affairs and Stanford grad. "If
anything, the University ad
ministration is less ingrown
now than it was 20 years ago.
It's just an accident of history
that there are fewer now than
before."
Joseph Jedd, bursar, agreed.
"The number varies. It's just a
coincidence." Jedd himself has
only two Stanford graduates in
an office of 27 people, seeming
to confirm what he said.
"There is absolutely no pol
icy preference to Stanford
graduates," said Linda Haynes,
manager of employment,
speaking about Stanford's hir
ingpractices. "In practice it has
turned out that (having been a
