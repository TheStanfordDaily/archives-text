# Hoover Institution: a brief history
## 
### KIMBERLEY BROWN MICHAEL CALABRESE 
The Hoover Institution was founded in 1919 as the
repository for documents from the Peace Conference
in Versailles. Herbert Hoover personally financed the
collection of documents to help scholars study the
causes and consequences of World War I. The collec
tion quickly became the nation's largest private arc
hive and home to a priceless collection of Nazi and
Russian historical documents.
Former President Hoover remained influential in
the affairs of the Institution and University until his
death in 1964. In a pamphlet prepared for the Stan
ford Board of Trustees in 1959, Hoover wrote that
"The purpose of this Institution must be, by its re
search and publications, to demonstrate the evils of
the doctrines of Karl Marx — whether Communism,
Socialism, economic materialism, or atheism — thus
to protect the American way of life from such
ideologies, their conspiracies, and to reaffirm the
validity of the American system."
That statement of the Institution's purpose created
only the less telling of two controversies that year
between the former president, the faculty and the
university president. Hoover ignored the existence of
a faculty-administration search committee to person
ally select Glenn Campbell, a 35-year-old Tanadian

born economist, as the new director. Campbell had
taught economics at Harvard for five years and had
worked for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce before
becoming research director at the American Enter
prise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washing
ton, D.C. that is not connected to a university.
Campbell not only succeeded in raising large sums
from Packard and from conservative foundations
such as the Scaife Family Charitable Trusts of
Pittsburgh, but he also recruited for the Institution's
board high-ranking executives from corporations in
cluding Mobil Oil, Stanford Oil, General Electric and
the Adolph Coors Company.
Kennedy is the only Stanford faculty member or
administrator on the Hoover Board of Overseers. He
is not an officer. The faculty petition notes that the
officers of the Institution comprise 18 non
academics, all white, male, and none of whom are
affiliated with Stanford University. Of the 68 mem
bers of Hoover's Board of Overseers, all are white, 95
percent are male, the 90 percent who list occupations
are corporate affiliated, and 5 percent appear to have
some relation to academic, although only Kennedy is
from Stanford (two represent the University of
Southern California), according to the 1982 Hoover
Annual Report and the faculty petition.
