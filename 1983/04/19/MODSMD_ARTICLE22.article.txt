## 'Spring break' at the meat market-with vegetables 
### RICHARD KYLBERG 
The only question which remains to be answered after
102 minutes of Spring Break is whether it is a tilm about
meat or vegetables. Everyone in the film is a vegetable
lost in a display of meat.
Spring Rreak supposedly portrays college vacations in
Ft. Lauderdale. Producer Sean Cunningham and writer
David Smilow offer an ideal vacation of abusing women,
driving drunk, smoking pot on a beach, and viewing wet
t-shirt extravaganzas (as Smilow puts it, "what America is
all about").
Nelson and Adam (played by David Knell and Perry
Lang respectively) rent an overbooked motel room
which they are forced to share with Stu and O.T. (Paul
Land and Steve Bassett). The film doesn't get much bet
ter — Nelson's step-father (Donald Symington) is a
cutthroat (also the name of his yacht) politician who
wants to ruin everyone's fun by closing the motel. But
stay seated, for Nelson gets his pants torn off by an
alligator, O.T. wins a bellyflop competition, Stu is a
finalist in a wet he-shirt contest, Adam says something
intelligent ("Let's get out of here"), the bad guys get
seltzer and pies in their faces, and, most importantly,
our friends lose their virginity. Sound similar to your
spring vacation?
Not since Quest for Fire has anyone more accurately
portrayed neanderthals. Nelson gets locked in a cabin
on his stepfather's yacht and doesn't realize (neither
does Cunningham) that the locks are on the inside of the
door. Joan (Corinne Alphen of Penthouse) wears
sunglasses in a dark bar. O.T. grunts through most of the
film, and any slice of dialogue could easily take place
around a prehistoric campfire ("Adam, I'm not an ani

mal," "You fat jerk," "Whereveryou look . . .skin, skin,
skin," et al).
Director of photography Steven Poster truly gives new
meaning to the bust shot. Poster develops a between
the-legs bust shot, an over-the-shoulder bust shot, highl
and low-angle bust shots, behind-the-back bust shots,
and so on. He then applies this technique to his pelvic
shots. Indeed, he individually lines up bodily bits to
create an anatomic masterpiece, and it becomes hard to
believe that people would allow a few strange men with
a camera to take pictures of them like this. These shots
make Spring Break a pornographic film where, in most
cases, Cunningham simply forgot to tell the actors to
take off their clothes.

Henry Manfredini's music works well with the script,
acting, and camera to add insult to this injury. When the
boys are chased around by the step-father's henchmen
in the grand finale, we hear a tune that pops like al
kaseltzer entitled, "Here Comes Trouble." Joan's rock
group, the"Hot Dames," mouth the words to"l Wantto
Do It to You" while they threaten to explode tiny bits of
swimsuit all over the screen. Although they might want
to, the "Hot Dames" never do anything to us, and
neither does Spring Break.
