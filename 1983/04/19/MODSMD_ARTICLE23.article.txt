Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul
Bv STEFAN MALMOLI
This review is supposed to be about Little
Steven and the Disciples of Soul's concert,
but it is really a statement on the endless
powers of rock and roll. "Little Steven'' is
none other than "Miami" Steve Van Zandt,
who is a talented artist, producer and writer,
as well as being the guitarist of Bruce
Springsteen's E Street Band. However,
though Van Zandt's own musical ability is
outstanding (as this show was to prove), it is
his association with Springsteen that gener
ated enough interest in his solo career to sell
out the Old Waldorf. It must, therefore, be
hard to play crowds who for the most part
are wearing "Bruce" shirts and who are pray
ing for Bruce to make one of his rare surprise
appearances (as happened with Bruce's sax
man, Clarence Clemons, at his Keystone
Palo Alto show last December). However,
just as Clarence demons' soulful perform
ance proved to be musically special in its
own right, so too was Little Steven's.

As the band (more like a commando
squad) entered the stage, one was im
mediately struck with a vision of the
apocalypse. The nine-member outfit was
draped in long, black leather jackets, with
each musician adding his own special touch
to create an atmosphere of a gang ready for a
fight — ripped T-shirts, bandanas, metal
chains and bracelets, sleeveless vests and
unshaven faces. They carried their instru
ments as if they were weapons of destruc
tion rather than objects that made music.
They all looked as if they were the last re
maining defenders of rock and roll. Finally,
they exploded into action with "Lyin' In A
Bed Of Fire" and three other dynamic tunes
off their debut album, Men Without
Women, which thoroughly demonstrated
that they were capable of protecting the rock
and roll cause.
The music was played at full throttle with
an intensity that reflected a life-and-death
situation. One had to see and hear this band
for the total effect. Imagine, horn players
dancing wildly, swinging their instruments
in chaotic unison (especially La Bamba, the

trombonist of the Asbury )ukes); imagine,
the meanest looking "Mother" (part of Little
Steven's intro) of a banjo player, hitting a
cymbal continually with his bare hands;
imagine, a drummer (former Rascals'
drummer Dino Danelli) dressed in an outfit
that resembled black armor; imagine, a bass
player (Jean Beauvoir of the Plasmatics) with
a shaven black head except for a streak of

7f wasn't just Steve Van Zandt
and a back-up band-It was a
band of equals, each giving his
all for the common cause of
rock and roll/

blond hair running down the middle; and
finally, imagine, a bandana-headed, gypsy
looking guitarist with feathered earring,
wailing in his off-key voice while flashing his
guitar just like a switchblade (to paraphrase
Springsteen). These guys meant to kill, and
they intended to have you either dancing or
dying on the floor.

Whether it was a song off the Disciples
album, ancient Asbury )uke fanfares (like "I
Don't Wanna Go Home"), or basic soul clas
sics (like Otis Redding's "Respect"), the
band never once failed to generate its dis
tinctive powerhouse sound. It was a live,
Phil Spectorized "Wall of Sound," and the
sound system surprisingly captured all of the
emotional verve present on the stage. Each
musician was heard fully (which is pretty
amazing for a keyboardist, percussionist,
drummer, bassist, guitarist, four horn
players and a guest oboist), and the musi
cians combined to complement each other
perfectly.
The musical focal point, though, was the
vigor and heart that everyone thrust into
each song. It wasn't just Steve Van Zandt and
a back-up band. It was a band of equals, each
giving his all for the common cause of rock
and roll. The finest example of this musical
camaraderie was present on a very scary,
apocalyptic instrumental written by Duke El
lington, called "Caravan." Sounding like the
Arabian Nights done rock electric style, the
band whipped itself and the audience into a

hypnotic frenzy that was the most captivat
ing moment of the evening. Other high
lights included a far more passionate version
of "Angel Eyes" (from Men Without
Women), a great rendition of one of the As
bury Jukes' best songs, "This Time It's For
Real" (written by Van Zandt), and a blistering
closing one-two punch of "Respect" and
Marvin Gaye's "Can I Get A Witness?"
Such an amount of energy and drive was
exemplified in those last two songs that,
even though the show was a bit shorter than
I expected (only 80 minutes), they still
proved themselves worthy of the crowd's
admiration. This was rock and roll with a
meaning. This was no fooling around. They
came to draw blood and they left the audi
ence bleeding for more. They, in other
words, lived up to the inherent power of
rock and roll. They showed an intense belief
and compassion for rock and roll, and they
proved that rock and roll could be a vitaliz
ing force even in 80 minutes. Thank you,
Litte Steven — you made all of us at the show
feel like we were "disciples of soul," fighting
for the cause.
