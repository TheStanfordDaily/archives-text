# His world and welcome to it: Culture's Hill meets the ants
## 
### JOHN NORDELL 
Midway through its long set
last Sunday at the Keystone
Palo Alto, halfway through a
song, Culture's lead singer
Joseph Hill suddenly motioned
for the band to cut the music.

As the energy in the club fell to
zero, Hill fell to his knees and
solemnly intoned: "I've got
some terrible news for you . . .
terrible news. I must leave the
stage right now." As he then
strode towards backstage, the
audience members quizzically

eyed one another. Ah, ha. Hill
wheeled around, flashed a
toothy grin and the band struck
up the beat again.
Unpredictability combined
with mystic charm only begins
to capture the character of
Joseph Hill. Whether onstage,
in interview or hanging out
with his band, Hill acts as he
wants and with considerable
energy. He appears as natural
and as comfortable sitting on a
monitor while singing on
stage, sitting in the middle of a
San Francisco street, rapping
on his drum, strumming his
guitar, or reclining in a large
chair singing harmony over a
record.
We asked Hill to define cul
ture: "(It is a) trueconcept. Liv
ing, live right. Be good, and if
you can't be good, be careful.
Culture . . . is . . . every be
ginning of every natural posi
tive resource. Every man who
has got a testimony must have
gottheirculture. And acountry
without culture is no country
and a music without culture is
no music."
Hill later elaborated further
on the concept, his voice rang
ing from a whisper to a shout:
"For instance: Once ago when
I was really getting down to ful
fill the name Culture, learning
the meaning of culture . . . it's
like I gather a whole lot of
things from an ant nest. . . .
There used to be one in the
middle of my yard and every

time a certain set of people go
there, even if kids go there to
stir them up without a cause,
then they will get up and bite!
And I could go right in the

middle and sit, they do noth
ing. Why? I didn't eat all the
food in the house and wait for
them to walk all the way from
the nest all the time. I put a
little crumb all the time at the
head of the hole. And they are
so sensitive that they know
these 10 kind fingers. You bet
ter believe it! So because of
that I wrote a song: 'I love to
feed the ants because they are

united./ I love to feed the ants
because they live better than
man.' "
The virtues of ganja are extol
led in Culture's song "Interna-

tional Herb." During the inter
view Hill explained the medita
tional and medicinal uses of
marijuana, but added: "In a
country like my country and
even in this country too. I've
seen poor brothers, very poor
brothers, who do not believe
in excess vanity, but believe in
living decently and to create
. . . authentic manliness within
his family, yeah, to be respon

sible for his family. Now you
just can't do this without fi
nance according to the mod
ern system. . . . When all the
jobs say 'No,' you could sell a

bag of herb and get say $5 and
say 'Yes.' And the children stop
yearning. Free US . . . Cod, we
want ganja to be free on top of
the table."
Hill defined Rastafari as life
(Ras: head; tafari: creator). He
added that there is no god
greater than any one indi
vidual. "Or if (you) know of a
greater god than Mr. Reagan or
Edward Seaga or whoever it

may he (tell me). We are all
gods, man. We are all god's
people. We should get to
gether and make it roll, make it
happen. We are the first agent
of earth and only we can make
it happen. Good Morning to
Mister Reagan." Laughter rip
pled from the interviewers to
the band members scattered
around the kitchen and living
room. "Good Morning, sir.
When you came to Jamaica you
did not say 'good morning
Joseph Hill.' Now I'm in
America, good morning Mr.
Reagan." More laughter. Hill
slaps five with rhythm guitarist
Jah Privie whose dreadlocks
reach to his waist. "I respect
you sir, do you respect me? I'm
having an apple."
"An American apple," inter
jected lead guitarist Freddy
Fatstring.
"Yeah an American apple,"
continued Hill, "which mean
it's your economy and when
you come to Jamaica, when
you smell the herb, you know
that it's my economy. Good
morning sir."
Joseph Hill is a non-stop en
tertaining performer. Whether
on the stage of the Keystone or
that of life, he radiates positive
energy. It's the only way he can
combat the greed, fighting and
hate he sees in the world and
pave the way towards unity and
understanding. We all have
something to learn from the
ants.

stage, sitting in the middle of a
San Francisco street, rapping
on his drum, strumming his
guitar, or reclining in a large
chair singing harmony over a
record.
We asked Hill to define cul
ture: "(It is a) trueconcept. Liv
ing, live right. Be good, and if
you can't be good, be careful.
Culture . . . is . . . every be
ginning of every natural posi
tive resource. Every man who
has got a testimony must have
gottheirculture. And acountry
without culture is no country
and a music without culture is
no music."
Hill later elaborated further
on the concept, his voice rang
ing from a whisper to a shout:
"For instance: Once ago when
I was really getting down to ful
fill the name Culture, learning
the meaning of culture . . . it's
like I gather a whole lot of
things from an ant nest. . . .
There used to be one in the
middle of my yard and every

time a certain set of people go
there, even if kids go there to
stir them up without a cause,
then they will get up and bite!
And I could go right in the

middle and sit, they do noth
ing. Why? I didn't eat all the
food in the house and wait for
them to walk all the way from
the nest all the time. I put a
little crumb all the time at the
head of the hole. And they are
so sensitive that they know
these 10 kind fingers. You bet
ter believe it! So because of
that I wrote a song: 'I love to
feed the ants because they are

united./ I love to feed the ants
because they live better than
man.' "
The virtues of ganja are extol
led in Culture's song "Interna-

tional Herb." During the inter
view Hill explained the medita
tional and medicinal uses of
marijuana, but added: "In a
country like my country and
even in this country too. I've
seen poor brothers, very poor
brothers, who do not believe
in excess vanity, but believe in
living decently and to create
. . . authentic manliness within
his family, yeah, to be respon

sible for his family. Now you
just can't do this without fi
nance according to the mod
ern system. . . . When all the
jobs say 'No,' you could sell a

bag of herb and get say $5 and
say 'Yes.' And the children stop
yearning. Free US . . . Cod, we
want ganja to be free on top of
the table."
Hill defined Rastafari as life
(Ras: head; tafari: creator). He
added that there is no god
greater than any one indi
vidual. "Or if (you) know of a
greater god than Mr. Reagan or
Edward Seaga or whoever it

may he (tell me). We are all
gods, man. We are all god's
people. We should get to
gether and make it roll, make it
happen. We are the first agent
of earth and only we can make
it happen. Good Morning to
Mister Reagan." Laughter rip
pled from the interviewers to
the band members scattered
around the kitchen and living
room. "Good Morning, sir.
When you came to Jamaica you
did not say 'good morning
Joseph Hill.' Now I'm in
America, good morning Mr.
Reagan." More laughter. Hill
slaps five with rhythm guitarist
Jah Privie whose dreadlocks
reach to his waist. "I respect
you sir, do you respect me? I'm
having an apple."
"An American apple," inter
jected lead guitarist Freddy
Fatstring.
"Yeah an American apple,"
continued Hill, "which mean
it's your economy and when
you come to Jamaica, when
you smell the herb, you know
that it's my economy. Good
morning sir."
Joseph Hill is a non-stop en
tertaining performer. Whether
on the stage of the Keystone or
that of life, he radiates positive
energy. It's the only way he can
combat the greed, fighting and
hate he sees in the world and
pave the way towards unity and
understanding. We all have
something to learn from the
ants.


Midway through its long set
last Sunday at the Keystone
Palo Alto, halfway through a
song, Culture's lead singer
Joseph Hill suddenly motioned
for the band to cut the music.

As the energy in the club fell to
zero, Hill fell to his knees and
solemnly intoned: "I've got
some terrible news for you . . .
terrible news. I must leave the
stage right now." As he then
strode towards backstage, the
audience members quizzically

eyed one another. Ah, ha. Hill
wheeled around, flashed a
toothy grin and the band struck
up the beat again.
Unpredictability combined
with mystic charm only begins
to capture the character of
Joseph Hill. Whether onstage,
in interview or hanging out
with his band, Hill acts as he
wants and with considerable
energy. He appears as natural
and as comfortable sitting on a
monitor while singing on
stage, sitting in the middle of a
San Francisco street, rapping
on his drum, strumming his
guitar, or reclining in a large
chair singing harmony over a
record.
