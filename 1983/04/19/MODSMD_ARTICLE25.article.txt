# Bittersweet dreams of U.K's Eurythmics
## 
### LAWRENCE HADDAD 
These days, when the faddish United
■ Kingdom charts are forcing modern
I Americans to scramble for their hairdryers
land makeup, it is refreshing to come
■ across a band that one suspects will en-
Idure more than one United States tour,
| and perhaps survive even the most in-
I different review Rolling Stone can muster.
II am talking about the Eurythmics, who are
I currently storming up the U.K. charts with
| the album and single Sweet Dreams Are
I Made of This.
Formed two years ago, the band is com
| prised of Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart
I of the now-defunct Tourists (remember "I
r Only Want To Be With You"?). On the road,
band includes Clem Burke from Blon
die on drums, Eddie Reader from the Gang
& of Four on backing vocals and Mickey Gal
lagher from lan Dury and the Blockheads

on keyboards.
Lennox and Stewart write about anar
chistic love. Witness "Love is a Stranger,"
the opening track, "Love is a stranger/In an
open car/To tempt you in/And drive you far
away." This song, the first U.K. single from
the album, is probably the lyrically
strongest effort here, describing the hurt,
anger and confusion that accompanies
terminal separation.
The relationship paranoia continues in
"The Walk," "I could be contented/I don't
need to suffer/You're beautiful/Good to
falk to/You make an impression/To take
my attention/And when you touch my
skin/I smell disaster." Other stand-out
tracks address changes and the associated
hopes and regrets. The emotional vio
lence of a band such as Joy Division is
absent, but neither is this pure, unadulter

ated fun.
While many of the songs dwell on these
rather morbid themes, optimism's flame
bums through frequently on tracks such
as "I've got an Angel" and "Wrap it Up." In
addition, none of the songs have the emo
tionless dirge-like qualities of some mod
ern music, but are instead upbeat and un
cluttered. Production is crisp and the pre
dominantly synthesizer instrumentation is
sparse. Lennox's singing is erethral yet
full, and displays a wide range (a la Grace
Jones). My only criticism concerns the
lyrics, which in general could be more
demanding.
Needless to say, this is an important al
bum. Hopefully the face of 1983 pop. Im
press your impressionable friends—pay
twice the price now, before the domestic
release of this rather eclectic work from
the Eurythmics.
