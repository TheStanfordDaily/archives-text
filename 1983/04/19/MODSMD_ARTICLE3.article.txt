# Tsongas blasts arms policy
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
President Reagan has "scared the
beejeezus out of the political cen
ter," and this is the main reason for
the rising opposition to his arms con
trol policies, Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-
Mass.) told about 150 people in Ter
man Auditorium yesterday.
The freshman senator managed to
poke fun at the Reagan administra
tion's arms control policies, Califor
nia and Under Secretary of Defense
T.K. Jones in an hour-long off-the
cuff speech to a receptive audience.
Saying California "will do penance
somewhere along the line" for pro
ducing public servants like Reagan,
former President Richard Nixon,
Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger and Jones, Tsongas portrayed

the American political spectrum as
analagous to a sailboat, with the
political center as the keel. Tempo
rary deviations from the center will
sway the political system over to one
side, but the center will react by
bringing political discussion back the
other direction.
Tsongas said the center is reacting
to Reagan's talk about a "limited nu
clear war" by becoming more in
terested in the nuclear freeze and
serious arms control policies.
"The center feels threatened," he
said.
He said the extensive opposition
to confirmation of right-winger Ken
neth Adelman as head of the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency
was an example of the center feeling
threatened. Adelman was confirmed

last week 57 to 42, and Tsongas was
one of the leading opponents.
"The country wants to cut back"
on the administration's weapons
buildup, Tsongas said, and the
movement to establish a mutually
verifiable nuclear freeze is is an
example of this.
Claiming that Reagan's opposition
to the freeze has bolstered the
movement, Tsongas said, "As Helen
Caldecott (a leading scientist in favor
of the freeze) is the mother of the
freeze, Reagan is the father."
The official title of Tsongas' speech
was "The Importance of Student In
volvement in Arms Control," and he
told the audience to "avoid discus
sion (on arms control) that smacks of
unilateral disarmament."
"You lose the center if you talk
about unilateral disarmament," he
said.
The senator also joked about
Jones' comment that in case of a nu
clear attack all Americans need to do
is dig a hole three feet deep, jump in
it and cover it with boards and dirt.
Tsongas, a member of the Foreign
Relations Committee, asked Jones in
a hearing "if we do what you say,
how do we get back in the hole''
once it's been covered with dirt. He
also asked Jones how, if a typical nu
clear explosion will create a hole 20()
feet deep, he would survive the 197-
foot drop after the bomb has
exploded.
The senator also blasted "Reagan's
Star Wars defense system," in refer
ence to the president's announce
ment last month encouraging scien
tists to step up research in space
based anti-ballistic missiles, because
it would destabilize arms control.
