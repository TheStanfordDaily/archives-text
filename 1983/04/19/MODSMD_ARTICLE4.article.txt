Bomb explodes in U.S. embassy
Beirut, Lebanon— A massive explosion, believed
caused by a suicide driver in an explosives-laden
truck, sheared off the front of the eight-story U.S. Em
bassy here yesterday, sending bodies flying from the
building and burying office workers under tons of
twisted steel and concrete.
Estimates of the number of dead ranged from 29 to
39; the wounded were believed to number about 100.
Rescue workers, using spotlights, searched the rubble
through the night, looking for more bodies.
There were conflicting reports about the number
of Americans killed, mainly because many bodies
were mutilated beyond recognition. A hospital
source said only nine of the bodies that had been

brought in were identified. There were reports here
that two to six of the U.S. Marines stationed at the em
bassy had been killed.
In Washington, however, Assistant Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger told reporters that it was
not known whether any Marines had been killed. He
said the deaths of six Americans had been confirmed
and that they were "two Foreign Service officers, two
members of the office of military cooperation on
temporary duty there, and two AID (Agency for In
ternational Development) employees."
A fundamentalist Moslem groupcalling itself the Is
lamic Struggle Organization quickly claimed respon
sibility for the explosion. According to one account,
the driver who detonated the explosives had sped
past unsuspecting Lebanese guards into the driveway
of the embassy compound. He was said to have deto
nated the explosives near the main entrance to the
building.
Ambassador Robert Dillon, the U.S. envoy here for
the last two years, was in his seventh-floor office at the
time of the blast. U.S. officials on the scene said he was
briefly trapped by fire and smoke but managed to
work his way down to the ground floor.
The blast occurred at 1:03 p.m. and its force sent
shock waves throughout the city, breaking windows
in homes and offices blocks away from the embassy. A
U.S. Navy officer on the U.S. aircraft carrier
Guadalcanal four miles offshore said the ship shud
dered from the force of the blast.
President Reagan yesterday condemned the bomb
ing of the American embassy in Beirut as a "vicious...
cowardly act," and he vowed that the heavy loss of life
would not deter the United States from "doing what
we know to be right" in the search for Mideast peace.
Reagan made that pledge as U.S. officials sought to
assess the toll of dead and injured. At the same time
the officials made clear that the president has no in
tention of permitting the tragedy to affect his efforts
to resolve the Lebanon crisis or the wider Arab-Israeli
conflict.
In particular, they stressed, Reagan is determined
not to let the terrorist attack force the withdrawal of
the 1200 U.S. Marines stationed in the Beirut area as
part of the multinational peace-keeping force.
The U.S. Embassy in Beirut had recently been for
tified against mob attacks, but was particularly vulner
able to the kind of terrorist bomb attack that shat
tered the embassy building yesterday.
Indeed, the Beirut embassy was considered a tem
porary facility, occupied under a short-term lease.
And, officials said, the nature of its site and construc
tion made it unsuitable for some of the precautions

taken at other American embassies to reduce their
vulnerability to terrorist bomb attacks.
The Beirut embassy was one of more than 150
American diplomatic posts identified by the State De
partment several years ago as "seriously threatened"
by local anti-American feeling or the presence of ter
rorist groups.
Under a $300 million State Department program
started after the 1979 mob attack and takeover of the
U.S. embassy in Tehran, the Beirut facility was one of a
number of American embassies that were strength
ened internally to help embassy personnel hold out
against mob attack until outside help could arrive.
Salvadoran minister resigns
San Salvador, El Salvador — The president he put
into office eased Defense Minister Jose Guillermo
Garcia out of his job yesterday.
President Alvaro Magana accepted a pro-forma res
ignation that Garcia had submitted to him last March
18 and told the Constituent Assembly that he was
naming Gen. Carlos Vides Casanova, commander of
the national guard, as Gen. Garcia's replacement.
Although many of Garcia's high-ranking officers
had been demanding his resignation, it was the threat
by the air force to mutiny if he did not quit that finally
forced Magana to accept Garcia's resignation.
It was also known that U.S. military attaches here
were unhappy with Garcia's conduct of El Salvador's
civil war, but Garcia said the U.S. Embassy had nothing
to do with his departure.
Garcia was one of the leaders of the coup of Octo
ber 1979 that ousted an undemocratic military gov
ernment. He was the only leader left of the junta that
took power and then subsequently dissolved into a
left-right confrontation that became today's 3-year
old civil war.
"I am leaving without rancor toward anyone," Gar
cia told a crowded news conference yesterday. He
said his resignation was for the good of the country

and "was necessary to resolve this problem," refer
ring to the air force mutiny threat.
Garcia said commanders of the major units in the
country had agreed to the decision that he leave. His
resignation had been rumored since January, when a
provincial commander he tried to reassign as military
attache to the Salvadoran Embassy in Uruguay agreed
to leave the country, but only if he received a post in
Washington and only if Garcia would also quit.
Garcia had been a strong backer of policies favored
by the United States. He helped rally military support
to save a sweeping plan for land reform. His support
— and his troops' fierce defense of polling places
against guerrilla attacks — made the elections of
March 1982 possible.
Walesa held by police again
Warsaw, Poland — Police detained labor leader
Lech Walesa for the second time within a week yester
day, stopping him near the northern city of Olsztyn as
he and three friends drove from Gdansk toward War
saw, where he planned to join observances honoring
the dead heroes of the 1943 Jewish ghetto uprising.
Olsztyn police released Walesa's family priest,
Father Henryk Jankowski, Walesa's driver, and anoth
er companion, after more than five hours of question
ing. But Walesa was held for nine hours. He was also
told to appear this morning at the Gdansk police sta
tion, his wife told Westerrn reporters by telephone.
She gave no further details of her husband's question
ing.
Walesa's detention was witnessed by members of
an American television crew who were in a car follow
ing Walesa and who were also briefly detained.
The incident occurred at about the same time that
visiting foreign Jewish leaders, here to attend an
elaborate commemoration of the 40th anniversary of
the ghetto uprising, had what one participant de
scribed as a cool meeting with Poland's premier and
Communist Party leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.

FBI spying curtailed -
Chicago — A federal judge yesterday barred the
Federal Bureau of Investigation from spying on
domestic political groups that advocate civil disobe
dience or other illegal acts and struck down new Rea
gan administration guidelines on the FBl's sur
veillance operations.
In a decision that eventually could have broad na
tional implications although it applies immediately
only to FBI investigations in northern Illinois, U.S. Dis
trict Judge Susan Getzendanner characterized the ad
ministration guidelines as so "lenient" that they
would allow the government to spy on activities pro
tected by the First Amendment.
The temporary injunction issued by the judge is ex
pected to spark other legal challenges nationwide to
the FBI guidelines, according to a spokesman for the
American Civil Liberties Union in Washington.
