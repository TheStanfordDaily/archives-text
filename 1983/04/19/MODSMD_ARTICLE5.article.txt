# Trustee inquiry into Institution requested
## Profs, question Hoover role 
### KIMBERLY BROWN MICHAEL CALABRESE 
The Hoover Institution's unique
and intermittently controversial rela
tionship with the University is being
challenged again, this time by a
group of tenured faculty who plan to
ask the Academic Senate to "urge the
Board of Trustees to initiate an im
mediate and Independent Inquiry,
including a public report, on the rela
tionship between the Hoover Institu
tion and Stanford University."
This three-part series will examine
faculty components regarding
Hoover's alleged partisanship and
the Institution's academic and finan
cial relationship to the University and
its faculty departments.
Nobody denies that the 64-year
old Hoover Institution on Revolu
tion, War and Peace is a part of Stan
ford University. Hoover received $4
million this year from the University,
including nearly $2.8 million in gen
eral revenue to fund Hoover's re
nowned library and archives, how
ever, the Institution enjoys a hazy,
quasi-independent status.
Unlike the heads of Stanford's de
partments and professional schools,
Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell
reports not to the provost, but di
rectly to the University president.
Hoover controls its own $8.4 million
budget, 40 percent of which comes
from corporate and individual gifts
made directly to Hoover. Hoover
also hires and fires its "scholars"
without being subject to the faculty
appointment process, subject to pro
forma approval by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
"The problem arises from the fact
that Hoover has a mission. It is a
political organization within the Uni
versity," John Manley, professor of
political in a recent
The nine-page memo, addressed

to the political science faculty, came
in the wake of a heated faculty meet
ing debate where Manley opposed a
proposal to invite Hoover fellow
Gerald Dorfman to teach a course
next fall on British politics. Manley
stated that such "reciprocity" — in
cluding the pending appointment of
Hoover fellow Alvin Rabushka to the
political science faculty — blurs the
line between Hoover and the
academic departments, thereby
threatening their academic objectiv
ity.
Ronald Rebholz, professor of En
glish, offered a similar criticism.
"The Hoover Institution is a part of
Stanford University, it advocates a
partisan political position and it uses
its relationship with the University
and many of its faculty to enhance its
prestige and respectability and
thereby make its political advocacy
more effective," Rebholz stated in a
recent letter to the English Depart
ment faculty obtained by the Daily.
Rebholz is the author of the faculty
petition seeking to put the issue of
Hoover's relationship to the faculty
departments on the agenda of the
Academic Senate.
George Marotta, Hoover's public
relations director, disagrees strongly
with claims that Hoover is politically
partisan, intellectually biased or a
threat to academic freedom in the
social science departments. Marotta
said that Hoover's "ideas are not all
monolithic." He said the Hoover fel
lows reflect an increasing diversity of
views and that in any case the con
servative opinions of many indi
vidual Hoover fellows did not mean
the Institution was partisan or biased
in any way.
Seymour Martin Lipset, a Hoover
Senior Fellow and professor of polit
ical science and <;oriolrmv.
think-tank is an anarchronism based

on its anti-Communist past. As evi
dence of Hoover's growing diversity,
he noted that "there are quite a
number of Democrats here," includ
ing himself.
For other faculty, Hoover presents
different problems. Alexander Dal
lin, professor of history and for seven
years a senior fellow at Hoover,
charges Hoover with "hiring dis
crimination" and a "perversion" of
the institution's founding charter.
Dallin, chairman of the international
relations program, held a joint ap
pointment as a tenured history pro
fessor and a Hoover senior fellow
until he resigned in 1978.
"There should be no such thing as
Hoover on any campus that has any
such political commitments, be it
left, right or sidewise," Dallin said in
an interview last week. Dallin objects
to what he believed to be the "injec
tion of political criteria in academic
hiring and use of funds."
He also said that although Hoover
was established as an archive and
center for international studies, the
near total shift over the past decade
to the study of domestic economics
and regulatory policies constitutes
"a perversion of Hoover's initial
mandate." Dallin said he left Hoover
in part because he perceived viola
tions of academic standards by an
"inner sanctum" of conservative ac
tivists whom he was unable to influ
ence from inside the Institution.
Henry Levin, professor at the
School of Education, said in a recent
interview that although he "finds it
disturbing that Hoover applies a
political litmus test to most of its ap
pointments," he is most concerned
about how certain "inappropriate
conduct" by Hoover fellows reflects
on Stanford's national reputation.
I pvl r\ ritocA Mien, Hoover
\e\\ow trom A c )feb to served
as President Reagan's national secu
rity adviser until he resigned while
under investigation for accepting
$1000 and a watch from Japanese
journalists. Levin commented that
Allen has also been accused of al
leged conflicts of interest for advis
ing Robert Vesco, the fugitive securi
ties swindler, while serving as a top
aide to Henry Kissinger from 1969 to
1971, as reported in the Boston
Globe.
In January of this year Hoover
reappointed Allen a senior research
fellow. Allen has since registered as a
foreign agent and works nearly full
time in Washington lobbying on be
half of Japanese corporations.
According to Marotta's office,
Mien spends \itt\e or no time doing
academic research at Stanford. His
Hoover appointment, however, is
"by-courtesy," meaning he has no
formal commitments and does not
receive any compensation.
Still other professors argue that al
though Hoover does some very
high-quality research, the mere ap
pearance of partisanship damages
Stanford's rising status among the
nation's leading universities. Even
before the 1980 election, the New
York Times reported that "Through
its ties with the right wing of the Re
publican Party, the Hoover Institu

tion is exerting increasing political
influence. It is the brightest star in a
small constellation of conservative
think tanks that serve as workshops
where out-of-office intellectuals can
fabricate the underpinnings of
domestic and foreign policy posi
tions for the Republicans."
Reagan, in a January, 1981 speech
honoring Hoover overseers and
Campbell, repeated the Times de
scription when he praised Hoover as
" 'the brightest star in a small con
stellation of conservative think
tanks,' " he continued, "Moreover,
during the recent campaign, I called
on more people from the (Hoover)
Institution to help with my campaign
than from any other institution," ac
cording to a transcript of Reagan's
remarks put out by Hoover. In sub
sequent press releases, Hoover has
amended the president's remarks to
delete the word "conservative."
President Donald Kennedy, who
sits on Hoover's 68-member Board of
Overseers, publicly defends Hoover
as a net contribution to the Univer
sity. In a recent interview Kennedy
said there is a false perception that
Hoover's conservative political affili
ations have grown in recent years.
He also stated that the prominence
of some individual Hoover fellows in
the Reagan administration has
created a "distorted impression of
Hoover influence."
Kennedy also disputed the charge
of political discrimination in hiring.
"I don't think it is correct to say that

somebody cannot get an appoint
ment with Hoover unless their poli
tics are Hoover politics," he said.
Several faculty members who have
signed the Rebholz petition said they
support a direct faculty appeal to the
Board of Trustees because Kennedy
has been "neutralized" on the
Hoover issue. They suggested thatan
explanation for Kennedy's hands-off
approach to Hoover is that any at
tempt to challenge Hoover's pre
rogatives would bring Kennedy him
self into a direct conflict with power
ful donors to the University, such as
David Packard, co-founder of
Hewlett-Packard and a former dep
uty Secretary of Defense. Packard
helped develop and fund Hoover's
recent transformation into a domes
tic policy center, contributing $1.2
million to Hoover in 1971 alone. He
has also been an officer on Hoover's
board as well as chairman of the Uni
versity Board of Trustees.

Several other professors contacted
by the Daily said they opposed
Hoover's current status within the
University, primarily because of per
ceptions of partisanship and ap
pointments of researchers less
academically qualified than regular
faculty, but they would not speak on
the record. Several stated they had
more effective channels through
which to make their displeasure
known. Another professor said he
feared "one phone call from
Hoover" could threaten federal re
search grants to junior faculty in his

department.
Manley, Rebholz and others have
also questioned Stanford's financial
support of Hoover. Stanford cur
rently provides Hoover with $4 mil
lion, according to Raymond Bac
chetti, director of University
budgets. Stanford does not charge
Hoover rent for the property it oc
cupies or for the general services it
consumes.
Some $2.8 million, or 32 percent of
Hoover's $8.4 million budget, comes
out of University general operating
funds generated by tuition and other
non-restricted sources. University
operating funds are used only to
fund Hoover's library and archives,
which are part of the campus library
system, according to Bacchetti and
Timothy Warner, assistant provost.
Since 1981, Stanford operating
funds contributed to Hoover have
increased 42 percent, from $1.9 mil
lion to $2.7 million. Since 1979-80,
the increase has been 64 percent.
Warner said that consistent with
the University's two-year budget re
duction program, Hoover would suf
fer a $52,000 cut next fiscal year.
However, this cut will only reduce a
simultaneous $388,000 increase in
Hoover's library budget intended to
compensate for inflation, according
to the Operating Budget Guidelines
1982-83 approved by the Board of
Trustees.
The remaining $1.3 million the
University supplies Hoover appar
ently represents endowment earn

ings on restricted funds earmarked
for Hoover, but managed by the Uni
versity. This portion will increase to
$2 million next year, according to
Warner.
While University operating funds
must be spent on library acquisitions
and administration, the research
program at Hoover "is funded en
tirely from restricted funds," accord
ing to the University's Operating
Budget Guidelines 1982-83. Hoover
funds its $4.2 million research pro
gram with endowment earnings from
the University and with some $3.4
million in corporate, foundation and
individual gifts received directly by
the Institution, according to
Hoover's 1982 Annual Report.
Although Stanford provides nearly
half of Hoover's $8.4 million budget,
Kennedy said he did not believe that
Hoover presents itself to the public
as being a part of Stanford Univer
sity.

sity.
Vet critics point to Hoover's 1982
Annual Report, where Campbell
states that the "many inter
relationships with Stanford Univer
sity include library cooperation, joint
appointments, cosponsorship of
seminars and lectures, and courses
offered by Hoover Institution schol
ars."

In the same introduction to the
1982 Annual Report, Campbell also
refers to himself as "the first chair
man (of the Board of Regents of the
University of California) to come
from a private university/' a refer
ence the Rebholz memo argues is
further evidence that Campbell sees
himself and Hoover as "integral parts
of Stanford." Then-Governor Reagan
appointed Campbell to a 16-year
term on the Board of Regents in 1968.
Tomorrow: Is Hoover a "two-tiered
think tank?" The Daily examines fac
ulty charges that Hoover is a core of
conservative policy activists
shrouded by a luster of Stanford joint
appointments.
