# Trustee inquiry into Institution requested
## Profs, question Hoover role 
### KIMBERLY BROWN MICHAEL CALABRESE 
The Hoover Institution's unique
and intermittently controversial rela
tionship with the University is being
challenged again, this time by a
group of tenured faculty who plan to
ask the Academic Senate to "urge the
Board of Trustees to initiate an im
mediate and Independent Inquiry,
including a public report, on the rela
tionship between the Hoover Institu
tion and Stanford University."
This three-part series will examine
faculty components regarding
Hoover's alleged partisanship and
the Institution's academic and finan
cial relationship to the University and
its faculty departments.
Nobody denies that the 64-year
old Hoover Institution on Revolu
tion, War and Peace is a part of Stan
ford University. Hoover received $4
million this year from the University,
including nearly $2.8 million in gen
eral revenue to fund Hoover's re
nowned library and archives, how
ever, the Institution enjoys a hazy,
quasi-independent status.
Unlike the heads of Stanford's de
partments and professional schools,
Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell
reports not to the provost, but di
rectly to the University president.
Hoover controls its own $8.4 million
budget, 40 percent of which comes
from corporate and individual gifts
made directly to Hoover. Hoover
also hires and fires its "scholars"
without being subject to the faculty
appointment process, subject to pro
forma approval by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
"The problem arises from the fact
that Hoover has a mission. It is a
political organization within the Uni
versity," John Manley, professor of
political in a recent
The nine-page memo, addressed

to the political science faculty, came
in the wake of a heated faculty meet
ing debate where Manley opposed a
proposal to invite Hoover fellow
Gerald Dorfman to teach a course
next fall on British politics. Manley
stated that such "reciprocity" — in
cluding the pending appointment of
Hoover fellow Alvin Rabushka to the
political science faculty — blurs the
line between Hoover and the
academic departments, thereby
threatening their academic objectiv
ity.
Ronald Rebholz, professor of En
glish, offered a similar criticism.
"The Hoover Institution is a part of
Stanford University, it advocates a
partisan political position and it uses
its relationship with the University
and many of its faculty to enhance its
prestige and respectability and
thereby make its political advocacy
more effective," Rebholz stated in a
recent letter to the English Depart
ment faculty obtained by the Daily.
Rebholz is the author of the faculty
petition seeking to put the issue of
Hoover's relationship to the faculty
departments on the agenda of the
Academic Senate.
George Marotta, Hoover's public
relations director, disagrees strongly
with claims that Hoover is politically
partisan, intellectually biased or a
threat to academic freedom in the
social science departments. Marotta
said that Hoover's "ideas are not all
monolithic." He said the Hoover fel
lows reflect an increasing diversity of
views and that in any case the con
servative opinions of many indi
vidual Hoover fellows did not mean
the Institution was partisan or biased
in any way.
Seymour Martin Lipset, a Hoover
Senior Fellow and professor of polit
ical science and <;oriolrmv.
think-tank is an anarchronism based

on its anti-Communist past. As evi
dence of Hoover's growing diversity,
he noted that "there are quite a
number of Democrats here," includ
ing himself.
For other faculty, Hoover presents
different problems. Alexander Dal
lin, professor of history and for seven
years a senior fellow at Hoover,
charges Hoover with "hiring dis
crimination" and a "perversion" of
the institution's founding charter.
Dallin, chairman of the international
relations program, held a joint ap
pointment as a tenured history pro
fessor and a Hoover senior fellow
until he resigned in 1978.
"There should be no such thing as
Hoover on any campus that has any
such political commitments, be it
left, right or sidewise," Dallin said in
an interview last week. Dallin objects
to what he believed to be the "injec
tion of political criteria in academic
hiring and use of funds."
He also said that although Hoover
was established as an archive and
center for international studies, the
near total shift over the past decade
to the study of domestic economics
and regulatory policies constitutes
"a perversion of Hoover's initial
mandate." Dallin said he left Hoover
in part because he perceived viola
tions of academic standards by an
"inner sanctum" of conservative ac
tivists whom he was unable to influ
ence from inside the Institution.
Henry Levin, professor at the
School of Education, said in a recent
interview that although he "finds it
disturbing that Hoover applies a
political litmus test to most of its ap
pointments," he is most concerned
about how certain "inappropriate
conduct" by Hoover fellows reflects
on Stanford's national reputation.
