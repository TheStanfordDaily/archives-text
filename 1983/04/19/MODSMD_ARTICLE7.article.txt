# University Press to get new director
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Grant Barnes, currently executive editor of the Uni
versity of California Press in Berkeley, will have to trade
the gold and blue for cardinal when he takes over the
Stanford University Press in August.
Provost Al Hastorf announced in last week's Faculty
Senate meeting that Barnes will replace Leon Seltzer as
director of the University Press. Seltzer, who has served
as director since 1956, has reached University retirement
â€¢ige and plans to work in copyright law after he leaves his
Stanford post.
As executive editor in Berkeley, Barnes is in charge of
planning and directing approximately 70 new titles a
year, concentrated mainly in history, social sciences,
and science. Once he arrives here in August, Barnes will
have complete control over the 50 new titles the Univer
sity Press publishes each year.

Although faculty members here have expressed an
interest in changing the University Press, Barnes said he
is not sure what he might do to change it."The faculty
seems to have in mind that we should change, but I
really don't know in what way the Stanford press might
change. I won't know until I get there and sound of a lot
of people."
Barnes said becoming director of a university press
will be "the culmination of my career. It's more impor
tant to be a director than executive editor."
Coming to Stanford will be a big change for Barnes.
Not only is the Stanford Press smaller than UC's, it is also
more conservative, Barnes said.
Barnes said that he is happy to make the move to the
Farm. "I like Stanford. I would have gone there if I could
have afforded it. But instead I spent five and a half years
at Berkeley, working full-time to pay my way."
