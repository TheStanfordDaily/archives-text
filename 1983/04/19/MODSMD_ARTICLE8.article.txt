## Living off-campus: an available but costly option 
### JASON COLE 
With the housing draw just a
few days away, students are
once again asking themselves,
"Where am I going to live next
year?"
Despite a vast array of new
housing opening up on cam
pus, there is always the chance
of being unguaranteed, draw
ing a number like 4709 and
being in the nomadic state
known as "unassigned."
The primary option for unas
signed students is to find hous
ing off campus. At first, this op
tion appears somewhat bleak.
Scouring the local neighbor
hoods, reading the want ads of
the newspaper and trudging in
search of the proper place add
to the nightmare of exorbitant
rents and fending for oneself.
The problem may be even
more acute for graduate stu
dents who, for the most part,
have no understanding of the
housing situation here and in
the surrounding communities.
Despite the addition of many
spots in Manzanita Park (the
trailers), most graduate stu
dents come here without any
assured housing and then try
to find a place to live.

Living off-campus allows her to "leave
school after a long day and not have to deal
with it/' said senior Julie Olincy, adding that
she has saved money by living off-campus.

But the picture may or may
not be so bleak, depending on
how things turn out.
Senior Julie Olincy, who
lives in Los Altos, enjoys living
off campus. "It allows me to
really be able to leave school
after a long day and not have to
deal with it," she said. "This
way I can have my own social
life without having to deal with
school constantly. Unlike a
dorm, where you're always
confronted with school, being
off campus allows me to just
leave. Not that I didn't enjoy
the dorms, but this is a nice
change," she added.
Olincy said she saved money
overall by living off campus.
"The cost of actual housing is
probably about the same, but
I'm able to save a lot on food,"
she said. Olincy shares a con
dominium with three other
people.

She also finds her social life
quite enjoyable. "I meet a lot
of other off-campus people.
Since we all have to fend for
ourselves (for meals) we end
up having a lot of dinner par
ties at each others' houses,"
she explained.
Olincy said she and her
friends found their place
through an ad in the Peninsula
Times Tribune.
Suzi Weersing, a junior liv
ing in College Terrace, simply
said, "I love it," referring to liv
ing off campus. "It is much
more relaxing for me to come
back to a home rather than a
dorm. I don't feel like I'm sur
rounded by people of school,"
she said.
Weersing is an eating as
sociate at Phi Sig and spends a
great deal of time on campus
since she lives nearby. "It's the
best of both worlds, because I
can still be part of campus life
and have a regular home to live
in," she explained.
Ted Forsman, a senior who
lived in Mountain View fall
quarter but has since moved
back on campus, had a much
different experience while liv
ing off campus. For him, it was

primarily inconvenient and ex
pensive. "The rent was higher
than on campus and I had to
buy a lot of gas to get back and
forth. It was also a hassle be
cause it was pretty far away and
because whenever I had an
interview I'd have to bring a
suit and then find a place to
change," he said.
"It also cut down my ability
to meet new people and take a
part in campus life. Even
though I was a member of an
eating club it was still difficult,"
he added.
Forsman also said living on
campus is crucial to making the
most of what Stanford life has
to offer. "I have the rest of my
life to live on my own. Why not
tak.e advantage of the campus
atmosphere. Stanford is really
an on-campus experience.
Being off campus was a lot like
going to high school. You go to

school and then come back
home and maybe watch televi
sion. If I had wanted that I
could have stayed home and
gone to school," he said.
John Hochheimer, a
graduate student in communi
cation who has lived off cam
pus since he came here in 1978,
said that he never considered
living on campus but is disap
pointed by the off-campus
realities.
"After you've been on your
own for a while, it's hard to
come back to campus and lose
Jhe privacy you've gotten ac
customed to. They (the Uni
versity) take two adults and
throw them into a one
bedroom apartment and tell
them to make do," he said.
But Hochheimer stressed
that off-campus housing has
definite drawbacks. "The
graduate living experience
here is tough, despite the na
ture of the area. Unless you
have a car, transportation is
highly inadequate and the cost
is very high. A small two
bedroom place will cost $600
and a one-bedroom will cost
$400. If you've got the bucks,
you can live here," he ex
plained.
Unfortunately, most
graduate students don't have
the money. This forces them to
share housing and lose their
privacy, Hochheimer said.
Regarding campus life, Hoc
hheimer said, "If there is an ac
tivity I really want to go to, I can
go do it. There are lots of pro
grams on campus to get in
volved in. But the converse to
that is the insular effect of
being on campus. Because
there's so much to do, stu
dents, as well as faculty, get so
wrapped up in the campus that
they forget that there is a major
metropolitan area very close."
As far as looking for housing,
affording housing is more dif
ficult than finding it may be.
According to Molly Kunkel,
supervisor of the Rental Hous
ing Office, "There's enough
housing, but it's expensive.
Unlike Berkeley where hous
ing is cheap but almost impos
sible to find."
Kunkel added, "The vacancy
rate isn't real high, but a lot of
places are shared." She con
cluded, "There's not much
students can do until fall. Most
places don't start opening up
until August and )uly."
