# Student senate opposes SSRL weapons proposal
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate passed by a 14-3
vote last night a resolution opposing
a recommended project at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory (SSRL) that would aid research
on nuclear weapons.
The vote is only symbolic, but
serves as a strong sign of student op
position to the increasingly controv
ersial proposal. The resolution was
passed in the wake of an announce
ment by Jon Adelstein, a junior
majoring in political science, that he
had collected the signatures of 1572
students, 45 faculty and 75 staff
members here on a more strongly
worded petition that opposes all nu
clear weapons research on campus.
The action was especially signifi
cant because the senate decided to
vote on the resolution without first
discussing it in committee meetings.
Adelstein urged the senate to pass
the resolution yesterday because
SSRL's proposal review panel, a sci
entific advisory board composed of
experts outside of the University, is
expected to make a decision today
whether or not to recommend the

project.
Adelstein said after the vote that
this is a "moral statement by the
senators about where they stand
with regard to the proposal (at SSRL).
"The senators realized the dangers
of the proposal and being associated
with Lawrence Livermore Laboratory
and Los Alamos (two weapons labo
ratories that are sponsoring the pro
posal.) This sends a message to
Livermore that Stanford students
won't sit idly by."
The senate deleted, however, a
clause of the resolution opposing all
nuclear testing on campus. Many
senators said this clause was too
broad and would indicateopposition
to on-going projects here. Some of
these senators voted for the weaker
resolution.
The three senators who voted
against the final resolution, Roc Blu
menthal, )im McGrath and Roland
VanGaalen, cited a variety of reasons
for their opposition.
VanGaalen said acceptance of the
resolution would be a "political
statement" that would be taken as
representing the opinions of the en
tire student body.

"Next we'll be endorsing presi
dential candidates," VanGaalen said.
In a statement issued after the
meeting, McGrath and Blumenthal
agreed with VanGaalen and also de
cried the fact that the senate "had
not had enough time to intelligently
investigate and deliberate the issue,
and thus decided this question more
on the basis of emotions than on rea
son."
But senator Frik Thompson said
the fact that so many people had
signed Adelstein's petition was an
indication of student approval of the
resolution.
Adelstein said "about 80 percent"
of the people who saw the petition
signed it.
Senator Peter Spivack, who spon
sored the resolution, said the propo
sal would "be setting a dangerous
precedent" because it would be the
first time the University had accepted
research money from the Depart
ment of Energy's Division of Defense
Program, which would fund the
project. The University now accepts
money from other divisions of the
Department of Energy, as well as ex

Senator Jerry Wertheim said, in
encouraging senators to vote for the
resolution, "students want the line
drawn. Let's do it, let's draw the line
here."
Wertheim also expressed concern
because members of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center have op
posed the proposal at SSRL. Fifteen
faculty and 20 staff members at SLAC
have signed petitions opposing the

proposal, and Adelstein said he ex
pects "more than 300" SLAC staft
members to sign his petition. These
staff members have said SLAC's rela
tionship with SSRL, which is adminis
tratively separate but otherwise de
pendent on SLAC, creates a situation
of "involuntary servitude" because
they have to participate in research
that they oppose.
Senator Marian Smith said,
'people at SLAC would no longer
have a choice" if the proposal is ac
cepted.
And senator Gordon Hecker, in
urging acceptance of the resoiutiori,
said, "it is the senate's responsibility

to stand on the forefront of this
whole movement (in opposition to
SSRL's proposal)."

the fact that so many people had

Senator Peter Spivack, who spon

NUKING THE NUKES: From left to right, COP member-elect Peter Spivack, junior Jon Adelstein and John
Harris, a general engineer at SLAC, offer their opposition to proposed SSRL nuclear weapons research at last
night's heated senate meeting. As director of Stanford Against Nuclear Weapons Research, Adelstein and
fellow supporters have garnered more than 1500 signatures from members of the Stanford community against
such activity. The ASSU passed a resolution opposing SSRL weapons research.

of Defense.
Senator Jerry Wertheim said, in
encouraging senators to vote for the
resolution, "students want the line
drawn. Let's do it, let's draw the line
here."
Wertheim also expressed concern
because members of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center have op
posed the proposal at SSRL. Fifteen
faculty and 20 staff members at SLAC
have signed petitions opposing the

proposal, and Adelstein said he ex
pects "more than 300" SLAC staft
members to sign his petition. These
staff members have said SLAC's rela
tionship with SSRL, which is adminis
tratively separate but otherwise de
pendent on SLAC, creates a situation
of "involuntary servitude" because
they have to participate in research
that they oppose.
Senator Marian Smith said,
'people at SLAC would no longer
have a choice" if the proposal is ac
cepted.
And senator Gordon Hecker, in
urging acceptance of the resoiutiori,
said, "it is the senate's responsibility

to stand on the forefront of this
whole movement (in opposition to
SSRL's proposal)."

on the proposal to Arthur
Bienenstock, the director of SSRL,

The ASSU Senate passed by a 14-3
vote last night a resolution opposing
a recommended project at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory (SSRL) that would aid research
on nuclear weapons.
The vote is only symbolic, but
serves as a strong sign of student op
position to the increasingly controv
ersial proposal. The resolution was
passed in the wake of an announce
ment by Jon Adelstein, a junior
majoring in political science, that he
had collected the signatures of 1572
students, 45 faculty and 75 staff
members here on a more strongly
worded petition that opposes all nu
clear weapons research on campus.
The action was especially signifi
cant because the senate decided to
vote on the resolution without first
discussing it in committee meetings.
Adelstein urged the senate to pass
the resolution yesterday because
SSRL's proposal review panel, a sci
entific advisory board composed of
experts outside of the University, is
expected to make a decision today
whether or not to recommend the

project.
Adelstein said after the vote that
this is a "moral statement by the
senators about where they stand
with regard to the proposal (at SSRL).
"The senators realized the dangers
of the proposal and being associated
with Lawrence Livermore Laboratory
and Los Alamos (two weapons labo
ratories that are sponsoring the pro
posal.) This sends a message to
Livermore that Stanford students
won't sit idly by."
The senate deleted, however, a
clause of the resolution opposing all
nuclear testing on campus. Many
senators said this clause was too
broad and would indicateopposition
to on-going projects here. Some of
these senators voted for the weaker
resolution.
The three senators who voted
against the final resolution, Roc Blu
menthal, )im McGrath and Roland
VanGaalen, cited a variety of reasons
for their opposition.
VanGaalen said acceptance of the
resolution would be a "political
statement" that would be taken as
representing the opinions of the en
tire student body.

"Next we'll be endorsing presi
dential candidates," VanGaalen said.
