# Is Reagan breaking the law?
## 
### 
For the first time in the decade
since Watergate, Americans have
strong grounds for believing that
their president is knowingly defying
the law. This is not a charge to be
lightly made, nor should it be lightly
taken. It is therefore hard to exagg
erate the gravity of the statement
made last week by the chairman of
the House Intelligence Committee,
Rep. Edward Boland (D-Mass.), that
"the evidence is very strong" that the
Reagan administration has violated
the law by providing covert aid to
rebels fighting against the govern
ment of Nicaragua.
The president's reply was, if any
thing, even more blunt. In a press
conference the day after Con
gressman Boland's statement, he as
serted that "we are complying with
the law" regarding covert militaryaid
to rebel groups operating in
Nicaragua.
Despite its forcefulness, however,
the president's statement lacks cre
dibility. Congressman Boland, after
all, is in a position to know whereof
he speaks. Not only does he have
access to classified information on
the subject as chairman of the Intelli
gence Committee, but the law in
question bears his name as well. In
December, Congress passed the Bo
land Amendment by an overwhelm
ing vote of 411-0, thereby prohibit
ing that any funds could be used by
the Department of Defense or the
CIA "for the purpose of overthrow
ing the Government of Nicaragua or
provoking a military exchange be
tween Nicaragua and Honduras."
At the very best, Reagan's asser
tion that his administration is com
plying with this law is based on a very
dubious interpretation of the facts
and of the Boland Amendment. In the
first place, one need only turn on the
news or open a newspaper to find
numerous stories and pictures of
Nicaraguan rebels training with
crates of equipment clearly marked
"Made in the U.S.A." and thanking
the United States for its support. Not
even the Reagan administration has
attempted to deny that it is providing
equipment, training, information
and advice to the Nicaraguan rebels,
for this would directly conflict with
both well-documented press reports
and with incontrobertible evidence
to the contrary available to Boland
and others with access to classified
materials.
The sole grounds for the adminis
tration's denial that it is violating the
law lies in a twisted and self-serving
interpretation of the phrase "for the
purpose of overthrowing the gov
ernment of Nicaragua." In the past,
administration officials have hidden
behind the feeble explanation that
U.S. support of rebels in Nicaragua

and those operating from bases in
Honduras was not for the purpose of
"overthrowing" the Nicaraguan
government, but rather that of "de
stabilizing" it. More recently, the
president himself abandoned this
shallow equivocation in favor of the
explanation that the only goal of U.S.
support of the rebels is that of inter
dicting supplies to the Salvadoran
rebels that are allegedly passing
through Nicaragua.
It has been clear from the very
start, however, that the rebels, many
of whom were soldiers in the army of
Nicaragua's dictator Somoza, who
was overthrown by the current re
volutionary government in 1979, are
much more interested in overthrow
ing the Nicaraguan government than
they are in stopping supplies from
reaching rebels in El Salvador. It can
hardly come as a surprise, there
fore, that the Nicaraguan rebels, who
openly admit and even broadcast
over their radio stations their inten
tions to overthrow the government
of Nicaragua, have undertaken a
guerilla campaign evidently de
signed to do exactly that.
This, in turn, has presented an in
teresting dilemma to the Reagan ad
ministration. Either it mustarguethat
it has such tight control over the
guerillas that itcan divert their efforts
away from their desired goal of over
throwing the government, in which
case it would have to accept full re
sponsibility for all of the guerillas'
violent actions in Nicaragua, or it
must disavow any support for the
guerillas and their revolutionary as
pirations. The administration is un
able to do the first because this
would make it clearly responsible for
the guerillas' actions when it cannot
in fact fully control them and bring it
into a confrontation with Congress
as an open violator of the law, and it
has been unwilling to do the second
because of its misguided and rigidly
ideological anti-communism. In
stead, it has preferred to quietly
break the law in the hope that itcan
support the guerillas' aims without
having to accept the responsibility
for doing so.
This dilemma is reminiscent of that
faced by the Israeli government fol
lowing thr massacre by Phalangist
militiamen of Palestinians in Israeli
controlled territory in Lebanon. The
Israeli government and military offi
cials either had to admit that they
controlled the territory in which the
massacres took place, which would
make them responsible for letting
the Phalangists into the Palestinian
camps, or they had to explain their
negligence in not controlling the ter
ritory under their command in order
to disavow responsibility for the

Phalangists' actions.
A second aspect of the Israeli
example is even more instructive.
Outrage over the massacres and
questioning of the responsibility of
Israeli military and political leaders
were so strong in Israel that Prime
Minister Menachem Begin was
forced to overcome his reluctance to
investigate the role of Israeli offi
cials and appoint a high-level inde
pendent investigative commission.
The establishment of the commis
sion was heralded by Reagan and by
other leaders in both the United
States and Israel as a sign of the
strength of democracy in Israel, es
pecially when the commission was
unafraid to implicate Begin himself,
Israel's top political leader.
Is democracy in America less
strong than that in Israel? Should we
be less outraged at our government
for carrying out a secret war in de
fiance of Congress that is an open
violation of American law and that is
opposed, according to a recent Los
Angeles Times poll, by American
public opinion by a six to one mar
gin?
There are some who would argue
that an investigative commission is
not warranted in this case, that the
issue of covert military action in
Nicaragua is not an important one
and that the controversy is not a mat
ter of legality but of politics. In an
swer to the first criticism, the impor
tance of the secret war in Nicaragua
speaks for itself. It is nothing less
than an attack on the self
determination and sovereignty of a
government that, as much as we
might dislike its policies, is interna
tionally recognized as legitimate. In
answer to the second objection, the
secret war in Nicaragua is not so
much a matter of legality, although
the Boland amendment makes it
clear that this is an important issue,
as it is one of truth. We should be
asking the question: "Secret from
whom?" Clearly, the war and the
support the Reagan adminstration is
giving to the rebels are no secret to
Nicaragua or to the other nations of
Latin America, nor is there a secret
that is being kept from America's al
lies or the Soviet Union. The secret is
being kept from the American Con
gress and the American people be
cause the Reagan administration un
derstands that the war cannot win
their support. It is time for the secret
to be exposed, and since there is lit
tle prospect that the Reagan administ
ration has the courage to investigate
itself as the Israeli government has
done, it is up to Congress to do so.

ing the Government of Nicaragua or
provoking a military exchange be
tween Nicaragua and Honduras."
At the very best, Reagan's asser
tion that his administration is com
plying with this law is based on a very
dubious interpretation of the facts
and of the Boland Amendment. In the
first place, one need only turn on the
news or open a newspaper to find
numerous stories and pictures of
Nicaraguan rebels training with
crates of equipment clearly marked
"Made in the U.S.A." and thanking
the United States for its support. Not
even the Reagan administration has
attempted to deny that it is providing
equipment, training, information
and advice to the Nicaraguan rebels,
for this would directly conflict with
both well-documented press reports
and with incontrobertible evidence
to the contrary available to Boland
and others with access to classified
materials.
The sole grounds for the adminis
tration's denial that it is violating the
law lies in a twisted and self-serving
interpretation of the phrase "for the
purpose of overthrowing the gov
ernment of Nicaragua." In the past,
administration officials have hidden
behind the feeble explanation that
U.S. support of rebels in Nicaragua

and those operating from bases in
Honduras was not for the purpose of
"overthrowing" the Nicaraguan
government, but rather that of "de
stabilizing" it. More recently, the
president himself abandoned this
shallow equivocation in favor of the
explanation that the only goal of U.S.
support of the rebels is that of inter
dicting supplies to the Salvadoran
rebels that are allegedly passing
through Nicaragua.
It has been clear from the very
start, however, that the rebels, many
of whom were soldiers in the army of
Nicaragua's dictator Somoza, who
was overthrown by the current re
volutionary government in 1979, are
much more interested in overthrow
ing the Nicaraguan government than
they are in stopping supplies from
reaching rebels in El Salvador. It can
hardly come as a surprise, there
fore, that the Nicaraguan rebels, who
openly admit and even broadcast
over their radio stations their inten
tions to overthrow the government
of Nicaragua, have undertaken a
guerilla campaign evidently de
signed to do exactly that.
This, in turn, has presented an in
teresting dilemma to the Reagan ad
ministration. Either it mustarguethat
it has such tight control over the
guerillas that itcan divert their efforts
away from their desired goal of over
throwing the government, in which
case it would have to accept full re
sponsibility for all of the guerillas'
violent actions in Nicaragua, or it
must disavow any support for the
guerillas and their revolutionary as
pirations. The administration is un
able to do the first because this
would make it clearly responsible for
the guerillas' actions when it cannot
in fact fully control them and bring it
into a confrontation with Congress
as an open violator of the law, and it
has been unwilling to do the second
because of its misguided and rigidly
ideological anti-communism. In
stead, it has preferred to quietly
break the law in the hope that itcan
support the guerillas' aims without
having to accept the responsibility
for doing so.
This dilemma is reminiscent of that
faced by the Israeli government fol
lowing thr massacre by Phalangist
militiamen of Palestinians in Israeli
controlled territory in Lebanon. The
Israeli government and military offi
cials either had to admit that they
controlled the territory in which the
massacres took place, which would
make them responsible for letting
the Phalangists into the Palestinian
camps, or they had to explain their
negligence in not controlling the ter
ritory under their command in order
to disavow responsibility for the

Phalangists' actions.
A second aspect of the Israeli
example is even more instructive.
Outrage over the massacres and
questioning of the responsibility of
Israeli military and political leaders
were so strong in Israel that Prime
Minister Menachem Begin was
forced to overcome his reluctance to
investigate the role of Israeli offi
cials and appoint a high-level inde
pendent investigative commission.
The establishment of the commis
sion was heralded by Reagan and by
other leaders in both the United
States and Israel as a sign of the
strength of democracy in Israel, es
pecially when the commission was
unafraid to implicate Begin himself,
Israel's top political leader.
Is democracy in America less
strong than that in Israel? Should we
be less outraged at our government
for carrying out a secret war in de
fiance of Congress that is an open
violation of American law and that is
opposed, according to a recent Los
Angeles Times poll, by American
public opinion by a six to one mar
gin?
There are some who would argue
that an investigative commission is
not warranted in this case, that the
issue of covert military action in
Nicaragua is not an important one
and that the controversy is not a mat
ter of legality but of politics. In an
swer to the first criticism, the impor
tance of the secret war in Nicaragua
speaks for itself. It is nothing less
than an attack on the self
determination and sovereignty of a
government that, as much as we
might dislike its policies, is interna
tionally recognized as legitimate. In
answer to the second objection, the
secret war in Nicaragua is not so
much a matter of legality, although
the Boland amendment makes it
clear that this is an important issue,
as it is one of truth. We should be
asking the question: "Secret from
whom?" Clearly, the war and the
support the Reagan adminstration is
giving to the rebels are no secret to
Nicaragua or to the other nations of
Latin America, nor is there a secret
that is being kept from America's al
lies or the Soviet Union. The secret is
being kept from the American Con
gress and the American people be
cause the Reagan administration un
derstands that the war cannot win
their support. It is time for the secret
to be exposed, and since there is lit
tle prospect that the Reagan administ
ration has the courage to investigate
itself as the Israeli government has
done, it is up to Congress to do so.

The sound and the fur^
For the first time in the decade
since Watergate, Americans have
strong grounds for believing that
their president is knowingly defying
the law. This is not a charge to be
lightly made, nor should it be lightly
taken. It is therefore hard to exagg
erate the gravity of the statement
made last week by the chairman of
the House Intelligence Committee,
Rep. Edward Boland (D-Mass.), that
"the evidence is very strong" that the
Reagan administration has violated
the law by providing covert aid to
rebels fighting against the govern
ment of Nicaragua.
The president's reply was, if any
thing, even more blunt. In a press
conference the day after Con
gressman Boland's statement, he as
serted that "we are complying with
the law" regarding covert militaryaid
to rebel groups operating in
Nicaragua.
Despite its forcefulness, however,
the president's statement lacks cre
dibility. Congressman Boland, after
all, is in a position to know whereof
he speaks. Not only does he have
access to classified information on
the subject as chairman of the Intelli
gence Committee, but the law in
question bears his name as well. In
December, Congress passed the Bo
land Amendment by an overwhelm
ing vote of 411-0, thereby prohibit
ing that any funds could be used by
the Department of Defense or the
CIA "for the purpose of overthrow
ing the Government of Nicaragua or
provoking a military exchange be
