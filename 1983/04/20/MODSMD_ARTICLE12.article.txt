## Trespassing at Vandenberg 
### 
Now, however, we are engaged in
developing tveapons of massive de
structive power for which there are
only minutes from launch to impact,
with the launch decision based on an
elaborate network of radar, comput
ers and electronic communications.
As a former electronics officer on a
large aircraft carrier I know that
under unusual propagation condi
tions radar can indicate false targets;
my forty years of experience with
electronics tells me that malfunc
tions of communications and com
puters are inevitable. (There have
been many such false alarms in the
past few years.) To allow only a few
minutes to verify a suspected enemy
launch is insane, and almost guaran
tees initiation of a suicidal exchange.
My second reason is even more
basic. After much soul-searching, I
have come to realize that to me noth
ing can justify the slaughter of tens,
even hundredsof millions of people.
I was 19 years-old, the age of some of
my fellow demonstrators at Vanden
berg, when my country dropped the
first atomic bombs on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. For 37 years we have lived
with this shame. Now the world has
accumulated the destructive equiva
lent of over a million Hiroshimas,
hoping they will not be used, but
preparing to do so nonetheless.
For myself I do not care much; I
have had my life, my career, and can
accept what comes. I DO care for the
future of my children, for the
spiritual health of this nation, for the
survival of life on this planet. And so I
joined this group of gentle but de
termined people, committed to non
violence but ready to make a
statement with their lives, accepting
the consequences of their actions on
behalf of people everywhere. I have
never met a finer group.
General jack Watkins, command
ing officer of Vandenberg, stated
that our proper protest is political,
that we should pursue legal recourse
through our legislators and leaders.
Knowing that this country was
founded on the premise of a gov
ernment securing our inalienable
rights by just powers derived from

the consent of the governed, we
have voted, we have written letters,
we have signed petitions, we have
spoken out. Since this has not been
effective we now withdraw our con
sent for the actions of our govern
ment. We do not recognize the
legitimacy of institutionalized force
represented by the military. We
made our statement with our bodies,
and say with Gandhi that "We volun
tarily submit to the penalty for non
cooperation with evil and therefore
invite and submit to the penalty for
what in law is adeliberate crime, but
what appears to us to be the highest
duty of a citizen."
With Thoreau, when convicted for
refusing to pay war taxes and asked
by Emerson why he was in jail, we
respond "Why are you out?"
To General Watkin's statement
that the personnel at Vandenberg are
not the appropriate focus for our at
tention I say that all people must
examine their conscience and their
actions at this crucial node of history.
This nation established at Nurem
burg that we are all answerable to a
higher moral standard when ordered
to perform unethical acts.
And speaking for myself, I felt bet
ter about takingthis action than any
thing I have ever done in my life.
The magistrate was tired; it was late
in the evening, he had listened to
almost 80 cases that day, almost that
many statements. I doubt that he was
able to hear us. He started to give our
final group of 10 a little lecture, tel
ling us that our civil disobedience
was ineffective and inappropriate.
Looking at our faces I think he could
tell that we did not accept his words,
so he simply gave us our sentence of
10 days in federal prison, credit for
time served with no probation and
warned us that our penalties would
be more severe next time if we re
turned again.
I think many of us will be back.
