# LETTER
## Crads in co-ops 
### 
On March 27 and 23, 1983, I was
arrested for trespassing at Vanden
berg Air Force Base in protest of con
tinued development of first-strike
missiles such as the MX. At my ar
raignment I was permitted to make a
statement, which was approximately
as follows.
••••••••
My name is Bob Kincheloe. I am 56
years old, an electronics engineer,
professor emeritus of electrical en
gineering actively employed by a
major private university, a husband
of 26 years, a father of four children,
a respectable member of my com
munity.
I come from an ethical family that
has served this country well. My
grandfather left his home, family, job
and community in Tennessee to fight
on the side of the Union in the Civil
War because he did not believe in
slavery. My father served as an of
ficer in World War I. Both my brother
and I are six-year veterans of active
naval service during and after World
War 11.
I have always considered myself to
be a responsible, law-abiding citi
zen; I have never before been ar
rested for deliberately breaking the
law. Why do I do so now?
There are two simple, but to me
compelling reasons.
The first reason is that we are run
ning out of time to avert a holocaust
which will probably result in the ter
mination of intelligent life on this
planet.
Over the years I have diligently
read and listened to arguments pro
and con about our need for military
superiority, the threat of Russia tak
ing over the world, the rationale for
Mutually Assured Destruction. I do
not dispute the ambitions of the
Communist party, but am convinced
that there are better and more effec
tive ways of dealing with Russia (and
others) than by an arms race which
will lead either to catastrophe or to
economic bankruptcy for all con
cerned. Given time, I think this will
become clear to everyone and
policies will be changed.

A recent editorial {Daily, April 8)
takes too narrow a perspective in its
arguments condemning a recent
University decision to integrate 44
graduate students among the six
co-op houses.
It seems clear that a proportion of
graduate students do indeed have
time and interest in undergraduate
housing, from the successful integra
tion of graduate students into the RA
and resident fellows programs. Cer
tainly it seems possible that from a
diverse pool of more than 5000
graduate students, there are 44 who
can judge for themselves the pros
and cons of undergraduate housing
and who could provide unique con
tributions to their living groups. This
is particularly true for the co-op
houses, in which graduate eating as
sociates have been active and en
thusiastic community members
under the present system. Finally,
these and other arguments certainly
justify allowing mixed housing with a
small proportion of graduate stu
dents for a trial year, after which
careful evaluation by students and
Res Ed can determine whether the
concept should be continued.
