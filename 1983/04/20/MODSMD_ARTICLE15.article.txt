# Law student debated in USSR, met with different attitudes
## Profile: 
### RANDY BROBERG staff writer 
Two weeks ago Margaret Niles, a 27-year
old third-year student at the Stanford Law
School, was flown to Washington D.C. to
meet privately with Secretary of State
George Shultz in order to relate her im
pressions of the Soviet Union. Shultz had
seen Niles on a television documentary film
describing her tour of the Soviet Union as a
member of a three-person debate team rep
resenting the United States.
In addition to her regular coursework,
Niles was also finishing up her tenure as
assistant managing editor of the Law Review
and arranging the catering of a law school
graduation event.
Last October 10 through 23 Niles and her
two partners, John Tokolish, a staffer for
Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.), and Bill
Skundvich, formerly a Slavic graduate stu
dent at Pittsburgh University, travelled to
the Soviet Union. They visited Moscow,
Baku in Azerbaidjan, Volgagrad (formerly
Stalingrad), Leningrad, Tartu in Estonia, and
Kiev to debate Soviet professors and
graduate students on the topic "War and
Peace in the Soviet and American Systems of
Value."
The Speech Communications Associa
tion, a group of professors and scholars who
organize the American college debate sys
tem and who have been arranging such de
bates with the Soviet Union for the last 10
years, arranged the debates. The Council on
International Discussion and Debate sent
Niles the application and later selected her,
Skundvich and Tokolish from a group of six
finalists asked to come to Washington to
give sample debate speeches.
According to Niles, "The biggest question
in my mind was how to present the American
point of view; then I realized that there was
no single American point of view, that I
could only speak for myself, that I could not
speak for America."
After she had been selected, Niles was not
at all apprehensive about travelling to the
U.S.S.R. — she had been there several times
before and knew there was "nothing to
worry about . . . unless you're making
trouble." But Niles was apprehensive about
her Russian, since she had not used it in two
years, and about her command of current
events, since she believed she had been out
of touch with the world while in law school.
Although she was of Russian heritage and
had been a member of the Russian club
while in high school in Portland, Oregon,
Niles did not begin studying Russian until
her undergraduate years at Harvard. "When
I took first year Russian I fell in love with it. It
was so much fun."
Niles said she "never found anything bor
ing about Russia," whether literature or his
tory. But it was her budding interest in inter
national relations, especially relations with
the other nuclear superpower, which led
her to major in Slavic Languages and Litera
ture. She graduated "cum laude" from Har
vard in 1977.
She took her first trip to the Soviet Union
while she was still an undergraduate at Har
vard. She went on a summer program spon
sored by the Council on International Educa

tion Exchange to study intensive Russian at
the Leningrad State University. Besides
learning grammar and phonetics, the stu
dents were taken on a number of excursions
to the sights around Leningrad and on a two
week trip to Moscow and Georgia.
Niles' initial impressions of the Soviet
Union reflected aspects of everyday life. She
saw how few goods were for sale in the
shops; she noticed how the people tend to
walk with their hands in their pockets and
with their head down.
But she later learned during the festival of
White Nights that the Soviets also knew how
to drink vodka and to dance the polka in the
streets. She particularly remembered a
crowd of Soviets singing along with the En
glish words of a Paul McCartney and Wings
album beingplayed through a loud speaker.
When her summer in the Soviet Union
had ended she was anxious to return to the
United States. She missed fresh fruits and
vegetables most, but she also missed "the
feeling of being able to do whatever you
want to do, to go wherever you want to
go. . . Every time a plane leaves the Soviet
Union or lands in the West there is
applause."
Although her experience had been more
"educational" than "enjoyable," she was
committed to returning.
After finishing at Harvard, Niles looked for
a job which would utilize her Russian. "I
learned that there aren't very many jobs
available using Russian. An undergraduate
degree in Russian is not saleable."
She did find a job working in a personnel
agency which she hated, however. When an
opportunity arose to work on a US agricul
tural exhibit in the Soviet Union for seven
months she seized it.
On her second trip, from fall 1978 to June
1979, she travelled throughout the U.S.S.R.
staying two weeks in each town or city. Her
primary duty was to respond to questions. In
addition to strictly agricultural questions,
Niles also had to deal with queries such as
"Why is there so much crime in New York?"
and "Why is there so much unemployment
in America?" But she was not told by the U.S.
government how to respond to the ques
tions; she was only told to use her own
judgment.
"In Moscow, people did not care much
about agriculture; they think of themselves
as too sophisticated for that. Ninety percent
of the questions were non-agricultural. The
Russians tended to ask the same questions
over and over again: education, crime, un
employment, medical care, and only an oc
casional question about U.S. foreign policy.
They are mostly interested in comparing
how Russians live with the way Americans
live, like 'How much do your jeans cost?"
When she had finished hertourof duty on
the agricultural exhibit, she got a job with a
tour agency and led several tours to the
Soviet Union. After tiringof that she decided
on law school and got a job as a paralegal in
New York City. She had been at Stanford
Law School two years when she heard about
the debate trip.
According to Niles, the audiences at the
debates "weren't terribly informed; rather
they were informed of one viewpoint only."

Although they were the "young elite, the
educated class, the Comisimol group," but
Niles believes they came mostly "out of
curiosity, not open-mindedness.
"These educated Soviets tend to believe
that everything is bad in the United States,
while they know everone wants to emigrate to
the United States. They believe people die in
the streets in America, but they also believe
the streets are paved with gold."
Niles did notice some regional differences
in the audiences' reactions. In Volgagard the
audience laughed when the debate team
talked about the persecutions of dissidents
in the U.S.S.R. and the Stalinist purges, and
the invasion of Afghanistan. There was only
modest, polite applause.
Niles's greatest satisfaction during the de
bate trip came when "scoring a point, when
they had to stop and think, when they could
say to themselves that she is right. They
would not say it aloud but they might say it to
themselves."
One example came during the Estonian
debate:"There was a question about
(former Secretary of State Alexander) Haig's
saying that there were some things more
important than peace. I said that freedom
was worth defending and protecting, free
dom to go and to say and to read what you
want. The Estonians applauded. . . in Es

tonia we had our most sympathetic audi
ence."
"Another thing that impressed the Soviets
was that though we "'°re representing the
United States, none of us had voted for Re
agan; that showed the plurality of the Ameri
can system."
"I he debate team was repeatedly frus
trated by Soviet tactics which did not give it
the opportunity to respond to all the Soviet
charges. "They would accuse us of having
expensive education, but they would never
give us a chance to describe low tuition state
schools, financial aid, etc. They would speak
about high U.S. unemployment without giv
ing us a chance to describe welfare or un
employment insurance."
Skundvich, one of the other members of
the debate team, said that the three of them
blended together well. "There were times
when we didn't agree on politcal issues. . . .
Niles played the peacemaker. She tried to
find the common ground between overly
conciliatory positions and angering them."
According to Skundvich, Niles is very
gracious, sociable, "the first on the dance
floor" and uninhibited. "She has a very
strong will and is amazingly disciplined: she
studied her law books on trains, planes,
buses and while waiting for the subway! She
got up before any of the others to go jogging

each morning; there were only two or three
days the whole trip when she didn't jog!"
Skundvk h also related a story about Niles
"putting away more champagne than any
body else" while on a tour ot a Soviet c ham
pagne factory.
When asked about her strongest criticism
of the Soviet Union, Niles responded, it is
the lack of information, the lack ot freedom
of thought, that there is no discussion of
political alternatives, the 'we trust our gov
ernment' syndrom."
The best things about the U.S.S.R. are the
bread, caviar and subways. their soci
ety basically works for them. The average
Soviet is as content with his system as the
average American, rhey don't wake upevery
morning feeling oppressed, (hey compare
themselves with how it use to be, not with
America. The U.S.S.R. is not a bad place for
most people to live.''
In defending the United States, Niles
found it most difficult to justity U.S. defense
policies. It was explained that the United
States was afraid of the U.S.S.R. but the Soviets
did not see why we should be afraid, (hey
have no idia how much they spend on military,
so they can't believe that their government is
in any way threatening war. I hey think they
have a pacifist government
Niles said ." Tne average Soviet is not afraid
of the U.S. . . rhey think that President Re
agan is the cievil himself, but they recognize
that Americans on a one to one basis want
peace as much as they do.
"Ihey think that they would never start a
war because they have suffered so much in
war, but they think that the U.S. doesn't
really know what war is, so we might start
one."
The argument that carried the most weight
was not that there is no freedom of thought
or speech in the Soviet Union. "They have
not been brought up that way," Niles said.
More persuasive is the freedom to travel and
to do what you want. . . They also love the
idea of enterpreneurship, but they don't like
the idea of taking risks — they want welfare
and the State to protect them, and the ability
to get rich. Consumer goods also seem very
appealing."
Michael Sternick, a classmate and friend of
Niles' at the Law School, said that he was im
pressed with her insightful (omments in class.
"She has a nice personality, is intelligent and
articulate. She knows when the 9 DO bus
leaves."
Niles said that her most ret ent experience
in the Soviet Union made her "even more
set" on making a lite contribution to world
peace. "I got a sense of mission. I want In
educate Americans about the Soviet
Union."
Her immediate post-graduate plans are to
go to work for ludge Eugene Wright ot the
9th Circuit Court in Seattle. After that she is
unsure but is thinking about applying for a
scholarship to study in the Soviet Union. Her
long-term dream would be to (each interna
tional law and Soviet studies.
Niles said Stanford students are generally
better informed than most people. But she is
also convinced that students here tend to be
"wrapped up in themselves and apathetic
about national and international affairs."

charges. "They would accuse us of having
expensive education, but they would never
give us a chance to describe low tuition state
schools, financial aid, etc. They would speak
about high U.S. unemployment without giv
ing us a chance to describe welfare or un
employment insurance."
Skundvich, one of the other members of
the debate team, said that the three of them
blended together well. "There were times
when we didn't agree on politcal issues. . . .
Niles played the peacemaker. She tried to
find the common ground between overly
conciliatory positions and angering them."
According to Skundvich, Niles is very
gracious, sociable, "the first on the dance
floor" and uninhibited. "She has a very
strong will and is amazingly disciplined: she
studied her law books on trains, planes,
buses and while waiting for the subway! She
got up before any of the others to go jogging

each morning; there were only two or three
days the whole trip when she didn't jog!"
Skundvk h also related a story about Niles
"putting away more champagne than any
body else" while on a tour ot a Soviet c ham
pagne factory.
When asked about her strongest criticism
of the Soviet Union, Niles responded, it is
the lack of information, the lack ot freedom
of thought, that there is no discussion of
political alternatives, the 'we trust our gov
ernment' syndrom."
The best things about the U.S.S.R. are the
bread, caviar and subways. their soci
ety basically works for them. The average
Soviet is as content with his system as the
average American, rhey don't wake upevery
morning feeling oppressed, (hey compare
themselves with how it use to be, not with
America. The U.S.S.R. is not a bad place for
most people to live.''
In defending the United States, Niles
found it most difficult to justity U.S. defense
policies. It was explained that the United
States was afraid of the U.S.S.R. but the Soviets
did not see why we should be afraid, (hey
have no idia how much they spend on military,
so they can't believe that their government is
in any way threatening war. I hey think they
have a pacifist government
Niles said ." Tne average Soviet is not afraid
of the U.S. . . rhey think that President Re
agan is the cievil himself, but they recognize
that Americans on a one to one basis want
peace as much as they do.
"Ihey think that they would never start a
war because they have suffered so much in
war, but they think that the U.S. doesn't
really know what war is, so we might start
one."
The argument that carried the most weight
was not that there is no freedom of thought
or speech in the Soviet Union. "They have
not been brought up that way," Niles said.
More persuasive is the freedom to travel and
to do what you want. . . They also love the
idea of enterpreneurship, but they don't like
the idea of taking risks — they want welfare
and the State to protect them, and the ability
to get rich. Consumer goods also seem very
appealing."
Michael Sternick, a classmate and friend of
Niles' at the Law School, said that he was im
pressed with her insightful (omments in class.
"She has a nice personality, is intelligent and
articulate. She knows when the 9 DO bus
leaves."
Niles said that her most ret ent experience
in the Soviet Union made her "even more
set" on making a lite contribution to world
peace. "I got a sense of mission. I want In
educate Americans about the Soviet
Union."
Her immediate post-graduate plans are to
go to work for ludge Eugene Wright ot the
9th Circuit Court in Seattle. After that she is
unsure but is thinking about applying for a
scholarship to study in the Soviet Union. Her
long-term dream would be to (each interna
tional law and Soviet studies.
Niles said Stanford students are generally
better informed than most people. But she is
also convinced that students here tend to be
"wrapped up in themselves and apathetic

Two weeks ago Margaret Niles, a 27-year
old third-year student at the Stanford Law
School, was flown to Washington D.C. to
meet privately with Secretary of State
George Shultz in order to relate her im
pressions of the Soviet Union. Shultz had
seen Niles on a television documentary film
describing her tour of the Soviet Union as a
member of a three-person debate team rep
resenting the United States.
In addition to her regular coursework,
Niles was also finishing up her tenure as
assistant managing editor of the Law Review
and arranging the catering of a law school
graduation event.
Last October 10 through 23 Niles and her
two partners, John Tokolish, a staffer for
Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.), and Bill
Skundvich, formerly a Slavic graduate stu
dent at Pittsburgh University, travelled to
the Soviet Union. They visited Moscow,
Baku in Azerbaidjan, Volgagrad (formerly
Stalingrad), Leningrad, Tartu in Estonia, and
Kiev to debate Soviet professors and
graduate students on the topic "War and
Peace in the Soviet and American Systems of
Value."
The Speech Communications Associa
tion, a group of professors and scholars who
organize the American college debate sys
tem and who have been arranging such de
bates with the Soviet Union for the last 10
years, arranged the debates. The Council on
International Discussion and Debate sent
Niles the application and later selected her,
Skundvich and Tokolish from a group of six
finalists asked to come to Washington to
give sample debate speeches.
According to Niles, "The biggest question
in my mind was how to present the American
point of view; then I realized that there was
no single American point of view, that I
could only speak for myself, that I could not
speak for America."
After she had been selected, Niles was not
at all apprehensive about travelling to the
U.S.S.R. — she had been there several times
before and knew there was "nothing to
worry about . . . unless you're making
trouble." But Niles was apprehensive about
her Russian, since she had not used it in two
years, and about her command of current
events, since she believed she had been out
of touch with the world while in law school.
Although she was of Russian heritage and
had been a member of the Russian club
while in high school in Portland, Oregon,
Niles did not begin studying Russian until
her undergraduate years at Harvard. "When
I took first year Russian I fell in love with it. It
was so much fun."
Niles said she "never found anything bor
ing about Russia," whether literature or his
tory. But it was her budding interest in inter
national relations, especially relations with
the other nuclear superpower, which led
her to major in Slavic Languages and Litera
ture. She graduated "cum laude" from Har
vard in 1977.
She took her first trip to the Soviet Union
while she was still an undergraduate at Har
vard. She went on a summer program spon
sored by the Council on International Educa

tion Exchange to study intensive Russian at
the Leningrad State University. Besides
learning grammar and phonetics, the stu
dents were taken on a number of excursions
to the sights around Leningrad and on a two
week trip to Moscow and Georgia.
Niles' initial impressions of the Soviet
Union reflected aspects of everyday life. She
saw how few goods were for sale in the
shops; she noticed how the people tend to
walk with their hands in their pockets and
with their head down.
But she later learned during the festival of
White Nights that the Soviets also knew how
to drink vodka and to dance the polka in the
streets. She particularly remembered a
crowd of Soviets singing along with the En
glish words of a Paul McCartney and Wings
album beingplayed through a loud speaker.
When her summer in the Soviet Union
had ended she was anxious to return to the
United States. She missed fresh fruits and
vegetables most, but she also missed "the
feeling of being able to do whatever you
want to do, to go wherever you want to
go. . . Every time a plane leaves the Soviet
Union or lands in the West there is
applause."
Although her experience had been more
"educational" than "enjoyable," she was
committed to returning.
After finishing at Harvard, Niles looked for
a job which would utilize her Russian. "I
learned that there aren't very many jobs
available using Russian. An undergraduate
degree in Russian is not saleable."
She did find a job working in a personnel
agency which she hated, however. When an
opportunity arose to work on a US agricul
tural exhibit in the Soviet Union for seven
months she seized it.
On her second trip, from fall 1978 to June
1979, she travelled throughout the U.S.S.R.
staying two weeks in each town or city. Her
primary duty was to respond to questions. In
addition to strictly agricultural questions,
Niles also had to deal with queries such as
"Why is there so much crime in New York?"
and "Why is there so much unemployment
in America?" But she was not told by the U.S.
government how to respond to the ques
tions; she was only told to use her own
judgment.
"In Moscow, people did not care much
about agriculture; they think of themselves
as too sophisticated for that. Ninety percent
of the questions were non-agricultural. The
Russians tended to ask the same questions
over and over again: education, crime, un
employment, medical care, and only an oc
casional question about U.S. foreign policy.
They are mostly interested in comparing
how Russians live with the way Americans
live, like 'How much do your jeans cost?"
When she had finished hertourof duty on
the agricultural exhibit, she got a job with a
tour agency and led several tours to the
Soviet Union. After tiringof that she decided
on law school and got a job as a paralegal in
New York City. She had been at Stanford
Law School two years when she heard about
the debate trip.
According to Niles, the audiences at the
debates "weren't terribly informed; rather
they were informed of one viewpoint only."

Although they were the "young elite, the
educated class, the Comisimol group," but
Niles believes they came mostly "out of
curiosity, not open-mindedness.
"These educated Soviets tend to believe
that everything is bad in the United States,
while they know everone wants to emigrate to
the United States. They believe people die in
the streets in America, but they also believe
the streets are paved with gold."
Niles did notice some regional differences
in the audiences' reactions. In Volgagard the
audience laughed when the debate team
talked about the persecutions of dissidents
in the U.S.S.R. and the Stalinist purges, and
the invasion of Afghanistan. There was only
modest, polite applause.
Niles's greatest satisfaction during the de
bate trip came when "scoring a point, when
they had to stop and think, when they could
say to themselves that she is right. They
would not say it aloud but they might say it to
themselves."
One example came during the Estonian
debate:"There was a question about
(former Secretary of State Alexander) Haig's
saying that there were some things more
important than peace. I said that freedom
was worth defending and protecting, free
dom to go and to say and to read what you
want. The Estonians applauded. . . in Es

tonia we had our most sympathetic audi
ence."
"Another thing that impressed the Soviets
was that though we "'°re representing the
United States, none of us had voted for Re
agan; that showed the plurality of the Ameri
can system."
"I he debate team was repeatedly frus
trated by Soviet tactics which did not give it
the opportunity to respond to all the Soviet
charges. "They would accuse us of having
expensive education, but they would never
give us a chance to describe low tuition state
schools, financial aid, etc. They would speak
about high U.S. unemployment without giv
ing us a chance to describe welfare or un
employment insurance."
Skundvich, one of the other members of
the debate team, said that the three of them
blended together well. "There were times

Skundvk h also related a story about Niles
"putting away more champagne than any
body else" while on a tour ot a Soviet c ham
pagne factory.
When asked about her strongest criticism

Union reflected aspects of everyday life. She
saw how few goods were for sale in the
shops; she noticed how the people tend to
walk with their hands in their pockets and
with their head down.
But she later learned during the festival of
White Nights that the Soviets also knew how
to drink vodka and to dance the polka in the
streets. She particularly remembered a
crowd of Soviets singing along with the En
glish words of a Paul McCartney and Wings
album beingplayed through a loud speaker.
When her summer in the Soviet Union
had ended she was anxious to return to the
United States. She missed fresh fruits and
vegetables most, but she also missed "the
feeling of being able to do whatever you
want to do, to go wherever you want to
go. . . Every time a plane leaves the Soviet
Union or lands in the West there is
applause."
Although her experience had been more
"educational" than "enjoyable," she was
committed to returning.
After finishing at Harvard, Niles looked for
a job which would utilize her Russian. "I
learned that there aren't very many jobs
available using Russian. An undergraduate
degree in Russian is not saleable."
She did find a job working in a personnel
agency which she hated, however. When an
opportunity arose to work on a US agricul
tural exhibit in the Soviet Union for seven
months she seized it.
On her second trip, from fall 1978 to June
1979, she travelled throughout the U.S.S.R.
staying two weeks in each town or city. Her
primary duty was to respond to questions. In
addition to strictly agricultural questions,
Niles also had to deal with queries such as
"Why is there so much crime in New York?"
and "Why is there so much unemployment
in America?" But she was not told by the U.S.
government how to respond to the ques
tions; she was only told to use her own
judgment.
"In Moscow, people did not care much
about agriculture; they think of themselves
as too sophisticated for that. Ninety percent
of the questions were non-agricultural. The
Russians tended to ask the same questions
over and over again: education, crime, un
employment, medical care, and only an oc
casional question about U.S. foreign policy.
They are mostly interested in comparing
how Russians live with the way Americans
live, like 'How much do your jeans cost?"
When she had finished hertourof duty on
the agricultural exhibit, she got a job with a
tour agency and led several tours to the
Soviet Union. After tiringof that she decided
on law school and got a job as a paralegal in
New York City. She had been at Stanford
Law School two years when she heard about
the debate trip.
According to Niles, the audiences at the
debates "weren't terribly informed; rather
they were informed of one viewpoint only."

Although they were the "young elite, the
educated class, the Comisimol group," but
Niles believes they came mostly "out of
curiosity, not open-mindedness.
"These educated Soviets tend to believe
that everything is bad in the United States,
while they know everone wants to emigrate to
the United States. They believe people die in
the streets in America, but they also believe
the streets are paved with gold."
Niles did notice some regional differences
in the audiences' reactions. In Volgagard the
audience laughed when the debate team
talked about the persecutions of dissidents
in the U.S.S.R. and the Stalinist purges, and
the invasion of Afghanistan. There was only
modest, polite applause.
Niles's greatest satisfaction during the de
bate trip came when "scoring a point, when
they had to stop and think, when they could
say to themselves that she is right. They
would not say it aloud but they might say it to
themselves."
One example came during the Estonian
debate:"There was a question about
(former Secretary of State Alexander) Haig's
saying that there were some things more
important than peace. I said that freedom
was worth defending and protecting, free
dom to go and to say and to read what you
want. The Estonians applauded. . . in Es

tonia we had our most sympathetic audi
ence."
"Another thing that impressed the Soviets
was that though we "'°re representing the
United States, none of us had voted for Re
agan; that showed the plurality of the Ameri
can system."
"I he debate team was repeatedly frus
trated by Soviet tactics which did not give it
the opportunity to respond to all the Soviet
charges. "They would accuse us of having
expensive education, but they would never
give us a chance to describe low tuition state
schools, financial aid, etc. They would speak
about high U.S. unemployment without giv
ing us a chance to describe welfare or un
employment insurance."
Skundvich, one of the other members of
the debate team, said that the three of them
blended together well. "There were times
when we didn't agree on politcal issues. . . .
Niles played the peacemaker. She tried to
find the common ground between overly
conciliatory positions and angering them."
According to Skundvich, Niles is very
gracious, sociable, "the first on the dance
floor" and uninhibited. "She has a very
strong will and is amazingly disciplined: she
studied her law books on trains, planes,
buses and while waiting for the subway! She
got up before any of the others to go jogging

each morning; there were only two or three
days the whole trip when she didn't jog!"
Skundvk h also related a story about Niles
"putting away more champagne than any
body else" while on a tour ot a Soviet c ham
pagne factory.
When asked about her strongest criticism
of the Soviet Union, Niles responded, it is
the lack of information, the lack ot freedom
of thought, that there is no discussion of
political alternatives, the 'we trust our gov
ernment' syndrom."
The best things about the U.S.S.R. are the
bread, caviar and subways. their soci
ety basically works for them. The average
Soviet is as content with his system as the
average American, rhey don't wake upevery
morning feeling oppressed, (hey compare
themselves with how it use to be, not with
America. The U.S.S.R. is not a bad place for
most people to live.''
In defending the United States, Niles
found it most difficult to justity U.S. defense
policies. It was explained that the United
States was afraid of the U.S.S.R. but the Soviets
did not see why we should be afraid, (hey
have no idia how much they spend on military,
so they can't believe that their government is
in any way threatening war. I hey think they
have a pacifist government
Niles said ." Tne average Soviet is not afraid
of the U.S. . . rhey think that President Re
agan is the cievil himself, but they recognize
that Americans on a one to one basis want
peace as much as they do.
"Ihey think that they would never start a
war because they have suffered so much in
war, but they think that the U.S. doesn't
really know what war is, so we might start
one."
The argument that carried the most weight
was not that there is no freedom of thought
or speech in the Soviet Union. "They have
not been brought up that way," Niles said.
More persuasive is the freedom to travel and
to do what you want. . . They also love the
idea of enterpreneurship, but they don't like
the idea of taking risks — they want welfare
and the State to protect them, and the ability
to get rich. Consumer goods also seem very
appealing."
Michael Sternick, a classmate and friend of
Niles' at the Law School, said that he was im
pressed with her insightful (omments in class.
"She has a nice personality, is intelligent and
articulate. She knows when the 9 DO bus
leaves."
Niles said that her most ret ent experience
in the Soviet Union made her "even more
set" on making a lite contribution to world
peace. "I got a sense of mission. I want In
educate Americans about the Soviet
Union."
Her immediate post-graduate plans are to
go to work for ludge Eugene Wright ot the
9th Circuit Court in Seattle. After that she is
unsure but is thinking about applying for a
scholarship to study in the Soviet Union. Her
long-term dream would be to (each interna
tional law and Soviet studies.
Niles said Stanford students are generally
better informed than most people. But she is
also convinced that students here tend to be
"wrapped up in themselves and apathetic
about national and international affairs."

Two weeks ago Margaret Niles, a 27-year
old third-year student at the Stanford Law
School, was flown to Washington D.C. to
meet privately with Secretary of State
George Shultz in order to relate her im
pressions of the Soviet Union. Shultz had
seen Niles on a television documentary film
describing her tour of the Soviet Union as a
member of a three-person debate team rep
resenting the United States.
In addition to her regular coursework,
Niles was also finishing up her tenure as
assistant managing editor of the Law Review
and arranging the catering of a law school
graduation event.
Last October 10 through 23 Niles and her
two partners, John Tokolish, a staffer for
Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.), and Bill
Skundvich, formerly a Slavic graduate stu
dent at Pittsburgh University, travelled to
the Soviet Union. They visited Moscow,
Baku in Azerbaidjan, Volgagrad (formerly
Stalingrad), Leningrad, Tartu in Estonia, and
Kiev to debate Soviet professors and
graduate students on the topic "War and
Peace in the Soviet and American Systems of
Value."
The Speech Communications Associa
tion, a group of professors and scholars who
organize the American college debate sys
tem and who have been arranging such de
bates with the Soviet Union for the last 10
years, arranged the debates. The Council on
International Discussion and Debate sent
Niles the application and later selected her,
Skundvich and Tokolish from a group of six
finalists asked to come to Washington to
give sample debate speeches.
According to Niles, "The biggest question
in my mind was how to present the American
point of view; then I realized that there was
no single American point of view, that I
could only speak for myself, that I could not
speak for America."
After she had been selected, Niles was not
at all apprehensive about travelling to the
U.S.S.R. — she had been there several times
before and knew there was "nothing to
worry about . . . unless you're making
trouble." But Niles was apprehensive about
her Russian, since she had not used it in two
years, and about her command of current
events, since she believed she had been out
of touch with the world while in law school.
Although she was of Russian heritage and
had been a member of the Russian club
while in high school in Portland, Oregon,
Niles did not begin studying Russian until
her undergraduate years at Harvard. "When
I took first year Russian I fell in love with it. It
was so much fun."
Niles said she "never found anything bor
ing about Russia," whether literature or his
tory. But it was her budding interest in inter
national relations, especially relations with
the other nuclear superpower, which led
her to major in Slavic Languages and Litera
ture. She graduated "cum laude" from Har
vard in 1977.
She took her first trip to the Soviet Union
while she was still an undergraduate at Har
vard. She went on a summer program spon
sored by the Council on International Educa

tion Exchange to study intensive Russian at
the Leningrad State University. Besides
learning grammar and phonetics, the stu
dents were taken on a number of excursions
to the sights around Leningrad and on a two
week trip to Moscow and Georgia.
Niles' initial impressions of the Soviet
Union reflected aspects of everyday life. She
saw how few goods were for sale in the
shops; she noticed how the people tend to
walk with their hands in their pockets and
with their head down.
But she later learned during the festival of
White Nights that the Soviets also knew how
to drink vodka and to dance the polka in the
streets. She particularly remembered a
crowd of Soviets singing along with the En
glish words of a Paul McCartney and Wings
album beingplayed through a loud speaker.
When her summer in the Soviet Union
had ended she was anxious to return to the
United States. She missed fresh fruits and
vegetables most, but she also missed "the
feeling of being able to do whatever you
want to do, to go wherever you want to
go. . . Every time a plane leaves the Soviet

"She has a nice personality, is intelligent and
articulate. She knows when the 9 DO bus
leaves."
Niles said that her most ret ent experience
in the Soviet Union made her "even more
set" on making a lite contribution to world
peace. "I got a sense of mission. I want In
educate Americans about the Soviet
Union."
Her immediate post-graduate plans are to
go to work for ludge Eugene Wright ot the
9th Circuit Court in Seattle. After that she is
unsure but is thinking about applying for a
scholarship to study in the Soviet Union. Her
long-term dream would be to (each interna

better informed than most people. But she is
also convinced that students here tend to be
"wrapped up in themselves and apathetic
about national and international affairs."
