# Hoover Institution: partisan politics or balanced research?

During Ronald Reagan's transition to the
presidency in 1981, a sign posted at the door
to the Hoover Institution read, "Will the last
one to leave tor Washington please turn out
the lights?" When George Marotta,
Hoover's public relations director, tells this
anecdote, he is quick to note the sign was a
prank. However, an apparently growing
number of faculty members are objecting to
what they claim is Hoover's substantial in
volvement in partisan politics.
A petition aimed at placing a resolution
protesting Hoover's alleged partisanship on
the Academic Senate agenda claims that

"the existence of a partisan organization,
whether liberal or conservative, within the
University raises grave questions concern
ingacadernic independence" and Stanford's
national reputation.
Two faculty members who initiated the
petition, Political Science Prof. John Manley
and English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, argue that
"Hoover is a two-tiered organization."
In a nine-page memo Manley addressed to
the political science faculty, he wrote that
"in assessing the political nature of Hoover
we must distinguish sharply" between Stan
ford faculty with joint or courtesy appoint
ments at Hoover and the "regular or perma
nent research staff of the Hoover Institu
tion," who are not members of the Stanford
faculty.

Stanford faculty associated with Hoover
"do in fact add greatly to its prestige," he
said, but the "regular staff is now and always
has been openly and proudly and domi
nantly conservative."
Manley and Rebholz and several other
professors interviewed by the Daily, some of
whom had signed the petition, also argue
that the books and articles published by
Hoover's regular staff consist mostly of pol
icy advocacy with a .predictable ideological
coloration. They distinguish such "policy re
search" from the theoretical and empirical
work they say is typically pviblished by the
Stanford faculty.
Marotta disagrees that Hoover promotes
any particular ideology. "The Institution
does not take positions on things, so it can

not be partisan by definition."
University President Donald Kennedy said
in an interview last week that "although a
number of things they do come out as re
flecting a conservative political stance, I
would say they are not partisan."
Seymour Martin Lipset, a senior fellow at
Hoover and a professor of political science
and sociology in the University, said there is
an increasing diversity of view among
Hoover fellows, and that not even the con
servatives on the staff always agree with Re
agan.
An example cited by Marotta is Thomas
Moore, who runs the Institution's domestic
studies program. Moore is a frequent critic
of Reagan's regulatory policies. He claims to

be a supporter of the Libertarian Party and
has a commendation letter from Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.) praising his role in
passing airline deregulation. Marotta him
self has served seven presidents of both par
ties.
Marotta, Lipset and William Brody, a pro
fessor of political science who wrote an
open letter to his department's faculty seek
ing to rebut Manley's memo, suggest that
Hoover critics are motivated principally by
political disagreement with conservative so
cial policies.

critics interviewed by the Daily all adamantly
