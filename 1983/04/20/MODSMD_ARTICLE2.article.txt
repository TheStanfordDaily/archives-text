# Hoover Institution: partisan politics or balanced research?

(Second in ? three-part series)
During Ronald Reagan's transition to the
presidency in 1981, a sign posted at the door
to the Hoover Institution read, "Will the last
one to leave tor Washington please turn out
the lights?" When George Marotta,
Hoover's public relations director, tells this
anecdote, he is quick to note the sign was a
prank. However, an apparently growing
number of faculty members are objecting to
what they claim is Hoover's substantial in
volvement in partisan politics.
A petition aimed at placing a resolution
protesting Hoover's alleged partisanship on
the Academic Senate agenda claims that

"the existence of a partisan organization,
whether liberal or conservative, within the
University raises grave questions concern
ingacadernic independence" and Stanford's
national reputation.
Two faculty members who initiated the
petition, Political Science Prof. John Manley
and English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, argue that
"Hoover is a two-tiered organization."
In a nine-page memo Manley addressed to
the political science faculty, he wrote that
"in assessing the political nature of Hoover
we must distinguish sharply" between Stan
ford faculty with joint or courtesy appoint
ments at Hoover and the "regular or perma
nent research staff of the Hoover Institu
tion," who are not members of the Stanford
faculty.

Stanford faculty associated with Hoover
"do in fact add greatly to its prestige," he
said, but the "regular staff is now and always
has been openly and proudly and domi
nantly conservative."
Manley and Rebholz and several other
professors interviewed by the Daily, some of
whom had signed the petition, also argue
that the books and articles published by
Hoover's regular staff consist mostly of pol
icy advocacy with a .predictable ideological
coloration. They distinguish such "policy re
search" from the theoretical and empirical
work they say is typically pviblished by the
Stanford faculty.
Marotta disagrees that Hoover promotes
any particular ideology. "The Institution
does not take positions on things, so it can

not be partisan by definition."
University President Donald Kennedy said
in an interview last week that "although a
number of things they do come out as re
flecting a conservative political stance, I
would say they are not partisan."
Seymour Martin Lipset, a senior fellow at
Hoover and a professor of political science
and sociology in the University, said there is
an increasing diversity of view among
Hoover fellows, and that not even the con
servatives on the staff always agree with Re
agan.
An example cited by Marotta is Thomas
Moore, who runs the Institution's domestic
studies program. Moore is a frequent critic
of Reagan's regulatory policies. He claims to

be a supporter of the Libertarian Party and
has a commendation letter from Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.) praising his role in
passing airline deregulation. Marotta him
self has served seven presidents of both par
ties.
Marotta, Lipset and William Brody, a pro
fessor of political science who wrote an
open letter to his department's faculty seek
ing to rebut Manley's memo, suggest that
Hoover critics are motivated principally by
political disagreement with conservative so
cial policies.
Manley, Rebholz, Dallin and other Hoover
critics interviewed by the Daily all adamantly
disagreed, stating that they would
oppose any partisan think tank on
campus be it ideologically left, right
or center. One current Hoover
senior fellow, who asked not to be
identified, agreed that "there is an
issue of academic integrity" which
could not be lightly dismissed re
gardless of the political affiliation of
faculty critical of Hoover.
The debate over Hoover's objectiv
ity actually involves two related is
sues: whether Hoover has promoted
a particular political party or candi
date, a situation faculty critics warn
could endanger the Institution's
tax-exempt status; and whether the
academic output of the Institution is
ideologically diverse or one-sided.
Faculty complaints about partisan
ship center around ties to the Reagan
campaign and administration.
"There are 43 present or former fel
lows of the Hoover Institution who
have full-time or advisory positions
in the Reagan administration," ac
cording to Marotta.
Only three of these are current
Hoover fellows on leave, Marotta
said, lohn Cogan is an associate di
rector of the Office of Management
and Budget and Darrell Trent is dep

uty secretary of Transportation.
Philip Habib, the president's special
envoy to the Middle East peace
negotiations, also served as a special
ambassador for President Jimmy Car
ter. Most of the 43 affiliations to the
Reagan administration represent
Hoover fellows who have already re
signed from the administration, or
who serve the administration only
part-time through participation on
advisory boards and task forces.
Reagan has praised Hoover for its
role in his election, according to the
1981 and 1982 Hoover annual report.
At a White House reception honor
ing the Hoover Hoard of Over
seers, Reagan said Hoover "built
the knowledge base that made the
changes now taking place in Wash
ington possible."
At a dinner honoring the Hoover
Board shortly before his inaugura
tion in 1981, Reagan thanked Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell for pro
viding more people to help with "my
campaign than from any other in
stitution." Most of the 43 Hoover fel
lows with an affiliation to the Reagan
administration worked on the Re
agan for President campaign, though
most had part-time advisory posi
tions and did not take leaves of ab
sence from Hoover.
For example, Martin Anderson be
came Reagan's chiet domestic policy

adviser during the campaign and as
sistant to the president for policy de
velopment in the administration,
until he resigned late last year to re
turn to Hoover. In his "Policy
Memorandum Number 1" which he
wrote before taking a leave from
Hoover to work full-time on the Re
agan campaign, Anderson laid out
the spending-and-tax cut policies
which would ultimately become
known as "Reaganomics."
Complaints about Hoover's ties to
conservative campaigns and candi
dates are not unique to the Reagan
presidency. In the late l%os, when
Richard Nixon was president, stu
dents protesting against Hoover
claimed it was a training ground for
the Nixon White House. In 1969 two
Hoover fellows were on leave to
serve as deputy assistant secretaries
of defense and two others as eco
nomic advisors in the White House.
Campbell himself took a leave in 19t>4
to work on Barry Goldwater's unsuc
cessful campaign for president.
Alexander Dallin, a professor of
history who had a joint appointment
as a Hoover senior fellow until he
resigned from the Institution in 1978,
said that there is no question that
Hoover is one-sided (politically), it
was set up with that intention."
Dallin said that while there are
some top-tlight academics who ' do
not share Hoover's values and
cause," there is "a core, an inner
sanctum of conservatives who con
trol Hoover."
In his memo to the political sci
ence faculty, Manley stated that "the
presence of distinguished faculty
adds to the reputation, legitimacy
and influence of a dominantly con
servative organization." He and Dal
lin said that by offering joint or cour
tesy appointments to a more ideolog
ically diverse group of tenured pro
fessors already at Stanford, Hoover
gains an "intellectual respectability"
that advances its cause.
Another Stanford professor who
held a joint appointment as a Hoover
senior fellow during the 19705, but
k who requested anonymity, said he
"ended up there as part of a con
scious effort to make Hoover more
academically respectable." There
was "a conscious effort to bring in

some people who were not so
right-wing ideologically," he said.
Ten years ago Hoover was a
"paranoid institution," he said, since
it feared influential members of the
Stanford faculty and administration
wanted to put constraints on
Hoover. The fact that it was in
Hoover's interest to gain academic
credibility gives the University lever
age with them. "There's no such
thing as one-way co-optation.
Hoover is trying to buy respectabil
ity, but the price they have to pay is
greater diversity," he said.
Dallin said his experience as a
senior fellow was different. "There
were people on the faculty side who
thought the only way to influence
Hoover was to get a foot in the door
by placing tenured faculty over
there," Dallin said. "I have come to
believe that will not work; you'll
never change the inner sanctum."
Several professors claim the
academic output of the Hoover fel
lows who are not Stanford professors

consists almost entirely of conserva
tive policy advocacy. "At Hoover,
nine times out of 10, when you open
one of their publications you know in
advance what conclusions they will
reach," Dallin said.
In their respective memos to de
partment colleagues, Manley and
Rebholz list scores of books and arti
cles by the regular staff at Hoover
which Manley claims demonstrate,
"the great bulk appears to be con
servative policy research." The titles
they cite include: Affirmative Action:
Negative Results, by John H. Bunzel;
Arms Buildup Crucial to U.S.A., by
Peter Duignan; In Defense of the Cor
poration, by Robert Hessen; The
Wayward Welfare State , by Roger A.
Freeman; and The Tax Revolt , by
Alvin Rabushka.
The only book published by the
Hoover Institution Press and not
written by a Hoover fellow is The
Transition to a New Administration, by
Edwin Meese, Reagan's top aide.
Meese's book was published by
Hoover in 1981.

The faculty petition states that "the
legitimacy and influence of Hoover
Institution and the causes for which
it stands are immeasurably enhanced
by sharing in the prestige of a great
University."
Marotta and John Moore, as
sociate director of the Institution,
denied that Hoover benefits from
Stanford's reputation or that national
media characterizations of Hoover as
a "conservative think tank" harm
Stanford's reputation as a value
neutral University.
"The reputation of the Hoover In
stitution is at least equal to the Urn
versity's nationwide," Marotta said.
"It is a fallacy for them to say we
damage it."
But according to Charles Drek
meier, professor of political science
"when I talk about Stanford with
academics on the East Coast, what
always comes to mind is the Hoover
Tcwer and its whole right wing oper
ation." Drekmeier signed the
Academic Council petition.
