### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Stanford rookies handled
the defensive heroics while the
Veterans played longball here
Monday as the Cardinal won
their fourth game of a five-
series with UCLA 4-3.
Freshman second baseman
Pete Stanicek ended the game
with a diving stop in the bot
tom of the ninth that left the
Bruins' tying run stranded at
third base and the winning run
to reed out at second.
Since the game was a make
up game, UCLA was officially
the home team and batting in
,the bottom of the ninth with
two outs and runners on first
■and third. Rich Amaral lined
the ball up the middle, but
IStanicek dove right, made the
stop and flipped the ball to
shortstop John Verducci for
the game-ending out.
Freshman Kevin Kunkel
pitched seven innings to pick
up the win and improve his re
icord to 6-0, while veteran
leftfielder Mike Dotterer
blasted a solo home run in the
top of the seventh that gave
[Stanford a 4-2 lead and the
[winning margin.

Senior designated hitter Eric
Hardgrave padded his Stanford
one season record home run
total with his 15th of the sea
con
Sophomore jeff Ballard
pitched three innings and re
corded a save.
Despite sub-par run produc
tion, the Cardinal continued to
show signs of renewed hitting
vigor as Vince Sakowski had
two hits, including a triple, and
Mike Aldrete, Mark Davis and
Greg Lorenzetti each had two
hits for Stanford.
Stanford, now 30-9 overall
and 13-4 conference,
lengthened its lead in the
Southern Division of the
Pacific-10 (6-Pac) to four games
over second-place USC and
Arizona State.
Before the weekend series
against the Bruins, the Cardinal
lead had dwindled to one-half
game.
Yesterday's non-conference
game at Sonoma State was
postponed because of rain.
Stanford continues confer
ence play Friday in the first
