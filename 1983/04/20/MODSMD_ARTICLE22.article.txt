Stanford sophomore Elizabeth
"Leo" Archer has learned how to
carry a big load. Archer shouldered
the 50-pound golf bag of her
father—George Arc her—at the 1983
Masters and became the tourna
ment's first female caddy.
While unseasonal rains flooded
the Augusta greens two weeks ago,
word of Archer's arrival saturated
newspapers across the country.
Archer received more attention than
her father who finished tied for 12th
in one of the PGA's most prestigious
events.
"It was incredible," Archer said. "I
constantly had the press around
me."
Not only was it the first time a
woman was allowed to caddy, it was
also the first time players were per
mitted to bring their own caddies.
Traditionally, local club caddies
were provided. When Archer heard
that the Masters' officials had
changed their rigid stance on using
personal caddies, she begged her
father to take her to Georgia.
"I told him he just had to let me
go," recalled Archer. "I knew it was
a great opportunity which I didn't
want to miss."
Archer's father agreed to hire his
daughter, as long as she paid for her
own air fare. "My dad treats me like
his other caddies," the American
Studies major said. Archer received
a flat fee plus five percent of her
father's prize money. She made
about $750 for her recent "course"
work outside the classroom.
Archer did not expect to become
such an item at the Masters. She was
written up in this week'sSporfs Illus
trated and interviewed by 12
different television stations. The
novel caddy will even be listed in the
next Guinness Book of World Re
cords.
Being the Masters' only female
caddy did pose a few problems for
Archer. "I had to make sure no guys
were undressing in the locker room
before I could go in, get my clothes,
and then change in the pro shop,"
she laughed.
Archer said she had "fun meeting
the other caddies who came from
real different backgrounds." She
also became friends with some of
the world's best golfers. Archer es
pecially likes Tom Watson. "We're
even fraternity brothers," said
Archer who lives in Stanford's Alpha
Sig house.
Archer began caddying for her
father at occasional tournaments in
1980. During the next two summers,
Stanford sophomore Elizabeth
"Leo" Archer has learned how to
carry a big load. Archer shouldered
