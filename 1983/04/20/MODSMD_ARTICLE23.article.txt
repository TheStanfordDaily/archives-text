# Golfers' daughters at Stanford

she worked as a regular on the pro
tour. Lugging around a set of clubs is
rather easy, "unless it's hot or hilly,"
she said. "Sometimes back East, it'll
be 115 degrees with 99 percent
humidity. That's when you'll be dy
ing."
Because Archer throws the discus
and javelin for Stanford's track team,
she has developed incredible mus
cles. While training for her favorite
sport—track—she has been known
to lift 175 pounds.
To be a qualified caddy, Archer
did have to learn golf etiquette, how
to read the greens and figure out
what clubs her father would use. Un
like some caddies, Archer seldom
gives her father golfing advice.
"He's got 20 years of experience, so
nothing I could say would really help
hi n." she explained.
Archer and her younger sister fol
low golf, but neither plays. "Until a
few years ago, I didn't like golf be
cause I didn't really understand it,"
admitted Archer. Now Archer loves
watching golt and admires her
father's dedication.
"Ever since I caddied, I became a
fan," she said. "After spending more
time with him on tour, we got to be
great friends. I never appreciated
what he cJid until I saw what he actu
ally experienced out there."
Although Archer likes having a
golting father, it does have a few
drawbacks. When I was younger,
he was never home," she said. "It's
also hard on my mom, because she's

only with him a third of the year. She
often had to be both a mother and
father. However, we're still a real
close family," Archer added.
The Arc hers live in a country home
in Gilroy, Calif. "We're not spoiled
celebrity kids at all," Archer said.
"My dad is disciplined in golf and
that carries over into our home.
We've always had to work and get
jobs on our own."
Now that Archer has set aside her
father's clubs, at least until the PGA
Championships, she plans to con
centrate on her studies and track.
Archer however is not the only
student on campus who has a pro
fessional golfing father. Sophomore
Lee Ann Geiberger also giow up on
golfing greens. Her father, Al
Geiberger, is a former PGA Champ
ion and has won over $ i million in
career earnings.
Ironically, Geiberger knew Archer
when they were toddlers tramping
on the tees behind their fathers.
Both girls spent their childhoods on
the tour until they entered grade
school. Once they reached that age,
only summers were spent on the
golfing circuit.
"I was really surprised when I
found out that Leo was coming to
Stanford," said Geiberger. "We
hadn't seen each other for years,
and then we were both assigned to
Branner (Hall) last year."
Like Archer, Geiberger missed
having her father home during the
school year. However, she did enjoy

traveling with him. "I've met a lot of
different people and visited some
fun places," she .-.aid. "It's great he
cause I have friends all over the
country."
Geiberger has been introdui ed to
several sports personalities and
other celebrities through her (other,
including Gerald Ford, Kay Bolger,
Jack Lemmon and Clint Fastwood.
Geiberger is the first to admit that
a professional golfer is constantly
faced with tension and anxiety. "You
always have to worry week to week
whether you make the ( ut and can
bring home enough money to make
it all worthwhile," she explained.
Yet Geiberger cannot imagine her
father pursuing another career. "He
just loves golf. Even when he's in a '
slump, I've never heard him say he's
tired of playing or ready to quit."
like most golfers, Geiberger is
forced to lead a mobile, busy life. He
gives dozens of clinics each year,
does various company promotions,
serves on a national sports council
and acts as director of golf at a Col
orado resort.
"The most exasperating thing
about my Dad's joI) is when
everyone else wants his time, and I
do too," Geiberger said.
Geiberger is another golfer's
daughter who does not own a set of
clubs and prefers to be a spectator
rather than an active participant.
When she was younger, Geiberger
decided to channel her athletic abili
ties into ballet and horseback riding.
Last year Geiberger enrolled in a
beginninggolf class, "but I still can't
really play," she said. "My dad tells
me I have a nice swing, until a ball is
placed in front of me."
Although her father tried to give
her lessons about twice a year, "he
never pushed me at all," Geiberger
recalled. "He didn't push my little
brother, either, but lohn always
wanted to play." Geiberger s 14-
year-old brother is already compet
ing in tournaments and ha> aspira
tions of playing golf profession ill\
Geiberger says she is one of her
Dad's biggest fans. The English
major keeps track of tournament re
sults in the newspaper and talks to
him on the phone every few weeks.
"I havea big phone bill every month,
but it's definitely worth it," she said.
"When we talk, I try to give him
encouragement, remind him of all
the good things he's done, and tell
him not to worry if he's had a bad
round."
Being the daughter of a pro golfer
has required certain sacrifices, but
Geiberger said she "would not want
a businessman-type dad anyway."
