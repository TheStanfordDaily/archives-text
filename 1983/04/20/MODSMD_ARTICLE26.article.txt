# Women a close 2nd in West Coast golf
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford's golf teams have
been in a number of close
tournaments recently. In fact,
the men's team beat USC in the
U.S. Intercollegiates this past
weekend by one stroke on the
iinal hole of play.
But the two-round women's
West Coast Intercollegiates at
the par-73 Villages Country
Club in San Jose got to the
point of ridiculousness.
Stanford and San Jose State
tied after the 3b holes of regula
tion play, each team totaling a
two-round 618.
As is customary in team golf,
the tie was broken by the
scores of the teams' sixth (or
non-counting) golfers over the
final round. San Jose State's
Amy Ellertson shot an 81. Stan
ford's Diane Nixon could only
muster an 84.
Thus, the Spartans captured
the team title, followed by the
Cardinal and Sacramento
State, which finished well be
hind Stanford and San Jose
State with a 648.
Stanford, at least, placed first
in one area — the individual
competition. Joanne Pacillo

fired a two-round 149, three
shots lower than State's Nancy
Brown and Ann Walsh at 152.
The Card's Roxy Gumlia was
fourth individually with a 156,
while Nixon and Kathy Nino
tied with four others for eighth
at 160.
Also for Stanford, freshman
Kathy Kostas finished in 13th
with a 166.
The men's team, coming off
its big win last weekend at the
Intercollegiates, will partici
pate in the Aztec Invitational
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
The tourney, with nearly as
strong a field as at the Intercol
legiates, will be played at the
Torrey Pines Country Club in
the San Diego area.
Travellingto the Aztec Invita
tional for Stanford will be
Lanny Sawchuck, Lew Dickey,
Josh Mondry, Scott Erickson,
Jack Skilling and Carl Wagner,
who went south a day early to
participate in a national long
driving contest.
Wagner won a regional
long-driving competition a few
weeks ago with a 317-foot
drive.
