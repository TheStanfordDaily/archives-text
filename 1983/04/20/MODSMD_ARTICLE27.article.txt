Kuhn fines Steinbrenner
New York — George Steinbrenner,
principal owner of the New York Yan
kees, has been fined by baseball Com
missioner Bowie Kuhn for remarks critical
of National League umpires, the Ameri
can League club announced Monday
night.
"The fine will be paid," Steinbrenner
said in a statement released by his team.
He also apologized to National League
President Chub Feeney and the league's
umpires if they felt he had questioned
their integrity.
"The discipline has been imposed and
there will be no further comment," said

Bob Wirz, director of information for
Kuhn's office. He would not disclose the
amount of the fine.
Steinbrenner's suspension had been
urged by Richie Phillips, head of the Ma
jor League Umpires Association, who
charged that the Yankees owner had at
tacked the umpires' integrity in remarks
during a March 25 exhibition game
against the Montreal Expos.
Phillips at his home in Philadelphia saidi
he was "sorely disappointed in the type
penalty imposed."
"I don't think fining George Steinbren
ner serves as any kind of a deterrent to
somone with pockets as deep as his from
continuing to engage in this kind of con
duct," Phillips said.
Steinbrenner had complained that NL
umpires gave teams in their league a
break on close calls against American
League teams. The Yankees owner was
standing on the sidelines at the time and
had questioned a call at first base. He later
said his remarks were made privately to a
friend and were not meant to be over
heard by reporters who were nearby.

Attles to leave Warriors?
Oakland — Al Attles, who led the
Golden State Warriors from the National
Basketball Association basement to the
penthouse — and back down again —
may have coached his last game.
The announcement hasn't been made
yet — it's expected later this week — but it
appears the Warriors will let him leave
coaching for a front office job. The team
already is seeking a successor.
Officially, team officials weren't com
ment on Attles departure. But The Trib
une in Oakland said Monday Attles al
ready has been ousted and the San Fran
cisco Examiner reported it's all but cer
tain.
Several names have been mentioned as
successors, including John Bach, who has
been with the Warriors for five years.
Speculation has also included the name
of John Thompson, who's built the repu
tation of the Georgetown Hoyas in recent
years.
From the pro ranks, the men most often
mentioned are Cotton Fitzsimmons, now

head coach with the Kansas City Kings,
and Jack McKinney, now with the Indiana
Pacers. Both men have shown they can be
winners, and Fitzsimmons has the added
advantage of previous service with the
Warriors.
Cal lands top recruit
Berkeley — Kevin Johnson, the Sacra
mento High School guard who topped 50
points in two games and led the state in
scoring with a 32.8 average, is heading for
the UC-Berkeley.
Coach Dick Kuchen of the Bears an
nounced yesterday that Johnson has
signed a letter of intent, and the coach
said, "Kevin is the type of player that will
have an impact on our program. He has
great leadership ability and ballhandling
skills in addition to being an excellent
scorer."
Celts win playoff opener
Boston — Larry Bird scored eight of his
game-high 26 points in the final V/i
minutes last night, rallying the Boston

Celtics to a 103-95 victory over the Atlanta
Hawks in their National Basketball As
sociation playoff opener.
Bird, given a brief rest early in the
fourth period, came back to rally the
Celtics after the Hawks had charged from
an eight-point deficit to a four-point lead.
With the score tied for the sixth time in
the final period, Bird put Boston in front
89-87 with a pair of free throws.
The Celtics held off the desperate
Hawks for the opening victory in the best
of-three playoff.
Meyer takes marathon
Boston — Greg Meyer surged into the
lead with just over six miles left and won
his first Boston Marathon Monday. Joan
Benoit broke the woman's world best in
the grueling 26-mile, 385-yard race.
Meyer, 27, of suburban Wellesley, ov
ertook Benji Durden of Stone Mountain,
Ga., shortly before the 20-mile mark and
romped to victory in 2 hours, 9 minutes,
capping a brilliant eight-month assault on
U.S. road and track racing.

umpires if they felt he had questioned
their integrity.
"The discipline has been imposed and
there will be no further comment," said

Bob Wirz, director of information for
Kuhn's office. He would not disclose the
amount of the fine.
Steinbrenner's suspension had been
urged by Richie Phillips, head of the Ma
jor League Umpires Association, who
charged that the Yankees owner had at
tacked the umpires' integrity in remarks
during a March 25 exhibition game
against the Montreal Expos.
Phillips at his home in Philadelphia saidi
he was "sorely disappointed in the type
penalty imposed."
"I don't think fining George Steinbren
ner serves as any kind of a deterrent to
somone with pockets as deep as his from
continuing to engage in this kind of con
duct," Phillips said.
Steinbrenner had complained that NL
umpires gave teams in their league a
break on close calls against American
League teams. The Yankees owner was
standing on the sidelines at the time and
had questioned a call at first base. He later
said his remarks were made privately to a
friend and were not meant to be over
heard by reporters who were nearby.

Attles to leave Warriors?
Oakland — Al Attles, who led the
Golden State Warriors from the National
Basketball Association basement to the
penthouse — and back down again —
may have coached his last game.
The announcement hasn't been made
yet — it's expected later this week — but it
appears the Warriors will let him leave
coaching for a front office job. The team
already is seeking a successor.
Officially, team officials weren't com
ment on Attles departure. But The Trib
une in Oakland said Monday Attles al
ready has been ousted and the San Fran
cisco Examiner reported it's all but cer
tain.
Several names have been mentioned as
successors, including John Bach, who has
been with the Warriors for five years.
Speculation has also included the name
of John Thompson, who's built the repu
tation of the Georgetown Hoyas in recent
years.
From the pro ranks, the men most often
mentioned are Cotton Fitzsimmons, now

head coach with the Kansas City Kings,
and Jack McKinney, now with the Indiana
Pacers. Both men have shown they can be
winners, and Fitzsimmons has the added
advantage of previous service with the
Warriors.
Cal lands top recruit
Berkeley — Kevin Johnson, the Sacra

points in two games and led the state in

the UC-Berkeley.
Coach Dick Kuchen of the Bears an

signed a letter of intent, and the coach
said, "Kevin is the type of player that will
have an impact on our program. He has
great leadership ability and ballhandling
skills in addition to being an excellent
scorer."
Celts win playoff opener
Boston — Larry Bird scored eight of his

an eight-point deficit to a four-point lead.

of-three playoff.
Meyer takes marathon

Meyer, 27, of suburban Wellesley, ov
ertook Benji Durden of Stone Mountain,
Ga., shortly before the 20-mile mark and

capping a brilliant eight-month assault on
