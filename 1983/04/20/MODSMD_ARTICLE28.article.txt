# Overseas applications stable despite Cliveden shutdown

Even though the Overseas Studies Office will not offer
a program in England next year, it has not received more
applications than usual for its other foreign campuses.
Because the University is closing the Cliveden campus
next autumn and will not open the Oxford campus until
1984, students wishing to spend a quarter abroad in
England next year through Overseas Studies will not be
able to do so.
But this lack of opportunity has not led the disgruntled
students to apply to other campuses.
Accordingto Daryl Sawyer, Overseas Studies adminis
trative assistant, Overseas Studies language require
ments make it difficult tor students who had been plan
ning to study in England to switch to another campus.
Because studying at a campus in a country other than
England requires at least two quarters of language prep-

aration, students who had been planning to study at
Cliveden next year are often not qualified to apply to
other programs, Sawyer said Students who still want to
spend part of next year in England can apply to other
programs outside the aegis of the Overseas Studies Of
fice, she said.
According to Patricia Clark. Overseas Studies as
sociate financial director, officials decided to close the
Cliveden campus before the opening of Stanford-in-
Oxford because the Overseas Studies Office "can use
the money."
Calling Cliveden an "extremely expensive center,"
Clark said the temporary shutdown of the England pro
gram will enable the Overseas Studies Office to finance
Cliveden's closing costs without asking the University
for any additional funds. If any money is left over, Clark
said, it will be spent on the Oxford center.
