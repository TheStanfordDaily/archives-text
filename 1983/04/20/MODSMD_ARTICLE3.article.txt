# Student residence damages decrease
## 
### JULIANN ANDERSON Staff writer 
Breaking a window, losing a room
key, "borrowing" a house lamp or
otherwise damaging a University re
sidence can be expensive — last
year's total fines topped the six
figure mark. University officials re
port that abuse of the dorms and
houses is lessening, however.
"I do know that the amount of
damages is down considerably," said
Ed Scoles, director of housing
management, who estimated the
damage fines collected in '81 -'82 at
$115,000.
Lucy Williams, office coordinator
for the Row and Cluster Houses, said
students have become more aware
of the damages because of last year's
emphasis on identifying and fining
violators.
"People are becoming more re
sponsible in their houses, and
they're keeping them cleaner," Wil
liams said. "I'm really happy with
them."
But this does not mean that the
problem has been eliminated. Ill
treatment and even vandalism, such
as some window-smashings at Roble
Hall, still occur.
Victoria Baker, Stern Hall residen
tial education assistant, sent out bills
to Stern residents totalling $593 last
November, and the figure leapt to
$953 in Deccmber-january. New reg
ulations have not been the cause of
this, she said. "Policy hasn't changed
— we just keep very good track
now."

She said that when damage is in
curred, either the guilty student or
the house — if the perpetrator can
not be found — is sent a notice of
intent to bill. Then, whoever receives
the notice has two weeks to either
bring Baker the money or negotiate
with the residential manager's office
in Crothers Memorial Hall.
The most common damages are
broken windows, lost keys and party
messes.
"We have extraordinary cleanup
after parties, so they get charged $10
an hour for that," Baker said.
Typical charges, which she said are
similar across campus, are: re
keying, $38; 1st-floor window re
placement, $55 to $60; 2nd-floor
window, $60 to $65; and 3rd-floor
window; $75.
Compared to various commercial
glass company estimates in Palo Alto,
students seem to be gettinga bargain
for replaced panes. The West Coast
Glass Company estimated a $110
charge for a 1st-floor replacement.
Royal Class and Mirror estimated $73
for the same job, while National
Glass wanted $81. A 3rd-floor task
can cost as much as $270, including
scaffolding if needed and extra labor.
Locksmiths, however, undercut
the University. Certified Lock and
Safe Company of Palo Alto quoted
the national average re-keying cost
to be $31.50, although the firm itself
charges $28.
