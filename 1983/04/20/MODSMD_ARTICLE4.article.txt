Casa Zapata freshmen Mary Garcia (right) and Lucy Carleton react appropriately as they open the
envelope containing draw number 3185. After one group drew 0004 from the bottom left corner of the
chest, word spread that this was the lucky spot; however, Dave Walton, student draw coordinator, said
that this proved untrue as students began pulling numbers in the 4000s from this corner. Numbers one,
two and three remain in the box. The housing draw continues at Tresidder through Friday.
