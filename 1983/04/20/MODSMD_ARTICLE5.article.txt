# ASSU validates election

### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Despite charges of improper poll
ing procedures, the ASSU Senate
last night voted overwhelmingly to
validate last week's campus elec
tions. Fee assessment winners and
senators-elect aren't safe yet, how
ever, as Elections Commissioner
Craig Spearman warned that the
commission might recommend dis
qualification of some winners before
the senate votes to certify the actual
results at its next meeting.
Commenting on the possibility of
election disqualifications, Spearman
told the senate: "Before certification
of the (election) results two weeks
from today, please be prepared to
vote on whether or not certain can
didates or fee assessment sponsors
. . . (should be) disqualified."
When Council of Presidents
member Mark Epstein asked Spear
man if there would be "a lot of
people recommended for disqualifi
cation," Spearman declined to
comment. Epstein joked, "I thought
everyone violated the election
rules."
Graduate senator Erik Thompson
charged that polling in his district,
the Graduate School of Business,
was conducted improperly. He
claimed that graduate student ballots
were not available in the primarily
graduate student district until 12:15
p.m., 45 minutes after the polls
opened, "at which point many of the
members of the district had left for
the day."
Spearman explained, "There was
such a large voter turnout that we ran
out of graduate ballots (at the Busi
ness School) almost right away. That
is what I was told."
Thompson insisted that there were
no graduate ballots at the Business
School until 12:15 p.m. He also
charged that the polling place was
located in an obscure corner of the
school and moved to a more central
location only after 1:15 p.m., 15 min
utes before the poll was to close. He
abstained in the vote to validate the
elections.
Senate Chair Raga Elim said he was
forming a committee to be com
posed of any senators interested in
reviewing the conduct of the elec
tion and the election rules. The
committee will "start hammering out
suggestions for change" for the con
sideration of the senate, according to
Elim.
In other action, ASSU Lobby Di
rector John Hoffmire commented on
the failure of his group's efforts to
obtain a fee assessment. "We gave it
a gallant try and came up a little bit

short. I'm disappointed with the sen
ate for failing to endorse the fee re
quest (in the ASSU Elections Hand
book). I'm a little bit disappointed
that I wasn't invited to the meeting
that the senate endorsements were
done at."
The lobby will be financed next
year out of the ASSU Program Eee, a
fund usually used to finance groups
too small to win a place on the fee
assessment ballot. Hoffmire said the
lobby initially will concentrate on
student financial aid issues as well as
lobbying locally for more and
cheaper student housing.
