More bodies recovered at embassy
Beirut — Searchers recovered six more bodies from the
bomb-shattered U.S. Embassy yesterday and continued their
grim task, with at least 47 people believed killed in the worst
attack ever on a U.S. facility here.
There were 24 confirmed deaths and 23 other people were
missing and presumed dead.
Embassy spokesman John Reid said eight Americans were
confirmed dead and eight others were missing from the
massive explosion at lunchtime Monday. Among the con
firmed dead was Robert Clayton Ames, the ClA's Near East
and South Asian analyst, officials said in Washington in a rare
case of naming a CIA agent who worked abroad.
There was no clear picture of how the attack was carried
out, but most accounts said a terrorist drove an explosives

laden vehicle into the compound and perished in the blast.
Ten Lebanese embassy employees, visa applicants and vis
itors were confirmed dead, while 20 others were missing,
said Reid. The 47th victim listed was an embassy visitor of un
known nationality, he said.
The privately owned Central News Agency said the bomb
ing was an attempt to kill U.S. presidential envoy Philip
Habib and his assistant Morris Draper. It quoted unnamed
government officials as saying Habib and Draper had been
scheduled to be at the embassy when the bomb exploded at
1:05 p.m., but were delayed by talks with Lebanese leaders at
the presidential palace in suburban Baabda. U.S. Embassy of
ficials were not available for comment on that report.
Tax-withholding plan delayed
Washington — Senate leaders, bowing to intense lobbying

from the nation's bankers, worked out a compromise yester
day that would delay for four years — and perhaps forever —
the effect of a controversial law requiring the withholding of
income taxes on interest and dividends.
The compromise was reached after a day of legislative ma
neuvering between Sen. Bob Kasten (R-Wis.) who has led a
stubborn fight against the provision enacted by Congress last
year, and the chief Senate supporters of withholding, Re
publicans Robert Dole of Kansas and Ted Stevens of Alaska.
President Reagan has repeatedly vowed to veto any repeal
of the withholding provision, and White House aides were
consulted in an effort to produce a face-saving formula. Nev
ertheless, a Treasury Department official who asked to re
main anonymous said late yesterday that Secretary of the
Treasury Donald Regan was opposed to the plan.
