More bodies recovered at embassy
Beirut — Searchers recovered six more bodies from the
bomb-shattered U.S. Embassy yesterday and continued their
grim task, with at least 47 people believed killed in the worst
attack ever on a U.S. facility here.
There were 24 confirmed deaths and 23 other people were
missing and presumed dead.
Embassy spokesman John Reid said eight Americans were
confirmed dead and eight others were missing from the
massive explosion at lunchtime Monday. Among the con
firmed dead was Robert Clayton Ames, the ClA's Near East
and South Asian analyst, officials said in Washington in a rare
case of naming a CIA agent who worked abroad.
There was no clear picture of how the attack was carried
out, but most accounts said a terrorist drove an explosives

laden vehicle into the compound and perished in the blast.
Ten Lebanese embassy employees, visa applicants and vis
itors were confirmed dead, while 20 others were missing,
said Reid. The 47th victim listed was an embassy visitor of un
known nationality, he said.
The privately owned Central News Agency said the bomb
ing was an attempt to kill U.S. presidential envoy Philip
Habib and his assistant Morris Draper. It quoted unnamed
government officials as saying Habib and Draper had been
scheduled to be at the embassy when the bomb exploded at
1:05 p.m., but were delayed by talks with Lebanese leaders at
the presidential palace in suburban Baabda. U.S. Embassy of
ficials were not available for comment on that report.
Tax-withholding plan delayed
Washington — Senate leaders, bowing to intense lobbying

from the nation's bankers, worked out a compromise yester
day that would delay for four years — and perhaps forever —
the effect of a controversial law requiring the withholding of
income taxes on interest and dividends.
The compromise was reached after a day of legislative ma
neuvering between Sen. Bob Kasten (R-Wis.) who has led a
stubborn fight against the provision enacted by Congress last
year, and the chief Senate supporters of withholding, Re
publicans Robert Dole of Kansas and Ted Stevens of Alaska.
President Reagan has repeatedly vowed to veto any repeal
of the withholding provision, and White House aides were
consulted in an effort to produce a face-saving formula. Nev
ertheless, a Treasury Department official who asked to re
main anonymous said late yesterday that Secretary of the
Treasury Donald Regan was opposed to the plan.
Committee nixes extra aid
Washington — In a sharp blow to President Rea
gan's policies in Latin America, the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee yesterday voted 19-16 against the ad
ministration's request for $50 million in additional
military aid to El Salvador.
Reagan had sought the funds as part of a $110 mil
lion emergency infusion to shore up the Salvadoran
government against leftist guerrillas. The other $60
million would be shifted from already appropriated
funds for Morocco and other countries, but has been
held up in a House Appropriations subcommittee.
James Michel, deputy assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, urged the committee to ap
prove the $50 million, saying rejection would be "very
harmful to our interests in democracy and human
rights."
Reagan endorses MX silo plan
Washington — President Reagan endorsed a plan
yesterday to put 100 MX intercontinental ballistic mis
siles in Minuteman missile silos in Nebraska and Wyo
ming, saying that the Soviet Union will have no incen
tive to negotiate nuclear arms reductions unless the
United States modernizes its land-based missile
forces.
Accepting all of the major recommendations of a
blue-ribbon commission, Reagan set the stage for his
administration's third effort to get Congress to ap
prove deployment of the 95-ton supermissile, which
is designed to carry 10 nuclear warheads more than
5000 miles.
Congress has 45 days to accept or reject the pro
posal, the fifth basing plan devised by strategic weap
ons experts since the missile itself was first proposed
by the Nixon administration.
Israel softens demands
Jerusalem — In an apparent softening of earlier de
mands for either Israeli-manned military outposts or
joint Israel-Lebanon combat patrols in southern Leb
anon, an Israeli official said yesterday that the Jerusa
lem government wants to assign "liaison officers" to
work with Lebanese army units.
The official, who talked to reporters following a
meeting of the Israeli Cabinet, said three main issues
remain unresolved in the drawn-out negotiations
among the United States, Israel and Lebanon on the
withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon
The official, who declined to be identified, listed
the issues as the future status of former Lebanese
armv Maj. Saad Haddad and his Israeli-trained militia,
the deployment ol United Nations forces in southern
Lebanon, and 'sraeli haiso."' officers to serve with the
Lebanese army.
China warns Vietnam
Peking — China warned Vietnam yesterday after
three days of serious border clashes that Chinese
troops will "fight back" if Hanoi continues its "armed
provocations" along its frontier.
In what it called a stern warning, the Chinese For
eign Ministry raised the possibility of a major punitive
attack by Chinese forces on Vietnam like that four
years ago after Vietnamese troops occupied Cam
bodia.
"The Vietnamese authorities must immediately
stop their armed provocations against China's border
areas," Qi Huaiyuan, the ministry spokesman, said,
"or China will reserve its right to fight back."

Gov't warns against protests
Warsaw — Poland's Communist authorities yester
day issued a high-level public warning to reject an un
derground call for May Day demonstrations as news
papers carried front-page announcements that "mili
tary operation groups" will be deployed throughout
the country for one week beginning today.
As political tensions mounted, former Solidarity
chairman Lech Walesa was questioned by police for
the second day running and the third time in a week.
Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told reporters
the military units "are to perform strictly peaceful
tasks, namely as before, to control the provincial
economy, which is quite often neglected." Such
groups appeared for the first time on Oct. 26,1981, to
be followed on Dec. 13 by declaration of martial law.
In a related development, authorities announced
the "temporary arrest" of former Solidarity national
spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewiczon chargesof partic
ipating in "underground structures" and preparing
for the May Day demonstrations.
Court axes early filing date
Washington — In a ruling clearing the way for inde
pendent candidates to run in the 1984 presidential
campaign, the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 yesterday
to strike down the early filing deadlines some states
have imposed on candidates who run without party
affiliation.
The court held that the March 20 filing deadline
that Ohio set for independent presidential candidates
violates the First Amendment. The justices acted in a
case that was originally filed during the 1980 cam
paign by John Anderson, the former Republican con
gressman who decided to run as an independent after
President Reagan had locked upthe Republican nom
ination.
The decision comes at a time when important con
stituencies within both major political parties have
been hinting that they might field their own presiden
tial candidates next year.

More bodies recovered at embassy
Beirut — Searchers recovered six more bodies from the
bomb-shattered U.S. Embassy yesterday and continued their
grim task, with at least 47 people believed killed in the worst
attack ever on a U.S. facility here.
There were 24 confirmed deaths and 23 other people were
missing and presumed dead.
Embassy spokesman John Reid said eight Americans were
confirmed dead and eight others were missing from the
massive explosion at lunchtime Monday. Among the con
firmed dead was Robert Clayton Ames, the ClA's Near East
and South Asian analyst, officials said in Washington in a rare
case of naming a CIA agent who worked abroad.
There was no clear picture of how the attack was carried
out, but most accounts said a terrorist drove an explosives

laden vehicle into the compound and perished in the blast.
Ten Lebanese embassy employees, visa applicants and vis
itors were confirmed dead, while 20 others were missing,
said Reid. The 47th victim listed was an embassy visitor of un
known nationality, he said.
The privately owned Central News Agency said the bomb
ing was an attempt to kill U.S. presidential envoy Philip
Habib and his assistant Morris Draper. It quoted unnamed
government officials as saying Habib and Draper had been
scheduled to be at the embassy when the bomb exploded at
1:05 p.m., but were delayed by talks with Lebanese leaders at
the presidential palace in suburban Baabda. U.S. Embassy of
ficials were not available for comment on that report.
Tax-withholding plan delayed
Washington — Senate leaders, bowing to intense lobbying

from the nation's bankers, worked out a compromise yester
day that would delay for four years — and perhaps forever —
the effect of a controversial law requiring the withholding of
income taxes on interest and dividends.
The compromise was reached after a day of legislative ma
neuvering between Sen. Bob Kasten (R-Wis.) who has led a
stubborn fight against the provision enacted by Congress last
year, and the chief Senate supporters of withholding, Re
publicans Robert Dole of Kansas and Ted Stevens of Alaska.
President Reagan has repeatedly vowed to veto any repeal
of the withholding provision, and White House aides were
consulted in an effort to produce a face-saving formula. Nev
ertheless, a Treasury Department official who asked to re
main anonymous said late yesterday that Secretary of the
Treasury Donald Regan was opposed to the plan.
Committee nixes extra aid
Washington — In a sharp blow to President Rea
gan's policies in Latin America, the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee yesterday voted 19-16 against the ad
ministration's request for $50 million in additional
military aid to El Salvador.
Reagan had sought the funds as part of a $110 mil
lion emergency infusion to shore up the Salvadoran
government against leftist guerrillas. The other $60
million would be shifted from already appropriated
funds for Morocco and other countries, but has been
held up in a House Appropriations subcommittee.
James Michel, deputy assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, urged the committee to ap
prove the $50 million, saying rejection would be "very
harmful to our interests in democracy and human
rights."
Reagan endorses MX silo plan
Washington — President Reagan endorsed a plan
yesterday to put 100 MX intercontinental ballistic mis
siles in Minuteman missile silos in Nebraska and Wyo
ming, saying that the Soviet Union will have no incen
tive to negotiate nuclear arms reductions unless the
United States modernizes its land-based missile
forces.
Accepting all of the major recommendations of a
blue-ribbon commission, Reagan set the stage for his
administration's third effort to get Congress to ap
prove deployment of the 95-ton supermissile, which
is designed to carry 10 nuclear warheads more than
5000 miles.
Congress has 45 days to accept or reject the pro
posal, the fifth basing plan devised by strategic weap
ons experts since the missile itself was first proposed
by the Nixon administration.
Israel softens demands
Jerusalem — In an apparent softening of earlier de
mands for either Israeli-manned military outposts or
joint Israel-Lebanon combat patrols in southern Leb
anon, an Israeli official said yesterday that the Jerusa
lem government wants to assign "liaison officers" to
work with Lebanese army units.
The official, who talked to reporters following a
meeting of the Israeli Cabinet, said three main issues
remain unresolved in the drawn-out negotiations
among the United States, Israel and Lebanon on the
withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon
The official, who declined to be identified, listed
the issues as the future status of former Lebanese
armv Maj. Saad Haddad and his Israeli-trained militia,
the deployment ol United Nations forces in southern
Lebanon, and 'sraeli haiso."' officers to serve with the
Lebanese army.
China warns Vietnam
Peking — China warned Vietnam yesterday after
three days of serious border clashes that Chinese
troops will "fight back" if Hanoi continues its "armed
provocations" along its frontier.
In what it called a stern warning, the Chinese For
eign Ministry raised the possibility of a major punitive
attack by Chinese forces on Vietnam like that four
years ago after Vietnamese troops occupied Cam
bodia.
"The Vietnamese authorities must immediately
stop their armed provocations against China's border
areas," Qi Huaiyuan, the ministry spokesman, said,
"or China will reserve its right to fight back."

Gov't warns against protests
Warsaw — Poland's Communist authorities yester
day issued a high-level public warning to reject an un

papers carried front-page announcements that "mili

the country for one week beginning today.
As political tensions mounted, former Solidarity
chairman Lech Walesa was questioned by police for
the second day running and the third time in a week.
Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told reporters
the military units "are to perform strictly peaceful
tasks, namely as before, to control the provincial
economy, which is quite often neglected." Such
groups appeared for the first time on Oct. 26,1981, to
be followed on Dec. 13 by declaration of martial law.
In a related development, authorities announced
the "temporary arrest" of former Solidarity national
spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewiczon chargesof partic
ipating in "underground structures" and preparing
for the May Day demonstrations.
Court axes early filing date
Washington — In a ruling clearing the way for inde
pendent candidates to run in the 1984 presidential
campaign, the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 yesterday
to strike down the early filing deadlines some states
have imposed on candidates who run without party
affiliation.
The court held that the March 20 filing deadline
that Ohio set for independent presidential candidates
violates the First Amendment. The justices acted in a
case that was originally filed during the 1980 cam
paign by John Anderson, the former Republican con
gressman who decided to run as an independent after
President Reagan had locked upthe Republican nom
ination.
The decision comes at a time when important con
stituencies within both major political parties have
been hinting that they might field their own presiden
