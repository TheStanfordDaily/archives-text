# Faculty circulate petition charging Hoover with bias
## 
### MICHAEL CALABRESE 
A petition to the Academic Council that protests
the current relationship between Stanford University
and the Hoover Institution is being circulated by te
nured professors in several departments and at the
schools of Law and Education. The petition claims
that "the existence of a partisan organization,
whether liberal or conservative, within the University
raises grave questions concerning the academic
independence, integrity and national reputation of
the University."
The petition seeks the 50 faculty signatures neces
sary to force a resolution onto the agenda of the
Senate of the Academic Council, the faculty de
liberating body. The resolution, if passed by the
Academic Senate, would "urge the board of trustees
to initiate an immediate and Independent Inquiry,
including a public report, on the relationship be
tween the Hoover Institution and Stanford Univer-

Political Science Prof. Charles Drekmeier said, "I
suspect they have 50 signatures by now." He signed
the petition but did not originate it, he said. Two
faculty members who initiated the petition, English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz and Political Science Prof. John
Manley said, they could not say for sure how many
signatures were collected, since senior faculty in sev
eral departments and at the professional schools
were operating independently.
George Marotta, public relations director for the
Hoover Institution, said yesterday that he thought the
professors in disagreement with the University's rela
tionship to Hoover were in the minority and that the
five-paragraph petition is "full of fallacies."
A law student who has helped organize the collec -
tion of more than 500 student signatures since Friday
on a similar petition estimated that 35 to 40 tenured
faculty have signed the Academic Council petition
He asked that his name not be used.
