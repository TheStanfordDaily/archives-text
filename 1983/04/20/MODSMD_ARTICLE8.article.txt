## ROTC students leave campus for military courses 
### 
By KFVIN CROSS
Each week, throe groups of Reserve
Officer Training Corps students leave
the Stanford campus to attend military
science courses at other Bay Area uni
versities. For most of these students,
the ROTC program provides a means of
meeting rising University tuition costs.
Other inherent benefits in the ROTC
program include instruction in leader
ship and management training skills.
Moreover, the guarantee of a job as an
officer in the armed forces after gradua
tion is also important in light of the cur
rent nationwide unemployment rate.
Thirty-nine students travel to San
lose State University to participate in
the Air Force ROTC program there. The
Naval ROTC program al UC-Berkeley
has attracted Ii students trom Stan
ford. In addition, six students are pur
suing commissions in the Army ROTC
program at the University of Santa
Clara, where more than a dozen
freshmen have also expressed interest
in the program.
Air Force
Many Air Force cadets mentioned
that participation in the ROTC program
creates special difficulties unique to
Stanford students. According to Denny
Irby, a sophomore majoring in electri
cal engineering, "It creates a lot of
problems for scheduling. For instance,
all of the core courses in electrical en
gineering meet on Tuesdays and
Thursdays, which c reates problems for
double-E majors, especially for juniors
and seniors."
To be certain, classes in non
engineering departments pose prob

lems as well. "I'm taking an Econ.
course every Fhursday,and I miss it due
to ROTC," Irby said. He attends a
course entitled "Development of Air
Power" in San lose, where "we learn
how the Air Force became important."
Sophomore Kerry Smith, another Air
Force cadet, wanted to change her
major out of engineering science. She
said she has not had as many problems
as most people because her classes
generally do not meet on Thursday. But
she has to miss calculus, which meets
every day. Many upper classmen are
missing ROTC due to class conflicts,
she said.
Most adament about the problem of
taking ROTC courses at San Jose State
was cadet William Hooke, a junior who
is majoring in mechanical engineering.
"It's an incredible inconvenience. I
have had to drop classes here to go to
ROTC. It eats up more time than one
thinks," Hooke said. It usually takes 45
minutes to drive to and park in San
lose, he said.
Navy
Navy ROTC" students here also com
plained about the distance to classes.
According to sophomore Tim Huson,
students who participate in the Naval
ROTC must be ready to leave for Ber
keley at 5:30 a.m. "It's kind of a hassle
as far as the way it's set up. We have to
go to Berkeley once a week to drill. . . .
it's a big time commitment," Huson
said.
The Navy tries to accommodate Stan
ford students by providing a van on
Thursday mornings to alleviate trans
portation problems. Lt. J.Ci. Dart, an

instructor for the Naval ROTC program
at Berkeley, said, "Missing class has not
been a problem so far. All of the stu
dents have been able to make the
Thursday morning sessions."
The Navy does not require students
to major in engineering fields, she said,
but technical skills are helpful for Navy
careers. "Certainly, there is a need for
the technical fields. But we have many
students that are liberal arts majors, in
political science, business and eco

nomics," Dart said. The only require
ment is thatall students take one year of
calculus and one year of physic s, in ad
dition to a few classes offered by the
military science department. These in
clude "Military and Society," "Military
History," "Naval Weapons Systems,"
"Navigation" and "Leadership Man
agement."
Army
These courses are similar to the ones
taken by the six Stanford students who
are pursuing commissions through the
Army ROTC program. On Monday
evenings, the cadets venture down to
the University of Santa Clara for
courses entitled Military Ethics and
Professionalism, and Intermediate
Leadership and Management. According
to Lt. Colonel Thomas Almoguela of the
Santa Clara detachment, the classes
cover everything from military law to
army correspondence and military
ethics.
The students are also required to at
tend "leadership laboratories" about
twice a quarter (on Saturdays) and are
able to participate in adventure training
programs which include cross-country
skiing, white-water river rafting, and
helicopter rides. Field trips to various
local army installations like Forci Ord in
Monterey are also part of the program.
Almoguela, who received a master's
degree in mechanical engineering here
in 1973, said he would like to see ROTC
return to campus. "If I had more stu
dents from Stanford then I could prob
ably send one of my instructors up to
teach there," he said. The combination
of the time, distance and the lack of

academic credit offered to students
here may discourage some from parti
cipating in ROTC.
Don Carlson, director of University
Relations, confirmed the University
policy on ROTC. "The University does
not offer any credit for these courses,"
he said.
Return to Stanford?
Will ROTC ever return to the Stan
ford Carlson suggested that
the faculty might reconsider the matter.
But he doubted that the University will
ever again offer academic credit for the
courses. Assoc. Registrar Bob
Houghton said he thinks the University
would provide space for ROTC (lasses
on campus, as they did several years
ago for Army ROTC classes.
Army cadet John Heidersheit, a
junior majoring in history and ec onom
ics, said he hopes ROTC returns to
Stanford, if only for convenience. Re
ferring to the extra time needed to go to
Santa Clara, he said, "It's certainly not a
problem for me. But some of the others
consider it to be more of a hassle."
"I don't see any real short-term pol
icy changes taking place, though, given
the views of the current administra
tion," he said.
"We would definitely like to see it set
up here next year," said Bill Shadle, a
junior majoring in industrial engineer
ing, "but I think the faculty opposition
is just too strong."
"Our first priority as a group is get
ting it here on campus," Irby said. "We
want it on campus first, and getting
credit for it is a long way down the
road."

Each week, throe groups of Reserve
Officer Training Corps students leave
the Stanford campus to attend military
science courses at other Bay Area uni
versities. For most of these students,
the ROTC program provides a means of
meeting rising University tuition costs.
Other inherent benefits in the ROTC
program include instruction in leader
ship and management training skills.
Moreover, the guarantee of a job as an
officer in the armed forces after gradua
tion is also important in light of the cur
rent nationwide unemployment rate.
Thirty-nine students travel to San
lose State University to participate in
the Air Force ROTC program there. The
Naval ROTC program al UC-Berkeley
has attracted Ii students trom Stan
ford. In addition, six students are pur
suing commissions in the Army ROTC
program at the University of Santa
Clara, where more than a dozen
freshmen have also expressed interest
in the program.
Air Force
Many Air Force cadets mentioned
that participation in the ROTC program
creates special difficulties unique to
Stanford students. According to Denny
Irby, a sophomore majoring in electri
cal engineering, "It creates a lot of
problems for scheduling. For instance,
all of the core courses in electrical en
gineering meet on Tuesdays and
Thursdays, which c reates problems for
double-E majors, especially for juniors
and seniors."
To be certain, classes in non
engineering departments pose prob

lems as well. "I'm taking an Econ.
course every Fhursday,and I miss it due
to ROTC," Irby said. He attends a
course entitled "Development of Air
Power" in San lose, where "we learn
how the Air Force became important."
Sophomore Kerry Smith, another Air
Force cadet, wanted to change her
major out of engineering science. She
said she has not had as many problems
as most people because her classes
generally do not meet on Thursday. But
she has to miss calculus, which meets
every day. Many upper classmen are
missing ROTC due to class conflicts,
she said.
Most adament about the problem of
taking ROTC courses at San Jose State
was cadet William Hooke, a junior who
is majoring in mechanical engineering.
"It's an incredible inconvenience. I
have had to drop classes here to go to
ROTC. It eats up more time than one
thinks," Hooke said. It usually takes 45
minutes to drive to and park in San
lose, he said.
Navy
Navy ROTC" students here also com
plained about the distance to classes.
According to sophomore Tim Huson,
students who participate in the Naval
ROTC must be ready to leave for Ber
keley at 5:30 a.m. "It's kind of a hassle
as far as the way it's set up. We have to
go to Berkeley once a week to drill. . . .
it's a big time commitment," Huson
said.
The Navy tries to accommodate Stan
ford students by providing a van on
Thursday mornings to alleviate trans
portation problems. Lt. J.Ci. Dart, an

instructor for the Naval ROTC program
at Berkeley, said, "Missing class has not
been a problem so far. All of the stu
dents have been able to make the
Thursday morning sessions."
The Navy does not require students
to major in engineering fields, she said,
but technical skills are helpful for Navy
careers. "Certainly, there is a need for
the technical fields. But we have many
students that are liberal arts majors, in
political science, business and eco

nomics," Dart said. The only require
ment is thatall students take one year of
calculus and one year of physic s, in ad
dition to a few classes offered by the
military science department. These in
clude "Military and Society," "Military
History," "Naval Weapons Systems,"
"Navigation" and "Leadership Man
agement."
Army
These courses are similar to the ones
taken by the six Stanford students who
are pursuing commissions through the
Army ROTC program. On Monday
evenings, the cadets venture down to
the University of Santa Clara for
courses entitled Military Ethics and
Professionalism, and Intermediate
Leadership and Management. According
to Lt. Colonel Thomas Almoguela of the
Santa Clara detachment, the classes
cover everything from military law to
army correspondence and military
ethics.
The students are also required to at
tend "leadership laboratories" about
twice a quarter (on Saturdays) and are
able to participate in adventure training
programs which include cross-country
skiing, white-water river rafting, and
helicopter rides. Field trips to various
local army installations like Forci Ord in
Monterey are also part of the program.
Almoguela, who received a master's
degree in mechanical engineering here
in 1973, said he would like to see ROTC
return to campus. "If I had more stu
dents from Stanford then I could prob
ably send one of my instructors up to
teach there," he said. The combination
of the time, distance and the lack of

academic credit offered to students
here may discourage some from parti
cipating in ROTC.
Don Carlson, director of University
Relations, confirmed the University
policy on ROTC. "The University does
not offer any credit for these courses,"
he said.
Return to Stanford?
Will ROTC ever return to the Stan
ford Carlson suggested that
the faculty might reconsider the matter.
But he doubted that the University will
ever again offer academic credit for the
courses. Assoc. Registrar Bob
Houghton said he thinks the University
would provide space for ROTC (lasses
on campus, as they did several years
ago for Army ROTC classes.
Army cadet John Heidersheit, a
junior majoring in history and ec onom
ics, said he hopes ROTC returns to
Stanford, if only for convenience. Re
ferring to the extra time needed to go to
Santa Clara, he said, "It's certainly not a
problem for me. But some of the others
consider it to be more of a hassle."
"I don't see any real short-term pol
icy changes taking place, though, given
the views of the current administra
tion," he said.
"We would definitely like to see it set
up here next year," said Bill Shadle, a
junior majoring in industrial engineer
ing, "but I think the faculty opposition
is just too strong."
