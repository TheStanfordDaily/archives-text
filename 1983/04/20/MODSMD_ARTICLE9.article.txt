Events have turned nasty in Nicaragua. Not
only have the rebel forces fighting the leftist
Sandinist government caused further social up
heaval in a nation that has had enough of it, but
accusations of covert U.S. aid to the rebels have
incited hostile international and domestic at
tacks on U.S. policy toward Central America. Of
course, such verbal abuse is not the real prob
lem. Nastier still is the growing realization that
the Reagan administration's current policy of
backing the insurgents is misguided diplomacy.
The administration has portrayed the fighting
in Nicaragua as an internal affair, claiming that
the conflict involves different factions of the
coalition that seized power from Anastasio
Somoza Debayle in 1979. The president also said
in a news conference last week that many
people are "ignoring some realities" of the
Nicaraguan situation. President Reagan cor
rectly pointed out that the Sandinists took
power with the promise of democratic elections
and non-intervention in the affairs of other
Central American governments. Neither prom
ise has been upheld.
But other facts suggest Reagan is vulnerable
to his own criticism, that of ignoring realities.
The Nicaraguan conflict is not purely inter
coalitional. Members of Somoza's despised Na
tional Guard lead some of the exile forces while
there have been reports of recruited surrogates
from Honduras and Costa Rica among the rebel
forces.
Further, a recent history of unsuccessful U.S.
intervention on behalf of unpopular right wing
forces should illustrate the difficulties inherent
in such an attempt. Military confrontation by
the United States may breed stronger resistance
and, worse still, give the Sandinists, who have
yet to demonstrate that they can run their coun
try, a pretext for mobilizing popular support
while continuing repressive tactics.
According to a document released by
Reagan's National Security Planning Group, the
administration fears the proliferation of Cuba
model states which would "provide platforms
for subversion, compromise vital sea lanes and
pose a direct military threat at or near our bor

ders." Cuba and the Soviet Union, the president
reminds us, have already hailed Nicaragua as
the first communist country on the mainland of
the Western Hemisphere.
However, Nicaragua is not Cuba. The San
dinist government is plagued not only by a gen
eral lack of experience in government but also
by unstable and shifting factions within the co
alition that are vying for state power. Nicaragua
is also dramatically underdeveloped, with much
of the economy controlled by the private sector.
The Reagan administration has not yet demon
strated a sensitivity to these differences which
reflect the complex nature of Central American
countries.
Some have argued that any resolution of the
conflict must involve a regional approach. A
report issued in Washington last week by a
group of opinion leaders headed by Sol
Linowitz, former U.S. Ambassador to the Or
ganization of American States, stresses that any
resolution of the Central American conflict de
pends on economic and social development
and political dialogue within the region. Hon
duras, Guatemala and Great Britain among
others have taken a first step by urging a meet
ing of Central American countries to discuss the
flow of arms from Nicaragua to leftist guerrillas.
U.S. support, whether overt or covert, for the
anti-government rebels in Nicaragua obscures
the real crimes of the Sandinist regime. The
current government continues to give eco
nomic and military aid to guerrillas in El Salvador
while its own country faces severe economic
problems, it has reneged on its promise to hold
elections and it has forced the relocation of
some 14,500 Miskito Indians. Such a record
would suggest that the current government is
capable of inflicting its own demise.
The philosphy and actions of the Nicaraguan
government may be inimical to U.S. interests,
but the focus of world attention should be on
the inadequacies of the Sandinist government
and not on U.S. involvement. By encouraging
political dialogue the United States and other
Central American countries can work toward a
more important long-term goal — regional sta
bility.
