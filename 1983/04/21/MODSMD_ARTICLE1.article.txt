## Hoover threatens academic freedom 
### KIMBERLY BROWN MICHAEL CALABRESE (Last in a three-part series 
A group of faculty seeking an im
mediate inquiry by the University
board of trustees into the relation
ship between the University and the
Hoover Institution charge Hoover
with possible violations of academic
freedom stemming from the injec
tion of political criteria into hiring
and undue influence on the social
science faculties.
The faculty petition, aimed at plac
ing a resolution on the Academic
Senate agenda, urges the board of
trustees to investigate Hoover's al
leged partisanship. The petition
claims that "the existence of a parti
san organization, whether liberal or
conservative, within the University
raises grave questions concerning
academic independence" and Stan
ford's national reputation.
Among the "grave questions"
raised by Hoover's alleged conserva
tive bias, combined with its close ties
to the University, is whether a "two
class protessoriat" is being created
with long-run implications for the
independence of several social sci
ence depatments, Political Science
Prof. )ohn Manley said last week. .
Manley, who helped draft the peti
tion, said there has been a progres
sive "blurring' of the distinction be
tween Hoover and the University.
This inappropriate, he said, so long
as Hoover retains its "inner core" of
conservative policy advocates whose
appointments are not subject to fac
ulty review or even the veto of the

president of the University.
"However correct any individual
relationship with Hoover," Manley
said, referring to members of his de
partment with joint or courtesy ap
pointments at Hoover, "at some
point must we not ask questions
about where the Hoover Institution
begins and the University ends?"
Manley and Ronald Rebholz, pro
fessor of English and co-sponsor of
the petition, are among a group of
faculty who describe Hoover as a
"two-tiered" organization: a "con
servative inner core" of policy advo
cates who comprise Hoover's re
search fellows, but who are not sub
ject to the University academic hiring
process; and an "outer ring" of
senior fellows, mostly Stanford pro
fessors or courtesy appointments
who "add to Hoover's prestige."
University President Donald Ken
nedy said he did not perceive a
"two-tiered" Hoover. "I can imagine
some good arguments about too
many faculty members having ap
pointments. However, I would not
fear the problem of any political or
thodoxy," Kennedy said in an inter
view last week.
American Association of Univer
sities President Robert Rosenzweig,
who resigned earlier this year as Uni
versity vice-presidcnt for public af
fairs, said yesterday that he "does
not understand what all the fuss is
about." Rosenzweig served as the
University president's liaison to
Hoover for more than a decade,
handling the reporting of Hoover
senior fellow appointments to the

board of trustees.
"Not only don't I see anything
wrong" with more interconnection
between Hoover and the faculty de
partments, Rosenzweig said, "I think
it's a genuinely healthy develop
ment.
"The way in the long run to make
Hoover the academic and intellec
tual place it should be is to have
more, not fewer, joint appoint
ments," including the appointment
of Hoover research fellows to the
Stanford faculty if they are qualified,
he said.
Rosenzweig said suggestions that
Hoover had demanded "reciprocity"
from the Political Science Depart
ment in return for giving a number of
its faculty joint or courtesy appoint
ments did not bother him. "That is
the sort of give and take that goes on
in a University all the time," he said.
Hoover critics base much of their

argument concerning the negative
effects of growing ties with Hoover
on the contention that Hoover pro
motes a political cause as a result of
its domination by an "inner core" of
conservative, policy-oriented re
search staff.
Alexander Dallin, a professor of
history who spent seven years on
joint appointment at Hoover as a
senior fellow, said last week that
"when it comes to decisions about
hiring and firing and about what re
search commitment to take on,"
there is a "conservative inner
sanctum who control Hoover."
Although some faculty and ad
ministrators believe the way to bring
Hoover under control is to "get a
foot in the door by placing tenured
faculty over there" as joint appoint
ments, that "won't work," he said.
"You won't change the inner
sanctum at Hoover even if you get 50
joint appointments over there," Dal
lin added.
"What I find disturbing is that
Hoover applies a political litmus test
to its appointments, except for the
courtesy appointments of regular
Stanford faculty which it does to buv
academic respectability," Henry Le
vin, professor of education, said in
an interview last week. He declined
to sign the Academic Council peti
tion.
"If they appointed people on the
basis of merit, you would never see
such a clustering of people on the
right politically," Dallin said.
"The injection of political criteria
in academic hiring" and in the alloca
tion of research funds constitutes an
abuse which Stanford sanctions
through its close relationship with
Hoover, Dallin added.
George Marotta, Hoover's public
relations director, fervently denies
that political criteria influence hiring
decisions at Hoover.
lohn Moore, the associate director
of the Hoover Institution who coor
dinates the appointment of new re
search fellows, said Tuesday that
Hoover discriminates less in its hir
ing than the University. "Our range
of views is better-balanced than the
rest of the University because at least
we have a few conservatives and you
can't find any out there (on the social
science faculty)," Moore said.
"Our policy is to hire the best pos
sible staff we can get our hands on,"
Moore said.
The Hoover Institution is not
bound by the University's State on
Academic Freedom which prohibits
political discrimination in the hiring
of faculty and the support of schol
arly research, Noel Kolak, assistant
provost who manages the faculty ap
pointments process, said Tuesday.
The Statement of Academic Free
dom, adopted by the senate of the
academic council and binding on all
University departments except
Hoover, states that "Decisions con
cerning the search tor and the ap
pointment and promotion of faculty
. . . or the support and sponsorship
of scholarly research . . . shall be
made without regard 'o a person's
political, social or other views not di

rectly related to academic values or
the assumption of academic respon
sibilities."
The Statement of Academic Free
dom does not technically apply to
Hoover fellows unless they are
members of the Stanford faculty be
cause Hoover research fellows are
not members of the academic coun
cil and thus are not subject to its dis
cipline, according to a footnote in
the statement detining "faculty,'
Kolak said.
Rosenzweig said, "As far as the
past two presidents of Stanford are
concerned, the Statement of
Academic Freedom applies to
Hoover." He conceded, however,
that the president ot the University
simply does not have the authority to
approve or disapprove the appoint
ment of Hoover research fellows, ex
cept for senior fellows. All research
fellows are on term appointments,
usually five years, while senior fel
lows, though not tenured, have a
continuing appointment.
Rosenzweig said that no senior fel
low proposed to the president for
appointment or for joint appoint
ment has been rejected since 1971,
although several times President
Richard Lyman requested further in
formation.
"If the concern is that the Hoover
Institution has a political test for its
appointments, the solution is not to
apply an equal and opposite test to
Floover," Rosenzweig said. He
criticized any move to limit the usual
case-by-case consideration of
Hoover fellows for appointment to
the University faculty.
"The test should be intellectual
quality, which is the only acceptable
basis for hiring decisions at a Univer
sity," Rosenzweig added.
Manley's argument, criticized by
several members of the political sci
ence department, stresses the need
to consider the "collective impact"
of many appointments on the de
partment's independence and bal
ance.
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said in a letter to department
members that no matter how many
Hoover fellows are recommended
for affiliation or to teach in the de
partment, each one shouM receive
case-bv-ca«-e consideration based
only on academic qualifications.
Brody refused to provide a copy of
'hf» letter to the Daily.
The dispute over Hoover «, alleged
influence on University academic

departments has focused on the
political science department, where
halt of the tenured faculty have, have
had or have applied for a joint or
courtesy appointment fat Hoover.
Such appointments bring faculty var
ying combinations of benefits, such
as extra salary, reduced teaching
loads, otfice space and a secretary at
Hoover, free computer time and in
many cases a budget for research as
sistants, who also get office space at
Hoover. Such appointments do not
entail any additional obligations to
Hoover.
Manley's memo to the Political
Science Department originated fol
lowing a political science depart
ment meeting debate over the pro
posed appointment of Hoover
Senior Fellow Gerald Dorfman to
teach a course next fall in British poli
tics. Dorfman's appointment was
overwhelmingly approved by a vote
of 22 to 1, with one abstention.
What spurred opposition by Man
ley and concern by two other de
partment members who asked not to
be named was that four Hoover fel
lows had been pioposed for political
science appointments this school
year. Besides Dorfman, Hoover Na
tional Fellow John Ferejohn received
a University professorship.
Another Hoover fellow, who said
he would remain at Hoover only if
they could ensure him a spot on the
University faculty, was rejected after
two professors not affiliated with
Hoover opposed the appointment,
according to a professor who would
speak only on the condition that he
and the Hoover fellow not be named.
And recently, according to Hoover
spokesman Marotta, Heinz Fulau, a
Hoover senior fellow and chairman
of the Political Science Department,
wrote a letter inviting Alvin
Rabushka, a Hoover senior research
fellow, to accept a courtesy ap
pointment with the department. Al
though Eulau has not yet formally
proposed the appointment at a de
partment meeting, several faculty
and another Hoover fellow doubted
Rabushka would be deemed qual
ified.
Rabushka is best known for his re
cent advocacy of a flat-rate
income tax which has been endorsed
in principle, but rot yet proposed, by
President Reagan. Fie was proposed
for an appointment in political sci
fii( p several yea. <igo and rejected.
Eulau declined to comment.

Rabushka is best known for his re

A group of faculty seeking an im
mediate inquiry by the University
board of trustees into the relation
ship between the University and the
Hoover Institution charge Hoover
with possible violations of academic
freedom stemming from the injec
tion of political criteria into hiring
and undue influence on the social
science faculties.
The faculty petition, aimed at plac
ing a resolution on the Academic
Senate agenda, urges the board of
trustees to investigate Hoover's al
leged partisanship. The petition
claims that "the existence of a parti
san organization, whether liberal or
conservative, within the University
raises grave questions concerning
academic independence" and Stan
ford's national reputation.
Among the "grave questions"
raised by Hoover's alleged conserva
tive bias, combined with its close ties
to the University, is whether a "two
class protessoriat" is being created
with long-run implications for the
independence of several social sci
ence depatments, Political Science
Prof. )ohn Manley said last week. .
Manley, who helped draft the peti
tion, said there has been a progres
sive "blurring' of the distinction be
tween Hoover and the University.
This inappropriate, he said, so long
as Hoover retains its "inner core" of
conservative policy advocates whose
appointments are not subject to fac
ulty review or even the veto of the

president of the University.
"However correct any individual
relationship with Hoover," Manley
said, referring to members of his de
partment with joint or courtesy ap
pointments at Hoover, "at some
point must we not ask questions
about where the Hoover Institution
begins and the University ends?"
Manley and Ronald Rebholz, pro
fessor of English and co-sponsor of
the petition, are among a group of
faculty who describe Hoover as a
"two-tiered" organization: a "con
servative inner core" of policy advo
cates who comprise Hoover's re
search fellows, but who are not sub
ject to the University academic hiring
process; and an "outer ring" of
senior fellows, mostly Stanford pro
fessors or courtesy appointments
who "add to Hoover's prestige."
University President Donald Ken
nedy said he did not perceive a
"two-tiered" Hoover. "I can imagine
some good arguments about too
many faculty members having ap
pointments. However, I would not
fear the problem of any political or
thodoxy," Kennedy said in an inter
view last week.
American Association of Univer
sities President Robert Rosenzweig,
who resigned earlier this year as Uni
versity vice-presidcnt for public af
fairs, said yesterday that he "does
not understand what all the fuss is
about." Rosenzweig served as the
University president's liaison to
Hoover for more than a decade,
handling the reporting of Hoover
senior fellow appointments to the

board of trustees.
"Not only don't I see anything
wrong" with more interconnection
between Hoover and the faculty de
partments, Rosenzweig said, "I think
it's a genuinely healthy develop
ment.
"The way in the long run to make
Hoover the academic and intellec
tual place it should be is to have
more, not fewer, joint appoint
ments," including the appointment
of Hoover research fellows to the
Stanford faculty if they are qualified,
he said.
Rosenzweig said suggestions that
Hoover had demanded "reciprocity"
from the Political Science Depart
ment in return for giving a number of
its faculty joint or courtesy appoint
ments did not bother him. "That is
the sort of give and take that goes on
in a University all the time," he said.
Hoover critics base much of their

argument concerning the negative
effects of growing ties with Hoover
on the contention that Hoover pro
motes a political cause as a result of
its domination by an "inner core" of
conservative, policy-oriented re
search staff.
Alexander Dallin, a professor of
history who spent seven years on
joint appointment at Hoover as a
senior fellow, said last week that
"when it comes to decisions about
hiring and firing and about what re
search commitment to take on,"
there is a "conservative inner
sanctum who control Hoover."
Although some faculty and ad
ministrators believe the way to bring
Hoover under control is to "get a
foot in the door by placing tenured
faculty over there" as joint appoint
ments, that "won't work," he said.
"You won't change the inner
sanctum at Hoover even if you get 50
joint appointments over there," Dal
lin added.
"What I find disturbing is that
Hoover applies a political litmus test
to its appointments, except for the
courtesy appointments of regular
Stanford faculty which it does to buv
academic respectability," Henry Le
vin, professor of education, said in
an interview last week. He declined
to sign the Academic Council peti
tion.
"If they appointed people on the
basis of merit, you would never see
such a clustering of people on the
right politically," Dallin said.
"The injection of political criteria
in academic hiring" and in the alloca
tion of research funds constitutes an
abuse which Stanford sanctions
through its close relationship with
Hoover, Dallin added.
George Marotta, Hoover's public
relations director, fervently denies
that political criteria influence hiring
decisions at Hoover.
lohn Moore, the associate director
of the Hoover Institution who coor
dinates the appointment of new re
search fellows, said Tuesday that
Hoover discriminates less in its hir
ing than the University. "Our range
of views is better-balanced than the
rest of the University because at least
we have a few conservatives and you
can't find any out there (on the social
science faculty)," Moore said.
"Our policy is to hire the best pos
sible staff we can get our hands on,"
Moore said.
The Hoover Institution is not
bound by the University's State on
Academic Freedom which prohibits
political discrimination in the hiring
of faculty and the support of schol
arly research, Noel Kolak, assistant
provost who manages the faculty ap
pointments process, said Tuesday.
The Statement of Academic Free
dom, adopted by the senate of the
academic council and binding on all
University departments except
Hoover, states that "Decisions con
cerning the search tor and the ap
pointment and promotion of faculty
. . . or the support and sponsorship
of scholarly research . . . shall be
made without regard 'o a person's
political, social or other views not di

rectly related to academic values or
the assumption of academic respon
sibilities."
The Statement of Academic Free
dom does not technically apply to
Hoover fellows unless they are
members of the Stanford faculty be
cause Hoover research fellows are
not members of the academic coun
cil and thus are not subject to its dis
cipline, according to a footnote in
the statement detining "faculty,'
Kolak said.
Rosenzweig said, "As far as the
past two presidents of Stanford are
concerned, the Statement of
Academic Freedom applies to
Hoover." He conceded, however,
that the president ot the University
simply does not have the authority to
approve or disapprove the appoint
ment of Hoover research fellows, ex
cept for senior fellows. All research
fellows are on term appointments,
usually five years, while senior fel
lows, though not tenured, have a
continuing appointment.
Rosenzweig said that no senior fel
low proposed to the president for
appointment or for joint appoint
ment has been rejected since 1971,
although several times President
Richard Lyman requested further in
formation.
"If the concern is that the Hoover
Institution has a political test for its
appointments, the solution is not to
apply an equal and opposite test to
Floover," Rosenzweig said. He
criticized any move to limit the usual
case-by-case consideration of
Hoover fellows for appointment to
the University faculty.
"The test should be intellectual
quality, which is the only acceptable
basis for hiring decisions at a Univer
sity," Rosenzweig added.
Manley's argument, criticized by
several members of the political sci
ence department, stresses the need
to consider the "collective impact"
of many appointments on the de
partment's independence and bal
ance.
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said in a letter to department
members that no matter how many
Hoover fellows are recommended
for affiliation or to teach in the de
partment, each one shouM receive
case-bv-ca«-e consideration based
only on academic qualifications.
Brody refused to provide a copy of
'hf» letter to the Daily.
The dispute over Hoover «, alleged
influence on University academic

departments has focused on the
political science department, where
halt of the tenured faculty have, have
had or have applied for a joint or
courtesy appointment fat Hoover.
Such appointments bring faculty var
ying combinations of benefits, such
as extra salary, reduced teaching
loads, otfice space and a secretary at
Hoover, free computer time and in
many cases a budget for research as
sistants, who also get office space at
Hoover. Such appointments do not
entail any additional obligations to
Hoover.
Manley's memo to the Political
Science Department originated fol
lowing a political science depart
ment meeting debate over the pro
posed appointment of Hoover
Senior Fellow Gerald Dorfman to
teach a course next fall in British poli
tics. Dorfman's appointment was
overwhelmingly approved by a vote
of 22 to 1, with one abstention.
What spurred opposition by Man
ley and concern by two other de
partment members who asked not to
be named was that four Hoover fel
lows had been pioposed for political
science appointments this school
year. Besides Dorfman, Hoover Na
tional Fellow John Ferejohn received
a University professorship.
Another Hoover fellow, who said
he would remain at Hoover only if
they could ensure him a spot on the
University faculty, was rejected after
two professors not affiliated with
Hoover opposed the appointment,
according to a professor who would
speak only on the condition that he
and the Hoover fellow not be named.
And recently, according to Hoover
spokesman Marotta, Heinz Fulau, a
Hoover senior fellow and chairman
of the Political Science Department,
wrote a letter inviting Alvin
Rabushka, a Hoover senior research
fellow, to accept a courtesy ap
pointment with the department. Al
though Eulau has not yet formally
proposed the appointment at a de
partment meeting, several faculty
and another Hoover fellow doubted
Rabushka would be deemed qual
ified.
Rabushka is best known for his re
cent advocacy of a flat-rate
income tax which has been endorsed
in principle, but rot yet proposed, by
President Reagan. Fie was proposed

pointment with the department. Al
though Eulau has not yet formally
proposed the appointment at a de
partment meeting, several faculty
and another Hoover fellow doubted
Rabushka would be deemed qual
ified.
Rabushka is best known for his re
cent advocacy of a flat-rate
income tax which has been endorsed
in principle, but rot yet proposed, by
President Reagan. Fie was proposed
for an appointment in political sci
fii( p several yea. <igo and rejected.
Eulau declined to comment.
A group of faculty seeking an im
mediate inquiry by the University
board of trustees into the relation
ship between the University and the
Hoover Institution charge Hoover
with possible violations of academic
freedom stemming from the injec
tion of political criteria into hiring
and undue influence on the social
science faculties.
The faculty petition, aimed at plac
ing a resolution on the Academic
Senate agenda, urges the board of
trustees to investigate Hoover's al
leged partisanship. The petition
claims that "the existence of a parti
san organization, whether liberal or
conservative, within the University
raises grave questions concerning
academic independence" and Stan
ford's national reputation.
Among the "grave questions"
raised by Hoover's alleged conserva
tive bias, combined with its close ties
to the University, is whether a "two
class protessoriat" is being created
with long-run implications for the
independence of several social sci
ence depatments, Political Science
Prof. )ohn Manley said last week. .
Manley, who helped draft the peti
tion, said there has been a progres
sive "blurring' of the distinction be
tween Hoover and the University.
This inappropriate, he said, so long
as Hoover retains its "inner core" of
conservative policy advocates whose
appointments are not subject to fac
ulty review or even the veto of the

president of the University.
"However correct any individual
relationship with Hoover," Manley
said, referring to members of his de
partment with joint or courtesy ap
pointments at Hoover, "at some
point must we not ask questions
about where the Hoover Institution
begins and the University ends?"
Manley and Ronald Rebholz, pro
fessor of English and co-sponsor of
the petition, are among a group of
faculty who describe Hoover as a
"two-tiered" organization: a "con
servative inner core" of policy advo
cates who comprise Hoover's re
search fellows, but who are not sub
ject to the University academic hiring
process; and an "outer ring" of
senior fellows, mostly Stanford pro
fessors or courtesy appointments
who "add to Hoover's prestige."
University President Donald Ken
nedy said he did not perceive a
"two-tiered" Hoover. "I can imagine
some good arguments about too
many faculty members having ap
pointments. However, I would not
fear the problem of any political or
thodoxy," Kennedy said in an inter
view last week.
American Association of Univer
sities President Robert Rosenzweig,
who resigned earlier this year as Uni
versity vice-presidcnt for public af
fairs, said yesterday that he "does
not understand what all the fuss is
about." Rosenzweig served as the
University president's liaison to
Hoover for more than a decade,
handling the reporting of Hoover
senior fellow appointments to the

board of trustees.
"Not only don't I see anything
wrong" with more interconnection
between Hoover and the faculty de
partments, Rosenzweig said, "I think
it's a genuinely healthy develop
ment.
"The way in the long run to make
Hoover the academic and intellec
tual place it should be is to have
more, not fewer, joint appoint
ments," including the appointment
of Hoover research fellows to the
Stanford faculty if they are qualified,
he said.
Rosenzweig said suggestions that
Hoover had demanded "reciprocity"
from the Political Science Depart
ment in return for giving a number of
its faculty joint or courtesy appoint
ments did not bother him. "That is
the sort of give and take that goes on
in a University all the time," he said.
Hoover critics base much of their

argument concerning the negative
effects of growing ties with Hoover
on the contention that Hoover pro
motes a political cause as a result of
its domination by an "inner core" of
conservative, policy-oriented re
search staff.
Alexander Dallin, a professor of
history who spent seven years on
joint appointment at Hoover as a
senior fellow, said last week that
"when it comes to decisions about
hiring and firing and about what re
search commitment to take on,"
there is a "conservative inner
sanctum who control Hoover."
Although some faculty and ad
ministrators believe the way to bring
Hoover under control is to "get a
foot in the door by placing tenured
faculty over there" as joint appoint
ments, that "won't work," he said.
"You won't change the inner
sanctum at Hoover even if you get 50
joint appointments over there," Dal
lin added.
"What I find disturbing is that
Hoover applies a political litmus test
to its appointments, except for the
courtesy appointments of regular
Stanford faculty which it does to buv
academic respectability," Henry Le
vin, professor of education, said in
an interview last week. He declined
to sign the Academic Council peti
tion.
"If they appointed people on the
basis of merit, you would never see
such a clustering of people on the
right politically," Dallin said.
"The injection of political criteria
in academic hiring" and in the alloca
tion of research funds constitutes an
abuse which Stanford sanctions
through its close relationship with
Hoover, Dallin added.
George Marotta, Hoover's public
relations director, fervently denies
that political criteria influence hiring
decisions at Hoover.
lohn Moore, the associate director
of the Hoover Institution who coor
dinates the appointment of new re
search fellows, said Tuesday that
Hoover discriminates less in its hir
ing than the University. "Our range
of views is better-balanced than the
rest of the University because at least
we have a few conservatives and you
can't find any out there (on the social
science faculty)," Moore said.
"Our policy is to hire the best pos
sible staff we can get our hands on,"
Moore said.
The Hoover Institution is not
bound by the University's State on
Academic Freedom which prohibits
political discrimination in the hiring
of faculty and the support of schol
arly research, Noel Kolak, assistant
provost who manages the faculty ap
pointments process, said Tuesday.
The Statement of Academic Free
dom, adopted by the senate of the
academic council and binding on all
University departments except
Hoover, states that "Decisions con
cerning the search tor and the ap
pointment and promotion of faculty
. . . or the support and sponsorship
of scholarly research . . . shall be
made without regard 'o a person's
political, social or other views not di

rectly related to academic values or
the assumption of academic respon
sibilities."
The Statement of Academic Free
dom does not technically apply to
Hoover fellows unless they are
members of the Stanford faculty be
cause Hoover research fellows are
not members of the academic coun
cil and thus are not subject to its dis
cipline, according to a footnote in
the statement detining "faculty,'
Kolak said.
Rosenzweig said, "As far as the
past two presidents of Stanford are
concerned, the Statement of
Academic Freedom applies to
Hoover." He conceded, however,
that the president ot the University
simply does not have the authority to
approve or disapprove the appoint
ment of Hoover research fellows, ex
cept for senior fellows. All research
fellows are on term appointments,
usually five years, while senior fel
lows, though not tenured, have a
continuing appointment.
Rosenzweig said that no senior fel
low proposed to the president for
appointment or for joint appoint
ment has been rejected since 1971,
although several times President
Richard Lyman requested further in
formation.
"If the concern is that the Hoover
Institution has a political test for its
appointments, the solution is not to
apply an equal and opposite test to
Floover," Rosenzweig said. He
criticized any move to limit the usual
case-by-case consideration of
Hoover fellows for appointment to
the University faculty.
"The test should be intellectual
quality, which is the only acceptable
basis for hiring decisions at a Univer
sity," Rosenzweig added.
Manley's argument, criticized by
several members of the political sci
ence department, stresses the need
to consider the "collective impact"
of many appointments on the de
partment's independence and bal
ance.
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said in a letter to department
members that no matter how many
Hoover fellows are recommended
for affiliation or to teach in the de
partment, each one shouM receive
case-bv-ca«-e consideration based
only on academic qualifications.
Brody refused to provide a copy of
'hf» letter to the Daily.
The dispute over Hoover «, alleged
influence on University academic

departments has focused on the
political science department, where
halt of the tenured faculty have, have
had or have applied for a joint or
courtesy appointment fat Hoover.
Such appointments bring faculty var
ying combinations of benefits, such
as extra salary, reduced teaching
loads, otfice space and a secretary at
Hoover, free computer time and in
many cases a budget for research as
sistants, who also get office space at
Hoover. Such appointments do not
entail any additional obligations to
Hoover.
Manley's memo to the Political
Science Department originated fol
lowing a political science depart
ment meeting debate over the pro
posed appointment of Hoover
Senior Fellow Gerald Dorfman to
teach a course next fall in British poli
tics. Dorfman's appointment was
overwhelmingly approved by a vote
of 22 to 1, with one abstention.
What spurred opposition by Man
ley and concern by two other de
partment members who asked not to
be named was that four Hoover fel
lows had been pioposed for political
science appointments this school
year. Besides Dorfman, Hoover Na
tional Fellow John Ferejohn received
a University professorship.
Another Hoover fellow, who said
he would remain at Hoover only if
they could ensure him a spot on the
University faculty, was rejected after
two professors not affiliated with
Hoover opposed the appointment,
according to a professor who would
speak only on the condition that he
and the Hoover fellow not be named.
And recently, according to Hoover
spokesman Marotta, Heinz Fulau, a
Hoover senior fellow and chairman
of the Political Science Department,
wrote a letter inviting Alvin
Rabushka, a Hoover senior research
fellow, to accept a courtesy ap
pointment with the department. Al
though Eulau has not yet formally
proposed the appointment at a de
partment meeting, several faculty
and another Hoover fellow doubted
Rabushka would be deemed qual
