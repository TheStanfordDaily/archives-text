## Hoover threatens academic freedom 
### KIMBERLY BROWN MICHAEL CALABRESE (Last in a three-part series 
A group of faculty seeking an im
mediate inquiry by the University
board of trustees into the relation
ship between the University and the
Hoover Institution charge Hoover
with possible violations of academic
freedom stemming from the injec
tion of political criteria into hiring
and undue influence on the social
science faculties.
The faculty petition, aimed at plac
ing a resolution on the Academic
Senate agenda, urges the board of
trustees to investigate Hoover's al
leged partisanship. The petition
claims that "the existence of a parti
san organization, whether liberal or
conservative, within the University
raises grave questions concerning
academic independence" and Stan
ford's national reputation.
Among the "grave questions"
raised by Hoover's alleged conserva
tive bias, combined with its close ties
to the University, is whether a "two
class protessoriat" is being created
with long-run implications for the
independence of several social sci
ence depatments, Political Science
Prof. )ohn Manley said last week. .
Manley, who helped draft the peti
tion, said there has been a progres
sive "blurring' of the distinction be
tween Hoover and the University.
This inappropriate, he said, so long
as Hoover retains its "inner core" of
conservative policy advocates whose
appointments are not subject to fac
ulty review or even the veto of the

president of the University.
"However correct any individual
relationship with Hoover," Manley
said, referring to members of his de
partment with joint or courtesy ap
pointments at Hoover, "at some
point must we not ask questions
about where the Hoover Institution
begins and the University ends?"
Manley and Ronald Rebholz, pro
fessor of English and co-sponsor of
the petition, are among a group of
faculty who describe Hoover as a
"two-tiered" organization: a "con
servative inner core" of policy advo
cates who comprise Hoover's re
search fellows, but who are not sub
ject to the University academic hiring
process; and an "outer ring" of
senior fellows, mostly Stanford pro
fessors or courtesy appointments
who "add to Hoover's prestige."
University President Donald Ken
nedy said he did not perceive a
"two-tiered" Hoover. "I can imagine
some good arguments about too
many faculty members having ap
pointments. However, I would not
fear the problem of any political or
thodoxy," Kennedy said in an inter
view last week.
American Association of Univer
sities President Robert Rosenzweig,
who resigned earlier this year as Uni
versity vice-presidcnt for public af
fairs, said yesterday that he "does
not understand what all the fuss is
about." Rosenzweig served as the
University president's liaison to
Hoover for more than a decade,
handling the reporting of Hoover
senior fellow appointments to the

board of trustees.
"Not only don't I see anything
wrong" with more interconnection
between Hoover and the faculty de
partments, Rosenzweig said, "I think
it's a genuinely healthy develop
ment.
"The way in the long run to make
Hoover the academic and intellec
tual place it should be is to have
more, not fewer, joint appoint
ments," including the appointment
of Hoover research fellows to the
Stanford faculty if they are qualified,
he said.
Rosenzweig said suggestions that
Hoover had demanded "reciprocity"
from the Political Science Depart
ment in return for giving a number of
its faculty joint or courtesy appoint
ments did not bother him. "That is
the sort of give and take that goes on
in a University all the time," he said.
Hoover critics base much of their

argument concerning the negative
effects of growing ties with Hoover
on the contention that Hoover pro
motes a political cause as a result of
its domination by an "inner core" of
conservative, policy-oriented re
search staff.
Alexander Dallin, a professor of
history who spent seven years on
joint appointment at Hoover as a
senior fellow, said last week that
"when it comes to decisions about
hiring and firing and about what re
search commitment to take on,"
there is a "conservative inner
sanctum who control Hoover."
Although some faculty and ad
ministrators believe the way to bring
Hoover under control is to "get a
foot in the door by placing tenured
faculty over there" as joint appoint
ments, that "won't work," he said.
"You won't change the inner
