## The 						Stanford Daily Stanford West essential 
### 
For students on campus, the proposed Stan
ford West housing project may be viewed as just
something else the University wants to build.
But for faculty and staff, it would mean the al
leviation of a serious problem: the shortage of
housing.
Some area residents do not look at Stanford
West from either of these perspectives; they
think that if the project is completed as planned,
the community will suffer detrimental changes.
Stanford West has become a point of conten
tion between the University and the community
and may continue to be one until late spring
when the Palo Alto City Council will decide the
fate of the project.
Opposed local residents predict that the pro
posed 46-acre, 1275-unit housing facility would
crowd the area with people and cars, resulting
in traffic and environmental problems.
From an outsider's view, it appears the Uni
versity has thoroughly investigated the effects
on the environment; half a million dollars and a
considerable amount of time were spent on an
extensive environmental impact report.
The City Council will give the report a yea or
nay on May 2, and at the same time, it will
probably give the University some opinions on
how they should proceed.
The University is in a vulnerable position.
Since the City Council has full authority to veto
the project, officials here will be forced to
negotiate.
Council members have to listen to their con
stituents, but they also have to realize that the
University is not out to ruin the community.
They should let Stanford West proceed as
planned.

The most likely request the City Council will
make is for a reduction in the density — the
numbers of units — that will be included in the
project.
The University, logically, has rejected that
proposal to date. The purpose in building Stan
ford West is not only to provide more housing
for faculty and staff but also to make it afforda
ble. University officials state that reducing the
density by 100 units would increase the cost of
each remaining unit by approximately $1500.
Further reductions would be accompanied by
increasingly greater price hikes.
Palo Alto residents should not ask the Univer
sity to compromise if it would mean that getting
residents for Stanford West would be a problem
or only more wealthy faculty and staff could
afford to live there. That compromise would
defeat the purpose of building Stanford West.
Where the University should be extremely
sensitive to the wishes of community is in de
signing the individual units; the City Council
will be taking up the issue after they get past the
environmental impact report. Officials here
should be willing to compromise when the goal
of building numerous affordable units is not
threatened.
The controversy between the University and
the community was highlighted by an exchange
of letters from University President Donald
Kennedy to Menlo Park Mayor Pro Tem Peg
Gunn. Kennedy stated in his letter, "The need
for housing has become critical in our efforts to
recruit and retain a front-rank faculty."
The University has a big stake in this issue.
The Palo Alto City Council should let that stake
be planted.
