## The 						Collman case Honor Code needs attention 
### 
It has been brought to my atten
tion that some people believe that
my decision to accuse Prof, lames
Collman and the Chemistry Depart
ment of violating the Honor Code
was made on behalf of the student
charged with an Honor Code viola
tion by the Chemistry Department
fall quarter. This is not true. I have
not spoken with any student so
charged, nor do I know who he or
she is. Furthermore, my concerns are
not tied to any single past or pending
case.
When the Honor Code was ap
proved by students in 1922, the stu
dent body offered to "police" itself
in return for the faculty's demon
strated confidence in the honor of
individual Stanford students and the
system which they proposed. For
seven years the faculty declined to
approve this plan. In 1929, the faculty
did approve this student proposal,
although the degree of faculty re
sponsibility and accountability was
left unspecified. Originally, the ac
tions of the faculty conformed in let
ter and spirit to the student body's
request and therefore it seemed un
necessary to consider what actions
would be taken in the future if an
individual faculty member or the
faculty as a whole decided to with
draw the pledge of confidence which
the faculty originally made to the
Honor System.
Those of us currently at Stanford
are witnessing a slow but accelerat
ing withdrawal of faculty confidence
in the honor of Stanford's students
and consequently the system which
is dependent on the belief that stu
dents do behave honorably: the
Honor Code.
Today, mistrust of students is lo
calized primarily in the sciences —
chemistry, physics, biology and
pre-medical curricula are the
suggested topics of investigation by
the Honor Code Commission — but
without University action to prevent
such breaches of trust, the prospect
for this problem to metastasize is
both likely and alarming.
One consequence of this growing
faculty rejection of Stanford's Honor
System is the perception that stu
dents are coming to hold of their
peers; namely, that they are cheating
to gain preferential career footholds.
Whether the perception is correct
and students are less honorable, or
incorrect and students just believe
this to be the case, it is alarming to
live in a community making the tran
sition from trust to suspicion.
Those who came before us, over
the past 59 years, have worked to
preserve the valuable resource of
community trust: a resource that we
use not only during examinations,
but also silently, prior to every action
we take and every thought we have
regarding our special community
and the people who compose it. In
consideration of their efforts and the
preferences of the posterity on
whose behalf we necessarily act, we
must not see our task as less impor
tant or less formidable.
The individuals who have chosen
suspicion over trust marshall an im
pressive array of sophistry:
• The "pragmatists" claim that
pre-professionalism has changed the
character of the individual Stanford
student, and that it is better to have
the Honor Code in non-competitive

disciplines than to not have it at all.
• The "evolutionists" believe that
those who ignore the letter and spirit
of the Honor Code are perfecting it
by adapting it to the demonstrated
dishonesty of students, making the
organism more healthy for its viola
tion.
•The "rationalists," finally, be
lieve that there is not enough central
control to protect the system from
faculty violation and that technically
the faculty are not obliged, by con
tract, tocomply with the Honor Code
at all, and any compliance is purely
desirable gravy.
We, as a community, should not
be persuaded by this sophistry. It is
within our ability to assert our indig
nation that Stanford cannot exercise
its substantial intellectual and ad
ministrative prowess to protect a sys
tem which publicly and privately
reinforces the trust and respect
which must exist in a community of
our size and which has existed until
relatively recently. This is the one
choice that the suspicious dare not
mention, and those who choose it
form the fourth group — the honor
able and trusting.
It is within this context that I have
accused Collman of proctoring. Al
though some have told me that even
if he were found guilty, nothing
could be done to him, since the pre
sent administration believes com
pliance to be extracontractual and
optional, it is important that we chal
lenge the suspicious who have been
slowly and silently killing our Honor
Code in the privacy of their class
rooms. The classroom is no place for
such "reforms" because the implicit
threat of grade punishment creates
an inappropriate disincentive for
students to overlook the improper
actions of the grader.
I hope that my accusations will in
crease the perceived costs of engag
ing in this silent method of undoing
our foundations of mutual trust. I
hope to drive the suspicious from
this backroom tactic into the public
forum, where students and faculty,
and staff members may exercise their
scrutiny as a community. Perhaps
changes will be made along the lines
currently employed by the suspici
ous.
I believe, however, that our com
munity will support the Honor Sys
tem and that we can stop the back
room practices of as minority of sus
picious individuals. In my many con
versations with involved faculty and
administrators I have yet to hear why
a professor's presence in the class
room, even solely to answer ques
tions, represents enough of an in
stitutional benefit to offset the sub
stantial and commonly agreed upon
institutional costs.
The University has a difficult chal
lenge to meet, one it has deferred for
at least 17 years. The president, the
provost and the faculty must choose
between placating a minority of pre
stigious research faculty or uphold
ing the stated ethics of the institution
which continue to slip deeper into
decline. We, as members of this
community, must see it as a matter of
personal honor to protect the system
which confers integrity onto our
selves and our community.
Mark Epstein
Member, Honor Code Commission

Case is 'rubbish'
So now Mark Epstein is out to nail
Prof. James Collman for violating the
Honor Code. What utter rubbish.
Collman is one of the finest profes
sors I've had at Stanford, not only in
terms of his ability to teach difficult
subjects but to administer large and
unwieldy classes. The idea that he is
in violation of either the letter or the
spirit of the Honor Code is absurd.
But Epstein has a petition from 23
people saying that Collman's TAs
"had their heads up" during an
exam. Why he even has pictures of
the dastardly deed! I am not alone
when I say that I am relieved to hear
that chemistry TAs not only possess
heads (I had my doubts), but also
necks to hold them up with. But this
fact hardly constitutes Collman's
abusing the Honor Code.
Epstein was quoted as saying
"People aren't elected to do noth
ing" ("Chemistry prof, denies Honor
Code violation charge," Daily, April
18). If making these laughable ac
cusations is Epstein's idea of what he
was elected to do, then let's hear it
for doing nothing. I think that the
student body should put a muzzle on
their watch-dog before he goes bark
ing up the wrong tree again.
Kim Rachmeler
Senior, electrical engineering
TAs respond
As Chemistry TAs, we would like to
comment on the Honor Code viola
tion charges recently brought against
Prof. James Collman by Mark Eps
tein. Epstein's assertion that the pre
sence of TAs in exam rooms violates
the Honor Code is ludicrous. The
idea that a majority of students prefer
to have the TAs outside the class
room during an exam is unlikely.
Who wants to waste precious exam
time chasing down a TA to have a
question answered when it can be
answered right away if the TA is in the
room?
Those who feel their Honor Code
rights are being violated in such a
situation are evidently a minority.
This is demonstrated by Epstein's ab
surd list of 23 people who "saw TAs
with their heads up." Epstein fails to
mention that there were about 140
students in the class, most of whom
did not seem to be bothered by the
fact that the TAs did not keep their
eyes glued to the floor.
A rational way of dealing with the
problem of "proctoring" (Epstein's
word, not ours) by TAs would be to
have the students in a class vote at
the beginning of the quarter on
whether or not they wanted TAs in
the exam room. We are confident
that in the majority of cases the stu
dents would prefer having the TAs in
the room to having them outside.
And if they did not, then let us assure
you that, as TAs, we certainly have
things we would rather be doing than
sitting in on exams waiting for ques
tions.

I believe, however, that our com

picious individuals. In my many con
versations with involved faculty and
administrators I have yet to hear why
a professor's presence in the class
room, even solely to answer ques
tions, represents enough of an in
stitutional benefit to offset the sub
stantial and commonly agreed upon
institutional costs.
The University has a difficult chal

at least 17 years. The president, the
provost and the faculty must choose
between placating a minority of pre
stigious research faculty or uphold
ing the stated ethics of the institution
which continue to slip deeper into
decline. We, as members of this
community, must see it as a matter of
personal honor to protect the system
which confers integrity onto our

Mark Epstein
Member, Honor Code Commission

Case is 'rubbish'
So now Mark Epstein is out to nail
Prof. James Collman for violating the
Honor Code. What utter rubbish.
Collman is one of the finest profes
sors I've had at Stanford, not only in
terms of his ability to teach difficult
subjects but to administer large and
unwieldy classes. The idea that he is
in violation of either the letter or the
spirit of the Honor Code is absurd.
But Epstein has a petition from 23
people saying that Collman's TAs
"had their heads up" during an
exam. Why he even has pictures of
the dastardly deed! I am not alone
when I say that I am relieved to hear
that chemistry TAs not only possess
heads (I had my doubts), but also
necks to hold them up with. But this
fact hardly constitutes Collman's
abusing the Honor Code.
Epstein was quoted as saying
"People aren't elected to do noth
ing" ("Chemistry prof, denies Honor
Code violation charge," Daily, April
18). If making these laughable ac
cusations is Epstein's idea of what he
was elected to do, then let's hear it
for doing nothing. I think that the
student body should put a muzzle on
their watch-dog before he goes bark
ing up the wrong tree again.

TAs respond
As Chemistry TAs, we would like to
comment on the Honor Code viola
tion charges recently brought against
Prof. James Collman by Mark Eps
tein. Epstein's assertion that the pre
sence of TAs in exam rooms violates
the Honor Code is ludicrous. The
idea that a majority of students prefer
to have the TAs outside the class
room during an exam is unlikely.
Who wants to waste precious exam
time chasing down a TA to have a
question answered when it can be
answered right away if the TA is in the
room?
Those who feel their Honor Code
rights are being violated in such a
situation are evidently a minority.
This is demonstrated by Epstein's ab
surd list of 23 people who "saw TAs
with their heads up." Epstein fails to
mention that there were about 140
students in the class, most of whom
did not seem to be bothered by the
fact that the TAs did not keep their
eyes glued to the floor.
A rational way of dealing with the
problem of "proctoring" (Epstein's
word, not ours) by TAs would be to
have the students in a class vote at
the beginning of the quarter on
whether or not they wanted TAs in
the exam room. We are confident
that in the majority of cases the stu
dents would prefer having the TAs in
the room to having them outside.
And if they did not, then let us assure
you that, as TAs, we certainly have
things we would rather be doing than
sitting in on exams waiting for ques
tions.

It has been brought to my atten
tion that some people believe that
my decision to accuse Prof, lames
Collman and the Chemistry Depart
ment of violating the Honor Code
was made on behalf of the student
charged with an Honor Code viola
tion by the Chemistry Department
fall quarter. This is not true. I have
not spoken with any student so
charged, nor do I know who he or
she is. Furthermore, my concerns are
not tied to any single past or pending
case.
When the Honor Code was ap
proved by students in 1922, the stu
dent body offered to "police" itself
in return for the faculty's demon
strated confidence in the honor of
individual Stanford students and the
system which they proposed. For
seven years the faculty declined to
approve this plan. In 1929, the faculty
did approve this student proposal,
although the degree of faculty re
sponsibility and accountability was
left unspecified. Originally, the ac
tions of the faculty conformed in let
ter and spirit to the student body's
request and therefore it seemed un
necessary to consider what actions
would be taken in the future if an
individual faculty member or the
faculty as a whole decided to with
draw the pledge of confidence which
the faculty originally made to the
Honor System.
Those of us currently at Stanford
are witnessing a slow but accelerat
ing withdrawal of faculty confidence
in the honor of Stanford's students
and consequently the system which
is dependent on the belief that stu
dents do behave honorably: the
Honor Code.
Today, mistrust of students is lo
calized primarily in the sciences —
chemistry, physics, biology and
pre-medical curricula are the
suggested topics of investigation by
the Honor Code Commission — but
without University action to prevent
such breaches of trust, the prospect
for this problem to metastasize is
both likely and alarming.
One consequence of this growing
faculty rejection of Stanford's Honor
System is the perception that stu
dents are coming to hold of their
peers; namely, that they are cheating
to gain preferential career footholds.
Whether the perception is correct
and students are less honorable, or
incorrect and students just believe
this to be the case, it is alarming to
live in a community making the tran
sition from trust to suspicion.
Those who came before us, over
the past 59 years, have worked to
preserve the valuable resource of
community trust: a resource that we
use not only during examinations,
but also silently, prior to every action
we take and every thought we have
regarding our special community
and the people who compose it. In
consideration of their efforts and the
preferences of the posterity on
whose behalf we necessarily act, we
must not see our task as less impor
tant or less formidable.
The individuals who have chosen
suspicion over trust marshall an im
pressive array of sophistry:
• The "pragmatists" claim that
pre-professionalism has changed the
character of the individual Stanford
student, and that it is better to have
the Honor Code in non-competitive

disciplines than to not have it at all.
• The "evolutionists" believe that
those who ignore the letter and spirit
of the Honor Code are perfecting it
by adapting it to the demonstrated
dishonesty of students, making the
organism more healthy for its viola
tion.
•The "rationalists," finally, be
lieve that there is not enough central
control to protect the system from
faculty violation and that technically
the faculty are not obliged, by con
tract, tocomply with the Honor Code
at all, and any compliance is purely
desirable gravy.
We, as a community, should not
be persuaded by this sophistry. It is
within our ability to assert our indig
nation that Stanford cannot exercise
its substantial intellectual and ad
ministrative prowess to protect a sys
tem which publicly and privately
reinforces the trust and respect
which must exist in a community of
our size and which has existed until
relatively recently. This is the one
choice that the suspicious dare not
mention, and those who choose it
form the fourth group — the honor
able and trusting.
It is within this context that I have
accused Collman of proctoring. Al
though some have told me that even
if he were found guilty, nothing
could be done to him, since the pre
sent administration believes com
pliance to be extracontractual and
optional, it is important that we chal
lenge the suspicious who have been
slowly and silently killing our Honor
Code in the privacy of their class
rooms. The classroom is no place for
such "reforms" because the implicit
threat of grade punishment creates
an inappropriate disincentive for
students to overlook the improper
actions of the grader.
I hope that my accusations will in
crease the perceived costs of engag
ing in this silent method of undoing
our foundations of mutual trust. I
hope to drive the suspicious from
this backroom tactic into the public
forum, where students and faculty,
and staff members may exercise their
scrutiny as a community. Perhaps
changes will be made along the lines
currently employed by the suspici
ous.
I believe, however, that our com
munity will support the Honor Sys

did approve this student proposal,
although the degree of faculty re
sponsibility and accountability was
left unspecified. Originally, the ac
tions of the faculty conformed in let
ter and spirit to the student body's
request and therefore it seemed un
necessary to consider what actions
would be taken in the future if an
individual faculty member or the
faculty as a whole decided to with
draw the pledge of confidence which
the faculty originally made to the
Honor System.
Those of us currently at Stanford
are witnessing a slow but accelerat
ing withdrawal of faculty confidence
in the honor of Stanford's students
and consequently the system which
is dependent on the belief that stu
dents do behave honorably: the
Honor Code.
Today, mistrust of students is lo
calized primarily in the sciences —
chemistry, physics, biology and
pre-medical curricula are the
suggested topics of investigation by
the Honor Code Commission — but
without University action to prevent
such breaches of trust, the prospect
for this problem to metastasize is
both likely and alarming.
One consequence of this growing
faculty rejection of Stanford's Honor
System is the perception that stu
dents are coming to hold of their
peers; namely, that they are cheating
to gain preferential career footholds.
Whether the perception is correct
and students are less honorable, or
incorrect and students just believe
this to be the case, it is alarming to
live in a community making the tran
sition from trust to suspicion.
Those who came before us, over
the past 59 years, have worked to
preserve the valuable resource of
community trust: a resource that we
use not only during examinations,
but also silently, prior to every action
we take and every thought we have
regarding our special community
and the people who compose it. In
consideration of their efforts and the
preferences of the posterity on
whose behalf we necessarily act, we
must not see our task as less impor
tant or less formidable.
The individuals who have chosen
suspicion over trust marshall an im
pressive array of sophistry:
• The "pragmatists" claim that
pre-professionalism has changed the
character of the individual Stanford
student, and that it is better to have
the Honor Code in non-competitive

disciplines than to not have it at all.
• The "evolutionists" believe that
those who ignore the letter and spirit
of the Honor Code are perfecting it
by adapting it to the demonstrated
dishonesty of students, making the
organism more healthy for its viola
tion.
•The "rationalists," finally, be
lieve that there is not enough central
control to protect the system from
faculty violation and that technically
the faculty are not obliged, by con
tract, tocomply with the Honor Code
at all, and any compliance is purely
desirable gravy.
We, as a community, should not
be persuaded by this sophistry. It is
within our ability to assert our indig
nation that Stanford cannot exercise
its substantial intellectual and ad
ministrative prowess to protect a sys
tem which publicly and privately
reinforces the trust and respect
which must exist in a community of
our size and which has existed until
relatively recently. This is the one
choice that the suspicious dare not
mention, and those who choose it
form the fourth group — the honor
able and trusting.
It is within this context that I have
accused Collman of proctoring. Al
though some have told me that even
if he were found guilty, nothing
could be done to him, since the pre
sent administration believes com
pliance to be extracontractual and
optional, it is important that we chal
lenge the suspicious who have been
slowly and silently killing our Honor
Code in the privacy of their class
rooms. The classroom is no place for
such "reforms" because the implicit
threat of grade punishment creates
an inappropriate disincentive for
students to overlook the improper
actions of the grader.
I hope that my accusations will in
crease the perceived costs of engag
ing in this silent method of undoing
our foundations of mutual trust. I
hope to drive the suspicious from
this backroom tactic into the public
forum, where students and faculty,
and staff members may exercise their
scrutiny as a community. Perhaps
changes will be made along the lines
currently employed by the suspici
ous.
I believe, however, that our com
munity will support the Honor Sys
tem and that we can stop the back
room practices of as minority of sus
picious individuals. In my many con
versations with involved faculty and
administrators I have yet to hear why
a professor's presence in the class
room, even solely to answer ques
tions, represents enough of an in
stitutional benefit to offset the sub
stantial and commonly agreed upon
institutional costs.
The University has a difficult chal
lenge to meet, one it has deferred for
at least 17 years. The president, the
provost and the faculty must choose
between placating a minority of pre
stigious research faculty or uphold
ing the stated ethics of the institution
which continue to slip deeper into
decline. We, as members of this
community, must see it as a matter of
personal honor to protect the system
which confers integrity onto our
selves and our community.

Member, Honor Code Commission

Case is 'rubbish'
So now Mark Epstein is out to nail
Prof. James Collman for violating the
Honor Code. What utter rubbish.
Collman is one of the finest profes
sors I've had at Stanford, not only in
terms of his ability to teach difficult
subjects but to administer large and
unwieldy classes. The idea that he is
in violation of either the letter or the
spirit of the Honor Code is absurd.
But Epstein has a petition from 23
people saying that Collman's TAs
"had their heads up" during an
exam. Why he even has pictures of
the dastardly deed! I am not alone
when I say that I am relieved to hear
that chemistry TAs not only possess
heads (I had my doubts), but also
necks to hold them up with. But this
fact hardly constitutes Collman's
abusing the Honor Code.
Epstein was quoted as saying
"People aren't elected to do noth
ing" ("Chemistry prof, denies Honor
Code violation charge," Daily, April
18). If making these laughable ac
cusations is Epstein's idea of what he
was elected to do, then let's hear it
for doing nothing. I think that the
student body should put a muzzle on
their watch-dog before he goes bark
ing up the wrong tree again.

TAs respond
As Chemistry TAs, we would like to
comment on the Honor Code viola
tion charges recently brought against
Prof. James Collman by Mark Eps
tein. Epstein's assertion that the pre
sence of TAs in exam rooms violates
the Honor Code is ludicrous. The
idea that a majority of students prefer
to have the TAs outside the class
room during an exam is unlikely.
Who wants to waste precious exam
time chasing down a TA to have a
question answered when it can be
answered right away if the TA is in the
room?
Those who feel their Honor Code
rights are being violated in such a
situation are evidently a minority.
This is demonstrated by Epstein's ab
surd list of 23 people who "saw TAs
with their heads up." Epstein fails to
mention that there were about 140
students in the class, most of whom
did not seem to be bothered by the
fact that the TAs did not keep their
eyes glued to the floor.
A rational way of dealing with the
problem of "proctoring" (Epstein's
word, not ours) by TAs would be to
have the students in a class vote at
the beginning of the quarter on
whether or not they wanted TAs in
the exam room. We are confident
that in the majority of cases the stu
dents would prefer having the TAs in
the room to having them outside.
And if they did not, then let us assure
you that, as TAs, we certainly have
things we would rather be doing than
sitting in on exams waiting for ques
tions.
