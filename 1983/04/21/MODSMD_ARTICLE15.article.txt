"Plenty of Good Seats Still Available!" That's not bor
rowed from an Oakland As commercial or from a pitch
for Golden Gate theater. Rather, it's the new slogan for
Guest Prof. Paul "Pete" McCloskey's course, "The Con
gressional Decision-Making Process." In the 336-seat
Bishop Auditorium where the course is held, the empty
seats outnumber the people by more than six to one.
According to McCloskey, the sparse crowds are due to
a lack of publicity. Specifically, he accuses Seth Linfield,
director of the Guest Professorship Bureau, of trying to
"torpedo" the class by preventing students from know
ing about and enrolling in it. Furthermore, he claims that
Linfield is guilty of "Jewish censorship" (as opposed to
regular censorship) for deleting some of the reading
material which McCloskey had originally included in his
syllabus.
His accusations are vintage McCloskey: controversial
and inaccurate. The campus debate concerning the de
cision to even consider McCloskey for the guest profes
sor slot resulted in more publicity for this class than for
any class that has ever been taught at Stanford. The
continuing saga of McCloskey's quest to teach here has
been a regular page one feature in the Daily since early
November.
Moreover, once he was approved, fliers were posted
all over campus announcing the course. At advance reg
istration, students were greeted by a large poster de
scribing how to sign up for the course. The course was
also listed in the "Time Schedule Changes," which ap
peared in the Daily and was available at the Registrar's
Office. In short, anyone who didn't know that McClos
key was going to teach a class here probably also doesn't
know that John Elway quarterbacked the football team,
or that the tall, skinny building in the center of campus is
called Hoover Tower.
His personal attack of Linfield is equally absurd and
ironic. Without Linfield, you see, McCloskey would
probably not be at Stanford. His strong defense of the
former congressman before the ASSU Senate on Jan. 25
was crucial to McCloskey's approval. McCloskey has no
record of teaching undergraduates. So, as a condition to
that approval, the senate made the Guest Professorship
Bureau responsible for ensuring a manageable reading
list of academic quality. The original reading list that
McCloskey submitted contained far too many pages for
a three-unit class, and some written material that was not
considered academically rigorous.
According to Linfield, the two men spent many hours
revising the syllabus to ensure a reading list of academic
quality and reasonable length. An agreement was
reached which, in fact, McCloskey has violated. "He's

changed a lot of what was agreed to for lessons one
through six and seven through 10," says Linfield.
Why, then, does pitiful Pete accuse Linfield of "Jewish
censorship?" Probably for the same reason that he has
made several other inflammatory statements about the
Jewish community over the past few years and particu
larly over the past few months: he thrives on con
troversy.
He spoke out against Vietnam in 1967, challenged
Nixon in 19/2 and later called for Nixon's impeachment.
He has portrayed himself as the tough guy, the one
willing to take the "unpopular" stand, not afraid to go
out on a limb and speak his mind. He is gifted with an
uncanny sense of the public mood; he always knows
when an "unpopular" position is popular enough to get
him reelected.
His most recent crusade against Israel and the Ameri
can Jewish community didn't earn him enough votes to
defeat Pete Wilson in the Republican senatorial primary,
but it did enable him to get a lot of national media
attention. And as long as there is someone with a pad
and pen or a TV camera who is willing to listen, McClos
key will continue to talk. He won't, however, fill an
auditorium at Stanford.
Students here take courses from prominent academi
cians who have researched their subjects pxfensjve/y.
Sometimes that research leads to "unpopular" posi
tions. Those positions are presented, discussed, and
debated in an effort to promote intellectual and creative
thought.
Pete McCloskey's positions are presented to promote
Pete McCloskey. While the professor that studies a topic
and is not afraid to take an unpopular stand is admirable,
the ex-congressman who does not research his topic
and takes the unpopular stand to grab a headline is not
admirable. Rather, he is pitiful. Pitiful is the only way to
describe a man who shouted for the creation of a Pales
tinian homeland on the West Bank, but couldn't even
point to the West Bank on an unmarked map. That inci
dent, which took place in July, shouldn't shock anyone. I
have a feeling that if you showed McCloskey an un
marked map of the United States he'd have a hard time
pointing out California.
Less than 1 percent of the undergraduates at Stanford
are enrolled in McCloskey's course. Not because of a
lack of publicity. Not because of "Jewish censorship."
Not because he wants to cut off aid to Israel. It's just that
McCloskey gives the impression that the road to intel
lectual fulfillment does not pass through Bishop Au
ditorium on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
