# Just a signature at the bottom of fine print?
## Details of Honor Code may be little known

When the average student
scrawls his signature on the
outside of a bluebook, the im
minent exam seems more
pressing than the fine print of
the Honor Code.
The controversy recently
stirred up by COP member
Mark Epstein's allegation that a
chemistry professor proctored
his exams has thrust the Honor
Code into the center of cam
pus conversations.
Yet although the penalties
can be severe, many students
are insufficiently aware of the
implications of the Honor
Code and the specifics of how
violations are handled when
they do occur, according to
Sally Cole, assistant dean of
student affairs. As a result of
these misconceptions, inad
vertent violations and
shortcutting official procedure
may result.
Though the Honor Code has
been the primary device to in
sure a proper academic atmos
phere since 1921, it is actually
only a specialized guideline
within a larger body of regula
tions governing student con
duct.
The most important of these
regulations is the Fundamental
Standard, an umbrella regula
tion which states, "Students at
Stanford are expected to show
both within and without the
University such respect for or
der, morality, personal honor
and the right of others as is
demanded of good citizens.
Failure to do so will be suffi
cient cause for removal from
the University."
The third regulation is the
Policy on Campus Disruption
which seeks to preserve dig
nity and prevent obstruction of
University functions or indi
viduals' rights.
The majority of trespasses
violate the Honor Code, ac
cording to statistics compiled
by the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs.
The penalties can be severe.
"I would like to stress that the
usual penalty is a one-quarter
suspension as well as a No-
Credit grade," Cole said.
The most common penalty
has been the giving of the
grade No-Credit, which has
happened 60 times in the last
10 years. In this same time
period 48 one-quarter suspen
sions have been imposed. A
person's degree could be an
nulled or postponed. This was
done six times last year.
Penalties are supposed to be
limited to the types enumer
ated in the Student Conduct
Penalty Code. These types are:
expulsion, indefinite suspen
sion, suspension, monetary
fines, loss of a right or
privilege, probation, formal
censure and academic penal
ties. Academic penalties may
only be imposed in the case of
Honor Code violations.
Violations of the Fundamen
tal Standard tend to draw stiffer
penalties — fines and longer
suspensions — because the
charges are usually associated
with more serious offenses
such as theft, assault, van
dalism and forgery.
Although Fundamental
Standard violations are not as
common as Honor Code viola
tions, there have been 39 cases
brought up in the last 10 years.
All financial fines as well as
many work fines imposed dur

ing this period have been re
lated to the Standard.
Prosecution of these viola
tions is supposed to be han
dled by a thorough administra
tive judicial system, but the
exigencies of academic life
often cause bypasses of official
procedure.
Instances abound of profes
sors, or even graders, handling
an Honor Code question with
out resorting to a formal com
plaint.
A former "History I" stu
dent, who declined to release
her name, failed to footnote
some phrases that she used in a
paper, a possible violation of
the Honor Code. After explain
ing that this was a mistake
rather than intentional decep
tion, the instructor
downgraded her paper 10

points. No official complaint
was ever made.
"The area of plagiarism is
probably the fuzziest," Cole
said. "The faculty in depart
ments where there's a lot of
writing encounter that fre
quently." She pointed out that,
for example, the English De
partment has put out detailed
guidelines for properly at
tributing sources.
In an engineering class last
quarter, a grader took matters
into his own hands regarding a
problem set, according to a
student who also declined to
release his name. Two students
were given half credit, with the
comment that collaboration
was evident and, thus, they
each deserved credit for only
half the work. The students

claimed they were mistreated
because they were under the
impression that "working to
gether" was expressly permit
ted. Confused over what to do,
they finally went to the profes
sor who then gave them full
credit. Again, no formal com
plaint was ever made.
According to administrators
involved with the issue, these
two cases bring up a conflict
regarding minor infractions of
the Code. On the one hand, it
would be unreasonable if
every unconscious mistake or
minor violation of questiona
ble intent had to be dragged
through official procedure. On
the other hand, if violations
become regularly handled out
side of defined procedures,
the whole Honor Code system
could be undermined. Going

through the official process is
the only way to ensure fairness
and consistency in judgment
and imposition of penalties. As
Cole put it, "If the system is
goingto work and have respect
of faculty and students it must
be adhered to."
Technically, an instructor is
not allowed to penalty grade
for dishonesty without formal
proceedings unless the stu
dent gives consent. It is un
clear whether this means that
deciding matters outside es
tablished judicial procedure is
acceptable as long as there is
consent from student and in
structor. Although this is not
expressly forbidden, it seems
to go against the grain of the
judicial process.
According to Cole, the Stu

dent Legislative Council has
spent time this year discussing
penalty grading. They are re
viewing the extent to which it
may be a problem and how it
should be dealt with. They
have not yet reached any con
clusions. Cole said, "The way
the code is stated it appears to
allow what's called penalty
grading."
The Student judicial Council
(S)C) is named as having juris
diction over all student discip
linary cases, except when a
student requests that his case
be heard by the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs.
If a student thinks discipli
nary action without proper jud
icial proceedings has oc
curred, he can file a complaint
with the SJC. This special case
is the only time when faculty

are brought under the jurisdic
tion of the SJC.
Other cases of faculty Honor
Code violation must go
through academic grievance
procedures. This involves first
going to the faculty member to
attempt resolution. If this is in
adequate a written grievance
could be filed, which would
initiate an investigation.
The faculty end of the Honor
Code — which has been much
debated recently — consists, in
part, of refraining from "un
usual and unreasonable pre
cautions" and "procedures
that create temptations to vio
late the Honor Code."
The possibility for broad and
varied interpretations of
phrases such as these has
caused confusion among stu
dents and faculty. It is often dif
ficult to define what is the best
way to insure that, as stated in
the Honor Code, "the students
and faculty will work together
to establish optimal conditions
for honorable academic
work."
If a student is finally charged,
he has a choice regarding the
judicial action which will en
sue.
If a person admits guilt, he
may have his case heard by the
Dean of Student Affairs, last
year, 18 out of 20 charges were
handled in this manner. The
other option is to refer the case
to the SJC.
The S)C route is less fre
quently taken, having only
been used 14 times in the last
10 years. The SIC has not yet
heard any cases this year.
Before SJC proceedings be
gin, the case is actually heard
by an attorney outside of the
University. This Hearing Of
ficer is supposed to determine
relevant facts in the case. (If
both sides agree upon what
facts are relevant, the Hearing
Officer stage may be
bypassed.) The findings of the
Hearing Officer are submitted
to the SJC along with prelimi
nary recommendations.
After SJC hearings are con
ducted, a determination is
made. This concludes whether
or not facts found by the Hear
ing Officer constitute a viola
tion and what disciplinary ac
tion should be taken.
The determination of the S)C
as well as any decision made by
the Dean of Student Affairs are
not appealable. However, they
are merely recommendations
to the president. He usually
"red-stamps" them, according
to George Zimmerman, a stu
dent member of the current
SJC. But changed penalties are
not unprecedented and some
times written comments are is
sued.

of faculty and students it must
be adhered to."
Technically, an instructor is
not allowed to penalty grade
for dishonesty without formal
proceedings unless the stu
dent gives consent. It is un
clear whether this means that
deciding matters outside es
tablished judicial procedure is
acceptable as long as there is
consent from student and in
structor. Although this is not
expressly forbidden, it seems
to go against the grain of the
judicial process.
According to Cole, the Stu

dent Legislative Council has
spent time this year discussing
penalty grading. They are re
viewing the extent to which it
may be a problem and how it
should be dealt with. They
have not yet reached any con
clusions. Cole said, "The way
the code is stated it appears to
allow what's called penalty
grading."
The Student judicial Council
(S)C) is named as having juris
diction over all student discip
linary cases, except when a
student requests that his case
be heard by the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs.
If a student thinks discipli
nary action without proper jud
icial proceedings has oc
curred, he can file a complaint
with the SJC. This special case
is the only time when faculty

are brought under the jurisdic
tion of the SJC.
Other cases of faculty Honor
Code violation must go
through academic grievance
procedures. This involves first
going to the faculty member to
attempt resolution. If this is in
adequate a written grievance
could be filed, which would
initiate an investigation.
The faculty end of the Honor
Code — which has been much
debated recently — consists, in
part, of refraining from "un
usual and unreasonable pre
cautions" and "procedures
that create temptations to vio
late the Honor Code."
The possibility for broad and
varied interpretations of
phrases such as these has
caused confusion among stu
dents and faculty. It is often dif
ficult to define what is the best
way to insure that, as stated in
the Honor Code, "the students
and faculty will work together
to establish optimal conditions
for honorable academic
work."
If a student is finally charged,
he has a choice regarding the
judicial action which will en
sue.
If a person admits guilt, he
may have his case heard by the
Dean of Student Affairs, last
year, 18 out of 20 charges were
handled in this manner. The
other option is to refer the case
to the SJC.
The S)C route is less fre
quently taken, having only
been used 14 times in the last
10 years. The SIC has not yet
heard any cases this year.
Before SJC proceedings be
gin, the case is actually heard
by an attorney outside of the
University. This Hearing Of
ficer is supposed to determine
relevant facts in the case. (If
both sides agree upon what
facts are relevant, the Hearing
Officer stage may be
bypassed.) The findings of the
Hearing Officer are submitted
to the SJC along with prelimi
nary recommendations.
After SJC hearings are con
ducted, a determination is
made. This concludes whether
or not facts found by the Hear
ing Officer constitute a viola
tion and what disciplinary ac
tion should be taken.
The determination of the S)C
as well as any decision made by
the Dean of Student Affairs are
not appealable. However, they
are merely recommendations
to the president. He usually
"red-stamps" them, according
to George Zimmerman, a stu
dent member of the current
SJC. But changed penalties are
not unprecedented and some
times written comments are is
sued.

When the average student
scrawls his signature on the
outside of a bluebook, the im
minent exam seems more
pressing than the fine print of
the Honor Code.
The controversy recently
stirred up by COP member
Mark Epstein's allegation that a
chemistry professor proctored
his exams has thrust the Honor
Code into the center of cam
pus conversations.
Yet although the penalties
can be severe, many students
are insufficiently aware of the
implications of the Honor
Code and the specifics of how
violations are handled when
they do occur, according to
Sally Cole, assistant dean of
student affairs. As a result of
these misconceptions, inad
vertent violations and
shortcutting official procedure
may result.
Though the Honor Code has
been the primary device to in
sure a proper academic atmos
phere since 1921, it is actually
only a specialized guideline
within a larger body of regula
tions governing student con
duct.
The most important of these
regulations is the Fundamental
Standard, an umbrella regula
tion which states, "Students at
Stanford are expected to show
both within and without the
University such respect for or
der, morality, personal honor
and the right of others as is
demanded of good citizens.
Failure to do so will be suffi
cient cause for removal from
the University."
The third regulation is the
Policy on Campus Disruption
which seeks to preserve dig
nity and prevent obstruction of
University functions or indi
viduals' rights.
The majority of trespasses
violate the Honor Code, ac
cording to statistics compiled
by the Office of the Dean of
Student Affairs.
The penalties can be severe.
"I would like to stress that the
usual penalty is a one-quarter
suspension as well as a No-
Credit grade," Cole said.
The most common penalty
has been the giving of the
grade No-Credit, which has
happened 60 times in the last
10 years. In this same time
period 48 one-quarter suspen
sions have been imposed. A
person's degree could be an
nulled or postponed. This was
done six times last year.
Penalties are supposed to be
limited to the types enumer
ated in the Student Conduct
Penalty Code. These types are:
expulsion, indefinite suspen
sion, suspension, monetary
fines, loss of a right or
privilege, probation, formal
censure and academic penal
ties. Academic penalties may
only be imposed in the case of
Honor Code violations.
Violations of the Fundamen
tal Standard tend to draw stiffer
penalties — fines and longer
suspensions — because the
charges are usually associated
with more serious offenses
such as theft, assault, van
dalism and forgery.
Although Fundamental
Standard violations are not as
common as Honor Code viola
tions, there have been 39 cases
brought up in the last 10 years.
All financial fines as well as
many work fines imposed dur

ing this period have been re
lated to the Standard.
Prosecution of these viola
tions is supposed to be han
dled by a thorough administra
tive judicial system, but the
exigencies of academic life
often cause bypasses of official
procedure.
Instances abound of profes
sors, or even graders, handling
an Honor Code question with
out resorting to a formal com
plaint.
A former "History I" stu
dent, who declined to release
her name, failed to footnote
some phrases that she used in a
paper, a possible violation of
the Honor Code. After explain
ing that this was a mistake
rather than intentional decep
tion, the instructor
downgraded her paper 10

points. No official complaint
was ever made.
"The area of plagiarism is
probably the fuzziest," Cole
said. "The faculty in depart
ments where there's a lot of
writing encounter that fre
quently." She pointed out that,
for example, the English De
partment has put out detailed
guidelines for properly at
tributing sources.
In an engineering class last
quarter, a grader took matters
into his own hands regarding a
problem set, according to a
student who also declined to
release his name. Two students
were given half credit, with the
comment that collaboration
was evident and, thus, they
each deserved credit for only
half the work. The students

claimed they were mistreated
because they were under the
impression that "working to
gether" was expressly permit
ted. Confused over what to do,
they finally went to the profes
sor who then gave them full
credit. Again, no formal com
plaint was ever made.
According to administrators
involved with the issue, these
two cases bring up a conflict
regarding minor infractions of
the Code. On the one hand, it
would be unreasonable if
every unconscious mistake or
minor violation of questiona
ble intent had to be dragged
through official procedure. On
the other hand, if violations
become regularly handled out
side of defined procedures,
the whole Honor Code system
could be undermined. Going

through the official process is
the only way to ensure fairness
and consistency in judgment
and imposition of penalties. As
Cole put it, "If the system is
goingto work and have respect
of faculty and students it must
be adhered to."
Technically, an instructor is
not allowed to penalty grade

The penalties can be severe.
"I would like to stress that the
usual penalty is a one-quarter
suspension as well as a No-
Credit grade," Cole said.
The most common penalty
has been the giving of the
grade No-Credit, which has
happened 60 times in the last
10 years. In this same time
period 48 one-quarter suspen
sions have been imposed. A
person's degree could be an
nulled or postponed. This was
done six times last year.
Penalties are supposed to be
limited to the types enumer
ated in the Student Conduct
Penalty Code. These types are:
expulsion, indefinite suspen
sion, suspension, monetary
fines, loss of a right or
privilege, probation, formal
censure and academic penal
ties. Academic penalties may
only be imposed in the case of
Honor Code violations.
Violations of the Fundamen
tal Standard tend to draw stiffer
penalties — fines and longer
suspensions — because the
charges are usually associated
with more serious offenses
such as theft, assault, van
dalism and forgery.
Although Fundamental
Standard violations are not as
common as Honor Code viola
tions, there have been 39 cases
brought up in the last 10 years.
All financial fines as well as
many work fines imposed dur

ing this period have been re
lated to the Standard.
Prosecution of these viola
tions is supposed to be han
dled by a thorough administra
tive judicial system, but the
exigencies of academic life
often cause bypasses of official
procedure.
Instances abound of profes
sors, or even graders, handling
an Honor Code question with
out resorting to a formal com
plaint.
A former "History I" stu
dent, who declined to release
her name, failed to footnote
some phrases that she used in a
paper, a possible violation of
the Honor Code. After explain
ing that this was a mistake
rather than intentional decep
tion, the instructor
downgraded her paper 10

points. No official complaint
was ever made.
"The area of plagiarism is
probably the fuzziest," Cole
said. "The faculty in depart
ments where there's a lot of
writing encounter that fre
quently." She pointed out that,
for example, the English De
partment has put out detailed
guidelines for properly at
tributing sources.
In an engineering class last
quarter, a grader took matters
into his own hands regarding a
problem set, according to a
student who also declined to
release his name. Two students
were given half credit, with the
comment that collaboration
was evident and, thus, they
each deserved credit for only
half the work. The students

claimed they were mistreated
because they were under the
impression that "working to
gether" was expressly permit
ted. Confused over what to do,
they finally went to the profes
sor who then gave them full
credit. Again, no formal com
plaint was ever made.
According to administrators
involved with the issue, these
two cases bring up a conflict
regarding minor infractions of
the Code. On the one hand, it
would be unreasonable if
every unconscious mistake or
minor violation of questiona
ble intent had to be dragged
through official procedure. On
the other hand, if violations
become regularly handled out
side of defined procedures,
the whole Honor Code system
could be undermined. Going

through the official process is
the only way to ensure fairness
and consistency in judgment
and imposition of penalties. As
Cole put it, "If the system is
goingto work and have respect
of faculty and students it must
be adhered to."
Technically, an instructor is
not allowed to penalty grade
for dishonesty without formal
proceedings unless the stu
dent gives consent. It is un
clear whether this means that
deciding matters outside es
tablished judicial procedure is
acceptable as long as there is
consent from student and in
structor. Although this is not
expressly forbidden, it seems
to go against the grain of the
judicial process.
According to Cole, the Stu

dent Legislative Council has
spent time this year discussing
penalty grading. They are re
viewing the extent to which it
may be a problem and how it
should be dealt with. They
have not yet reached any con
clusions. Cole said, "The way
the code is stated it appears to
allow what's called penalty
grading."
The Student judicial Council
(S)C) is named as having juris
diction over all student discip
linary cases, except when a
student requests that his case
be heard by the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs.
If a student thinks discipli
nary action without proper jud
icial proceedings has oc
curred, he can file a complaint
with the SJC. This special case
is the only time when faculty

are brought under the jurisdic
tion of the SJC.
Other cases of faculty Honor
Code violation must go
through academic grievance
procedures. This involves first
going to the faculty member to
attempt resolution. If this is in
adequate a written grievance
could be filed, which would
initiate an investigation.
The faculty end of the Honor
Code — which has been much
debated recently — consists, in
part, of refraining from "un
usual and unreasonable pre
cautions" and "procedures
that create temptations to vio
late the Honor Code."
The possibility for broad and
varied interpretations of
phrases such as these has
caused confusion among stu
dents and faculty. It is often dif
ficult to define what is the best
way to insure that, as stated in
the Honor Code, "the students
and faculty will work together
to establish optimal conditions
for honorable academic
work."
If a student is finally charged,
he has a choice regarding the
judicial action which will en
sue.
If a person admits guilt, he
may have his case heard by the
Dean of Student Affairs, last
year, 18 out of 20 charges were
handled in this manner. The
other option is to refer the case
to the SJC.
The S)C route is less fre
quently taken, having only
been used 14 times in the last
10 years. The SIC has not yet
heard any cases this year.
Before SJC proceedings be
gin, the case is actually heard
by an attorney outside of the
University. This Hearing Of
ficer is supposed to determine
relevant facts in the case. (If
both sides agree upon what
facts are relevant, the Hearing
Officer stage may be
bypassed.) The findings of the
Hearing Officer are submitted
to the SJC along with prelimi
nary recommendations.
After SJC hearings are con
ducted, a determination is
made. This concludes whether
or not facts found by the Hear
ing Officer constitute a viola
tion and what disciplinary ac
tion should be taken.
The determination of the S)C
as well as any decision made by
the Dean of Student Affairs are
not appealable. However, they
are merely recommendations
to the president. He usually
"red-stamps" them, according
to George Zimmerman, a stu
dent member of the current
SJC. But changed penalties are
not unprecedented and some
times written comments are is
sued.
