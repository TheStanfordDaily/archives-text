# Hearing impaired misunderstood
## 
### SHELLY WENTKER 
Since the 1950s people have
become more aware of the
needs of the hearing impaired.
During the '60s, the hearing
population began to accept the
deaf as part of their community
while during the '70s, it began
to respect them.
"That's not good enough,"
said Paul Ogden, associate
professor of communicative
disorders at California State
University, Fresno, who ad
dressed a crowd of about 100
people in Bishop Auditorium
on Monday night.
What is missing now, Ogden
said, is adequate communica
tion between the deaf and the
hearing. "The hearing don't
understand the deaf," he ad
ded.
Deaf himself since birth,
Ogden spoke through an in
terpreter on "Hearing Families
and Deaf Children." Addres
sing problems in communica
tion between hearing parents
and the deaf child Ogden fre
quently referred to his book
The Silent Garden. A compila
tion of his experiences grow
ing up as a deaf child and inter
views with some 200 parents of
deaf children and 250 deaf
people from different educa
tional and economic back
grounds, The Silent Garden
contains "a wealth of informa
tion for parents raising a deaf
child," according to Cathy
Ransom, the sign language in
structor in the Stanford Lin
guistics Department who is
also deaf.
Ransom said that in having
Ogden speak at Stanford, the
Linguistics Department, co
sponsoring the event with Og
den, hoped to reach'many Bay
Area people who have deaf
children". Ogden said she
wants "to share his experi
ences with hearing people to
improve communications."
Ogden began his presenta
tion by assessing that there are
six areas of importance to dis
cuss about the book with re
gard to communication and
understanding between the
hearing family and the deaf
child: emotions, healthy home
environments, nonverbal
communication, school envi
ronment, reading and lan
guage and independence.
"You have to dea\ with emo
tions first," he explained.
"When parents decide to start
a family, they want a child who
is perfect: a reflection of them
selves," Ogden continued. If a
child is not what they wanted,
"they go through a period of

shock, he explained. After the
state of shock,parents prog
ress into a state of recognition
of, "my child is deaf," which is
followed by feelings of grief,
guilt, blame, shame, anger and
frustration. Eventually, the
parents' emotions move into a
period of denial. Then they
begin to acknowledge the fact
that their child is deaf and this
leads to the final stage of the
process of "working through
emotions," as Ogden calls it.
The action stage is the period
when the parents can and do
make plans for their child's fu
ture such as deciding where to
send him to school.

According to Ogden, this
process of working through
emotions" is necessary for
parents or else they tend to be
come frustrated. He cites as an
example the case of a young
mother with a deaf son who
would pay other children to
play with her son. This situa
tion was not helpful to the son
and caused the mother further
frustration. Before parents can
really communicate with their
deaf child, they must "work
through their emotions," he
said.
Once families have com
pleted this process, they are
ready "to work with the child

and make adjustments in the
home," Ogden said. This lead
Ogden to his second topicâ€”
the healthy home environ
ment.
Ogden explained that a
healthy home environment is
"communication, love and
support for the deaf child plus
making time for him." Em
phasizing the importance of
communication, he urged par
ents to be more visually
oriented and to explain every
thing to their deaf child. While
hearing children learn a lot
from listening to others, "deaf
children must be taught," he
added.

Although they do not hear,
deaf children do pick up a lot
from body language, or non
verbal communications, as
Ogden termed it. In order for
hearing people to communi
cate effectively with the deaf,
exaggeration of body language
is recommended. Claiming
that our society places some
limitations on the amount of
body language we express, he
stressed the necessity of using
large movements with smaller
children at their eye level. As
the child gets older, he advised
that the hearing person use
nonverbal communication in a
more sophisticated and subtle
way.
Because their knowledge is
limited, the parents find the
school environment difficult to
confront. The most important
thing for parents to do regard
ingschools, he said, istocheck
the quality of the school and
make sure that the teacher re
ally knows sign language, "A
lot of teachers are not qualified
to be there," he added. For
example, Ogden said, if a
teacher forgets or does not
know the sign for a certain
word such as "carpet" he may
use the signs for the separate
words "car" and "pet" and this
confuses the child.
Other areas which involve
the parents are reading and lan
guage. Ogden urged parents
to take time to with their chil
dren and to encourage them to
read. The best way to do this,
he said, is to "read stories at
bedtime, five or six times a
week." What the parent reads
is not important. It should be a
simple book, maybe even a
comic book, he added.
Despite his recom
mendations to spend a lot of
time and attention on the deaf
child, Ogden also cautioned
parents against being over
protective. Parents must let
their child become indepen
dent and one "key to indepen
dence" is to let the child make
decisions such as whether or
not it is safe to cross the street,
hecontinued. Furthermore, he
mentioned the importance of
the deaf child's meeting other
deaf people, both children and
adults. "Let him meet all kinds
of deaf people," Ogden said.
In concluding his presenta
tion, Ogden expressed a desire
to share his experiences in
order to help parents under
stand their deaf children. Ran
som said that this is the first
time such information has
been shared and "that's what's
so wonderful."
