# Cliveden program ends this year
## 
### CHRISTOPHER JARVIS 
Queen Elizabeth II of England reportedly enjoyed meet
ing students here at the luncheon held at University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's house March 3. But she didn't have
to journey across the Atlantic to meet Stanford students,
since the Cliveden Stanford campus is only five miles from
Windsor Castle.
But time is running out for the queen — and for students
here — to go to the Cliveden campus. Cliveden, which first
opened in 1969, will close permanently aftera special focus
program on health care systems this summer.
"I guess we all have mixed feelings," said Beth Soltis,
student services coordinator in the Overseas Studies Of
fice. "It was a wonderful experience for many students, but
I'm excited about the opportunities at Oxford."
The Stanford program at Oxford is scheduled to begin in
the fall of 1984.
Although the lease on Cliveden does not run out until
December, the program will shut down after the summer.
The year-long wait will assist in the transition, as well as save
the University money.
Cliveden was an extremely expensive campus for Over
seas Studies to run. "It's a monster when it comes to heat
ing bills," said Pat Clark, the associate director of Overseas
Studies. "It's also hard to estimate expenses because the
cost of living and exchange rate are difficult to predict."
One noted feature over the years has been the summer
focus program, which brings together approximately 40
students and several Stanford faculty for an intensive 10-
week period.
"The summer program is much more intense than the
other quarters there," said Elaine Wang, a senior who spent
last fall, winter and summer in Cliveden. "But there's a
much greater, cohesion in the summer because you are
together academically as well as socially."
Last summer Political Science Prof. David Abernethy led a
program on colonialism and nationalism in the Third
World.
This summer's program, led by human biology lecturer
Dr. Count Gibson, focuses on health care delivery and
public policy. It was previously held at Cliveden in 1975 and
1980.
The program is full, but the Overseas Studies Office said
one or two openings should develop before the summer
program begins. As a prerequisite, students must take a
course this spring entitled "The U.S. and British Health
Care Systems."
One problem that has plagued Cliveden over the years is
its isolation. The summer program avoids this by having
each student spend three weeks at an "attachment" of the
National Health Services, usually at either Windsor or As
cott.
The three week attachment program immediately gets
the students involved in their work, lessening the problem
of students who use Cliveden as a base to travel around
Europe. "We don't have a commitment problem," Gibson
said.
Health care systems in the United States and Britain differ
greatly. "In Britain, there's a commitment to access and
fairness for health care," Gibson said. "Access and fair
ness" means that all British citizens receive virtually free
health care.
By contrast, he said, "20 million people in the U.S. have
no way to pay." Current changes happening will make the
situation worse, he added. "More and more people will pay
more out of their pockets," he predicted.
Despite the economic hardship Britain has faced in re
cent years, there is no movement toward reducing the
extremely expensive system. "Not even Mrs. (Margaret)
Thatcher has been able to do serious damage to a system
that's highly regarded by the middle and working classes,"
Gibson said. "However, Thatcher has opened it up a bit
toward private initiative."
Besides teaching the program, Gibson spends time doing
his own research. Two features of the British health care
system that intrigue him are Patient Participation Groups
and the Ombudsman — neither of which exists in this
country.
Gibson also has another research topic that will not ap
pear in any scholarly journals. In 1752, Prince Frederick
died at Cliveden after being hit by a tennis ball. Gibson is
searching for the autopsy report.
This summer's removal of Stanford from Cliveden, after
the University's 14-year soujourn there, will be another
thread in the complex web of Cliveden's past. It will also
mark an end of an era for the Stanford Overseas Program.
