# 'Dolly': a parade passing us by
## 
### TAHIRIH LEE 
At the end of Act I in Hello Dolly, the
musical based on Thorton Wilder's turn
of-the-century comedy The Matchmaker,
Dolly watches a parade marching past her.
She points to it as a metaphor for life,
illustrating her new commitment to par
ticipate in the sweep of the movement,
rather than stand by passively watching
while "the parade passes by."
Ram's Head production of Hello Dolly
that opened last Thursday did not always
offer the audience a chance to do this.
True, it's hard not to leei disirwiily re
moved from anything in our Olympic
sized Memorial Auditorium. Because of
the theater and the choice of show, the
spectacle presented last weekend mostly
passed in front of us. It seldom achieved
moments of wrapping up the audience
and sweeping it along in its movement.
Not that musicals have to do this neces
sarily; after all, are they not just so much
fluff displayed merely for our entertain
ment, especially nice for a Stanford stu
dent's escape from mental and even emo
tional involvement? Sometimes. Vet, here
participation is the theme of the whole
show. It sems unjust not to take it seriously
in the execution. All the major characters
sing out about how they suddenly feel ad
venture surging in their blood, how it's
finally time to break out of their protected
and/or protective shells and taste the best
of life—even if it's only for "a moment."
Stuffy, penny-grubbing old Horace
Vandergelder (Richard Gerrig) feels ripeto
go a-courtin' for a wife after all these years
because perhaps "it takes a woman" to
make a man really happy. His over
worked, under-paid employee Cornelius

Hackl (Alex Kaufman) decides he's going
to "put on his Sunday clothes" and ven
ture into New York City for one reckless
night on the town that won't end until he's
had his first kiss.
Vandergelder's prospective fiance, the
widowed Irene Malloy (Chavela Bryant)
rashly decides to snuff her career in the
(who-knows why?) nun-like millinary
business so she can be seen in public with
dashing, spend-thrift beaus. Even Ermen
garde (Valerie Christy), Vandergelder's
doll-like niece, finds the opportunity to
escape her uncle's protective grip and
elope with her beloved aspiring artist Am
brose (Marc Gimbrere).
The title itself sums it up: the show is the
extension of a hearty welcome, a greeting
shouted out to Dolly Levi (Alexandra
Coku) who is now emerging from a com
fortable but boring widow-spun coccoon
out into society. The musical is a celebra
tion of her renewed participation in life;
she's coming back in all her former glory
to her friends, admirers, favorite foods
and elegant feathered gowns to become
"benefactress of half the town!"
What makes Dolly's re-emergence spe
cial from the rest is that her outward
movement sets off a chain reaction of
magically timed events that clears the way
for the success of all the other characters'
plunges into the world. Dolly is
magical—we never doubt that she'll get
what she wants. And the others, if left to
themselves in their wild and naive efforts
to become worldly, would certainly end in
disaster. Ermengarde and Ambrose's mar
riage would erode from financial distress.
Cornelius and his side-kick Barnaby (Sam
Barker) would be jobless, even loveless,

without Dolly's instructions, imposed at
key junctures throughout the show just
like the appropriate professional cards
mystically made-to-order that Dolly keeps
snapping into unwilling but needy hands.
Dolly, by masterminding the develop
ment of all the subplot characters' rela
tionships, saves their tastings of life in the
fast lane from souring into disillusion
ment. Dolly is a big mama. She firmly
pushes all her "progeny" out into the big
world and then—interestingly—draws
them all back again at the end into her
newly feathered nest, the Vandergelder
Feed Store. The old relationships are not
broken, but strengthened. Thus, Hello
Dolly teaches us that new experiences re
ally just bring you back home. Sort of
Wizard-of-Oz-ey, no?
There is nothing more of substance to
the show as written. That's another reason
it was difficult for Friday night's produc
tion to truly absorb the audience. Hello
Dolly is a challenge to any company simply
because it is so single-minded. Any layer
ing of dimension—essential to engaging
the interest of the viewer—must largely be
accomplished by the directors and desig
ners. Failure to carve extra facets into the
production dulls whatever sparkle Dolly
might dazzle an audience with.
Ram's Head's show had some elements
that shone out brightly. Dolly was obvi
ously a showcase for Thomas Wood's pro
fessional caliber sets. Of particular note
was his Vandergelder Feed Store; it was
not only beautiful but also artistically and
thematically appropriate. Wood designed
all in traditional style—realistic box sets
fitting the gay '90s story setting. Further

more, the store's small size concentrated
activity into a confined space that nicely
contrasted with the out-of-doors, wide
open spaces into which Cornelius, Bar
naby, Ermengarde and even old Van
dergelder himself were breaking out.
Wood created the wide openness of
outdoors scenes with simply a black velvet
drop at the back of an empty stage. It
showed off the solid pastels of Cynthia
Ann Cook's neat costumes. But with re
peated use the effect grew stark and
abstract—not entirely in keeping with the
artistic realm of the show. Flies hanging
down to fill in the upper spaces or colored
lights or scenic backdrops might have just
suggested an outdoor scene without de
leting from the free feeling.
Also, the Harmonica Gardens Restau
rant interior was mature, but a bit rickety
looking for an establishment that serves
stuffed pheasant and mashed chestnuts.
One, too, there was a problem closing the
much-fiddled-with curtains of the private
dining compartments.
Music director Susan Silverman pre
sented a polished chorus with a rich, bal
anced sound (though it could have spit out
words a little more clearly at points). Luck
ily for Silverman, the chorus' talent lay in
singing, not in dancing. Choreographer
Melissa Cobb admirably overcame this
obstacle by infusing them with heavy
doses of broad, flexed movements that re
lied on the dancer's adrenalin and fiercely
smiling faces.
Cobb exploited every possible hide
and-seek ploy in the hat shop caper, in
cluding Barker's hilarious hatstand
impression—probably the funniest mo
ment in the show. Cobb orchestrated the
difficult "Waitor's Gallop" into a treat for

the eye. In the courtroom, the chorus was
arranged by height in a clever downward
sloping vector that pointed attention to
the trial at hand, the highpoint of Dolly's
role as instructor and manipulator. It was
largely from the efforts of designers
Wood, Cook and Cobb that Ram's Head's
Dolly achieved moments where parade
turned into pageant.
But, that parade. . .this was a prime
moment for both director and choreog-

rapher to carve one of those extra facets
that might have enriched the simplicity of
Dolly. The parade, that central image of
the show, needed to really seem like it was
sweeping by. It needed to be a larger,
more mobile thing. Perhaps more people;
perhaps just more movement. Admittedly,
scores of chorus marching through an au
dience is an old trick, but so is a mass of
people standing on stage with only the
outer row visible to the ground-floor vie
wer. Fanning the chorus out and up on
risers would have added more dimension
to the parade. Throughout the perform
ance, little was done with the extremities
of the stage. Chorus scenes generally
looked and felt smaller than they should
have.
Director Lauren Goldman did not bring
out enough of the bigness of Dolly's
character either. Coku's speeches and

motions were often specifically oriented
around Vandergelder—a bit too fawning
for a woman whose ostentation rings out
with dignity that is not a cover for, but a
sign of the real power behind her ability to
shape events and outcomes—namely her
subtle understanding of what human be
ings want and need from each other.
There is really a lot of meat to the role,
which is why it has been done so success
fully by Streisand and Channing.

Coku is just right for the role. She is
hearty and warm and even unusually
graceful. Still, she could have been even
more commanding and loud that she was,
her voice more weighty with age.
Coku's are probably one of the most
highly-trained pair of vocal chords to vib
ratto onaßam'sHead stage for a few years.
Her years of devotion to voice already
have and no doubt will continue to pay off.
Vet her operatic training proved an obsta
cle to belting out some of the husky, low
range passages in Dolly's repertoire.
Often Coku would hold back her natural
volubility as she negotiated the transition
range between the chesty sounds and her
more comfortable high, heady voice.
Consequently, she sounded breathless
and unsure at times. We all know Coku
could have razz-matazzed her way
through her songs with a biting edge to

her tones. Yet even though she didn't do it
consistantly, she still managed to tickle us,
and it generally felt good.
Goldman saw Vandergelder as a slight
man, in stature and power of character.
Vet it would have been more interesting if
the old money-grubber had been more of
a match for Dolly. Her plot to snatch him
was too easy. Gerrig needed to plumb the
depths of his role and show some under
layers, remnants of feeling from an earlier
time. But there was no struggle and Ger
rig's poutings and burstings showed few
emotional transitions. A few turnings-over
of the brain as Dolly's lessons hit home
would have made the ending more plausi
ble and his character funnier.
Kaufman, Barker and Leslie Darwin as
the squeling pixy Minnie Fay (Mrs. Mal
loy's equivalent of a Barnaby) were always
a delight to watch and listen to because
thev opened themselves and their exuber
ance to the viewer. All three met nicely the
range of demands of their two
dimensional roles—and seemed to have
fun doing it. Kaufman and Barker moved
together like clockwork. Bryant was too
subdued for a woman who is ready to
explode into adventure after years clois
tered in a hated millinary shop. She also
seemed afraid of her high notes, losing
flexibility and volume when entering
upper reaches of the song.
It was too easy to come away from Ram's
Head's production of Hello Dolly with a
puzzled feeling. Puzzled because clearly
we had just been witnesses to a pageant,
splendid with all the color and life that
passes before one on the grandest stages.
And despite the fine spectacle, the parade
had passed us by and we did not feel
somehow exhilerated by having partici
pated in it.
