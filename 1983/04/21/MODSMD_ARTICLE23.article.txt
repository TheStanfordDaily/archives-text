# 'Dolly': a parade passing us by
## 
### TAHIRIH LEE 
At the end of Act I in Hello Dolly, the
musical based on Thorton Wilder's turn
of-the-century comedy The Matchmaker,
Dolly watches a parade marching past her.
She points to it as a metaphor for life,
illustrating her new commitment to par
ticipate in the sweep of the movement,
rather than stand by passively watching
while "the parade passes by."
Ram's Head production of Hello Dolly
that opened last Thursday did not always
offer the audience a chance to do this.
True, it's hard not to leei disirwiily re
moved from anything in our Olympic
sized Memorial Auditorium. Because of
the theater and the choice of show, the
spectacle presented last weekend mostly
passed in front of us. It seldom achieved
moments of wrapping up the audience
and sweeping it along in its movement.
Not that musicals have to do this neces
sarily; after all, are they not just so much
fluff displayed merely for our entertain
ment, especially nice for a Stanford stu
dent's escape from mental and even emo
tional involvement? Sometimes. Vet, here
participation is the theme of the whole
show. It sems unjust not to take it seriously
in the execution. All the major characters
sing out about how they suddenly feel ad
venture surging in their blood, how it's
finally time to break out of their protected
and/or protective shells and taste the best
of life—even if it's only for "a moment."
Stuffy, penny-grubbing old Horace
Vandergelder (Richard Gerrig) feels ripeto
go a-courtin' for a wife after all these years
because perhaps "it takes a woman" to
make a man really happy. His over
worked, under-paid employee Cornelius

Hackl (Alex Kaufman) decides he's going
to "put on his Sunday clothes" and ven
ture into New York City for one reckless
night on the town that won't end until he's
had his first kiss.
Vandergelder's prospective fiance, the
widowed Irene Malloy (Chavela Bryant)
rashly decides to snuff her career in the
(who-knows why?) nun-like millinary
business so she can be seen in public with
dashing, spend-thrift beaus. Even Ermen
garde (Valerie Christy), Vandergelder's
doll-like niece, finds the opportunity to
escape her uncle's protective grip and
elope with her beloved aspiring artist Am
brose (Marc Gimbrere).
The title itself sums it up: the show is the
extension of a hearty welcome, a greeting
shouted out to Dolly Levi (Alexandra
Coku) who is now emerging from a com
fortable but boring widow-spun coccoon
out into society. The musical is a celebra
tion of her renewed participation in life;
she's coming back in all her former glory
to her friends, admirers, favorite foods
and elegant feathered gowns to become
"benefactress of half the town!"
What makes Dolly's re-emergence spe
cial from the rest is that her outward
movement sets off a chain reaction of
magically timed events that clears the way
for the success of all the other characters'
plunges into the world. Dolly is
magical—we never doubt that she'll get
what she wants. And the others, if left to
themselves in their wild and naive efforts
to become worldly, would certainly end in
disaster. Ermengarde and Ambrose's mar
riage would erode from financial distress.
Cornelius and his side-kick Barnaby (Sam
Barker) would be jobless, even loveless,

without Dolly's instructions, imposed at
key junctures throughout the show just
like the appropriate professional cards
mystically made-to-order that Dolly keeps
snapping into unwilling but needy hands.
Dolly, by masterminding the develop
ment of all the subplot characters' rela
tionships, saves their tastings of life in the
fast lane from souring into disillusion
ment. Dolly is a big mama. She firmly
pushes all her "progeny" out into the big
world and then—interestingly—draws
them all back again at the end into her
newly feathered nest, the Vandergelder
Feed Store. The old relationships are not
broken, but strengthened. Thus, Hello
Dolly teaches us that new experiences re
ally just bring you back home. Sort of
Wizard-of-Oz-ey, no?
There is nothing more of substance to
the show as written. That's another reason
it was difficult for Friday night's produc
tion to truly absorb the audience. Hello
Dolly is a challenge to any company simply
because it is so single-minded. Any layer
ing of dimension—essential to engaging
the interest of the viewer—must largely be
accomplished by the directors and desig
ners. Failure to carve extra facets into the
production dulls whatever sparkle Dolly
might dazzle an audience with.
Ram's Head's show had some elements
that shone out brightly. Dolly was obvi
ously a showcase for Thomas Wood's pro
fessional caliber sets. Of particular note
was his Vandergelder Feed Store; it was
not only beautiful but also artistically and
thematically appropriate. Wood designed
all in traditional style—realistic box sets
fitting the gay '90s story setting. Further
