# Ex-tennis star; now physics wiz
## Grad student receives Marshall Scholarship 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
When led Dempsey came to Stan
ford five years ago, he was a nation
ally ranked tennis player. But when
Dempsey leaves for England later this
year, he will not be heading for
Wimbledon. Rather, Dempsey will
head for Cambridge University to
study mathematics as Stanford's 23rd
Marshall Scholar.
"I don t think that there's so much
of a switch," Dempsey said. "I've al
ways been interested in school and
playing tennis, and eventually school
won out."
Dempsey said he was surprised
when he found out that he had been
selected for the scholarship, which
will allow him to spend two years

pens to you. The shock of getting it is
always there. I thought I was in a
good position to get the scholarship,
but it's a very chancy thing, and the
actual occurrence came as a sur
prise," he said.
Dempsey, a co-terminai student in
physics, cited his "interdisciplinary
approach" as one of the reasons he
thinks he was chosen for the schol
arship, the most prestigious
academic award offered by the
British government.
"I'm interested in many scientific
fields, particularly in trying to apply
math to new sorts of situations, like
biology or computer science. My
particular interest is in information
processing, especially information
processing having to do with hu

mans.
"The determining factor (in the
selection) could have been that it was
appropriate, that studying math at
Cambridge will be useful for me," he
explained.
Dempsey said he hopes to eventu
ally become a university professor,
continuing to work on applying math
to new fields in an effort to "put it all
together."
Since Dempsey has never been to
Europe before, he is looking forward
to "having the opportunity to bop
over to the continent and see
Europe." But he admitted to having
"some apprehension about the shift
in culture. I think it's going to be
interesting but difficult in some
ways."
