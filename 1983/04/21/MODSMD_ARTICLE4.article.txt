# McCloskey class: GPB criticized
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
A political science professor, a
member of the Guest Professorship
Board and a group of more than 20
students enrolled in Guest Prof. Paul
"Pete" McCloskey's course have ac
cused the GPB of violating McClos
key's academic freedom.
A letter signed by the 20 students
which will be delivered to the GPB
today, said they are displeased with
the amount of control the GPB exer
cised over the course and are con
cerned with problems which have
come up in the administration of the
class.
The letter stated: "We feel that the
ASSU (GPB's) 'review' of Con
gressman McCloskey's syllabus, as
signed readings and selection of
guest lecturers is an unprecedented
and intolerable act of infringement
of Congressman McCloskey's
academic freedom. . . . We find it
absurd that, for the sake of compen
sating for the 'lack of credentials' in
guest professors, a group of students
with almost no credentials justifies
itself topassjudgmentonamanwho
has received both a B.A. and J.D. de
gree from Stanford, has taught at
Stanford Law School (and) has served
as a member of the United States
Congress. . . .
"It is our opinion that the ASSU
(GPB) has failed to effectively fulfill
its administrative responsibilities . . .
if sabotage is not the case, it is our
opinion that the (GPB s) handling of
the administrative responsibilities of
Congressman McCloskey's class is
an example of gross ineptitude."
Seth Linfield, chairman of the GPB,
said the board was only following the
mandate of the ASSU Senate that the
"syllabus be academic in nature.
McCloskey agreed to every change
made in the syllabus prior to accept
ing his position."
Linfield stressed that McCloskey
was not officially a guest professor
until after the senate's final approval
of the course following the GPB's re
view of the syllabus. "We operate
under the mandate of the senate,"
he said.
David Marks, one of nine GPB
members, said he had considered
resigning from the board because of
the GPB's treatment of McCloskey.
"I'm terribly upset and embarrassed
by what has happened," he said.
Marks said he felt Linfield had
"slowed things down" in the effort to
get senate approval of the course
which did not appear in the course
schedule because it was approved
too late. He also complained that Lin
field had been negligent in failing to

have enough copies of the first sec
tion of the course readings printed.
According to Marks, the second
sec tion of the readings had also been
delayed and was delivered to the
Bookstore last Tuesday only after
McCloskey's wife located the
photo-copied packets at the bindery
and had them sent to the Bookstore.
These packets were then purchased
by the McCloskeys and distributed in
class Wednesday morning. Thurs
day's class requires reading from the
second section.
Regarding the question of
academic freedom, Marks said,
"Seth (Linfield) wanted to look at ev
erything. He sat down one weekend
with two board members and did.
We never voted. All of a sudden we
were told some stuff was good and
some wasn't.
"What's amazing is that after a few
years of higher education, Linfield
thinks he knows better than the polit
ical science department. He seems to
feel that he has some sort of god
given position to judge McCloskey's
conduct of the course."
McCloskey said, "The course syl
labus and the course were already
approved by the political science de
partment when the review of the syl
labus was begun by Linfield. I deliv
ered a box to Linfield with 20 folders
for the 20 lectures. He came back to
me and said, 'We've approved some
and we've deleted some.'
"The only things that significant
changes were made in related to
reading dealing with the Arab-Israeli
conflict. He didn't want me to use a
Shell Oil source or reference as to
certain oil consumption figures; he
didn't want me to use Chapter 4 of
Crab and Holt text (Invitation to
Struggle, Congressional Quarterly
Press); he didn't want me to use the
Kenen book (Israel's Defense Line,
Her Foes in Washington), which was
written byaformer head ofthe Israeli
lobby in Washington about his 20
years of experience; and he didn't
want the George Ball article ("The
Coming Crisis in Israeli-American Re
lations," Foreign Policy) because he
felt it was critical of the Israeli
lobby."
Linfield said that although the
Political Science Department mem
bers reviewed the syllabus, no one
actually read the course materials.
In response to McCloskey's charge
that the GPB's syllabus changes were
primarily related to the Arab-Israeli
conflict and the pro-Israeli lobby,
Linfield said, "Each and every lesson
that we reviewed was changed. The
(department) expressly gave us exc
