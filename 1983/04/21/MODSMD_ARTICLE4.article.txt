# McCloskey class: GPB criticized
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
A political science professor, a
member of the Guest Professorship
Board and a group of more than 20
students enrolled in Guest Prof. Paul
"Pete" McCloskey's course have ac
cused the GPB of violating McClos
key's academic freedom.
A letter signed by the 20 students
which will be delivered to the GPB
today, said they are displeased with
the amount of control the GPB exer
cised over the course and are con
cerned with problems which have
come up in the administration of the
class.
The letter stated: "We feel that the
ASSU (GPB's) 'review' of Con
gressman McCloskey's syllabus, as
signed readings and selection of
guest lecturers is an unprecedented
and intolerable act of infringement
of Congressman McCloskey's
academic freedom. . . . We find it
absurd that, for the sake of compen
sating for the 'lack of credentials' in
guest professors, a group of students
with almost no credentials justifies
itself topassjudgmentonamanwho
has received both a B.A. and J.D. de
gree from Stanford, has taught at
Stanford Law School (and) has served
as a member of the United States
Congress. . . .
"It is our opinion that the ASSU
(GPB) has failed to effectively fulfill
its administrative responsibilities . . .
if sabotage is not the case, it is our
opinion that the (GPB s) handling of
the administrative responsibilities of
Congressman McCloskey's class is
an example of gross ineptitude."
Seth Linfield, chairman of the GPB,
said the board was only following the
mandate of the ASSU Senate that the
"syllabus be academic in nature.
McCloskey agreed to every change
made in the syllabus prior to accept
ing his position."
Linfield stressed that McCloskey
was not officially a guest professor
until after the senate's final approval
of the course following the GPB's re
view of the syllabus. "We operate
under the mandate of the senate,"
he said.
David Marks, one of nine GPB
members, said he had considered
resigning from the board because of
the GPB's treatment of McCloskey.
"I'm terribly upset and embarrassed
by what has happened," he said.
Marks said he felt Linfield had
"slowed things down" in the effort to
get senate approval of the course
which did not appear in the course
schedule because it was approved
too late. He also complained that Lin
field had been negligent in failing to

have enough copies of the first sec
tion of the course readings printed.
According to Marks, the second
sec tion of the readings had also been
delayed and was delivered to the
Bookstore last Tuesday only after
McCloskey's wife located the
photo-copied packets at the bindery
and had them sent to the Bookstore.
These packets were then purchased
by the McCloskeys and distributed in
class Wednesday morning. Thurs
day's class requires reading from the
second section.
Regarding the question of
academic freedom, Marks said,
"Seth (Linfield) wanted to look at ev
erything. He sat down one weekend
with two board members and did.
We never voted. All of a sudden we
were told some stuff was good and
some wasn't.
"What's amazing is that after a few
years of higher education, Linfield
thinks he knows better than the polit
ical science department. He seems to
feel that he has some sort of god
given position to judge McCloskey's
conduct of the course."
McCloskey said, "The course syl
labus and the course were already
approved by the political science de
partment when the review of the syl
labus was begun by Linfield. I deliv
ered a box to Linfield with 20 folders
for the 20 lectures. He came back to
me and said, 'We've approved some
and we've deleted some.'
"The only things that significant
changes were made in related to
reading dealing with the Arab-Israeli
conflict. He didn't want me to use a
Shell Oil source or reference as to
certain oil consumption figures; he
didn't want me to use Chapter 4 of
Crab and Holt text (Invitation to
Struggle, Congressional Quarterly
Press); he didn't want me to use the
Kenen book (Israel's Defense Line,
Her Foes in Washington), which was
written byaformer head ofthe Israeli
lobby in Washington about his 20
years of experience; and he didn't
want the George Ball article ("The
Coming Crisis in Israeli-American Re
lations," Foreign Policy) because he
felt it was critical of the Israeli
lobby."
Linfield said that although the
Political Science Department mem
bers reviewed the syllabus, no one
actually read the course materials.
In response to McCloskey's charge
that the GPB's syllabus changes were
primarily related to the Arab-Israeli
conflict and the pro-Israeli lobby,
Linfield said, "Each and every lesson
that we reviewed was changed. The
(department) expressly gave us exc
lusive control over the conduct of
the course.
"We set up a select subcommittee
(composed of GPB members Nathan
Brostrom, Alan Sokel and Linfield)
which met and read through the en
tire syllabus and finally after these
procedures the subcommittee re
ported to the board and the board
ratified this."
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall said, "When the Political Sci
ence Depart men t reviewed the
McCloskey proposal, we reviewed
his qualification and separately from
that we reviewed the syllabus. When
we voted to approve the course, we
voted affirmatively on both these
matters. At no time did the depart
ment consider instructing McClos
key to alter the course because to do
that would violate his academic free
dom."
"Whether it is a plot or just ASSU
incompetence I don't know. They
have simply repeatedly violated his
academic freedom. It seems to be
bizarre. I will not again vo'e to give
department credit for an AS-1J spon
sored course without wri!:rn assur
ance from the ASSU GPB that it will
abstain from any interference in the
content or conduct of such course,"
he said.

Brostrom said the three members
of the select committee who re
viewed the syllabus divided the work
of reading the materials among
themselves. "In my section all the
information was good and pertinent.
I know that Alan (Sokel) and Seth
(Linfield) dealt more with the foreign
policy and Israeli lobby issues. The
whole committee didn't see all the
sections."
McCloskey said, "When Linfield
says publicly that McCloskey has
broken his agreements, McCloskey
has been unethical with the board
. . . I wish I could find an agreement
with the board. Linfield continually
says he is the board. He speaks for
the board and doesn't want me to
talk to the board."
McCloskey said that when he re
quested the names of the GPB mem
bers from Linfield, Linfield refused to
give them to him but did send them
to him several days later. Although
Linfield said the "names of board
members are public information,"
he said that since McCloskey sought
"to go over my head in violation of
the authority delegated to me," he
didn't feel it was appropriate to re
lease the names.
Linfield said, "He came in (to the
ASSU office) asking for the list and
then got absorbed in a conversation
with Mark (Epstein, Council of Presi
dents member). He left without the
list."

According to Epstein, the COP po
sition on the McCloskey course is
that "balance be preserved in his
course. Pete (McCloskey) had little in
the way of academic credentials and
we had to make sure the syllabus was
reviewed. We are McCloskey's em
ployer and he is our employee.
"He is being a pain in the neck over
an issue that isn't an issue. Pete is a
bit of a jerk. Little Pete's got to grow
up. We're not trying to control his
course."
In reference to the GPB review of
the course syllabus which followed
Political Science Department ap
proval of the course, Epstein said,
"It's very difficult for us to trust the
word of a department which led us
down the wrong path before with
(John) Anderson (former guest pro
fessor)."
A political science professor, a

McCloskey said, "When Linfield
says publicly that McCloskey has
broken his agreements, McCloskey
has been unethical with the board
. . . I wish I could find an agreement
with the board. Linfield continually
says he is the board. He speaks for
the board and doesn't want me to
talk to the board."
McCloskey said that when he re
quested the names of the GPB mem
bers from Linfield, Linfield refused to
give them to him but did send them
to him several days later. Although
Linfield said the "names of board
members are public information,"
he said that since McCloskey sought
"to go over my head in violation of
the authority delegated to me," he
didn't feel it was appropriate to re
lease the names.
Linfield said, "He came in (to the
ASSU office) asking for the list and
then got absorbed in a conversation
with Mark (Epstein, Council of Presi

According to Epstein, the COP po

that "balance be preserved in his

we had to make sure the syllabus was
reviewed. We are McCloskey's em

"He is being a pain in the neck over
an issue that isn't an issue. Pete is a
bit of a jerk. Little Pete's got to grow
up. We're not trying to control his
course."
In reference to the GPB review of
the course syllabus which followed
Political Science Department ap
proval of the course, Epstein said,
"It's very difficult for us to trust the
word of a department which led us
down the wrong path before with
(John) Anderson (former guest pro
fessor)."
A political science professor, a
member of the Guest Professorship
Board and a group of more than 20
students enrolled in Guest Prof. Paul
"Pete" McCloskey's course have ac
cused the GPB of violating McClos
key's academic freedom.
A letter signed by the 20 students
which will be delivered to the GPB
today, said they are displeased with
the amount of control the GPB exer
cised over the course and are con
cerned with problems which have
come up in the administration of the
class.
The letter stated: "We feel that the
ASSU (GPB's) 'review' of Con
gressman McCloskey's syllabus, as
signed readings and selection of
guest lecturers is an unprecedented
and intolerable act of infringement
of Congressman McCloskey's

Seth Linfield, chairman of the GPB,
said the board was only following the
mandate of the ASSU Senate that the
"syllabus be academic in nature.
McCloskey agreed to every change

Linfield stressed that McCloskey
was not officially a guest professor
until after the senate's final approval
of the course following the GPB's re

he said.
David Marks, one of nine GPB
members, said he had considered
resigning from the board because of
the GPB's treatment of McCloskey.
"I'm terribly upset and embarrassed
by what has happened," he said.
Marks said he felt Linfield had
"slowed things down" in the effort to
get senate approval of the course
which did not appear in the course
schedule because it was approved
too late. He also complained that Lin
field had been negligent in failing to

have enough copies of the first sec
tion of the course readings printed.
According to Marks, the second
sec tion of the readings had also been
delayed and was delivered to the
Bookstore last Tuesday only after
McCloskey's wife located the
photo-copied packets at the bindery
and had them sent to the Bookstore.
These packets were then purchased
by the McCloskeys and distributed in
class Wednesday morning. Thurs
day's class requires reading from the
second section.
Regarding the question of
academic freedom, Marks said,
"Seth (Linfield) wanted to look at ev

"What's amazing is that after a few
years of higher education, Linfield
thinks he knows better than the polit

feel that he has some sort of god
given position to judge McCloskey's
conduct of the course."
McCloskey said, "The course syl

approved by the political science de
partment when the review of the syl

ered a box to Linfield with 20 folders

years of experience; and he didn't
want the George Ball article ("The
Coming Crisis in Israeli-American Re
lations," Foreign Policy) because he
felt it was critical of the Israeli
lobby."
Linfield said that although the
Political Science Department mem
bers reviewed the syllabus, no one
actually read the course materials.
In response to McCloskey's charge
that the GPB's syllabus changes were
primarily related to the Arab-Israeli
conflict and the pro-Israeli lobby,
Linfield said, "Each and every lesson
that we reviewed was changed. The
(department) expressly gave us exc
lusive control over the conduct of
the course.
"We set up a select subcommittee
(composed of GPB members Nathan
Brostrom, Alan Sokel and Linfield)
which met and read through the en
tire syllabus and finally after these
procedures the subcommittee re
ported to the board and the board
ratified this."
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall said, "When the Political Sci
ence Depart men t reviewed the
McCloskey proposal, we reviewed
his qualification and separately from
that we reviewed the syllabus. When
we voted to approve the course, we
voted affirmatively on both these
matters. At no time did the depart
ment consider instructing McClos
key to alter the course because to do
that would violate his academic free
dom."
"Whether it is a plot or just ASSU
incompetence I don't know. They
have simply repeatedly violated his
academic freedom. It seems to be
bizarre. I will not again vo'e to give
department credit for an AS-1J spon
sored course without wri!:rn assur
ance from the ASSU GPB that it will
abstain from any interference in the
content or conduct of such course,"
he said.

Brostrom said the three members
of the select committee who re
viewed the syllabus divided the work
of reading the materials among
themselves. "In my section all the
information was good and pertinent.
I know that Alan (Sokel) and Seth
(Linfield) dealt more with the foreign

Coming Crisis in Israeli-American Re
lations," Foreign Policy) because he
felt it was critical of the Israeli
lobby."
Linfield said that although the
Political Science Department mem
bers reviewed the syllabus, no one
actually read the course materials.
In response to McCloskey's charge
that the GPB's syllabus changes were
primarily related to the Arab-Israeli
conflict and the pro-Israeli lobby,
Linfield said, "Each and every lesson
that we reviewed was changed. The
(department) expressly gave us exc
lusive control over the conduct of
the course.
"We set up a select subcommittee
(composed of GPB members Nathan
Brostrom, Alan Sokel and Linfield)
which met and read through the en
tire syllabus and finally after these
procedures the subcommittee re
ported to the board and the board
ratified this."
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall said, "When the Political Sci
ence Depart men t reviewed the
McCloskey proposal, we reviewed
his qualification and separately from
that we reviewed the syllabus. When
we voted to approve the course, we
voted affirmatively on both these
matters. At no time did the depart
ment consider instructing McClos
key to alter the course because to do
that would violate his academic free
dom."
"Whether it is a plot or just ASSU
incompetence I don't know. They
have simply repeatedly violated his
academic freedom. It seems to be
bizarre. I will not again vo'e to give
department credit for an AS-1J spon
sored course without wri!:rn assur
ance from the ASSU GPB that it will
abstain from any interference in the
content or conduct of such course,"
he said.

Brostrom said the three members
of the select committee who re
viewed the syllabus divided the work
of reading the materials among
themselves. "In my section all the
information was good and pertinent.
I know that Alan (Sokel) and Seth
(Linfield) dealt more with the foreign
policy and Israeli lobby issues. The
whole committee didn't see all the
sections."
McCloskey said, "When Linfield
says publicly that McCloskey has
broken his agreements, McCloskey
has been unethical with the board
. . . I wish I could find an agreement
with the board. Linfield continually
says he is the board. He speaks for
the board and doesn't want me to
talk to the board."
McCloskey said that when he re
quested the names of the GPB mem
bers from Linfield, Linfield refused to
give them to him but did send them
to him several days later. Although
Linfield said the "names of board
members are public information,"
he said that since McCloskey sought
"to go over my head in violation of
the authority delegated to me," he
didn't feel it was appropriate to re
lease the names.
Linfield said, "He came in (to the
ASSU office) asking for the list and
then got absorbed in a conversation
with Mark (Epstein, Council of Presi
dents member). He left without the
list."

According to Epstein, the COP po
sition on the McCloskey course is
that "balance be preserved in his
course. Pete (McCloskey) had little in
the way of academic credentials and
we had to make sure the syllabus was
reviewed. We are McCloskey's em
ployer and he is our employee.
"He is being a pain in the neck over
an issue that isn't an issue. Pete is a
bit of a jerk. Little Pete's got to grow
up. We're not trying to control his
course."
In reference to the GPB review of
the course syllabus which followed
Political Science Department ap
proval of the course, Epstein said,
"It's very difficult for us to trust the
word of a department which led us
down the wrong path before with
(John) Anderson (former guest pro
fessor)."
