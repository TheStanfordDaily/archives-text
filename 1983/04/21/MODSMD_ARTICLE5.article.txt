# Lanes not helping bike safety

The University's controversial inner campus "free
way" system does not appear to be reducing the number
of serious bicycle accidents here, according to Stanford
Police Department statistics.
Paramedics have been called for five separate Univer
sity bicycle accidents since January, according to Marty
Raymond, bicycle safety coordinator at the Department
of Public Safety. Two serious accidents occurred last
Monday alone, compared with two similar accidents in
all of winter quarter, she added.
By contrast, paramedics responded to seven bicycle
accidents between January and June ot last year.
The 6'/2-month-old bike lanes "haven't been as great a
success as we would have liked," Raymond said. She
cited lack of enforcement as the primary weakness in the
"freeway" system.
"I know they've been criticized a lot," Raymond said,
referring to the bike lanes. I think we've made people
more aware, but we don t have any way to enforce'' use
of the lane system.
Raymond stressed that campus bicycle accident statis
tics can be misleading. "From our statistics it's really
hard to tell anything," she said. "There could be up to 10
times as many accidents that aren't reported."
Dan Smith, manager of the Police Department's Spe
cial Services Unit, called the lane system "a success in
that it's a step in the right direction." He noted the
difficulties in attempting to enforce lane use "during,

say, class break at 10 or 11 o'clock."
Smith said much of the Police Department's energy is
currently devoted to motorcycle and moped control in
the inner campus, where motorized vehicles are not
permitted. The backbone of the crack-down is the Off-
Road Enforcement Unit, two policemen on motorcycles
who cruise the restricted campus area in search of vio
lators.
One of these officers, Deputy Del Bandy of the Stan
ford Police Department, warned that inner campus
motorcycle patrols will probably persist "until the end of
the year." Previous motorized trespasses into restricted
Stanford areas have cost offenders $15 to $48 in fines, he
"added.
Bandy said he issued 40 motorcycle and moped tickets
during a two-week period this spring. "Everyone's get
ting to know me out there," he said.
Motorcycles and mopeds are not the only unau
thorized motor vehicles that frequent the inner campus,
according to Bandy. "I'd like to see much greater re
stricted use of service vehicle permits in the inner part of
campus," he said. "That's an abuse of a privilege. Those
unauthorized vehicles are causing a lot of problems."
In reference to the bike lanes, Bandy said, "they've
helped a little bit. The adherence to the lanes has come
from pedestrians," he said, rather than from bikers.
"So far I really haven't seen widespread adherence to
the bike lanes," he said.

COLLISION COURSE: Student Alan Gampel lies on the ground at the South entrance to the Quad, near the History
corner, after he crashed into librarian Charlotte Derksen on Monday. According to witnesses, Gampel flipped
through the air while Derksen flew two feet up, then landed on her feet. Gampel suffered a concussion and iniured
arm. Despite the addition of bike lanes to campus last summer, accidents are still occurring.
