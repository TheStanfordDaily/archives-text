States may restrict nuclear power
Washington — In a far-reaching decision giving
state governments broad authority to restrict nuclear
power, the Supreme Court upheld yesterday a Cali
fornia law imposing a moratorium on new nuclear
plants until state officials are satisfied there is a way to
dispose of radioactive wastes.
The court unanimously rejected the claims of two
California utilities and the Reagan administration that
only the federal government, not the states, may reg
ulate nuclear power. The justices conceded that the
federal Atomic Energy Act gives control over nuclear
safety to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but
they said states may still limit or even ban nuclear

plants because of their potentially high costs.
"Congress has allowed the states to determine — as
a matter of economics — whether a nuclear plant vis
a-vis a fossil fuel plant should be built," Justice Byron
White wrote for the court, which until yesterday had
regularly rebuffed efforts to limit nuclear develop
ment.
The decision is a serious blow to the nuclear in
dustry, raising the prospect that companies wishing to
build nuclear plants may confront overlapping and
time-consuming regulatory proceedings before both
federal and state agencies.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. had warned the justices in
court papers that if they upheld California's nuclear
moratorium, their ruling would be "the death knell

for the construction and operation of new nuclear
power plants in California."
At least five states, according to the Department of
justice, have followed California's lead in holding up
new nuclear plants until it is clear that there are facil
ities for permanent disposal of nuclear wastes.
Several other states, including Alaska, Hawaii,
Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, have
adopted other restrictions on nuclear plant construc
tion.
Latin Americans discuss crises
San Salvador — The foreign ministers of all five
Central American nations met in Panama yesterday as
part of a joint initiative by Mexico, Venezuela, Col

ombia and Panama to discuss possibilities for a nego
tiated solution to the region's worsening crises.
"We believe just the fact of getting together the
Central American foreign ministers is a very positive
step," Venezuelan Foreign Minister jose Alberto
Zambrano said Tuesday night.
The United States, which is deeply involved in the
area's confrontations, was intentionally excluded
from the current initiative and has not objected.
However, President Reagan has decided to make
an unusual appearance before a joint session of Con
gress next Wednesday night to seek support for his
sagging Central American policy and attempt the
rescue of his endangered military aid package for El
