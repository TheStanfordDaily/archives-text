States may restrict nuclear power
Washington — In a far-reaching decision giving
state governments broad authority to restrict nuclear
power, the Supreme Court upheld yesterday a Cali
fornia law imposing a moratorium on new nuclear
plants until state officials are satisfied there is a way to
dispose of radioactive wastes.
The court unanimously rejected the claims of two
California utilities and the Reagan administration that
only the federal government, not the states, may reg
ulate nuclear power. The justices conceded that the
federal Atomic Energy Act gives control over nuclear
safety to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but
they said states may still limit or even ban nuclear

plants because of their potentially high costs.
"Congress has allowed the states to determine — as
a matter of economics — whether a nuclear plant vis
a-vis a fossil fuel plant should be built," Justice Byron
White wrote for the court, which until yesterday had
regularly rebuffed efforts to limit nuclear develop
ment.
The decision is a serious blow to the nuclear in
dustry, raising the prospect that companies wishing to
build nuclear plants may confront overlapping and
time-consuming regulatory proceedings before both
federal and state agencies.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. had warned the justices in
court papers that if they upheld California's nuclear
moratorium, their ruling would be "the death knell

for the construction and operation of new nuclear
power plants in California."
At least five states, according to the Department of
justice, have followed California's lead in holding up
new nuclear plants until it is clear that there are facil
ities for permanent disposal of nuclear wastes.
Several other states, including Alaska, Hawaii,
Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, have
adopted other restrictions on nuclear plant construc
tion.
Latin Americans discuss crises
San Salvador — The foreign ministers of all five
Central American nations met in Panama yesterday as
part of a joint initiative by Mexico, Venezuela, Col

ombia and Panama to discuss possibilities for a nego
tiated solution to the region's worsening crises.
"We believe just the fact of getting together the
Central American foreign ministers is a very positive
step," Venezuelan Foreign Minister jose Alberto
Zambrano said Tuesday night.
The United States, which is deeply involved in the
area's confrontations, was intentionally excluded
from the current initiative and has not objected.
However, President Reagan has decided to make
an unusual appearance before a joint session of Con
gress next Wednesday night to seek support for his
sagging Central American policy and attempt the
rescue of his endangered military aid package for El
Salvador.
Reagan was described by aides yesterday as believ
ing that only a nationally televised speech, in which
he will be appealing to the country as well as Con
gress, can rescue his $110 million aid request for the
Salvadoran military after recent House committee
votes to cut at least $50 million from it.
The aides said Reagan wanted to address a joint ses
sion because his past speeches on Central America
did not receive the television coverage he sought.
Washington-backed efforts to promote regional
peace in Central America last year, especially the
creation of a Central American Democratic Com
munity, made up of El Salvador, Honduras and Costa
Rica, were attacked by Nicaragua's revolutionary
Sandinista government as efforts to isolate and pres
sure Nicaragua rather than to find a peaceful solution
to the area's problems.
The Sandinistas' own initiative, on the other hand,
emphasized bilateral talks with neighboring Hon
duras and Costa Rica while disregarding U.S. con
cerns about Sandinista backing for revolutionaries in
El Salvador and Guatemala.
The efforts of what is called the Contadora Group
after the Panamanian resort island, where the foreign
mind Honduran support have stepped up their ac
tivities increasing fears of open warfare between
Nicaragua and Honduras.
Court rules on workers' speech
Washington — The Supreme Court ruled yester
day, 5 to 4, that public employees who complain
about their bosses or working conditions are not pro
tected by the constitutional right to free speech and
can be fired.
The case involved Sheila Myers, an assistant district
attorney in New Orleans, who was fired in 1980 after
she circulated a questionnaire among her co-workers
asking about office morale, the level of confidence in
supervisors, the need for a grievance committee and
possible pressure on workers to participate in politi
cal campaigns.
Both the U.S. District Court and the sth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals had found that Myers' constitu
tional rights were violated and orderedthatshe be re
instated with back pay and $1500 in damages.
But the Supreme Court ruled that, while the First
Amendment protects the right of public workers to
speak out on issues of public interest, it does not pro
tect a worker's right to be heard on internal office
matters.
Reagan signs Social Security bill
Washington — On a stage wrapped in red, white
and blue buot'ng President Reagan signed a bill to
ies!ore the Social Sec urily system to financial rsolven
cy yesterday and used the setting to preach a political
sermon on the benefits of bipartisan cooperation to
an audience that included many Democrats.
The president, who currently is battling with Dem
ocrats over the defense budget, the MX missile and
his Latin America policy, had fought them over Social
Security. He has accused them of making the issue a
"political football."
But yesterday Reagan struck only conciliatory
chords. He said the cooperation of Democrats and
Republicans on the Social Security bill is proof that
"our system can still work when men and women of
good will join together to make it work."
Reagan, who, shortly after taking office, whipped
up a storm of criticism with proposals to cut Social Se
curity benefits, said the compromise also "demon
strates for all time our nation's ironclad commitment
to Social Security."

French describe defense plan
Paris — France's Socialist government yesterday an
nounced a new $113 billion defense package for the
next five years that gives priority to nuclear weapons
at the expense of conventional forces.
The most controversial aspect of the 1984-1988
spending plan, the first such project to be drawn up
by the Socialists since they came to power in May
1981, is a cut in France's army of 354,000 by about
22,000 soldiers over the next five years. Plans to re
organize the armed forces have already led to a cam
paign of leaks and counterleaks in the French press
and the resignation six weeks agoof the army chief of
staff, Gen. Jean Delaunay.
French officials have acknowledged that they are
considering trimming down the 50,000 French troops
stationed in West Germany to get the manpower re
ductions called for in the plan released yesterday. No
details were given yesterday, however.
Projected cuts in the forward units stationed in
West Germany, which could be used by the North At
lantic Treaty Organization as a reserve in time of war,
have caused concern in Bonn. French officials say
they are also aware that the cuts could help fuel senti
ment in the United States to reduce American ground
troops stationed in Europe.
France is not a member of NATO's military wing.
The five-year plan normally is not subject to annual
review and once it is approved by the National As
sembly — which is expected — it will be a binding
strategic and tactical choice for France's military es
tablishment.
Oil lease moratorium proposed
Washington — Legislation imposing a 10-year
moratorium on new offshore oil and gas leasing along
most of California's coast was introduced yesterday
by U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson.
"This measure will protect one of California's most
precious resources — its coastline," the California Re
publican said. "At the same time, the bill gives as
surances that the drilling for oil and gas in areas where
there are known reserves can continue in an environ
mentally safe fashion."
The northern two-thirds of the California coast,
from Pismo Beach north to the Oregon border, al
ready is under a one-year moratorium, and the In
terior Department has recommended a year's ex
tension. Wilson's bill would extend the ban until Jan
uary 1994.
