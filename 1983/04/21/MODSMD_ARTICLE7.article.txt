## Special urban report: elections dominate the scene

Compiled from news reports and wire
services
Chicago
Chicago Democrats, fearing
that the city's bitter mayoral
election campaign soured their
chances of snaring the 1984
Democratic National Conven
tion, were on their best be
havior last weekend during a
visit by the national party's site
selection committee.
Lame-duck Mayor Jane
Byrne and Mayor-elect Harold
Washington, arch foes during
the primary and general elec
tion campaigns, acted like old
friends at a reception for the
site-selection officials at the
Hyatt Regency Hotel.
Police Superintendent
Richard Brzeszek, who once
said that downtown Chicago
streets would no longer be safe
if Washington were elected,
shook hands with Washington
at the reception and whispered
words of encouragement in his
ear.
Thomas King, a business
executive who tried briefly to
mount a general election
write-in campaign for Byrne
that would have split the
Democratic party further, in
sisted that reports of intense
racial and political strains in
Chicago have been grossly
exaggerated.
"This city is not in turmoil,"
said King, general manager of
Merchandise Mart and chair
man of a business group bid
ding for the national conven
tion.
Washington, a two-term
congressman, became the first
black to be elected mayor of
Chicago last Tuesday. He
strongly endorsed the city's $6
million convention bid and as
sured site-selection officials
that local politics would not
impede the holding of a suc
cessful convention there.
However, many members re
portedly are leaning heavily
toward San Francisco, in part
because national party chair
man Charles Manatt is a
Californian. Also bidding ag
gressively are the District of
Columbia, Detroit and New
York City.
The final vote on the site is to
be taken in Washington tomor
row.
"Obviously, there will be
some (negative) political fall
out from the Chicago elec
tion," said Peter Kelly of Con
necticut, a vice chairman of the
27-member selection commit
tee. "But I have a feeling it's
going to come together politi
cally a lot better than people
thought."
Theodis "Ted" Gay, chair
man of the D.C. Democratic
State Convention and a com
mittee member, questioned
whether there is enough time
to allay all of the political con
cerns about Chicago.

The committee delayed visit
ing Chicago until after last
Tuesday's election to give local
politicians and business lead
ers time to regroup.
Over the weekend,
national party officials ac
knowledged that San Francisco
had greatly improved its
chances of being host to the
convention by agreeing to au
gment its 1900 member force
with about 2000 suburban and
state police during the week of
the convention.
Party officials, wary of a re
peat of the violence that
marred the 1968 national con
vention in Chicago, felt that
San Francisco's own police
force was too small to protect
presidential candidates and
handle possible demonstra
tions.
Philadelphia
The choices in the upcoming
Democratic mayoral primary
here this spring are Frank
Rizzo, 62, the white ex-mayor,
and W. Wilson Goode, 44, the
black ex-city manager. Accord
ing to the latest television poll,
Goode has a 19 point lead in
the race.
On the surface, Philadelphia
bears a strong ethnic and racial
resemblance to Chicago, but
unlike Chicago's mayoral race,
.the one here is a contest be
tween two candidates doing
their level best to keep racial
passions from flaring.
"It simply isn't politically
expedient in Philadelphia to
exploit race," said Berit Lakey,
executive director of the Fel
lowship Commission, a local
civic group that recently held a
news conference at which
Rizzo and Goode pledged not
to inject race or religion into
the campaign.
Philadelphia is a typically
unmelted, big-city melting pot,
which has endured its share of
racial divisiveness in recent
years. Both campaigns take it
as a given that on May 17 the
vote will break heavily along
racial lines in a primary in
which about 44 percent of the
registered Democratic voters
are black.
But the dialogue of this cam
paign has been almost entirely
devoid of racial code words,
and the temperature of the
electorate seems as cool as
Chicago's was hot.
In a sense, Philadelphia has
already had its Chicago. It went
through a period in the late
1970s when blacks, after gen
erations of electoral slumber,
became angry about back-of
the-hand treatment from City
Hall and started registering to
vote in unprecedented num
bers.
The results have been
dramatic. In the last four years,
Philadelphia has seen its first
black city council president, its
first black school superinten
dent and its first black city

managing director (Goode)
and has elected about a dozen
new, young, independent
black legislators to the city
council and state general as
sembly.
With blacks in the political
mainstream and whites grow
ing more accustomed to the
idea of sharing political power,
a third factor has helped to
keepthe lid on in Philadelphia:
the personalities and strategies
of the candidates.
Rizzo is all personality, full of
charm and fire and eager to live
down what he considers a bum
rap as a racial polarizer.
He erupted in an explosion
at a news conference two
weeks ago in which he linked
the Rev. lesse Jackson with
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion leader Yasser Arafat and
Libyan leader Col. Muammar
Qaddafi, compared Chicago
Mayor-elect Harold Washing
ton with Al Capone and en
dorsed Republican Bernard
Epton in the Chicago mayoral
race.
Campaign aides said pri
vately that Rizzo's attack on
lackson was planned, but that
the rest of the outburst was
Rizzo on his own. lackson,
leader of a social-action group
known as Operation PUSH
(People United to Save Human
ity), had spoken in Philadel
phia the day before.
Rizzo has since restrained
his tendency to speak so boldly
— "Vintage Rizzo" headlined
the Philadelphia Daily News
after the eruption — but
strategists on both sides think
he did himself more good than
harm.
Rizzo has also begun to
hammer Coode for being No. 2
man to Mayor William Green,
who earlier this month an
nounced that the city is facing a
$99 million deficit and pro
posed modest increases in the
property, wage and business
taxes.
Rizzo also claims that since
the "Goode-Green" adminis
tration succeeded him in 1980,
crime has gone up, trash col
lection down and"the only
thing they've done on eco
nomic development is to cut
ribbons on projects I started."
Goode fires back that as
mayor, Rizzo enacted the
largest tax increases in city his
tory, and left his successor with
a hidden deficit of more than
$100 million.
San Diego
After 11 years under a popu j
lar and successful mayor, this
city is now considering which
of two candidates will lead it
next in the never-ending
struggle against becoming
another Los Angeles.
The record of former Repub
lican mayor Pete Wilson was
good enough on this issue to
help him vault to the U.S. Sen
ate, with many votes coming

even from Los Angeles, which
his San Diego constituents so
abhor as a pit of urban trouble.
Despite a 29 percent popula
tion growth to 900,000 in the
last 10 years, San Diego has
managed to maintain a blend
of parks and clean air mixed
with new high rises and wants
to keep it that way.
Under Wilson's leadership,
the city has also become a lab
oratory for new ways to cure
urban ills — for example, re
quired work for able-bodied
welfare recipients to cut fraud
and waste, trolley cars to re
duce automobile traffic and
mail ballots to increase voter
participation.
Obviously pleased with such
innovations, the city's voters in
a March primary picked two
mayoral finalists known for
their support of Wilson and his
policies.
Port commissioner and
former city council member
Maureen O'Connor, 36, and
county supervisor Roger
Hedgecock, also 36, seem re
markably alike. Both empha
size limited growth to forestall
untidy urban sprawl such as
that found in Los Angeles, and
both support strong anti-crime
measures and stimulation of
new jobs.
O'Connor is a Democrat,
and Hedgecock a Republican,
but Hedgecock has received
liberal Democratic support be
cause of his strong environ
mental record. And O'Connor
has received much Republican
support, including endorse
ment by the conservative San
Diego Union because of her

longtime political alliance with
Wilson, who has remained
neutral.
Accordingly, the race has
grown extremely close. In a
20-candidate field, O'Connor
placed first with 36.2 percentof
the vote while Hedgecock won
30.5 percent.
The latest poll published in
the Union showed Hedgecock
leading with 43 percent in a
700-voter sample, while
O'Connor had 37 percent and
20 percent were undecided.
With so little difference in
their stands on issues, O'Con
nor has taken to suggesting
that Hedgecock is too abrasive
to build the spirit of bipartisan
cooperation under which Wil
son ran the city. Hedgecock
has attacked O'Connor for
being too vague on the issues
and for depending on her hus
band's money.
Buffalo
The brightly colored map in
Mayor James Griffin's office
here provides a marked con
trast to the bleak picture of
idled plants, empty stores and
torn-up streets outside his City
Hall window.
The map traces the route of a
14-station, $500 million light
rail line, whose construction is
leaving a trail of debris along
downtown Main Street. The
map shows the subway passing
the new pedestrian mall, the
two new bank headquarters,
the new Hilton Hotel, the new
Hyatt Regency and the new
convention center — all in var
ious stages of completion.

Griffin is confident that
these projects, most of them
financed by the panoply of
federal urban aid programs,
will help revitalize this aging,
blue-collar town. But others,
including many laid-off factory
workers here, have their
doubts.
Buffalo is in the midst of a
long and painful transition
from a near-total reliance on
steel plants, auto assembly
lines and grain mills to an
emerging service, retail and
tourism center. It is an increas
ingly familiar struggle for many
older, northern cities that
gradually are losing their in
dustrial base.
Despite all the development,
Buffalo's population is shrink
ing, and at a faster rate than any
other city in the nation except
Cleveland or St. Louis, accord
ing to the 1980 census. More
than one out of five people left
town over the last decade as
the population dropped from
462,000 to 357,000. Despite the
exodus of many young work
ers, moreover, the jobless rate
has hovered stubbornly above
15 percent.
And most of the recent signs
here have been negative. The
area still has not recovered
from Bethlehem Steel's an
nouncement 'hat it will close
its sprawling Lackawanna
complex later this year, wiping
out 7300 jobs, just last week,
3000 people, some waiting
overnight in 32-degree wea
ther, lined up to apply for 200
federally-funded jobs.
Some of Griffin's critics, par
ticularly in the black commu

nity, say his focus on down
town development has
excluded many poorer resi
dential neighborhoods. City
councilman George Arthur
said that Griffin has ignored
the need for low-income hous
ing while pouring money into
downtown hotels and luxury
town houses along the Lake
Erie waterfront.
Despite the criticism, Griffin
is betting the city's future on
next year's subway opening.
Every three minutes, the plan
ners say, trains will run under
ground from the State Univer
sity of Buffalo in the city's
northwest corner, then rise
above ground as an overhead
trolley for the six downtown
stations. Rides within the
downtown zone will be free.
Bill Hanbury, who promotes
the center for the Chamber of
Commerce, said that most
travelers have come to think of
Buffalo as a way station on the
road to Niagara Falls and To
ronto. The chamber has coun
tered with a "Tafking Proud"
campaign, trying to ease Buf
falo's reputation as a cultural
wasteland by playing up local
attractions, from ski resorts to
art museums.
"You cannot deny that we
have an image problem," said
Hanbury, who blames it on the
long winters in western New
York. "But we're working on
1985 and '86 and '87 and things
look great. Without a doubt,
conventions and tourism are
the most encouraging light on
the horizon for this commu
nity."
