### JENNIFER ROSEN 
Tuesday's ugly rainy weather
appropriately drenched the
four ugliest men on Stanford's
campus Psychology Prof.
Philip Zimbardo, was voted
"The Ugly Man on Campus " in
a contest sponsored by frater
nity Alpha Phi Omega to raise
money for the Special Olym
pics at Stanford.
According to Jeff Steck, one
of the contest organizers, the
contest raised a total of
$189.26, through its penny per
vote voting process. The offi
cial slogan of the contest was
"One Penny, One Vote —
Stuffing the Ballot Box is En
couraged."
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon was first runner up,
Norman Wessells, dean of
Humanities and Sciences,
came in third, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy was
fourth and write-in candidate
)im McCrath came in last.
Wearing an all black outfit,
and gold eagles painted on his
cowboy boots, Zimbardo anxi
ously awaited his prize—an
honorary key from National
Fraternity Headquarters, en
graved: A Phi Old Ugly Man on

Campus 1983.
Although he was too embar
rassed to vote for himself,
Zimbardo said it was good to
be ugly. "It's interesting. . .be
ing ugly is something most
people worry about all of their
lives," he said. "It takes away a
long time fear I've had—rather
than wait to be found out, I got
rewarded for it. It feels good.
It's yet another fear I've con
quered," he said.
Although at the awards pre
sentation Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon told Zimbardo it
was an "honor" to be consid
ered as ugly as Zimbardo, as
mere runner-up, Hargadon said,
"I may as well be good looking."
"Professor Zimbardo de
served to win," Hargadon said.
"I know why I lost. Kennedy is
tan and ugly, Wessells is dis
tinguished and ugly, Professor
Zimbardo is bearded and ugly
and I was just plain ugly. When
it came right down to it, I just
didn't have what it took to
win."
However, Hargadon did say
it was an honor just to be ugly
enough to be in their ugly
company.

Similarly, Carol Jennings, a
co-organizer of the Stanford
Special Olympics Committee,
expressed her satisfaction with
the contest. "We really ap
preciate the generosity of this
group," she said. "So many
campus organizations have
been really helpful. I hope the
positive feelings continue, and
make this event better than
ever."
According to David Mirva,
another contest organizer, the
Ugly Man on Campus Contest
has never been at Stanford be
fore. "It's a national project of
charters at other colleges in the
country. We nominated
people who were really popu
lar, and who we thought would
attract the most votes," he
said.
According to Steck, the con
test was not meant to judge the
ugliest in appearance, but the
favorite or least favorite ad
ministrator. Steck said that
student contestants are a dis
tinct possibility for next year's
contest. He noted that James
McCrath, an ASSU senator
made it on the ballot as a
graduate student.
