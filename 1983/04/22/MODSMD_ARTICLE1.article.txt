# Churches to harbor refugees
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Two campus religious groups are
offering sanctuary to Central Ameri
can refugees who seek to avoid de
portation — even though the groups
risk violating federal law.
The Stanford Lutheran Center and
the Newman Center, the Catholic
student organization on campus, de
cided in late March to join the more
than 60 churches nationwide that
have agreed to house illegal aliens
from Central America.
The centers' members fear that
some of these refugees may be
persecuted if they are forced to re
turn to their native countries by the
Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice (INS). The centers may be risk
ing a hefty sentence by harboring the
refugees, though: individuals shel
tering undocumented aliens could
receive a maximum punishment of a
$2000 fine and five years in prison for
each illegal alien harbored.
However, an immigration official
said the INS is not particularly con
cerned about the churches' offers of
sanctuary.
"We're not too worried about it,"
said Arthur Shanks, INS deputy dis
trict director in San Francisco.
"We've got more important things to
worry about."
Immigration officials will not go
"gangbusting" into a church to
search for illegal aliens, Shanks said.
There are "plenty of illegal aliens"
for officials to arrest without search
ing churches, he said.
Father Eugene Boyle of the New
man Center said he was "not particu
larly" worried about the conse
quences of "what might be called
civil disobedience.
"I don't treat Jjl lightly by any
means," he said. But the "likelihood
of prosecution is relatively remote."
So far, no undocumented aliens
have actually been sheltered at the
centers. But the centers have helped
refugees find medical and legal as
sistance as well as other housing,
Boyle said.
Right now, undocumented immi
grants who want legal asylum in the
United States must prove that they
would face persecution if forced to
return to their native country.
Accordingto Stephen Easton, a law
student here and president of the
Newman Center Community Coun
cil, refugees from Communist coun
tries are often granted asylum by the
government. But when immigrants
flee countries whose governments
receive American support, the U.S.
government often doesn't accept
their claims of possible persecution,
he said.
Last September, an immigration
judge refused to give asylum to two
Salvadorans living in San Francisco
who claimed they might be killed it
they were deported.
Shanks admitted that it is harder
tor immigrants from countries like 11
Salvador and Guatemala to prove
their need for asylum. Most applic
ants claim their lives would be in
danger if they were to be deported,
and often that isn't true, he said.
But Boyle said deported Central
American refugees could face "al
most certain death" — or at least tor
ture and imprisonment.
The Rev. Alexander Jacobs, pastor
of the Lutheran Center, said the
churches oppose the State Depart
ment's classification of Central
American aliens "solely as economic
refugees" searching for jobs rather
than refugees escaping "the violence
in their country has driven them from
their homes."
According to Easton, the centers'
commitment to illegal actions does
not please all their members.
"I'm sure there are people in the
Newman Center . . . who aren't too
pleased with the whole business,"
he said. But Boyle and lacobs said
they had not received any negative
responses from center members.
Boyle said he doubted the
churches would have much influ
ence on the Reagan administration's
refugee policy. But the churches stiii
want to provide this "Christian,
humane service" to individual re
fugees, he said.
The churches do not primarily
seek to change immigration policy,
Jacobs said. Their main goal is not to
achieve "political impact" hut rather
to help "people in need."
Easton agreed that the churches
commitment to harbor these re
fugees is not politically motivated.
"I'm not trying to make a state
ment against the Reagan administra
tion's policy in Central America,"he
said. "Giving them sanctuary is not a
political statement against our ac
tions there."
The churches are simply trying to
help illegal aliens who might be
persecuted if they return to their na
tive countries, Easton said.

flee countries whose governments
receive American support, the U.S.
government often doesn't accept
their claims of possible persecution,
he said.
Last September, an immigration
judge refused to give asylum to two
Salvadorans living in San Francisco
who claimed they might be killed it
they were deported.
Shanks admitted that it is harder
tor immigrants from countries like 11
Salvador and Guatemala to prove
their need for asylum. Most applic
ants claim their lives would be in
danger if they were to be deported,
and often that isn't true, he said.
But Boyle said deported Central
American refugees could face "al
most certain death" — or at least tor
ture and imprisonment.
The Rev. Alexander Jacobs, pastor
of the Lutheran Center, said the
churches oppose the State Depart
ment's classification of Central
American aliens "solely as economic
refugees" searching for jobs rather
than refugees escaping "the violence
in their country has driven them from
their homes."
According to Easton, the centers'
commitment to illegal actions does
not please all their members.
"I'm sure there are people in the
Newman Center . . . who aren't too
pleased with the whole business,"
he said. But Boyle and lacobs said
they had not received any negative
responses from center members.
Boyle said he doubted the
churches would have much influ
ence on the Reagan administration's
refugee policy. But the churches stiii
want to provide this "Christian,
humane service" to individual re
fugees, he said.
The churches do not primarily
seek to change immigration policy,
Jacobs said. Their main goal is not to
achieve "political impact" hut rather
to help "people in need."
Easton agreed that the churches
commitment to harbor these re
fugees is not politically motivated.
"I'm not trying to make a state
ment against the Reagan administra
tion's policy in Central America,"he
said. "Giving them sanctuary is not a
political statement against our ac
tions there."
The churches are simply trying to
help illegal aliens who might be
persecuted if they return to their na
tive countries, Easton said.
