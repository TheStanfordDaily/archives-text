# Churches to harbor refugees
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Two campus religious groups are
offering sanctuary to Central Ameri
can refugees who seek to avoid de
portation â€” even though the groups
risk violating federal law.
The Stanford Lutheran Center and
the Newman Center, the Catholic
student organization on campus, de
cided in late March to join the more
than 60 churches nationwide that
have agreed to house illegal aliens
from Central America.
The centers' members fear that
some of these refugees may be
persecuted if they are forced to re
turn to their native countries by the
Immigration and Naturalization Ser
vice (INS). The centers may be risk
ing a hefty sentence by harboring the
refugees, though: individuals shel
tering undocumented aliens could
receive a maximum punishment of a
$2000 fine and five years in prison for
each illegal alien harbored.
However, an immigration official
said the INS is not particularly con
cerned about the churches' offers of
sanctuary.
"We're not too worried about it,"
said Arthur Shanks, INS deputy dis
trict director in San Francisco.
"We've got more important things to
worry about."
Immigration officials will not go
"gangbusting" into a church to
search for illegal aliens, Shanks said.
There are "plenty of illegal aliens"
for officials to arrest without search
ing churches, he said.
Father Eugene Boyle of the New
man Center said he was "not particu
larly" worried about the conse
quences of "what might be called
civil disobedience.
"I don't treat Jjl lightly by any
means," he said. But the "likelihood
of prosecution is relatively remote."
So far, no undocumented aliens
have actually been sheltered at the
centers. But the centers have helped
refugees find medical and legal as
sistance as well as other housing,
Boyle said.
Right now, undocumented immi
grants who want legal asylum in the
United States must prove that they
would face persecution if forced to
return to their native country.
