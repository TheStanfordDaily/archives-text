/ noticed the flower vendors of White Plaza
made a killing on Valentine's Day. My ques
tion: how much do they reimburse the Uni
versity for the following privileges: location
on campus, storage of materials at the side of
Dinkelspiel overnight, wear and tear of walk
ways by vehicles (I noticed four vehicles at
the side picking up excess flowers) and use of
Tresidder's dumpsters 112 Free enterprise is one
thing; taking advantage of a good situation is
a different matter.

Some of us might define free enterprise as
taking advantage of a good thing. But that's
neither here nor there.
Tresidder Union oversees the use of White
Plaza. The major part of that responsibility is
event scheduling — you go to Tresidder
when you want to hold a rally, concert,
speech, etc. there. Tresidder is also the agen
cy through whose largesse all the various ven
dors — the florist, the used record stand, the
clothes sellers — inhabit the Plaza. If anyone
were to charge the vendors for the space they
occupy, it would be Tresidder.
The answer to your question is: they don't.
The vendors don't reimburse the University,
that is. According to Ellie Oppenheim, direc
tor of Tresidder Union, there is a standing
policy of allowing "craftspeople" to set up in
the Plaza for free. The definition of
craftsperson hasexpanded, obviously; as well
as I can make out, it means someone who isn't
too aggressive (everyone in the Plaza quali
fies there, I'd say) and who adds to the "am
biance" of the Plaza. (That last point is pretty
subjective, but one could argue that this cam
pus needs all the human presence it can get.)
Another strong argument in favor of the
flower vendor, Oppenheim said, is that he
provides a service people want (you admit
yourself that he "made a killing") that isn't
available anywhere else on campus.
Beyond all that, I wonder about a couple of
your expense items: "wear and tear of walk
ways"? Those walkways are asphalt, after all,
and University vehicles — pickups and police
cars among them — drive over them every
day. And use of the dumpsters?
Trivia note: White Plaza was designed by
landscape architect Thomas Church, a Bay
Area Big Name. Most of his work isn't open to
the public; a nearby example of off-limits
Church landscaping is the Institute for Ad
vanced Study in Behavioral Sciences which
sits above Junipero Serra across from the lake,
beyond the sign reading "Private Road."

With regard to the recent incident at
Berkeley where U.S. Ambassador to the Unit
ed \lations Jeanne Kirkpatrick was shouted
down by student hecklers what would hap
pen if the same thing happened at Stanfordf
Does the University have any rules covering
this sort of things
A potential heckler
What would happen in such a case is any
one's guess, I suppose — it would all depend
on circumstances. The University does have
some pretty explicit rules for just this sort of
occasion. Again, I can't say how strictly they
would be enforced. But here they are.
A pamphlet entitled Regulations Govern
ing Student Conduct and Procedures for
Their Enforcement, published by the Presi
dent's office in 1981, contains among other
things the Policy on Campus Disruption, one
of the three policies (along with the Fun
damental Standard and the Honor Code)
governing student conduct. My guess is that
it dates from 1968 or thereabouts.
It begins by affirming everyone's right to
express positive or negative views about
things, then says this must be reconciled with
the need to maintain "an atmosphere con
ducive to scholarly pursuits; to preserve the
dignity and seriousness of University ceremo
nies and public exercises (a loaded provision,
that); and to respect the rights of all individ
uals." Therefore:
"It is a violation of University policy for a
member of the faculty, staff, or student body
to (1) prevent or disrupt the effective carrying
out of a University function or approved ac
tivity, such as lectures, meetings, interviews,
ceremonies, the conduct of University busi
ness in a University office (i.e., no sit-ins), and
public events (e.g., a guest speaker like
Kirkpatrick). ..
"Members of the faculty, staff, and student
body have an obligation to leave a University
building or facility when asked to do so in the
furtherance of the above regulations by a
member of the University community acting
in an official role and identifying himself as
such; (they) also have an obligation to identi
fy themselves when requested to do so by
such a member of the University community
who has reasonable grounds to believe that
the person(s) has violated section (1) or (2) of
this policy..."
The pamphlet goes on to say that these
rules have been applied to, among other
things, "preventing others from hearing a
scheduled speaker by means of shouts, inter
ruptions, or chants..."
