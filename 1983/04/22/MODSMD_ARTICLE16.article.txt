## The 						Stanford Daily ROTC: back on campus? 
### 
It is becoming increasingly clear that the
pariah status once attributed to ROTC by some
students on this campus exists no longer. Crow
ing student interest in ROTC indicates that it is
time to re-examine its relationship to the Univer
sity.
Recent tallies of ROTC programs show that
there are 39 Stanford students in the Air Force
ROTC program offered at San Jose State Univer
sity, 15 in the Navy ROTC program at UC-
Berkeley and six in the Army ROTC at the Uni
versity of Santa Clara. Enrollment has been in
creasing in each recent year.
After a long history of close cooperation with
the University, the ROTC program was "kicked
off" campus during the turmoil of the Vietnam
war era. The first step toward the removal of the
Stanford ROTC program was in 1969, when the
Faculty Senate voted to deny ROTC courses
academic credit. A student referendum that
year showed that students favored maintaining
some sort of ROTC program on campus by a
three to two margin.
In a dramatic 1970 reversal of that first deci
sion, the senate voted to restore some limited
credit to ROTC courses on a case-by-case basis
and on the approval of the Committee on Un
dergraduate Studies. This reversal caused an
uproar on campus which was led by an anti-
Vietnam war, anti-draft and anti-ROTC coalition
called the New Moratorium. Riots ensued, win
dows were broken, rocks were thrown and
rarely a day went by when ROTC did not appear
on the front pages of the Daily. Finally, a sub
sequent student referendum voted to maintain
ROTC but to deny credit. ROTC left Stanford
when it no longer found the conditions set by
the senate to be agreeable.
But the words of Bob Dylan turned out to be
very prophetic, "The times they are a changin'."
The earlier argument that ROTC should be ban
ned because it represented "institutional sup
port of U.S. militarism" seems to be the echo of

an earlier, more radical era.
It no longer makes sense to refuse the use of
University facilities to ROTC students because
their particular activity is disliked by some stu
dents and faculty. Although we support the ar
guments that were used to refuse credit to
ROTC courses, to abolish the Department of
Military Science and to ban the hiring of De
partment of Defense employees as Stanford
faculty, the continued ban of ROTC is a case of
throwing out the baby with the bath water.
The original 1 969 senate deci
sion was intended to allow ROTC on campus
only as a non-credit, extracurricular activity.
This status seems perfectly reasonable given the
multitude of groups and organizations which
are allowed to use campus facilities for any
number of religious, political or recreational
purposes. Furthermore, according to Assoc.
Registrar Bob Houghton, the University proba
bly would be willing to provide space for ROTC
classes.
Admittedly, the Department of Defense may
not wish to create a new ROTC detachment at
Stanford if the conditions are not to its liking.
But it is only fair to the students who would like
to see ROTC return that the exact conditions
under which the University would permit that
return to be spelled out.
Any return of ROTC here would have to be
circumscribed by certain explicit and funda
mental principles. No credit should be given to
courses in military science. There should be a
commitment not to schedule ROTC classes for
functions at times which would conflict with the
students' attendance at Stanford classes. Fi
nally, the Department of Defense must be pre
pared to pay the University for any use of its
facilities.
It is unfair to discriminate against students
involved in ROTC by preventing their use of
campus facilities when other autonomous
groups are allowed such space. Now is the time
to re-evaluate the status of ROTC at Stanford.
