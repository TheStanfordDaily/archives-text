# Apathy works for sexism
## 
### 
At first glance, all of the major battles seem to
have been won in the war against sexism.
Women of today have made impressive gains in
both the academic and business arenas. Al
though the opportunities open to women have
increased markedly over the past 20 years,
sexism still abounds in society today; it has
adopted forms more subtle, but no less insidi
ous.
A student arrives back at the dorm from a visit
to her doctor. Her roommate looks up from her
desk. "So what did he say?" The conversation is
unremarkable but for the fact that the student
saw a female doctor. The point here is not that
we should carefully screen our speech for such
gender references, but simply that we should
come to an understanding of the psychology of
stereotypes that underlies such assumptions.
Stereotypes which portray men as aggressive
and women as submissive have an effect on the
attitudes and behaviors of both sexes. In order
to see beyond these stereotypes, both men and
women must form an understanding of their
causes and resulting effects.
A series of rallies, lectures and workshops
dubbed "Working Against Sexism" were held
last week, sponsored by the Stanford Progres

sive, Alliance, the Women's Center and a
number of other campus organizations. The ac
tivities of the week were well organized, well
advertised and well run; the main disappoint
ment of the event was its failure to attract a
major segment of the Stanford community: the
people who don't believe or don't care that
sexism exists today, the people who perpetuate
the attitudes that lie at the root of sexism.
The 200 people who participated in the "Take
Back the Night" march deserve admiration for
their gesture of strength against the fear of rape,
but how many opinions did such a gesture
sway? Last week will undoubtedly serve to boost
the fervor of those currently working against
sexism, but how many outsiders were con
vinced of the need to combat sexism?
Last week's victory of both the Women's Cen
ter and the Students United for Rape Elimina
tion (SURE) fee assessments at the polls is a
positive step. The SURE assessment won by the
second largest margin of the 14 fee requests, a
heartening sign of student commitment to the
fight against rape.
But a fee assessment vote is an empty com
mitment unless it is followed by action.
