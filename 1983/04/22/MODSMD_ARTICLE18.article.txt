## Proposal will reduce biology lab to dull labor 
### 
In his letter (Daily, April 13, "Letter
on threat to biology lab unin
formed") Prof. Robert Simoni at
tempts to refute and ridicule a previ
ous letter by undergraduate Joe
Isner. Isner was told that he had
"compromised his objectivity in a
way that makes his contribution to
further improvements in the course
offering impossible."
Unfortunate editorial changes re
sulted in leaving out the names of
three other undergruates who
signed the letter and more impor
tantly, altered the content. The orig
inal letter stated that the Under
graduate Studies Committee (UCSC)
reviewed a proposal, and it was
changed to state that the UGSC sub
mitted the proposal. Isner has been
and continues to be one of the most
effective, competent and enthusias
tic teaching assistants.
In the aftermath of this confusion,
the reader may be left with the im
pression that there is no formal pro
posal for major changes in the biol
ogy core laboratory. To the contrary,
such a proposal was, in fact, hotly
debated in a meeting of the UCSC on
Feb. 23.
It is my understanding that not
only the undergraduates who at
tended that meeting but also others
who have read the widely circulated
proposal have interpreted it in much
the same way as the four who wrote
the Isner letter. Why did they inter
pret it as leading to the traditional
structured "cookbook" type of labo
ratory experience relegating their
participation in the teaching to that
of a minor role?
The proposal states, in marked
contrast to the current course, that:
• "The labs should be taught by
graduate student TAs, who can pro

vide both a more extensive knowl
edge of biology and a greater
breadth of laboratory experience."
Each graduate student would have an
"undergraduate assistant." (Cur
rently, the labs are taught primarily
by selected juniors and seniors who
have taken the course and therefore
have exposure to both the philoso
and content of the course. A student
survey showed an overwhelming
preference for UG TAs.)
• "Experiments might include
those whose major goal is to teach a
set of techniques or a research sys
tem. . . . Each student would be as
signed to a lab group which would
meet once a week to perform that
week's experiment." (Currently,
students design their own experi
ment —making it an experiment
rather than a mock laboratory exer
cise.)
• "The format would require that
students meet and start their exper
iments at set times. While this partial
loss of open-lab format might de
crease the students' sense of inde
pendence and self-motivation, stu
dents would gain competence and
self-confidence from the more direct
supervision that scheduled classes
permit." (Currently, the labs are
open with supervision seven days
each week.)
Laboratory courses that I have ob
served, read about or experienced
that are advertised thusly have been
structured recipe-type labs.
Moreover, even those paying lip ser
vice to an "experimental approach"
usually fail to do so in a meaningful
way. As Simoni indicated, I "de
signed and implemented" this "radi
cal departure from a traditional labo
ratory." It was not without many sig
nificant contributions from both un

dergraduate and graduate students.
The design was to allow students to
experience something of the process
of science and also having opportu
nity and encouragement for criticial
thinking and self-expression. It is my
experience that students do not
need further encouragement to pas
sivity and decreased "independence
and self-motivation" since adequate
amounts are built into the educa
tional system.
Those who do not view the propo
sal as a significant departure from the
current program apparently do not
sense what undergraduates who
have experienced the course are se
eing. Thus it is not surprising to me
that undergraduate TAs and students
are expressing concern.

True romance
Michael Weiss' column ("Ro
mance lesson at Stanford," Daily,
April 15) on "romance," as he labels
it, is a refreshing breath after a week
of "Working Against Sexism." With
Weiss we are free to remember that
women are girls and men are men,
implied differences in maturity and
character withstanding. Further, we
are allowed to return to that heyday
of the sex markets when humans
valued each other as commodities.
Weiss' attempt to help those Stan
ford men who haven't the insight,
experience and savvy that he has is
certainly a noble effort. Is there any
one who hasn't his insight, experi
ence and savvy? Perhaps the stu
dents in the library have recognized,
at some level, the absurdity of using
dates to set up artificial barriers be
tween people and then constructing

formal, degrading methods of cir
cumventing them. Perhaps they have
recognized that "romance" comes
not from forcing one another into
constricting roles, but from allowing
one another to grow, to relax and to
be one's self—one's whole self. Iron
ically, the institution of dating forces
apart precisely those people who
claim to be interested in coming to
gether. No wonder so many people
have trouble bringing themselves to
play this game.
Hopefully, Weiss has severely un
derestimated his peers. His descrip
tions of their dating habits are disturb
ing. I am sure many students engage
in much healthier, more rewarding
interactions than those he suggests.
The young man who recognizes that
a perfect time "can happen with al
most any woman" has developed an
attitude that would make any occa
sion with him a pleasure. Weiss,
however, attributes this man's suc
cess to luck. Is it not actually the re
sult of his strength, sensitivity and
self-awareness?
The stereotypical characters and
situationsdepicted do, indeed, exist.
It is to our advantage to eliminate
rather than promote many of them.
"Dates" are often unfair and restric
tive to the women and men involved
in them. We should strive instead to
have freer, more spontaneous and
more honest interactions with one
another.
To Weiss: good luck! You'll need it
if you're looking for romance. And
my sympathy to someone who thinks
that "sitting around fireplaces
somewhere with our spouses and
grandchildren" won't be as exciting
as a first date at Ramona's.

formed") Prof. Robert Simoni at
tempts to refute and ridicule a previ
ous letter by undergraduate Joe
Isner. Isner was told that he had
"compromised his objectivity in a
way that makes his contribution to
further improvements in the course
offering impossible."
Unfortunate editorial changes re
sulted in leaving out the names of
three other undergruates who
signed the letter and more impor
tantly, altered the content. The orig
inal letter stated that the Under
graduate Studies Committee (UCSC)
reviewed a proposal, and it was
changed to state that the UGSC sub
mitted the proposal. Isner has been
and continues to be one of the most
effective, competent and enthusias
tic teaching assistants.
In the aftermath of this confusion,
the reader may be left with the im
pression that there is no formal pro
posal for major changes in the biol
ogy core laboratory. To the contrary,
such a proposal was, in fact, hotly
debated in a meeting of the UCSC on
Feb. 23.
It is my understanding that not
only the undergraduates who at
tended that meeting but also others
who have read the widely circulated
proposal have interpreted it in much
the same way as the four who wrote
the Isner letter. Why did they inter
pret it as leading to the traditional
structured "cookbook" type of labo
ratory experience relegating their
participation in the teaching to that
of a minor role?
The proposal states, in marked
contrast to the current course, that:
• "The labs should be taught by
graduate student TAs, who can pro

vide both a more extensive knowl
edge of biology and a greater
breadth of laboratory experience."
Each graduate student would have an
"undergraduate assistant." (Cur
rently, the labs are taught primarily
by selected juniors and seniors who
have taken the course and therefore
have exposure to both the philoso
and content of the course. A student
survey showed an overwhelming
preference for UG TAs.)
• "Experiments might include
those whose major goal is to teach a
set of techniques or a research sys
tem. . . . Each student would be as
signed to a lab group which would
meet once a week to perform that
week's experiment." (Currently,
students design their own experi
ment —making it an experiment
rather than a mock laboratory exer
cise.)
• "The format would require that
students meet and start their exper
iments at set times. While this partial
loss of open-lab format might de
crease the students' sense of inde
pendence and self-motivation, stu
dents would gain competence and
self-confidence from the more direct
supervision that scheduled classes
permit." (Currently, the labs are
open with supervision seven days
each week.)
Laboratory courses that I have ob
served, read about or experienced
that are advertised thusly have been
structured recipe-type labs.
Moreover, even those paying lip ser
vice to an "experimental approach"
usually fail to do so in a meaningful
way. As Simoni indicated, I "de
signed and implemented" this "radi
cal departure from a traditional labo
ratory." It was not without many sig
nificant contributions from both un

dergraduate and graduate students.
The design was to allow students to
experience something of the process
of science and also having opportu
nity and encouragement for criticial
thinking and self-expression. It is my
experience that students do not
need further encouragement to pas
sivity and decreased "independence
and self-motivation" since adequate
amounts are built into the educa
tional system.
Those who do not view the propo
sal as a significant departure from the
current program apparently do not
sense what undergraduates who
have experienced the course are se
eing. Thus it is not surprising to me
that undergraduate TAs and students
are expressing concern.

True romance
Michael Weiss' column ("Ro
mance lesson at Stanford," Daily,
April 15) on "romance," as he labels
it, is a refreshing breath after a week
of "Working Against Sexism." With
Weiss we are free to remember that
women are girls and men are men,
implied differences in maturity and
character withstanding. Further, we
are allowed to return to that heyday
of the sex markets when humans
valued each other as commodities.
Weiss' attempt to help those Stan
ford men who haven't the insight,
experience and savvy that he has is
certainly a noble effort. Is there any
one who hasn't his insight, experi
ence and savvy? Perhaps the stu
dents in the library have recognized,
at some level, the absurdity of using
dates to set up artificial barriers be
tween people and then constructing

formal, degrading methods of cir
cumventing them. Perhaps they have
recognized that "romance" comes
not from forcing one another into
constricting roles, but from allowing
one another to grow, to relax and to
be one's self—one's whole self. Iron
ically, the institution of dating forces
apart precisely those people who
claim to be interested in coming to
gether. No wonder so many people
have trouble bringing themselves to
play this game.
Hopefully, Weiss has severely un
derestimated his peers. His descrip
tions of their dating habits are disturb
ing. I am sure many students engage
in much healthier, more rewarding
interactions than those he suggests.
The young man who recognizes that
a perfect time "can happen with al
most any woman" has developed an
attitude that would make any occa
sion with him a pleasure. Weiss,
however, attributes this man's suc
cess to luck. Is it not actually the re
sult of his strength, sensitivity and
self-awareness?
The stereotypical characters and
situationsdepicted do, indeed, exist.
It is to our advantage to eliminate
rather than promote many of them.
"Dates" are often unfair and restric
tive to the women and men involved
in them. We should strive instead to
have freer, more spontaneous and
more honest interactions with one
another.
To Weiss: good luck! You'll need it
if you're looking for romance. And
my sympathy to someone who thinks
that "sitting around fireplaces
somewhere with our spouses and
grandchildren" won't be as exciting
as a first date at Ramona's.
