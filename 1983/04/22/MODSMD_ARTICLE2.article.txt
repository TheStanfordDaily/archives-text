An unidentified child gets his first taste of the Stanford experience as he watches (from left to right) junior
Ted Shaikewitz, freshman Chris Brown, Scott Cosgrove and freshman Elliott Robinson scale the wall of
the Outer Quad. Shaikewitz, who conceded that Robinson was the best climber in the Â£roup, proudly
announced that he climbs every day and prefers climbing walls "for real" rather than just in his mind. The
child had no comment on the spectacle, despite Shaikewitz's offer to train him in the sport.
