# Drug laws need clear thought
## 
### 
With so little control over our ex
ternal world, the idea of laws that
control our internal worlds seems in
sulting to our abilities for deciding
how our personal lives can be con
ducted. Laws about drugs or suicide
(not to mention increasing literary
censorship in some conservative
communities) represent a parody for
some people about the nature of pri
vate freedom in the United States.
To concentrate on recreational
drug use, it is obvious that accurate
educational programs — and I don't
mean the rhetorical films we've all
seen portraying sub-humans foam
ing at the mouth in gutters — and
objective programs accomplish
more than any kind of suppression.
Uneducated users and quick-to
stereotype, uneducated nonusers
are both unfortunate. The current
"hide it" attitude will perpetuate the
ignorance over the pros and cons of
chemicals.
Informed experimental usage is far
less ominous (indeed, not ominous
in the least) as opposed to the kids
hiding in bushes, goo-goo eyed
about this mysterious thing that has
fallen into their hands accidently or
through some equally uninformed
older friend. Countless "bad trips"
could have been prevented by an
understanding of the rules for using
hallucinogens; a number of deaths
from suffocation could have been
prevented when glue-sniffing was
popular, if only the public was not
told, inaccurately, that the drug was
lethal, but instead instructed not to
put glue-filled bags over their heads;
this society might have fewer broken
homes, if marijuana was understood
and accepted as a substitute for al
cohol (though this is not to say
marijuana can't be abused); and
even here, as the University ad minis

tration puts its foot down on
marijuanaand cocaine dealing, some
students looking for a break from
their lives (or more life) turn to the
new MDA, a synthetic amphetamine,
or psilosybin, the poison in some
mushrooms, both of which are more
consequential drugs than pot or
even coke, but MDA and mush
rooms don't attract the public eye as
much and so are ignored.
Many people are dissatisfied with
justifications for the illegalization of
drugs on the grounds that those laws
are forthe protection of the potential
user. Our society has alcohol avail
able in every neighborhood but not
marijuana, which by the large major
ity of accounts is far less addicting
and far less harmful physically. This
society is controlled by corporations
that would never permit their prod
ucts to disappear from the shelves of
our stores. By the same capitalist
pressure, marijuana is kept off the
shelves in some places by the power
of illicit operations.
In Dade County, Florida, for
example, a large percentage of in
come comes from the illegal trade of
coke and pot. Less so now than a few
years earlier, drug merchants own
Miami, overloadingits profuse banks
with money, and such organizations
would hate to see their product on
store shelves with realistic margins of
profit from legitimate competition.
Rather than 20 to 40 dollars, a pack of
"Benson and Hedges — Cannibus"
might be only one to five dollars. And
what is California's largest cash crop?
Not too unexpectedly, marijuana.
The billions generated from an illicit
trade here keep growers satisfied
with the status-quo — an illegal
trade.
Anyone would be foolish to say
there are never tragic consequences
to the misuse of various drugs. There
are college students in all kinds of
drug rehabilitation centers and
others who have had to leave even
Stanford from the debts their de-

pendencies left them with. Brilliant
people bored with normality be
come best friends with chemicals to
escape and their legends leave us
with a dismay over their drugs rather
then empathy for their loneliness.
Freud wrote articles advocating
cocaine and was one of the last to
criticize it after the evidence against
it from the long term effects of con
tinuous usage pointed to that drug's
danger. But those who prefer it will
find it, they just have to work harder
and pay more money, turninga phys
ical problem into a financial one. LSD
was used for a long time in
psychotherapy for its disinhibiting
effect on the subconscious anxieties,
but "bad trips" from misusage led to
fear and its illegalization. Now use of
LSD is extremely hazardous because
of uncertainty about its source and
its quality, instead of the pure prod
ucts made by the previously legiti
mate laboratories such as Sandoz.
A 1977 publication by Consumer
Reports warns of such effects result
ing from illegalization and misinfor
mation about recreational drugs.
Users become dependent on crimi
nals, and communities associate il
licit drugs with the guns they see on
T.V. news reports of drug busts. And
drug busts are only the ineffectual
attempts of well meaning people
who can try to make the trade disap
pear from their communities but
only succeed in pushing it some
where else. It is entirely possible that
the future will look down on the
twentieth century's logic as we look
down on the prohibition of the '305.-
I do not intend to tell anyone to
take any drugs, but I would never
dare to write a law to keep people
from making mature decisions about
their bodies, about figuring out what
other possibilities our minds have.
