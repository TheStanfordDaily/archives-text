## Varying penalties, problems for Honor Code violators 
### MARY CATHERINE FISH (Last in a two-part series) 
The Honor Code — and what
constitutes a violation of that
code — has recently sparked
campus-wide debate. Yet
examples of Honor Code viola
tions are seldom available to
the public. As a result, much of
the debate is centered around
unknowns.
The Office of Student Affairs
recently released several case
histories to the Daily. The fol
lowing case summaries — the
names withheld — illustrate
how the University's rules gov
erning student conduct are in
terpreted and enforced. Three
involve Honor Code viola
tions, one was a Fundamental
Standard violation and one
was brought up under the Pol
icy on Campus Destruction.
Case 1
A computer program
When students think of un
permitted aid or collaboration,
exams and problem sets —
rather than computer pro
grams— usually come to mind.
In Computer Science 106 (In
troduction to Computing), a
student was suspended for a
quarter and given a no-credit
grade for copying a program
from another student's file and
submitting it as original work.
The Dean of Student Affairs
reviewed this case, and the vio
lator later requested that the
president review his case.
The student argued that the
penalty he received was overly
harsh, claiming that copying
and file entering were com
monplace occurences.
With the help of manage
ment at LOTS, a friend of the
student electronically sur
veyed student files at LOTS.
After examining an 86 percent
sample, it was found that
around 12 percent of the files
contained programs that were
semantically identical to pro
grams in other files.
James Lyons, dean of Stu
dent Affairs currently on sab
batical, did not accept this ar
gument, and said, "The fact
that some students may honor
the Code in the breach does
not relieve other students from
the responsibility to honor it in
letter and spirit. Indeed, the
regulations of the Honor Code
are such that (the student)
could be asked why he did not
do his share to take an active
part in seeing to it that others
as well as himself uphold the
letter and spirit of the Honor
Code.

Case 2
A chemistry midterm
The previous case was han
dled by the Dean of Student
Affairs by choice of the stu
dent. But every student has the
right to have his case heard by
the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC), a group of adminis
trators, professors and stu
dents, if he so chooses. This
does not happen very often —
14 cases have been tried by the
SJC in the last 10 years. One of
those 14 cases follows.
After regrading a group of
midterms, the professor sus
pected that six people had
made changes before resub
mitting their tests. As an exper
iment, he made Xerox copies
of these students' next exam.
As before, the students sub
mitted them for regrade. This
time, alterations were proven
by comparison with the Xerox
copies.
When the students came be
fore the SJC, they formed their
defense by questioning the
propriety of the professors's
actions. Thus, the matter of
faculty Honor Code violations
was brought before the SJC.
Since faculty Honor Code
violations are not under the
jurisdiction of the SJC, the
issueof faculty violations rarely
comes before that body.
Rather, they must go through
academic grievance proceed
ing. As a result of this particular
hearing on student conduct,
the SJC had the opportunity to
clarify several matters regard
ing faculty conduct.
The students suggested that
the Xeroxing could fall within
the realm of "proctoring,"
"entrapment" or "unusual and
unreasonable precaution" —
all of which are explicitly for
bidden by the Honor Code.
The SJC rejected all of these
contentions. According to the
SJC, proctoringdid not happen
because it would necessarily
mean presence of the instruc
tor; entrapment would have to
in some way lure someone to
commit an offense; and the
proof of cheating was judged
reasonable because the Code
allows instructors to "take
measures by which the original
work may be clearly iden
tified."
Two students were sus
pended and given no-credit
grades in this case. It was im
portant because it brought to
light a tricky point in the Code.
Students are not to engage in
dishonesty, according to the
Fundamental Standard, a set of
broad regulations which serves
as an umbrella to the Honor

Code.
Offenses over and above
Honor Code violations are usu
ally charged as violations of the
Fundamental Standard.
Case 3
A fake letter
The violation was forgery.
This student authored a letter
of recommendation and
signed a Teaching Assistant's
name to it. Using the letter in
support of his application to
Harvard Law School, he also
led Harvard to believe that the
TA was a professor.
Furthermore, when Harvard
questioned the letter the stu
dent tried to cover it up. He
convinced the TA that he had
indeed signed the letter but
forgotten. When the law
school sent the letter to the TA
for verification, the student
confessed to Harvard and Stan
ford officials. All other law
schools the student applied to
were notified of the offense.
The judgment came shortly
after the student graduated,
but the suspension and a for
mal censure in addition will be
a permanent part of his record,
possibly drawing censure for
the rest of his life.
For example, in two unre
lated instances, Stanford law
students used false grade
sheets when applying for jobs
with law firms. Not only did
each end up receiving one
semester suspension from the
law school, but they have since
been denied access to the bar
because of their actions.
Case 4
Disruption
In addition to the Funda
mental Standard and the
Honor Code, a Policy on Cam
pus Disruption exists within
student conduct regulations. A
precedent-setting case that
went before the SJC proved
that this policy is not to be
taken lightly.
The manager and drum
major of the Band were
charged for an incident when
the Band went merrily per
forming through Meyer Li
brary.
The SJC unquestionably af
firmed the right to peace and
quiet in Meyer Library. The two
charged members were put on
probation and were instructed
to work with the dean of stu
dent affairs to make sure that in
the future it remains well un
derstood that Meyer is off
limits for Band concerts.
"Exhibitions of musical abil

ity, theatrical talent,
mountain-climbing prowess,
and simple displays of imma
ture behavior have been all too
commonplace in Meyer," the
decision said. "Bui they simply
do not belong there."
The cases just cited all re
sulted in imposed penalties. As
is to be expected, charges are
sometimes dropped. How
ever, this only took place 10
times in the last 10 years.
According to the office of the
dean of student affairs, a
charge is not filed unless the
evidence presented is substan
tial. Some form of hard evi
dence is almost always re
quired to back up an accusa
tion.
A complaint was filed against
a student who didn't footnote
ASSU lecture notes on a
human biology exam. No
charges were filed because a
distinction was drawn between
"poor and hasty scholarship"
and "knowingly submitting as
your own the work of
another."
A student told the Daily of a
time he was reported by
another student who thought
he was looking at someone
else's paper during a calculus
examination. There was no
correlation between the
exams, so charges were never
filed.
Even though charges weren't
filed, the student endured
some inconvenience and anxi
ety because of the accusation
of his classmate. He received a
"grade not reported," which
was his first clue that anyone
had accused him of anything.
Letters informing him of the
complaint were sent to another
student with an identical
name.
The complaint was taken to
the teacher before the Dean of
Student Affairs. The student
received what he called "a lec
ture" from the instructor even
though there was no real evi
dence against him. In fact, his
paper was a"B"and the one he
was accused of copying from
was a "D". He said the teacher
made him feel like "scum of
the earth."
Asked procedure
in general, ne replied, "I
thought it was good. They're
going to be reasonably sure
you're guilty before they press
charges."
