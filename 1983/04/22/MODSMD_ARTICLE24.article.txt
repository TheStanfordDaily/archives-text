## ONCOCIN : doctors' new colleague takes no coffee breaks 
### ALEX TARG 
A new kind of doctor has been making the
rounds of Stanford Hospital's cancer unit
lately. The doctor works as a consultant and
is sought after at all hours of day and night
for decades of medical experience, infallible
memory, and encyclopedic knowledge of
diseases, symptoms and treatments. This
prodigy is named ONCOCIN and the doctor
is a computer.
ONCOCIN is an experimental computer
system which helps watch over thirty pa
tients suffering from Hodgkin's Disease and
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Medical doc
tors feed ONCOCIN reports on a patient's
progress, and it analyzes the new data to
determine what the next step in treatment
should be. It then draws on its memory and
322 logical rules of diagnoses to generate a
print-out describing an optimal treatment
program based on the patient's updated
status.
This type of analysis is difficult for a person
to carry out without the aid of ONCOCIN
because the efficiency of treatment relies
upon subtle changes in chemotherapy and
x-ray exposure which are designed to kill
cancers while minimizing ill effects to the
healthy portions of the patient's body.
Treatments cannot be thoroughly worked
out ahead of time. Future drug and radiation
dosages should be derived from past reac

tions to therapy and are not governed by
hard and fast rules.
Busy physicians in a ward typically use
many different complex patient treatment
programs, known as protocols. Each pro
tocol is over 50 pages long and the details of
an individual patient's case can easily be for
gotten. ONCOCIN not only suggests treat
ments but is also capable of explaining its
reasoning step by step when asked.
ONCOCIN is a product of the Stanford
University Medical Experimental
Computer-Artificial Intelligence in Medicine
(SUMEX-AIM) facility located at the Medical
School. Two huge interlocking computer
systems, one at Rutgers University and the
other nestled beneath the Medical School
are the primary workhorses of the facility.
The SUMEX-AIM research program runs on
an annual budget of over 1.5 million dollars,
according to project director Dr. Edward Pat
terman.
According to Patterman, "SUMEX is the
only center of its kind in the world and virtu
ally all major advances in the field of com
puter assisted diagnoses have been made
here."
The SUMEX programs are called "expert
systems." The name is derived from the pro
grams,' use of rules gleaned directly from
studies of professional experts' thought

processes and tactics used in solving prob
lems, said Patterman.
The facility got its start in 1974 under
loshua Lederberg and has been expanding
ever since in response to the growing need
for computers in medicine. Patterman ex
plains this trend as a symptom of "the
amount of information practicing physicians
need to confront each day is so large that
computers are needed to analyze and access
it. We get about six calls each day from
M.D.'s around the world seeking aid from
the SUMEX facility. There is a great deal of
information out there which needs to be put
together and made sense of."

Miriam Bischott, chief programmer of the
ONCOCIN project describes the program as
focusing on human engineering, a special
effort to make the programs easy to use. This
is accomplished partly by having ONCOCIN
display facsimiles of the data forms which
therapists filled out before ONCOCIN was
developed. Because of this feature,
therapists still enter data in a familiar man
ner.
According to Bischoff, one of the great
advantages that ONCOCIN has over older
computer programs of a 'book keeping'
variety which act as electronic libraries or
passive storehouses of information is that it

can create solutions to therapeutic prob
lems even when insufficient data is given to
rigorously justify them. It does this through
educated guesswork, in the same way that a
good physician might.
According to Dr. Edward Shortliffe who
holds both a Ph.D. in mecial information
sciences and an M.D. from Stanford, SUMEX
programs work with "uncertainty factors."
These factors yield recommendations to
physicians that avoid simplistic black-and
white terms in favor of various shades of
gray. The programs are designed to take into
account all available evidence that might
either buttress or cast doubt upon the valid
ity of a given medical hypothesis.
The physician can question the computer
as to exactly how and why it weighted the
evidence as it did to reach its conclusions.
When a patient's well-being hinges on a cor
rect diagnoses, such explanatory features
make the program a more valuable tool be
cause the physician can be certain that the
diagnosis is a reasonable one and not a re
sult of any "bugs" in the computer program.
Patterman said that physician response to
the system has been good, and since it was
designed as a flexible tool, it is easy to
change and improve it in the future. How
ever, Dr. ONCOCIN still has yet to develop a
taste for golf.
