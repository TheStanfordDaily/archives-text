# Patents piling up for electrical engineers

As the electronic equivalent of the
industrial revolution continues, the
Electrical Engineering Department is
earning its fame and perhaps fortune
through electronic technology re
search.
Stanford doesn't simply make a dis
covery and publish the results. A real
effort is made to realize a gain on the
research. Last year, Stanford grossed
2.52 million dollars in revenue from
licenses, patents, inventions and ideas
conceived of either entirely or partially
by Stanford researchers, according to
Neils Reimers, director of the Office of
Technology Licensing. "Every other day
a new discovery is made here, and we
direct our efforts to the licensing of
those discoveries," Reimer said.
The Electrical Engineering Depart
ment here is ranked in the top three
nationally, along with M.I.T. and Cal
Tech. "There is certainly a lot of activity
from the E.E. (Electrical Engineering)
Department," said Lisa Kuuttila, con
sultant in the Office of Technology
Licensing. "They're responsible for
several discoveries a month, ranging
from specific processes to fully devel
oped products. Most of the work, how
ever, needs further development be

fore it will be commercially profitable."
Faster and more efficient telephone
and satellite communications, sophis
ticated heating/cooling mechanisms for
circuits, and chips capable of holding
many times more bits of information
are a few of the advances being made
here.
However, the Electrical Engineering
Department is not without competi
tion in the technology race. "They have
to run fast to keep up with industry,
expecially in the field of Silicon
technology," Reimers said.
"In certain fields, like theoretical
physics, the breakthroughs have to
come from universities because few
companies will spend money on it,"
Reimers said. "But in electrical en
gineering they're plowing the same
ground industry is plowing."
Stanford does, however, have some
advantages over industry. "Having the
Medical School on campus encourages
contact with the Engineering School,
and facilitates development of medical
technology," Reimers said. "Industry
doesn't have patients." In this regard,
Stanford has an advantage over some
universities as well — many university
medical schools are located in cities far
from campus in order to attract more
patients.

But Stanford is not necessarily com
peting with industry in all cases. A
prime example is the Center for Inte
grated Systems (CIS) currently under
construction. CIS is being funded
mainly by a group of 19 industrial spon
sors, "that understand the need for
basic research in semiconductors, and
the need to educate people in this new
technology," according to Dr. James
Gibbons, professor of electrical en
gineering and director of the executive
committee of CIS.
When a researcher does win the
technology race, it can be very profit
able for the researcher's school and
department, as well as for the re
searcher. "Our current policy is for the
Office of Technology to take 15 percent
off of the revenue to cover administra
tive expenses, and add to that any out
of-pocket expenses, such as licensing
fees, which are usually minimal,"
Reimers said." After that, what's left is
divided into thirds — one-third each to
the researcher, the researcher's
school, and the researcher's depart
ment."
So not only the Electrical Engineering
Department and the researcher reap
the benefits, but the Engineering
School profits as well.
