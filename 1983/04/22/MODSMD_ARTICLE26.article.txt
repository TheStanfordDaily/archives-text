# Catheter aids medical work
## 
### PHYLLIS BURTON 
One of the less known but
important recent advances in
medical scienceis the Hickman
Catheter. The Hickman Cathe
ter is an "in-dwelling" (stays in
place for a period of time) flex
ible tube made of silicone rub
ber that is inserted into the pa
tient through the external jugu
lar veins into the right atrium of
the heart.
This tube allows a patient to
receive chemotherapy (anti
cancer drugs), antibiotics and
other drugs, as well as blood
products.
The catheter is also used for
drawing blood for blood tests
and for monitoring Central
Venous Pressure, a useful indi
cation of the adequacy of
cardio-vascular functioning.
The Hickman Catheter was
researched and developed
under the direction of Robert
Hickman, a clinical professor
of medicine at the Fred Hutch
inson Cancer Research Center
in Seattle, Washington. The
Hickman Catheter has been
used at the Stanford Hospital
since 1 979, mostly for
Leukemia patients.
Patients undergoing
chemotherapy must have an

intravenous needle inserted
into their veins for administra
tion of the drugs as often as
several times per day in some
cases. Frequently these pa
tients need blood transfusions
as well.
Both the chemotherapy and
the blood transfusions can be
given through the Hickman,
saving the patient and his veins
the trauma of multiple needle
insertions.
During treatment it is impor
tant to monitor the patient's
blood counts to asses the ef
fectiveness of the therapy or
discover imbalances. This
means at least one, and usually
several, "sticks" per day to
draw blood from the patient's
veins. Blood can easily be
drawn from the Hickman
Catheter.
This is testimony to the con
venience of the Hickman
Catheter, for the patient, and
for the staff as well. Many pa
tients are even able to be dis
connected from the running
intravenous solution for
periods between medications,
etc. during the less acute pha
ses of their treatment.
Most patients are discharged
from the Hospital with the

Hickman still in place, after
having been taught by the
nursing staff how to take care
of it themselves.
Occasionally the catheter
will become infected. This is
usually discovered when
changing the dressing and
finding the exit site red and
swollen; the patient usually
will have a fever. The catheter
must then be removed (a sim
ple, and virtually painless pro
cedure) and the patient given
antibiotic therapy.
On rare occasion the cathe
ter will "clot off," that is, it
forms a clot inside which
blocks it and renders it unus
able. If de-clotting attampts by
the nurse or physician fail, the
catheter must then be re
moved.
At times, the catheter will
break, or become cut during
use. In this case the line is im
mediately clamped (pinched
off) to prevent air from flowing
in, until the catheter can be re
paired or removed.
As its use continues to pro
liferate, and standards of care
are refined, the Hickman
Catheter is becoming another
routine tool of modern medi
cal science.
