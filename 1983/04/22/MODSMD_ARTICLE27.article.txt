## Too swept away by mystique of war: Page's 'Nam' 
### Tim Page's Nam By Tim Page A.E. Knopf $14. 95 Robert Woolsey 
More than any other type of
documentary work, war
photos tend to speak for them
selves. Their content is as di
verse as the body of photo
graphers who were compelled
to record them, yet they seem
to speak a common, despairing
message of violation from the
perverse intrusion of war. Even
at its lightest moments, Tim
Page's collection strays little
from this norm (and one hardly
can expect that it would not),
but that hardly makes it an av
erage book because its author
is far from ordinary, or perhaps
was too stoned to let the war
bother him.
Where the Gl went, Page
went; and though the war pho
tographer is hardy by defini
tion, of the few who went as
deep into the conflict as did
Page, only a handfull escaped
earning an MIA or KIA. If any
thing, Page's book is unique
because its author is alive.
A revival of interest in Page's
work was brought on in 1977 by
the publication of Michael
Herr's Dispatches, one of the
first important books to
emerge from a journalist in
Viet Nam. A good friend of
Page, Herr collaborated on
Apocalypse Now, creating the
slightly crazed upstream jour
nalist with Page in mind. For
Time/Life, however, "slightly
crazed" was not a desirable
state for its employees and,
though they paid him hand
somely for freelance, Page
never was given a position on
the staff. Consequently, the
tendency,at leaston my part, is
to greet Page's photos in a
somewhat "mythologized"
manner (as Page put it), in re
sponse to the film and his role
in Dispatch. The brief, care
fully sculpted text accompany
ing each section of the book
heightens the "mythology"
rather than hurts it, and Page's
infatuation with the "glamour
of war" — his seduction by the
helicopters, the heat, the
paranoia, and the risk — is
rendered all too clear.
Some of Page's best pictures
are of helicopters; they were
"the taxicab of the war." The
first section of Nam is called
"Chopper Blitzkrieg," and
from these few shots alone one
gets a feeling of their over
whelming presence. The ac
companying copy is a weird
pidgin of militarese and slang
— a sort of lack Kerouac
stream-of-thought fragmented

by the motion and noise. Most
of it doesn't make sense, but
Page only wants us to feel the
confusion and sense the disre
spect for life harbored in the
gutof a machine. Rationale was
confined to the noise and
surge and firepower of the
helicopter and little else when
on board, and there was prob
ably never a more comforting
roar for the Gl on the ground.
The next two sections, "Por
traits" and"The Mechanics",
seem sober in comparison to
"Blitzkrieg." Page turns his
lens here on the individual —
the Gl specifically. In his early
twenties and British, Page had
all the makings for a good rap
port with just about anybody,
but his maniacally cavalier be
havior the Gl's especially could
appreciate. "There's an
airstrike lookingforyou, Page"
many of the faces in "Portraits"
seem to be saying. Neverthe
less, the title page of this see

tion holds the most intriguing
picture in the collection.
With Kurtz's reading of "The
Hollow Men" in Apocalypse
Now still ringing in the back of
our minds, it is alarming to see
eyes so full of depth and pur-

pose staring out of the unmis
takably savage countenance of
CI. The effect is partially from
the color of his skin and the tall
grass in which he is seated,

partly from the sweat on his
forehead, and partly from the
pipe full of Cambodian Red
which rests lightly in his
mouth. Page was quick to say
that the widely available weed
and opium were half the fun

and most of the solace respec
tively. In any case, this and
many of the photos in "Por
traits" and "Mechanics"
(Page's metaphorical term for

infantry, incidentally) are
strong, but not quite Capra,
and the writing through the
remaining sections never gets
as good.
"Loud and insane" is the
point Page strives for in "Rock
and Roll Flash," and it consis
tently eludes him in spite of ef
forts to collapse the "being"
that was AFRVN (Armed Forces
Radio Vietnam) onto the
printed page by scrambling
bits of nostalgic news items
and then peppering the con
coction with strains of Hen
drix, the Dead, and the Doors.
The concept is interesting, but
probably more suited to film.
The pictures, by in large, are as
ineffective and, at best, show
how uncomfortable the idea
alone of entertainment was
under the circumstances, es
pecially the USO shows. The
message is not lost on us
though — rock, like drugs, was
needed badly by some Gls —
and, as William Shawcross tells

in the introduction, the sixties
beat lingers on today in Saigon
where its influence was gre
test.
In "Sufferings" Page focuses
on the other half, the depreda
tion and pain, in cennection
with the American presence in
Vietnam. Unlike the preceed
ing section, 'C.V. of Carriers,"
where his pictures of the men
and planes of the Navy are
powerful both in the images
themselves and the suggestion
of precision, pride and ignor
ance of the devastation ashore,
Page seems to be out of his de
partment. Three pictures stand
out while the remainder are
somehow distracted — a little
too documentary and distant
— as if he was not as willing to

get as intimate with suffering as
with the erotic mystique of
helicopter warfare.
Even his own wounds he
treated lightly (he was
wounded several times, twice
severely) as he gladly accepted
bonus pay, a "hero's wel
come " and then returned to
the "acid madness." The be
havior, naturally, earned for
Page some rather inadvertant
photographer's prestige from
those with less daring, but the
resulting sythesis of his actions
with his photographs in Nam is
hardly prestigious. In fact, the
greatest weakness of the book
seems to be that it mocks the
Gl, the draftee, the "poor
whites and blacks plucked
from the ignorant and often
innocent island of America's
heart," and even the Viet
namese — anyone who had to
be there didn't want to be. As
Herr tells it, 'Vietnam was what
we had instead of happy child
hoods," and photography was
their ticket to all the fun as
much as it was an important
offshoot of their presence in
the war.
In the final section of the
book, "The Dao of Peace,"
Page does "step back from in
sanity'' in both the text and the
photography in his epilogue
about the religious sanctuary
on the island of Phoung.
Throughout the conflict it re
mained untouched despite
napalmingson the banks ofthe
Mekong some 200 meters from
the island's shores. The irony is
that the sect "decamped" as
Communist victory neared,
and the island became, in
Page's eyes, one of the war's
more pitiable casualties.
The pictures, especially the
first, are tranquil; the writing
tells us that Page was touched
deeply by the place's dedica
tion to peace and his eventual
acceptance there. It's a nice
way to conclude an otherwise
hostile book and somehow a
fitting end to a collection of
war photographs. But the brief
glimpse at Page's more intros
pective side is not enough to
make me buy it, especially at
$14.95 a crack. I mentioned
that war pictures speak for
themselves; perhaps Page
should have given them that
chance.

deeply by the place's dedica
tion to peace and his eventual
acceptance there. It's a nice
way to conclude an otherwise
hostile book and somehow a
fitting end to a collection of
war photographs. But the brief
glimpse at Page's more intros
pective side is not enough to
make me buy it, especially at
$14.95 a crack. I mentioned
that war pictures speak for
themselves; perhaps Page
should have given them that
chance.



Too much war, too little art
More than any other type of
documentary work, war
photos tend to speak for them
selves. Their content is as di
verse as the body of photo
graphers who were compelled
to record them, yet they seem
to speak a common, despairing
message of violation from the
perverse intrusion of war. Even
at its lightest moments, Tim
Page's collection strays little
from this norm (and one hardly
can expect that it would not),
but that hardly makes it an av
erage book because its author
is far from ordinary, or perhaps
was too stoned to let the war
bother him.
Where the Gl went, Page
went; and though the war pho
tographer is hardy by defini
tion, of the few who went as
deep into the conflict as did
Page, only a handfull escaped
earning an MIA or KIA. If any
thing, Page's book is unique
because its author is alive.
A revival of interest in Page's
work was brought on in 1977 by
the publication of Michael
Herr's Dispatches, one of the
first important books to
emerge from a journalist in
Viet Nam. A good friend of
Page, Herr collaborated on
Apocalypse Now, creating the
slightly crazed upstream jour
nalist with Page in mind. For
Time/Life, however, "slightly
crazed" was not a desirable
state for its employees and,
though they paid him hand
somely for freelance, Page
never was given a position on
the staff. Consequently, the
tendency,at leaston my part, is
to greet Page's photos in a
somewhat "mythologized"
manner (as Page put it), in re
sponse to the film and his role
in Dispatch. The brief, care
fully sculpted text accompany
ing each section of the book
heightens the "mythology"
rather than hurts it, and Page's
infatuation with the "glamour
of war" — his seduction by the
helicopters, the heat, the
paranoia, and the risk — is
rendered all too clear.
Some of Page's best pictures
are of helicopters; they were
"the taxicab of the war." The
first section of Nam is called
"Chopper Blitzkrieg," and
from these few shots alone one
gets a feeling of their over
whelming presence. The ac
companying copy is a weird
pidgin of militarese and slang
— a sort of lack Kerouac
stream-of-thought fragmented

by the motion and noise. Most
of it doesn't make sense, but
Page only wants us to feel the
confusion and sense the disre
spect for life harbored in the
gutof a machine. Rationale was
confined to the noise and
surge and firepower of the
helicopter and little else when
on board, and there was prob
ably never a more comforting
roar for the Gl on the ground.
The next two sections, "Por
traits" and"The Mechanics",
seem sober in comparison to
"Blitzkrieg." Page turns his
lens here on the individual —
the Gl specifically. In his early
twenties and British, Page had
all the makings for a good rap
port with just about anybody,
but his maniacally cavalier be
havior the Gl's especially could
appreciate. "There's an
airstrike lookingforyou, Page"
many of the faces in "Portraits"
seem to be saying. Neverthe
less, the title page of this see

tion holds the most intriguing
picture in the collection.
With Kurtz's reading of "The
Hollow Men" in Apocalypse
Now still ringing in the back of
our minds, it is alarming to see
eyes so full of depth and pur-

pose staring out of the unmis
takably savage countenance of
CI. The effect is partially from
the color of his skin and the tall
grass in which he is seated,

partly from the sweat on his
forehead, and partly from the
pipe full of Cambodian Red
which rests lightly in his
mouth. Page was quick to say
that the widely available weed
and opium were half the fun

and most of the solace respec
tively. In any case, this and
many of the photos in "Por
traits" and "Mechanics"
(Page's metaphorical term for

infantry, incidentally) are
strong, but not quite Capra,
and the writing through the
remaining sections never gets
as good.
"Loud and insane" is the
point Page strives for in "Rock
and Roll Flash," and it consis
tently eludes him in spite of ef
forts to collapse the "being"
that was AFRVN (Armed Forces
Radio Vietnam) onto the
printed page by scrambling
bits of nostalgic news items
and then peppering the con
coction with strains of Hen
drix, the Dead, and the Doors.
The concept is interesting, but
probably more suited to film.
The pictures, by in large, are as
ineffective and, at best, show
how uncomfortable the idea
alone of entertainment was
under the circumstances, es
pecially the USO shows. The
message is not lost on us
though — rock, like drugs, was
needed badly by some Gls —
and, as William Shawcross tells

in the introduction, the sixties
beat lingers on today in Saigon
where its influence was gre
test.
In "Sufferings" Page focuses
on the other half, the depreda
tion and pain, in cennection
with the American presence in
Vietnam. Unlike the preceed
ing section, 'C.V. of Carriers,"
where his pictures of the men
and planes of the Navy are
powerful both in the images
themselves and the suggestion
of precision, pride and ignor
ance of the devastation ashore,
Page seems to be out of his de
partment. Three pictures stand
out while the remainder are
somehow distracted — a little
too documentary and distant
— as if he was not as willing to

get as intimate with suffering as
with the erotic mystique of
helicopter warfare.
Even his own wounds he
treated lightly (he was
wounded several times, twice
severely) as he gladly accepted
bonus pay, a "hero's wel
come " and then returned to
the "acid madness." The be
havior, naturally, earned for
Page some rather inadvertant
photographer's prestige from
those with less daring, but the
resulting sythesis of his actions
with his photographs in Nam is
hardly prestigious. In fact, the
greatest weakness of the book
seems to be that it mocks the
Gl, the draftee, the "poor
whites and blacks plucked
from the ignorant and often
innocent island of America's
heart," and even the Viet
namese — anyone who had to
be there didn't want to be. As
Herr tells it, 'Vietnam was what
we had instead of happy child
hoods," and photography was
their ticket to all the fun as
much as it was an important
offshoot of their presence in
the war.
In the final section of the
book, "The Dao of Peace,"
Page does "step back from in
sanity'' in both the text and the
photography in his epilogue
about the religious sanctuary
on the island of Phoung.
Throughout the conflict it re
mained untouched despite
napalmingson the banks ofthe
Mekong some 200 meters from
the island's shores. The irony is
that the sect "decamped" as
Communist victory neared,
and the island became, in
Page's eyes, one of the war's
more pitiable casualties.
The pictures, especially the
first, are tranquil; the writing
tells us that Page was touched
deeply by the place's dedica
tion to peace and his eventual
acceptance there. It's a nice

Mekong some 200 meters from
the island's shores. The irony is
that the sect "decamped" as
Communist victory neared,
and the island became, in
Page's eyes, one of the war's
more pitiable casualties.
The pictures, especially the
first, are tranquil; the writing
tells us that Page was touched
deeply by the place's dedica
tion to peace and his eventual
acceptance there. It's a nice
way to conclude an otherwise
hostile book and somehow a
fitting end to a collection of
war photographs. But the brief
glimpse at Page's more intros
pective side is not enough to
make me buy it, especially at
$14.95 a crack. I mentioned
that war pictures speak for
themselves; perhaps Page
should have given them that
chance.



Too much war, too little art
