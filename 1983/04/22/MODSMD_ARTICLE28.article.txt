My Search for Warren C. Harding
Robert Plunkett
Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.
$13.95
His name is Elliot Weiner. He is a male Caucasian about
5-t'oot-7, brown hair, brown eyes; a slightly balding pro
fessor of history at Mercy College in New York. He is in
his mid-'3os, has good taste in clothes, a neatly-trimmed
beard, and is in most ways a perfectly normal, slightly
conservative, academic type. Like all of us Elliot harbors
a vain desire for fame and fortune, but unlike just about
everyone he has chosen to seek this goal through the
captue and subsequent exploitation of the secret papers
of Warren Harding, the infamous 29th president of the
United States.
Yes, lames Bond is back, but in My Search for Warren
C. Harding he is mild-mannered and ordinary. Just try to
imagine Weiner in the role of master-spy-adventurer
saying something like, "that's a bit too indelicate for my
palate, I rather prefer Almaden, the gourmet jug wine,"
and the comedic possibilities appear to be endless.
Robert Plunket, writing his debut novel, makes no such
allusions to Fleming's famous 007, but beautifully cap
tures the hilarity of Weiner in that type ot role. Plunket
does not do this, however, in a way reminiscent of a
cheap T.V. detective comedy series. He does it with
class, style and character development that leads one to
suspect he may be a direct descendant of )ane Austen.
Weiner's mission: on authority of a $7500 grant from

the Reed Foundation, he must extract information reve
aling the unknown mysteries surrounding Harding He
seeks to do this by traveling to Los Angeles from New
York and interrogating the now 80-year-old ex-mistress
of Harding, Rebekah Kinney. She—and their illegitimate
daughter—survived Harding following his untimely
death shortly after his inauguration.
Kinney later wrote The Price of Love, an underground
autobiography (such stuff was unheard of in the 1920"),
the proceeds of which she used to support herself and
their daughter. Upon accidently reading an original
print of this book at a garage sale, Weiner becomes
interested in the subject matter and puts it to consider
able academic profit. Then as the result of another att i
dent, in L.A. for a Morris dancing convention, he spots
Rebekah Kinney's name in a local phone book. He
knows that it's familiar but can not quite place it. Upon
his return to New York he realizes that, if she is the same
woman who wrote The Price of Love, she could be in
valuable to his research.
Upon reaching Los Angeles, Weiner, who is stayng
with a loud-mouth, status-seeking, busy-body named
Eve, begins to spy on the Kinney home. Eventually he
decides that he must try to get into the household, so he
attempts to rent the small pool house which, he has
ascertained from his many days of spying, is no longer
being used by the family. He goes to the door expecting
to meet the old woman, but is instead greeted by an
impossibly dumb, fat girl named Jonica who is in the
middle of polyurethaning a dead cactus.
As the book progresses Weiner finds himself in the
position similar to that Bond finds himself in. The
difference is that where Bond must seduce beautiful
women, Weiner must seduce the impossibly fat and
stupid lonica, who, upon their meeting, revealed a
prominent set of gums.
After establishing these fairly interesting details of
plot, Plunket dares and is successfully able to introduce
the element of suspense into the book. From the time
Weiner is about to get in the sack with Jonica to the very
end, My Search for Warren C. Harding is almost impossi
ble to put down. Although, as in Austen's Pride and
Prejudice, the ultimate outcome of this book is fairly
certain, the plot takes interesting twists which captivate
the reader. One is not quite so sure that the obvious will
occur and becomes excited to find out. The ending,
while interesting, is somewhat anti-climatic and to some
disappointing, but upon reflection is necessary and con
sistant with the rest of the book.
It is hard to categorize this book as simply a humorous
novel, because of Plunket's substantial characteriza
tions and intricate plot development. Indeed, it is hard
to believe that a book could be so entertaining, and still
be consistantly meaningful. While making Weiner into a
bit of a jerk, and making fun of him, Plunket also reveals
serious conflicts that Weiner must face, such as his
middle-class heritage and his loss of youth. It is these
conflicts that make Weiner a believable character, and
allow the reader to be sympathetic- towards him.
Plunket's thoroughness pays off, often making the
funny scenarios of the book even more hilarious. One of
these scenes occurs when Weiner tries to spy on the old
lady in her room late at night; narrating the story,
Weiner says,
"I figured if I got just a little bit closer, I could hear the

other person. I crept up three more steps and paused.
Not quite. One more should do it.
"It did it all right. As I placed my foot on the seventh
step, I heard a tunny cracking sound. Before I knew what
was happening, my right leg shot toward the ground,
throwing me against the wooden railing, which also col
lapsed. I hit the dirt with such force all the wind was
knocked out ot me. I think I must have passed out for a
second. 1 hen the shrieks from upstairs revived me.
"My first-what am I saying, my only -thought was to
get out of there. Don 't ask me how I made it back to the
pool house. Its all a blur. The only thing I remember was
turning the corner and looking back over my shoulder.
There was lonica, standing on the balcony is an orange
nightgown that made her look like an overweight Buddh
ist monk, pointing at me and emitting shrill little yelps of
terror and outrage.
"The first thing I did was lock the door. Then I ran into
the ladies dressing room. I generally use the men's but
the ladies had better mirrors. I switched on the light.
Then it was my turn to shriek.
"I was literally covered with blood. My beard, my chin,
my shirt, my hands. The sight was so frightening I col-

lapsed on a bench; anybody who lost that much blood
shouldn't be on his feet. Then I began the dreaded but
necessary search for wounds.
"Fortunately, all the blood seemed to be coming from
my nose. I have a history of nose bleeds, probably aggra
vated by the fact that as three-year-old I stuffed an entire
bottle of aspirin up my nostrils (just the aspirin, not the
bottle). God knows what was on my mind.
"Only when I got up to go over to the sink did I
discover my ankle was sprained, or, Cod forbid, broken.
I never want to relive that feeling. It was one of the worst

nights of my life."
In addition to Weiner, Jonica, Eve and Rebekah Kin
ney, Plunket has characters like Alice Amber (a long
since forgotten movie star), her feminist daughter Barrie
who is a member of a left-wing theater group called
"Live Nude Girls," Jonica's husband Vernon Fetchko (a
young motorcycle enthusiast who is now separated from
jonica) and Texas millionaire Claude Kentner, Alice's
new boyfriend who has a tendency to prodigious drool
ing in pressure situations. These characters are woven
into a rich fabric of constantly changing alliances.
Intrigue makes for strange bedfellows, and when you
start with strange people, as Plunket does, it is almost
impossible to avoid amusing situations. Naturally, Plun
ket is able to exploit the humor from combinations such
as Weiner and jonica, and then when Jonica is found to
be useless, Weiner and Vernon Fetchko, Jonica's es
tranged husband, but he is also able to create very funny
interaction between the lesser characters as well.
As a special bonus Plunket includes some of Weiner's
recipes and tips on giving chic parties, which serve to
give the reader even closer association to the material,
which is presented as a Weiner narrative.
On the whole this book is a "must buy." As it is $13.95
in hard-cover, and paperback is not available, it would
probably be a good idea to get for your parents or
grandparents as a gift, and sneak a reading before you
wrap it. I realize that this is a creep's tactic, but this book
is worth it even if you get caught and are embarrassed.
I would recommend stealing the book, or borrowing it,
but this is one of those rare cases where the author
actually deserves every cent he can get. Co now, don't
wait. Order this book. It will be a crime against all hu
manity if it doesn't make The New York Times bestseller
list, so don't you be the one people are pointing the
finger at. With the smallest amount of luck this book is
likely to be a large success. It is remarkable that this is
Robert Plunket's debut novel, and if it is any kind of
indication of what we can expect from his, I can't wait for
the next one.

Intrigue makes for strange bedfellows, and when you
start with strange people, as Plunket does, it is almost
impossible to avoid amusing situations. Naturally, Plun

as Weiner and jonica, and then when Jonica is found to
be useless, Weiner and Vernon Fetchko, Jonica's es
tranged husband, but he is also able to create very funny

As a special bonus Plunket includes some of Weiner's
recipes and tips on giving chic parties, which serve to
give the reader even closer association to the material,
which is presented as a Weiner narrative.
On the whole this book is a "must buy." As it is $13.95
in hard-cover, and paperback is not available, it would
probably be a good idea to get for your parents or
grandparents as a gift, and sneak a reading before you
wrap it. I realize that this is a creep's tactic, but this book
is worth it even if you get caught and are embarrassed.
I would recommend stealing the book, or borrowing it,
but this is one of those rare cases where the author
actually deserves every cent he can get. Co now, don't
wait. Order this book. It will be a crime against all hu

list, so don't you be the one people are pointing the

likely to be a large success. It is remarkable that this is
Robert Plunket's debut novel, and if it is any kind of
indication of what we can expect from his, I can't wait for
the next one.



A rather funny book

My Search for Warren C. Harding
Robert Plunkett
Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.
$13.95
His name is Elliot Weiner. He is a male Caucasian about
5-t'oot-7, brown hair, brown eyes; a slightly balding pro
fessor of history at Mercy College in New York. He is in
his mid-'3os, has good taste in clothes, a neatly-trimmed
beard, and is in most ways a perfectly normal, slightly
conservative, academic type. Like all of us Elliot harbors
a vain desire for fame and fortune, but unlike just about
everyone he has chosen to seek this goal through the
captue and subsequent exploitation of the secret papers
of Warren Harding, the infamous 29th president of the
United States.
Yes, lames Bond is back, but in My Search for Warren
C. Harding he is mild-mannered and ordinary. Just try to
imagine Weiner in the role of master-spy-adventurer
saying something like, "that's a bit too indelicate for my
palate, I rather prefer Almaden, the gourmet jug wine,"
and the comedic possibilities appear to be endless.
Robert Plunket, writing his debut novel, makes no such
allusions to Fleming's famous 007, but beautifully cap
tures the hilarity of Weiner in that type ot role. Plunket
does not do this, however, in a way reminiscent of a
cheap T.V. detective comedy series. He does it with
class, style and character development that leads one to
suspect he may be a direct descendant of )ane Austen.
Weiner's mission: on authority of a $7500 grant from

the Reed Foundation, he must extract information reve
aling the unknown mysteries surrounding Harding He
seeks to do this by traveling to Los Angeles from New
York and interrogating the now 80-year-old ex-mistress
of Harding, Rebekah Kinney. She—and their illegitimate
daughter—survived Harding following his untimely
death shortly after his inauguration.
Kinney later wrote The Price of Love, an underground
autobiography (such stuff was unheard of in the 1920"),
the proceeds of which she used to support herself and
their daughter. Upon accidently reading an original
print of this book at a garage sale, Weiner becomes
interested in the subject matter and puts it to consider
able academic profit. Then as the result of another att i
dent, in L.A. for a Morris dancing convention, he spots
Rebekah Kinney's name in a local phone book. He
knows that it's familiar but can not quite place it. Upon
his return to New York he realizes that, if she is the same
woman who wrote The Price of Love, she could be in
valuable to his research.
Upon reaching Los Angeles, Weiner, who is stayng
with a loud-mouth, status-seeking, busy-body named
Eve, begins to spy on the Kinney home. Eventually he
decides that he must try to get into the household, so he
attempts to rent the small pool house which, he has
ascertained from his many days of spying, is no longer
being used by the family. He goes to the door expecting
to meet the old woman, but is instead greeted by an
impossibly dumb, fat girl named Jonica who is in the
middle of polyurethaning a dead cactus.
As the book progresses Weiner finds himself in the
position similar to that Bond finds himself in. The
difference is that where Bond must seduce beautiful
women, Weiner must seduce the impossibly fat and
stupid lonica, who, upon their meeting, revealed a
prominent set of gums.
After establishing these fairly interesting details of
plot, Plunket dares and is successfully able to introduce
the element of suspense into the book. From the time
Weiner is about to get in the sack with Jonica to the very
end, My Search for Warren C. Harding is almost impossi
ble to put down. Although, as in Austen's Pride and
Prejudice, the ultimate outcome of this book is fairly
certain, the plot takes interesting twists which captivate
the reader. One is not quite so sure that the obvious will
occur and becomes excited to find out. The ending,
while interesting, is somewhat anti-climatic and to some
disappointing, but upon reflection is necessary and con
sistant with the rest of the book.
It is hard to categorize this book as simply a humorous
novel, because of Plunket's substantial characteriza
tions and intricate plot development. Indeed, it is hard
to believe that a book could be so entertaining, and still
be consistantly meaningful. While making Weiner into a
bit of a jerk, and making fun of him, Plunket also reveals
serious conflicts that Weiner must face, such as his
middle-class heritage and his loss of youth. It is these
conflicts that make Weiner a believable character, and
allow the reader to be sympathetic- towards him.
Plunket's thoroughness pays off, often making the
funny scenarios of the book even more hilarious. One of
these scenes occurs when Weiner tries to spy on the old
lady in her room late at night; narrating the story,
Weiner says,
"I figured if I got just a little bit closer, I could hear the

other person. I crept up three more steps and paused.
Not quite. One more should do it.
"It did it all right. As I placed my foot on the seventh
step, I heard a tunny cracking sound. Before I knew what
was happening, my right leg shot toward the ground,
throwing me against the wooden railing, which also col
lapsed. I hit the dirt with such force all the wind was
knocked out ot me. I think I must have passed out for a
second. 1 hen the shrieks from upstairs revived me.

Robert Plunket, writing his debut novel, makes no such
allusions to Fleming's famous 007, but beautifully cap
tures the hilarity of Weiner in that type ot role. Plunket
does not do this, however, in a way reminiscent of a
cheap T.V. detective comedy series. He does it with
class, style and character development that leads one to
suspect he may be a direct descendant of )ane Austen.
Weiner's mission: on authority of a $7500 grant from

the Reed Foundation, he must extract information reve
aling the unknown mysteries surrounding Harding He
seeks to do this by traveling to Los Angeles from New
York and interrogating the now 80-year-old ex-mistress
of Harding, Rebekah Kinney. She—and their illegitimate
daughter—survived Harding following his untimely
death shortly after his inauguration.
Kinney later wrote The Price of Love, an underground
autobiography (such stuff was unheard of in the 1920"),
the proceeds of which she used to support herself and
their daughter. Upon accidently reading an original
print of this book at a garage sale, Weiner becomes
interested in the subject matter and puts it to consider
able academic profit. Then as the result of another att i
dent, in L.A. for a Morris dancing convention, he spots
Rebekah Kinney's name in a local phone book. He
knows that it's familiar but can not quite place it. Upon
his return to New York he realizes that, if she is the same
woman who wrote The Price of Love, she could be in
valuable to his research.
Upon reaching Los Angeles, Weiner, who is stayng
with a loud-mouth, status-seeking, busy-body named
Eve, begins to spy on the Kinney home. Eventually he
decides that he must try to get into the household, so he
attempts to rent the small pool house which, he has
ascertained from his many days of spying, is no longer
being used by the family. He goes to the door expecting
to meet the old woman, but is instead greeted by an
impossibly dumb, fat girl named Jonica who is in the
middle of polyurethaning a dead cactus.
As the book progresses Weiner finds himself in the
position similar to that Bond finds himself in. The
difference is that where Bond must seduce beautiful
women, Weiner must seduce the impossibly fat and
stupid lonica, who, upon their meeting, revealed a
prominent set of gums.
After establishing these fairly interesting details of
plot, Plunket dares and is successfully able to introduce
the element of suspense into the book. From the time
Weiner is about to get in the sack with Jonica to the very
end, My Search for Warren C. Harding is almost impossi
ble to put down. Although, as in Austen's Pride and
Prejudice, the ultimate outcome of this book is fairly
certain, the plot takes interesting twists which captivate
the reader. One is not quite so sure that the obvious will
occur and becomes excited to find out. The ending,
while interesting, is somewhat anti-climatic and to some
disappointing, but upon reflection is necessary and con
sistant with the rest of the book.
It is hard to categorize this book as simply a humorous
novel, because of Plunket's substantial characteriza
tions and intricate plot development. Indeed, it is hard
to believe that a book could be so entertaining, and still
be consistantly meaningful. While making Weiner into a
bit of a jerk, and making fun of him, Plunket also reveals
serious conflicts that Weiner must face, such as his
middle-class heritage and his loss of youth. It is these
conflicts that make Weiner a believable character, and
allow the reader to be sympathetic- towards him.
Plunket's thoroughness pays off, often making the
funny scenarios of the book even more hilarious. One of
these scenes occurs when Weiner tries to spy on the old
lady in her room late at night; narrating the story,
Weiner says,
"I figured if I got just a little bit closer, I could hear the

other person. I crept up three more steps and paused.
Not quite. One more should do it.
"It did it all right. As I placed my foot on the seventh
step, I heard a tunny cracking sound. Before I knew what
was happening, my right leg shot toward the ground,
throwing me against the wooden railing, which also col
lapsed. I hit the dirt with such force all the wind was
knocked out ot me. I think I must have passed out for a
second. 1 hen the shrieks from upstairs revived me.
"My first-what am I saying, my only -thought was to
get out of there. Don 't ask me how I made it back to the
pool house. Its all a blur. The only thing I remember was
turning the corner and looking back over my shoulder.
There was lonica, standing on the balcony is an orange
nightgown that made her look like an overweight Buddh
ist monk, pointing at me and emitting shrill little yelps of
terror and outrage.
"The first thing I did was lock the door. Then I ran into
the ladies dressing room. I generally use the men's but
the ladies had better mirrors. I switched on the light.
Then it was my turn to shriek.
"I was literally covered with blood. My beard, my chin,
my shirt, my hands. The sight was so frightening I col-

lapsed on a bench; anybody who lost that much blood
shouldn't be on his feet. Then I began the dreaded but
necessary search for wounds.
"Fortunately, all the blood seemed to be coming from
my nose. I have a history of nose bleeds, probably aggra
vated by the fact that as three-year-old I stuffed an entire
bottle of aspirin up my nostrils (just the aspirin, not the
bottle). God knows what was on my mind.
"Only when I got up to go over to the sink did I
discover my ankle was sprained, or, Cod forbid, broken.
I never want to relive that feeling. It was one of the worst

nights of my life."
In addition to Weiner, Jonica, Eve and Rebekah Kin
ney, Plunket has characters like Alice Amber (a long
since forgotten movie star), her feminist daughter Barrie
who is a member of a left-wing theater group called
"Live Nude Girls," Jonica's husband Vernon Fetchko (a
young motorcycle enthusiast who is now separated from
jonica) and Texas millionaire Claude Kentner, Alice's
new boyfriend who has a tendency to prodigious drool
ing in pressure situations. These characters are woven
into a rich fabric of constantly changing alliances.
Intrigue makes for strange bedfellows, and when you
start with strange people, as Plunket does, it is almost
impossible to avoid amusing situations. Naturally, Plun
ket is able to exploit the humor from combinations such
as Weiner and jonica, and then when Jonica is found to
be useless, Weiner and Vernon Fetchko, Jonica's es
tranged husband, but he is also able to create very funny
interaction between the lesser characters as well.
As a special bonus Plunket includes some of Weiner's
recipes and tips on giving chic parties, which serve to
give the reader even closer association to the material,
which is presented as a Weiner narrative.
On the whole this book is a "must buy." As it is $13.95
in hard-cover, and paperback is not available, it would
probably be a good idea to get for your parents or
grandparents as a gift, and sneak a reading before you
wrap it. I realize that this is a creep's tactic, but this book
is worth it even if you get caught and are embarrassed.
I would recommend stealing the book, or borrowing it,
but this is one of those rare cases where the author
actually deserves every cent he can get. Co now, don't
wait. Order this book. It will be a crime against all hu
manity if it doesn't make The New York Times bestseller
list, so don't you be the one people are pointing the
finger at. With the smallest amount of luck this book is
likely to be a large success. It is remarkable that this is
Robert Plunket's debut novel, and if it is any kind of
indication of what we can expect from his, I can't wait for
the next one.



A rather funny book
