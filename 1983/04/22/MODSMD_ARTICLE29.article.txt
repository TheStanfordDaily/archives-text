## First-place Card has 4-game lead over ASU Stanford hopes to tan, not fan against Sun Devils 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Tempe, Ariz.—Clinging to a
four-game conference lead,
Stanford opens a three-game
series here tonight against
second-place Arizona State.
Scattered showers that
greeted the Cardinal yesterday
were expected to clear out of
the valley by this evening for
the 7 p.m. (6 p.m.PST) 6-Pac
conference game at Packard
Stadium.
The Sun Devils, now 31-14
overall and 11-10 conference,
climbed back from a dismal
start when they swept a three
game homestand against USC
last weekend.
The Trojans were just one
half game behind Stanford be
fore bowing to the Sun Devils
and facing their zealous fans
who warmly bid farewill to
swept-away teams with a cache
of brooms.
Arizona State, like Stanford,
has been virtually unbeatable
at home this season, compiling
a 23-3 record at Packard

Stadium. The Cardinal is 23-1 at
Sunken Diamond, but only
7-8-1 on the road.
"Arizona State is on a roll
and are really playing well,"
said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "They are a good team
and have six of their last nine
games at home so they are
going to be tough."
Stanford , now 30-9 overall
and 13-4 conference, seems to
be recovered from a hitting
slump and on a roll of their
own. The Cardinal, ranked
third nationally by Baseball
America, won four games of an
extended five-game series
against UCLA last weekend.
"It feels good," Marquess
said last week, "I was hoping
the slump wouldn't last too
long."
One Cardinal who thinks
Stanford never really left the
hitting grove is pitcher Steve
Cottrell.
"I never really thought we
were out of a groove." Cottrell
said. "People say we batted
about ,170 against Cal, but they

(Cal) have a good pitching staff
and their pitchers threw good
games against us."
Tonight's opener matches
ASU's Kendall Carter, 8-2 and
2.66 ERA, against Stanford's
Brian Myers, 6-2 and 3.09 ERA.
Saturday's 1 p.m. (12 p.m.
PST) contest pits ASU'.-; Gilbert
Villanueva, 3-2 and 5.05, and
Cottrell, 6-2 and 4.71 ERA.
Neither Marquess nor ASU
coach Jim Brock has settled on
a starter for Sunday's 1 p.m. (1
p.m. PST) finale.
Arizona State's offense is led
by catcher Don Wakamatsu,
from Hayward, who is batting
.358. Centerfielder Oddibe
McDowell is batting .345 with a
team-high 37 runs batted in.
Rightfielder Steve Moses is hit
ting .345 and shortstop Romy
Cucjen is at .321.
Designated hitter and relief
pitcher Doug Henry, also from
Hayward, is batting .289 and
fresh man I eftf ielder Barry
Bonds, from San Carlos, is hit
ting .266.

Bonds sat out the series
against Stanford last month
when the Cardinal swept the
Sun Devils at Sunken
Diamond.
For Stanford, designated hit
ter Eric Hardgrave, who was
named 6-Pac Player of the
Week last week, upped his
school record home run total
to 15 last weekend. The Cardi
nal slugger leads the Pacific-10
Southern Division with a .395
batting average and 61 RBIs.
The rest of the offense is
powered by Mike Aldrete
(.371, 45 RBl's), Vince Sake <=ki
(.368), Mark Davis (.351) and
Mike Dotterer (.307).
Freshman reliever Kevin
Kunkel is 6-0, mainly out of the
bullpen, and left-hander jeff
Ballard, 5-1 and 3.60 ERA, leads
the team in appearances with
16. Right-hander john Radke,
another bullpen ace, is first in
the Southern Division with
four saves.
As a team, Stanford is tied for
the batting lead with UCLA at
.314. Arizona State is fourth at
.294. -

Tempe, Ariz.—Clinging to a
four-game conference lead,
Stanford opens a three-game
series here tonight against
second-place Arizona State.
Scattered showers that
greeted the Cardinal yesterday
were expected to clear out of
the valley by this evening for
the 7 p.m. (6 p.m.PST) 6-Pac
conference game at Packard
Stadium.
The Sun Devils, now 31-14
overall and 11-10 conference,
climbed back from a dismal
start when they swept a three
game homestand against USC
last weekend.
The Trojans were just one
half game behind Stanford be
fore bowing to the Sun Devils
and facing their zealous fans
who warmly bid farewill to
swept-away teams with a cache
of brooms.
Arizona State, like Stanford,
has been virtually unbeatable
at home this season, compiling
a 23-3 record at Packard

Stadium. The Cardinal is 23-1 at
Sunken Diamond, but only
7-8-1 on the road.
"Arizona State is on a roll
and are really playing well,"
said Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess. "They are a good team
and have six of their last nine
games at home so they are
going to be tough."
Stanford , now 30-9 overall
and 13-4 conference, seems to
be recovered from a hitting
slump and on a roll of their
own. The Cardinal, ranked
third nationally by Baseball
America, won four games of an
extended five-game series
against UCLA last weekend.
"It feels good," Marquess
said last week, "I was hoping
the slump wouldn't last too
long."
One Cardinal who thinks
Stanford never really left the
hitting grove is pitcher Steve
Cottrell.
"I never really thought we
were out of a groove." Cottrell
said. "People say we batted
about ,170 against Cal, but they

(Cal) have a good pitching staff
and their pitchers threw good
games against us."
Tonight's opener matches
ASU's Kendall Carter, 8-2 and
2.66 ERA, against Stanford's
Brian Myers, 6-2 and 3.09 ERA.
Saturday's 1 p.m. (12 p.m.
PST) contest pits ASU'.-; Gilbert
Villanueva, 3-2 and 5.05, and
Cottrell, 6-2 and 4.71 ERA.
Neither Marquess nor ASU
coach Jim Brock has settled on
a starter for Sunday's 1 p.m. (1
p.m. PST) finale.
Arizona State's offense is led
by catcher Don Wakamatsu,
from Hayward, who is batting
.358. Centerfielder Oddibe
McDowell is batting .345 with a
team-high 37 runs batted in.
Rightfielder Steve Moses is hit
ting .345 and shortstop Romy
Cucjen is at .321.
Designated hitter and relief
pitcher Doug Henry, also from
Hayward, is batting .289 and
fresh man I eftf ielder Barry
Bonds, from San Carlos, is hit
ting .266.

Bonds sat out the series
against Stanford last month
when the Cardinal swept the
Sun Devils at Sunken
Diamond.
For Stanford, designated hit
ter Eric Hardgrave, who was
named 6-Pac Player of the
Week last week, upped his
school record home run total
to 15 last weekend. The Cardi
nal slugger leads the Pacific-10
Southern Division with a .395
batting average and 61 RBIs.
