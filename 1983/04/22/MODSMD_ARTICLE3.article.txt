# Unguaranteed may get campus housing

### LESLIE WEEDEN Staff writer 
Undergraduates without guaran
teed campus housing for next year
who draw a high number should stay
with the housing draw at least until
the start of the school year, advised
Rodger Whitney, assistant director of
housing.
"We will have a net increase in
student spaces next year of 350 for
undergraduates," he said. "We hope
to meet all the demand from any
body, guaranteed or unguaranteed."
Students havea betterchance than
usual of getting housing in this year's
draw, the annual event during which
students draw a number from one
(good) to 5000 (not as good) to be
come eligible for their choices in
campus housing.
In the past four years the waiting
list statistics on Registration Day have
shown consistently that about 350
undergraduates still want University
housing, Whitney said.
The new housing — including the
Sterling Quadrangle, the Indepen
dent Houses and the Suites — will
add 800 spaces to University hous
ing. However, 100 spaces must be
deleted from the whole system be
cause the density in the Manzanita
Park trailers will drop from four to
three students per trailer next year.
In addition, because there is heavy
demand for graduate housing,
graduate students will occupy about

286 spaces in the trailers, 44 in the
co-ops and 16 in Mirrielees — all pre
viously filled by undergraduates.
That change leaves undergradute
housing with a net increase of 350
spaces.
"The goal of the new housing was
to try to meet both graduate and un
dergraduate housing needs," Whit
ney said.
Students who draw a high number
should not be discouraged, he said.
"Many people don't realize that draw
numbers are not literal. . . . There
are 50()0 numbers but not everyone
enters. We usually have only slightly
more than 4000."
Student draw coordinator Dave
Walton said the turnout seems to be
heavier this year than last. He rea
soned that more students are going
through the draw because of the new
housing available. "A lot who are not
guaranteed are going through hop
ing to get on campus because hope
fully the cut-off will be higher next
year," he said.
Because many students cannot
rely on last year's statistics, they are
very unsure of what housing their
numbers will provide, Walton said.
Also, they are confused by such un
certainties as the distribution of
numbers drawn, the number of
women who draw good numbers
compared to the number of men
drawing similarly and the number of
