# All 8 Stanford netmen shocked at Pac-10 singles
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford men's tennis coach
Dick Gould probably wishes he
never got out of bed yesterday
morning.
So do the eight members of
the Stanford tennis team that
traveled to Ojai for the Pacific
-10 Individual Championships.
The reason is simple. After
just one day of competition, all
eight have lost. All of them.
"It was a disappointing day,"
joked Gould. "Hopefully we
will rebound for our match
against No. 2 Pepperdine
(Tuesday afternoon).
"It (yesterday's losses) just
shows that we've got to be
ready to play."
Stanford was ranked sixth
nationally last week before
home wins over USC and
UCLA, the No. 4 and No. 5
rated teams. But five of its six

players lost first-round
matches in the Pac-10 singles
tournament.
The only first-round winner
was freshman Eric Rosenfeld,
who defeated Arizona State's
Alex Levie 6-1, 6-3. But Rosen
feld followed the path of his
teammates in the second
round, losing to USC's Matt
Anger by the same score.
Defending Pac-10 singles
champion Scott Davis, who
Could said was still weak from
his recent boutwith mononuc
leosis, was dropped in straight
sets by Arizona State's Dewey
Gratton 6-4, 7-5.
It was Davis' second loss in a
row. UCLA's Jeff Klaparda, who
was replacing Danny Saltz at
No. 1, beat Davis last Saturday
night in Maples Pavilion 3-6,
6-2, 6-2. A day earlier, Davis
had disposed of 14th ranked

Anger 6-2, 5-7, 6-4.
Card freshman John Letts fell
another Trojan netter, An-
Antony Emerson, 6-2, 6-3.
A pair of UCLA players got
revenge for Saturday's 5-4 loss
to Stanford, Barry Buss down
ing Jim Grabb 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 and
Mark Basham outlasting Dan
Goldie 3-6, 7-6, 6-2.
Team captain Mark McKeen
lost his first-round match to
Paul Chamberlain 4-6, 6-3, 6-2
in yet another match where a
Card netter won the first set
and then proceeded to lose the
next two.
In the open tournament,
Geordie McKee's was no ex
ception. McKee, a local star
from Menlo School, was de
feated by Bob Hochstater 4-6,
7-5, 6-3. Jeremy Semple lost to
John Chappell, who is not af
filiated with any team.
