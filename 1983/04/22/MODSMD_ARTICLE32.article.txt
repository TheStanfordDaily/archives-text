## Cycling club breaks away to compete in Santa Barbara 
### BETH KLEID 
Most Stanford students have one bicy
cle that they use to get around campus,
and they lock it up outside their resi
dences when it is not in use. But not the
members of the cycling club here — their
bicycles are their most precious posses
sions and are given special care.
"My bike sits up in my room," said
Sean Devin, cycling team member. "It is
just too valuable to me to leave around
campus, and I can't afford having it sto
len. It's just too expensive."
Devin said that he doesn't use his bike
to get from class to class — he walks.
Most cycling team members have two
bicycles — one for transportation and
one for serious riding.
Cycling is a very expensive sport.
Equipment can run anywhere from $600
to $4000. The average Stanford cycler
spends about $1500 on equipment, ac
cording to Devin.
It is possible that the high cost of cy
cling competitively deters students from
joining the club sport team here. "We
only have 15 people on the team, and
they are mainly graduate students. We
have just three undergraduates," Devin
said.
The team is in need of more riders. For
the past two years the Stanford cyclers
have won the championships, but this
year they are threatened by UC-Santa
Barbara's big team.
"This year Santa Barbara is beating us
because they have a lot of riders," Devin
said. "We are not a dominating team like

we were last year. Santa Barbara is giving
us some real competition."
But the Card cyclers still have a chance
to peddle past Santa Barbara. This
weekend they travel south to race a
criterium in Santa Barbara. "This will be a
crucial race — we really have to do well,"
said Devin.
Putting UC-Santa Barbara aside, the
cyclers are satisfied with their perform
ance this season. The consistent riders on
the team, including graduate students
lohn Foster, Art Walker and |enny Keals
ing, have helped the team to obtain its
record. The cyclers have won two race
weekends out of five, which is a good
record considering that 10 schools com
pete in each race. The team has benefit
ted from their hard work-outs.
"I think that we train better than any
other cycling team," Devin said. Practice
is held for two hours every day, and team
members work on distance riding, sprint
ing and hill-climbing skills under the
direction of coach Tim Nicholson.
Nicholson founded the entire West
Coast cycling program. Devin said that he
is a very supportive coach. The team also
receives coaching from professional cy
cler and Olympic skater Eric Heiden.
"Heiden has so much experience, and
he is helpful when he occasionally rides
with us."
The cycling team has a sense of group
spirit that team members can rely on dur

ing a grueling race. "It is good to know
that everyone is pulling for everyone else
on the team in a race. The team spirit we
have makes cycling more fun."
The cyclers put in hundreds of miles
per week. Races alone range from 25
miles (for women) to 75 miles (for ex
perts).
"The mileage is what attracted me to
the sport. You can see much more terri
tory in a bike ride than you can from
going running," Devin said.
Devin likes the thrill of cycling. "It's a
great feeling to break away in a race —
that's when a small group of riders pull
out in front and work together until the
sprint in the end."
The cyclers look forward to a big
weekend, with a race in Fresno on Satur
day in addition to the race in Santa Bar
bara on Sunday. "This season it may really
come down to the wire with UCSB. The
championships in Davis on May 7 and 8
could be the deciding race of the sea
son."
Water polo
Stanford's women's water polo club,
which fields two squads, hosted an invita
tional tournament last weekend. The "A"
team finished third with an even 2-2 re
cord. Seal Beach claimed the "A" cham
pionship. Stanford's "B" team won three
games and dropped one to take second
place behind Berkeley.

tournament. In earlier rounds, Stanford snut out Sonoma 2-0 and eliminated
Cal State Northridge 3-1 in overtime. Moore finished the tournament with
three goals and one assist. Tomorrow the Card hosts Sonoma at 3 p.m. on
