Nicklaus fires 65 at TOC
Carlsbad, Calif. — Jack Nicklaus, whose
ailing back forced him to withdraw from
the Masters, fired his best round of the
year, a 7-under-par 65. and took a two
stroke lead after the first round of the
$400,000 Tournament of Champions >es
terday.
Nicklaus, 43, the only five-'iime winner
of this elite event that brings together
only the winners of PGA Tour titles from
the last 12 months, often has noted that he
has come into the Tournament of Cham
pions on a letdown from the Masters.
Lanny Wadkins, defending champion
and the first man off the tee, hustled
around the course in 2 hours, 50 minutes
and shot a 67 that could have been much
better. He missed four times from about 6
feet.
Also at 67 were Hal Sutton who holed a
bunker shot for a birdie on the 10th, and
Gary Koch. PGA champion Rav Floyd hud
a 68. Craig Stadler, Johnny Miller and Tom
Kite, this year's leading money-winner,
were at 69.
Stanford alumnist Tom Watson con
tinued to have his difficulties. Watson,
who has not won this season and missed
the cut in his last start, struggled to a 4-
over-par 76. He finished bogey-double
bogey-bogey.
Knicks nix Nets in NBA
New York — The New York Knicks ad
vanced to the second round of the Na
tional Basketball Association playoffs last

night after Truck Robinson had nine of his
22 points during a 28-10 second-quarter
blitz that lifted them to a 105-99 victory
over metropolitan rival New Jersey for a
two-game sweep of the Nets.
The Knicks will face the Philadelphia
76ers, who had the best regular season
record in the NBA, n the first game of
their best-of-seven Eastern Conference
semifinal series starting Sunday in Phila
delphia.
NHL playoffs continue
The way the Chicago Black Hawks and
Edmonton Oilers disposed of iheir quar
terfinal opponents hi the National Hock
ey League playoffs, their Campbell Con
ference final ought to be one terrific
series.
The Hawks and Oilers, first-place fin
ishers in the Norris and Smythe divisions,
respectively, during the regular season,
justified those positions in the division
finals. Chicago knocked off a strong Min
nesota North Stars contingent in five
games, the same number it took the
Oilers to eliminate the Calgary Flames.
Chicago beat Minnesota 5-2 and Ed
monton ripped Calgary 9-1 to end those
series. The conference final probably will
begin Sunday in Edmonton.
In the other division finals, the New
>ork Islanders took a 3-2 lead in the Pa
trick Division with a convincing 7-2 de
cision over the New York Rangers, and
the Boston Bruins walloped the Buffalo
Sabres 9-0 to grab a 3-2 margin.
Those beries continue Friday night on
the home ice of the Rangers and Sabres.

Akeem may turn pro
Houston — Akeem Abdul Olajuwon,
the University of Houston's 7-foot center,
savs he would forfeit his collegiate
eligibility and enter the National Basket
ball Association draft if guaranteed he
would play in Houston, the Houston
Chronicle said in a copyright story
Wednesday.
Speculation about Olajuwon's future
has mounted since the NCAA playoffs
when when the Cougars lost in the final to
North Carolina State 54-52.
Olajuwon, a 20-year-old sophomore
from Nigeria, was named the tour
nament's outstanding player after compil
ing 41 points, 40 reboundsand 15 blocked
shots in the Final Four.
Professional scouts projected Ola
juwon would be among the top three
players taken in the NBA college draft
June 28. To be eligibile, Olajuwon would
have to renounce his amateur status by
May 14.
"If I could be sure I was going to stay in
Houston, I would come out," Olajuwon
told the Chronicle.
The Chronicle quoted sources as saying
Olajuwon met several times last week
with Lee Fentress, a Washington, D.C. at
torney who represents Philadelphia 7oers
center Moses Malone, a close friend and
confident of Olajuwon.
"It is a big decision and a difficult de
cision to make," Olajuwon said. "I will
definitely have to make the decision by
May 14, but I would really like to have it
done by May 12 or sooner."

Olajuwon said his decision rests partly
on teammate Clyde Drexler, a junior also
rated highly by pro scouts. Drexler has re
mained non-committal about his plans.
Olajuwon said he would not refuse to
play professionally somewhere besides
Houston.
The Rockets, with two of the first three
picks in the draft, have had their sights set
on Ralph Sampson, the 7-foot-4 center
from the University of Virginia.
Nolan goes after K record
Houston — Astros pitcher Nolan Ryan,
only strikeouts away from breaking
Walter Johnson's career strikeout record,
says the feat would rank only third on his
all-time list of accomplishments.
Ryan, who goes for the record Friday
night against Philadelphia, rates his five
career no-hitters and his major league
record 383 strikeouts in one season ahead
of cracking Johnson's 3,508 career whiffs.
"I'd say (career strikeout record) third
behind the fifth no-hitter because it
stands alone and the 383 strikeouts be
cause that one stands by itself," Ryan said.
"That year took a lot of consistency. There
were no pitchers involved in that which
makes it even more credible."
Ryan got his 383 strikeouts in one sea
son pitching for the 1973 California
Angels in the American League, which re
places the pitcher with a designated hit
ter. Ryan's fifth no-hitter came Sept. 26,
1981 in the Astrodome againstthe Los An
geles Dodgers.
