"Trust me."
— Kurt Russell in Used
Cars
Used Cars (1980) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Robert Zemeckis and Bob
Gale wrote this satire on the
American acquisitive spirit, and
Zemeckis directed it in a calcu
lated manic style that merges
old vaudeville routines and fast
cutting. There has probably
never been another comedy
that looks or moves quite like
this one, though its extravagant
cynicism is in a great literary
(Mark Twain) and cinematic
(Preston Sturges) tradition.
Michael Kahn, a wizard, did the
editing. The subject is the
American con man as used car
salesman, and Zemeckis found
three phenomenal actors to
play the heroes: Kurt Russell,
Gerrit Graham and Frank
Mcßae. With Jack Warden (in a
double role), Deborah Har
mon, Al Lewis, Harry Northrup,
Alfonso Arau, David L. Lander
and Michael McKean. Im
aginatively shot by Donald M.
Morgan.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Animal House (1978)
Memorial Auditorium
It has a few very funny gags,
but it does go on. Given the set
ting—a small college in 1962 —
John Landis' movie barely
scratches the surface potential
for parody, though the best
scene, at a neighboring wom
en's school called Emily
Dickinson College, where all
the students have long brown
hair and names like Fern
Leibowitz and Shelley
Dubinsky, is worthy of Woody
Allen. Aside from that, the best
reason to see the movie is John
Belushi. (Donald Sutherland
has an amusing cameo as a
stoned professor.) Harold
Ramis, Douglas Kenney and
Chris Miller wrote the script,
and Elmer Bernstein, trying
painfully hard to be playful,
came up with the score. With
Thomas Hulce, Tim Matheson,
John Vernon, Verna Bloom and
Peter Riegert.
Plays Sunday evening.
L'Avventura (1961) ★
Casa Italians
Monica Vitti's restless walk
on the beach might be the
emblem of Michelangelo Anto
nioni's masterpiece — the one
great film about the anomie
and alienation of the late '50s
and early '60s. The wealthy pro
tagonists are true drifters: noth
ing binds them to each other
for very long, and their tragedy
is that they can still feel the loss
of what was once important to
them (the capacity to find
meaning in their lives, perhaps,
or to hold onto it). Vitti issimply
magnificent in the central role
of Claudia, and Gabriele Ferzet
ti (as Sandro) and Lea Massari
(as Anna, the woman who dis
appears) give expert per
formances. This film may re
mind you of Renoir's The Rules
of the Came, a picture as closely
bound up with the last days
before the Second World War
as L'Avventura is with its era.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Shampoo (1975) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Robert Towne's script (which
Warren Beatty had a hand in),
directed by Hal Ashby, is the
closest American filmmakers
have ever come to something
like Renoir's Rules of the Game
or Bergmn's Smiles of a Sum
mer Night. The film takes place
in Beverly Hills, on the eve of
the Nixon period — just before
the frivolous, psychedelic
Southern Califoria of the Beatle
era passed into the stoned-psy
chotic Califoria of Manson and
Reagan.The metaphorical focal
point of the Beverly Hills life
style is the beauty shop; the

Don Juan hero, George
(Warren Beatty), is a hair
dresser. The plot is intricate and
ingenious, with overlapping
couplings filling the characters'
glitteringly empty lives as
smoke fills a room. The actors
— Beatty, Julie Christie, Goldie
Hawn, Jack Warden, Lee Grant
— give rich comic per
formances with tragic under
pinnings. (None of them has
ever been better.) The result
suggests L'Avventura played as
a Feydeau farce.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Winter of Our Dreams.
Rancho Notorious (1952)
Geology Corner, Room 320
Fritz Lang cultists rank this
Technicolor western high, but
it's fairly wretched, really —
there's nothing much going for
it outside of Hal Mohr's pho
tography, which features a
number of pretty sunsets and
ominously overcast skies. As
Altar Keane, who runs a horse
ranch called Chuck-a-Luck
where outlaws hide out (repay
ing her with 10 per cent of their
take), Marlene Dietrich gets to
wear a variety of outlandish
outfits, especially in the
flashbacks in the first half hour
of the picture. Her wardrobe is
so varied, in fact, that it seems
better suited to an entire com-

pany of actresses, and she has
trouble pasting the different
parts of her performance to
gether, too. (She's never been
worse.) Insanely, Lang cast
Arthur Kennedy as a tough
cowpuncher who finds Altar in
the midst of his search for the
bank robber who killed his
fiancee, and Mel Ferrer as a
dashing outlaw; he probably
would have fared better if he'd
relied on the extras at RKO. The
first third of the film is lively and
verges on cheerful self-parody,
but the rest is dreary. (Lang
must have been exhausted by
the time he got to the final
shoot-out, which is arguably
the most unimaginately staged
scene in any of his pictues.) Ken
Darby wrote the preposterous,
phony-robust theme song that
William Lee sings.
Plays tonight.
The Life of Oharu (1952)
Geology Corner, Room 320
Oharu, exiled for "miscon
duct with a person of a lower
rank," is sold to a lord to moth
er his heir (his wife is barren),
removed from his court after
she has performed that service,
and left to sink lower and lower
— from courtesan to prostitute
to beggar. Kenji Mizoguchi's
film took the Silver Lion at the
Venice Film Festival, but his
presentation of the outrages
this woman must endure from
the male-supremacist society
she lives in (17th-century Japan)
lacks subtlety — the movie is
practically a tract. In structure
and content, it's really a classy
version of an antique weeper

like Stella Dallas or Madame X,
but there are scenes of con
siderable power and some
beautifully expressive tableaux.
The compositions are more
memorable than the stylized
acting in the supporting roles
(even though the cast includes
Toshiro Mifune and Eitaro Shin
do). Kinuyo Tanaka's per
formance in the title role grows
stronger as the movie proceeds,
and there is a fine score by
Ichiro Saito.
Plays tomorrow evening.
On the Waterfront (1954)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Terry Malloy, has-been
fighter turned dock worker,
represented the smashed
dreams of a generation when
this film was released in the
mid-'sos, and there is still much
in this portrait of a decent, inex
pressive guy trying to deal with
the web of corruption he is
caught in to move audiences.

Crude as parts of Budd
Schulberg's script (out of his
novel) are, and despite Karl
Maiden's characteristic mug
ging in the role of the priest, the
movie still packs a hell of a
punch. As Terry, Marlon Bran
do gives his most amazing early
performance; one can just im
agine how audiences of the
time responded to those mag
netic Neanderthal looks and
the impassioned earnestness of
his acting. Eva Marie Saint and
Rod Steiger are excellent, but
Brando blows everyone else off
the screen. Directed by Elia
Kazan, whom every young ac
tor in America was dying to
work with (having discovered
Brando — for A Streetcar
Named Desire — he went on to
find )ames Dean), shot by Boris
Kaufman, and with a classic
Leonard Bernstein score.
Plays Thursday with All the
King's Men.
Lianna
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A hopscotch movie — good
and bad scenes, cliches and
fresh insights alternate straight
through. Lianna (Linda Grif
fiths) is married toa film instruc
tor, Dick (Jon De Vries) at a
small, incestuous East Coast col
lege; fed up with the life of a
faculty spouse, she enrolls in a
child psychology course taught
by a visiting professor, Ruth
(Jane Hallaren), who becomes
her lover. John Sayles wrote,
directed and edited this movie,
which is rewarding and memo
rable even when it's awful.
Dreadful, implausible encoun

ters are balanced by funny, off
beat passages — you can't guess
which moments Sayles is going
to pull off. He has a taste for ac
tors who don't come off as ac
tors on camera, and there are
good performances by Grif
fiths, Hallaren, Maggie Renzi
and Sayles himself; with others
(De Vries, Jo Henderson as
Lianna's best friend) the near
documentary style he is trying
for fails. Sayles isn't really a di
rector yet, but he's daring, and
he keeps pushing his writing
talents through.
Madame Bovary (1933) ★
Lagunita Dining Room & Larkin
West Lounge
Jean Renoir made this film of
the Gustave Flaubert novel be
tween two superb pictures with
contemporary Parisian settings,

Houdu Saved from Drowning
and Toni. Originally released in
a three-and-a-half-hour ver
sion, it was a commercial failure
and nearly half of it was cut.
One would dearly love to see
what the entire epic looked
like, because what remains is so
fine. Valentine Tessier gives a
first-rate performance in the ti
tle role, and Pierre Renoir plays
Charles.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
Tuesday (Larkin).
Local Hero ★
Park, Menlo Park
Utterly charming. That clever
minimalist comic actor, Peter
Riegert, plays an oil company
executive who flies to Scotland
to buy up a village so that his

firm can set up a refinery on the
land — and the village turns out
to be almost as magical as Briga
doon. Living in a breathtaking
landscape, under a showplace
sky where meteor showers
erupt and the aurora borealis
makes guest appearances, the
citizens have established an en
tirely peaceful, laissez-faire so
ciety where a very strange mix
of people co-exist harmo
niously. The Scottish writer-di
rector, Bill Forsyth, keeps his
camera at a discreet distance, so
that what happens up on screen
seems peculiarly self-con
tained, and the unrushed
scenes snap back at you with a
delayed comic spring. The cast
is impeccable; among its gems
are Denis Lawson, Peter
Capaldi, and especially Burt
Lancaster. He's only in a few
scenes (he plays the oil com
pany chief) but he embodies
the quirkily benevolent spirit of
the movie.
Hester Street (1975) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Far from a great film — the
acting is uneven and the editing
is crude — but a terribly appeal
ing one. Carol Kane is charming
as the young wife whose hus
band, now living in America,
sends back to the old country
for her and then finds her old
world ways an embarrassment.
In her debut picture, writer-di
rector Joan Micklin Silver
shows a talent for details of am
biance, and the informal feel
ing of the project works in her
favor. As her subsequent mov
ies have borne out, she knows a
great subject whenshe finds
one: of all the movies made
here and abroad about the im
migrant experience, this is the
only one that comes to mind
with a comic perspective. While
you're watching Carol Kane,
you may suspect that, good as
she is, her sweet, reticent per
sonality could become
tiresome, but Hester Street was
not a hit, and she hasn't had a

leading role since. Steven Keats
plays her impatient, philander
ing husband; Dorrie
Kavanaugh is the object of his
distraction; and Mel Howard is
her boarder.
Plays Sunday and Monday
with The Chosen.
Woman of the Year (1942)
Festival, Palo Alto
Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael
Kanin wrote this first vehicle for
Katharine Hepburn and
Spencer Tracy: she plays an in
ternational news columnist and
he is a sportswriter on the same
paper. Eventually, he brings her
down to earth, which may sour
the movie for some viewers.
Still, much of it is irresistible be
cause of the star chemistry, and
there is an uproarious scene in
which Hepburn, who has never
had to find her way around a
kitchen in her life, tries to make
breakfast for Tracy. George

Stevens directed. With a very
satisfying supporting cast (Fay
Bainter, Reginald Owen, Wil
liam Bendix, Dan Tobin, Roscoe
Karns).
Plays through Wednesday
with Holiday.
Winter of Our Dreams
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bryan Brown plays a one
time radical who now runs a
bookstore and shares an uneasy
open marriage with Cathy
Dowries. Judy Davis plays a
hooker addicted to dope but
striving to remake herself in the
image of a dead friend (a proba
ble suicide). Brown, an old
school pal and possibly a lover
of the dead woman's, repre
sents Davis's link to her; she
falls in love with him, but he re
fuses to respond. John Duigan's
movie is nostalgic for the '60s:
in the movie's terms, Rob's re
fusal constitutes a failure to re
vitalize himself. The movie is
sincere and not unintelligent,
but it has a soft center.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Shampoo.
The Night of the Shooting
Stars w
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Poetic and eruptive, Vittorio
and Paolo Taviani's film is the
most extraordinary movie any
one has made about war in
more than 20 years, and when
you try to think of other war
films with a comparably special
and complete vision, only a
handful come to mind — Birth
of a Nation, Grand Illusion, For
bidden Games, Fires on the
Plain. The Taviani brothers tell
the story of the flight of some of
the townspeople of San
Martino (in Tuscany) from the
Fascists in the final days before
the Italian liberation in August
of 1944. The narrator, Cecilia,
was six years old when it hap
pened, and is recalling her im
pressions, and so the movie is
scaled to a child's view of a
world in crisis: majestic, with
sudden, quirky shifts of tone
and startling reversals that are
often funny and horrifying at
the same time. You can't pin
down the style of this picture,
because it changes constantly
— from burlesque to tragedy,
to lament, to erotic fantasy, to
heroic romance — and it's all so
fresh that the Tavianis seem to
be finding their techniques as
they go along.

Memorial Auditorium
It has a few very funny gags,
but it does go on. Given the set
ting—a small college in 1962 —
John Landis' movie barely
scratches the surface potential
for parody, though the best
scene, at a neighboring wom
en's school called Emily
Dickinson College, where all
the students have long brown
hair and names like Fern
Leibowitz and Shelley
Dubinsky, is worthy of Woody
Allen. Aside from that, the best
reason to see the movie is John
Belushi. (Donald Sutherland
has an amusing cameo as a
stoned professor.) Harold
Ramis, Douglas Kenney and
Chris Miller wrote the script,
and Elmer Bernstein, trying
painfully hard to be playful,
came up with the score. With
Thomas Hulce, Tim Matheson,
John Vernon, Verna Bloom and
Peter Riegert.
Plays Sunday evening.
L'Avventura (1961) ★
Casa Italians
Monica Vitti's restless walk
on the beach might be the
emblem of Michelangelo Anto
nioni's masterpiece — the one
great film about the anomie
and alienation of the late '50s
and early '60s. The wealthy pro
tagonists are true drifters: noth
ing binds them to each other
for very long, and their tragedy
is that they can still feel the loss
of what was once important to
them (the capacity to find
meaning in their lives, perhaps,
or to hold onto it). Vitti issimply
magnificent in the central role
of Claudia, and Gabriele Ferzet
ti (as Sandro) and Lea Massari
(as Anna, the woman who dis
appears) give expert per
formances. This film may re
mind you of Renoir's The Rules
of the Came, a picture as closely
bound up with the last days
before the Second World War
as L'Avventura is with its era.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Shampoo (1975) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Robert Towne's script (which
Warren Beatty had a hand in),
directed by Hal Ashby, is the
closest American filmmakers
have ever come to something
like Renoir's Rules of the Game
or Bergmn's Smiles of a Sum
mer Night. The film takes place
in Beverly Hills, on the eve of
the Nixon period — just before
the frivolous, psychedelic
Southern Califoria of the Beatle
era passed into the stoned-psy
chotic Califoria of Manson and
Reagan.The metaphorical focal
point of the Beverly Hills life
style is the beauty shop; the

Don Juan hero, George
(Warren Beatty), is a hair
dresser. The plot is intricate and
ingenious, with overlapping
couplings filling the characters'
glitteringly empty lives as
smoke fills a room. The actors
— Beatty, Julie Christie, Goldie
Hawn, Jack Warden, Lee Grant
— give rich comic per
formances with tragic under
pinnings. (None of them has
ever been better.) The result
suggests L'Avventura played as
a Feydeau farce.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Winter of Our Dreams.
Rancho Notorious (1952)
Geology Corner, Room 320
Fritz Lang cultists rank this
Technicolor western high, but
it's fairly wretched, really —
there's nothing much going for
it outside of Hal Mohr's pho
tography, which features a
number of pretty sunsets and
ominously overcast skies. As
Altar Keane, who runs a horse
ranch called Chuck-a-Luck
where outlaws hide out (repay
ing her with 10 per cent of their
take), Marlene Dietrich gets to
wear a variety of outlandish
outfits, especially in the
flashbacks in the first half hour
of the picture. Her wardrobe is
so varied, in fact, that it seems
better suited to an entire com-

pany of actresses, and she has
trouble pasting the different
parts of her performance to
gether, too. (She's never been
worse.) Insanely, Lang cast
Arthur Kennedy as a tough
cowpuncher who finds Altar in
the midst of his search for the
bank robber who killed his
fiancee, and Mel Ferrer as a
dashing outlaw; he probably
would have fared better if he'd
relied on the extras at RKO. The
first third of the film is lively and
verges on cheerful self-parody,
but the rest is dreary. (Lang
must have been exhausted by
the time he got to the final
shoot-out, which is arguably
the most unimaginately staged
scene in any of his pictues.) Ken
Darby wrote the preposterous,
phony-robust theme song that
William Lee sings.

The Life of Oharu (1952)
Geology Corner, Room 320
Oharu, exiled for "miscon
duct with a person of a lower
rank," is sold to a lord to moth
er his heir (his wife is barren),
removed from his court after
she has performed that service,
and left to sink lower and lower
— from courtesan to prostitute
to beggar. Kenji Mizoguchi's
film took the Silver Lion at the
Venice Film Festival, but his
presentation of the outrages
this woman must endure from
the male-supremacist society
she lives in (17th-century Japan)
lacks subtlety — the movie is
practically a tract. In structure
and content, it's really a classy
version of an antique weeper

like Stella Dallas or Madame X,
but there are scenes of con
siderable power and some
beautifully expressive tableaux.
The compositions are more
memorable than the stylized
acting in the supporting roles
(even though the cast includes
Toshiro Mifune and Eitaro Shin
do). Kinuyo Tanaka's per
formance in the title role grows
stronger as the movie proceeds,
and there is a fine score by
Ichiro Saito.
Plays tomorrow evening.
On the Waterfront (1954)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Terry Malloy, has-been
fighter turned dock worker,
represented the smashed
dreams of a generation when
this film was released in the
mid-'sos, and there is still much
in this portrait of a decent, inex
pressive guy trying to deal with
the web of corruption he is
caught in to move audiences.

Crude as parts of Budd
Schulberg's script (out of his
novel) are, and despite Karl
Maiden's characteristic mug
ging in the role of the priest, the
movie still packs a hell of a
punch. As Terry, Marlon Bran
do gives his most amazing early
performance; one can just im
agine how audiences of the
time responded to those mag
netic Neanderthal looks and
the impassioned earnestness of
his acting. Eva Marie Saint and
Rod Steiger are excellent, but
Brando blows everyone else off
the screen. Directed by Elia
Kazan, whom every young ac
tor in America was dying to
work with (having discovered
Brando — for A Streetcar
Named Desire — he went on to
find )ames Dean), shot by Boris
Kaufman, and with a classic

Lianna
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A hopscotch movie — good
and bad scenes, cliches and
fresh insights alternate straight
through. Lianna (Linda Grif
fiths) is married toa film instruc
tor, Dick (Jon De Vries) at a
small, incestuous East Coast col
lege; fed up with the life of a
faculty spouse, she enrolls in a
child psychology course taught
by a visiting professor, Ruth
(Jane Hallaren), who becomes
her lover. John Sayles wrote,
directed and edited this movie,
which is rewarding and memo
rable even when it's awful.
Dreadful, implausible encoun

ters are balanced by funny, off
beat passages — you can't guess
which moments Sayles is going
to pull off. He has a taste for ac
tors who don't come off as ac
tors on camera, and there are
good performances by Grif
fiths, Hallaren, Maggie Renzi
and Sayles himself; with others
(De Vries, Jo Henderson as
Lianna's best friend) the near
documentary style he is trying
for fails. Sayles isn't really a di
rector yet, but he's daring, and
he keeps pushing his writing
talents through.
Madame Bovary (1933) ★
Lagunita Dining Room & Larkin
West Lounge
Jean Renoir made this film of
the Gustave Flaubert novel be

contemporary Parisian settings,

Houdu Saved from Drowning
and Toni. Originally released in
a three-and-a-half-hour ver
sion, it was a commercial failure
and nearly half of it was cut.
One would dearly love to see

first-rate performance in the ti

Plays Monday (Lagunita) and

Local Hero ★
Park, Menlo Park
Utterly charming. That clever
minimalist comic actor, Peter
Riegert, plays an oil company
executive who flies to Scotland
to buy up a village so that his

firm can set up a refinery on the
land — and the village turns out
to be almost as magical as Briga
doon. Living in a breathtaking
landscape, under a showplace
sky where meteor showers
erupt and the aurora borealis
makes guest appearances, the
citizens have established an en
tirely peaceful, laissez-faire so
ciety where a very strange mix
of people co-exist harmo
niously. The Scottish writer-di
rector, Bill Forsyth, keeps his
camera at a discreet distance, so
that what happens up on screen
seems peculiarly self-con
tained, and the unrushed
scenes snap back at you with a
delayed comic spring. The cast
is impeccable; among its gems
are Denis Lawson, Peter
Capaldi, and especially Burt
Lancaster. He's only in a few
scenes (he plays the oil com
pany chief) but he embodies
the quirkily benevolent spirit of
the movie.
Hester Street (1975) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Far from a great film — the
acting is uneven and the editing
is crude — but a terribly appeal
ing one. Carol Kane is charming
as the young wife whose hus
band, now living in America,
sends back to the old country
for her and then finds her old
world ways an embarrassment.
In her debut picture, writer-di
rector Joan Micklin Silver
shows a talent for details of am
biance, and the informal feel
ing of the project works in her
favor. As her subsequent mov
ies have borne out, she knows a
great subject whenshe finds
one: of all the movies made
here and abroad about the im
migrant experience, this is the
only one that comes to mind
with a comic perspective. While
you're watching Carol Kane,
you may suspect that, good as
she is, her sweet, reticent per

tiresome, but Hester Street was
not a hit, and she hasn't had a

Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael
Kanin wrote this first vehicle for
Katharine Hepburn and
Spencer Tracy: she plays an in
ternational news columnist and
he is a sportswriter on the same
paper. Eventually, he brings her
down to earth, which may sour
the movie for some viewers.
Still, much of it is irresistible be
cause of the star chemistry, and
there is an uproarious scene in
which Hepburn, who has never
had to find her way around a
kitchen in her life, tries to make
breakfast for Tracy. George

Plays through Wednesday

Winter of Our Dreams
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bryan Brown plays a one
time radical who now runs a
bookstore and shares an uneasy
open marriage with Cathy
Dowries. Judy Davis plays a
hooker addicted to dope but
striving to remake herself in the
image of a dead friend (a proba
ble suicide). Brown, an old
school pal and possibly a lover
of the dead woman's, repre
sents Davis's link to her; she
falls in love with him, but he re
fuses to respond. John Duigan's
movie is nostalgic for the '60s:
in the movie's terms, Rob's re
fusal constitutes a failure to re
vitalize himself. The movie is
sincere and not unintelligent,
but it has a soft center.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes

The Night of the Shooting
Stars w
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Poetic and eruptive, Vittorio
and Paolo Taviani's film is the
most extraordinary movie any
one has made about war in
more than 20 years, and when
you try to think of other war
films with a comparably special
and complete vision, only a
handful come to mind — Birth
of a Nation, Grand Illusion, For
bidden Games, Fires on the
Plain. The Taviani brothers tell
the story of the flight of some of
the townspeople of San
Martino (in Tuscany) from the
Fascists in the final days before
the Italian liberation in August
of 1944. The narrator, Cecilia,
was six years old when it hap
pened, and is recalling her im
pressions, and so the movie is
scaled to a child's view of a
world in crisis: majestic, with
sudden, quirky shifts of tone
and startling reversals that are
often funny and horrifying at
the same time. You can't pin
down the style of this picture,
because it changes constantly
— from burlesque to tragedy,
to lament, to erotic fantasy, to
heroic romance — and it's all so
fresh that the Tavianis seem to
be finding their techniques as
they go along.

great film about the anomie

ing binds them to each other
for very long, and their tragedy
is that they can still feel the loss
of what was once important to
them (the capacity to find
meaning in their lives, perhaps,
or to hold onto it). Vitti issimply
magnificent in the central role
of Claudia, and Gabriele Ferzet
ti (as Sandro) and Lea Massari
(as Anna, the woman who dis
appears) give expert per
formances. This film may re
mind you of Renoir's The Rules
of the Came, a picture as closely
bound up with the last days
before the Second World War
as L'Avventura is with its era.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Shampoo (1975) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Robert Towne's script (which
Warren Beatty had a hand in),
directed by Hal Ashby, is the
closest American filmmakers
have ever come to something
like Renoir's Rules of the Game
or Bergmn's Smiles of a Sum
mer Night. The film takes place
in Beverly Hills, on the eve of
the Nixon period — just before
the frivolous, psychedelic
Southern Califoria of the Beatle
era passed into the stoned-psy
chotic Califoria of Manson and
Reagan.The metaphorical focal
point of the Beverly Hills life
style is the beauty shop; the

Don Juan hero, George
(Warren Beatty), is a hair
dresser. The plot is intricate and
ingenious, with overlapping
couplings filling the characters'
glitteringly empty lives as
smoke fills a room. The actors
— Beatty, Julie Christie, Goldie
Hawn, Jack Warden, Lee Grant
— give rich comic per
formances with tragic under
pinnings. (None of them has
ever been better.) The result
suggests L'Avventura played as
a Feydeau farce.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Winter of Our Dreams.
Rancho Notorious (1952)
Geology Corner, Room 320
Fritz Lang cultists rank this
Technicolor western high, but
it's fairly wretched, really —
there's nothing much going for
it outside of Hal Mohr's pho
tography, which features a
number of pretty sunsets and
ominously overcast skies. As
Altar Keane, who runs a horse
ranch called Chuck-a-Luck
where outlaws hide out (repay
ing her with 10 per cent of their
take), Marlene Dietrich gets to
wear a variety of outlandish
outfits, especially in the
flashbacks in the first half hour
of the picture. Her wardrobe is
so varied, in fact, that it seems
better suited to an entire com-

pany of actresses, and she has
trouble pasting the different
parts of her performance to
gether, too. (She's never been
worse.) Insanely, Lang cast
Arthur Kennedy as a tough
cowpuncher who finds Altar in
the midst of his search for the
bank robber who killed his
fiancee, and Mel Ferrer as a
dashing outlaw; he probably
would have fared better if he'd
relied on the extras at RKO. The
first third of the film is lively and
verges on cheerful self-parody,
but the rest is dreary. (Lang
must have been exhausted by
the time he got to the final
shoot-out, which is arguably
the most unimaginately staged
scene in any of his pictues.) Ken
Darby wrote the preposterous,
phony-robust theme song that
William Lee sings.
Plays tonight.
The Life of Oharu (1952)
Geology Corner, Room 320
Oharu, exiled for "miscon
duct with a person of a lower
rank," is sold to a lord to moth
er his heir (his wife is barren),
removed from his court after
she has performed that service,
and left to sink lower and lower
— from courtesan to prostitute
to beggar. Kenji Mizoguchi's
film took the Silver Lion at the
Venice Film Festival, but his
presentation of the outrages
this woman must endure from
the male-supremacist society
she lives in (17th-century Japan)
lacks subtlety — the movie is
practically a tract. In structure
and content, it's really a classy
version of an antique weeper

like Stella Dallas or Madame X,
but there are scenes of con
siderable power and some
beautifully expressive tableaux.
The compositions are more
memorable than the stylized
acting in the supporting roles
(even though the cast includes
Toshiro Mifune and Eitaro Shin
do). Kinuyo Tanaka's per
formance in the title role grows
stronger as the movie proceeds,
and there is a fine score by
Ichiro Saito.
Plays tomorrow evening.
On the Waterfront (1954)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Terry Malloy, has-been
fighter turned dock worker,
represented the smashed
dreams of a generation when
this film was released in the
mid-'sos, and there is still much
in this portrait of a decent, inex
pressive guy trying to deal with
the web of corruption he is
caught in to move audiences.

Crude as parts of Budd
Schulberg's script (out of his
novel) are, and despite Karl
Maiden's characteristic mug
ging in the role of the priest, the
movie still packs a hell of a
punch. As Terry, Marlon Bran
do gives his most amazing early
performance; one can just im
agine how audiences of the
time responded to those mag
netic Neanderthal looks and
the impassioned earnestness of
his acting. Eva Marie Saint and
Rod Steiger are excellent, but
Brando blows everyone else off
the screen. Directed by Elia
Kazan, whom every young ac
tor in America was dying to
work with (having discovered
Brando — for A Streetcar
Named Desire — he went on to
find )ames Dean), shot by Boris
Kaufman, and with a classic

Lianna
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A hopscotch movie — good
and bad scenes, cliches and
fresh insights alternate straight
through. Lianna (Linda Grif
fiths) is married toa film instruc
tor, Dick (Jon De Vries) at a
small, incestuous East Coast col
lege; fed up with the life of a
faculty spouse, she enrolls in a
child psychology course taught
by a visiting professor, Ruth
(Jane Hallaren), who becomes
her lover. John Sayles wrote,
directed and edited this movie,
which is rewarding and memo
rable even when it's awful.
Dreadful, implausible encoun

ters are balanced by funny, off
beat passages — you can't guess
which moments Sayles is going
to pull off. He has a taste for ac
tors who don't come off as ac
tors on camera, and there are
good performances by Grif
fiths, Hallaren, Maggie Renzi
and Sayles himself; with others
(De Vries, Jo Henderson as
Lianna's best friend) the near
documentary style he is trying
for fails. Sayles isn't really a di
rector yet, but he's daring, and
he keeps pushing his writing
talents through.
Madame Bovary (1933) ★
Lagunita Dining Room & Larkin

Jean Renoir made this film of
the Gustave Flaubert novel be

contemporary Parisian settings,

Houdu Saved from Drowning

a three-and-a-half-hour ver
sion, it was a commercial failure
and nearly half of it was cut.
One would dearly love to see

fine. Valentine Tessier gives a
first-rate performance in the ti

Charles.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and

Local Hero ★
Park, Menlo Park
Utterly charming. That clever
minimalist comic actor, Peter
Riegert, plays an oil company
executive who flies to Scotland
to buy up a village so that his

firm can set up a refinery on the
land — and the village turns out
to be almost as magical as Briga
doon. Living in a breathtaking
landscape, under a showplace
sky where meteor showers
erupt and the aurora borealis
makes guest appearances, the
citizens have established an en
tirely peaceful, laissez-faire so
ciety where a very strange mix
of people co-exist harmo
niously. The Scottish writer-di
rector, Bill Forsyth, keeps his
camera at a discreet distance, so
that what happens up on screen
seems peculiarly self-con
tained, and the unrushed
scenes snap back at you with a
delayed comic spring. The cast
is impeccable; among its gems
are Denis Lawson, Peter
Capaldi, and especially Burt
Lancaster. He's only in a few
scenes (he plays the oil com
pany chief) but he embodies
the quirkily benevolent spirit of
the movie.
Hester Street (1975) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Far from a great film — the
acting is uneven and the editing
is crude — but a terribly appeal
ing one. Carol Kane is charming
as the young wife whose hus
band, now living in America,
sends back to the old country
for her and then finds her old
world ways an embarrassment.
In her debut picture, writer-di
rector Joan Micklin Silver
shows a talent for details of am
biance, and the informal feel
ing of the project works in her
favor. As her subsequent mov
ies have borne out, she knows a
great subject whenshe finds
one: of all the movies made
here and abroad about the im
migrant experience, this is the
only one that comes to mind
with a comic perspective. While
you're watching Carol Kane,
you may suspect that, good as
she is, her sweet, reticent per

tiresome, but Hester Street was

Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael
Kanin wrote this first vehicle for
Katharine Hepburn and
Spencer Tracy: she plays an in
ternational news columnist and
he is a sportswriter on the same
paper. Eventually, he brings her
down to earth, which may sour
the movie for some viewers.
Still, much of it is irresistible be
cause of the star chemistry, and
there is an uproarious scene in
which Hepburn, who has never
had to find her way around a
kitchen in her life, tries to make
breakfast for Tracy. George

Stevens directed. With a very

Plays through Wednesday

Winter of Our Dreams
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bryan Brown plays a one
time radical who now runs a
bookstore and shares an uneasy
open marriage with Cathy
Dowries. Judy Davis plays a
hooker addicted to dope but
striving to remake herself in the
image of a dead friend (a proba
ble suicide). Brown, an old
school pal and possibly a lover
of the dead woman's, repre
sents Davis's link to her; she
falls in love with him, but he re
fuses to respond. John Duigan's
movie is nostalgic for the '60s:
in the movie's terms, Rob's re
fusal constitutes a failure to re
vitalize himself. The movie is
sincere and not unintelligent,
but it has a soft center.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes

The Night of the Shooting
Stars w
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Poetic and eruptive, Vittorio
and Paolo Taviani's film is the
most extraordinary movie any
one has made about war in
more than 20 years, and when
you try to think of other war
films with a comparably special
and complete vision, only a
handful come to mind — Birth
of a Nation, Grand Illusion, For
bidden Games, Fires on the
Plain. The Taviani brothers tell
the story of the flight of some of
the townspeople of San
Martino (in Tuscany) from the
Fascists in the final days before
the Italian liberation in August
of 1944. The narrator, Cecilia,
was six years old when it hap
pened, and is recalling her im
pressions, and so the movie is
scaled to a child's view of a
world in crisis: majestic, with
sudden, quirky shifts of tone
and startling reversals that are
often funny and horrifying at
the same time. You can't pin
down the style of this picture,
because it changes constantly
— from burlesque to tragedy,
to lament, to erotic fantasy, to
heroic romance — and it's all so
fresh that the Tavianis seem to
be finding their techniques as
they go along.

Robert Zemeckis and Bob

scene, at a neighboring wom

closest American filmmakers
have ever come to something
like Renoir's Rules of the Game
or Bergmn's Smiles of a Sum
mer Night. The film takes place
in Beverly Hills, on the eve of
the Nixon period — just before
the frivolous, psychedelic
Southern Califoria of the Beatle
era passed into the stoned-psy
chotic Califoria of Manson and
Reagan.The metaphorical focal
point of the Beverly Hills life
style is the beauty shop; the

Don Juan hero, George
(Warren Beatty), is a hair
dresser. The plot is intricate and
ingenious, with overlapping
couplings filling the characters'
glitteringly empty lives as
smoke fills a room. The actors
— Beatty, Julie Christie, Goldie
Hawn, Jack Warden, Lee Grant
— give rich comic per
formances with tragic under
pinnings. (None of them has
ever been better.) The result
suggests L'Avventura played as
a Feydeau farce.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes

Rancho Notorious (1952)
Geology Corner, Room 320
Fritz Lang cultists rank this
Technicolor western high, but
it's fairly wretched, really —
there's nothing much going for
it outside of Hal Mohr's pho
tography, which features a
number of pretty sunsets and
ominously overcast skies. As
Altar Keane, who runs a horse
ranch called Chuck-a-Luck
where outlaws hide out (repay
ing her with 10 per cent of their
take), Marlene Dietrich gets to
wear a variety of outlandish
outfits, especially in the
flashbacks in the first half hour
of the picture. Her wardrobe is
so varied, in fact, that it seems
better suited to an entire com-

pany of actresses, and she has
trouble pasting the different
parts of her performance to
gether, too. (She's never been
worse.) Insanely, Lang cast
Arthur Kennedy as a tough
cowpuncher who finds Altar in
the midst of his search for the
bank robber who killed his
fiancee, and Mel Ferrer as a
dashing outlaw; he probably
would have fared better if he'd
relied on the extras at RKO. The
first third of the film is lively and
verges on cheerful self-parody,
but the rest is dreary. (Lang
must have been exhausted by
the time he got to the final
shoot-out, which is arguably
the most unimaginately staged
scene in any of his pictues.) Ken
Darby wrote the preposterous,
phony-robust theme song that
William Lee sings.
Plays tonight.
The Life of Oharu (1952)
Geology Corner, Room 320
Oharu, exiled for "miscon
duct with a person of a lower
rank," is sold to a lord to moth
er his heir (his wife is barren),
removed from his court after
she has performed that service,
and left to sink lower and lower
— from courtesan to prostitute
to beggar. Kenji Mizoguchi's
film took the Silver Lion at the
Venice Film Festival, but his
presentation of the outrages
this woman must endure from
the male-supremacist society
she lives in (17th-century Japan)
lacks subtlety — the movie is
practically a tract. In structure
and content, it's really a classy
version of an antique weeper

like Stella Dallas or Madame X,
but there are scenes of con
siderable power and some
beautifully expressive tableaux.
The compositions are more
memorable than the stylized
acting in the supporting roles
(even though the cast includes
Toshiro Mifune and Eitaro Shin
do). Kinuyo Tanaka's per
formance in the title role grows
stronger as the movie proceeds,
and there is a fine score by
Ichiro Saito.
Plays tomorrow evening.
On the Waterfront (1954)
New Varsity, Palo Alto ★
Terry Malloy, has-been
fighter turned dock worker,
represented the smashed
dreams of a generation when
this film was released in the
mid-'sos, and there is still much
in this portrait of a decent, inex
pressive guy trying to deal with
the web of corruption he is
caught in to move audiences.

Crude as parts of Budd
Schulberg's script (out of his
novel) are, and despite Karl
Maiden's characteristic mug
ging in the role of the priest, the
movie still packs a hell of a
punch. As Terry, Marlon Bran
do gives his most amazing early
performance; one can just im
agine how audiences of the
time responded to those mag
netic Neanderthal looks and
the impassioned earnestness of
his acting. Eva Marie Saint and
Rod Steiger are excellent, but
Brando blows everyone else off
the screen. Directed by Elia
Kazan, whom every young ac
tor in America was dying to
work with (having discovered
Brando — for A Streetcar
Named Desire — he went on to
find )ames Dean), shot by Boris
Kaufman, and with a classic

Lianna
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A hopscotch movie — good
and bad scenes, cliches and
fresh insights alternate straight
through. Lianna (Linda Grif
fiths) is married toa film instruc
tor, Dick (Jon De Vries) at a
small, incestuous East Coast col
lege; fed up with the life of a
faculty spouse, she enrolls in a
child psychology course taught
by a visiting professor, Ruth
(Jane Hallaren), who becomes
her lover. John Sayles wrote,
directed and edited this movie,
which is rewarding and memo
rable even when it's awful.
Dreadful, implausible encoun

ters are balanced by funny, off
beat passages — you can't guess
which moments Sayles is going
to pull off. He has a taste for ac
tors who don't come off as ac
tors on camera, and there are
good performances by Grif
fiths, Hallaren, Maggie Renzi
and Sayles himself; with others
(De Vries, Jo Henderson as
Lianna's best friend) the near
documentary style he is trying
for fails. Sayles isn't really a di
rector yet, but he's daring, and
he keeps pushing his writing
talents through.
Madame Bovary (1933) ★
Lagunita Dining Room & Larkin
West Lounge
Jean Renoir made this film of
the Gustave Flaubert novel be
tween two superb pictures with
contemporary Parisian settings,

Houdu Saved from Drowning
and Toni. Originally released in
a three-and-a-half-hour ver
sion, it was a commercial failure
and nearly half of it was cut.
One would dearly love to see
what the entire epic looked

fine. Valentine Tessier gives a
first-rate performance in the ti
tle role, and Pierre Renoir plays
Charles.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and

Local Hero ★
Park, Menlo Park
Utterly charming. That clever
minimalist comic actor, Peter
Riegert, plays an oil company
executive who flies to Scotland
to buy up a village so that his

firm can set up a refinery on the
land — and the village turns out
to be almost as magical as Briga
doon. Living in a breathtaking
landscape, under a showplace
sky where meteor showers
erupt and the aurora borealis
makes guest appearances, the
citizens have established an en
tirely peaceful, laissez-faire so
ciety where a very strange mix
of people co-exist harmo
niously. The Scottish writer-di
rector, Bill Forsyth, keeps his
camera at a discreet distance, so
that what happens up on screen
seems peculiarly self-con
tained, and the unrushed
scenes snap back at you with a
delayed comic spring. The cast
is impeccable; among its gems
are Denis Lawson, Peter
Capaldi, and especially Burt
Lancaster. He's only in a few
scenes (he plays the oil com
pany chief) but he embodies
the quirkily benevolent spirit of
the movie.
Hester Street (1975) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Far from a great film — the
acting is uneven and the editing
is crude — but a terribly appeal
ing one. Carol Kane is charming
as the young wife whose hus
band, now living in America,
sends back to the old country
for her and then finds her old
world ways an embarrassment.
In her debut picture, writer-di
rector Joan Micklin Silver
shows a talent for details of am
biance, and the informal feel
ing of the project works in her
favor. As her subsequent mov
ies have borne out, she knows a
great subject whenshe finds
one: of all the movies made
here and abroad about the im
migrant experience, this is the
only one that comes to mind
with a comic perspective. While
you're watching Carol Kane,
you may suspect that, good as
she is, her sweet, reticent per
sonality could become
tiresome, but Hester Street was
not a hit, and she hasn't had a

Woman of the Year (1942)
Festival, Palo Alto
Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael
Kanin wrote this first vehicle for
Katharine Hepburn and
Spencer Tracy: she plays an in
ternational news columnist and
he is a sportswriter on the same
paper. Eventually, he brings her
down to earth, which may sour
the movie for some viewers.
Still, much of it is irresistible be
cause of the star chemistry, and
there is an uproarious scene in
which Hepburn, who has never
had to find her way around a
kitchen in her life, tries to make
breakfast for Tracy. George

Stevens directed. With a very
satisfying supporting cast (Fay
Bainter, Reginald Owen, Wil
liam Bendix, Dan Tobin, Roscoe
Karns).
Plays through Wednesday
with Holiday.
Winter of Our Dreams
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bryan Brown plays a one
time radical who now runs a
bookstore and shares an uneasy
open marriage with Cathy
Dowries. Judy Davis plays a
hooker addicted to dope but
striving to remake herself in the
image of a dead friend (a proba
ble suicide). Brown, an old
school pal and possibly a lover
of the dead woman's, repre
sents Davis's link to her; she
falls in love with him, but he re
fuses to respond. John Duigan's
movie is nostalgic for the '60s:
in the movie's terms, Rob's re
fusal constitutes a failure to re
vitalize himself. The movie is
sincere and not unintelligent,
but it has a soft center.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Shampoo.
The Night of the Shooting
Stars w
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Poetic and eruptive, Vittorio
and Paolo Taviani's film is the
most extraordinary movie any
one has made about war in
more than 20 years, and when
you try to think of other war
films with a comparably special
and complete vision, only a
handful come to mind — Birth
of a Nation, Grand Illusion, For
bidden Games, Fires on the
Plain. The Taviani brothers tell
the story of the flight of some of
the townspeople of San
Martino (in Tuscany) from the
Fascists in the final days before
the Italian liberation in August
of 1944. The narrator, Cecilia,
was six years old when it hap
pened, and is recalling her im
pressions, and so the movie is
scaled to a child's view of a
world in crisis: majestic, with
sudden, quirky shifts of tone
and startling reversals that are
often funny and horrifying at
the same time. You can't pin
down the style of this picture,
because it changes constantly
— from burlesque to tragedy,
to lament, to erotic fantasy, to
heroic romance — and it's all so
fresh that the Tavianis seem to
be finding their techniques as
they go along.

"Trust me."

Cars
Used Cars (1980) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Robert Zemeckis and Bob
Gale wrote this satire on the
American acquisitive spirit, and
Zemeckis directed it in a calcu
lated manic style that merges
old vaudeville routines and fast
cutting. There has probably
never been another comedy
that looks or moves quite like
this one, though its extravagant
cynicism is in a great literary
(Mark Twain) and cinematic
(Preston Sturges) tradition.
Michael Kahn, a wizard, did the
editing. The subject is the
American con man as used car
salesman, and Zemeckis found
three phenomenal actors to
play the heroes: Kurt Russell,
Gerrit Graham and Frank
Mcßae. With Jack Warden (in a
double role), Deborah Har
mon, Al Lewis, Harry Northrup,
Alfonso Arau, David L. Lander
and Michael McKean. Im
aginatively shot by Donald M.
Morgan.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Animal House (1978)
Memorial Auditorium
It has a few very funny gags,
but it does go on. Given the set
ting—a small college in 1962 —
John Landis' movie barely
scratches the surface potential
for parody, though the best
scene, at a neighboring wom
en's school called Emily
Dickinson College, where all
the students have long brown
hair and names like Fern
Leibowitz and Shelley
Dubinsky, is worthy of Woody
Allen. Aside from that, the best
reason to see the movie is John
Belushi. (Donald Sutherland
has an amusing cameo as a
stoned professor.) Harold
Ramis, Douglas Kenney and
Chris Miller wrote the script,
and Elmer Bernstein, trying
painfully hard to be playful,
came up with the score. With
Thomas Hulce, Tim Matheson,
John Vernon, Verna Bloom and
Peter Riegert.
Plays Sunday evening.
L'Avventura (1961) ★
Casa Italians
Monica Vitti's restless walk
on the beach might be the
emblem of Michelangelo Anto
nioni's masterpiece — the one
great film about the anomie
and alienation of the late '50s
and early '60s. The wealthy pro
tagonists are true drifters: noth
ing binds them to each other
for very long, and their tragedy
is that they can still feel the loss
of what was once important to
them (the capacity to find
meaning in their lives, perhaps,
or to hold onto it). Vitti issimply
magnificent in the central role
of Claudia, and Gabriele Ferzet
ti (as Sandro) and Lea Massari
(as Anna, the woman who dis
appears) give expert per
formances. This film may re
mind you of Renoir's The Rules
of the Came, a picture as closely
bound up with the last days
before the Second World War
as L'Avventura is with its era.
Plays Wednesday evening.
