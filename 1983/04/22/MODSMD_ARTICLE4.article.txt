# Ex-ambassador: U.S.-USSR relations 'dangerous'
## 
### RANDY BROBERG Staff writer 
Relations between the United States and the
Soviet Union are "adversarial, competitive and
dangerous," said Walter Stoessel, former
undersecretary of state for political affairs, at a
speech given here last night. But the United
States must avoid "harsh rhetoric. . . . We
must negotiate, negotiate, negotiate."
Stoessel, a Stanford alumnus who was U.S.
Ambassador to Moscow, Warsaw and Bonn,
served as acting secretary of state in the
interim between the resignation of former Sec.
of State Alexander Haig and the confirmation
of Sec. of State George Shultz.
In an exclusive interview after hisspeech to a
Tresidder audience of 175 people, Stoessel
concluded that "though the spirit of Solidarity
will remain, as an organization it is finished."
In response to a question about the deploy

ment of Pershing lis and Cruise Missiles in
Germany scheduled for late this year, Stoessel
said, "NATO will be able to deploy the mis
siles, in spite of domestic opposition." How
ever, he expressed optimism that "our deter
mination to do it may bring the Soviets to offer
an agreement at five minute* to midnight."
Stoessel said, "Russia cannot escape its his
tory . . . which has displayed an expansionist,
messianic tendency. Although the Soviet
Union has conventional superiority, nuclear
superiority in Europe . . . and in Asia, and nu
clear superiority over the United States in
some areas, the Soviets are plagued with a
national inferiority complex, a yearning for
legitimacy and a desire to be treated as an
equal."
Warning against what many see as a failure
of the Reagan administration's current policy,
Stoessel said, "the United States should not

pursue a policy of economic warfare against
the Soviet Union. . . . We must avoid giving
subsidies and credits to the Soviet Union. . . .
We must control technology transfers, but we
must not try to collapse the Soviet Union
through economic pressure." Stoessel cau
tioned, however, that the Soviet Union "is not
to be treated as just another country."
Stoessel stressed that two important ingre
dients of a proper American policy toward the
Soviet Union are steady firmness and consulta
tion with our allies. "We must recognize that
the basic requirement is to be strong; econom
ically, socially and politically. . . . The Soviets
respected the strength of (former President)
Nixon.
"Our consultation with our European allies
has been successful on the Intermediate Nu
clear Force issue. There have been meaningful
