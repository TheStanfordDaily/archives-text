# Ex-ambassador: U.S.-USSR relations 'dangerous'
## 
### RANDY BROBERG Staff writer 
Relations between the United States and the
Soviet Union are "adversarial, competitive and
dangerous," said Walter Stoessel, former
undersecretary of state for political affairs, at a
speech given here last night. But the United
States must avoid "harsh rhetoric. . . . We
must negotiate, negotiate, negotiate."
Stoessel, a Stanford alumnus who was U.S.
Ambassador to Moscow, Warsaw and Bonn,
served as acting secretary of state in the
interim between the resignation of former Sec.
of State Alexander Haig and the confirmation
of Sec. of State George Shultz.
In an exclusive interview after hisspeech to a
Tresidder audience of 175 people, Stoessel
concluded that "though the spirit of Solidarity
will remain, as an organization it is finished."
In response to a question about the deploy

ment of Pershing lis and Cruise Missiles in
Germany scheduled for late this year, Stoessel
said, "NATO will be able to deploy the mis
siles, in spite of domestic opposition." How
ever, he expressed optimism that "our deter
mination to do it may bring the Soviets to offer
an agreement at five minute* to midnight."
Stoessel said, "Russia cannot escape its his
tory . . . which has displayed an expansionist,
messianic tendency. Although the Soviet
Union has conventional superiority, nuclear
superiority in Europe . . . and in Asia, and nu
clear superiority over the United States in
some areas, the Soviets are plagued with a
national inferiority complex, a yearning for
legitimacy and a desire to be treated as an
equal."
Warning against what many see as a failure
of the Reagan administration's current policy,
Stoessel said, "the United States should not

pursue a policy of economic warfare against
the Soviet Union. . . . We must avoid giving
subsidies and credits to the Soviet Union. . . .
We must control technology transfers, but we
must not try to collapse the Soviet Union
through economic pressure." Stoessel cau
tioned, however, that the Soviet Union "is not
to be treated as just another country."
Stoessel stressed that two important ingre
dients of a proper American policy toward the
Soviet Union are steady firmness and consulta
tion with our allies. "We must recognize that
the basic requirement is to be strong; econom
ically, socially and politically. . . . The Soviets
respected the strength of (former President)
Nixon.
"Our consultation with our European allies
has been successful on the Intermediate Nu
clear Force issue. There have been meaningful

and thorough negotiations. There is allied agreement
about the reality of the Soviet threat and the necessity of
a response and of negotiations."
Although he has met Soviet leader Yuri Andropov
several times, Stoessel has not had a chance to have an
extended conversation with him. "Andropov is cruel,
tough and unromantic," said Stoessel, who continued,
"Andropov is not the undisputed boss of the Soviet
Union; he must rule by consensus; his flexibility is lim
ited." Stoessel suggested there is still a "good deal of
maneuvering backstage.'
Stoessel has retired from the State Department and is
currently serving in Washington as the head of the
Soviet Studies Program of the United Nations Council of
the United States. In concluding his speech, he said,
"the United States can never have a genuine friendship
with the Soviet Union, but at the same time we cannot go
to war." After the speech, Stoessel stressed that this is
not a period of Cold War with the Soviets despite the
harsh rhetoric between the nations.
Stoessel is here to participate in a conference spon
sored by the International Relations Program. His lec
ture was titled "The United States Faces the Soviet
Union." Strobe Talbott, diplomatic correspondent for
Time, also participated last night.
Talbott reacted to Stoessel's speech by saying, "the
Reagan administration policy toward the Soviet Union is
implacable , militant and visceral. . . . There is precious

little pragmatism or ingenuity in this administration."
Talbott also said he believes the Reagan arms control
policy is a "sham'' and that Reagan wants to "speak
loudly about how big the other guy's stick is."
Coit Blacker, director of the Stanford Arms Control
Program, and Condolezza Rice, also of the Stanford
Arms Control Program, also offered their comments
during a panel discussion. Both Blacker and Rice agreed
that a pragmatic policy must be pursued. But Blacker
said, "It is important to remember that the Soviet Union
does not see the United States as 'just another country'
either."
Rice reminded the audience, "The United States can't
fall into the trap of playing the game the way the Soviets
play it. . . to necessarily respond to big missiles with big
missiles."
According to Alexander Dallin, chairman of the Inter
national Relations Program, the purpose of the confer
ence is to bring a number of people from government,
media and research organizations to express their views
on U.S. foreign policy. In addition to several Stanford
faculty members, other speakers at the conference will
be John Steinbruner of the Brookings Institution,
Richard Solomon of the RAND Corporation and Joseph
Nye from Harvard University.
Dallin said he hopes to make the conference an an
nual affair and to develop a visiting committee of schol
ars to advise and to evaluate the International Relations
Program here.
