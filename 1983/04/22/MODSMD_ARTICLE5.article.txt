# Frost to be renovated in time for graduation

Tiered grass steps and a paved
handicapped access ramp will make
Laurence Frost Amphitheater a safer
and more comfortable site for this
year's commencement exercises on
June 12.
A $300,000 construction plan is
underway to replace the rotting
wood headers — the now invisible
redwood edging intended to provide
a terracing effect — with concrete
curbs running widthwise across the
amphitheater, explained Curtis Wil
liams, manager of engineering for
facilities project management.
"It (Frost) is supposed to be level
led off in tiers, but the hill has been
sloping over the years," said lason
Mavis, associate vice president of
University Facilities and Services.
The project will "take out the red
wood, make the tiers somewhat
wider and use concrete edging . . .
to get really good flat tiers that we
can put chairs on for commence
ment, he said.
"It will preserve it and provide for
its safe use . . . and it will look a lot
nicer," Mavis continued.
The six-inch high concrete curbs

will separate steps of grass six feet
wide, said Williams, a principal ar
chitect for the project. He noted that
the new design will be safer, provide
more seating space for graduation
and reduce theamphitheater's main
tenance costs.
"It has been designed with au
tomatic irrigation" to water the grass
better, said Williams. In addition,
lawn mowing and fertilization will be
made easier by the increased width
of the steps.
The combination of bad weather in
recent years and the overall aging of
the wood edgings have made the
project necessary, Mavis said. "Each
year before commencement it costs
a great deal to replace broken or rot
ted redwood boards. In two to three
years it would be almost unusable or
unsafe," he said.
The University uses Frost for pro
fessional concerts, rock and roll
shows, student parties and the an
nual Frolic in Frost spring party. Still,
the amphitheater's renovations are
intended to improve the graduation
exercises.
"The driving force is commence

FROST IMPROVEMENTS: Expected to be finished in time for com
mencement exercises in )une, renovation nears completion in Frost
Amphitheater. Included in the changes are new concrete edging to
improve the terracing of the seating area, a ramp for the handicapped

and an automatic sprinkling system. Despite the need for im
provements, some have voiced fears that the work is changing the
natural character of the auditorium.
