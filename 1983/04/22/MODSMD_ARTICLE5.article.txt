# Frost to be renovated in time for graduation
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
Tiered grass steps and a paved
handicapped access ramp will make
Laurence Frost Amphitheater a safer
and more comfortable site for this
year's commencement exercises on
June 12.
A $300,000 construction plan is
underway to replace the rotting
wood headers — the now invisible
redwood edging intended to provide
a terracing effect — with concrete
curbs running widthwise across the
amphitheater, explained Curtis Wil
liams, manager of engineering for
facilities project management.
"It (Frost) is supposed to be level
led off in tiers, but the hill has been
sloping over the years," said lason
Mavis, associate vice president of
University Facilities and Services.
The project will "take out the red
wood, make the tiers somewhat
wider and use concrete edging . . .
to get really good flat tiers that we
can put chairs on for commence
ment, he said.
"It will preserve it and provide for
its safe use . . . and it will look a lot
nicer," Mavis continued.
The six-inch high concrete curbs

will separate steps of grass six feet
wide, said Williams, a principal ar
chitect for the project. He noted that
the new design will be safer, provide
more seating space for graduation
and reduce theamphitheater's main
tenance costs.
"It has been designed with au
tomatic irrigation" to water the grass
better, said Williams. In addition,
lawn mowing and fertilization will be
made easier by the increased width
of the steps.
The combination of bad weather in
recent years and the overall aging of
the wood edgings have made the
project necessary, Mavis said. "Each
year before commencement it costs
a great deal to replace broken or rot
ted redwood boards. In two to three
years it would be almost unusable or
unsafe," he said.
The University uses Frost for pro
fessional concerts, rock and roll
shows, student parties and the an
nual Frolic in Frost spring party. Still,
the amphitheater's renovations are
intended to improve the graduation
exercises.

There's not such a concern for func

grass," Williams said. The levelled
tiers will not only provide additional
seating, but will diminish the likeli

down the sloped hill.

students who love Frost because it is

will now have to be wary of twisting

of the amphitheater will still be
sloped, and one path will be surfaced
to allow handicapped access, Wil

that this has been a problem at past
commencement exercises.
"There is a desire to do two other
things (to improve the facility), but
we didn't have enough money this
time," Williams said. The other pro
posed changes are making the hilly
pathways leading from the entrance
to the seating more easily accessible
and providing protection for the nat
ural areas between the cleared lawn
and the barbed wire enclosure.

better, said Williams. In addition,
lawn mowing and fertilization will be
made easier by the increased width
of the steps.
The combination of bad weather in
recent years and the overall aging of
the wood edgings have made the
project necessary, Mavis said. "Each
year before commencement it costs
a great deal to replace broken or rot
ted redwood boards. In two to three
years it would be almost unusable or
unsafe," he said.
The University uses Frost for pro
fessional concerts, rock and roll
shows, student parties and the an
nual Frolic in Frost spring party. Still,
the amphitheater's renovations are
intended to improve the graduation
exercises.

There's not such a concern for func
tions at which people sit on the
grass," Williams said. The levelled
tiers will not only provide additional
seating, but will diminish the likeli
hood of chairs — or people — rolling
down the sloped hill.
So while the changes clearly be
nefit the elderly and handicapped,
students who love Frost because it is
a haven for frisbee and football play
will now have to be wary of twisting
ankles or breaking legs on the con
crete headers. In addition, the placid

tree and grass setting may be tar
nished by these renovations.
Vet Williams insisted that the mod

(the use of concrete) was very much
of a concern during design. We con

natural aspect." Concrete, he added,
is the cheapest and most permanent
solution.
While the seating area will be ter
raced, the paths along the perimeter
of the amphitheater will still be
sloped, and one path will be surfaced
to allow handicapped access, Wil
liams said. Both ! e and Mavis noted

that this has been a problem at past
commencement exercises.
"There is a desire to do two other
things (to improve the facility), but
we didn't have enough money this
time," Williams said. The other pro
posed changes are making the hilly
pathways leading from the entrance
to the seating more easily accessible
and providing protection for the nat

and the barbed wire enclosure.
Weather permitting, the renova

at the latest. "It's proceeding ex
