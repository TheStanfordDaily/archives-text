Senate defers withholding
Washington — The Senate yesterday handed the
banking lobby a major victory and voted to postpone
withholding on interest and dividend income to July,
1987, if not permanently.
The vote — 91 to 5 — suggested that the Senate
would easily override a presidential veto. Supporters
of repeal are believed to have veto-proof strength in
the House, but they have not yet been able to force a
vote there.
"This (vote) sends the strongest possible signal to
the House of Representatives that they have got to
act, and act quickly, and an even stronger signal to the
White House," Sen. Robert Kasten (R-Wis.) said.
The freshman Senator led the anti-withholding

drive, forcing Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) chairman of
the Finance Committee, to capitulate on the issue
earlier this week. "This is clearly my most important
accomplishment as a Senator. I'm proud," Kasten
said.
The leading House advocate of repeal, Rep. Nor
man D'Amours (D-N.H.) said after the vote: "Now
that the Senate has taken reasonable action on this is
sue, I feel certain that the House will act." An aide said
he has garnered nearly two-thirds of the 218 signa
tures on a discharge petition designed to force a
House vote on repeal over the objections of the lead
ership.
The Kasten-Dole "compromise" would postpone
the starting day for withholding from this July 1 to July
