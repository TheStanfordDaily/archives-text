Senate defers withholding
Washington — The Senate yesterday handed the
banking lobby a major victory and voted to postpone
withholding on interest and dividend income to July,
1987, if not permanently.
The vote — 91 to 5 — suggested that the Senate
would easily override a presidential veto. Supporters
of repeal are believed to have veto-proof strength in
the House, but they have not yet been able to force a
vote there.
"This (vote) sends the strongest possible signal to
the House of Representatives that they have got to
act, and act quickly, and an even stronger signal to the
White House," Sen. Robert Kasten (R-Wis.) said.
The freshman Senator led the anti-withholding

drive, forcing Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) chairman of
the Finance Committee, to capitulate on the issue
earlier this week. "This is clearly my most important
accomplishment as a Senator. I'm proud," Kasten
said.
The leading House advocate of repeal, Rep. Nor
man D'Amours (D-N.H.) said after the vote: "Now
that the Senate has taken reasonable action on this is
sue, I feel certain that the House will act." An aide said
he has garnered nearly two-thirds of the 218 signa
tures on a discharge petition designed to force a
House vote on repeal over the objections of the lead
ership.
The Kasten-Dole "compromise" would postpone
the starting day for withholding from this July 1 to July
1,1987. Then, withholding would only start if the Gen
eral Accounting Office found that more than 5 per
cent of taxpayers failed to report interest and
dividend income, and both the House and Senate af
firmatively voted to supporting the GAO findings.
New MX plan approved
Washington — Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
who were publicly split over President Reagan's last
basing plan for the MX, yesterday unanimously en
dorsed the new proposal to put 100 of the highly ac
curate missiles in Minuteman silos.
In testimony before the Senate Armed Services
Committee, the nation's five highest ranking officers
acknowledged that those silos theoretically are vul
nerable to Soviet missile attack. But they are the eas
iest places to deploy the MX, and the chiefs said early
deployment is crucial so the United States can threat
en Soviet missile silos and "leadership" in the same
way large Soviet missiles threaten this country.
In keeping with this, Joint Chiefs' Chairman Gen.
John Vessey and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles
Gabriel pointedly left open the possibility that the
United States might not decide to "ride out" any first
strike by the Soviet Union.
Sen. J.J. Exon (D-Neb.) said that it sounded as if they
were talking of a policy of "launch on warning" in
which the United States would fire its missiles at first
the sign of an attack rather than chance losing them
by waiting until Soviet warheads detonated.
Freeze debate limited
Washington — An impatient House of Represent
atives yesterday voted 214 to 194 to restrict debate on
the controversial nuclear freeze resolution after be
hind-the-scenes efforts to reach a bipartisan com
promise failed.
Rep. Jim Jones (D-Okla.) offered to sponsor an
amendment providing for weapons reductions as
well as a freeze, which is what opponents of the
freeze want, but was talked out of it by pro-freeze
Democrats who argued that it would allow Re
publicans to claim victory in the increasingly politic
ized debate over arms control strategy.
"We're dancing on the head of a semantic pin,"
said a frustrated Jones. "I want to reach a compromise
but the far left and the far right are lodged in semantic
cement. This should not be a partisan issue."
Syrian actions alarm Israel
Jerusalem — Israel signaled concern yesterday that
Syria might be preparing for war, and the military
command reported two Israelis and four Arabs killed
in the latest clash along the Syrian-Israeli front line in
Lebanon.
The command said Israeli troops intercepted four
guerrillas trying to infiltrate Israeli lines south of Sofar
near the Beirut-Damascus highway late Wednesday.
It did not say if the guerrillas were Syrians or Palesti
nians.
An Israeli army spokesman reported that a third Is
raeli soldier was killed yesterday in southern Lebanon
in an ambush about 11 miles north of the Israeli
border.
The incidents coincided with news reports of in
creasing Syrian activity in Lebanon, an extensive Sovi
et rearmament of Syria and recent Syrian war games
— cited as evidence of a possible Syrian offensive.

Glenn announces candidacy
New Concord, Ohio — In a high school that bears
his name, Democratic Sen. John Glenn declared his
presidential candidacy yesterday and vowed to push
for an immediate freeze of nuclear weapons, repeal
of future tax cuts and a return to "the simple values
we learned in this small town."
Glenn became the sixth Democrat to formally an
nounce a bid for the White House. Polls within the
party rank him second behind former Vice President
Walter Mondale in the race for the nomination in San
Francisco next year.
Some national surveys have indicated both Mon
dale and Glenn could beat President Reagan if the
election were imminent.
Democrats pick San Francisco
Washington — Members of the Democratic Na
tional Committee overwhelmingly chose San Francis
co over four other cities yesterday as the site for their
party's national convention next year.
The choice, which had been expected, came on the
second ballot in a public 30-minute meeting of the
party's site selection committee. San Francisco re
ceived the votes of 23 of the panel's 27 members.
Two votes went to Chicago and one each to Detroit
and New York. The District of Columbia received
none. The last Democratic National Convention in
California was held in Los Angeles in 1960, when John
F. Kennedy was nominated for president.
San Francisco has pledged $8.5 million, including
police and security costs, to underwrite the conven
tion, which is scheduled for July 16-20,1984. It will be
held in the city's new $125 million Moscone Center
downtown.
Democratic National Chairman Charles Manatt tel
ephoned San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein after
the vote to offer his congratulations. In an amplified
phone hookup, Feinstein exclaimed, "Whoopee! I
just want to say thank you to the committee, and I
want you to know, Chuck, that we'll really do you
proud .... We'll make everyone very, very wel
come."

milestone in active but trendless trading yesterday, as
the Dow Jones industrials average interrupted its as
sault on the 1200 barrier.

points Wednesday to an all-time high of 1191.47, fell
