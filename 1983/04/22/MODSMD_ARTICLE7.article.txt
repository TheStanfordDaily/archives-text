# ASSU candidates face disqualification

### DAVID AZRIN 
The ASSU hearing committee will begin disqualifica
tion procedures today against "certain candidates,
slates and sponsors" in last week's election for violating
campaign rules, ASSU Elections Commissioner Craig
Spearman said late last night.
Undergraduate senator-elect |im Kohn, the election's
No. 2 vote getter, will be charged with posting campaign
material before the official deadline and with posting
materials at the Post Office. Spearman confirmed the
c harges against Kohn, but refused to identify other can
didates charged with violations.
"We feel that the transgressions are serious enough to
warrant disqualification," Spearman said.
According to Spearman, "All of the transgressions
were of the rulings or part of the campaign practices
code."
If the four-member hearing committee decides that a
candidate's violations are serious enough, it may rec

ommend the candidate's disqualification to the full sen
ate at next Tuesday's meeting.
Kohn defended his campaign practices, claiming that
Spearman told senate candidates during the March 29
election orientation meeting that they could begin cam
paigning at midnight on April 5. The campaign practices
code states that campaigning may begin only after 9 a.m.
Kohn said he began campaigning at 12:30 a.m.
According to Kohn, "Spearman told us all we could
start campaigning at midnight April 5."
Spearman said that he mistakenly told candidates at
the meeting that they could begin campaigning at mid
night, but tnen quickly corrected himself.
"First I said midnight, and then someone corrected
meand I said9a.m. Basically, I got mixed up," Spearman
said.
But Kohn said, "I didn't hear a correction, nor did five
other candidates. I left that meeting thinking I could
start campaigning at midnight."
