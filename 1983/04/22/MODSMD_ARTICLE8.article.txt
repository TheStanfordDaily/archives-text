## Dems more threat to peace Clark: Reagan 'anti-libertarian' 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
President Reagan is a "typical
socialist conservative totalitarian,"
said Ed Clark, the 1980 Libertarian
party presidential candidate, in a
speech here last night.
Clark, who addressed approxi
mately 40 people in Branner lounge,
said Reagan was a "consummate
anti-libertarian" in his civil rights
ideals, but that his economic policies
are occasionally libertarian.
"He talks about getting the gov
ernment off our backs," Clark said,
"He wants to reduce government
spending, but to rationalize this he
has to claim that the Pentagon is not
part of the government." He added
that Reagan was "no friend of the
free market."
In comparison with Democratic
presidential candidates, however,
Reagan poses a lesser threat to peace
and national security. "Republicans
talk more militarism but are less
dangerous than Democrats," Clark
said. "Those who get us involved in
foreign wars are those who believe
that government by force can solve
problems." He explained, "The
Democrats are dangerous because
they are seen as nice guys."
Clark used the occasion to outline
several libertarian ideals. "We be
lieve in freedom of movement; that
men have the right to move where
they want and do what thev want; we

believe that a man has the right to
live. Because of this, we believe that
a key issue is registration for the draft
and the draft itself."
Clark said he believed Reagan
would be re-elected and that
Reagan's foreign policy would result
in a reinstatement of the draft. "An
aggresive foreign policy in the Per
sian Gulf cannot be supported by a
voluntary army." He added, "We
view the draft as an immediate
danger."
Regarding legislation requiring
registration to receive federal finan
cial aid for education, Clark said that
although libertarians oppose the
draft and any regulations supporting
it, they are also opposed to student
loans. "We would cut taxes and elim
inate loans," he said.
Property rights are also part of
libertarian philosophy. Clark ex
plained that any action is permissible
if it is done on a man's property and
does not threaten the lives or property
of others. For example, a landlord
has the right to refuse to house
minorities, if this is what he wishes to
do with his propertyâ€”as long as the
landlord does not use any public
funds. In the same way, the man
agement of a private business has the
right to discriminate when hiring, ac
cording to the libertarian credo.
"The civil liberty of the employer
cannot be taken away ; " Clark said.

"We hold liberty to be of the highest
value." He explained, "When you
grant certain liberties you have to ac
cept the reality that they are going to
be abused. But you can usually sup
port your position on pragmatic
grounds."
The libertarian position on gun
control, according to Clark, is that
guns are an essential means of self
defense and that persons have the
right to keep and bear arms. "Sure,
some will be misused," Clark said,
"but then, a lot of things are mis
used."
Discussing foreign intervention,
Clark said that libertarians refuse to
protect the financial interests of
American companies investing
abroad, "U.S. companies in other
countries don't deserve our protec
tion," Clark said. "It's taking money
out of your pockets to support
someone else's interests."
Clark related his history of the
libertarian party: it began with the
parliamentary movement in 16th
century England and progressed
through the writings of John Locke
and the American Revolution. "The
American Revolution was based on
civil liberties issues and property
rights," Clark said. "It was begun a
century before in England by John
Locke." The Libertarian party is
based on similar ideas of civil liber
ties and property rights in a modern
context.
