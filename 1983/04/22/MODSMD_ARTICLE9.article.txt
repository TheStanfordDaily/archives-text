# Hoover Institution hiring sovereignty is rooted in history

The lack of University control over
the appointment of Hoover research
fellows has a long but relatively re
cent history.
Herbert Hoover selected W. Glenn
Campbell as director in 1959, the
same year the board of trustees
passed new guidelines specifying
that Hoover appointments were no
lor.ger to be subject to the approval
of any faculty committee, a unique
arrangement at that time. Although
the normal academic screening pro
cess would thus be skirted, the Uni
versity president retaiend a role in
appointment both the staff and di
rector.
Campbell has remained director
for 24 years, except for a leave in 1964
to work on Barry Coldwater's presi

dential campaign.
When Hoover became a target for
anti-war activists protesting its mili
tary research and ties to the Nixon
administration, the new University
president, Kenneth Pitzer,
negotiated an agreement with
Campbell in 1969 that future ap
pointments of Hoover senior fellows
(but not research fellows) would be
made pursuant to the recommenda
tion of a search committee composd
of both Hoover stff and University
faculty.
The Hoover director would then
present his proposd senior fellow
appointment to the president who
"will normally seek advice concern l
ing the quality of (the proposed fel
low's) scholarship from appropriate

leaders in the field of resaerch of the
candidate before making a deci
sion," according to the Pitzer-
Campbell agreement. This consulta
tion process has been used only
"half a dozen times," Rosenzweig
said, since it is unnecessary where
the senior fellow is already on the
faculty.
Pitzer's effort to reinstate Stanford
faculty into the Hoover hiring pro
cess was as short-lived as his presi
dency. In early 1971, the new Univer
sity President, Richard Lyman, in a
memo, outlined a new agreement
with Campbell which ended any
University role in the appointment of
Hoover Research fellows, according
to Rosenzweig.

However, those Hoover fellows
given the most prestigious title of
senior fellow — half of whom are
Stanford faculty — would be subject
to approval by the president and his
decision would be reported to the
board of trustees, according to
Rosenzweig and Robert Freelen, act
ing vice president for public affairs.
Rosenzweig said the majority of
Hoover reseach' appointments are
not forwarded to the board of trus
tees for approval since the president
of the University does not have the
power to review or veto the ap
point ment of research fellows. Ken
nedy can ask the director questions
about such appointments but the di
rector has final hiring authority.

There are 29 senior fellows, 11 ot
which are members of the Stanford
faculty. There are 30 senior research
fellows, 10 junior research fellows
and 11 young academics on one-year
national fellowships.
The president of the University has
maintained some control over the
appointment of the Hoover director.
However, his choice for director
must come from a list of candidates
prescreened and selected by a
Hoover-Stanford committee and is
subject to veto by both the Hoover
Board of Overseers and the board of
directors of the Herbert Hoover
Foundation, according to the January
12, 1971 minutes of the University
Board of Trustees.
