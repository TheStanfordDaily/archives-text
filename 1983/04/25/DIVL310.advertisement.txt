ESSAY CONTEST
The United States currently relies on the perception of mutual hostage
populations to deter a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union. This policy
of maintaining vulnerable populations as the key to a nation's security is
counteractive to the belief that the primary role of the government is to
protect its citizens. Moreover, recent technological innovations have
heightened concerns that such a policy may fail to prevent nuclear war.
Describe an alternative framework that could lessen the probability of
nuclear war. Include a realistic protocol for the implementation of your
proposal.
