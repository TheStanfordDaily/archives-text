# Baseball or football for Elway? Tomorrow's draft may decide
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
There is little doubt that Stanford senior John Elway
will be the first player chosen in tomorrow morning's
National Football League draft. But what team will
select him is a different story.
And whether Elway signs with an NFL franchise or
opts to accept an offer from the New York Yankees,
who have his baseball rights, is another question that
will be answered in the coming days.
One thing is for sure, however. Elway will be a
millionaire soon. Be it baseball or football, the 22-
year-old economics major will probably sign the
largest professional contract ever offered to a rookie
athlete.
He would be Stanford's first No. 1 draft pick since
1972, when the New England Patriots selected Heis
man Trophy winner Jim Plunkett.
Elway, another in a long line of great Stanford quar
terbacks, has been heralded as the best passing pros

pect ever. But he also plays baseball, and donned the
pin stripes of the Yankees' Class A minor league team
in Oneonta, N.Y., last summer.
The Baltimore Colts, by virgue of their 0-8-1 record
in the strike-shortened 1982 NFL season, have the first
pick in the draft, scheduled to begin tomorrow in
New York at 8 a.m.
But Elway has hinted that, although he would rather
throw footballs than baseballs, he may accept a
multi-million dollar offer from the Yankees if chosen
by the Colts or another East Coast team.
"I don't think he wants to (play for Baltimore),"said
Stanford offensive coordinator jim Fassel. "I would
be surprised if Baltimore drafts him and signs him.
That's my personal opinion."
Backfield mate Vincent White, a senior running
back who also should be drafted high, believes Elway
will play football regardless of the team.


Elway's future: touchdowns...


... or homeruns?
