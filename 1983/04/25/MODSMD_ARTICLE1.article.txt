# Baseball or football for Elway? Tomorrow's draft may decide
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
There is little doubt that Stanford senior John Elway
will be the first player chosen in tomorrow morning's
National Football League draft. But what team will
select him is a different story.
And whether Elway signs with an NFL franchise or
opts to accept an offer from the New York Yankees,
who have his baseball rights, is another question that
will be answered in the coming days.
One thing is for sure, however. Elway will be a
millionaire soon. Be it baseball or football, the 22-
year-old economics major will probably sign the
largest professional contract ever offered to a rookie
athlete.
He would be Stanford's first No. 1 draft pick since
1972, when the New England Patriots selected Heis
man Trophy winner Jim Plunkett.
Elway, another in a long line of great Stanford quar
terbacks, has been heralded as the best passing pros

pect ever. But he also plays baseball, and donned the
pin stripes of the Yankees' Class A minor league team
in Oneonta, N.Y., last summer.
The Baltimore Colts, by virgue of their 0-8-1 record
in the strike-shortened 1982 NFL season, have the first
pick in the draft, scheduled to begin tomorrow in
New York at 8 a.m.
But Elway has hinted that, although he would rather
throw footballs than baseballs, he may accept a
multi-million dollar offer from the Yankees if chosen
by the Colts or another East Coast team.
"I don't think he wants to (play for Baltimore),"said
Stanford offensive coordinator jim Fassel. "I would
be surprised if Baltimore drafts him and signs him.
That's my personal opinion."
Backfield mate Vincent White, a senior running
back who also should be drafted high, believes Elway
will play football regardless of the team.


Elway's future: touchdowns...


... or homeruns?
"I thinkhe would (play for Baltimore)," White said.
"I think it would be a tough decision on his part. I
don't think he'd prefer to play there, but he likes the
game (of football) a lot."
If Baltimore decides Elway would be too biga risk to
draft, it can trade the No. 1 pick to another NFL
franchise. The front-runner in such trade talk is the
San Diego Chargers, a West Coast passing team in
which Elway has expressed interest.
The Chargers have three first round picks — Nos. 5,
20 and 22 — and a wealth of talented veterans to offer
the Colts.
"I think the puzzle fits together better for San Di
ego," Fassel said. "If you put all the plusses and

minuses together for each team, San Diego would
have the most plusses and fewest minuses."
If Elway is drafted by a team he doesn't want to play
for and if, as a result, he choses baseball over foot
ball,he would havetheoption of returning to the NFL
two years later as a free agent.
Other Stanford football players expected to be
drafted tomorrow include White, tight end Chris
Dressel, running back Mike Dotterer and ofensive
lineman Chris Rose.
"I think a lot of teams will rank Chris (Dressel) as
one of the top tight ends in the country," Fassel said.
"And there are a lot of teams looking for a tight end."
Fassel predicted that Dressel would be picked in
the second or third rounds, White in the third and
Dotterer in either the third or the fourth.
The NFL has condensed the draft to one day from
the two day affair of past years. It consists of 12
rounds with each of the 28 teams having one draft
pick per round.
