## The 						Stanford Daily The 						senate's proper role 
### 
With the rhetoric of the ASSU elections still
ringing in their ears, students should have little
difficulty recalling that senate campaigns typi
cally focus on promises of competent admin
istration of student services and innovations
such as a "shuttle bus to the city."
Despite the fact that the senate was not
elected to act as the political mouthpiece of
students, our senators have now concluded that
it is their responsibility to pass a resolution op
posing an SSRL research proposal which would
aid nuclear research.
The resolution, which was passed at last
Tuesday's senate meeting by a vote of 14-3, is
precedent-setting. For the first time in more
than a decade, senators are seeking to politicize
an entity which was not intended to make politi
cal judgments. At the same time, the senate
acted hastily and without serious consideration
of the issue of institutional constraint of
academic freedom, an important policy ques
tion which must be confronted before a specific
stand can be taken. The resolution was brought
to the floor the night of the meeting
and senators were not given the opportunity to
study it on their own or to discuss their vote with
their constituents.
A petition signed by 1572 students opposed to
the SSRL project—about 12 percent of the
number of students here—which was pre
sented to the senate and prompted the resolu

tion, conveniently ignored the question of
academic freedom. It is not surprising that the
petition, which is still being circulated, received
the overwhelming support of those who were
asked to sign it. The choice that the petition
presented seemed a simple one: would you like
nukes on campus? If not, sign here.
What is at stake in this case is the right of
researchers to conduct the research which they
feel is appropriate and to fund that research as
they see fit. In addition, the proposed SSRL
project is opposed primarily because it will aid
nuclear weapons research, one of several pos
sible end-uses of the research. The petition calls
for the University to regulate research accord
ing to its possible future applications.
Despite these difficult questions, we have al
ready said that we oppose the proposed proj
ect. But because the question is not as simple as
it has been made to appear, it is essential that
students consider the complexities of the issue
before making a decision.
We are disturbed by the senate's assumption
of what some senators call a "trusteeship" of
student opinion. The senate should nottakethe
liberty of assuming that its mandate from the
voters in last year's election included the right
to speak for students on controversial political
issues. To cite one of the three dissenting
senators, Roland VanGaalen, "Next we'll be en
dorsing presidential candidates."
