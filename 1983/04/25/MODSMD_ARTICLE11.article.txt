## U.S. intervention is immoral 
### 
The editorial on U.S. policy in
Central America ("The wrong time
and place," Daily, April 20) must
qualify as the most arrogant,
chauvinistic collection of apologetics
for intervention and counter
revolutionary violence that I have
read in some time. The authors
should have a bright future at the
Hoover Institution or in the State
Department, which always have
room for propagandists who come
up with gems such as the Daily's as
sertion that "the focus of world at
tention should be on the in
adequacies of the Sandinist govern
ment and not on U.S. involvement."
This is precisely what the U.S. gov
ernment would love; it would make
stomping on the Sandinists so much
easier. After all, should the "focus of
world attention" fall on, forexample,
our ambassador to Honduras, John
Negroponte, who is essentially di
recting the counter-revolutionary
war against Nicaragua (Mother lories,
April 1983), those aspiring diplomats
in the Daily editorial office might be
discomfited.
Good Lord! — they might even
have to try to understand just how
our arming Honduras and Guatemala
to the teeth, encouraging militarism
in Costa Rica and abetting genocide
in El Salvador constitute what they
call "encouraging political
dialogue." But let us not ask the Dai
ly's pundits to strain their brains too
much.
The Daily's preoccupation with
how U.S. policy is perceived, rather
than with the substance of that pol
icy, is clear from the start. Thinking
people might consider that the fight
ing in Nicaragua (a situation called
"dress rehearsal for invasion" by In
These Times (April 6) ) is of overrid
ing concern, but the Daily is more
worried about the "hostile interna
tional and domestic attacks on U.S.
policy toward Central America" that
have been provoked by "accusations
of covert U.S. aid to the rebels."
"Accusations" ? "Covert" ? The Re
agan administration has itself virtu
ally detailed to the press all of the
counter-revolutionary actions it is
takingagainst Nicaragua: armingand
directing rebels; setting up elec
tronic spying equipment along the
frontier with Honduras (manned by
U.S. personnel); building up the
Honduran air force in the event that
client state should be used more di
rectly to attack Nicaragua.
CIA manipulation of the press
throughout Central America is well
known, and this continues, too. One
need not read the leftist press to dis
cover all of this; even the San Fran
cisco Chronicle will suffice.
But this sort of exhausting inves
tigative work is beyond the
capabilities of the Daily's editorial
board. More importantly, it is out of
their ideological framework, which
does not allow them to question the
fundamental direction of U.S.
foreign policy, only to decry the
"verbal abuse" directed at it.(The
"abuse" suffered by the Nicaraguan
peasantry at the hands of the U.S.-
backed invaders is hardly describa
ble by the word "verbal" — perhaps
"murder and rapine" come close to
the truth — but again, this is of no
concern to the Daily.)
Indeed, beginning with the title,
which obviously implies that there is
a right time and place for crushing

Third World revolutionaries, every
thing about the Daily's editorial blast
indicates fundamental, unswerving
support for the decades-old U.S. pol
icy of intervention in Third World
countries.
Self-determination, the light that
supposedly guided the American Re
volution (see that curious document,
the Declaration of Independence), is
not of much relevance to the Daily.
In fact, the Daily's anguish is only
over the fact that the "recent history"
of U.S. intervention abroad has been
"unsuccessful." Not "illegal"; not
"criminal"; not even "wrong" — just
"unsuccessful." Presumably Ameri
can intervention and aggression is
just jim-dandy as long as it "suc
ceeds" — meaning that the power of
U.S. capital is restored and the rest
less natives put back in their places.
Of course, to characterize U.S. in
tervention in the Third World as "un
successful" is rather foolish. Did the
Daily have in mind American adven
tures in Southeast Asia? But of course
the U.S. "succeeded" there — if by
"success" one means bombing sev
eral peasant societies into the Stone
Age, defoliating forests and destroy
ing cropland. Or let's consider that
great "successful" intervention, the
invasion of the Dominican Republic
in 1965 to put down an attempt to
restore a democratically elected
president to power. Or perhaps the
coup d'etat against the elected gov
ernment of Chile in the last decade is
the sort of "successful" U.S. inter
vention that the Daily slavers after.
In These Times (April 6) notes that
U.S. military forces have been used
in Central America and the Carib
bean almost continually throughout
the last 90 years, but that "such blat
ant intervention is [now] extremely
unpopular, so we need a revival of
the Cold War, increasingly pre
sented as a holy war by the president,
to neutralize the opposition and
mobilize congressional support and
support among the people in gen
eral." The Daily has certainly leapt
into the act, repeating Reagan admin
istration blatherings about "Cuba
model states" providing "platforms
for subversion" and posing "a direct
military threat" to the United States.
Exactly what a "Cuba-model state"
is, I really don't know. What I do
know is that the revolutionaries in
both Cuba and Nicaragua sought
U.S. aid directly after seizing power.
They were naturally scorned, be
cause their ideas about the previ
ously predominant role of U.S. capi
tal in their countries did not jibe with
those of American capitalists. They
were also unable to get aid or loans
from other Western countries or
banking institutions, thanks to U.S.
pressure. Cuba turned to the USSR
for help; Nicaragua has begun to do
the same.
This history lesson will be of no use
to the Cold War ideologues on the
Daily editorial board, however, for
they are too focused on "the real
crimes of the Sandinist regime" that
is too inept to deal with Nicaragua's
"severe economic problems."
No thoughtful people on the left in
this country have portrayed the San
dinists as pure. Take a look at the
leading leftist periodicals — The Pro
gressive, The Nat ion, In These Times,
Mother /ones — and one finds that
both the achievements and the fail
ings of the Sandinists are examined.
One would hope that the Daily edito

rial board would follow this example,
but that is impossible for people who
describe support for counter
revolutionary violence as "encou rag
ing political dialogue" and "work
ting] toward . . . regional stability,"
and who are ideologically incapable
of considering the possibility that
U.S. policy in Central America is any
thing but altruistic. George Orwell
would be proud of the way that the
Daily editorial board has purged the
language of impure thoughts, such
as "American aggression."

I congratulate the newly elected
ASSU senators and look forward to
seeing them guide the ASSU. I also
congratulate the ASSU for its elec
tion guide, which proved extremely
helpful in informing us of the elec
tion procedure and of the candi
dates.
However, I question the method
the Daily employed in its efforts to
help voters.
For three days last week, the Daily
published recommendations for
ASSU senators. Nothing is improper,
or unusual, about a publication en
dorsing candidates for an election.
However, few publications have
such an ability to reach voters and
affect them as our campus paper
does because it is the sole daily at
Stanford. Thus, the Daily's recom
mendations have more influence
than the recommendations of most
other publications.
It appears to be more than a coin
cidence that 80 percent of the candi
dates endorsed on theopinions page
became senators. Certainly, many of
those elected would have won re
gardless of what the paper said about
them. Nevertheless, our campus
newspaper has too much influence
in determining the election results.
As the paper itself noted last week,
for many students, "Daily endorse
ments were a major influence on
their vote."
An endorsement based on a few
editors interviewing a candidate for
several minutes means three days of
free advertising in the most widely
read paper on campus, additional
credibility, and name recognition for
the lucky candidate. In effect, it ap
pears that a few editors can select the
members of the ASSU Senate.
The Daily certainly has a right to
endorse candidates. It should lessen
the impact of its endorsements. The
endorsements should only be pub
lished the week before elections,
rather than on the days immediately
preceding them and the days of bal
loting. Voters can thereby have more
time to judge the recommended
candidates and to make a wiser deci
sion. Also, since the ASSU elections
guide was not widely read, all of the
candidates' statements should be
printed on the opinions page.
May these comments and sugges
tions help the Daily to review its im
portance in the elections and to bet
ter serve the student body in the fu
ture.
