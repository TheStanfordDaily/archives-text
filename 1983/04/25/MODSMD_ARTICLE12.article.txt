# A form of mellow terrorism

Too many protesters think that if you feel strongly
about your cause and don't throw rocks, then you have a
moral justification for doing just about whatever you
want, whatever the law says. The issue is somewhat
more complicated.
Civil disobedience is a specific term that applies to a
limited group of actions, not any act of random law
breaking. It involves a refusal to comply with a law,
because that law conflicts with individual conscience.
The classic example is the refusal of Henry David
Thoreau to pay taxes to the federal government
he disapproved of government spendingon the military.
Modern examples involve not registering with the draft
board or a refusal to wear a motorcycle helmet when it is
mandated by law. These actions can be right or wrong,
but they are civil disobedience.
In each example, the government makes a law, and
the individual refuses to comply with it. The individual
does not seek out laws to violate in order to make a
political point. Refusal to comply with a law differs dras
tically from driving 50 miles to lie down on train tracks,
or to chain yourself to a building, or to join a protest
march. These actions are direct challenges to the law,
not a refusal to comply. They are forms of non-violent
direct action.
The issue is still more complicated, because non
violent direct action comes in two types, one defensible
and one not. In legal direct actions, protesters carry
signs, parade, petition, hand out leaflets, write letters
and otherwise use their constitutional rights of free
speech and assembly tochallengeestablished authority.
These actions are both moral and legal, because they do
not infringe on the rights of anyone else. Such actions
can have a political impact as well, as groups from the
nuclear freeze movement to the civil rights marchers
have demonstrated. But these actions involve a lot of
organization and groundwork for little marginal gain. As
a form of protest, legal direct action is rarely cathartic or
glamorous.
Perhaps as a result, illegal non-violent direct action is
gaining popularity. These protesters systematically vio
late the legal rights of others in order to pressure the
political system. They trespass and blockade and van
dalize, but they claim the same moral justification as
those who practice civil disobedience or legal direct
action, on the grounds that they, too, are forced by their
consciences to protest. For the illegal protester, aiming

at a higher good justifies seeking out law to break.
This type of protest is legally wrong by definition and
morally misguided as well. In the real world, a tension
exists between individual political beliefs and social be
liefs as expressed in law and policy. Those who claim to
be moral but disregard all beliefs except their own are
ignoring half of this balance. By their self-centered stan
dard, any terrorist can claim to be a prisoner of con
science. Sure, they might have robbed a few banks and
blown up a few buildings, but they didn't physically
injure anyone and they were forced into crime by their
consciences.
Illegal protesters might argue that non-violence gives
a moral justification to their actions. Well, non-violence
is surely better than physically hurting people. But
threats against property, privacy and freedom of move
ment are not trivial things. Coercion and genteel
blackmail in the name of political change is no trivial
thing. In every non-violent action, taxpayers and
bystanders have to pay for the disruption. When that
action is illegal, I find it hard to see the moral justification
for forcing that burden on people.
The protesters might argue that legal action has failed,
and that their case is important enough to justify infring
ing on the rights of others. Perhaps, but a fanatical
minority isa real threat to a democracy. Illegal protesters
are so convinced that they have Truth that they will
submit to no civil restraint and will recognize only
selected rights while pursuing their political goals. Such
action is arrogant, presumptuous, and dictatorial â€” the
antithesis of a democratic ethos. The most terrible mis
takes are usually committed by people who could not
admit that they might be wrong.
Those who practice civil disobedience break the law,
but only when they have no other choice. They do not
seek out laws to break, and they recognize that society
must enforce its standards. Legal direct actions confront
and challenge the system without breaking the law. Both
can be misguided, but both are moral choices. But illegal
direct actions seek out crimes, commit them for political
reasons, and then contend that the rights violated were
not very important, anyway, compared to personal con
science and political necessity. Illegal direct action, re
gardless of how non-violent, is a form of mellow ter
rorism.
