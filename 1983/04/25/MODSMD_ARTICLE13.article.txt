# Sexist comic strip
## 
### 
The Pass/Fail comic strip (Jim Elfers
and David Cherry) in the April 19
issue of the Daily illustrated a particu
larly close-minded and sexist view of
the relationship between men and
women at Stanford. In short, a male
character expected "sexual favors"
from a female character in return for
a ski trip. When the woman destroys
his expectations, he is chagrined.
The intended humor of the strip,
that a male is disappointed by not
"scoring" in return for his "invest
ment," seems to advance the view
that such expectations by males of
females constitute acceptable, nor
mal social behavior. The authors
treat a very serious matter —
pressure to have sex to reimburse a
male's expenses — in a flippant and
sexist way. This depiction is anything
but funny; it is offensive.
The so-called punchline of the
strip read "I would have to pick a
feminist studies major." With this
statement the male attributes his
dashed hopes to the fact that the
female is a feminist studies major.
His view is that any woman aware of
herself as something other than a
male sex object must be a feminist
studies major. Given that the major
ity of women on campus are not
majoring in that field, the cartoon
implies that many females would
have no qualms about fulfilling such
a sexual contract.
It is distressing that the Daily, by
printing such a cartoon, reinforces
and implicitly supports the view that
sexism is funny.
