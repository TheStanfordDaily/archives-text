## Lundblade's longballs prevent Sun Devil sweep First-place Stanford stays atop 6-Pac by 3 games 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Tempe, Ariz. — Stanford had
a chance to succumb to a
Packer Stadium jinx here yes
terday, but exorcised the ghost
with a two-run ninth inning to
beat the Sun Devils, 9-7.
The Cardinal, now 31-11-1
overall and 14-6 conference,
had not won here since 1979
and had lost Friday's game 2-0
and Saturday's 10-1 on a two
game total of only seven hits.
But yesterday the Cardinal
had 14 hits and came from be
hind twice to win the season
series against the Sun Devils
four games to two. Stanford
continues to lead the 6-Pac by
three games over second-place
ASU and USC.
Catcher Rick Lunblade tied
the game twice for Stanford
with solo home runs to right
field in the sixth and eighth in
nings. A strong wind blowing
to the right helped both of
Lunblade's opposite-field
blasts off ASU reliever Jim Jef
ferson.
"The two home runs by
Lunblade really gave us a lift
and we finally started to hit the
ball," said Stanford coach
Mark Marque?'.. "He hits a lot
of balls that way (toward right
field) and with this wind if you
get them airborne, they're
going to go out."
After Lunblade tied the game
at seven all, the winning runs
came in the ninth.
Freshman designated hitter
Mike Deßenon lined Jeffer
son's first ninth-inning pitch
into the gap in right-center
field for a double. Vince
Sakowski sacrificed him to
third with a bunt off reliever
Jim Benedict, and freshman
Mark Davis drove in the win
ning run — pinch runner Fred
Laningham — with a ground
ball single past the drawn-in in
field.
Greg Lorenzetti scored Davis
with a double down the left
field line.
In ASU's half of the ninth,
the Sun Devils, now 33-15

overall and 13-11 conference,
threatened with two base run
ners and one out, but Bert Mar
tinez ended the game with a
sharp grounder to Mike A!-
drete at first. Aldrete fired to
John Verducci at second and
Verducci came back to Aldrete
for the game-ending double
play.
The game turned into a bat
tle of long relievers when both
starters, Steve Cottrell of Stan
ford and Gilbert Villanueva of
ASU, were chased earlv.
Jeff Ballard pitched six in
nings of five-hit relief in 90-
degree heat to pick up the win
and improve his record to 6-1.
Jefferson, now 6-3, was tagged
with the loss.
"I was getting tired toward
the end," Ballard said. "I don't
know how many more innings I
had left in me, but I had a good
day's rest yesterday and the
crowd really gets you pumped
up."
Yesterday's attendance of
5268 brought the three-game
total to a season high of 16,986.
The Cardinal suffered hitting
woes Friday and Saturday, but
when Pete Stanicek opened
yesterday's game with a double
off Villanueva and Aldrete fol
lowed with a two-run homer,
the fireworks had begun.
Aldrete's 10th home run and
brilliant fielding came after he
sat out Saturday's game with a
stomach virus.
Stanicek's lead-off double
was the first time he had
reached base in the series. He
finished with four hits yester
day, including two doubles.
"Stanicek is one of the keys
for us," Marquess said. "He
kind of makes us go because
he's our lead-off hitter and he
can steal a lot of bases."
Stanicek said, "It's always an
extra bonus when you play well
and win. Our first two hits
seemed to get everyone go
ing."
Nobody except the pitchers
got going Friday. ASU's Kendall
Carter pitched a three-hitter
under the lights to shut Stan

ford out for the first time in two
years.
"This was really sweet," Car
ter said. "It meant a lot to me,
because Stanford is such a
good-hitting team and because
the game was so important."
Brian Myers had a four-hit
shutout of his own until the
Sun Devils scored two runs in
the seventh on singles by Romy
Cucjen and Doug Henry and a
double by Greg Steen.
Despite the strong showing,
Myers' record fell to 6-3.
"This was the first night
game I pitched since high
school and it was nice," Myers
said. "I was getting my fastball
down and popping and had a
good slider. I was getting
ahead (of the hitters) a lot and
had good location."

The Sun Devils exploded
against the Cardinal bullpen in
their 10-1 win Saturday with the
score tied 1-1 after five innings.
Arizona State scored twice in
the sixth, twice in the seventh
and added five more in the
eighth.
Starter Kevin Kunkel, now
6-1, gave up three runs and was
tagged with the loss for Stan
ford. lefferson got the win out
of the bullpen.
The Cardinal's only run cam*
on Eric Hardgrave's 16th horrn
run of the year in the fourth
inning.
Arizona, which visits Sunken
Diamond for a three-game
series next weekend, is five
games back with a 9-11 confer
ence record.
