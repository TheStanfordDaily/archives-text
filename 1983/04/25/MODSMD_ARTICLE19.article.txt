# Card to face No. 2 Pepperdine
## Davis/Letts win Pac-10 pairs 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford junior Scott Davis and
freshman John Letts recovered from
shocking singles losses and teamed to
capture the Pacific-10 Conference dou
bles championship yesterday at Ojai,
Calif.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles pair of
Davis/Letts defeated the USC team of
Tim Pawsat and Todd Witsken 6-3, 6-4,
marking the third consecutive year that
a Stanford team has prevailed in the
doubles.
Davis teamed with Jeff Arons a year
ago to win. Arons and Jim Falberg
claimed the championship in 1981.
Pawsat and Witsken downed the
Cardinal pair of Jim Crabb and Mark
McKeen 7-6, 6-3 in Saturday's semi
finals while Davis/Letts beat UCLA's

John Davis/Craig Venter 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 to
avenge a loss to the Bears' pair earlier
this season.
Coach Dick Gould said he hopes the
doubles win will help the Card regain
the momentum it lost Thursday when
all eight Stanford netters fell on the first
day of singles competition, including
Davis—the defending Pac-10 singles
champ.
"We came back well in the doubles,"
he said. "We're a young team, and if
you can bounce back, that's a good
sign."
Fifth-ranked Stanford is going to
need all the momentum it can get,
however, with No. 2-ranked Pepper
dine invading the Farm tomorrow for a
match scheduled to begin at 1:30 p.m.
at Stanford Tennis Stadium.

Pepperdine is the only team that has
defeated Stanford (16-1 and 7-0 in the
Pac-10) this season—in the second
round of the National Team Champion
ships in Los Angeles in early February.
Gould said the key in tomorrow's
match will be the doubles. ' Pepper
dine's got tough doubles teams. It's
going to be difficult to win two or three
doubles, but we'll have to do it."
In the singles, Davis will have his
hands full at No. 1 with the Waves' Glen
Michibata, one of the nation's top
rated collegians. Michibata, a senior,
has had the better of Davis in their last
few outings.
Pepperdine also features seniors
Rich Gallien and John VanNostrand,
junior Rill Baxter and freshman Kelly
Jones, all accomplished tennis players.
