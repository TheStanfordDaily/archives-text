# Senate will decide on Kohn disqualification
## 
### SID ATKINS Senior staff writer 
The ASSU hearingcommittee look
ing into rule violations in the recent
elections will recommend to the
senate that senator-elect Jim Kohn be
disqualified on three charges, ac
cording to jon Adelstein, an alternate
senator-elect.
"jim's hearing went really poorly
for him," said Adelstein, who was a
witness in Kohn's hearing. "They
filed an additional charge against him
for publicly announcing the details
of the first charges against him be
fore the hearing."
The Elections Commission had
previously charged Kohn with illeg
ally posting campaign material be
fore the specified time and with dis
playing materials in the Post Office.
Elections Commissioner Craig
Spearman refused to comment on
the charges against Kohn. But he
said, "That (speaking publicly) was a
big no-no for |im."
In a separate hearing earlier Fri
day, Adelstein was cleared on one
charge of illegally placing a poster at
Cubberley Auditorium. "They de
cided that the charge wasn't serious
enough, so I got off," Adelstein said.

Kohn, who was the second highest
vote getter in the election, and
Adelstein, are two of the candidates
involved in the disqualification hear
ings for not conforming to the Cam
paign Practice Codes.
Although the hearing committee
has not yet released the names of
candidates and groups who are
being investigated, the fee assess
ment group most likely to face
charges is Stanford for Environmen
tal Education (SEE), according to
senator Peter Spivack, a Council of
Presidents member-elect.
Spearman said that the by-laws
prohibited him from revealing any
information about Friday's proceed
ings. "It doesn't help justice at all for
neople to hear about a case before
it's tried," he said.
The Band was earlier reported to
be a group facing disqualification,
but manager Gary Robinson refused
to comment on the Band's status.
After the hearing committee
finishes its investigations and trials, it
will make recommendations to the
senate on May 2, which will then vote
on each case. Ultimately, the sen
ate's vote determines whether a can
didate or a group will be disqualified
from the election.
Graduate senator James McGrath
said he expects the senate to confirm
the recommendations of the hearing
committee. "I personally am goingto
take what they say very, very seri
ously," he said.
Senator Roland Van Gaalen, how
ever, said he believes that most
senators will be reluctant to disqual
ify any candidates unless they have
committed serious offenses. But he
added, "I can't commit myself. It will
depend on the case. I think one guy
who got into the senate disrupted a
History 3 class in order to make a
campaign announcement, which is a
pretty serious offense."
Van Gaalen declined to provide
specific information about the hear
ings because, "everybody's scared to
death. There are some people who
are out to cram the rules down
everybody's throats," he said.
