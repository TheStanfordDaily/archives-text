# Netwomen relax at Ojai
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Frank Brennan and his wom
en's tennis team did a little re
laxing this weekend at the Ojai
Intercollegiates.
Top singles player Elise
Burgin relaxed even more. She
didn't even make the trip and
instead stayed home to nurse a
sore knee.
But whether they were in
Ojai or here, Brennan and
company had their minds on
this week's three key dual
matches, all against teams
ranked in the top 15 nationally,
including No. 1 rated USC.
"It's very anti-climactic,"
Brennan said of the Ojai In
tercollegiates, a series of sin
gles and doubles tournaments.
"At this point in the season, the
dual matches are so impor
tant."
And Stanford netters played
as if they had their minds
elsewhere. "It wasn't a particu
larly sterling weekend," Bren
nan quipped.
In the collegiate singles, sen
ior team captain Caryn
Copeland and sophomore Lin
da Gates got by their first two
opponents before losing to the
third.
Copeland beat Pt. Loma's
Sue Hughey, then Arizona
State's Leslie Hewitt 4-6, 6-3,
7-6 (14-12), fighting off nine
match points to win. But USC's
Kelly Henry stopped the Card
senior in the next round of sin
gles, 6-2, 2-6, 6-1.
Gates beat Cal-State North
ridge's Maria Reid 6-2, 6-3 and
Loyola-Marymount's Kathy
Ross 6-2, 6-2 before ASU's
Sherry Norris dropped her in
straight sets, 6-1, 6-3.

In the collegiate doubles,
Alison Hardey/Jackie Joseph
defeated Michelle Doz
al/Linda Polley 6-3, 6-2, then
were upset by Pacific's Linda
Treloar/Annette Ward 7-5, 2-6,
6-4.
In the open singles, Michelle
Weiss got by her first opponent
— Becky Callon — but lost to
UCLA's Helena Manset in the
next round 7-5, 6-4. Alyce
Werdel was on the short end of
a 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 score in a three
and-one-half hour match.

In the open doubles, Susie
Barbe/Barbara Baughman
were defeated by Janice Met
calf/Jamie Moore 6-1, 6-3.
"I've been pleased with the
way most of the players have
been playing," Brennan said.
"Cal and Pepperdine should
be good matches to get us
sharp for the (USC) Trojans."
Stanford takes on Cal
Wednesday at 1:30 p.m., Pep
perdine Friday at 1:30 p.m. and
USC Saturday at noon.
