# Spikers' season ends on sour note
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Fred Sturmand hismen'svol
leyball team ended the season
with something they have be
come accustomed to this year
— a loss.
But it was a loss to a team that
is ranked in the top five in the
nation — something else
they're used to.
Pepperdine manhandled the
Cardinal Friday night in Maples
Pavilion in three games, win
ning 15-8,15-8,15-13.
"Pepperdine controlled the
match with their serving," ex
plained Stanford coach Fred
Sturm. "They served us out of
the match.
"They've been playing well
for the last two weeks. And if
Pepperdine can win the
(NCAA) regionals, I'd pick
them to go all the way."
In the 10 days before Friday's
match against Stanford, the
Wave had played five matches
against the nation's top five
other teams and came away
winners in four of them. Vic
tories over UCLA, UC-Santa
Barbara, Hawaii and Penn State
were offset only by a loss to
Long Beach State.
Stanford finished the season
8-16 overall and 3-13 con
ference, placing eighth in the
nine-team CIVA (California In
tercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation) — without a doubt
the toughest volleyball con

ference in the nation.
The five best teams in the
CIVA — UCLA, Pepperdine,
UCSB, Hawaii and Long Beach
State — are amorg the top six
rated squads in the country.
And when you are in the
midst of a rebuilding season, as
Stanford was this year, the
CIVA is not a league in which a
young, inexperienced team is
going to win a lot of matches.
"I'm a little disappointed we
didn't win a few more
matches," Sturm said. "But I'm
not discouraged.
"I think our best years are
ahead of us. From now on,
there will be five or six teams
vying for the league title. We'll
be one of those teams in two
years."
Sturm mentioned he has
landed two top volleyball re
cruits who will attend Stanford
next fall — twins Ken and Karl
Kalderup.
"They both play middle
blocker, which is a position we
need some help at," he said.
"These two kids are bonafide
they're natural middle
blockers."
Sophomore Dan Parr and
freshman Jon Root have been
guaranteed spots at the Na
tional Sports Festival, while a
third Cardinal spiker —
sophomore Craig Lauchner —
tried out last week for the
World University Games.
