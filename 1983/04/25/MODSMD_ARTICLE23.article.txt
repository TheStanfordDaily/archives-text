and matching the best round of the final
day. He finished at 281 and won $48,000.

got it in routine fashion, two-putting.

the second round, had only two birdies
over the final 36 holes. He had a closing 73
and wound up at 287.

never was in title contention. He had a
final-round 72 for a 291 total.
