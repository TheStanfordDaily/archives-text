One of the main reasons the
United States has foreign policy
problems with East Asia, Western
Europe and the Soviet Union is a
difference in ideological viewpoints,
said the final three speakers of a
three-day international relations
conference here this weekend.
East Asia expert Richard Solomon,
director of the Rand Corporation and
a former member of the National Se
curity Council, blamed past U.S.
preoccupation with Europe and
NATO, which has kept Asian con
cerns on the periphery of policy.
Helga Haftendorn, a visiting politi
cal science professor from the Free
University of Berlin, pinpointed the
diverse ways in which the United
States and Europe view detente and
the Soviet threat. Harvard Prof,
loseph Nye, deputy undersecretary
of state for security assistance, sci

foreign policy, and applied his
analysis to current U.S.-Soviet rela

Addressing primarily U.S. rela

public of China, Solomon told the
Meyer Forum Room audience that
the "somewhat pugnacious attitude

of American foreign policy . . . has
exacerbated areas of perspective
interest between the countries."
Only recently, he said, has the
United States begun to see Asia as

its foreign policy. "We fought our
three most recent wars in Asia; in
trading patterns, Asian trade now
surpasses European trade," said Sol
omon, also noting the increase of
Asians in the U.S. population.
Trade problems currently plague
U.S.-)apan relations, and are fre
quently linked to security issues.
Japan is "a dependency in security,'
said Solomon. But with that nation's
rapid technological advancement,
there is a trend for coproduction
with the United States that may lead
to more cooperative efforts.
"Japan has geostrategic advan
tages," continued Solomon, "and
the security of sea-lanes is protecta
ble because of the bases we return
there, in the face of a growing Soviet
threat." Mining the three straits can
seriously limit Soviet operations in
the Pacific, Solomon added, al
though the presence of the U.S. pa

The security linkage gives rise to
resentment against Japan for not
spending enough on its own de
