# Professors speculate on international relations

### ELAINE WANG 
One of the main reasons the
United States has foreign policy
problems with East Asia, Western
Europe and the Soviet Union is a
difference in ideological viewpoints,
said the final three speakers of a
three-day international relations
conference here this weekend.
East Asia expert Richard Solomon,
director of the Rand Corporation and
a former member of the National Se
curity Council, blamed past U.S.
preoccupation with Europe and
NATO, which has kept Asian con
cerns on the periphery of policy.
Helga Haftendorn, a visiting politi
cal science professor from the Free
University of Berlin, pinpointed the
diverse ways in which the United
States and Europe view detente and
the Soviet threat. Harvard Prof,
loseph Nye, deputy undersecretary
of state for security assistance, sci
ence and technology during the Car
ter administration, traced the histor
ical influences which lie behind U.S.
foreign policy, and applied his
analysis to current U.S.-Soviet rela
tions.
Addressing primarily U.S. rela
tions with Japan and the People's Re
public of China, Solomon told the
Meyer Forum Room audience that
the "somewhat pugnacious attitude

of American foreign policy . . . has
exacerbated areas of perspective
interest between the countries."
Only recently, he said, has the
United States begun to see Asia as
something more than peripheral to
its foreign policy. "We fought our
three most recent wars in Asia; in
trading patterns, Asian trade now
surpasses European trade," said Sol
omon, also noting the increase of
Asians in the U.S. population.
Trade problems currently plague
U.S.-)apan relations, and are fre
quently linked to security issues.
Japan is "a dependency in security,'
said Solomon. But with that nation's
rapid technological advancement,
there is a trend for coproduction
with the United States that may lead
to more cooperative efforts.
"Japan has geostrategic advan
tages," continued Solomon, "and
the security of sea-lanes is protecta
ble because of the bases we return
there, in the face of a growing Soviet
threat." Mining the three straits can
seriously limit Soviet operations in
the Pacific, Solomon added, al
though the presence of the U.S. pa
trol also contributes to the tensions.
The security linkage gives rise to
resentment against Japan for not
spending enough on its own de
fense. But the interest, according to
Solomon, is clearly mutual. "It is still
safe to say that the 'alliance' — imply
ing mutuality of phrase — is vital and
slowly adapting to changes."
All in all, "despite trade prob
lems," said Solomon, U.S.-Japan re
lations are "the least troubled now,
especially with a strikingly muted
antinuclear movement."
The Sino-American "quasi
strategic partnership" evoked more
pessimism from Solomon, and he
listed a number of issues which have
frustrated those relations. The defec
tion of tennis star Hu Na is the "sym
bolic manifestation" of these prob
lems, he said.
Solomon termed the relationship
between the United States and China
as "aloof, not hostile. It's not a
tailspin, but an erosion of trust. Pek
ing is holding back from the Reagan
administration, hoping privately for a
change in 1984." Part of this results
from differing views on conducting
politics; China tends to think 'more
in terms of individuals rather than
institutions."
"There is clearly change for the
better since the 19505," said Sol
omon, "but in shaky circumstances
now, with an uncertain future." The
obstacle is Taiwan, he added; butthe
Peoples Republic of China sees the
Soviet Union as a military threat, and
Solomon suggested that "the shared
common threat will set priorities"

toward improving Sino-American re
lations.
The United States entered Euro
pean affairs to contain Germany,
counterbalance Soviet influence and
stabilize the pre-WWII economy,
Haftendorn said. The association is a
long-standing one, she said, leading
to tensions in East-West relations as
the role of Germany changed.
As with the case of East Asia, there
are simply different ways of ap
proach, namely "the different evalu
ation of costs and benefits of de
tente" with the Soviet Union, said
Haftendorn. "Europe thinks it a suc
cess story, whereas the U.S. does
not."
When discussing "military and
political East-West competition,
Europeans will point to weaknesses
of the Soviets in their politics and
social fabric," she contended, while
Americans tend to emphasize the
strengths.
Being geographically close to the
Soviet Union, Europe's prime inter
est is in mutual cooperation with the
Soviets, Haftendorn said. She com
pared "the war-fighting and war
winning strategy of U.S. Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger" to the
European "emphasis on pure deter
rence, war-fighting only to making
deterrence work."
This difference in evaluation of
East-West affairs "adds up to an
agenda of problems," Haftendorn
said. "Rhetoric used in election
campaigns is especially dangerous
because it transmits to Europe a pol
icy on the brink of war."

Enough different points of view
and operation may set Europe and
the United States apart, but the rela
tionship "is not a love affair. . . but a
mature marriage," with a certain
amount of cooperation and under
standing, but sporadic quarrels
which are not beyond working out,
she said.
The next forum on Saturday morn
ing, attended by just 20 people, tack
led the issue of domestic constraints
on U.S. foreign policy.
Nye identified the five constraints
as constitutional, political culture,
bureaucratic complexities, public
opinion and group interests. Tracing
the concern in the 1800s with tyran
nical power, he said U.S. tendency
has always been to fragment and bal
ance power, as opposed to the Euro
pean tradition of centralization.
This "dispersed elite" — the
executive and legislative split — does
not breed consensus, Nye said. "In
meetings with (former Secretary of
State Cyrus) Vance," he recalled,
"three-quarters of the discussion
was on how to deal with the other
branches of our government."
The constitutional and political
culture constraints are the most im
portant, Nye said. "We think we're
unique. We're moralistic and in
dulge in luxuries of isolationism; we
like quick answers and pragmatic
legal solutions. There is a public ap
proach to foreign policy."
According to Nye, this produces
oscillations and a tendency to "over
shoot and exaggerate," leading to
inconsistency and incoherence.

are simply different ways of ap
proach, namely "the different evalu
ation of costs and benefits of de
tente" with the Soviet Union, said
Haftendorn. "Europe thinks it a suc
cess story, whereas the U.S. does
not."
When discussing "military and
political East-West competition,
Europeans will point to weaknesses
of the Soviets in their politics and
social fabric," she contended, while
Americans tend to emphasize the
strengths.
Being geographically close to the
Soviet Union, Europe's prime inter
est is in mutual cooperation with the
Soviets, Haftendorn said. She com
pared "the war-fighting and war
winning strategy of U.S. Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger" to the
European "emphasis on pure deter
rence, war-fighting only to making
deterrence work."
This difference in evaluation of
East-West affairs "adds up to an
agenda of problems," Haftendorn
said. "Rhetoric used in election
campaigns is especially dangerous
because it transmits to Europe a pol
icy on the brink of war."

Enough different points of view
and operation may set Europe and
the United States apart, but the rela
tionship "is not a love affair. . . but a
mature marriage," with a certain
amount of cooperation and under
standing, but sporadic quarrels
which are not beyond working out,
she said.
The next forum on Saturday morn
ing, attended by just 20 people, tack
led the issue of domestic constraints
on U.S. foreign policy.
Nye identified the five constraints
as constitutional, political culture,
bureaucratic complexities, public
opinion and group interests. Tracing
the concern in the 1800s with tyran
nical power, he said U.S. tendency
has always been to fragment and bal
ance power, as opposed to the Euro
pean tradition of centralization.
This "dispersed elite" — the
executive and legislative split — does
not breed consensus, Nye said. "In
meetings with (former Secretary of
State Cyrus) Vance," he recalled,
"three-quarters of the discussion
was on how to deal with the other
branches of our government."
The constitutional and political
culture constraints are the most im
portant, Nye said. "We think we're
unique. We're moralistic and in
dulge in luxuries of isolationism; we
like quick answers and pragmatic
legal solutions. There is a public ap
proach to foreign policy."
According to Nye, this produces
oscillations and a tendency to "over
shoot and exaggerate," leading to
inconsistency and incoherence.


PINPOINTING PROBLEMS: Director of the Rand In
stitute Richard Solomon and visiting Political Science
Prof. Helga Haftendorn,members of a special panel

Michael Saathoff/Daily
on U.S. foreign relations, analyze the problems in East
Asia, Western Europe and the Soviet Union in a forum
sponsored by the International Relations department.
One of the main reasons the
United States has foreign policy
problems with East Asia, Western
Europe and the Soviet Union is a
difference in ideological viewpoints,
said the final three speakers of a
three-day international relations
conference here this weekend.
East Asia expert Richard Solomon,
director of the Rand Corporation and
a former member of the National Se
curity Council, blamed past U.S.
preoccupation with Europe and
NATO, which has kept Asian con
cerns on the periphery of policy.
Helga Haftendorn, a visiting politi
cal science professor from the Free
University of Berlin, pinpointed the
diverse ways in which the United
States and Europe view detente and
the Soviet threat. Harvard Prof,
loseph Nye, deputy undersecretary
of state for security assistance, sci
ence and technology during the Car
ter administration, traced the histor
ical influences which lie behind U.S.
foreign policy, and applied his
analysis to current U.S.-Soviet rela
tions.
Addressing primarily U.S. rela
tions with Japan and the People's Re
public of China, Solomon told the
Meyer Forum Room audience that
the "somewhat pugnacious attitude

of American foreign policy . . . has
exacerbated areas of perspective
interest between the countries."
Only recently, he said, has the
United States begun to see Asia as
something more than peripheral to
its foreign policy. "We fought our
three most recent wars in Asia; in
trading patterns, Asian trade now
surpasses European trade," said Sol
omon, also noting the increase of
Asians in the U.S. population.
Trade problems currently plague
U.S.-)apan relations, and are fre
quently linked to security issues.
Japan is "a dependency in security,'
said Solomon. But with that nation's
rapid technological advancement,
there is a trend for coproduction
with the United States that may lead
to more cooperative efforts.
"Japan has geostrategic advan
tages," continued Solomon, "and
the security of sea-lanes is protecta
ble because of the bases we return
there, in the face of a growing Soviet
threat." Mining the three straits can
seriously limit Soviet operations in
the Pacific, Solomon added, al
though the presence of the U.S. pa
trol also contributes to the tensions.
The security linkage gives rise to
resentment against Japan for not
spending enough on its own de
fense. But the interest, according to
Solomon, is clearly mutual. "It is still
safe to say that the 'alliance' — imply
ing mutuality of phrase — is vital and
slowly adapting to changes."
All in all, "despite trade prob
lems," said Solomon, U.S.-Japan re
lations are "the least troubled now,
especially with a strikingly muted
antinuclear movement."
The Sino-American "quasi
strategic partnership" evoked more
pessimism from Solomon, and he
listed a number of issues which have
frustrated those relations. The defec
tion of tennis star Hu Na is the "sym
bolic manifestation" of these prob
lems, he said.
Solomon termed the relationship
between the United States and China
as "aloof, not hostile. It's not a
tailspin, but an erosion of trust. Pek
ing is holding back from the Reagan
administration, hoping privately for a
change in 1984." Part of this results
from differing views on conducting
politics; China tends to think 'more
in terms of individuals rather than
institutions."
"There is clearly change for the
better since the 19505," said Sol
omon, "but in shaky circumstances
now, with an uncertain future." The
obstacle is Taiwan, he added; butthe
Peoples Republic of China sees the
Soviet Union as a military threat, and
Solomon suggested that "the shared
common threat will set priorities"

toward improving Sino-American re
lations.
The United States entered Euro
pean affairs to contain Germany,
counterbalance Soviet influence and
stabilize the pre-WWII economy,
Haftendorn said. The association is a
long-standing one, she said, leading
to tensions in East-West relations as
the role of Germany changed.
