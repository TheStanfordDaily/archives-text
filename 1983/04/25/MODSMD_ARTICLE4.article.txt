The Reagan administration's "Star
Wars" satellite weapons plan is mak
ing the nuclear arms race "a dilemma
for the universe," Democratic presi
dential hopeful Gary Hart said here
Friday night.
"We must stop the nuclear arms
race. We must do so now," the Col
orado senator told a standing-room
only crowd at Kresge Auditorium.
Hart offered his own comprehensive
plan for reducing nuclear weapons.
"The overwhelming issue of our
time. . .is the question of the survi
val of life on this planet," said Hart.
"The more nuclear weapons we
build, the less secure we become.
The price we must pay goes up every
year."
The Reagan approach to nuclear
arms reduction reflects "a complete
misunderstanding of the subject,"

according to Hart. He stressed the
irony in trying to cut the number of
weapons on earth while simulta
neously launching a new arms pro
gram in space.
"Today arms cannot be piled upon
arms without consequence," said
Hart. He called the president's de
fense program "an enormous arms
build-up with no focus."
Hart, founder and co-chairman of
the bi-partisan Congressional Mili
tary Reform Caucus, outlined a nu
clear non-proliferation policy which
includes banning nuclear testing and
anti-satellite weapons "for all time."
He said the first step toward arms
reduction "is the immediate ratifica
tion of the impending SALT II Treaty"
and the disconfrnuation ot the MX
missile and B-1 bomber programs.
The United States and the Soviet
Union must be equally responsible
