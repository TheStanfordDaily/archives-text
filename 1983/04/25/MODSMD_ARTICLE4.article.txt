# Hart zaps Reagan's 'Star Wars' proposal
## 
### TROY EID Staff writer 
The Reagan administration's "Star
Wars" satellite weapons plan is mak
ing the nuclear arms race "a dilemma
for the universe," Democratic presi
dential hopeful Gary Hart said here
Friday night.
"We must stop the nuclear arms
race. We must do so now," the Col
orado senator told a standing-room
only crowd at Kresge Auditorium.
Hart offered his own comprehensive
plan for reducing nuclear weapons.
"The overwhelming issue of our
time. . .is the question of the survi
val of life on this planet," said Hart.
"The more nuclear weapons we
build, the less secure we become.
The price we must pay goes up every
year."
The Reagan approach to nuclear
arms reduction reflects "a complete
misunderstanding of the subject,"

according to Hart. He stressed the
irony in trying to cut the number of
weapons on earth while simulta
neously launching a new arms pro
gram in space.
"Today arms cannot be piled upon
arms without consequence," said
Hart. He called the president's de
fense program "an enormous arms
build-up with no focus."
Hart, founder and co-chairman of
the bi-partisan Congressional Mili
tary Reform Caucus, outlined a nu
clear non-proliferation policy which
includes banning nuclear testing and
anti-satellite weapons "for all time."
He said the first step toward arms
reduction "is the immediate ratifica
tion of the impending SALT II Treaty"
and the disconfrnuation ot the MX
missile and B-1 bomber programs.
The United States and the Soviet
Union must be equally responsible

for monitoring arms reduction, ac
cording to Hart. While he admitted
that "trust is non-existent" in the
present arms negotiations between
the superpowers, Hart said it would
be possible to establish joint
monitoring stations "with commonly
displayed screens" that would keep
track of "what's going on" with nu
clear weapons in both countries.
Hart cited the repeated break
downs of U.S. nuclear weapons
monitoring systems in recent years
and notes that "there is no reason to
think" the Soviets have not experi
enced similar breakdowns. He
added that these monitoring break
downs could lead to an accidental
exchange of nuclear weapons.
"We are more secure if we know
what weapons the Russians have,"
and if they know what weapons we
have, Hart said.
While he acknowledged that
"those who control" the Soviet
Union promote communist ideol
ogy, Hart noted that "this does not
mean that our response must be mili
tary." He pointed to the impact of
World War II on Russian conscious
ness and claimed that the Soviets
"are scared to death" of a nuclear

exchange.
Hart said nuclear arms reduction
talks must begin by seeking "areas of
agreement where limits can be
achieved" in a bi-partisan way, "as
we have done in the past."
"I'm not naive," said Hart. "There
will be no nirvana. . .in these negoti
ations."
Hart compared his own nuclear
arms reduction program with that of
the Reagan administration which he
called "the most pro-defense admin
istration in recent history."
"The administration is not seri
ous. . .about these negotiations,"
Hart said. It is ironic that the present
arms build-up will "end up making
this nation weaker rather than
stronger," he added.
Hart said his defense policy fo
cuses on ''conventional
aggression—the most likely military
event." He said that the Reagan ad
ministration has jeopardized Ameri
can security by shifting "our policy
from one of energy independence to
one of continued reliance on
foreign" energy, particularly oil from
the Persian Gulf.
President Reagan's expanding de
fense budget has neglected military
personnel in favor of weapons, ac
cording to Hart.
