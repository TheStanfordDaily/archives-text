Austrian chancellor resigns
Vienna, Austria — Austrian Chancellor Bruno
Kreisky announced his resignation last night, ending
13 years in power, after election results showed his
Socialist Party had lost its absolute majority in par
liament.
Kreisky said he was stepping down from the top of
fice but would remain active as party leader. He had
been in office longer than any other Western Europe
an leader.
The Socialists, with about 48 percent of yesterday's
vote, lost five seats for a total of 90, falling two short of
a majority in Austria's 183-seat parliament. Their main
opponent, the conservative People's Party, won 01
seats, an increase of four.

The Freedom Party, a liberal group espousing free
market theories, gained one seat to raise its share to
12. Two environmentalist Green parties failed to re
ceive enough votes for representation in parliament.
Kreisky's decision to relinquish power surprised
the nation following an election considered a
milestone in the country's political future. He fre
quently has said he would leave office unless his party
retained its majority, but the campaign vow was wide
ly perceived as a political bluff designed to extract
maximum voting leverage for the Socialists.
In an interview in January, Kreisky expressed pro
found disgust for coalition government and called it a
"frustrating, tiring exercise in confrontation politics."
Nonetheless, as party leader he will probably con
duct the coalition negotiations that many analysts be

lieve will result in a ruling center-left alliance be
tween the Socialists and the Freedom Party.
Kreisky, 72 and in failing health, is expected to turn
over the reins of government to his deputy prime
minister, Fred Sinowatz, who currently handles
educational affairs.
Watt's coal-leasing criticized
Washington — An eight-month investigation by
the House Appropriations Committee has concluded
that Interior Secretary James Watt is leasing govern
ment coal reserves to industry at "fire-sale" prices, al
lowing private interests to reap "windfall profits" at
the expense of the federal treasury.
Based on Interior Department documents and in

terviews with agency officials, industry executives,
environmentalists and economists, the 121-page re
port found that Watt's program of leasing billions of
tons of coal in the present soft market is marked by
mismanagement and is driving down the price the
government can command for its resources.
The report, delivered last week to committee mem
bers, is the most extensive inquiry into Watt's con
troversial coal-leasing program and is expected to
fuel congressional efforts to block him from holding
future coal auctions. Interior Department officials de
clined to comment on it.
The report, a copy of which was obtained by The
Washington Post, also found that:
