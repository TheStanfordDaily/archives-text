Austrian chancellor resigns
Vienna, Austria — Austrian Chancellor Bruno
Kreisky announced his resignation last night, ending
13 years in power, after election results showed his
Socialist Party had lost its absolute majority in par
liament.
Kreisky said he was stepping down from the top of
fice but would remain active as party leader. He had
been in office longer than any other Western Europe
an leader.
The Socialists, with about 48 percent of yesterday's
vote, lost five seats for a total of 90, falling two short of
a majority in Austria's 183-seat parliament. Their main
opponent, the conservative People's Party, won 01
seats, an increase of four.

The Freedom Party, a liberal group espousing free
market theories, gained one seat to raise its share to
12. Two environmentalist Green parties failed to re
ceive enough votes for representation in parliament.
Kreisky's decision to relinquish power surprised
the nation following an election considered a
milestone in the country's political future. He fre
quently has said he would leave office unless his party
retained its majority, but the campaign vow was wide
ly perceived as a political bluff designed to extract
maximum voting leverage for the Socialists.
In an interview in January, Kreisky expressed pro
found disgust for coalition government and called it a
"frustrating, tiring exercise in confrontation politics."
Nonetheless, as party leader he will probably con
duct the coalition negotiations that many analysts be

lieve will result in a ruling center-left alliance be
tween the Socialists and the Freedom Party.
Kreisky, 72 and in failing health, is expected to turn
over the reins of government to his deputy prime
minister, Fred Sinowatz, who currently handles
educational affairs.
Watt's coal-leasing criticized
Washington — An eight-month investigation by
the House Appropriations Committee has concluded
that Interior Secretary James Watt is leasing govern
ment coal reserves to industry at "fire-sale" prices, al
lowing private interests to reap "windfall profits" at
the expense of the federal treasury.
Based on Interior Department documents and in

terviews with agency officials, industry executives,
environmentalists and economists, the 121-page re
port found that Watt's program of leasing billions of
tons of coal in the present soft market is marked by
mismanagement and is driving down the price the
government can command for its resources.
The report, delivered last week to committee mem
bers, is the most extensive inquiry into Watt's con
troversial coal-leasing program and is expected to
fuel congressional efforts to block him from holding
future coal auctions. Interior Department officials de
clined to comment on it.
The report, a copy of which was obtained by The
Washington Post, also found that:
— Confidential Interior Deoartment data was
leaked to the coal industry more than a month before
auction last April of about 1 billion tons of govern
ment coal in the Powder River Basin along the Mon
tana-Wyoming border. It was the biggest auction of
coal-development rights in U.S. history.
— Senior department officials, quoted anony
mously in the report, pushed to postpone the auction
because of what they called the "scandalous" leak,
but were overruled by then-Deputy Assistant Secre
tary David Russell. These officials are quoted as saying
Russell was "hell bent" on holding the auction and
pushed ahead with it "as if his career depended on
it."
— The auction drew little competition, and the coal
rights were sold to industry for $60 million less than
House investigators concluded they were worth,
based on findings of Interior Department appraisers
and economists in the Powder River area.
Solidarity leader Pinoir arrested
Warsaw, Poland — In a double-barreled effort to
discourage anti-government May Day demonstra
tions, Polish authorities said yesterday that they had
arrested a top underground Solidarity leader and
then broadcast tape recordings maligning his charac
ter.
The official PAP news agency gave no indication of
when or how Jozef Pinior, underground leader in
Wroclaw in southwestern Poland, had been arrested.
But it said documents found in an apartment where
he had been living proved that he had been involved
in anti-state activity and that he had disposed of large
sums of Polish and Western currency.
It was not immediately clear how serious a setback
Pinior's arrest might be to underground operationsof
the now-banned independent trade union move
ment. However, the arrest is bound to be a psy
chological blow.
Pinior is the third member of the so-called Pro
visional Coordinating Commission or TKK by its
Polish initials, arrested since the group was formed a
year ago to coordinate underground Solidarity op
position to the regime.
Egypt reaffirms views on PLO
Cairo, Egypt — President Hosni Mubarak, prepar
ing for the arrival here today of Secretary of State
George Shultz, told reporters Saturday that Egypt re
gards the Palestine Liberation Organization as the
sole representative of the Palestinian cause.
Speaking to reporters in El Arish, Mubarak said that
"as far as Egypt is concerned, the Palestine Liberation

Organization is the sole representative of the Palesti
nian people ... according to the Rabat Arab summit
resolution."
Mubarak, at the same time, urged the PLO to "co
ordinate to create a linkage with King Hussein of Jor
dan so that the Americans could start working" on
new Middle East peace talks.
Although Egypt was a part of the 1974 Rabat agree
ment, its leaders, in recent years, had avoided using
that document's description of the PLO as "the sole,
legitimate representative" in order to facilitate the
participation of West Bank Palestinian leaders in the
peace process.
'Hitler diaries' debated
London — A literary controversy raged yesterday in
West Germany and Britain, as more historians and
newspapers joined a debate over the authenticity of
documents purported to be Adolf Hitler's secret
diaries. Heavy skepticism was expressed by many au
thorities.
After the respected Sunday Times of London
printed excerpts from a diary it said had been com
piled by the Nazi dictator during his years in power,
the Sunday Mail, a popular paper, said: "The so
called private diaries of Adolf Hitler could well turn
out to be the most outrageous literary hoax of all
time."
And a distinguished British historian, Lord Bullock,
called for an international commission of inquiry to
investigate whether Hitler did or did not compile a
diary and whether the Sunday Times version is the
correct one, if he did.
A second British historian, David Irving, and other
respected experts have cast serious doubts on the
authenticity of the documents, indicating that they
may be clever forgeries.
According to the account of the Sunday Times, the
diaries were put aboard a plane shortly before Hitler's
death in Berlin in April 1945, and were to have been
flown to his redoubt in Bavaria. But the plane carrying
them crashed in what is now East Germany, the news
paper said, and a local army officer recovered the
steel case that contained them, hiding it in a hayloft.
