## Vandalism incidents down after '70s student activism 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Despite pre-graduation sign-napping and fraternity
rush pranks, reported vandalism — the defacing or de
struction of property — does not increase in the spring.
Further, vandalism here in general has been decreasing
during the past few years.
"We really don't have too much problem (with van
dalism)," said Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
After the unrest of the mid-'7os, he said, "things kind of
returned to normal."
According to lames Horgan, head of operations and
maintenance, the University has "a very reasonable and
good situation" as far as vandalism in and around
academic buildings is concerned. He estimated that
each year the academic area of the campus suffers
$10,000 to $20,000 in damages ranging from stolen signs
to torn-up lawns to profane graffiti.
A sign of the times in spring is the increase in missing
signs before graduation. "When you get to this time of
year," Horgan said, "seniors want to take something
with them that says Stanford."
Martin Ford, an assistant professor of education who
specializes in adolescent behavior, said group behavior,
such as sign-stealing, may be a result of "showing other
people that you are cool." He explained, "There's not a
whole lot that's intrinsically motivating about a sign."
Students probably see the benefits of petty vandalism
as outweighing the costs. "It (vandalism) is like cheating
on your taxes. . . . People have a continuum of legality,"
Ford said.
Cases of reported vandalism campus-wide have drop
ped from 113 in 1981 to 107 in 1982, according to Dan
Smith, special services manager of the Stanford Police
Department.
No consistent trend emerges from the reported inci
dents, which range from broken windows to stolen signs
and are caused by outsiders as well as students.
But a psychological trend seems to exist in student
motivation: from Big Game and rush pranks to drunken
accidents, students forget the consequences of their
actions because they are acting impulsively.
Why do rational students behave in an irrational way?
According to Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo, "There
is a kind of exuberance, a kind of impulsiveness. You're
so caught up in responding emotionally, you're not
thinking about its significance, its meaning."
Students reduce their feeling of responsibility for de
structive behavior, Zimbardo said, "by not thinking
about the future (or) the consequences of the action
beyond the action itself."
According to Herrington of the Police Department,
juveniles in the community are responsible for the
majority of vandalism. That is, except for when the
weenies decorate the campus with blue paint before Big
Game.
Because of the United Stanford Workers strike in the
fall, vandalism this year was most concentrated in Sep
tember. Specific incidents of strike-related vandalism
included punctured tires and glued locks, Herrington
said.

Zimbardo said people often reduce their feeling of
responsibility by thinking in impersonal terms. "You're
destroying not people, but institutions." For example,
members of the University who vandalize may be fight
ing an impersonal thing such as "the school." Those
who make ideological statements may be "people who
would not ever take violent action against another indi
vidual."
Vandalism that does occur may be a sign of people
who are upset by the quality of life here, Zimbardo
speculated. "They may feel that things are too ordinary
and plastic here, it's a way of messing things up here
Ford said people generally vandalize to be part of a
group or to protest a kind of behavior against an "unre
sponsive, punishing environment."
But because the University does not have a substantial
vandalism problem, Ford said, "That may speak well of
Stanford University. . . (It is) reasonably good at helping
students get what they want." He added, "You're in a
context which is relatively idyllic."
People may vandalize because they feel powerless. "If
you can't have something that you want, how do you
react?" Ford said. A poor student, for example, might
vandalize as a reaction. It's safe, he said, because
"you're unlikely to get caught."
Ford said people do a "cost-benefit analysis" before
acting. "If a lot of people are stealing signs, that just
makes it all the more likely."
But Stanford students are more likely than the norm to
be "successful," Ford said, so they may feel less frus
trated and thus less likely to vandalize.
Big Game pranks and rush activities fall into the first
category of "belongingness" or peer pressure. "It's a
way of perhaps validating your membership in the
group," Ford said.
He speculated that social groups here may have more
mature or different ways of showing belongingness or
commitment than vandalism.
Vandalism ranges from ideological statements to
identification graffiti to destructive acts, Zimbardo said.
"It very often comes from frustration with those pub
lic services," Zimbardo said. "They're often protests by
people who have no other way to protest." He added,
"It's much easier to destroy something than to try to
make it better."
Zimbardo said that acts of vandalism are seldom
meaningless. "One of the definitions of vandalism is
that it is a senseless, mindless destruction of property —
which is a wrong definition. . . . It is possible, very often
to discover meaning in these acts. That doesn't excuse
them, but they are very often significant, meaningful
acts," he said.
"If you go to any fraternity on campus, there are
signs," Zimbardo said. "That's a different kind of van
dalism. . . . That's more like irresponsible play van
dalism. There's no message.
"Sometimes it's out of exuberance, sometimes it's set
up as a kind of a game. Pledges have to do that, it's an
order."

accidents, students forget the consequences of their
actions because they are acting impulsively.
Why do rational students behave in an irrational way?
According to Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo, "There
is a kind of exuberance, a kind of impulsiveness. You're
so caught up in responding emotionally, you're not
thinking about its significance, its meaning."
Students reduce their feeling of responsibility for de
structive behavior, Zimbardo said, "by not thinking
about the future (or) the consequences of the action
beyond the action itself."
According to Herrington of the Police Department,
juveniles in the community are responsible for the
majority of vandalism. That is, except for when the
weenies decorate the campus with blue paint before Big
Game.
Because of the United Stanford Workers strike in the
fall, vandalism this year was most concentrated in Sep
tember. Specific incidents of strike-related vandalism
included punctured tires and glued locks, Herrington
said.

Zimbardo said people often reduce their feeling of
responsibility by thinking in impersonal terms. "You're
destroying not people, but institutions." For example,
members of the University who vandalize may be fight
ing an impersonal thing such as "the school." Those
who make ideological statements may be "people who
would not ever take violent action against another indi
vidual."
Vandalism that does occur may be a sign of people
who are upset by the quality of life here, Zimbardo
speculated. "They may feel that things are too ordinary
and plastic here, it's a way of messing things up here
Ford said people generally vandalize to be part of a
group or to protest a kind of behavior against an "unre
sponsive, punishing environment."
But because the University does not have a substantial
vandalism problem, Ford said, "That may speak well of
Stanford University. . . (It is) reasonably good at helping
students get what they want." He added, "You're in a
context which is relatively idyllic."
People may vandalize because they feel powerless. "If
you can't have something that you want, how do you
react?" Ford said. A poor student, for example, might
vandalize as a reaction. It's safe, he said, because
"you're unlikely to get caught."
Ford said people do a "cost-benefit analysis" before
acting. "If a lot of people are stealing signs, that just
makes it all the more likely."
But Stanford students are more likely than the norm to
be "successful," Ford said, so they may feel less frus
trated and thus less likely to vandalize.
Big Game pranks and rush activities fall into the first
category of "belongingness" or peer pressure. "It's a
way of perhaps validating your membership in the
group," Ford said.
He speculated that social groups here may have more
mature or different ways of showing belongingness or
commitment than vandalism.
Vandalism ranges from ideological statements to
identification graffiti to destructive acts, Zimbardo said.
"It very often comes from frustration with those pub
lic services," Zimbardo said. "They're often protests by
people who have no other way to protest." He added,
"It's much easier to destroy something than to try to
make it better."
Zimbardo said that acts of vandalism are seldom
meaningless. "One of the definitions of vandalism is
that it is a senseless, mindless destruction of property —
which is a wrong definition. . . . It is possible, very often
to discover meaning in these acts. That doesn't excuse
them, but they are very often significant, meaningful
acts," he said.
"If you go to any fraternity on campus, there are
signs," Zimbardo said. "That's a different kind of van
dalism. . . . That's more like irresponsible play van
dalism. There's no message.
"Sometimes it's out of exuberance, sometimes it's set
up as a kind of a game. Pledges have to do that, it's an
order."

pus are decreasing after the turbulent student a*.-
tivism of the '70s.
Despite pre-graduation sign-napping and fraternity
rush pranks, reported vandalism — the defacing or de
struction of property — does not increase in the spring.
Further, vandalism here in general has been decreasing
during the past few years.
"We really don't have too much problem (with van
dalism)," said Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
After the unrest of the mid-'7os, he said, "things kind of
returned to normal."
According to lames Horgan, head of operations and
maintenance, the University has "a very reasonable and
good situation" as far as vandalism in and around
academic buildings is concerned. He estimated that
each year the academic area of the campus suffers
$10,000 to $20,000 in damages ranging from stolen signs
to torn-up lawns to profane graffiti.
A sign of the times in spring is the increase in missing
signs before graduation. "When you get to this time of
year," Horgan said, "seniors want to take something
with them that says Stanford."
Martin Ford, an assistant professor of education who
specializes in adolescent behavior, said group behavior,
such as sign-stealing, may be a result of "showing other
people that you are cool." He explained, "There's not a
whole lot that's intrinsically motivating about a sign."
Students probably see the benefits of petty vandalism
as outweighing the costs. "It (vandalism) is like cheating
on your taxes. . . . People have a continuum of legality,"
Ford said.
Cases of reported vandalism campus-wide have drop
ped from 113 in 1981 to 107 in 1982, according to Dan
Smith, special services manager of the Stanford Police
Department.
No consistent trend emerges from the reported inci
dents, which range from broken windows to stolen signs
and are caused by outsiders as well as students.
