## Fraternities and sororities To some they provide friends, to others, stereotypes 
### CATHY JANUS 
It's easy to stereotype frater
nities and sororities. Perhaps
that's because — in compari
son to other schools — the
Greek system is the exception,
not the rule, here.
Junior Joel Henry, a member
of the Phi Psi fraternity (which
does not have a house), said,
"People definitely stereotype
fraternities and sororities.
We're defined as cliquish, as
the type of people who like to
party and have a good time."
Junior Susan Goodhue
agreed. ''There are
stereotypes. You just can't get
away from them. Stereotypes
happen because people look
ing at a group from the outside
tend to categorize them. Label
ing can be positive or negative.
There are similarities within
different sororities and frater
nities because they share
common interests. While
stereotypes are exaggerated, I
admit to entertaining a lot of
stereotypes also. Sororities
and fraternities serve a social
function. It's a means for ex
panding your circle of friend
ships."
"Whether I stereotype de
pends on the fraternity. Some I
don't feel there's a real
stereotype because I know
them as individuals," said
junior Lisa Barker.
Sorority and fraternity mem
bers emphasize that they are
not seeking a certain "type" of
person; the selection process
is not standardized. Henry
thinks the Phi Psi selection

process diners from the regu
lar frat. "Other frats look for
the coolest guys. We base our
choice on how interested the
person is in our frat. If his
interest is great, we'll take
him."
Phi Delt rush chairman
Michael Hood said the reason
for being selective is because
the houses have a limited
number of spaces. Hood and
Sigma Chi rush chairman Rob

Middleton both stressed that
being selective does not mean
they look for a "certain type of
guy." Middleton said, "We get
a whole variety of people.
Rushees try out every place
and can gel a good feel for the
different houses. I don't think
people are kept away by pre
conceived ideas of a house,"
Middleton said.
While spaces are limited,
Hood thinks there are very few

gjys who want to be in a frat
Fut are not. "There's a place
.or anyone who really wants
one," he said.
"Those who like the social
scene are up here rushing. The
more studious people or those
who like smaller parties prob
ably aren't up here. The party
atmosphere of frats attracts

rushees at first. Those in
terested must come to the par
ties and meet members of the
house," Hood said, adding
that a rushee must "turn on so
cial skills" and have the mem
bers of the house like him.
During the first two weeks of
rush the frats are not at all
selective. Then the group is
narrowed down and not
everyone is invited back. "If a
guy is serious about pledging,
he needs to get around and

meet people. You have to be
yourself," Hood said.
Hood said he prefers frat
rush to sorority rush. "Sorority
parties are very limited. They
have 30 minutes in which to
talk. We can talk a long time,
invite rushees to dinner. I

don't see how sororities get to
know their girls."
Kappa Alpha Theta janet
Moulton said the sorority rush
process is the best way given
the amount of time they have.
She said she makes it a point to
go back and get to know the
girls she first met. There are
four parties at which to better
acquaint oneself with the girls,
she said.
Inter Sorority Council Presi
dent Suzanne Schendel said,
"Sororities at Stanford are
unique from those at other
schools. The big difference is
thatwearenothoused. joining
a sorority is like another activ

ity. because you aren t housed,
it's not as big a part of your
life."
Kappa Alpha Theta rush
chairman Marion Smith
agreed. "Residential education
is good. I wouldn't want to be

housed. Stanford sororities get
the best of what sororities are
about. Sororities are like an
extra-curricular activity with
extra meaning."
Fraternities, except for Phi
Psi, offer housing and pledges
are required to live at the
house at least one year.
Sororities, by contrast, do not
offer housing.
Schendel said she thinks the
sorority rush system is good.
Each sorority holds parties dur
ing which prospective mem
bers can ask questions, she
said. "The situation is rushed,
however. It is like an interview.
It's hard to get your personality
across in half an hour."
While frat rush is organized
around such activities as large

parties, barbecues, mud
wrestling and racquetball
nights, sorority parties are held
off campus at a boarding
school. The purpose of the
functions is to get acquainted,
Schendel said.
The process begins with two
meetings a week for two weeks
where the girls go to 30-minute
open houses for each of the six
sororities. Then rushees are
extended up to five invitations
and there is a one-hour party
for each sorority. The parties
have themes to add to the at
mosphere, said Smith. "Girls
must attend the parties they
are invited to. We don't want
any preconceived stereotyping
where girls only want to belong
to a particular sorority," she
said. "The system goes pretty
well. It is good that everyone is
guaranteed a place. The
groups are all fairly strong. By
requiring a girl to meet with all
six sororities, she is given a bet
ter introduction to what the
system is about. We encourage
people to come to rush with an
open mind.
Rushees, of which there are
approximately 260, have com
mented positively on how
different the sorority system is
from what they initially ex
pected," Schendel said.
At the end of rush, members
in the sororities and frater
nities vote on who they want to
give bids to. The Phi Delts will
not have room for more than 30
members. "The house votes
secretly. We go around the
room and everyone can say
something about each person
once. I heard from a girl in a
sorority that girls are very vici
ous when they do it. I don't
know how we'll behave,"
Hood said.
Moulton said nothing really
harsh is said when the
sororities choose their
pledges, but there is a "pro
con-pro discussion" of each
girl.
The sorority rush process
encourages that girls ask ques
tions, Shendel said. Sorority
counselors, who are removed
from the selection process, are
available so girls can ask ques
tions which they might feel un
comfortable asking a sorority
member involved in the selec
tion process.
What, then, is the typical
stereotype of a sorority or
fraternity member? "They are
kind of cute, socially active and
outgoing," said sophomore
Ingrid Wassman. "They need
to be stuck in a slot. Belonging
makes them feel comfortable.

They don't contribute anything
deep or meaningful to Stan
ford life."
"It's hard to stereotype a frat
guy individually. The
stereotypes are of a particular
frat or sorority. One is preppie,
another quiet, another does
drugs, but if someone asked
me to 'describe the typical frat
guyatStanford,' I'd haveahard
time," Hood said. "There are a
lot of different types of people
at Stanford. While guys who
join frats are diverse, they are
set aside. Something attracted
them and makes them choose
to live here, but you couldn't
be further from the truth to say
guys who get the bids are the
same."
Frats change from year to
year, but this reflects the over
all composition of the student
body, Hood said. "Freshman
classes are becoming more
conservative and our house is
taking on this trend."
"I think frats in general are
stereotyped," Middleton said.
"Lots of people don't give frats
a chance. We don't deserve the
stereotypes. Frats have a lot to
offer: real friendships, lots of
organization and a social
schedule. There is real unity
among members. Friendship is
the key. In four-class dorms it's
harder to find this unity and
life-long friendships. This isn't
knocking dorm life. Some have
a lot to offer." Hood also said
four-class dorms lack the spirit
found in freshman dorms and
frats. Many students living in
dorms say their social life is
centered at frats, he said.
"Frats do their job by having
happy hours that bring people
together," Barker said. "It's
good for people's social lives."
Hood said, "There is a real
feeling of brotherhood in frats,
something Stanford Residential
Education opposes because
they don't iike selective hous
ing. I meet a lot of people
through my friends in the
house."
But sophomore Eric Moller
disagreed. "I believe you can
make just as good of friends in
a four-class dorm as in a frat."
"The system is so cliche . . .
it's a 20th-century thing. Be so
cially active without thinking
about what you're doing and
who you are," said Wassman.
"It is limited. Everything about
sororities and fraternities
seems to be to get attention.
"When asked what I have
gotten out of a frat I would say
friendships and good times,"
said Hood. "It's a big question
that not too many guys proba
bly ask themselves."

and can gel a good feel for the
different houses. I don't think
people are kept away by pre
conceived ideas of a house,"
Middleton said.
While spaces are limited,
Hood thinks there are very few

gjys who want to be in a frat
Fut are not. "There's a place
.or anyone who really wants
one," he said.
"Those who like the social
scene are up here rushing. The
more studious people or those
who like smaller parties prob
ably aren't up here. The party
atmosphere of frats attracts

rushees at first. Those in
terested must come to the par
ties and meet members of the
house," Hood said, adding
that a rushee must "turn on so
cial skills" and have the mem
bers of the house like him.
During the first two weeks of
rush the frats are not at all
selective. Then the group is
narrowed down and not
everyone is invited back. "If a
guy is serious about pledging,
he needs to get around and

meet people. You have to be
yourself," Hood said.
Hood said he prefers frat
rush to sorority rush. "Sorority
parties are very limited. They
have 30 minutes in which to
talk. We can talk a long time,
invite rushees to dinner. I

don't see how sororities get to
know their girls."
Kappa Alpha Theta janet
Moulton said the sorority rush
process is the best way given
the amount of time they have.
She said she makes it a point to
go back and get to know the
girls she first met. There are
four parties at which to better
acquaint oneself with the girls,
she said.
Inter Sorority Council Presi
dent Suzanne Schendel said,
"Sororities at Stanford are
unique from those at other
schools. The big difference is
thatwearenothoused. joining
a sorority is like another activ

ity. because you aren t housed,
it's not as big a part of your
life."
Kappa Alpha Theta rush
chairman Marion Smith
agreed. "Residential education
is good. I wouldn't want to be

housed. Stanford sororities get
the best of what sororities are
about. Sororities are like an
extra-curricular activity with
extra meaning."
Fraternities, except for Phi
Psi, offer housing and pledges
are required to live at the
house at least one year.
Sororities, by contrast, do not
offer housing.
Schendel said she thinks the
sorority rush system is good.
Each sorority holds parties dur
ing which prospective mem
bers can ask questions, she
said. "The situation is rushed,
however. It is like an interview.
It's hard to get your personality
across in half an hour."
While frat rush is organized
around such activities as large

parties, barbecues, mud
wrestling and racquetball
nights, sorority parties are held
off campus at a boarding
school. The purpose of the
functions is to get acquainted,
Schendel said.
The process begins with two
meetings a week for two weeks
where the girls go to 30-minute
open houses for each of the six
sororities. Then rushees are
extended up to five invitations
and there is a one-hour party
for each sorority. The parties
have themes to add to the at
mosphere, said Smith. "Girls
must attend the parties they
are invited to. We don't want
any preconceived stereotyping
where girls only want to belong
to a particular sorority," she
said. "The system goes pretty
well. It is good that everyone is
guaranteed a place. The
groups are all fairly strong. By
requiring a girl to meet with all
six sororities, she is given a bet
ter introduction to what the
system is about. We encourage
people to come to rush with an
open mind.
Rushees, of which there are
approximately 260, have com
mented positively on how
different the sorority system is
from what they initially ex
pected," Schendel said.
At the end of rush, members
in the sororities and frater
nities vote on who they want to
give bids to. The Phi Delts will
not have room for more than 30
members. "The house votes
secretly. We go around the
room and everyone can say
something about each person
once. I heard from a girl in a
sorority that girls are very vici
ous when they do it. I don't
know how we'll behave,"
Hood said.
Moulton said nothing really
harsh is said when the
sororities choose their
pledges, but there is a "pro
con-pro discussion" of each
girl.
The sorority rush process
encourages that girls ask ques
tions, Shendel said. Sorority
counselors, who are removed
from the selection process, are
available so girls can ask ques
tions which they might feel un
comfortable asking a sorority
member involved in the selec
tion process.
What, then, is the typical
stereotype of a sorority or
fraternity member? "They are
kind of cute, socially active and
outgoing," said sophomore
Ingrid Wassman. "They need
to be stuck in a slot. Belonging
makes them feel comfortable.

They don't contribute anything
deep or meaningful to Stan
ford life."
"It's hard to stereotype a frat
guy individually. The
stereotypes are of a particular
frat or sorority. One is preppie,
another quiet, another does
drugs, but if someone asked
me to 'describe the typical frat
guyatStanford,' I'd haveahard
time," Hood said. "There are a
lot of different types of people
at Stanford. While guys who
join frats are diverse, they are
set aside. Something attracted
them and makes them choose
to live here, but you couldn't
be further from the truth to say
guys who get the bids are the
same."
Frats change from year to
year, but this reflects the over
all composition of the student
body, Hood said. "Freshman
classes are becoming more
conservative and our house is
taking on this trend."
"I think frats in general are
stereotyped," Middleton said.
"Lots of people don't give frats
a chance. We don't deserve the
stereotypes. Frats have a lot to
offer: real friendships, lots of
organization and a social
schedule. There is real unity
among members. Friendship is
the key. In four-class dorms it's
harder to find this unity and
life-long friendships. This isn't
knocking dorm life. Some have
a lot to offer." Hood also said
four-class dorms lack the spirit
found in freshman dorms and
frats. Many students living in
dorms say their social life is
centered at frats, he said.
"Frats do their job by having
happy hours that bring people
together," Barker said. "It's
good for people's social lives."
Hood said, "There is a real
feeling of brotherhood in frats,
something Stanford Residential
Education opposes because
they don't iike selective hous
ing. I meet a lot of people
through my friends in the
house."
But sophomore Eric Moller
disagreed. "I believe you can
make just as good of friends in
a four-class dorm as in a frat."
"The system is so cliche . . .
it's a 20th-century thing. Be so
cially active without thinking
about what you're doing and
who you are," said Wassman.
"It is limited. Everything about
sororities and fraternities
seems to be to get attention.
"When asked what I have
gotten out of a frat I would say
friendships and good times,"
said Hood. "It's a big question
that not too many guys proba
bly ask themselves."

It's easy to stereotype frater
nities and sororities. Perhaps
that's because — in compari
son to other schools — the
Greek system is the exception,
not the rule, here.
Junior Joel Henry, a member
of the Phi Psi fraternity (which
does not have a house), said,
"People definitely stereotype
fraternities and sororities.
We're defined as cliquish, as
the type of people who like to
party and have a good time."
Junior Susan Goodhue
agreed. ''There are
stereotypes. You just can't get
away from them. Stereotypes
happen because people look
ing at a group from the outside
tend to categorize them. Label
ing can be positive or negative.
There are similarities within
different sororities and frater
nities because they share
common interests. While
stereotypes are exaggerated, I
admit to entertaining a lot of
stereotypes also. Sororities
and fraternities serve a social
function. It's a means for ex
panding your circle of friend
ships."
"Whether I stereotype de
pends on the fraternity. Some I
don't feel there's a real
stereotype because I know
them as individuals," said
junior Lisa Barker.
Sorority and fraternity mem
bers emphasize that they are
not seeking a certain "type" of
person; the selection process
is not standardized. Henry
thinks the Phi Psi selection

process diners from the regu
lar frat. "Other frats look for
the coolest guys. We base our
choice on how interested the
person is in our frat. If his
interest is great, we'll take
him."
Phi Delt rush chairman
Michael Hood said the reason
for being selective is because
the houses have a limited
number of spaces. Hood and
Sigma Chi rush chairman Rob

Middleton both stressed that
being selective does not mean
they look for a "certain type of
guy." Middleton said, "We get
a whole variety of people.

agreed. "Residential education
is good. I wouldn't want to be

housed. Stanford sororities get
the best of what sororities are
about. Sororities are like an
extra-curricular activity with
extra meaning."
Fraternities, except for Phi
Psi, offer housing and pledges
are required to live at the
house at least one year.
Sororities, by contrast, do not
offer housing.
Schendel said she thinks the
sorority rush system is good.
Each sorority holds parties dur
ing which prospective mem
bers can ask questions, she
said. "The situation is rushed,
however. It is like an interview.
It's hard to get your personality
across in half an hour."
While frat rush is organized
around such activities as large

parties, barbecues, mud
wrestling and racquetball
nights, sorority parties are held
off campus at a boarding
school. The purpose of the
functions is to get acquainted,
Schendel said.
The process begins with two
meetings a week for two weeks
where the girls go to 30-minute
open houses for each of the six
sororities. Then rushees are
extended up to five invitations
and there is a one-hour party
for each sorority. The parties
have themes to add to the at
mosphere, said Smith. "Girls
must attend the parties they
are invited to. We don't want
any preconceived stereotyping
where girls only want to belong
to a particular sorority," she
said. "The system goes pretty
well. It is good that everyone is
guaranteed a place. The
groups are all fairly strong. By
requiring a girl to meet with all
six sororities, she is given a bet
ter introduction to what the
system is about. We encourage
people to come to rush with an
open mind.
Rushees, of which there are
approximately 260, have com
mented positively on how
different the sorority system is
from what they initially ex
pected," Schendel said.
At the end of rush, members
in the sororities and frater
nities vote on who they want to
give bids to. The Phi Delts will
not have room for more than 30
members. "The house votes
secretly. We go around the
room and everyone can say
something about each person
once. I heard from a girl in a
sorority that girls are very vici
ous when they do it. I don't
know how we'll behave,"
Hood said.
Moulton said nothing really
harsh is said when the
sororities choose their
pledges, but there is a "pro
con-pro discussion" of each
girl.
The sorority rush process
encourages that girls ask ques
tions, Shendel said. Sorority
counselors, who are removed
from the selection process, are
available so girls can ask ques
tions which they might feel un
comfortable asking a sorority
member involved in the selec
tion process.
What, then, is the typical
stereotype of a sorority or
fraternity member? "They are
kind of cute, socially active and
outgoing," said sophomore
Ingrid Wassman. "They need
to be stuck in a slot. Belonging
makes them feel comfortable.

They don't contribute anything
deep or meaningful to Stan
ford life."
"It's hard to stereotype a frat
guy individually. The
stereotypes are of a particular
frat or sorority. One is preppie,
another quiet, another does
drugs, but if someone asked
me to 'describe the typical frat
guyatStanford,' I'd haveahard
time," Hood said. "There are a
lot of different types of people
at Stanford. While guys who
join frats are diverse, they are
set aside. Something attracted
them and makes them choose
to live here, but you couldn't
be further from the truth to say
guys who get the bids are the
same."
Frats change from year to
year, but this reflects the over
all composition of the student
body, Hood said. "Freshman
classes are becoming more
conservative and our house is
taking on this trend."
"I think frats in general are
stereotyped," Middleton said.
"Lots of people don't give frats
a chance. We don't deserve the
stereotypes. Frats have a lot to
offer: real friendships, lots of
organization and a social
schedule. There is real unity
among members. Friendship is
the key. In four-class dorms it's
harder to find this unity and
life-long friendships. This isn't
knocking dorm life. Some have
a lot to offer." Hood also said
four-class dorms lack the spirit
found in freshman dorms and
frats. Many students living in
dorms say their social life is
centered at frats, he said.
"Frats do their job by having
happy hours that bring people
together," Barker said. "It's
good for people's social lives."
Hood said, "There is a real
feeling of brotherhood in frats,
something Stanford Residential
Education opposes because
they don't iike selective hous
ing. I meet a lot of people
through my friends in the
house."
But sophomore Eric Moller
disagreed. "I believe you can
make just as good of friends in
a four-class dorm as in a frat."
"The system is so cliche . . .
it's a 20th-century thing. Be so
cially active without thinking
about what you're doing and
who you are," said Wassman.
"It is limited. Everything about
sororities and fraternities
seems to be to get attention.
"When asked what I have
gotten out of a frat I would say
friendships and good times,"
said Hood. "It's a big question
that not too many guys proba
bly ask themselves."

It's easy to stereotype frater
nities and sororities. Perhaps
that's because — in compari
son to other schools — the
Greek system is the exception,
not the rule, here.
Junior Joel Henry, a member
of the Phi Psi fraternity (which
does not have a house), said,
"People definitely stereotype
fraternities and sororities.
We're defined as cliquish, as
the type of people who like to
party and have a good time."
Junior Susan Goodhue
agreed. ''There are
stereotypes. You just can't get
away from them. Stereotypes
happen because people look
ing at a group from the outside
tend to categorize them. Label
ing can be positive or negative.
There are similarities within
different sororities and frater
nities because they share
common interests. While
stereotypes are exaggerated, I
admit to entertaining a lot of
stereotypes also. Sororities
and fraternities serve a social
function. It's a means for ex
panding your circle of friend
ships."
"Whether I stereotype de
pends on the fraternity. Some I
don't feel there's a real
stereotype because I know
them as individuals," said
junior Lisa Barker.
Sorority and fraternity mem
bers emphasize that they are
not seeking a certain "type" of
person; the selection process
is not standardized. Henry
thinks the Phi Psi selection

process diners from the regu
lar frat. "Other frats look for
the coolest guys. We base our
choice on how interested the
person is in our frat. If his
interest is great, we'll take
him."
Phi Delt rush chairman
Michael Hood said the reason
for being selective is because
the houses have a limited
number of spaces. Hood and
Sigma Chi rush chairman Rob

Middleton both stressed that
being selective does not mean
they look for a "certain type of
guy." Middleton said, "We get
a whole variety of people.
Rushees try out every place
and can gel a good feel for the
different houses. I don't think
people are kept away by pre
conceived ideas of a house,"
Middleton said.
While spaces are limited,
Hood thinks there are very few

gjys who want to be in a frat
Fut are not. "There's a place
.or anyone who really wants
one," he said.
"Those who like the social
scene are up here rushing. The
more studious people or those
who like smaller parties prob
ably aren't up here. The party
atmosphere of frats attracts

rushees at first. Those in
terested must come to the par
ties and meet members of the
house," Hood said, adding
that a rushee must "turn on so
cial skills" and have the mem
bers of the house like him.
During the first two weeks of
rush the frats are not at all
selective. Then the group is
narrowed down and not
everyone is invited back. "If a
guy is serious about pledging,
he needs to get around and

meet people. You have to be
yourself," Hood said.
Hood said he prefers frat
rush to sorority rush. "Sorority
parties are very limited. They
have 30 minutes in which to
talk. We can talk a long time,
invite rushees to dinner. I

don't see how sororities get to
know their girls."
Kappa Alpha Theta janet
Moulton said the sorority rush
process is the best way given
the amount of time they have.
She said she makes it a point to
go back and get to know the
girls she first met. There are
four parties at which to better
acquaint oneself with the girls,
she said.
Inter Sorority Council Presi
dent Suzanne Schendel said,
"Sororities at Stanford are
unique from those at other
schools. The big difference is
thatwearenothoused. joining
a sorority is like another activ

ity. because you aren t housed,
it's not as big a part of your
life."
