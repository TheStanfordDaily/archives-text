# Draw is over
## The 						wait begins 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Dimitris Theodorou will proba
bly live in Mirrielees next year.
Not an interesting fact in itself,
except that Theodorou drew
number one in last week's hous
ing draw.
"But wait a minute before you
iaugh. I had expected the worst,
and I'm unguaranteed. Plus I like
to cook for myself. So I listed Mir
rielees first and then Manzanita,"
Theodorou tried to explain.
But lite is not all peachy for the
man who did what all students
would like to do. "I was sort of
bummed. I thought that the per
son who drew one got the lunch
with (University President) Ken
nedy. But instead I got the old
McDonald's treatment. I'll proba
bly have a contest in my class and
give that away," said the junior
transfer from Trinity College in
Connecticut.
Theodorou drew with junior
Justin Thulin, who was also un
guaranteed. Thulin said he hopes
to use his returning residence
priority to remain in Murray
House next vear.
Although the housing fates of
Thulin and Theodorou are fairly
well determined, other students
who participated in the annual
housing draw last week can only
wait.
Round one assignments will be
released next week at the earliest,
and final assignments will not be
made until the end of next month,
Rodger Whitney, director of hous

ing said.
Whitney said there is no way to
guess what numbers it will take to
get into certain residences be
cause "it's hard to say where the
numbers may shift," However,
Whitney and his staff observed
that the trailers, the suites and the
new housing at Sterling Quad ap
peared to be very popular among
students.
"Almost every card had Sterling
Quad listed on it somewhere,"
Whitney said. He also speculated
that Manzanita Park, which will
have three singles in each trailer
next year, will be popular.
Whitney said there is no way to
tell how many students drew
numbers or what the distribution
of those numbers over the 5000-
number range will be, but that
more students seemed to draw
this year than in the past.
For many students, the wait
until the first round assignments
are announced is an exciting one.
But for others, it's only a wait to
see if their luck goes from bad to
worse.
Manual Morales, an unguaran
teed junior and a self-described
"victim of the draw," is a new
member of the 14,000-
cumulative-draw-number club.
Not surprisingly, Morales has
some criticism for the draw sys
tem.
"Well, thereare too many prob
lems with it, like returning resi
dence priority. Either you're really
set for three years or you're
boofed."

THE DIE IS CAST: Looking away to improve his luck, one of several
thousand Stanford students draws a number that will determine his
residence for the forthcoming year.
