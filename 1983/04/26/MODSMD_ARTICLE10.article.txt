## Hoover Institution: a boon to the University 
### 
Serious questions recently have
been raised in the Stanford commu
nity about the relation of the Hoover
Institution to the University. As
chairman of the Department of
Sociology at Stanford University, a
department in which at present four
of my colleagues, Seymour Martin
Lipset, Alex Inkeles, W.). Goode and
James March hold appointments at
the Hoover Institution, I am in a posi
tion to provide some information
and perhaps some additional per
spectives on this matter.
The four individuals involved are
internationally famous social scien
tists. As a group, they have won by
their scholarship virtually every type
of award, or honor, that can be
achieved by social scientists. Most
important, their appointments to the
Stanford faculty have contributed to
the preeminence that the University
has achieved in the social sciences.

As far as I know, there has been no
"political litmus test" applied in mak
ing these appointments to the
Hoover Institution. (Is it conceivable
that one political grouping actually
contains so much academic talent?)
Furthermore, the acquisition of
these scholars (and others in other
social science departments) and the
University's ability to keep them in
the face of competing alternatives is
dependent, to an important degree,
on the resources for scholarship that
have been made possible by their
Hoover Institution appointments.
I think that this is an important fact
that should be kept in mind as we
assess the net contributions of the
Hoover Institution to Stanford Uni
versity.

Concrete in Frost
It saddens me to read of the so
called renovation and improvements
currently being completed in Frost
Amphitheater. It's great to have ac
cess for the handicapped and cer
tainly the grass will be easier to care
with the new irrigation system, but
will Frost really be a "safer and more
comfortable site" (Daily, April 22)
now that its once-gentle slopes are
scarred with concrete curbs?
The charm of Frost Amphitheater
has always been its natural, woodsy
green beauty. It seemed to invite
one to sit and enjoy a moment of
calm amid the rush. The redwood
barriers, though old, were incon
spicuous and in keeping with the
fieldlike, sylvan atmosphere of the
place, and I will miss them.
Granted, the now flat, perfectly
regular terraces bordered in con-

Crete will make it easier to trim the
grass and fill the place with chairs for
graduation, but in "improving" Frost
we have forever lost the simple ele
gance of its relatively unimproved,
sloping green carpet of grass.
Who is to say whether the place
will be any more safe (now that there
are nice concrete barriers to twist
ankles falling off of and stub toes
against) or any more enjoyable (con
crete is so much prettier than red
wood) now that it has been "reno
vated"? Though is may make for
more convenient seating for all the
visiting parents and alums at gradua
tion time, those who would enjoy
Frost during the rest of the year will
not welcome the decision to "im
prove" with concrete curbsides what
once was a perfectly pleasant green
slope.
Ah, progress!
