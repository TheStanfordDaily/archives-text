## Teach world, not western, culture 
### 
As a member of the African History
Committee of the Black Student
Union (BSU), I strongly object to the
manner in which the current West
ern Culture program is taught. By
teaching from a Euro-centric per
spective and concentrating exclu
sively on European civilization, the
program makes two fallacious as
sumptions. First, the inordinate em
phasis (i.e. three quarters and 15 un
its) placed on the program implies
that the study of non-western cul
tures is insignificant. This attitude in

/Ultimately, Western Culture should become North
American Cultures and should study the contrib
utions and interrelationships between the cultures
of native Americans, Chicanos, European-
Americans, Asian-Americans and African-
Americans/

suits those of non-European back
ground. Second, most tracks begin
their study with the Greeks and imply
>that western civilization developed
independently and free from outside
influences. This is simply not true.
Humanity, civilization, religion and
science developed first in Africa and
was then spread to Greece and the
rest of the world. As it now stands,
the Western Culture Program does
more distorting of the truth than
educating students.
I was encouraged to discover,
however, that University President
Donald Kennedy recognizes the
shortcomings of the program, and
that Carolyn Lougee, associate dean
of Humanities and Sciences, has
called a meeting of faculty members
to discuss improving the program. It
is my sincere hope that out of this
meeting will come the first positive
steps to correct the biases and inac
curacies in Western Culture. Fur
thermore, I hope that this meeting
marks the beginning of a serious ef
fort to include the study of the cul
tures of all Stanford students within
the mainstream of the under
graduate curriculum.
Having the benefit of experience
in the present Western Culture Pro

gram coupled with intensive educa
tion in African history, I would like to
offer a few suggestions for improving
the program. One immediate step
that should be taken is a revision of the
syllabus to include reference materi
als instead of the current Western
Civilizations. A particularly useful
book is George lames' Stolen Legacy
which explains the evolution of the
ideas of early Greek society.
Another improvement is the in
stallment of a new track. This track
could retain its European flavor but

examine the influences on and
evolution of European society. The
track should explain that Pythagoras,
Democritus and Socrates got their
ideas from Africa. It should show that
the Greek gods are imitations of Afri
can gods. It should teach that African
and Asian religions had a virgin
mother and child long before the
birth of Christ. It should explain that
Christianity first flourished in Africa.

. .most tracks begin their study with the Greeks
and imply that western civilization developed in
dependently and free from outside influences. This
is simply not true/

The new track should also illustrate
how Europe's economic growth in
the Industrial Age was directly linked
to its exploitation of African re
sources and people.
Since this knowledge, unfortu
nately, is not acquired through tradi
tional academic routes and is missing
from the backgrounds of Stanford
students and faculty, the University
should hire an expert in the field if it

wishes to provide the superior in
struction that it claims to offer. Dr.
Artee Young of the University of
Washington presently teaches a
course in world literature that con
centrates on the non-western origins
of the classics. Other experts that the
University should contact include
Asa Hilliard of Morehous College,
Dr. Richard King of San Francisco
State and Yosef ben-Jochanon of
Cornell.
While the above programs would
improve the program from what it is
now, they still do not get to the heart
of the problem: the unwarrantable
and unfounded glorification of
European culture over the cultures of
other people who share this conti
nent. Ultimately, Western Culture
should become North American Cul
tures and should study the contrib
utions and inter-relationships be
tween the cultures of native Ameri
cans, Chicanos, European-
Americans, Asian-Americans and
African-Americans.
The mutual study of one's own and
surrounding cultures is the first step
toward eliminating the misun
derstanding between cultural groups
that spawns rarism It I oiiiipp ic cr>ri

Culture Program, she will establish a

program. Without student input, ef

where the University is lacking, I am

begin the task of pointing the cur
riculum toward teaching the truth
about the development of mankind.

As a member of the African History
Committee of the Black Student
Union (BSU), I strongly object to the
manner in which the current West
ern Culture program is taught. By
teaching from a Euro-centric per
spective and concentrating exclu
sively on European civilization, the
program makes two fallacious as
sumptions. First, the inordinate em
phasis (i.e. three quarters and 15 un
its) placed on the program implies
that the study of non-western cul
tures is insignificant. This attitude in

/Ultimately, Western Culture should become North
American Cultures and should study the contrib
utions and interrelationships between the cultures

Americans, Asian-Americans and African-
Americans/

suits those of non-European back
ground. Second, most tracks begin
their study with the Greeks and imply
>that western civilization developed
independently and free from outside
influences. This is simply not true.
Humanity, civilization, religion and
science developed first in Africa and
was then spread to Greece and the
rest of the world. As it now stands,
the Western Culture Program does
more distorting of the truth than
educating students.
I was encouraged to discover,
however, that University President
Donald Kennedy recognizes the
shortcomings of the program, and
that Carolyn Lougee, associate dean
of Humanities and Sciences, has
called a meeting of faculty members
to discuss improving the program. It
is my sincere hope that out of this
meeting will come the first positive
steps to correct the biases and inac
curacies in Western Culture. Fur
thermore, I hope that this meeting
marks the beginning of a serious ef
fort to include the study of the cul
tures of all Stanford students within
the mainstream of the under
graduate curriculum.
Having the benefit of experience
in the present Western Culture Pro

gram coupled with intensive educa
tion in African history, I would like to
offer a few suggestions for improving
the program. One immediate step
that should be taken is a revision of the
syllabus to include reference materi
als instead of the current Western
Civilizations. A particularly useful
book is George lames' Stolen Legacy
which explains the evolution of the
ideas of early Greek society.
Another improvement is the in
stallment of a new track. This track
could retain its European flavor but

examine the influences on and
evolution of European society. The
track should explain that Pythagoras,
Democritus and Socrates got their
ideas from Africa. It should show that
the Greek gods are imitations of Afri
can gods. It should teach that African
and Asian religions had a virgin
mother and child long before the
birth of Christ. It should explain that
Christianity first flourished in Africa.

. .most tracks begin their study with the Greeks
and imply that western civilization developed in
dependently and free from outside influences. This
is simply not true/

The new track should also illustrate
how Europe's economic growth in
the Industrial Age was directly linked
to its exploitation of African re
sources and people.
Since this knowledge, unfortu
nately, is not acquired through tradi
tional academic routes and is missing
from the backgrounds of Stanford
students and faculty, the University
should hire an expert in the field if it

wishes to provide the superior in
struction that it claims to offer. Dr.
Artee Young of the University of
Washington presently teaches a
course in world literature that con
centrates on the non-western origins
of the classics. Other experts that the
University should contact include
Asa Hilliard of Morehous College,
Dr. Richard King of San Francisco
State and Yosef ben-Jochanon of
Cornell.
While the above programs would
improve the program from what it is
now, they still do not get to the heart
of the problem: the unwarrantable
and unfounded glorification of
European culture over the cultures of
other people who share this conti
nent. Ultimately, Western Culture
