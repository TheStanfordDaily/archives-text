## Hate mail and fair criticism —Vineberg on Vineberg 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
One of the fringe benefits of being a
movie critic is that you get to receive mail at
two addresses. I keep the letters I've re
ceived from readers since I began working at
the Daily (in the fall of 1980) in a specially
marked envelope in my desk at home, and for
a good year now I ve intended to answer it,
en masse, in this column.
But as long as there are two or three new
movies to write about, turning my attention
to the slowly increasing pile of reverse fan
mail seems a kind of self-indulgence, so the
task has been put off time and time again.
April is always a slack month for movies,
however, and I haven't seen anything worth
reviewing since Bad Boys (my comments on
Max Dugan Returns and Man, Woman and
Child together would scarcely fill a para
graph), so the time seems ripe to address my
invisible correspondents.
The general tone of these letters is
angry—not surprisingly, since most of us
have to be fairly riled up before we are
moved to respond in prose to something
we've read in the papers. They tell me that
my reviews are "long and boring," "pomp
ous pseudo-intellectual hogwash,"
"esoteric drivel," "a collection of inane
statements," "ignorant," "misguided,"
"simplistic," that I am "young and have
to learn," a "condescending communica
tions major who expects to become a pro
fessional critic," a "young snot getting. . .a
first crack at journalism," "a junior Rex Reed
in search of journalistic style"; that I have a
selfish and infantile sense of humor" that
leads me to write "defamatory articles"; and
that my critical concerns are "characteristic
of much of our society today (in which) fact
and competence are valued above ideas and
wisdom, law above justice, and most unfor
tunately money and power above life."
Clearly, I'll have a great deal to answer for on
Judgment Day.
Some of my attackers seem to be laboring
under various misapprehensions about me.
The gentleman who insisted that if I were a
Jew raised in the East I would have detested
Mel Brooks' History of the World, Part I, and
the woman who protested that anyone who
had worked as a secretary would understand
how remarkable a movie 9 to 5 is, didn't
consider the possibility I might be a Jew from
the East (I am) or that I might once have been
employed as a secretary (I was, once, for six
months). Perhaps that is why I can nevertake
such exclusive, in-group smugness, that
presumes we are all cut from one mold or
another, very seriously.
But perhaps a little biographical informa
tion would clear up the strange, hazy picture
some of you seem to have of me. I am 32
years old and in my third year of the doctoral
program in Drama at Stanford; I was born in
Montreal and received my undergraduate

education (as a theater arts major) at Bran
deis University in Boston. I have been writ
ing about movies since 1969—f0r The justice
and WBRS—FM at Brandeis, for The Boston
Phoenix, for various McGill University pub
lications, and now for the Daily. The largest
chunk of the time between my under
graduate and graduate years was spent as a
high school English and drama instructor in
Montreal.
I like Chinese food and rock n' roll and
I'm not really a two-headed monster who
eats babies for breakfast. In other words, I'm
not much different from anyone else, except
for the bizarre but inescapable fact that over
the last 10 years I've seen 1795 movies, old
and new and have written at some length
about 560 of them.
The anger many readers feel when they
disagree with a review is certainly under
standable. Everybody goes to the movies
and everybody has an opinion about what he
sees; it is irritatingto read a public denuncia
tion of a movie you loved. But it is naive to
assume that everyone shares the same per
spective on a film—or even that a movie is
good just because it appeals to you.
I love Casablanca, but I am aware of its
structural haphazardness, its sentimentality,
and the tacky nature of most of the acting in
it. A woman I dated at college told me she
had been touched by Love Story because a
friend of hers had died of leukemia—but her
identification with the film didn't make it a
great tragedy. However, when you point out
what you perceive as the flaws in a movie,
people often overreact, as if you'd attacked
them because they liked the picture.
Consequently, they may lash back with
the sort of bitter, ad hominem criticism I
have provided samples of in the preceding
paragraph. But when I attack a movie I
hated in print—On Golden Pond or Sophie's
Choice—my anger is directed not at the au
diences who applauded it, but at the
filmmakers who produced it and, in the case
of a strategic weeper like On Golden Pond,
have set audiences up, manipulating them
into an emotional response to a picture
which itself contains no honest emotion.
The distance between authentic feeling in a
movie (like Shoot the Moon or Diner) and
cold, mercenary viewer manipulation (as in,
to select a classic example, The Sound of
Music) is as great as the distance between a
work of literature and the latest bestseller by
Judith Krantz.
But whereas no English professor would
think of teaching Princess Daisy to an under
graduate class, the very nature of movies—
an art form that attracts everyone, not just
humanities types—blurs the qualitative dis
tinction between works. So anyone who
professes the ability to rank movies accord
ing to any standard other than popular con
sensus or the Academy Awards risk losing

his credibility. (The same problems exist—in
spades—in rock music criticism.)
Therefore, whenever I indicate that I am
less than enchanted with a picture like
Chariots of Fire or Gandhi, I know that I am
going to make a lot of people uncomfortable
and cause some to complain that I am "too
critical." But if one is not permitted to apply
formal critical criteria to Gandhi —to draw
attention to the obfuscation of the political
issues, the non-development of secondary
characters, the serious dramatic imbalance
in the obsequious, single-tracked script, the
reduction of historical events to
nonsense—just because the movie is so
high-minded, then what on earth is the pur
pose of criticism? Gandhi is so crammed full
of good intentions, and the hero is so re
lentlessly saintly, that many reviewers seem
to feel that to meet it with the same critical
tools as one might a new novel or play would
be, somehow, an act of sacrilege.

7'm not really a two-headed
monster who eats babies for
breakfast.

Similarly, though most of Sophie's
Choice—aside from Meryl Streep's
performance—is atrocious, its highly explo
sive subject matter is assumed to remove it
from the realm of serious criticism. And
when you try to put it back there, someone
may claim, as one reader did when I panned
Mephisto, that you "play Cod." But surely it
is the public, embracing a movie and thus
bringing celebrity and fortune to its makers,
who play God, not I. Richard Attenborough
won't lose a cent because of my negative
review of Gandhi in the Daily.
When a critic gets behind a movie he be
lieves in, he may provoke a different kind of
hatred from some filmgoers. I remember
seeing Shampoo when it came out in 1975
with some friends and friends of friends, and
when I turned out to be the only person in
the crowd who had liked it, all the anger the
movie had generated was suddenly leveled
at me. I was a movie critic and I loved this
picture that they hated so much, so wasn't I
in some measure responsible for the un
pleasant experience they'd just had? (Many
years passed before I went to another movie
in the company of a large group.)
There is, of course, a basic human impulse
at the bottom of such irrational behavior: the
fear that if someone who is supposed to
know something about movies likes a picture
and you don't respond to it in the same way,
then you are inadequate—you've been

found out. The resulting mutual embar
rassment may be an insoluble problem—l
experience a feeling of inadequacy when I
hear a symphony with a trained listener, or
see a dance concert with a balletomane. At
the movies, I can't pretend I know less than I
do—that I haven't seen all the movies I
have—and I can't keep that knowledge and
experience out of my reviews.
Why the hell would I want to? Writing
about movies excites me because it can be
a deeply satisfying intellectual experience,
especially when I'm faced with a film I love
(like Pennies from Heaven), or a film that
even if I don't care for it, presents a number
of critical challenges (like The French
Lieutenant's Woman) or gives me the oppor
tunity to explore ideas that have been taking
shape in my head for some time (like Bet
rayal).
More important, I hold certain principles
about movies—about the difference be
tween honest emotion and emotional man
ipulation, about what good acting is, about
what kinds of projects keep a gifted director
alive (Blow Out) and what kinds numb his
talents (Raiders of the Lost Ark).
The vehemence with which I often write
comes out of my devotion to these principles,
and my disappointment that so many
worthwhile films pass unnoticed. It may
sound perverse to prefer Shoot the Moon to
Ordinary People, Personal Best to Chariots
of Fire, Pennies from Heaven to Fame—but
only because my choices didn't catch fire at
the box office. In an art form that has always
been an industry while, miraculously, con
tinuing to be an art form, box office success
has such status that when you point out that
it has never been proof of quality, people
think you're crazy. But look at some of the
most lucrative pictures of past years—
Academy awards winners like The Great
Ziegfield, The Life of Emile Zola, Mrs. Mi
niver and The Greatest Show on Earth—if
you can sit through them. Furthermore, it is
useful to remember that Moby Dick sold
badly on its first printing.
Inevitably, my principles about what
makes a good movie run up against the prin
ciples of certain representatives of special
interest groups whose perception of movies
is often fixated on their ethnic and political
content. The most patronizing letters I re
ceive are usually from viewers who feel I
should respond to movies as if they were
tracts. One woman writes that my unen
thusiastic reaction to Zoot Suit is the conse
quence of my insufficient understanding of
Chicano culture and demands that I read
Octavio Paz's Labyrinth of Solitude before
presuming to review any other Chicano
films. An incensed anti-nuke activist is appal
led that my review of The Atomic Cafe re
vealed that I had never read Howard Rosen
berg's Atomic Soldiers and that I was "totally

oblivious to the historical record on this sub
ject."
The assumption in each case is that if I
were not so lamentably misinformed (or un
informed) on each of these subjects, I would
appreciate the finer qualities of these two
movies. I doubt it; Zoot Suit and The Atomic
Cafe may be on the side of the angels, but
they are terrible films. Zoot Suit is so exclu
sive and coded that only someone with a
working knowledge of Chicano culture
could comprehend it, which surely indicates
a basic problem in its ability to connect with
the rest of us. And since The Atomic Cafe is
supposed to be a documentary alerting us to
the horrors of nuclear armament, isn't it the
role of the filmmakers to provide the histori
cal information requisite to our understand
ing of the issues? But for the record, I do
make an effort to prepare myself for writing
about new films; this often entails reading
historical material (for a movie like Gandhi
or Mephisto) or familiarizing myself with the
novel on which a picture is based. But one
simply cannot read everything.
My favorite letter comes from a Mr.
John Agnew, and it is such a curio that I
quote the first two paragraphs in full:
"Steve Vineberg's movie reviews (I use
the term 'review' here very loosely) provide
a consistent source of mild amusement tor
me. I mean, they just never seem to agree
with my experience, the experience of any
one I know, or the experience of most every
other critic (that is, those who actually make
a living at it.)
"I was, surprised, therefore, to note the
presence of several fairly good movies in his
(Vineberg's) list of the best 12 movies of
1982. I suspect that E.T. made it on the list
because to have not liked it would have put
Steve in the ranks of folks like George
Will—and I don't think even Steve is ready
for that yet. (My guess is that he really didn't
like the movie, but just won't say so.)"
Mr. Agnew obviously has a gripe, but who
can tell what it is? He has probably been
angry with me over my opinions for some
time, but he waited until I praised a movie he
liked before writing in to complain. Accord
ing to his letter, my real sin is either in con
fusing him by putting a few good movies on
my best 12 list when he knows that I only like
bad movies, or else in pretending to like a
movie I couldn't really have liked because he
did.
Perverse as this letter is, its stunningly
convoluted logic conceals a fascinating mes
sage: that my column offers Mr. Agnew ma
terial to work off steam on, and he's going to
continue to work off steam, goddamnit,
whether he agrees with me or not. I'm glad I
can provide this service for you, Mr. Agnew.
I sleep much better these nights, secure in
the knowledge that my reviews serve some
purpose.
One of the fringe benefits of being a

good just because it appeals to you.
I love Casablanca, but I am aware of its
structural haphazardness, its sentimentality,
and the tacky nature of most of the acting in
it. A woman I dated at college told me she
had been touched by Love Story because a
friend of hers had died of leukemia—but her
identification with the film didn't make it a
great tragedy. However, when you point out
what you perceive as the flaws in a movie,
people often overreact, as if you'd attacked
them because they liked the picture.
Consequently, they may lash back with
the sort of bitter, ad hominem criticism I
have provided samples of in the preceding
paragraph. But when I attack a movie I
hated in print—On Golden Pond or Sophie's
Choice—my anger is directed not at the au
diences who applauded it, but at the
filmmakers who produced it and, in the case
of a strategic weeper like On Golden Pond,
have set audiences up, manipulating them
into an emotional response to a picture
which itself contains no honest emotion.
The distance between authentic feeling in a
movie (like Shoot the Moon or Diner) and
cold, mercenary viewer manipulation (as in,
to select a classic example, The Sound of
Music) is as great as the distance between a
work of literature and the latest bestseller by
Judith Krantz.
But whereas no English professor would
think of teaching Princess Daisy to an under
graduate class, the very nature of movies—
an art form that attracts everyone, not just
humanities types—blurs the qualitative dis
tinction between works. So anyone who
professes the ability to rank movies accord
ing to any standard other than popular con
sensus or the Academy Awards risk losing

his credibility. (The same problems exist—in
spades—in rock music criticism.)
Therefore, whenever I indicate that I am
less than enchanted with a picture like
Chariots of Fire or Gandhi, I know that I am
going to make a lot of people uncomfortable
and cause some to complain that I am "too
critical." But if one is not permitted to apply
formal critical criteria to Gandhi —to draw
attention to the obfuscation of the political
issues, the non-development of secondary
characters, the serious dramatic imbalance
in the obsequious, single-tracked script, the
reduction of historical events to
nonsense—just because the movie is so
high-minded, then what on earth is the pur
pose of criticism? Gandhi is so crammed full
of good intentions, and the hero is so re
lentlessly saintly, that many reviewers seem
to feel that to meet it with the same critical
tools as one might a new novel or play would
be, somehow, an act of sacrilege.

7'm not really a two-headed
monster who eats babies for
breakfast.

Similarly, though most of Sophie's
Choice—aside from Meryl Streep's
performance—is atrocious, its highly explo
sive subject matter is assumed to remove it
from the realm of serious criticism. And
when you try to put it back there, someone
may claim, as one reader did when I panned
Mephisto, that you "play Cod." But surely it
is the public, embracing a movie and thus
bringing celebrity and fortune to its makers,
who play God, not I. Richard Attenborough
won't lose a cent because of my negative
review of Gandhi in the Daily.
When a critic gets behind a movie he be
lieves in, he may provoke a different kind of
hatred from some filmgoers. I remember
seeing Shampoo when it came out in 1975
with some friends and friends of friends, and
when I turned out to be the only person in
the crowd who had liked it, all the anger the
movie had generated was suddenly leveled
at me. I was a movie critic and I loved this
picture that they hated so much, so wasn't I
in some measure responsible for the un
pleasant experience they'd just had? (Many
years passed before I went to another movie
in the company of a large group.)
There is, of course, a basic human impulse
at the bottom of such irrational behavior: the
fear that if someone who is supposed to
know something about movies likes a picture
and you don't respond to it in the same way,
then you are inadequate—you've been

found out. The resulting mutual embar
rassment may be an insoluble problem—l
experience a feeling of inadequacy when I
hear a symphony with a trained listener, or
see a dance concert with a balletomane. At
the movies, I can't pretend I know less than I
do—that I haven't seen all the movies I
have—and I can't keep that knowledge and
experience out of my reviews.
Why the hell would I want to? Writing
about movies excites me because it can be
a deeply satisfying intellectual experience,
especially when I'm faced with a film I love
(like Pennies from Heaven), or a film that
even if I don't care for it, presents a number
of critical challenges (like The French
Lieutenant's Woman) or gives me the oppor
tunity to explore ideas that have been taking
shape in my head for some time (like Bet
rayal).
More important, I hold certain principles
about movies—about the difference be
tween honest emotion and emotional man
ipulation, about what good acting is, about
what kinds of projects keep a gifted director
alive (Blow Out) and what kinds numb his
talents (Raiders of the Lost Ark).
The vehemence with which I often write
comes out of my devotion to these principles,
and my disappointment that so many
worthwhile films pass unnoticed. It may
sound perverse to prefer Shoot the Moon to
Ordinary People, Personal Best to Chariots
of Fire, Pennies from Heaven to Fame—but
only because my choices didn't catch fire at
the box office. In an art form that has always
been an industry while, miraculously, con
tinuing to be an art form, box office success
has such status that when you point out that
it has never been proof of quality, people
think you're crazy. But look at some of the
most lucrative pictures of past years—
Academy awards winners like The Great
Ziegfield, The Life of Emile Zola, Mrs. Mi
niver and The Greatest Show on Earth—if
you can sit through them. Furthermore, it is
useful to remember that Moby Dick sold
badly on its first printing.
Inevitably, my principles about what
makes a good movie run up against the prin
ciples of certain representatives of special
interest groups whose perception of movies
is often fixated on their ethnic and political
content. The most patronizing letters I re
ceive are usually from viewers who feel I
should respond to movies as if they were
tracts. One woman writes that my unen
thusiastic reaction to Zoot Suit is the conse
quence of my insufficient understanding of
Chicano culture and demands that I read
Octavio Paz's Labyrinth of Solitude before
presuming to review any other Chicano
films. An incensed anti-nuke activist is appal
led that my review of The Atomic Cafe re
vealed that I had never read Howard Rosen
berg's Atomic Soldiers and that I was "totally

oblivious to the historical record on this sub
ject."
The assumption in each case is that if I
were not so lamentably misinformed (or un
informed) on each of these subjects, I would
appreciate the finer qualities of these two
movies. I doubt it; Zoot Suit and The Atomic
Cafe may be on the side of the angels, but
they are terrible films. Zoot Suit is so exclu
sive and coded that only someone with a
working knowledge of Chicano culture
could comprehend it, which surely indicates
a basic problem in its ability to connect with
the rest of us. And since The Atomic Cafe is
supposed to be a documentary alerting us to
the horrors of nuclear armament, isn't it the
role of the filmmakers to provide the histori
cal information requisite to our understand
ing of the issues? But for the record, I do
make an effort to prepare myself for writing
about new films; this often entails reading
historical material (for a movie like Gandhi
or Mephisto) or familiarizing myself with the
novel on which a picture is based. But one
simply cannot read everything.
My favorite letter comes from a Mr.
John Agnew, and it is such a curio that I
quote the first two paragraphs in full:
"Steve Vineberg's movie reviews (I use
the term 'review' here very loosely) provide
a consistent source of mild amusement tor
me. I mean, they just never seem to agree
with my experience, the experience of any
one I know, or the experience of most every
other critic (that is, those who actually make
a living at it.)
"I was, surprised, therefore, to note the
presence of several fairly good movies in his
(Vineberg's) list of the best 12 movies of
1982. I suspect that E.T. made it on the list
because to have not liked it would have put
Steve in the ranks of folks like George
Will—and I don't think even Steve is ready
for that yet. (My guess is that he really didn't
like the movie, but just won't say so.)"
Mr. Agnew obviously has a gripe, but who
can tell what it is? He has probably been
angry with me over my opinions for some
time, but he waited until I praised a movie he
liked before writing in to complain. Accord
ing to his letter, my real sin is either in con
fusing him by putting a few good movies on
my best 12 list when he knows that I only like
bad movies, or else in pretending to like a
movie I couldn't really have liked because he
did.
Perverse as this letter is, its stunningly
convoluted logic conceals a fascinating mes
sage: that my column offers Mr. Agnew ma
terial to work off steam on, and he's going to
continue to work off steam, goddamnit,
whether he agrees with me or not. I'm glad I
can provide this service for you, Mr. Agnew.
I sleep much better these nights, secure in
the knowledge that my reviews serve some
purpose.
One of the fringe benefits of being a
movie critic is that you get to receive mail at
two addresses. I keep the letters I've re
ceived from readers since I began working at
the Daily (in the fall of 1980) in a specially
marked envelope in my desk at home, and for
a good year now I ve intended to answer it,
en masse, in this column.
But as long as there are two or three new
movies to write about, turning my attention
to the slowly increasing pile of reverse fan
mail seems a kind of self-indulgence, so the
task has been put off time and time again.
April is always a slack month for movies,
however, and I haven't seen anything worth
reviewing since Bad Boys (my comments on
Max Dugan Returns and Man, Woman and
Child together would scarcely fill a para
graph), so the time seems ripe to address my
invisible correspondents.
The general tone of these letters is
angry—not surprisingly, since most of us
have to be fairly riled up before we are
moved to respond in prose to something
we've read in the papers. They tell me that
my reviews are "long and boring," "pomp
ous pseudo-intellectual hogwash,"
"esoteric drivel," "a collection of inane
statements," "ignorant," "misguided,"
"simplistic," that I am "young and have
to learn," a "condescending communica
tions major who expects to become a pro
fessional critic," a "young snot getting. . .a
first crack at journalism," "a junior Rex Reed
in search of journalistic style"; that I have a
selfish and infantile sense of humor" that
leads me to write "defamatory articles"; and
that my critical concerns are "characteristic
of much of our society today (in which) fact
and competence are valued above ideas and
wisdom, law above justice, and most unfor
tunately money and power above life."
Clearly, I'll have a great deal to answer for on
Judgment Day.
Some of my attackers seem to be laboring
under various misapprehensions about me.
The gentleman who insisted that if I were a
Jew raised in the East I would have detested
Mel Brooks' History of the World, Part I, and
the woman who protested that anyone who
had worked as a secretary would understand
how remarkable a movie 9 to 5 is, didn't
consider the possibility I might be a Jew from
the East (I am) or that I might once have been
employed as a secretary (I was, once, for six
months). Perhaps that is why I can nevertake
such exclusive, in-group smugness, that
presumes we are all cut from one mold or
another, very seriously.
But perhaps a little biographical informa
tion would clear up the strange, hazy picture
some of you seem to have of me. I am 32
years old and in my third year of the doctoral
program in Drama at Stanford; I was born in
Montreal and received my undergraduate

education (as a theater arts major) at Bran
deis University in Boston. I have been writ
ing about movies since 1969—f0r The justice
and WBRS—FM at Brandeis, for The Boston
Phoenix, for various McGill University pub
lications, and now for the Daily. The largest
chunk of the time between my under
graduate and graduate years was spent as a
high school English and drama instructor in
Montreal.
I like Chinese food and rock n' roll and
I'm not really a two-headed monster who
eats babies for breakfast. In other words, I'm
not much different from anyone else, except
for the bizarre but inescapable fact that over
the last 10 years I've seen 1795 movies, old
and new and have written at some length
about 560 of them.
The anger many readers feel when they
disagree with a review is certainly under
standable. Everybody goes to the movies
and everybody has an opinion about what he
sees; it is irritatingto read a public denuncia
tion of a movie you loved. But it is naive to
assume that everyone shares the same per
spective on a film—or even that a movie is
good just because it appeals to you.
I love Casablanca, but I am aware of its
structural haphazardness, its sentimentality,
and the tacky nature of most of the acting in

and you don't respond to it in the same way,
then you are inadequate—you've been

found out. The resulting mutual embar
rassment may be an insoluble problem—l
experience a feeling of inadequacy when I
hear a symphony with a trained listener, or
see a dance concert with a balletomane. At
the movies, I can't pretend I know less than I
do—that I haven't seen all the movies I
have—and I can't keep that knowledge and
experience out of my reviews.
Why the hell would I want to? Writing
about movies excites me because it can be
a deeply satisfying intellectual experience,
especially when I'm faced with a film I love
(like Pennies from Heaven), or a film that
even if I don't care for it, presents a number
of critical challenges (like The French
Lieutenant's Woman) or gives me the oppor
tunity to explore ideas that have been taking
shape in my head for some time (like Bet
rayal).
More important, I hold certain principles
about movies—about the difference be
tween honest emotion and emotional man
ipulation, about what good acting is, about
what kinds of projects keep a gifted director
alive (Blow Out) and what kinds numb his
talents (Raiders of the Lost Ark).
The vehemence with which I often write
comes out of my devotion to these principles,
and my disappointment that so many
worthwhile films pass unnoticed. It may
sound perverse to prefer Shoot the Moon to
Ordinary People, Personal Best to Chariots
of Fire, Pennies from Heaven to Fame—but
only because my choices didn't catch fire at
the box office. In an art form that has always
been an industry while, miraculously, con
tinuing to be an art form, box office success
has such status that when you point out that
it has never been proof of quality, people
think you're crazy. But look at some of the
most lucrative pictures of past years—
Academy awards winners like The Great
Ziegfield, The Life of Emile Zola, Mrs. Mi
niver and The Greatest Show on Earth—if
you can sit through them. Furthermore, it is
useful to remember that Moby Dick sold
badly on its first printing.
Inevitably, my principles about what
makes a good movie run up against the prin
ciples of certain representatives of special
interest groups whose perception of movies
is often fixated on their ethnic and political
content. The most patronizing letters I re
ceive are usually from viewers who feel I
should respond to movies as if they were
tracts. One woman writes that my unen
thusiastic reaction to Zoot Suit is the conse
quence of my insufficient understanding of
Chicano culture and demands that I read
Octavio Paz's Labyrinth of Solitude before
presuming to review any other Chicano
films. An incensed anti-nuke activist is appal
led that my review of The Atomic Cafe re
vealed that I had never read Howard Rosen
berg's Atomic Soldiers and that I was "totally

oblivious to the historical record on this sub
ject."
The assumption in each case is that if I
were not so lamentably misinformed (or un
informed) on each of these subjects, I would
appreciate the finer qualities of these two
movies. I doubt it; Zoot Suit and The Atomic
Cafe may be on the side of the angels, but
they are terrible films. Zoot Suit is so exclu
sive and coded that only someone with a
working knowledge of Chicano culture
could comprehend it, which surely indicates
a basic problem in its ability to connect with
the rest of us. And since The Atomic Cafe is
supposed to be a documentary alerting us to
the horrors of nuclear armament, isn't it the
role of the filmmakers to provide the histori
cal information requisite to our understand
ing of the issues? But for the record, I do
make an effort to prepare myself for writing
about new films; this often entails reading
historical material (for a movie like Gandhi
or Mephisto) or familiarizing myself with the
novel on which a picture is based. But one
simply cannot read everything.
My favorite letter comes from a Mr.
John Agnew, and it is such a curio that I
quote the first two paragraphs in full:
"Steve Vineberg's movie reviews (I use
the term 'review' here very loosely) provide
a consistent source of mild amusement tor
me. I mean, they just never seem to agree
with my experience, the experience of any
one I know, or the experience of most every
other critic (that is, those who actually make
a living at it.)
"I was, surprised, therefore, to note the
presence of several fairly good movies in his
(Vineberg's) list of the best 12 movies of
1982. I suspect that E.T. made it on the list
because to have not liked it would have put
Steve in the ranks of folks like George
Will—and I don't think even Steve is ready
for that yet. (My guess is that he really didn't
like the movie, but just won't say so.)"
Mr. Agnew obviously has a gripe, but who
can tell what it is? He has probably been
angry with me over my opinions for some
time, but he waited until I praised a movie he
liked before writing in to complain. Accord
ing to his letter, my real sin is either in con
fusing him by putting a few good movies on
my best 12 list when he knows that I only like
bad movies, or else in pretending to like a
movie I couldn't really have liked because he
did.
Perverse as this letter is, its stunningly
convoluted logic conceals a fascinating mes
sage: that my column offers Mr. Agnew ma
terial to work off steam on, and he's going to
continue to work off steam, goddamnit,
whether he agrees with me or not. I'm glad I
can provide this service for you, Mr. Agnew.
I sleep much better these nights, secure in
the knowledge that my reviews serve some
purpose.
One of the fringe benefits of being a
movie critic is that you get to receive mail at
two addresses. I keep the letters I've re
ceived from readers since I began working at
the Daily (in the fall of 1980) in a specially
marked envelope in my desk at home, and for
a good year now I ve intended to answer it,
en masse, in this column.
But as long as there are two or three new
movies to write about, turning my attention
to the slowly increasing pile of reverse fan
mail seems a kind of self-indulgence, so the
task has been put off time and time again.
April is always a slack month for movies,
however, and I haven't seen anything worth
reviewing since Bad Boys (my comments on
Max Dugan Returns and Man, Woman and
Child together would scarcely fill a para
graph), so the time seems ripe to address my
invisible correspondents.
The general tone of these letters is
angry—not surprisingly, since most of us
have to be fairly riled up before we are
moved to respond in prose to something
we've read in the papers. They tell me that
my reviews are "long and boring," "pomp
ous pseudo-intellectual hogwash,"
"esoteric drivel," "a collection of inane
statements," "ignorant," "misguided,"
"simplistic," that I am "young and have
to learn," a "condescending communica
tions major who expects to become a pro
fessional critic," a "young snot getting. . .a
first crack at journalism," "a junior Rex Reed
in search of journalistic style"; that I have a
selfish and infantile sense of humor" that
leads me to write "defamatory articles"; and
that my critical concerns are "characteristic
of much of our society today (in which) fact
and competence are valued above ideas and
wisdom, law above justice, and most unfor
tunately money and power above life."
Clearly, I'll have a great deal to answer for on
Judgment Day.
Some of my attackers seem to be laboring
under various misapprehensions about me.
The gentleman who insisted that if I were a
Jew raised in the East I would have detested
Mel Brooks' History of the World, Part I, and
the woman who protested that anyone who
had worked as a secretary would understand
how remarkable a movie 9 to 5 is, didn't
consider the possibility I might be a Jew from
the East (I am) or that I might once have been
employed as a secretary (I was, once, for six
months). Perhaps that is why I can nevertake
such exclusive, in-group smugness, that
presumes we are all cut from one mold or
another, very seriously.
But perhaps a little biographical informa
tion would clear up the strange, hazy picture
some of you seem to have of me. I am 32
years old and in my third year of the doctoral
program in Drama at Stanford; I was born in
Montreal and received my undergraduate

education (as a theater arts major) at Bran
deis University in Boston. I have been writ
ing about movies since 1969—f0r The justice
and WBRS—FM at Brandeis, for The Boston
Phoenix, for various McGill University pub
lications, and now for the Daily. The largest
chunk of the time between my under
graduate and graduate years was spent as a
high school English and drama instructor in
Montreal.
I like Chinese food and rock n' roll and
I'm not really a two-headed monster who
eats babies for breakfast. In other words, I'm
not much different from anyone else, except
for the bizarre but inescapable fact that over
the last 10 years I've seen 1795 movies, old
and new and have written at some length
about 560 of them.
The anger many readers feel when they
disagree with a review is certainly under
standable. Everybody goes to the movies
and everybody has an opinion about what he
sees; it is irritatingto read a public denuncia
tion of a movie you loved. But it is naive to
assume that everyone shares the same per
spective on a film—or even that a movie is
good just because it appeals to you.
I love Casablanca, but I am aware of its
structural haphazardness, its sentimentality,
and the tacky nature of most of the acting in
it. A woman I dated at college told me she
had been touched by Love Story because a
friend of hers had died of leukemia—but her
identification with the film didn't make it a
great tragedy. However, when you point out
what you perceive as the flaws in a movie,
people often overreact, as if you'd attacked
them because they liked the picture.
Consequently, they may lash back with
the sort of bitter, ad hominem criticism I
have provided samples of in the preceding
paragraph. But when I attack a movie I
hated in print—On Golden Pond or Sophie's
Choice—my anger is directed not at the au
diences who applauded it, but at the
filmmakers who produced it and, in the case
of a strategic weeper like On Golden Pond,
have set audiences up, manipulating them
into an emotional response to a picture
which itself contains no honest emotion.
The distance between authentic feeling in a
movie (like Shoot the Moon or Diner) and
cold, mercenary viewer manipulation (as in,
to select a classic example, The Sound of
Music) is as great as the distance between a
work of literature and the latest bestseller by
Judith Krantz.
But whereas no English professor would
think of teaching Princess Daisy to an under
graduate class, the very nature of movies—
an art form that attracts everyone, not just
humanities types—blurs the qualitative dis
tinction between works. So anyone who
professes the ability to rank movies accord
ing to any standard other than popular con
sensus or the Academy Awards risk losing

his credibility. (The same problems exist—in
spades—in rock music criticism.)
Therefore, whenever I indicate that I am
less than enchanted with a picture like
Chariots of Fire or Gandhi, I know that I am
going to make a lot of people uncomfortable
and cause some to complain that I am "too
critical." But if one is not permitted to apply
formal critical criteria to Gandhi —to draw
attention to the obfuscation of the political
issues, the non-development of secondary
characters, the serious dramatic imbalance
in the obsequious, single-tracked script, the
reduction of historical events to
nonsense—just because the movie is so
high-minded, then what on earth is the pur
pose of criticism? Gandhi is so crammed full
of good intentions, and the hero is so re
lentlessly saintly, that many reviewers seem
to feel that to meet it with the same critical
tools as one might a new novel or play would
be, somehow, an act of sacrilege.

7'm not really a two-headed
monster who eats babies for
breakfast.

Similarly, though most of Sophie's
Choice—aside from Meryl Streep's
performance—is atrocious, its highly explo
sive subject matter is assumed to remove it
from the realm of serious criticism. And
when you try to put it back there, someone
may claim, as one reader did when I panned
Mephisto, that you "play Cod." But surely it
is the public, embracing a movie and thus
bringing celebrity and fortune to its makers,
who play God, not I. Richard Attenborough
won't lose a cent because of my negative
review of Gandhi in the Daily.
When a critic gets behind a movie he be
lieves in, he may provoke a different kind of
hatred from some filmgoers. I remember
seeing Shampoo when it came out in 1975
with some friends and friends of friends, and
when I turned out to be the only person in
the crowd who had liked it, all the anger the
movie had generated was suddenly leveled
at me. I was a movie critic and I loved this
picture that they hated so much, so wasn't I
in some measure responsible for the un
pleasant experience they'd just had? (Many
years passed before I went to another movie
in the company of a large group.)
There is, of course, a basic human impulse
at the bottom of such irrational behavior: the
fear that if someone who is supposed to
know something about movies likes a picture
and you don't respond to it in the same way,
then you are inadequate—you've been

found out. The resulting mutual embar
rassment may be an insoluble problem—l
experience a feeling of inadequacy when I

"Steve Vineberg's movie reviews (I use
the term 'review' here very loosely) provide
a consistent source of mild amusement tor
me. I mean, they just never seem to agree
with my experience, the experience of any
one I know, or the experience of most every
other critic (that is, those who actually make
a living at it.)
"I was, surprised, therefore, to note the
presence of several fairly good movies in his
(Vineberg's) list of the best 12 movies of
1982. I suspect that E.T. made it on the list
because to have not liked it would have put
Steve in the ranks of folks like George
Will—and I don't think even Steve is ready
for that yet. (My guess is that he really didn't
like the movie, but just won't say so.)"
Mr. Agnew obviously has a gripe, but who
can tell what it is? He has probably been
angry with me over my opinions for some
time, but he waited until I praised a movie he
liked before writing in to complain. Accord
ing to his letter, my real sin is either in con
fusing him by putting a few good movies on
my best 12 list when he knows that I only like
bad movies, or else in pretending to like a
movie I couldn't really have liked because he
did.
Perverse as this letter is, its stunningly
convoluted logic conceals a fascinating mes
sage: that my column offers Mr. Agnew ma
terial to work off steam on, and he's going to
continue to work off steam, goddamnit,
whether he agrees with me or not. I'm glad I
can provide this service for you, Mr. Agnew.
I sleep much better these nights, secure in
the knowledge that my reviews serve some
purpose.
One of the fringe benefits of being a
movie critic is that you get to receive mail at
two addresses. I keep the letters I've re
ceived from readers since I began working at
the Daily (in the fall of 1980) in a specially
marked envelope in my desk at home, and for
a good year now I ve intended to answer it,
en masse, in this column.
But as long as there are two or three new
movies to write about, turning my attention
to the slowly increasing pile of reverse fan
mail seems a kind of self-indulgence, so the
task has been put off time and time again.
April is always a slack month for movies,
however, and I haven't seen anything worth
reviewing since Bad Boys (my comments on
Max Dugan Returns and Man, Woman and
Child together would scarcely fill a para
graph), so the time seems ripe to address my
invisible correspondents.
The general tone of these letters is
angry—not surprisingly, since most of us
have to be fairly riled up before we are
moved to respond in prose to something
we've read in the papers. They tell me that
my reviews are "long and boring," "pomp
ous pseudo-intellectual hogwash,"
"esoteric drivel," "a collection of inane
statements," "ignorant," "misguided,"
"simplistic," that I am "young and have
to learn," a "condescending communica
tions major who expects to become a pro
fessional critic," a "young snot getting. . .a
first crack at journalism," "a junior Rex Reed
in search of journalistic style"; that I have a
selfish and infantile sense of humor" that
leads me to write "defamatory articles"; and
that my critical concerns are "characteristic
of much of our society today (in which) fact
and competence are valued above ideas and
wisdom, law above justice, and most unfor
tunately money and power above life."
Clearly, I'll have a great deal to answer for on
Judgment Day.
Some of my attackers seem to be laboring
under various misapprehensions about me.
The gentleman who insisted that if I were a
Jew raised in the East I would have detested
Mel Brooks' History of the World, Part I, and
the woman who protested that anyone who
had worked as a secretary would understand
how remarkable a movie 9 to 5 is, didn't
consider the possibility I might be a Jew from
the East (I am) or that I might once have been
employed as a secretary (I was, once, for six
months). Perhaps that is why I can nevertake
such exclusive, in-group smugness, that
presumes we are all cut from one mold or
another, very seriously.
But perhaps a little biographical informa
tion would clear up the strange, hazy picture
some of you seem to have of me. I am 32
years old and in my third year of the doctoral
program in Drama at Stanford; I was born in
Montreal and received my undergraduate

education (as a theater arts major) at Bran
deis University in Boston. I have been writ
ing about movies since 1969—f0r The justice
and WBRS—FM at Brandeis, for The Boston
Phoenix, for various McGill University pub
lications, and now for the Daily. The largest
chunk of the time between my under
graduate and graduate years was spent as a
high school English and drama instructor in
Montreal.
I like Chinese food and rock n' roll and
I'm not really a two-headed monster who
eats babies for breakfast. In other words, I'm
not much different from anyone else, except
for the bizarre but inescapable fact that over
the last 10 years I've seen 1795 movies, old
and new and have written at some length
about 560 of them.
The anger many readers feel when they
disagree with a review is certainly under
standable. Everybody goes to the movies
and everybody has an opinion about what he
sees; it is irritatingto read a public denuncia
tion of a movie you loved. But it is naive to
assume that everyone shares the same per
spective on a film—or even that a movie is
good just because it appeals to you.
I love Casablanca, but I am aware of its
structural haphazardness, its sentimentality,
and the tacky nature of most of the acting in
it. A woman I dated at college told me she
had been touched by Love Story because a
friend of hers had died of leukemia—but her
identification with the film didn't make it a
great tragedy. However, when you point out
what you perceive as the flaws in a movie,
people often overreact, as if you'd attacked
them because they liked the picture.
Consequently, they may lash back with
the sort of bitter, ad hominem criticism I
have provided samples of in the preceding
paragraph. But when I attack a movie I
hated in print—On Golden Pond or Sophie's
Choice—my anger is directed not at the au
diences who applauded it, but at the
filmmakers who produced it and, in the case
of a strategic weeper like On Golden Pond,
have set audiences up, manipulating them
into an emotional response to a picture
which itself contains no honest emotion.
The distance between authentic feeling in a
movie (like Shoot the Moon or Diner) and
cold, mercenary viewer manipulation (as in,
to select a classic example, The Sound of
Music) is as great as the distance between a
work of literature and the latest bestseller by
Judith Krantz.
But whereas no English professor would
think of teaching Princess Daisy to an under
graduate class, the very nature of movies—
an art form that attracts everyone, not just
humanities types—blurs the qualitative dis
tinction between works. So anyone who
professes the ability to rank movies accord
ing to any standard other than popular con
sensus or the Academy Awards risk losing

his credibility. (The same problems exist—in
spades—in rock music criticism.)
Therefore, whenever I indicate that I am
less than enchanted with a picture like
Chariots of Fire or Gandhi, I know that I am
going to make a lot of people uncomfortable
and cause some to complain that I am "too
critical." But if one is not permitted to apply
formal critical criteria to Gandhi —to draw
attention to the obfuscation of the political
issues, the non-development of secondary
characters, the serious dramatic imbalance
in the obsequious, single-tracked script, the
reduction of historical events to
nonsense—just because the movie is so
high-minded, then what on earth is the pur
pose of criticism? Gandhi is so crammed full
of good intentions, and the hero is so re
lentlessly saintly, that many reviewers seem
to feel that to meet it with the same critical
tools as one might a new novel or play would
be, somehow, an act of sacrilege.

7'm not really a two-headed
monster who eats babies for
breakfast.

Similarly, though most of Sophie's
Choice—aside from Meryl Streep's
performance—is atrocious, its highly explo
sive subject matter is assumed to remove it
from the realm of serious criticism. And
when you try to put it back there, someone
may claim, as one reader did when I panned
Mephisto, that you "play Cod." But surely it
is the public, embracing a movie and thus
bringing celebrity and fortune to its makers,
who play God, not I. Richard Attenborough
won't lose a cent because of my negative
review of Gandhi in the Daily.
When a critic gets behind a movie he be
lieves in, he may provoke a different kind of
hatred from some filmgoers. I remember
seeing Shampoo when it came out in 1975
with some friends and friends of friends, and
when I turned out to be the only person in
the crowd who had liked it, all the anger the
movie had generated was suddenly leveled
at me. I was a movie critic and I loved this
picture that they hated so much, so wasn't I
in some measure responsible for the un
pleasant experience they'd just had? (Many
years passed before I went to another movie
in the company of a large group.)
There is, of course, a basic human impulse
at the bottom of such irrational behavior: the
fear that if someone who is supposed to
know something about movies likes a picture
and you don't respond to it in the same way,
then you are inadequate—you've been

found out. The resulting mutual embar
rassment may be an insoluble problem—l
experience a feeling of inadequacy when I
hear a symphony with a trained listener, or
see a dance concert with a balletomane. At
the movies, I can't pretend I know less than I
do—that I haven't seen all the movies I
have—and I can't keep that knowledge and
experience out of my reviews.
Why the hell would I want to? Writing
about movies excites me because it can be
a deeply satisfying intellectual experience,
especially when I'm faced with a film I love
(like Pennies from Heaven), or a film that
even if I don't care for it, presents a number
of critical challenges (like The French
Lieutenant's Woman) or gives me the oppor
tunity to explore ideas that have been taking
shape in my head for some time (like Bet
rayal).
More important, I hold certain principles
about movies—about the difference be
tween honest emotion and emotional man
ipulation, about what good acting is, about
what kinds of projects keep a gifted director
alive (Blow Out) and what kinds numb his
talents (Raiders of the Lost Ark).
The vehemence with which I often write
comes out of my devotion to these principles,
and my disappointment that so many
worthwhile films pass unnoticed. It may
sound perverse to prefer Shoot the Moon to
Ordinary People, Personal Best to Chariots
of Fire, Pennies from Heaven to Fame—but
only because my choices didn't catch fire at
the box office. In an art form that has always
been an industry while, miraculously, con
tinuing to be an art form, box office success
has such status that when you point out that
it has never been proof of quality, people
think you're crazy. But look at some of the
most lucrative pictures of past years—
Academy awards winners like The Great
Ziegfield, The Life of Emile Zola, Mrs. Mi
niver and The Greatest Show on Earth—if
you can sit through them. Furthermore, it is
useful to remember that Moby Dick sold
badly on its first printing.
Inevitably, my principles about what
makes a good movie run up against the prin
ciples of certain representatives of special
interest groups whose perception of movies
is often fixated on their ethnic and political
content. The most patronizing letters I re
ceive are usually from viewers who feel I
should respond to movies as if they were
tracts. One woman writes that my unen
thusiastic reaction to Zoot Suit is the conse
quence of my insufficient understanding of
Chicano culture and demands that I read
Octavio Paz's Labyrinth of Solitude before
presuming to review any other Chicano
films. An incensed anti-nuke activist is appal
led that my review of The Atomic Cafe re
vealed that I had never read Howard Rosen
berg's Atomic Soldiers and that I was "totally

oblivious to the historical record on this sub
ject."
The assumption in each case is that if I
were not so lamentably misinformed (or un
informed) on each of these subjects, I would
appreciate the finer qualities of these two
movies. I doubt it; Zoot Suit and The Atomic
Cafe may be on the side of the angels, but
they are terrible films. Zoot Suit is so exclu
sive and coded that only someone with a
working knowledge of Chicano culture
could comprehend it, which surely indicates
a basic problem in its ability to connect with
the rest of us. And since The Atomic Cafe is
supposed to be a documentary alerting us to
the horrors of nuclear armament, isn't it the
role of the filmmakers to provide the histori
cal information requisite to our understand
ing of the issues? But for the record, I do
make an effort to prepare myself for writing
about new films; this often entails reading
historical material (for a movie like Gandhi
or Mephisto) or familiarizing myself with the
novel on which a picture is based. But one
simply cannot read everything.
My favorite letter comes from a Mr.
John Agnew, and it is such a curio that I
quote the first two paragraphs in full:
"Steve Vineberg's movie reviews (I use
the term 'review' here very loosely) provide
