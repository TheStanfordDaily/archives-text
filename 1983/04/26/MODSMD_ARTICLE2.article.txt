# Elway's sporting career still a question

### MARK ZEIGLER 
The John Elway saga continued yesterday and
i *' Nintlonal rc»orL>ull
League draft scheduled to begin in New York at 8
a.m. EDT.
lust hours before the start of the draft, the
Baltimore Colts still held the No. 1 pick and the
rights to select Stanford's highly touted quarter
back.
Two other franchises — the San Diego Chargers
and Los Angeles Raiders — moved into the pic
ture yesterday as teams to which the Colts might
trade their No. I pick, but neither had finalized a
deal with Baltimore as late as 2 a.m.
Elway, who also has the option of playing pro
fessional baseball for the New York Yankees, has
indicated he does not want to play for the Colts,
an East Coast team that was 0-8-1 in the NFL's
strike-shortened 1982 season.
Whether he will sign with Baltimore if chosen
by the Colts remained up in the air this morning.
But the probability of Baltimore trading away
their No. 1 pick dwindled as the front-running
team in trade talks — the San Diego Chargers —

all but dropped out of the bidding for Elway late
last night.

apparent contender for Baltimore's No. 1 pick.
However, as of early this morning there were no
indications that the Raiders were still dealing for
Elway.
San Diego, which has three first-round pic ks in
the draft, seemed to be in the driver's seat in the
race to get I he rights to Elway.
Charger quarterback Dan Fouts, the NFL
leader in passing yardage the past four seasons,
became a free agent after the 1982 season and has
considered leaving the Chargers for the United
States Football League, which would create a va
cancy Elway could fill.
But the Daily learned late last night Fouts is
"close to signing" with San Diego.
Although ABC Radio Sports reported that
Fouts had indeed re-signed with San Diego,
Charger spokesman Rick Smith denied it and
said contract negotiations had concluded for the

night.
"Fouts is close to signing," Smith said. "He
won 't lit- s/gnc*c/
won't make any difference. If he's going to be
around, he's going to be around."
In other words, Fouts is probably close enough
to inking a contract with the Chargers that the
team abandoned the notion of trading for the
rights to Elway.
Rumors circulated yesterday that the Raiders
may have offered Baltimore star running back
Marcus Allen — the 1982 NFL Rookie of the Year
— as well as high draft picks for Elway.
Other reports had Los Angeles trading for the
first round draft picks of the Chicago Bears (No.
6) and Philadelphia Eagles (No. 8) in an effort to
beef up the package for the Colts.
Baltimore owner Robert Irsay said yesterday
the Raiders "made a fantastic offer of draft
choices and players and I think we'll take it."
A press conference with Elway has been
scheduled for 2 p.m. today in San lose.
