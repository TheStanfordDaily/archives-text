# Noel Paul Stookey—the man, his music, and his life
## On combining faith and music 
### CURTIS GRUENLER 
I Noel Paul Stookey is rather irrepressibly
I inviting — one of the nicest guys you could
fcwant to meet. Waiting backstage after a
l!" recent Peter, Paul & Mary concert at Har
prah's in LakeTahoe, I was ready for a thrill.
K: He came skipping down the stairs, whistl-
I|ing "If I Only Had a Heart" from the
||Wizard of Oz, introduced himself the way
Bsomeone does who is far more interested
Kin you than in himself, and opened himself
||up to five strangers from Stanford as I
Rwould expect few performers to do.
Mk The concert itself had been enough of a
■thrill. The three of them — Stookey, Peter
K Yarrow, and Mary Travers — ran out on
BSstage bearing warm grins and guitars, sur
i;, rounded the microphones, and started
EiSinging. Immediately the songs from my
Imjkparents' old albums c ame to life: "Puff the
KMagic Dragon," "Don't Think Twice,"
■ "Leaving on a Jet Plane," "Blowin' in the
k Wind," and many others.
Peter, Paul & Mary first performed in the
Bspring of 1961. Stookey began by going to
Village in New York to play
E|chess in his spare time, taking his guitar
Bpalong as a hobby. He started picking up
part-time singing engagements when a
ejfolk music producer suggested he get to
ll' gether with Yarrow and Travers. They
112 reached success with their first album, Pe
j|j' ter, Paul & Mary, in 1962, and followed it
■ with a chain of hit singles and albums that
fc spanned the 19605.
On stage, they became renowned both
[ as entertainers and as musical spokesmen
i for a generation just growing up. They put
on, then as now, an exciting show includ
-1*;. ing the rich vocal harmony and joking
interplay of all three together as well as
/ individual acts with Peter doing a sing
jjV along, Paul an impromptu comedy routine
and Mary a couple of solo songs.
After a show they would typically be sur
rounded by a group of young people ask
ing for advice. And amidst their growing
success, they enthusiastically adopted
controversial stands in favor of civil rights
and agianst the Vietnam War. Throughout
it all, their message was one of hope and
brotherhood. Songs such as "If I Had a
Hammer" and "Blowin' in the Wind" still
echo 15 years later as the marching songs
of an optimistic era.
The second half of the '60s, however,
was a time of crisis for Stookey. Seeing that
a peaceful and loving country was not
evolving and that his own personal con
duct centered on drugs and materialism
did not at all match the message he was
singing, he began a search for values that
he could hold on to.
In 1967 he visited friend Bob Dylan, who
counseled him to go back to his high
School neighborhood in Michigan — and

read the Bible. The walk was somewhat
helpful, but his quest continued for sev
eral months until a young man ap
proached him after a concert in Austin,
Texas in 1968.
Normally youths would come to him
with a problem and a few questions, but
this one began to talk about his own con
version to Christianity. Continuing the
conversation in his hotel room, Stookey
soon sensed that the truth he had been
looking for lay in the life of Christ.
In many ways, this was merely the be
ginning of a new search. Stookey's
changed views and recommitment to his
family along with the changing social cli
mate at the end of the '60s took the wind
out of the group's sails. In 1970 Peter, Paul
& Mary parted ways, and all three of them
faced the difficulty of following up a suc
cessful career.
After writing his popular "Wedding
Song (There Is Love)" for Yarrow's wed
ding and releasing a solo album, Stookey
fulfilled a dream by moving out to live on
27 acres in South Blue Hill, Maine. It was a
move to revitalize his family relationships
and "get down to essences," as he said.
And, as it happened, the land also con
tained a four-story hen house ripe for con
version, minus the top story, to an anima
tion and recording studio. Thus Stookey
finished the decade creating animation
and radio shows for children as well as
writing and producing music. And he
began to perform off and on again, mostly
at college and university campuses.
Stookey, Yarrow, and Travers had, of
course, stayed in contact, and, in 1978,
they decided to reunite for what has since
proven to be a continuous streak of occa
sional engagements. The music is the
same, but time and forgetfulness have re
stored the newness and urgency that the
words were losing at the time of the
group's break-up. Even their sound now
offers a radical contrast to contemporary
music. The only instruments are two
acoustic guitars and an occasional cello,
with nothing electronic but the mic
rophones.
The focus is the vocal harmony; the
words are the music, and the music has a
message. A little dose of the folk music
tradition is a welcome relief from the
heartlessness of much of modern music.
Touring for the last few years with his
own band, Bodyworks, Stookey has joined
his folk roots with a Christian perspective
to yield a very accessible, somewhat
unique brand of music. His political
awareness, for instance, is still strongly
present in a recently written song about El
Salvador. And many of the songs are
straight folk tunes, celebrating simple
country values. Indeed, in our conversa

tion he mentioned that he is not well
received in the mainstream of Christian
music for reasons that only seem to make
his music the more challenging and rele
vant.
We had only a short time to talk
backstage at Harrah's as the stage manager
poked in and out remindingStookey that it
was time to prepare for the cocktail show.
But it was enough time to catch a feeling
for the man. He got enthusiastically wrap
ped up in telling us about an opening song
he had just written and, finding explana
tion inadequate, asked if we would like to
hear it. Speechless, we sat down in a dres
sing room and he gave us a once-in-a
lifetime private preview.
Vet even that was, in a way, no more
personal and inspiring than his perform
ance from on stage. Even at that distance it
is plain that something about both
Stookey and his music is almost too good,
too hopeful to be true. Yet he is convinced
that, even in a world gone wrong, the basic
reality is the action of a good and loving
Creator. The message and the messenger
are well worth listening to.

proven to be a continuous streak of occa
sional engagements. The music is the
same, but time and forgetfulness have re
stored the newness and urgency that the
words were losing at the time of the
group's break-up. Even their sound now
offers a radical contrast to contemporary
music. The only instruments are two
acoustic guitars and an occasional cello,
with nothing electronic but the mic
rophones.
The focus is the vocal harmony; the
words are the music, and the music has a
message. A little dose of the folk music
tradition is a welcome relief from the
heartlessness of much of modern music.
Touring for the last few years with his
own band, Bodyworks, Stookey has joined
his folk roots with a Christian perspective
to yield a very accessible, somewhat
unique brand of music. His political
awareness, for instance, is still strongly
present in a recently written song about El
Salvador. And many of the songs are
straight folk tunes, celebrating simple
country values. Indeed, in our conversa

tion he mentioned that he is not well
received in the mainstream of Christian
music for reasons that only seem to make
his music the more challenging and rele
vant.
We had only a short time to talk
backstage at Harrah's as the stage manager
poked in and out remindingStookey that it
was time to prepare for the cocktail show.
But it was enough time to catch a feeling
for the man. He got enthusiastically wrap
ped up in telling us about an opening song
he had just written and, finding explana
tion inadequate, asked if we would like to
hear it. Speechless, we sat down in a dres
sing room and he gave us a once-in-a
lifetime private preview.
Vet even that was, in a way, no more
personal and inspiring than his perform
ance from on stage. Even at that distance it
is plain that something about both
Stookey and his music is almost too good,
too hopeful to be true. Yet he is convinced
that, even in a world gone wrong, the basic
reality is the action of a good and loving
Creator. The message and the messenger
are well worth listening to.

I Noel Paul Stookey is rather irrepressibly
I inviting — one of the nicest guys you could
fcwant to meet. Waiting backstage after a
l!" recent Peter, Paul & Mary concert at Har
prah's in LakeTahoe, I was ready for a thrill.
K: He came skipping down the stairs, whistl-
I|ing "If I Only Had a Heart" from the
||Wizard of Oz, introduced himself the way
Bsomeone does who is far more interested
Kin you than in himself, and opened himself
||up to five strangers from Stanford as I
Rwould expect few performers to do.
Mk The concert itself had been enough of a
■thrill. The three of them — Stookey, Peter
K Yarrow, and Mary Travers — ran out on
BSstage bearing warm grins and guitars, sur
i;, rounded the microphones, and started
EiSinging. Immediately the songs from my
Imjkparents' old albums c ame to life: "Puff the
KMagic Dragon," "Don't Think Twice,"
■ "Leaving on a Jet Plane," "Blowin' in the
k Wind," and many others.
Peter, Paul & Mary first performed in the
Bspring of 1961. Stookey began by going to
Village in New York to play
E|chess in his spare time, taking his guitar
Bpalong as a hobby. He started picking up
part-time singing engagements when a
ejfolk music producer suggested he get to
ll' gether with Yarrow and Travers. They
112 reached success with their first album, Pe
j|j' ter, Paul & Mary, in 1962, and followed it
■ with a chain of hit singles and albums that
fc spanned the 19605.
On stage, they became renowned both
[ as entertainers and as musical spokesmen
i for a generation just growing up. They put
on, then as now, an exciting show includ
-1*;. ing the rich vocal harmony and joking
interplay of all three together as well as
/ individual acts with Peter doing a sing
jjV along, Paul an impromptu comedy routine
and Mary a couple of solo songs.
After a show they would typically be sur
rounded by a group of young people ask
ing for advice. And amidst their growing
success, they enthusiastically adopted
controversial stands in favor of civil rights
and agianst the Vietnam War. Throughout
it all, their message was one of hope and
brotherhood. Songs such as "If I Had a
Hammer" and "Blowin' in the Wind" still
echo 15 years later as the marching songs
of an optimistic era.
The second half of the '60s, however,
was a time of crisis for Stookey. Seeing that
a peaceful and loving country was not
evolving and that his own personal con
duct centered on drugs and materialism
did not at all match the message he was
singing, he began a search for values that
he could hold on to.
In 1967 he visited friend Bob Dylan, who
counseled him to go back to his high
School neighborhood in Michigan — and

read the Bible. The walk was somewhat
helpful, but his quest continued for sev
eral months until a young man ap
proached him after a concert in Austin,
Texas in 1968.
Normally youths would come to him
with a problem and a few questions, but
this one began to talk about his own con
version to Christianity. Continuing the
conversation in his hotel room, Stookey
soon sensed that the truth he had been
looking for lay in the life of Christ.
In many ways, this was merely the be
ginning of a new search. Stookey's
changed views and recommitment to his
family along with the changing social cli
mate at the end of the '60s took the wind
out of the group's sails. In 1970 Peter, Paul
& Mary parted ways, and all three of them
faced the difficulty of following up a suc
cessful career.
After writing his popular "Wedding
Song (There Is Love)" for Yarrow's wed
ding and releasing a solo album, Stookey
fulfilled a dream by moving out to live on
27 acres in South Blue Hill, Maine. It was a
move to revitalize his family relationships
and "get down to essences," as he said.
And, as it happened, the land also con
tained a four-story hen house ripe for con
version, minus the top story, to an anima
tion and recording studio. Thus Stookey
finished the decade creating animation
and radio shows for children as well as
writing and producing music. And he
began to perform off and on again, mostly
at college and university campuses.
