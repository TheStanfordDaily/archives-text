### DAVID SCHMELZER 
Noel Paul Stookey
Memorial Auditorium
April 22, 1983

In 1966, two years before Peter, Paul and Mary
disbanded as a full-time enterprise, a boy came
backstage during their concert in Austin to seek
out Noel "Paul" Stookey. He told him that "God
had put a burden on his heart" for Stookey and
talked to him about the nature of a relationship
with Christ. This, along with Stookey's friend
ship with Bob Dylan, who was going through a
similar search, played a part in the breakup and
led to his later changes in life and music —
changes that now have him playing
"experiential-Gospel in a folk style," as op
posed to Gospel music per se. "The real danger
in what I'm doing," he says, "is being lukewarm
and appealing neither to the converted, who
need a deeper walk, or the unknowing, who
need a deeper stand."
He most likely avoided this danger during last
Friday's concert in Mem Aud, where he was
frank about his feelings towards jesus both in
his patter and his music, music that's still very
much in his '60s folk vein, though now with a
hefty amount of jazz included as well.
In nature and music, Stookey is low-key. His
band is without a drummer and even his rock
oriented numbers come across more with
twinkling-eyed warmth than any particular
soul-splitting passions. Stookey is a bemused
man whose talks with the audience are filled
with impressions and sound effects and mildly
self-deprecatory wit. (As their opening started a
bit slowly with microphone fiddling and guitar
tuninghe mumbled out to theaudience, "This is
what professional showbiz is all about — pac
ing-")
This casual, less-than-threatening air was use
ful to him as he drew the audience into the
action with many sing-alongs, the first coming
early on with "The Garden Song" and one of the
last inevitably being "Puff the Magic Dragon."
By making himself more of a song-leader than a
performer, he gave the evening the air of a
friendly heart-to-heart conversation, having fun
with the problems in learning to play the guitar,
but also sharing a prayer and talking about the
nature of a developing love and leading the au
dience in "Do, Lord" ("Do, Lord. . ./Oh do re
member me").
Some of his humor was, perhaps, ill
conceived for a college audience, as it got
rambling and a bit on the self-conscious side,
with many of his wildest and longest im

pressions seeming to have little to do with his
final point or the song he was introducing. But
his maturity and underlying seriousness seemed
fitting enough. He is distinctively a '"60s"
singer, but not in the manner of a Jimi Hendrix
or even a Dylan, though Peter, Paul and Mary
did many of Dylan's songs. Then and now, while
Stookey seemed concerned, he never seemed
particularly angry, so the vitality of Hendrix's
and Dylan's music is countered by the sobriety
of his. One should see traces of his past in "El
Salvador", an ironically restrained calypso
number describing the country's beautiful
beaches and climate, and saying what a wonder
ful place it would be to go for a drive with your
girlfriend if onlyyou could be sure you wouldn't
be killed on the way.
But much of his concern is focused on the
divided stateof the human condition rather than
on any specific blight. One of his first Christian
songs, "The Wedding Song (There is Love)",
which he says is the all-time bestseller in sheet
music, defines marriage as the symbol of this
needed union (What would be the reason for
becoming man and wife?/lt is love that brings
you here and love that brings you life."). And,
certainly, in his current vision, that reconcilia
tion can only come through application of Chris
tianity. He echoes St. Matthew in "(Peace) In the
Valley", saying, "Before you tell a man he's got a
splinter in his eye, you'better pull the log out of
you."
Even as much as Stookey kidded around with
the audience, in the end he did seem to respect
them, not trying to impress them with himself so
much as to share his songs with them, songs that
were primarily gentle and serious, lacking in
bravado. He claims to stay away from serious
spoken testimony on stage because "I feel that
the testimony is in song. Before I was a Christian
I performed to entertain and be entertained. I
derived a lot of stisfaction out of performing. I
still do. I feel that I am of use to somebody out
there, either intellectually or because I'm touch
ing an area they've thought about."
Stookey did a two-hour-plus show, separated
by a twenty-minute intermission, that included
most of the songs on his newest album, Wait'll
You Hear This!. The Body Works Band, his bac
kups, showcased Karla Thibodeau, who har
monized with Stookey on nearly every song,
adding a Mary Travers touch. She also per
formed two of her own compositions, notably
"Not as We Are", which displayed her deep alto
voice and synthesyzer playing. And certainly she
and the rest of the band mirrored Stookey's
casual, friendly manner.
