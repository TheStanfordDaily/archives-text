# Kennedy addresses issues before L.A. crowd
## 
### 
University President Donald Kennedy ad
dressed a crowd of approximately 400 Stan
ford alumni in Los Angeles on Saturday and
answered questions following his prepared
statement.
In his speech, Kennedy discussed the pre
sent state of education and research and
prospects for the future. He called the current
climate "the most encouraging . . . that we
have seen since the late 19505."
In the question-and-answer period, Ken
nedy commented on:
• The Band. "I emphatically deny that the
Band is a disgrace. . . . I had the moral fiber to
invite them to perform for Her Majesty. . . "

• ROTC. He said Stanford will return to a
full ROTC program "when the services and we
are able to agree on a proposal that either
permits credit bearing courses required by
those ROTC programs to be taught by
Stanford-selected members of the Stanford
faculty or, in the alternative, permit non
credit bearing military courses to qualify for
those requirements set by the . . . services."
• Housing. The new dorms will allow more
students to be housed on campus, he said,
but "we can't say 'never' to the unguaranteed
year — at least not now."
• The University's sensitivity to national de
fense and security needs. "We've had some

policy differences with the government, not
only with regard to ROTC, but with respect to
certain scientific exchanges and with respect
to restriction that the government has sought
to put on research. But by and large, those
issues have been resolved quite success
fully."
• The humanities and social sciences at
Stanford. "The humanities are clearly the
chief worry. As happens sometimes in a
period of economic stress, it's a little difficult
to persuade undergraduates it's still worth
concentrating on the timeless.
"We're trying to do that."
