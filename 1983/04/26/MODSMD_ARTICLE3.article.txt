# Ellsberg lambasts weapons-related research at SSRL
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
Students here "have a chance to
say 'no' " to a proposal that would
help research on nuclear weapons,
anti-war activist Daniel Ellsberg told
300 people at Bishop Auditorium last
night.
In an apparent call for non-violent
action against the proposal, which
will be decided on some time this
week by Arthur Bienenstock, the di
rector of the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), Ellsberg
said, "Bienenstock should make the
decision with every benefit of your
opinion."
Students here should "help
people like (University President
Donald Kennedy) to wake up to the
realities of the nuclear age," Ellsberg
said in reference to Kennedy's an
nouncement that he would "not
interfere" with the proposal.
In the two-hour talk Ellsberg made
fun of Edward Teller, a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution, talked
about his own career as a defense
adviser and anti-war activist, talked
about the destructive capabilities of
modern nuclear weapons and drew
parallels between the imminent de
cision at SSRL and past decisions
concerning nuclear weapons.
Calling Teller a "mythic character"
for his historical role as an opponent
of arms control, Ellsberg mimicked
the 75-year-old scientist and said he
had sought the title of "the father of
the hydrogen bomb." Ellsberg
poked fun at Teller's claim that
"no H-bomb has ever sent me a
Father's Day card" and pointed out
that Father's Day is coming up.
Ellsberg also said Teller is the
proponent of a new generation of
nu i^we.jpons, space-based an
grandson."
Ellsberg pointed out that the pro
posal at SSRL would aid research on
these space-based antimissiles and
said famous arms control advocates
like Wolfgang Panofsky and Sidney
Drell, directorand deputy directorof
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter (SLAC), respectively, have op
posed the development of such an
timissile systems. But, Ellsberg said,
Panofsky missed an opportunity to
follow through on his principles by
announcing that he would not try to
influence the decision at SSRL.
Ellsberg said scientists came within
"shouting distance" of stopping the
arms race in the 1950s when deciding
whether or not to carry through with
development of the hydrogen bomb.
A decision there not to develop

would have fundamentally altered
the future and Bienenstock's deci
sion should be seen in this light,
Ellsberg said.
Ellsberg also said the University of
California is currently the only uni
versity that researches nuclear
weapons, but he claimed it doesn't
like this unique status. He pointd out
that the Lawrence Livermore Na
tional Laboratories, one of the spon
sors of the proposal at SSRL, collabo
rates with the University of California
on weapons research.
Ellsberg also described highlights
of his career as a consultant to Presi
dents Eisenhower, Kennedy,
lohnson and Nixon. He said the
policies of these administrations
were consistently hostile toward the
Soviet Union and Kennedy's asser
tion in 1%1 that there was a "missile
gap" in favor of the Soviet Union was
wrong.
"It was revealed that the Soviet
Union had only four ICBMs (Inter-
Continental Ballistic Missiles)" while
the United States had 200, Ellsberg
said.
In 1961 the United States "still had
what amounted to a monopoly on
strategic nuclear weapons," accord
ing to Ellsberg. United States policy
was, therefore, based on a "first use"
precept, Ellsberg said.
"They (the Soviets) had no ability
to retaliate," he said!
