# Artificial heart inventor addresses research issues
## 
### KEVIN GROSS 
Dr. Robert larvik, inventor of the Jarvik-7 artifi
cial heart, (old students yesterday, "We want to
prolong life in ways that are really worthwhile,
and not as some critics have said, to prolong
death."
Speaking in Terman Auditorium as part of an
engineering course entitled "Other Careers For
Engineers," the University of Utah researcher
stressed that the ultimate goal of the artificial
heart program was to support life in a meaningful
way.
While the students were receptive to the pre
sentation, they asked many probing questions
after the lecture.
larvik, asked about the nature of the patient
selection process which determines who is al
lowed to participate in the experimental pro
gram, said the process screens out all patients
but those who "are very close to death.
"Only a small number of heart attack victims
are able to be treated with artificial hearts," he
said. "We don't believe that this program is a
solution to heart disease."
The potential patients must be referred to the
program by their physic ian or cardiologist, most

of whom are familiar with the program. "We've
refused to accept any patient who contacts us
directly," larvik said.
After the patient is referred, a cardiosurgeon
contacts the patient's physician to discuss the
case. The tinal decision is made by a committee,
which must approve the patient unanimously.
When asked to confirm rumors about a "busi
ness power struggle" between himself and
another doctor involved in the program, larvik
candidly explained that members of the research
team disagreed on the proper fabrication
method for the artificial heart.
"I suppose it's natural in all of these programs
that there are technical disagreements," jarvik
said. "I think it's useful for students to know that
in any program there are divergent points of
view."
According to larvik, the disagreement which
the press had labeled "a power struggle" was
over a decision made about resource allocation
between the two methods, larvik said he felt it
was a question of academic freedom, and that
consequently "we are pursuing both options,"
though most of the resources are going into de
velopment of his model, the Jarvik-7.
Jarvik admitted under questioning that the

costs of the current research phase of the pro
gram are quite high. He suggested, however,
that costs will decrease to affordable levels in the
long-run.
"We think that a reasonable cost target several
years from now for a portable heart system will
be in the range from $15,000 to $20,000. If you
compare these costs to all kinds of other medical
procedures, you'll see that it's not out of line,"
Jarvik said, noting that treatment of patients in
burn units can cost up to $200,000 a day.
One student was concerned about putting
''something mechanical" into a human being,
implying that the artificial heart is somehow un
natural. larvik responded: "I think if you can
change a human being from a dead human being
to a live human being, you're doing a good
thing."
Among the slides he used to illustrate some of
the more technical concepts during his presenta
tion was a mugascan," which shows two ventri
cles of the human heart inside the body. He
compared the heart of Barney Clark (the first
human to receive the Jarvik-7 artificial heart) to a
healthy heart, noting that Clark's heart was
"practically motionless" between the full and
empty phases.
