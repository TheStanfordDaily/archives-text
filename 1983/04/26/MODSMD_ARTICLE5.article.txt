El Salvador to get envoy
Washington— The Reagan administration has
agreed to appoint an ambassador-level special envoy
to El Salvador to help arrange elections this year in
which warring political factions inside and outside the
government can safely participate, according to ad
ministration and congressional sources.
They said the commitment is contained in a draft
letter from Secretary of State George Shultz to Rep.
Clarence Long (D-Md.) chairman of the powerful
House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign op
erations. The subcommittee has been holding up
President Reagan's request to transfer $60 million in
emergency military aid for the government of El
Salvador in its civil war with leftist guerrillas.

The agreement with Long comes during a crucial
week for the president's Central American policy,
which he will defend Wednesday night in a nationally
televised speech before a joint session of Congress.
His performance may well affect votes in several
key committees that are considering cuts in his re
quests for military aid to El Salvador and further re
strictions on Central Intelligence Agency support for
an armed insurgency against the leftist government of
nearby Nicaragua.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.)
yesterday asked the national television networks to
( arry a Democratic response after Reagan's speech.
In another sign of the formidable opposition the
president still faces in Congress, Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.) predicted yesterday

that the Senate would reject Reagan's pleas for sub
stantially increased military and economic aid to El
Salvador.
"The administration is traveling down the wrong
road/' Byrd told a group of reporters, by seeking a
government military victory rather than a negotiated
settlement between combatants in El Salvador. The
United States "ought to be trying to bring about a
dialogue" between the Salvadoran government and
the guerrillas to obtain "a political solution," he said.
Senate investigates Latin policy
Washington — President Reagan's controversial
policies in Central America face mounting opposition
on Capitol Hill, where the Senate will meet behind

closed doors today to discuss what Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) described as "highly
secret" information.
Democrats, supported by some Republicans, de
cided yesterday to insist on the executive session,
Byrd said, so they would be in a better position to re
spond after Reagan defends his policies in an address
to a joint session of Congress Wednesday night.
Byrd and other Democrats said the Senate In
telligence Committee has developed information
showing the administration has violated the law by
supplying aid to forces trying to overthrow the leftist
Nicaraguan government. It is this information, Byrd
said, that is to be discussed at Tuesday's executive ses
sion.
Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) a member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has ac
cused the administration of "breaking the law" by
supporting paramilitary groups against Nicaragua,
plans to make the motion for an executive session af
ter a Senate Democratic caucus that Byrd has called to
discuss Central American policies.
Dodd's motion, which will be seconded by Sen.
Daniel Moynihan, (D-N.Y.) vice chairman of the Sen
ate Intelligence Committee, also has the support of
one Republican on the committee, Sen. David
Durenberger of Minnesota, although only a motion
and a second are required to send the Senate into ex
ecutive session. Byrd said at least five other Re
publican senators also had voiced support for the ses
sion.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
said he had hoped the Senate would hold off on an
executive session until after the president has had an
opportunity to defend his policies before Congress.
But Byrd said, "We'll be better informed and better
able to evaluate the president's judgment and re
spond to his speech from a policy standpoint after we
hold the executive session."
Shultz works for troop removal
Cairo, Egypt — Secretary of State George Shultz
said yesterday that an agreement for withdrawal of Is
raeli forces from Lebanon is "a very do-able thing,"
and promised to use shuttle diplomacy or "whatever
is necessary" to reach such an accord.
Shultz said aboard his airplane en route here that
he was embarking on his mission to revive the admin
istration's flagging Mideast policy without any as
surances from the Arab or Israeli sides on either Leba
non or the wider objective of putting President Rea
gan's Mideast peace plan back on course.
But Shultz emphasized that he is prepared to stay in
the region "as long as there's a chance to accomplish
something."
He said he will first try to break the prolonged Is
raeli-Lebanese stalemate to open the way for with
drawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestine Liberation Or
ganization forces from Lebanon.
In addition, Shultz will be seeking ways to revive
Reagan's peace initiative, dealt a major blow two
weeks ago when talks between Jordan's King Hussein
and PLO leader Yasser Arafat collapsed.
The Reagan initiative calls for Hussein to enter ex
panded peace talks on the future status of the Israeli
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But Hussein has
said he will not come forward unless the PLO author
izes him to negotiate with Israel on behalf of the
Palestinian inhabitants of these territories.
Upon arriving here, Shultz immediately plunged
into a lengthy strategy meeting with Reagan's two
special Middle East envoys, Philip Habib and Morris
Draper, and the U.S. ambassadors to Israel and the
principal Arab countries of the region.
Today Shultz is to meet with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak to seek his views.
However, although Mubarak is a U.S. ally, his im
pact on Shultz's efforts is likely to be marginal be
cause Egypt's peace treaty with Israel has isolated it
from most of the Arab world.
Instead, U.S. officials expect Shultz's mission to
move into high gear Wednesday, when he is sched
utecJ to go to JerusaJem to begin discussions with Is
raeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his aides.
Using Jerusalem as a base, Shultz will visit Beirut
toward the end of the week. He said Sunday that, de
pending on how things develop, he could shuttle
from Israel to Amman, Jordan, and Damascus, Syria,
for discussions with Hussein and Syrian President
Hafez Assad. There also is a strong expectation that at
some point the secretary will journey to Saudi Arabia
to confer with King Fahd.
Feinstein favored to win
Los Angeles —San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feins
tein appears about to win a bizarre recall challenge
with the largest turnout of absentee voters ever in her
city, one more sign of the growing potency of mail
ballots in American politics.
Forced into today's recall election by 24,000 signa
tures collected by a communist anti-gun-control
group called the White Panthers, Feinstein has
launched a $400,000 campaign so successful that it
may leave her without any major opponent when she
runs for a second four-year term in November.

A recent San Francisco Examiner poll shows 75 per
cent of voters opposed to her recall. Her campaign
volunteers have successfully solicited 50,000 absentee
votes in an election unlikely to draw more than
140,000 voters.
Combined with her success in luring the 1984 Dem
ocratic National Convention to San Francisco, Feins
tein's strong response to the recall challenge has
made her far more formidable politically than three
months ago.
At that time disenchantment among gays and liber
als with her efforts to steer a middle course through
the city's political minefield had led several local poli
ticians to consider running against her.
"She is so much stronger than she was before," said
Wendy Nelder, president of the Board of Supervisors,
who opposes Feinstein's recall but has been an ad
versary of the mayor on some issues.
The White Panthers attacked Feinstein for signing
gun-control ordinances that would keep them from
arming themselves against police harassment. This
forced "generally responsible San Francisco people
who disagree with her to come to her defense,"
Nelder said.
In an interview Feinstein acknowledged that, by
forcing her to build a campaign organization so early,
the recall may have frightened off potential Novem
ber opponents.
Even gay activists, who bitterly protested her veto of
a bill to give homosexual partners the equivalent of a
city marriage license, have been unable to develop
the initial anti-Feinstein resentment that fueled the
White Panthers' recall drive.
Austria chooses new chancellor
Vienna, Austria — The Austrian Socialist Party
named Vice Chancellor Fred Sinowatz yesterday as its
choice to succeed Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, who
said he would resign because of the party's failure to
win an absolute majority in Sunday's parliamentary
election.
Sinowatz, little known outside Austria, appears vir
tually certain to succeed the ailing 72-year-old
Kreisky because the Socialist Party, although it did not
win a majority, remains Austria's largest party.
Sinowatz's designation by the party wasannounced
as the Socialists and the two parliamentary opposition
parties completed preparations for what are expected
to be protracted negotiations on the formation of a
coalition to suceed Kreisky's Socialist government. All
three parties announced that they had set up nego
tiating teams headed by their leaders, with the first
round of talks due to begin today.
The Socialists, who had ruled for 12 of the last 13
years as a majority government, won 90 seats in the
election, five fewer than they hold in the outgoing
Parliament, and two fewer than needed for a majority
in the 183-seat body.
Kreisky announced shortly after the results became
known Sunday that he would abide by a pre-election
promise to step down if the party failed to win a ma
jority.
The major opposition party, the Conservative Peo
ple's Party won 81 seats, four more than in the outgo
ing Parliament and the small Freedom Party won 12,
one more than it held previously.
With their combined 93 seats, the two opposition
parties have enough parliamentary votes to form a
coalition government without the Socialists.
Superficially the two opposition parties appear to
have much in common. Both are to the right of the
Socialists and each emphasizes individual initiative
and support for the private sector.
However, they have long been at odds on political
questions and Freedom Party leader Norbert Steger, a
39-year-old lawyer, has indicated that he would pre
fer to enter a coalition with the Socialists.
Alois Mock, 48, leader of the Conservatives, openly
appealed to the Socialists to accept his party as a coali
tion partner. He declared that his party "is in favor of a
wide ranging cooperation among the democratic
parties and we are ready to assume co-responsibility
for the sake of the country."
Kreisky, in announcing Sinowatz as his party's
choice to succeed him, urged the Socialists not to
enter into a coalition with the People's Party, which
has proclaimed itself the big winner in the election.
Socialist win in Portugal
Lisbon, Portugal — The Socialists of former Prime

Minister Mario Soares won more than 35 percent of
the vote in election returns early today for a new 250-
seat Parliament, but must form a coalition to govern.
"The Portuguese people have given the Socialist
Party a mandate to lead the country out of the crisis,"
the 58-year-old lawyer told reporters at his Lisbon
headquarters. Hundreds of supporters paraded out
side with torchlights.
The three-week campaign was dominated by Por
tugal's large foreign debt and other economic prob
lems blamed on the collapsed center-right coalition
of Social Democrats, Christian Democrats and
monarchists.
With 70 percent of the country's 4050 precincts re
porting, the moderate Socialists were ahead with 35.1
percent of the vote, the centrist Social Democrats fol
lowed with 27.8 percent, the pro-Soviet Communists
were running third with 18.5 percent and the conser
vative Christian Democrats had 12.3 percent. The bal
ance was divided among minor parties.
Carlos Mota Pinto, leader of the Social Democrats
— the logical coalition partner — acknowledged the
Socialist victory in a television interview early today,
but would not comment on a possible arrangement
with the Socialists.
Lucas Pires, head of the Christian Democrats, con
gratulated the Socialists but said his party would not
consider joining a coalition. Communist leader
Alvaro Cunhal said his party would "obviously" be in
the opposition.
Yesterday's elections were held on the ninth an
niversary of a military coup that ended nearly a half
century of right-wing dictatorships.
Soares indicated earlier he would seek a coalition
with the Social Democrats if his party got the largest
share of the vote but lacked a majority of seats. How
ever, he told reporters early today that the party
would hold a referendum "as quickly as possible" to
decide how to handle the coalition question.
Hitler diaries not yet released
London — The London Sunday Times strongly in
dicated last night that it would not publish material
said to be Adolph Hitler's diaries until "further in
vestigation" by historians and other specialists veri
fied that the diaries are genuine.
Following yesterday's press conference in Ham
burg, West Germany, at which British historian Hugh
Trevor-Roper revised his previously expressed con
fidence in the diaries' authenticity, the Times man
agement released a carefully worded statement that
also seemed to reflect this view. Journalists on the
newspaper said that once its proprietor, Rupert
Murdoch, had signed the deal for the diaries, no time
had been allowed for independent examination
beyond that by Trevor-Roper.
In urging caution last week, at least one detailed
memo was sent to editors recalling that a decade ago
the newspaper had bought and nearly published
diaries attributed to the Italian dictator Benito
Mussolini that turned out to be forgeries, sources
said. In that case, several experts vouched for the ma
terial before Italian police found it had been fabri
cated by two elderly women.
Last night's statement attributed only to a "spokes
man" implied that partial payment to West Germany's
Stern magazine might be withheld until investigation
of the diaries is satisfactorily completed. It said that
the News Corporation, parent company of the Sun
day Times, had promised to pay $400,000 for British
and Commonwealth rights to the material "over this
year and next."
Times officials refused to expand on the statement,
which followed consultations with the newspaper's
lawyers. But news executives said they were certain
that "every effort would now be made to check the
authenticity" of the material in the three weeks
before extracts of it are next scheduled to appear. The
clear implication — although it is not stated directly —
is that nothing further will appear while doubts re
main.
Moreover, the newspaper will now insist that Stern
permit it substantial access to the documents, which
had been denied previously, sources said.
On Sunday, the Sunday Times published a limited
selection of quotes from the diaries and a lengthy ac
count of how the material was supposed to have been
located and authenticated. All of this information was
supplied by Stern. The newspaper publicly based its
confidence in the material on the assurances of
Trevor-Roper, who had written that he was "satisfied
that the diaries are authentic."

West Bank disease stress related
Jerusalem — Two U.S. doctors from the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta have concluded that the
mysterious illness that affected hundreds of Arab
sc.Tool girls in the West Bank this spring was caused by
"anxiety" and spread by factors originating in the
psyche, the Israeli Health Ministry announced last
night.
Dr. Baruch Modan, the ministry's director-general,
made public at a news conference a summary of the
U.S. doctors' findings, which said there was no evi
dence that the illness was caused by poison as had
been charged by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
territory.
The report also said there was no evidence to sup
port charges by Israeli officials that many of the
schoolgirls had deliberately fabricated the symptoms
of the illness, which included headache, dizziness
and nausea.
The American doctors, Philip Landrigan and Bess
Miller, spent two weeks here at the invitation of the
Israeli government earlier this month after more than
900 West Bank residents, most of them adolescent
girls, were struck by the illness. According to the sum
mary of their report, the first cases of the illness, in the
village of Arraba near Jenin, may have been caused by
low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide gas that were
found in a latrine near the village school.
But the doctors said that medical tests from other
areas where the illness was reported "failed to detect
the consistent presence of any environmental tox
ins."
"We conclude that this epidemic of acute illness
was induced by anxiety," the report said. "It may have
been triggered initially either by psychological factors
or by subtoxic exposure to hydrogen sulfide. Its sub
sequent spread was mediated by psychogenic factors.
Newspaper and radio reports may have contributed
to this spread.
Fight ends for women's leader
Los Angeles — Feminist leader Ginny Foat aban
doned her extradition fight yesterday and was or
dered returned to Louisiana to face a 17-year-old
murder charge, ending her three-month fight to stay
in California.
"Good luck in Louisiana," Municipal Court Judge
Michael Tynan told her following his order for her re
turn. "Your conduct and demeanor in my court have
been exemplary and I wish to commend you for
them."
"Your honor," answered Foat's attorney, "Ms. Foat
has asked me on her behalf to express to the court her
heartfelt thanks for all the courtesies and cooperation
that the court has extended to her."
"You're welcome, Ms. Foat/' Tynan said. "Good
luck."
Foat, 42, on leave from her post as president of the
California chapter of the National Organization for
Women, was then escorted from the courtroom to an
adjacent jail holding area, and, as has become tradi
tional with her court appearances, she ended this one
by blowing a kiss to her supporters. About a dozen,
many who wore buttons saying "Defend Ginny Foat,"
stood and applauded her.
She will be taken into custody by Louisiana detec
tives later yesterday orTuesday morning and flown to
New Orleans, Her attorney, Robert Tullcr, said.
Once in Louisiana, Tuller said he expects a court
there to authorize her release on bail and allow her to
return to California, while she prepares for trial on a
charge that she beat an Argentine businessman to
death near New Orleans in 1965.
Stocks down after surge
New York — The stock market pulled back from last
week's record highs yesterday after the Dow Jones in
dustrial average made a brief run at the 1200 level.
The widely recognized average of 30 blue chip
stocks, up about 5 points in early trading, was down
9.09 at 1187.21 by the close.
Today's weather
Increasing clouds today leading to a chance of show
ers in the afternoon. Highs in the 60s with increasing
southerly winds. Periods of rain likely tonight and
tomorrow. Lows in the upper 40s to low 50s and highs
in the mid 50s to low 60s.

Mussolini that turned out to be forgeries, sources
said. In that case, several experts vouched for the ma
terial before Italian police found it had been fabri
cated by two elderly women.
Last night's statement attributed only to a "spokes
man" implied that partial payment to West Germany's
Stern magazine might be withheld until investigation
of the diaries is satisfactorily completed. It said that
the News Corporation, parent company of the Sun
day Times, had promised to pay $400,000 for British
and Commonwealth rights to the material "over this
year and next."
Times officials refused to expand on the statement,
which followed consultations with the newspaper's
lawyers. But news executives said they were certain
that "every effort would now be made to check the
authenticity" of the material in the three weeks
before extracts of it are next scheduled to appear. The
clear implication — although it is not stated directly —
is that nothing further will appear while doubts re
main.
Moreover, the newspaper will now insist that Stern
permit it substantial access to the documents, which
had been denied previously, sources said.
On Sunday, the Sunday Times published a limited
selection of quotes from the diaries and a lengthy ac
count of how the material was supposed to have been
located and authenticated. All of this information was
supplied by Stern. The newspaper publicly based its
confidence in the material on the assurances of
Trevor-Roper, who had written that he was "satisfied
that the diaries are authentic."

West Bank disease stress related
Jerusalem — Two U.S. doctors from the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta have concluded that the
mysterious illness that affected hundreds of Arab
sc.Tool girls in the West Bank this spring was caused by
"anxiety" and spread by factors originating in the
psyche, the Israeli Health Ministry announced last
night.
Dr. Baruch Modan, the ministry's director-general,
made public at a news conference a summary of the
U.S. doctors' findings, which said there was no evi
dence that the illness was caused by poison as had
been charged by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
territory.
The report also said there was no evidence to sup
port charges by Israeli officials that many of the
schoolgirls had deliberately fabricated the symptoms
of the illness, which included headache, dizziness
and nausea.
The American doctors, Philip Landrigan and Bess
Miller, spent two weeks here at the invitation of the
Israeli government earlier this month after more than
900 West Bank residents, most of them adolescent
girls, were struck by the illness. According to the sum
mary of their report, the first cases of the illness, in the
village of Arraba near Jenin, may have been caused by
low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide gas that were
found in a latrine near the village school.
But the doctors said that medical tests from other
areas where the illness was reported "failed to detect
the consistent presence of any environmental tox
ins."
"We conclude that this epidemic of acute illness
was induced by anxiety," the report said. "It may have
been triggered initially either by psychological factors
or by subtoxic exposure to hydrogen sulfide. Its sub
sequent spread was mediated by psychogenic factors.
Newspaper and radio reports may have contributed
to this spread.
Fight ends for women's leader
Los Angeles — Feminist leader Ginny Foat aban
doned her extradition fight yesterday and was or
dered returned to Louisiana to face a 17-year-old
murder charge, ending her three-month fight to stay
in California.
"Good luck in Louisiana," Municipal Court Judge
Michael Tynan told her following his order for her re
turn. "Your conduct and demeanor in my court have
been exemplary and I wish to commend you for
them."
"Your honor," answered Foat's attorney, "Ms. Foat
has asked me on her behalf to express to the court her
heartfelt thanks for all the courtesies and cooperation
that the court has extended to her."
"You're welcome, Ms. Foat/' Tynan said. "Good
luck."
Foat, 42, on leave from her post as president of the
California chapter of the National Organization for
Women, was then escorted from the courtroom to an
adjacent jail holding area, and, as has become tradi
tional with her court appearances, she ended this one
by blowing a kiss to her supporters. About a dozen,
many who wore buttons saying "Defend Ginny Foat,"
stood and applauded her.
She will be taken into custody by Louisiana detec
tives later yesterday orTuesday morning and flown to
New Orleans, Her attorney, Robert Tullcr, said.
Once in Louisiana, Tuller said he expects a court
there to authorize her release on bail and allow her to
return to California, while she prepares for trial on a
charge that she beat an Argentine businessman to
death near New Orleans in 1965.

El Salvador to get envoy
Washington— The Reagan administration has
agreed to appoint an ambassador-level special envoy
to El Salvador to help arrange elections this year in
which warring political factions inside and outside the
government can safely participate, according to ad
ministration and congressional sources.
They said the commitment is contained in a draft
letter from Secretary of State George Shultz to Rep.
Clarence Long (D-Md.) chairman of the powerful
House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign op
erations. The subcommittee has been holding up
President Reagan's request to transfer $60 million in
emergency military aid for the government of El
Salvador in its civil war with leftist guerrillas.

The agreement with Long comes during a crucial
week for the president's Central American policy,
which he will defend Wednesday night in a nationally
televised speech before a joint session of Congress.
His performance may well affect votes in several
key committees that are considering cuts in his re
quests for military aid to El Salvador and further re
strictions on Central Intelligence Agency support for
an armed insurgency against the leftist government of
nearby Nicaragua.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.)
yesterday asked the national television networks to
( arry a Democratic response after Reagan's speech.
In another sign of the formidable opposition the
president still faces in Congress, Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.) predicted yesterday

that the Senate would reject Reagan's pleas for sub
stantially increased military and economic aid to El
Salvador.
"The administration is traveling down the wrong
road/' Byrd told a group of reporters, by seeking a
government military victory rather than a negotiated
settlement between combatants in El Salvador. The
United States "ought to be trying to bring about a
dialogue" between the Salvadoran government and
the guerrillas to obtain "a political solution," he said.
Senate investigates Latin policy
Washington — President Reagan's controversial
policies in Central America face mounting opposition
on Capitol Hill, where the Senate will meet behind

closed doors today to discuss what Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) described as "highly
secret" information.
Democrats, supported by some Republicans, de
cided yesterday to insist on the executive session,
Byrd said, so they would be in a better position to re
spond after Reagan defends his policies in an address
to a joint session of Congress Wednesday night.
Byrd and other Democrats said the Senate In
telligence Committee has developed information
showing the administration has violated the law by
supplying aid to forces trying to overthrow the leftist
Nicaraguan government. It is this information, Byrd
said, that is to be discussed at Tuesday's executive ses
sion.
Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) a member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has ac
cused the administration of "breaking the law" by
supporting paramilitary groups against Nicaragua,
plans to make the motion for an executive session af
ter a Senate Democratic caucus that Byrd has called to
discuss Central American policies.
Dodd's motion, which will be seconded by Sen.
Daniel Moynihan, (D-N.Y.) vice chairman of the Sen
ate Intelligence Committee, also has the support of
one Republican on the committee, Sen. David
Durenberger of Minnesota, although only a motion
and a second are required to send the Senate into ex
ecutive session. Byrd said at least five other Re
publican senators also had voiced support for the ses
sion.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
said he had hoped the Senate would hold off on an
executive session until after the president has had an
opportunity to defend his policies before Congress.
But Byrd said, "We'll be better informed and better
able to evaluate the president's judgment and re
spond to his speech from a policy standpoint after we
hold the executive session."
Shultz works for troop removal
Cairo, Egypt — Secretary of State George Shultz
said yesterday that an agreement for withdrawal of Is
raeli forces from Lebanon is "a very do-able thing,"
and promised to use shuttle diplomacy or "whatever
is necessary" to reach such an accord.
Shultz said aboard his airplane en route here that
he was embarking on his mission to revive the admin
istration's flagging Mideast policy without any as
surances from the Arab or Israeli sides on either Leba
non or the wider objective of putting President Rea
gan's Mideast peace plan back on course.
But Shultz emphasized that he is prepared to stay in
the region "as long as there's a chance to accomplish
something."
He said he will first try to break the prolonged Is
raeli-Lebanese stalemate to open the way for with
drawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestine Liberation Or
ganization forces from Lebanon.
In addition, Shultz will be seeking ways to revive
Reagan's peace initiative, dealt a major blow two
weeks ago when talks between Jordan's King Hussein
and PLO leader Yasser Arafat collapsed.
The Reagan initiative calls for Hussein to enter ex
panded peace talks on the future status of the Israeli
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But Hussein has
said he will not come forward unless the PLO author
izes him to negotiate with Israel on behalf of the
Palestinian inhabitants of these territories.
Upon arriving here, Shultz immediately plunged
into a lengthy strategy meeting with Reagan's two
special Middle East envoys, Philip Habib and Morris
Draper, and the U.S. ambassadors to Israel and the
principal Arab countries of the region.
Today Shultz is to meet with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak to seek his views.
However, although Mubarak is a U.S. ally, his im
pact on Shultz's efforts is likely to be marginal be
cause Egypt's peace treaty with Israel has isolated it
from most of the Arab world.
Instead, U.S. officials expect Shultz's mission to
move into high gear Wednesday, when he is sched
utecJ to go to JerusaJem to begin discussions with Is
raeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his aides.
Using Jerusalem as a base, Shultz will visit Beirut
toward the end of the week. He said Sunday that, de
pending on how things develop, he could shuttle
from Israel to Amman, Jordan, and Damascus, Syria,
for discussions with Hussein and Syrian President
Hafez Assad. There also is a strong expectation that at
some point the secretary will journey to Saudi Arabia
to confer with King Fahd.
Feinstein favored to win
Los Angeles —San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feins
tein appears about to win a bizarre recall challenge
with the largest turnout of absentee voters ever in her
city, one more sign of the growing potency of mail
ballots in American politics.
Forced into today's recall election by 24,000 signa
tures collected by a communist anti-gun-control
group called the White Panthers, Feinstein has
launched a $400,000 campaign so successful that it
may leave her without any major opponent when she
runs for a second four-year term in November.

A recent San Francisco Examiner poll shows 75 per
cent of voters opposed to her recall. Her campaign
volunteers have successfully solicited 50,000 absentee
votes in an election unlikely to draw more than
140,000 voters.
Combined with her success in luring the 1984 Dem
ocratic National Convention to San Francisco, Feins
tein's strong response to the recall challenge has
made her far more formidable politically than three
months ago.
At that time disenchantment among gays and liber
als with her efforts to steer a middle course through
the city's political minefield had led several local poli
ticians to consider running against her.
"She is so much stronger than she was before," said
Wendy Nelder, president of the Board of Supervisors,
who opposes Feinstein's recall but has been an ad
versary of the mayor on some issues.
The White Panthers attacked Feinstein for signing
gun-control ordinances that would keep them from
arming themselves against police harassment. This
forced "generally responsible San Francisco people
who disagree with her to come to her defense,"
Nelder said.
In an interview Feinstein acknowledged that, by
forcing her to build a campaign organization so early,
the recall may have frightened off potential Novem
ber opponents.
Even gay activists, who bitterly protested her veto of
a bill to give homosexual partners the equivalent of a
city marriage license, have been unable to develop
the initial anti-Feinstein resentment that fueled the
White Panthers' recall drive.
Austria chooses new chancellor
Vienna, Austria — The Austrian Socialist Party
named Vice Chancellor Fred Sinowatz yesterday as its
choice to succeed Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, who
said he would resign because of the party's failure to
win an absolute majority in Sunday's parliamentary
election.
Sinowatz, little known outside Austria, appears vir
tually certain to succeed the ailing 72-year-old
Kreisky because the Socialist Party, although it did not
win a majority, remains Austria's largest party.
Sinowatz's designation by the party wasannounced
as the Socialists and the two parliamentary opposition
parties completed preparations for what are expected
to be protracted negotiations on the formation of a
coalition to suceed Kreisky's Socialist government. All
three parties announced that they had set up nego
tiating teams headed by their leaders, with the first
round of talks due to begin today.
The Socialists, who had ruled for 12 of the last 13
years as a majority government, won 90 seats in the
election, five fewer than they hold in the outgoing
Parliament, and two fewer than needed for a majority
in the 183-seat body.
Kreisky announced shortly after the results became
known Sunday that he would abide by a pre-election
promise to step down if the party failed to win a ma
jority.
The major opposition party, the Conservative Peo
ple's Party won 81 seats, four more than in the outgo
ing Parliament and the small Freedom Party won 12,
one more than it held previously.
With their combined 93 seats, the two opposition
parties have enough parliamentary votes to form a
coalition government without the Socialists.
Superficially the two opposition parties appear to
have much in common. Both are to the right of the
Socialists and each emphasizes individual initiative
and support for the private sector.
However, they have long been at odds on political
questions and Freedom Party leader Norbert Steger, a
39-year-old lawyer, has indicated that he would pre
fer to enter a coalition with the Socialists.
Alois Mock, 48, leader of the Conservatives, openly
appealed to the Socialists to accept his party as a coali
tion partner. He declared that his party "is in favor of a
wide ranging cooperation among the democratic
parties and we are ready to assume co-responsibility
for the sake of the country."
Kreisky, in announcing Sinowatz as his party's
choice to succeed him, urged the Socialists not to
enter into a coalition with the People's Party, which
has proclaimed itself the big winner in the election.
Socialist win in Portugal
Lisbon, Portugal — The Socialists of former Prime

Minister Mario Soares won more than 35 percent of
the vote in election returns early today for a new 250-
seat Parliament, but must form a coalition to govern.
"The Portuguese people have given the Socialist
Party a mandate to lead the country out of the crisis,"
the 58-year-old lawyer told reporters at his Lisbon
headquarters. Hundreds of supporters paraded out
side with torchlights.
The three-week campaign was dominated by Por
tugal's large foreign debt and other economic prob
lems blamed on the collapsed center-right coalition
of Social Democrats, Christian Democrats and
monarchists.
With 70 percent of the country's 4050 precincts re
porting, the moderate Socialists were ahead with 35.1
percent of the vote, the centrist Social Democrats fol
lowed with 27.8 percent, the pro-Soviet Communists
were running third with 18.5 percent and the conser
vative Christian Democrats had 12.3 percent. The bal
ance was divided among minor parties.
Carlos Mota Pinto, leader of the Social Democrats
— the logical coalition partner — acknowledged the
Socialist victory in a television interview early today,
but would not comment on a possible arrangement
with the Socialists.
Lucas Pires, head of the Christian Democrats, con
gratulated the Socialists but said his party would not
consider joining a coalition. Communist leader
Alvaro Cunhal said his party would "obviously" be in
the opposition.
Yesterday's elections were held on the ninth an
niversary of a military coup that ended nearly a half
century of right-wing dictatorships.
Soares indicated earlier he would seek a coalition
with the Social Democrats if his party got the largest
share of the vote but lacked a majority of seats. How
ever, he told reporters early today that the party
would hold a referendum "as quickly as possible" to
decide how to handle the coalition question.
Hitler diaries not yet released
London — The London Sunday Times strongly in
dicated last night that it would not publish material
said to be Adolph Hitler's diaries until "further in
vestigation" by historians and other specialists veri
fied that the diaries are genuine.
Following yesterday's press conference in Ham
burg, West Germany, at which British historian Hugh
Trevor-Roper revised his previously expressed con
fidence in the diaries' authenticity, the Times man
agement released a carefully worded statement that
also seemed to reflect this view. Journalists on the
newspaper said that once its proprietor, Rupert
Murdoch, had signed the deal for the diaries, no time
had been allowed for independent examination
beyond that by Trevor-Roper.
In urging caution last week, at least one detailed
memo was sent to editors recalling that a decade ago
the newspaper had bought and nearly published
diaries attributed to the Italian dictator Benito
Mussolini that turned out to be forgeries, sources
said. In that case, several experts vouched for the ma
terial before Italian police found it had been fabri
cated by two elderly women.
Last night's statement attributed only to a "spokes
man" implied that partial payment to West Germany's
Stern magazine might be withheld until investigation
of the diaries is satisfactorily completed. It said that
the News Corporation, parent company of the Sun
day Times, had promised to pay $400,000 for British
and Commonwealth rights to the material "over this

a bill to give homosexual partners the equivalent of a
city marriage license, have been unable to develop
the initial anti-Feinstein resentment that fueled the
White Panthers' recall drive.
Austria chooses new chancellor
Vienna, Austria — The Austrian Socialist Party
named Vice Chancellor Fred Sinowatz yesterday as its
choice to succeed Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, who
said he would resign because of the party's failure to
win an absolute majority in Sunday's parliamentary
election.
Sinowatz, little known outside Austria, appears vir
tually certain to succeed the ailing 72-year-old
Kreisky because the Socialist Party, although it did not
win a majority, remains Austria's largest party.
Sinowatz's designation by the party wasannounced
as the Socialists and the two parliamentary opposition
parties completed preparations for what are expected
to be protracted negotiations on the formation of a
coalition to suceed Kreisky's Socialist government. All
three parties announced that they had set up nego
tiating teams headed by their leaders, with the first
round of talks due to begin today.
The Socialists, who had ruled for 12 of the last 13
years as a majority government, won 90 seats in the
election, five fewer than they hold in the outgoing
Parliament, and two fewer than needed for a majority
in the 183-seat body.
Kreisky announced shortly after the results became
known Sunday that he would abide by a pre-election
promise to step down if the party failed to win a ma
jority.
The major opposition party, the Conservative Peo
ple's Party won 81 seats, four more than in the outgo
ing Parliament and the small Freedom Party won 12,
one more than it held previously.
With their combined 93 seats, the two opposition
parties have enough parliamentary votes to form a
coalition government without the Socialists.
Superficially the two opposition parties appear to
have much in common. Both are to the right of the
Socialists and each emphasizes individual initiative
and support for the private sector.
However, they have long been at odds on political
questions and Freedom Party leader Norbert Steger, a
39-year-old lawyer, has indicated that he would pre
fer to enter a coalition with the Socialists.
Alois Mock, 48, leader of the Conservatives, openly
appealed to the Socialists to accept his party as a coali
tion partner. He declared that his party "is in favor of a
wide ranging cooperation among the democratic
parties and we are ready to assume co-responsibility
for the sake of the country."
Kreisky, in announcing Sinowatz as his party's
choice to succeed him, urged the Socialists not to
enter into a coalition with the People's Party, which
has proclaimed itself the big winner in the election.
Socialist win in Portugal
Lisbon, Portugal — The Socialists of former Prime

Minister Mario Soares won more than 35 percent of
the vote in election returns early today for a new 250-
seat Parliament, but must form a coalition to govern.
"The Portuguese people have given the Socialist
Party a mandate to lead the country out of the crisis,"
the 58-year-old lawyer told reporters at his Lisbon
headquarters. Hundreds of supporters paraded out
side with torchlights.
The three-week campaign was dominated by Por
tugal's large foreign debt and other economic prob
lems blamed on the collapsed center-right coalition
of Social Democrats, Christian Democrats and
monarchists.
With 70 percent of the country's 4050 precincts re
porting, the moderate Socialists were ahead with 35.1
percent of the vote, the centrist Social Democrats fol
lowed with 27.8 percent, the pro-Soviet Communists
were running third with 18.5 percent and the conser
vative Christian Democrats had 12.3 percent. The bal
ance was divided among minor parties.
Carlos Mota Pinto, leader of the Social Democrats
— the logical coalition partner — acknowledged the
Socialist victory in a television interview early today,
but would not comment on a possible arrangement
with the Socialists.
Lucas Pires, head of the Christian Democrats, con
gratulated the Socialists but said his party would not
consider joining a coalition. Communist leader
Alvaro Cunhal said his party would "obviously" be in
the opposition.
Yesterday's elections were held on the ninth an
niversary of a military coup that ended nearly a half
century of right-wing dictatorships.
Soares indicated earlier he would seek a coalition
with the Social Democrats if his party got the largest
share of the vote but lacked a majority of seats. How
ever, he told reporters early today that the party
would hold a referendum "as quickly as possible" to
decide how to handle the coalition question.
Hitler diaries not yet released
London — The London Sunday Times strongly in
dicated last night that it would not publish material
said to be Adolph Hitler's diaries until "further in
vestigation" by historians and other specialists veri
fied that the diaries are genuine.
Following yesterday's press conference in Ham
burg, West Germany, at which British historian Hugh
Trevor-Roper revised his previously expressed con
fidence in the diaries' authenticity, the Times man
agement released a carefully worded statement that
also seemed to reflect this view. Journalists on the
newspaper said that once its proprietor, Rupert
Murdoch, had signed the deal for the diaries, no time
had been allowed for independent examination
beyond that by Trevor-Roper.
In urging caution last week, at least one detailed
memo was sent to editors recalling that a decade ago
the newspaper had bought and nearly published
diaries attributed to the Italian dictator Benito
Mussolini that turned out to be forgeries, sources
said. In that case, several experts vouched for the ma
terial before Italian police found it had been fabri
cated by two elderly women.
Last night's statement attributed only to a "spokes
man" implied that partial payment to West Germany's
Stern magazine might be withheld until investigation
of the diaries is satisfactorily completed. It said that
the News Corporation, parent company of the Sun
day Times, had promised to pay $400,000 for British
and Commonwealth rights to the material "over this
year and next."
Times officials refused to expand on the statement,
which followed consultations with the newspaper's
lawyers. But news executives said they were certain
that "every effort would now be made to check the
authenticity" of the material in the three weeks
before extracts of it are next scheduled to appear. The
clear implication — although it is not stated directly —
is that nothing further will appear while doubts re
main.
Moreover, the newspaper will now insist that Stern
permit it substantial access to the documents, which
had been denied previously, sources said.
On Sunday, the Sunday Times published a limited
selection of quotes from the diaries and a lengthy ac
count of how the material was supposed to have been
located and authenticated. All of this information was
supplied by Stern. The newspaper publicly based its
confidence in the material on the assurances of
Trevor-Roper, who had written that he was "satisfied
that the diaries are authentic."

West Bank disease stress related
Jerusalem — Two U.S. doctors from the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta have concluded that the
mysterious illness that affected hundreds of Arab
sc.Tool girls in the West Bank this spring was caused by
"anxiety" and spread by factors originating in the
psyche, the Israeli Health Ministry announced last
night.
Dr. Baruch Modan, the ministry's director-general,
made public at a news conference a summary of the
U.S. doctors' findings, which said there was no evi
dence that the illness was caused by poison as had
been charged by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
territory.
The report also said there was no evidence to sup
port charges by Israeli officials that many of the
schoolgirls had deliberately fabricated the symptoms
of the illness, which included headache, dizziness
and nausea.
The American doctors, Philip Landrigan and Bess
Miller, spent two weeks here at the invitation of the
Israeli government earlier this month after more than
900 West Bank residents, most of them adolescent
girls, were struck by the illness. According to the sum
mary of their report, the first cases of the illness, in the
village of Arraba near Jenin, may have been caused by
low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide gas that were
found in a latrine near the village school.
But the doctors said that medical tests from other
areas where the illness was reported "failed to detect
the consistent presence of any environmental tox
ins."
"We conclude that this epidemic of acute illness
was induced by anxiety," the report said. "It may have
been triggered initially either by psychological factors
or by subtoxic exposure to hydrogen sulfide. Its sub
sequent spread was mediated by psychogenic factors.
Newspaper and radio reports may have contributed
to this spread.
Fight ends for women's leader
Los Angeles — Feminist leader Ginny Foat aban
doned her extradition fight yesterday and was or
dered returned to Louisiana to face a 17-year-old
murder charge, ending her three-month fight to stay
in California.
"Good luck in Louisiana," Municipal Court Judge
Michael Tynan told her following his order for her re
turn. "Your conduct and demeanor in my court have
been exemplary and I wish to commend you for
them."
"Your honor," answered Foat's attorney, "Ms. Foat
has asked me on her behalf to express to the court her
heartfelt thanks for all the courtesies and cooperation
that the court has extended to her."
"You're welcome, Ms. Foat/' Tynan said. "Good
luck."
Foat, 42, on leave from her post as president of the
California chapter of the National Organization for
Women, was then escorted from the courtroom to an
adjacent jail holding area, and, as has become tradi
tional with her court appearances, she ended this one
by blowing a kiss to her supporters. About a dozen,
many who wore buttons saying "Defend Ginny Foat,"
stood and applauded her.
She will be taken into custody by Louisiana detec
tives later yesterday orTuesday morning and flown to
New Orleans, Her attorney, Robert Tullcr, said.
Once in Louisiana, Tuller said he expects a court
there to authorize her release on bail and allow her to
return to California, while she prepares for trial on a
charge that she beat an Argentine businessman to
death near New Orleans in 1965.
Stocks down after surge
New York — The stock market pulled back from last

The widely recognized average of 30 blue chip

El Salvador to get envoy
Washington— The Reagan administration has
agreed to appoint an ambassador-level special envoy
to El Salvador to help arrange elections this year in
which warring political factions inside and outside the
government can safely participate, according to ad
ministration and congressional sources.
They said the commitment is contained in a draft
letter from Secretary of State George Shultz to Rep.
Clarence Long (D-Md.) chairman of the powerful
House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign op
erations. The subcommittee has been holding up
President Reagan's request to transfer $60 million in
emergency military aid for the government of El
Salvador in its civil war with leftist guerrillas.

The agreement with Long comes during a crucial
week for the president's Central American policy,
which he will defend Wednesday night in a nationally
televised speech before a joint session of Congress.
His performance may well affect votes in several
key committees that are considering cuts in his re
quests for military aid to El Salvador and further re
strictions on Central Intelligence Agency support for
an armed insurgency against the leftist government of
nearby Nicaragua.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.)
yesterday asked the national television networks to
( arry a Democratic response after Reagan's speech.
In another sign of the formidable opposition the
president still faces in Congress, Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.) predicted yesterday

that the Senate would reject Reagan's pleas for sub
stantially increased military and economic aid to El
Salvador.
"The administration is traveling down the wrong
road/' Byrd told a group of reporters, by seeking a
government military victory rather than a negotiated
settlement between combatants in El Salvador. The
United States "ought to be trying to bring about a
dialogue" between the Salvadoran government and
the guerrillas to obtain "a political solution," he said.
Senate investigates Latin policy
Washington — President Reagan's controversial
policies in Central America face mounting opposition
on Capitol Hill, where the Senate will meet behind

closed doors today to discuss what Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) described as "highly
secret" information.
Democrats, supported by some Republicans, de
cided yesterday to insist on the executive session,
Byrd said, so they would be in a better position to re
spond after Reagan defends his policies in an address
to a joint session of Congress Wednesday night.
Byrd and other Democrats said the Senate In
telligence Committee has developed information
showing the administration has violated the law by
supplying aid to forces trying to overthrow the leftist
Nicaraguan government. It is this information, Byrd
said, that is to be discussed at Tuesday's executive ses
sion.
Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) a member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has ac
cused the administration of "breaking the law" by
supporting paramilitary groups against Nicaragua,
plans to make the motion for an executive session af
ter a Senate Democratic caucus that Byrd has called to
discuss Central American policies.
Dodd's motion, which will be seconded by Sen.
Daniel Moynihan, (D-N.Y.) vice chairman of the Sen
ate Intelligence Committee, also has the support of
one Republican on the committee, Sen. David
Durenberger of Minnesota, although only a motion
and a second are required to send the Senate into ex
ecutive session. Byrd said at least five other Re
publican senators also had voiced support for the ses
sion.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
said he had hoped the Senate would hold off on an
executive session until after the president has had an
opportunity to defend his policies before Congress.
But Byrd said, "We'll be better informed and better
able to evaluate the president's judgment and re
spond to his speech from a policy standpoint after we
hold the executive session."
Shultz works for troop removal
Cairo, Egypt — Secretary of State George Shultz
said yesterday that an agreement for withdrawal of Is
raeli forces from Lebanon is "a very do-able thing,"
and promised to use shuttle diplomacy or "whatever
is necessary" to reach such an accord.
Shultz said aboard his airplane en route here that
he was embarking on his mission to revive the admin
istration's flagging Mideast policy without any as
surances from the Arab or Israeli sides on either Leba
non or the wider objective of putting President Rea
gan's Mideast peace plan back on course.
But Shultz emphasized that he is prepared to stay in
the region "as long as there's a chance to accomplish
something."
He said he will first try to break the prolonged Is
raeli-Lebanese stalemate to open the way for with
drawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestine Liberation Or
ganization forces from Lebanon.
In addition, Shultz will be seeking ways to revive
Reagan's peace initiative, dealt a major blow two
weeks ago when talks between Jordan's King Hussein
and PLO leader Yasser Arafat collapsed.
The Reagan initiative calls for Hussein to enter ex
panded peace talks on the future status of the Israeli
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But Hussein has
said he will not come forward unless the PLO author
izes him to negotiate with Israel on behalf of the
Palestinian inhabitants of these territories.
Upon arriving here, Shultz immediately plunged
into a lengthy strategy meeting with Reagan's two
special Middle East envoys, Philip Habib and Morris
Draper, and the U.S. ambassadors to Israel and the
principal Arab countries of the region.
Today Shultz is to meet with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak to seek his views.
However, although Mubarak is a U.S. ally, his im
pact on Shultz's efforts is likely to be marginal be
cause Egypt's peace treaty with Israel has isolated it
from most of the Arab world.
Instead, U.S. officials expect Shultz's mission to
move into high gear Wednesday, when he is sched
utecJ to go to JerusaJem to begin discussions with Is
raeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his aides.
Using Jerusalem as a base, Shultz will visit Beirut
toward the end of the week. He said Sunday that, de
pending on how things develop, he could shuttle
from Israel to Amman, Jordan, and Damascus, Syria,
for discussions with Hussein and Syrian President
Hafez Assad. There also is a strong expectation that at
some point the secretary will journey to Saudi Arabia
to confer with King Fahd.
Feinstein favored to win
Los Angeles —San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feins
tein appears about to win a bizarre recall challenge
with the largest turnout of absentee voters ever in her
city, one more sign of the growing potency of mail
ballots in American politics.
Forced into today's recall election by 24,000 signa
tures collected by a communist anti-gun-control
group called the White Panthers, Feinstein has
launched a $400,000 campaign so successful that it
may leave her without any major opponent when she
runs for a second four-year term in November.

A recent San Francisco Examiner poll shows 75 per
cent of voters opposed to her recall. Her campaign
volunteers have successfully solicited 50,000 absentee
votes in an election unlikely to draw more than
140,000 voters.
Combined with her success in luring the 1984 Dem
ocratic National Convention to San Francisco, Feins
tein's strong response to the recall challenge has
made her far more formidable politically than three
months ago.
At that time disenchantment among gays and liber
als with her efforts to steer a middle course through
the city's political minefield had led several local poli
ticians to consider running against her.
"She is so much stronger than she was before," said
Wendy Nelder, president of the Board of Supervisors,
who opposes Feinstein's recall but has been an ad
versary of the mayor on some issues.
The White Panthers attacked Feinstein for signing
gun-control ordinances that would keep them from
arming themselves against police harassment. This
forced "generally responsible San Francisco people
who disagree with her to come to her defense,"
Nelder said.
In an interview Feinstein acknowledged that, by
forcing her to build a campaign organization so early,
the recall may have frightened off potential Novem
ber opponents.
Even gay activists, who bitterly protested her veto of
a bill to give homosexual partners the equivalent of a
city marriage license, have been unable to develop
the initial anti-Feinstein resentment that fueled the
White Panthers' recall drive.
Austria chooses new chancellor

Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has ac
cused the administration of "breaking the law" by
supporting paramilitary groups against Nicaragua,
plans to make the motion for an executive session af
ter a Senate Democratic caucus that Byrd has called to
discuss Central American policies.
Dodd's motion, which will be seconded by Sen.
Daniel Moynihan, (D-N.Y.) vice chairman of the Sen
ate Intelligence Committee, also has the support of
one Republican on the committee, Sen. David
Durenberger of Minnesota, although only a motion
and a second are required to send the Senate into ex
ecutive session. Byrd said at least five other Re
publican senators also had voiced support for the ses
sion.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
said he had hoped the Senate would hold off on an
executive session until after the president has had an
opportunity to defend his policies before Congress.
But Byrd said, "We'll be better informed and better
able to evaluate the president's judgment and re
spond to his speech from a policy standpoint after we
hold the executive session."
Shultz works for troop removal
Cairo, Egypt — Secretary of State George Shultz
said yesterday that an agreement for withdrawal of Is
raeli forces from Lebanon is "a very do-able thing,"
and promised to use shuttle diplomacy or "whatever
is necessary" to reach such an accord.
Shultz said aboard his airplane en route here that
he was embarking on his mission to revive the admin
istration's flagging Mideast policy without any as
surances from the Arab or Israeli sides on either Leba
non or the wider objective of putting President Rea
gan's Mideast peace plan back on course.
But Shultz emphasized that he is prepared to stay in
the region "as long as there's a chance to accomplish
something."
He said he will first try to break the prolonged Is
raeli-Lebanese stalemate to open the way for with
drawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestine Liberation Or
ganization forces from Lebanon.
In addition, Shultz will be seeking ways to revive
Reagan's peace initiative, dealt a major blow two
weeks ago when talks between Jordan's King Hussein
and PLO leader Yasser Arafat collapsed.
The Reagan initiative calls for Hussein to enter ex
panded peace talks on the future status of the Israeli
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But Hussein has
said he will not come forward unless the PLO author
izes him to negotiate with Israel on behalf of the
Palestinian inhabitants of these territories.
Upon arriving here, Shultz immediately plunged
into a lengthy strategy meeting with Reagan's two
special Middle East envoys, Philip Habib and Morris
Draper, and the U.S. ambassadors to Israel and the
principal Arab countries of the region.
Today Shultz is to meet with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak to seek his views.
However, although Mubarak is a U.S. ally, his im
pact on Shultz's efforts is likely to be marginal be
cause Egypt's peace treaty with Israel has isolated it
from most of the Arab world.
Instead, U.S. officials expect Shultz's mission to
move into high gear Wednesday, when he is sched
utecJ to go to JerusaJem to begin discussions with Is
raeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his aides.
Using Jerusalem as a base, Shultz will visit Beirut
toward the end of the week. He said Sunday that, de
pending on how things develop, he could shuttle
from Israel to Amman, Jordan, and Damascus, Syria,
for discussions with Hussein and Syrian President
Hafez Assad. There also is a strong expectation that at
some point the secretary will journey to Saudi Arabia
to confer with King Fahd.
Feinstein favored to win
Los Angeles —San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feins
tein appears about to win a bizarre recall challenge
with the largest turnout of absentee voters ever in her
city, one more sign of the growing potency of mail
ballots in American politics.
Forced into today's recall election by 24,000 signa
tures collected by a communist anti-gun-control
group called the White Panthers, Feinstein has
launched a $400,000 campaign so successful that it
may leave her without any major opponent when she
runs for a second four-year term in November.

A recent San Francisco Examiner poll shows 75 per
cent of voters opposed to her recall. Her campaign
volunteers have successfully solicited 50,000 absentee
votes in an election unlikely to draw more than
140,000 voters.
Combined with her success in luring the 1984 Dem
ocratic National Convention to San Francisco, Feins
tein's strong response to the recall challenge has
made her far more formidable politically than three
months ago.
At that time disenchantment among gays and liber
als with her efforts to steer a middle course through
the city's political minefield had led several local poli
ticians to consider running against her.
"She is so much stronger than she was before," said
Wendy Nelder, president of the Board of Supervisors,
who opposes Feinstein's recall but has been an ad
versary of the mayor on some issues.
The White Panthers attacked Feinstein for signing
gun-control ordinances that would keep them from
arming themselves against police harassment. This
forced "generally responsible San Francisco people
who disagree with her to come to her defense,"
Nelder said.
In an interview Feinstein acknowledged that, by
forcing her to build a campaign organization so early,
the recall may have frightened off potential Novem
ber opponents.
Even gay activists, who bitterly protested her veto of
a bill to give homosexual partners the equivalent of a
city marriage license, have been unable to develop
the initial anti-Feinstein resentment that fueled the
White Panthers' recall drive.
Austria chooses new chancellor
Vienna, Austria — The Austrian Socialist Party
named Vice Chancellor Fred Sinowatz yesterday as its
choice to succeed Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, who
said he would resign because of the party's failure to
win an absolute majority in Sunday's parliamentary
election.
Sinowatz, little known outside Austria, appears vir
tually certain to succeed the ailing 72-year-old
Kreisky because the Socialist Party, although it did not
win a majority, remains Austria's largest party.
Sinowatz's designation by the party wasannounced
as the Socialists and the two parliamentary opposition
parties completed preparations for what are expected
to be protracted negotiations on the formation of a
coalition to suceed Kreisky's Socialist government. All
three parties announced that they had set up nego
tiating teams headed by their leaders, with the first
round of talks due to begin today.
The Socialists, who had ruled for 12 of the last 13
years as a majority government, won 90 seats in the
election, five fewer than they hold in the outgoing
Parliament, and two fewer than needed for a majority
in the 183-seat body.
Kreisky announced shortly after the results became
known Sunday that he would abide by a pre-election
promise to step down if the party failed to win a ma
jority.
The major opposition party, the Conservative Peo
ple's Party won 81 seats, four more than in the outgo
ing Parliament and the small Freedom Party won 12,
one more than it held previously.
With their combined 93 seats, the two opposition
parties have enough parliamentary votes to form a
coalition government without the Socialists.
Superficially the two opposition parties appear to
have much in common. Both are to the right of the
Socialists and each emphasizes individual initiative
and support for the private sector.
However, they have long been at odds on political
questions and Freedom Party leader Norbert Steger, a
39-year-old lawyer, has indicated that he would pre
fer to enter a coalition with the Socialists.
Alois Mock, 48, leader of the Conservatives, openly
appealed to the Socialists to accept his party as a coali
tion partner. He declared that his party "is in favor of a
wide ranging cooperation among the democratic
parties and we are ready to assume co-responsibility
for the sake of the country."
Kreisky, in announcing Sinowatz as his party's
choice to succeed him, urged the Socialists not to
enter into a coalition with the People's Party, which
has proclaimed itself the big winner in the election.
Socialist win in Portugal
Lisbon, Portugal — The Socialists of former Prime

Minister Mario Soares won more than 35 percent of
the vote in election returns early today for a new 250-
seat Parliament, but must form a coalition to govern.
"The Portuguese people have given the Socialist
Party a mandate to lead the country out of the crisis,"
the 58-year-old lawyer told reporters at his Lisbon
headquarters. Hundreds of supporters paraded out
side with torchlights.
The three-week campaign was dominated by Por
tugal's large foreign debt and other economic prob
lems blamed on the collapsed center-right coalition
of Social Democrats, Christian Democrats and
monarchists.
With 70 percent of the country's 4050 precincts re
porting, the moderate Socialists were ahead with 35.1
percent of the vote, the centrist Social Democrats fol
lowed with 27.8 percent, the pro-Soviet Communists
were running third with 18.5 percent and the conser
vative Christian Democrats had 12.3 percent. The bal
ance was divided among minor parties.
Carlos Mota Pinto, leader of the Social Democrats
— the logical coalition partner — acknowledged the
Socialist victory in a television interview early today,
but would not comment on a possible arrangement
with the Socialists.
Lucas Pires, head of the Christian Democrats, con
gratulated the Socialists but said his party would not
consider joining a coalition. Communist leader
Alvaro Cunhal said his party would "obviously" be in
the opposition.
Yesterday's elections were held on the ninth an
niversary of a military coup that ended nearly a half
century of right-wing dictatorships.
Soares indicated earlier he would seek a coalition
with the Social Democrats if his party got the largest
share of the vote but lacked a majority of seats. How
ever, he told reporters early today that the party
would hold a referendum "as quickly as possible" to
decide how to handle the coalition question.
Hitler diaries not yet released
London — The London Sunday Times strongly in
dicated last night that it would not publish material
said to be Adolph Hitler's diaries until "further in
vestigation" by historians and other specialists veri
fied that the diaries are genuine.
Following yesterday's press conference in Ham
burg, West Germany, at which British historian Hugh
Trevor-Roper revised his previously expressed con
fidence in the diaries' authenticity, the Times man
agement released a carefully worded statement that
also seemed to reflect this view. Journalists on the
newspaper said that once its proprietor, Rupert
Murdoch, had signed the deal for the diaries, no time
had been allowed for independent examination
beyond that by Trevor-Roper.
In urging caution last week, at least one detailed
memo was sent to editors recalling that a decade ago
the newspaper had bought and nearly published
diaries attributed to the Italian dictator Benito
Mussolini that turned out to be forgeries, sources
said. In that case, several experts vouched for the ma
terial before Italian police found it had been fabri
cated by two elderly women.
Last night's statement attributed only to a "spokes
man" implied that partial payment to West Germany's
Stern magazine might be withheld until investigation
of the diaries is satisfactorily completed. It said that
the News Corporation, parent company of the Sun
day Times, had promised to pay $400,000 for British
and Commonwealth rights to the material "over this
year and next."
Times officials refused to expand on the statement,
which followed consultations with the newspaper's
lawyers. But news executives said they were certain
that "every effort would now be made to check the
authenticity" of the material in the three weeks
before extracts of it are next scheduled to appear. The
clear implication — although it is not stated directly —
is that nothing further will appear while doubts re
main.
Moreover, the newspaper will now insist that Stern
permit it substantial access to the documents, which
had been denied previously, sources said.
On Sunday, the Sunday Times published a limited
selection of quotes from the diaries and a lengthy ac
count of how the material was supposed to have been
located and authenticated. All of this information was
supplied by Stern. The newspaper publicly based its
confidence in the material on the assurances of
Trevor-Roper, who had written that he was "satisfied
that the diaries are authentic."

West Bank disease stress related
Jerusalem — Two U.S. doctors from the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta have concluded that the
mysterious illness that affected hundreds of Arab
sc.Tool girls in the West Bank this spring was caused by
"anxiety" and spread by factors originating in the
psyche, the Israeli Health Ministry announced last
night.
Dr. Baruch Modan, the ministry's director-general,
made public at a news conference a summary of the
U.S. doctors' findings, which said there was no evi
dence that the illness was caused by poison as had
been charged by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
territory.
The report also said there was no evidence to sup
port charges by Israeli officials that many of the
schoolgirls had deliberately fabricated the symptoms
of the illness, which included headache, dizziness
and nausea.
The American doctors, Philip Landrigan and Bess
Miller, spent two weeks here at the invitation of the
Israeli government earlier this month after more than
900 West Bank residents, most of them adolescent
girls, were struck by the illness. According to the sum
mary of their report, the first cases of the illness, in the
village of Arraba near Jenin, may have been caused by
low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide gas that were
found in a latrine near the village school.
But the doctors said that medical tests from other
areas where the illness was reported "failed to detect
the consistent presence of any environmental tox
ins."
"We conclude that this epidemic of acute illness
was induced by anxiety," the report said. "It may have
been triggered initially either by psychological factors
or by subtoxic exposure to hydrogen sulfide. Its sub
sequent spread was mediated by psychogenic factors.
Newspaper and radio reports may have contributed
to this spread.
Fight ends for women's leader
Los Angeles — Feminist leader Ginny Foat aban
doned her extradition fight yesterday and was or
dered returned to Louisiana to face a 17-year-old
murder charge, ending her three-month fight to stay
in California.
"Good luck in Louisiana," Municipal Court Judge
Michael Tynan told her following his order for her re
turn. "Your conduct and demeanor in my court have
been exemplary and I wish to commend you for
them."
"Your honor," answered Foat's attorney, "Ms. Foat
has asked me on her behalf to express to the court her
heartfelt thanks for all the courtesies and cooperation
that the court has extended to her."
"You're welcome, Ms. Foat/' Tynan said. "Good
luck."
Foat, 42, on leave from her post as president of the
California chapter of the National Organization for
Women, was then escorted from the courtroom to an
adjacent jail holding area, and, as has become tradi
tional with her court appearances, she ended this one
by blowing a kiss to her supporters. About a dozen,
many who wore buttons saying "Defend Ginny Foat,"
stood and applauded her.
She will be taken into custody by Louisiana detec
tives later yesterday orTuesday morning and flown to
New Orleans, Her attorney, Robert Tullcr, said.
Once in Louisiana, Tuller said he expects a court
there to authorize her release on bail and allow her to
return to California, while she prepares for trial on a
charge that she beat an Argentine businessman to
death near New Orleans in 1965.
Stocks down after surge
New York — The stock market pulled back from last

9.09 at 1187.21 by the close.

El Salvador to get envoy
Washington— The Reagan administration has
agreed to appoint an ambassador-level special envoy
to El Salvador to help arrange elections this year in
which warring political factions inside and outside the
government can safely participate, according to ad
ministration and congressional sources.
They said the commitment is contained in a draft
letter from Secretary of State George Shultz to Rep.
Clarence Long (D-Md.) chairman of the powerful
House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign op
erations. The subcommittee has been holding up
President Reagan's request to transfer $60 million in
emergency military aid for the government of El
Salvador in its civil war with leftist guerrillas.

The agreement with Long comes during a crucial
week for the president's Central American policy,
which he will defend Wednesday night in a nationally
televised speech before a joint session of Congress.
His performance may well affect votes in several
key committees that are considering cuts in his re
quests for military aid to El Salvador and further re
strictions on Central Intelligence Agency support for
an armed insurgency against the leftist government of
nearby Nicaragua.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.)
yesterday asked the national television networks to
( arry a Democratic response after Reagan's speech.
In another sign of the formidable opposition the
president still faces in Congress, Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.) predicted yesterday

that the Senate would reject Reagan's pleas for sub
stantially increased military and economic aid to El
Salvador.
"The administration is traveling down the wrong
road/' Byrd told a group of reporters, by seeking a
government military victory rather than a negotiated
settlement between combatants in El Salvador. The
United States "ought to be trying to bring about a
dialogue" between the Salvadoran government and
the guerrillas to obtain "a political solution," he said.
Senate investigates Latin policy
Washington — President Reagan's controversial
policies in Central America face mounting opposition
on Capitol Hill, where the Senate will meet behind

closed doors today to discuss what Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) described as "highly
secret" information.
Democrats, supported by some Republicans, de
cided yesterday to insist on the executive session,
Byrd said, so they would be in a better position to re
spond after Reagan defends his policies in an address
to a joint session of Congress Wednesday night.
Byrd and other Democrats said the Senate In
telligence Committee has developed information
showing the administration has violated the law by
supplying aid to forces trying to overthrow the leftist
Nicaraguan government. It is this information, Byrd
said, that is to be discussed at Tuesday's executive ses
sion.
Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) a member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has ac
cused the administration of "breaking the law" by
supporting paramilitary groups against Nicaragua,
plans to make the motion for an executive session af
ter a Senate Democratic caucus that Byrd has called to
discuss Central American policies.
Dodd's motion, which will be seconded by Sen.
Daniel Moynihan, (D-N.Y.) vice chairman of the Sen
ate Intelligence Committee, also has the support of
one Republican on the committee, Sen. David
Durenberger of Minnesota, although only a motion
and a second are required to send the Senate into ex
ecutive session. Byrd said at least five other Re
publican senators also had voiced support for the ses
sion.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
said he had hoped the Senate would hold off on an
executive session until after the president has had an
opportunity to defend his policies before Congress.
But Byrd said, "We'll be better informed and better
able to evaluate the president's judgment and re

found in a latrine near the village school.
But the doctors said that medical tests from other
areas where the illness was reported "failed to detect
the consistent presence of any environmental tox
ins."
"We conclude that this epidemic of acute illness
was induced by anxiety," the report said. "It may have
been triggered initially either by psychological factors
or by subtoxic exposure to hydrogen sulfide. Its sub
sequent spread was mediated by psychogenic factors.
Newspaper and radio reports may have contributed
to this spread.
Fight ends for women's leader
Los Angeles — Feminist leader Ginny Foat aban
doned her extradition fight yesterday and was or
dered returned to Louisiana to face a 17-year-old
murder charge, ending her three-month fight to stay
in California.
"Good luck in Louisiana," Municipal Court Judge
Michael Tynan told her following his order for her re
turn. "Your conduct and demeanor in my court have
been exemplary and I wish to commend you for
them."
"Your honor," answered Foat's attorney, "Ms. Foat
has asked me on her behalf to express to the court her
heartfelt thanks for all the courtesies and cooperation
that the court has extended to her."
"You're welcome, Ms. Foat/' Tynan said. "Good
luck."
Foat, 42, on leave from her post as president of the
California chapter of the National Organization for
Women, was then escorted from the courtroom to an
adjacent jail holding area, and, as has become tradi
tional with her court appearances, she ended this one
by blowing a kiss to her supporters. About a dozen,
many who wore buttons saying "Defend Ginny Foat,"
stood and applauded her.
She will be taken into custody by Louisiana detec
tives later yesterday orTuesday morning and flown to
New Orleans, Her attorney, Robert Tullcr, said.
Once in Louisiana, Tuller said he expects a court
there to authorize her release on bail and allow her to
return to California, while she prepares for trial on a
charge that she beat an Argentine businessman to
death near New Orleans in 1965.

El Salvador to get envoy
Washington— The Reagan administration has
agreed to appoint an ambassador-level special envoy
to El Salvador to help arrange elections this year in
which warring political factions inside and outside the
government can safely participate, according to ad
ministration and congressional sources.
They said the commitment is contained in a draft
letter from Secretary of State George Shultz to Rep.
Clarence Long (D-Md.) chairman of the powerful
House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign op
erations. The subcommittee has been holding up
President Reagan's request to transfer $60 million in
emergency military aid for the government of El
Salvador in its civil war with leftist guerrillas.

The agreement with Long comes during a crucial
week for the president's Central American policy,
which he will defend Wednesday night in a nationally
televised speech before a joint session of Congress.
His performance may well affect votes in several
key committees that are considering cuts in his re
quests for military aid to El Salvador and further re
strictions on Central Intelligence Agency support for
an armed insurgency against the leftist government of
nearby Nicaragua.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.)
yesterday asked the national television networks to
( arry a Democratic response after Reagan's speech.
In another sign of the formidable opposition the
president still faces in Congress, Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.) predicted yesterday

that the Senate would reject Reagan's pleas for sub
stantially increased military and economic aid to El
Salvador.
"The administration is traveling down the wrong
road/' Byrd told a group of reporters, by seeking a
government military victory rather than a negotiated
settlement between combatants in El Salvador. The
United States "ought to be trying to bring about a
dialogue" between the Salvadoran government and
the guerrillas to obtain "a political solution," he said.
Senate investigates Latin policy
Washington — President Reagan's controversial
policies in Central America face mounting opposition
on Capitol Hill, where the Senate will meet behind

closed doors today to discuss what Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) described as "highly
secret" information.
Democrats, supported by some Republicans, de
cided yesterday to insist on the executive session,
Byrd said, so they would be in a better position to re
spond after Reagan defends his policies in an address
to a joint session of Congress Wednesday night.
Byrd and other Democrats said the Senate In
telligence Committee has developed information
showing the administration has violated the law by
supplying aid to forces trying to overthrow the leftist
Nicaraguan government. It is this information, Byrd
said, that is to be discussed at Tuesday's executive ses
sion.
Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) a member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who has ac
cused the administration of "breaking the law" by
supporting paramilitary groups against Nicaragua,
plans to make the motion for an executive session af
ter a Senate Democratic caucus that Byrd has called to
discuss Central American policies.
Dodd's motion, which will be seconded by Sen.
Daniel Moynihan, (D-N.Y.) vice chairman of the Sen
ate Intelligence Committee, also has the support of
one Republican on the committee, Sen. David
Durenberger of Minnesota, although only a motion
and a second are required to send the Senate into ex
ecutive session. Byrd said at least five other Re
publican senators also had voiced support for the ses
sion.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
said he had hoped the Senate would hold off on an
executive session until after the president has had an
opportunity to defend his policies before Congress.
But Byrd said, "We'll be better informed and better
able to evaluate the president's judgment and re
spond to his speech from a policy standpoint after we
hold the executive session."
Shultz works for troop removal
Cairo, Egypt — Secretary of State George Shultz
said yesterday that an agreement for withdrawal of Is
raeli forces from Lebanon is "a very do-able thing,"
and promised to use shuttle diplomacy or "whatever
is necessary" to reach such an accord.
Shultz said aboard his airplane en route here that
he was embarking on his mission to revive the admin
istration's flagging Mideast policy without any as
surances from the Arab or Israeli sides on either Leba
non or the wider objective of putting President Rea
gan's Mideast peace plan back on course.
But Shultz emphasized that he is prepared to stay in
the region "as long as there's a chance to accomplish
something."
He said he will first try to break the prolonged Is
raeli-Lebanese stalemate to open the way for with
drawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestine Liberation Or
ganization forces from Lebanon.
In addition, Shultz will be seeking ways to revive
Reagan's peace initiative, dealt a major blow two
weeks ago when talks between Jordan's King Hussein
and PLO leader Yasser Arafat collapsed.
The Reagan initiative calls for Hussein to enter ex
panded peace talks on the future status of the Israeli
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But Hussein has
said he will not come forward unless the PLO author
izes him to negotiate with Israel on behalf of the
Palestinian inhabitants of these territories.
Upon arriving here, Shultz immediately plunged
into a lengthy strategy meeting with Reagan's two
special Middle East envoys, Philip Habib and Morris
Draper, and the U.S. ambassadors to Israel and the
principal Arab countries of the region.
Today Shultz is to meet with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak to seek his views.
However, although Mubarak is a U.S. ally, his im
pact on Shultz's efforts is likely to be marginal be
cause Egypt's peace treaty with Israel has isolated it
from most of the Arab world.
Instead, U.S. officials expect Shultz's mission to
move into high gear Wednesday, when he is sched
utecJ to go to JerusaJem to begin discussions with Is
raeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and his aides.
Using Jerusalem as a base, Shultz will visit Beirut
toward the end of the week. He said Sunday that, de
pending on how things develop, he could shuttle
from Israel to Amman, Jordan, and Damascus, Syria,
for discussions with Hussein and Syrian President
Hafez Assad. There also is a strong expectation that at
some point the secretary will journey to Saudi Arabia
to confer with King Fahd.
Feinstein favored to win
Los Angeles —San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feins
tein appears about to win a bizarre recall challenge
with the largest turnout of absentee voters ever in her
city, one more sign of the growing potency of mail
ballots in American politics.
Forced into today's recall election by 24,000 signa
tures collected by a communist anti-gun-control
group called the White Panthers, Feinstein has
launched a $400,000 campaign so successful that it
may leave her without any major opponent when she
runs for a second four-year term in November.

A recent San Francisco Examiner poll shows 75 per
cent of voters opposed to her recall. Her campaign
volunteers have successfully solicited 50,000 absentee
votes in an election unlikely to draw more than
140,000 voters.
Combined with her success in luring the 1984 Dem
ocratic National Convention to San Francisco, Feins
tein's strong response to the recall challenge has
made her far more formidable politically than three
months ago.
At that time disenchantment among gays and liber
als with her efforts to steer a middle course through
the city's political minefield had led several local poli
ticians to consider running against her.
"She is so much stronger than she was before," said
Wendy Nelder, president of the Board of Supervisors,
who opposes Feinstein's recall but has been an ad
versary of the mayor on some issues.
The White Panthers attacked Feinstein for signing
gun-control ordinances that would keep them from
arming themselves against police harassment. This
forced "generally responsible San Francisco people
who disagree with her to come to her defense,"
Nelder said.
In an interview Feinstein acknowledged that, by
forcing her to build a campaign organization so early,
the recall may have frightened off potential Novem
ber opponents.
Even gay activists, who bitterly protested her veto of
a bill to give homosexual partners the equivalent of a
city marriage license, have been unable to develop
the initial anti-Feinstein resentment that fueled the
White Panthers' recall drive.
Austria chooses new chancellor
Vienna, Austria — The Austrian Socialist Party
named Vice Chancellor Fred Sinowatz yesterday as its
choice to succeed Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, who
said he would resign because of the party's failure to
win an absolute majority in Sunday's parliamentary
election.
Sinowatz, little known outside Austria, appears vir
tually certain to succeed the ailing 72-year-old
Kreisky because the Socialist Party, although it did not
win a majority, remains Austria's largest party.
Sinowatz's designation by the party wasannounced
as the Socialists and the two parliamentary opposition
parties completed preparations for what are expected
to be protracted negotiations on the formation of a
coalition to suceed Kreisky's Socialist government. All
three parties announced that they had set up nego
tiating teams headed by their leaders, with the first
round of talks due to begin today.
The Socialists, who had ruled for 12 of the last 13
years as a majority government, won 90 seats in the
election, five fewer than they hold in the outgoing
Parliament, and two fewer than needed for a majority
in the 183-seat body.
Kreisky announced shortly after the results became
known Sunday that he would abide by a pre-election
promise to step down if the party failed to win a ma
jority.
The major opposition party, the Conservative Peo
ple's Party won 81 seats, four more than in the outgo
ing Parliament and the small Freedom Party won 12,
one more than it held previously.
With their combined 93 seats, the two opposition
parties have enough parliamentary votes to form a
coalition government without the Socialists.
Superficially the two opposition parties appear to
have much in common. Both are to the right of the
Socialists and each emphasizes individual initiative
and support for the private sector.
However, they have long been at odds on political
questions and Freedom Party leader Norbert Steger, a
39-year-old lawyer, has indicated that he would pre
fer to enter a coalition with the Socialists.
Alois Mock, 48, leader of the Conservatives, openly
appealed to the Socialists to accept his party as a coali
tion partner. He declared that his party "is in favor of a
wide ranging cooperation among the democratic
parties and we are ready to assume co-responsibility
for the sake of the country."
Kreisky, in announcing Sinowatz as his party's
choice to succeed him, urged the Socialists not to
enter into a coalition with the People's Party, which
has proclaimed itself the big winner in the election.
Socialist win in Portugal
Lisbon, Portugal — The Socialists of former Prime

Minister Mario Soares won more than 35 percent of
the vote in election returns early today for a new 250-
seat Parliament, but must form a coalition to govern.
"The Portuguese people have given the Socialist
Party a mandate to lead the country out of the crisis,"
the 58-year-old lawyer told reporters at his Lisbon
headquarters. Hundreds of supporters paraded out
side with torchlights.
The three-week campaign was dominated by Por
tugal's large foreign debt and other economic prob
lems blamed on the collapsed center-right coalition
of Social Democrats, Christian Democrats and
monarchists.
With 70 percent of the country's 4050 precincts re
porting, the moderate Socialists were ahead with 35.1
percent of the vote, the centrist Social Democrats fol
lowed with 27.8 percent, the pro-Soviet Communists
were running third with 18.5 percent and the conser
vative Christian Democrats had 12.3 percent. The bal
ance was divided among minor parties.
Carlos Mota Pinto, leader of the Social Democrats
— the logical coalition partner — acknowledged the
Socialist victory in a television interview early today,
but would not comment on a possible arrangement
with the Socialists.
Lucas Pires, head of the Christian Democrats, con
gratulated the Socialists but said his party would not
consider joining a coalition. Communist leader
Alvaro Cunhal said his party would "obviously" be in
the opposition.
Yesterday's elections were held on the ninth an
niversary of a military coup that ended nearly a half
century of right-wing dictatorships.
Soares indicated earlier he would seek a coalition
with the Social Democrats if his party got the largest
share of the vote but lacked a majority of seats. How
ever, he told reporters early today that the party
would hold a referendum "as quickly as possible" to
decide how to handle the coalition question.
Hitler diaries not yet released
London — The London Sunday Times strongly in
dicated last night that it would not publish material
said to be Adolph Hitler's diaries until "further in
vestigation" by historians and other specialists veri
fied that the diaries are genuine.
Following yesterday's press conference in Ham
burg, West Germany, at which British historian Hugh
Trevor-Roper revised his previously expressed con
fidence in the diaries' authenticity, the Times man
agement released a carefully worded statement that
also seemed to reflect this view. Journalists on the
newspaper said that once its proprietor, Rupert
Murdoch, had signed the deal for the diaries, no time
had been allowed for independent examination
beyond that by Trevor-Roper.
In urging caution last week, at least one detailed
memo was sent to editors recalling that a decade ago
the newspaper had bought and nearly published
diaries attributed to the Italian dictator Benito
Mussolini that turned out to be forgeries, sources
said. In that case, several experts vouched for the ma
terial before Italian police found it had been fabri
cated by two elderly women.
Last night's statement attributed only to a "spokes
man" implied that partial payment to West Germany's
Stern magazine might be withheld until investigation
of the diaries is satisfactorily completed. It said that
the News Corporation, parent company of the Sun
day Times, had promised to pay $400,000 for British
and Commonwealth rights to the material "over this
year and next."
Times officials refused to expand on the statement,
which followed consultations with the newspaper's
lawyers. But news executives said they were certain
that "every effort would now be made to check the
authenticity" of the material in the three weeks
before extracts of it are next scheduled to appear. The
clear implication — although it is not stated directly —
is that nothing further will appear while doubts re
main.
Moreover, the newspaper will now insist that Stern
permit it substantial access to the documents, which
had been denied previously, sources said.
On Sunday, the Sunday Times published a limited
selection of quotes from the diaries and a lengthy ac
count of how the material was supposed to have been
located and authenticated. All of this information was
supplied by Stern. The newspaper publicly based its
confidence in the material on the assurances of
Trevor-Roper, who had written that he was "satisfied
that the diaries are authentic."

West Bank disease stress related
Jerusalem — Two U.S. doctors from the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta have concluded that the
mysterious illness that affected hundreds of Arab
sc.Tool girls in the West Bank this spring was caused by
"anxiety" and spread by factors originating in the
psyche, the Israeli Health Ministry announced last
night.
Dr. Baruch Modan, the ministry's director-general,
made public at a news conference a summary of the
U.S. doctors' findings, which said there was no evi
dence that the illness was caused by poison as had
been charged by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied
territory.
The report also said there was no evidence to sup
port charges by Israeli officials that many of the
schoolgirls had deliberately fabricated the symptoms
of the illness, which included headache, dizziness
and nausea.
The American doctors, Philip Landrigan and Bess
Miller, spent two weeks here at the invitation of the
Israeli government earlier this month after more than
900 West Bank residents, most of them adolescent
girls, were struck by the illness. According to the sum
mary of their report, the first cases of the illness, in the
village of Arraba near Jenin, may have been caused by
low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide gas that were
found in a latrine near the village school.
But the doctors said that medical tests from other
areas where the illness was reported "failed to detect
the consistent presence of any environmental tox
ins."
"We conclude that this epidemic of acute illness
was induced by anxiety," the report said. "It may have
been triggered initially either by psychological factors
or by subtoxic exposure to hydrogen sulfide. Its sub
sequent spread was mediated by psychogenic factors.
Newspaper and radio reports may have contributed
to this spread.
