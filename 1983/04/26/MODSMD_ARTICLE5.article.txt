El Salvador to get envoy
Washington— The Reagan administration has
agreed to appoint an ambassador-level special envoy
to El Salvador to help arrange elections this year in
which warring political factions inside and outside the
government can safely participate, according to ad
ministration and congressional sources.
They said the commitment is contained in a draft
letter from Secretary of State George Shultz to Rep.
Clarence Long (D-Md.) chairman of the powerful
House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign op
erations. The subcommittee has been holding up
President Reagan's request to transfer $60 million in
emergency military aid for the government of El
Salvador in its civil war with leftist guerrillas.

The agreement with Long comes during a crucial
week for the president's Central American policy,
which he will defend Wednesday night in a nationally
televised speech before a joint session of Congress.
His performance may well affect votes in several
key committees that are considering cuts in his re
quests for military aid to El Salvador and further re
strictions on Central Intelligence Agency support for
an armed insurgency against the leftist government of
nearby Nicaragua.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.)
yesterday asked the national television networks to
( arry a Democratic response after Reagan's speech.
In another sign of the formidable opposition the
president still faces in Congress, Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.) predicted yesterday

that the Senate would reject Reagan's pleas for sub
stantially increased military and economic aid to El
Salvador.
"The administration is traveling down the wrong
road/' Byrd told a group of reporters, by seeking a
government military victory rather than a negotiated
settlement between combatants in El Salvador. The
United States "ought to be trying to bring about a
dialogue" between the Salvadoran government and
the guerrillas to obtain "a political solution," he said.
Senate investigates Latin policy
Washington — President Reagan's controversial
policies in Central America face mounting opposition
on Capitol Hill, where the Senate will meet behind

closed doors today to discuss what Senate Minority
Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) described as "highly
secret" information.
Democrats, supported by some Republicans, de
cided yesterday to insist on the executive session,
Byrd said, so they would be in a better position to re
spond after Reagan defends his policies in an address
to a joint session of Congress Wednesday night.
Byrd and other Democrats said the Senate In
telligence Committee has developed information
showing the administration has violated the law by
supplying aid to forces trying to overthrow the leftist
Nicaraguan government. It is this information, Byrd
said, that is to be discussed at Tuesday's executive ses
sion.
