## Students choose major for fulfillment, opportunities 
### SHEILA HENNESSEY 
At first glance, one may be
struck more by the similarities
than by the differences among
students here. But behind the
sameness of bicycles,
backpacks and bustling masses
en route to Tresidder Union
lies an extremely diverse stu
dent body.
Part of this diversity rests in
the fact that each student here
has his own objectives regard
ing what he hopes to gain from
his education. These objectives
influence one of the most im
portant decisions he will make
while at Stanford — the choice
of a major.
The reasons behind each stu
dent's "major" decision are ex
tremely varied.
Students here — more than
at most other universities — are
able to major in programs
which incorporate anything
they are interested in, accord
ing to Audrey Bernfield, coor
dinator for department student
services in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences and di
rector of advising for the Hu
man Biology Department.
The University has created
several flexible programs. First,
it gives students the option of
creating a self-designed major,
and second, it offers in
terdisciplinary programs such
as the human biology major.
Many students cite this flex
ibility — the ability to take
courses in a variety of subjects
— as an important factor in
choosing a particular major.
Junior Jennifer Cannon, a
human biology major, said her
favorite aspect of the program
is that .. it gives you enough
freedom and enough time to
figure out what you're in
terested in and kind of design
you major."
Emily Ghilarducci, a
sophomore planning to major
in human biology, agreed. "It's
a really integrated major and
brings in all the fields I'm in
terested in," she said.
While the human biology
program is designed specifical

ly to be interdisciplinary, other
single discipline seem to offer
this same flexibility because
they require completion of
fewer units of classwork in the
area of the major than most
other majors.
Junior Jim Backer, a history
major, said this is a strong point
of the history major. "It's not so
stringent that you can't take
classes in a lot of different
areas."
Senior Sue Robichek said the
same is true of the interna
tional relations major, which
requires two years of foreign
language but less than 60 units
of international relations
coursework. The relatively
light requirements allowed her
the time to take classes in other
areas and to go overseas.
The flexibility totakecourses
in a variety of areas is a key
aspect of education, said Chris
Shinkman, director of the Ca
reer Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC). "The purpose
of an undergraduate education
... is to ahve a broadening ex
perience. I think it's a mistake
to become too specialized and
narrow on the undergraduate
level," he said. "I'm concerned
when students say 'Where are
the jobs?' or 'What degrees are
the most marketable?' and
then decide on a major. That's
the tail wagging the dog."
Instead, Shinkman said, stu
dentsshould base the choice of
a major on their interests and
on the areas in which their
skills and abilities lie.
He insisted that careers in ev
ery field are open to liberal arts
majors as well as to students
who major in more "practical"
disciplines, although students
should supplement a liberal
arts major with practical ex
perience such as internships,
worthwhile summer jobs and
computer courses.
Bemfield agreed with
Shinkman that students should
choose a major because it in
terests them rather than be
cause it is marketable. "If you
do something with all your

heart, and do it well, you'll suc
ceed," she said. She also
claimed that jobs in all fields
are open to liberal arts majors
and has spent a great deal of
time contacting alumni with
liberal arts degrees who now
have jobs ranging from operat
ing computers to practicing
medicine.
A liberal arts degree gave
these graduates a broad educa
tion, and a perspective on life
rather than a focus on jobs
only.
According to Martin Evans,
dean of undergraduate studies
for the English Department,
the department has main
tained a steady enrollment,
perhaps slightly increasing,
during the past few years. Most
students major in English be
cause they relish the "pleasure,
excitement and stimulation" of
literature.
Many students decide to ma
jor in English after intending to
major in a different subject,
Evans said. They take an English
course and greatly enjoy it, he
said. But he also receives feed
back from alumni that English
is excellent job preparation be
cause it teaches organizational
and analytic skills.
Most students agree that it is
helpful to be interested in
one's field of study. "I think
you learn better when you do
what you really want to do,"
Backer said.
But for some students the
main criterion for choosing a
major remains the market
ability of the degree. Steve
Cougar, a graduate student in
engineering economic sys
tems, said he chose his under
graduate systems engineering
major because he wanted
some type of engineering ma
jor for its job potential.
Other students, though ma
joring in an area which in
terests them, find a way to in
crease its practicality.
Cannon, for example, chose
economics as her human
biology area of concentration.
"An economics background

will make me more versatile,"
she said. "I'm nervous about
what I'm going to do out
there."
Senior Amy Worth has also
tried to gain more practical ex
perience by combining her his
tory major with an economics
major, and said she feels it will
make her more employable.
The choice of two majors
seems to be a satisfactory de
cision for other students as
well. Junior Tom Blaisdell is
double majoring in mechanical
engineering and German stud
ies ". . . for your basic reasons
— money and fun." Although
he said he enjoys German stud
ies more, hestayswith mechan
ical engineering because he
likes the fact that he is being
trained to actually do some

thing concrete. His decision to
double major provided him
with the flexibility to take
classes outside of engineering,
and he no longer feels he is get
ting a one-sided education and
missingout on part of Stanford.
While both Blaisdell and
Worth appear to have found
majors which satisfy their most
important criteria, both said
they never made a conscious
decision as to their choice of
major. Instead, the majors hap
pened to correspond with the
type of classes they were taking
and in which they were per
forming well.
Although many students fall
haphazardly into a major, oth
ers come to Stanford with their
course already charted.
Larry Goldstein, a junior ma

joring in medical micro
biology, plans to become a
doctor. Like many pre-meds,
he made his decision prior to
coming to Stanford. In fact, he
knew since the age of six that
he wanted to be a doctor. "I
had a really neat family physi
cian when I was younger and
he inspired me," he said.
Like Goldstein, Pam Epstein,
a junior majoring in industrial
engineering, knew before
coming to Stanford that she
wanted to work for Disney. She
decided that her major would
be the best preparation for the
type of job she wanted to
pursue.
"I don't enjoy the late hours
at LOTS," she said. But she
added that she is glad she
chose her major because of

what it will allow her to do.
While for some students the
decision of what to be or not to
be is easy, for others, the
choice entails a substantial
amount of time. Many spend a
good part of their under
graduate years simply deciding
on what they should concen
trate.
Though often frustrating,
perhaps this "shopping
around" is not all bad, for it
gives a taste of all that the Uni
versity has to offer rather than
just a specialized path to a ca
reer.
After all, Shinkman said,
"Higher education — educa
tion at Stanford — is education
for life, not just a job."
