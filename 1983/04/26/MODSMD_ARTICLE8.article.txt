## The 						Stanford Daily Jobseekers: stay in school 
### 
The disheartening news from a report by Rus
sell Rumberger, a research associate in the Insti
tute for Research on Educational Finance and
Governance at the School of Education, that the
job market for college graduates will be bleak
during the next decade portends a grim future
for jobseekers.
Rumberger's report suggests that college
graduates will soon glut the job marketplace at
the same time as the percentage of high-level
professional jobs decreases.
The prospects for women and minorities are
even worse, states the report, because many of
their gains in the job market in recentyears have
come in the government sector, whose size is
being reduced by federal and state administra
tions nationwide.
These trends in the job market come at the
same time as college students are increasingly
turning from the humanities toward more pre
professional fields.

Because of the popularity of "practical"
majors among many undergraduates, univer
sities must strive to protect the already embat
tled humanitiesfrom further cuts in both money
and talent. Some educators argue that the time
less quality of a liberal arts education makes a
broad education particularly important in times
of job uncertainty.
In fact, the University is doing something to
counteract the decline of the humanities. A
Humanities Center, established in 1980 at the
behest of University President Donald Ken
nedy, has the specific goal of enhancing the
quality and reputation of humanities program
here and functioning as an institution where
scholars in the humanities could study.
Despite a tight job market students and uni
versities should remember the basic goal of an
education: to teach one to think, not merely to
train one for a job.
