# 1984: Quebecois style
## 
### 
If someone told you of a country
with a linguistic minority of about 10
percent of the population, where the
minority language was completely
banned from public signs and com
mercial advertisements, and where
children of minority-language
speakers are routinely forced to at
tend majority-language schools, you
would undoubtedly grimace with
shock and say "Where? Where did
that happen? Nazi Germany? Soviet
Russia? It sounds like something out
of George Orwell."
Indeed it does, but it's not. This
story, in fact, comes from the Cana
dian province of Quebec, where
stamping out the English language
(mother tongue of 10 percent of all
Quebecers) has become the first
order of business for the Provincial
Government.
The ruling party in Quebec (cur
rentty holding an cyyr&rwhdming
majority in the Provincial Legislature)
is the Parti Quebecois, a nationalist
group which came to power in 1976,
and which advocates ultimate inde
pendence for Quebec. In 1980
Quebec's voters refused, by a 60-40
margin, to give the PQ government
authority to negotiate for
"sovereign-association."
Despite this rebuff, however, the
PQ was re-elected in 1981 and con
tinues to press for the cultural inde
pendence of Quebec and the integ
rity of its French heritage. At least,
that's how the "Frenchification"
program might be sympathetically (if
not too accurately) described. "Cul
tural genocide" would be closer to
the truth.
A newly created "Office de la Lan
gue Francaise" (shades of Orwell's
Ministry of Truth) has the job of en
forcing the new unilingual regime in
Quebec. Mostly, it goes around cit
ing shopkeepers and restaurateurs
for the no-no of having any vestiges
of the English language in their pub
lic signs. They're a little lenient with
proper names; a place called
"Jack's" doesn't have to be renamed
"Chez Jacques," for example. It suf
fices to eradicate the apostrophe (so
as to read "Jacks"); apostrophes,
you see, don't exist in the French
language.
Vive la difference? Apparently not
in Quebec. One amusing result of
the new policy was recounted re
cently by the Christian Science
Monitor's Montreal correspondent.
It seems the "tongue-troopers" (the
sobriquet given to Quebec's linguis
tic enforcers) changed the name of a
certain avenue in Montreal from
"Mountain Street" to "Rue de la

Montagne"; only one problem: the
street was named after Bishop Moun
tain, a Canadian historiral figure.
Talk about a faux pas. Perhaps to be
bullheadedly consistent they'll go
around and change his name in all
the history books, too. Now there's a
job for Orwell's Winston Smith.
Unfortunately, this program of lin
guistic genocide is more than gauche
and idiotic. I find it not amusing, but
downright sinister, that a burden of
proof is placed on English-speaking
parents in Quebec to show why their
children should not be forced to at
tend a French-language school. This
particular rule may be principally re
sponsible for the departure of the
many thousands of English-speaking
Quebecers who have already emig
rated from Quebec, which is un
doubtedly the unspoken purpose of
the whole program.
The most tragic and senseless as
pect of the new unilingualism in
Quebec is its effect on Montreal,
second only to New York as the great
international city of North America, a
vibrant melting pot of French, En
glish, Chinese, Italian and many
other ethnic groups, coexisting in in
vigorating diversity. The new, fascist
notion that all people should be
forced to communicate publicly in
the majority language threatens to
cast a pall of French orthodoxy over
this most international of cities, acity
that could be the definition for "vive
la difference."
The large English minority in
Montreal (there's even a major
English-language university there:
McGill University) has already been
deprived by law of the privilege of
shopping with the help of English ad
vertisements. Will the colorful
Chinese-character neon signs of
Chinatown be next? One can only
hope not. Sun-Life Insurance of
Canada left Montreal a few years ago
out of a combined fear of Quebecois
independence and the final set of
language laws scheduled to go into
effect next year (by unhappy coinci
dence, 1984). Those restrictions will
require all public agencies and pub
licly chartered corporations not only
to conduct all their public communi
cations in French, but also all their
internal communications. Internal
memos, even from one English
speaking person to another, would
have to be entirely in French.
Perhaps by this time you are won
dering if all this wouldn't be more
than a little unconstitutional if it oc
curred in the United States, as an in
fringement of free speech, not to
mpntion the Equal Protection

Clause. You're right, it would. And if
certain indications are correct, it may
also be unconstitutional in Canada.
Just last year Canada enacted for the
first time its own comprehensive
Constitution, containinga Charter of
Liberties, and, more significantly,
guarantees of linguistic and cultural
rights for all ethnic and linguistic
groups in Canada. Canadian federal
judges have thus started striking
down some of the "tongue-trooper"
laws as unconstitutional. One can
only hope the process will continue.
The most ironic thing about the en
tire "Frenchification" program of the
Parti Quebecois is that it has oc
curred against the background of a
Canada which has already made
generous concessions to the protec
tion of French minorities in the other
provinces. Although French
speakers constitute only about a fifth
of all Canada, French and English arc
now the coequal official languages of
the nation, as anyone who has used
Canadian currency knows. Even in
British Columbia, where the
English-French ratio is 48-1, every
single commercial item of sale has
both an English and French rendition
of all information on it, as required
by Canadian federal law throughout
the country. And that's great.
But one can imagine the indigna
tion of English-speaking Canadians,
now that Canada is bilingual, to find
that Quebec wants to go unilingual,
as if in retaliation for the days now
past when French was unfairly ne
glected, and Quebec was treated
condescendingly as the poor relative
of English Canada. And how much
worse that Quebec wants to vic
timize in particular its own English
minority, after the scrupulous pro
tection that has been afforded the
often far smaller French minorities in
the other provinces.
Speaking as one who loves French
food and culture, who spent four
years in high school learning that
euphonious language, and who has
had the pleasure of visiting both
France and Quebec, I am shocked
and saddened that language — the
unique characteristic of humanity —
should be twisted and perverted into
a political tool, a vindictive club with
which to batter linguistic minorities.
The tongue-troopers roam in
Quebec, constantly on the look-out
for crime-language; and I see shades
of 1984. It's just a pity it has to be
spelled in French.
