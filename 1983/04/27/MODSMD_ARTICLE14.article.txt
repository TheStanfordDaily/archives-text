The community has long recognized the top
ranking of the Law School, the Engineering
School and the Graduate School of Business.
But the School of Education consistently — and
quietly — also receives No. 1 ranking year after
year.
Last week, the results of a nation-wide rank
ing once again showed Stanford's School of
Education as No. 1. Yet the result, unlike top
rankings for the Business School and Law
School, was scarcely talked about among mem
bers of the community. This phenomenon is
perhaps indicative of the pre-professional at
titude prevalent here, which often psychologi
cally gives non-pre-professional studies secon
dary status.
School of Education Dean Myron Atkin, a
former high school science teacher, em

phasizes research and graduate education. As a
result, the School of Education has continued to
improve the quality of its interdisciplinary prog
ram, consistently giving students a broad
perspective. The faculty represent a variety of
views, since many of the School of Education
professors have joint appointments with other
departments.
The University community should be as
proud of its No. 1 School of Education as it is of
its other top-ranked graduate programs. We
should not ignore the need for training quality
educators of the future.
By further appreciating the School of Educa
tion, the community will give more recognition
to the importance of educating educators.
