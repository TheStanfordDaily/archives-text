# Take my cruise missile, please

It disturbed me to see the picture
of the refitted battleship New Jersey
on the front cover of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle on Saturday. It dis
turbed me because it presented in a
very positive light the appearance of
a vessel carrying nuclear weapons;
and it disturbed me because I found
myself vaguely fascinated and ex
cited by the feelings and memories it
brought back to me.
Many children of this culture, in
cluding myself, grow up on images of
and stories about ships like the New
Jersey; we play with plastic soldiers,
have mock battles in empty lots,
build models of ships and tanks and
are generally thoroughly familiar
with the images and language of war
before we are 10.
We internalize all of it but are
never exposed to the death and suf
fering that are the unpleasant side
effects of wars in the real world. And
though it is difficult to accurately
draw cause and effect relationships
in such matters, I cannot escape the
conclusion that the militarism of our
upbringing is a very harmful influ
ence.

Gl /oe dolls, John Wayne movies, Veteran's Day
parades, TV shows-the list goes on and on. There
are literally hundreds of ways in which we are
conditioned to accept as good the violence
which kas now reached its absurd conclusion in
the current world nuclear arsenal.

It is not an accident that I use the
word "militarism." I have been
involved with the week-long series
on militarism presented by the Stan
ford Progressive Alliance and a
number of other campus organiza
tions. And I am also aware of the
negative connotations that the word
has; there is a deliberate link bet
ween the word militarism and the
word harmful.
Both the dictionary definition of
militarism, however, and the com
mon connotations as well, overlook
an essential fact about the way the
word is used — that it is always used
to describe someone other than our
selves. Like other traits we disdain,
such as greed and vanity, it is always
projected onto things or people out
side ourselves. All nations consider
themselves peace-loving and their
enemies militaristic; and where a
person or group calls his/her/its own
nation militaristic, there is always an
implied separation from that nation,
or at least from the government. I
certainly separate myself from our
current government in that way. But
no individual who grows up in a cul
ture is separate from that culture and
its characteristics, whether negative
or positive.
inoiimii uhl! sexism, like militarism,
are traits we tend to see in others and

overlook in ourselves. And in many
ways this makes sense; after all,
characteristics of that nature are
most recognizable in their most ex
treme forms, and for every "aver
age" sexist there is an extreme one to
distract our attention. Different cul
tures or parts of a culture likewise
lead us to focus on extremes; the
south has come to be known as the
racist part of the nation because in
fact there have always been much
more obvious manifestations of ra
cism there than in other regions. But
the reasonableness of focusing on
the most obvious cases does not
allow us to limit oursleves to those
cases.
There are many reasons for con
sidering the Soviet Union a more
militaristic nation than the United
States. To reach this conclusion one
need only look at the fact that milit
ary parades play a much more prom
inent part in Soviet public cere
monies, and that a far higher propor
tion of their young people are con
scripted into the army. But that does
not allow us then to say that the Un
ited States is not militaristic, and to

overlook the negative effects of what
I consider still a substantially
militaristic culture.
CI Joe dolls, John Wayne movies,
Veteran's Day parades, TV shows —
the list goes on and on. There are
literally hundreds of ways in which
we are conditioned to accept as good
the violence which has now reached
its absurd conclusion in the current
world nuclear arsenal. As I said at the
beginning, I was indeed thrilled
somehow to see the New Jersey in
San Francisco Bay; there was a time
in my life when I could have told you
every major battle it fought in, and I
even had a model of it once. Yet
another part of me knows perfectly
well that it carries as many as 32 nuc
lear-armed cruise missiles, weapons
which I can imagine no possible jus
tification for using.
That, of course, is a lie. It's easy for
me to imagine situations in which the
use of nuclear cruise missiles would
be justified — I know enough about
military strategy that I can see lots of
times when using them might be a
logical choice. But if I accept the
military way of thinking in which
their use is justified, a way of think
ing in which human lives are
abstracted to something resembling
the plastic soldiers of my youth, I ac
cept also the possibility of a nuclear

holocaust.
The problem is this: I have been
brought up in a culture in which it is
far easier to imagine the "justified"
use of nuclear weapons than to im
agine how the world might look
without them. Our history has con
vinced us of the inevitability of milit
ary conflict and has given us incen
tive to glorify military service; the vis
ionaries and dreamers who conceive
of a warless world are dismissed as
just that — dreamers and visionaries.
While disarmament may be desira
ble, it's not "practical."
And this gets back to a point I made
earlier, about the projection of
militarism onto others. The reason
we cannot disarm is because of the
Soviet Union; we do not trust them,
we think them evil, we fear they will
use any advantage to take us over.
We look at their war in Afghanistan,
and forget how much it looks like
Vietnam; we look at Poland, and
forget about the Philippines. We
must begin to realize that the Soviet
Union is a lot more like us than it is
different from us, and we both have
to solve the same problems if we are
to survive the next 20 years.
And the problems are tremend
ous. The current popular debate cen
ters around new nuclear weapons,
and reductions of the existing ones.
Vet people like Biology Prof. Paul
Ehrlich are now beginning to say
what I am sure is true: that the only
long-term solution is complete nuc
lear and conventional disarmament.
As Ehrlich pointed out in his talk dur
ing Earth Week, we built an A-bomb
from scratch in four years without
even knowing if it was possible; now
that the secret is known, and there is
nuclear fuel available from a host
of "peaceful" reactors, there is no
thing to prevent a nation at war from
building a devastating arsenal while
the war is going on.
But come on — complete nuclear
and conventional disarmament? It is
not a possibility that we have been
able to express in a way that is ac
ceptable under the current paradigm
of political reality; I am doubtful that
it can be accepted without an ac
companying change in that
paradigm. The fundamental values of
military strength and national
sovereignty that make up that
paradigm are instilled in us from the
earliest years of our lives, and it is
clear that it will take the utmost effort
to unlearn them on both the per
sonal and collective level. But the
threat of nuclear holocaust may be
enough to motivate us, to make us
look at ourselves and our world and
do the radical things that have to be
done.
Then again, it may not.

number of other campus organiza
tions. And I am also aware of the
negative connotations that the word
has; there is a deliberate link bet
ween the word militarism and the
word harmful.
Both the dictionary definition of
militarism, however, and the com
mon connotations as well, overlook
an essential fact about the way the
word is used — that it is always used
to describe someone other than our
selves. Like other traits we disdain,
such as greed and vanity, it is always
projected onto things or people out
side ourselves. All nations consider
themselves peace-loving and their
enemies militaristic; and where a
person or group calls his/her/its own
nation militaristic, there is always an
implied separation from that nation,
or at least from the government. I
certainly separate myself from our
current government in that way. But
no individual who grows up in a cul
ture is separate from that culture and
its characteristics, whether negative
or positive.
inoiimii uhl! sexism, like militarism,
are traits we tend to see in others and

overlook in ourselves. And in many
ways this makes sense; after all,
characteristics of that nature are
most recognizable in their most ex
treme forms, and for every "aver
age" sexist there is an extreme one to
distract our attention. Different cul
tures or parts of a culture likewise
lead us to focus on extremes; the
south has come to be known as the
racist part of the nation because in
fact there have always been much
more obvious manifestations of ra
cism there than in other regions. But
the reasonableness of focusing on
the most obvious cases does not
allow us to limit oursleves to those
cases.
There are many reasons for con
sidering the Soviet Union a more
militaristic nation than the United
States. To reach this conclusion one
need only look at the fact that milit
ary parades play a much more prom
inent part in Soviet public cere
monies, and that a far higher propor
tion of their young people are con
scripted into the army. But that does
not allow us then to say that the Un
ited States is not militaristic, and to

overlook the negative effects of what
I consider still a substantially
militaristic culture.
CI Joe dolls, John Wayne movies,
Veteran's Day parades, TV shows —
the list goes on and on. There are
literally hundreds of ways in which
we are conditioned to accept as good
the violence which has now reached
its absurd conclusion in the current
world nuclear arsenal. As I said at the
beginning, I was indeed thrilled
somehow to see the New Jersey in
San Francisco Bay; there was a time
in my life when I could have told you
every major battle it fought in, and I
even had a model of it once. Yet
another part of me knows perfectly
well that it carries as many as 32 nuc
lear-armed cruise missiles, weapons
which I can imagine no possible jus
tification for using.
That, of course, is a lie. It's easy for
me to imagine situations in which the
use of nuclear cruise missiles would
be justified — I know enough about
military strategy that I can see lots of
times when using them might be a
logical choice. But if I accept the
military way of thinking in which
their use is justified, a way of think
ing in which human lives are
abstracted to something resembling
the plastic soldiers of my youth, I ac
cept also the possibility of a nuclear

holocaust.
The problem is this: I have been
brought up in a culture in which it is
far easier to imagine the "justified"
use of nuclear weapons than to im
agine how the world might look
without them. Our history has con
vinced us of the inevitability of milit
ary conflict and has given us incen
tive to glorify military service; the vis
ionaries and dreamers who conceive
of a warless world are dismissed as
just that — dreamers and visionaries.
While disarmament may be desira
ble, it's not "practical."
And this gets back to a point I made
earlier, about the projection of
militarism onto others. The reason
we cannot disarm is because of the
Soviet Union; we do not trust them,
we think them evil, we fear they will
use any advantage to take us over.
We look at their war in Afghanistan,
and forget how much it looks like
Vietnam; we look at Poland, and
forget about the Philippines. We
must begin to realize that the Soviet
Union is a lot more like us than it is
different from us, and we both have
to solve the same problems if we are
to survive the next 20 years.
And the problems are tremend
ous. The current popular debate cen
ters around new nuclear weapons,
and reductions of the existing ones.
Vet people like Biology Prof. Paul
Ehrlich are now beginning to say
what I am sure is true: that the only
long-term solution is complete nuc
lear and conventional disarmament.
As Ehrlich pointed out in his talk dur
ing Earth Week, we built an A-bomb
from scratch in four years without
even knowing if it was possible; now
that the secret is known, and there is
nuclear fuel available from a host
of "peaceful" reactors, there is no
thing to prevent a nation at war from
building a devastating arsenal while
the war is going on.
But come on — complete nuclear
and conventional disarmament? It is
not a possibility that we have been
able to express in a way that is ac
ceptable under the current paradigm
of political reality; I am doubtful that
it can be accepted without an ac
companying change in that
paradigm. The fundamental values of
military strength and national
sovereignty that make up that
paradigm are instilled in us from the
earliest years of our lives, and it is
clear that it will take the utmost effort
to unlearn them on both the per
sonal and collective level. But the
threat of nuclear holocaust may be
enough to motivate us, to make us
look at ourselves and our world and
do the radical things that have to be
done.
Then again, it may not.

It disturbed me to see the picture
of the refitted battleship New Jersey
on the front cover of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle on Saturday. It dis
turbed me because it presented in a
very positive light the appearance of
a vessel carrying nuclear weapons;
and it disturbed me because I found
myself vaguely fascinated and ex
cited by the feelings and memories it
brought back to me.
Many children of this culture, in
cluding myself, grow up on images of
and stories about ships like the New
Jersey; we play with plastic soldiers,
have mock battles in empty lots,
build models of ships and tanks and
are generally thoroughly familiar
with the images and language of war
before we are 10.
We internalize all of it but are
never exposed to the death and suf
fering that are the unpleasant side
effects of wars in the real world. And
though it is difficult to accurately
draw cause and effect relationships
in such matters, I cannot escape the
conclusion that the militarism of our
upbringing is a very harmful influ
