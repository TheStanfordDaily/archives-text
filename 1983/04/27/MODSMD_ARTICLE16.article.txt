## Med Center supports a better animal rights bill 
### 
The story, "Medical Center op
poses animal bill" (Daily, April 18),
describes the reasons for our oppos
ing SB 883, the so-called animal rights
bill sponsored by State Senator
David Roberti (D-Los Angeles). Your
story correctly stated the Center's
position that this bill would increase
the numbers of animals killed in
pounds, and make research vital for
human needs more difficult.
But your story omitted the most
important part of our statement —
namely that Stanford University and
the University of California support
The Pet Protection Identification Act
proposed by Assemblyman William
Filante (R-Marin).
— require stringent standards of
humane care for research institu
tions seeking to use pound animals.

— establish a statewide identifica
tion system to help pet owners locate
stray animals in pounds.
— give a person turning in an ani
mal the option of refusing to allow
the pound to release the animal for
research.
Moreover, the Filante proposal re
quires research facilities to hold
transferred animals for a reasonable
period to provide an opportunity for
recovery of unidentified animals that
might be pets. This holding period
would be in addition to pound or
shelter holding period required be
fore euthanasia of animals.
A recent county study showed that
75 percent of the 40,000 animals
brought to the Humane Society of
Santa Clara last year were put to
death. Nationally, 95 percent of all

impounded animals are disposed of
without benefit whatsoever to life.
Yet the number of impounded ani
mals used in research is very small —
less than 5 percent.
The research community is not un
sympathetic to the issue of protect
ing pets. But we feel the Filante
proposal is more rational in terms of
animal conservation and the needs
of research than the one suggested
by Roberti's bill.

Marguerite waste
Aside from the recent proliferation
of expensive sculptural

monstrosities, the most visible waste
at Stanford is the Marguerite bus ser
vice. I understand that the service is
used heavily from Escondido Village
to the Med Center for a brief period
in the morning and for the return trip
in the late afternoon. But why must
the entire Stanford community pay
for noisy, polluting, full-size buses to
be driven around the campus all day
when there are rarely more than
three or four people in them at a
time? This just doesn't make sense.
At a time when money for research
and faculty salaries is tight, and tui
tion is approaching $9000 per year, I
feel obliged to point out this instance
of flagrant waste.
