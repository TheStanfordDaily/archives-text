# Hoover: what the story didn't say
## 
### 
There are so many misleading statements, innuen
does, quotes by unidentified persons, character assas
sinations and attempts at intimidation in the recent
four-part Hoover story (Daily, April 19-22) that I hardly
know where to begin. I will only deal with a few for the
record.
The first point that needs making is that the Hoover
Institution is not partisan and does not take positions on
public policy issues. There are about 70 scholars on the
staff of the Institution and each is free to express his or
her own conclusions based on their research and to
present theirviews on issues.
Hoover fellows have commented previously in letters
to the Daily on the charge that the Institution is partisan.
For example, senior research fellow William Schneider
wrote (Daily, Oct. 27, 1981): "I have not found the
Hoover institution to be monolithically conservative or
Republican, and I have never been made to feel out of
place here. There are, in fact, quite a few of us Democ
rats here at Hoover." Also, Alexander Dallin, then a
senior research fellow for more than four years, wrote,
(Daily, Oct. 10, 1975): . .in my experience there has
never been any attempt to influence or control the re
search or the findings of any scholar associated with the
Institution."
Various actions of the Stanford board of trustees,
principally a May 21, 1959 resolution, define the rela
tionship between the Institution and the University. This
document, which includes a several page statement on
the status, purposes, management, and policies of the
Institution, contains the often-quoted paragraph by
former President Herbert Hoover on the "evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx." This resolution was adopted by
the board of trustees "with the recommendation of the
president of the University, the endorsement of the
president of the board and the trustee chairman of the
committee on the Hoover Institution and the approval of
Mr. Hoover."
In a later section, the resolution notes that "the mem
bers of the staff must be free to publish statements or
books of the results of their research work in which they
give their 'interpretation' or opinion. If the writer of this
type of publication wishes to state that he is a member of
the Hoover Institution, the publication must carry a de
claration that the Institution does not assume responsi
bility for statements in the publication."
Immediately following Hoover's much-quoted com
ment, the resolution states that "the overall mission of
this Institution is, from its records, to recall the voice of
experience against the making of war, and by the study
of these records and their publication to recall man's
endeavors to make and preserve peace and to sustain for
America the safeguards of the American way of life."
The 1959 agreement was reaffirmed by the trustees in
May 1962 as a condition of Hoover's donating his arc
hives to the Hoover Institution and again in the late 1970s
when the Volker fund was donated to the Hoover In
stitution.
The terms of a bequest by William Robertson Coe to

Stanford contain the following language: ". . .to estab
lish and maintain a Program of American Studies de
signed as a positive and affirmative method of meeting
the threat of communism, Socialism, Collectivism, To
talitarianism and other Ideologies opposed to the pre
servation of our System of Free Enterprise." Three en
dowed Coe professorships exist at Stanford (in
economics, history and English). It is interesting to note
that, to my knowledge, there has never been any similar
objection expressed to the statement of purpose re
quired by the Coe bequest.
Regarding the selection of the current director, Dr.
Glenn Campbell was invited to become director in
November 1959 by University President Wallace Sterl
ing. In a letter to Campbell, Sterling said, ". . .the Stan
ford trustees have authorized me to finalize ar
rangements concerningyour appointment as director of
the Hoover Institution, and I have discussed these ar
rangements with Mr. Hoover, who approved of them.
With this letter, then, I formalize the offer to you of said
Directorship. . . ."

'/n my experience there has never
been any attempt to influence or
control the research or the findings
of any scholar associated with the
Institution/
-Prof. Alexander Dallin

The Daily articles contain so many misstatements and
half-truths about the appointment process for scholars
at the Hoover Instituion that instead of trying to com
ment on them, I will outline the various procedures
briefly.
For senior fellows who receive continuing appoint
ments but not academic tenure, the president creates an
ad hoc committee to'review the nomination by the direc
tor (which is made after a nationwide search) before
submitting it to the trustees.
In the case of senior research fellows who receive
term appointments of five years or less, the director
gives the president advance notice of his intention to
recommend a particular person and provides
background information.
In the case of certain senior library personnel, such as
the associate director for Library Operations, curators
and the archivist, search committees composed of In
stitution staff as well as representatives of University
faculty and administration are used. The latter represen
tatives are selected by the director in consultation with
and with the concurrence of the president.
Juniors members of the scholarly staff as well as other
staff members are selected in accordance with proce
dures similar to those used by the rest of the University.
