# Tenure panel attacks sexism
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Women hoping for tenured positions at Stanford
should hide their academic strengths and their interests
in feminist studies, according to panelists discussing
"Women and Tenure" last night in Soto lounge.
Anne Mellor, a tenured English professor here, and
Annis Pratt, professor of English at the University of
Wisconsin, said the only way they received their tenured
positions was by "playing the game" with their male
colleagues and waiting until they had tenure to express
their feminist views.
"It's terrible, but from what I hear about the University
here, there's no other solution," Pratt said.
The "situation" referred to by Pratt is the dearth pi
women in tenured positions here and at most other
universities. According to Santiago Rodriguez, a staff
member of the Affirmative Action Office here, Stanford
has 1043 men in tenure track positions and only 108
women. There are 815 men who are full professors here,
and 19 women; male associate professors number 165
and female 35, male assistant professors 225, women 50.
"Stanford ranks third best in Ivy-League quality
schools" in the number of women in tenured positions,
said Rodriguez. "Columbia is first and Columbia has a
long way to go."

Pratt said the female tenure situation at Stanford is
similar to that nationwide. "Women are being hired as
assistant professors," Pratt said, "but an assistant pro
fessorship is a revolving door; women are brought in
and fired." Pratt described two phenomena constrain
ing women in academia: women are fired when they
begin to show their strengths as writers or professors,
and women who do stay at universities long enough to
be considered for tenure are told that their work has no
serious merit.
"As soon as a woman begins to show academic prom
ise, out she goes," Pratt said, and cited the cases of
women who had been fired after writing exceptional
texts or articles, or simply showing themselves ex
tremely competent. "There's something called the
'svelte young woman' syndrome," she said, referring to
the trend of hiring women who "look like they could be
blown over with a feather."
The reasons for denying women tenure, Pratt said,
usually center around the merit of their work. "The
faculty rallies forces to prove that women are in
adequate," she said. This is done through criticism of
the work itself or through soiling the woman's academic
reputation.

FEMINISM AND TENURE DON'T MIX: Stanford English professors
Ronald Rcbholz and Anne Mellor and University of Wisconsin English
Prof. Annis Pratt speak at a panel discussion on tenure held in Soto
lounge yesterday.
"It's extraordinary, the amount of
outright lying that goes on," Pratt
said, "to find your colleagues de
stroying contracts, taking letters
from your file; it's shocking."
To combat what they believe to be
discrimination on the basis of sex,
professors have two options: to set
tle with the university or to take the
matter to court. According to Mellor,
Stanford's system for filing tenure

grievances is "not entirely legiti
mate."
"No one who has complained so
far has won," Mellor said. "It seems
that the only ones who are winning is
the administration."
Pratt said, "People ask why we
have to be so adversarial as to take
our universities to court. But we
don't have any other option. We
don't believe our male colleagues
are going to do anything to us — and
then they do it. The strange thing is,
we are winning our court cases."
