# On-campus jobs favor work study students
## 
### SHAULA KUMAISHI 
From the rich notes of a cello
to the beeps and bustle of
LOTS: these are the sounds of
students here working.
More than half ot the stu
dents here work part-time dur
ing the school year, in addition
to studying. Many obtain their
lobs through financial aid,
either as a part of their
University-funded financial aid
packets or as one of approxi
mately 300 federally-tunded
work-study students. Accord
ing to the Financial Aids Office,
most departments prefer to
employ work-study students,
since the federal government
pays 80 percent of their
salaries. Students who receive
a job as part of University' fi
nancial aid are paid completely
from the funds of the depart
ment they work in.
Students not funded by
either type of financial aid are
not usually eligible for Univer
sity jobs, except for hashing. In
the past, when an excess of
|obs existed for needy stu
dents, other students yvere
given the opportunity to obtain
these jobs. As is stated in the
student directory, "Students

who have not been assigned
work in their packages may be
eligible for these positions dur
ing winter and spring quar
ters.'' But now , due to a lack ot
excess jobs, this is no longer
true.
When asked if it is still possi
ble for students not on finan
cial aid to obtain University
|obs, Assoc. Director of Finan
cial Aids Vince De Anda said,
"It's possible, in certain rare
cases. . .but most jobs that are
anything are reserved for the
needy."
The policy of the University
that students on financial aid
should work for part of their
tuition costs has been in effect
for at least 19 years, said Asst.
Director of Financial Aids Mary
Roberts. "The policy of the
University is that the student
should absorb 25 percent ot
the cost of education — by
long-term loan or term-time
employment."
It is also University policy to
pay more than minimum wage
because the student salaries
are increased each year by the
same scale as the wages of
other campus employees, to
reflect cost of living increases.

Students not on financial aid
are eligible for jobs at Tresid
der Union, the Coffee House
and the Faculty Club, as well as
oft-campus jobs with com
panies and individuals. The list
ings for off-campus job open
ings are available at the Stan
ford Employ ment Office, a part
of the Career Planning and
Placement Center. Individual
initiative is also helpful in ob
taining a job.
Students employed on cam
pus are usually employed in
some tvpe of tood service, cler
ical or library positions or as a
lab or research assistant. How
ever, many students, such as
Stacia Snapp, the student
coordinator at the LOTS, work
at more unusual jobs. Snapp, a
senior majoring in electrical
engineering and computers,
first began working at LOTS as
an assistant to the administra
tive assistant after she took
Computer Science 106. She
was hired a year and a half later
for the student coordinator
position, traditionally held by
two people, which she now
does alone. Her work involves
supervising and coordinating
the consultants at LOTS, writ
ing and updating the LOTS sys
tem's programs and handling
routine questions, concerns
and problems. She spends 20

to 30 hours a week working,
and even more during finals
week, when, as she says,"It
gets really crazy around here."
Snapp said her job is " kind of
a dual role," in that she has to
deal extensively with both
people and the computer sys
tem. "The most valuable part is
the managerial experience —
learning to deal with people,
organize events, teaching
people. It's really good experi
ence," she said.
Another student in an un
usual job is Ri-Pen Chou, a cel
list in a quartet, Opus 1, with
three other students: Dan
Stryer, Ri-Shea Chou and Ken
McClain. They play for wed
dings, parties and other social
functions to make money and
have a good time. Chou said,
"The music'jobs are a lot of fun
— we play and usually get to
partake of the refreshments."
The job has no regular hours,
but, as Chou said, "We're
doing pretty good business
here." He is also a grader for
the Mathematics Department,
marking homework for Cal
culus 42 and 43. He described
the work as "pretty repetitive
— the hours are great,
though."
Getting a job as a mathema
tics grader is quite easy, at leas

during autumn quarter, said
Marjorie Cagan, the academic
secretary for the Mathematics
Department. The required
qualifications are simply to
have passed the course that
one becomes grader for with a
B grade or better, and to be
responsible and willing to
work. The hours are flexible,
depending on the grader's
classload, varying from 25
hours per quarter to 200 hours

Not all jobs are rewarding for
the experience. Many people,
when asked their reasons for
working, simply said, "For the
money." Most of those who
listed money as a reason for
working said they do not re
sent having to work while
other more affluent students
do not have to. Dave Holmes, a
"hasher" for Lagunita Food
Service, said, "People who
have lots (of money) have to
pay a lot, too." Holmes said he
also has a deal with the Athletic
Department where he works
for two quarters as a "hasher,"
and wrestles for the Stanford
team the other quarter, for
comparable pay.
Roberts said the preferred
jobs on campus are usually the
research or library jobs, with
pre-meds in particular want
ing to work in lab or research.
Some departments, such as the
library system, have little fund
ing for jobs, and thus almost
exclusively hire federally
funded work-study students.
Lab and research assistant jobs
are generally more available.
Freshman Dave Elott ob
tained a job as a research assis
tant in the Behavioral Medicine
division of the Department of
Psychology at the Medical
Center, scoring and scaling the
results of various tests con

ducted to research pain. He
got the job on the basis of his
experience autumn quarter,
working as a research assistant
in the infant studies division.
The availability of the job, as
well as the job security, de
pends on the budget of the
project. There are no guaran
tees, so when the infant
studies budget was cut, there
was no money to pay Elott, who
was let go as a result. But there
are benefits. For instance, on
the-job training in statistical
analysis was provided to Elott,
and the hours are relatively
flexible.
There are many and various
jobs available for students, but
the demand still exceeds the
supply of jobs. Students often
rely on these jobs to be able to
attend Stanford. As Tujuana
Greene, who works in Terman
Engineering Library said,
"There's no way in Cod's world
that I'd be able to come here
without financial aid. It does
seem fair that I'd have to work
for it." Roberts said the jobs
program for financial aids is
quite successtul, but he added,
"We're going to need more
jobs next year. . . I would en
courage all departments to
employ students if they need
part-time help."
