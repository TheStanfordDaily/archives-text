## Five Card players go in nine rounds 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Five Stanford players, including the Cardinal's
second No. 1 pick in the last 11 years, were
chosen yesterday in the 1983 National Football
League draft.
The annual draft of college football players,
usually conducted over two days, was held in
just one yesterday in an effort to prevent the
United States Football League from signing un
drafted players after the first day.
Below is a run-down of which Stanford players
were selected:

The Baltimore Colts, who held the No. 1 pick
by virtue of their 0-8-1 record last season,
thought they drafted Cardinal quarterback John
Elway yesterday.
But if the Colts don't trade Elway soon, they
may have drafted air.
Elway said yesterday at a San Jose press con
ference that he will sign with baseball's New
York Yankees if Baltimore doesn't deal him to a
"West Coast team or a (NFL) contender."
Heralded as the best quarterback prospect
since Joe Namath, Elway also plays baseball —
good enough for the Yankees to hire him last
summer to play for their Class A minor league
club in Oneonta, N.Y., for $140,000.
At Oneonta, Elway got off to a slow start, but
finished his 42-game stint hitting .318 with 25
runs batted in. As a Cardinal, he batted .361 with
50 RBl's in just 49 games in 1981.

But it is Elway's play on the football field that
enabled him to rack up awards and honors like
they were going out of style.
He completed 262 of 405 passes for 3262 yards
last season, upping hiscareer total to 9349 — sec
ond in NCAA history to Brigham Young's Jim
McMahon. His 774 completions, 1246 attempts
and 3.13 percentage of passes intercepted are all
NCAA career records.
One prize besides the Heisman Trophy that
evaded Elway while he attended Stanford was a
appearance in a post-season bowl game. In the
four years that he wore Cardinal red, Stanford
football teams never had a winning season and
had a combined 19-24-1 record.

Unlike the man who threw to him throughout
his career at Stanford, tight end Chris Dressel
was elated with his draft outcome.
"I was very pleased," he said. "I can't say that I
was very surprised. I knew that Houston needed
a tight end." Dressel was the fourth tight end
selected from a bumper crop of tight ends in the
Class of '83.
"They (Houston) expressed the fact that
(Dave) Casper will be around for two or three
more years and they said they needed a back
up," he continued."
At six-foot-four, 225 pounds, Dressel caught
44 passes last season for 580 yards, an average of
13.1 yards per reception. In his career, he
snagged 85 passes — most of them from John
Elway — for 1041 yards.
