# Netters ace out No. 2 Pepperdine
## 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
Rebounding from its poor
showing at the Pacific-10 In
dividual Championships
last weekend, the Stanford
men's tennis team pulled
off its biggest dual match
victory of the season yes
terday, upsetting No.
2-ranked Pepperdine 7-2.
With the win, Cardinal
coach Dick Gould's
freshman-filled lineup con
tinued to knock off the top
rated teams in the nation.
Stanford has upset three
of the nation's top-five
ranked teams in as many
weeks, including fourth
ranked USC and fifth
ranked UCLA.
The victory will surely im
prove the Cardinal netters'
current No. 5 ranking and
possibly move them as high
as No. 2 in the nation. It also
runs the team's win streak
to 16 and its overall record
to 20-1.
"It was a very good win
for us, especially since we
lost to this team earlier in
the season," Gould said.
In yesterday's match it
was Stanford's ability to
prevail in the close contests
that provided the comforta
ble margin of victory. The
Card won all three-set sing
les matches and both
three-set doubles contests.
"I was pleased to see us
hang in there," Gould said.
"In a couple of matches we
had leads, let them slip away
and then came back to
win."
John Letts, at No. 2 sing
les, provided the best
example of that tenacity. In
a match which captured the
undivided attention of the
500 fans at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium, Letts won
the first set, lost the second
in a tiebreaker and then
bolted out in front in the
third 4-2.
But on the strength of re
lentless ground strokes and
almost error-free play, the
Wave's Glenn Michibata re
gained the momentum as
well as the lead, 5-4.

The tide turned again as
Letts won the next two
games and served for the
match with a 3-1 lead—triple
match point. However,
Michibata reeled off three
straight points to take the
game and tie it as six apiece.
In the tiebreaker Letts
again had Michibata backed
into a corner with a 6-3 score
and three more match
points, but the Pepperdine
senior battled back to tie it
and even gain several match
points which Letts fought
off.
Finally, Letts managed to
close out the match by win
ning the tiebreaker 11-9
when Michibata uncharac
teristicly hit a forehand into
the net.

In another thriller, No. 6
Jim Grabb pulled out a
three-set win in a tiebreaker
after gaining and losing the
lead several times.
Meanwhile, at No. 1 sing
les, Scott Davis, still not
fully recovered from his
bout with mononucleosis,
knocked off Pepperdine's
John VanNostrand 6-1, 7-6.
In a preseason poll VanNos
trand was rated No. 3 na
tionally
Davis' victory rep
resented a major tur
naround from his upset loss
last week at the Pac-10s to
Arizona State's No. 5 singles
player.
Later the doubles team of
Davis and Letts, which won
the Pac-10 doubles title last
weekend, defeated the

Pepperdine team of Van-
Nostrand and Bill Baxter to
clinch the victory for Stan
ford.
