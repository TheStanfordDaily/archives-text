## SPOTLIGHT High hurdler Jones reflects on track team 
### BETH KLEID 
Senior Kevin Jones, sprinter and
high hurdler for the men's track
teamhere, is onlyl/100th of a second
away from his goal for his last season
of competitive track.
Jones' current personal record for
the 100 meter high hurdles is 13.93.
To qualify for the NCAA champion
ships he must cut his time down to
13.92.
Jones expressed optimistism
about reaching his goal. "My current
personal best is not the best I can
do," he said. "I think I can do 13.7 or
8 once I get minor things to work for
me."
Jones, who hails from Philadel
phia, Pennsylvania, did not start out
as a high hurdler. In ninth grade he
began his track career as a sprinter.
"It's interesting that in my early
childhood I was not really interested
in sports. I fell into track when I
started to mature. I was a versatile
athlete in high school, but I was not
very outstanding. I've gotten a lot
better since I came to Stanford,"
Jones said.
Jones enjoys sprinting, but he al
ways wanted to do the high hurdles.
He did the hurdles during his senior
year in high school, but had trouble
adjusting to college hurdles (which
are 3 inches higher) during his
freshman year.
"I was frustrated, and gave up the
hurdles for two years. When I came
back to them last year I re-learned
doing the hurdles and I'm pleased
with my progress."
Because of this progress in the
high hurdles, Jones considers this
season to be his best yet at Stanford.
Another thing that makes this sea
son a good one for Jones is that he is
the track team's captain.
Jones considers himself to be the

quiet type, who is not a natural
leader. Despite this description,he
said, "I really enjoy being the team
captain. I have such a good bunch of
men and women to work with that
being a leader is no problem for
me."
Previous seasons have also been
good for Jones. He won the Stanford
Outstanding Freshman award after

the 1980 season, but said, "I don't
think I was that outstanding —
freshman year I had some trouble
adjusting to big time track and field
and college life in general.
Last year jones won the Paten Jor
dan Award for outstanding mental
attitude and athletic ability. He said
that this award was quite a "sur

prise.
Jones is happy with his track
career. "I really have come a long
way in the high hurdles." He is also
happy with his team's progress.
"We are a team that is still building
— we are working our way up in the
Pac-10." Jones said that he would
like to see the team improve its score
in the Pac-10 championships this

season, and do better than lastyear's
10th out of 10 schools.
"Our team unity will help us to
make Stanford track a better prog
ram," he commented.
Jones is satisfied with the entire
track program here. "Brooks
Johnson is a very capable coach. He

doesn't let you get away with much,
which is good. I have enjoyed run
ning at Stanford."
As he approaches graduation,
Jones has had a chance to reflect on
his track career. He has also de
veloped certain philosophies.
On motivation, Jones said that he
believes everyone has an occas
sional bad day. Sometimes this bad
day can come on the day of a meet.
"You just have to establish a
paradigm that helps you get through
the bad days, and then you can put it
to use on a meet day,"he said.
On balancing athletics with
schoolwork, Jones said that it all
comes down to one word — discip
line. "To be successful here you
have to put out a high level of discip
line. If you know when you have to
discipline yourself, you can allow
timeforfun. My whoie experience at
Stanford has built a lot of discip
line."
Will Jones miss running track after
he graduates? Yes and no. He said
that it will be hard to get used to not
being on the team, but "You have to
start somewhere."
If Jones qualifies for the TAC in
June itwill probably be his last meet.
He sees the 1984 Olympic team as a
possibility j n s future.
I am looking forward to free after
noons next year," said Jones. These
afternoons will be spent at UC-
Berkeley, where the urban studies
major will attend the school of ar
chitecture.
Jones said that he would like to
see people come out and cheer on
the track team at their last home
meet against Berkeley this weekend.
Ironically, Jones will be in the ri
val's territory next year. "I hope to fit
in there, but not ever really become
one of them. I will always be a Stan
ford Cardinal."
