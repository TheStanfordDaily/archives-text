# Mosher appeals expulsion by Anthropology Dept.
## 
### FELICIA LEE 
In the latest move in an unusual and con
troversial case, former anthropology graduate
student Steven Mosher has filed an internal
appeal protesting his expulsion from the Uni
versity. The appeal was filed Monday with
Dean Norman Wessells of the School of
Humanities and Sciences.
Mosher, who is currently living in his pa
rents' home in Fresno, was unavailable for
comment.
Faculty members were not surprised by
Mosher's appeal, but some did not expect him
to appeal when he did.
According to Anthropology Department
Chairman Clifford Barnett, Mosher had previ
ously expressed the desire to appeal but had

turned down many opportunities to do so. An
thropology Prof. Joseph Greenberg said he
was surprised that Mosher chose to file the
appeal publicly.
Mosher was expelled Feb. 24 on charges that
he was guilty of "illegal and seriously unethical
conduct" during his research in the People's
Republic of China in 1979-1980. The charges
were based on "persuasive evidence that can
not be revealed without endangering innocent
persons," according to the Anthropology De
partment faculty.
According to Greenberg, the "innocent per
sons" involved are Chinese citizens.
Mosher attracted controversy and the anger
of the Chinese government by publishing
photographs of pregnant Chinese women

waiting for abortions, and by publishing an
article critical of Chinese birth control prac
tices in a Taiwan magazine. In addition,
Chinese authorities had accused Mosher of
violating Chinese statutes by traveling without
authorization, bringing a female traveler into
China without authorization and smuggling
gold coins out of the country.
Wessells said he had received no previous
indication that Mosher had planned toappeal.
He added that he had not yet read Mosher's
appeal and could not comment on it. He said
that a grievance officer — or a committee of
grievance officers — would have to be ap
pointed to investigate Mosher's appeal and
make suggestions for further action.
Wessells added that the grievance officer or

officers would not come from the Anthropol
ogy Department. He said that he had not yet
chosen anyone to fill the position and because
of the complexity of the case and the work
involved, the selection process may take time.
He added that he could not say how long it
would take to process Mosher's appeal. "It
could take a week, a month, or six months," he
said.
Greenberg said that the expulsion of
graduate students in any department is "very
uncommon" and Mosher's case in particular is
"unprecedented."
According to Barnett, Mosher is the first stu
dent in the depatment's history to be expelled
for unethical research practices.
