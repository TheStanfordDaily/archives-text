Feinstein keeps office in recall election
San Francisco — Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a Stanford grad
uate, easily survived a recall election yesterday that was
spawned by her support for a handgun ban that was never
enforced.
Feinstein took 45,343 of the 51,033 absentee ballots
counted before the polls closed at 8 p.m. Officials estimated
that 150,000 of 354,000 registered voters would cast ballots.
There was little surprise in the outcome. Even leaders of
the hodgepodge of groups supporting the recall conceded
they had little chance to drive the mayor from office.
Feinstein, 49, fresh from last week's decision to hold the
1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, now
appears headed for an easy victory in her bid for re-election
in November.

Propelled into office in 1978 when Mayor George
Moscone was shot to death with a handgun, Feinstein was
forced into the recall by the White Panther Party, a tiny fringe
group angered by her support of a handgun ban.
Its 20 members circulated recall petitions — even after an
appeal court agreed the ban was unconstitutional — and
tapped a host of anti-Feinstein factions.
Tenants' groups were angry with the mayor's rent-control
policies; homosexual groups, with her veto of a domestic
partnership bill that would have given city benefits to un
married couples. Preservationists complained she wasn't vig
ilant enough about protecting historic buildings. Others
were disgruntled with high-rise development, with her at
tention to downtown San Francisco.
Beside touting her record in 4Vj years in office, Feinstein
struck a sympathetic chord with many voters by questioning

the propriety of using the recall process to challenge a mayor
who does not stand accused of corruption or incompetence.
She also got a boost from last week's decision to stage the
1984 Democratic convention in San Francisco.
But at the heart of her campaign strategy was the "ironing
board brigade," more than 2000 volunteers who took to
street corners and shopping centers to urge people to vote
by absentee ballot. They used ironing boards instead of card
tables because more people could cluster around and stand
while filling out applications for absentee ballots.
"Out of 70,000 (ballots) sent out, more than 40,000 were
generated by the mayor's campaign," Patterson said.
It was the first attempt to recall a San Francisco mayor since
1946, when Mayor Roger Lapham survived a recall attempt
sparked by a hike in the street car fares from 7 cents to a
