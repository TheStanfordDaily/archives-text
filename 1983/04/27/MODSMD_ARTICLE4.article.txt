Feinstein keeps office in recall election
San Francisco — Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a Stanford grad
uate, easily survived a recall election yesterday that was
spawned by her support for a handgun ban that was never
enforced.
Feinstein took 45,343 of the 51,033 absentee ballots
counted before the polls closed at 8 p.m. Officials estimated
that 150,000 of 354,000 registered voters would cast ballots.
There was little surprise in the outcome. Even leaders of
the hodgepodge of groups supporting the recall conceded
they had little chance to drive the mayor from office.
Feinstein, 49, fresh from last week's decision to hold the
1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, now
appears headed for an easy victory in her bid for re-election
in November.

Propelled into office in 1978 when Mayor George
Moscone was shot to death with a handgun, Feinstein was
forced into the recall by the White Panther Party, a tiny fringe
group angered by her support of a handgun ban.
Its 20 members circulated recall petitions — even after an
appeal court agreed the ban was unconstitutional — and
tapped a host of anti-Feinstein factions.
Tenants' groups were angry with the mayor's rent-control
policies; homosexual groups, with her veto of a domestic
partnership bill that would have given city benefits to un
married couples. Preservationists complained she wasn't vig
ilant enough about protecting historic buildings. Others
were disgruntled with high-rise development, with her at
tention to downtown San Francisco.
Beside touting her record in 4Vj years in office, Feinstein
struck a sympathetic chord with many voters by questioning

the propriety of using the recall process to challenge a mayor
who does not stand accused of corruption or incompetence.
She also got a boost from last week's decision to stage the
1984 Democratic convention in San Francisco.
But at the heart of her campaign strategy was the "ironing
board brigade," more than 2000 volunteers who took to
street corners and shopping centers to urge people to vote
by absentee ballot. They used ironing boards instead of card
tables because more people could cluster around and stand
while filling out applications for absentee ballots.
"Out of 70,000 (ballots) sent out, more than 40,000 were
generated by the mayor's campaign," Patterson said.
It was the first attempt to recall a San Francisco mayor since
1946, when Mayor Roger Lapham survived a recall attempt
sparked by a hike in the street car fares from 7 cents to a
dime.
The recall was forced when the White Panthers turned in
petitions bearing 34,800 signatures, of which 23,780 were val
id. Just 19,357 valid signatures —10 percent of the number of
votes cast in the last mayoral election — were needed to
qualify the recall.
El Salvador to meet aid conditions
San Salvador — The government here will meet the price
Rep. Clarence Long (D-Md.) put on his crucial House com
mittee's approval of $60 million in U.S. military aid by releas
ing political prisoners and allowing unannounced inspec
tions-of penitentiaries and police cells, Long said Monday at
a news conference.
But Long expressed little optimism over his apparent suc
cess at winning these concessions.
In a statement he read to reporters, Long said that
Salvadoran President Alvaro Magana assured him after two
meetings in the last two days that "the prisons and detention
centers will be open to unannounced, unrestricted visits by
the International Red Cross and that following early passage
of the Amnesty Law (thus far stalled in the constituent as
sembly) substantial numbers of political prisoners, hopefully
in the hundreds, will be released."
Long accepts the scenario often presented by U.S. Am
bassador Deane Hinton that an aid cutoff would lead, in
Long's words to "a right-wing military coup, possibly fol
lowed by a bloodbath."
In Washington, President Reagan's request for $60 million
in military aid to El Salvador was cut in half by a House panel
yesterday as he readied a special plea to Congress and the
nation to rally behind his Central America policy.
The 7-5 decision by the Appropriations subcommittee on
112o r eign operations to slash the Salvador aid to $30 million fol
lowed a tie vote, 6-6, that would have barred any decision at
all for 90 days. The compromise was engineered by Chair
man Clarence Long (D-Md.) who just returned from El
Salvador.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee already had set
tled on an identical cut.
Meanwhile, the full Senate talked behind closed doors
about whether the administration is waging a covert cam
paign against Nicaragua. And Reagan promised to name a
special envoy for Central America, whose duties will include
assisting "the Salvadorans in their efforts to find a basis for
dialogue with their opponents."
Speculation centered on former Democratic Sen. Richard
Stone of Florida as the choice for that post.
Kirkpatrick defends El Salvador policy
United Nations —U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick took
on critics of the Reagan administration's Central American
policy yesterday, giving sharp treatment to people ranging
from Soviet leader Yuri Andropov to Rep. Clarence Long,
(D-Md.)
Speaking at a luncheon meeting of the United Nations
Correspondents Association, the U.S. envoy rejected what a
reporter called her role as "secretary of state for Latin Ameri
ca." But, she appeared to reinforce such status as she dealt
authoritatively with Latin questions, which dominated the
session.
Of Andropov's justification of Soviet intervention in Af
ghanistan because of alleged U.S. actions in Nicaragua, she
said, "There could be no analogy of the Soviet position in Af
ghanistan to that of the United States in Nicaragua until or
unless the United States had 100,000 occupation troops in
Nicaragua."
When Long returned to the United States from Central

America this week, he referred to the army of El Salvador as a
"wet noodle." Kirkpatrick's response:
"It's very easy from comfortable luncheon tables in New
York or congressional offices in Washington to level harsh
criticisms of men and women who are risking their lives on
battlefields confronting guerrillas using real bullets. The first
appropriate U.S. response is a little more respect .... El
Salvador has never confronted such a challenge and neither
have we. I think another appropriate response is for the
United States to provide more adequate training."
Kirkpatrick showed even less regard for West German au
thor Gunter Grass and Norwegian actress Liv Ullman.
Grass has suggested that both Poland and Nicaragua are
suffering from the actions of "big brothers."
Kirkpatrick said, "The people of Poland and Nicaragua
have the same big brother on their necks. They are in both
cases the Soviet Union and in both cases imposing a tyranny
which deprives the people of freedom and the guarantees
associated with democracy."
Shultz meets with Mubarak
Cairo, Egypt —Secretary of State George Shultz received
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's full support yesterday
for what is expected to be a grueling effort to get an agree
ment for the withdrawal of Israeli and other foreign troops
from Lebanon.
The effort begins in earnest today when Shultz goes to Is
rael for a meeting with Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
who has set conditions for a troop withdrawal that Lebanon
is unwilling to meet.
After a 3Vi-hour meeting with Mubarak, Shultz gave re
porters the clear impression that he and Mubarak agreed
that Israel's terms were excessive. Israel has been insisting on
leaving behind a small contingent of security forces to pro
tect its northern border and on a key security role for the Is
raeli-backed militia leader Maj. Saad Haddad.
With Mubarak at his side, the secretary sa'dthey discussed
the urgent need for a withdrawal agreement that "honors
the necessity of a sovereign Lebanon able to rule itself."
"The views of the president of Egypt and the views of the
president of the United States are identical on this issue," he
said.
Asked if he thought it might be possible to arrange forthe
withdrawal of Israeli troops during the trip, Shultz replied,
"It's certainly possible but we will see."
Mubarak, who said Shultz gave him a letter from President
Reagan concerning Middle East problems, said he hoped the
secretary's trip to the region would conclude with "some
thing beneficial to the whole region."
He said there must be a complete withdrawal of all foreign
forces from Lebanon.
Mubarak also said Egypt considers Reagan's faltering
Middle East peace initiative a "golden opportunity" for
peace. He urged the Palestinians to meet itsterms by "declar
ing a linkage with Jordan" that will make possible peace ne
gotiations with Israel.
Committee cites former EPA head
Washington —The House Energy and Commerce Com
mittee voted unanimously yesterday to cite former Environ
mental Protection Agency official Rita Lavelle for contempt
of Congress for defying subpoenas to testify before the panel
about alleged EPA mismanagement.
The vote sends the contempt citation to the House floor. A
vote there to cite Lavelle could result in criminal action
against her in U.S. District Court. Contempt is a misde
meanor punishable by a $1000 fine and up to a year in jail.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) the committee's chairman,
said he would be willing to drop the action if Lavelle appears
and cooperates with congressional investigators. But he

urged her to "move promptly," saying the House would vote
on the resolution "in the very near future."
Lavelle's attorney, James Bierbower, said after the commit
tee vote that his client wants to cooperate, but has been
hampered because she has been in California job-hunting.
Bierbower wrote a letter to the committee Monday urging
the panel to "reconsider" the planned vote, but Dingell said
there had been no real effort to make Lavelle available.
The committee vote came after the former EPA assistant
administrator twice defied subpoenas to appear before the
panel's investigations subcommittee.
Lavelle was in charge of the $1.6 billion "superfund" toxic
waste cleanup program. She was fired by President Reagan
on Feb. 7 after she refused a request by then-EPA Adminis
trator Anne McGill Burford that she resign.
Her firing sparked much of the congressional investigation
into alleged mismanagement and political manipulation of
the fund, a probe that ultimately involved five House sub
committees and one Senate committee.
Since her firing, she has appeared voluntarily before the
Senate Environment Committee and the House Public
Works and Transportation investigations subcommittee. But
she has twice failed to appear before the Energy and Com
merce panel.
Tests take toll on minority teachers
Atlanta —Across the country, but especially in the South,
competency tests to screen prospective teachers are
eliminating blacks and other minorities from the profession
at what some educators call alarming rates.
"We don't want anyone in the classroom who can't handle
the very things they're trying to train children to do," said
Ralph Turlington, Florida's commissioner of education. His
state's test measures an applicant's ability to perform
arithmetic at an Bth- or 9th-grade level, to read, write an es
say and to utilize "professional skills."
"We have a test every teacher ought to be able to pass," he
said.
But Walter Mercer, a professor at predominantly black
Florida A&M University, said, "The test is killing future black
teachers. It's an academic electric chair." Only 37 percent of
Florida A&M students who took the state test passed it, a
pass-rate similar to many other black colleges across the
South.
By 1985 at least 25 states are expected to require some kind
of teacher licensing exam similar to those now used in most
southern states. In California, sevenoutof lOminority teach
er applicants flunked the state's first licensing test in Decem
ber, among them a disproportionate number of blacks and
Hispanics. In Arizona, three out of four blacks and American
Indians who took that state teacher exam failed it last year.
Two out of three Hispanics flunked, compared with a white
failure rate of one in four.

Committee cites former EPA head
Washington —The House Energy and Commerce Com
mittee voted unanimously yesterday to cite former Environ
mental Protection Agency official Rita Lavelle for contempt
of Congress for defying subpoenas to testify before the panel
about alleged EPA mismanagement.
The vote sends the contempt citation to the House floor. A
vote there to cite Lavelle could result in criminal action
against her in U.S. District Court. Contempt is a misde
meanor punishable by a $1000 fine and up to a year in jail.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) the committee's chairman,
said he would be willing to drop the action if Lavelle appears
and cooperates with congressional investigators. But he

urged her to "move promptly," saying the House would vote
on the resolution "in the very near future."
Lavelle's attorney, James Bierbower, said after the commit
tee vote that his client wants to cooperate, but has been
hampered because she has been in California job-hunting.
Bierbower wrote a letter to the committee Monday urging
the panel to "reconsider" the planned vote, but Dingell said
there had been no real effort to make Lavelle available.
The committee vote came after the former EPA assistant
administrator twice defied subpoenas to appear before the
panel's investigations subcommittee.
Lavelle was in charge of the $1.6 billion "superfund" toxic
waste cleanup program. She was fired by President Reagan
on Feb. 7 after she refused a request by then-EPA Adminis
trator Anne McGill Burford that she resign.
Her firing sparked much of the congressional investigation
into alleged mismanagement and political manipulation of
the fund, a probe that ultimately involved five House sub
committees and one Senate committee.
Since her firing, she has appeared voluntarily before the
Senate Environment Committee and the House Public
Works and Transportation investigations subcommittee. But
she has twice failed to appear before the Energy and Com

Tests take toll on minority teachers
Atlanta —Across the country, but especially in the South,

"We don't want anyone in the classroom who can't handle
the very things they're trying to train children to do," said
Ralph Turlington, Florida's commissioner of education. His
state's test measures an applicant's ability to perform

"We have a test every teacher ought to be able to pass," he
said.
But Walter Mercer, a professor at predominantly black

teachers. It's an academic electric chair." Only 37 percent of
Florida A&M students who took the state test passed it, a
pass-rate similar to many other black colleges across the

By 1985 at least 25 states are expected to require some kind
of teacher licensing exam similar to those now used in most
southern states. In California, sevenoutof lOminority teach

Feinstein keeps office in recall election
San Francisco — Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a Stanford grad
uate, easily survived a recall election yesterday that was
spawned by her support for a handgun ban that was never
enforced.
Feinstein took 45,343 of the 51,033 absentee ballots
counted before the polls closed at 8 p.m. Officials estimated
that 150,000 of 354,000 registered voters would cast ballots.
There was little surprise in the outcome. Even leaders of
the hodgepodge of groups supporting the recall conceded
they had little chance to drive the mayor from office.
Feinstein, 49, fresh from last week's decision to hold the
1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, now
appears headed for an easy victory in her bid for re-election
in November.

Propelled into office in 1978 when Mayor George
Moscone was shot to death with a handgun, Feinstein was
forced into the recall by the White Panther Party, a tiny fringe
group angered by her support of a handgun ban.
Its 20 members circulated recall petitions — even after an
appeal court agreed the ban was unconstitutional — and
tapped a host of anti-Feinstein factions.
Tenants' groups were angry with the mayor's rent-control
policies; homosexual groups, with her veto of a domestic
partnership bill that would have given city benefits to un
married couples. Preservationists complained she wasn't vig
ilant enough about protecting historic buildings. Others
were disgruntled with high-rise development, with her at
tention to downtown San Francisco.
Beside touting her record in 4Vj years in office, Feinstein
struck a sympathetic chord with many voters by questioning

the propriety of using the recall process to challenge a mayor
who does not stand accused of corruption or incompetence.
She also got a boost from last week's decision to stage the
1984 Democratic convention in San Francisco.
But at the heart of her campaign strategy was the "ironing
board brigade," more than 2000 volunteers who took to
street corners and shopping centers to urge people to vote
by absentee ballot. They used ironing boards instead of card
tables because more people could cluster around and stand
while filling out applications for absentee ballots.
"Out of 70,000 (ballots) sent out, more than 40,000 were
generated by the mayor's campaign," Patterson said.
It was the first attempt to recall a San Francisco mayor since
1946, when Mayor Roger Lapham survived a recall attempt
sparked by a hike in the street car fares from 7 cents to a
dime.
The recall was forced when the White Panthers turned in
petitions bearing 34,800 signatures, of which 23,780 were val
id. Just 19,357 valid signatures —10 percent of the number of
votes cast in the last mayoral election — were needed to
qualify the recall.
El Salvador to meet aid conditions
San Salvador — The government here will meet the price
Rep. Clarence Long (D-Md.) put on his crucial House com
mittee's approval of $60 million in U.S. military aid by releas
ing political prisoners and allowing unannounced inspec
tions-of penitentiaries and police cells, Long said Monday at
a news conference.
But Long expressed little optimism over his apparent suc
cess at winning these concessions.
In a statement he read to reporters, Long said that
Salvadoran President Alvaro Magana assured him after two
meetings in the last two days that "the prisons and detention
centers will be open to unannounced, unrestricted visits by
the International Red Cross and that following early passage
of the Amnesty Law (thus far stalled in the constituent as
sembly) substantial numbers of political prisoners, hopefully
in the hundreds, will be released."
Long accepts the scenario often presented by U.S. Am
bassador Deane Hinton that an aid cutoff would lead, in
Long's words to "a right-wing military coup, possibly fol
lowed by a bloodbath."
In Washington, President Reagan's request for $60 million
in military aid to El Salvador was cut in half by a House panel
yesterday as he readied a special plea to Congress and the
nation to rally behind his Central America policy.
The 7-5 decision by the Appropriations subcommittee on
112o r eign operations to slash the Salvador aid to $30 million fol
lowed a tie vote, 6-6, that would have barred any decision at
all for 90 days. The compromise was engineered by Chair
man Clarence Long (D-Md.) who just returned from El
Salvador.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee already had set
tled on an identical cut.
Meanwhile, the full Senate talked behind closed doors
about whether the administration is waging a covert cam
paign against Nicaragua. And Reagan promised to name a
special envoy for Central America, whose duties will include
assisting "the Salvadorans in their efforts to find a basis for
dialogue with their opponents."
Speculation centered on former Democratic Sen. Richard
Stone of Florida as the choice for that post.
Kirkpatrick defends El Salvador policy
United Nations —U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick took
on critics of the Reagan administration's Central American
policy yesterday, giving sharp treatment to people ranging
from Soviet leader Yuri Andropov to Rep. Clarence Long,
(D-Md.)
Speaking at a luncheon meeting of the United Nations
Correspondents Association, the U.S. envoy rejected what a
reporter called her role as "secretary of state for Latin Ameri
ca." But, she appeared to reinforce such status as she dealt
authoritatively with Latin questions, which dominated the
session.
Of Andropov's justification of Soviet intervention in Af
ghanistan because of alleged U.S. actions in Nicaragua, she
said, "There could be no analogy of the Soviet position in Af
ghanistan to that of the United States in Nicaragua until or
unless the United States had 100,000 occupation troops in
Nicaragua."
When Long returned to the United States from Central

America this week, he referred to the army of El Salvador as a
"wet noodle." Kirkpatrick's response:
"It's very easy from comfortable luncheon tables in New
York or congressional offices in Washington to level harsh
criticisms of men and women who are risking their lives on
battlefields confronting guerrillas using real bullets. The first
appropriate U.S. response is a little more respect .... El
Salvador has never confronted such a challenge and neither
have we. I think another appropriate response is for the
United States to provide more adequate training."
Kirkpatrick showed even less regard for West German au
thor Gunter Grass and Norwegian actress Liv Ullman.
Grass has suggested that both Poland and Nicaragua are
suffering from the actions of "big brothers."
Kirkpatrick said, "The people of Poland and Nicaragua
have the same big brother on their necks. They are in both
cases the Soviet Union and in both cases imposing a tyranny
which deprives the people of freedom and the guarantees
associated with democracy."
Shultz meets with Mubarak
Cairo, Egypt —Secretary of State George Shultz received
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's full support yesterday
for what is expected to be a grueling effort to get an agree
ment for the withdrawal of Israeli and other foreign troops
from Lebanon.
The effort begins in earnest today when Shultz goes to Is
rael for a meeting with Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
who has set conditions for a troop withdrawal that Lebanon
is unwilling to meet.
After a 3Vi-hour meeting with Mubarak, Shultz gave re
porters the clear impression that he and Mubarak agreed
that Israel's terms were excessive. Israel has been insisting on
leaving behind a small contingent of security forces to pro
tect its northern border and on a key security role for the Is

But at the heart of her campaign strategy was the "ironing
board brigade," more than 2000 volunteers who took to
street corners and shopping centers to urge people to vote
by absentee ballot. They used ironing boards instead of card
tables because more people could cluster around and stand
while filling out applications for absentee ballots.
"Out of 70,000 (ballots) sent out, more than 40,000 were
generated by the mayor's campaign," Patterson said.
It was the first attempt to recall a San Francisco mayor since
1946, when Mayor Roger Lapham survived a recall attempt
sparked by a hike in the street car fares from 7 cents to a
dime.
The recall was forced when the White Panthers turned in
petitions bearing 34,800 signatures, of which 23,780 were val
id. Just 19,357 valid signatures —10 percent of the number of
votes cast in the last mayoral election — were needed to
qualify the recall.
El Salvador to meet aid conditions
San Salvador — The government here will meet the price
Rep. Clarence Long (D-Md.) put on his crucial House com
mittee's approval of $60 million in U.S. military aid by releas
ing political prisoners and allowing unannounced inspec
tions-of penitentiaries and police cells, Long said Monday at
a news conference.
But Long expressed little optimism over his apparent suc
cess at winning these concessions.
In a statement he read to reporters, Long said that
Salvadoran President Alvaro Magana assured him after two
meetings in the last two days that "the prisons and detention
centers will be open to unannounced, unrestricted visits by
the International Red Cross and that following early passage
of the Amnesty Law (thus far stalled in the constituent as
sembly) substantial numbers of political prisoners, hopefully
in the hundreds, will be released."
Long accepts the scenario often presented by U.S. Am
bassador Deane Hinton that an aid cutoff would lead, in
Long's words to "a right-wing military coup, possibly fol
lowed by a bloodbath."
In Washington, President Reagan's request for $60 million
in military aid to El Salvador was cut in half by a House panel
yesterday as he readied a special plea to Congress and the
nation to rally behind his Central America policy.
The 7-5 decision by the Appropriations subcommittee on
112o r eign operations to slash the Salvador aid to $30 million fol
lowed a tie vote, 6-6, that would have barred any decision at
all for 90 days. The compromise was engineered by Chair
man Clarence Long (D-Md.) who just returned from El
Salvador.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee already had set
tled on an identical cut.
Meanwhile, the full Senate talked behind closed doors
about whether the administration is waging a covert cam
paign against Nicaragua. And Reagan promised to name a
special envoy for Central America, whose duties will include
assisting "the Salvadorans in their efforts to find a basis for
dialogue with their opponents."
Speculation centered on former Democratic Sen. Richard
Stone of Florida as the choice for that post.
Kirkpatrick defends El Salvador policy
United Nations —U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick took
on critics of the Reagan administration's Central American
policy yesterday, giving sharp treatment to people ranging
from Soviet leader Yuri Andropov to Rep. Clarence Long,
(D-Md.)
Speaking at a luncheon meeting of the United Nations
Correspondents Association, the U.S. envoy rejected what a
reporter called her role as "secretary of state for Latin Ameri
ca." But, she appeared to reinforce such status as she dealt
authoritatively with Latin questions, which dominated the
session.
Of Andropov's justification of Soviet intervention in Af
ghanistan because of alleged U.S. actions in Nicaragua, she
said, "There could be no analogy of the Soviet position in Af
ghanistan to that of the United States in Nicaragua until or
unless the United States had 100,000 occupation troops in
Nicaragua."
When Long returned to the United States from Central

America this week, he referred to the army of El Salvador as a
"wet noodle." Kirkpatrick's response:
"It's very easy from comfortable luncheon tables in New
York or congressional offices in Washington to level harsh
criticisms of men and women who are risking their lives on
battlefields confronting guerrillas using real bullets. The first
appropriate U.S. response is a little more respect .... El
Salvador has never confronted such a challenge and neither
have we. I think another appropriate response is for the
United States to provide more adequate training."
Kirkpatrick showed even less regard for West German au

Shultz meets with Mubarak
Cairo, Egypt —Secretary of State George Shultz received
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's full support yesterday
for what is expected to be a grueling effort to get an agree
ment for the withdrawal of Israeli and other foreign troops
from Lebanon.
The effort begins in earnest today when Shultz goes to Is
rael for a meeting with Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
who has set conditions for a troop withdrawal that Lebanon
is unwilling to meet.
After a 3Vi-hour meeting with Mubarak, Shultz gave re
porters the clear impression that he and Mubarak agreed
that Israel's terms were excessive. Israel has been insisting on
leaving behind a small contingent of security forces to pro
tect its northern border and on a key security role for the Is
raeli-backed militia leader Maj. Saad Haddad.
With Mubarak at his side, the secretary sa'dthey discussed
the urgent need for a withdrawal agreement that "honors
the necessity of a sovereign Lebanon able to rule itself."
"The views of the president of Egypt and the views of the
president of the United States are identical on this issue," he
said.
Asked if he thought it might be possible to arrange forthe
withdrawal of Israeli troops during the trip, Shultz replied,
"It's certainly possible but we will see."
Mubarak, who said Shultz gave him a letter from President
Reagan concerning Middle East problems, said he hoped the
secretary's trip to the region would conclude with "some
thing beneficial to the whole region."
He said there must be a complete withdrawal of all foreign
forces from Lebanon.
Mubarak also said Egypt considers Reagan's faltering
Middle East peace initiative a "golden opportunity" for
peace. He urged the Palestinians to meet itsterms by "declar
ing a linkage with Jordan" that will make possible peace ne
gotiations with Israel.
Committee cites former EPA head
Washington —The House Energy and Commerce Com
mittee voted unanimously yesterday to cite former Environ
mental Protection Agency official Rita Lavelle for contempt
of Congress for defying subpoenas to testify before the panel
about alleged EPA mismanagement.
The vote sends the contempt citation to the House floor. A
vote there to cite Lavelle could result in criminal action
against her in U.S. District Court. Contempt is a misde
meanor punishable by a $1000 fine and up to a year in jail.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) the committee's chairman,
said he would be willing to drop the action if Lavelle appears
and cooperates with congressional investigators. But he

urged her to "move promptly," saying the House would vote
on the resolution "in the very near future."
Lavelle's attorney, James Bierbower, said after the commit
tee vote that his client wants to cooperate, but has been
hampered because she has been in California job-hunting.
Bierbower wrote a letter to the committee Monday urging
the panel to "reconsider" the planned vote, but Dingell said
there had been no real effort to make Lavelle available.
The committee vote came after the former EPA assistant
administrator twice defied subpoenas to appear before the
panel's investigations subcommittee.
Lavelle was in charge of the $1.6 billion "superfund" toxic
waste cleanup program. She was fired by President Reagan
on Feb. 7 after she refused a request by then-EPA Adminis
trator Anne McGill Burford that she resign.
Her firing sparked much of the congressional investigation
into alleged mismanagement and political manipulation of
the fund, a probe that ultimately involved five House sub
committees and one Senate committee.
Since her firing, she has appeared voluntarily before the
Senate Environment Committee and the House Public
Works and Transportation investigations subcommittee. But
she has twice failed to appear before the Energy and Com
merce panel.
Tests take toll on minority teachers
Atlanta —Across the country, but especially in the South,
competency tests to screen prospective teachers are
eliminating blacks and other minorities from the profession
at what some educators call alarming rates.
"We don't want anyone in the classroom who can't handle
the very things they're trying to train children to do," said
Ralph Turlington, Florida's commissioner of education. His
state's test measures an applicant's ability to perform
arithmetic at an Bth- or 9th-grade level, to read, write an es
say and to utilize "professional skills."
"We have a test every teacher ought to be able to pass," he
said.
But Walter Mercer, a professor at predominantly black
Florida A&M University, said, "The test is killing future black
teachers. It's an academic electric chair." Only 37 percent of
Florida A&M students who took the state test passed it, a
pass-rate similar to many other black colleges across the
South.
By 1985 at least 25 states are expected to require some kind
of teacher licensing exam similar to those now used in most
southern states. In California, sevenoutof lOminority teach
er applicants flunked the state's first licensing test in Decem
ber, among them a disproportionate number of blacks and
Hispanics. In Arizona, three out of four blacks and American
Indians who took that state teacher exam failed it last year.
Two out of three Hispanics flunked, compared with a white
failure rate of one in four.

Feinstein keeps office in recall election
San Francisco — Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a Stanford grad
uate, easily survived a recall election yesterday that was
spawned by her support for a handgun ban that was never
enforced.
Feinstein took 45,343 of the 51,033 absentee ballots
counted before the polls closed at 8 p.m. Officials estimated
that 150,000 of 354,000 registered voters would cast ballots.
There was little surprise in the outcome. Even leaders of
the hodgepodge of groups supporting the recall conceded
they had little chance to drive the mayor from office.
Feinstein, 49, fresh from last week's decision to hold the
1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, now
appears headed for an easy victory in her bid for re-election
in November.

Propelled into office in 1978 when Mayor George
Moscone was shot to death with a handgun, Feinstein was
forced into the recall by the White Panther Party, a tiny fringe
group angered by her support of a handgun ban.
Its 20 members circulated recall petitions — even after an
appeal court agreed the ban was unconstitutional — and
tapped a host of anti-Feinstein factions.
Tenants' groups were angry with the mayor's rent-control
policies; homosexual groups, with her veto of a domestic
partnership bill that would have given city benefits to un
married couples. Preservationists complained she wasn't vig
ilant enough about protecting historic buildings. Others
were disgruntled with high-rise development, with her at
tention to downtown San Francisco.
Beside touting her record in 4Vj years in office, Feinstein
struck a sympathetic chord with many voters by questioning

the propriety of using the recall process to challenge a mayor
who does not stand accused of corruption or incompetence.
She also got a boost from last week's decision to stage the
1984 Democratic convention in San Francisco.
But at the heart of her campaign strategy was the "ironing
board brigade," more than 2000 volunteers who took to
street corners and shopping centers to urge people to vote
by absentee ballot. They used ironing boards instead of card
tables because more people could cluster around and stand
while filling out applications for absentee ballots.
"Out of 70,000 (ballots) sent out, more than 40,000 were
generated by the mayor's campaign," Patterson said.
It was the first attempt to recall a San Francisco mayor since
1946, when Mayor Roger Lapham survived a recall attempt
sparked by a hike in the street car fares from 7 cents to a
dime.
The recall was forced when the White Panthers turned in
petitions bearing 34,800 signatures, of which 23,780 were val

votes cast in the last mayoral election — were needed to

said he would be willing to drop the action if Lavelle appears
and cooperates with congressional investigators. But he

urged her to "move promptly," saying the House would vote
on the resolution "in the very near future."
Lavelle's attorney, James Bierbower, said after the commit
tee vote that his client wants to cooperate, but has been
hampered because she has been in California job-hunting.
Bierbower wrote a letter to the committee Monday urging
the panel to "reconsider" the planned vote, but Dingell said
there had been no real effort to make Lavelle available.
The committee vote came after the former EPA assistant
administrator twice defied subpoenas to appear before the
panel's investigations subcommittee.
Lavelle was in charge of the $1.6 billion "superfund" toxic
waste cleanup program. She was fired by President Reagan
on Feb. 7 after she refused a request by then-EPA Adminis
trator Anne McGill Burford that she resign.
Her firing sparked much of the congressional investigation
into alleged mismanagement and political manipulation of
the fund, a probe that ultimately involved five House sub
committees and one Senate committee.
Since her firing, she has appeared voluntarily before the
Senate Environment Committee and the House Public
Works and Transportation investigations subcommittee. But
she has twice failed to appear before the Energy and Com
merce panel.
Tests take toll on minority teachers
Atlanta —Across the country, but especially in the South,
competency tests to screen prospective teachers are
eliminating blacks and other minorities from the profession
at what some educators call alarming rates.
"We don't want anyone in the classroom who can't handle
the very things they're trying to train children to do," said
Ralph Turlington, Florida's commissioner of education. His
state's test measures an applicant's ability to perform
arithmetic at an Bth- or 9th-grade level, to read, write an es
say and to utilize "professional skills."
"We have a test every teacher ought to be able to pass," he
said.
But Walter Mercer, a professor at predominantly black
Florida A&M University, said, "The test is killing future black
teachers. It's an academic electric chair." Only 37 percent of
Florida A&M students who took the state test passed it, a
pass-rate similar to many other black colleges across the
South.
By 1985 at least 25 states are expected to require some kind
of teacher licensing exam similar to those now used in most
southern states. In California, sevenoutof lOminority teach
er applicants flunked the state's first licensing test in Decem
ber, among them a disproportionate number of blacks and
Hispanics. In Arizona, three out of four blacks and American
Indians who took that state teacher exam failed it last year.
Two out of three Hispanics flunked, compared with a white
failure rate of one in four.
