San Jose — John Elway told the Bal
timore Colts yesterday to trade him
or lose him after the team selected
the Stanford quarterback first in the
National Football League draft.
Elway, who has the option of play
ing professional baseball for the New
York Yankees, said if Baltimore does
not deal him to a "West Coast team
or a (NFL) contender" he will choose
baseball.
"The way things stand right now,
I'm playing baseball," he said yester
day afternoon at a press conference
here. "I haven't ruled out football,
but right now I'm closer to baseball
than football."
If the Cardinal star decides to wear
Yankee pinstripes, he could leave as
many as tour Stanford football
teammates behind him in the NFL.
Tight end Chris Dressel was
drafted by the Houston Oilers in the
third round, the 65th player chosen
overall. Running back Vincent White
went in round six to the New York

Jets, running back Mike Dotterer was
the Los Angeles Raiders' eighth
round choice and offensive lineman
Chris Rose was taken by the Colts in
the ninth.
Elway and his father, Jack Elway,
the head football coach at San Jose
State, had warned the Colts for the
past three months he did not want to
play football for Baltimore, an East
Coast team which was 0-8-1 in the
strike-shortened 1982 season.
"They knew I had the royal flush
and they still called me on it," Elway
said.
The two Elways said the San Diego
Chargers and Los Angeles Raiders
made lucrative offers to the Colts for
the No. 1 draft pick, but these fell
through.
"Everytime someone would offer
something, Baltimore would up it,"
Elway noted.
The Stanford senior did not set a
deadline for the Colts to trade him.
"But the longer they wait (to make a
deal), the more the stock goes
down."
Half an hour before the start of yes
terday's draft (8 a.m. EDT), the Colts
called Elway and asked if he would
play for the New England Patriots,
with whom they had apparently
reached an agreement.
Elway said "no" and the Colts
drafted him first. Baltimore coach
Frank Kush, the former head coach at
Arizona State, telephoned after the
No. 1 choice was made and talked
briefly with an angry Elway.
"I said, 'Mr. Kush, I don't want to
be a jerk or anything, but we've told
you for the past three months that I
don't want to play for Baltimore. And
I know for a fact that you've been
offered three one's (first-round draft
picks) and a quarterback and you
turned that down. And right now
you've got nothing.' And then I hung
up the phone."

made by the Los Angeles Raiders in
volving three first-round picks and
reserve quarterback Marc Wilson.
Elway's father spoke of a "three first
round draft picks and some others
on top of that" deal with the San
Diego Chargers that Baltimore also
refused.
"We realize they (the Colts)
earned the right to pick first," Elway's
father said. "We're not challenging
the draft and all our dealings were
honest and straight-forward."
Elway said he has reached an ag
reement with the Yankees that only
needs to be signed if he so desires.
"In principle, it has been agreed
upon. The Yankees haven't put a
deadline on (signing) it."
He estimated the value of the con
tract to be worth an average of
$500,000 per year for five years, with
the option of getting out after the
first, second or third season.
If he signs with the Yankees, Elway
said he would play on the team's
Class A minor league club in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., after his June 12
graduation from Stanford.
Last summer, the senior
economics major had a .318 batting
average in 42 games with another
Yankee Class A team in Oneonta,
N.Y. Elway was paid $140,000 for the
six-week stint.
New York had obtained his
baseball rights via the college
baseball draft after his sophomore
season at Stanford.
His football statistics were far more
impressive, however. The Cardinal
signal caller set 17 Pacific-10 Confer
ence records and passed for a career
total of 9349 yards and 77
touchdowns.
"I'm a lot farther ahead in football
than baseball because I've spent a lot
more time on football," Elway said.

San Jose — John Elway told the Bal
timore Colts yesterday to trade him
or lose him after the team selected
the Stanford quarterback first in the
National Football League draft.
Elway, who has the option of play
ing professional baseball for the New
York Yankees, said if Baltimore does
not deal him to a "West Coast team
or a (NFL) contender" he will choose
baseball.
"The way things stand right now,
I'm playing baseball," he said yester
day afternoon at a press conference
here. "I haven't ruled out football,
but right now I'm closer to baseball
than football."
If the Cardinal star decides to wear
Yankee pinstripes, he could leave as
many as tour Stanford football
teammates behind him in the NFL.
Tight end Chris Dressel was
drafted by the Houston Oilers in the
third round, the 65th player chosen
overall. Running back Vincent White
went in round six to the New York

Jets, running back Mike Dotterer was
the Los Angeles Raiders' eighth
round choice and offensive lineman
