# University accepts gay scholarship
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
After several months of con
troversy, the University has accepted
gifts totaling $2040 solicited by the
Cay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) to establish a scholarship for
a male medical student who has
shown a commitment to serving the
gay community.
GLAS set up the scholarship in re
sponse to the University's rejection
of an earlier scholarship offer by a
Florida psychiatrist which would
have required the recipient to openly
declare his homosexuality, said
graduate student Doug Bernard, a
member of the GLAS steering com
mittee which spearheaded the fun
draising.
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
said the University rejected the pre
vious scholarship offer, a $500 grant
donated by Dr. Robert Ragland, be
cause "it stipulated that the recipient
had to be openly gay." The GLAS
scholarship only asks that "prefer
ence" be given to a student who is
committed to serving the gay com
munity.
Bernard stressed, "The Ragland
offer did not use the 'preference'â€”
that's one point the University is very
strict on. They want to have it written
as a preference not a requirement."
While Ragland would have required
that the recipient be "an openly gay
student," Bernard said the GLAS
scholarship could to "a gay student
or a non-gay student."
Hamrdla said, "We have problems
with scholarships that have stipula
tions," He explained that the Univer
sity accepted the GLAS scholarship
because it requires no declaration of
faith on the part of the recipient, one
of the main complaints concerning
Ragland's offer.
GLAS assumed responsibility for
organizing a scholarship when it be
came apparent that the University
would reject the first offer.
"We saw a situation where the
University was in a position of turn
ing down a scholarship directed to
ward the gay community. We didn't
fell that that should reflect Stanford
University's position in this view. We
wanted to come up with a scholar
ship that would meet their reasona
ble objections to the Ragland scho
larship and see that would be accept
able." said Bernard.
