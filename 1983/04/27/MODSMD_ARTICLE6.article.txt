# University accepts gay scholarship
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
After several months of con
troversy, the University has accepted
gifts totaling $2040 solicited by the
Cay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS) to establish a scholarship for
a male medical student who has
shown a commitment to serving the
gay community.
GLAS set up the scholarship in re
sponse to the University's rejection
of an earlier scholarship offer by a
Florida psychiatrist which would
have required the recipient to openly
declare his homosexuality, said
graduate student Doug Bernard, a
member of the GLAS steering com
mittee which spearheaded the fun
draising.
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
said the University rejected the pre
vious scholarship offer, a $500 grant
donated by Dr. Robert Ragland, be
cause "it stipulated that the recipient
had to be openly gay." The GLAS
scholarship only asks that "prefer
ence" be given to a student who is
committed to serving the gay com
munity.
Bernard stressed, "The Ragland
offer did not use the 'preference'—
that's one point the University is very
strict on. They want to have it written
as a preference not a requirement."
While Ragland would have required
that the recipient be "an openly gay
student," Bernard said the GLAS
scholarship could to "a gay student
or a non-gay student."
Hamrdla said, "We have problems
with scholarships that have stipula
tions," He explained that the Univer
sity accepted the GLAS scholarship
because it requires no declaration of
faith on the part of the recipient, one
of the main complaints concerning
Ragland's offer.
GLAS assumed responsibility for
organizing a scholarship when it be
came apparent that the University
would reject the first offer.
"We saw a situation where the
University was in a position of turn
ing down a scholarship directed to
ward the gay community. We didn't
fell that that should reflect Stanford
University's position in this view. We
wanted to come up with a scholar
ship that would meet their reasona
ble objections to the Ragland scho
larship and see that would be accept
able." said Bernard.
"It would have been very upsetting
if, having met the reasonable objec
tions of the University to the Ragland
scholarship," the University still re
jected the GLAS offer, Bernard con
tinued. "That would have been very
disconcerting."
Ralph Samuelson, a graduate stu
dent in engineering economic sys
tems and another member of the
GLAS steering committee, said, "I
think it was important to give the
University the chance to show that
they weren't turning down (Rag
land's) scholarship just because it
was gay-oriented."
The $2040—51000 more than GLAS
originally hoped to raise—was do
nated by 35 individuals. "We raised
$550 within the (10-member) steering
committee ourselves," Bernard said.
"We put out an appeal to our mailing
list and we also posted notices so that
member would see that opportunity,
and in addition we asked the newly
formed Gay Alumni Club of Stanford
for assistance and they were very
helpful. More money is still coming
in," Bernard added.
In a letter from GLAS to Kennedy,
the steering committee suggested
some ways in which a student's
"commitment to serving the gay
community" could be displayed:
• active involvement in an organi
zation oriented toward serving the
gay community;
• pursuit of a course of studies
specifically directed toward prepar
ing the student for service to the gay
community;
• performance of research specifi
cally directed toward developing im
proved health care techniques for
gay men or lesbians.
Bernard explained that GLAS
chose a medical student as the reci
pient because "we wanted to raise
the issue in the medical profession.
Medical care in the gay community is
a very serious concern, not just in
terms of diseases but also in terms of
the type and quality of care that gay
people receive from their physi
cians," he said.
The University will probably award
the scholarship next year.
