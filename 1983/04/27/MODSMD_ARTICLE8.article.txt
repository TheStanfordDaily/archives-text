professor of biochemistry and

Dominick Purpura, a neuroscientist
and dean of the School of
Medicine—have been elected to the
National Academy of Sciences, the
academy announced yesterday.
Davis and Purpura will join the
ranks of more that 1000 American
scientists currently members of the
NAS, a prestigious organization of
private scientists dedicated to scho
larship and service to society. The
election of Davis and Purpura bring
the number of Stanford faculty in the
NAS to 80, a membership one pro

cherished memberships a professor
can have."

NAS member and the election pro

"This is an honorary position,"
said Purpura. "It's a feeling of honor
to be recognized by one's peers
one's accomplishments in the field
of neuroscience."
Purpura has conducted the bulk of
his research in the field of fundamen

tal neuroscience, emphasizing
neurobiological and mental retarda
tion. He was among the first to ob
serve that the brains of children who
suffer from mental retardation with
no known chromosomal aberrations
had structural abnormalities in their
nerve cells.
Purpura became dean in 1982. He
is the holder of the Carol and
Elizabeth Naumann endowed chair,
as well as professor in the depart
ments of Neurobiology and Neurol
ogy-
Davis, a widely recognized elec
tron microscopist, has focused his
research on gene manipulation.
While at the California Institute of
Technology, Davis developed a
method of analysis which has been
significant in mapping sequences of
DNA molecules.
Colleague Robert Lehman, also a
professor of biochemistry, described
Davis as "an outstanding biochemist
who has made very original contribu

tions to his field."
Davis joined the University faculty in
1972.
