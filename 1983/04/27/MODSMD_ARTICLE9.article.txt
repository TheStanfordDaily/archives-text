# Med Center seeks marrow donors
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Medical School
Blood Bank has agreed to help iden
tify potential bone marrow donors for
an East Coast man who will not live
more than a few months without a
transplant, following an appeal from
two of the man's friends.
F. Carl Crumet, associate medical
director of the blood center, an
nounced yesterday that the Medical
School has agreed to assist Long Is
land businessmen David Kolatch and
David Welner in an attempt to locate
a suitable bone marrow donor for
their friend Edgar Frenkel.
Kolatch and Welner came to Stan
ford because the blood center here is
one of a small group of centers in the
country where precise blood typing
of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
characteristics is performed. The
Stanford center has the records of
approximately 1000 donors who have
undergone HLA testing on file. Be
cause the test costs about $300,
Kolatch and Welner are hoping to
identify a possible donor from
among those who have already been
tested.
Grumet said he would send letters
to all of the donors who have been
typed, informing them of Frenkel's
need and of the potential to donate
marrow for other leukemia sufferers.
He would not identify and contact a
specific donor for Frenkel from
among the blood center records, he
said, "because it is unfair to ask
people who have agreed to donate
blood for purpose A to have their
name added to a list for purpose B."
"These donors are really special
people who are already giving quite a

bit. We do not want to put them
under undue pressure," Grumet
said. Bone marrow donors suffer
temporary discomfort but there is
almost no risk involved in the pro
cess, he said.
After a cursory check of blood
center records, no potential donors
have been found, according to
Grumet. He said the closest match he
has found from an initial screening is
himself, with four of the six HLA fac
tors matching.
The chance of finding a perfect
match for Frenkel among those that
have been HLA tested is about one in
several hundred thousand, Grumet
said.
Frenkel, 34, a psychiatrist who
once published a paper on treating
terminally ill patients, suffers from
chronic mylogenous leukemia, a
disease which can only be halted if
the growth in the number of whites
blood cells can be halted.
After two years of various
chemotherapies, Frenkel's white
blood cell count has risen past
800,000 more than 100 times normal.
A transplant is now his only hope.
Without one, his doctors say, he will
probably live only a few months.
Kolatch said, "We're hopeful that
as we pursue this, we will be able to
find a donor (for Frenkel). But even if
we can't, we hope that what we do
will be of lasting use to society."
Persons who have been HLA tested
and are interested in cooperating
with Frenkel's friends should write to
Bone Marrow Transplant Search
Center, P.O. Box 600, Cedarhurst,
New York, 11516. A $25,000 reward
will be paid to the donor, if one can
be found.
