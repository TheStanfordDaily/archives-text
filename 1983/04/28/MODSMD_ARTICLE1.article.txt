# Expert discusses 'Hitler' diaries
## 
### LIBBY OSBORNE 
History Prof. Gordon Craig said
he is delighted by the discovery of
what appears to be 60 volumes of
a secret diary handwritten by
World War II Nazi party leader
Adolf Hitler.
Determining the authenticity of
the diary has caused much con
troversy, but experts have had lit
tle evidence on which to base
their opinions because ot the sec
retive policies of Der Stern
magazine.
Stern, the German magazine
which has been purchasing the
volumes from an unknown source
during the past two years, has al
lowed few people to gather what
Craig terms "external evidence"
— handwriting and paper
analysis.
However, Stern's authen
ticators and the two outside ex
perts who have examined the

diaries, British historian Hugh
Trevor-Roper and Prof. Gerald
Weinberg of the University ot
North Carolina have said they are
inclined to believe in its authentic
ity.
According to Craig, those who
are doubtful base their opinions
on the only information they have
available: the very few excerpts
which have been published in Der
Stern.
He said he has "read nothing in
them to indicate that they are not
authentic," but emphasizes that
he is in no position to hypothesize
since the evidence available is ex
tremely sparse.
"Rewriting History," the eye
catching sub-title which appears
in Newsweek (May 2), is not ap
propriate, Craig said, whether or
not documents prove authentic.
The diaries will be significant sim
plv because they are the thoughts

of "one of the great leaders of the
I9th century."
The diaries could be an attempt
by Hitler at "self glorification" or
even an authentic "tissue of lies,"
Craig said.
He said he hopes the diaries will
be proven authentic. But he
doubts that he personally will be
able to scrutinize them, at least in
the near future, since Stern
magazineis planning to makepro
fits by publishing weekly excerpts
during the next two years.
