## Journalism fellow analyzes West Germany's politics 
### RANDY BROBERG Staff writer 
Contrary to popular American perceptions of its recent elections, the
Federal Republic ot Germany is not being taken over by "wild men" of the
Green Party but rather the elections have confirmed "a middle of the road
course," said Wolfgang Borgmann of the Stuttgarter Zeitung on Tuesday.
Borgmann, a professional journalism fellow here, spoke to about 75
people at the Bechtel International Center on the topic, "Germany — Where
is it heading? Germany after the elections and before the missile deploy
ment." Interest in German politics has increased recently because of the
change in government and especially because of the entrance of the en
vironmentalist, neutralist Green Party to the West German Parliament. The
scheduled deployment of 572 Pershing lis and ground launched cruise
missiles in West Germany and several other NATO countries has also
sparked a great deal of speculation about possible protests and demonstra
tions this year.
After the Social Democrat government of Helmut Schmidt lost a no
confidence vote in the West German Bundestag late last year, the Christian
Democrat Party led by Helmut Kohl took over the reigns of government in
coalition with the small but pivotal Free Democrat Party. In national elections
last month Kohl was confirmed in power with nearly 49 percent of the vote.
The Social Democrats fell four percentage points to 38 percent and the Free
Democrats barely remained in Parliament with seven percent.
According to Borgmann, the Reagan administration has attempted to
claim the victory of fellow conservative, Christian Democrat Kohl as "not
only a confirmation for the alliance, which it was to some extent, but also as a
confirmation of the administration's policies. But every . . . specialist on
German affairs . . . warns not to regard this election as a vote of confidence
for the policies of the Reagan administration," he said. "The election was
not about missiles or the environment, but about the economy."
Accounts of the elections have focused on the entrance of the Green Party
to the Bundestag for the first time. The Green Party, a coalition of mostly
young leftists but with some older and more moderate elements as well,
attained just over the five percent floor necessary for representation in the
Bundestag. The Greens have been perhaps the most outspoken critics of the
deployment of the intermediate range nuclear missiles in Germany and even
of German membership in the Atlantic alliance.
Borgmann, who witnessed student unrest while a student at the University
of Hamburg and at the London School of Economics during the '60s, con
cluded, "The Greens, every fourth young voter was in favor of them, cer
tainly represent a basic feeling of frustration with German politics in the
younger generation." But he did not want his listeners to conclude that
Germany was "being taken over by wild men. I would say this picture is a
classis example of distortion. . . .First of all, the Greens did not get 50
percent, but 5.5 percent and barely managed, although for the first time, to
enter parliament. And whatever they are, they are basically not undemocra
tic or apolitical."
Borgmann noted that although the addition of the Green Party to the West
German parliament represents something novel, its influence is extremely
limited — relative to other western European nations, West Germany is still
dominated by moderate, basically centrist parties. Borgmann repeated

former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's description of Germany as "stinknor
mal" or "bloody normal." He continued by arguing that Germany has been a
"very stable country."
Borgmann documented his assertions of German stability by pointing out
how few changes of government Germany has had since World War 11 and by
downgrading the political differences between Schmidt and Kohl: "There is
certainly no striking political difference between the two Helmuts ... al
though they personally dislike each other . . . That (Bavarian conservative

leader of the Christian Social Union Franz-Joseph) Strauss lost in political
infighting against the moderate Kohl can be seen as another confirmation of
Germany's middle-of-the-road course."
There was a very high level of interest in the elections; almost 90 percent of
those eligible to vote did so. Subsequent polls indicated that 86 percent of
those voting favored maintaining membership in NATO, but 65 percent were
opposed to the proposed NATO missile deployment. Because of these
figures many observers deny the election was a mandate for the political
right, but was only a mandate for the Christian Democrat-Free Democrat

coalition to handle the economy.
But Borgmann reasoned that prospects for the future might not be so calm
and stable: "However normal Germany might appear to an informed ob
server from outside, there is a potential for frustration and political unrest in
the future — and there is certainly within the spectrum of the Greens and the
peace movement a tendency to civil disobedience and even of disregard of
the law. This can very easily explode in a main crisis, which many expect if the
missiles should be deployed, beginning at the end of this year."
Borgmann argued, however, that regardless of the pacificism and oppos
tion to the missiles in West Germany, the majority of West Germans "know
that Germany's place is in the Western alliance, because Germany is not
powerful enough to follow its own way. . . .So what informed Germans hope
is a gradual change in the political climate here in (the USA), a swing back to
the middle-of-the-road politics which most Germans prefer. They fear
Reagan's simplistic views."
Europeans are still very fond of detente. In Germany there is a "lively
interest in detente," Borgmann said. He continued, "Germans caused and
suffered the Second World War, and they were one of the main causes for
the First World War. They want peace more than anything else."
Germans are appreciative of the gains made by treaties with the com
munist bloc which were the products of West German Ostpolik. Borgmann
outlined a number of specific elements of the Eastern treaties which "made
Germany a safer place . . . (and) made life a bit easier." Germans do not want
to change the status quo, he concluded.
Germans do not perceive the Soviet Union in the same way that Ameri
cans do. According to Borgmann, "they regard them as calculable. They
don't see them as cause of all evil in the world and they don't want to
destabilize the economy of the East." He further argued that a country as
small as West Germany and as near to the Soviet threat, as a matter of
survival, cannot afford to be anything but "realist" in its approach to the
USSR.
The proposed missile deployment leaves the West facing a tragic dilemma.
Although "the Pershings and cruise missiles were intended mainly as bar
gaining chips, not as ends in themselves . . . it's very likely that these
weapons will be deployed . . . The missiles have become a question of
survival for the alliance. If they are not deployed in face of inevitable resis
tance, especially but not only in Germany, this would be seen as a weakening
of the alliance and a victory for the Russians — and nobody in government in
the West really wants this. Helmut Kohl does not want it."
By contrast, Borgmann continued, "one has to fear that the deployment
will lead to a new arms race of middle range weapons, which might not add
to security and might worsen the already strained political and emotional
relations between Germany and the United States."
Beginning and ending his speech by referring to U.S.-German relations in
a broader sense, Borgmann said, "Germans, living in the middle of Europe,
tend to think that they are the center of the world . . . and complain about
the ignorance of Americans ... I'm constantly surprised by man\ Ameri
cans, many of whom are proud of their European roots, who know some
times more about Europe than many Europeans know about the U.S. . . .
German people have to learn that America is much more complicated than
many of them seem to think."
