## Viewpoint/Andrew Ellis Law School: a waste of talent 
### 
Last Thursday, Derek Bok, the
president of Harvard University, de
livered his annual report to the Board
of Overseers of Harvard College in
which he raised an issue which many
of us face at Stanford. In his address
Bok claimed that the nation is losing
too many of its brightest individuals
to the legal system, a system he criti
cised as "costly and often inaccessi
ble" to the poor and middle class.
The New York Times quoted Bok as
saying that the influx of the brightest
students into law schools could be
described as "a massive diversion of

The problem, as The New York Times correctly
pointed out last Saturday, is 'how can society begin
to reward other pursuits as handsomely as it does
lawr

exceptional talent into pursuits that
often add little to the growth of the
economy, the pursuit of culture or
the enhancement of the human
spirit." Bok sees the growth of our
"complicated, costly, and quixotic"
legal system as a tremendous social
burden, one that is ultimately un
productive as well as unjust. While a
discussion of the inaccessibility of
the legal system would be better left
to those in a position to debate it,
many undergraduates must consider
his assertion that too many gifted
students tend to drift towards the
profession of law.
For many of us, especially those in
the social sciences or general "liberal
arts," law school seems an almost
sure way of getting a job, or at least a

means of furthering one's education.
Regardless of whether or not these
are the correct attitudes to have in
thinking about attending law school,
these are the perceptions held by
many.
Inadvertently or not, Bok addres
sed the issue of how those of us in
terested in law school perceive the
marketplace and its opportunities.
Even though many of us would admit
our society is best fueled by an en
treprenurial spirit and that there are
more options for whatever skills we
possess than we recognize, a com

mon attitude seems to say, "That's
fine. But why don't you pursue your
project and I'll head on to law
school."
What worries Bok might be,
among other things, a realisation that
many undergraduates, even the
most talented ones, are not inclined
to take risks, to venture out into the
marketplace with an idea or skill
productive to society. Instead, many
decide on the path of least resistance
and risk, and this path often leads to
law school.
There are, of course, many other
things to do besides geta law degree.
With a little imagination, sense of ad
venture, and our $3 trillion a year
economy, it shouldn't be hard for
those who possess the qualifications

needed for law school to discover
their niche in the marketplace, an
area where they can use their skills to
take on what they enjoy and do best
in.
The problem, as The New York
Times correctly pointed out last
Saturday, is "how can society begin
to reward other pursuits as hand
somely as it does law?"
The first solution is to counter the
perception too many under
graduates retain, that one becomes
an engineer or goes to business,
medical or law school in order to
make the best use of his skills and
interest. This is easier said than
done, for the real world quickly
looming up on undergraduates,
especially those pursuing what many
educators advise, a "well-rounded,
liberal arts education," doesn't seem
to offer the kinds of options or op
portunities many of us want if we
don't have a marketable, profes
sional degree.
The legal profession, said Bok, "at
tracts an unusually large proportion
of the exceptionally gifted. Far too
many of these rare individuals are
becoming lawyers at a time when the
country cries out for more talented
business executives, more en
lightenend public servants, more in
ventive engineers, more able high
school principals and teachers."
While many would agree with this
statement, society, seen through the
eyes of many undergraduates,
doesn't seem to believe it.
