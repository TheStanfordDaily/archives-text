## Coffee House needs student support 
### 
Three years ago, on March 10,
1980, the ASSU submitted a bid
proposal to run the Coffee House at
Tresidder Union. After three years of
successful operation, manager Steve
Weiss will be leaving this May. Con
currently, the ASSU will be re
negotiating its Coffee House con
tract with Tresidder Union. At this
time it seems fitting, in fact essential,
that we assess the progress that has
been made and look to the future.
Without proper management at this
crucial juncture, this unique student
service may falter and fold.
As the founding president of the
Coffee House, Inc., I have remained
interested in its progress. Since
stepping down from my official posi
tion, I have worked in the Coffee
House and stopped in periodically to
check its growth.
Warning to everyone: do not take
the Coffee House for granted. The
collective student memory is short
(most students were not here when
the ASSU first took over), so let me
offer some history. The students
made a bid to run the Coffee House
because it was a terrible failure;
primarily a hangout for what ap
peared to be non-students and a
threatening, dreary, overpriced cof
fee shop with food offerings of li
mited variety and low quality.
The goal of the ASSU was to make
the Coffee House a prime student
gathering spot for talk, study, enter
tainment, good food and atmos
phere, to provide student jobs, offer
management experience and to give
the best possible service at the low
est possible price.
Steve Weiss was hi red by the ASSU
to serve as a full-time professional
manager. His challenge has been to

bring all of these goals to fruition.
With his assistant, Lou Catalano, en
thusiastic part-time and full-time
help, student support and coopera
tion from Tresidder Union, I believe
he has taken us remarkably close to
achieving our goals.
A quick checklist of the past and
present at the Coffee House proves
this point. Today there are more than
100 student employees (some serv
ing as night managers), a student-led
board of directors, and student-led
programming and advertising. The
old menu was drab amd expensive
and did not include today's fresh
ground coffee, import beer selec
tion, croissants, microwave items,
wine selection or numerous other
specialties. Service is more efficient
and friendly and the decor is far
superior. We have a new outdoor
patio where beer and wine may be
consumed. As for the goal of making
the Coffee House a student cent
er. . .you need only walk inside.
These changes came about
through hard work, creativity, and
commitment. Weiss deserves
praise, for he has proven truly re
markable in balancing student
wishes with the reality of a business.
The ASSU and Coffee House, Inc. of
ficers have putin many hours of work
and Tresidder Union, under Director
Ellie Oppenheim, has been especially
helpful to the Coffee House, acknow
ledging that it is unique among college
unions in the United States.
Where does all this lead us? Unfor
tunately, we are faced with an uncer
tain future. Not only must the Coffee
House weather a change in student
leadership, it must survive a change
in professional management. It is

alarming to hear that even with four
months notice, the ASSU has been
unable to hire a new manager. Also
lurking in the background is the
crisis of profitability, the roots of
which go back to the original group
which bid for the Coffee House. Our
goal was to break even and if there
was a profit, to pass that on to the
consumer in the form of better enter
tainment or lower prices.
Our mistake was to set a price
structure and labor cost (100 stu
dents in less than maximum effi
ciency) which has the Coffee House
fighting an uphill financial battle.
What is to be done? First, the ASSU
and Coffee House Beard must im
mediately find a new manager who
will be responsive to student needs
and capable of addressing financial
woes. Without this crucial person,
the Coffee House will flounder. Any
wild ideas of a student manager,
even for a short time, are foolish.
Second, a hard look must be taken at
the goals of the Coffee House vis-a
vis the costs involved. Only then can
the ASSU and the Coffee House
hope to keep it afloat. As students, it
is up to all of you to demand prompt
and effective management of one of
your prize student services. Student
involvement and professional sup
port made the Coffee House what it
is today. Only renewed student in
volvement and quality professional
will keep it growing.

The ASSU and Coffee House, Inc. of
ficers have putin many hours of work
and Tresidder Union, under Director
Ellie Oppenheim, has been especially
helpful to the Coffee House, acknow
ledging that it is unique among college
unions in the United States.
Where does all this lead us? Unfor
tunately, we are faced with an uncer
tain future. Not only must the Coffee
House weather a change in student
leadership, it must survive a change
in professional management. It is

alarming to hear that even with four
months notice, the ASSU has been
unable to hire a new manager. Also
lurking in the background is the
crisis of profitability, the roots of
which go back to the original group
which bid for the Coffee House. Our
goal was to break even and if there
was a profit, to pass that on to the
consumer in the form of better enter
tainment or lower prices.
Our mistake was to set a price
structure and labor cost (100 stu
dents in less than maximum effi
ciency) which has the Coffee House
fighting an uphill financial battle.
What is to be done? First, the ASSU
and Coffee House Beard must im
mediately find a new manager who
will be responsive to student needs
and capable of addressing financial
woes. Without this crucial person,
the Coffee House will flounder. Any
wild ideas of a student manager,
even for a short time, are foolish.
Second, a hard look must be taken at
the goals of the Coffee House vis-a
vis the costs involved. Only then can
the ASSU and the Coffee House
hope to keep it afloat. As students, it
is up to all of you to demand prompt
and effective management of one of
your prize student services. Student
involvement and professional sup
port made the Coffee House what it
is today. Only renewed student in
volvement and quality professional
will keep it growing.

Three years ago, on March 10,
1980, the ASSU submitted a bid
proposal to run the Coffee House at
Tresidder Union. After three years of
successful operation, manager Steve
Weiss will be leaving this May. Con
currently, the ASSU will be re
negotiating its Coffee House con
tract with Tresidder Union. At this
time it seems fitting, in fact essential,
that we assess the progress that has
been made and look to the future.
Without proper management at this
crucial juncture, this unique student
service may falter and fold.
As the founding president of the
Coffee House, Inc., I have remained
interested in its progress. Since
stepping down from my official posi
tion, I have worked in the Coffee
House and stopped in periodically to
check its growth.
Warning to everyone: do not take
the Coffee House for granted. The
collective student memory is short
(most students were not here when
the ASSU first took over), so let me
offer some history. The students
made a bid to run the Coffee House
because it was a terrible failure;
primarily a hangout for what ap
peared to be non-students and a
threatening, dreary, overpriced cof
fee shop with food offerings of li
mited variety and low quality.
The goal of the ASSU was to make
the Coffee House a prime student
gathering spot for talk, study, enter
tainment, good food and atmos
phere, to provide student jobs, offer
management experience and to give
the best possible service at the low
est possible price.
Steve Weiss was hi red by the ASSU
to serve as a full-time professional
manager. His challenge has been to

bring all of these goals to fruition.
With his assistant, Lou Catalano, en
thusiastic part-time and full-time
help, student support and coopera
tion from Tresidder Union, I believe
he has taken us remarkably close to
achieving our goals.
A quick checklist of the past and
present at the Coffee House proves
this point. Today there are more than
100 student employees (some serv
ing as night managers), a student-led
board of directors, and student-led
programming and advertising. The
old menu was drab amd expensive
and did not include today's fresh
ground coffee, import beer selec
tion, croissants, microwave items,
wine selection or numerous other
specialties. Service is more efficient
and friendly and the decor is far
superior. We have a new outdoor
patio where beer and wine may be
consumed. As for the goal of making
the Coffee House a student cent
er. . .you need only walk inside.
These changes came about
through hard work, creativity, and
commitment. Weiss deserves
praise, for he has proven truly re
markable in balancing student
wishes with the reality of a business.
