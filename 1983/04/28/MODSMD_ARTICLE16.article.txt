## Fes Liarstein, All-American 
### 
Fes Liarstein takes a sip of coffee
and eases his fingertips over the ink
smudged keys of his Smith-Corona.
A snail of sweat crawls between Liars
tein's eyebrows which form an arrow
that points to his nose. There is
something very beautiful about Liars
tein; perched at his typewriter he
looks as I imagine Beethoven must
have looked as he was sitting at his
piano on the verge of composing the
9th.
The crowd is silent; not a beer is
sipped, not a breath is taken. Eighty
thousand fans have become 80,000
statues, each bust nervously an
ticipating Liarstein's next move.
Liarstein sweats some more and
chews on the end of a pencil. The
typewriter simply hums; it can wait
all day. Liarstein's face is etched with
panic. He bites through the pencil,
then smashes his hand firmly down
on the virgin plastic keyboard. He is
angry, he is frustrated, he looks al
most suicidal. The disappointed
crowd settles en masse back into
their seats. It's obvious what the
problem is. Liarstein has writer's
block.
The Band looks dejected. Two Dol
lies are crying and the Stanford danc
ing tree is limp. Liarstein's coaches
are shaking their heads. His
Medieval Literature teacher looks
white as a corpse. Liarstein vehe
mently flicks off the power on his
typewriter — it has betrayed him.
Then Liarstein, too, starts to weep
softly.
He calls for a time out. Liarstein
presses the palms of his hands
against his eye sockets. Two trainers
come out. "Are you okay, Fes? Do
you need a drink? Maybe we should
tape up your wrists? Do you want a
replacement?" Liarstein heroically
resists the pitiful offers of assistance.
Instead he wipes off his brow, mum
bles a quick prayer, and then flicks
the power back on his Smith-
Corona. There is a boxer's look of
determination behind Liarstein's
horn-rims, and the crowd is once
again ignited.
Then Liarstein,grinning theinsane
grin of a mass-murderer, starts to
type. He types at a furious pace. He
types. And he types. And he types.

The 80,000 statues come back to
life. In fact they're jumping around
like moths in a lantern. The Band un
leashes its most forceful rendition of
"All Right Now" ever. The Dollies
look like they've all just won the lot
tery. The dancing tree is uprooted as
if by a tornado. Liarstein has done it
again. He has shown them all — for
the Nth time — why Liarstein is No. 1.
I saw Liarstein in the locker room
after he wrote that story, and the
scene there was probably one you'd
expect. Coaches were patting Fes on
the behind, his colleagues (Milton
Friedman et al.) were giving Fes the
"High Five," and busty coeds were
lined up like bums by a soup kitchen,
just waiting to get at best eye contact
with the great Fes Liarstein. Fes was
smiling, dropping clever metaphors
to reporters like steaks to pirhana,
and after a few more minutes of bask
ing in his glory, Fes secluded himself
in the men's room. I caught Fes' eye
before he vanished, and in that
flashbulb instant I saw another Fes
Liarstein. Like many superstars Fes
Liarstein leads two lives.
Most of us know only one Fes
Liarstein. There's the Fes we read
about in the daily papers: ranked No.
1 in the NCAA Journalist's Poll,
ranked No. 1 by the APand UPI polls,
four-year captain of Stanford's No. 1
varsity journalism team, good
looking, charming, modest, and
above all, still "one of the guys."
But there is another, more tragic
Fes Liarstein. I mean Fes Liarstein The
Victim. Who has victimized Liars
tein? Stanford University has vic
timized him. So have I, and so, prob
ably, have you. All of us who have
read and enjoyed Fes' columns, all of
us have driven nails into his coffin.
You and I are accessories to a very
ugly crime.
Fes' good friend John Elway said
this recently: "Fes is an amazing guy,
he can really do it all. He can write
parody, he can write drama. He can
write philosophy, and he can write
just to entertain. Whenever Thurs
day's Dailys were laid out, Fes always
had the most inches. What's sad,
though is that the guy can't throw a
ball for his life."

And that just about says it all. We
— Fes' supposed "fans" — we rape
him for his intellect, we exploit him
to write for our newspapers and for
our magazines, and we don't even
give a damn about teaching the guy
to play a sport.
Stanford outfielder Daryll
Stephens had this to add: "Sure
Liarstein has the literary long ball,
but when it comes to sports . . . the
guy thinks that home plate is some
thing you eat off of. There's no doubt
that the man is hung between the
ears, but what good is a genius is he's
completely physically uncoordi
nated?"
It's true. Liarstein has flourished as
a journalist here, but come June —
then where's Liarstein going to be?
He'll make $15,000, maybe $20,000 a
year as a writer, but if we hadn't neg
lected him athletically, the man
could easily rake in $50,000 to
$100,000 a year upon graduation.
But that's only part of the Liarstein
tragedy. There's the Liarstein phone,
always ringing, anytime he's not talk
ing to his agent or yet another tact
less reporter. There's the constant
pressure to choose the right career;
will it be the NPWL (National Poetry
Writers League), the NNWL (Na
tional Novel Writers League) or the
SCA (Syndicated Columnists Associ
ation)?
Then there are the unrelenting au
tograph hounds and the mic
rophones that constantly surround
Liarstein's overburdened head like a
crown of thorns.
So where does Fes go when he just
wants to be alone with his thoughts
and be Fes Liarstein? Nowhere.
There is no place where Fes can be
alone; and this is your fault as well as
mine. You and I have made Fes the
Man Without a Planet.
Elway told me that if he could
throw a ball the way Liarstein writes,
"Then I'd be in pretty darn good
shape." "But heck," Stanford's other
Ail-American continued, "who
needs the pressure." There's a les
son to be learned here.
