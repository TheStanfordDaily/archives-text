## Senate has a role in political issues 
### 
I would like to take exception to
your editorial of April 25"The —"The se
nate's proper role." In this editorial,
the Daily editorial board argues that
the ASSU Senate, in considering a
"political" issue, overstepped the
bounds of its authority. The board
argues that the decision to endorse a
resolution on nuclear weapons re
search was not given proper consid
eration, as it was forced through an
ill-informed senate.
First of all, each and every senator
had one full week to consider the
resolution — each received a packet
containing newspaper articles (in
cluding Daily pieces) relevant to the
issue and a copy of the Department
of Energy funding proposal filed for
the project at the Stanford Synchrot
ron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL).
Each senator received the full packet
of information. In normal proce
dure, legislation is routed through
one of the various committees. The
senators sitting on these committees
receive the pertinent information.
When the legislation comes to the
floor in the normal process, most
senators see only a small sampling of
background information.
The resolution was not put
through committee because an
"emergency" situation was believed
to exist. The University committee
that deals with research applications
was scheduled to meet on April 20,
the day after the Senate met to con
sider the resolution. The director of
SSRL had announced that he would
make his decision a week after the
committee's recommendation was
announced. The resolution was

"rushed" to the floor to preserve the
relevency of the statement. It was
meant to be a statement of opposi
tion, not an epitaph. In this sense, I
suppose that I, as the sponsor of the
resolution, "rushed" the matter by
not delaying it for the two weeks that
would intervene before the next se
nate meeting. The timeline, how
ever, did not allow me to route the
resolution through committee.
I would like to address a more im
portant issue. Should any student
group take stands on issues of a
"political" nature? I argue that a re
fusal to deal with these questions is
tantamount to burying one's head in
the sand. While we have the
privilege of being protected from
most of the nefarious influences of
the outside world at Stanford, some
times reality raises its ugly head. Nuc
lear weapons are everybody's busi
ness because the consequences of
using them will affect everyone —
regardless of whether you are a Daily
staffer, a student politician or an
SSRL researcher.
Is the ASSU Senate the proper
place to argue the so-called "moral"
or "political'' issue? There is room
for debate on either side. My view, as
someone involved in the process, is
that the senate is the "final represen
tative authority of the student body"
(Article 2 of the ASSU Constitution).
As such, the senate certainly must be
able to make statements on issues of
student concern. The senate cer
tainly cannot speak for all of the stu
dents at Stanford or even a majority
of them. It can, however, speak for a
significant portion—those students

who signed the petitions opposing
the SSRL project.
I also must add that the senate
does not see itself as the "trustee" of
student opinion — consensus poli
tics have never been an effect gov
erning strategy — but it is a represen
tative body elected to enact legisla
tion that affects all students.
The ASSU Senate is a political
body. Every decision it makes is polit
ical by the very nature of the organi
zation! I cannot agree with your ar
gument that the senate should con
cern itself with bake sales and shuttle
services and leave political issues to
newspaper editorial boards. The se
nate is an organization that is, at its
best, responsive to student needs
and concerns.
Vou made an important distinction
in your editorial, however. The se
nate would be ridiculous to go to the
lengths of endorsing presidential
candidates — it would have no cre
dibility in that area. The senate does
have some credibility in the area of
student-related issues. That, I be
lieve, is the reason that you featured
the article on the senate's resolution
against the SSRL project on your
front page.

ASSU Senator
McCloskey class
Pete McCloskey's cheap attack on
Seth Linfield, (Daily, April 18), is
merely a device to shift attention
from his apparently poor showing as
ASSU Guest Professor. ("Apathy

Surprises McCloskey", Daily, April
4). Unfortunately, his attitude is all
too reminiscent of the Nixonian phi
losophy of "Attack, attack, attack.
Never defend."
Poor attendance should be noth
ing new to McCloskey. According to
the authoritative Congressional
Quarterly, in 1982 while busy with his
Senate campaign, McCloskey
showed up for just 57 percent of
House floor votes. Only two Califor
nia Congressmen had worse re
cords. In 1981 while not running for
the Senate, McCloskey again
showed up just 57 percent of the
time. He was the most absent
Californian and the most absent Re
publican. Of all the 535 members of
the House and Senate, our resident
expert on Congressional Decision
making ranked 533 rd in attendance!
For the five years prior to that,
McCloskey escaped the bottom third
of the California delegation in atten
dance just once.
McCloskey's record, of course,
does not justify poor student atten
dance. Indeed, an examination of
McCloskey's role in Congress would
be most enlightening. Perhaps stu
dents will discover why McCloskey
supported cutbacks in the Legal Ser
vices Corporation and student finan
cial aid, supported Selective Service
registration, and tried to repeal Vot
ing Rights Act protections for His
panics and Asian Americans.
In short, McCloskey ought to con
centrate on the syllabus rather than
the blunderbuss attacks on Linfield.
