# Donors offer variety of non-cash gifts
## 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
Ever since Jane Stanford was hard
up for cash and gave her jewels to the
University to set up a book fund, the
University has received a variety of
non-money gifts — from art objects
to oil fields.
These non-money gifts fall into
four major categories: books, works
of art, real estate, and scientific and
technological equipment, according
to David Fulton, communications di
rector at the Office of Development.
Among the long list of gifts re
ceived by the University in January
were an $11,000 polo pony given to
the Athletic Department, four mic
rocomputer systems, valued at
$16,000, donated to the School of
Education, and a $50,000 Rodin torso
of a woman, now at the Stanford

Museum.
Fulton said gifts come from both
individuals and corporations, and
some of these donors wish to remain
anonymous. Although most non
monetary donations are designated
for particular departments, others
are donated to the University in gen
eral.
According to Allan Lee, manager of
Real Estate Investment Properties,
the University owns a large variety of
real estate. "You name it, we've got
them. Everything from graveyard
plots to industrial properties," he
said.
Lee said he hesitated to give any
estimates on the total number of
properties owned by the University
or on their total monetary value be
cause such statistics are too variable.
Anne Werry, in Minerals Administ

ration Investments, also said that
such statistics are too difficult to cal
culate.
"It's not that we're trying to be
mysterious. . . .It's just that the Uni
versity owns so many fragmented
percentages of various estates, that
it's impossible to describe them
other than in general terms," she
said.
However, Werry is "delighted to
say that Stanford has marvelous
wealth as a result of donors of vari
ous estates."
The University aKo recpivps nun
eral gifts in the form of gold and
silver mining claims, as well as oil and
gas properties, Werry said.
Along with the wide range of phys
ical gifts, the University earns royalty
interest on a wide range of its proper
ties. "Sometimes royalty checks
come in for $1 for a whole year's roy
alty or for thousands of dollars for
each month's royalty," Werry said.
According to Lee, the University
strives to maximize real estate pro
fits. "Like any individual who owns
an asset, we have no particular com
pulsions — we do whatever will
make Stanford the most money," he
said.
Although this sometimes entails
converting real estate to cash by sale,
Werry said the University does not

sell its mineral rights. "Because
natural resources are so much in
demand and will continue to be for
the rest of our lifetimes, you just
know they'll be valuable," she said.
Thus even if deposits are not dis
covered immediately, the University
retains its mineral properties. Werry
said the University's ownership con
ditions are ideal. "We have land that
we lease to various oil companies
. . . we put no money into it and end
up creating revenue from it. It's a
fascinating business," she said.
Although Stanford's most profita
ble estates are located in Kern
County, California, near Bakersfield,
the University also owns property in
Montana, Oklahoma, North Dakota,
Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Col
orado and Wyoming.
According to Werry, the University
also owns approximately 12 joint in
terest properties with UC-Berkeley
and other institutions, including
Children's Hospital in San Francisco.
Lee said it is impossible to rank
gifts given to the University in terms
of usefulness or value. "There are no
first, second and third most useful
gifts. . . .You can't compare a piece
of art to a computer. You can't assign
values between them, because both
are extremely important to a univer
sity," he concluded.
