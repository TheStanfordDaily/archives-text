## Bob Seger: rock and for the working class man 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Bob Seeger
Cow Palace
April lb, 1983

There are numerous artists who, having
initiated their careers on the basis of hard
and dedicated work, have floundered
upon reaching success. Many, once hav
ing made it to the top, discarded their pre
vious ideals and reacted the work ethic.
Having done so, such artists (e.g. Rod
Stewart) were no longer willing to give 100
percent for each performance or record
ing. For them, success meant uninspired
pertormances and a general diminishment
of talent.
On the other hand, many who attained
this dream of "roc k star" were apt to fall
into a disillisioned trap of invincibility. For
these, their new-tound success was cause
for an overindulgence in drugs and drink.
In the cases of such talented performers as
Jimi or )anis loplin, these exces
ses led to such a gradual deterioration of
health, musical ability and inspiration that
death resulted.
Although many artists fall victim to the
false riches of success, there are many
who balance the laurels of success more
realistically. Such performers as Bruce
Springsteen, Tom Petty and The Clash,
who, after struggling for years, have still
kept the same ideals and views toward
their music in spite of their success. For
these performers, rock and roll is a chal

lenge to define success on (heir own
terms. It means creating innovative music,
and it means giving the tans more than
their money's worth in live performances.
One ot the more obvious performers
who falls into this tradition is Bob Seger
and his Silver Bullet Band. Seger, a work
ing boy from Detroit, spent 10 years on the
road before capturing the public's recog
nition. However, just as one of the titles of
his songs states, "rock and roll never
forgets," Seger has never forgotten his
roots or the reasons for his success. He
embodies the American work ethicand his
last album, The Distance, is the definitive
statement on the inner turmoils one must
undergo to keep this rock and roll work
ethic alive. His recent concert at the Cow
Palace was an unfaltering portrayal of the
uplifting and transcendent powers of rock
and roll. It was a show that emphasized
rock's positive virtues for the common
man, and for two hours, Seger delivered
his brand of pure, unadulterated musical
satisfaction.
Coming out with atypically short hair,
Seger swore his allegiance to rock's blue
collar workers by belting out "Feel Like a
Number" as the opening song. With such
lines as, "To workers I'm just another
drone/To Ma Bell I'm just another phone/
I'm just another statistic on a sheet. . .But
I'm not a number/Dammit, I'm a man,"
Seger, with his extremely expressive and
powerfully throaty voice, firmly com
municated his ties to the plight of the

common man.
It was Seger's intention, however, to
remove these plights and woes in his rol
licking, R&B-based show. Whether it was
such joytul funky dance tunes as "Old
Time Rock and Roll," strictly '50s-derived
rockers like "Betty Lou's Getting Out To
night," or soul-searching ballads like
"Mainstreet," Seger always managed to
move the crowd from within. Very few ar
tists could equally capture and shape the
fluidity of the crowd, but Seger very craf
tily used his musical insight to balance
all-out rockers with slow, delicate ballads
for the utmost effect.
Overall, Seger chose songs from all
periods of his career. Interspersed among
his more recent hits, Seger reached back
to include such classics as his 1%8 organ
flavored hit, "Ramblin' Gamblin' Man,"
and 1972's "Turn the Page" (which deals
with the hardships of life on the road). On
all of them, Seger proved himself to be a
versatile musician. Seger played much
more guitar than he has done in the past
(his lead on "Her Strut" was the meanest
licks the whole night), and he dabbled on
piano as well. The Silver Bullet Band (with
the hip-shaking, tambourine-slapping
Silver Bullet Girls providing harmony voc
als), though, showed themselves to be an
extremely solid and energetic outfit in the
vein of the E Street Band. Their frolicsome
activity on stage only added to Seger's
rapport with the crowd.
