# University rejects merit-based aid

### TROY EID Staff writer 
Despite recent decisions by other prestigious schools
to offer merit scholarships based solely on academic
performance, Stanford will continue its "need-based"
financial aid program.
"Awards made to students here are based on financial
need," said Robert Huff, director of financial aid. "We
are clearly committed to meeting the needs of students
. . . We review (admissions) applications without even
seeing how much aid each student requires."
According to Time magazine, about 900 U.S. schools
are offering merit scholarships this year, up from 420 in
1977. Recently Smith and Mou nt Holyoke became two of
the latest followers of this trend when they began to
offer financial rewards to prospective students with high
grade point averages and SAT scores.
A growing consortium of colleges and universities
offers similar merit scholarships, including the Univer

sity of Chicago, the University of Michigan, Duke Uni
versity and Brandeis University.
Huff said that some smaller colleges may attract "a few
top-notch students" with financial rewards in hopes that
those students will attract others like them. "This is
clearly not the case at Stanford," he said, noting that the
University has not offered merit scholarships "for
maybe 20 years."
Vince De Anda, associate director of financial aids,
said some schools offering merit scholarships could be
"trying to buy the best students" because they "might
have problems" attracting applicants.
"Most of the time our kind of students manage to go
where they want regardless of financial aid," De Anda
said. He pointed out that many students also apply to
schools like Harvard and Vale, institutions that have "the
same kind of policies" as Stanford's need-based aid
program.
