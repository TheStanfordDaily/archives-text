# Monetary gifts suffer $2.5 million decline

### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER 
Along with numerous art works,
books, pieces of technical equip
ment and plots of land, the Univer
sity receives large sums of money
each year.
However, Stanford dropped to
third place from its usual second
place in the rankings of 1981-82 gift
support among universities because
of a large increase in monetary gifts
received by Yale.
Harvard, with a gift total of $181
million, remained on top of the list
compiled by the Council for Finan
cial Aid to Education.
David Fulton, communications di
rector ot the Office of Development,
said he is not troubled by the Univer
sity's $2.5 million decline in gifts —
trom $79.5 million in 1980-81 to $77
million last vear — and correspond
ing drop to third place.
"We had a pretty good year if you
look at Stanford by itself," he said.
And we're doing even better this
yf.ar."

Yale's monetary' gifts increased by
.ilmost $24 million from '80-'81 to '81-
82. Last year supporters donated $82
million, beating out Stanford by $5
million.
"We've traditionally been second
tor almost the last 20 years," Fulton
said. "Once in a great while ihere's
been a shift in that," he continued,
when Yale has a particularly good
year.
Asked if the decline in Stanford's
gift support was related to the fact
that Joel Smith left his position as
vice-president for development in
October 1981, Fulton said, "I think
it's probably o mistake to draw a
cause and effect relationship over
that short a time."
Filling out the top 10 in gift support
were UCLA, Washington University,
USC, Minnesota. Cornell, Columbia
and Princeton.
The total amount of monetary gifts
given to universities rose nearly 15
percent last year.
