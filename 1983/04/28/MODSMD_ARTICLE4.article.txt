# Stanford West project
## University requests delay from Palo Alto Council 
### TYLER OCHOA 
The University yesterday asked the Palo Alto City
Council to postpone its final consideration of the Stan
ford West faculty and staff housing project.
In a letter sent to Palo Alto Mayor Betsy Bechtel today,
University Director of Real Fstate Frank Morrow said, "A
few issues of impoi jnce . . . will require more time to
be resolved." He asked that the council postpone the
item "to a date of (its) earliest convenience."
The council's final action on Stanford West's en
vironmental impact report originally was scheduled to
take place on May 2. But because the council's agenda is
full for several weeks, it is unlikely that the item will be
reconsidered before the first week in June.
According to University Director of Community Rela
tions Andy Doty, the University requested the continua
tion because Stanford representatives are still negotiat
ing changes in the plan with city staff members. The
changes are designed to lessen the projected impacts
and address the concerns of the project's opponents.
"The hope was that we could arrive at a packet ol
conclusions in time for the City Council (deadline),"
Doty said, "but we concluded yesterday that there were
a couple of ma|or issues remaining and that it would be
impossible."

Doty declined to state which aspects of the plan were
holding up the negotiations, but he emphasized that
progress is being made.
"We're making good headway â€” I think we a'l agree
on that," he said.
City C ouncilman Larry Klein was cautious in his reac
tion to the delay. "I'm pleased that meaningful discus
sions are underway," Klein said. "Whether the con
tinuance is helpful or not depends on the outcome of
those discussions."
The Stanford West housing project consists of 127 r )
housing units to be built on 4b acres north of Willow
Road and an additional 194 units to be built on 4 3 acres
on Welch Road. The project has generated much con
troversy because it is opposed by the Menlo Park resi
dents who live across San Francisquito Creek from the
site.
Some of the concerns which have been voiced about
the project include the high density of units, increased
traffic problems, lack of adequate open space and the
aft'ordability of the units.
Because Stanford West was the only item on next
week's agenda, the council's scheduled meeting was
canceled.
