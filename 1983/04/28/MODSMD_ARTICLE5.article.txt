# Caterpillars, moths invade campus trees
## 
### JASON COLE Staff writer 
They appear on campus every
spring, but this year they seem to be
infesting more trees, hair, clothes
and mouths than usual. Technically
they are known as oak moths, but
they are better known as "disgusting
little bugs' or "gross hanging
things."
At this stage in their development,
oak moths are the caterpillars that
hang from — and eat the leaves of —
oak trees all over campus. They are a
traditional source ot student com
plaint.
In response, the University is
spraying around campus to prevent
unsightly caterpillar infestation.
Grounds supervisor Don Piana said,
"We want to prevent them from
messing up the campus. . . . We're
trying to get ahead ot it."
The University is spraying various
sections where the moths have hit
worst so far, Piana said. Infested
areas include the trees by Crothers
Memorial, Annenburg Auditorium
and Hoover Tower.
Operations and maintenance is
using two kinds of pesticides de
signed specifically for the moths. The
sprayed onto the leaves
of the trees, kill the moths while they
eat. "It (the spray) is only harmful to
the moths. Students needn't worry,"
Piana said

But, despite the harmlessness of
the pesticides, students are being
warned to keep windows and cars
shut during spraying hours. "It won't
do any harm to the cars, but the
spraying is pretty messy and we'd
like to prevent that (getting car in
teriors messy) as much as possible,"
Piana explained.
lames Horgan, director of Opera
tions and Maintenance, concurred:
"We really trv to be considerate of
residents and academia." He
explained that warnings are sent not
only to residents but also to depart
ments to make sure the spraying
won't harm any experiments.
The spraying, according to Hor
gan, will cost about $3000, which in
cludes some outside contracting
with private pesticide firms. The out
side contracting is necessary be
cause the University does not have
enough internal manpower to do all
the spraying.
The philosophy of Operations and
Maintenance is normally to avoid
using chemicals or pesticides of any
kind, Horgan said. For instance, the
University does not use any weed kil
lers, and pulls the weeds out instead.
"We just don't want any poisonous
or harmful substances in the campus
environment," he said.
An exception is being made for the
oak moth spraying, Piana said, be
cause the pesticides being used have
been deemed harmless- to humans.
