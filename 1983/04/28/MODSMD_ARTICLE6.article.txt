Reagan makes El Salvador appeal
Washington —President Reagan told a joint session
of Congress yesterday night that the national security
of aH the \mericas is at stake in the troubled nations
of cen\ral America and called for bipartisan support in
helping democratic governments resist leftist in
surgency there.
Portraying the situation in strife-torn El Salvador
and Nicaragua as a Soviet-backed effort "to
destabilize the entire region from the Panama Canal
to Mexico," the president held fast to his proposals
for stepped up economic and military aid to the
Salvadoran government despite recent rebuffs in
Congress.
Just one day before Reagan took the unusual step

of going before the joint session, he had seen a House
subcommittee cut in half his request to transfer $60
million in already appropriated military aid funds to El
Salvador. The administration also faces a probable
congressional effort to restrict U. S. assistance to
forces fighting the Sandanista government in
Nicaragua.
"I say to you tonight there can be no question,"
Reagan declared yesterday,"the national security of
all the Americas is at stake in Centra! America.
"If we cannot defend ourselves there, we cannot
expect to prevail elsewhere. Our credibility would
collapse, our alliances would crumble, and the safety
of our homeland would be put at jeopardy."
Specifically, he called upon the lawmakers to ap
provetho 1984 Centra! Ampricanaid requests totaling

about $600 million, telling them the U. S. assistance
package for this crucial area of the world "is less than
one-tenth of what Americans will spend this year on
c oin-operated video games.
"What I am asking for is prompt congressional ap
proval for the full reprogramming of funds for key
current economic and security programs so that the
people of Central America can hold the line against
externally supported aggression."
He also called for speedy congressional action on
the rest of ,1 special aid oackage sent to Congress near
ly two months ago.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, (D-Conn.), in a hard-hit
ting Democratic response to President Reagan's
speech to Congress yesterday night, strongly sug
gested that the administration vvas leading the nation

into another Vietnam-type quagmire in Central
America.
Dodd, speaking on national television after Rea
gan's address, said in his prepared text:
"Instead of trying to do something about the fac
tors which breed revolution, this administration has
turned to massive military buildups at a cost of hun
dreds of millions of dollars. Its policy is ever-increas
ing military assistance, endless military training, even
hiring our own paramilitary guerrillas. This is a for
mula for failure.
"And," Dodd added in a clear comparison to past
U S. involvement in Vietnam, "it is a proven prescrip
tion for picking a loser. The American people know
that we have been down this road before — and that it
