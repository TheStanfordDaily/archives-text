Reagan makes El Salvador appeal
Washington —President Reagan told a joint session
of Congress yesterday night that the national security
of aH the \mericas is at stake in the troubled nations
of cen\ral America and called for bipartisan support in
helping democratic governments resist leftist in
surgency there.
Portraying the situation in strife-torn El Salvador
and Nicaragua as a Soviet-backed effort "to
destabilize the entire region from the Panama Canal
to Mexico," the president held fast to his proposals
for stepped up economic and military aid to the
Salvadoran government despite recent rebuffs in
Congress.
Just one day before Reagan took the unusual step

of going before the joint session, he had seen a House
subcommittee cut in half his request to transfer $60
million in already appropriated military aid funds to El
Salvador. The administration also faces a probable
congressional effort to restrict U. S. assistance to
forces fighting the Sandanista government in
Nicaragua.
"I say to you tonight there can be no question,"
Reagan declared yesterday,"the national security of
all the Americas is at stake in Centra! America.
"If we cannot defend ourselves there, we cannot
expect to prevail elsewhere. Our credibility would
collapse, our alliances would crumble, and the safety
of our homeland would be put at jeopardy."
Specifically, he called upon the lawmakers to ap
provetho 1984 Centra! Ampricanaid requests totaling

about $600 million, telling them the U. S. assistance
package for this crucial area of the world "is less than
one-tenth of what Americans will spend this year on
c oin-operated video games.
"What I am asking for is prompt congressional ap
proval for the full reprogramming of funds for key
current economic and security programs so that the
people of Central America can hold the line against
externally supported aggression."
He also called for speedy congressional action on
the rest of ,1 special aid oackage sent to Congress near
ly two months ago.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, (D-Conn.), in a hard-hit
ting Democratic response to President Reagan's
speech to Congress yesterday night, strongly sug
gested that the administration vvas leading the nation

into another Vietnam-type quagmire in Central
America.
Dodd, speaking on national television after Rea
gan's address, said in his prepared text:
"Instead of trying to do something about the fac
tors which breed revolution, this administration has
turned to massive military buildups at a cost of hun
dreds of millions of dollars. Its policy is ever-increas
ing military assistance, endless military training, even
hiring our own paramilitary guerrillas. This is a for
mula for failure.
"And," Dodd added in a clear comparison to past
U S. involvement in Vietnam, "it is a proven prescrip
tion for picking a loser. The American people know
that we have been down this road before — and that it
only leads to a dark tunnel of endless intervention."
The senator said that all Americans oppose the es
tablishment of Marxist states in Central America, and
will not accept the creation of Soviet military bases in
the region. And, he said, "We are fully prepared to
defend our security and the security of the Americas,
if necessary, by military means."
Begin warns of Syrian buildup
Jerusalem —Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin told Secretary of State George Shultz yesterday
that Syria is staging a massive military buildup aided
by a $1.5 billion infusion of sophisticated Soviet
equipment and 4000 Soviet military advisers.
The Israeli charges were made when Shultz met
with Begin on the first leg of a shuttle mission be
tween Jerusalem and Beirut. Shultz is seeking to con
clude successfully the four-month negotiations on an
agreement for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
Lebanon.
U.S. officials accompanying Shultz said he initially
reacted to the Israeli charges — which were given in a
detailed briefing by Israel's chief of military in
telligence — by saying that Syrian activities were "a
source of concern."
In private, the officials said the United States had
not yet had time to assess the Israeli data and check it
against U.S. intelligence reports.
As a result, they added, it was not immediately clear
whether Begin's presentation was an indication of
genuine Israeli concern about a threat from Syria ora
diversionary tactic aimed at winning U.S. sympathy at
the outset of anticipated hard bargaining over the
Lebanon withdrawal question.
Some details of the presentation by Maj. Gen. Ehud
Barak had been leaked to the Israeli press prior to
Shultz's arrival yesterday. Some sources said Begin's
decision to stress the matter so strongly in his meeting
with Shultz was an attempt to use the heavy press at
tention being accorded Shultz's Middle East trip as a
means of getting the Israeli concerns publicized wide
ly in the United States.
The Israelis charged that the Soviets have helped
Syrian President Hafez Assad to rebuild his forces
through massive replacement of tanks and jet aircraft
destroyed by the Israelis during the fighting in Leba
non last summer. In addition, the Israelis contended,
Soviet advisers are operating advanced, SA-5 ground
to-air missile batteries within Syria and are operating
sophisticated electronic warfare equipment for the
Syrians.
Until now, the official U.S. position toward the al
leged Syrian buildup has been to say that the United
States has heard reports of extensive troop move
ments within Syria but has been unable to confirm
them.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who conferred
with Shultz in Cairo yesterday, is reported to have told
the secretary that a military buildup is underway in
Syria but that it is aimed at putting pressure on Israel
to withdraw from Lebanon.
Hinton to leave El Salvador
San Salvador — Declaring he is "weary" after two
years as U.S. ambassador here, Deane Hinton said he
is "one of those who think (the Salvadoran war) is
going to go on for quite a while yet."
Hinton also said that cleaning up the military's hu
man-rights abuses, a source of much U.S. con
gressional opposition to aid for the Salvadoran gov
ernment, is "a question in my view of years," perhaps
a decade or more until there can be what the U.S. en
voy called "a generational change" in the officer
corps.

On the eve of the speech by President Reagan to a
joint session of Congress defending his Central Amer
ica policy, Hinton pictured the conflict here as one
that has been stretched out largely by Washington's
stinginess with "resources" and by Nicaraguan sup
port for the rebels.
"I have said for two years we need resources," Hin
ton told a pair of reporters. "They've come too little,
too late."
The revolutionary Sandinista regime in nearby
Nicaragua has "a great deal to say about how long (the
war) goes on," Hinton added. But he said there is not
yet enough evidence to determine whether counter
revolutionaries fighting Sandinistas in Nicaragua have
had any impact on rebel arm supplies here. The stated
purpose of U.S. support for the "contras" is the "in
terdiction" of such shipments.
Hinton, 60, has been the Reagan administration's
point man in El Salvador since June 1981. He has ex
traordinary influence here, even in the context of a
region traditionally dominated by U.S. interests.
Many diplomats and Salvadoran officials credit Hin
ton with personally stopping a takeover of the gov
ernment by right-wing ex-military leader Roberto
D'Aubuisson a year ago when D'Aubuisson put to
gether a majority coalition in the then newly elected
Constituent Assembly. A centrist civilian, Alvaro
Magana, was named instead as interim president.
Hinton portrayed recent developments in the gov
ernment here as generally favorable to U.S. policy. He
praised Magana effusively and said it will be too bad
when he is no longer president, after elections at the
end of the year. The only "downside" of Magana
coming to power, Hinton said, was that "one had to
resort to the military" to put him in office in April
1982. With Hinton tellingthemacutoffofvital U.S. aid
would be likely if D'Aubuisson had become presi
dent, the high command finally presented Magana as
the only choice the assembly could name that they
would accept.
Andropov for space weapons ban
Moscow — Soviet leader Yuri Andropov called yes
terday for an international agreement to ban the use
of space weapons, saying "a crucial moment is really
coming" to halt plans for transferring the arms race
into outer space.
"Either the interested states will sit down at the ne
gotiating table without delay to begin drawing up a
treaty prohibiting the deployment in space of weap
ons of any kind, orthe arms race will go overalso into
space," Andropov said.
The Soviet leader's remarks were contained in his
reply to a telegram he received from a group of prom
inent Americans calling for a ban on space weapons.
The government news agency Tass said the tele
gram included signatures of Nobel prize laureates 1.1.
Rabi and Hans Bethe, retired Adm. Noel Gayler,
former head of the National Security Agency, Christ
opher Kraft, former director of the Johnson Space
Center, Richard Garvin of the Watson Research Cen
ter, Vice Adm. John Lee (Ret.) and such prominent
scientists Wolfgang Panofsky, George Rathjens, Carl
Sagan and Herbert York.
Tass said the authors of the telegram appealed to
Andropov and to President Reagan "to come to
terms" on a pact banning the deployment of any kind
of weapon in outer space as well as prohibiting "the
damaging or destruction of the satellites of any state."
Such a pact, they were quoted as saying, would be "in
the interest of all mankind."
The authors were also quoted as saying that the
United States was preparing tests of an advanced anti
satellite system and "that once such systems of weap
ons appear in the arsenals of countries it would be

very difficult to phase them out."
Although Andropov in his reply underscored Sovi
et readiness to negotiate a ban on space weapons, his
warning that time was running out appeared de
signed to make it clear that the Soviet Union intended
to match new U.S. space weapons systems
Feinstein applauds victory
San Francisco —Mayor Dianne Feinstein said yes
terday her resounding defeat of a recall movement
led by radical dissidents will refute detractors who
dwell on the city's reputation for political eccentrici
ty-
The mayor, on her way to winning 80 percent of the
ballots in a special election Tuesday, told an en
thusiastic crowd of supporters election night the big
vote represented "a mandate to say to the world that
San Francisco is indeed an island of sanity."
In her office the next morning, Feinstein called the
election results "stupendous — far beyond our ex
pectations."
"This election should very clearly speak to the im
age of the city .... It considerably mutes the de
tractors, whoever they may be."
In all, about 46 percent of the city's 354,000 voters
cast ballots. With only a few votes left to be counted,
the recall was being defeated 127,043 to 29,269.
Feinstein, waging a vigorous campaign for mail-in
votes to counter the traditionally small turnout in spe
cial elections, received a huge majority of a record
56,000 absentee ballots cast.
She lost only one precinct in the city — and that by
one vote. The precinct is in a Haight-Ashbury district
where the White Panther party, the small activist
group that led the recall drive, maintains its head
quarters.
And as it turned out, the number who voted "yes"
on the recall was smaller than the number that signed
the petitions that forced the recall election in the first
place.
"Looks like we got edged out," Thomas Stevens,
the Panthers' leader, said good-humoredly as he dis
cussed the election yesterday.
Stevens attributed Feinstein's victory in part to her
ability to focus news media attention on the propriety
of the recall movement itself, rather than on her
sponsorship of an ordinance banning handguns from
the city an ordinance that was struck down in court
and never went into effect. The Panthers collected
more than 34,000 signatures on recall petitions charg
ing Feinstein violated the constitutional right to bear
arms.
The White Panthers, a self-described Communist
group operating from the Haight-Ashbury, has
achieved new prominence in the press during the re
call campaign, adding again to the city's reputation
for political volatility.
Reagan criticizes leaks
New York —President Reagan told the American
Newspaper Publishers Association yesterday that
leaks of classified information to the news media dur
ing his administration have been "very serious" and
have endangered U.S. relations with anothercountry
"I really am pretty upset about the leakers," the
president said during a question-and-answer session
that followed a brief speech to the group's 97th an
nual convention. "We're not trying to hide anything
that shouldn't be hidden."
Reagan was responding to a question about moves
within the administration to subject present and
former government employees to sentences of up to
three years in prison for leaking classified informa
tion, and requiring lie detector tests for persons sus
pected of leaking information.

The president agreed with the questioner that
there had been an "over-classification" of informa
tion for political — not national security purposes.
But he said there have been "very serious" leaks of
classified information involving national security in
the last two years.
"I do not know what is in the mind of the person
that will leak something of a classified nature," Rea
gan said "Actually, they have endangered our rela
tionship with some other country." He did not identi
ty the country or elaborate.
On another subject, Reagan insisted that he had
not thought about replacing Paul Volcker as chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, thus firmly denying re
ports that Volcker definitely will be let go when his
term expires in August.
One publisher cifed a recent rash of stories indicat
ing that senior White House aides had decided that
the Fed chairman should be replaced. The president
was asked what bothered him about Volcker, whose
monetary policies apparently have helped spur eco
nomic recovery.
"Not a thing," Reagan replied. "And you must re
alize that sometimes the morning papers come to me
with breakfast and I get surprised at some of the
things I am (allegedly) doing myself. There has never
been a discussion in the White House about this. We
just haven't considered it." In addition, Reagan de
fended Secretary of the Interior James Watt, declar
ing, "I don't know anyone in that department who
has done a better job with regard to environmental
protection and refurbishing of our parks."
Poor forced off welfare rolls
Washington — The poor who were forced off the
welfare rolls in the Reagan administration's 1981
crackdown on welfare requirements have supported
themselves largely with low-paying jobs, which they
have not given up to return to public assistance as
critics predicted, according to a study scheduled for
release tomorrow.
The study of records in 40 counties and 27 states by
the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina
shows that only 15 percent of those purged from the
welfare rolls in October, 1981, when the changes
were implemented, had gone back a year later. The 85
percent who continued working saved the federal
and state government hundreds of millions of dollars
in welfare costs.
Two years ago the Reagan administration proposed
several budget cuts and welfare changes that critics
charged were borne primarily by the working poor.
"I think this proves on the national level what we
were able to do with welfare in California when we
cut the welfare rolls," said Robert Carleson, special
assistant to the president in the office of policy de
velopment. Carleson was director of the California
state welfare department when Reagan was governor
and instituted similar eligibility restrictions.
Stocks up amid mixed trading
Stock prices turned mixed in the busiest trading in
almost four months Wednesday as some traders took
profits above the 1200 level in the Dow Jones in
dustrial average.
The closely watched average of 30 blue chips, up
almost 10 points at midday, was off 1.06 at 1208.40 by
the close. The average jumped 22.25 points Tuesday
to record highs.
Today's weather
Showers with occasional clearing. Highs mainly in
the 60s. Lows in the 40s to low 50s.

Reagan makes El Salvador appeal
Washington —President Reagan told a joint session
of Congress yesterday night that the national security
of aH the \mericas is at stake in the troubled nations
of cen\ral America and called for bipartisan support in
helping democratic governments resist leftist in
surgency there.
Portraying the situation in strife-torn El Salvador
and Nicaragua as a Soviet-backed effort "to
destabilize the entire region from the Panama Canal
to Mexico," the president held fast to his proposals
for stepped up economic and military aid to the
Salvadoran government despite recent rebuffs in
Congress.
Just one day before Reagan took the unusual step

of going before the joint session, he had seen a House
subcommittee cut in half his request to transfer $60
million in already appropriated military aid funds to El
Salvador. The administration also faces a probable
congressional effort to restrict U. S. assistance to
forces fighting the Sandanista government in
Nicaragua.
"I say to you tonight there can be no question,"
Reagan declared yesterday,"the national security of
all the Americas is at stake in Centra! America.
"If we cannot defend ourselves there, we cannot
expect to prevail elsewhere. Our credibility would
collapse, our alliances would crumble, and the safety
of our homeland would be put at jeopardy."
Specifically, he called upon the lawmakers to ap
provetho 1984 Centra! Ampricanaid requests totaling

about $600 million, telling them the U. S. assistance
package for this crucial area of the world "is less than
one-tenth of what Americans will spend this year on
c oin-operated video games.
"What I am asking for is prompt congressional ap
proval for the full reprogramming of funds for key
current economic and security programs so that the
people of Central America can hold the line against
externally supported aggression."
He also called for speedy congressional action on
the rest of ,1 special aid oackage sent to Congress near
ly two months ago.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, (D-Conn.), in a hard-hit
ting Democratic response to President Reagan's
speech to Congress yesterday night, strongly sug
gested that the administration vvas leading the nation

into another Vietnam-type quagmire in Central
America.
Dodd, speaking on national television after Rea
gan's address, said in his prepared text:
"Instead of trying to do something about the fac
tors which breed revolution, this administration has
turned to massive military buildups at a cost of hun
dreds of millions of dollars. Its policy is ever-increas
ing military assistance, endless military training, even
hiring our own paramilitary guerrillas. This is a for
mula for failure.
"And," Dodd added in a clear comparison to past
U S. involvement in Vietnam, "it is a proven prescrip
tion for picking a loser. The American people know
that we have been down this road before — and that it
only leads to a dark tunnel of endless intervention."
The senator said that all Americans oppose the es
tablishment of Marxist states in Central America, and
will not accept the creation of Soviet military bases in
the region. And, he said, "We are fully prepared to
defend our security and the security of the Americas,
if necessary, by military means."
Begin warns of Syrian buildup
Jerusalem —Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin told Secretary of State George Shultz yesterday
that Syria is staging a massive military buildup aided
by a $1.5 billion infusion of sophisticated Soviet
equipment and 4000 Soviet military advisers.
The Israeli charges were made when Shultz met
with Begin on the first leg of a shuttle mission be
tween Jerusalem and Beirut. Shultz is seeking to con
clude successfully the four-month negotiations on an
agreement for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
Lebanon.
U.S. officials accompanying Shultz said he initially
reacted to the Israeli charges — which were given in a
detailed briefing by Israel's chief of military in
telligence — by saying that Syrian activities were "a
source of concern."
In private, the officials said the United States had
not yet had time to assess the Israeli data and check it
against U.S. intelligence reports.
As a result, they added, it was not immediately clear
whether Begin's presentation was an indication of
genuine Israeli concern about a threat from Syria ora
diversionary tactic aimed at winning U.S. sympathy at
the outset of anticipated hard bargaining over the
Lebanon withdrawal question.
Some details of the presentation by Maj. Gen. Ehud
Barak had been leaked to the Israeli press prior to
Shultz's arrival yesterday. Some sources said Begin's
decision to stress the matter so strongly in his meeting
with Shultz was an attempt to use the heavy press at
tention being accorded Shultz's Middle East trip as a
means of getting the Israeli concerns publicized wide
ly in the United States.
The Israelis charged that the Soviets have helped
Syrian President Hafez Assad to rebuild his forces
through massive replacement of tanks and jet aircraft
destroyed by the Israelis during the fighting in Leba
non last summer. In addition, the Israelis contended,
Soviet advisers are operating advanced, SA-5 ground
to-air missile batteries within Syria and are operating
sophisticated electronic warfare equipment for the
Syrians.
Until now, the official U.S. position toward the al
leged Syrian buildup has been to say that the United
States has heard reports of extensive troop move
ments within Syria but has been unable to confirm
them.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who conferred
with Shultz in Cairo yesterday, is reported to have told
the secretary that a military buildup is underway in
Syria but that it is aimed at putting pressure on Israel
to withdraw from Lebanon.
Hinton to leave El Salvador
San Salvador — Declaring he is "weary" after two
years as U.S. ambassador here, Deane Hinton said he
is "one of those who think (the Salvadoran war) is
going to go on for quite a while yet."
Hinton also said that cleaning up the military's hu
man-rights abuses, a source of much U.S. con
gressional opposition to aid for the Salvadoran gov
ernment, is "a question in my view of years," perhaps
a decade or more until there can be what the U.S. en
voy called "a generational change" in the officer
corps.

On the eve of the speech by President Reagan to a
joint session of Congress defending his Central Amer
ica policy, Hinton pictured the conflict here as one
that has been stretched out largely by Washington's
stinginess with "resources" and by Nicaraguan sup
port for the rebels.
"I have said for two years we need resources," Hin
ton told a pair of reporters. "They've come too little,
too late."
The revolutionary Sandinista regime in nearby
Nicaragua has "a great deal to say about how long (the
war) goes on," Hinton added. But he said there is not
yet enough evidence to determine whether counter
revolutionaries fighting Sandinistas in Nicaragua have
had any impact on rebel arm supplies here. The stated
purpose of U.S. support for the "contras" is the "in
terdiction" of such shipments.
Hinton, 60, has been the Reagan administration's
point man in El Salvador since June 1981. He has ex
traordinary influence here, even in the context of a
region traditionally dominated by U.S. interests.
Many diplomats and Salvadoran officials credit Hin
ton with personally stopping a takeover of the gov
ernment by right-wing ex-military leader Roberto
D'Aubuisson a year ago when D'Aubuisson put to
gether a majority coalition in the then newly elected
Constituent Assembly. A centrist civilian, Alvaro
Magana, was named instead as interim president.
Hinton portrayed recent developments in the gov
ernment here as generally favorable to U.S. policy. He
praised Magana effusively and said it will be too bad
when he is no longer president, after elections at the
end of the year. The only "downside" of Magana
coming to power, Hinton said, was that "one had to
resort to the military" to put him in office in April
1982. With Hinton tellingthemacutoffofvital U.S. aid
would be likely if D'Aubuisson had become presi
dent, the high command finally presented Magana as
the only choice the assembly could name that they
would accept.
Andropov for space weapons ban
Moscow — Soviet leader Yuri Andropov called yes
terday for an international agreement to ban the use
of space weapons, saying "a crucial moment is really
coming" to halt plans for transferring the arms race
into outer space.
"Either the interested states will sit down at the ne
gotiating table without delay to begin drawing up a
treaty prohibiting the deployment in space of weap
ons of any kind, orthe arms race will go overalso into
space," Andropov said.
The Soviet leader's remarks were contained in his
reply to a telegram he received from a group of prom
inent Americans calling for a ban on space weapons.
The government news agency Tass said the tele
gram included signatures of Nobel prize laureates 1.1.
Rabi and Hans Bethe, retired Adm. Noel Gayler,
former head of the National Security Agency, Christ
opher Kraft, former director of the Johnson Space
Center, Richard Garvin of the Watson Research Cen
ter, Vice Adm. John Lee (Ret.) and such prominent
scientists Wolfgang Panofsky, George Rathjens, Carl
Sagan and Herbert York.
Tass said the authors of the telegram appealed to
Andropov and to President Reagan "to come to
terms" on a pact banning the deployment of any kind
of weapon in outer space as well as prohibiting "the
damaging or destruction of the satellites of any state."
Such a pact, they were quoted as saying, would be "in
the interest of all mankind."
The authors were also quoted as saying that the
United States was preparing tests of an advanced anti
satellite system and "that once such systems of weap
ons appear in the arsenals of countries it would be

very difficult to phase them out."
Although Andropov in his reply underscored Sovi
et readiness to negotiate a ban on space weapons, his
warning that time was running out appeared de
signed to make it clear that the Soviet Union intended
to match new U.S. space weapons systems
Feinstein applauds victory
San Francisco —Mayor Dianne Feinstein said yes
terday her resounding defeat of a recall movement
led by radical dissidents will refute detractors who
dwell on the city's reputation for political eccentrici
ty-
The mayor, on her way to winning 80 percent of the
ballots in a special election Tuesday, told an en
thusiastic crowd of supporters election night the big
vote represented "a mandate to say to the world that
San Francisco is indeed an island of sanity."
In her office the next morning, Feinstein called the
election results "stupendous — far beyond our ex
pectations."
"This election should very clearly speak to the im
age of the city .... It considerably mutes the de
tractors, whoever they may be."
In all, about 46 percent of the city's 354,000 voters
cast ballots. With only a few votes left to be counted,
the recall was being defeated 127,043 to 29,269.
Feinstein, waging a vigorous campaign for mail-in
votes to counter the traditionally small turnout in spe
cial elections, received a huge majority of a record
56,000 absentee ballots cast.
She lost only one precinct in the city — and that by
one vote. The precinct is in a Haight-Ashbury district
where the White Panther party, the small activist
group that led the recall drive, maintains its head
quarters.
And as it turned out, the number who voted "yes"
on the recall was smaller than the number that signed
the petitions that forced the recall election in the first
place.
"Looks like we got edged out," Thomas Stevens,
the Panthers' leader, said good-humoredly as he dis
cussed the election yesterday.
Stevens attributed Feinstein's victory in part to her
ability to focus news media attention on the propriety
of the recall movement itself, rather than on her
sponsorship of an ordinance banning handguns from
the city an ordinance that was struck down in court
and never went into effect. The Panthers collected
more than 34,000 signatures on recall petitions charg
ing Feinstein violated the constitutional right to bear
arms.
The White Panthers, a self-described Communist
group operating from the Haight-Ashbury, has
achieved new prominence in the press during the re
call campaign, adding again to the city's reputation
for political volatility.
Reagan criticizes leaks
New York —President Reagan told the American
Newspaper Publishers Association yesterday that
leaks of classified information to the news media dur
ing his administration have been "very serious" and
have endangered U.S. relations with anothercountry
"I really am pretty upset about the leakers," the
president said during a question-and-answer session
that followed a brief speech to the group's 97th an
nual convention. "We're not trying to hide anything
that shouldn't be hidden."
Reagan was responding to a question about moves
within the administration to subject present and
former government employees to sentences of up to
three years in prison for leaking classified informa
tion, and requiring lie detector tests for persons sus
pected of leaking information.

The president agreed with the questioner that
there had been an "over-classification" of informa
tion for political — not national security purposes.
But he said there have been "very serious" leaks of
classified information involving national security in
the last two years.
"I do not know what is in the mind of the person
that will leak something of a classified nature," Rea
gan said "Actually, they have endangered our rela
tionship with some other country." He did not identi
ty the country or elaborate.
On another subject, Reagan insisted that he had
not thought about replacing Paul Volcker as chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, thus firmly denying re
ports that Volcker definitely will be let go when his
term expires in August.
One publisher cifed a recent rash of stories indicat
ing that senior White House aides had decided that
the Fed chairman should be replaced. The president
was asked what bothered him about Volcker, whose
monetary policies apparently have helped spur eco
nomic recovery.
"Not a thing," Reagan replied. "And you must re
alize that sometimes the morning papers come to me
with breakfast and I get surprised at some of the
things I am (allegedly) doing myself. There has never
been a discussion in the White House about this. We
just haven't considered it." In addition, Reagan de
fended Secretary of the Interior James Watt, declar
ing, "I don't know anyone in that department who
has done a better job with regard to environmental
protection and refurbishing of our parks."
Poor forced off welfare rolls
Washington — The poor who were forced off the
welfare rolls in the Reagan administration's 1981
crackdown on welfare requirements have supported
themselves largely with low-paying jobs, which they
have not given up to return to public assistance as
critics predicted, according to a study scheduled for
release tomorrow.
The study of records in 40 counties and 27 states by
the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina
shows that only 15 percent of those purged from the
welfare rolls in October, 1981, when the changes
were implemented, had gone back a year later. The 85
percent who continued working saved the federal
and state government hundreds of millions of dollars
in welfare costs.
Two years ago the Reagan administration proposed
several budget cuts and welfare changes that critics
charged were borne primarily by the working poor.
"I think this proves on the national level what we
were able to do with welfare in California when we
cut the welfare rolls," said Robert Carleson, special
assistant to the president in the office of policy de
velopment. Carleson was director of the California
state welfare department when Reagan was governor
and instituted similar eligibility restrictions.

Reagan makes El Salvador appeal
Washington —President Reagan told a joint session
of Congress yesterday night that the national security
of aH the \mericas is at stake in the troubled nations
of cen\ral America and called for bipartisan support in
helping democratic governments resist leftist in
surgency there.
Portraying the situation in strife-torn El Salvador
and Nicaragua as a Soviet-backed effort "to
destabilize the entire region from the Panama Canal
to Mexico," the president held fast to his proposals
for stepped up economic and military aid to the
Salvadoran government despite recent rebuffs in
Congress.
Just one day before Reagan took the unusual step

of going before the joint session, he had seen a House
subcommittee cut in half his request to transfer $60
million in already appropriated military aid funds to El
Salvador. The administration also faces a probable
congressional effort to restrict U. S. assistance to
forces fighting the Sandanista government in
Nicaragua.
"I say to you tonight there can be no question,"
Reagan declared yesterday,"the national security of
all the Americas is at stake in Centra! America.
"If we cannot defend ourselves there, we cannot
expect to prevail elsewhere. Our credibility would
collapse, our alliances would crumble, and the safety
of our homeland would be put at jeopardy."
Specifically, he called upon the lawmakers to ap
provetho 1984 Centra! Ampricanaid requests totaling

about $600 million, telling them the U. S. assistance
package for this crucial area of the world "is less than
one-tenth of what Americans will spend this year on
c oin-operated video games.
"What I am asking for is prompt congressional ap
proval for the full reprogramming of funds for key
current economic and security programs so that the
people of Central America can hold the line against
externally supported aggression."
He also called for speedy congressional action on
the rest of ,1 special aid oackage sent to Congress near
ly two months ago.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, (D-Conn.), in a hard-hit
ting Democratic response to President Reagan's
speech to Congress yesterday night, strongly sug
gested that the administration vvas leading the nation

into another Vietnam-type quagmire in Central
America.
Dodd, speaking on national television after Rea
gan's address, said in his prepared text:
"Instead of trying to do something about the fac
tors which breed revolution, this administration has
turned to massive military buildups at a cost of hun
dreds of millions of dollars. Its policy is ever-increas
ing military assistance, endless military training, even
hiring our own paramilitary guerrillas. This is a for
mula for failure.
"And," Dodd added in a clear comparison to past
U S. involvement in Vietnam, "it is a proven prescrip
tion for picking a loser. The American people know
that we have been down this road before — and that it
only leads to a dark tunnel of endless intervention."
The senator said that all Americans oppose the es
tablishment of Marxist states in Central America, and
will not accept the creation of Soviet military bases in
the region. And, he said, "We are fully prepared to
defend our security and the security of the Americas,
if necessary, by military means."
Begin warns of Syrian buildup
Jerusalem —Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin told Secretary of State George Shultz yesterday
that Syria is staging a massive military buildup aided
by a $1.5 billion infusion of sophisticated Soviet
equipment and 4000 Soviet military advisers.
The Israeli charges were made when Shultz met
with Begin on the first leg of a shuttle mission be
tween Jerusalem and Beirut. Shultz is seeking to con
clude successfully the four-month negotiations on an
agreement for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
Lebanon.
U.S. officials accompanying Shultz said he initially
reacted to the Israeli charges — which were given in a
detailed briefing by Israel's chief of military in
telligence — by saying that Syrian activities were "a
source of concern."
In private, the officials said the United States had
not yet had time to assess the Israeli data and check it
against U.S. intelligence reports.
As a result, they added, it was not immediately clear
whether Begin's presentation was an indication of
genuine Israeli concern about a threat from Syria ora
diversionary tactic aimed at winning U.S. sympathy at
the outset of anticipated hard bargaining over the
Lebanon withdrawal question.
Some details of the presentation by Maj. Gen. Ehud
Barak had been leaked to the Israeli press prior to
Shultz's arrival yesterday. Some sources said Begin's
decision to stress the matter so strongly in his meeting
with Shultz was an attempt to use the heavy press at
tention being accorded Shultz's Middle East trip as a
means of getting the Israeli concerns publicized wide
ly in the United States.
The Israelis charged that the Soviets have helped
Syrian President Hafez Assad to rebuild his forces
through massive replacement of tanks and jet aircraft
destroyed by the Israelis during the fighting in Leba
non last summer. In addition, the Israelis contended,
Soviet advisers are operating advanced, SA-5 ground
to-air missile batteries within Syria and are operating
sophisticated electronic warfare equipment for the
Syrians.
Until now, the official U.S. position toward the al
leged Syrian buildup has been to say that the United
States has heard reports of extensive troop move
ments within Syria but has been unable to confirm
them.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who conferred
with Shultz in Cairo yesterday, is reported to have told
the secretary that a military buildup is underway in
Syria but that it is aimed at putting pressure on Israel
to withdraw from Lebanon.
Hinton to leave El Salvador
San Salvador — Declaring he is "weary" after two
years as U.S. ambassador here, Deane Hinton said he
is "one of those who think (the Salvadoran war) is
going to go on for quite a while yet."
Hinton also said that cleaning up the military's hu
man-rights abuses, a source of much U.S. con
gressional opposition to aid for the Salvadoran gov
ernment, is "a question in my view of years," perhaps
a decade or more until there can be what the U.S. en
voy called "a generational change" in the officer
corps.

On the eve of the speech by President Reagan to a
joint session of Congress defending his Central Amer
ica policy, Hinton pictured the conflict here as one
that has been stretched out largely by Washington's
stinginess with "resources" and by Nicaraguan sup
port for the rebels.
"I have said for two years we need resources," Hin
ton told a pair of reporters. "They've come too little,
too late."
The revolutionary Sandinista regime in nearby
Nicaragua has "a great deal to say about how long (the
war) goes on," Hinton added. But he said there is not
yet enough evidence to determine whether counter
revolutionaries fighting Sandinistas in Nicaragua have
had any impact on rebel arm supplies here. The stated
purpose of U.S. support for the "contras" is the "in
terdiction" of such shipments.
Hinton, 60, has been the Reagan administration's
point man in El Salvador since June 1981. He has ex
traordinary influence here, even in the context of a
region traditionally dominated by U.S. interests.
Many diplomats and Salvadoran officials credit Hin
ton with personally stopping a takeover of the gov
ernment by right-wing ex-military leader Roberto
D'Aubuisson a year ago when D'Aubuisson put to
gether a majority coalition in the then newly elected
Constituent Assembly. A centrist civilian, Alvaro
Magana, was named instead as interim president.
Hinton portrayed recent developments in the gov
ernment here as generally favorable to U.S. policy. He
praised Magana effusively and said it will be too bad
when he is no longer president, after elections at the
end of the year. The only "downside" of Magana
coming to power, Hinton said, was that "one had to
resort to the military" to put him in office in April
1982. With Hinton tellingthemacutoffofvital U.S. aid
would be likely if D'Aubuisson had become presi
dent, the high command finally presented Magana as
the only choice the assembly could name that they
would accept.
Andropov for space weapons ban
Moscow — Soviet leader Yuri Andropov called yes
terday for an international agreement to ban the use
of space weapons, saying "a crucial moment is really
coming" to halt plans for transferring the arms race
into outer space.
"Either the interested states will sit down at the ne
gotiating table without delay to begin drawing up a
treaty prohibiting the deployment in space of weap
ons of any kind, orthe arms race will go overalso into
space," Andropov said.
The Soviet leader's remarks were contained in his
reply to a telegram he received from a group of prom
inent Americans calling for a ban on space weapons.
The government news agency Tass said the tele
gram included signatures of Nobel prize laureates 1.1.
Rabi and Hans Bethe, retired Adm. Noel Gayler,
former head of the National Security Agency, Christ
opher Kraft, former director of the Johnson Space
Center, Richard Garvin of the Watson Research Cen
ter, Vice Adm. John Lee (Ret.) and such prominent
scientists Wolfgang Panofsky, George Rathjens, Carl
Sagan and Herbert York.
Tass said the authors of the telegram appealed to
Andropov and to President Reagan "to come to
terms" on a pact banning the deployment of any kind
of weapon in outer space as well as prohibiting "the
damaging or destruction of the satellites of any state."
Such a pact, they were quoted as saying, would be "in
the interest of all mankind."
The authors were also quoted as saying that the
United States was preparing tests of an advanced anti
satellite system and "that once such systems of weap
ons appear in the arsenals of countries it would be

very difficult to phase them out."
Although Andropov in his reply underscored Sovi
et readiness to negotiate a ban on space weapons, his
warning that time was running out appeared de
signed to make it clear that the Soviet Union intended
to match new U.S. space weapons systems
Feinstein applauds victory
San Francisco —Mayor Dianne Feinstein said yes
terday her resounding defeat of a recall movement
led by radical dissidents will refute detractors who
dwell on the city's reputation for political eccentrici
ty-
The mayor, on her way to winning 80 percent of the
ballots in a special election Tuesday, told an en
thusiastic crowd of supporters election night the big
vote represented "a mandate to say to the world that
San Francisco is indeed an island of sanity."
In her office the next morning, Feinstein called the
election results "stupendous — far beyond our ex
pectations."
"This election should very clearly speak to the im
age of the city .... It considerably mutes the de
tractors, whoever they may be."
In all, about 46 percent of the city's 354,000 voters
cast ballots. With only a few votes left to be counted,
the recall was being defeated 127,043 to 29,269.
Feinstein, waging a vigorous campaign for mail-in
votes to counter the traditionally small turnout in spe
cial elections, received a huge majority of a record
56,000 absentee ballots cast.
She lost only one precinct in the city — and that by
one vote. The precinct is in a Haight-Ashbury district
where the White Panther party, the small activist
group that led the recall drive, maintains its head
quarters.
And as it turned out, the number who voted "yes"
on the recall was smaller than the number that signed
the petitions that forced the recall election in the first
place.
"Looks like we got edged out," Thomas Stevens,
the Panthers' leader, said good-humoredly as he dis
cussed the election yesterday.
Stevens attributed Feinstein's victory in part to her
ability to focus news media attention on the propriety
of the recall movement itself, rather than on her
sponsorship of an ordinance banning handguns from
the city an ordinance that was struck down in court
and never went into effect. The Panthers collected
more than 34,000 signatures on recall petitions charg
ing Feinstein violated the constitutional right to bear
arms.
The White Panthers, a self-described Communist
group operating from the Haight-Ashbury, has
achieved new prominence in the press during the re
call campaign, adding again to the city's reputation
for political volatility.
Reagan criticizes leaks
New York —President Reagan told the American
Newspaper Publishers Association yesterday that
leaks of classified information to the news media dur
ing his administration have been "very serious" and
have endangered U.S. relations with anothercountry
"I really am pretty upset about the leakers," the
president said during a question-and-answer session
that followed a brief speech to the group's 97th an
nual convention. "We're not trying to hide anything
that shouldn't be hidden."
Reagan was responding to a question about moves
within the administration to subject present and
former government employees to sentences of up to
three years in prison for leaking classified informa
tion, and requiring lie detector tests for persons sus
pected of leaking information.

The president agreed with the questioner that
there had been an "over-classification" of informa
tion for political — not national security purposes.
But he said there have been "very serious" leaks of
classified information involving national security in
the last two years.
"I do not know what is in the mind of the person
that will leak something of a classified nature," Rea
gan said "Actually, they have endangered our rela
tionship with some other country." He did not identi
ty the country or elaborate.
On another subject, Reagan insisted that he had
not thought about replacing Paul Volcker as chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, thus firmly denying re
ports that Volcker definitely will be let go when his
term expires in August.
One publisher cifed a recent rash of stories indicat
ing that senior White House aides had decided that
the Fed chairman should be replaced. The president
was asked what bothered him about Volcker, whose
monetary policies apparently have helped spur eco
nomic recovery.
"Not a thing," Reagan replied. "And you must re
alize that sometimes the morning papers come to me
with breakfast and I get surprised at some of the
things I am (allegedly) doing myself. There has never
been a discussion in the White House about this. We
just haven't considered it." In addition, Reagan de
fended Secretary of the Interior James Watt, declar
ing, "I don't know anyone in that department who
has done a better job with regard to environmental
protection and refurbishing of our parks."
Poor forced off welfare rolls
Washington — The poor who were forced off the
welfare rolls in the Reagan administration's 1981
crackdown on welfare requirements have supported
themselves largely with low-paying jobs, which they
have not given up to return to public assistance as
critics predicted, according to a study scheduled for
release tomorrow.
The study of records in 40 counties and 27 states by
the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina
shows that only 15 percent of those purged from the
welfare rolls in October, 1981, when the changes
were implemented, had gone back a year later. The 85
percent who continued working saved the federal
and state government hundreds of millions of dollars
in welfare costs.
Two years ago the Reagan administration proposed
several budget cuts and welfare changes that critics
charged were borne primarily by the working poor.
"I think this proves on the national level what we
were able to do with welfare in California when we
cut the welfare rolls," said Robert Carleson, special
assistant to the president in the office of policy de
velopment. Carleson was director of the California
state welfare department when Reagan was governor
and instituted similar eligibility restrictions.

Reagan makes El Salvador appeal
Washington —President Reagan told a joint session
of Congress yesterday night that the national security
of aH the \mericas is at stake in the troubled nations
of cen\ral America and called for bipartisan support in
helping democratic governments resist leftist in
surgency there.
Portraying the situation in strife-torn El Salvador
and Nicaragua as a Soviet-backed effort "to
destabilize the entire region from the Panama Canal
to Mexico," the president held fast to his proposals
for stepped up economic and military aid to the
Salvadoran government despite recent rebuffs in
Congress.
Just one day before Reagan took the unusual step

of going before the joint session, he had seen a House
subcommittee cut in half his request to transfer $60
million in already appropriated military aid funds to El
Salvador. The administration also faces a probable
congressional effort to restrict U. S. assistance to
forces fighting the Sandanista government in
Nicaragua.
"I say to you tonight there can be no question,"
Reagan declared yesterday,"the national security of
all the Americas is at stake in Centra! America.
"If we cannot defend ourselves there, we cannot
expect to prevail elsewhere. Our credibility would
collapse, our alliances would crumble, and the safety
of our homeland would be put at jeopardy."
Specifically, he called upon the lawmakers to ap
provetho 1984 Centra! Ampricanaid requests totaling

about $600 million, telling them the U. S. assistance
package for this crucial area of the world "is less than
one-tenth of what Americans will spend this year on
c oin-operated video games.
"What I am asking for is prompt congressional ap
proval for the full reprogramming of funds for key
current economic and security programs so that the
people of Central America can hold the line against
externally supported aggression."
He also called for speedy congressional action on
the rest of ,1 special aid oackage sent to Congress near
ly two months ago.
Sen. Christopher Dodd, (D-Conn.), in a hard-hit
ting Democratic response to President Reagan's
speech to Congress yesterday night, strongly sug
gested that the administration vvas leading the nation

into another Vietnam-type quagmire in Central
America.
Dodd, speaking on national television after Rea
gan's address, said in his prepared text:
"Instead of trying to do something about the fac
tors which breed revolution, this administration has
turned to massive military buildups at a cost of hun
dreds of millions of dollars. Its policy is ever-increas
ing military assistance, endless military training, even
hiring our own paramilitary guerrillas. This is a for
mula for failure.
"And," Dodd added in a clear comparison to past
U S. involvement in Vietnam, "it is a proven prescrip
tion for picking a loser. The American people know
that we have been down this road before — and that it
only leads to a dark tunnel of endless intervention."
The senator said that all Americans oppose the es
tablishment of Marxist states in Central America, and
will not accept the creation of Soviet military bases in
the region. And, he said, "We are fully prepared to
defend our security and the security of the Americas,
if necessary, by military means."
Begin warns of Syrian buildup
Jerusalem —Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin told Secretary of State George Shultz yesterday
that Syria is staging a massive military buildup aided
by a $1.5 billion infusion of sophisticated Soviet
equipment and 4000 Soviet military advisers.
The Israeli charges were made when Shultz met
with Begin on the first leg of a shuttle mission be
tween Jerusalem and Beirut. Shultz is seeking to con
clude successfully the four-month negotiations on an
agreement for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
Lebanon.
U.S. officials accompanying Shultz said he initially
reacted to the Israeli charges — which were given in a
detailed briefing by Israel's chief of military in
telligence — by saying that Syrian activities were "a
source of concern."
In private, the officials said the United States had
not yet had time to assess the Israeli data and check it
against U.S. intelligence reports.
As a result, they added, it was not immediately clear
whether Begin's presentation was an indication of
genuine Israeli concern about a threat from Syria ora
diversionary tactic aimed at winning U.S. sympathy at
the outset of anticipated hard bargaining over the
Lebanon withdrawal question.
Some details of the presentation by Maj. Gen. Ehud
Barak had been leaked to the Israeli press prior to
Shultz's arrival yesterday. Some sources said Begin's
decision to stress the matter so strongly in his meeting
with Shultz was an attempt to use the heavy press at
tention being accorded Shultz's Middle East trip as a
means of getting the Israeli concerns publicized wide
ly in the United States.
The Israelis charged that the Soviets have helped
Syrian President Hafez Assad to rebuild his forces
through massive replacement of tanks and jet aircraft
destroyed by the Israelis during the fighting in Leba
non last summer. In addition, the Israelis contended,
Soviet advisers are operating advanced, SA-5 ground
to-air missile batteries within Syria and are operating
sophisticated electronic warfare equipment for the
Syrians.
Until now, the official U.S. position toward the al
leged Syrian buildup has been to say that the United
States has heard reports of extensive troop move
ments within Syria but has been unable to confirm
them.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who conferred
with Shultz in Cairo yesterday, is reported to have told
the secretary that a military buildup is underway in
Syria but that it is aimed at putting pressure on Israel
to withdraw from Lebanon.
Hinton to leave El Salvador
San Salvador — Declaring he is "weary" after two
years as U.S. ambassador here, Deane Hinton said he
is "one of those who think (the Salvadoran war) is
going to go on for quite a while yet."
Hinton also said that cleaning up the military's hu
man-rights abuses, a source of much U.S. con
gressional opposition to aid for the Salvadoran gov
ernment, is "a question in my view of years," perhaps
a decade or more until there can be what the U.S. en
voy called "a generational change" in the officer
corps.

On the eve of the speech by President Reagan to a
joint session of Congress defending his Central Amer
ica policy, Hinton pictured the conflict here as one
that has been stretched out largely by Washington's
stinginess with "resources" and by Nicaraguan sup
port for the rebels.
"I have said for two years we need resources," Hin
ton told a pair of reporters. "They've come too little,
too late."
The revolutionary Sandinista regime in nearby
Nicaragua has "a great deal to say about how long (the
war) goes on," Hinton added. But he said there is not
yet enough evidence to determine whether counter
revolutionaries fighting Sandinistas in Nicaragua have
had any impact on rebel arm supplies here. The stated
purpose of U.S. support for the "contras" is the "in
terdiction" of such shipments.
Hinton, 60, has been the Reagan administration's
point man in El Salvador since June 1981. He has ex
traordinary influence here, even in the context of a
region traditionally dominated by U.S. interests.
Many diplomats and Salvadoran officials credit Hin
ton with personally stopping a takeover of the gov
ernment by right-wing ex-military leader Roberto
D'Aubuisson a year ago when D'Aubuisson put to
gether a majority coalition in the then newly elected
Constituent Assembly. A centrist civilian, Alvaro
Magana, was named instead as interim president.
Hinton portrayed recent developments in the gov
ernment here as generally favorable to U.S. policy. He
praised Magana effusively and said it will be too bad
when he is no longer president, after elections at the
end of the year. The only "downside" of Magana
coming to power, Hinton said, was that "one had to
resort to the military" to put him in office in April
1982. With Hinton tellingthemacutoffofvital U.S. aid
would be likely if D'Aubuisson had become presi
dent, the high command finally presented Magana as
the only choice the assembly could name that they
would accept.
Andropov for space weapons ban
Moscow — Soviet leader Yuri Andropov called yes
terday for an international agreement to ban the use
of space weapons, saying "a crucial moment is really
coming" to halt plans for transferring the arms race
into outer space.
"Either the interested states will sit down at the ne
gotiating table without delay to begin drawing up a
treaty prohibiting the deployment in space of weap
ons of any kind, orthe arms race will go overalso into
space," Andropov said.
The Soviet leader's remarks were contained in his
reply to a telegram he received from a group of prom
inent Americans calling for a ban on space weapons.
The government news agency Tass said the tele
gram included signatures of Nobel prize laureates 1.1.
Rabi and Hans Bethe, retired Adm. Noel Gayler,
former head of the National Security Agency, Christ
opher Kraft, former director of the Johnson Space
Center, Richard Garvin of the Watson Research Cen
ter, Vice Adm. John Lee (Ret.) and such prominent
scientists Wolfgang Panofsky, George Rathjens, Carl
Sagan and Herbert York.
Tass said the authors of the telegram appealed to
Andropov and to President Reagan "to come to
terms" on a pact banning the deployment of any kind
of weapon in outer space as well as prohibiting "the
damaging or destruction of the satellites of any state."
Such a pact, they were quoted as saying, would be "in
the interest of all mankind."
The authors were also quoted as saying that the
United States was preparing tests of an advanced anti
satellite system and "that once such systems of weap
ons appear in the arsenals of countries it would be

very difficult to phase them out."
Although Andropov in his reply underscored Sovi
et readiness to negotiate a ban on space weapons, his
warning that time was running out appeared de
signed to make it clear that the Soviet Union intended
to match new U.S. space weapons systems
Feinstein applauds victory
San Francisco —Mayor Dianne Feinstein said yes
terday her resounding defeat of a recall movement
led by radical dissidents will refute detractors who
dwell on the city's reputation for political eccentrici
ty-
The mayor, on her way to winning 80 percent of the
ballots in a special election Tuesday, told an en
thusiastic crowd of supporters election night the big
vote represented "a mandate to say to the world that
San Francisco is indeed an island of sanity."
In her office the next morning, Feinstein called the
election results "stupendous — far beyond our ex
pectations."
"This election should very clearly speak to the im
age of the city .... It considerably mutes the de
tractors, whoever they may be."
In all, about 46 percent of the city's 354,000 voters
cast ballots. With only a few votes left to be counted,
the recall was being defeated 127,043 to 29,269.
Feinstein, waging a vigorous campaign for mail-in
votes to counter the traditionally small turnout in spe
cial elections, received a huge majority of a record
56,000 absentee ballots cast.
She lost only one precinct in the city — and that by
one vote. The precinct is in a Haight-Ashbury district
where the White Panther party, the small activist
group that led the recall drive, maintains its head
quarters.
And as it turned out, the number who voted "yes"
on the recall was smaller than the number that signed
the petitions that forced the recall election in the first
place.
"Looks like we got edged out," Thomas Stevens,
the Panthers' leader, said good-humoredly as he dis
cussed the election yesterday.
Stevens attributed Feinstein's victory in part to her
ability to focus news media attention on the propriety
of the recall movement itself, rather than on her
sponsorship of an ordinance banning handguns from
the city an ordinance that was struck down in court
and never went into effect. The Panthers collected
more than 34,000 signatures on recall petitions charg
ing Feinstein violated the constitutional right to bear
arms.
The White Panthers, a self-described Communist
group operating from the Haight-Ashbury, has
achieved new prominence in the press during the re
call campaign, adding again to the city's reputation
for political volatility.
Reagan criticizes leaks
New York —President Reagan told the American
Newspaper Publishers Association yesterday that
leaks of classified information to the news media dur
ing his administration have been "very serious" and
have endangered U.S. relations with anothercountry
"I really am pretty upset about the leakers," the
president said during a question-and-answer session
that followed a brief speech to the group's 97th an
nual convention. "We're not trying to hide anything
that shouldn't be hidden."
Reagan was responding to a question about moves
within the administration to subject present and
former government employees to sentences of up to
three years in prison for leaking classified informa
tion, and requiring lie detector tests for persons sus
pected of leaking information.

The president agreed with the questioner that
there had been an "over-classification" of informa
tion for political — not national security purposes.
But he said there have been "very serious" leaks of
classified information involving national security in
the last two years.
"I do not know what is in the mind of the person
that will leak something of a classified nature," Rea
gan said "Actually, they have endangered our rela
tionship with some other country." He did not identi
ty the country or elaborate.
On another subject, Reagan insisted that he had
not thought about replacing Paul Volcker as chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board, thus firmly denying re
ports that Volcker definitely will be let go when his
term expires in August.
One publisher cifed a recent rash of stories indicat
ing that senior White House aides had decided that
the Fed chairman should be replaced. The president
was asked what bothered him about Volcker, whose
monetary policies apparently have helped spur eco
nomic recovery.
"Not a thing," Reagan replied. "And you must re
alize that sometimes the morning papers come to me
with breakfast and I get surprised at some of the
things I am (allegedly) doing myself. There has never
been a discussion in the White House about this. We
just haven't considered it." In addition, Reagan de
fended Secretary of the Interior James Watt, declar
ing, "I don't know anyone in that department who
has done a better job with regard to environmental
protection and refurbishing of our parks."
Poor forced off welfare rolls
Washington — The poor who were forced off the
welfare rolls in the Reagan administration's 1981
crackdown on welfare requirements have supported
themselves largely with low-paying jobs, which they
have not given up to return to public assistance as
critics predicted, according to a study scheduled for
release tomorrow.
The study of records in 40 counties and 27 states by
the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina
shows that only 15 percent of those purged from the
welfare rolls in October, 1981, when the changes
were implemented, had gone back a year later. The 85
percent who continued working saved the federal
and state government hundreds of millions of dollars
in welfare costs.
Two years ago the Reagan administration proposed
several budget cuts and welfare changes that critics
charged were borne primarily by the working poor.
"I think this proves on the national level what we
were able to do with welfare in California when we
cut the welfare rolls," said Robert Carleson, special
assistant to the president in the office of policy de
velopment. Carleson was director of the California
state welfare department when Reagan was governor

the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina
shows that only 15 percent of those purged from the
welfare rolls in October, 1981, when the changes
were implemented, had gone back a year later. The 85
percent who continued working saved the federal
and state government hundreds of millions of dollars
in welfare costs.
Two years ago the Reagan administration proposed
several budget cuts and welfare changes that critics
charged were borne primarily by the working poor.
"I think this proves on the national level what we
were able to do with welfare in California when we
cut the welfare rolls," said Robert Carleson, special
assistant to the president in the office of policy de
velopment. Carleson was director of the California
state welfare department when Reagan was governor
and instituted similar eligibility restrictions.
