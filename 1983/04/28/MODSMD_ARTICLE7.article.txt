## Arms control talks stall as freeze thaws in Congress Panel report advises moderation in policy 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire

Unless the Reagan administ
ration modifies its demand that
Moscow sharply reduce its
most modern and valued
land-based missile forces,
there is "virtually no chance"
for success in either of two
arms control negotiations now
under way in Geneva.
That is the assessment of a
30-member panel of civilian
arms control specialists and re
tired military officers who have
been studying these issues
since $980 under the auspices
of the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace.
Their final report entitled
"Challenges for U.S. National
Security" represents perhaps
the most important challenge
to the administration's
negotiating approach to sur
face here.
The report clearly refers to
the administration's proposal
at the Strategic Arms Reduc
tion Talks (START). This would
require Moscow to reduce tis
2350 land and submarine
based missiles to 850 and
would sharpl restrict the land
based force, in particular,
which now includes about 75
percent of Soviet nuclear
warheads.
The report says"the Soviets
have vigorously fought to pro
tect" those missiles where thay
have "their largest investment
and strategic advantage" and

that these forces "are not open
to major change, except in
crementally over an extended
period."
Despite the current gloom in
relations, the report says arms
control is still viable. Moscow
does have economic and milit
ary incentives to try to end an
American arms buildup and
reach agreements in which it
accepts some limitations on its
land-based missile force.
The panel suggests that fu
ture compromises involving
U.S. constraints on new cruise
missiles, thousands of which
are to be deployed on land, at
sea and on bombers, and
Soviet cutbacks on land-based
missiles might be possible.
The report also opposed the
kind of total nuclear freeze ad
vocated by many anti-nuclear
groups here and abroad. The
panel says that halting all nuc
lear weapons modernization
could increase the risks of un
predictable behavior on both
sides in a crisis.
"Ironically, neither of the
two most politically prominent
proposals" these days—the
freeze and Reagan's call for
sweeping missile cuts —does
much to increase stability in
crisis, the report says.
The key is to remove the
targets that are inviting to
shoot at, such as the big,
multiple-warhead missiles on
both sides.
