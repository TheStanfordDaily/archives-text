Soviet intelligence agents have tried and failed to dominate and
manipulate the nuclear weapons freeze movement in the United
States, FBI Director William Webster said Sunday.
"We see no indication that Soviet measures have resulted in
gaining control over the operational aspects of the mainline or
ganizations within the nuclear freeze movement," Webster said
on CBS News' Face the Nation.
"The overall freeze effort does not seem to us to have been
dominated by them (Soviet intelligence) or successfully manipu
lated," Webster said.
"That is not to say that they have not been trying diligently,
including use of funds, to have an impact on the movement," he
added.
"It coincides with their foreign policy to do so."
Webster also said that between 30 and 40 percent of the 3000
diplomats which the Soviet Union and its allies have stationed in
the United States are or have been involved in espionage.
"That's a large number for us to keep track of," he said, adding
that the FBI is seeking more funds to increase its surveillance
efforts.
Asked what kind of information the spies are after, he said,
"military secrets, military strategy, political strategy. The area we
see a heavier concentration is in high technology, particularly
laser technology and computers.
