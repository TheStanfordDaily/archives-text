## Freeze Amendments debated 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
The nuclear freeze debate in the House of
Representatives, billed as an historic event and
launched with the grandiose rhetoric of war and
peace, has been reduced to bickering.
The resolution will eventually pass in the
Democratic-controlled House, all sides agree.
But, cluttered with amendments and nitpicked
by technical arguments, it will hardly be the
clear referendum on President Reagan's arms
control policy for which its backers had hoped.
Beneath the oil portraits of dour politicians in
the lobby outside the House chamber last week,
dueling charts, prepared by opposing sides,
compared the range and payload of the U.S.
FB-111, B-52H and B-52C bombers to the Soviets'
Backfire, Blinder, Bear and Bison bombers.
No one foresaw the current quagmire when
the House opened debate on the issue last
month. Last year, the freeze lost by two votes.
Since then freeze advocates' ranks have been
swelled by the election of 26 additional Democ
rats, many of whom won in part because of the
movement's grass-roots appeal.
Supporters were calling the issue a "mother
hood" vote, a politically painless way to register
opposition to "nuclear madness." Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.), cheerfully said
that the resolution would pass in a day by about
50 votes.
Instead, a guerrilla band of hawkish conserva
tives, led by Republican Whip Trent Lott (R-
Miss.), Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), Samuel Stratton
(D-N.V.) and others, has tied up the freeze re
solution during 30 hours of debate over the last
five weeks. Twice opponents have come within
six votes of passing amendments that endorsed
Reagan's arms control positions.
"We were caught flat-footed," said Reuben
McCornack of the Nuclear Weapons Freeze

Campaign. "We thought we could walk in and
walk out with the freeze."
The resolution, sponsored by more than 200
House members, asks the United States and
Soviet Union to negotiate "an immediate,
mutual and verifiable freeze" on production,
development and deployment of nuclear
weapons.
Reagan says the resolution would undercut
his Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) in
Geneva. The administration is trying to
negotiate overall weapons reductions while the
United States builds its arsenal in areas the
Soviets are thought to have an advantage.
Thus, with Democrats using the freeze resolu
tion to discredit Reagan, Republicans felt obli
gated to fight back. Their weapons are an arse
nal of harmless-sounding amendments which,
in the eyes of freeze supporters, would gut the
resolution. An amendment sponsored by Rep
Mark Siljander (R-Mich.), which allowed for a
freeze "and/or reductions," was defeated by a
margin of seven votes.
Explaining that arms control agreements have
reduced certain weapons but allowed the build
up of new and destabilizing nuclear systems,
Rep. Thomas Downey (D-N.V.) said, " 'Reduc
tions' do not really mean reductions. Reduc
tions mean more weapons."
An amendment to insert provisions for "mod
ernization" of U.S. forces was fought off with a
counter-amendment allowing "safety-related
improvements." Freeze proponents say mod
ernization is a code word for Reagan's military
buildup.
Many freeze supporters who jumped on the
bandwagon thinking it was mainly a symbol are
not comfortable with specifics. "The freeze has
always been at its best as an expression of sen
timent," Aspin said. "Asa negotiating posture, it
has drawbacks."
