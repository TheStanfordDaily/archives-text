# Protestors march on Kennedy's office

### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
About 150 people marched from a rain
soaked rally in White Plaza to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office yesterday to pre
sent Kennedy with two letters opposing a pro
posal at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL) that would involve research
on nuclear weapons.
The peaceful demonstration, led by oppo
nents of the controversial plan to allow the first
nuclear weapons research at the laboratory,
came at what supporters hoped would be a
critical time in the decision-making process on
the project. Arthur Bienenstock, the director of
SSRL, had indicated earlier that he would be
issuing a final decision whether or not to accept
the proposal this week.
However, Bienenstock said two nights ago
that he would defer a decision until next week
because he needs more time to write a state
ment explaining his decision.
One of the letters, signed by eight members
of the University community, asked Kennedy to
delay a decision on the proposal until he has
had a chance to meet in an "open forum" with
representatives opposing the project. The

other letter, signed by a number of staff and
faculty members at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) and SSRL, asks Ken
nedy to "meet with the SLAC/SSRL community
to exchange information and concerns."
Kennedy met privately for 45 minutes with
five faculty members, staff members and stu
dents yesterday afternoon to discuss the proj
ect and his reasons for issuing a statement two
weeks ago pledging non-interference if it is ac
cepted.
Miller charged at the meeting that the re
search proposal is inconsistent with the Uni
versity's statement of principles concerning re
search, according to Adelstein. The statement
said that the "principles ... in no way di
minish, and indeed they reinforce, the indi
vidual researcher's personal responsibility to
assure that the sources of funding for his re
search, and its perceived applications, are con
sistent with his own judgement and con
science."
According to Adelstein, Kennedy told Miller
to take the charge to the Faculty Senate's
Committee on Research.
Carrying signs decrying the research plan,
the crowd listened to 45 minutes of speeches by

James, Miller, Harris and Political Science Prof.
Charles Drekmeier. Then, at the urging of
lames, they marched to Kennedy's office in the
inner quad, gathering outside his door while
Harris, lames and Miller presented the letters
to Phyllis Stephens, an office administrator in
the president's office. Kennedy was away from
the office.
Harris said he opposed the fact that no Stan
ford scientist is involved in sponsoring the
project, which is being offered by Lawrence
Livermore, Sandia and Los Alamos National
Laboratories He also said the proposal would
involve the ".ictive collaboration of hundreds
of people at SI.AC" who oppose the work which
would take place. 14e also opposed the end use
proposal, which would help research on nu
clear weapon-pumped X-ray lasers, a type of
space-based Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM).
Drekmeier urged Kennedy to "avoid the em
barassment that Lawrence Livermore has pro
vided to the University of California" because
of the weapons laboratory's strong connection
with the University.
"Let's avoid a similar albatross," he said. "We
can no longer afford to allow science to be
amoral or apolitical."
