A typical Stanford alumnus will advise you to re
member the names of the people in your class. Some of
them, the alumnus will say, are going to become world
leaders.
If you go into a typical dorm, though, you will be
tempted to tell the Stanford alumnus that he is crazy. It
seems very unlikely that the guy you see waking up at 11
every morning, or the girl you see watching soaps every
day are going to become world leaders.
It is true, however, that Stanford people do well in the
world. I thought it would be interesting, therefore, to
guess what some of the world's truly memorable people
would be like if they were at Stanford.
Michelangelo — If the great Italian artist were here, he
would be the leader of a campaign to remove all of the
weird structures that are lying around campus. He then
would receive grants from the Art Department to deco
rate the ceiling of Maples Pavillion, and maybe even to
build a magnificant 30-toot statue of Dean Fred in White
Plaza.
Christopher Colombus — The famous man who dis
covered America would be one of the guys who always
tells every one that they should go to San Francisco.
There's a bigworld outside of Stanford," he would say.
"Everybody should explore it." He would tell incredible
stories about the huge hills in San Francisco, but most
students, especially those from the East, would not be
lieve him.
Plato — The great philosopher who wrote the Repub
lic and who advocated a life of moderation would be an
RA in a freshman dorm like Branner or Donner. At the
first house meeting he would tell the students that the
house government should consist of the best and wisest
persons in the dorm. He would also counsel them about
school, telling them that in their first year they should
only take math and science classes. Complete equality
between the sexes would be another policy Plato the RA
would advocate. After his talk, a freshman from the back
would yell out, 'Ah, have a beer Platoand take it easy."
The lounge stereo would be turned on, the freshmen
would start to dance and Plato would go back to his
room, hoping that some wise freshman would come to
him for advice.
Mohandas Gandhi — The great man who led India's
move for independence, and later became the most
talked-about man in Hollywood, would be an offensive
tackle for the football team. Because of his ideas about
non-violence, though, he would refuse to block oppos
ing players who rushed the quarterback. Other tackles
would adopt his ways, and the Stanford football team
would have nobody blocking for the quarterback.
From the way this past season went, I'd say we may
have another Gandhi in our midst.
Cleopatra — If the queen of Egypt from 69-30 B.C. were
here, she would probably be the head of one of the
sororities, and she would be going out with the head of
one of the fraternities. After convincing the frat to
change its name to that of the sorority, she would go out
with the editor of the Daily (if it was a man), the captain
of the football team, the male members of the COP, her
chemistry TA and anyone else who could advance her.
During the graduation ceremonies of her senior year,
she would find out that she was going to be crowned
Queen of the Class. During the ceremony, however, just
as she would say, "I want to thank all the men who
helped me to get on top," somebody from the Office of
the Registrar would come forward and say that Cleo had
only completed 14 units of work in her four years at
Stanford.
She would leave the ceremony in tears, fly to Southern
California, and there become a waitress in a late-night
diner.
Ts'ai Lun — The great theologian who lived in Rome
around 400 A.D. and who wrote "Confessions" would
be a Delt and would be one of the biggest partiers on
campus. In the back of his mind, though, he would

wonder whether it was right that beer and women were
the two most important things in his life. One day in the
spring ot his senior year, he would run up to the dish,
and there he would havea religious experience. Itwould
be afternoon, and there would be nothing around but
grass, cows and a bright sun. At one point, while staring
at the sun, he would suddenly feel that there was a
special connection between him and the universe. He
would realize that his special mission in life was to tell
everyone else that they too had special connections.
Running back to his frat at incredible speed, he would
prepare in his mind the way he would describe this
connection to his frat brothers.
Upon entering into his house, though, he would see
Frog Pond delivering five kegs, the kartoonz setting up
to play at that night's party and five messages on his door
from girls at Lagunita who wanted him to come to their
party.
"Blow it off," he would say to himself. "I'm gonna
have a beer."
Remember that it took St. Augustine a long time be
fore he discovered the religious life.
William Shakespeare — The great British playwright
and poet, if he were at Stanford, would havea roommate
who was having a secret affair with a girl in the dorm. He
would see the torment that his roommate was putting
the girl through. She would love the roommate much
more than he loved her. Shakespeare would say to his
roommate, "Need must I tell thee. I weep a sorrow upon
sight of this treatment worthy of spiders." The room
mate would be unable to understand what Shakespeare
was talking about.

If the queen of Egypt from 69-30 B.C.
were here, she would probably be the
head of one of the sororities, and she
would be going out with the head of
one of the fraternities.

Months would pass, and finally the girl would drop the
roommate and find somebody else. Of course, the
roommate would at this point realize his affections for
her. It would be too late, though.
One night Shakespeare would hear the roommate
during one of his soliloquies say to himself, "To be a jerk
or not to be a jerk: that is the question."
Shakespeare would write a classic play about the
whole thing.
Napoleon Bonaparte — The very famous, very short
French conquerer would make his most profound effect
upon Stanford during field day during his freshman
orientation. Napoleon would immediately resent all the
very tall freshmen in his dorm, but he would resent the
tall freshmen in other dorms even more. Thus during
activities like volleyball or pyramid-building, he would
rally all of his comrades and his dorm would win all the
events.
During fall quarter of his freshman year, Napoleon
would start a political group called "The New Repub~
lies." The group would try to overthrow the Council of
Presidents. As soon as Napoleon realized that in order to
get involved in Stanford politics he had to attend ASSU
Senate meetings, though, he would realize that it wasn't
worth the effort. He would drop politics and become a
pre-med.
There you have my ideas about what famous people
would be like at Stanford. If you have any complaints,
please write me. I always love constructive cristicism.
And I even promise to send you a response, just send
your letters to MICHAEL: USA. And don't forget to in
clude a return address.

as she would say, "I want to thank all the men who
helped me to get on top," somebody from the Office of
the Registrar would come forward and say that Cleo had
only completed 14 units of work in her four years at
Stanford.
She would leave the ceremony in tears, fly to Southern
California, and there become a waitress in a late-night
diner.
Ts'ai Lun — The great theologian who lived in Rome
around 400 A.D. and who wrote "Confessions" would
be a Delt and would be one of the biggest partiers on
campus. In the back of his mind, though, he would

wonder whether it was right that beer and women were
the two most important things in his life. One day in the
spring ot his senior year, he would run up to the dish,
and there he would havea religious experience. Itwould
be afternoon, and there would be nothing around but
grass, cows and a bright sun. At one point, while staring
at the sun, he would suddenly feel that there was a
special connection between him and the universe. He
would realize that his special mission in life was to tell
everyone else that they too had special connections.
Running back to his frat at incredible speed, he would
prepare in his mind the way he would describe this
connection to his frat brothers.
Upon entering into his house, though, he would see
Frog Pond delivering five kegs, the kartoonz setting up
to play at that night's party and five messages on his door
from girls at Lagunita who wanted him to come to their
party.
"Blow it off," he would say to himself. "I'm gonna
have a beer."
Remember that it took St. Augustine a long time be
fore he discovered the religious life.
William Shakespeare — The great British playwright
and poet, if he were at Stanford, would havea roommate
who was having a secret affair with a girl in the dorm. He
would see the torment that his roommate was putting
the girl through. She would love the roommate much
more than he loved her. Shakespeare would say to his
roommate, "Need must I tell thee. I weep a sorrow upon
sight of this treatment worthy of spiders." The room
mate would be unable to understand what Shakespeare
was talking about.

If the queen of Egypt from 69-30 B.C.
were here, she would probably be the
head of one of the sororities, and she
would be going out with the head of
one of the fraternities.

Months would pass, and finally the girl would drop the
roommate and find somebody else. Of course, the
roommate would at this point realize his affections for
her. It would be too late, though.
One night Shakespeare would hear the roommate
during one of his soliloquies say to himself, "To be a jerk
or not to be a jerk: that is the question."
Shakespeare would write a classic play about the
whole thing.
Napoleon Bonaparte — The very famous, very short
French conquerer would make his most profound effect
upon Stanford during field day during his freshman
orientation. Napoleon would immediately resent all the
very tall freshmen in his dorm, but he would resent the
tall freshmen in other dorms even more. Thus during
activities like volleyball or pyramid-building, he would
rally all of his comrades and his dorm would win all the
events.
During fall quarter of his freshman year, Napoleon
would start a political group called "The New Repub~
lies." The group would try to overthrow the Council of
Presidents. As soon as Napoleon realized that in order to
get involved in Stanford politics he had to attend ASSU
Senate meetings, though, he would realize that it wasn't
worth the effort. He would drop politics and become a
pre-med.
There you have my ideas about what famous people
would be like at Stanford. If you have any complaints,
please write me. I always love constructive cristicism.
And I even promise to send you a response, just send
your letters to MICHAEL: USA. And don't forget to in
clude a return address.

A typical Stanford alumnus will advise you to re
member the names of the people in your class. Some of
them, the alumnus will say, are going to become world
leaders.
If you go into a typical dorm, though, you will be
tempted to tell the Stanford alumnus that he is crazy. It
seems very unlikely that the guy you see waking up at 11
every morning, or the girl you see watching soaps every
day are going to become world leaders.
It is true, however, that Stanford people do well in the
world. I thought it would be interesting, therefore, to
guess what some of the world's truly memorable people
would be like if they were at Stanford.
Michelangelo — If the great Italian artist were here, he
would be the leader of a campaign to remove all of the
weird structures that are lying around campus. He then
would receive grants from the Art Department to deco
rate the ceiling of Maples Pavillion, and maybe even to
build a magnificant 30-toot statue of Dean Fred in White
Plaza.
Christopher Colombus — The famous man who dis
covered America would be one of the guys who always
tells every one that they should go to San Francisco.
There's a bigworld outside of Stanford," he would say.
"Everybody should explore it." He would tell incredible
stories about the huge hills in San Francisco, but most
students, especially those from the East, would not be
lieve him.
Plato — The great philosopher who wrote the Repub
lic and who advocated a life of moderation would be an
RA in a freshman dorm like Branner or Donner. At the
first house meeting he would tell the students that the
house government should consist of the best and wisest
persons in the dorm. He would also counsel them about
school, telling them that in their first year they should
only take math and science classes. Complete equality
between the sexes would be another policy Plato the RA
would advocate. After his talk, a freshman from the back
would yell out, 'Ah, have a beer Platoand take it easy."
The lounge stereo would be turned on, the freshmen
would start to dance and Plato would go back to his
room, hoping that some wise freshman would come to
him for advice.
Mohandas Gandhi — The great man who led India's
move for independence, and later became the most
talked-about man in Hollywood, would be an offensive
tackle for the football team. Because of his ideas about
non-violence, though, he would refuse to block oppos
ing players who rushed the quarterback. Other tackles
would adopt his ways, and the Stanford football team
would have nobody blocking for the quarterback.
From the way this past season went, I'd say we may
have another Gandhi in our midst.
Cleopatra — If the queen of Egypt from 69-30 B.C. were
here, she would probably be the head of one of the
sororities, and she would be going out with the head of
one of the fraternities. After convincing the frat to
change its name to that of the sorority, she would go out
with the editor of the Daily (if it was a man), the captain
of the football team, the male members of the COP, her
chemistry TA and anyone else who could advance her.
During the graduation ceremonies of her senior year,
she would find out that she was going to be crowned
Queen of the Class. During the ceremony, however, just
as she would say, "I want to thank all the men who
helped me to get on top," somebody from the Office of
