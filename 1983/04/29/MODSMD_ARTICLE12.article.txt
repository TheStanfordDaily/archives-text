## Pawning the golden torch of wisdom 
### 
Stanford students, like students all over the
country, seem in a perpetual state of worry over
getting a job. They race to send out resumes
before January for a summer job. They plan their
major according to projected careers in various
technical and professional fields. They take
courses that bore them because "It looks good
on the record" and it makes them "hireable."
They devote much of their time and energy in a
place of learning not so much to the enterprise of
learning as to the crafting of a careful record of
what they have learned. Perhaps, one should
say, they craft a record of the courses they have
taken, which many consider more or less an
index of what they have learned.
Where is the joy in such an undergraduate
enterprise? Where is the intellectual excitement?
Instead of delighting in a new perspective or a
small revelation, the student anxious over the
status of a transcript at most looks forward to
another A. The uncertain outcome on an exam
brings forth more doubt and anxiety than any
questioning of society's fundamental values or
one's place and purpose in this society. The en
tire process of education becomes "adduca
tion," leading along towards some predeter
mined goal, rather than a leading of students out
from the confines of their individual lives and
histories to a larger understanding of man and
his condition.
When freshmen enter with a coherent and de
fined four-year plan for getting into law or medi
cal school or getting a top-paying engineering
job, they doubtless operate with great efficiency
to take the courses and get the grades they need.
But what do they miss along the way? How do
they quantify the erosion of spirit and curiosity,

the slow growth of antipathy to purely intellec
tual pursuit, the covert and sometimes quite
open resentment.they develop against a system
which demands continual sacrifice of small and
large things for the all-important goal of being
allowed to play the game of life after college? Can
these losses of intangibles, which stunt intellec
tual growth as surely as poor diet stunts physical
growth, be equated with a five- or six-digit salary
somewhere down the road of success?
A popular explanation of student concentra
tion on profitable and hireable majors says that
an uncertain economy prompts many to seek job
security through higher education. If this be the
case, then many students here are at the wrong
place. Those who want technical skills for use in
the business world should be at a technical or
business school, not at a university where they
pretend to get a liberal education. Those who
want good grades to get into a professional
school should stay close to home, attend a less
expensive college and study all the time to be top
in their class.
The world is not a certain place; there is no
such thing as job security. Higher education is
not meant to aid in the pursuit of such a chimera,
but to train thoughtful men and women to have a
sense of what is larger than themselves and their
personal ambitions. Society expects educated
people to lead it precisely because society de
pends upon them to take a larger view, to bring a
broader perspective to the individual problems
that confront its individual members and to see
among seemingly singular events the connec
tions which technical and specialized training
can obscure for those laboring in a small corner
of the world.

I do not dispute the necessity of learning and
using skills in the working world, only the em
phasis on training for a job or profession to the
exclusion of becoming educated. Education is
not something bestowed upon a student at
Commencement ceremonies: It is a state of
mind, a way of looking at the world, a process
which should not end until death. It requires
practice, hard work and a willingness to embark
on intellectual journeys without certainty of
whither the path leads.
The future lies uncertain before us all. The
intelligent men and women who are admitted
each year to Stanford and who turn away from
the challenge, who pretend that they can cir
cumvent the uncertainty, who decline Stanford's
offer of a chance to start a lifelong process of
liberal self-education in favor of a curriculum
well-wrought to gain admission to professional
schools or entry into a comfortable corporate
nest, these students act in a cowardly and dis
honest fashion. They spurn the University's
scholarly enterprise and take only its name and
reputation.
Students are offered a chance to grow, to ex
pand their interests; an opportunity, unfettered
by the concerns of earning a living, to explore
new ideas, to be unsettled by new ideas, to fall in
love with ideas they never thought of before.
What engineering major is studying because he
loves engineering? What biology major, because
he loves biology? Stanford students harbor little
intellectual passion, only gray, tight-lipped en
durance and the grim determination to put up
with it all for the pot of gold at the end.
