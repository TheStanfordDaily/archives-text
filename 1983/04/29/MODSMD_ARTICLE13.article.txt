## Apathetic Daily hurt anti-sexism week 
### 
If the Daily editorial board is truly
among the members of the commu
nity who believe "sexism still
abounds in society today" ("Apathy
works for sexism," Daily, April 22),
where were all the reporters during
Working Against Sexism Week? The
editorial states, "The activities . . .
were well organized, well adver
tised, and well run; the main disap
pointment of the event was its failure
to attract a major segment of the

Stanford community." It is common
knowledge that the media play a
major part in influencing the number
of people who attend such events.
The media are also the best publicity.
When the community paper ignores
an event, so do many members of the
community.
The editorial, itself, states that
those who didn't attend are "the
people who don't believe or don t
care that sexism exists today, the

people that lie at the root of sexism."
Is the Daily incriminating itself?
The week received substantial
coverage in the Peninsula Times
Tribune. The Daily graced us with
two photographs, no text. The first
photograph was submitted by one of
the organizers. The second appeared
after the final event of the week. Why
was no one there to cover the panel
discussion on sexual harassment, an
c.cni dilcnded by several hundred

people?
The title of the editorial mentions
apathy; the closing sentence men
tions the importance of action. The
week's organizers took action. I
hope the Daily, in the future, will do
the same.
