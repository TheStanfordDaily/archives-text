## McCloskey: class with class 
### 
As a member of former con
gressman Paul "Pete" McCloskey's
controversial class, 'The Congres
sional Decision Making process," let
me first commend the editors of the
Daily for choosing the very approp
riate title of "Bollard's eye-view"
to describe Steve Mitchel's perspec
tive in his column (Daily, April 21).
For those of you who are freshman
and don't know what a bollard is,
bollards are those silly looking ce
ment posts that are stuck in the
ground, which always get in your way
when you're trying to ride your bike.
They never move from where they
are planted regardless of if there
were a snowstorm, earthquake or
nuclear attack.
In his column, Mitchel expresses
his views, which are characteristic of
those of a few individuals who seem
to have some compelling personal
need to emotionally and irrationally
discredit McCloskey's legitimacy as
a professor and a human being.
The first point Mitchel makes is
that of the class' publicity. Referring
to the controversial publicity the
course has received, he claims that:
. .anyone who didn't know that
McCloskey was going to teach a class
here probably also doesn't know that
)ohn Elway quarterbacked the foot
ball team, or that the tall, skinny
building in the center of campus is
called Hoover Tower." Mitchel's
analogy, however, overlooks the
fundamental difference between
publicity about the petty squabbles
plaguing McCloskey's course and
publicity regarding the course's es
sential logistical information (e.g. its
meeting place, time, days, etc.)
As a senior, Mitchel should be
aware that most students primarily
use what's originally printed in the
Time Schedule to figure out their
course load for the next quarter. He
should know that flyers posted
around campus are usually promptly
blown down by the wind, torn down
by drunk freshmen coming back
from rush parties, or destroyed by
mad Food Service hashers. Further

more, Mitchel should know that the
only time anyone ever looks at the
"Time Schedule Changes" is when
they rush to their first class, only to
find the lecture hall either empty or
full of old people wearing "Stanford"
nametagsand listening to music. But
the best evidence of the lack of
adequate publicity regarding the es
sential logistical information of
McCloskey's class is Mitchel's ignor
ance of the fact that the class no
longer meets in Bishop Auditorium. It
meets in room 200-203 of the History
Corner. In short, probably just as few
people know of the class' essential
logistical information as do people
know the exact locations and dates of
all of the games in which ]ohn Elway
quarterbacked or what really goes on
inside of Hoover Tower.
Mitchel also presents a distorted
picture of the nature of McCloskey's
class. There are about 50 students in
the class, which according to the
Political Science Department, is an
average size for a political science
class. Furthermore, although "less
than 1 percent of the undergrad
uates at Stanford are enrolled in
McCloskey's course," with Stan
ford's undergraduate population of
6563 students, this appalling
phenomenon is true for most Poli Sci
courses. But most importantly,
Mitchel (probably because he is not
in the class) overlooks the fact that
McCloskey's class is truly one of
first-rate quality. I personally believe
that it is one of the most informative
and enjoyable classes that I have
taken here at Stanford. I further be
lieve that if those individuals who are
so afraid that McCloskey's course is
"unbalanced" would just sit in on a
few classes, they would find that
their fears are totally unfounded.
McCloskey's Socratic method of
questioning students forces us to
express our own opinions — if we
have them or not. He repeatedly en
courages us to "question (our) el
ders." Finally, McCloskey's selection
of guest lecturers reflects his
genuine effort to provide us with a
balanced perspective. Although
McCloskey supports the idea of re
turning to a military draft, his guest
lecturers have included David Harris,
the first person to ever publicly burn
his draft card, Reagan adviser Martin
Anderson, who was one of the
"leading architects" of the "All-
Volunteer Army."
McCloskey strongly opposed the
Nixon Administration regarding the

Watergate atfair. He has, however,
scheduled John Ehrlichman, one of
Nixon's top aides, to come to speak.
McCloskey is even trying to get the
Israeli Consul-Ceneral of San Fran
cisco to come as a guest lecturer.
In his column, Mitchel attempts to
irrationally and emotionally assassi
nate McCloskey's personal charac
ter. Mitchel alleges that McCloskey
. . thrives on controversy. . . Pete
McCloskey's positions are presented
to promote Pete McCloskey."
Mitchel complains that McCloskey
. . spoke out against Vietnam in
1967, challenged Nixon in 1972, and
later called for Nixon's impeach
ment." I don't know if Mitchel sup
ported the U.S. involvement in Viet
nam and the corruption of the Nixon
administration , but I do know that it
was only the courageous efforts of
people like McCloskey that brought
an end to these two tragedies of
American history.
Mitchel also belabors the point
that although McCloskey supports
the creation of a Palestinian home
land on the West Bank, he
. . couldn't even point to the West
Bank on an unmarked map." Big
dealW All I know is that I was born
and raised in Honolulu for 19 years,
and I still can't point out my own
homeland on a map of Hawaii —
marked or unmarked. But most im
portantly it was NOT McCloskey, but
rather Congressman Merv Dymally
that in fact failed Prime Minister Be
gin's West Bank Geography Tes/.
Although Mitchel makes the ptu
found observation that "While the
professor that studies a topic and is
not afraid to take an unpopular stand
is admirable, the ex-congressman
who does not research his topic and
takes the unpopular stand to grab a
headline is not admirable," Mitchel
erroneously applies it to describe
McCloskey. I would further argue
that such an observation could also
possibly be used to describe Daily
columnists. With no offense to the
Biz School, I strongly agree with
Mitchel's assertion the"the road to
intellectual fulfillment does not pass
through Bishop Auditorium on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thurs
days," for it in fact passes through
room 200-203 of the History Corner.
Finally, I'd like to ask Mitchel if HE
can point out the meeting place of
McCloskey's class on a map of Stan
ford — marked or unmarked.

have them or not. He repeatedly en
courages us to "question (our) el
ders." Finally, McCloskey's selection
of guest lecturers reflects his
genuine effort to provide us with a
balanced perspective. Although
McCloskey supports the idea of re
turning to a military draft, his guest
lecturers have included David Harris,
the first person to ever publicly burn
his draft card, Reagan adviser Martin
Anderson, who was one of the
"leading architects" of the "All-
Volunteer Army."
McCloskey strongly opposed the
Nixon Administration regarding the

Watergate atfair. He has, however,
scheduled John Ehrlichman, one of
Nixon's top aides, to come to speak.
McCloskey is even trying to get the
Israeli Consul-Ceneral of San Fran
cisco to come as a guest lecturer.
In his column, Mitchel attempts to
irrationally and emotionally assassi
nate McCloskey's personal charac
ter. Mitchel alleges that McCloskey
. . thrives on controversy. . . Pete
McCloskey's positions are presented
to promote Pete McCloskey."
Mitchel complains that McCloskey
. . spoke out against Vietnam in
1967, challenged Nixon in 1972, and
later called for Nixon's impeach
ment." I don't know if Mitchel sup
ported the U.S. involvement in Viet
nam and the corruption of the Nixon
administration , but I do know that it
was only the courageous efforts of
people like McCloskey that brought
an end to these two tragedies of
American history.
Mitchel also belabors the point
that although McCloskey supports
the creation of a Palestinian home
land on the West Bank, he
. . couldn't even point to the West
Bank on an unmarked map." Big
dealW All I know is that I was born
and raised in Honolulu for 19 years,
and I still can't point out my own
homeland on a map of Hawaii —
marked or unmarked. But most im
portantly it was NOT McCloskey, but
rather Congressman Merv Dymally
that in fact failed Prime Minister Be
gin's West Bank Geography Tes/.
Although Mitchel makes the ptu
found observation that "While the
professor that studies a topic and is
not afraid to take an unpopular stand
is admirable, the ex-congressman
who does not research his topic and
takes the unpopular stand to grab a
headline is not admirable," Mitchel
erroneously applies it to describe
McCloskey. I would further argue
that such an observation could also
possibly be used to describe Daily
columnists. With no offense to the
Biz School, I strongly agree with
Mitchel's assertion the"the road to
intellectual fulfillment does not pass
through Bishop Auditorium on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thurs
days," for it in fact passes through
room 200-203 of the History Corner.
Finally, I'd like to ask Mitchel if HE
can point out the meeting place of
McCloskey's class on a map of Stan
ford — marked or unmarked.

As a member of former con
gressman Paul "Pete" McCloskey's
controversial class, 'The Congres
sional Decision Making process," let
me first commend the editors of the
Daily for choosing the very approp
riate title of "Bollard's eye-view"
to describe Steve Mitchel's perspec
tive in his column (Daily, April 21).
For those of you who are freshman
and don't know what a bollard is,
bollards are those silly looking ce
ment posts that are stuck in the
ground, which always get in your way
when you're trying to ride your bike.
They never move from where they
are planted regardless of if there
were a snowstorm, earthquake or
nuclear attack.
In his column, Mitchel expresses
his views, which are characteristic of
those of a few individuals who seem
to have some compelling personal
need to emotionally and irrationally
discredit McCloskey's legitimacy as
a professor and a human being.
The first point Mitchel makes is
that of the class' publicity. Referring
to the controversial publicity the
course has received, he claims that:
. .anyone who didn't know that
McCloskey was going to teach a class
here probably also doesn't know that
)ohn Elway quarterbacked the foot
ball team, or that the tall, skinny
building in the center of campus is
called Hoover Tower." Mitchel's
analogy, however, overlooks the
fundamental difference between
publicity about the petty squabbles
plaguing McCloskey's course and
publicity regarding the course's es
sential logistical information (e.g. its
meeting place, time, days, etc.)
As a senior, Mitchel should be
aware that most students primarily
use what's originally printed in the
Time Schedule to figure out their
course load for the next quarter. He
should know that flyers posted
around campus are usually promptly
blown down by the wind, torn down
by drunk freshmen coming back
from rush parties, or destroyed by
mad Food Service hashers. Further

more, Mitchel should know that the
only time anyone ever looks at the
"Time Schedule Changes" is when
they rush to their first class, only to
find the lecture hall either empty or
full of old people wearing "Stanford"
nametagsand listening to music. But
the best evidence of the lack of
adequate publicity regarding the es
sential logistical information of
McCloskey's class is Mitchel's ignor
ance of the fact that the class no
longer meets in Bishop Auditorium. It
meets in room 200-203 of the History
Corner. In short, probably just as few
people know of the class' essential
logistical information as do people
know the exact locations and dates of
all of the games in which ]ohn Elway
quarterbacked or what really goes on
inside of Hoover Tower.
Mitchel also presents a distorted
picture of the nature of McCloskey's
class. There are about 50 students in
the class, which according to the
Political Science Department, is an
average size for a political science
class. Furthermore, although "less
than 1 percent of the undergrad
uates at Stanford are enrolled in
McCloskey's course," with Stan
ford's undergraduate population of
6563 students, this appalling
phenomenon is true for most Poli Sci
courses. But most importantly,
Mitchel (probably because he is not
in the class) overlooks the fact that
McCloskey's class is truly one of
first-rate quality. I personally believe
that it is one of the most informative
and enjoyable classes that I have
taken here at Stanford. I further be
lieve that if those individuals who are
so afraid that McCloskey's course is
"unbalanced" would just sit in on a
few classes, they would find that
their fears are totally unfounded.
McCloskey's Socratic method of
questioning students forces us to
express our own opinions — if we
have them or not. He repeatedly en
courages us to "question (our) el
ders." Finally, McCloskey's selection
