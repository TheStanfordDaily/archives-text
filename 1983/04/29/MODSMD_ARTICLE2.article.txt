# Faculty members submit petition for Hoover Institution inquiry
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
A faculty petition urging an im
mediate inquiry by the board of trus
tees into the relationship between
the University and the Hoover In
stitution was filed yesterday with the
academic secretary. Sixty-six mem
bers of the academic council signed
the petition, which is aimed at plac
ing a resolution on the Faculty Senate
agenda and asks the trustees to in
vestigate Hoover's alleged partisan
ship.
The petition chargesthat "theexis
tence of a politically partisan re
search institute, whether liberal or
conservative, within the University,
raises grave questions concerning
academic independence" and the
University's reputation.
Fifty signatures were needed to
bring the issue up for debate before
the Faculty Senate. The senate will
meet May 12.
"The purpose of the inquiry,"
Political Science Prof, john Manley
said yesterday, "is to discuss these
issues in a appropriate forum, to lay
the facts on the table, and to let the
community decide what steps to
take." Manley helped draft the peti
tion.
Among the "grave questions"

Manley hopes to see debated are the
extent of Hoover's political involve
ment with Stanford, and also the ex
tent of the institution's financial in
volvement with the University.
A number of faculty members con
tacted by the Daily indicated they
signed the petition because they felt
it was time for a general inquiry into
Hoover's overall role within the Uni
versity.
University Provost Albert Hastorf
expressed a similar interest in the
subject's being brought up for de
bate. "The issue is worth the faculty's
talking about it — it is worth the dis
cussion of the entire community,"
he said.
English Prof. Anne Mellor com
mented, when asked by the Daily
why she had signed the petition, on
the financial aspects of the relation
ship. The issue seems to be "the de
gree to which the funds the Univer
sity gives to Hoover are spent be
yond the Hoover Library," she said.
Others contacted said they felt it
was simply time to "re-examine"
Hoover's relationship to the Univer
sity. "Obviously, Hoover has
changed a lot in the past years — the
University has changed also," Me
chanical Engineering Prof. Bernie
Roth said.

According to Roth, the Faculty-
Senate has tended to overlook
Hoover in the past.
Faculty members who are con
cerned about Hoover's role make a
number of complaints about the ac
tivities and position of Hoover at
Stanford.
Among the issues raised:
•That Hoover is a "politically parti
san" organization within the Univer
sity.
•That Hoover enjoys a "hazy,
quasi-independent" status — its re
search fellows are not subject to the
University academic hiring process.
•That Hoover is a "two-tiered" or
ganization — comprised of an inner
core of policy advocates made re
spectable by an outer ring of profes
sional academics.
•That Hoover is creating a "two
class professoriat" — those who re
ceive research funds and benefits
from Hoover, and those who do not.
•That Hoover injects "political
criteria" into the decisions to hire re
search fellows.
•That Hoover's ties with the Re
publican Party and the Reagan ad
ministration "threaten the Universi
ty's tax-exempt status."
