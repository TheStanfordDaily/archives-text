# Japanese students experience Stanford life
## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS 
Every year the Keio Com
mittee at Stanford organizes
the springtime visit of eight
students from Keio Univer
sity in Tokyo, lapan. The
committee seeks "to prom
ote the understanding bet
ween the United States and
lapan," exposing each ex
change student to home life
with an American family, to
University life in the Stan
ford dorms and class
rooms and to cultural ac
tivities characteristic of life
in the United States. The
Keio experience allows the
exchange students to un
derstand the American cul
ture and to perceive how it
both compares to and con
trasts with the lapanese cul
ture.
The students spend a total
of nine weeks in the United
States. They arrive in late
February and live with a host
family for two weeks. Then
students spend a week and
a half in Los Angeles under
the supervision of Pomona
College. At the end of
spring break, after having
visited both Lake Tahoe and
Yosemite, they move into
Stanford dorms. The stu
dents spend the remainder
of the time on the campus,
participating in such ac
tivities as an overnight
camping trip and a culture
series discussing economic,
ethnic and global issues.
The Keio Committee, a
club designed expressly for
the exchange program, or
ganizes and coordinates all
parts of the students' stay.
The entire organization
consists of Stanford stu
dents. "It's been running
now for almost 30 years on
students' energy," said Keio
Committee President Karen
Akiyama.
The students receive their
first impression of the Un
ited States during the two
weeks that they spend with
their host families. Accord
ing to Akiyama, the host
families constitute an "im
portant part" of the prog

ram, tor they provide in
sights into home life in the
United States. Chiaki
Tazuke's family, which con
sisted of a mother and her
10-year-old daughter, gave
her a view of the life that
surrounds a child in
elementary school. She at
tended both PTA meetings
and a children's concert.
The stay with the host
family often revealed differ
ences between lapanese
and U.S. lifestyles. "At
home my Mom cooks every
thing, but here everyone
takes care of themselves,"
said Erika Hibino. "In the
morning, everyone cooks
their own breakfast."
Hibino added that she was
especially surprised "to see
my host father cleaning."
Nobunira Sera's family
had an 8-year-old daugh
ter and a 6-year-old son
"American children arevery
active," he noted. "Theyare
very independent from
their parents."
The host family not only
exemplified the habits of an
American family, but also
taught a valuable lesson in
how a family generally op
erates. Shinobu Okamoto
stayed with a young married
couple, who both had
graduated from Stanford. "I
was their only child," joked
Okamoto, but added that
she enjoyed seeing how a
young couple lived. "I
could see how they man
aged a household," she
said.
The exchange students'
experiences on the Stanford
campus consisted of audit
ing classes and living in the
dorms. Most of the students
attended three or four clas
ses a week, ranging from
lapanese literature to com
puter science. They all audit
a class entitled "Human
Sexuality." Sera explained
that the Keio Committee
urged them to take the class
to understand the more re
laxed attitude toward sexu
ality in the United States.
"We cannot have that kind

ot class in lapan," he said.
The exchange students
found living in the dorms
particularly interesting be
cause dorms, as students in
the United States know
them, do not exist in
lapan. Tazuke and Hibino
explained that most Keio
students live in their homes
in Tokyo. The women who
come from the rural areas
outside of Tokyo reside in
private dorms with a nightly
curfew of either 10 or 11
p.m.
Tazuke listed her favorite
aspect of the exchange
program to be the "daily life
in the dorm." She pointed
out that dorm life can be
educational. "You can learn
how to get along with
people and how to budget
your time and finances,"
she said.
Exposed to both campus
and family life, the students
perceived differences bet
ween the societies of lapan
and the United States. They
immediately noted the dis
tinctions between American
and Japanese eating habits.
Although many Stanford
students view hamburgers
and especially pizza as daily

staples, the Japanese usu
ally reserve such food for
snacks. "I was a little sur
prised to see Americans eat
ing hamburgers and pizzas
for dinner," Sera said.
The diet in the United
States consists of richer
foods than those that are
prepared in Japan, a change
that Takeshi Watanabe
found disconcerting. "A
mericans use a lot of
cheese," he said. "It's very
heavy for me. I miss
Japanese food, especially
udon, a Japanese noodle.
The students also saw dif
ferences in the social roles
and relationships of the two
countries. Compared to the
United States, Japan places
more restrictions on both
women and the young. Al
though women like Tazuke,
Hibinoand Okamotoattend
universities, society does
not offer equal career op
portunities to women and
men. "It's very difficult to
get a job," Hibino said.
"When we get married, we
must take care of the chil
dren and do household
chores."
Hibino also stressed that
society places a good deal of

pressure on women to
marry. Using an analogy
that compared women to
Christmas cakes, she
explained that on De
cember 23 the cakes begin
to sell well, just as women
marry frequently at the age
of 23. On the 24th and 25th
the cakes are in big demand
and women continue to
marry at the ages of 24 and
25. However, "the Christ
mas cakes don't sell well
after the 25th," Hibino said.
"Japanese women feel this
pressure. The women don't
have the financial power.
They have to rely on the
husband." Both Hibino and
Tazuke agreed that they
admired the independence
and opportunities that U.S.
women enjoy.
Some of the students also
noted a unique attitude to
ward aging in Japan. "In
America, young, strong
people dominate the coun
try. But in Japan, the older
people dominate the coun
try," Hibino said. She also
said "prestige comes with
age," suggesting that the
reverence for age perhaps
prevented Japan from rapid

social change that has oc
curred in the United States.
The domination of society
by different age groups pre
sents ramifications for both
nations. The prevalence of
the young causes a greater
degree of individuality in
the United States. All of the
exchange students agreed
that both children and
young adults depend less
on their elders. "American
people are more indepen
dent," Watanabe said.
Vet the emphasis on indi
viduality also seems to cause
superficiality. "Americans are
in a way very lonely," Tazuke
said. "People say 'hi'—but it's
hard to get down deep."
In Japan, the more con
servative social structure
can present conflicts in a na
tion that possesses a high
degree of industrial
ization. Shigeru Kashiwara
explained that the oldest
son of each family bears the
responsibility for caring for
the parents when they reach
old age. "I'm the No. 1 son. I
come from a rural area. My
father and mother expect
me to find a job near their
home," he said.

Vet Kashiwara, a senior
majoring in economics,
would prefer a job in the
metropolitan area. "There
are many international
companies in Japan," he
said. "I want to find a job in
Tokyo."
The students will return
to )apan in early May. They
will carry with them not only
a slew of purchases — in
cluding Stanford sweat
shirts, OP shorts, and
Adidas tennis shoes — but
also an understanding of life
in the United States and of
the experience of attending
Stanford.
After driving to Jack in the
Box and then suddenly pas
sing the restaurant, both
girls admitted that they be
came afraid, holding onto
each other and speaking
Japanese in low voices. "We
thought the guys were tak
ing us somewhere else,"
Hibino explained. "We
went to Denny's instead."
Both girls laugh over the
incident now. Tazuke ad
mitted that she realized that
American men were no dif
ferent from their Japanese
counterparts. "Oh, what a
relief," she said.

lapan. Tazuke and Hibino
explained that most Keio
students live in their homes
in Tokyo. The women who
come from the rural areas
outside of Tokyo reside in
private dorms with a nightly
curfew of either 10 or 11
p.m.
Tazuke listed her favorite
aspect of the exchange
program to be the "daily life
in the dorm." She pointed
out that dorm life can be
educational. "You can learn
how to get along with
people and how to budget
your time and finances,"
she said.
Exposed to both campus
and family life, the students
perceived differences bet
ween the societies of lapan
and the United States. They
immediately noted the dis
tinctions between American
and Japanese eating habits.
Although many Stanford
students view hamburgers
and especially pizza as daily

staples, the Japanese usu
ally reserve such food for
snacks. "I was a little sur
prised to see Americans eat
ing hamburgers and pizzas
for dinner," Sera said.
The diet in the United
States consists of richer
foods than those that are
prepared in Japan, a change
that Takeshi Watanabe
found disconcerting. "A
mericans use a lot of
cheese," he said. "It's very
heavy for me. I miss
Japanese food, especially
udon, a Japanese noodle.
The students also saw dif
ferences in the social roles
and relationships of the two
countries. Compared to the
United States, Japan places
more restrictions on both
women and the young. Al
though women like Tazuke,
Hibinoand Okamotoattend
universities, society does
not offer equal career op
portunities to women and
men. "It's very difficult to
get a job," Hibino said.
"When we get married, we
must take care of the chil
dren and do household
chores."
Hibino also stressed that
society places a good deal of

pressure on women to
marry. Using an analogy
that compared women to
Christmas cakes, she
explained that on De
cember 23 the cakes begin
to sell well, just as women
marry frequently at the age
of 23. On the 24th and 25th
the cakes are in big demand
and women continue to
marry at the ages of 24 and
25. However, "the Christ
mas cakes don't sell well
after the 25th," Hibino said.
"Japanese women feel this
pressure. The women don't
have the financial power.
They have to rely on the
husband." Both Hibino and
Tazuke agreed that they
admired the independence
and opportunities that U.S.
women enjoy.
Some of the students also
noted a unique attitude to
ward aging in Japan. "In
America, young, strong
people dominate the coun
try. But in Japan, the older
people dominate the coun
try," Hibino said. She also
said "prestige comes with
age," suggesting that the
reverence for age perhaps
prevented Japan from rapid

social change that has oc
curred in the United States.
The domination of society
by different age groups pre
sents ramifications for both
nations. The prevalence of
the young causes a greater
degree of individuality in
the United States. All of the
exchange students agreed
that both children and
young adults depend less
on their elders. "American
people are more indepen
dent," Watanabe said.
Vet the emphasis on indi
viduality also seems to cause
superficiality. "Americans are
in a way very lonely," Tazuke
said. "People say 'hi'—but it's
hard to get down deep."
In Japan, the more con
servative social structure
can present conflicts in a na
tion that possesses a high
degree of industrial
ization. Shigeru Kashiwara
explained that the oldest
son of each family bears the
responsibility for caring for
the parents when they reach
old age. "I'm the No. 1 son. I
come from a rural area. My
father and mother expect
me to find a job near their
home," he said.

Vet Kashiwara, a senior
majoring in economics,
would prefer a job in the
metropolitan area. "There
are many international
companies in Japan," he
said. "I want to find a job in
Tokyo."
The students will return
to )apan in early May. They
will carry with them not only
a slew of purchases — in
cluding Stanford sweat
shirts, OP shorts, and
Adidas tennis shoes — but
also an understanding of life
in the United States and of
the experience of attending
Stanford.
After driving to Jack in the
Box and then suddenly pas
sing the restaurant, both
girls admitted that they be
came afraid, holding onto
each other and speaking
Japanese in low voices. "We
thought the guys were tak
ing us somewhere else,"
Hibino explained. "We
went to Denny's instead."
Both girls laugh over the
incident now. Tazuke ad
mitted that she realized that
American men were no dif
ferent from their Japanese
counterparts. "Oh, what a
relief," she said.

JAPANESE VISITORS: The Keio Committee student visitors Shigeru Kashiwara, Erika Hibino, Takeshi Watanabe, Shinobu Okamoto, Nobohiru Seru, and
Cniake Tazuke.
Every year the Keio Com
mittee at Stanford organizes
the springtime visit of eight
students from Keio Univer
sity in Tokyo, lapan. The
committee seeks "to prom
ote the understanding bet
ween the United States and
lapan," exposing each ex
change student to home life
with an American family, to
University life in the Stan
ford dorms and class
rooms and to cultural ac
tivities characteristic of life
in the United States. The
Keio experience allows the
exchange students to un
derstand the American cul
ture and to perceive how it
both compares to and con
trasts with the lapanese cul
ture.
The students spend a total
of nine weeks in the United
States. They arrive in late
February and live with a host
family for two weeks. Then
students spend a week and
a half in Los Angeles under
the supervision of Pomona
College. At the end of
spring break, after having
visited both Lake Tahoe and
Yosemite, they move into
Stanford dorms. The stu
dents spend the remainder
of the time on the campus,
participating in such ac
tivities as an overnight
camping trip and a culture
series discussing economic,
ethnic and global issues.
The Keio Committee, a
club designed expressly for
the exchange program, or
ganizes and coordinates all
parts of the students' stay.
The entire organization
consists of Stanford stu
dents. "It's been running
now for almost 30 years on
students' energy," said Keio
Committee President Karen
Akiyama.
The students receive their
first impression of the Un
ited States during the two
weeks that they spend with
their host families. Accord
ing to Akiyama, the host
families constitute an "im
portant part" of the prog

ram, tor they provide in
sights into home life in the
United States. Chiaki
Tazuke's family, which con
sisted of a mother and her
10-year-old daughter, gave
her a view of the life that
surrounds a child in
elementary school. She at
tended both PTA meetings
and a children's concert.
The stay with the host
family often revealed differ
ences between lapanese
and U.S. lifestyles. "At
home my Mom cooks every
thing, but here everyone
takes care of themselves,"
said Erika Hibino. "In the
morning, everyone cooks
their own breakfast."
Hibino added that she was
especially surprised "to see
my host father cleaning."
Nobunira Sera's family
had an 8-year-old daugh
ter and a 6-year-old son
"American children arevery
active," he noted. "Theyare
very independent from
their parents."
The host family not only
exemplified the habits of an
American family, but also
taught a valuable lesson in
how a family generally op
erates. Shinobu Okamoto
stayed with a young married
couple, who both had
graduated from Stanford. "I
was their only child," joked
Okamoto, but added that
she enjoyed seeing how a
young couple lived. "I
could see how they man
aged a household," she
said.
The exchange students'
experiences on the Stanford
campus consisted of audit
ing classes and living in the
dorms. Most of the students
attended three or four clas
ses a week, ranging from
lapanese literature to com
puter science. They all audit
a class entitled "Human
Sexuality." Sera explained
that the Keio Committee
urged them to take the class
to understand the more re
laxed attitude toward sexu
ality in the United States.
"We cannot have that kind

ot class in lapan," he said.
The exchange students
found living in the dorms
particularly interesting be
cause dorms, as students in
the United States know
them, do not exist in
lapan. Tazuke and Hibino
explained that most Keio
students live in their homes
in Tokyo. The women who
come from the rural areas
outside of Tokyo reside in
private dorms with a nightly
curfew of either 10 or 11

old age. "I'm the No. 1 son. I
come from a rural area. My
father and mother expect
me to find a job near their
home," he said.

Vet Kashiwara, a senior
majoring in economics,
would prefer a job in the
metropolitan area. "There
are many international
companies in Japan," he
said. "I want to find a job in
Tokyo."
The students will return
to )apan in early May. They
will carry with them not only
a slew of purchases — in
cluding Stanford sweat
shirts, OP shorts, and
Adidas tennis shoes — but
also an understanding of life
in the United States and of
the experience of attending
Stanford.
After driving to Jack in the
Box and then suddenly pas
sing the restaurant, both
girls admitted that they be
came afraid, holding onto
each other and speaking
Japanese in low voices. "We
thought the guys were tak
ing us somewhere else,"
Hibino explained. "We
went to Denny's instead."
Both girls laugh over the
incident now. Tazuke ad
mitted that she realized that
American men were no dif
ferent from their Japanese
counterparts. "Oh, what a
relief," she said.

JAPANESE VISITORS: The Keio Committee student visitors Shigeru Kashiwara, Erika Hibino, Takeshi Watanabe, Shinobu Okamoto, Nobohiru Seru, and
Cniake Tazuke.
Every year the Keio Com
mittee at Stanford organizes
the springtime visit of eight
students from Keio Univer
sity in Tokyo, lapan. The
committee seeks "to prom
ote the understanding bet
ween the United States and
lapan," exposing each ex
change student to home life
with an American family, to
University life in the Stan
ford dorms and class
rooms and to cultural ac
tivities characteristic of life
in the United States. The
Keio experience allows the
exchange students to un
derstand the American cul
ture and to perceive how it
both compares to and con
trasts with the lapanese cul
ture.
The students spend a total
of nine weeks in the United
States. They arrive in late
February and live with a host
family for two weeks. Then
students spend a week and
a half in Los Angeles under
the supervision of Pomona
College. At the end of
spring break, after having
visited both Lake Tahoe and
Yosemite, they move into
Stanford dorms. The stu
dents spend the remainder
of the time on the campus,
participating in such ac
tivities as an overnight
camping trip and a culture
series discussing economic,
ethnic and global issues.
The Keio Committee, a
club designed expressly for
the exchange program, or
ganizes and coordinates all
parts of the students' stay.
The entire organization
consists of Stanford stu
dents. "It's been running
now for almost 30 years on
students' energy," said Keio
Committee President Karen
Akiyama.
The students receive their
first impression of the Un
ited States during the two
weeks that they spend with
their host families. Accord
ing to Akiyama, the host
families constitute an "im
portant part" of the prog

ram, tor they provide in
sights into home life in the
United States. Chiaki
Tazuke's family, which con
sisted of a mother and her
10-year-old daughter, gave
her a view of the life that
surrounds a child in
elementary school. She at
tended both PTA meetings
and a children's concert.
The stay with the host
family often revealed differ
ences between lapanese
and U.S. lifestyles. "At
home my Mom cooks every
thing, but here everyone
takes care of themselves,"
said Erika Hibino. "In the
morning, everyone cooks
their own breakfast."
Hibino added that she was
especially surprised "to see
my host father cleaning."
Nobunira Sera's family
had an 8-year-old daugh
ter and a 6-year-old son
"American children arevery
active," he noted. "Theyare
very independent from
their parents."
The host family not only
exemplified the habits of an
American family, but also
taught a valuable lesson in
how a family generally op
erates. Shinobu Okamoto
stayed with a young married
couple, who both had
graduated from Stanford. "I
was their only child," joked
Okamoto, but added that
she enjoyed seeing how a
young couple lived. "I
could see how they man
aged a household," she
said.
The exchange students'
experiences on the Stanford
campus consisted of audit
ing classes and living in the
dorms. Most of the students
attended three or four clas
ses a week, ranging from
lapanese literature to com
puter science. They all audit
a class entitled "Human
Sexuality." Sera explained
that the Keio Committee
urged them to take the class
to understand the more re
laxed attitude toward sexu
ality in the United States.
"We cannot have that kind

ot class in lapan," he said.
The exchange students
found living in the dorms
particularly interesting be
cause dorms, as students in
the United States know
them, do not exist in
lapan. Tazuke and Hibino
explained that most Keio
students live in their homes
in Tokyo. The women who
come from the rural areas
outside of Tokyo reside in
private dorms with a nightly
curfew of either 10 or 11
p.m.
Tazuke listed her favorite
aspect of the exchange
program to be the "daily life
in the dorm." She pointed
out that dorm life can be
educational. "You can learn
how to get along with
people and how to budget
your time and finances,"
she said.
Exposed to both campus
and family life, the students
perceived differences bet
ween the societies of lapan
and the United States. They
immediately noted the dis
tinctions between American
and Japanese eating habits.
Although many Stanford
students view hamburgers
and especially pizza as daily

staples, the Japanese usu
ally reserve such food for
snacks. "I was a little sur
prised to see Americans eat
ing hamburgers and pizzas
for dinner," Sera said.
The diet in the United
States consists of richer
foods than those that are
prepared in Japan, a change
that Takeshi Watanabe
found disconcerting. "A
mericans use a lot of
cheese," he said. "It's very
heavy for me. I miss
Japanese food, especially
udon, a Japanese noodle.
The students also saw dif
ferences in the social roles
and relationships of the two
countries. Compared to the
United States, Japan places
more restrictions on both
women and the young. Al
though women like Tazuke,
Hibinoand Okamotoattend
universities, society does
not offer equal career op
portunities to women and
men. "It's very difficult to
get a job," Hibino said.
"When we get married, we
must take care of the chil
dren and do household
chores."
Hibino also stressed that
society places a good deal of

pressure on women to
marry. Using an analogy
that compared women to
Christmas cakes, she
explained that on De
cember 23 the cakes begin
to sell well, just as women
marry frequently at the age
of 23. On the 24th and 25th
the cakes are in big demand
and women continue to
marry at the ages of 24 and
25. However, "the Christ
mas cakes don't sell well
after the 25th," Hibino said.
"Japanese women feel this
pressure. The women don't
have the financial power.
They have to rely on the
husband." Both Hibino and
Tazuke agreed that they
admired the independence
and opportunities that U.S.
women enjoy.
Some of the students also
noted a unique attitude to
ward aging in Japan. "In
America, young, strong
people dominate the coun
try. But in Japan, the older
people dominate the coun
try," Hibino said. She also
said "prestige comes with
age," suggesting that the
reverence for age perhaps
prevented Japan from rapid

social change that has oc
curred in the United States.
The domination of society
by different age groups pre
sents ramifications for both
nations. The prevalence of
the young causes a greater
degree of individuality in
the United States. All of the
exchange students agreed
that both children and
young adults depend less
on their elders. "American
people are more indepen
dent," Watanabe said.
Vet the emphasis on indi
viduality also seems to cause
superficiality. "Americans are
in a way very lonely," Tazuke
said. "People say 'hi'—but it's
hard to get down deep."
In Japan, the more con
servative social structure
can present conflicts in a na
tion that possesses a high
degree of industrial
ization. Shigeru Kashiwara
explained that the oldest
son of each family bears the
responsibility for caring for
the parents when they reach
old age. "I'm the No. 1 son. I
come from a rural area. My
father and mother expect
me to find a job near their
home," he said.

Vet Kashiwara, a senior
majoring in economics,
would prefer a job in the
metropolitan area. "There
are many international
companies in Japan," he
said. "I want to find a job in
Tokyo."
The students will return
to )apan in early May. They
will carry with them not only
a slew of purchases — in
cluding Stanford sweat
shirts, OP shorts, and
Adidas tennis shoes — but
also an understanding of life
in the United States and of
the experience of attending
Stanford.
After driving to Jack in the
Box and then suddenly pas
sing the restaurant, both
girls admitted that they be
came afraid, holding onto
each other and speaking
Japanese in low voices. "We
thought the guys were tak
ing us somewhere else,"

counterparts. "Oh, what a
relief," she said.
