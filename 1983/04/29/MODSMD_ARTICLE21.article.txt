## Men head south Netwomen dual No. 1 USC 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Today and tomorrow are two
days Stanford women's tennis
coach Frank Brennan would
not mind rain.
The No. 3-ranked Cardinal,
17-3 overall, is scheduled to
take on Pepperdine today at
1:30 p.m. and No. 1-ranked,
undefeated USC Saturday at
noon. Yesterday's scheduled
match with UC-Berkeley was
cancelled due to rain.
The men's team, meanwhile
will attempt to keep its Ib-match
winning streak going at UCLA
Friday and USC Saturday. The
Cardinal's most recent victim
was No. 2-ranked Pepperdine
in a 7-2 decision last Tuesday.
But Brennan will not be dis
appointed if rain cancels the
women's matches simply be
cause his Cardinal netters
would be spared the honor of
playing the nation's top
ranked team.
"It's been a really long sea
son for us," he said. "I don't
think we're tired, I just think
it's not a bad time for us to take
a little break."
Defending NCAA champion
Stanford has already played 20
dual matches this season and
has four more scheduled be
fore the NCAAs in Albuquer
que, N.M., May 14-22. Last

year, Brennan and company
played just 16 in the regular
season.
If the skies clear in Northern
California this weekend, Bren
nan said theTrojans, which has
four of the nation's top 34
players, are by no means invin- 1
cible.
"USC is a good team, but
they are not unbeatable. In
some of their powerhouse
years they were unbeatable,
but this year they're not."
Although the Card has lost to
the Trojans, 25-0 overall, twice
this season—both times by 5-4
scores—the most recent defeat
was close enough that it could
have gone either way.
In Saturday's USC contest,
the first four singles matches
feature seven players ranked in
the top 37 nationally. Only
Stanford freshman Alyce Wer
del, who plays at No. 3, is un
ranked.
At No. 1 singles, Elise Burgin,
the top-ranked player in the
country, is scheduled to play
fifth-rated Beth Herr of USC.
Burgin defeated Herr, who at
one time was ranked No. 1,
twice this season to gain the
top spot.
Last year, Stanford downed
the Trojans 5-4 at Stanford
Tennis Stadium.
