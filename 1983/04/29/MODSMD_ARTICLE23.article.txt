Cal and San Jose State come to the Farm this
Saturday for the 88th annual Big Meet which
features many top collegiate athletes.
"Right now my biggest concern is the rain,"
commented coach Brooks lohnson. "Cal and San
Jose both have strong squads and I am not sure
we have a strong enough dual meet squad to win.
I am hoping for some good weather and it will be
a good meet."
PattiSue Plumercomes off a fine performance
last weekend in the 3000 meters and so does
Carol Cady in the discus.

One of the meet's key events should be the
200 meters, which will feature Stanford's Fred
Williams, Cal's Roy Mosley and San )ose's Erik
Decatur.
Kevin Jones (S), Len Robinson (C) and Mark
Wilson (SJ) have all run below 14.0 this year in
the 110 meter hurdles.
San Jose will also bring pole vaulter Felix
Bohni, who has cleared 18-foot-4 outdoors this
year and is the NCAA indoor champion.
Mike White of Cal is a world class 800 meter
runner and Dave Porath is one of the Pacific-10's
best discus and shot putters.
