# Card badminton season closes
## 
### BETH KLEID 
Badminton is tougher than it looks.
Competitive badminton is a tarcry from
the backyard variety played at summer
picnics — just ask the members of the
badminton club here. The Card swat
ters are used to defending their sport.
With practices three times a week
consisting of vigorous drills and prac
tice matches, the team members have a
right to be annoyed when someone
says, "Oh anyone can play badminton,
all you have to do is hit the birdie
around."
There is more involved in badminton
than just flinging the racket at the
shuttlecock. There are prescribed
shots, fancy footworks and strategies
that a successful badminton player
must master and execute in play.
Under the direction of Coach Dick
Ng and team captain Dave Randall, the
team club here has done a fine job of
perfecting their skills in the fastest of all
racquet sports — and their record this
season shows it.

The badminton club is No. 2 in the
Northern California league, which is
comprised of schools such as UC-
Davis, UC-Berkeley, Fresno State and
San lose State. The state champion
ships were held last weekend, and Card
player joy Kitzmiller took a second
place in the women's singles division.
Kitzmiller is the superstar on this
year's team. She participated in the Na
tional College Championships in Wash
ington D.C. in March, and captured
second place titles in both the women's
singles and mixed doubles divisions.
Other outstanding swatters include
freshman Kira Hellinghausen, junior
Dave Randall, graduate student Norin
der Singh and graduate student Venit
Singh. Hellinghausen holds the NorCal
women's doubles title with partner
Kitzmiller, who also holds the women's
singles title in this league.
"We have had a very successful sea
son this year," said Kitzmiller. "The
team was very enthusiastic, and every

body improved their abilities."
Badminton meets are set up in tour
nament style. Because eight or more
schools participate in each meet, there
are only three NorCal meets per sea
son. "The meets are a lot of fun because
you get to travel to different places, and
play in a competitive atmosphere. It's
neat to see that the teams are so sup
portive of their players," said Kitzmil
ler.
The Card encountered tough compe
tition from UC-Davis in the NorCal
league. Davis is No. 1, but the club here
does not feel inferior to the Davis team.
"Davis just has more depth than we do
because they have a larger team," said
Kitzmiller.
The badminton club has finished
their competitive play for this season,
but they continue to practice their
clears, drive, drop shots and strategy
three evenings a week in Roble Gym —
and believe it or not they really do work
up a sweat.
