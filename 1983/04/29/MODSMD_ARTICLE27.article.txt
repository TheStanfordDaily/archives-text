Raiders' pick had surgery
Los Angeles — Offensive tackle Don
Mosebar, selected by the Los Angeles Raiders

on his back last week, something the team
didn't know about, the Los Angeles Times re
ported yesterday.
Mosebar, a 6-foot-6, 275-pounder from the

than half of his lowest disc on the left side re-

moved in the operation on April 18, the
newspaper reported.
Al Davis, Managing General Partner of the
Raiders, was told of the operation by a re
porter, the Times said, and "was livid."
Neither Mosebar nor Slusher volunteered
this information to the Raiders, or any other
NFL team, the Times said.
Ryan breaks strikeout record
Montreal — Nolan Ryan of the Houston
Astros erased one of baseball's most durable
records Wednesday, striking out the 3,509 th

the game's all-time strikeout king.
The record, which had stood for 55 years,
fell in the eighth inning when Ryan caught
pinch-hitter Brad Mills of the Montreal Expos
looking on a 1-2 curveball in the eighth in
ning of the Astros' 4-2 victory.
The 36-year-old Ryan, who pitched for the
