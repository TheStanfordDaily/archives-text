Traveling abroad is always a fun and exciting experi
ence. I think that one of the best parts about going to
different countries is the opportunity it provides for
.sampling local delicacies and diverse cuisines. Unfor
tunately my travels have always ended too quickly, and
after a couple of weeks of hamburgers, pizza and fried
[. chicken (not to mention California Quiche and BBQ
Beef a la Food Service) I find myself craving some good
|:ethnic food.
Having just returned from a ski vacation in Austria and
j Germany, I was really beginning to miss the flavor of
bratwurst, spatzle and good German beer. Therefore, I
- decided to head into San Francisco for dinner at
112 Schroeder's Cafe.
Schroeder's Cafe is certainly not the type of restaurant
; that you will find in the elegant hotels of the Austrian
Alps, rather, it is reminiscent of the beer halls in
I Frankfurt. Nonetheless, places like this seem to have a
knack for preparing hearty German food which forces
you to unbuckle your belt several notches by the end of
. the meal.
Schroeder's Cafe is a fairly large restaurant. Its single
| long and narrow room is similiar to the banquet halls of
large castles in the German countryside. The walls are
decorated with large paintings of "old-world" scenes
and activities. In addition, the room contains an eclectic
array of beer steins and mugs.
When you sit down, you may be surprised that there
are no menus. Never fear — the choices of the day are
displayed on several large boards on the wall. Although
the selection is somewhat limited, I am sure that you will
find that most of the more popular German dishes are
available.
For the adventuresome, Schroeder's offers marinated
herring ($.3.25) or head cheese on top of lettuce for an
appetizer. I would like to tell you about these two dis
hes, but my love for German food only extends so far.
Thus, we began our meal with a rather un-German
appetizer, shrimp cocktail ($3.75). Although the por
tions of shrimp were ample, they served tiny gulf shrimp
ratherthan the large variety that I prefer, and thecocktail
' sauce wasn't exactly noteworthy. Schoreder's also offers
a variety of soups ranging from lentil to clam chowder.

When I think about German food, I think about
potatoes — bushels and bushels of potatoes. Well,
Schroeder's Cafe simply reinforced the association.
Every entree is preceeded by a serving of either potato
salad or cole slaw. The potato salad is a must for anyone
who enjoys true German-style potato salad — delicious
boiled potatoes served with a little oil and some sea
sonings.
The cole slaw was a simple but tasty plate of shredded
cabbage covered with oil, vinegar and spices — a nice
change from the terribly sweet and mayonnaise-flavored
cole slaw that so many restaurants serve.
One of my all-time favorites entrees is wiener schnit
zel, breaded veal cutlet, so, I naturally had to order it
despite the fact that I had eaten six helpings of it on my
trip. Unfortunately, Schroeder's schnitzel ($8.50) just
didn't stand up to the authentic versions that I enjoyed
on my vacation. The veal was tasty, but it was not as
tender and as lean as it should have been. Plus, they
served the schnitzel in a brown sauce which wasn't very
good and took away from the delicate flavor of the meat.
The wiener schnitzel was served with a delicious side
order of tangy green beans, and, of course, a large
helping of fried potatoes.
Our other entree, sauerbraten ($7.95), was excellent.
It was a surprisingly tender piece of beef smothered in a
wonderfully thick brown gravy. Wunderbar! The sauer
braten was served with a side order of potato pancakes
— two scrumptious, fried potatoes that tasted just like
the ones my Grandma Burkhardt makes.
Schroeder's also offers poached salmon and hollan
daise with potatoes ($9.50), and holstein schnitzel
($8.95) which is similiar to the wiener schnitzel except
that it is served with a fried egg and capers on top. They
also serve corned beef and cabbage, and, what else,
potatoes!
Now, a meal at a German or Austrian restaurant just
wouldn't becompletewithout dessert. In fact, my motto
is: a meal isn't a meal unless it concludes with three of
four desserts! For those of you who also adhere to this
adage, Schroeder's will not let you leave unsatisfied.
I strongly recommend the Apple Pancakes ($5.50) for
two (although I had little trouble disposing of it by my
self). This lucious dessert consists of light, buttery pan
cakes, similiar to crepes, filled to overflowing with tasty
apples, brown sugar, lemon juice, and a large dose of
cinnamon-truly ethereal!
This marvelous dessert is beautifully complimented
by a wedge of Sacher Torte — named for the Sacher

Hotel in Vienna, it is a chocolate cake with raspberry jam
running through the middle and glazed with chocolate
icing.
Huckleberry squares are also quite good — flavorful
little tarts filled with huckleberries and whipped cream.
Then, there is the black forrest cake— a chocolate and
cream torte covered with cherries — pure decadence!
Schroeder's also serves ice cream, apple fritters and
German cheesecake.
All in all, Schroeder's Cafe checked-in with mixed
reviews. The service was both friendly and helpful, and
the owner, Max, is very concerned about keeping his
customers happy. The food was typical, hearty German
food. So if you are looking for a restaurant that guaran

tees to fill your belly to the brim, then this might be the
place.
However, I have several reservations about
Schroeder's Cafe. The quality of the food isn't outstand
ing, and I found the prices a little bit expensive. I got the
impression that Schroeder's caters to a business lunch
crowd — it's just around the corner from Embarcader
Center. Thus it seems like the staff doesn't put out as
much effort for dinner as they do for lunch.
Nonetheless, the food is tasty.
I would reccomend stopping there for dessert before
a show. Or maybe you should have a couple of desserts
— i have found that most shows are far more enjoyable
when they are preceeded by several pastries! Enjoy.

; that you will find in the elegant hotels of the Austrian
Alps, rather, it is reminiscent of the beer halls in
I Frankfurt. Nonetheless, places like this seem to have a
knack for preparing hearty German food which forces
you to unbuckle your belt several notches by the end of
. the meal.
Schroeder's Cafe is a fairly large restaurant. Its single
| long and narrow room is similiar to the banquet halls of
large castles in the German countryside. The walls are
decorated with large paintings of "old-world" scenes
and activities. In addition, the room contains an eclectic
array of beer steins and mugs.
When you sit down, you may be surprised that there
are no menus. Never fear — the choices of the day are
displayed on several large boards on the wall. Although
the selection is somewhat limited, I am sure that you will
find that most of the more popular German dishes are
available.
For the adventuresome, Schroeder's offers marinated
herring ($.3.25) or head cheese on top of lettuce for an
appetizer. I would like to tell you about these two dis
hes, but my love for German food only extends so far.
Thus, we began our meal with a rather un-German
appetizer, shrimp cocktail ($3.75). Although the por
tions of shrimp were ample, they served tiny gulf shrimp
ratherthan the large variety that I prefer, and thecocktail
' sauce wasn't exactly noteworthy. Schoreder's also offers
a variety of soups ranging from lentil to clam chowder.

When I think about German food, I think about
potatoes — bushels and bushels of potatoes. Well,
Schroeder's Cafe simply reinforced the association.
Every entree is preceeded by a serving of either potato
salad or cole slaw. The potato salad is a must for anyone
who enjoys true German-style potato salad — delicious
boiled potatoes served with a little oil and some sea
sonings.
The cole slaw was a simple but tasty plate of shredded
cabbage covered with oil, vinegar and spices — a nice
change from the terribly sweet and mayonnaise-flavored
cole slaw that so many restaurants serve.
One of my all-time favorites entrees is wiener schnit
zel, breaded veal cutlet, so, I naturally had to order it
despite the fact that I had eaten six helpings of it on my
trip. Unfortunately, Schroeder's schnitzel ($8.50) just
didn't stand up to the authentic versions that I enjoyed
on my vacation. The veal was tasty, but it was not as
tender and as lean as it should have been. Plus, they
served the schnitzel in a brown sauce which wasn't very
good and took away from the delicate flavor of the meat.
The wiener schnitzel was served with a delicious side
order of tangy green beans, and, of course, a large
helping of fried potatoes.
Our other entree, sauerbraten ($7.95), was excellent.
It was a surprisingly tender piece of beef smothered in a
wonderfully thick brown gravy. Wunderbar! The sauer
braten was served with a side order of potato pancakes
— two scrumptious, fried potatoes that tasted just like
the ones my Grandma Burkhardt makes.
Schroeder's also offers poached salmon and hollan
daise with potatoes ($9.50), and holstein schnitzel
($8.95) which is similiar to the wiener schnitzel except
that it is served with a fried egg and capers on top. They
also serve corned beef and cabbage, and, what else,
potatoes!
Now, a meal at a German or Austrian restaurant just
wouldn't becompletewithout dessert. In fact, my motto
is: a meal isn't a meal unless it concludes with three of
four desserts! For those of you who also adhere to this
adage, Schroeder's will not let you leave unsatisfied.
I strongly recommend the Apple Pancakes ($5.50) for
two (although I had little trouble disposing of it by my
self). This lucious dessert consists of light, buttery pan
cakes, similiar to crepes, filled to overflowing with tasty
apples, brown sugar, lemon juice, and a large dose of
cinnamon-truly ethereal!
This marvelous dessert is beautifully complimented
by a wedge of Sacher Torte — named for the Sacher

Hotel in Vienna, it is a chocolate cake with raspberry jam
running through the middle and glazed with chocolate
icing.
Huckleberry squares are also quite good — flavorful
little tarts filled with huckleberries and whipped cream.
Then, there is the black forrest cake— a chocolate and
cream torte covered with cherries — pure decadence!
Schroeder's also serves ice cream, apple fritters and
German cheesecake.
All in all, Schroeder's Cafe checked-in with mixed
reviews. The service was both friendly and helpful, and
the owner, Max, is very concerned about keeping his
customers happy. The food was typical, hearty German
food. So if you are looking for a restaurant that guaran

tees to fill your belly to the brim, then this might be the
place.
However, I have several reservations about
Schroeder's Cafe. The quality of the food isn't outstand
ing, and I found the prices a little bit expensive. I got the
impression that Schroeder's caters to a business lunch
crowd — it's just around the corner from Embarcader
Center. Thus it seems like the staff doesn't put out as
much effort for dinner as they do for lunch.
Nonetheless, the food is tasty.
I would reccomend stopping there for dessert before
a show. Or maybe you should have a couple of desserts
— i have found that most shows are far more enjoyable
when they are preceeded by several pastries! Enjoy.

Traveling abroad is always a fun and exciting experi

different countries is the opportunity it provides for
.sampling local delicacies and diverse cuisines. Unfor
tunately my travels have always ended too quickly, and
after a couple of weeks of hamburgers, pizza and fried
[. chicken (not to mention California Quiche and BBQ
Beef a la Food Service) I find myself craving some good
|:ethnic food.
Having just returned from a ski vacation in Austria and

bratwurst, spatzle and good German beer. Therefore, I
