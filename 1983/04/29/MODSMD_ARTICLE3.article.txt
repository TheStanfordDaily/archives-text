CIA campaign may stop
Washington— Democratic leaders of the House
yesterday announced their support for and predicted
approval of legislation to end the ClA's covert guer
rilla campaign against the leftist government of
Nicaragua.
The House Permanent Select Committee on In
telligence, which has a 9-to-5 Democratic majority,
delayed yesterday's scheduled vote on the bill to give
Republican members time to draft amendments.
Committee Chairman Edward Boland (D-Mass.) said,
"There are sufficient votes on our side to pass the bill
out."
The growing support for the bill representsthe first
congressional response to President Reagan's na
tionally televised appeal to a joint session of Congress

Wednesday night for his Central American policies.
Boland, in his strongest statement to date on the
Nicaraguan operation, told his home-town news
paper after Reagan's speech, "The covert action in
Nicaragua ought to be stopped."
House Majority Leader James Wright Jr. (D-Texas)
an ex-officio member of the intelligence committee,
said after its 90-minute closed meeting yesterday that
the bill is designed to bring a significant element of
U.S. policy in the region "out into the sunlight... for
all the world to see."
He said the legislation would force the United
States to "practice what we preach" in defending our
allies in the region from armed insurgencies by re
placing the covert operation with "overt" assistance
to friendly governments to stop illicit arms flows. At
the same time, he said, the bill would end U.S. sup
port for groups who "violate the territorial integrity of
any other nation."
Wright added, "My guess is that something very
much like this (bill) will be approved."
Mideast talks stalled
Jerusalem — Secretary of State George Shultz re
turned to Israel last night after five hours of talks in
Beirut, where he said there were many "difficult is
sues" in his search for a breakthrough in troop with
drawal talks.
He meets today with Prime Minister Menachem
Begin.
Shultz told reporters before leaving the presiden
tial palace in Beirut that he had a "very full review of
all the issues" with Lebanese President Amin
Gemayel, Foreign Minister Elie Salem and others.
"I can see that there are quite a number of difficult
issues (and) that at least I think we can now have some
sense of definition of them," he said.
He pledged to "continue our efforts to find peace
and stability ... in the Middle East. That is the presi
dent's determination and my determination, and we
will do everything possible we can to achieve that re
sult."
Freeze vote blocked again
Washington — Backers of a U.S.-Soviet nuclear
freeze resolution made a tactical retreat yesterday af
ter opponents allied with the administration suc
ceeded in blocking a House vote for the fifth time.
Although supporters of the freeze resolution say
they have enough votes to win, they were forced by
delaying tactics of opponents to abandon efforts to
finish work on the measure this week.
The nonbinding resolution calls for the two super
powers to negotiate an "immediate, mutual and veri
fiable" freeze on the production and deployment of
nuclear weapons. Although supporters say it would
be a meaningful gesture, President Reagan contends
it would undermine the U.S. position in arms limita
tion talks in Geneva.
Latin envoy pessimistic
Washington — Richard Stone, the Reagan adminis
tration's newly designated special representative to
Central America, pledged yesterday to work for a ne
gotiated settlement to the conflict in El Salvador but

said that "the odds are long" against obtaining one.
"It's a very difficult situation," Stone said, moments
after his appointment was formally announced by
White House spokesman Larry Speakes. "Anyone
who thinks that a mere invitation to peace will pro
duce peace is just inaccurate and unrealistic."
Stone, a former Democratic senator from Florida,
held a short news conference in the White House
briefing room that was attended at its conclusion by
President Reagan, who congratulated the new special
envoy and predicted that he would be confirmed by
the Senate.
Sakharov may emigrate
Moscow — The Soviet government may allow An
drei Sakharov, the country's foremost human rights
activist, to emigrate to the West, a Cabinet minister
has suggested.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who has been con
fined for three years to internal exile in the industrial
city of Gorki, has been formally offered a visiting pro
fessorship at Vienna University, it was reported here
yesterday by reliable diplomatic sources.
At the same time, word spread here that Soviet Min
ister of Justice Vladimir Terebilov, in an interview
aired by Swedish television Wednesday night, said
that if Sakharov "would apply for a visa now, there
would be no obstacles."
It was the first time such a statement has been made
by a high official. Sakharov could not be reached for
comment in Gorki, but at the time of his banishment
his wife, Elena Bonner, told a group of western jour
nalists that Sakharov felt "the West is preferable to
Gorki."

yesterday as the Dow Jones industrial average
climbed to a new high for the second time this week

points to 1219.52, easily offsetting its 1.06-point loss
Wednesday and surpassing its previous peak of
1209.46 set on Tuesday. The market's best-known
measure is up 23.22 points this week.
