CIA campaign may stop
Washingtonâ€” Democratic leaders of the House
yesterday announced their support for and predicted
approval of legislation to end the ClA's covert guer
rilla campaign against the leftist government of
Nicaragua.
The House Permanent Select Committee on In
telligence, which has a 9-to-5 Democratic majority,
delayed yesterday's scheduled vote on the bill to give
Republican members time to draft amendments.
Committee Chairman Edward Boland (D-Mass.) said,
"There are sufficient votes on our side to pass the bill
out."
The growing support for the bill representsthe first
congressional response to President Reagan's na
tionally televised appeal to a joint session of Congress

Wednesday night for his Central American policies.
Boland, in his strongest statement to date on the
Nicaraguan operation, told his home-town news
paper after Reagan's speech, "The covert action in
Nicaragua ought to be stopped."
House Majority Leader James Wright Jr. (D-Texas)
an ex-officio member of the intelligence committee,
said after its 90-minute closed meeting yesterday that
the bill is designed to bring a significant element of
U.S. policy in the region "out into the sunlight... for
all the world to see."
He said the legislation would force the United
States to "practice what we preach" in defending our
allies in the region from armed insurgencies by re
placing the covert operation with "overt" assistance
