## Tuolomne River may be dammed 
### DAVID KREGER LAUREN JELKS 
The tate of the Tuolomne
River is now a point of conten
tion between environmen
talists and outdoorsmen and
two irrigation districts that
would like to build a hyd
roelectric dam along the river.
In 1975 the federal govern
ment began a study to deter
mine whether the Tuolomne
ought to be preserved as part
of the Federal Wild and Scenic
Ri\er System, established by
the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
At about the same time,
however, the City of San Fran
cisco together with the Mod
esto Irrigation District (MID)
and the Turlock Irrigation Dis
trict tTID) requested prelimi
nary permits to allow them to
conduct on-site studies for a
variety of projects to generate
electricity on the Tuolomne. A
federal moratorium prevented
the permits from being
granted, however, because the
river was under consideration
for preservation.
% After three years, the wild
and scenic river study con
cluded that 83 miles of the
Tuolomne ought to be in
cluded in the Federal Wild and
Scenic River System. The De
partments of the Interior and
Agriculture presented this re
commendation to Congress,
which then had three years to
act before the moratorium en
ded. Congress did not act, and
the moratorium ended this
year. In December 1982
Senator Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.) introduced a bill to ex
tend the moratorium another
year, but it was part of a pac
kage that failed in the lame
duck session. Cranston rein
troduced the bill in January.
The Tuolomne flows west
through Tuolomne Meadows,
Vosemite's backpacking mec
ca. After leaving the park it
gushes for 29 miles through a
steep, jagged canyon.
The Tuolomne area harbors
many threatened species of
plants and biologists recently
discovered three species of
snails which are unique to in
dividual outcroppings of the
canyon. Otters, coyotes, rac
coons and black bear all in
habit the river. Two of Vose
mite's largest deer herds pass
the winter there. The Bald
Eagle and other endangered or
threatened bird species live in
the canyon, including the
prairie falcon and the spotted

owl; all together, over 200
species of birds and land ani
mals are attracted to the free
flowing river and the abun
dance of vegetation.
"The Tuolomne has undoub
tedly the finest undiscovered
trout fishing in California, and
possibly the entire West," said
the Tuolomne River Preserva
tion Trust. In addition. 22,000
deer tags a year are sold to hun
ters who use this area and
about 1000 deer are taken.
An 18-mile stretch of the
river consists of challenging
white water for ratting and
kavaking enthusiasts, which
compares favorably to the Col
orado River in Arizona and the
Salmon River in Idaho, accord
ing to the U.S. Forest Service.
The Army Corps ot Engineers
considers the stretch "one of
the finest whitewater boating
rivers in the Nation."
The Tuolomne River is
also the site of archeolo
gical findings. The ancient
Mi wok Indians lived in
the Tuolomne foothills 4000
years ago, and traces ot the cul
ture linger in more than 250 ar
cheological sites along the
river. The remnants of gold
mining operations from the
late 1800s are still to be found.

In April, however, the fed
eral government issued a pre
liminary permit for the S9OO
million Clavey-Ward's project,
the largest of the projects that
San Francisco, MID and TID
proposed in the mid-'7os, and
the one with the greatest en
vironmental impact, according
to John Amodio, campaign di
rector for the Tuolomne River
Preservation Trust.
The Ward's Ferry project
consists of a large dam at the
tail end of Don Pedro Reser

voir, backing up water over
nine miles of the river canyon.
The Clavey river project begins
with a small dam on the
Tuolomne just below its con
fluence with Cherry Creek. A
diversion tunnel would carry
water out of this reservoir and
meet the Clavey River where a
second small dam would be
built. Water from the Clavey
River would join the water in
the diversion tunnel, continue
west, and drop down the ca
nyon's wall to a powerhouse at
the tail end ot the new Ward's
Ferrv Reservoir. The
Tuolomne's natural flow is
about 700 cubic teet per sec
ond icts) in early autumn and
4500 cfs in the spring. The
capacity of the diversion tun
nel would be 1000 cts. accord
ing to Leo Bauer, project man
ager tor the Public Utilities
Commission or San Francisco,
and at least 175 cfs would be
left in the river. Overall, 18
miles ot the Tuolomne would
be altered bv flooding or by a
reduction of water flow, and
about five miles of the Clavey
River would have some reduc
tion in water flow.
While MID and TID are
committed to the project, San
Francisco appears to be ambi-

valent. "The districts (MID and
TID) are going ahead with or
without San Francisco, so we
joined them in filing for the
permit in order to keep our op
tions open," Bauer said. In ac
cordance with long-standing
water rights, San Francisco
would be entitled to one half of
the 400 megawatts the two
powerhouses would generate,
but would receive no extra wa
ter, since the Clavey-Ward's
Ferry project does nothing to
increase water supply.

In all years except those of
the drought ot the late 19705,
San Francisco has made money
selling surplus power gener
ated at Hetch Hetchv to MID,
TID and to Lockheed Missiles,
General Motors and other cus
tomers, netting about $10 mill
ion each year, according to
Theodore Chung, senior elec
trical engineer tor the City of
San Francisco. Because of the
record rainfalls leading to full
capacity power generation,
San Francisco has netted $50
million from the sale of elec
tricity this past year, Chung
said. The Clavey Ward's Ferry
development would increase
their sale of power.
Amodio called this "the
height of hypocrisy." San Fran
cisco has a budget surplus of
$150 million and is in one of the
best fiscal positions of any city
in the country, he pointed out.
In addition, San Francisco will
renegotiate its contract to sell
power to MID and TID in 1985,
and the new price will be seven
times higherthan today's rates,
according to Amodio.
TID would receive 133
megawatts from the Clavey-
Ward's Ferry project. Robert
Nees, public information of
ficer for TID, emphasized the
present need for this power.
"At present TID generates 115
megawatts and buys about 85
from San Francisco and 30 from
PG&E . . . It's like renting ver
sus buying your own home.
You can pay a lot renting a
house, but having your own
powerhouse is like owning
your own home," Nees said.
The TID has predicted future
demand in Turlock to be great
and predicts by then year 2005
that the TID will be consuming
eight times as much power as it
does now. "In the past, there
was a four to five percent an
nual growth in electricity con
sumption in Turlock, but in the
last few years, it has slowed to
one to two percent. It is un
realistic to assume that growth
will stay this low. When the
economy improves, growth
will resume at 4 to 5 percent,"
Nees said.
Another reason TID needs
the power, according to
Chung, is because San Francis
co's consumption of Hetch
Hetchy power is increasing,
while the amount left to sell
MID and TID is slowly decreas
ing. "In the year 2015, MID and
TID will only be able to buy
one-third of the power they

buy now . . . Chung said.
Modesto's reasons for want
ing power are similar to those
of Turlock. But because of a
long-standing agreement,
Modesto would be entitled to
only half as much power as Tur
lock — about 67 megawatts —
even though Modesto con
sumes 50 percent more power.
Modesto buys about 85 per
cent of its power from San
Francisco and PG&E and thus
will be affected even more by
San Francisco's price hike in
1985. The MID predicts a 2.1
percent annual growth in its
electricity consumption.
Amodio called TlD's projec
tions of its growth "ridicul
ous." First, he said, the 1985

price hike will encourage con
servation and efficiency im
provements. Emphasizing the
potential for conservation, he
quoted the California Energy
Commission's study that
showed average electricity
consumption per household to
be 60 percent greater in Tur
lock than in Davis, another
Central Valley town with a simi
lar climate, and 35 percent gre
ater in Modesto than Davis.
The Commission also said, "It
would take roughlyafivedollar
investment in conventional
sources of energy to ecjual
whata one dollar investment IrV
conservation could save." The
Commission forecasted that all
future energy needs can be

met without the project.
Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.)
has not yet committed himself
to one side or the other, ac
cording to the Tuolomne River
Preservation Trust. His cos
ponsorship of Cranston's se
nate bill is considered to be a
key to its passing.
Rep. Ed Zschau's (R-Los Altos)
district stretches from Turlock to
parts of the mid-peninsula.
Zschau, like Wilson, is assessing
the "political climate" before
taking a stand, according to the
Trust. Because his district in
cludes* tfre main proponent of
the project, his position is very
important in determining the fu
ture of the Tuolomne.

THE GRAND CAN YON OF THE TUOLOMNE: The Tuolomne River is the target of a proposed
$900 million hydroelectric dam project which would back up water over nine miles of the
river canyon. Environmental groups and others who oppose the project hope to have the river
preserved under the Federal Wild and Scenic River System.
