# State irrigation projects causing serious problems
## 
### LINDA RICHARDSON 
Water is a controversial issue in California.
Laws are made and legal battles fought about
its use, and numerous state and federal
agencies have been created to monitor it.
What makes it so important is this: Califor
nia's water is not where her people are. The
water is in the north; more than two-thirds
of all precipitation, which is the principal
source of water supply, falls on the northern
third of the state, and northern rivers carry
about 80 percent of the state's total water
runoff. The majority of the population of the
state, as well as most of its arable farmland, is
in the south, which has virtually no water
resources of its own.
Climatic patterns create additional prob
lems for water use; throughout California 60
to 70 percent of a stream's flow typically oc
curs within a relatively few weeks of the year
and is unusable unless captured and stored.
These conditions have made it necessary
for California to develop extensfve water
storage and transport facilities. The two
largest delivery systems are the State Water
Project (SWP) and the federal Central Valley
Project (CVP). Initial facilities of the SWP,
completed in 1973, include 18 reservoirs, 15
pumping plants, five power plants and 540
miles of aqueduct. It carries water from the
high Sierras throughout the state, at one
point lifting it over 2000 vertical feet.
The project is predicted to reach its full
delivery capacity, 4.23 million acre-feet
(maf), sometime after 2010 by implementing
a system of groundwater storage, additional
reservoirs, transportation facilities and
programs of conservation. (An acre-foot is
325,000 gallons, or the amount of water it
would take to cover one acre of land with
water one foot deep.)
The CVP is also grand in scale. In 19fÂ»9 total
deliveries of the project exceed 4.9 maf,
supplied by seven dams and reservoirs,
among them the largest in the state, 390
miles of canals, four power plants and eight
pumping complexes. More than $3.5 billion
in federal dollars have been spent to date.
Eighty-five percent of California's total
water is used for agricultural purposes.
Water irrigates 10 million acres of crops
worth about $9 billion per year, making
California one of the world's greatest grow
ers of food and fiber products.
"For the foreseeable future there is plenty
of water in California," said Dean
Thompson, chief of public information at
the Department of Water Resources (DWR).
"It is just a matter of getting all of our deliv
ery systems in place, of more efficient dis
tribution and more conservation." For the
time being, however, agriculture's demand
has caused some major problems.
Desertification is occuring in some areas
of the San loaquin Valley, which has a severe
salinization problem. When plants extract
pure water from irrigation water for their

use, they raise the concentration of dissol
ved salts. The saline water trickles down into
the ground until its passage is blocked by a
compact layer of soil; it then begins to build
up, rising toward the surface and eventually
reaching root levels, killing crops. Today
about 400,000 acres of farmland in the San
Joaquin are affected by high, brackish water
tables; crop yields have declined 10 percent
or $31.2 million annually since 1970.

Agriculture throughout the state suffers
from another serious problem: groundwa
ter depletion. Groundwater is water stored
in underground aquifers. It now accounts
for 60 percent of the total water supply in
California, and an estimated 19 billion gal
lons is pumped every day to meet about 40
percent of total water needs. Water with
drawn at a greater rate than it can be re
plenished leads to a condition called
groundwater overdraft.
In the San Joaquin Valley, which annually
overdrafts by an average of 1.5 maf, the
water level drops by 10 to 20 feet each year.
This raises the energy costs of pumping and,
even more seriously, causes land subsi
dence. When water is mined, the soil com
pacts and the land surface sinks. This dam
ages houses and buildings as well as irriga
tion and drainage facilities; between June
1975 and September 1976 the Bureau of Re
clamation spent about $3.7 million to repair
damaged irrigation projects, and south of
Fresno a small community had to be com
pletely abandoned because of land subsi
dence.

The most serious result is the loss of water
storage capacity. As mined soil compresses,
the amount of pore space within it, and
hence its ability to store water, shrinks.
Aquifer systems are the most efficient means
of storing water, since unlike reservoirs they
do not lose huge quantities of water to
evaporation.
In its January 1980 report, the DWR indi
cated 53 ground water basins that were in
danger of critical overdraft. The department
recognizes the need to return to a policy of
"safe yield'' management, in which pump
ing is reduced in order to reach some ba
lance between extractions and replenish
ment, yet a comprehensive policy has not
been developed. The problem is in deciding
who should receive less water or pay for
more expensive surface water, according to
Thompson.
The State of California has attempted to
solve the overdraft problem by bringing in
more water from distant sources. "When we
have more water development in Calfornia
we will solve the overdraft problem," said
Clark Biggs, manager of information ser
vices of the California Farm Bureau. Many
argue, however, that such a strategy will not
solve the problem, pointing out that imports
into Kern County, intended tosolvethat reg
ion's overdraft problem, were instead used
tofarm new land.
Without strict legislation requiring new
deliveries to be used for replenishment of
ground water, a repeat performance is
likely, according to Michael Storper, profes
sor of geography at UC-Berkeley.
The problem, as the agencies involved see
it, is basically one ot moving water from the
northern part of the state to the south. In the
middle of the state lies a major obstacle to
this transport: 1100 miles of channels, com
prising the largest inland delta in the conti
nental United States. Integral to the de
velopment proposals of state and federal
agencies is the Peripheral Canal, a conduit
designed to carry water around the east side
of the Delta for delivery to the south. The
43-mile-long, 400-foot-wide canal would di
vert 70 percent of the flow of the Sacramento
River, returning portions of that water to the
Delta at critical points.
Some such facility is considered necessary
by the state's water planners. Under the cur
rent system, withdrawals from the southern
part of the Delta draw salt water from the San
Francisco Bay into the Delta in times of low
river flow. This creates major problems for
Delta farmers and water users to the south,
who cannot irrigate with salty water,and itis
hazardous to the many waterfowl and fish
for which the Delta is home. What is impor
tant to water planners, however, is that no
additional water can be pumped through the
Delta under current conditions.
While it would probably solve the prob
lem of reverse flow into the Delta, the canal

leaves many unresolved environmental
questions. In spite of years of investment in
study of the problem, engineers have thus
far found development of screens to protect
fish from being sucked into canal pumps an
impossibletask. Satisfactory scientific know
ledge is lacking as to the amount of water
release required to maintain the Delta envi
ronment; in the last 12 years, estimates have
risen dramatically, from 1800 to 4000 cubic
feet per second. The requirements of San
Francisco Bay, which needs large volumes of
outflow from the Sacramento River to flush
away industrial and municipal wastes, are
even less understood.
The canal proposal was defeated in a re
cent referendum by California voters, but it
is an issue which is by no means dead.
"When voters rejected the peripheral canal,
we of course had to back off," Thompson
said, "but there is still a feeling within the
Department that it is the best solution."
However, according to Storper demand
for water could be met through the year 2000
with existing facilities, given 15 percent con
servation in the use of agricultural water.

The DWR claims it needs new facilities to
meet its contractual obligations. But Storper
said, "We consider it to be a self-fulfilling
prophecy for the state to promise more than
it can deliver and then to use those promises
to justify further supply expansion."
Many also claim that water demand is ele
vated by current pricing practices. A recent
General Accounting Office report found
that the cost to the federal government on
six projects ranged from $54 to $130 per

acre-toot ot water, but users only paid 27
cents to $9.82. The Congressional Budget
Office estimates that the average reclama
tion water district pays only 16 percent of the
cost to the federal government; others say 5
percent is a more accurate figure. California
Westside Farmers, a farmers' lobbying
group, claims that total subsidy amounts to
only $55.30 per acre for a 50-year contract,
while the Interior Department calculates the
gift as $1500 per acre.
Many subsidy recipients argue that they
return more to the government than they
take. "There are subsidies, but they are sub
sidies of the whole economy. In the West
lands Water District, the amount of federal
subsidies is more than returned to govern
ment coffers through increased taxes, food,
and jobs," Riggs said. California Westside
Farmers provide supporting figures; they
argue that reclamation projects cost $8.96
billion between 1902 and 1972, but that the
economic activity generated by these pro
jects returned $28.3 billion in tax revenues.
Nevertheless, subsidies create problems
by making water appear very cheap to grow
ers, which encourages waste, according to
Storper. As long as low cost water is availa
ble, users have little incentive to conserve.
For example, crops with high water needs,
such as rice, alfalfa, and pastureland are
grown on 40 percent of the total irrigated
acreage in the state, using 63 percent of the
agricultural water supply. If prices more
closely reflected actual costs of water, these
low-value, water-intensive crops would not
be economically justifiable, according to
Storper, and their use would be reduced.
The General Accounting Office con
cluded that 50 percent of the country's irri
gation water is wasted, and one study indi
cated that California could easily decrease
its water consumption by 3 to 5 maf per year.
Open-ditch irrigation, the most common
method, is relatively wasteful. For example
25 percent of the 1.2 maf sent down the
Coachella Canal each year is lost to evapora
tion. Sprinkler irrigation uses only 18 per
cent as much water as open-ditch, and drip
irrigation only 1 percent as much, according
to a recent DWR bulletin. If these latter two
methods were used on all crops that it is
possible to use them on, state-wide savings
could reach 40 percent. The problem is that
such measures often entail significant cost,
and under current pricing practices are not
economical for farmers.
The State Water Resources Control Board
is conducting studies of waste water recla
mation, and within the next year will begin a
program, called the SIMIS program, which
will make available to farmers information
on how much water is necessary for each
crop they grow, based on an analysis of soil,
humidity and temperature conditions. The
savings from reduction of overirrigation are
expected to be considerable.
