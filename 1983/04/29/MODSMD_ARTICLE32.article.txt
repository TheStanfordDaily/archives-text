"Well, the moment
you give me a locomotive
and things like that to
play with, as a rule I find
some way to get laughs
out of it."
— Buster Keaton, 1965
The General (1926) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
James Agee wrote of Buster
Keaton, "He used this great,
sad, motionless face to suggest
various related things: a one
track mind near the track's end
of pure insanity; mulish im
perturbability under the
wildest of circumstances; how
dead a human being can get
and still be alive; an awe-inspir
ing sort of patience and power
to endure, proper to granite
but uncanny in flesh and
blood." The General is possibly
the greatest of all silent come
dies. Keaton plays a trainman
during the Civil War, and
Marion Mack, whose
marionette-like solemnity is an
ideal match for his poker face,
stars opposite him. The gags are
masterfully calculated; they op
erate like amazing, intricate
clockwork. And the look of the
film is, along with The Birth of a
Nation, the closest movies have
ever got to Remington's paint
ings.
Plays Thursday with Steam
boat Bill Jr., Cops and
Balloonatics.
Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Buster Keaton made this
touching comedy (credited to
Charles Reisner) months before
he allowed producer Joseph
Schenck to talk him into giving
up his own production com
pany to work for M-G-M —
which turned out to be the
worst mistake of his career. In
this final independent picture,
he plays a young man attempt
ing to live up to the expecta
tions of his steamboat captain
father (Ernest Torrence). The
most famous sequences are one
in which Keaton tries on a series
of hats, switching personalities
as he dons each new one, and
the climactic cyclone scene,
which was based on Keaton's
childhood memories of living
in Piqua, Kansas. With Tom
Lewis, Tom McGuire, Marion
Byron and Keaton's father Joe
as the barber.
Plays Thursday with The Gen
eral, Cops and Balloonatics.
The Return of the Pink
Panther (1975)
Memorial Auditorium
So much of this movie re
hashes the earlier Inspector
Clouseau pictures that Blake
Edwards might have brought It
out as an afterthought. Very lit
tle in it is actually funny except
for the way Peter Sellers looks
from scene to scene, and two
thirds of the way through the
film Edwards runs out of even
second-hand gags and starts re*
peatlng bits we've just seen. He
and Frank Waldman wrote the
script, and the bland support
ing cast is headed by a tired
looking Christopher Plummer,
Catherine Schell and Herbert
Lorn.
Plays Sunday evening.

The Big Sleep (1946) ★
Tresidder Union, Room 270
Raymond Chandler's slick,
fast-paced detective novel
pales beside this film version,
directed by Howard Hawks and
featuring dialogue by William
Faulkner, Jules Furthman and
Leigh Brackett. The plot is tied
in knots no one has ever suc
ceeded in untangling; the story
goes that when the
screenwriters ran into trouble,
they called Chandler up and he
couldn't figure the damn thing
out either. But the pre
posterous tortuousness of the
story is as much a part of the fun
as the double entendres be
tween Bogart and Lauren
Bacall, and Martha Vickers' turn
as Bacall's infantile, lascivious
kid sister. Bogart's impersona
tion of Chandler's private eye
hero Philip Marlowe may not
have met Chandler's standards
(inexplicably, he preferred
Dick Powell in Murder, My
Sweet), but no one else has ever
complained.
Plays Monday evening.
La Cage atix Folles (1979)
Fox, Redwood City *
The script by Jean Poiret,
Edouard Molinaro, Francis
Veber and Marcello Danon is
the cleverest variation yet on
the oft-tried comic theme of
the parent who pretends to be
something he is not for the
good of his child. (Damon Run
yon may have been the first to
use it, in his story "Madam La
Gimp.") Ugo Tognazzi plays
Renato, whose son has just be
come engaged to the daughter
of a reactionary, highly placed
government official. The girl's
parents naturally wish to meet
their intended in-law, but that
poses a delicate problem: Re
nato is an avowed homosexual
who lives with his long-time
lover, Albin, played by Michael
Serrault (who gives a magnif
icent comic performance). The
direction (by Molinaro) is slop
py, and the stage origins are un
comfortably clear in the struc

ture of some of the scenes, but
these flaws seem terribly unim
portant when Serrault is on
screen. When he walks, every
movable part of his body flut
ters through a series of carefully
prearranged poses; he gets
more comic mileage out of his
clothing than almost any other
actor ever has.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with King of Hearts.
Thief (1981) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
As Frank, a diamond burlgar
who prides himself on his ex
pertise and his independence,
James Caan does his best work
to date. Frank was raised by the
state and served time; his only
true parental model was the
man who taught him how to
crack a safe (Willie Nelson, in a
small part with one good
scene). Caan shows us Frank's
need for emotional order in his
life as well as his aility to freeze
it out in the wake of danger.
The movie, directed by Michael
Mann (a refugee from tele
vision), is junk, but Mann has a
feeling for lonely milieux and a
juicy, trashy energy: the film is
so fiercely kinetic (like the
score that Tangerine Dream
performs behind it) and so un
erringly deft that it seems to
have been assembled un
consciously. Dov Hoenig, the
editor, and Donald Thorin, the
photographer, both distinguish
themselves. With Tuesday Weld
in the thankless role of Caan's
girl friend, and a couple of
strong supporting players —
Robert Prosky as a creepy un
derworld czar and John San
tucci as a crooked cop.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Diva.

Some Like It Hot (1959) ★
Kresge Auditorium
The setting is first Chicago
and then Miami, in 1929; Jack
Lemmon and Tony Curtis play
two musicians who have the
bad luck to witness the St.
Valentine's Day Massacre and
then must run for their lives. In
order to escape their pursuers,
they don drag and join an all
girls' band, where they — and
we — have the good luck to en
counter Marilyn Monroe.
Monroe, who gets to sing
"Running Wild," "I Wanna Be
Loved by You" and "I'm
Through with Love," is at her
sweetly ingenuous,
amateurishly appealing best in
this dizzy farce, one of the few
memorable comedies of the
'50s, and her two leading men
give extremely skillful per
formances (especially Curtis,
whose imitation of Cary Grant
in the passive-aggressive seduc
tion scene is a high point). Billy
Wilder produced, directed and
co-wrote the picture (with his
frequent partner, I.A.L.
Diamond), and he assembled a
witty supporting cast. George
Raft, Pat O'Brien, George E.
Stone and Mike Mazurki show
up to spoof roles they played
earlier in their careers, and the
woefully underrated '30s comic
Joe E. Brown gives his most en
dearing performance as mil
lionaire Osgood Fielding, who
falls madly in love with Jack
Lemmon and delivers the most
famous curtain line in movie
history.
Plays tonight.

Dr. Strangelove (1964) ★
Fox, Redwood City
This black comedy about the
series of blunders leading to a
nuclear war is one of the high
points of American film writ
ing: few screenplays can com
pare to what Terry Southern,
Stanley Kubrick and Peter
George have accomplished
here. It is one of Kubrick's best
movies — and his lastunpreten
tious, energetic one. (At this
point he still knew how to pace
and edit.) Peter Sellers is triple
cast as the low-key American
president, an officer who is a
perfect parody of British re
serve, and Strangelove, the mad
Nazi scientist whose scenes in
vade the territory of the sur
realists. He gives a bravura per
formance that is nearly
matched by George C. Scott's
randy, growling general. With
Sterling Hayden as the mega
lomaniac who starts the whole
mess, Slim Pickens as a gung-ho
pilot, Keenan Wynn and James
Earl Jones.
lays today and Monday with
The World According to Garp.
Diva
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of this
picture, directed by Jean-Jac
ques Beinixand shot by Philippe
Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles
of a movie. Beinix's chief virtue,
aside from his dexterity, is his
determination not to take
himself seriously: the witty,
freewheeling way in which he
has put the picture together,
making his camera double back
on itself with tantalizing self
consciousness, seems to be
based on the careless assump
tion that this little thriller about
stolen tapes is inconsequential.

You can't complain that Diva
doesn't mean anything, be
cause Beinix's style and the
weightless, hollow shimmer of
Hilton McConnico's interior
designs declare it in every
frame. With Frederic Andrei,
who recalls the )ean-Pierre
Leaud of the middle and late
'60s; Thuy An Luu, who has the
unflappable cool of a Godard
gamine; and the black singer
Wilhelminia Wiggins
Fernandez. Beinix and lean Van
Hamme adapted a novel by De
lacorta, and Vladimir Cosma
supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Thief.
Gimme Shelter (1970)
Fox, Redwood City
David Maysles directed this
deeply disturbing concert
documentary about the
calamitous Rolling Stones con
cert at Altamont, in which a
Hell's Angel "security guard"
stabbed a member of the au
dience. The concert was set up
in an insanely hazardous fash
ion, with Hell's Angels sub
stituting for cops and paid off in
beer, and you can't help won
dering how many of the de
cisions were made in order to
furnish the moviemakers with a
more photogenic security ar
rangement. Of course, no one
anticipated the tragedy, but
when you watch the mood of
the crowd and the Hell's
Angels, and the way in which
the Stones and the jefferson
Airplane keep revving the au
dience up and then telling
them, uselessly, to "cool out,"
you know that it was inevitable.
Mick Jagger performs some of
the most staggering concert
numbers ever filmed, but you
may feel queasy about the
whole enterprise.
Plays today through Sunday.
Senso (1954) ★
Casa Italiana
Luchino Visconti takes a
moldy tale of a countess gone
mad over a man beneath her
station and turns it into grand
opera, shot (by Giuseppe
Rotunno) in golds, pinks and
mauves. The movie often tot

★ Highly recommended
Reviews by Steve Vineberg
ters on the brink of ridicu
lousness, but Visconti takes the
elegant hysteria so far that he
carries it off. Senso is about how
it looks and moves far more
than about the characters,
played by the stunning Alida
Valli, Farley Granger (who is
more interesting than usual,
perhaps because he's dubbed
by someone with a more attrac
tive voice than his own),
Massimo Girotti, Christian Mar
quand, Rita Morelli and others.
There is a marvellous shot of
Valli and Granger walking
through a Venetian alley that
Visconti reworked a decade
and a half later in Death in Ven
ice. Tennessee Williams (and
others) worked on the script,
and the assistant directors were
Francesco Rosi and Franco Zef
firelli.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Bedazzled (1968) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Cook and Dudley
Moore as the Devil and Faust (in
the modern person of one
Stanley Moon). They wrote the
story, which Cook turned into a
screenplay, and they are both
terribly funny in it. The style of
this Stanley Donen film is 1960s
pop (the editing is Richard
Lester-influenced, and Austin
Dempster's photography is col
orful — though not really
aesthetically pleasing), and the
structure is a series of revue
sketches, which also reflects the
period in which it was made. It
isn't consistently hilarious, but
the best parts (like a sequence
in which Moore plays a nun
who has taken a vow of silence)
are wonderful.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Eating Raoul.
Betrayal
Bijou, Palo Alto
Typically, this Harold Pinter
play (first produced in 1978)
fails in adaptation: the acid ex
changes between the charac
ters have a hollow sound on
film, and the ambiguities sud
denly seem bald and obvious.
The director, David Jones, seeks
to solve the problems inherent
in the bare-bones theatrical
structure (the play traces the in
timate relationship of three
people by moving backwards
through time) by bringing the
play as close as possible to natu
ralism, which turns Pinter into
bad Ibsen. Jeremy Irons' and
Patricia Hodge's naturalistic
performances point up all the
wrong things about the materi
al, but Ben Kingsley gives a
stunningly complex demon
stration of Pinter's message in
all his plays — that human
beings are capable of feeling
and inflicting more injury than
words can chart. Within the lim
its of the style Pinter demands,
it's a near-great performance.
