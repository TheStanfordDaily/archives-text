# Former Minnesota governor calls for high taxes, job bills

### KEVIN CROSS Staff writer 
Former Minnesota Gov. Harold
Stassen would like to raise taxes, ex
pand the U.S. government to create
jobs, cooperate with the Soviet
Union and buy a homeland for the
Palestinians, he told a Branner Hall
audience here yesterday.
Stassen, who ran for the Republi
can presidential nomination in 1980,
advocated an absolute minimum tax
for corporations and individuals and
a 10 percent nationwide sales tax. He
also called for an increased import
tax which would create "a world de
fense fund."
When asked if the 10 percent sales
tax would exempt food and neces
sities to avoid placing an extra bur
den on the poor, Stassen implied
that there would be no exemptions.
It's not as regressive as inflation and
unemployment . . . you do need to
turn and start taking revenue from
the whole retail economy," Stassen
said. A similar tax levied by many
European nations is known as a
"value-added tax."
In addition to raising taxes, Stassen
also recommended that the nation
expand the government sector of the

economy. "Government on all
levels, conducted with intelligence
and integrity, must be increasing
rather than decreasing for a success
ful, free economy (and) full employ
ment."
According to Stassen, the govern
ment needs to take a bigger role in
the economy because of the need to
expand the service sector. Current
dpc ision makers have failed to com
prehend the significance of robots
and automated production, which
will reduce the number of employ
ees needed by the manufacturing
sector of the economy, he said. "The
highway to full employment cannot
be found along the path of shrinking
government."
Stassen, who is a former member
of the National Security Council and
a past president of the University of
Pennsylvania, also presented several
ideas for dealing with foreign policy
problems. Unlike the current
hardline policy represented by the
Reagan administration, Stassen said
he believes that there needs to be
more cooperation between the
United States and the Soviet Union.
"All of the peoples living on this
earth have a right to live. There is

room for all of them. Their systems of
economy and government and reli
gion are different, and will continue
to be so," Stassen said. "For leaders
of the superpowers with nuclear
weapons to sit in their capitols and
bombard each other with extreme
words makes absolutely no sense."
