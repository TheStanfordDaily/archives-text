# White House to investigate Hoover fellow
## 
### GLENN BAKER Staff writer 
Edward Teller, the reknowned
physicist and senior fellow of the
Hoover Institution who has strongly
advocated President Reagan's pro
posal to use space-age techniques in
the development of a nuclear de
fense system, is under investigation
by White House officials for the re
ceipt of free stock in a small laser
technology corporation.
The investigation, headed by
White House counsel Fred Fielding,
is expected to focus on the propriety
of Teller's receipt of 40,000 free
shares of stock worth about $880,000
in the company Helionetics, and
whether he used "insider" informa
tion to make a profit on the sale of
the stock.
The Securities and Exchange
Committee (SEC), meanwhile, began
what officials described as a "routine
examination" of the extremely heavy
trading in the stock March 16-22. In a
March 23 address, Reagan urged all
scientists and businessmen in the
United States to develop a sophisti
cated outer space defense system,
which might include powerful lasers
such as those manufactured by
Helionetics that could destroy
enemy missiles in mid-flight.
Teller, the prime force responsible
for the development of the hydrogen
bomb, was in Washington yesterday,
and could not be reached for com
ment. Hoover Public Affairs Director
George Marotta, reached at home,
said on the subject, "I just don't have
any comment because it doesn't af
fect the Hoover Institution at all."
Earlier, his secretary related that
Marotta would have "no comment
on the entire thing because it is an
individual concern with one of the
scholars."
In addition to his work at Stanford,
Teller is a paid consultant at the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory,
which is working on an x-ray laser
program quite similar to the program
Teller proposed to Reagan. How
ever, a Livermore spokesman said
there is no connection between Tel

ler'swork at Helioneticsand his work
at Livermore.
Arthur Bienenstock, director of
the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory, said that he didn't know
if Reagan's laser weapons proposal
would help the company. "I can't
guarantee that they're not going to
benefit from it, but I don't know the
company well enough to say they're
going to be helped," he said.
Dr. Lowell Wood, an assistant to
Teller, told a Los Angeles Times re-

porter that it was Teller and himself
who had briefed Reagan, in Septem
ber 1982, on x-ray technology and its
relevance to an anti-missile defense.
In addition, he said, it was Teller
who first got Reagan interested in the
potential of a space-age defense sys
tem when Reagan was governor of
California.
After Teller's discussion with the
congressional committee, Rep.
Francis McCloskey (D-lnd.) told a re
porter that "most Americans don't
receive free or discounted blocks of
stock" and that presidential advisers
should "avoid perceptions of con
flict of interest," while Rep. Ronald
Coleman (D-Texas) said Teller's ac
tions "smack of impropriety."
