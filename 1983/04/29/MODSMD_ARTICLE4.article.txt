# White House to investigate Hoover fellow
## 
### GLENN BAKER Staff writer 
Edward Teller, the reknowned
physicist and senior fellow of the
Hoover Institution who has strongly
advocated President Reagan's pro
posal to use space-age techniques in
the development of a nuclear de
fense system, is under investigation
by White House officials for the re
ceipt of free stock in a small laser
technology corporation.
The investigation, headed by
White House counsel Fred Fielding,
is expected to focus on the propriety
of Teller's receipt of 40,000 free
shares of stock worth about $880,000
in the company Helionetics, and
whether he used "insider" informa
tion to make a profit on the sale of
the stock.
The Securities and Exchange
Committee (SEC), meanwhile, began
what officials described as a "routine
examination" of the extremely heavy
trading in the stock March 16-22. In a
March 23 address, Reagan urged all
scientists and businessmen in the
United States to develop a sophisti
cated outer space defense system,
which might include powerful lasers
such as those manufactured by
Helionetics that could destroy
enemy missiles in mid-flight.
Teller, the prime force responsible
for the development of the hydrogen
bomb, was in Washington yesterday,
and could not be reached for com
ment. Hoover Public Affairs Director
George Marotta, reached at home,
said on the subject, "I just don't have
any comment because it doesn't af
fect the Hoover Institution at all."
Earlier, his secretary related that
Marotta would have "no comment
on the entire thing because it is an
individual concern with one of the
scholars."
In addition to his work at Stanford,
Teller is a paid consultant at the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory,
which is working on an x-ray laser
program quite similar to the program
Teller proposed to Reagan. How
ever, a Livermore spokesman said
there is no connection between Tel

ler'swork at Helioneticsand his work
at Livermore.
Arthur Bienenstock, director of
the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory, said that he didn't know
if Reagan's laser weapons proposal
would help the company. "I can't
guarantee that they're not going to
benefit from it, but I don't know the
company well enough to say they're
going to be helped," he said.
Dr. Lowell Wood, an assistant to
Teller, told a Los Angeles Times re-

porter that it was Teller and himself
who had briefed Reagan, in Septem
ber 1982, on x-ray technology and its
relevance to an anti-missile defense.
In addition, he said, it was Teller
who first got Reagan interested in the
potential of a space-age defense sys
tem when Reagan was governor of
California.
After Teller's discussion with the
congressional committee, Rep.
Francis McCloskey (D-lnd.) told a re
porter that "most Americans don't
receive free or discounted blocks of
stock" and that presidential advisers
should "avoid perceptions of con
flict of interest," while Rep. Ronald
Coleman (D-Texas) said Teller's ac
tions "smack of impropriety."


Edward Teller
But Teller, in a talk before a con
gressional subcommittee yesterday,
said that his connection with
Helionetics posed no conflict of
interest.
Teller, in an interview with the
New York Times, said he did not
know of the president's plans before
the speech. Hedeclined to talk about
his conversations with Reagan and
other administrators, but said that
Helionetics was not mentioned in
any way.
Charles lobbinn, a spokesman for
Helionetics, told the Daily the com
pany had ho prior knowledge of
Reagan's proposal. "Teller is a very
honorable man. Anytime there was a

conflict of interest, he didn't even
get close," Jobbinn said. He added,
"It is quite routine to give beneficial
stock options to attract the best
people."
jobbinn attacked the New York
Times story which brought out the
connection between the firm and
Teller as "one of the greatest pieces
of yellow journalism I've seen. To
even suggest such innuendo as this
on one of our great Americans is just
preposterous."
Interestingly, however, jobbinn
claimed "Reagan's 'Star Wars' pro
posal would have no effect on us be
cause we don't make any lasers that
would be used in defense." The
company's laser division currently
has no Department of Defense proj
ects, jobbinn said, but would like to
work on defense projects in the fu

ture.
In the week before Reagan's
speech the stock of the company
rose by some 30 percent, from $13.50
to $17.50, while the volume of trad
ing was about 50 percent higher than
the average volume this year. Fur
thermore, there is no public record
of who bought and sold Helionetics
stock in the week before Reagan's
address. The price of Helionetics
shares closed Thursday at an asking
price of $22 a share.
Besides Teller, it was learned,
Robert Keith Gray, a Washington
publicist and a close friend of the
Reagan family, received a block of
stock, as did formeriAdmiral Thomas
Hayward, who retired last year as
chief of Naval Operations.

Hoover Institution who has strongly
advocated President Reagan's pro
posal to use space-age techniques in
the development of a nuclear de
fense system, is under investigation
by White House officials for the re
ceipt of free stock in a small laser
technology corporation.
The investigation, headed by
White House counsel Fred Fielding,
is expected to focus on the propriety
of Teller's receipt of 40,000 free
shares of stock worth about $880,000
in the company Helionetics, and
whether he used "insider" informa
tion to make a profit on the sale of
the stock.
The Securities and Exchange
Committee (SEC), meanwhile, began
what officials described as a "routine
examination" of the extremely heavy
trading in the stock March 16-22. In a
March 23 address, Reagan urged all
scientists and businessmen in the
United States to develop a sophisti
cated outer space defense system,
which might include powerful lasers
such as those manufactured by
Helionetics that could destroy
enemy missiles in mid-flight.
Teller, the prime force responsible
for the development of the hydrogen
bomb, was in Washington yesterday,
and could not be reached for com
ment. Hoover Public Affairs Director
George Marotta, reached at home,
said on the subject, "I just don't have
any comment because it doesn't af
fect the Hoover Institution at all."
Earlier, his secretary related that
Marotta would have "no comment
on the entire thing because it is an
individual concern with one of the
scholars."
In addition to his work at Stanford,
Teller is a paid consultant at the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory,
which is working on an x-ray laser
program quite similar to the program
Teller proposed to Reagan. How
ever, a Livermore spokesman said
there is no connection between Tel

ler'swork at Helioneticsand his work
at Livermore.
Arthur Bienenstock, director of
the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory, said that he didn't know
if Reagan's laser weapons proposal
would help the company. "I can't
guarantee that they're not going to
benefit from it, but I don't know the
company well enough to say they're
going to be helped," he said.
Dr. Lowell Wood, an assistant to
Teller, told a Los Angeles Times re-

porter that it was Teller and himself
who had briefed Reagan, in Septem
ber 1982, on x-ray technology and its
relevance to an anti-missile defense.
In addition, he said, it was Teller
who first got Reagan interested in the
potential of a space-age defense sys
tem when Reagan was governor of
California.
After Teller's discussion with the
congressional committee, Rep.
Francis McCloskey (D-lnd.) told a re
porter that "most Americans don't
receive free or discounted blocks of
stock" and that presidential advisers
should "avoid perceptions of con
flict of interest," while Rep. Ronald
Coleman (D-Texas) said Teller's ac
tions "smack of impropriety."

But Teller, in a talk before a con
gressional subcommittee yesterday,
said that his connection with
Helionetics posed no conflict of
interest.
Teller, in an interview with the
New York Times, said he did not
know of the president's plans before
the speech. Hedeclined to talk about
his conversations with Reagan and
other administrators, but said that
Helionetics was not mentioned in
any way.
Charles lobbinn, a spokesman for
Helionetics, told the Daily the com
pany had ho prior knowledge of
Reagan's proposal. "Teller is a very
honorable man. Anytime there was a

conflict of interest, he didn't even
get close," Jobbinn said. He added,
"It is quite routine to give beneficial
stock options to attract the best
people."
jobbinn attacked the New York
Times story which brought out the
connection between the firm and
Teller as "one of the greatest pieces
of yellow journalism I've seen. To
even suggest such innuendo as this
on one of our great Americans is just
preposterous."
Interestingly, however, jobbinn
claimed "Reagan's 'Star Wars' pro
posal would have no effect on us be
cause we don't make any lasers that
would be used in defense." The
company's laser division currently
has no Department of Defense proj
ects, jobbinn said, but would like to
work on defense projects in the fu

ture.
In the week before Reagan's
speech the stock of the company
rose by some 30 percent, from $13.50
to $17.50, while the volume of trad
ing was about 50 percent higher than
the average volume this year. Fur
thermore, there is no public record
of who bought and sold Helionetics
stock in the week before Reagan's
address. The price of Helionetics
shares closed Thursday at an asking
price of $22 a share.
Besides Teller, it was learned,
Robert Keith Gray, a Washington
publicist and a close friend of the
Reagan family, received a block of
stock, as did formeriAdmiral Thomas
Hayward, who retired last year as
chief of Naval Operations.
