# Faculty, students debate Code
## 
### JANE MCCONNELL Staff writer 
There is no problem with the Honor Code — the
Honor Code Commission is just drumming up a con
troversy where none exists, said Prof. |ohn Brauman,
chairman of the Chemistry Department, at an open
forum on the Honor Code held last night in Branner
Lounge.
"This is a non-problem. I don't understand why
everyone's getting so excited about it," Brauman said.
ASSU Council of Presidents member Mark Epstein,
who first charged Chemistry Prof. |ohn Collman with
violating the Honor Code, responded by saying that it is
the principle which is at stake.
"It's the principle of the issue," he said. "In a system if
you aim high and fall, you're still higher than if you
aimed low."
Because of the recent controversy over the presence
of teaching assistants (TAs) during examinations in Col
lman's classes, the Honor Code Commission has been
seriously examining the problems related to the Honor
Code.
"When students violate the Honor Code that is a viola
tion of the spirit of the University, not just the Honor
Code," said Ombudsman lohn Goheen. He added that
"most of the University conforms to the Honor Code
anyway," but those problems that do exist are a result of
ignorance.
"Whereas students must sign an agreement to abide
by the Honor Code, faculty members don't. Many visit
ing faculty members and faculty who've been around for
<1 long time don't even know about it,"he said.
Brauman agreed that in general, the University con
forms to the Honor Code well. "It is supported by a
significant number of the faculty," he said.
However, he added that in classes like chemistry,

where many questions arise during the exam period, it's
beneficial to the students to have TAs sitting in the front
of the room.
"There's too much emphasis on grade performance
here anyway, which turns this into a highly competitive
atmosphere," he said. "This controversy about the
Honor Code doesn't help matters at all."
Brauman said t hat in his 20 years as a chemistry teacher
there has never been a student turned in by a TA for
cheating on an exam. "That shows right there that the
TAs are not proctoring the exams," he said.
"The TAs are left in the room because of the high
degree of tension in a chemistry exam. I haven't heard
any complaints about it from the students," he said.
Epstein's argument was that the TAs could just as eas
ily be positioned in the back of the room instead of the
front, thereby eliminating the chance that they could
proctor the exams. Brauman did not respond to this
argument, but stressed the fact that he was speaking for
himself and not as a representative of the Chemistry
Department.
Chairman of the Honor Code Commission Karen
Adams said that the problem stems from a misun
derstanding of what proctoring is. "Proctoring means
the presence of teachers or teaching assistants in the
exam room to prevent dishonesty," she said.
Epstein proposed that we should either abide by the
Honor Code entirely, or abolish it.
"I agree with a professor in the Law School who said,
I'd rather see proctoring than have a system that so
poorly describes what we do,' " he said.
Brauman responded that the system may not be per
fect, but it works very well on the whole. "You're going
to run into problems if you try and make everything 100
percent consistent," he said.
