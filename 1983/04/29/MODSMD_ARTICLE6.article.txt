## Battle heats up on animal research bill 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Biomedical researchers and animal-rights ac
tivists across the state are hotly disputing the
potential effects of an animal research bill mak
ing its way through the State Senate.
Senate bill 883, sponsored by Sen. David
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) prohibits shelters and
pounds from selling unclaimed animals to re
searchers.
The measure passed the Senate Judiciary
Committee last week. It is opposed by a coalition
of universities, health organizations and medical
schools — including the Stanford University
Medical Center. The bill is now awaiting a hear
ing before the Senate Finance Committee.
The measure makes it a misdemeanor for any
shelter or pound to sell animals to research in
stitutions. Instead, scientists would have to use
animals bred especially for research.
Despite the powerful coalition against the bill,
individuals on both sides of the issue say it has a
good chance of passing.
John Millen, administrative assistant to
Roberti, said he is confident the broad support
the bill has among animal-rights groups will en

sure its passage. People are growing "very con
cerned about animals," he said.
Larry Horton, director of government relations
here, said Roberti is a "very skilled legislator"
and hisbill hasan "excellent chance" of success.
The fight over the measure has been very bit
ter.
"The arguments that have been forwarded by
the Medical School authorities are bogus," said
Lise Giraud, member of the board of directors of
the Palo Mto Humane Society. She added that
Medical School spokesmen are "not telling the
truth"and "not playing with a full deck."
The Medical Center says the bill will have many
"unnecessary and undesirable effects," includ
ing an increase in the number of animals killed in
pounds and the curtailment of vital research
projects.
Animals are used in research on organ trans
plantations, cancer, heart disease and many
other disorders. Medical School Dean Dominick
Purpura said the bill will affect research on "ev
ery aspect of the kinds of diseases that affect
mankind."
According to Medical Center spokesman
Michael Coodkind, the measure means that

breeders would create life "for the sole purpose
of experimentation." Meanwhile, millions of
"unwanted pound animals" would be needlessly
put to sleep.
But accordingto Millen, Roberti's bill will reas
sure pet owners, protect animals and make shel
ters more efficient.
Pet owners shouldn't worry that animals they
turn into pounds might be used in research, Mil
len said. Although "on the surface" the bill may
appear to result in more animal deaths, Millen
said, it will actually lead to the "more efficient
use of shelters" because people will turn in more
strays.
Giraud said many people "rightfully dread"
that animals they turn into pounds will be used in
research. As a result, the stray population in
creases.
"They just release them on the street," she
said.
But Coodkind said people who have this fear
need only make a "simple phone call" to find a
pound that does not sell its animals to re
searchers.
"I would dispute that as a rational reason for

1976. A bill currently under debate in the state legislature would prohibit
laboratory research on animals taken from pounds.
passing the bill," he said.
In addition, Coodkind said, the
Medical Center is now supporting
another bill that will address the
problem. It will give individuals turn
ing in an animal the option of refus
ing to permit the pound to sell the
animal to researchers.
This measure, the Pet Identifica
tion and Protection Act, also requires
research institutions to meet stan
dards of humane trealment of animal
research subjects. In addition, it calls
for the establishment of a statewide
identification system to help owners
locate their lost animals.
Millen said he had not read this bill
yet. Giraud called it an "eye-wash"
bill. She added that animal rights ac
tivists will continue to work for the
complete elimination of the use of
pound animals in research.
Another aspect of Roberti's bill
disputed by both sides is the viability
of using specially bred animals,
rather than pound animals, in exper
iments.
Coodkind said specially bred ani
mals are "not as desirable to use in
many experiments." Such animals
often come from the same genetic
strain, which can skew the results of
the experiment.
James Dewson, director of labora
tory animal medicine, agreed that

some heterogeneity was "advisable"
in many experiments.
But Millen said specially bred labo
ratory animals make "cleaner, better
research tools" because the re
searchers know the animals' back
ground.
Another source of dispute is the
cost of these specially bred animals.
Goodkind said the bill could quad
ruple the initial costs of animal pur
chase.
The total research budget at the
University last year for projects in
volving animals was $2.6 million. Of
this amount, $65,000 was spent on
obtaining dogs and cats. If the bill
passes, that figure could go up to
$260,000 a year, Goodkind said.
Millen said the researchers' claims
of increased costs are frequently
exaggerated.
But both Giraud and Virginia Shef
chick, director of Californians for
Humane Legislation, said the in
crease in research costs would be a
desirable result of the bill.
The increased cost of research
animals will provide a "check on the
quantity of dogs used," Giraud said.
Roberti, the powerful president
pro tem of the Senate, introduced a
similar bill last year. It was approved
by the Senate, but it failed to pass in
the Assembly on the final night of the
legislative session.
According to Millen, Stanford was
"instrumental" in the defeat of the
bill last year. This year, Roberti added

a new clause prohibiting the impor
tation of pound animals for research
purposes from other states.
Stanford currently imports all of its
research animals from out of state,
Goodkind said. If passed, the Roberti
bill would stop this importation in
1986.

ter.
"The arguments that have been forwarded by
the Medical School authorities are bogus," said
Lise Giraud, member of the board of directors of
the Palo Mto Humane Society. She added that
Medical School spokesmen are "not telling the
truth"and "not playing with a full deck."
The Medical Center says the bill will have many
"unnecessary and undesirable effects," includ
ing an increase in the number of animals killed in
pounds and the curtailment of vital research
projects.
Animals are used in research on organ trans
plantations, cancer, heart disease and many
other disorders. Medical School Dean Dominick
Purpura said the bill will affect research on "ev
ery aspect of the kinds of diseases that affect
mankind."
According to Medical Center spokesman
Michael Coodkind, the measure means that

breeders would create life "for the sole purpose
of experimentation." Meanwhile, millions of
"unwanted pound animals" would be needlessly
put to sleep.
But accordingto Millen, Roberti's bill will reas
sure pet owners, protect animals and make shel
ters more efficient.
Pet owners shouldn't worry that animals they
turn into pounds might be used in research, Mil
len said. Although "on the surface" the bill may
appear to result in more animal deaths, Millen
said, it will actually lead to the "more efficient
use of shelters" because people will turn in more
strays.
Giraud said many people "rightfully dread"
that animals they turn into pounds will be used in
research. As a result, the stray population in
creases.
"They just release them on the street," she
said.
But Coodkind said people who have this fear
need only make a "simple phone call" to find a
pound that does not sell its animals to re
searchers.
"I would dispute that as a rational reason for

1976. A bill currently under debate in the state legislature would prohibit
laboratory research on animals taken from pounds.
passing the bill," he said.
In addition, Coodkind said, the
Medical Center is now supporting
another bill that will address the
problem. It will give individuals turn
ing in an animal the option of refus
ing to permit the pound to sell the
animal to researchers.
This measure, the Pet Identifica
tion and Protection Act, also requires
research institutions to meet stan
dards of humane trealment of animal
research subjects. In addition, it calls
for the establishment of a statewide
identification system to help owners
locate their lost animals.
Millen said he had not read this bill
yet. Giraud called it an "eye-wash"
bill. She added that animal rights ac
tivists will continue to work for the
complete elimination of the use of
pound animals in research.
Another aspect of Roberti's bill
disputed by both sides is the viability
of using specially bred animals,
rather than pound animals, in exper
iments.
Coodkind said specially bred ani
mals are "not as desirable to use in
many experiments." Such animals
often come from the same genetic
strain, which can skew the results of
the experiment.
James Dewson, director of labora
tory animal medicine, agreed that

some heterogeneity was "advisable"
in many experiments.
But Millen said specially bred labo
ratory animals make "cleaner, better
research tools" because the re
searchers know the animals' back
ground.
Another source of dispute is the
cost of these specially bred animals.
Goodkind said the bill could quad
ruple the initial costs of animal pur
chase.
The total research budget at the
University last year for projects in
volving animals was $2.6 million. Of
this amount, $65,000 was spent on
obtaining dogs and cats. If the bill
passes, that figure could go up to
$260,000 a year, Goodkind said.
Millen said the researchers' claims
of increased costs are frequently
exaggerated.
But both Giraud and Virginia Shef
chick, director of Californians for
Humane Legislation, said the in
crease in research costs would be a
desirable result of the bill.
The increased cost of research
animals will provide a "check on the
quantity of dogs used," Giraud said.
Roberti, the powerful president
pro tem of the Senate, introduced a
similar bill last year. It was approved
by the Senate, but it failed to pass in
the Assembly on the final night of the
legislative session.
According to Millen, Stanford was
"instrumental" in the defeat of the
bill last year. This year, Roberti added

a new clause prohibiting the impor
tation of pound animals for research
purposes from other states.
Stanford currently imports all of its
research animals from out of state,
Goodkind said. If passed, the Roberti
bill would stop this importation in
1986.
Biomedical researchers and animal-rights ac
tivists across the state are hotly disputing the
potential effects of an animal research bill mak
ing its way through the State Senate.
Senate bill 883, sponsored by Sen. David
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) prohibits shelters and
pounds from selling unclaimed animals to re
searchers.
The measure passed the Senate Judiciary
Committee last week. It is opposed by a coalition
of universities, health organizations and medical
schools — including the Stanford University
Medical Center. The bill is now awaiting a hear
ing before the Senate Finance Committee.
The measure makes it a misdemeanor for any
shelter or pound to sell animals to research in
stitutions. Instead, scientists would have to use
animals bred especially for research.
Despite the powerful coalition against the bill,
individuals on both sides of the issue say it has a
good chance of passing.
John Millen, administrative assistant to
Roberti, said he is confident the broad support
the bill has among animal-rights groups will en

sure its passage. People are growing "very con
cerned about animals," he said.
Larry Horton, director of government relations
here, said Roberti is a "very skilled legislator"
and hisbill hasan "excellent chance" of success.
