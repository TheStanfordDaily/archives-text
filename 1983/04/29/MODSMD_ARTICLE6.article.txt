## Battle heats up on animal research bill 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Biomedical researchers and animal-rights ac
tivists across the state are hotly disputing the
potential effects of an animal research bill mak
ing its way through the State Senate.
Senate bill 883, sponsored by Sen. David
Roberti (D-Los Angeles) prohibits shelters and
pounds from selling unclaimed animals to re
searchers.
The measure passed the Senate Judiciary
Committee last week. It is opposed by a coalition
of universities, health organizations and medical
schools â€” including the Stanford University
Medical Center. The bill is now awaiting a hear
ing before the Senate Finance Committee.
The measure makes it a misdemeanor for any
shelter or pound to sell animals to research in
stitutions. Instead, scientists would have to use
animals bred especially for research.
Despite the powerful coalition against the bill,
individuals on both sides of the issue say it has a
good chance of passing.
John Millen, administrative assistant to
Roberti, said he is confident the broad support
the bill has among animal-rights groups will en

sure its passage. People are growing "very con
cerned about animals," he said.
Larry Horton, director of government relations
here, said Roberti is a "very skilled legislator"
and hisbill hasan "excellent chance" of success.
The fight over the measure has been very bit
ter.
"The arguments that have been forwarded by
the Medical School authorities are bogus," said
Lise Giraud, member of the board of directors of
the Palo Mto Humane Society. She added that
Medical School spokesmen are "not telling the
truth"and "not playing with a full deck."
The Medical Center says the bill will have many
"unnecessary and undesirable effects," includ
ing an increase in the number of animals killed in
pounds and the curtailment of vital research
projects.
Animals are used in research on organ trans
plantations, cancer, heart disease and many
other disorders. Medical School Dean Dominick
Purpura said the bill will affect research on "ev
ery aspect of the kinds of diseases that affect
mankind."
According to Medical Center spokesman
Michael Coodkind, the measure means that

breeders would create life "for the sole purpose
of experimentation." Meanwhile, millions of
"unwanted pound animals" would be needlessly
put to sleep.
But accordingto Millen, Roberti's bill will reas
sure pet owners, protect animals and make shel
ters more efficient.
Pet owners shouldn't worry that animals they
turn into pounds might be used in research, Mil
len said. Although "on the surface" the bill may
appear to result in more animal deaths, Millen
said, it will actually lead to the "more efficient
use of shelters" because people will turn in more
strays.
Giraud said many people "rightfully dread"
that animals they turn into pounds will be used in
research. As a result, the stray population in
creases.
"They just release them on the street," she
said.
But Coodkind said people who have this fear
need only make a "simple phone call" to find a
pound that does not sell its animals to re
searchers.
"I would dispute that as a rational reason for
