# Ehrlichman recalls Watergate activities
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Watergate "had a half-life of about
10 years and will continue to wane
until it's pretty well forgotten except
as a distant historic event," said |ohn
Ehrlichman, a former top adviser to
Richard Nixon who visited the cam
pus yesterday as a guest lecturer in a
class taught by Paul (Pete) McClos
key.
Ehrlichman, a Stanford Law School
alumnus, devoted most of his time to
anecdotal recollections of his time in
the White House. He reflected on
the circumstances surrounding
Watergate and the activities of the
White House Plumbers, peppering
his comments with references to
more recent administrations.
Although Ehrlichman tended to
minimize his personal involvement
in the events which led to the re
signation of then-President Nixon,
he claimed that he was not bitter
about the time he spent in prison. He
even expressed hope that his son
would "someday get involved in
politics."
Ehrlichman was, however, less en
thusiastic about Congress.
"McCloskey wrote me a letter and
told me he was teaching a course on
decision-making in the Congress.
That anomaly so intrigued me that I
decided that I had to come up and
see if that was really true. I was only
in Washington five years and I'm sure
that during that time Congress made
a decision but I guess I missed it."
Assessing the current administra
tion, Ehrlichman gave President Re
agan a "C+ for effectiveness and
leadership." He also had a sugges
tion regarding Reagan's use of
executive privilege to withhold doc
uments requested by Congress in
the Environmental Protection
Agency shake-up. "The dirtiest trick
you can play on a congressman is to
give him everything he asks for be

cause he doesn't like to work that
hard.
"The way that Ronald Reagan
should have solved the Environmen
tal Protection Agency problem was to
back trucks up and load them up with
all those boxes, deliver all that stuff
to the Congress and say, 'Here.
Here's what you asked for.' "
Ehrlichman said Nixon's biggest
mistake in his handling of Watergate
was that he failed to keep his dis
tance. "In listening to the tapes, I
discovered that Richard Nixon had
personally involved himself almost
from the first week of the covering
up," he said.
"Richard Nixon as an individual
was compulsively intrigued with in
trigue and couldn't leave it alone.
He'd have been better off reading
mystery novels at night but he found
his outlet in this other way. Water
gate came into the White House in a
very fatal way."
In defense of the burglary of
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office
by the White House Plumbers,
Ehrlichman claimed that the burglary
was not committed for political rea
sons but in order to defend "national
security."
Ehrlichman said the Ellsberg inves
tigation was given back burner status
by the Federal Bureau of Investiga
tion (FBI) because of a close friend
ship between then-FBI head j. Edgar
Hoover and Lewis Marks, Ellsberg's
father-in-law.
Ehrlichman said no one could es
cape Hoover's influence. "He was
constantly sending the president lit
tle inside stuff about people in public
life, movie stars, and some presi
dents have a little stronger prurient
strain than others. He (Hoover) culti
vated us like a vegetabe garden —
and by us I mean the Congress, the
executive branch and the Supreme
Court.
