## Internment decision challenged 
### DANNY PEARL 
C. laiming evidence presented by the Justice
Department was false, five law students here are
working on a "friend of the court" brief seeking
to correct the record which is the basis of a
Supreme Court decision legitimating the im
prisonment of Japanese citizens on the West
Coast during World War 11.
1 he efforts here constitute only part of a wide
spread effort to establish that evidence pre
sented to the Supreme Court in Korematsu v.
United States was misleading and false. The
American Civil Liberties Union and several other
groups are also working on amicus curiae
(friend of the court) briefs.
In its decision, the Supreme Court relied
upon facts presented by the Justice Department
to determine that imprisoning all Japanese in
western states was "necessary to the ac
complishment of a compelling state interest."
I hough the Korematsu precedent has been
controversial since the decision was handed
down, the case itself has been dormant. After
World War 11, Korematsu resettled in the Bay
Area and faded comfortably into obscurity. No
further action was taken until Korematsu's case
was reopened last year after a San Diego profes
sor waded through documents released
through the Freedom of Information Act. The
professor found inconsistencies in the final re
port presented to the Court in 1944.
Korematsu's attorneys filed an appeal in the
9th District Court last January. Neisser offered
the briel as a project for his course in constitu
tional litigation. The students who volunteered
have been doing intensive research, meeting
weekly to discuss their progress. The brief
should be completed by June.
Fred Korematsu became the focus of this con
troversial case — one of the most famous legal
decisions in U.S. history — when he refused to
obey the 1942 Civilian Exclusion Orders which
directed him to an internment camp.
Korematsu, who worked as a welder in a Bay
Area shipyard, was one of three Japanese
Americans who refused the federal mandates
which commanded all West Coast Japanese
Americans to report for relocation to intern
ment camps. All three were arrested and con
victed for violating the orders.
Korematsu appealed his case all the way to the
Supreme Court, claiming his right to equal pro
tection under the law had been violated. The
Court disagreed. In a historic 1944 decision
which is still controversial, the Court ruled that

the constitutional rights of certain specified
groups may be denied only when so doing
would be "necessary to accomplishment of
compelling state interest."
Law students Dan Cohn, Sarah Lipscomb,
Steven Riegle, Cynthia Robbins and Rick Stein
berg claim that the facts presented by the lustice
Department to the Supreme Court were false
and misleading.
"We're basically trying to give the court a
broader prespective," said Neisser. "We want
to give them the historical law background on
the case."
The Justice Department report claimed there
was a problem of espionage and sabotage
among Japanese Americans and that a racial
criterion had to be used since it was impossible
to separate loyal citizens from disloyal citizens.
The documents uncovered by the San Diego
professor indicate that the government knew
these allegations to be false.
The Korematsu case, according to Neisser,
raises a host of constitutional questions.
"There's the issue of civilian control over the
military, for one thing. We've also had to re
search cases involving government misconduct
in the courts, and we've looked at due process
and equal protection cases too."
The equal protection issue sets the Korematsu
case apart. The United States Constitution pro
vides equal protection under the law, regardless
of race or national origin. The Korematsu deci
sion states that the racial classifiration created
must be "necessary to the accomplishment of a
compelling state objective.'' The Court in 1944
applied this standard to the Japanese intern
ment and ruled it legal.
"The funny thing about the decision is that is
set up a direct standard for equal protection
cases," said Neisser. "At the same time, it is the
only existing case which holds that racial dis
crimination can be constitutional."
Four decades later, many are doubting that
the internment was necessary for national secu
rity. Said Don Tamaki, one of Karematsu's
lawyers, "Only 3 percent of the Japanese Ameri
cans were disloyal. Of those 3 percent, most
were already in prison and the rest were easily
identifiable. The War Department knew this.
Wartime hysteria was not the only thing in
volved in the Japanese Internment. There was
also a cold, calculated decision to uphold the
decision even if it meant lying to the Supreme
Court."

upon facts presented by the Justice Department
to determine that imprisoning all Japanese in
western states was "necessary to the ac
complishment of a compelling state interest."
I hough the Korematsu precedent has been
controversial since the decision was handed
down, the case itself has been dormant. After
World War 11, Korematsu resettled in the Bay
Area and faded comfortably into obscurity. No
further action was taken until Korematsu's case
was reopened last year after a San Diego profes
sor waded through documents released
through the Freedom of Information Act. The
professor found inconsistencies in the final re
port presented to the Court in 1944.
Korematsu's attorneys filed an appeal in the
9th District Court last January. Neisser offered
the briel as a project for his course in constitu
tional litigation. The students who volunteered
have been doing intensive research, meeting
weekly to discuss their progress. The brief
should be completed by June.
Fred Korematsu became the focus of this con
troversial case — one of the most famous legal
decisions in U.S. history — when he refused to
obey the 1942 Civilian Exclusion Orders which
directed him to an internment camp.
Korematsu, who worked as a welder in a Bay
Area shipyard, was one of three Japanese
Americans who refused the federal mandates
which commanded all West Coast Japanese
Americans to report for relocation to intern
ment camps. All three were arrested and con
victed for violating the orders.
Korematsu appealed his case all the way to the
Supreme Court, claiming his right to equal pro
tection under the law had been violated. The
Court disagreed. In a historic 1944 decision
which is still controversial, the Court ruled that

the constitutional rights of certain specified
groups may be denied only when so doing
would be "necessary to accomplishment of
compelling state interest."
Law students Dan Cohn, Sarah Lipscomb,
Steven Riegle, Cynthia Robbins and Rick Stein
berg claim that the facts presented by the lustice
Department to the Supreme Court were false
and misleading.
"We're basically trying to give the court a
broader prespective," said Neisser. "We want
to give them the historical law background on
the case."
The Justice Department report claimed there
was a problem of espionage and sabotage
among Japanese Americans and that a racial
criterion had to be used since it was impossible
to separate loyal citizens from disloyal citizens.
The documents uncovered by the San Diego
professor indicate that the government knew
these allegations to be false.
The Korematsu case, according to Neisser,
raises a host of constitutional questions.
"There's the issue of civilian control over the
military, for one thing. We've also had to re
search cases involving government misconduct
in the courts, and we've looked at due process
and equal protection cases too."
The equal protection issue sets the Korematsu
case apart. The United States Constitution pro
vides equal protection under the law, regardless
of race or national origin. The Korematsu deci
sion states that the racial classifiration created
must be "necessary to the accomplishment of a
compelling state objective.'' The Court in 1944
applied this standard to the Japanese intern
ment and ruled it legal.
"The funny thing about the decision is that is
set up a direct standard for equal protection
cases," said Neisser. "At the same time, it is the
only existing case which holds that racial dis
crimination can be constitutional."
Four decades later, many are doubting that
the internment was necessary for national secu
rity. Said Don Tamaki, one of Karematsu's
lawyers, "Only 3 percent of the Japanese Ameri
cans were disloyal. Of those 3 percent, most
were already in prison and the rest were easily
identifiable. The War Department knew this.
Wartime hysteria was not the only thing in
volved in the Japanese Internment. There was
also a cold, calculated decision to uphold the
decision even if it meant lying to the Supreme
Court."
