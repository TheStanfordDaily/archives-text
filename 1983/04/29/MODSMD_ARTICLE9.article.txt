Why the "No Turn On Red" at
Junipero Serra and Campus Drive
West? This question has probably been
asked before, but a number of us prob
ably missed the answer.

Asamatteroffact, I've never been of
ficially asked this question — I have fre
quently asked it of myself, while driving
home late at night.
It's a question that needs to be an
swered quickly, because according to
John Lerry in Facilities Project Man
agement the signs will soon be taken
down.
The intersection of Junipero Serra
and Campus Drive West is, historically,
where golf carts cross from the south
side of the golf course to the north. It's
the only place where they can make this
crossing. Embedded in the golf cart
path is a sensor that turns the traffic sig
nal red in all directions when a cart ap
proaches. When auto traffic only
moved east-west on Junipero Serra,
there was no problem; but when the
Campus Drive extension was opened,
Santa Clara County felt that cars turning
right (west) against the red would be
too great a danger to the golf carts,
which aren't all that controllable.
Hence, the sign.
Of course, the golf carts are only in
action during certain hours on certain
days. The cart counter in the path
doesn't operate at night, but it's hard to
turn off a sign. Lerry has now convinced
the county officials that golf cart safety
will be sufficiently served without the
No Right Turn On Red sign, and it is
about to be removed.
How long has there been an ASSU?
There has an Associated Stu
dents nearly as long as there has been a
University. A keen need was felt that
first year (1891) for community. In the
words of Francis J. Batchelder, '04, "Im
agine a state of things with no college

papers, no university or class yells, no
college songs', no football or baseball
teams, no diamond, no football field,
no track, no bleachers, no athletic as
sociation, no tennis courts, no student
body (my italics), no debating or literary
societies, no fraternities or sororities —
no organizations of any kind ..."
One of the first moves those lonely
undergraduates made was to organize
themselves into a student body. The
first meeting of the "Associated Stu
dents" (not quite the ASSU, but surely
there's a direct descent) was held Octo
ber 9,1891 and permanent organization
was achieved October 20. The officers
were Charles Chadsey, president; Carl
S. Smith, vice-president; Miss Martha
Haven, secretary; Archie Rice, treas
urer.
Again I quote Batchelder, as he de
scribed events in The First Year at Stan
ford (Stanford English Club, 1910): "In
order to handle quickly the vast amount
of heavy work which called for im
mediate attention, committees were
appointed to formulate plans and to
make their reports to the main body in
such a complete manner that they
would have only to be approved and
could be put immediately into effect."
Some things never change. Those hero
ic first committees were: Constitution
and By-Laws; Co-op Association; Col
ors; University Yell; Bulletin Board; and
College Paper. (The latter four commit
tees boasted one woman each — the
constitution committee had none. The
gender breakdown of theofficers of the
Associated Students forthesecond year
was identical to the first: male presi
dent, vice-president, and treasurer,
female secretary. A sergeant-at-arms —
male — was added.)
Trivia note: the Alumni Association
was formed June 15,1892 —immediate-
ly following the first graduation cere
mony. The original student body, while
made up mainly of freshmen, also had a

few upperclass transfers — 30 to 50 per
class — so that the University didn't
have to wait four years to have an Alum
ni Association.
Did anyone ever find out who stole
the ASSU flicks?
A lazy reporter
First the history: the night of Sunday,
Dec. 5, someone stole the last three
reels of Personal Best from Memorial
Auditorium and held them for ransom.
Before the reels were found (in a park
ing lot behind Mem Aud), KZSU played
a song of the kidnappers' choice, 1000
people were admitted free to the first
showing of the movie, and Sunday
Flicks employees and police officers
were sent on a wild goose chase with
directions carried onto the Mem Aud
stage by paper airplane. At the time,
there were no suspects.
According to the Stanford Police,
that's where things still stand. I was told
that there were "no workable leads,"
and that the case had been dropped.
Scott Culley, manager of the Flicks, is
no wiser now than he was then, either.
He did say he's recently heard that
"there are a couple of people who
think they know who did it." Apparent
ly a conversation was overheard, and
names were mentioned, but will the
names be remembered ... sounds like
paper airplanes all over again.
I hate to second-guess Operations &
Maintenance — especially when the
Daily is still waiting to have its lights fix
ed and its offices re-wired — but I don't
think the killer caterpillars currently in
festing campus are "oak moths."
What's an oak moth? There are oak
worm moths, but they're only found
east of the Rockies. / think the little
beasties are Western Tussock Moth
caterpillars, members of the same fami
ly as the Gypsy Moth. If anyone can
help clear this up, drop me a line.
