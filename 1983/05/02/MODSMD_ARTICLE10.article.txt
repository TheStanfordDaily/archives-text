Tomorrow night, the ASSU Senate will vote to
determine exactly which candidate, if any, will
be disqualified from the recent elections. At
least, that is what we think is going to happen.
We can't know for sure.
Since news leaked some weeks ago that sev
eral senators-elect and fee assessment groups
might be in danger of being disqualified from
the elections, a shroud of secrecy has veiled the
proceedings of the election hearing commit
tee. The reason for the secrecy, according to the
committee members, is that the hearings might
be affected if the procedures of the commission
are made public.
The absurdity of this reasoning became clear
to us when we found that one senator-elect—
who had agreed to be interviewed during the
process of the review of his alleged campaign
violations—refused to be interviewed further
because yet another charge had been added to
the list of campaign violations: he was guil
ty of talking to the press.
Franklv. this makes us a little uneasy. It is clear

that election rules which control the informa
tion that participants in the review process can
release were written with the intent of protect
ing those candidates being reviewed in the
course of the election. After the polls have
closed, however, only the interests of those
conducting the review are served when infor
mation is suppressed.
The authors of the election reform bill which
debuted in the past election have admitted that
some problems remain to be worked out. As far
as we can tell, all the campaign violations which
may lead to disqualification are rather technical
in nature. The fact that the hearings have been
kept secret enforces this belief.
We really can't be sure of what will happen at
tomorrow night's senate meeting, but if the
senate votes to disqualify senators-elect or fee
assessment groups for minor technicalities or
for the "very serious offense" of talking to the
press, the interests of the students will be
poorly served.
