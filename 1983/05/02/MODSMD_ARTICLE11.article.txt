## It can happen to any woman 
### 
Last year, an estimated 81,000
women in the United States experi
enced the horror of rape. And data
from the U.S. Attorney General's
Office show it's a crime that can hap
pen toany woman, regardless of age,
race, social or economic back
ground. In 1981, the last year for
which reliable data is available,
women as old as 91 and children as
young as two months were victims of
this, one of the nation's most violent
and brutal crimes.

Tragically, the number of rapes increased 74
percent from 1972 to 1981, and more rapes
were reported in the western region of the
United States, including California, than any
other area. In 1981, 98 rapes were reported per
100,000 inhabitants in California.

Legally, rape is defined as "the
carnal knowledge of a female forci
bly and against her will," while cases
have also been reported of men and
boys being "raped," or sexually as
saulted. Educators against rape main
tain this crime is committed most
often to degrade and defile a woman,
and to vent the rapist's feelings of
hostility, aggression and inferiority.
It is usually not committed for sexual
satisfaction, as interviews and
studies show many rapists have con
senting sexual relationships.
Tragically, the number of rapes in
creased 74 percent from 1972 to 1981,
and more rapes were reported in the
western region of the United States,
including California, than any other
area. In 1981, 98 rapes were reported
per 100,000 inhabitants in California,
or about one per 510 women. Even
more frightening is the fact that a
woman was raped right here on
campus in January of 1982 while
another was sexually assaulted and
four more were assaulted in 1981, a
sexual assault being an attempt to
commit rape by force or threat of
force.
All this means the brutal crime of
rape is a growing problem that must
be faced by the public, both men and

women. Its increasing occurrence
indicates it won't "go away" and
can't be ignored. Instead, the com
munity needs to be further educated
about this problem and its dangers.
We, as men, need to better under
stand this crime and its impact, espe
cially so that we may be of comfort to
a woman if she is raped. The whole
experience is traumatic for a victim
and initially she may hate men, have
trouble sleeping, lose her appetite or
be deeply depressed. But as educa-

tors for the National Committee
Against Rape note, these expected
initial reactions don't mean she is
permanently changed but simply
that she needs care, support and un
derstanding. Friends as well as family
are the most important factor to re
covery from the trauma.

The whole experience (of rape) is traumatic for a
victim and initially she may hate men, have
trouble sleeping, lose her appetite or be deeply
depressed. But as educators for the National
Committee Against Rape note, these expected
initial reactions don't mean she is permanently
changed but simply that she needs care.

Further, sometimes we may need
to be reminded that no woman ever
"asks for" or deserves rape. A rape
victim is not treated as a human but
as an object for venting aggression,
and cannot "enjoy" the experience,
despite what any fictional account
may claim.
Women, too, need to be better
educated on how to avoid rape and
rape situations. And they must be
educated on the need to help prose

cute rapists in court in an effort to
protect other women from the same
horror.
Forcible rape is still the most
under-reported of all crimes indexed
in the United States: victims are
often too embarrassed or afraid to
contact police. In 1981, 48 percent of
those arrested on charges of rape
were cleared, many times because a
victim chose not to prosecute.
Women must learn there is no more
reason to feel guilt, shame or embar
rassment than if they had been vic
tims of robbery or any other crime. In
that sense, they should feel it a per
fect right and duty to help prosecute
the criminal.
It should be pointed out that in
past years some women have been
reluctant to report rapes because
they feared the callous or condes
cending attitude toward their plight
that some policemen and doctors
might take. Fortunately, police offi
cers and other authorities are be
coming increasingly aware of how to
deal with victims and their probable
emotional states. Women need to be
reminded that attitudes have
changed and they need not fear re
porting rape for this or any other rea-

son.
It is clear some campus groups are
striving to meet these educational
goals and protect the community
against rape, and this is extremely
welcome. I do not suggest we need
to dwell on this unpleasant crime,
but the community needs to become
more attuned to the problems of
rape and its aftermath.

have also been reported of men and
boys being "raped," or sexually as
saulted. Educators against rape main
tain this crime is committed most
often to degrade and defile a woman,
and to vent the rapist's feelings of
hostility, aggression and inferiority.
It is usually not committed for sexual
satisfaction, as interviews and
studies show many rapists have con
senting sexual relationships.
Tragically, the number of rapes in
creased 74 percent from 1972 to 1981,
and more rapes were reported in the
western region of the United States,
including California, than any other
area. In 1981, 98 rapes were reported
per 100,000 inhabitants in California,
or about one per 510 women. Even
more frightening is the fact that a
woman was raped right here on
campus in January of 1982 while
another was sexually assaulted and
four more were assaulted in 1981, a
sexual assault being an attempt to
commit rape by force or threat of
force.
All this means the brutal crime of
rape is a growing problem that must
be faced by the public, both men and

women. Its increasing occurrence
indicates it won't "go away" and
can't be ignored. Instead, the com
munity needs to be further educated
about this problem and its dangers.
We, as men, need to better under
stand this crime and its impact, espe
cially so that we may be of comfort to
a woman if she is raped. The whole
experience is traumatic for a victim
and initially she may hate men, have
trouble sleeping, lose her appetite or
be deeply depressed. But as educa-

tors for the National Committee
Against Rape note, these expected
initial reactions don't mean she is
permanently changed but simply
that she needs care, support and un
derstanding. Friends as well as family
are the most important factor to re
covery from the trauma.

The whole experience (of rape) is traumatic for a
victim and initially she may hate men, have
trouble sleeping, lose her appetite or be deeply
depressed. But as educators for the National
Committee Against Rape note, these expected
initial reactions don't mean she is permanently
changed but simply that she needs care.

Further, sometimes we may need
to be reminded that no woman ever
"asks for" or deserves rape. A rape
victim is not treated as a human but
as an object for venting aggression,
and cannot "enjoy" the experience,
despite what any fictional account
may claim.
Women, too, need to be better
educated on how to avoid rape and
rape situations. And they must be
educated on the need to help prose

cute rapists in court in an effort to
protect other women from the same
horror.
Forcible rape is still the most
under-reported of all crimes indexed
in the United States: victims are
often too embarrassed or afraid to
contact police. In 1981, 48 percent of
those arrested on charges of rape
were cleared, many times because a
victim chose not to prosecute.
Women must learn there is no more
reason to feel guilt, shame or embar
rassment than if they had been vic
tims of robbery or any other crime. In
that sense, they should feel it a per
fect right and duty to help prosecute
the criminal.
It should be pointed out that in
past years some women have been
reluctant to report rapes because
they feared the callous or condes
cending attitude toward their plight
that some policemen and doctors
might take. Fortunately, police offi
cers and other authorities are be
coming increasingly aware of how to
deal with victims and their probable
emotional states. Women need to be
reminded that attitudes have
changed and they need not fear re
porting rape for this or any other rea-

son.
It is clear some campus groups are
striving to meet these educational
goals and protect the community
against rape, and this is extremely
welcome. I do not suggest we need
to dwell on this unpleasant crime,
but the community needs to become
more attuned to the problems of
rape and its aftermath.

Last year, an estimated 81,000
women in the United States experi
enced the horror of rape. And data
from the U.S. Attorney General's
Office show it's a crime that can hap
pen toany woman, regardless of age,
race, social or economic back
ground. In 1981, the last year for
which reliable data is available,
women as old as 91 and children as
young as two months were victims of
this, one of the nation's most violent
and brutal crimes.

Tragically, the number of rapes increased 74
percent from 1972 to 1981, and more rapes
were reported in the western region of the
United States, including California, than any
other area. In 1981, 98 rapes were reported per
100,000 inhabitants in California.

Legally, rape is defined as "the
carnal knowledge of a female forci

have also been reported of men and

saulted. Educators against rape main
