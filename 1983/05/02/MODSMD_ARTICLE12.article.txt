## Objections to Western Culture illogical 
### 
As a single instructor in Western
Culture, I cannot speak for the rest of
the staff, but I myself find the objec
tions of Steven Phillips to the West
ern Culture program {Daily, April 26)
both erroneous and illogical.
First, the core list for all tracks of
the course specifies at least selec
tions from the Hebrew Bible, which
is most certainly pre-Greek. The
textbook to which Phillips objects,
Edward Burns' Western Civilizations,
devotes the first 103 pages to pre-
Greek, non-European civilizations.
Where, in its individual chapters on
Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Persian,
Hebraic and other civilizations, the
book denies that these civilizations
contributed anything of value to the
West, I would very much like to know
as well.
Phillips advocates the establish
ment of a new track which would
"explain that Pythagoras, Democ
ritus and Socrates got their ideas
from Africa" and "that the Greek
gods are imitations of African gods."
On the one hand, the issue of the
origin of these concepts is scarcely
settled among genuine scholars. On
the other hand, not a few of them
argue for their non-Greek, even if
not quite African, roots. Which
Western Culture readings say other
wise I would appreciate knowing,
too.
Second, it would hardly follow log
ically that even a course which did
begin with the Greeks was thereby
"implying that western civilization
developed independently and free
from outside influences." To focus

on a limited area is to circumvent,
not answer, the question of outside
influence.
Third, the emphasis in the Western
Culture course is, at least for me, not
even on the origin of the ideas
studied but instead on their meaning
or significance. Because the course
falls within the humanities rather
than the social sciences, that empha
sis is, I believe, proper.
Fourth, the origin of an idea has no
necessary bearing on its subsequent
meaning or significance. Put bluntly,
even if all Western ideas originated
in Africa, it would not follow logically
that the West in no way extended
them, not to say extended them far
beyond what their originators had
accomplished.
Finally, it is surely natural rather
than prejudiced or parochial for a
university to require spec ial study of
the civilization of which it is a part. I
would be most surprised if non-
Western universities studied their
own civilizations less fully than the
West. Unless one is sure that Stan
ford students know their own civili
zation well enough to be able to dis
pense with the required study of it,
the non-Western Culture require
ment is, lor me, far harder to justify.

Divided Quebec

I wish to congratulate Bryan Wil
denthal on a generally perceptive ar
ti< le on (Quebec's language problem

However, as one who grew up in
Montreal and who still regularly visits
that lovely city, I feel compelled to
make three observations.
First, the language laws are much
more flexible *han suggested. Con
sider the ones concerning educa
tion. Theoretically, all children must
attend French-language schools un
less both parents were educated in
tnglish in Quebec. Needless to say,
immigrants and temporary residents
from English Canada or the United
States were less than delighted.
Hence the exceptions: private
schools, children intending to stay
no more than three years, and (bot
tom less hypocrisy!) French-
Canadians!
In other words, the burden of mak
ing Quebec French will be borne by
the immigrants, many of whom are
Italian and who would much rather
send their children to English
schools depsite the greater ease of
learning French. As a result, there is a
substantial group of "illegals" in the
English-language school system. Al
though the state refuses to pay for
their schooling, it openly tolerates
this breach of the law. In fact, they
are the subject of frequent media at
tention.
Second, it is only fair to point out
that, on the whole, the English
minority in Quebec has been treatd
tar better than the French minorities
in the other nine provinces. Even to
day, Ontario with over half a million
French-speaking citizens is reluctant
to become bilingual.
Finally, the article might conjure

up images of ethnic warfare in the
streets of Montreal. The reality is less
startling. For the most part, we get
along very well. While no one would
claim that (he two groups are identi
cal (any more than Englishmen and
Frenchmen are identical), the over
whelming majority on each side has a
genuine respect for the particular
talents of the other.
It is not easy to be an island of 6
million Francophones in a sea of 250
million Anglophones. It is not any
easier to be a minority within that
island of 6 million. The resulting ten
sion is virtually a fact of nature. It will
never disappear; one can only hope
that it attenuates with time or is put
to creative cultural use as it was most
brilliantly at the time of the 1967
World Exposition.
