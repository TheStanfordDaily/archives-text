# Marxism: 'nice idea' or necessary?
## 
### 
A common perception of socialism is that it is unwork
able. Though people often grant that it is theoretically a
good idea, the doctrine suffers from the notion that its
goals are unachievable in the "real" world. Socialists,
similarly, are construed as being overly idealistic and
incapable of recognizing real obstacles to their visions.
These views are based on a partial and incomplete
understanding of Marx's writings. Too often, Marx the
Utopian instead of Marx the analytical economist is used
to form opinions regarding the practical prospects of
socialism.
A popular understanding of Marx sees his ideas as
advocating an idealized society where "from each ac
cording to his ability and to each according to his need"
is the general rule of conduct. This system is denounced
as "unrealistic" because of the inherent workings of
"human nature." Although few sociologists, an
thropologists, or geneticists will unhesitatingly define
what "human nature" is or isn't, this ephemeral value is
often the first cited when it comes to defending the
status quo.
This highly disputable (almost philosophical) question
can, however, be avoided in the discussion of Marxian
economics. Unfortunately, the Utopian view is the only
part of Marx familiar to many if not most people. Karl
Marx the economic analyst is virtually unknown. Catch
phrases like "means of production" and "class struggle"
are recognized, but the analytic foundations of these
ideas are simply not part of the popular culture. A
rudimentary understanding of these ideas is necessary
before assessing the validity, or invalidity, of Marxism.
Basically, Marx was concerned with the functionings
of the capitalist economy. Rather than concerning him
self with the workings of the market, as present day
economists tend to do, he asked the basic question
regarding the source of profit in the system. Whereas
classical doctrine said that every person in the system is a
capitalist in that he tries to accumulate wealth, Marx
realized that in reality there were two ways to use
money.
The first is familiar to most of us in quite some detail. A
commodity is sold in exchange for money which in turn
is used to buy useful commodities. We produce goods
or labor for the purpose of exchange in order to obtain
the goods and services we can't produce for ourselves.
The secohd way is not as familiar to us. This method uses
money to purchase commodities which in turn are sold
for even more money. The commodities which are pur
chased, however, are not ordinary commodities. Their
distinguishing characteristic is that they can be used to
create other (exchangeable) goods.
These goods-producing commodities come in two
types: the means of production, and labor power. The
means of production refers to machinery, tools, and
other non-human apparatus necessary in industry.
Labor power is simply that: human exertion.
Marx realized that any profit in the system has to come
at the expense of the variable factor; that is, the human
labor. If a worker produces 6 dollars worth of goods in
an hour and is paid only 4 dollars, the capitalist reaps
the 2 dollars of surplus value. No such profit can be
squeezed from a machine: it has a fixed cost of purchase
and maintenance and can't be fooled into taking less
than it is worth.
Three of Marx's most meaningful contributions to
economic thought come from a critical analysis of the
industrial capitalist system of production. First is the
discovery that capitalism tends to function in "business"
cycles of booms and busts because of overproduction
and underconsumption. This is a widely known and,

judging by the willingness of the nations to "stay the
course," a well-tolerated phenomenon.
Second is the fact that a capitalist economy will tend to
become increasingly capital intensive (more dependent
on machinery than labor). Since profit is extracted from
labor power and not machines, increased technology
means falling rates of profit. If total profits are to be kept
high, then volume must be increased, which of course
leads right back to overproduction.
The third problem is one so fundamental that no
amount of Keynesian "fine tuning" can even begin to
eradicate it. Marx discovered the political and social
ramifications of separating the means of production
from the working classes. The capitalist, though he may
initially have taken a "risk," soon obtains a measure of
wealth and thus attains both political and social status.
With this new power, he can ensure that the relations of
production (that have brought him wealth) are pre
served mainly for himself and his progeny. It is the rare
and extremely fortunate worker who ever gets the oppor
tunity to make a living in ways other than selling his
labor. Thus, there results a stratifying of society into
semi-permanent classes
During times of economic decision-making, it is the
capitalist class (the one with the most political power)
that has the most influence. Any conflict of interest
between worker and capitalist is almost always resolved
in favor of the latter. When there is economic hardship
to be suffered, one can be sure that the working class
will do most of it. The major stockholders of General
Motors and U.S. Steel are certainly not among the 12
million unemployed.
Although labor unions, party politics, and a large ser
vice sector tend to mitigate its pre-eminence, the con
trol of the means of production by a small fraction of the
population remains capitalism's gravest yet most intrin
sic contradiction.
Even in the face of such arguments, the staunch anti-
Marxist will not falter. This is sometimes due to an irra
tional, deep-seated phobia of any person or thing to the
left of Gerald Ford. In these cases, no amount of educa
tion will unlearn what has become part of the involun
tary response system.
Often, however, an aversion to socialism exists be
cause of its link with the Soviet Union. People feel that
Soviet "socialism" is the only socialism possible, and
that any Marxist movement in this country must result in
a Soviet style oligarchy. This is simply not the case.
Karl Marx, first and foremost, was a humanitarian, and
his socialist system was the means for achieving real
human freedom and true equality of opportunity. In the
Soviet Union, human freedom at no point figures in the
analysis. In their formulation, the role of socialism is not
the means to a desirable end, but the end in itself.
The democratization of the factories and farms in
this country need not involve a loss of civil liberties. To
say that socialism and democracy (defined as equality of
political opportunity) cannot co-exist is a lie. (In fact, an
examination of our own country, with gross political and
economic inequalities built into the system, suggests
that if any economic system is incompatible with democ
racy, the system is capitalism.)
A critical appraisal of the capitalist system must see
that the causes of its downfall are built into its system. In
this view, socialists, once regarded merely as Utopians
and dreamers, become planners and visionaries for an
inevitable tomorrow.
