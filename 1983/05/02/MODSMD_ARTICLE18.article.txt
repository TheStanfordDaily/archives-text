## Netmen win Pac-10 title Road wins over LA teams 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The Stanford men's ten
nis team proved it is for real,
that its wins over No. 2 Pep
perdine, No. 3 USC and No.
4 UCLA last week were no
fluke.
What Dick Gould, head
tennis coach, and his Cardi
nal netters did for proof was
simple. They did what for a
Stanford team in years past
has been the impossible —
they swept UCLA and USC
in Los Angeles.
"I don't recall beating
both teams in Los Angeles in
all my 17 years here except
when (john) McEnroe was
here," Gould said.
The pair of 6-3 road vic
tories improved the Cardi
nal's overall record to 19-1
— tops in the nation — and,
more important, upped its
Pac-10 mark to 9-0, clinching
the Pacific-10 title with one
match to go.
Stanford plays host to
UC-Berkeley on Wednes
day in its regular-season
dual match finale at 1:30
p.m. in the Stanford Tennis
Stadium.
"The Pac-10 is nice,"
Gould said. "But it's really
the NCAAs that matter." It is
Stanford's first Pac-10 title
since 1980.
Gould expects his netters
to be seeded second at
Athens, Ga., the site of the
NCAA Championships May
14-22. Southern Methodist
will probably garner the top
ranking, followed by Stan
ford, USC, Pepperdine,
UCLA and Trinity, Gould

predicted.
"And it we are the No. 2 or
No. 3 seed, we won't have
to play the No. 1 seed in the
semi-finals."
In the course of 16 days,
Stanford played the second,
third and fourth-ranked
teams in the nation five
times — and won all five.
The Card has now won 18 in
a row, its only loss coming
to Pepperdine in its second
dual match of the season.
"It does show that we are
starting toget in strideatthe
right time," Gould said.
