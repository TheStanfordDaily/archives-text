# Cardinal hitting missing as Arizona wins twinbill
## 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
No one has to tell the Stan
ford Cardinal that baseball is a
game of inches.
The Card learned first-hand
yesterday as the Arizona
Wildcats swept a doub
leheader by scores of 4-2 and
3-1. Meanwhile, second-place
Arizona State swept its doub
leheader over UCLA to pull
within a half-game of Stanford.
USC is two games back after
splitting a twin-bill with
Cal.
Weekend rains forced
make-up doubleheaders to be
played all along the coast yes
terday. Stanford concludes its
series with Arizona today at 1
p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
In yesterday's second game,
Arizona led 2-1 with two outs in
the bottom of the eighth inning
and Vince Sakowski standing at
second base after a double.
Greg Lorenzetti lined a single
to center field and Sakowski
headed for home, reaching the
plate at about the same time as
Randy Hayes' throw.
The umpire threw up his
thumb, Sakowski threw down
his helmet and the umpire
threw Sakowski out of the
game.
The out ended the inning for
Stanford and the Wildcats
scored once more in the ninth
for good measure.
"I thought I was safe, obvi
ously," Sakowski said. "I just
lost my cool and there is no
excuse for that at such an im
portant time in the game."
Mike Dotterer experienced
the feeling of missing by inches

twice. In both the first and
eighth innings he was hitting
with runners in scoring posi
tion and drilled line shots right
at infielders lack Howell and
Mark Wing for easy outs.
An inch more was all that
center fielder Mark Davis
needed to grab a run-scoring
triple by Wayne Bonheim in
the ninth. The ball, in fact, hit
his glove as he raced back to
ward the wall, but glanced
away.
"I think maybe things are
starting to go our way,"
Wildcat coach )erry Kindall
said. "But you make your own
breaks and the guys really hus
tled today."
Arizona took a 2-0 lead in the
fourth inning on singles by
Kevin Ward and Ed Vosberg, an
RBI double by Howell and an
RBI ground out by Wing. Its
ninth-inning score came when
Wing walked and scored on
Bonham's triple.
Freshman Kevin Kunkel went
the distance for Stanford, giv
ing up all three runs on nine
hits. It was his second consecu
tive hard-luck loss, and it low
ered his record to 6-2.
Cory Sylvester, now 2-1,
pitched four innings of two-hit
relief for the win and Doug
Scherer pitched three and
one-third scoreless innings to
pick up his second save of the
afternoon.
"Doug Scherer was so de
termined," Kindall said. "I
thought if we could get him
into the game with a lead we'd
be in good shape. I didn't take
Cory (Sylvester) out because I
didn't have confidence in him,
I just had so much confidence
in Doug (Scherer)."
Stanford did not get a hit
until the sixth inning when Eric
Hardgrave hit his 17th home
run of the season â€” a long,
towering shot over the wall in
left field. It was the Cardinal's

only run as it finished with six
hits and 10 runners stranded
on base.
In the first game, Arizona
broke open a 2-2 tie in the top
of the eighth when starter
Brian Myers walked Ward and
gave up an infield single to
Vosberg. Reliever Jeff Ballard
then surrendered a two-out,
two-run single by Wing to pro
vide the winning margin.
Myers, now 7-4, picked up
the loss, while Vosberg
pitched seven and one-third
innings of two-run, four-hit
baseball to pick up the win and
improve his record to 8-1.
Scherer shut down Stanford
the rest of the way to pick up
his first save of the day,
Stanford's runs came on a
solo home run by Sakowski in
the sixth and an RBI single by
Lorenzetti that Mark Davis in
the fourth. Arizona's first two
runs came across when
Bonham launched a two-run
homer in the fifth.
The losses dropped Stanford
to 31-13-1 overall and 14-8 con
ference. Stanford's Steve Cot
trell is scheduled to face )oe
Magrane in the series finale to
day.
"Tomorrow is very, very im
portant," Sakowski said yes
terday. "One of the key goals
we set at the beginning of the
season was to sweep (a series
from) someone in the confer
ence and never be swept. We
had two poor hitting perform
ances today. Hopefully we can
come back tomorrow like we
did last weekend and win the
final game."
Last weekend at Arizona
State, the Cardinal staved off a
three-game sweep by the Sun
Devils with a strong hitting per
formance in the final game.
"We have to get some hits
and score some runs," Stan
ford coach Mark Marquess
said. "It's as simple as that."
