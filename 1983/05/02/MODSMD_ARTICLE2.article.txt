# Kohn beats elections charges

### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Senator-elect Jim Kohn fought fire with fire Friday to
keep the ASSU hearing commission from recommend
ing that the senate disqualify him for campaign viola
tions.
"There will not be a recommendation that I should be
disqualified. I looked up the rules in the Campaign Prac
tices Code, and I found rules that they said I violated, but
I also found a rule that they violated by not giving me 24
hours notice of the charges against me before the hear
ing," Kohn said.
Jon Adelstein, an alternate senator-elect who worked
with Kohn to fight thecharges, said, "They weretryingto
get Jim on technicalities, and then Jim went right back
and charged them with violating the rules."
Neither Elections Commissioner Craig Spearman nor
Hearings Commissioner Kurt Zimmerman would com
ment on the Kohn case or the fate of two groups — the
Band and Stanford for Environmental Education — that
were earlier rumored to be facing disqualification
charges.

But Zimmerman did say that regardless of the hearing
commission's decisions, Spearman has the power to
recommend disqualification for Kohn and the two
groups at tomorrow night's senate meeting.
Spearman refused to say if he would exercise that
power, but Zimmerman said, "There's a possibility in a
couple of cases."
Adelstein said Spearman told him he has decided not
to independently recommend that the senate disqualify
Kohn.
"First Craig told me that even though . . . the hearing
commission procedures were done improperly, he
would press charges. I said, 'Craig, don't be ridiculous.'
Then later he told me that he decided he wasn't going to
do that because it would just be spiteful," Adelstein
said.
"Craig had told me before that he thought Jim would
be a lousy senator because he (messed) up and did this
and that. But now Craig respects him because he's using
the rules and playing this bureaucratic game," he added.
