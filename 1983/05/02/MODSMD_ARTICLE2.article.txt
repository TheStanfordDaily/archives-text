# Kohn beats elections charges

### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Senator-elect Jim Kohn fought fire with fire Friday to
keep the ASSU hearing commission from recommend
ing that the senate disqualify him for campaign viola
tions.
"There will not be a recommendation that I should be
disqualified. I looked up the rules in the Campaign Prac
tices Code, and I found rules that they said I violated, but
I also found a rule that they violated by not giving me 24
hours notice of the charges against me before the hear
ing," Kohn said.
Jon Adelstein, an alternate senator-elect who worked
with Kohn to fight thecharges, said, "They weretryingto
get Jim on technicalities, and then Jim went right back
and charged them with violating the rules."
Neither Elections Commissioner Craig Spearman nor
Hearings Commissioner Kurt Zimmerman would com
ment on the Kohn case or the fate of two groups — the
Band and Stanford for Environmental Education — that
were earlier rumored to be facing disqualification
charges.

But Zimmerman did say that regardless of the hearing
commission's decisions, Spearman has the power to
recommend disqualification for Kohn and the two
groups at tomorrow night's senate meeting.
Spearman refused to say if he would exercise that
power, but Zimmerman said, "There's a possibility in a
couple of cases."
Adelstein said Spearman told him he has decided not
to independently recommend that the senate disqualify
Kohn.
"First Craig told me that even though . . . the hearing
commission procedures were done improperly, he
would press charges. I said, 'Craig, don't be ridiculous.'
Then later he told me that he decided he wasn't going to
do that because it would just be spiteful," Adelstein
said.
"Craig had told me before that he thought Jim would
be a lousy senator because he (messed) up and did this
and that. But now Craig respects him because he's using
the rules and playing this bureaucratic game," he added.
The commission had originally
charged Kohn with two violations:
that he put up posters before the
legal starting time and illegally cam
paigned at the Post Office. A third
charge, that he talked about the case
publicly, was added later. However,
Kohn said he is confident he could
defend himself against any of the
charges should Spearman decide to
recommend his disqualification.
"First they charged me with cam
paigning on private property, and
the examples in the Campaign Prac
tices Code of private property are
mopeds, bicycles and golf carts. You
don't think of the Post Office as pri
vate property and you wouldn't think
of the Post Office as the next thing to
follow in their list of items. And as far

as their charge of campaigning early,
it was Craig Spearman who made a
mistake in telling us the wrong time,
and he just refused to admit it," Kohn
said.
Adelstein said the final charge, that
Kohn had illegally made public in
formation about the case by talking
with a Daily reporter, could not le
gally be brought before the commis
sion because Kohn was not given the
required 24-hour notice.
Kohn filed a motion that the
charges against him be dropped be
cause the hearing commission had
not given him proper notice of the
charges before the hearing. "Zim
merman told me right away that I was
right, but that he would re-file dupli
cate charges immediately. But I told
him about another rule that said he
couldn't recharge me unless the
charges were new. Then he said they
would throw them out," Kohn said.
