# Host Card 2nd in WCAA golf
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Host Stanford would have
liked to put its home-course
advantage to use one more
time at the West Coast Athletic
Association Women's Golf
Championships at Stanford
Golf Course.
But rain Saturday cancelled
any hopes of doing so and, in
fact, cancelled the remainder
of the tournament.
What was scheduled to be a
three-round, three-day tour
nament turned into a two
round, one-day event thanks
to the generosity of the rain
gods.

Consequently, the scores
after 36 holes became final and
Stanford finished second to
UCLA by an agonizing 10
strokes, a margin that could be
made over the final 18 holes.
I he Bruins fired a two-round
team total of 611, while the
Cardinal shot a 621. Arizona
was third with 634, Arizona
State fourth with 636 and Long
Beach State fifth with 646.
Although Thursday's open
ing round was rained out, golf
ers were able to play 36 holes
Friday amid scattered showers
and windy conditions

Stanford senior Joanne
Pacilio, however, might not
have minded the final-round
rainout as much as the rest of
the Stanford golfers. Pacilio's
36-hole total of 148 (76-72) was
tops after two rounds and thus
gave her medalist honors.
UCLA's Cindy Scholefield
was second individually at 149
while teammate Nancy Moc
kett was third at 153.
For Stanford, freshman
Kathy Kostas finished tied for
seventh individually at 156 with
Long Beach State's Sherry An
donian.
