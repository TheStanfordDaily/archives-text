# Says NSC should control foreign policy
## Brzezinski calls for changes 
### RANDY BROBERG Staff writer 
San Francisco â€” In a predictable
but well-received speech, former
National Security Adviser Zbigniew
Brzezinski called Friday for impor
tant structural changes in America's
foreign policy-making processes.
Brzezinski argued for the leadership
of the National Security Council over
the State Department in the deter
mination of foreign policy.
In the course of his speech before
approximately 1000 community
leaders and businessmen gathered at
the Commonwealth Club of Califor
nia in San Francisco, Brzezinski
criticized President Reagan's foreign
policy toward several world regions
including China, Europe, the Middle
East and Central America. But he
supported the president's aid plan to
the government of El Salvador, say
ing, "what he proposes tangibly is
'correct and deserving of our sup
port."
The adviser to former President
Jimmy Carter added, however,
i"( Reagan's) analysis of the problem
tends to understress the indigenous
revolutionary aspects of the prob
lem." argued that the situation in
F.I Salvador is a "fusing of two
dangerous trends: Soviet-Cuban
exploitation of indigenous, re
volutionary upheaval." It is equally
wrong to reduce the situation purely
to the domestic, revolutionary as
pect and to see in the problem only
the "Soviet-Cuban hand," Brzezinski
said.

Although Brzezinski criticized the
Reagan administration's approach to
foreign policy by calling it "passive"
and "reactive," he said there were
certain "indemic" problems in the
American foreign policy machinery.
These "persisting" problems, ac
cording to Brzezinski, relate to coor
dination and leadership of foreign
policy and to the lack of "national
consensus" on foreign policy.
Brzezinski claimed, "Our foreign
policy has become very partisan . . .
we have not had a national foreign
policy. We have had a series of presi
dential foreign policies."
Brzezinski outlined his ideas for a
centralization or "integration" of
U.S. foreign policy. "We can no
longer treat foreign policy as if it was
three disparate domains: State De
partment and diplomacy (the De
partment of Defense) and national
security, and CIA and national intel
ligence.
"Integration is needed; it can only
come from one place: the White
House and from the office of the na
tional security adviser," he said.
Brzezinski continued by charging,
"The fact of the matter is the secre
tary of state cannot integrate the De
fense Department or the CIA. It can
only be done on behalf of the presi
dent, and it needs to be done legiti
mately, and therefore with formal
approval, preferably with the na
tional security adviser approved,
when nominated, by the Senate."
During Carter's years in office,
Brzezinski was well-known as a

highly visible and controversial na
tional security adviser and for his
outspoken, "hardline" views on rela
tions with the Soviet Union. He was
criticized for his frequent struggles
with then-Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance over control of U.S. foreign
policy.
During a question-and-answer
period after the speech, Brzezinski
was greeted with laughter numerous
times, particularly when he said that
the State Department is not innova
tive because "it resists orders from
the National Security Council."
The Polish-born professor of gov
ernment at Columbia University
never directly addressed relations
with the Soviet Union, but he re
peatedly mentioned the importance
of countering the influence of the
Soviets around the world. In re
sponse to a question about detente,
however, Brzezinski said, "The only
kind of detente which is tolerable is
one which is reciprocal, which
means we must be very vigilant about
Soviet misconduct."
Arms control cannot be separated
from other aspects of Soviet-
American relations," he said. "Link
age is not a theory, it is a fact." The
United States cannot have an arms
control agreement while the Soviets
have a "hunting license" to expand
in other areas, he added.
The speech was part of a tour de
signed to promote his memoirs of
the years he spent in the White
House. Two Stanford scholars were
seated with Brzezinski at the

speaker's table: History Prof. Alex
ander Dallin, chairman of the Inter
national Relations Program, and
Richard Staar, associate director of
the Hoover Institution.
Dallin, who said he hired
Brzezinski while he was at Columbia
University, said after the luncheon
that Brzezinski's speech tested other
aspects of foreign policy in terms of
Soviet-American relations. "He omit
ted a direct treatment of Soviet-
American relations; he took them for
granted," he said.
At the same time Dallin pointed
out that he perceives a difference be
tween Brzezinski's knowledge of the
world and that of William Clark, the
current national security adviser.
Brzezinksi commented on Clark
during the question and answer ses
sion by giving him a grade of "in
complete."
