Shultz fired upon
Beirut — Secretary of State George Shultz shrugged
off an early-morning episode yesterday in which two
Chinese-made rockets passed breathtakingly close to
the official residence where he was spending the
night and exploded nearby.
The rockets appeared to have been fired at the resi
dence of U.S. Ambassador Robert Dillon, where
Shultz was staying, said Ist Lt. Alan Burghard, an ex
plosives expert with the U.S. Marines contingent of
the multinational peace-keeping force, but it was im
possible to tell for certain that the embassy residence
was the target.
There were artillery exchanges Saturday night and
yesterday morning between Christian and Druze

militiamen, and most of this fighting occurred in the
hills just outside East Beirut, near where the am
bassador's residence is located.
Shultz resumed, as if nothing had happened, his
talks with Lebanese and Israeli officials, seeking to
speed up conclusion of an agreement for the with
drawal of foreign troops from Lebanon.
Talking to reporters accompanying his mission,
Shultz curtly dismissed any suggestion that his sched
ule or travels would be altered in any way by the
episode.
"I'm not intimidated, whatever they're trying to
do," Shultz said. "I wouldn't play it up excessively."
Burghard, 24, said that the two rockets, sounding
like a freight train, passed low over Dillon's residence,
landing ab(!»ut 100 yards beyond the official com

pound. One of them exploded there and the other
skipped for another 200 yards before exploding and
breaking windows in a nearby house. There were no
injuries.
Burghard identified them as Chinese-made
Kaytusha rockets, a common weapon in Lebanon.
"The men (Marine guards) who were at the resi
dence say they barely cleared the top of the resi
dence," Burghard said. "They must have been on
their downward slope. I believe they would have
done substantial structural and personal damage (if
they had hit the residence). They would have inflicted
a lot of injuries and destroyed a good section of the
ambassador's house."
Burghard said that he and his men conducted an
analysis of the blast craters caused by the shells and

that this confirmed a trajectory passing directly over
the residence. He added that the Chinese origin of
the rockets was determined from the remains of a
rocket motor, which was recovered.
