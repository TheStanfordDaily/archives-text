Shultz fired upon
Beirut — Secretary of State George Shultz shrugged
off an early-morning episode yesterday in which two
Chinese-made rockets passed breathtakingly close to
the official residence where he was spending the
night and exploded nearby.
The rockets appeared to have been fired at the resi
dence of U.S. Ambassador Robert Dillon, where
Shultz was staying, said Ist Lt. Alan Burghard, an ex
plosives expert with the U.S. Marines contingent of
the multinational peace-keeping force, but it was im
possible to tell for certain that the embassy residence
was the target.
There were artillery exchanges Saturday night and
yesterday morning between Christian and Druze

militiamen, and most of this fighting occurred in the
hills just outside East Beirut, near where the am
bassador's residence is located.
Shultz resumed, as if nothing had happened, his
talks with Lebanese and Israeli officials, seeking to
speed up conclusion of an agreement for the with
drawal of foreign troops from Lebanon.
Talking to reporters accompanying his mission,
Shultz curtly dismissed any suggestion that his sched
ule or travels would be altered in any way by the
episode.
"I'm not intimidated, whatever they're trying to
do," Shultz said. "I wouldn't play it up excessively."
Burghard, 24, said that the two rockets, sounding
like a freight train, passed low over Dillon's residence,
landing ab(!»ut 100 yards beyond the official com

pound. One of them exploded there and the other
skipped for another 200 yards before exploding and
breaking windows in a nearby house. There were no
injuries.
Burghard identified them as Chinese-made
Kaytusha rockets, a common weapon in Lebanon.
"The men (Marine guards) who were at the resi
dence say they barely cleared the top of the resi
dence," Burghard said. "They must have been on
their downward slope. I believe they would have
done substantial structural and personal damage (if
they had hit the residence). They would have inflicted
a lot of injuries and destroyed a good section of the
ambassador's house."
Burghard said that he and his men conducted an
analysis of the blast craters caused by the shells and

that this confirmed a trajectory passing directly over
the residence. He added that the Chinese origin of
the rockets was determined from the remains of a
rocket motor, which was recovered.
Capitol airliner hijacked to Cuba
Miami — A Miami-bound airliner carrying 214 peo
ple was hijacked to Cuba last night by a man who
claimed to be carrying explosives.
FBI spokesman Steve Torres said Capitol Air Flight
236, from San Juan, Puerto Rico, landed in Havana at
5:27 p.m. "and is now in the hands of the Cuban au
thorities."
Capitol Air spokesman Rusty Silverio said the DC-8
was carrying 204 passengers and 10 crewmen.
The flight was diverted when it was 70 miles
northwest of Grand Turk Island, said Roger Myers, as
sistant public affairs officer for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Atlanta.
He said the pilot notified traffic controllers of the
hijacking shortly after the 2:55 p.m. takeoff.
Torres said the hijacker had a weapon but he didn't
know what kind. The man also claimed to have "some
type of explosive, some type of bomb."
Torres said U.S. officials knew nothing about the hi
jacker's identity.
Myers said that once the Cuban government clears
the plane to leave the island, Cuban air traffic con
trollers would advise Miami controllers of an arrival
time.
"The aircraft's on the ground in Havana, and we're
awaiting at this time word of when it will depart," he
said. "It can stay overnight, it can stay an hour, it can
stay two nights, we have no idea."
Police break up Polish rallies
Warsaw, Poland — Police used water cannon„jear
gas and baton charges in at least four Polish cities yes
terday to break up the first major pro-Solidarity dem
onstrations here in six months and the largest such
manifestations since last August.
While Polish television dismissed the incidents as
"marginal," it reported late yesterday that there were
unauthorized demonstrations in a total of 20 Polish
towns, including the most serious in Warsaw, Gdansk,
Wroclaw and Nowa Huta.
The rallies were called by underground leaders of
the banned Solidarity independent trade union
movement to counter official May Day rallies or
ganized by the Communist authorities throughout
the country.
Polish television claimed a total of about 40,000 per
sons participated nationwide in the unauthorized
rallies compared with 6.5 million in official ob
servances and said the large turnout for the official
observances was a national vote against the under
ground opposition.
Western estimates, however, put the total of Soli
darity sympathizers much higher. And in the Baltic
seaport of Gdansk, union leader Lech Walesa, who
had tacityly endorsed the call for the demonstrations
by underground leaders, said the rallies "surpassed all
our expectations."
Western correspondents on hand yesterday said up
to 40,000 Solidarity supporters joined the protest in
Gdansk alone.
The crowds were clearly smaller than during similar
illegal May Day demonstrations a year ago, but their
numbers were nonetheless surprising given the mass
of police firepower arrayed against them. Last year's

unauthorized demonstrations were allowed to pro
ceed with virtually no interference.
"The authorities demonstrated all their power, and
in doing so they demonstrated their full impotence,"
Walesa said in a telephone interview from his Gdansk
home. The union leader's apartment building was
surrounded much of the day by police, who fought
off several attempts by sympathizers to reach him.
"You've witnessed a historic event," a Polish jour
nalist said as he watched helmeted riot police con
front a chanting, flag-waving crowd near one of the
many churches in Warsaw's restored Old Town. "For
the first time ever in a Communist country, a May Day
parade was attacked by police."
May 1 is celebrated throughout much of the world
as labor day, and it is socialism's highest holiday. It ori
ginated as a commemoration of police attacks against
striking workers in Chicago's Haymarket Square in
1886.
Reagan warns on build-up
Washington — The Reagan administration said yes
terday that the Soviet build-up in Syria was unwise
and could lead to a confrontation between the super
powers in the Mideast.
Undersecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said
on CBS-TV's Face the Nation that it was still not clear
what the Soviets were trying to do with the great in
crease in military aid to Syria, but "it could create a
real danger of escalation."
Eagleburger's statement was significant because it
came as Secretary of State George Shultz is in the Mid
east trying to negotiate a pullout of all foreign forces
in Lebanon. In the last week, Shultz has concentrated
his efforts on an agreement between Israel and Leba
non, but he said over the weekend that he was ready
to travel to Damascus.
The Syrians have 30,000 troops in Lebanon, and Is
rael has made it clear it will not withdraw its forces un
til the Syrians agree to withdraw as well. But with the
increase in Soviet aid and personnel in Syria in the last
three months, it is far from certain that Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad will be willing to go along with an
U.S. diplomatic effort unless the Soviets are brought
in first.
The Soviets now have approximately 5000 military
advisers in Syria, according to Western intelligence
sources, and they have replaced the surface to air mis
siles Syria lost in the war with Israel last year with an
even more advanced version. In fact, the new
SAM-ss, with a range of 150 miles, could threaten the
Israeli early warning Hawkeye aircraft.
"You have to ask if the Soviets intend to have a ma
jor increase in the presence in the Mideast," said
Eagleburger. "Is this an effort to block a peace settle
ment in the Mideast?"
"It is a very, very unwise step, especially if there may
be something more devious here," he said.

At the very least, administration Mideast experts
say, the Soviets have reintroduced themselves as a sig
nificant factor in the Mideast by the arms build-up in
Syria. The build-up started after the Lebanese war,
they say, but reached massive proportions only after
the death of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and rise to
power of Yuri Andropov. At least some Mideast ex
perts say that Andropov is trying to deal his nation
into the Mideast diplomatic picture again.
"They have always been a factor in the Mideast. But
the point has been that they can bring no one to the
Mideast peace table. If they become a greater factor it
is likely to be as a negative factor," said Eagleburger.
But beyond the immediate prospect of the Soviets
trying to block a Lebanese troop pullout is the spectre
of a superpower military confrontation in the Mid
east. The Soviets have brought in hundreds of advisers
to operate the SAM-5s and, if Israel should decide to
try to destroy those missiles, as they did last year, it
would lead to a very tense military situation.
AIDS linked to cancer virus
Washington — Researchers at three laboratories
have found evidence of a human cancer-causing virus
in patients suffering from the mysterious deadly dis
ease called AIDS, according to medical sources.
Signs of a rare type of human T-cell leukemia virus,
the first animal virus strongly associated with a specif
ic cancer in man, were found in blood samples tested
by teams headed by Dr. Robert Gallo at the National
Cancer Institute and Dr. Max Essex at the Harvard
University School of Public Health. Additional work
has also been done by French scientists, the sources
said.
Their findings are likely to provide a new focus in
the search for the cause of AIDS, or Acquired Im
mune Deficiency Syndrome. The epidemic disease
has struck about 1350 victims and killed more than 500
in this country, including homosexuals, drug addicts,
Haitians, hemophiliacs, children and others who have
received blood transfusions.
The new work is scheduled to be published in five
papers in a May issue of Science magazine. The re
searchers involved have declined to discuss any de
tails in advance.
In response to a reporter's inquiries, Gallo and Es
sex emphasized that it is too early to call the cancer
virus the cause of AIDS. Gallo commented, "This is
the beginning of something we hope opens up a new
avenue of research. But the answers are not all in."
Dr. Harold Jaffe, Centers for Disease Control of
ficial involved in tracking AIDS, said the cancer virus
"seems to be a promising lead. At least it's a lead. But
we are awaiting the release of those papers."
Several researchers cautioned that although the
cancer virus will become a leading candidate for the
cause of AIDS, it will be difficult to tell whether the
link is causal or occurred after AIDS victims became

sick. AIDS wipes out the victims' protective immune
system, making them vulnerable to life-threatening
infections as well as cancer.
The Washington Post reported last month that
Gallo had found signs of the virus in some AIDS vic
tims. Sources said recently that of dozens of samples
studied by the two U.S. groups, using different tech
niques, less than half provided antibodies or other ev
idence of the difficult-to-find virus.
Bush gets Reagan nod
Houston — President Reagan said Saturday that if
he runs for re-election next year he will ask Vice Presi
dent George Bush to be his running mate.
"You don't break up a combination that's work
ing," the president said.
There never has been any serious doubt that Rea
gan would ask Bush to continue serving as vice presi
dent. But Saturday was the first time that Reagan pub
licly committed himself to keeping Bush on the Re
publican ticket should he be renominated.
It also was another signal that Reagan will seek a
second term, although the 72-year-old president in
sists, as do his top aides, that he has not yet decided
whetherto run.
Beyond that, Reagan's comments represented a
strong vote of confidence in Bush, who is suspected
by the president's hard-core conservative constituen
cy of being too moderate philosophically and of put
ting pragmatism over idealism.
If Reagan decides not to run — a situation his
closest aides do not expect — Bush could use Rea
gan's words as an unofficial endorsement of his own
presidential bid.
Reagan's announcement was made first in an in
terview published Saturday in the Houston Post.
Houston is Bush's hometown.

surrounded much of the day by police, who fought
off several attempts by sympathizers to reach him.
"You've witnessed a historic event," a Polish jour
nalist said as he watched helmeted riot police con
front a chanting, flag-waving crowd near one of the
many churches in Warsaw's restored Old Town. "For
the first time ever in a Communist country, a May Day
parade was attacked by police."
May 1 is celebrated throughout much of the world
as labor day, and it is socialism's highest holiday. It ori
ginated as a commemoration of police attacks against
striking workers in Chicago's Haymarket Square in
1886.
Reagan warns on build-up
Washington — The Reagan administration said yes
terday that the Soviet build-up in Syria was unwise
and could lead to a confrontation between the super
powers in the Mideast.
Undersecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said
on CBS-TV's Face the Nation that it was still not clear
what the Soviets were trying to do with the great in
crease in military aid to Syria, but "it could create a
real danger of escalation."
Eagleburger's statement was significant because it
came as Secretary of State George Shultz is in the Mid
east trying to negotiate a pullout of all foreign forces
in Lebanon. In the last week, Shultz has concentrated
his efforts on an agreement between Israel and Leba
non, but he said over the weekend that he was ready
to travel to Damascus.
The Syrians have 30,000 troops in Lebanon, and Is
rael has made it clear it will not withdraw its forces un
til the Syrians agree to withdraw as well. But with the
increase in Soviet aid and personnel in Syria in the last
three months, it is far from certain that Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad will be willing to go along with an
U.S. diplomatic effort unless the Soviets are brought
in first.
The Soviets now have approximately 5000 military
advisers in Syria, according to Western intelligence
sources, and they have replaced the surface to air mis
siles Syria lost in the war with Israel last year with an
even more advanced version. In fact, the new
SAM-ss, with a range of 150 miles, could threaten the
Israeli early warning Hawkeye aircraft.
"You have to ask if the Soviets intend to have a ma
jor increase in the presence in the Mideast," said
Eagleburger. "Is this an effort to block a peace settle
ment in the Mideast?"
"It is a very, very unwise step, especially if there may
be something more devious here," he said.

At the very least, administration Mideast experts
say, the Soviets have reintroduced themselves as a sig
nificant factor in the Mideast by the arms build-up in
Syria. The build-up started after the Lebanese war,
they say, but reached massive proportions only after
the death of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and rise to
power of Yuri Andropov. At least some Mideast ex
perts say that Andropov is trying to deal his nation
into the Mideast diplomatic picture again.
"They have always been a factor in the Mideast. But
the point has been that they can bring no one to the
Mideast peace table. If they become a greater factor it
is likely to be as a negative factor," said Eagleburger.
But beyond the immediate prospect of the Soviets
trying to block a Lebanese troop pullout is the spectre
of a superpower military confrontation in the Mid
east. The Soviets have brought in hundreds of advisers
to operate the SAM-5s and, if Israel should decide to
try to destroy those missiles, as they did last year, it
would lead to a very tense military situation.
AIDS linked to cancer virus
Washington — Researchers at three laboratories
have found evidence of a human cancer-causing virus
in patients suffering from the mysterious deadly dis
ease called AIDS, according to medical sources.
Signs of a rare type of human T-cell leukemia virus,
the first animal virus strongly associated with a specif
ic cancer in man, were found in blood samples tested
by teams headed by Dr. Robert Gallo at the National
Cancer Institute and Dr. Max Essex at the Harvard
University School of Public Health. Additional work
has also been done by French scientists, the sources
said.
Their findings are likely to provide a new focus in
the search for the cause of AIDS, or Acquired Im
mune Deficiency Syndrome. The epidemic disease
has struck about 1350 victims and killed more than 500
in this country, including homosexuals, drug addicts,
Haitians, hemophiliacs, children and others who have
received blood transfusions.
The new work is scheduled to be published in five
papers in a May issue of Science magazine. The re
searchers involved have declined to discuss any de
tails in advance.
In response to a reporter's inquiries, Gallo and Es
sex emphasized that it is too early to call the cancer
virus the cause of AIDS. Gallo commented, "This is
the beginning of something we hope opens up a new
avenue of research. But the answers are not all in."
Dr. Harold Jaffe, Centers for Disease Control of
ficial involved in tracking AIDS, said the cancer virus
"seems to be a promising lead. At least it's a lead. But
we are awaiting the release of those papers."
Several researchers cautioned that although the
cancer virus will become a leading candidate for the
cause of AIDS, it will be difficult to tell whether the
link is causal or occurred after AIDS victims became

sick. AIDS wipes out the victims' protective immune
system, making them vulnerable to life-threatening
infections as well as cancer.
The Washington Post reported last month that
Gallo had found signs of the virus in some AIDS vic
tims. Sources said recently that of dozens of samples
studied by the two U.S. groups, using different tech
niques, less than half provided antibodies or other ev
idence of the difficult-to-find virus.
Bush gets Reagan nod
Houston — President Reagan said Saturday that if
he runs for re-election next year he will ask Vice Presi
dent George Bush to be his running mate.
"You don't break up a combination that's work
ing," the president said.
There never has been any serious doubt that Rea
gan would ask Bush to continue serving as vice presi
dent. But Saturday was the first time that Reagan pub
licly committed himself to keeping Bush on the Re
publican ticket should he be renominated.
It also was another signal that Reagan will seek a
second term, although the 72-year-old president in
sists, as do his top aides, that he has not yet decided
whetherto run.
Beyond that, Reagan's comments represented a
strong vote of confidence in Bush, who is suspected
by the president's hard-core conservative constituen
cy of being too moderate philosophically and of put
ting pragmatism over idealism.
If Reagan decides not to run — a situation his
closest aides do not expect — Bush could use Rea
gan's words as an unofficial endorsement of his own
presidential bid.
Reagan's announcement was made first in an in
terview published Saturday in the Houston Post.
Houston is Bush's hometown.

Shultz fired upon
Beirut — Secretary of State George Shultz shrugged
off an early-morning episode yesterday in which two
Chinese-made rockets passed breathtakingly close to
the official residence where he was spending the
night and exploded nearby.
The rockets appeared to have been fired at the resi
dence of U.S. Ambassador Robert Dillon, where
Shultz was staying, said Ist Lt. Alan Burghard, an ex
plosives expert with the U.S. Marines contingent of
the multinational peace-keeping force, but it was im
possible to tell for certain that the embassy residence
was the target.
There were artillery exchanges Saturday night and
yesterday morning between Christian and Druze

militiamen, and most of this fighting occurred in the
hills just outside East Beirut, near where the am
bassador's residence is located.
Shultz resumed, as if nothing had happened, his
talks with Lebanese and Israeli officials, seeking to
speed up conclusion of an agreement for the with
drawal of foreign troops from Lebanon.
Talking to reporters accompanying his mission,
Shultz curtly dismissed any suggestion that his sched
ule or travels would be altered in any way by the
episode.
"I'm not intimidated, whatever they're trying to
do," Shultz said. "I wouldn't play it up excessively."
Burghard, 24, said that the two rockets, sounding
like a freight train, passed low over Dillon's residence,
landing ab(!»ut 100 yards beyond the official com

pound. One of them exploded there and the other
skipped for another 200 yards before exploding and
breaking windows in a nearby house. There were no
injuries.
Burghard identified them as Chinese-made
Kaytusha rockets, a common weapon in Lebanon.
"The men (Marine guards) who were at the resi
dence say they barely cleared the top of the resi
dence," Burghard said. "They must have been on
their downward slope. I believe they would have
done substantial structural and personal damage (if
they had hit the residence). They would have inflicted
a lot of injuries and destroyed a good section of the
ambassador's house."
Burghard said that he and his men conducted an
analysis of the blast craters caused by the shells and

that this confirmed a trajectory passing directly over
the residence. He added that the Chinese origin of
the rockets was determined from the remains of a
rocket motor, which was recovered.
Capitol airliner hijacked to Cuba
Miami — A Miami-bound airliner carrying 214 peo
ple was hijacked to Cuba last night by a man who
claimed to be carrying explosives.
FBI spokesman Steve Torres said Capitol Air Flight
236, from San Juan, Puerto Rico, landed in Havana at
5:27 p.m. "and is now in the hands of the Cuban au
thorities."
Capitol Air spokesman Rusty Silverio said the DC-8
was carrying 204 passengers and 10 crewmen.
The flight was diverted when it was 70 miles
northwest of Grand Turk Island, said Roger Myers, as
sistant public affairs officer for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Atlanta.
He said the pilot notified traffic controllers of the
hijacking shortly after the 2:55 p.m. takeoff.
Torres said the hijacker had a weapon but he didn't
know what kind. The man also claimed to have "some
type of explosive, some type of bomb."
Torres said U.S. officials knew nothing about the hi
jacker's identity.
Myers said that once the Cuban government clears
the plane to leave the island, Cuban air traffic con
trollers would advise Miami controllers of an arrival
time.
"The aircraft's on the ground in Havana, and we're
awaiting at this time word of when it will depart," he
said. "It can stay overnight, it can stay an hour, it can
stay two nights, we have no idea."
Police break up Polish rallies
Warsaw, Poland — Police used water cannon„jear
gas and baton charges in at least four Polish cities yes
terday to break up the first major pro-Solidarity dem
onstrations here in six months and the largest such
manifestations since last August.
While Polish television dismissed the incidents as
"marginal," it reported late yesterday that there were
unauthorized demonstrations in a total of 20 Polish
towns, including the most serious in Warsaw, Gdansk,
Wroclaw and Nowa Huta.
The rallies were called by underground leaders of
the banned Solidarity independent trade union
movement to counter official May Day rallies or
ganized by the Communist authorities throughout
the country.
Polish television claimed a total of about 40,000 per
sons participated nationwide in the unauthorized
rallies compared with 6.5 million in official ob
servances and said the large turnout for the official
observances was a national vote against the under
ground opposition.
Western estimates, however, put the total of Soli
darity sympathizers much higher. And in the Baltic
seaport of Gdansk, union leader Lech Walesa, who
had tacityly endorsed the call for the demonstrations
by underground leaders, said the rallies "surpassed all
our expectations."
Western correspondents on hand yesterday said up
to 40,000 Solidarity supporters joined the protest in
Gdansk alone.
The crowds were clearly smaller than during similar
illegal May Day demonstrations a year ago, but their
numbers were nonetheless surprising given the mass
of police firepower arrayed against them. Last year's

unauthorized demonstrations were allowed to pro
ceed with virtually no interference.
"The authorities demonstrated all their power, and
in doing so they demonstrated their full impotence,"
Walesa said in a telephone interview from his Gdansk
home. The union leader's apartment building was
surrounded much of the day by police, who fought
off several attempts by sympathizers to reach him.
"You've witnessed a historic event," a Polish jour

Bush gets Reagan nod
Houston — President Reagan said Saturday that if
he runs for re-election next year he will ask Vice Presi
dent George Bush to be his running mate.
"You don't break up a combination that's work
ing," the president said.
There never has been any serious doubt that Rea
gan would ask Bush to continue serving as vice presi
dent. But Saturday was the first time that Reagan pub
licly committed himself to keeping Bush on the Re
publican ticket should he be renominated.
It also was another signal that Reagan will seek a
second term, although the 72-year-old president in
sists, as do his top aides, that he has not yet decided
whetherto run.
Beyond that, Reagan's comments represented a
strong vote of confidence in Bush, who is suspected
by the president's hard-core conservative constituen
cy of being too moderate philosophically and of put
ting pragmatism over idealism.
If Reagan decides not to run — a situation his
closest aides do not expect — Bush could use Rea
gan's words as an unofficial endorsement of his own
presidential bid.
Reagan's announcement was made first in an in
terview published Saturday in the Houston Post.
Houston is Bush's hometown.

Shultz fired upon
Beirut — Secretary of State George Shultz shrugged
off an early-morning episode yesterday in which two
Chinese-made rockets passed breathtakingly close to
the official residence where he was spending the
night and exploded nearby.
The rockets appeared to have been fired at the resi
dence of U.S. Ambassador Robert Dillon, where
Shultz was staying, said Ist Lt. Alan Burghard, an ex
plosives expert with the U.S. Marines contingent of
the multinational peace-keeping force, but it was im
possible to tell for certain that the embassy residence
was the target.
There were artillery exchanges Saturday night and
yesterday morning between Christian and Druze

militiamen, and most of this fighting occurred in the
hills just outside East Beirut, near where the am
bassador's residence is located.
Shultz resumed, as if nothing had happened, his
talks with Lebanese and Israeli officials, seeking to
speed up conclusion of an agreement for the with
drawal of foreign troops from Lebanon.
Talking to reporters accompanying his mission,
Shultz curtly dismissed any suggestion that his sched
ule or travels would be altered in any way by the
episode.
"I'm not intimidated, whatever they're trying to
do," Shultz said. "I wouldn't play it up excessively."
Burghard, 24, said that the two rockets, sounding
like a freight train, passed low over Dillon's residence,
landing ab(!»ut 100 yards beyond the official com

pound. One of them exploded there and the other
skipped for another 200 yards before exploding and
breaking windows in a nearby house. There were no
injuries.
Burghard identified them as Chinese-made
Kaytusha rockets, a common weapon in Lebanon.
"The men (Marine guards) who were at the resi
dence say they barely cleared the top of the resi
dence," Burghard said. "They must have been on
their downward slope. I believe they would have
done substantial structural and personal damage (if
they had hit the residence). They would have inflicted
a lot of injuries and destroyed a good section of the
ambassador's house."
Burghard said that he and his men conducted an
analysis of the blast craters caused by the shells and

that this confirmed a trajectory passing directly over
the residence. He added that the Chinese origin of
the rockets was determined from the remains of a
rocket motor, which was recovered.
Capitol airliner hijacked to Cuba
Miami — A Miami-bound airliner carrying 214 peo
ple was hijacked to Cuba last night by a man who
claimed to be carrying explosives.
FBI spokesman Steve Torres said Capitol Air Flight
236, from San Juan, Puerto Rico, landed in Havana at
5:27 p.m. "and is now in the hands of the Cuban au
thorities."
Capitol Air spokesman Rusty Silverio said the DC-8
was carrying 204 passengers and 10 crewmen.
The flight was diverted when it was 70 miles
northwest of Grand Turk Island, said Roger Myers, as
sistant public affairs officer for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Atlanta.
He said the pilot notified traffic controllers of the
hijacking shortly after the 2:55 p.m. takeoff.
Torres said the hijacker had a weapon but he didn't
know what kind. The man also claimed to have "some
type of explosive, some type of bomb."
Torres said U.S. officials knew nothing about the hi
jacker's identity.
Myers said that once the Cuban government clears
the plane to leave the island, Cuban air traffic con
trollers would advise Miami controllers of an arrival
time.
"The aircraft's on the ground in Havana, and we're
awaiting at this time word of when it will depart," he
said. "It can stay overnight, it can stay an hour, it can
stay two nights, we have no idea."
Police break up Polish rallies
Warsaw, Poland — Police used water cannon„jear
gas and baton charges in at least four Polish cities yes
terday to break up the first major pro-Solidarity dem
onstrations here in six months and the largest such
manifestations since last August.
While Polish television dismissed the incidents as
"marginal," it reported late yesterday that there were
unauthorized demonstrations in a total of 20 Polish
towns, including the most serious in Warsaw, Gdansk,
Wroclaw and Nowa Huta.
The rallies were called by underground leaders of
the banned Solidarity independent trade union
movement to counter official May Day rallies or
ganized by the Communist authorities throughout
the country.
Polish television claimed a total of about 40,000 per
sons participated nationwide in the unauthorized
rallies compared with 6.5 million in official ob
servances and said the large turnout for the official
observances was a national vote against the under
ground opposition.
Western estimates, however, put the total of Soli
darity sympathizers much higher. And in the Baltic
seaport of Gdansk, union leader Lech Walesa, who
had tacityly endorsed the call for the demonstrations
by underground leaders, said the rallies "surpassed all
our expectations."
Western correspondents on hand yesterday said up
to 40,000 Solidarity supporters joined the protest in
Gdansk alone.
The crowds were clearly smaller than during similar
illegal May Day demonstrations a year ago, but their
numbers were nonetheless surprising given the mass
of police firepower arrayed against them. Last year's

unauthorized demonstrations were allowed to pro
ceed with virtually no interference.
"The authorities demonstrated all their power, and
in doing so they demonstrated their full impotence,"
Walesa said in a telephone interview from his Gdansk
home. The union leader's apartment building was
surrounded much of the day by police, who fought
off several attempts by sympathizers to reach him.
"You've witnessed a historic event," a Polish jour
nalist said as he watched helmeted riot police con
front a chanting, flag-waving crowd near one of the
many churches in Warsaw's restored Old Town. "For
the first time ever in a Communist country, a May Day
parade was attacked by police."
May 1 is celebrated throughout much of the world
as labor day, and it is socialism's highest holiday. It ori
ginated as a commemoration of police attacks against
striking workers in Chicago's Haymarket Square in
1886.
Reagan warns on build-up
Washington — The Reagan administration said yes
terday that the Soviet build-up in Syria was unwise
and could lead to a confrontation between the super
powers in the Mideast.
Undersecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said
on CBS-TV's Face the Nation that it was still not clear
what the Soviets were trying to do with the great in
crease in military aid to Syria, but "it could create a
real danger of escalation."
Eagleburger's statement was significant because it
came as Secretary of State George Shultz is in the Mid
east trying to negotiate a pullout of all foreign forces
in Lebanon. In the last week, Shultz has concentrated
his efforts on an agreement between Israel and Leba
non, but he said over the weekend that he was ready
to travel to Damascus.
The Syrians have 30,000 troops in Lebanon, and Is
rael has made it clear it will not withdraw its forces un
til the Syrians agree to withdraw as well. But with the
increase in Soviet aid and personnel in Syria in the last
three months, it is far from certain that Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad will be willing to go along with an
U.S. diplomatic effort unless the Soviets are brought
in first.
The Soviets now have approximately 5000 military
advisers in Syria, according to Western intelligence
sources, and they have replaced the surface to air mis
siles Syria lost in the war with Israel last year with an
even more advanced version. In fact, the new
SAM-ss, with a range of 150 miles, could threaten the
Israeli early warning Hawkeye aircraft.
"You have to ask if the Soviets intend to have a ma
jor increase in the presence in the Mideast," said
Eagleburger. "Is this an effort to block a peace settle
ment in the Mideast?"
"It is a very, very unwise step, especially if there may
be something more devious here," he said.

At the very least, administration Mideast experts
say, the Soviets have reintroduced themselves as a sig
nificant factor in the Mideast by the arms build-up in
Syria. The build-up started after the Lebanese war,
they say, but reached massive proportions only after
the death of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and rise to
power of Yuri Andropov. At least some Mideast ex
perts say that Andropov is trying to deal his nation
into the Mideast diplomatic picture again.
"They have always been a factor in the Mideast. But
the point has been that they can bring no one to the
Mideast peace table. If they become a greater factor it
is likely to be as a negative factor," said Eagleburger.
But beyond the immediate prospect of the Soviets
trying to block a Lebanese troop pullout is the spectre
of a superpower military confrontation in the Mid
east. The Soviets have brought in hundreds of advisers
to operate the SAM-5s and, if Israel should decide to
try to destroy those missiles, as they did last year, it
would lead to a very tense military situation.
AIDS linked to cancer virus
Washington — Researchers at three laboratories
have found evidence of a human cancer-causing virus
in patients suffering from the mysterious deadly dis
ease called AIDS, according to medical sources.
Signs of a rare type of human T-cell leukemia virus,
the first animal virus strongly associated with a specif
ic cancer in man, were found in blood samples tested
by teams headed by Dr. Robert Gallo at the National
Cancer Institute and Dr. Max Essex at the Harvard
University School of Public Health. Additional work
has also been done by French scientists, the sources
said.
Their findings are likely to provide a new focus in
the search for the cause of AIDS, or Acquired Im
mune Deficiency Syndrome. The epidemic disease
has struck about 1350 victims and killed more than 500
in this country, including homosexuals, drug addicts,
Haitians, hemophiliacs, children and others who have
received blood transfusions.
The new work is scheduled to be published in five
papers in a May issue of Science magazine. The re
searchers involved have declined to discuss any de
tails in advance.
In response to a reporter's inquiries, Gallo and Es
sex emphasized that it is too early to call the cancer
virus the cause of AIDS. Gallo commented, "This is
the beginning of something we hope opens up a new
avenue of research. But the answers are not all in."
Dr. Harold Jaffe, Centers for Disease Control of
ficial involved in tracking AIDS, said the cancer virus
"seems to be a promising lead. At least it's a lead. But
we are awaiting the release of those papers."
Several researchers cautioned that although the
cancer virus will become a leading candidate for the
cause of AIDS, it will be difficult to tell whether the
link is causal or occurred after AIDS victims became

sick. AIDS wipes out the victims' protective immune
system, making them vulnerable to life-threatening
infections as well as cancer.
The Washington Post reported last month that
Gallo had found signs of the virus in some AIDS vic
tims. Sources said recently that of dozens of samples
studied by the two U.S. groups, using different tech
niques, less than half provided antibodies or other ev
idence of the difficult-to-find virus.

know what kind. The man also claimed to have "some
type of explosive, some type of bomb."
Torres said U.S. officials knew nothing about the hi
jacker's identity.
Myers said that once the Cuban government clears
the plane to leave the island, Cuban air traffic con
trollers would advise Miami controllers of an arrival
time.
"The aircraft's on the ground in Havana, and we're
awaiting at this time word of when it will depart," he
said. "It can stay overnight, it can stay an hour, it can
stay two nights, we have no idea."
Police break up Polish rallies
Warsaw, Poland — Police used water cannon„jear
gas and baton charges in at least four Polish cities yes
terday to break up the first major pro-Solidarity dem
onstrations here in six months and the largest such
manifestations since last August.
While Polish television dismissed the incidents as
"marginal," it reported late yesterday that there were
unauthorized demonstrations in a total of 20 Polish
towns, including the most serious in Warsaw, Gdansk,
Wroclaw and Nowa Huta.
The rallies were called by underground leaders of
the banned Solidarity independent trade union
movement to counter official May Day rallies or
ganized by the Communist authorities throughout
the country.
Polish television claimed a total of about 40,000 per
sons participated nationwide in the unauthorized
rallies compared with 6.5 million in official ob
servances and said the large turnout for the official
observances was a national vote against the under
ground opposition.
Western estimates, however, put the total of Soli
darity sympathizers much higher. And in the Baltic
seaport of Gdansk, union leader Lech Walesa, who
had tacityly endorsed the call for the demonstrations
by underground leaders, said the rallies "surpassed all
our expectations."
Western correspondents on hand yesterday said up
to 40,000 Solidarity supporters joined the protest in
Gdansk alone.
The crowds were clearly smaller than during similar
illegal May Day demonstrations a year ago, but their
numbers were nonetheless surprising given the mass
of police firepower arrayed against them. Last year's

unauthorized demonstrations were allowed to pro
ceed with virtually no interference.
"The authorities demonstrated all their power, and
in doing so they demonstrated their full impotence,"
Walesa said in a telephone interview from his Gdansk
home. The union leader's apartment building was
surrounded much of the day by police, who fought
off several attempts by sympathizers to reach him.
"You've witnessed a historic event," a Polish jour
nalist said as he watched helmeted riot police con
front a chanting, flag-waving crowd near one of the
many churches in Warsaw's restored Old Town. "For
the first time ever in a Communist country, a May Day
parade was attacked by police."
May 1 is celebrated throughout much of the world
as labor day, and it is socialism's highest holiday. It ori
ginated as a commemoration of police attacks against
striking workers in Chicago's Haymarket Square in
1886.
Reagan warns on build-up
Washington — The Reagan administration said yes
terday that the Soviet build-up in Syria was unwise
and could lead to a confrontation between the super
powers in the Mideast.
Undersecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said
on CBS-TV's Face the Nation that it was still not clear
what the Soviets were trying to do with the great in
crease in military aid to Syria, but "it could create a
real danger of escalation."
Eagleburger's statement was significant because it
came as Secretary of State George Shultz is in the Mid
east trying to negotiate a pullout of all foreign forces
in Lebanon. In the last week, Shultz has concentrated
his efforts on an agreement between Israel and Leba
non, but he said over the weekend that he was ready
to travel to Damascus.
The Syrians have 30,000 troops in Lebanon, and Is
rael has made it clear it will not withdraw its forces un
til the Syrians agree to withdraw as well. But with the
increase in Soviet aid and personnel in Syria in the last
three months, it is far from certain that Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad will be willing to go along with an
U.S. diplomatic effort unless the Soviets are brought
in first.
The Soviets now have approximately 5000 military
advisers in Syria, according to Western intelligence
sources, and they have replaced the surface to air mis
siles Syria lost in the war with Israel last year with an
even more advanced version. In fact, the new
SAM-ss, with a range of 150 miles, could threaten the
Israeli early warning Hawkeye aircraft.
"You have to ask if the Soviets intend to have a ma
jor increase in the presence in the Mideast," said
Eagleburger. "Is this an effort to block a peace settle
ment in the Mideast?"
"It is a very, very unwise step, especially if there may
be something more devious here," he said.

At the very least, administration Mideast experts
say, the Soviets have reintroduced themselves as a sig
nificant factor in the Mideast by the arms build-up in
Syria. The build-up started after the Lebanese war,
they say, but reached massive proportions only after
the death of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and rise to
power of Yuri Andropov. At least some Mideast ex
perts say that Andropov is trying to deal his nation
into the Mideast diplomatic picture again.
"They have always been a factor in the Mideast. But
the point has been that they can bring no one to the
Mideast peace table. If they become a greater factor it
is likely to be as a negative factor," said Eagleburger.
But beyond the immediate prospect of the Soviets
trying to block a Lebanese troop pullout is the spectre
of a superpower military confrontation in the Mid
east. The Soviets have brought in hundreds of advisers
to operate the SAM-5s and, if Israel should decide to
try to destroy those missiles, as they did last year, it
would lead to a very tense military situation.
AIDS linked to cancer virus
Washington — Researchers at three laboratories
have found evidence of a human cancer-causing virus
in patients suffering from the mysterious deadly dis
ease called AIDS, according to medical sources.
Signs of a rare type of human T-cell leukemia virus,
the first animal virus strongly associated with a specif
ic cancer in man, were found in blood samples tested
by teams headed by Dr. Robert Gallo at the National
Cancer Institute and Dr. Max Essex at the Harvard
University School of Public Health. Additional work
has also been done by French scientists, the sources
said.
Their findings are likely to provide a new focus in
the search for the cause of AIDS, or Acquired Im
mune Deficiency Syndrome. The epidemic disease
has struck about 1350 victims and killed more than 500
in this country, including homosexuals, drug addicts,
Haitians, hemophiliacs, children and others who have
received blood transfusions.
The new work is scheduled to be published in five
papers in a May issue of Science magazine. The re
searchers involved have declined to discuss any de
tails in advance.
In response to a reporter's inquiries, Gallo and Es
sex emphasized that it is too early to call the cancer
virus the cause of AIDS. Gallo commented, "This is
the beginning of something we hope opens up a new
avenue of research. But the answers are not all in."
Dr. Harold Jaffe, Centers for Disease Control of
ficial involved in tracking AIDS, said the cancer virus
"seems to be a promising lead. At least it's a lead. But
we are awaiting the release of those papers."
Several researchers cautioned that although the
cancer virus will become a leading candidate for the
cause of AIDS, it will be difficult to tell whether the
link is causal or occurred after AIDS victims became

sick. AIDS wipes out the victims' protective immune
system, making them vulnerable to life-threatening
infections as well as cancer.
The Washington Post reported last month that
Gallo had found signs of the virus in some AIDS vic
tims. Sources said recently that of dozens of samples
studied by the two U.S. groups, using different tech
niques, less than half provided antibodies or other ev
idence of the difficult-to-find virus.
Bush gets Reagan nod
Houston — President Reagan said Saturday that if
he runs for re-election next year he will ask Vice Presi
dent George Bush to be his running mate.
"You don't break up a combination that's work
ing," the president said.
There never has been any serious doubt that Rea
gan would ask Bush to continue serving as vice presi
dent. But Saturday was the first time that Reagan pub
licly committed himself to keeping Bush on the Re
publican ticket should he be renominated.
It also was another signal that Reagan will seek a
second term, although the 72-year-old president in
sists, as do his top aides, that he has not yet decided
whetherto run.
Beyond that, Reagan's comments represented a
strong vote of confidence in Bush, who is suspected
by the president's hard-core conservative constituen
cy of being too moderate philosophically and of put
ting pragmatism over idealism.
If Reagan decides not to run — a situation his
closest aides do not expect — Bush could use Rea
gan's words as an unofficial endorsement of his own
presidential bid.
Reagan's announcement was made first in an in
terview published Saturday in the Houston Post.
Houston is Bush's hometown.
