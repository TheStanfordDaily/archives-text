# 1500 petition for Hoover investigation
## Students ask for inquiry into Hoover Institution 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
Nearly 1500 members of the Stanford community have
signed a student-initiated petition asking the board of
trustees to cond jet an inquiry into the relationship be
tween the Hoover Institution and the University, accord
ing to law students |im Steyer and Daniel Cohen.
1 he student petition drive, similar to the drive led by
Political Science Prof, john Manley and English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz among the faculty, aims to initiate "an
open and reasoned debate among the Stanford com
munity as to the proper role, if any, of the Hoover In
stitution at Stanford," Steyer said.
While the faculty charges against Hoover focus on
academic concerns such as possible violations of
academic integrity and faculty independence, the stu
dent petitions question Hoover's broader impact on the
University's national "reputation" as well as the
academic issues.
The petitioners are asking the board of trustees to
investigate the extent to which Hoover's "partisan advo
cacy," "political interests" and "involvement with the
Reagan administration" may adversely effect the Uni
versity's reputation.
Steyer, who helped draft the petition, said, "Whether
we like it or not, Hoover has a big impact at Stanford and
on Stanford's reputation. Even though it claims it is a
separate body, that's not the way the rest of the world
sees it."
Making the distinction that the question is not
whether Hoover is liberal or conservative, but whether a
"politically partisan think-tank" belongs at a "value
neutral" university, Steyer said, "We don't want this to
be an ideological debate."
Council of Presidents member-elect Peter Spivack
said that while he could not speak for the other mem
bers of next year's COP, he fully supports the requested
inquiry. In a written statement, Spivack said, "If the
Hoover Institution's policies regarding the hiring of new
fellows relate in any way to the particular political phi
losophy of a candidate, this policy demands inquiry."
Spivack also questioned whether the Institution has
any "undue say" in the selection of new faculty in Uni
versity departments.
Petitioners are concerned that costs to the University
may include the creation of a "two-class faculty" in sev
eral social science departments and partisan influence in
faculty hiring and promotion.
George Marotta, Hoover's public relations director,

disagrees strongly with claims that Hoover is politically
biased or a threat to Stanford in anyway. "The first point
that needs making is that the Hoover Institution is not
partisan and does not take positions on public policy
issues," Marotta wrote last week in a letter to the Daily.
Hoover's ideas are not all "monolithic" and the Hoover
fellows reflect an increasing diversity, Marotta said.
In an earlier interview with the Daily, Marotta said that
by definition the Institution could not promote any par
ticular ideology. "The Institution does nottake positions
on things so it cannot be partisan," he said.
While Steyer said he and the other initiators of the
petition "unconditionally offer to openly debate Hoover
at any time," he emphasized that by raising these ques
tions they do not intend "to make ad hominum attacks
upon individuals."
The petitioners said they believe that regardless of any
short-run benefits Hoover may offer the University, the
currently unquestioned activities of the Institution may
threaten the University's academic and national reputa
tion in the long-run.
Cohen, co-author of the petition said, "Whether
Hoover benefits from Stanford's reputation or Stanford
benefits from Hoover's recent political lime
light. . . .Hoover could be very detrimental."
Cohen said he is particularly concerned because the
University's institutional and financial support for
Hoover is unprecedented among America's leading uni
versities.
Hoover received $4 million of its $8.5 million budget
from the University this year: $2.6 million in unrestricted
funds for program priorities and restricted fund avail
ability to support the library and archives and $1.3 mil
lion in unrestricted funds.
In reference to the financial questions raised, Cohen
said, "I think Hoover is important as an archive and a
libraryâ€”but right now we can't separate the two." The
petitioners would like to see a disclosure of the financial
inter-relationship between the Hoover Institution and
the University.
Cohen said that they do not intend or want to abolish
the Hoover Institution, but suggested that if the Institu
tion and the University are found to be too inextricably
tied, the protestors will try to do "everything possible to
sever Stanford and Hoover entirely."
Steyer and Cohen plan to present University President
Donald Kennedy with the petition later this week.
