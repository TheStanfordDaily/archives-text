# Facilities survey: residences differ
## 
### DAN NEWELL 
The results of a recent University
survey on safety and physical condi
tions in student residences contain
no real surprises but point out areas
of campus that demand attention,
most notably Manzanita Trailer Park.
Facilities and Services distributed
the survey to 1560 students and 538
students responded.
Many students feel hazard and
damages that are reported are either
not repaired or not repaired
promptly, according to survey re
sults. )ason Mavis, associate vice
president of business and finance for
facilities and services, said that
though he is concerned about the
hazard response rate, the rate is slow
because students often route re
quests indirectly through resident
assistants or resident fellows rather
than contact the people responsible
for repairs.
Increasing the number of people a
work request goes through increases
both the time a request takes to be
processed and the chance that the
request may be lost, according to
Mavis.
While only a small percentage of
students—an average of 7.8 percent
from the 19 residences studied—
reported they have been billed for
repairs, those students generally
agreed that the price paid was too
expensive.
But lack Albrecht, assistant di
rector of facilities and services, de

fended the prices. Students are only
charged for the cost of the work, he
said. The University employes jour
neyman craftsmen, not handymen,
and the associated costs of insur
ance, shop overhead and fringe be
nefits make them expensive, but
competitive with private craftsmen,
according to Albrecht.
Manzanita dwellers gave more
negative responses than residents of
other types of campus housing.
Sixty-nine percent of the Manzanita
respondents, as compared to a cam
pus average of 17 percent, indicated
that they feel either somewhat or
very unsafe from fire, and 53 percent
(campus average: 19 percent) said
they had reported a hazard either in
their house or in the parking lot or
outside patio.
A high percentage of Manzanita
residents—s4 percent as compared
to a campus average of 11 percent—
also feel that their personal property
is either somewhat or very insecure.
Trailer residents complained
about not only safety but also about
the condition of their residence
when they moved in. Fifty-four per
cent (campus average: 11 percent)
said they felt their rooms were in
somewhat or very poor condition
and 61 percent (campus average: 20
percent) reported bathrooms in
somewhat or very poor condition.
Responses concerning the condi
tion of mattresses and bed frames
ported fair to poor conditions.
When asked about room tempera
ture, most students found it to be
"just right," though a high percent
age of Stern, Wilbur, Crothers
Memorial and Kairos residents said
the temperature is too cold and an
appreciable percentage of Branner,
Lagunita, Roble and 558 Mayfield
said it is too hot.
Insufficient space for bicycle park
ing was reported at many residences,
with almost 94 percent of Branner re
spondents noting a shortage. Au
tomobile parking was less of a prob
lem in general, but 558 Mayfield,
Storey House and Murray House res
idents found parking at their houses
particularly scarce.
Commenting on the negative re

sponse from Manzanita, trailer resi
were fairly well split between the
older, large dorms and the Row
houses and newer housing. Most
residents of the older dorms re
dent Jon Liu said, "That's pretty accu
rate. Relative to other campus resi
dences, (the trailers) are a lot easier
to break into and burn down a lot
faster. They're pretty easy to escape
from, but I guess your belongings
would get burned."
Kairos resident Sam Miller com
mented on the fact that respondents
from his house had the highest per
centage of personal property stolen,
think the house is too cold, dark and
not in satisfactory physical condi
tion. "I sometimes get the feeling the
Row doesn't care too much about
these old houses; they definitely
could use some fixing up. But I'd
rather live in a slum like this than a
prison like Wilbur."
