## Law students to open East Palo Alto legal aid project 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
For a group of law students here,
the "Me Generation' may be coming
to an end.
The students, who see a need for
"two disparate communities to come
together in a positive way," are work
ing to serve the needs of Stanford's
clinical law program and to do some
thing about a "dearth of legal ser
vices" in East Palo Alto by establish
ing the East Palo Alto Community
Law Project.
If their project is successful — and
they say they are confident it will be
— asearly as September lawstudents
here will begin to work under
lawyers in an office in East Palo Alto

to help residents there to become
"self-reliant" on legal issues, accord
ing to Steve Dinkelspiel, chairman of
fundraising tor the project.
"You don't always need a lawyer,
but you do need to know your rights.
What we have focused on to date is
providing landlord-tenant services
and public assistance benefits
cases," Dinkelspiel explained.
The driving force behind the proj
ect is a group of individuals "who are
aware ot the needs of East Palo Alto
and see a neat opportunity to have
the Law School expand its clinical
programs. They also see the need of
these two disparate communities to
come together in a positive way. East
Palo Alto needs this bad,'' said Jim

'If the faculty as a whole feels the project is
academically successful (after the first two
years) then the Law School will take responsibil
ity. Right now the agreement is that we will raise
the money for the first two years. We'll get it. We
need to raise a total of $250,000, and we'll get
that'-Jim Steyer.

Steyer, a third-year law student and
one of the founding members of the
project.
Law students began the project
two years ago and since then the\
have succeeded in establishing a
board of directors composed of stu
dents, East Palo Alto community
leaders, Bay Area judges and attor
neys and professors from the law
School.
The students hope to make the
project a permanent part of the Law
School's seminars on poverty law.
Currently students in these seminars
are "farmed out" to work in a legal
aid office in Redwood City, accord
ing to Pegg\ Russel, president of the
student officers behind the project.
The group sees this work as an
interim step" in the effort to estab
lish an office in East Palo Alto.
Their idea of establishing the East
Palo Alto office is not an entirely new
one, however.
In the late 60s Law Prof, lack Frie
denthal helped secure a grant to
allow students to provide legal help
in East Palo Alto under the auspices
of the San Mateo Legal Aid Office.
"We got a $50,000 grant for a two
and-a-half-year period to supply a
lawyer and a staff for the office. The
quid pro quo was that students were
going to work for this lawyer and
help him," Friedenthal said.
"The office got going and ran for a
number of years, but our money ran
out. Stanford did what it could under
its budget to keep the project going,
but finally the funds got so restrictive
that the office couldn't stay open.
But it really was never supposed to
go beyond that initial grant, so what
we did after that was a bonus. There
was just not enough of the basic
funds," Friedenthal said.
However, the Law School has
struck a deal with the students on the
funding of this program. Law School
Dean John Ely has told the group that
it it can raise the money to sustain the
project for the first two years, the
Daw School will examine the
academic success of the project and
may provide some funding then.
"If the faculty as a whole feels the
project is academically successful
(after the two years).then the Law
School will take responsibility. Right
now the agreement is that we will
raise the money for the first two
years. We'll get it. We need to raise a
total of $250,000, and we'll get that,"
Steyer said.
The group is already on its way to

earning the initial $250,000. The San
Francisco Foundation, a Ba\ Area
community foundation which do
nates money to groups working in
urban affairs, has already offered the
students $125,000.
"We do a lot of tunding of legal
aid, and this is a fairly unique project
because of the connection ot the Law
School and the community. They're
designing it in response to a com
munity need. It's innovative in that
its combining law courses with legal
services for the community," ex
plained Carol Piasente, director ot
communications tor the San Fran
cisco Foundation.
According to Steyer, the group has
a number of other "coals in the fire.
We're working with other founda
tions, the local bar, and individuals
who support the project. Various
foundations have rejected us, but we
have others still in negotiations.
We'll get the money," he said.
The group also hopes to work out
an arrangement in which the San
Mateo Legal Aid Office will supply
two of the four attorneys who will
work in the East Palo Alto office,
thereby cutting their costs consid
erably.
The group will charge residents for
legal services on a sliding scale based
on ability to pay, but not to help fund
the project. "The reason we will do
that is because the community wants
us to. There's a sense that you're pay
ing for a service and it's not a hand
out. It's an issue of self-respect. They
don't expect a handout, they want to
pay for a high quality service," Steyer
explained.
This philosophy also applies to the
group's choice of a name for the
project. "It's the East Palo Alto
Community Law Project, and not a
clinic. I think we have a sense that the
word 'clinic' implies that it's some
thing that we're giving. But this is a
community project. We're working
with the community and there are
members of the community on our
board," Steyer said.
East Palo Alto community leaders
have already praised the students' ef
forts.
"The East Palo Alto community has
the same legal needs as every other
community: the need for legal as
sistance in the area of juvenile in
volvement, senior advocates, and
tenant and landlord problems. I
think some of the students in the
group come out of the same kind of
communities vou find in East Palo

Alto so they have a feeling for the
thing and a desire to do it. This can be
a very positive project," explained
Barbara Mouton, a member of the
East Palo Alto municipal council.
The group has already developed
some ideas on what the project could
accomplish should it survive for an
extended length of time.
"Eventually we'd like to expand
sevices to encompass family law or
criminal law practices. That's a long
term thing, though. We'd also like to
get into representing clients in con
troversies with the welfare office, the
unemployment office, and the Social
Security office," Dinkelspiel said.

Dinkelspiel said he is unsure it the
group will have the money to open in
September. "It's not clear if we're
going to be able to do that. We may
have to wait until later in the fall or in
January. We're hopeful, but realisti
cally speaking, it's hard to predict,"
Dinkelspiel said.
Despite Dinkelspiel's uncertainty,
Steyer said he is confident the proj
ect will succeed.
"We'd like to open in the begin
ning of September, and I think that's
realistic. Obviously there are a lot
hurdles to get over, but it helps to be
optimistic."
