# To write or not to write-the ultimate question
## Verbal SAT scores declining among top students 
### GINA ZADRA 
How well can students write?
Supposedly among the na
tion's best and brightest, stu
dents and faculty alike are
often surprised by the poor
writing skills of students here.
Each year statistics are re
leased which reveal students'
weaknesses in writing. The
mean verbal score on the
Scholastic Aptitude Tests
(SATs) declined 49 points be
tween 1963 and 1977. College
graduates' scores on the
Graduate Record Examinations
(CjREs) reflect a similar pattern.
Recent research has focused
on an even more alarming
trend. Studies indicate that the
most dramatic decline in writ
ten and verbal skills has oc
curred within the top quarter
of the students taking college
boards. Since 1972, the
number of students scoring
650 and above on the verbal
SATs has declined 45 percent.
Thus students typically ac
cepted by Stanford fall into the
category of those who have
shown the least advancement
in the last decade.
Stanford has been able to at
tract an increasing percentage
of students from the shrinking
pool of those who score well
on the verbal SAT. But writing
has become a major concern of
students here — whether they
try to avoid papers or want to
write more of them.
Said junior Alex Gurza, an
American studies major, "I
think Stanford students are af
raid of writing." Gurza pointed
to the high number of students
who shy away from small col
loquia because they know
these types of classes usually
require a paper.
According to English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz, the best way
to conquer fear is to face it, but
at Stanford students are not
forced to confront the fear of
writing. "I maintain that if one

is shrewd and careful, it is pos
sible at Stanford to never write
another essay after Freshman
English u nd Western Culture."
Stanford's graduation re
quirements include a two
quarter writing requirement.
Students not exempted by a
high score on the Advanced
Placement (AP) English test
usually fulfill this requirement
with Freshman English.
As anyone who has lived
near freshmen knows, the En
glish requirement draws mixed
reactions.
Senior Craig Thrower, an
electrical engineering major,
recalled his two quarters of
Freshman English as "a rehash
of high school English. I didn't
take it seriously because it
wasn't challenging; I lost
interest quickly."
Liz Berecz, a sophomore
majoring in economics, ex
pressed a similar opinion.
Berecz felt that the units could
have been betterspent: "It was a
waste of time. There was not
enough personal attention. It
was more a process of adopting
the writing style of the professor
that developing a style of my
own."
English Prof. Nancy Packer,
director of Freshman English,
said the problem is "one of
time and lack of interest and
motivation on the part of the
freshmen." When finals and
midterms come around, stu
dents spend more time study
ing and less time writing.
"Writing is the first thing to
go," Packer said.
But Packer shifts the blame
from the ac ademic structure to
society at large, saying that this
is the way society is moving.
We are a society "based on
sensationalism," she said.
"Reading and writing are both

declining due to too many dis
tractions (i.e. computers, tele
vision and video)." Demands
on student time have increased
at the same time that there has
been an increased awareness
of the decline in student writ
ing ability, according to
Packer.
Rebholz, on the other hand,
sees the time problem directly
related to Stanford's quarter
system. "Because of the quar
ter system, after Freshman En
glish, a focus on writing style
and ability is virtually impossi
ble to achieve," he said. "Stu
dents simply do not have

adequate time to reflect, to do
a couple of drafts or revisions."
He added, "We pay a big
price at Stanford, as far as writ
ing, by sticking to the quarter
system, which establishes a
tremendous pace.
Freshman Darieck Scott said
he was pleased with his experi
ence in Freshman English. "It
was helpful, especially in the
long run,"he said. But he ad
ded, "ll is good to be able to
place out it you have the abil
ity."
Freshman Vince Greene was
even more enthusiastic in his
praise tor Freshman English. "I

loved it. It has helped me more
than any other class at Stanford
so far," he said. But he agreed
that students tend to view the
class as "just another require
ment to get through."
Taking writing seriously is a
concern throughout the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences.
As Prof. |ohn Brauman,
chairman of the Chemistry De
partment, said, "I do think it is
important that people write
and communicate well."
Brauman also pointed to the
problem of "objective grad
ing" where more emphasis is

given to the content than the
prose, allowing students to
maintain a sloppy writing style
while still doing well.
The problems facing under
graduates' writing ability are
reflected in the negative asso
ciations writing has developed.
Papers are usually given as al
ternatives to exams. The syl
labus in one English class even
reads, "... you will not have
to neglect the readings to write
a long paper ..." And the dis
tribution requirements de
mand three quarters of a
foreign language while only
two quarters of writing in En
glish.
But the University is making
an effort. Two programs —
Freshman English and the En
gineering Communications
Program — are aimed at im
proving the writing skills of
undergraduates.
Rebholz said that in the time
Packer has been director of the
Freshman Writing Program,
she has "solidified a marvelous
system tor Freshman Fnglish
based upon writing workshops
and theme courses."
Packer attributed the suc
cesses of the Freshman Writing
Program to a "very good staff
and good training program for
the graduate students who
teach." She also cited the Uni
versity's strong commitment to
writing over the past five years,
which has been backed by
budgetary aid.
But this emphasis on writing
often fades after freshman
year. Rebholz said that all pro
fessors, not just Freshman En
glish professors, should make
a commitment to writing.
David Lougee, the director
of the Communication Pro
gram in the School of Engineer
ing, discussed a different ap

proac h to writing. "There is an
ac ute sense of the importance
professionally of writing felt by
the faculty and administration
of the E ngi nee ring School," he
said.
Since it was founded in 1976,
the Communication Program
has expanded and now offers
classes in both writing and
public speaking. Lougee said
the Engineering School's "pro
fessional emphasis" should
solve the problem of motiva
tion.
"Engineers spend about
one-fourth of their time in the
real world' writing and at least
that much time dealing with
the writing of others," Lougee
said. "The students in the writ
ing classes are tremendously
motivated due to their recogni
tion of the need and impor
tance of writing skills."
The Engineering School re
quires all electrical engineer
ing majors to take a specific
writing coursc All chemical
engineers do a senior report in
conjunction with an advisor
and a writing tutor. For en
gineers, Lougee said, the focus
of writing is "practice for real
ity."
Does the focus on writing
pay off for Stanford students
entering the job market? De
bbie Duncan, assistant director
of the Career Planning and
Placement Center, said al
though recruiters do not fill
out formal evaluations of stu
dents they do comment on
Stanford students' well writ
ten resumes and ability to ex
press themselves well in inter
views. -
Whether the ability of ex
pression exhibited in an inter
view carries over into the job
itself remains an unanswered
question. But perhaps the fact
that both the Law School and
the School of Business support
graduate writing programs
provides part of the answer.
