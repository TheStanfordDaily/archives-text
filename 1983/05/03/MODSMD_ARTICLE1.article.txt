# SLAC director to retire
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky, director
of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center and renowned arms control
advocate, will retire from his ad
ministrative post Aug. 30, 1984.
Panofsky, 64, said yesterday his
decision to step down is part of an
"informal policy" at SLAC where top
administrators relinquish their jobs
after turning 65. Though he said he is
"not the plotting type," he plans to
work at the accelerator as a profes
sor, as well as lecture in the Stanford
Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum.
SI AC's informal retirement policy
was instituted because "people do
slow down. You do less damage as a
professor than as a lab director,"
Panofsky said.
"My retirement was set by the
calendar," Panofsky said.
Provost Albert Hastorf said a 10-
member search committee has been
formed to find Panofsky's replace
ment.
Sidney Drell, deputy director of
SLAC and a member of the commit
tee, said Panofsky's replacement
would be "filling some very big
shoes" because Panofsky is ' univer
sally recognized as the greatest high
energy lab director the world's ever
known."
Drell said he is "not a candidate for
director."
Panofsky has been the director of
SLAC since 1961 and a member of the
Stanford faculty since 1951.
Nationally known as a supporter of
arms control, Panofsky has been a
consultant to the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency and was on the
General at the
While House during the' Carter ad
ministration. Panofsky said, how
ever, that there has been "very little
communication" between himself
and the Reagan administration. He
has been a vocal critic of Reagan's
policies, and recently decried the
president's announcement asking
scientists to speed up research on
space-based anti-ballistic missiles
(ABMs).
Hastorf, who is the chairman of the
search committee, said Panofsky had
first mentioned his retirement last
October before the proposal was in
troduced at SSRL. Panofsky submit
ted a formal letter announcing his
imminent retirement )an. 10.
Hastorf said Panofsky is a "great
man and a great physicist who has
made SLAC the absolutely great facil
ity that it is.
Hastorf also said the committee is
"getting started early" to search for
Panofsky's replacement. The board
of trustees will appoint the new di
rector, but the appointment is sub
ject to approval by the Department of
Energy under the terms of a contract
between the University and the DoE.
