The nature of the relationship between the
University and the Hoover Institution has come
>i>to question as a result of both faculty and
student petitions. More than 1500 community
members and 66 faculty members have indi
cated they are concerned about this relation
ship. Some of the concerns expressed seem
wide of the mark. For example, some critics
have charged that Hoover uses its ties with the
University to make its political advocacy more
effective. Nevertheless, the interest expressed
by the petitioners is reason enough for the fac
ulty senate to ask the board of trustees to study
the questions which have been raised.
Of special importance to such a study would
be an examination of the hiring process for
Hoover fellows. Currently, fellows are hired
and fired outside of the regular academic hiring
process. Petitioners charge Hoover with sys
temic political bias, and it seems that it is in the
best interests of all concerned for this issue to
be examined. If the charges prove false, so
much the better for the Institution. If, however,
they are true, the University should take action
to reform the system.
Another important issue raised by students
and facultv concerns the budget of the Institu

tion and the degree to which it is funded by the
University. The Institution's libraryand archives
receive $2.6 million in unrestricted funds (out of
a total Hoover budget of $8.4 million); they are
integrated into the Stanford University Library
Network and are accessible to all students and
scholars here. However, additional funding
from University restricted funds is applied to
ward other aspects of the Institution's opera
tions.
The board of trustees should investigate
whether or not the University should accept
these restricted funds specifically directed to
ward the Institution and Hoover's use of them;
however, it must be remembered that not using
these funds for the Institution would help no
other University program because of the nature
of restricted funds â€” they are donated to the
University for the specific purpose of funding
the Institution.
The University and the Institution have had a
long and often profitable relationship. Still, we
believe that both the Institution and the Univer
sity have changed significantly in the past years,
and that now is the time to re-examine the rela
tionship of the two and to make any necessary
changes.
