# Andrew Bennett The sound and the fury
## Window of negotiability 
### 
At long last, President Reagan has
personally and visibly taken respon
sibility for his administration's
policies in Central America. In a joint
session of Congress last week, a
forum usually reserved for critically
important occasions such as declara
tions of war, the president re
sponded to a growing backlash to his
Central American policies by giving
his own view of what he described as
a brewing crisis in Central America.
"Crisis" is indeed the appropriate
word, for it carries a double mean
tg, signifying both danger and op
portunity.
The crisis of U.S. policy in Central
America also has two sides to it, the
first being the configuration of
domestic political forces in the
United States and the second being
the political and military situation
"on the ground" in Central America.
Unfortunately, it appears that the
president's speech missed the op
portunities and exacerbated the
dangers in both arenas. Only one
week after what is perhaps the most
important address of the first two
years of his administration , the pres
ident's pronouncements lie still
-1 orn, a prescription for disaster.
"I he danger for domestic politics in
t:»e United States is clear to anyone
who watched the president's
speech. At numerous points in the
president's address, the Republican
half of the chamber leapt to its feet,
praising the president with wild
applause and literally jeering at the
Democrats on the other side of the
aisle who remained seated and gave
restrained and polite applause.
Only at one point did both the
Democrats and the Republicans
stand in unison to cheer the presi
dent when he stated categorically
that he would never send U.S. com
bat troops to fight in El Salvador. This
performance caused numerous
commentators and congressmen to
take note of the ugly specter of a
bitter and divisive partisan battle
over foreign policy between Democ
rats and Republicans. This prospect
is profoundly disturbing for a nation
that has been searching for a biparti
san consensus on foreign policy ever
since the national trauma over the
Vietnam war.
Ironically, this divisive struggle
looms overhead just when there are
signs that a new sweeping consensus
may be forming in U.S. public opin
ion. A recent Los Angeles Times arti
cle revealed the outlines of this new
and seemingly contradictory con
sensus. Americans overwhelmingly
agreed that Soviet power was a threat
to U.S. security, they overwhelm
ingly agreed that Central America
was an area of vital strategic impor
tance to the U.S., and yet they agreed
by a two-to-one margin that the

United States should not send its
troops to keep the rebels from win
ning in El Salvador even if it appeared
that the government was about to
collapse in that country. Is the public
so simplistic that it demands to have
its cake and eat it too? Quite the con
trary; it may very well be that after a
decade of soul searching in the wake
of Vietnam, the American public has
arrived at an intuitive but sophisti
cated understanding of the require
ments of containment as the author
of containment, George Kennan,
originally perceived them.
In a famous article by "Mr. X" in
Foreign Affairs in 1947, Kennan out
lined the necessity of containing the
expansionistic tendencies of the
USSR, a necessity that became the
centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy for
well over two decades. Yet Kennan
has argued since that his original idea
of economically, diplomatically and,
last and least, militarily containing
Soviet power was mistakenly trans
lated into policy of militarily contain
ing communism on a global scale.
Judging from recent expressions
of public opinion, it looks like the
American people have learned
through the painful lesson of Viet
nam the distinction between con
taining Soviet power and containing
communism and the futility of pursu
ing one-sided military solutions to
what are fundamentally political and
socio-economic problems. President
Reagan has perhaps missed an his
toric opportunity to seize a new con
sensus by pursuing a peaceful politi
cal solution to the problems of Cent
ral America and articulating the criti
cal difference between containing
Soviet power and containing local
revolutionary movements that ac
cept help from Moscow to overthrow
repressive governments, not in
to become puppets of the USSR, but
simply in order to win.
The failure to seize upon the op
portunity to create a consensus be
hind a less bellicose policy in Central
America constitutes a critical danger
to the peace and stability of Central
America itself. The president
preached a move toward a
negotiated settlement in El Salvador,
but in practice his continued re
quests for more military aid and his
ill-advised appointment of former
Sen. Robert Stone as a regional
negotiator signal a continuation of
the emphasis on military solutions.
Stone, who was recently a registered
lobbyist for the harshly repressive
government of Guatemala and is a
hard-line anti-communist, looks to
be the Kenneth Adelman, James Watt
and Anne Gorsuch of Central Ameri
can policy; he obviously lacks the
unbiased credentials that are an ab
solute necessity for delicate negotia
tions in such a highly polarized situa

tion.
In addition, the continued empha
sis on a military solution by the
United States polarizes the situation
even further and plays into the hands
of the extremists in the government,
the army and the rebel opposition in
El Salvador who are pushing for mili
tary victory. Finally, the president's
unwillingness to amend or even ac
knowledge the "secret" war that he
is supporting against the goverment
of Nicaragua promises to push that
country into the Soviet camp and
cause its government to curb in the
name of security the political free
doms and human rights that the Re
agan administration is so copiously
concerned about in Nicaragua and so
callously indifferent to in El Salvador.
This renewed emphasis on military
solutions comes at a time when the
conditions in Central America offer a
"window of negotiability" which
may soon disappear if it is not
opened wider. With the death last
month of the hard-line Salvadoran
guerilla commander Salvador Car
pio, the rebels may be more open to
negotiations if given a real opportu
nity for peaceful political participa
tion.
In the army, a new defense minis
ter, General Carlos Casanova, has
been installed, and his willingness
to negotiate deserves to beexplored.
In the government, the extremist re
puted leader of many of El Salvador's
right-wing death squads, Roberto
d'Aibuisson, has suffered a number
of legislative setbacks and former
President Jose Duarte, a moderate
Christian Democrat who has af
firmed the necessity of a dialogue
with the guerillas, seems ascendant
and is a likely presidential candidate
in the elections late this year.
Duarte's running mate in 1972, Guil
lermo Ungo, who has become the
leader in exile of the political arm of
the opposition, has reaffirmed his
willingness to take the initiative in
regional negotiations with El Sal
vador and Nicaragua, but the sup
port they have received from the Re
agan administration has been less
than enthusiastic — a recently leaked
administration planning document
stressed the need to "isolate" the
government of Mexico.
In sum, the present crisis in U.S.
policy in Central America presents
unique opportunities for a peaceful
settlement, yet the Reagan adminis
tration seems intent on exacerbating
the very dangers that it professes to
avert. Only three things stand in the
way of the administration's policies
and its policy goals: Congress, the
American public and reality.

performance caused numerous
commentators and congressmen to
take note of the ugly specter of a
bitter and divisive partisan battle
over foreign policy between Democ
rats and Republicans. This prospect
is profoundly disturbing for a nation
that has been searching for a biparti
san consensus on foreign policy ever
since the national trauma over the
Vietnam war.
Ironically, this divisive struggle
looms overhead just when there are
signs that a new sweeping consensus
may be forming in U.S. public opin
ion. A recent Los Angeles Times arti
cle revealed the outlines of this new
and seemingly contradictory con
sensus. Americans overwhelmingly
agreed that Soviet power was a threat
to U.S. security, they overwhelm
ingly agreed that Central America
was an area of vital strategic impor
tance to the U.S., and yet they agreed
by a two-to-one margin that the

United States should not send its
troops to keep the rebels from win
ning in El Salvador even if it appeared
that the government was about to
collapse in that country. Is the public
so simplistic that it demands to have
its cake and eat it too? Quite the con
trary; it may very well be that after a
decade of soul searching in the wake
of Vietnam, the American public has
arrived at an intuitive but sophisti
cated understanding of the require
ments of containment as the author
of containment, George Kennan,
originally perceived them.
In a famous article by "Mr. X" in
Foreign Affairs in 1947, Kennan out
lined the necessity of containing the
expansionistic tendencies of the
USSR, a necessity that became the
centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy for
well over two decades. Yet Kennan
has argued since that his original idea
of economically, diplomatically and,
last and least, militarily containing
Soviet power was mistakenly trans
lated into policy of militarily contain
ing communism on a global scale.
Judging from recent expressions
of public opinion, it looks like the
American people have learned
through the painful lesson of Viet
nam the distinction between con
taining Soviet power and containing
communism and the futility of pursu
ing one-sided military solutions to
what are fundamentally political and
socio-economic problems. President
Reagan has perhaps missed an his
toric opportunity to seize a new con
sensus by pursuing a peaceful politi
cal solution to the problems of Cent
ral America and articulating the criti
cal difference between containing
Soviet power and containing local
revolutionary movements that ac
cept help from Moscow to overthrow
repressive governments, not in
to become puppets of the USSR, but
simply in order to win.
The failure to seize upon the op
portunity to create a consensus be
hind a less bellicose policy in Central
America constitutes a critical danger
to the peace and stability of Central
America itself. The president
preached a move toward a
negotiated settlement in El Salvador,
but in practice his continued re
quests for more military aid and his
ill-advised appointment of former
Sen. Robert Stone as a regional
negotiator signal a continuation of
the emphasis on military solutions.
Stone, who was recently a registered
lobbyist for the harshly repressive
government of Guatemala and is a
hard-line anti-communist, looks to
be the Kenneth Adelman, James Watt
and Anne Gorsuch of Central Ameri
can policy; he obviously lacks the
unbiased credentials that are an ab
solute necessity for delicate negotia
tions in such a highly polarized situa

tion.
In addition, the continued empha
sis on a military solution by the
United States polarizes the situation
even further and plays into the hands
of the extremists in the government,
the army and the rebel opposition in
El Salvador who are pushing for mili
tary victory. Finally, the president's
unwillingness to amend or even ac
knowledge the "secret" war that he
is supporting against the goverment
of Nicaragua promises to push that
country into the Soviet camp and
cause its government to curb in the
name of security the political free
doms and human rights that the Re
agan administration is so copiously
concerned about in Nicaragua and so
callously indifferent to in El Salvador.
This renewed emphasis on military
solutions comes at a time when the
conditions in Central America offer a
"window of negotiability" which
may soon disappear if it is not
opened wider. With the death last
month of the hard-line Salvadoran
guerilla commander Salvador Car
pio, the rebels may be more open to
negotiations if given a real opportu
nity for peaceful political participa
tion.
In the army, a new defense minis
ter, General Carlos Casanova, has
been installed, and his willingness
to negotiate deserves to beexplored.
In the government, the extremist re
puted leader of many of El Salvador's
right-wing death squads, Roberto
d'Aibuisson, has suffered a number
of legislative setbacks and former
President Jose Duarte, a moderate
Christian Democrat who has af
firmed the necessity of a dialogue
with the guerillas, seems ascendant
and is a likely presidential candidate
in the elections late this year.
Duarte's running mate in 1972, Guil
lermo Ungo, who has become the
leader in exile of the political arm of
the opposition, has reaffirmed his
willingness to take the initiative in
regional negotiations with El Sal
vador and Nicaragua, but the sup
port they have received from the Re
agan administration has been less
than enthusiastic — a recently leaked
administration planning document
stressed the need to "isolate" the
government of Mexico.
In sum, the present crisis in U.S.
policy in Central America presents
unique opportunities for a peaceful
settlement, yet the Reagan adminis
tration seems intent on exacerbating
the very dangers that it professes to
avert. Only three things stand in the
way of the administration's policies
and its policy goals: Congress, the
American public and reality.

At long last, President Reagan has
personally and visibly taken respon
sibility for his administration's
policies in Central America. In a joint
session of Congress last week, a
forum usually reserved for critically
important occasions such as declara
tions of war, the president re
sponded to a growing backlash to his
Central American policies by giving
his own view of what he described as
a brewing crisis in Central America.
"Crisis" is indeed the appropriate
word, for it carries a double mean
tg, signifying both danger and op
portunity.
The crisis of U.S. policy in Central
America also has two sides to it, the
first being the configuration of
domestic political forces in the
United States and the second being
the political and military situation
"on the ground" in Central America.
Unfortunately, it appears that the
president's speech missed the op
portunities and exacerbated the
dangers in both arenas. Only one
week after what is perhaps the most
important address of the first two
years of his administration , the pres
ident's pronouncements lie still
-1 orn, a prescription for disaster.
"I he danger for domestic politics in
t:»e United States is clear to anyone
who watched the president's
speech. At numerous points in the
president's address, the Republican
half of the chamber leapt to its feet,
praising the president with wild
applause and literally jeering at the
Democrats on the other side of the
aisle who remained seated and gave
restrained and polite applause.
Only at one point did both the
Democrats and the Republicans
stand in unison to cheer the presi
dent when he stated categorically
that he would never send U.S. com
bat troops to fight in El Salvador. This
