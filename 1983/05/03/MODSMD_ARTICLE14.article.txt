## A
						true love of engineering 
### 
James Azzarello's article ("Pawn
ing the Golden Torch of Wisdom,"
Daily, April 29) asks the question,
"what engineering major is studying
because he loves engineering?"
Well, I hate to shock you, but I for
one intend to study mechanical en
gineering not because I want "a five
or six-digit salary" and not because I
want to get into a top professional
school, but because I enjoy en
gineering. I also know for a fact that
I'm not the only one who loves en
gineering. I find that I have a fascina
tion with how technology works and
I get a sense of satisfaction from
being able to apply knowledge for
use in the world. The implication that
all engineers are solely pursuing

money is a ridiculous stereotype.
Secondly, Stanford offers an edu
cation that allows engineering
majors to learn about "what is larger
than themselves and their personal
ambitions." Fngineers need to have
an understanding of the world
around them; in particular, they
need to have an understanding of
how technology interacts in the
world around them. However, their
scope of knowledge should not be
limited to technology. Stanford of
fers an education that can include
engineering and a broader under
standing of the world. Very few
technical schools offer such a com
bination.
Thirdly, Azzarello encourages the

exploration of unsettling ideas.
People should perhaps examine this
unsettling idea: engineering as an in
tellectual subject. Engineering re
quires a broad understanding of the
physical world and the knowledge of
how to apply physical principles just
as, say, history requires a deep un
derstanding of the development of
society. In each case, one discipline
excludes some aspect of the world
around us, but each has significance
as an intellectual subject. The choice
of which discipline is more important
should be a personal one.
