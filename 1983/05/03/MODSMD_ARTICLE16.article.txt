## Institution unjustly criticized 
### 
Some of the stories published in the Daily on Hoover
contain considerable error, not worthy of Stanford fac
ulty, students or your reporters who ought to check out
statements. I would like to comment on some of these.
• Hoover funds. The Hoover Institution does not
receive any monies from Stanford's operating or en
dowment funds other than the $2.6 million assigned for
its library, which is integrated with the other University
libraries. All of Hoover's remaining funds for administra
tion and research either come from annual gifts for its
on-going activities or are taken from Hoover's endow
ment income. The Hoover endowment, monies do
nated specifically for Hoover, is administered as part of
the Stanford endowment, much like monies given for
chairs or other research organizations. The confusion
about this arises from the fact that since Hoover is part of
the University, all of its funds are handled by Stanford,
and the allocations appear in the University budget.
• Since the political affiliations of Hoover scholars
have become a matter of public debate, I thought I
would try to find out what they actually are. The core
group of scholars in residence at Hoover consists of 25

The core group of scholars in resi
dence at Hoover consists of 25
senior and senior research fellows.
As far as I can discover, 11 of them
are Democrats and 10 are Republi
cans. Three inform me that they are
independents. .. while one other is
not an American citizen.

senior and senior research fellows. As far as I can dis
cover, 11 of them are Democrats and 10 are Republicans.
Three inform me that they are independents, that they
do not support either party, while one other is not an
American citizen.
As in academe generally, Hoover scholars vary by dis
cipline affiliation. Economics is the most conservative
field in the social sciences and at Hoover six of the
economists are Republicans, two are Democrats (one of
whom belongs to the Democratic Socialists), two are
independents and one is a foreigner. The sociologists
and political scientists, more liberal generally, are pre
dominantly Democrats at Hoover by nine (including
one, Gerald Dorfman, who founded and puts out the
Marxist quarterly, Politics and Society) to three Republi
cans. Among the historians at Hoover, one is a Republi
can and the other is an independent.
This breakdown does not include nine people who
also hold the rank of senior or senior research fellow,

but who are administrators either of the Institution gen
erally or of the various library collections. It alsodoesnot
count 11 individuals who have retired from their previ
ous positions because of age, who hold Hoover ap
pointments, many of whom are either not paid by
Hoover or receive moderate post-retirement income
supplements. I have not looked into the politics of the 14
national and public affairs fellows, younger scholars
from universities around the country who have a one
year fellowship, awarded annually through an open
nationwide competition.
There are also a number of people who have titles as
Hoover fellows, who are resident elsewhere. For the
most part they are not paid by the Institution and are not
engaged in research for Hoover.
For the record, I would note that there are only three
Hoover fellows employed in Washington by the Reagan
administration, only one of whom was an active Hoover
scholar before he left, a second was an administrator
and a third, who has worked for many administrations
was a post-retirement appointee.
• The report in the Daily that Heinz Eulau "wrote a
letter inviting Alvin Rabushka, a Hoover seniorfellow, to
accept a courtesy appointment with the Department" is
in error. A political science appointment for Rabushka
has never been formally proposed or discussed at a
department meeting.
• The suggestion that Hoover "demanded 'reciproc
ity' from the political science department in return for
giving a number of its faculty joint or courtesy appoint
ments" came up in the context of discussions concern
ing the proposal by the department that Prof. Harry
Harding be given a joint appointment with Hoover, as
part of an effort to meet an outside offer. A senior
member of the Political Science Department stated that it
Hoover did this, it should understand there would be no
reciprocity with respect to giving Hoover people ap
pointments in the department.
• The report that the only book published by the
Hoover Press not written by a Hoover fellow was one by
Ed Meese is an error. Hoover has published many books
by persons unaffiliated with the Institution.
• Finally, I would note that the arrangements with the
University for the appointment of Hoover staff require
that the no political discrimination policy applies to
Hoover, and the senior fellow appoinments are to be
made on recommendation to the director by a search
committee. The director, in turn, recommends to the
president of the University, who is supposed to have
such recommendations reviewed by an ad hoc faculty
committee appointed by him who advise him as to
whether to nominate the candidates to the trustees.

Hoover fellows employed in Washington by the Reagan
administration, only one of whom was an active Hoover
scholar before he left, a second was an administrator
and a third, who has worked for many administrations
was a post-retirement appointee.
• The report in the Daily that Heinz Eulau "wrote a
letter inviting Alvin Rabushka, a Hoover seniorfellow, to
accept a courtesy appointment with the Department" is
in error. A political science appointment for Rabushka
has never been formally proposed or discussed at a
department meeting.
• The suggestion that Hoover "demanded 'reciproc
ity' from the political science department in return for
giving a number of its faculty joint or courtesy appoint
ments" came up in the context of discussions concern
ing the proposal by the department that Prof. Harry
Harding be given a joint appointment with Hoover, as
part of an effort to meet an outside offer. A senior
member of the Political Science Department stated that it
Hoover did this, it should understand there would be no
reciprocity with respect to giving Hoover people ap
pointments in the department.
• The report that the only book published by the
Hoover Press not written by a Hoover fellow was one by
Ed Meese is an error. Hoover has published many books
by persons unaffiliated with the Institution.
• Finally, I would note that the arrangements with the
University for the appointment of Hoover staff require
that the no political discrimination policy applies to
Hoover, and the senior fellow appoinments are to be
made on recommendation to the director by a search
committee. The director, in turn, recommends to the
president of the University, who is supposed to have
such recommendations reviewed by an ad hoc faculty
committee appointed by him who advise him as to
whether to nominate the candidates to the trustees.

Some of the stories published in the Daily on Hoover
contain considerable error, not worthy of Stanford fac
ulty, students or your reporters who ought to check out
statements. I would like to comment on some of these.
• Hoover funds. The Hoover Institution does not
receive any monies from Stanford's operating or en
dowment funds other than the $2.6 million assigned for
its library, which is integrated with the other University
libraries. All of Hoover's remaining funds for administra
tion and research either come from annual gifts for its
on-going activities or are taken from Hoover's endow
ment income. The Hoover endowment, monies do
nated specifically for Hoover, is administered as part of
the Stanford endowment, much like monies given for
chairs or other research organizations. The confusion
about this arises from the fact that since Hoover is part of
the University, all of its funds are handled by Stanford,
and the allocations appear in the University budget.
• Since the political affiliations of Hoover scholars
have become a matter of public debate, I thought I
would try to find out what they actually are. The core
group of scholars in residence at Hoover consists of 25

The core group of scholars in resi

senior and senior research fellows. As far as I can dis
cover, 11 of them are Democrats and 10 are Republicans.
Three inform me that they are independents, that they
do not support either party, while one other is not an
American citizen.
As in academe generally, Hoover scholars vary by dis
cipline affiliation. Economics is the most conservative
field in the social sciences and at Hoover six of the
economists are Republicans, two are Democrats (one of
whom belongs to the Democratic Socialists), two are
independents and one is a foreigner. The sociologists
and political scientists, more liberal generally, are pre
dominantly Democrats at Hoover by nine (including
one, Gerald Dorfman, who founded and puts out the
Marxist quarterly, Politics and Society) to three Republi
cans. Among the historians at Hoover, one is a Republi
can and the other is an independent.
This breakdown does not include nine people who
also hold the rank of senior or senior research fellow,

but who are administrators either of the Institution gen
erally or of the various library collections. It alsodoesnot
count 11 individuals who have retired from their previ
ous positions because of age, who hold Hoover ap
pointments, many of whom are either not paid by
Hoover or receive moderate post-retirement income
supplements. I have not looked into the politics of the 14
national and public affairs fellows, younger scholars
from universities around the country who have a one
year fellowship, awarded annually through an open
nationwide competition.
There are also a number of people who have titles as
Hoover fellows, who are resident elsewhere. For the
most part they are not paid by the Institution and are not
engaged in research for Hoover.

Hoover fellows employed in Washington by the Reagan
administration, only one of whom was an active Hoover
scholar before he left, a second was an administrator
and a third, who has worked for many administrations
