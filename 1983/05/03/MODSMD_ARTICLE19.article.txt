## Sakowski singles in winning runs Arizona protests loss 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Arizona's final pitch in Stan
ford's 5-3 win Monday came
from the dugout with two outs
in the bottom of the ninth.
Stanford reliever Jeff Ballard
was shutting down the
Wildcats and easily protecting
the lead that a two-run single
by Vince Sakowski gave Stan
ford in (he sixth inning. After
Pete Stanicek walked and Mike
Aldrete signaled, Sakowski's
single gave the Cardinal a 4-3
lead.
But Arizona coach jerry Kin
dall staged a protest with only
one more batter left, arguing
Stanford had more than the al
lotted 25 players suited up for
the gameâ€”a violation of con
ference bylaws.
Kindall was required to pro
test the game before the final
out and, after he finished, Bal
lard struck out the final batter
for the not-so-certain win.
The win would have rescued
the Cardinal from a three-game
sweep by the Wildcats and a tie
for first with Arizona State, but
the protest will leave the game
in doubt for at least a couple of
weeks. If the protest is upheld,
the game will be replayed.
To be official, the protest
must be filed in writing to the
Pacific-10 office by late this af
ternoon.
Kindall said he noticed the
infraction Friday, but waited to
file it until his team was in
danger of losing.
"When it appeared that we
weren't going to win the game,
I was going to protest," Kindall
said. "I spotted four players (in
uniform) who were not on the
list (hat Mark (Marquess, Stan
ford coach) gave me before the
game.
"I've asked my players to
scratch and dig and claw for
every possible opportunity to
make the playoffs," Kindall said.
"And I'm going to do the

same.
According to conference
rules, a visiting baseball team is
limited to 21 players and the
home team is limited to 25.
Marquess called Kindall's
protest "ridiculous" and said
that coaches violate the rule
more often than not.
"Mr. Kindall is right," Mar
quess said. "We had two or
three extra players. That's
normal policy. That's what we
normally do as a courtesy
among coaches. We let the
kids come out for the game.
"We let each other suit up a
couple of extra players even
though they can't play. I don't
even tell them (the players), I
just make sure I don't use them
in the game."
Marquess also expressed
doubt that the protest would
be upheld. Kindall felt that
Marquess was utilizing players
in three ways.
"I don't like to pick on rules
other than the ones directly in
volving the game," Kindall
said, "but they had at least one
player warming up pitchers in
the bullpen. I recognize the
advantages you get with a large
squad especially with a suppor
tive team like Stanford. They
even used some of the players
to drag the infield."
Marquess said that last year,
Kindall said, "No problem"
when Marquess asked about
dressing more players at Sun
ken Diamond and that Kindall
requested and was granted the
same favor in Tuscon, Ariz. Kin
dall said that if Marquess
would have asked him this
year, he would have said "no".
"Normally, if a coach is really
concerned about it, he'll bring
it up in the first game," Mar
quess said. "But it's never been
a problem. That is something
we should be able to handle as
coaches. That we have to get to
our athletic directors and
Pac-10 officials is ridiculous."

Before the protest clouded
the game's outcome, Stanford
had picked up its first win of
the series on Sakowski's
single, a home run by Greg
Lorenzetti, and superb pitch
ing from starter Steve Cottrell
and Ballard.
Cottrell, now 7-2, pitched
seven innings giving up three
runs on only three hits. Ballard
recorded a save by retiring five
straight batters to end the
game.
Ballard cameon in the eighth
inning with runners on first
and third with one out, but got
pinch-hitter Marcel Bachelier
to fly out to short center field
and Kevin Ward to ground out
to short.
"We had great pitching per
formances all week," Mar
quess said. "Normally that
would be enough to win three
games, but we haven't been
swinging the bat well. I'm real
proud of them. It was a great
big game and you have to give
the guys a lot of credit. They
came back strong."
Lorenzetti opened the scor
ing with a solo home run off
starter Joe Magrane in the sec
ond. Magrane was tagged with
the loss despite giving up only
seven hits in 7 1 /3 innings.
The Cardinal scored an in
surance run in the eighth on a
bunt single by Aldrete and a
three-base throwing error by
third baseman Jack Howell on a
Eric Hardgrave grounder.
Stanford, now 32-13-1 overall
and 15-8 conference if the win
holds up to appeal, clings to a
one-game lead over second
place in Arizona State. USC
hosts Stanford for four games
this weekend, is 2Vi games
back.
Stanford and USC meet in
Los Angeles Friday at 7 p.m.,
Saturday at 1 p.m. and 7 p.m.
and Sunday at 1 p.m.
