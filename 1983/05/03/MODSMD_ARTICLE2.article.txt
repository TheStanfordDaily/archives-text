# Lake Lag drying up, despite rains
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Lake Lagunita may be little more than a puddle by
commencement weekend despite record-setting rains
this spring.
"It's going to be a very low lake. I hate to use the word
dry," said Cheryl lensen, manager of water-technical
services.
Ironically, unusually heavy rains were indirectly re
sponsible for the drying of the lake. The rains caused
hillsides to move in the golf course, breaking the
pipeline used for the past 100 years to carry part of the
San Francisquito Creek runoff to the man-made lake,
according to lensen.
Heavier than usual runoff from the hills near the Dish
filled Lagunita after February landslides had broken the
pipeline. But the lake is losing water faster than it can be
replaced by runoff, as water evaporates rapidly from the
top of the lake and leaks through the lake's unsealed

bottom.
Senior John Nurre, head lifeguard at the lake, said,
"The only thing that's going on is that water is dropping
faster than it has in the past. The dock is getting as low as
it normally gets before they start dredging it."
But he added, "If the weather keeps on being wet, it
might stay somewhat full." The lake still has 11 feet of
water, Nurre said.
The good news: "windsurfing can be carried on in a
pretty shallow lake," Nurre said. The bad news: sailing
will be hurt sooner than windsurfing because boats
need a dock and deeper water.
lensen said, "The hill (in the golf course) is so large
and the movement is so extensive, that it's going to be a
major project to fix it," she added, "It would seem to me
that it ought to be fixed. . . .but it costs a lot of money."
She declined to estimate a dollar amount but said "hun
