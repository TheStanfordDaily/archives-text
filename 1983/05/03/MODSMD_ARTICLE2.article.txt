# Lake Lag drying up, despite rains
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Lake Lagunita may be little more than a puddle by
commencement weekend despite record-setting rains
this spring.
"It's going to be a very low lake. I hate to use the word
dry," said Cheryl lensen, manager of water-technical
services.
Ironically, unusually heavy rains were indirectly re
sponsible for the drying of the lake. The rains caused
hillsides to move in the golf course, breaking the
pipeline used for the past 100 years to carry part of the
San Francisquito Creek runoff to the man-made lake,
according to lensen.
Heavier than usual runoff from the hills near the Dish
filled Lagunita after February landslides had broken the
pipeline. But the lake is losing water faster than it can be
replaced by runoff, as water evaporates rapidly from the
top of the lake and leaks through the lake's unsealed

bottom.
Senior John Nurre, head lifeguard at the lake, said,
"The only thing that's going on is that water is dropping
faster than it has in the past. The dock is getting as low as
it normally gets before they start dredging it."
But he added, "If the weather keeps on being wet, it
might stay somewhat full." The lake still has 11 feet of
water, Nurre said.
The good news: "windsurfing can be carried on in a
pretty shallow lake," Nurre said. The bad news: sailing
will be hurt sooner than windsurfing because boats
need a dock and deeper water.
lensen said, "The hill (in the golf course) is so large
and the movement is so extensive, that it's going to be a
major project to fix it," she added, "It would seem to me
that it ought to be fixed. . . .but it costs a lot of money."
She declined to estimate a dollar amount but said "hun
dreds of thousands."
Donations for the project seem unlikely. "Somehow I
just can't see anyone giving us a lot of money just so we
can say this is somebody's memorial hill," lensen said.
The University is "not going to rename Lake Lag," she
joked.
Wendy Gibson, director of student development,
agreed. She said that a "very slim probability" exists for
getting a gift to fill the lake. But she added, "I wouldn't
say that it would be impossible."
Gibson said, "Every time we look at a gift possibility, we
have to keep in mind that there are a finite number of
donors." She said, "There truly are limited donors
. . . .that (filling the lake) just would not be a terribly
high priority item."
The University will investigate ways to fill the lake
without repairing the pipeline, or by-passing the sec
tion that is broken."

"Sometime during the summer someone's going to
have to make a decision whether to fix that hill and the
flume or whether we figure out another way to fill the
lake," Jensen said.
"It could go down very low so that you're not going to
think of it as a lake by commencement," Jensen said. "I
don't think we're going to get much rain.
"Last year we had the same problem. When the hill
side went out it broke the flume," she said. The pipeline
was patched last year.
On a typical year, water begins to collect in the lake
with the first rain in February. The University keeps it full
using the pipeline until June. In drought years, the lake
cannot be filled. This year, Jensen said, "we had a very
wet year, twice as much rain as normally."
After the lake is drained through the storm drain sys
tem, usually after commencement, it is impossible to
put fresh water in, and so the water becomes stagnant.
The University fills the reservoir annually with water
from the nearby creek. But it empties the lake after
commencement each year to prevent a stagnant breed
ing ground for mosquitos. (San Francisquito Creek is too
lew to provide water for summer filling.)
