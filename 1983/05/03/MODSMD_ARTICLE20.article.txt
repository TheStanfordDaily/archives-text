# Netmen end regular season against Cal
## 
### 
Riding on the wave of two key road
victories over UCLA and USC last
weekend, the men's tennis team will
make its final dual match appearance of
the season at Stanford today at 1:30
p.m. against UC-Berkeley.
The wins over the Los Angeles
schools upped the Cardinal's overall
record to 19-1 — the best in the
nation—and clinched the Pacific-10
championship with the Cal match yet to
be played.
"The Pac-10 title is nice," said head
coach Dick Gould. "But really it's the

NCAAs that matter.
"Now we have to be careful because
we have to have a really good effort
against Cal. And that will hopefully
carry us into the NCAAs" (May 14-22 in
Athens, GA.)
Tomorrow's featured singles match
pits Stanford junior Scott Davis against
Cal's Randy Nixon, who Gould said will
probably be the No. 1 seed at the
NCAAs from the West Coast region.
Davis, still recovering from a mid
season bout with mononucleosis,
played well last weekend in Los

Angeles, winning both his singles
matches against UCLA's Danny Saltz
and USC's Matt Anger in straight sets.
"He's playing better every day,"
Gould said. "But he's not really match
tough yet."
In the last meeting between the two
teams, Stanford defeated the Golden
Bears on their home courts, 7-2. How
ever, the match was infinitely closer
than the score indicates, Gould noted.
Besides Nixon, the Bears feature
senior Doug Stone, junior Mark Wool
ridge and sophomore Harold Hecht.
