More trouble in Baltimore
Baltimore — Less than a week after
selecting disenchanted quarterback John
Elway as the No.l player in the National
Football League draft, the Baltimore Colts
have traded him — for another unhappy
player.
In disposing of Elway, who threatened
to play baseball rather than sign with Bal

timore, the Colts received from Denver
quarterback Mark Herrmann, offensive
tackle Chris Hinton and the Broncos'
No.l draft pick in 1984.
Hinton, Denver's No.l selection and
the N0.4 choice overall in last week's
draft, was reported having second
thoughts about an NFL career.
Dick Lynn, the attorney representing
Hinton, said his client was "crushed" by
the trade, which was announced Monday
night, and would entertain offers from
the Chicago Blitz of the fledgling United
States Football League.
The deal apparently was engineered by
Colts' owner Robert Irsay, whose im
pulsive statements and moves have made
him unpopular in Baltimore, without the
knowledge of Coach Frank Kush or Gen
eral Manager Ernie Accorsi.

Evans' 3-run HR beats A's
Boston — Dwight Evans drilled a three
run homer in the third inning and the
Boston Red Sox wjpnt on to a 3-1 victory
over the Oakland A's last night behind
the six-hit pitching of Dennis Eckersley
and Bob Stanley.
Evans, who hit two homers in a 4-2 vic
tory in Oakland on April 24, lined his
fourth of the season into the screen in
left-center after one-out singles by Glenn
Hoffman and Jerry Remy put runners at
first and third. Evans lined a shot just out
side the right-field foul pole before loft
ing the next pitch over the high wall in
left-center. '
Eckersley, 3-1, made a bid for his third
consecutive shutout over Oakland in
Fenway Park until the A's scored in the
seventh.

Rookie left-hander Bill Krueger, 2-3, al
lowed only seven hits but took the loss on
Evans' homer.
Cey's 3 errors give SF win
San Francisco — Tom O'Malley drove
in two runs for the San Francisco Giants,
who capitalized on four Chicago errors —
three by third baseman Ron Cey — and
beat the Cubs 5-4 last night.
The Giants had only six hits and scored
just one earned run. Steve Trout, 1-5, was
the victim of the fielding breakdown.
Bill Laskey, 2-4, got the victory and Greg
Minton worked 1 2-3 innings for his
fourth save. Laskey had a shutout going
until the eighth inning, when Ryne
Sandberg hit his first home run of the sea
son, Bill Buckner doubled and Cey hit a
run-scoring single.

Lakers win game and series
Inglewood, Calif. — Norm Nixon
scored 21 of his career-high 36 points in a
decisive first half last night as the Los An
geles Lakers topped the Portland Trail
Blazers 116-108 to win their National
Basketball Association Western Con
ference semifinal playoff series.
The defending NBA champion Lakers,
who won the best-of-seven series 4-1, will
face the winner of the San Antonio-Den
ver series for the Western Conference
championship in another best-of-seven
affair starting at the Forum Sunday after
noon or next Tuesday night.
The Spurs lead that series 3-1 with
Game Five scheduled for tonight night at
San Antonio.
