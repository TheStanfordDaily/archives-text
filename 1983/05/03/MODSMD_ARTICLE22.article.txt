### MARK ZEIGLER 
Tim Shaaf and his Stanford
men's golf team do not have to
worry about trying to catch
first-place UCLA in the final
round of the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Golf Championship to
morrow at the Los Angeles
Country Club.
After 54 holes in the four
round tournament, the Bruins
hold a 17-stroke advantage
over second-place USC and a
whopping 52-shot margin over
third-place Stanford.
Paced by Steve Pate's four
under-par 67 yesterday, de
fending champ UCLA had a
54-hole team total of 1105, fol
lowed by USC with 1122, Stan
ford with 1157 and Arizona with
1161.
Pate topped the individual
scoreboard with a three-round

216, two strokes lower than
USC's Sam Randolph, who was
the leader after 36 holes.
Another Bruin golfer, Jay Dels
ing, was in third at 220, while
Arizona State's )im Carter was
fourth at 222.
After 36 holes, UCLA clung
to just a six-shot lead over USC
and a 26-stroke advantage over
Stanford. Cardinal Carl
Wagner was tied for third place
individually at 148—just two
strokes off Randolph's
pace—with UCLA's Delsing.
Stanford lack Skilling was in
ninth at 150.
Also for Stanford after two
rounds, Lew Dickey fired at
157, followed by ]osh Mondry
at 158, Lanny Sawchuck at 160
and Scott Erickson at 166.
I he Cardinal saw its five-shot
lead over tourth-place Arizona

shrink to four yesterday and
the race for third between the
Cardinal and the Wildcats
should shape up to be the
tournament's most exciting.
Stanford will probably re
ceive an invitation to the NCAA
championships June 8-11 at
Fresno if it can remain in third
tomorrow.
The Cardinal won the U.S.
Intercollegiates two weeks
ago, which should be enough
for a bid to the NCAAs. The
Intercollegiates, a tournament
hosted by Stanford, featured
many of the Pac-10 schools, in
cluding USC and UCLA.
One highlight of yesterday's
round was when Oregon's
Brian Castonguay scored a
hole-in-one on the par-3, 15th
hole.



Stanford's Lew Dickey chips out of the rough on the 15th hole
at Stanford Golf Course in a recent tournament. Dickey and
the rest of the men's golf team are in Los Angeles this week for



Artie Streiber/Dail
the Pacific-10 Golf Championships. They are in third place
after three rounds.
