## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Graham Stuart, professor emeritus of political science
and Stanford's second oldest professor, died Friday at
the age of 97 at the Stanford Hospital following surgery.
An authority on diplomacy and international relations,
Stuart joined the Political Science Department in 1923 as
its first international relations expert. He retired in 1952,
and students donated money to furnish the Stuart
Lounge in Building 160 in his honor.
Stuart, an expert on the development and current role
of the U.S. State Department, trained many students for
diplomatic careers; he once counted seven ambas
sadors among his former students.
In 1978, an endowed professorship was established in
Stuart's name by the board of trustees. Political Science
Prof. Alexander George, who presently holds the chair,
said Monday that Stuart "was indeed a pioneer in the
development of the study of international relations and
certainly one of the most successful professors in train
ing people to take important positions in the Foreign
Service. His contribution was as much as in training
people, such as Ambassador Walter Stoessel, as in the
very fine scholarly books he also produced."
Stuart was born in Cleveland in 1886. He earned his
bachelor's degree at Western Reserve University in 1908,
was a student at the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques
in Paris from 1913-14, and returned to the United States
to earn a doctorate in political science at the University
of Wisconsin in 1919. The Western Reserve University
awarded him an honorary degree in 1948.

Stuart served as chief economic analyst of the Board of
Economic Warfare, then headed the State Department's
War History Department until after World War 11.
The professor is survived by his wife of 65 years,
Agnes, and a daughter, Dr. Ann Orloff of La )olla.
Services were held Sunday.
