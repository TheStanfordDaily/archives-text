House committee votes to end
CIA aid to Nicaraguan rebels
Washington — The House Intelligence Committee,
in a blow to President Reagan's Central American pol
icy, voted yesterday to cut off covert aid to rebels
fighting against Nicaragua's leftist government.
The 9-5 vote to eliminate the CIA support was along
party lines, with the panel's Democrats providing the
margin of approval.
Rep. Edward Boland (D-Mass.), committee chair
man, said the committee voted the aid cut-off be
cause it felt that "what we were doing in that area was
counterproductive."
However, Rep. C. Young (R-Fla.), a committee
member, said the vote made it "an exciting day in Ma

nagua for the Sandinistas — a great morale boost."
The bill, which the Reagan administration lobbied
vigorously against, will also be considered by the
House Foreign Affairs Committee and then be voted
on by the full House. The Senate Intelligence Com
mittee was considering a similar proposal.
But while the bill still has a long way to go in Con
gress, Rep. Wyche Fowler (D-Ga.), chairman of the -
House Intelligence subcommittee overseeing CIA
covert actions, said the committee's vote could effec
tively force an end to U.S. support for attacks against
Nicaragua.
The committee, which met for five hours yesterday
behind closed doors, also approved an $80 million
fund to help "friendly" nations in Central America to
interdict weapons going from leftist Nicaragua to
guerrillas in other countries.
Boland said there was "no question that Nicaragua
is in violation of international law" in its alleged sup
port for leftist insurgents in El Salvador. But he added
the committee felt the covert action was not the way
to respond to it.
Quake damages town, spares lives
Coalinga, Calif. — Rescue workers, residents and
government officials yesterday began assessing the
devastation of a major earthquake that rocked this
small community Monday, a devastation that left
many unbelieving but thankful that no lives were re
ported lost.
"It was a disaster and a miracle," said Deran
Koligian, a memberof the Fresno County Board of Su
pervisors. "The disaster was that everything was de
molished. The miracle was there were no fatalities."
In a six-block area of the downtown central district
where damages were estimated ats2s million, 20 to3o
buildings, most of them two-story brick structures,
had either collapsed entirely or had been nearly de
stroyed.
Half the town's 2000 homes were reported dam
aged, 300 of them extensively, by the earthquake,
which measured 6.5 on the Richter scale. Houses
were shifted off their foundations, and front porches
were torn away. Another 700 homes sustained less se
vere but significant damage.
But despite the severity of the quake, which was the
state's biggest since the 1971 San Fernando earth
quake that killed 64 persons, there were only four to
five major injuries reported.
Andropov offers new missile plan
Moscow — Soviet leader Yuri Andropov unveiled a
new proposal yesterday for limiting medium-range
nuclear missiles in Europe, offering to reduce the
number of Soviet warheads to equal those deployed
by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
If the proposal were carried out, Andropov said,
"we would have many fewer medium-range missiles
and warheads on them than before 1976," when the
Soviet Union began producing its sophisticated new
SS-20 missiles, each carrying three nuclear warheads.
The Soviet leader presented the new offer in a
speech at a Kremlin banquet honoring Erich Hon
ecker, the East German Communist Party chief.
Western diplomats said the offer appeared to mark an
important shift in the Soviet bargaining position on
European missiles, but that it contained a number of
ambiguities that made its significance hard to judge
In agreeing to count missile warheads rather than
missiles alone, however, Andropov indicated that the
Soviet Union considered that it was making a signifi
cant concession to the West.
Bishops condemn nuclear policy
Chicago — By overwhelming numbers, the leaders
of the United States' 51 million Roman Catholics
adopted a pastoral letter yesterday that condemns
nuclear weaponry and challenges several of the coun
try's fundamental military strategies.
The historic vote of the National Conference of

Catholic Bishops was 238-9, one that clearly commits
the American Catholic church to work against the
buildup of nuclear arms and for prompt disarma
ment. Adoption of the letter is perhaps the most
prominent instance of the church leadership's
challenging the administration on an issue not prima
rily religious.
The pastoral letter, titled, "The Challenge of Peace:
God's Promise and our Response," does the follow
ing:
— It urges immediate bilateral accords to halt the
testing, production and deployment of new nuclear
weapon systems.
— It declares firm opposition to any first use of nu
clear weapons, even if NATO forces should be over
whelmed by Communist forces in a conventional war.
To counter the threat perceived by the Reagan ad
ministration in Europe, the letter suggests the rapid
development of non-nuclear defensive strategies.
— It questions the use of nuclear weapons even in
retaliation for a nuclear attack, expressing deep skep
ticism about whether a nuclear war can be limited.
— It offers only a "strictly conditional acceptance"
of the U.S. policy of stockpiling arms at deterrent
levels, saying that deterrents can be tolerated only as
long as there is clear progress toward disarmament.
— It condemns the targeting of predominantly ci
vilian targets.
Committee freezes military forces
Washington — The House Armed Services Com
mittee, in the first major congressional decision on
how to reduce President Reagan's defense budget,
yesterday voted to freeze the size of the Army, Navy,
Air Force and Marine Corps at present levels rather
than add 37,300 troops Reagan had requested.
The committee, which historically has been the
most supportive of Pentagon requests, decided in
closed session to hold down manpower rather than
eliminate expensive superweapons when forced to
choose ways to keep 1984 defense spending within
limits being set by the congressional budget process.
Committee sources said Republicans joined Demo
crats in voting overwhelmingly for the manpower
freeze.
Stock market finishes mixed
New York — The stock market finished mixed yes
terday, steadying on the strength of some buying after
the Dow Jones industrial average dipped briefly

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down
about 10 points at midday, closed with a 3.68 gain at

day.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange came to
89.55 million shares, against 88.17 million in the pre
vious session.

God's Promise and our Response," does the follow
ing:
— It urges immediate bilateral accords to halt the
testing, production and deployment of new nuclear
weapon systems.
— It declares firm opposition to any first use of nu
clear weapons, even if NATO forces should be over

To counter the threat perceived by the Reagan ad

— It questions the use of nuclear weapons even in
retaliation for a nuclear attack, expressing deep skep

— It offers only a "strictly conditional acceptance"
of the U.S. policy of stockpiling arms at deterrent
levels, saying that deterrents can be tolerated only as
long as there is clear progress toward disarmament.
— It condemns the targeting of predominantly ci
vilian targets.
Committee freezes military forces
Washington — The House Armed Services Com
mittee, in the first major congressional decision on
how to reduce President Reagan's defense budget,
yesterday voted to freeze the size of the Army, Navy,
Air Force and Marine Corps at present levels rather
than add 37,300 troops Reagan had requested.
The committee, which historically has been the
most supportive of Pentagon requests, decided in
closed session to hold down manpower rather than
eliminate expensive superweapons when forced to
choose ways to keep 1984 defense spending within
limits being set by the congressional budget process.
Committee sources said Republicans joined Demo
crats in voting overwhelmingly for the manpower
freeze.

House committee votes to end
CIA aid to Nicaraguan rebels
Washington — The House Intelligence Committee,
in a blow to President Reagan's Central American pol
icy, voted yesterday to cut off covert aid to rebels
fighting against Nicaragua's leftist government.
The 9-5 vote to eliminate the CIA support was along
party lines, with the panel's Democrats providing the
margin of approval.
Rep. Edward Boland (D-Mass.), committee chair
man, said the committee voted the aid cut-off be
cause it felt that "what we were doing in that area was
counterproductive."
However, Rep. C. Young (R-Fla.), a committee
member, said the vote made it "an exciting day in Ma

nagua for the Sandinistas — a great morale boost."
The bill, which the Reagan administration lobbied
vigorously against, will also be considered by the
House Foreign Affairs Committee and then be voted
on by the full House. The Senate Intelligence Com
mittee was considering a similar proposal.
But while the bill still has a long way to go in Con
gress, Rep. Wyche Fowler (D-Ga.), chairman of the -
House Intelligence subcommittee overseeing CIA
covert actions, said the committee's vote could effec
tively force an end to U.S. support for attacks against
Nicaragua.
The committee, which met for five hours yesterday
behind closed doors, also approved an $80 million
fund to help "friendly" nations in Central America to
interdict weapons going from leftist Nicaragua to
guerrillas in other countries.
Boland said there was "no question that Nicaragua
is in violation of international law" in its alleged sup
port for leftist insurgents in El Salvador. But he added
the committee felt the covert action was not the way
to respond to it.
Quake damages town, spares lives
Coalinga, Calif. — Rescue workers, residents and
government officials yesterday began assessing the
devastation of a major earthquake that rocked this
small community Monday, a devastation that left
many unbelieving but thankful that no lives were re
ported lost.
"It was a disaster and a miracle," said Deran
Koligian, a memberof the Fresno County Board of Su
pervisors. "The disaster was that everything was de
molished. The miracle was there were no fatalities."
In a six-block area of the downtown central district
where damages were estimated ats2s million, 20 to3o
buildings, most of them two-story brick structures,
had either collapsed entirely or had been nearly de
stroyed.
Half the town's 2000 homes were reported dam
aged, 300 of them extensively, by the earthquake,
which measured 6.5 on the Richter scale. Houses
were shifted off their foundations, and front porches
were torn away. Another 700 homes sustained less se
vere but significant damage.
But despite the severity of the quake, which was the
state's biggest since the 1971 San Fernando earth
quake that killed 64 persons, there were only four to
five major injuries reported.
Andropov offers new missile plan
Moscow — Soviet leader Yuri Andropov unveiled a
new proposal yesterday for limiting medium-range
nuclear missiles in Europe, offering to reduce the
number of Soviet warheads to equal those deployed
by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
If the proposal were carried out, Andropov said,
"we would have many fewer medium-range missiles
and warheads on them than before 1976," when the
Soviet Union began producing its sophisticated new
SS-20 missiles, each carrying three nuclear warheads.
The Soviet leader presented the new offer in a
speech at a Kremlin banquet honoring Erich Hon
ecker, the East German Communist Party chief.
Western diplomats said the offer appeared to mark an
important shift in the Soviet bargaining position on
European missiles, but that it contained a number of
ambiguities that made its significance hard to judge
In agreeing to count missile warheads rather than
missiles alone, however, Andropov indicated that the
Soviet Union considered that it was making a signifi
cant concession to the West.
Bishops condemn nuclear policy
Chicago — By overwhelming numbers, the leaders
of the United States' 51 million Roman Catholics
adopted a pastoral letter yesterday that condemns
nuclear weaponry and challenges several of the coun
try's fundamental military strategies.
The historic vote of the National Conference of

Catholic Bishops was 238-9, one that clearly commits
the American Catholic church to work against the
buildup of nuclear arms and for prompt disarma
ment. Adoption of the letter is perhaps the most
prominent instance of the church leadership's
challenging the administration on an issue not prima
rily religious.
