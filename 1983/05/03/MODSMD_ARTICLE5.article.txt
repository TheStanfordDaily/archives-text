# ASSU calls McCloskey remarks 'anti-Semitic'
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted unani
mously last night to "disassociate it
self with, and disclaim any responsi
bility for, (Guest Prof. Paul "Pete")
McCloskey's anti-Semitic remarks,"
citing comments reportedly made by
McCloskey to two newspapers last
month.
The resolution, authored by
graduate senator Jim McGrath, cited
an April 14 Daily article and a June 24
San lose Mercury article. The Mer
cury article reported that "noting
that (Guest Professorship Board
Chairmen Seth) Linfield is Jewish,
McCloskey accused him of acting in
sympathy with the students who
originally tried to block his course.
'It's reverse anti-Semitism, an at
tempt by the Jewish community to
discredit someone who disagrees
with them. . . "
Senator Jerry Wertheim, sponsor
of the resolution, said, "The only re
course in light of these recent state
ments by McCloskey is to again make
clear that we are disassociating our
selves from his statements."
Graduate senator Erik Thompson
originally spoke against the resolu
tion. "Every time we have a guest
professor some problem comes up
and the senate feels compelled to say
that we're disclaiming any connec
tion to it,"he said. "I think that that's
obvious. The senate is not putting
McCloskey up to whatever McClos
key has to say."
Linfield, who was at the meeting,
said the resolution was warranted
because McCloskey's remarks were
not of a nature "we might have ex
pected from the guest professor. I
think it's unfortunate when these
kinds of remarks are published on
the front page of the Daily. I consider
them to be vulgar and repugnant
anti-Semitic remarks." Four other
Guest Professorship Board (GPB)
members who were at the meeting,
concurred with Linfield.
David Marks, a memberof theGPB
who was not at the meeting, said he
was angry because Linfield had not
informed him that the resolution

would come before the senate. "I
was never told what was going on or I
would have been there. Though it
(the resolution) is detrimental to
McCloskey, it is much more detri
mental to the ASSU. The senate's ac
tions will only hurt the possibility of
getting other guest professors. This
is the typical ASSU immature act that
does nothing but hurts everybody.
"If I had been there, I would have
had a chance to explain that there's
no justification for the resolution,"
he said.

The senate also voted unani
mously to finalize the results of last
month's elections. Despite reports
that some fee assessment groups and
senators-elect might be disqualified,
Kurt Zimmerman, elections hearing
commission chairman, said he would
"not recommend any disqualifica
tions."
Zimmerman said the proceedings
of the commission were disrupted
when they were reported to the
Daily. The commission should have
been given "free rein to acquire
necessary information and then carry


James McGrath
through on it without interference,"
he said.
Craig Spearman, elections com
missioner, also faulted the Daily for
its coverage of the election. "It
would help the procedure a lot if the
Daily would not stir up unfounded
conflicts in personality or over issues
involving the elections," he said.
Noting the sparse turnout in the
graduate senate elections, graduate
senator Marian Smith said, "It ap

pears that the ASSU is becoming an
undergraduate organization. I think
we should give serious consideration
to this problem,"
Council of Presidents member
Mark Epstein said that lack of
graduate participation in the ASSU is
not new. The attitudes of graduate
student advisers who belittle student
politics were partly to blame, he said.
Epstein also commented on the
ASSU Recycling plan for next year.
"There are going it be some changes
in the program if it is going to con
tinue. Unless the University comes
through with more funding, we may
not have a program."
