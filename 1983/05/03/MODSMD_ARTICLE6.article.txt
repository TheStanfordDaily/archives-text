# Coalinga quake surprised seismology experts

### PHYLLIS BURTON 
The earthquake that Monday rocked the San
Joaquin Valley town of Coalinga, about 130
miles from here, was "embarrassing," said
Geophysics Prof. Amos Nur. "We seis
mologists like to think that we can at least
predict where an earthquake will occur, if not
when and what magnitude," he said.
The Coalinga quake, with an epicenter in an
area that has never been identified as a major
strand of the San Andreas fault system, is "bad
news for the science of earthquake predic
tion," according to Nur.
Robert Geller, assistant professor of
geophysics and a specialist in seismology, ex
plained that contrary to reports that there are
no known faults in the area of the Coalinga
quake, faults of varying sizes exist over the

entire state, and one undoubtedly exists in
Coalinga for an earthquake with a magnitude
of 6.5 on the Richter Scale to have occurred.
Geller pointed out that the San Andreas, al
though a large and well-known fault, is only
one of many, some of which move only once
every million years or so. He said that on a
geological time-scale, California's 100-200
years of recorded history is a very short time.
As an example he cited the 1971 earthquake
in the San Fernando Valley, which occurred
along a known fault between the San Gabriel
Mountains and the Los Angeles Basin. That
fault had never been known to have moved, so
its potential was not fully appreciated until it
moved with a 6.5 on the Richter Scale.
It is highly improbable that extensive pump

ing of oil from that area had contributed to the
earthquake, as some have speculated, Geller
said. The only way such an event could occur
would be if there already existed a large
build-up of geological stress in the area, he
said.
"Even the largest levels of mechanical strain
that man can create are tiny compared to the
earth's own."
Nur echoed this opinion, and said it is ex
tremely unlikely that removal of oil from the
earth could have caused an earthquake of this
magnitude.
Geller said the Coalinga quake resulted from
a small fault, which is too far away to have any
effect on the earth's movement in the Bay
Area. He said that "earthquakes will undoubt
edly continue to happen unpredictably in the

Bay Area, and that the probabilities have not
increased or decreased due to the quake in
Coalinga."
Nur concurred. The distance within which
an earthquake has an effect on other areas is
approximately the length of the quake, or 10 to
50 miles in this case, he said. Coalinga is 200
miles southeast of San Francisco.
Four civil engineering professors here
travelled to Coalinga yesterday to gather im
mediate data on the tremblor. After returning
from the trip late last night, Civil Engineering
Prof. James Gere said, "Our most dramatic
impression was that in such a badly damaged
city, with collapsed buildings and piles of
bricks everywhere, that no one was killed. In
fact, there were very few serious injuries."


DRY RUN: Despite extremely heavy rainfall this
spring, Lake Lagunita, the traditional site of many
spring quarter activities including sailing, windsurf
ing and Big Way yachting, may be dry by commence-

February damaged a pipe bringing water into the
man-made lake.
