# Coalinga quake surprised seismology experts
## 
### PHYLLIS BURTON 
The earthquake that Monday rocked the San
Joaquin Valley town of Coalinga, about 130
miles from here, was "embarrassing," said
Geophysics Prof. Amos Nur. "We seis
mologists like to think that we can at least
predict where an earthquake will occur, if not
when and what magnitude," he said.
The Coalinga quake, with an epicenter in an
area that has never been identified as a major
strand of the San Andreas fault system, is "bad
news for the science of earthquake predic
tion," according to Nur.
Robert Geller, assistant professor of
geophysics and a specialist in seismology, ex
plained that contrary to reports that there are
no known faults in the area of the Coalinga
quake, faults of varying sizes exist over the

entire state, and one undoubtedly exists in
Coalinga for an earthquake with a magnitude
of 6.5 on the Richter Scale to have occurred.
Geller pointed out that the San Andreas, al
though a large and well-known fault, is only
one of many, some of which move only once
every million years or so. He said that on a
geological time-scale, California's 100-200
years of recorded history is a very short time.
As an example he cited the 1971 earthquake
in the San Fernando Valley, which occurred
along a known fault between the San Gabriel
Mountains and the Los Angeles Basin. That
fault had never been known to have moved, so
its potential was not fully appreciated until it
moved with a 6.5 on the Richter Scale.
It is highly improbable that extensive pump

ing of oil from that area had contributed to the
earthquake, as some have speculated, Geller
said. The only way such an event could occur
would be if there already existed a large
build-up of geological stress in the area, he
said.
"Even the largest levels of mechanical strain
that man can create are tiny compared to the
earth's own."
Nur echoed this opinion, and said it is ex
tremely unlikely that removal of oil from the
earth could have caused an earthquake of this
magnitude.
Geller said the Coalinga quake resulted from
a small fault, which is too far away to have any
effect on the earth's movement in the Bay
Area. He said that "earthquakes will undoubt
edly continue to happen unpredictably in the

Bay Area, and that the probabilities have not
increased or decreased due to the quake in
Coalinga."
Nur concurred. The distance within which
an earthquake has an effect on other areas is
approximately the length of the quake, or 10 to
50 miles in this case, he said. Coalinga is 200
miles southeast of San Francisco.
Four civil engineering professors here
travelled to Coalinga yesterday to gather im
mediate data on the tremblor. After returning
from the trip late last night, Civil Engineering
Prof. James Gere said, "Our most dramatic
impression was that in such a badly damaged
city, with collapsed buildings and piles of
bricks everywhere, that no one was killed. In
fact, there were very few serious injuries."


DRY RUN: Despite extremely heavy rainfall this
spring, Lake Lagunita, the traditional site of many
spring quarter activities including sailing, windsurf
ing and Big Way yachting, may be dry by commence-

Greg Webb/Daily
ment on June 13. A landslide at the golf course in
February damaged a pipe bringing water into the
man-made lake.
The group also included Civil En
gineering Prof. Haresh Shah, Assoc.
Civil Engineering Prof. Helmut
Krawinkler, and Theolore Zsutty, a

consulting professor in civil en
gineering. Shah and Gere are both
directors of Stanford's Blume
Earthquake Engineering Center.

Shah also said he was shocked by
the damage in Coalinga.
"People were sitting outside their
homes not knowing what to do. I
came home feeling very emotionally
drained," he said.
Gere said that 50-60 year-old build
ings, those built before earthquake
standards were in use, suffered the
most damage. Buildings built after
1960 suffered far less damage, some
of it undiscernable without looking
closely. Earthquake standards were
first introduced in the 1930s after the
Long Beach earthquake, and then
upgraded greatly around 1960, he
said.
Regarding Stanford's ability to
withstand a major earthquake, Gere
said, "Undoubtedly some of the
older buildings will have severe
damage, but many of these have
been upgraded to meet seismic
standards. These should hold up
very well."
Shah said the group "looked at
about 125 of the most severely dam
aged buildings. Those built in 19300r
before had totally collapsed. Build
ings built roughly since 1960 had
much less damage."
Forty of the homes were totally de
stroyed, 15 were so damaged that
they need to be bulldozed, 25 could
conceivably be repaired and 40-50
suffered minor damages, he said.
Many homes were thrown off their
foundations, he said, because they
were not originally attached to the
foundations. This is typical of cities

all across California, according to
Shah.
Before the earthquake, he specu
lated, "downtown Coalinga looked
very much as downtown Redwood
City looks today. We could go down
there right now and probably tell you
pretty accurately what would happen
to each building if a quake like that
hit here."
Nur could not speculate on the
damage which would have been
done in the Bay Area by such an
earthquake, but said that one of that
magnitude in a country such as Italy,
Iran or Peru could easily wipe out
half of the local population, due to
the inferior construction of most of
the buildings in those areas. Build
ings of wooden frame or construc
tion "give" the most, and are the
safest, according to Nur. Masonry,
especially brick construction, is the
worst, he said, because there is noth
ing to hold it together in a lateral type
movement such as an earthquake.
Geller, who teaches in the De
partment of Civil Engineering as well
as Geophysics, said small differences
in construction can produce large
differences in seismic safety, and
that building plans need to be strictly
adhered to during construction to
avoid compromising the seismic in
tegrity of 3 structure.
Ironically, many members of the
Geophysics faculty were not at
home, where the action was this
week. They are attending a Geologi
cal Society Association conference in
Salt Lake City.
