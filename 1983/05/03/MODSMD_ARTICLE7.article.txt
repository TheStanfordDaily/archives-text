# Another firm buys cloning rights

<â–  reative Bio Molecules, Inc., by paying a $10,000
licensing fee, became Monday the 69th genetic en
gineering company entitled to use the University's pat
ented DNA cloning methods.
To date, more than $2 million has been derived in
licensing fees alone, said Katherine Ku, who administers
the DNA cloning license for Stanford's Office of
Technology Licensing. In addition to the flat $10,000
licensing fee, the University receives a small percentage
of revenues resulting from all commercial applications
of the licensing techniques. Net proceeds from the
licensing are split between Stanford and the University
of California, said Ku.
lohn Callahan, president of the Brisbane, Calif.-based
Creative Bio Molecules, Inc., said he plans to use the
patented techniques to perform quality control func
tions on chemically-synthesized genes, including those

producing human growth hormone-releasing factor
(hpGRF). According to Callahan, hpGRF is a tool whit h a
company might eventually use to manufacture medica
tion which would trigger the release of a patient's natu
ral growth hormone.
Stanford received its patent on Dec. 2, 1980, giving it
exclusive rights to the basic techniques of gene splicing
and cloning developed by Stanley Cohen, professor of
genetics here and Herbert Boyer, professor of
biochemistry at UC-San Francisco.
By inventing ways to replicate genes that code for
desired traits within micro-organisms, Cohen and Boyer
developed a powerful tool for investigating the organi
zation and function of genes. The techniques also made
possible the construction of "bacterial factories," pro
viding new sources of subst.inces which are very useful
but exceedingly difficult to obtain through normal
routes.
