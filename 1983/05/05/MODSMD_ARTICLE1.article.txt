# Poster protests gay harassment

### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
A poster at the Law School that
asks law students to sign in support
of "free speech" for gays and les
bians in the face of "vandalism and
harassment" has gathered morethan
200 signatures, including that of Law
School Dean John Hart Ely, since it
was put up two days ago.
The poster, written by Jamie Hen
derson, president of the Cay Law
Students Association (CLSA), carried
the signatures of a number of faculty
and staff members, as well as many
students.
Henderson said the poster was put
up in response to the "day-to-day
harassment" by "a few homophobic
people who are personally
threatened by our existence."
The poster, prominently displayed
near student lockers at the Law
School, cited four examples of
harassment of gays there:

•Some posters put up by the GLSA
have been slashed.
•A flier announcing events spon
sored by the GLSA was sent back to
Henderson with "Fuck you, faggot"
written on it.
•Graffiti written outside the GLSA of
fice said "queers are the biggest
child molesters and mass murderers
of all time."
•Graffiti written in the men's bath
room said "fags beware . . . sooner
or later enough people will get sick
and tired of you perverts and we will
bring back a few laws that will stuff
you head first into a water closet."
Henderson, a third-year student,
said gays have been harassed more
often this year than in years past. But
the problem is not any more serious
at the Law School than on the cam
pus as a whole, he said.
Ely said, however, that harassment
of gays at the Law School was "not

that serious. I'm not aware of any real
hostility. A few adolescents are re
sponsible — they think it's funny."
Ely said he signed the poster be
cause he wanted to "support free
dom of speech."
Law Prof. Mark Kelman said he
signed the poster as a "sign of sup
port for the gay students.
"There's a residual anti-gay feel
ing, but it's more or less suppres
sed," Kelman said. "There's more

hostility than gets manifested."
There is "direct evidence that
there are attempts to pressure gay
students, attempts to silence them
and force them back into the closet,"
he said.
The 200 people who signed the
poster represent the "community
reaffirming the legitimacy of being
gay," he added.
Bill Ramos-Saunders, a third-year
law student, said he signed the
poster but "with reservations."
"I agree that attempts to oppress
gay people are wrong, but some
people have valid criticisms of the
association," he said.

Although the CLSA is a "good or
ganization," many people have
"valid religious and moral criticisms
of gays," Ramos-Saunders said.
Margo George, a member of the
GLSA, said the signatures on the
poster represent an "amazing re
sponse.
"People have been very suppor
tive. The poster has served to let
people know what gays here have to
go through. Most people here say (of
the harassment) 'I can't believe this
— this goes on here?' Seeing that
many people sign the poster makes
me feel good about the school,"
George said.
