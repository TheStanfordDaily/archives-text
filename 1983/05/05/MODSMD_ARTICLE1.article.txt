### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
A poster at the Law School that
asks law students to sign in support
of "free speech" for gays and les
bians in the face of "vandalism and
harassment" has gathered morethan
200 signatures, including that of Law
School Dean John Hart Ely, since it
was put up two days ago.
The poster, written by Jamie Hen
derson, president of the Cay Law
Students Association (CLSA), carried
the signatures of a number of faculty
and staff members, as well as many
students.
Henderson said the poster was put
up in response to the "day-to-day
harassment" by "a few homophobic
people who are personally
threatened by our existence."
The poster, prominently displayed
near student lockers at the Law
School, cited four examples of
harassment of gays there:

•Some posters put up by the GLSA
have been slashed.
•A flier announcing events spon
sored by the GLSA was sent back to
Henderson with "Fuck you, faggot"
written on it.
•Graffiti written outside the GLSA of
fice said "queers are the biggest
child molesters and mass murderers
of all time."
•Graffiti written in the men's bath
room said "fags beware . . . sooner
or later enough people will get sick
and tired of you perverts and we will
bring back a few laws that will stuff
you head first into a water closet."
Henderson, a third-year student,
said gays have been harassed more
often this year than in years past. But
the problem is not any more serious
at the Law School than on the cam
pus as a whole, he said.
Ely said, however, that harassment
of gays at the Law School was "not
