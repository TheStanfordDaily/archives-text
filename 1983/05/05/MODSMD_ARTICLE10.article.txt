## The 						Stanford Daily Pets as research animals 
### 
The debate over animal research has taken a
number of twists in recent weeks and no doubt
will continue to do so as a bill prohibiting shel
ters from selling unclaimed animals to re
searchers winds its way through the State Sen
ate.
The bill (number 883) sponsored by Sen.
David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) would force
biomedical researchers to obtain animals from
those who breed the animals specifically for
research use.
To date, the Roberti measure has eased
through the Senate Judiciary Committee and is
awaiting a hearing before the Senate Finance
Committee. Although the bill enjoys strong
support among animal-rights activists, it is
equally opposed by a coalition of universities,
health organizations and medical schools — in
cluding our own Medical Center.
Supporters charge that reform is needed —
that research animals are ill-treated and that
using pounds as a source of research animals
only increases the stray population. Purportedly
people don't want to think about the fate of
animals later turned over for experimentation
so they let them run free.
Untoward treatment of research animals is
reprehensible, but supporters of 883 should
consider an important flaw in the bill. Namely, it
seems unlikely the bill will actually result in
fewer animals suffering. Proponents say the
measure will decrease the incidents of in

humane treatment of animals. Yet the wording
of the bill does not guarantee such an assertion.
To legislatively provide for the additional crea
tion of animal breeding operations would only
serve to multiply cases of animal suffering.
Pound animals are not kept indefinitely. The
choice comes down to killing them (the dogs
and cats) or using them for research. Instead of
putting the animals to sleep the pound sells the
unwanted animal to researchers. Undoubtedly
the research is sometimes unpleasant, but the
animals serve a useful purpose in helping re
searchers learn about organ transplantations,
cancer, heart disease and other disorders.
Still, there should be some provision for con
trol over the fate of animals turned in to shel
ters. There is a second bill entitled the "Pet
Identification and Protection Act" which would
be more appropriate. The bill would give indi
viduals turning in an animal the option of refus
ing to permit the pound to sell the animal to
researchers. The act also requires that research
institutions meet standards of humane treat
ment. In addition, it provides for the establish
ment of a statewide identification system to
help owners locate their lost animals. This
would help protect lost pets from being sold to
researchers or unnecessarily being put to sleep.
Overall, the "Pet Identification and Protection
Act" would be kinder to animals and would help
to eliminate the need for additional research
bred animals.
