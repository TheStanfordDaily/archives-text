# Newest find of Hitler's diaries
## 
### 
The West German magazine Stern
created quite an uproar when it an
nounced that one of its reporters had
found the secret diaries of Adolf Hi
tler buried in a hayloft in East Ger
many. Remarkably, Daily columnist
Steve Mitchel recently discovered
several pages of the historic text
buried in the lingerie department at
Macy's. The following are excerpts
from those pages:
Sept. 26,1899—First day of school.
I hate it. All the kids laughed at me
just because I'm the only boy in the
4th grade who has a mustache. My
teacher, Fraulein Baconburger, must
be destroyed. She had the nerve to
tell me not to bring my pistol to class
anymore!
Feb. 18 and 19, 1899—Very de
pressed. Brought home my report
card—straight Fs. Father was furi
ous. . . .he beat me with a frying pan
and locked me in the closet over
night. Didn't go to school today.
Tried to cheer up: tortured a little
squirrel with my pocket knife, read
the Sunday obituaries. . . .I felt a lit
tle better.
March 3, 1899—Brought Fraulein
Baconburger an apple with a razor
blade inside. She said she had a big
breakfast and wasn't hungry. Damn!
She gave the apple to a poor girl, who
had no lunch. At least I didn't go toall

that trouble for nothing. Fat kid in
the corner shot a spitball at me. I got
even. . . .lobbed a grenade into his
desk.
April 2, 1905—Tried out for the
soccer team. Coach said I was too
short, too slow and too ugly. Shot
him. Wanted my jersey to have the
number "one" on the back. Captain
said that was his number. Shot him.
Old lady on bus asked if she could
take my seat. Shot her. Sister bor
rowed my radio. Shot her. Shot
mailman, shot dog, shot car, shot
tree, shot tube of toothpaste. . . .
May 4,1905 —Homecoming soccer
game. We won, thanks to my ingeni
ous, heroic and daring efforts in the
final period. We were losing eight to
nothing. Time was runningout. I had
to act quickly. I ordered a tactical
airstrike directly over the enemy
goal. They were wiped out in a matter
of seconds. I kicked that little ball
into the empty net over and over and
over. . . .we won, 146 to 8. We cele
brated by getting drunk and storm
ing an orphanage.
May 27, 1906—Must get a date for
the junior prom. Asked Helga Lus
tenbrau. She said she was already
going with that parasite, Wolfgang
von Horsch. Great! I'll finally get to try
out my new buzz saw. . . .Let's see

howwell he dances withoutany legs!
Thought about taking up yodeling.
I'm not sure why.
Oct. 2, 1906—Launched my cam
paign for student body president to
day. Can't decide which slogan is
more effective—should it be, "Vote
Hitler. . . .or die" or "What me
worry?" Had some time to kill this
afternoon, so I hung around the
emergency room at the county hos
pital. It was lots of fun. Maybe tomor
row I'll go to the morgue.
Jan. 7,1907 —I must decide what to
do with the rest of my life. Today, I
mailed my application to the Univer
sity. Stupid essay questions wanted
me to pick the adjective that best de
scribes myself. . . .I put "cuddly." I
don't care. I don't even want to go to
school anymore. I want to be an ar
tist. But mother wants me to pursue
my dictating. "Adolph," she says,
"we've never had a dictator in the
family before. Now, wash up for din
ner, and let your brother out of that
suitcase."
June 2, 1907—Class awards were
announced today. I was voted "Most
Likely to Rearrange the Furniture in a
Blind Person's Home."
