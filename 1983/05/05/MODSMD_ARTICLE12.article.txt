## Correcting misconceptions of frats 
### 
I woulJ like to clear up a few misconceptions that
were at least implicit in Cathy Janus' article on frater
nities and sororities ("To some they provide friends, to
others, stereotypes," Daily, April 25).
Preposterous best describes many of the statements
made by Phi Delta Theta rush chairman Michael Hood.
Hood need only look to the members of his own house
or the members of any other fraternity to find a number
of "more studious" people — the type of people he
claims "probably aren't up here (at the Phi Delts) rushing."
My experience in both the fraternity system and the
University housing system indicates that an equal pro
portion of "studious" individuals live in fraternities as in
University housing. Hood misrepresents his own frater
nity as well as other fraternities by claiming that "studi
ous" individuals don't rush fraternities.
Hood's claim that only "those who like the social
scene" rush fraternities is more ludicrous. If the social
scene to which Hood refers is the all-male social scene
then perhaps he is correct; however, if he speaks in
terms of a social life including women, I suggest that he
compare the quality of male-female interaction at such a
social function as dinner at the Phi Delts with male
female interaction at dinner in a coed residence.
If Hood ventures beyond the confines of his own
fraternity, he might find a social life that is every bit as
active as fraternity social life but without the financial,
moral, or time sacrifices that fraternities can demand. I
have found social life outside of a fraternity far more
rewarding than anything I experienced during the year I
spent as a fraternity member.
Perhaps Hood did not articulate his feelings as he
intended, but another theme which cannot be defended
on the basis of poor articulation is evident throughout
lanus' article. In my four years at Stanford I have heard
from fraternity and sorority members that the Creek
selection process does not involve explicit "standards."
The existence of explicit standards is irrelevant. People
join fraternities or sororities in order to establish friend
ships with others possessing similar interests and de
sires. In this way, fraternity and sorority members are
self-selec ted to fit into a pre-existing group. Those not
sharing similar interests and desires do not join or they
dropout when they find themselves uncomfortable with
the activities of the organization.

Given this fact, how can fraternities and sororities
claim that one cannot validly characterize a group iden
tity for their organization? I do not doubt that individual
variation exists within fraternities and sororities, but that
does not say that a group identity does not exist. Deny
ing the existence of common group traits denies the
presence of common group interests and desires that
are the strength of any fraternity or sorority.
I believe that the denial of a "group consciousness" by
fraternity members and their friends is partially a means
of avoiding personal responsibility for acts or attitudes
that are a part of many fraternity activities. I find this easy
to fall into myself. Of the friends of mine who live in
fraternities, I would prefer not to know that one of them
forced a pledge to drink a Milk of Magnesia screwdriver,
or forced a pledge to stand out in the rain with only a
pillowcase shoved over his head.
For that matter, I prefer not to know that many partici
pate in organizing activities such as female mud
wrestling displays or freshman firesides. If I attempt to
blame the individuals I know for such activities, I experi
ence only dissonance. The people I know as individuals
could not play a role in such obviously objectionable
activities. Yet those activities still occur, and it is illogical
for me or anyone else not to hold every member ot a
fraternity responsible for them.
I am tired of hearing people using "nice individual"
arguments to direct blame for reprehensible activities
from the few "nice-guys" they know to some unknown
individual or group of individuals who formulate such
activities and carry them out. Let fraternities be de
fended on the grounds that they provide an atmosphere
of group activity and common interests, but do not claim
that individual fraternity members do not have full re
sponsibility for the activities and attitudes sponsored by
the fraternity as a whole. In joining a fraternity the indi
vidual has agreed to participate and be responsible for
activities which the group sponsors. If fraternity mem
bers object to the group characteristics which they
exhibit, they have only themselves to blame for not
speaking out against objectionable activities and refus
ing to participate.

on the basis of poor articulation is evident throughout
lanus' article. In my four years at Stanford I have heard
from fraternity and sorority members that the Creek
selection process does not involve explicit "standards."
The existence of explicit standards is irrelevant. People
join fraternities or sororities in order to establish friend
ships with others possessing similar interests and de
sires. In this way, fraternity and sorority members are
self-selec ted to fit into a pre-existing group. Those not
sharing similar interests and desires do not join or they
dropout when they find themselves uncomfortable with
the activities of the organization.

Given this fact, how can fraternities and sororities
claim that one cannot validly characterize a group iden
tity for their organization? I do not doubt that individual
variation exists within fraternities and sororities, but that
does not say that a group identity does not exist. Deny
ing the existence of common group traits denies the
presence of common group interests and desires that
are the strength of any fraternity or sorority.
I believe that the denial of a "group consciousness" by
fraternity members and their friends is partially a means
of avoiding personal responsibility for acts or attitudes
that are a part of many fraternity activities. I find this easy
to fall into myself. Of the friends of mine who live in
fraternities, I would prefer not to know that one of them
forced a pledge to drink a Milk of Magnesia screwdriver,
or forced a pledge to stand out in the rain with only a
pillowcase shoved over his head.
For that matter, I prefer not to know that many partici
pate in organizing activities such as female mud
wrestling displays or freshman firesides. If I attempt to
blame the individuals I know for such activities, I experi
ence only dissonance. The people I know as individuals
could not play a role in such obviously objectionable
activities. Yet those activities still occur, and it is illogical
for me or anyone else not to hold every member ot a
fraternity responsible for them.
I am tired of hearing people using "nice individual"
arguments to direct blame for reprehensible activities
from the few "nice-guys" they know to some unknown
individual or group of individuals who formulate such
activities and carry them out. Let fraternities be de
fended on the grounds that they provide an atmosphere
of group activity and common interests, but do not claim
that individual fraternity members do not have full re
sponsibility for the activities and attitudes sponsored by
the fraternity as a whole. In joining a fraternity the indi
vidual has agreed to participate and be responsible for
activities which the group sponsors. If fraternity mem
bers object to the group characteristics which they
exhibit, they have only themselves to blame for not
speaking out against objectionable activities and refus
ing to participate.
