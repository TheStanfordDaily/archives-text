## Long history of intervention 
### 
Several Central American countries share the features
that gave rise to the North American label of "Banana
Republics." Although not all of these countries grow
bananas, Nicaragua, Fl Salvador, Guatemala and Hon
duras all suffer from extraordinary economic depend
ence on the export of a few crops that include cotton,
coffee and sugar. They all have historically been domi
nated by oligarchies made up of a few families that
control the land and the export trade. Furthermore, in
this century they all share a history of popular revolt only
to be followed by repression, military rule and U.S.
intervention.
The living conditions of the peasant majority are the
most inequitable on the Latin American mainland, with
many people living below subsistence levels. In
Guatemala, for example, 1 percent of the population
owns 80 percent of the land, and the top 5 percent of the
population receives more than a third of the national
income.
Honduras is perhaps the poorest country in Central
America, and indeed one of the most poverty-stricken
nations in the world. El Salvador, the most densely popu
lated country in the Western Hemisphere, has a birth
rate so high that its population will double in 20years. All
of these countries, with the exception of Nicaragua
since its revolution, share similar proportions of land
distribution, high infant mortality and extreme malnutri
tion, reflecting the worse than abject conditions under
which Latinos in this region live and die.
The political systems of these countries have been
historically unstable, brutally oppressive and designed
to maintain the oligarchical status quo. The latter part of
the 19th century saw a new wave of plunder and exploi
tation with the creation of monoculture export crop
economies in Central America. The preconditions of this
agribusiness development were the dispossession of
the Indian peasantry of its land and the consequent
exploitation of its labor in commercial agriculture. Law
and political power acted jointly with oligarchies com
posed of a few families to seize the most fertile farmland,
reduce their former owners to laborers, and convert
production from subsistence cash crops destined for
sale to the United States and otherdeveloped countries.
The outbreak of the Great Depression brought a
plunge in coffee prices, leading to a period of economic
chaos and social upheaval throughout the region. The
year 1932 saw the first communist-led peasant uprising
(without Soviet involvement) in this hemisphere in El
Salvador. The uprising was crushed by the National
Guard in a massacre of some 30,000 peasants, or 4 per
cent of the population at that time. El Salvador has been
continuously under military rule since then — the
longest period of military rule in all of Latin America.
This was also the era of the first dramatic Sandinista
rebellion in Nicaragua. U.S. Marines invaded and oc
cupied Nicaragua for the second time in the period of
1926-33. The Nicaraguan patriot Augusto Cesar Sandino
led a peasant-based guerrilla struggle against the U.S.
forces that becamea revolutionary movement dedicated
to the social transformation of Nicaragua. The United
States, unable to defeat the Sandinista rebellion, or-

ganized the Nicaraguan National Guard under Anastasio
Somoza Sr. After the withdrawal of U.S. forces, this
National Guard overthrew the civilian government and
assassinated Sandino. Somoza went on to establish him
self and his family as the absolute political authority in
Nicaragua until the triumph of the resurgent Sandinista
movement in 1979.
In Guatemala, U.S. intervention took a different form
that was to strike a new pattern in the post-World War II
era. Shaken by the social upheavals, Guatemala entered
into a period of progressive reform in 1945. The
Eisenhower administration came to power at the height
of the Cold War and McCarthyite hysteria in 1952-53.
This administration orchestrated an anti-Guatemala
campaign carried out largely by the United Fruit Com
pany — the major U.S. multinational corporation in
Central America. The government-directed propaganda
campaign charged that the elected Arbenz regime in
Guatema was bringing "communism" into the hemis
phere. It reached major U.S. publications, the Con
gress, universities and churches.
The Eisenhower regime authorized the CIA to or
ganize the covert destabilization and overthrow of the
Arbenz government. The CIA staged a military coup
backed up with an invasion by exiles and mercenaries.
Guatemala has since remained under military rule,
marked by a period of intense repression and counterin
surgency campaigns against guerrilla activity in close
cooperation with the United States.
The years following the Eisenhower era were a period
of political polarization for Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras. These countries experienced
institutionalization of repressive, military rule on the
one hand, and the rejuvenation and consolidation of
revolutionary forces on the other. The present escala
tion of violence and popular resistance are not new or
sudden phenomena. Rather, they are the result of an
intricate history involving internal disruptions
(monoculture economies, peasant exploitation and
oligarchical rule) and external pressures (U.S. interven
tion).
Today, the violence and repression of oligarchic and
military rule continues in El Salvador. The current U.S.
intervention and CIA activity are not new to the region.
They are part of a long-standing policy that resorts to
military alternatives. The conflicts in Central America
have become increasingly intensified and regionalized
during the Reagan administration, a policy articulated by
Secretary of State George Shultz. As Stanford students,
the foreign policy Shultz promotes should provoke us:
He is an elected representative's (Reagan's) chief
spokesperson on U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, he is
a member of the faculty in the Stanford Business School
and, more directly, he is the selected speaker for the
1983 commencement. Shultz' ties to this University, the
policy he represents and our status as Stanford students
leaves us no option but to take a stand on the policy he
espouses and on U.S. intervention in Central America.

ganized the Nicaraguan National Guard under Anastasio
Somoza Sr. After the withdrawal of U.S. forces, this
National Guard overthrew the civilian government and
assassinated Sandino. Somoza went on to establish him
self and his family as the absolute political authority in
Nicaragua until the triumph of the resurgent Sandinista
movement in 1979.
In Guatemala, U.S. intervention took a different form
that was to strike a new pattern in the post-World War II
era. Shaken by the social upheavals, Guatemala entered
into a period of progressive reform in 1945. The
Eisenhower administration came to power at the height
of the Cold War and McCarthyite hysteria in 1952-53.
This administration orchestrated an anti-Guatemala
campaign carried out largely by the United Fruit Com
pany — the major U.S. multinational corporation in
Central America. The government-directed propaganda
campaign charged that the elected Arbenz regime in
Guatema was bringing "communism" into the hemis
phere. It reached major U.S. publications, the Con
gress, universities and churches.
The Eisenhower regime authorized the CIA to or
ganize the covert destabilization and overthrow of the
Arbenz government. The CIA staged a military coup
backed up with an invasion by exiles and mercenaries.
Guatemala has since remained under military rule,
marked by a period of intense repression and counterin
surgency campaigns against guerrilla activity in close
cooperation with the United States.
The years following the Eisenhower era were a period
of political polarization for Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras. These countries experienced
institutionalization of repressive, military rule on the
one hand, and the rejuvenation and consolidation of
revolutionary forces on the other. The present escala
tion of violence and popular resistance are not new or
sudden phenomena. Rather, they are the result of an
intricate history involving internal disruptions
(monoculture economies, peasant exploitation and
oligarchical rule) and external pressures (U.S. interven
tion).
Today, the violence and repression of oligarchic and
military rule continues in El Salvador. The current U.S.
intervention and CIA activity are not new to the region.
They are part of a long-standing policy that resorts to
military alternatives. The conflicts in Central America
have become increasingly intensified and regionalized
during the Reagan administration, a policy articulated by
Secretary of State George Shultz. As Stanford students,
the foreign policy Shultz promotes should provoke us:
He is an elected representative's (Reagan's) chief
spokesperson on U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, he is
a member of the faculty in the Stanford Business School
and, more directly, he is the selected speaker for the
1983 commencement. Shultz' ties to this University, the
policy he represents and our status as Stanford students
leaves us no option but to take a stand on the policy he
espouses and on U.S. intervention in Central America.

Several Central American countries share the features
that gave rise to the North American label of "Banana
Republics." Although not all of these countries grow
bananas, Nicaragua, Fl Salvador, Guatemala and Hon
duras all suffer from extraordinary economic depend
ence on the export of a few crops that include cotton,
coffee and sugar. They all have historically been domi
nated by oligarchies made up of a few families that
control the land and the export trade. Furthermore, in
this century they all share a history of popular revolt only
to be followed by repression, military rule and U.S.
intervention.
The living conditions of the peasant majority are the
most inequitable on the Latin American mainland, with
many people living below subsistence levels. In
Guatemala, for example, 1 percent of the population
owns 80 percent of the land, and the top 5 percent of the
population receives more than a third of the national
income.
Honduras is perhaps the poorest country in Central
America, and indeed one of the most poverty-stricken
nations in the world. El Salvador, the most densely popu
lated country in the Western Hemisphere, has a birth
rate so high that its population will double in 20years. All
of these countries, with the exception of Nicaragua
since its revolution, share similar proportions of land
distribution, high infant mortality and extreme malnutri
tion, reflecting the worse than abject conditions under
which Latinos in this region live and die.
The political systems of these countries have been
historically unstable, brutally oppressive and designed
to maintain the oligarchical status quo. The latter part of
the 19th century saw a new wave of plunder and exploi
tation with the creation of monoculture export crop
economies in Central America. The preconditions of this
agribusiness development were the dispossession of
the Indian peasantry of its land and the consequent
exploitation of its labor in commercial agriculture. Law
and political power acted jointly with oligarchies com
posed of a few families to seize the most fertile farmland,
reduce their former owners to laborers, and convert
production from subsistence cash crops destined for
sale to the United States and otherdeveloped countries.
The outbreak of the Great Depression brought a
plunge in coffee prices, leading to a period of economic
chaos and social upheaval throughout the region. The
year 1932 saw the first communist-led peasant uprising
(without Soviet involvement) in this hemisphere in El
Salvador. The uprising was crushed by the National
Guard in a massacre of some 30,000 peasants, or 4 per
cent of the population at that time. El Salvador has been
continuously under military rule since then — the
longest period of military rule in all of Latin America.
This was also the era of the first dramatic Sandinista
rebellion in Nicaragua. U.S. Marines invaded and oc
cupied Nicaragua for the second time in the period of
1926-33. The Nicaraguan patriot Augusto Cesar Sandino
led a peasant-based guerrilla struggle against the U.S.
forces that becamea revolutionary movement dedicated
to the social transformation of Nicaragua. The United
States, unable to defeat the Sandinista rebellion, or-

ganized the Nicaraguan National Guard under Anastasio
Somoza Sr. After the withdrawal of U.S. forces, this
National Guard overthrew the civilian government and
