Political balance
I have been following the Daily's
coverage of charges that, academi
cally, the Hoover Institution is politi
cally unbalanced. It is hard to know
what standard of balance one should
use; but if the general mood of the
country is the standard, it is hard to
say that the Hoover Institution is
more unbalanced to the right than
the rest of the University is to the left.
Further, as far as overall compe
tence is concerned, it is clear to me
that, on the merits, some people at
Hoover could not be hired by the
appropriate Stanford departments,
while there are people in relevant
Stanford departments who are not
competent enough scholars to be
hired by Hoover. It is not by any
means clear to me where the overall
advantage in competence lies, and it
seems to me that we should know
this, lest we be accused of beholding
the mote that is in our brother's eye
while considering not the beam in
our own.
