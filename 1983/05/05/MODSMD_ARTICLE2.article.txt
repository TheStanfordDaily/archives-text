# Lipset, Manley explain Hoover individual/institution dichotomy
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
The current controversy surrounding the
Hoover Institution and its role at the Univer
sity has come down to a matter of defini
tions, according to many people involved.
Hoover scholars, Hoover administrators and
faculty members concerned have voiced a
variety of opinions, depending upon their
interpretations of how an "institution" as
such takes political stands.
Charges against Hoover maintain that the
Institution has a dominant political thrust.
Recent petitions signed by 69 faculty mem
bers and more than 1400 students question
whether Hoover has "generally conservative
leanings" — based on claims that Hoover
scholars are often hired because of their
conservative views and the Institution's ties
to the Reagan administration — and if so,
whether the University is being brought into
"partisan politics."
Hoover reaction to the controversy has

varied considerably, especially among its
scholars. Seymour Martin Lipset, a senior
fellow at Hoover and a professor of political
science and sociology here, said yesterday
that the political thrust of an institution must
be defined in terms of "the individuals com
prising the Institution "and on their "diverse
backgrounds and interests."

News analysis

In a letter printed in the Daily yesterday,
Lipset analyzed the "core group of scholars"
at Hoover — 25 senior and senior research
fellows — by political affiliation. He con
cluded that of the resident scholars, 11 were
Democrats and 10 were Republicans. Three
others described themselves as indepen
dents and one was not an American citizen.
In explanation of his statistical interpreta
tion, Lipset said, "the point is how one de
fines one's terms when speaking of the

'political thrust' of an institution . . . Hoover
is a research institution comprised of indi
viduals of diverse backgrounds and interests
— some are policy makers and some are
not," he said.
By contrast, Political Science Prof. John
Manley said the issue is not "how many
Democrats and Republicans there are at
Hoover." Manley contends, rather, that the
central question should be whether Hoover
"as an organization" is involved in "political
partisan activity," and whether Hoover "as
an institution" represents "dispropor
tionately ... a particular view."
"We've tried to call attention to Hoover's
1982 Annual Reports," he said, "in an effort
to get the Stanford community to assess for
itself whether Hoover i> .nvolved in partisan
political activity.''
Manley's references are to sections of the
report highlighting Hoover's ties to the cur
rent administration, namely, Hoover Di

rector W. Glenn Campbell's statement that
"a major strength of the Institution" is its
link to the University because "scholars can
thereby conduct their analyses of major pol
icy issues and provide their views of the
legislative and executive branches of gov
ernment" from the Institution, he said.
Manley also points out comments by Pres
ident Reagan in 1981 given at a winter meet
ing of the Institution's Board of Overseers.
According to the report, Reagan said that he
had "called on more people from the Institu
tion" to help with his campaign than from
any other institution.
Reagan also quotes an excerpt from the
New York Times Magazine, in 1978, calling
the Institution "the brightest star in a small
constellation of conservative think
tanks. . .
Manley contends that there is "enough
evidence in the report" to present a "prima
facie case" of a problem. "I expect the pro

posed inquiry to spread the real facts on the
table," he said.
Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at
Hoover, said, "The Institution as such has
never, to my knowledge, taken any political
position. . . . There is no more a Hoover
position on any issue than a department of
political science position," he said.
"The idea that a group of people at the
University are making policy for the current
administration is absurd on its face value,"
Anderson said. "It is true that research is
conducted at Hoover" which is sub
sequently used by the administration, and
that advice is sought from the scholars at
Hoover, he said. At the same time, Anderson
said, "one of the traditional things
academics do is get involved in public ser
vice," referring to University President
Donald Kennedy's position as commissioner
of the Food and Drug Administration.
President of the American Associa
tion of Universities Robert
Rosenzweig, former vice-president
for Public Affairs, said in the Penin
sula Times Tribune yesterday that
scholars at Hoover "made a mistake
in boasting of their connection" with
the Reagan administration. "I never
thought that was wise, and I thought
it was exaggerated," he said. "Some
of the connections were so remote
they were not real."
It is true that many Hoover schol
ars are conservative thinkers,
Rosenzweig said, but that is partly

because of "self-selection," where
persons with "like intellectual styles
are more comfortable with each
other."
The Institution's conservative bent
is not enough reason to "sever the
Institution from the University,"
Rosenzweig said. Hoover is a major
asset to the University and its ties
should be strengthened, not cut, he
said.
Rosenzweig could not be reached
for further comment yesterday.
Director Campbell said he is "a
very busy man" and has "not had
time to read any of the articles" con

cerning Hoover and its relationship
to the University. After declining
comment, Campbell said he "does
not reply to character assassination
charges."
Richard Burress, associate director
and senior fellow at Hoover, said, "I
haven't had time to follow the
series." However, he said the
charges made by some faculty mem
bers and students against Hoover are
"completely immaterial and un
founded." Burress refused to com
ment further.
John Moore, associate director
and senior fellow at Hoover, also re
fused to comment.

"The idea that a group of people at the

Anderson said. "It is true that research is

Hoover, he said. At the same time, Anderson
said, "one of the traditional things
academics do is get involved in public ser

Donald Kennedy's position as commissioner
of the Food and Drug Administration.
President of the American Associa
tion of Universities Robert
Rosenzweig, former vice-president
for Public Affairs, said in the Penin
sula Times Tribune yesterday that
scholars at Hoover "made a mistake
in boasting of their connection" with
the Reagan administration. "I never
thought that was wise, and I thought
it was exaggerated," he said. "Some
of the connections were so remote
they were not real."
It is true that many Hoover schol
ars are conservative thinkers,
Rosenzweig said, but that is partly

because of "self-selection," where
persons with "like intellectual styles
are more comfortable with each
other."
The Institution's conservative bent
is not enough reason to "sever the
Institution from the University,"
Rosenzweig said. Hoover is a major
asset to the University and its ties
should be strengthened, not cut, he
said.
Rosenzweig could not be reached
for further comment yesterday.
Director Campbell said he is "a
very busy man" and has "not had
time to read any of the articles" con

cerning Hoover and its relationship
to the University. After declining
comment, Campbell said he "does
not reply to character assassination
charges."
Richard Burress, associate director
and senior fellow at Hoover, said, "I
haven't had time to follow the
series." However, he said the
charges made by some faculty mem

"completely immaterial and un
founded." Burress refused to com
ment further.
John Moore, associate director

The current controversy surrounding the
Hoover Institution and its role at the Univer
sity has come down to a matter of defini
tions, according to many people involved.
Hoover scholars, Hoover administrators and
faculty members concerned have voiced a
variety of opinions, depending upon their
interpretations of how an "institution" as
such takes political stands.
Charges against Hoover maintain that the
Institution has a dominant political thrust.
Recent petitions signed by 69 faculty mem
bers and more than 1400 students question
whether Hoover has "generally conservative
leanings" — based on claims that Hoover
scholars are often hired because of their
conservative views and the Institution's ties
to the Reagan administration — and if so,
whether the University is being brought into
"partisan politics."
Hoover reaction to the controversy has

varied considerably, especially among its
scholars. Seymour Martin Lipset, a senior
fellow at Hoover and a professor of political
science and sociology here, said yesterday
that the political thrust of an institution must
be defined in terms of "the individuals com
prising the Institution "and on their "diverse
backgrounds and interests."

News analysis

In a letter printed in the Daily yesterday,
Lipset analyzed the "core group of scholars"
at Hoover — 25 senior and senior research
fellows — by political affiliation. He con
cluded that of the resident scholars, 11 were
Democrats and 10 were Republicans. Three
others described themselves as indepen
dents and one was not an American citizen.
In explanation of his statistical interpreta
tion, Lipset said, "the point is how one de
fines one's terms when speaking of the

'political thrust' of an institution . . . Hoover
is a research institution comprised of indi
viduals of diverse backgrounds and interests
— some are policy makers and some are
not," he said.
By contrast, Political Science Prof. John
Manley said the issue is not "how many
Democrats and Republicans there are at
Hoover." Manley contends, rather, that the
central question should be whether Hoover
"as an organization" is involved in "political
partisan activity," and whether Hoover "as
an institution" represents "dispropor
tionately ... a particular view."
"We've tried to call attention to Hoover's
1982 Annual Reports," he said, "in an effort
to get the Stanford community to assess for
itself whether Hoover i> .nvolved in partisan
political activity.''
Manley's references are to sections of the
report highlighting Hoover's ties to the cur
rent administration, namely, Hoover Di

rector W. Glenn Campbell's statement that
"a major strength of the Institution" is its
link to the University because "scholars can
thereby conduct their analyses of major pol
icy issues and provide their views of the
legislative and executive branches of gov
ernment" from the Institution, he said.
Manley also points out comments by Pres
ident Reagan in 1981 given at a winter meet
ing of the Institution's Board of Overseers.
According to the report, Reagan said that he
had "called on more people from the Institu
tion" to help with his campaign than from
any other institution.
Reagan also quotes an excerpt from the
New York Times Magazine, in 1978, calling
the Institution "the brightest star in a small
constellation of conservative think
tanks. . .
Manley contends that there is "enough
evidence in the report" to present a "prima
