The Ramones
Ifeystone/Palo Alto

■Watching journey in concert can be mildly
entertaining. Watching Cheap Trick can be
stimulating. Watching the Who is quite an
occasion. But seeing the Ramones on stage
is an experience.
■ Yes, it's not every place that can hold
fright-wigged new wavers, leather-clad
street bums, bearded and beer gutted
middle-aged men and even a few studious
Stanford types like ourselves without reach
ing critical mass and imploding.
pi But such is what happened Thursday night
at the Keystone in Palo Alto, when the
Ramones rocked a motley crowd of several
hundred very enthusiastic fans.
W We'd never been to the Keystone before,
and we were pleasantly surprised to find a
large-sized club. Most of the seats are close
to the stage, but there's still enough room
for a spacious dance floor up front. And the
high arched ceiling transforms the Keystone
into a perfect place for enjoying the acousti
cal delights which were fed to us by the
Ramones at maximum volume.
||So there we were, sitting between the
man-of-a-thousand pounds and the sexy
young woman in the net top. It was during
this appraisal of these yin-yang surround
ings that the first warm-up band, the High
Hitters, tested the waters with their San
Francisco new wave.
j The waters were not warm. The lead sing
er's choreographed punk rock antics were
amusing but obviously rehearsed, and the
rest of the band showed no emotion what
soever. Appropriately, they played "I've Got
Problems, Man" which aptly summarizes
their performance. Their set droned on
through monotonous songs like "Sex is a
Trick" for about 50 minutes, violating what
Terry calls his "five songs plus-or-minus one
rule" for non-headliners. And aftera rousing
round of silence when they momentarily left
the stage, the High Hitters inflicted one last
epic song before slinking out of sight for
good.
The second band, the Lifters, was deriva
tive of New York City, like the Ramones
themselves. We disagreed on this group.

Terry felt this band was more interesting;
Kevin thought the Lifters didn't come close
to pulling their weight.
With a bottlenecking guitarist, a chord
playing bassist and a singer who looks as
though somebody dragged him from his
cave too early in the evening, any band
would have to be interesting. The songs,
too, were reasonably well-constructed, but
the trouble was that they all sounded the
same. Some versatility is lost when the
guitarist seems to be playing from a vantage

point on Mount Olympus, with chords ex
calating down from on high. The singer
might be heard better if he was playing on
the same planet as the rest of us. All in all,
though, the band was rather innocuous; not
unlike a metropolitan pigeon.
"Totally awesome." "Excellent." "Like
wow." These San Fernando Valley phrases
might be good descriptions of a Kiss con
cert, but are completely inappropriate for
the Ramones. If anything, this concert
proved that the Ramones are outstanding,

for they clearly stand out from the crowd of
their contemporaries in rock music.
Unlike the Dead Kennedys, they don't
write lyrics which lash out at Anita Bryant
and the Moral Majority. And unlike
Foreigner, they don't need to blow up giant
)uke boxes to create excitement at their con
certs. The excitement is inherent in their
music, which caused fans to wildly scream
"Hey-ho, let's go!" before they make their
entrance.
It was to this chant that the Ramones took
the stage, at approximately 11:20 p.m., and
they didn't leave until IV2 hours and two
encores later. We found that the number of
songs that the Ramones can pump into this
space of time was amazing. Of course, it
helps when the average song length is just
2Vi minutes, but 30 is still quite a respectable
number of songs for a concert.
The set began with "Teenage Lobotomy,"
a driving cut from their successful Rocket to
Russia album, and the fans went wild.
Shortly thereafter, they followed with
"Blitzkrieg Bop," and the whole audience
joined Joey Ramone in shouting "Hey-ho,
let's go!"
The Ramones went on to include selec
tions from nearly all of their albums. Songs
from the Ramones' movie Rock and Roll
High School were very popular with the
crowd, which got very pumped up after
hearing the title track, and"I Want to be
Sedated."
Lead singer Joey Ramone wore his usual
outfit of a striped purple and black shirt
which were well coordinated with his tight
pants. Unlike the boring lead singer of the
High-Hitters, Joey entertained the crowd by
swinging a baseball bat around during "Beat
on the Brat."
Joey drummed up more crowd reaction
during the encore by playing the cowbell
during the new hit single, "Time Has Come
Today." Indeed, the new album release Sub
terranian jungle was heavily represented
during the concert. Not that the Ramones
neglected their older albums, though, for
they played many selections from Pleasant
Dreams, End of the Century and The
Ramones. One of our favorites, "Sheena is a
Punk Rocker," was also a hit during the en
core.
Clearly, it was Joey Ramone who provided

the experience. The man is tall, and he is also
thinner-than-anything-known. Suf h a weird
juxtaposition, effectively hidden behind two
feet of black hair and rose-colored sunglas
ses makes one ask the eternal question,
"lust what is this guy?" And when his voice
explodes into a wire-taut Ramones melody,
you admi' that there is no way of knowing,
short of dissection.
It's hard to explain what )oey Ramone has
that David Byrne of the Talking Heads
doesn't. Perhaps it's oddity. He's a
paranormal person; a cross between nean
derthal man and a kitchen blender who
leaves those who hear him sing thinking
"well done."
One shouldn't forget to mention
joey's brothers, who also did a super job.
Someone once said that the Ramones only
know three chords, but they're the right
three chords. This is true. Noneof the flashy
note progressions on their later albums sur
faced during the concert; it was only johnny
Ramone and his monster rhythm riffs. Dee
Dee Ramone also jacked up the power, pro
viding back-up vocals and those ever in
teresting bass chords.
Marky provided a powerful backdrop with
his drumming, and wasn't the least bit per
turbed when a jacket thrown up from the
wild crowd on the dance floor reached his
drum set. The crowd was not the only thing
that was heated up, as Johnny and Dee Dee
were so fired up that they had to remove
their leather jackets shortly after the concert
began.
The only disappointing part of the concert
(besides the hot-shot photographers who
kept blockingour view to snap pictures) was
that the Ramones didn't play a few of our
favorites, especially "Danny Says,"
"Ramona" or "The Return of Jackie and
Judy."
Oh well. We can't be disappointed after
seeing two encores and more than 30 songs
from America's pre-eminent punk rock
band. As Joey Ramone said on KOAK radio
last weekend, "People are finally waking up.
They are disgusted with Black Sabbath, and
they want to hear something fresh." Indeed,
if anything, the concert last week proved
that the Ramones are in touch with the to
day's musical sounds. Besides, the show was
outstanding.
