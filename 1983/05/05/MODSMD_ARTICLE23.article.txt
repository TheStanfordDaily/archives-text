# Something unsatisfying this way comes, limping
## 
### RICHARD KYLBERG 
Jack Clayton's latest film,
Something Wicked This Way
Comes, is one of extremes; at
times it is extremely good and
at times it is extremely bad. In
whole, it is not extremely
worth seeing.
Something Wicked This Way
Comes has more metaphor
than plot. Dark's Pan
demonium Carnival brings a
herd of Autumn People to
Creentown, Illinois, appar
ently bringing the citizens
satisfaction of their desires,
but really turning them into
zombies. It seems Dark (played
by lonathan Pryce) found a way
to harness men's misery in
order to destroy them. The film
concentrates on two boys',
Will Halloway (Vidal Peterson)
and |im Nightshade (Shawn
Carson), and Will's father
Charles' (two-time Oscar
winner lason Robards for All
The President's Men and lulia)
efforts to non-violently (it's a
Disney) chase off these
naughty carnival weirdos, and
in turn their own unhappiness.
The screenplay is written by
Ray Bradbury, based on his

novel of the same title, and it is
very very Ray Bradbury. Unlike
the televised Martian Chroni
cles, this film holds closer to
the plot and consequent
themes presented in the novel,
and indeed much of Brad
bury's work (as in Dandelion
Wine). Although Bradbury's in
tentions are good, here they
are ruined. Viewers aren't
vampires, but this film ham
mers its simple messages into
us repeatedly as if we were. It's
as if Clayton were writing,
"Our life is good, do not suc
cumb to misery" 50 times on
the blackboard, and in 94 min
utes he forces us to read it each
time.
The acting exhibits well the
extremes of the film. Pryce is
brilliant as Mr. Dark, terrifying
as he tears the flaming pages of
life from a book before Mr.
Halloway, shocking in his sinis
ter recitation of Macbeth's "by
the pricking of my thumbs,
something wicked this way
comes."
Peterson and Carson, on the
other hand, are atrocious.
They recite their lines to each
other, not even appearing to

hold a conversation. When
thousands of tarantulas attack
them, they scream a lot, but
don't look frightened. Their
scripts say "SCREAM," and
they do, not out of fright, but
because someone told them
to. Robards is very good as the
father, but most of his time is
spent with these two, and they
detract from his performance
remarkably.
The cinematograpy fluc
tuates also, but is primarily un
satisfying. The Disney studios
have certainly made a movie;
almost every shot in the film is
moving. The film is one big
dolly-track-arc-crane-pan-tilt
zoom-flop. Normally such
movement, called fluid
camera technique, can be ex
tremely expressive (as in Kub
rick's The Shining and Viscon
ti's Death in Venice), but in
Something Wicked This Way
Comes, we feel only as if we
should have taken a
Dramamine for motion sick
ness before entering the thea
ter. Still, the film is loaded with
wonderful shots; the carnival
train's mysterious smoke rac
ing along the green horizon,
and the Hall of Mirrors shot to

look like a smoke-filled mysti
cal forest.
The special effects are also
either really good, or really
bad. The live tattoo on Dark's
forearm is frightening, and his
hideous final transformation
should set new standards for
such effects. However, the
backdrops of the countryside
look like wallpaper (perhaps
leftovers from Song of the
South) and the green mist
which attacks Will and )im be
longs in a Mickey Mouse car
toon. One feels that an excess
of the film's budget was
applied to some effects at the
cost of others.
With all of these fluctua
tions, one leaves the theater
with the sick feeling that
they've witnessed a wonderful
story, but that something was
missing in the film. Like the
majority of Bradbury's work,
the film touches on some in
teresting issues, and the story
is intriguing, but the handling
of the story, the movie, is not
very good. Clayton will be
proud to be remembered for
Room at the Top and The Inno
cents, but he will not be so
proud of this one.


If this man offers you a free pass
to a movie â€” don't take it!
