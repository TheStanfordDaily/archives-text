# A 						new Lowe: Abominable Showman proves a man of his word
## 
### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
A poet once said that the saddest words are "What
might have been." I'd hate to disagree with a man with
such a way with words, but I'd like to suggest that the
words "The new Nick Lowe album is insipid" should be
included somewhere high on the list.
You see, a good Nick Lowe album has a lot to offer.
When he's good, which has been the case on the pre

ceding albums, he can put out material that's both
catchy musically and with some value intellectually.
Plus, he can write with a sense of humor without falling
into the pit of the novelty song. There's so little humor in
modern music that isn't "Weird Al Jankovic" and Dr.
Demento — basically, just Blotto and Lowe.
When he's off, as is the case on the aptly named The
Abominable Showman, he can hit the bottom in almost
every standard of quality known to man. Starkly put, this
album is weakly produced, incompletely thought out,
tired sounding, lacking in any real energy and inspira
tion and has a blank inner sleeve.
Taking these gripes one at a time, there's a warning
that has to be stated here: the people that produced this
album are among the best in the business. Lowe has long
been recognized as a "hitmaker," and Roger Bechirian
worked wonders with Elvis Costello on designing the
sound on Imperial Bedroom. Lowe, however, is famous
for not treating his own work with the same meticulous
care he brings to other works, and Bechirian seems to
have worked in absentia.
It's almost the ultimate producer's album; one song,
"Cool Reaction," even has a triangle on it, and the other
songs have all the tricks up to and including strings.
However, noneof this works. It's all polish and no shine.
Lowe also seems to have fallen into the habit of writing
songs after thinking up a good title. Although he came
up with a good song on "Time Wounds all Heels" there's

a real clunker with "(For every woman who ever made a
tool of a man there's a woman who made a) Man of a
Fool" — which is the actual way it appears on the jacket.
This song goes into cardiac arrest as they struggle to get
the title out. Maybe a nice notion, but not well done.
This also seems to be the album where age first caught
up to Lowe. There's a few unconvincing "rockers" —
"Tanqe-Rae," "Chicken and Feathers," "Saint Beneath
the Paint" and even "We want Action" spring to mind —
and one hideous monstrosity, called "How Do You Talk
to an Angel." I cannot explain this song away at all; it's
possibly as bad as you would expect. Perhaps this was
written for another, different type of performer. Fred
Astaire or Kermit the Frog being my first guesses.
This impressive lack of inspiration is consistent
throughout the album. There's also a few tired cliches
tossed in from place to place, possibly to let us know that
we're listening to a musician with roots. There's a song
that starts off with a telephone operator's voice, one that
starts off with angry crowd noises, one that uses Buddy
Holly-styled plucked violin strings to simulate tears and
one that uses Beach Boys-type chanting. Most of the
others start off with an eight-bar intro and some "off
mike" howling.
Of all these tried and true gimmicks, the only one that
really works is the Chuck Berry-styled intro into "Raging
Eyes." I guess it all depends upon who you borrow from.
"Raging Eyes" is a good song, although there seems to

be a tendency for the vocal to rise in his throat, ending
the song with the notes presumably flowing from a spot
between his eyes.
There are other good songs. "We Want Action," de
spite a sexist slant and some regrettable "funny noises"
tossed in, is agreeable enough. "Mess Around With
Love" (which you can't do) is likewise nice, but has a
gimmick of a solo played deep in the bass register of the
piano, sounding rather like an anvil chorus. "Time
Wounds all Heals" has maybe the only trick that works, a
rather neat syncopation on the title refrain, and has a
good psuedo-Philly soul sound.
Still, most of the album is merely "nice," and it just
isn't as dynamic as it should be. Most of the songs fade
or simply die out, a sign that Lowe wasn't into it enough
to come up with real endings. Some songs lack cohe
sion, and there really aren't any lines worth quoting.
"Saint Beneath the Paint" showed a vestigial plot, but it
was lost shortly after the start.
It doesn't look like there is going to be any great
search mounted to try to find The Abominable Show
man. The album sometimes rises as far as nice, and
never gets going. This is disappointing — Lowe hasn't
even sold out to become this bland, having sold out to
his great advantage years ago. All I can say is it'll be a cold
day in the Himalayas before I put this album on again.
