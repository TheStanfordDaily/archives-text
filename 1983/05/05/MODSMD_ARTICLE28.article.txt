Grill session
Staffers: gather your questions.
The grill session for the Vol. 184
candidates—Chris Butchko,, Kristen
Christopher, Heather Millar and Alan
Tripp—will be held at staff lunch this
Monday. Voting will take place
Tuesday.
Summertime
Anyone interested in editing the
summer volume, summer visitor's
guide or the commencement issue
should contact Karen. All three jobs
are good experience and fun too.

Raising Caen
Herb Caen will speak to the Daily
within the next few weeks—stay
tuned for details. When you're in the
office, ask to take a peek at the mar
velous letter he sent Karen.
It's a hit
The fearsome Daily softball team
will be pitted against the Professional
Journalism Fellows Sunday, May 15. at
Wilbur Field. There will be a picnic
and practice the day before. Same
place, time to be announced.
