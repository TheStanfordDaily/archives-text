# Internal investigation clears V.A. Hospital of animal cruelty charges

### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
An internal review committee tor
the U.S. Veterans Administration
Hospital in Palo Alto has disagreed
with allegations from the Humane
Society of Santa Clara Valley that a
dog found in the hospital's halls in
March suffered mistreatment by
animal researchers.
According to an animal care review
committeee at the hospital, the dog
was wounded in an attack from
another dog and was not the victim
of inhumane treatment.
The injuries which the dog sus
tained "do not reflect negatively on
the high quality of animal care pro
vided at the V.A. Hospital," the
committee's report said.
The dog had been part of a V.A.
Hospital study conducted by Univer
sity faculty members and other re
searchers from the Medical School.
Most V.A. physicians have dual ap
pointments at the University.
At the time of the incident, lames
Dewson, director of Stanford's Divi
sion of Laboratory Animal Medicine,
declined to name the faculty
member who was conducting the
experiment with the dog, but said
the experiment involved cardiovas
cular research.
Stanford medical student Peter
Barran found the wounded animal
near his laboratory at the V.A. Hospi-

tal on March 24. Believing that the
dog was badly wounded, he took it to
Dr. Randy Hemphill, a Palo Alto vet
erinarian, who determined that the
dog's injuries were serious enough
to justify destroying it.
Hemphill then reported it to the
Humane Society and asked that
charges be made.
Area humane societies have said
they would investigate the incident
themselves.Peninsula Humane Soci
ety spokesperson Kim Sturla said
yesterday that her group is still pre
paring a statement which will be
ready "in a week or so. We are still
investigating it, but we're moving
very cautiously and very thoroughly.
It has not been put by the wayside."
Sturla would not comment on the
committee's report because she had
not yet seen a copy of it. "Having not
read the report really limits what we
can say," she said.
According to Mike Coodkind,
spokesperson for the Med Center,
the committee's finding are not sur
prising. "Based on our initial knowl
edge of the situation, everything
seemed to indicate this (that the dog
had not been mistreated.) It would
have been unfair to pre-judge the
precise contents of the document,
but we are not surprised that the re
sults of the formal inquiry are consis
tent with what we understood the
â™¦acts to be immediately after the in
cident," he said.
