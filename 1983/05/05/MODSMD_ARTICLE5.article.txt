Debating the future of strategic
arms control policy before a
crowded Kresge Auditorium last
night, SLAC Director Wolfgang
Panofsky denounced a defensive
strategy for arms control in opposi
tion to physicist Lowell Wood of
Lawrence Livermore Laboratories.
Panofsky advocated arms control
and disarmament within an offen
sively oriented policy as an answer to
national security. "I simply do not
believe there is evidence that defen
sive systems can prevent the delivery
of offensive weapons due to the
'awesome power' of today's
weaponry," Panofsky said. "There is
no question that the increased de
structive power of nuclear weapons
has made the defensive job much
harder than the offensive one."
By contrast, Wood argued for "an
emphasis on defense, a de-emphasis
on offense and finally, its out and out
abandonment." He referred to an
analogy of the United States and the
USSR as people standing "with
cocked pistols held to each other's
heads."
"The current arms system is pro
foundly unstable; all of civilization
has an excellent chance of going
smash by the end of this century if we
keep on this path," Wood said. "And
the rate of failure is accelerating," he
added, referring to the current at
tempts to limit the offensive arms
race.
That defense can always be over
whelmed by a more offensive effort
is a "fashionable myth," Wood said.

"Historically defense has proved
very effective, as in the cases of
trenches used in World War I. It
would be a difficult race for offensive
strategies to run against emerging
defensive technologies," he said.
Panofsky disagreed. "Defense has
finite capabilities," he said, "but
there are no limits to offense; you
can always have more arms." He
added that advances in offensive
weapons historically made weapons
obsolete; "it has never been accept
able to have an impenetrable de
fense," as a security policy, he said.
Rather than working towards the
"dynamic balance" of offensive
weapons which Panofsky supports,
Wood prescribed a scenario, recal
ling his pistols analogy, where the
USSR and the United States could
"pull the pistols from each other's
heads, back away from each other,
raise the shields synchronously,
drop the pistols when the shields are
fully positioned, then kick away the
pistols."
Panofsky decried this kind of a
switch to defensive technologies,
questioning whether the United
States could move from an offensive
dominance to a defensive domi
nance "without getting ourselves in
trouble."
"Defense then become only a new
layer of competition. . . .Are we in
creasing national security by adding
yet another layer of competition?"
Panofsky asked. "Increasing
weapons in no way to decrease
weapons."
