Reagan warns of aid cut-off
Washington — President Reagan yesterday de
scribed anti-government guerrillas in Nicaragua as
"freedom fighters," and said action by Congress to
cut off U.S. financial support for them would set "a
very dangerous precedent" because "it literally was
taking away the ability of the executive branch to
carry out its constitutional responsibilities."
Reagan made his remarks during a rambling and
sometimes confusing 35-minute Oval Office in
terview with reporters from six news organizations. A
transcript of the interview was made available to oth
er White House correspondents. He took issue with
Tuesday's vote by the Democratic majority of the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence

to cut off covert U.S. aid to the guerrillas fighting the
left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
Acknowledging that the United States was directly
aiding and "providing subsistence" to the anti-Sand
inista forces, Reagan expressed support for their ob
jectives and said he hoped that what he called an "ir
responsible" House committee vote would be over
turned in the Senate.
During the interview, Reagan sometimes inter
rupted himself and strayed from the subject as he
sought to explain administration policy on Central
America, arms control and the Middle East. Without
indicating he knew he was doing so, Reaganalso con
tradicted the position of the State Department in dis
cussing the policy on nuclear arms adopted Tuesday
by the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops.

Some of the reporters who participated in the in
terview said afterward that the president at times ap
peared to have difficulty concentrating on the ques
tions and his answers to them.
Questioning the legitimacy of the Sandinista gov
ernment in Nicaragua, Reagan said: "And what really
— other than being in control of the capital, you
might say, and having a handle on all the levers —
what makes them any more a legitimate government
than the people of Nicaragua who are asking for a
<hance to vote for the kind of government they
want."
House passes mild arms freeze
Washington — The House of Representatives

passed the controversial freeze resolution yesterday
night, 278-149, but not until opponents had watered
down the measure by adding a time limit that would
negate its provisions unless progress is made in reduc
ing nuclear arsenals.
Some freeze proponents complained that the reso
lution had been gutted, but others said the symbolic
importance of the resolution had survived intact.
The non-binding resolution now goes to the Sen
ate, where passage is doubtful.
The final vote on the resolution was anticlimactic
after more than 40 hours of debate spread over morqj
than a month. The success of freeze opponents
brought cheers from the Republican side of the
House.
