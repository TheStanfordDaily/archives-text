Reagan warns of aid cut-off
Washington — President Reagan yesterday de
scribed anti-government guerrillas in Nicaragua as
"freedom fighters," and said action by Congress to
cut off U.S. financial support for them would set "a
very dangerous precedent" because "it literally was
taking away the ability of the executive branch to
carry out its constitutional responsibilities."
Reagan made his remarks during a rambling and
sometimes confusing 35-minute Oval Office in
terview with reporters from six news organizations. A
transcript of the interview was made available to oth
er White House correspondents. He took issue with
Tuesday's vote by the Democratic majority of the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence

to cut off covert U.S. aid to the guerrillas fighting the
left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
Acknowledging that the United States was directly
aiding and "providing subsistence" to the anti-Sand
inista forces, Reagan expressed support for their ob
jectives and said he hoped that what he called an "ir
responsible" House committee vote would be over
turned in the Senate.
During the interview, Reagan sometimes inter
rupted himself and strayed from the subject as he
sought to explain administration policy on Central
America, arms control and the Middle East. Without
indicating he knew he was doing so, Reaganalso con
tradicted the position of the State Department in dis
cussing the policy on nuclear arms adopted Tuesday
by the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops.

Some of the reporters who participated in the in
terview said afterward that the president at times ap
peared to have difficulty concentrating on the ques
tions and his answers to them.
Questioning the legitimacy of the Sandinista gov
ernment in Nicaragua, Reagan said: "And what really
— other than being in control of the capital, you
might say, and having a handle on all the levers —
what makes them any more a legitimate government
than the people of Nicaragua who are asking for a
<hance to vote for the kind of government they
want."
House passes mild arms freeze
Washington — The House of Representatives

passed the controversial freeze resolution yesterday
night, 278-149, but not until opponents had watered
down the measure by adding a time limit that would
negate its provisions unless progress is made in reduc
ing nuclear arsenals.
Some freeze proponents complained that the reso
lution had been gutted, but others said the symbolic
importance of the resolution had survived intact.
The non-binding resolution now goes to the Sen
ate, where passage is doubtful.
The final vote on the resolution was anticlimactic
after more than 40 hours of debate spread over morqj
than a month. The success of freeze opponents
brought cheers from the Republican side of the
House.
The original resolution would have directed U.S.
arms negotiators to seek "an immediate, mutual and
verifiable freeze" on nuclear weapons with the Soviet
Union.
But it was amended, by a 221-203 vote, to cause the
freeze mandate toexpire unless reductions in nuclear
arsenals were negotiated during a time period set by
the negotiators.
The new measure states that the mandate to nego
tiate a freeze is contingent on "the achievement of re
duction (of nuclear weapons) within a reasonable
specified time to be determined by the negotiators."
German chancellor warns Soviets
Bonn, West Germany — West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl warned the Soviet Union yesterday that
it could not expect to develop ties with the West "if
the Soviet leadership wishessimultaneously to pursue
revolutionary class struggle against the free world."
The warning came in a two-hour policy speech in
Parliament in which Kohl outlined the goals of his
center-right coalition government for the next four
years following its victory in the March 6 general elec
tion.
Kohl stressed Bonn's commitment to the Western
alliance and its ties to the United States.
Kohl said that he accepted the Soviet Union's need
for security, but added, "nothing, however, justifies
the Soviet Union's excessive armament, which threat
ens the security of its neighbors and serves the
purpose of political coercion."
He said there was no justification for Moscow's pol
icy of expansion "which led to the invasion of Afghan
istan and restricted the freedom of decision of the
Polish people. "
Reagan welcomes missile plan
Washington — President Reagan, responding
positively for the second straight day to proposals for
arms limitation, said yesterday the United States
would give "serious consideration" to Soviet leader
Yuri Andropov's proposal to count warheads rather
than missiles in the Euromissile talks in Geneva, Switz
erland, that resume in two weeks.
But he cautioned during a meeting with reporters
in his Oval Office that only through actual nego
tiations would it become known "whether this was
just propaganda or a (serious) proposal."
The day before, in response to calls by con
gressmen, Reagan signaled willingness to amend his
proposal in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
(START) to reflect the arms-control recommenda
tions of the president's Commission on Strategic
Forces, also known as the MX Commission.
White House officials, in amplifying on the presi
dent's Tuesday actions, said yesterday that mod
ifications to the administration's START proposal may
be ready to lay before the Soviets in Geneva when the
talks resume June 8. These "technical changes," as
one administration official called them, will probably
directly affect the 850-missile ceiling in the present
U.S. offer. The administration will apparently now try

to strike a balance in the number of warheads rather
than in the number of missiles, which carry varying
loads of warheads.
Solidarity activists emigrate
Washington — Nearly 1200 Poles associated with
the banned Solidarity labor union have left their
country for resettlement here under an unusual U.S.
program, State Department officials said yesterday.
The resettlement program was started without an
nouncement last July after months of public attacks
by the United States and its allies on the Polish gov
ernment's policy of pressuring Solidarity leaders to
leave the country.
The exodus of 300 to 400 activists, accompanied by
family members, is the product of parallel actions by
the Polish government, the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw,
the Geneva-based Intergovernmental Committee for
Migration (ICM) and private sponsors here.
All of the activists served time in prison or intern
ment camps foi political activity since the martial-law
crackdown on Solidarity in December 1981.
The emigrating Poles begin the first leg of their
American journey with special "one-way passports"
valid only for departure, and West German transit vi
sas. Their first destination isa German resort hotel that
has been taken over as a receiving station by the ICM,
with U.S. financing.
Shultz brings plan to Israel
Jerusalem — The Lebanese government yesterday
approved a U.S.-mediated plan for withdrawal of Is
raeli forces from Lebanon, and Secretary of State
George Shultz immediately flew here in hope of win
ning Israel's consent to the draft agreement.
Shultz refused to predict whether his week-long
exercise in shuttle diplomacy was on the verge of suc
cess. But the mood among U.S. officials accompany
ing the secretary clearly was optimistic, and there was
expectation that the drive to win a Lebanese-Israeli
accord might be concluded when the Israeli Cabinet
meets tomorrow to consider the matter.
Shultz also announced that he will go to Damascus
Saturday to discuss the agreement with Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad. The Israelis have made clear that
they will not pull their forces out of Lebanon unless
Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization forces in
that country also withdraw, and there has been con
siderable skepticism in Israel about whether Assad
would cooperate.
Shultz said during the flight here, "Obviously, the
Israelis are not going to withdraw if there is no indica
tion of Syrian withdrawal.... But this is a negotiation
between Israel and Lebanon, and what the Syrian
position is, is a separate thing."
Regarding the plan approved by the Lebanese gov
ernment, one senior U.S. official said, "I can'tsee how
either side can say no to this and then defend their
position."
When reporters aboard Shultz's plane asked
whether an agreement seemed closer, Shultz replied:
"Well, sure. We have a clear, very forthcoming posi
tion from the government of Lebanon. Now we'll see

what Israel says."
After arriving here in the late afternoon, the secre
tary plunged into new talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir
and Defense Minister Moshe Arens. U.S. officials said
late yesterday night that the Israelis want to study vari
ous points in the draft more closely and said that they
would be back in touch with Shultz today.
Ruckelshaus pledges fair hiring
Washington — William Ruckelshaus, President
Reagan's choice to head the troubled Environmental
Protection Agency, promised yesterday that there
would be none of the "hit lists" for employ
ees,"sweetheart deals" with industry or political de
cisions that helped bring the downfall of his prede
cessor two months ago.
He told the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee, which is holding hearings on his nomi
nation, that his first priority will be "to recruit the best
people I can find to manage the agency" and to re
store public trust in EPA by opening the agency's ac
tivities to scrutiny by environmentalists and other
public interest groups.
Ruckelshaus, who won effusive praise from both
Democrats and Republicans on the committee, is ex
pected to win confirmation easily.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
made a special appearance before the committee to
say that Ruckelshaus had "my unreserved con
fidence." Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said
Ruckelshaus' "integrity is a breath of fresh air for an
agency that has been ravaged by two years of bungl
ing mismanagment."
Ruckelshaus, 50, said that he told President Reagan
that he would "do my best" to fashion policies in
keeping with the president's environmental program.
Political prisoners gain amnesty
San Salvador — El Salvador's Constituent Assembly
unanimously approved a limited amnesty yesterday
that will free about half of the country's 780 political
prisoners.
The measure also gives Salvadoran guerrillas 60
days in which to lay down their arms and to apply for
amnesty without reprisal.
In approving the government-sponsored law by a
56-0 vote, the assembly, which is El Salvador's national
Legislature, also created a national amnesty board to
guarantee the safety of guerrillas who surrender.
Yesterday's action was a clear bow toward the U.S.
Congress, which requires the Reagan administration
to certify continued improvement in human rights in
El Salvador as a condition for continuing U.S. aid to
the country.
Antonio Guevara, the Christian Democratic Party's
expert on the law, told a legislative caucus before the
vote that the amnesty would immediately affect
"about half" of the political prisoners.
In urging support for the law by the Christian Dem
ocrats, the single largest faction in the assembly,
Guevara termed it "a true contribution to pacif
ication."

The amnesty provides immediate release for all
Salvadoran nationals being held on politically related
offenses with maximum sentences of four years or
less, as well as those held for prolonged periods
without trial.
Foreigners and members of the armed forces are
specifically exempted from the amnesty, as are those
charged with "murder, kidnapping, rape or serious
terrorist acts."
Among those who will not be affected by the am
nesty are 10 soldiers and national guardsmen accused
of murdering seven Americans since 1980.
Provisions offering amnesty to active guerrillas
seems more rhetorical than substantive, and even
some legislators who supported the initiative won
dered aloud if the safety of surrendering guerrillas
could be guaranteed.
Under the law, the amnesty board is to establish in
dependent offices around the country and be made
up of representatives of the Salvadoran Peace Com
mission, the Commission on Human Rights and the
Ministry of Interior. All three are government agen
cies; the Ministry of Interior controls the Salvadoran
police.
Kirkpatrick praises rightest rebels
Los Angeles — Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, laid down in Los Angeles last
night what she called "our main goal" for the govern
ment of Nicaragua.
"Our main g0a1... is that it stop systematically sub
verting and destabilizing and trying by all means at its
disposal to make war on its neighbors — overthrow
ing the government of El Salvador, undermining the
government of Honduras and bullying the govern
ment of Costa Rica.
"We think it should stop."
She also accused Nicaragua's Sandinista govern
ment of breaking promises it had made to the Or
ganization of American States in 1979 when, she said,
they promised full respect for civil rights and demo
cratric principles.
Kirkpatrick, 56, delivered the demand at the close
of a half-hour speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs
Council, after being greeted by nearly 800 protesters
who staged a two-hour demonstration outside the
Hilton Hotel downtown, where she gave her speech.
She made the accusations when asked whether she
thought the United States had selected allies who had
credibility among Nicaraguan citizens.

talks resume June 8. These "technical changes," as
one administration official called them, will probably
directly affect the 850-missile ceiling in the present
U.S. offer. The administration will apparently now try

to strike a balance in the number of warheads rather
than in the number of missiles, which carry varying
loads of warheads.
Solidarity activists emigrate
Washington — Nearly 1200 Poles associated with
the banned Solidarity labor union have left their
country for resettlement here under an unusual U.S.
program, State Department officials said yesterday.
The resettlement program was started without an
nouncement last July after months of public attacks
by the United States and its allies on the Polish gov
ernment's policy of pressuring Solidarity leaders to
leave the country.
The exodus of 300 to 400 activists, accompanied by
family members, is the product of parallel actions by
the Polish government, the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw,
the Geneva-based Intergovernmental Committee for
Migration (ICM) and private sponsors here.
All of the activists served time in prison or intern
ment camps foi political activity since the martial-law
crackdown on Solidarity in December 1981.
The emigrating Poles begin the first leg of their
American journey with special "one-way passports"
valid only for departure, and West German transit vi
sas. Their first destination isa German resort hotel that
has been taken over as a receiving station by the ICM,
with U.S. financing.
Shultz brings plan to Israel
Jerusalem — The Lebanese government yesterday
approved a U.S.-mediated plan for withdrawal of Is
raeli forces from Lebanon, and Secretary of State
George Shultz immediately flew here in hope of win
ning Israel's consent to the draft agreement.
Shultz refused to predict whether his week-long
exercise in shuttle diplomacy was on the verge of suc
cess. But the mood among U.S. officials accompany
ing the secretary clearly was optimistic, and there was
expectation that the drive to win a Lebanese-Israeli
accord might be concluded when the Israeli Cabinet
meets tomorrow to consider the matter.
Shultz also announced that he will go to Damascus
Saturday to discuss the agreement with Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad. The Israelis have made clear that
they will not pull their forces out of Lebanon unless
Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization forces in
that country also withdraw, and there has been con
siderable skepticism in Israel about whether Assad
would cooperate.
Shultz said during the flight here, "Obviously, the
Israelis are not going to withdraw if there is no indica
tion of Syrian withdrawal.... But this is a negotiation
between Israel and Lebanon, and what the Syrian
position is, is a separate thing."
Regarding the plan approved by the Lebanese gov
ernment, one senior U.S. official said, "I can'tsee how
either side can say no to this and then defend their
position."
When reporters aboard Shultz's plane asked
whether an agreement seemed closer, Shultz replied:
"Well, sure. We have a clear, very forthcoming posi
tion from the government of Lebanon. Now we'll see

what Israel says."
After arriving here in the late afternoon, the secre
tary plunged into new talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir
and Defense Minister Moshe Arens. U.S. officials said
late yesterday night that the Israelis want to study vari
ous points in the draft more closely and said that they
would be back in touch with Shultz today.
Ruckelshaus pledges fair hiring
Washington — William Ruckelshaus, President
Reagan's choice to head the troubled Environmental
Protection Agency, promised yesterday that there
would be none of the "hit lists" for employ
ees,"sweetheart deals" with industry or political de
cisions that helped bring the downfall of his prede
cessor two months ago.
He told the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee, which is holding hearings on his nomi
nation, that his first priority will be "to recruit the best
people I can find to manage the agency" and to re
store public trust in EPA by opening the agency's ac
tivities to scrutiny by environmentalists and other
public interest groups.
Ruckelshaus, who won effusive praise from both
Democrats and Republicans on the committee, is ex
pected to win confirmation easily.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
made a special appearance before the committee to
say that Ruckelshaus had "my unreserved con
fidence." Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said
Ruckelshaus' "integrity is a breath of fresh air for an
agency that has been ravaged by two years of bungl
ing mismanagment."
Ruckelshaus, 50, said that he told President Reagan
that he would "do my best" to fashion policies in
keeping with the president's environmental program.
Political prisoners gain amnesty
San Salvador — El Salvador's Constituent Assembly
unanimously approved a limited amnesty yesterday
that will free about half of the country's 780 political
prisoners.
The measure also gives Salvadoran guerrillas 60
days in which to lay down their arms and to apply for
amnesty without reprisal.
In approving the government-sponsored law by a
56-0 vote, the assembly, which is El Salvador's national
Legislature, also created a national amnesty board to
guarantee the safety of guerrillas who surrender.
Yesterday's action was a clear bow toward the U.S.
Congress, which requires the Reagan administration
to certify continued improvement in human rights in
El Salvador as a condition for continuing U.S. aid to
the country.
Antonio Guevara, the Christian Democratic Party's
expert on the law, told a legislative caucus before the
vote that the amnesty would immediately affect
"about half" of the political prisoners.
In urging support for the law by the Christian Dem
ocrats, the single largest faction in the assembly,
Guevara termed it "a true contribution to pacif
ication."

The amnesty provides immediate release for all
Salvadoran nationals being held on politically related
offenses with maximum sentences of four years or
less, as well as those held for prolonged periods
without trial.
Foreigners and members of the armed forces are
specifically exempted from the amnesty, as are those
charged with "murder, kidnapping, rape or serious
terrorist acts."
Among those who will not be affected by the am
nesty are 10 soldiers and national guardsmen accused
of murdering seven Americans since 1980.
Provisions offering amnesty to active guerrillas
seems more rhetorical than substantive, and even
some legislators who supported the initiative won
dered aloud if the safety of surrendering guerrillas
could be guaranteed.
Under the law, the amnesty board is to establish in
dependent offices around the country and be made
up of representatives of the Salvadoran Peace Com
mission, the Commission on Human Rights and the
Ministry of Interior. All three are government agen
cies; the Ministry of Interior controls the Salvadoran
police.
Kirkpatrick praises rightest rebels
Los Angeles — Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, laid down in Los Angeles last
night what she called "our main goal" for the govern
ment of Nicaragua.
"Our main g0a1... is that it stop systematically sub
verting and destabilizing and trying by all means at its
disposal to make war on its neighbors — overthrow
ing the government of El Salvador, undermining the
government of Honduras and bullying the govern
ment of Costa Rica.
"We think it should stop."
She also accused Nicaragua's Sandinista govern
ment of breaking promises it had made to the Or
ganization of American States in 1979 when, she said,
they promised full respect for civil rights and demo
cratric principles.
Kirkpatrick, 56, delivered the demand at the close
of a half-hour speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs
Council, after being greeted by nearly 800 protesters
who staged a two-hour demonstration outside the
Hilton Hotel downtown, where she gave her speech.
She made the accusations when asked whether she
thought the United States had selected allies who had
credibility among Nicaraguan citizens.

Reagan warns of aid cut-off
Washington — President Reagan yesterday de
scribed anti-government guerrillas in Nicaragua as
"freedom fighters," and said action by Congress to
cut off U.S. financial support for them would set "a
very dangerous precedent" because "it literally was
taking away the ability of the executive branch to
carry out its constitutional responsibilities."
Reagan made his remarks during a rambling and
sometimes confusing 35-minute Oval Office in
terview with reporters from six news organizations. A
transcript of the interview was made available to oth
er White House correspondents. He took issue with
Tuesday's vote by the Democratic majority of the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence

to cut off covert U.S. aid to the guerrillas fighting the
left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
Acknowledging that the United States was directly
aiding and "providing subsistence" to the anti-Sand
inista forces, Reagan expressed support for their ob
jectives and said he hoped that what he called an "ir
responsible" House committee vote would be over
turned in the Senate.
During the interview, Reagan sometimes inter
rupted himself and strayed from the subject as he
sought to explain administration policy on Central
America, arms control and the Middle East. Without
indicating he knew he was doing so, Reaganalso con
tradicted the position of the State Department in dis
cussing the policy on nuclear arms adopted Tuesday
by the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops.

Some of the reporters who participated in the in
terview said afterward that the president at times ap
peared to have difficulty concentrating on the ques
tions and his answers to them.
Questioning the legitimacy of the Sandinista gov
ernment in Nicaragua, Reagan said: "And what really
— other than being in control of the capital, you
might say, and having a handle on all the levers —
what makes them any more a legitimate government
than the people of Nicaragua who are asking for a
<hance to vote for the kind of government they
want."
House passes mild arms freeze
Washington — The House of Representatives

passed the controversial freeze resolution yesterday
night, 278-149, but not until opponents had watered
down the measure by adding a time limit that would
negate its provisions unless progress is made in reduc
ing nuclear arsenals.
Some freeze proponents complained that the reso
lution had been gutted, but others said the symbolic
importance of the resolution had survived intact.
The non-binding resolution now goes to the Sen
ate, where passage is doubtful.
The final vote on the resolution was anticlimactic
after more than 40 hours of debate spread over morqj
than a month. The success of freeze opponents
brought cheers from the Republican side of the
House.
The original resolution would have directed U.S.
arms negotiators to seek "an immediate, mutual and
verifiable freeze" on nuclear weapons with the Soviet
Union.
But it was amended, by a 221-203 vote, to cause the
freeze mandate toexpire unless reductions in nuclear
arsenals were negotiated during a time period set by
the negotiators.
The new measure states that the mandate to nego
tiate a freeze is contingent on "the achievement of re
duction (of nuclear weapons) within a reasonable
specified time to be determined by the negotiators."
German chancellor warns Soviets
Bonn, West Germany — West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl warned the Soviet Union yesterday that
it could not expect to develop ties with the West "if
the Soviet leadership wishessimultaneously to pursue
revolutionary class struggle against the free world."
The warning came in a two-hour policy speech in
Parliament in which Kohl outlined the goals of his
center-right coalition government for the next four
years following its victory in the March 6 general elec
tion.
Kohl stressed Bonn's commitment to the Western
alliance and its ties to the United States.
Kohl said that he accepted the Soviet Union's need
for security, but added, "nothing, however, justifies
the Soviet Union's excessive armament, which threat
ens the security of its neighbors and serves the
purpose of political coercion."
He said there was no justification for Moscow's pol
icy of expansion "which led to the invasion of Afghan
istan and restricted the freedom of decision of the
Polish people. "
Reagan welcomes missile plan
Washington — President Reagan, responding
positively for the second straight day to proposals for
arms limitation, said yesterday the United States
would give "serious consideration" to Soviet leader
Yuri Andropov's proposal to count warheads rather
than missiles in the Euromissile talks in Geneva, Switz
erland, that resume in two weeks.
But he cautioned during a meeting with reporters
in his Oval Office that only through actual nego
tiations would it become known "whether this was
just propaganda or a (serious) proposal."
The day before, in response to calls by con
gressmen, Reagan signaled willingness to amend his
proposal in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
(START) to reflect the arms-control recommenda
tions of the president's Commission on Strategic
Forces, also known as the MX Commission.
White House officials, in amplifying on the presi
dent's Tuesday actions, said yesterday that mod
ifications to the administration's START proposal may
be ready to lay before the Soviets in Geneva when the
talks resume June 8. These "technical changes," as
one administration official called them, will probably

Legislature, also created a national amnesty board to
guarantee the safety of guerrillas who surrender.
Yesterday's action was a clear bow toward the U.S.
Congress, which requires the Reagan administration
to certify continued improvement in human rights in
El Salvador as a condition for continuing U.S. aid to
the country.
Antonio Guevara, the Christian Democratic Party's
expert on the law, told a legislative caucus before the
vote that the amnesty would immediately affect
"about half" of the political prisoners.
In urging support for the law by the Christian Dem
ocrats, the single largest faction in the assembly,
Guevara termed it "a true contribution to pacif
ication."

The amnesty provides immediate release for all
Salvadoran nationals being held on politically related
offenses with maximum sentences of four years or
less, as well as those held for prolonged periods
without trial.
Foreigners and members of the armed forces are
specifically exempted from the amnesty, as are those
charged with "murder, kidnapping, rape or serious
terrorist acts."
Among those who will not be affected by the am
nesty are 10 soldiers and national guardsmen accused
of murdering seven Americans since 1980.
Provisions offering amnesty to active guerrillas
seems more rhetorical than substantive, and even
some legislators who supported the initiative won
dered aloud if the safety of surrendering guerrillas
could be guaranteed.
Under the law, the amnesty board is to establish in
dependent offices around the country and be made
up of representatives of the Salvadoran Peace Com
mission, the Commission on Human Rights and the
Ministry of Interior. All three are government agen
cies; the Ministry of Interior controls the Salvadoran
police.
Kirkpatrick praises rightest rebels
Los Angeles — Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, laid down in Los Angeles last
night what she called "our main goal" for the govern
ment of Nicaragua.
"Our main g0a1... is that it stop systematically sub
verting and destabilizing and trying by all means at its
disposal to make war on its neighbors — overthrow
ing the government of El Salvador, undermining the
government of Honduras and bullying the govern
ment of Costa Rica.
"We think it should stop."
She also accused Nicaragua's Sandinista govern
ment of breaking promises it had made to the Or
ganization of American States in 1979 when, she said,
they promised full respect for civil rights and demo
cratric principles.
Kirkpatrick, 56, delivered the demand at the close
of a half-hour speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs
Council, after being greeted by nearly 800 protesters
who staged a two-hour demonstration outside the
Hilton Hotel downtown, where she gave her speech.
She made the accusations when asked whether she
thought the United States had selected allies who had
credibility among Nicaraguan citizens.

Reagan warns of aid cut-off
Washington — President Reagan yesterday de
scribed anti-government guerrillas in Nicaragua as
"freedom fighters," and said action by Congress to
cut off U.S. financial support for them would set "a
very dangerous precedent" because "it literally was
taking away the ability of the executive branch to
carry out its constitutional responsibilities."
Reagan made his remarks during a rambling and
sometimes confusing 35-minute Oval Office in
terview with reporters from six news organizations. A
transcript of the interview was made available to oth
er White House correspondents. He took issue with
Tuesday's vote by the Democratic majority of the
House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence

to cut off covert U.S. aid to the guerrillas fighting the
left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
Acknowledging that the United States was directly
aiding and "providing subsistence" to the anti-Sand
inista forces, Reagan expressed support for their ob
jectives and said he hoped that what he called an "ir
responsible" House committee vote would be over
turned in the Senate.
During the interview, Reagan sometimes inter
rupted himself and strayed from the subject as he
sought to explain administration policy on Central
America, arms control and the Middle East. Without
indicating he knew he was doing so, Reaganalso con
tradicted the position of the State Department in dis
cussing the policy on nuclear arms adopted Tuesday
by the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops.

Some of the reporters who participated in the in
terview said afterward that the president at times ap
peared to have difficulty concentrating on the ques
tions and his answers to them.
Questioning the legitimacy of the Sandinista gov
ernment in Nicaragua, Reagan said: "And what really
— other than being in control of the capital, you
might say, and having a handle on all the levers —
what makes them any more a legitimate government
than the people of Nicaragua who are asking for a
<hance to vote for the kind of government they
want."
House passes mild arms freeze
Washington — The House of Representatives

passed the controversial freeze resolution yesterday
night, 278-149, but not until opponents had watered
down the measure by adding a time limit that would
negate its provisions unless progress is made in reduc
ing nuclear arsenals.
Some freeze proponents complained that the reso
lution had been gutted, but others said the symbolic
importance of the resolution had survived intact.
The non-binding resolution now goes to the Sen
ate, where passage is doubtful.
The final vote on the resolution was anticlimactic
after more than 40 hours of debate spread over morqj
than a month. The success of freeze opponents
brought cheers from the Republican side of the
House.
The original resolution would have directed U.S.
arms negotiators to seek "an immediate, mutual and
verifiable freeze" on nuclear weapons with the Soviet
Union.
But it was amended, by a 221-203 vote, to cause the
freeze mandate toexpire unless reductions in nuclear
arsenals were negotiated during a time period set by
the negotiators.
The new measure states that the mandate to nego
tiate a freeze is contingent on "the achievement of re
duction (of nuclear weapons) within a reasonable
specified time to be determined by the negotiators."
German chancellor warns Soviets
Bonn, West Germany — West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl warned the Soviet Union yesterday that
it could not expect to develop ties with the West "if
the Soviet leadership wishessimultaneously to pursue
revolutionary class struggle against the free world."
The warning came in a two-hour policy speech in
Parliament in which Kohl outlined the goals of his
center-right coalition government for the next four
years following its victory in the March 6 general elec
tion.
Kohl stressed Bonn's commitment to the Western
alliance and its ties to the United States.
Kohl said that he accepted the Soviet Union's need
for security, but added, "nothing, however, justifies
the Soviet Union's excessive armament, which threat
ens the security of its neighbors and serves the
purpose of political coercion."
He said there was no justification for Moscow's pol
icy of expansion "which led to the invasion of Afghan
istan and restricted the freedom of decision of the
Polish people. "
Reagan welcomes missile plan
Washington — President Reagan, responding
positively for the second straight day to proposals for
arms limitation, said yesterday the United States
would give "serious consideration" to Soviet leader
Yuri Andropov's proposal to count warheads rather
than missiles in the Euromissile talks in Geneva, Switz
erland, that resume in two weeks.
But he cautioned during a meeting with reporters
in his Oval Office that only through actual nego
tiations would it become known "whether this was
just propaganda or a (serious) proposal."
The day before, in response to calls by con
gressmen, Reagan signaled willingness to amend his
proposal in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
(START) to reflect the arms-control recommenda
tions of the president's Commission on Strategic
Forces, also known as the MX Commission.
White House officials, in amplifying on the presi
dent's Tuesday actions, said yesterday that mod
ifications to the administration's START proposal may
be ready to lay before the Soviets in Geneva when the
talks resume June 8. These "technical changes," as
one administration official called them, will probably
directly affect the 850-missile ceiling in the present
U.S. offer. The administration will apparently now try

to strike a balance in the number of warheads rather
than in the number of missiles, which carry varying
loads of warheads.
Solidarity activists emigrate
Washington — Nearly 1200 Poles associated with
the banned Solidarity labor union have left their
country for resettlement here under an unusual U.S.
program, State Department officials said yesterday.
The resettlement program was started without an
nouncement last July after months of public attacks
by the United States and its allies on the Polish gov
ernment's policy of pressuring Solidarity leaders to
leave the country.
The exodus of 300 to 400 activists, accompanied by
family members, is the product of parallel actions by
the Polish government, the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw,
the Geneva-based Intergovernmental Committee for
Migration (ICM) and private sponsors here.
All of the activists served time in prison or intern
ment camps foi political activity since the martial-law
crackdown on Solidarity in December 1981.
The emigrating Poles begin the first leg of their
American journey with special "one-way passports"
valid only for departure, and West German transit vi
sas. Their first destination isa German resort hotel that
has been taken over as a receiving station by the ICM,
with U.S. financing.
Shultz brings plan to Israel
Jerusalem — The Lebanese government yesterday
approved a U.S.-mediated plan for withdrawal of Is
raeli forces from Lebanon, and Secretary of State
George Shultz immediately flew here in hope of win
ning Israel's consent to the draft agreement.
Shultz refused to predict whether his week-long
exercise in shuttle diplomacy was on the verge of suc
cess. But the mood among U.S. officials accompany
ing the secretary clearly was optimistic, and there was
expectation that the drive to win a Lebanese-Israeli
accord might be concluded when the Israeli Cabinet
meets tomorrow to consider the matter.
Shultz also announced that he will go to Damascus
Saturday to discuss the agreement with Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad. The Israelis have made clear that
they will not pull their forces out of Lebanon unless
Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization forces in
that country also withdraw, and there has been con
siderable skepticism in Israel about whether Assad
would cooperate.
Shultz said during the flight here, "Obviously, the
Israelis are not going to withdraw if there is no indica
tion of Syrian withdrawal.... But this is a negotiation
between Israel and Lebanon, and what the Syrian
position is, is a separate thing."
Regarding the plan approved by the Lebanese gov
ernment, one senior U.S. official said, "I can'tsee how
either side can say no to this and then defend their
position."
When reporters aboard Shultz's plane asked
whether an agreement seemed closer, Shultz replied:
"Well, sure. We have a clear, very forthcoming posi
tion from the government of Lebanon. Now we'll see

what Israel says."
After arriving here in the late afternoon, the secre
tary plunged into new talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir
and Defense Minister Moshe Arens. U.S. officials said
late yesterday night that the Israelis want to study vari
ous points in the draft more closely and said that they
would be back in touch with Shultz today.
Ruckelshaus pledges fair hiring
Washington — William Ruckelshaus, President
Reagan's choice to head the troubled Environmental
Protection Agency, promised yesterday that there
would be none of the "hit lists" for employ
ees,"sweetheart deals" with industry or political de
cisions that helped bring the downfall of his prede
cessor two months ago.
He told the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee, which is holding hearings on his nomi
nation, that his first priority will be "to recruit the best
people I can find to manage the agency" and to re
store public trust in EPA by opening the agency's ac
tivities to scrutiny by environmentalists and other
public interest groups.
Ruckelshaus, who won effusive praise from both
Democrats and Republicans on the committee, is ex
pected to win confirmation easily.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
made a special appearance before the committee to
say that Ruckelshaus had "my unreserved con
fidence." Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said
Ruckelshaus' "integrity is a breath of fresh air for an
agency that has been ravaged by two years of bungl
ing mismanagment."
Ruckelshaus, 50, said that he told President Reagan
that he would "do my best" to fashion policies in
keeping with the president's environmental program.
Political prisoners gain amnesty
San Salvador — El Salvador's Constituent Assembly
unanimously approved a limited amnesty yesterday
that will free about half of the country's 780 political
prisoners.
The measure also gives Salvadoran guerrillas 60
days in which to lay down their arms and to apply for
amnesty without reprisal.

56-0 vote, the assembly, which is El Salvador's national

— other than being in control of the capital, you
might say, and having a handle on all the levers —
what makes them any more a legitimate government
than the people of Nicaragua who are asking for a
<hance to vote for the kind of government they
want."
House passes mild arms freeze
Washington — The House of Representatives

passed the controversial freeze resolution yesterday
night, 278-149, but not until opponents had watered
down the measure by adding a time limit that would
negate its provisions unless progress is made in reduc
ing nuclear arsenals.
Some freeze proponents complained that the reso
lution had been gutted, but others said the symbolic
importance of the resolution had survived intact.
The non-binding resolution now goes to the Sen
ate, where passage is doubtful.
The final vote on the resolution was anticlimactic
after more than 40 hours of debate spread over morqj
than a month. The success of freeze opponents
brought cheers from the Republican side of the
House.
The original resolution would have directed U.S.
arms negotiators to seek "an immediate, mutual and
verifiable freeze" on nuclear weapons with the Soviet
Union.
But it was amended, by a 221-203 vote, to cause the
freeze mandate toexpire unless reductions in nuclear
arsenals were negotiated during a time period set by
the negotiators.
The new measure states that the mandate to nego
tiate a freeze is contingent on "the achievement of re
duction (of nuclear weapons) within a reasonable
specified time to be determined by the negotiators."
German chancellor warns Soviets
Bonn, West Germany — West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl warned the Soviet Union yesterday that
it could not expect to develop ties with the West "if
the Soviet leadership wishessimultaneously to pursue
revolutionary class struggle against the free world."
The warning came in a two-hour policy speech in
Parliament in which Kohl outlined the goals of his
center-right coalition government for the next four
years following its victory in the March 6 general elec
tion.
Kohl stressed Bonn's commitment to the Western
alliance and its ties to the United States.
Kohl said that he accepted the Soviet Union's need
for security, but added, "nothing, however, justifies
the Soviet Union's excessive armament, which threat
ens the security of its neighbors and serves the
purpose of political coercion."
He said there was no justification for Moscow's pol
icy of expansion "which led to the invasion of Afghan
istan and restricted the freedom of decision of the
Polish people. "
Reagan welcomes missile plan
Washington — President Reagan, responding
positively for the second straight day to proposals for
arms limitation, said yesterday the United States
would give "serious consideration" to Soviet leader
Yuri Andropov's proposal to count warheads rather
than missiles in the Euromissile talks in Geneva, Switz
erland, that resume in two weeks.
But he cautioned during a meeting with reporters
in his Oval Office that only through actual nego
tiations would it become known "whether this was
just propaganda or a (serious) proposal."
The day before, in response to calls by con
gressmen, Reagan signaled willingness to amend his
proposal in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks
(START) to reflect the arms-control recommenda
tions of the president's Commission on Strategic
Forces, also known as the MX Commission.
White House officials, in amplifying on the presi
dent's Tuesday actions, said yesterday that mod
ifications to the administration's START proposal may
be ready to lay before the Soviets in Geneva when the
talks resume June 8. These "technical changes," as
one administration official called them, will probably
directly affect the 850-missile ceiling in the present
U.S. offer. The administration will apparently now try

to strike a balance in the number of warheads rather
than in the number of missiles, which carry varying
loads of warheads.
Solidarity activists emigrate
Washington — Nearly 1200 Poles associated with
the banned Solidarity labor union have left their
country for resettlement here under an unusual U.S.
program, State Department officials said yesterday.
The resettlement program was started without an
nouncement last July after months of public attacks
by the United States and its allies on the Polish gov
ernment's policy of pressuring Solidarity leaders to
leave the country.
The exodus of 300 to 400 activists, accompanied by
family members, is the product of parallel actions by
the Polish government, the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw,
the Geneva-based Intergovernmental Committee for
Migration (ICM) and private sponsors here.
All of the activists served time in prison or intern
ment camps foi political activity since the martial-law
crackdown on Solidarity in December 1981.
The emigrating Poles begin the first leg of their
American journey with special "one-way passports"
valid only for departure, and West German transit vi
sas. Their first destination isa German resort hotel that
has been taken over as a receiving station by the ICM,
with U.S. financing.
Shultz brings plan to Israel
Jerusalem — The Lebanese government yesterday
approved a U.S.-mediated plan for withdrawal of Is
raeli forces from Lebanon, and Secretary of State
George Shultz immediately flew here in hope of win
ning Israel's consent to the draft agreement.
Shultz refused to predict whether his week-long
exercise in shuttle diplomacy was on the verge of suc
cess. But the mood among U.S. officials accompany
ing the secretary clearly was optimistic, and there was
expectation that the drive to win a Lebanese-Israeli
accord might be concluded when the Israeli Cabinet
meets tomorrow to consider the matter.
Shultz also announced that he will go to Damascus
Saturday to discuss the agreement with Syrian Presi
dent Hafez Assad. The Israelis have made clear that
they will not pull their forces out of Lebanon unless
Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization forces in
that country also withdraw, and there has been con
siderable skepticism in Israel about whether Assad
would cooperate.
Shultz said during the flight here, "Obviously, the
Israelis are not going to withdraw if there is no indica
tion of Syrian withdrawal.... But this is a negotiation
between Israel and Lebanon, and what the Syrian
position is, is a separate thing."
Regarding the plan approved by the Lebanese gov
ernment, one senior U.S. official said, "I can'tsee how
either side can say no to this and then defend their
position."
When reporters aboard Shultz's plane asked
whether an agreement seemed closer, Shultz replied:
"Well, sure. We have a clear, very forthcoming posi
tion from the government of Lebanon. Now we'll see

what Israel says."
After arriving here in the late afternoon, the secre
tary plunged into new talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir
and Defense Minister Moshe Arens. U.S. officials said
late yesterday night that the Israelis want to study vari
ous points in the draft more closely and said that they
would be back in touch with Shultz today.
Ruckelshaus pledges fair hiring
Washington — William Ruckelshaus, President
Reagan's choice to head the troubled Environmental
Protection Agency, promised yesterday that there
would be none of the "hit lists" for employ
ees,"sweetheart deals" with industry or political de
cisions that helped bring the downfall of his prede
cessor two months ago.
He told the Senate Environment and Public Works
Committee, which is holding hearings on his nomi
nation, that his first priority will be "to recruit the best
people I can find to manage the agency" and to re
store public trust in EPA by opening the agency's ac
tivities to scrutiny by environmentalists and other
public interest groups.
Ruckelshaus, who won effusive praise from both
Democrats and Republicans on the committee, is ex
pected to win confirmation easily.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
made a special appearance before the committee to
say that Ruckelshaus had "my unreserved con
fidence." Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) said
Ruckelshaus' "integrity is a breath of fresh air for an
agency that has been ravaged by two years of bungl
ing mismanagment."
Ruckelshaus, 50, said that he told President Reagan
that he would "do my best" to fashion policies in
keeping with the president's environmental program.
Political prisoners gain amnesty
San Salvador — El Salvador's Constituent Assembly
unanimously approved a limited amnesty yesterday
that will free about half of the country's 780 political
prisoners.
The measure also gives Salvadoran guerrillas 60
days in which to lay down their arms and to apply for
amnesty without reprisal.
In approving the government-sponsored law by a
56-0 vote, the assembly, which is El Salvador's national
Legislature, also created a national amnesty board to
guarantee the safety of guerrillas who surrender.
Yesterday's action was a clear bow toward the U.S.
Congress, which requires the Reagan administration
to certify continued improvement in human rights in
El Salvador as a condition for continuing U.S. aid to
the country.
Antonio Guevara, the Christian Democratic Party's
expert on the law, told a legislative caucus before the
vote that the amnesty would immediately affect
"about half" of the political prisoners.
In urging support for the law by the Christian Dem
ocrats, the single largest faction in the assembly,
Guevara termed it "a true contribution to pacif
ication."

The amnesty provides immediate release for all
Salvadoran nationals being held on politically related
offenses with maximum sentences of four years or
less, as well as those held for prolonged periods
without trial.
Foreigners and members of the armed forces are
specifically exempted from the amnesty, as are those
charged with "murder, kidnapping, rape or serious
terrorist acts."
Among those who will not be affected by the am
nesty are 10 soldiers and national guardsmen accused
of murdering seven Americans since 1980.
Provisions offering amnesty to active guerrillas
seems more rhetorical than substantive, and even
some legislators who supported the initiative won
dered aloud if the safety of surrendering guerrillas
could be guaranteed.
Under the law, the amnesty board is to establish in
dependent offices around the country and be made
up of representatives of the Salvadoran Peace Com
mission, the Commission on Human Rights and the
Ministry of Interior. All three are government agen
cies; the Ministry of Interior controls the Salvadoran
police.
Kirkpatrick praises rightest rebels
Los Angeles — Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, laid down in Los Angeles last
night what she called "our main goal" for the govern
ment of Nicaragua.
"Our main g0a1... is that it stop systematically sub
verting and destabilizing and trying by all means at its
disposal to make war on its neighbors — overthrow
ing the government of El Salvador, undermining the
government of Honduras and bullying the govern
ment of Costa Rica.
"We think it should stop."
She also accused Nicaragua's Sandinista govern
ment of breaking promises it had made to the Or
ganization of American States in 1979 when, she said,
they promised full respect for civil rights and demo
cratric principles.
Kirkpatrick, 56, delivered the demand at the close
of a half-hour speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs
Council, after being greeted by nearly 800 protesters
who staged a two-hour demonstration outside the
Hilton Hotel downtown, where she gave her speech.
She made the accusations when asked whether she
thought the United States had selected allies who had
credibility among Nicaraguan citizens.
