## Italian government tumbles amidst troubled economy 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
The worst always is feared in Italy, but
somehow it never seems to happen.
Last week the Italian government fell yet
again. Mount Etna was erupting. According
to official statistics, more than 2 million Ita
lians are unemployed, and inflation is run
ning at 16 percent a year.
In Franco Ferrarotti's office in the sociol
ogy department of Rome University, the
phone was ringing constantly. Hundreds of
books were stacked haphazardly on the
floor. Oblivious to the confusion around
him, Ferrarotti declared with a perfectly
straight face: "You know, I think Italy suffers
from an excess of stability."
Ferrarotti's remark and the circumstances
in which it was made capture the central
paradox of Italian life — and help explain
both its startling problems and its capacity
for survival. For all the outward appearance
of chaos, Italy is a country of enormous
inner strength that has managed to endure a
succession ot economic crises, corruption
scandals, terrorist campaigns and natural
disasters that would have triggered major
upheavals in many other countries.
The uniquely Italian phenomenon of con
tinuity amid upheaval is illustrated by the
fact that, despite having had 43 governments

since World War 11, the country still is being
run by much the same group of people as it
was 20 or even 30 years ago. And, while the
forthcoming elections in )une could pro
duce small shifts in the relative standing of
the political parties, it is a safe bet that they
will not produce any change in the overall
composition of the center-left coalition
dominated by the Christian Democrats.
This means that Italy is, and is likely to
remain, the only major country in Western
Europe not to witness a transfer of political
power as a result of the economic strains
produced by the international recession.
What could be called Italy's problem of
"chronic stability" is all the more remarka
ble if one recalls the talk about the death
throes of Italian democracy common in
Western capitals just a few years ago when
terrorism was at its height and the economy
appeared to be crumbling.
Looking back, Ferrarotti describes as
"nonsense" the "Italy in agony" stories on
the front pages of newspapers and news
magazines the world over in the late 19705.
In his opinion, the reason for their exagger
ated pessimism was that they ignored the
country's underlying strengths, notably the
importance of the Italian family, which acts
as "a shock absorber" at times of crisis.

Foreign observers in Rome tend to agree.
As an American official commented: "Ita
lians have an incredible ability to arrange
their lives in conditions that would drive
most other people crazy. This is a stronger
society than we have given it credit for."
Today, the focus of U.S. concern about
the reliability of its European allies has
shifted northward to West Germany, where
pacifists are threatening to disrupt the ex
pected deployment of cruise and Pershing II
missiles beginning at the end of this year.
Italy, by contrast, is perceived as solidly
committed to the NATO alliance, and there
has been little substantial opposition to the
planned installation of 112 cruise missiles in
Sicily.
Yet, with the exception of the defeat of
terrorist groups such as the Red Brigades,
not all that much has changed in Italy. All the
underlying causes of social frustration are
still present. Schools and prisons are over
crowded, social services are breaking down
and violent crime is increasing.
While Italy has had economy, its eco
nomic survival can be attributed at least in
part to a hidden second economy based on
moonlighting and small and medium-scale
industry. In many ways, this is the most
dynamic sector of the Italian economy —
even though it does not show up in the offi
cial statistics. It is estimated, for example,
that 5 million pairs of gloves are exported
every year from the Naples area despite the
fact that there is not a single legal glove fac
tory in the region.
Some economists estimate that Italy's ac
tual gross national product is as much as
one-third higher than officially reported. A
cursory glance at the sports cars cruising up
Rome's Via Veneto and the lavish entertain
ing in restaurants is enough to convince you
that there is an enormous amount of wealth
here. Whether it is legal or illegal, nobody
seems to care.
Even the underside of this affluence — the
grim poverty, particularly in the south, and
the high level of unemployment — is not
quite as bad as it seems. The family acts as a
built-in social security system for the young
and the old, the two groups who otherwise
would be most at risk. And many people
who are officially out of work are in fact
employed in the underground economy.
"In Italy what is important are not institu
tions but face-to-face relationships. This
makes Italian society very difficult to under
stand. What you can see on the surface is
only part of the game," Ferrarotti com
mented.
In part, Italians have themselves to blame
for the prophesies of despair about Italy that
were fashionable notsolong ago. The sense
of impending doom was heightened by the

theatricality of Italian political life and in
flated rhetoric of journalists and politicians.
Downfalls of the government, which now
occur once every eight months on average,
are announced with almost comic solemnity
in the Italian press. "The crisis will begin on
Friday" was typical of last week's banner
headlines in the newspapers, almost as
though some kind of festival was about to
get under way. On Friday, sure enough, 75-
year-old Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani —
who headed his first government in 1954 —
went to the Quirinal Palace to inform 86-
year-old President Sandro Pertini that his
latest effort had collapsed.
The fact that political commentators were
describing the situation as "exceptionally
difficult" did not prevent most politicians
from relaxing over the May Day holiday
weekend as usual with their families.
Italy's peculiar system of government by
revolving door is due in part to the strength
of the Communist Party, the second largest
party in Italy and the largest Marxist party in
the West. For all their insistence on democ
racy and attempts to distance themselves
from Moscow, the Communists still are not

trusted by most Italians as an alternative to
Christian Democratic rule. The result is that
they permanently are in the opposition and
the Christian Democrats always are in the
government.
A long-time foreign observer of the Italian
scene points out, however, that the Italian
conception of democracy differs from that
of other Western countries.
"Conventional categories of government
and opposition don't really apply here. De
cisions are taken by a kind of free-wheeling
consensus in which everybody, including
the Communists, plays a role," he said.
The Italian system of multi-layered de
mocracy, in whi~h the family plays a more
important role than the state, has its disad
vantages as well as its advantages. It has
cushioned thecountry from disasterat times
but also has acted as a barrier to political and
economic reforms and has prevented mod
ernization.
The jpshot is that this maddening, fas
cinating country is likely to go on living on
thr precipice of democratic Europe for the
'jreseeable future. But it is unlikely to fall
off.

Foreign observers in Rome tend to agree.
As an American official commented: "Ita
lians have an incredible ability to arrange
their lives in conditions that would drive
most other people crazy. This is a stronger
society than we have given it credit for."
Today, the focus of U.S. concern about
the reliability of its European allies has
shifted northward to West Germany, where
pacifists are threatening to disrupt the ex
pected deployment of cruise and Pershing II
missiles beginning at the end of this year.
Italy, by contrast, is perceived as solidly
committed to the NATO alliance, and there
has been little substantial opposition to the
planned installation of 112 cruise missiles in
Sicily.
Yet, with the exception of the defeat of
terrorist groups such as the Red Brigades,
not all that much has changed in Italy. All the
underlying causes of social frustration are
still present. Schools and prisons are over
crowded, social services are breaking down
and violent crime is increasing.
While Italy has had economy, its eco
nomic survival can be attributed at least in
part to a hidden second economy based on
moonlighting and small and medium-scale
industry. In many ways, this is the most
dynamic sector of the Italian economy —
even though it does not show up in the offi
cial statistics. It is estimated, for example,
that 5 million pairs of gloves are exported
every year from the Naples area despite the
fact that there is not a single legal glove fac
tory in the region.
Some economists estimate that Italy's ac
tual gross national product is as much as
one-third higher than officially reported. A
cursory glance at the sports cars cruising up
Rome's Via Veneto and the lavish entertain
ing in restaurants is enough to convince you
that there is an enormous amount of wealth
here. Whether it is legal or illegal, nobody
seems to care.
Even the underside of this affluence — the
grim poverty, particularly in the south, and
the high level of unemployment — is not
quite as bad as it seems. The family acts as a
built-in social security system for the young
and the old, the two groups who otherwise
would be most at risk. And many people
who are officially out of work are in fact
employed in the underground economy.
"In Italy what is important are not institu
tions but face-to-face relationships. This
makes Italian society very difficult to under
stand. What you can see on the surface is
only part of the game," Ferrarotti com
mented.
In part, Italians have themselves to blame
for the prophesies of despair about Italy that
were fashionable notsolong ago. The sense
of impending doom was heightened by the

theatricality of Italian political life and in
flated rhetoric of journalists and politicians.
Downfalls of the government, which now
occur once every eight months on average,
are announced with almost comic solemnity
in the Italian press. "The crisis will begin on
Friday" was typical of last week's banner
headlines in the newspapers, almost as
though some kind of festival was about to
get under way. On Friday, sure enough, 75-
year-old Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani —
who headed his first government in 1954 —
went to the Quirinal Palace to inform 86-
year-old President Sandro Pertini that his
latest effort had collapsed.
The fact that political commentators were
describing the situation as "exceptionally
difficult" did not prevent most politicians
from relaxing over the May Day holiday
weekend as usual with their families.
Italy's peculiar system of government by
revolving door is due in part to the strength
of the Communist Party, the second largest
party in Italy and the largest Marxist party in
the West. For all their insistence on democ
racy and attempts to distance themselves
from Moscow, the Communists still are not

trusted by most Italians as an alternative to
Christian Democratic rule. The result is that
they permanently are in the opposition and
the Christian Democrats always are in the
government.
A long-time foreign observer of the Italian
scene points out, however, that the Italian
conception of democracy differs from that
of other Western countries.
"Conventional categories of government
and opposition don't really apply here. De
cisions are taken by a kind of free-wheeling
consensus in which everybody, including
the Communists, plays a role," he said.
The Italian system of multi-layered de
mocracy, in whi~h the family plays a more
important role than the state, has its disad
vantages as well as its advantages. It has
cushioned thecountry from disasterat times
but also has acted as a barrier to political and
economic reforms and has prevented mod
ernization.
The jpshot is that this maddening, fas
cinating country is likely to go on living on
thr precipice of democratic Europe for the
'jreseeable future. But it is unlikely to fall
off.

as he leaves Chigi Palace before submitting his government resignation to Italian
President Sandro Pertine last week.
Compiled from news reports and wire services
The worst always is feared in Italy, but
somehow it never seems to happen.
Last week the Italian government fell yet
again. Mount Etna was erupting. According
to official statistics, more than 2 million Ita
lians are unemployed, and inflation is run
ning at 16 percent a year.
In Franco Ferrarotti's office in the sociol
ogy department of Rome University, the
phone was ringing constantly. Hundreds of
books were stacked haphazardly on the
floor. Oblivious to the confusion around
him, Ferrarotti declared with a perfectly
straight face: "You know, I think Italy suffers
from an excess of stability."
Ferrarotti's remark and the circumstances
in which it was made capture the central
paradox of Italian life — and help explain
both its startling problems and its capacity
for survival. For all the outward appearance
of chaos, Italy is a country of enormous
inner strength that has managed to endure a
succession ot economic crises, corruption
scandals, terrorist campaigns and natural
disasters that would have triggered major
upheavals in many other countries.
The uniquely Italian phenomenon of con
tinuity amid upheaval is illustrated by the
fact that, despite having had 43 governments

since World War 11, the country still is being
run by much the same group of people as it
was 20 or even 30 years ago. And, while the
forthcoming elections in )une could pro
duce small shifts in the relative standing of
the political parties, it is a safe bet that they
will not produce any change in the overall
composition of the center-left coalition
dominated by the Christian Democrats.
This means that Italy is, and is likely to
remain, the only major country in Western
Europe not to witness a transfer of political
power as a result of the economic strains
produced by the international recession.
What could be called Italy's problem of
"chronic stability" is all the more remarka
ble if one recalls the talk about the death
throes of Italian democracy common in
Western capitals just a few years ago when
terrorism was at its height and the economy
appeared to be crumbling.
Looking back, Ferrarotti describes as
"nonsense" the "Italy in agony" stories on
the front pages of newspapers and news
magazines the world over in the late 19705.
In his opinion, the reason for their exagger
ated pessimism was that they ignored the
country's underlying strengths, notably the
importance of the Italian family, which acts
as "a shock absorber" at times of crisis.
