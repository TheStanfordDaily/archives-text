## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
San Jose deliveryman Donald
Amos was sentenced April 22 to 15
years to life for the stabbing murder
of Stanford junior Angela Arvidson in
October. Amos will also serve three
years on a stolen property charge,
eight months on a concealed arms
charge and an additional year on an
arms allegation.
"He got what he deserved," said
Santa Clara County Superior Court
Judge John Kennedy. Amos, who
committed the murder while on pro
bation, had shown a "high degree of
cruelty and viciousness," Kennedy
said. Amos also had a long history of
extensive alcohol and narcotic use
and had committed "sophisticated
offenses" in the past, he added.
"I gave him the maximum sen
tence under the law," Kennedy said.

Arvidson, 20, was killed on Oct. 22
at the home ot Medical School Prof.
Laurence Kedes, where she did part
time housecleaning. She died of stab
wounds to the throat, chest and ab
domen. Kedes' 16-year-old son Todd
discovered the body when he re
turned home from school that day.
During the trial, the prosecution
argued that Amos had killed Arvid
son while he was deliveringtrash can
liners to the Kedes' home, stabbing
her possibly during an attempted
rape. The defense maintained that
Amos had suffered an alcohol
induced blackout at the time of the
killing. It was not until he was in cus
tody that he began to remember en
tering the Kedes' home and seeing a
bloody body lying on the floor, ac
cording to Deputy Public Defender
Randall Schneider. After the convic
tion the defense had been hampered
bv the judge's restrictions on intro

ducing evidence, Schneider added.
Arlene Torrey, Angela's mother,
said the Torreys had traveled frgm
their Portland, Oregon home to wit
ness sentencing, "just to go through
the process."
Torrey said, "My husband and I,
Angela's brother Randy, and some of
Angela's friends were there, includ
ing Mrs. Nedes." bhe expresseu ner
feelingabout the trial in a letter to the
judge, published in the probationary
report, and she had no additional
statements to make to the press, she
explained.
"After the trial, they (the press)
came over and we went the other
way," she said. "We felt we had noth
ing more to say." She did say, how
ever, that she felt the court had done
a "very professional job," and that
she was glad the proceedings were
over.
