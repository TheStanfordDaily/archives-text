# Hoover petition on agenda
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
A faculty petition urging the board
of trustees to inquire into the rela
tionship between the Hoover Institu
tion and the University will be dis
cussed by the faculty senate May 26,
according to the senate steering
committee.
The petition signed by 69
Academic Council members, states
that "the existence of a partisan re
search and policy organization,
whether liberal or conservative,
within the University, raises serious
questions concerning the academic
independence, integrity and reputa
tion of the University." Fifty names
were needed to bring the petition up
for debate before the senate.
"Political Science Prof. John Man
ley, one of the initiators of the peti
tion drive, said the names of those
faculty members signing the petition
will not be disclosed. The signers
were not told their identity would be
made public, he said.
Robert Rosenzweig, president of
the American Association of Univer
sities and former vice-president for
public affairs here, said he finds it
"ironic" that initiators of the petition
charge Hoover with beinga "partisan
political institution," while maintain
ing that the issues raised do not con
cern the politics of "individual mem
bers" of the institution.
Rosenzweig, who served as a
liaison between Hoover and the Uni
versity president for 12 years, said it
is interesting that the names of those
faculty members supporting the in
quiry will not be disclosed.
Calling the political charges
against the Hoover Institution a
"charade," Rosenzweig said that the
political motives behind the inquiry
represent "a double standard—a
game that the 'ins' historically play
with the 'outs' in politics."
"The fact is, people at Hoover are
free to pursue any political line they
want—just as people at the Univer
sity are," he said. Referring to Man
ley's statement that Hoover repre
sents "disproportionately. . . .a par
ticular view," Rosenzweig said he
would like to "know what is the right
proportion ot of particular views"
and how one would go about ensur
ing that they are represented.
The real question according to
Rosenzweig, is whether Hoover
scholars are good scholars and
whether their work is acceptable.
The answer to that question is
mixed, he said. "Some of the work
is good and some is less good."
While Rosenzweig said he believes
that those requesting the inquiry
against Hoover are raising the wrong
questions, he said "there are some
real problems" with the institution.
The sense of hostility and separate
ness" between Hoover and some
members of the University commu
nity has "inhibited intellectual
growth," he said.
I thought we had started along
the road to solving the problem by
the increased number of joint
appointments—the problem is not
that Hoover is too close, but that it
isn't close enough," he said.
In a nine-page memo to be distri
buted among members of the Faculty
Senate, Manley and English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz addressed "the tone
of the Hoover Institution's re
sponse" to the petition. According to
Manley and Rebholz, Director VV.
Glenn Campbell's leveling of term
"character assassination charges" at
those who raised questions about
Hoover, has lowered the level of de
bate to a liberal "witch hunt" and
"guilt by association."

"No one expected Hoover to like
the petition, but in an academic
community, when questions are
raised for discussion, shouldn't
some effort be made to discuss them
as really presented?" Manley and
Rebholz asked. "Such legitimate
questions are not an example of
McCarthyism," but "pose serious is
sues for this University" the memo
continued.
The major concerns ot those who
have called for an inquiry include:
• Does the Hoover Institution re
ceive millions ot dollars from private
sources outside the University, and
from private funds earmarked for
Hoover but administered by the Uni
versity, and, if so, who gives this
money, why do they give it, and who
decides how it is used?
• If only one-third of Hoover's
budget ($2.7 million) goes to the
Hoover library, what sort of activities
are tunded by the remaining two
thirds ($5.7 million)? and would
those who supply the money con
tinue to do so if Hoover were in fact

nonpartisan?
• Dot's the Hoover Institution, as
suggested in its own 1981 and 1982
Annual Reports, engage in political
and partisan activities of concern to
the broader Stanford community?
• And finally, to the extent that
such activities are found, by objec
tive investigation, to exist, are they
compatible with Stanford's national
reputation?
In response to whether the con
cerns posed seem valid or not,
Rosenzweig said that it the peti
tioners had wanted to know the
sources of money funding the in
stitution, the purposes for which it
was designated, and the ways in
which it was designated and the ways
in which it was finally spent, they
could have found out. "It seems they
are mainly interested in making
some debating point," Rosenzweig
said.
But according to Vice-Provost Ray
Bacchetti, it is a general practice for
the University not to reveal the
names of donors, or tho designated
purposes for which gifts are spent.
General Secretary of the Office of
Development Daryl Pearson said that
the University does not set rules as to
what makes a gift acceptable or not.
"But we could never accept any gift
that was politically partisan," he said.
A politically partisan gift would be
defined as money given for the pur
pose of researi h espousing a particu
lar political point of view, Pearson
explained.
"Of course, the University will not
accept funds for politically partisan
purposes. . . .but that doesn't mean
that individuals don't do things on
behalf of the administration,"
Rosenzweig said.

against Hoover are raising the wrong
questions, he said "there are some
real problems" with the institution.
The sense of hostility and separate
ness" between Hoover and some
members of the University commu
nity has "inhibited intellectual
growth," he said.
I thought we had started along
the road to solving the problem by
the increased number of joint
appointments—the problem is not
that Hoover is too close, but that it
isn't close enough," he said.
In a nine-page memo to be distri
buted among members of the Faculty
Senate, Manley and English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz addressed "the tone
of the Hoover Institution's re
sponse" to the petition. According to
Manley and Rebholz, Director VV.
Glenn Campbell's leveling of term
"character assassination charges" at
those who raised questions about
Hoover, has lowered the level of de
bate to a liberal "witch hunt" and
"guilt by association."

"No one expected Hoover to like
the petition, but in an academic
community, when questions are
raised for discussion, shouldn't
some effort be made to discuss them
as really presented?" Manley and
Rebholz asked. "Such legitimate
questions are not an example of
McCarthyism," but "pose serious is
sues for this University" the memo
continued.
The major concerns ot those who
have called for an inquiry include:
• Does the Hoover Institution re
ceive millions ot dollars from private
sources outside the University, and
from private funds earmarked for
Hoover but administered by the Uni
versity, and, if so, who gives this
money, why do they give it, and who
decides how it is used?
• If only one-third of Hoover's
budget ($2.7 million) goes to the
Hoover library, what sort of activities
are tunded by the remaining two
thirds ($5.7 million)? and would
those who supply the money con
tinue to do so if Hoover were in fact

nonpartisan?
• Dot's the Hoover Institution, as
suggested in its own 1981 and 1982
Annual Reports, engage in political
and partisan activities of concern to
the broader Stanford community?
• And finally, to the extent that
such activities are found, by objec
tive investigation, to exist, are they
compatible with Stanford's national
reputation?
In response to whether the con
cerns posed seem valid or not,
Rosenzweig said that it the peti
tioners had wanted to know the
sources of money funding the in
stitution, the purposes for which it
was designated, and the ways in
which it was designated and the ways
in which it was finally spent, they
could have found out. "It seems they
are mainly interested in making
some debating point," Rosenzweig
said.
But according to Vice-Provost Ray
Bacchetti, it is a general practice for
the University not to reveal the
names of donors, or tho designated
purposes for which gifts are spent.
General Secretary of the Office of
Development Daryl Pearson said that
the University does not set rules as to
what makes a gift acceptable or not.
"But we could never accept any gift
that was politically partisan," he said.
A politically partisan gift would be
defined as money given for the pur
pose of researi h espousing a particu
lar political point of view, Pearson
explained.
"Of course, the University will not
accept funds for politically partisan
purposes. . . .but that doesn't mean
that individuals don't do things on
behalf of the administration,"
Rosenzweig said.

A faculty petition urging the board
of trustees to inquire into the rela
tionship between the Hoover Institu
tion and the University will be dis
cussed by the faculty senate May 26,
according to the senate steering
committee.
The petition signed by 69
Academic Council members, states
that "the existence of a partisan re
search and policy organization,
whether liberal or conservative,
within the University, raises serious
questions concerning the academic
independence, integrity and reputa
tion of the University." Fifty names
were needed to bring the petition up
for debate before the senate.
"Political Science Prof. John Man
ley, one of the initiators of the peti
tion drive, said the names of those
faculty members signing the petition
will not be disclosed. The signers
were not told their identity would be
made public, he said.
Robert Rosenzweig, president of
the American Association of Univer
sities and former vice-president for
public affairs here, said he finds it
"ironic" that initiators of the petition
charge Hoover with beinga "partisan
political institution," while maintain
ing that the issues raised do not con
cern the politics of "individual mem
bers" of the institution.
Rosenzweig, who served as a
liaison between Hoover and the Uni
versity president for 12 years, said it
is interesting that the names of those
faculty members supporting the in
quiry will not be disclosed.
Calling the political charges
against the Hoover Institution a
"charade," Rosenzweig said that the
political motives behind the inquiry
represent "a double standard—a
game that the 'ins' historically play
with the 'outs' in politics."
"The fact is, people at Hoover are
free to pursue any political line they
want—just as people at the Univer
sity are," he said. Referring to Man
ley's statement that Hoover repre
sents "disproportionately. . . .a par
ticular view," Rosenzweig said he
would like to "know what is the right
proportion ot of particular views"
and how one would go about ensur
ing that they are represented.
The real question according to
Rosenzweig, is whether Hoover
scholars are good scholars and
whether their work is acceptable.
The answer to that question is
mixed, he said. "Some of the work
is good and some is less good."
While Rosenzweig said he believes
that those requesting the inquiry
against Hoover are raising the wrong
questions, he said "there are some
real problems" with the institution.
The sense of hostility and separate
