Why doesn't Meyer Li
brary use its doors facing the
Law Schoolf It seems stupid
that they built that osten
tatious walkway and no one
uses it.
— Stuck in the Mire
According to Elizabeth
Salzer, Meyer head librar
ian, those doors were used
back when the library
opened in November, 1966.
Problem was, to be used as
an exit they had to be staffed
with portal monitors, and
portal monitors have to be
paid (and did you knowthat
portal monitors are union
employees, while library
staff workers are not?).
When the University went
through it's late '60s-early
70s budget crisis (the one
before the present one) the
library was asked to come
up with possible cuts, and

they cut upstairs portal
monitors. The doors con
tinued to be used for a while
as an entrance, but students
continued to use them as an
exit when they weren't sup
posed to, so the doors were
closed altogether and have
been ever since. (The portal
booth remained until the
second floor was re
modeled in 1979.) The doors
can still be used in case of
fire or other emergency, al
though Salzer said she's
been told that in the event
of an earthquake the walk
way may pull away from the
doors, leaving a severe first
step.
Salzer said there wasn't
much out there when the
doors were closed — no Law
School, no CERAS. It was
thought that the heaviest
undergraduate traffic

would run east-west from
the dorms to the Quad and
back again, which sounds
reasonable to me. Besides,
the walkway is still used —
people will be sunbathing
and studying on it before
long, and it's often the last
hole of frisbee golf courses.
Why do the folks at Tres
idder Union lock the glass
double doors right across
from the Rec Center desk?
The doors were open last
year, but this year they're
closed, and a sign reroutes
users to the far end of the
building toward the Alumni
House. That sign also piques
my curiosity, as every fre
quent user of the building
knows you walk right
through the "Coffee House
shortcut" to circumvent the
detour.

Women seem to be in
charge of all the places that
have unused doors. Cheryl
St. Clair, manager of the
Tresidder Recreation Cen
ter, told me the front doors
there will be opened again,
"probably within the next
couple weeks." They were
closed, she said, to prevent
Rec Center traffic from
crossing the Coffee House's
outdoor patio (which ex
plains the sign). But — you
won't believe this — every
frequent user of (he build
ing knows you walk right
through the Coffee House
to circumvent the detour!
St. Clair said as many people
cut through the patio any
way on their way to the Rec
Center as would if the doors
were open, so, they're
going to open the doors.
Kapish?
