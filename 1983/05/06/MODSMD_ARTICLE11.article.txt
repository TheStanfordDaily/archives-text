## The 						Stanford Daily A 						bit under the weather 
### 
Somehow all the joy and wonderment of
spring at Stanford is dashed when you discover
mold growing under your bicycle seat.
- disillusioned student
A large low-pressure system has dominated
Northern California's weather pattern for the
past several months, attracting a series of
moisture-laden fronts which have deposited
precipitation at levels unprecendented in the
state's meteoiological history. To put it bluntly,
spring quarter has been called due to rain.
The quarter began with a sense of good
natured, albeit less-than-enthusiastic, accep
tance of a few hold-out thundershowers from
the winter storm season. At times it can be just
as satisfying to lie in bed and listen to the rain as
to sprawl on the grass and soak up sun. Nature
seemed to offer us one last chance to splash
through puddles before getting down to serious
tanning.
But, apparently, the sun hasn't been in the
stars for Stanford, and its continued absence
has wreaked considerable havoc on the physical
and spiritual state of the Farm. The only mem
bers of the Stanford community who seem to
have gained advantage from the weather are
fish-belly white outcroppings of fungi, large,

aggressive amphibians and a particularly sticky
breed of California mud.
For the rest of us, a spirit of resistance (water
resistance?) has predominated. The brief,
weekly flashes of sun reveal a bloom of colorful
skirts, shorts and sandals. Plucky professors
hold outdoor classes in all but the most incle
ment of weather. Spring social events, such as
Aqua-Folliesand the Donner Street Dance, have
been attended enthusiastically despite the con
stant drizzle. But when the skies open up in
earnest, only the carefree and the soon-to-be
sick can carry on a pretense of spring quarter
activities.
The rains have even guaranteed that Lake
Lagunita, the center of spring activities at Stan
ford, will be out of operation well before com
mencement. No, the lake is in no danger of
flooding its banks. A rain-induced mud-slide
diverted a major inlet to the lake; Cheryl Jen
sen, manager of water-technical services, pre
dicts "a very low lake" by the end of spring.
It hardly seems fair, does it? But then, who
said life is fair? All you can do is to take advan
tage of each ray of sun. . .and keep an umbrella
handv.
