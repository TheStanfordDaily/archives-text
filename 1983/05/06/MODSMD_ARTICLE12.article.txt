## War would cost far too much 
### 
Arms control has lost the sense of
urgency which nuclear weapons ini
tially imparted to the field. To be
sure, there are many learned schol
ars who are specialists in one aspect
or another of the discipline. And the
daily ruminations of the bureaucracy
are often afforded a page — usually
the fourth—of The New York Times.
We are kept well appraised of the
prospects for success in "the negoti
ations," whether they are gloomy or
promising. Either way, we anticipate
little change.
We expect to need new arms —
somewhat more or somewhat less —
and more people to speak of control
ling them. All the while we expect to
remain imperiled and to expend our
best efforts to ensure that others are
as well. In flights of fancy we some
times speak as though we might be
come so adept at waging war that we
would be invulnerable, but we do
not really believe that. If there were
such a clever way of removing the
threat, then surely there must be
some other clever means of re
engaging it. No, we do not expect
things to get much better.
We have lost focus of what it is that
we must accomplish. Means taken to
avoid war this year and perhaps again
the next are now defined as arms
control. The moral imperative of dis
armament has been abandoned and
in its place we have substituted the
art of managing the nuclear arsenals
at their present murderous levels. It
is of course true that this art must
continue to serve us: deterrence
must work. A war involving the pre
sent arsenals could not be judged as
just regardless of the rationale upon
which the war was based. But we
must begin to do better than merely
avoiding war. Even if it could be ana
lytically demonstrated that a con
tinuation of the arms race could en
sure stability, we should refrain from
it. It is a crime against our culture to
devote so much of our talent to the
art of killing. It is also a crime against
the holders of that talent.
Who am I to speak on matters of
war and peace; issues which have
drawn the attention of our most care
ful thinkers and yet resist progress. I
have no authority, nor am I certain
what ought to be done. I can only
speak honestly of the pain of in
volvement and on the basis of the
most careful thought of which I am
capable.
I spent a little more than two years
as a staff specialist at Sandia National
Laboratory. I do not pretend to have
made significant contributions; I did
not. Still, it was a part of my job to
consider how best to make the com
ing generations of nuclear weapons
more adroit killers than those now in
service. Of course that is not how
you phrase things when you are
doing the work and indeed that is not
always the technical focus of the ef
fort. Nonetheless that is the funda
mental goal.

Such work is not easy. Arcane
theories of deterrence do not soften
the contrast between an afternoon
discussion on the merits of dial-a
yield as a means of reducing gratuit
ous collateral damage (euphemisms
are very important) and an evening of
reflection on the genius of Tolstoy,
Einstein, Beethoven or even Julius
Erving. A harsh duality is enforced:
there is no connection between
work and the rest of one's life.
It is of course possible to sustain
many of the professional vanities
working on nuclear weapons. There
is pride in craftsmanship. For some,
there is the sense of satisfying duty.
At times there can be the joy of fresh
insight. But for many, there is recoil
from the final product. It is not pleas
ant to recognize the link between the
weapons and one's labor. No one
particularly cares to shoulder the re
sponsibility for the creation,
stockpiling and certainly not the use
of nuclear weapons. At best the
building of nuclear weapons is an
uneasy alliance of science and con
science and it is painful when there
can be no reconciliation.
This duality of life and work is cer
tainly sharpest when experienced at
the personal level. Nonetheless,
there is a similar split prevalant in our
society as a whole. We speak on the
one hand of our values, our integrity
and our freedoms as Americans. On
the other we speak of our struggle
against evil, of the necessity of de
fending our way of life. For this end,
we must arm ourselves mightily. We
do not like to recognize the link be
teen the two hands: actions on one
nd are not supposed to affect the
other. We do not want our culture
and our values to be defined in terms
of our militarism or our nuclear
posture. We want to believe that our
defense effort can be made ever
larger without affecting our cultural
health. This separation of our society
and our preparations for war is false,
even if pleasant.
It is a sobering reflection of the
depth of our dilemma that many
thousands of people are engaged in
one aspect or another of the nuclear
weapons business. Millions more
work in the development of other
instruments of war. These people are
not evil, nor narrow-minded, nor
lacking compassion. At least, they
are no more these things than people
from any other element of our soci
ety. Many of the most thoughtful and
humane people I know are working
within weapons laboratories.
But we must be careful. The fact
that the militarization of our society
is so pervasive and has captured so
many of our most talented people
does not imply that the present situa
tion is either acceptable or immuta
ble.
So, what are we to do? Assume for
the moment that we can all agree that
continuing our present course with
regard to nuclear arms is immoral

and is increasingly leading us toward
a benighted culture. How would that
consensus help us make decisions?
Back up one step further. Who
should make moral decisions? Is it
our leaders only, or must we all
shoulder some responsibility? And
what does morality have to do with
the MX, the Cruise missile, El Sal
vador or troop levels inEuropeinany
case? Are these not sober security
issues which ought to be considered
with passionless pragmatism? Is the
man who bolts the last component to
the shining new warhead committing
a crime against humanity while he
who idles away time devising
theories of deterrence is serving the
cause of peace? Is just the opposite
true?
These are not easy questions. They
are not even well posed and that is a
part of the problem. It is not evident
how morality can affect decisions re
garding military hardware and na
tional security.
But if it does not, it means little that
we recognize our problem, and en
gaging in the debate is little more
than a palliative to our consciences. I
have not yet surrendered hope that
we might do better than we have till
now but I do not harbor the illusion
that it will be easy. It is foolish to
believe that our security could be
enhanced without an abatement of
our militarism. The realities of nu
clear war will not allow that. It is
naive, though, to presume that the
decisions required to enable that
abatement will not involve risk. They
are risks which we must begin to
take.
The task before us is frightening. We
must lead the world away from war
and once again treat disarmament as
a goal and not merely a vision. And
yes, we must maintain a stable deter
rent along the way, though we must
ensure that pursuing that deterrent
does not serve as an excuse for
futher armaments. What is most dif
ficult and discouraging is that we
must start from where we now are.
But we must not be daunted by the
enormity of the task, nor by the ap
parent insignificance of any realiza
ble step in comparison with the goal.
Rather, we must be spurred by the
enormity of failure.
We will need visionaries to inspire
us with visions more pleasing than
our plight. We will need dissent,
even protest, to ensure that we do
not weaken in commitment. Perhaps
most important, we will need to in
fuse our institutions with individuals
of greater courage. There will be bic
kering, foolishness and compromise
as always and the consequences of
some wise decisions will be severe.
To make these decisions great cour
age will be required. But the time has
come when we ought to take risks on
the side of peace, not war.
