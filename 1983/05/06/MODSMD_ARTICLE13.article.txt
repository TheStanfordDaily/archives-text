# An incredible offer!
## 
### 
The generation gap. The credibility gap. And now, the opinions gap.
We're not asking you to solve the first two, but you can do your share in
fighting the third.
How, you say? We//, it's pretty easy. All you have to do is bring your
viewpoint or letter to the Daily office and leave it in the opinion editors'
mailbox.
But wait, there's more. Please type your viewpoint or letter double
spaced on a 57-character line, and please keep both letters and view
points as brief as possible so the Daily can present as wide a variety of
views as possible.
With each selected entry, we can offer its author's views to the whole
community on this page with the name in print. Act now, while the offer,
and the quarter lasts.
