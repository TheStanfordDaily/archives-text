# Having parents and being one
## 
### 
You have parents! ?! Horrors, what
a terrible thing to have!
Becoming adults, hopefully we
have started to understand the rela
tionship between ourselves and
Mom and Dad, and we have heard a
lot about the parents of our friends.
At best, this gives us a casual feeling
about how we should handle our
kids.
Some of us envy warm stories
about parents who make it easy for
their kids to be open with them. It
seems there is nothing more consol
ing than parents who are good
friends. If we are not going to be
child beaters, incestuous or negli
gent — fine. But we can still be cruel.
Any ignorance about ourselves, our
morals, motives or expectations, is a
black eye on our child's face. Some
of us hear stories about a tremen
dous diversity of what I call psycho
logical crimes. Too much mistrust, of
anyone, not just family, and also feel
ings of emptiness or worthlessness
— call it lack of self-contentment —
come straight from immature par
ents. They are not role models, but
role predictors. Our childrens' lives
are reactions to our own lives, not
reflections of them.
Exactly why would we want expen
sive crying kids, anyway? Aside from
the genetic manipulations
soc/obio/ogists tell us about, there
are seven justifications to consider
(both latent and apparent). We may
have kids: 1) to give ourselves an as
surance of continued life, in the form
of genetic and ideologically similar
offspring, after we're dead (surro
gate immortality), 2) to give a child or
two the chance to benefit from our
wisdom and tender loving care (pro
tectiveness), 3) to do a better job
than our parents did with us, possi
bly proving they were wrong, justify
ing our reactions to them (competi
tive correction), 4) to produce some
thing we have control over, some
thing that should respect us ulti
mately (power), 5) to keep our
spouse attached to us with this
mutual concern, a kid (marital secu
rity), 6) to fit into the status quo:
everyone seems to have children
(laziness) and/or 7) to give birth to a
new friend and companion who is
nothing like ourselves (mutual love).
The first six motives stem from in
securities only. The seventh is the
only one that comes from insecurity

and confidence. Insecurity? It's im
portant to have our self-appreciation
confirmed by people we respect,
hence, we need friends — wife, col
leagues and kids — to love us. This is
natural insecurity (opposed to total
self-reliance). Confidence? To value
our children's lives independently
from our own, to respect their sub
jective decisions free from our ex
pectations of what this son or daugh
ter should be — in other words to
appreciate them objectively, as if
they were nothing like ourselves — is
all confidence. Remember, self
respecting parents will have kids
who develop their own egos, not the
creators'.
We probably should not view chil
dren as a half of ourselves whose
purpose in life is either to follow in
our footsteps or make their footsteps
deeper than ours, avoiding our mis
takes. That is too much unnecessary
responsibility and later, guilt. Our
kids' lives are not a second chance at
our lives. Our "if onlys" are different
from others, so we can't assume a kid
would wish they had taken our "if
only" roads. If you yell at your child
or hit your child, ask whether you are
punishing yourself, too.
Modern social-psychologists are,
by the way, becoming convinced that
a "time-out" procedure is a more ef
fective "punishment" than yelling,
hitting or grounding. The idea is that
a healthy child's irresponsibilities are
either tests of the order or just de
signed to get attention. Angry par
ents, though frightening, do give the
child the attention that was asked for
and force a reiteration of rules
"Time-out" means the kids are sent
to a room by themselves for five
minutes (with an additional five for
each objection). This not only gives
everyone a chance to settle down but
it deprives kids of the society they
were manipulating. This won't rein
force their irresponsibility.
Parents. There are too many tears
created (and those who can cry are
lucky) from their intangible influ
ence that often stands in the way of
even adults, keeping us from re
specting our judgments and desires,
keeping us from thinking we deserve
the pleasures we can seize. Parents
are tyrants, whether good or bad tyr
ants, possessing the tremendous
power we will soon inherit. The age
and experience the giants have never

mend their personal insecurities—
only feeling, thinking and discussing
can. Their quirks can take the form of
manipulations ranging from a bit of
martyrdom to useless cruelty. But all
we see is a giant. There are as many
perversities in parents as there are
personalities.
A number of us here are working
to forget. We should remember be
fore our first one screams for us.
Honesty, communication, open
ness, straightforwardness, etc., are
all terms we seem to think are impor
tant, but have no understanding of
their meaning or use. The first seri
ous flaw a parent can have is often an
uptightness or prudishness over cer
tain values. If we create an orderly
world for our kids, and we are impa
tient about our kids' experiments
with it, we instantly lose their friend
ship to equally experimental peers
instead of sharing their break
throughs. It takes an unfortunately
rare openness with ourselves and
with our kids to deserve their friend
ship. Otherwise, our subjective
moral code can, especially if we
aren't good with challenges to it, di
rectly cause the classic tiptoeing
around, fear of our god-like wrath.
What stops us from asking one of
our pals, "What do you think about
sex? Have you felt it yet?", "Why are
you working so hard in school?",
"Have you had any good experiences
with drugs?", "Ever wanted to steal
anything?" or just "What keeps you
alive, kid?" The person who is com
fortable asking these questions will
not need to. We can have a friend
who keeps us posted on the dilem
mas and who may even want to keep
posted on ours. If we can smile while
asking these questions we have al
ready been very honest with ourse
lves: we appreciate that our values
and expectations are far less impor
tant than the child who comes and
says, "Hey, I've really messed up, I
think. I need your help." Their solu
tions are what count and the sooner
they are confident in their own prob
lem solving ability the better, but
they'll always need a good listener —
why not us? Ephemeral morals and our
lack of self-satisfaction measure the
distance we will be from our chil
dren.
Have a happy Mother's Day.
