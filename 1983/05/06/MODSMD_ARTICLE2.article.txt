About 120 demonstrators smeared
an oversized "Federal Reserve note"
with red paint in an expression of
solidarity with the people of El Sal
vador as part of a Cinco de Mayo rally
here yesterday.
The demonstration took place in
front of the campus home of Secre
tary of State George Shultz, where
students marched following a rally in
White Plaza. The note was marked $1
billion to represent the amount of
military aid to El Salvador since Presi
dent Reagan took office. As de
monstrators came forward to dip
their hands in the paint, the group
chanted "Reagan and Shultz have
bloody hands; Stop oppression in
southern lands!"

Network (SCAAN) and MEChA yesterday.
ral America, focusingon Shultz's role
in perpetuating U.S. involvement in
the region.
Rally organizers stressed that be
cause of Shultz's affiliation with Stan
ford, as a faculty member in the
Business School and the University's
1983 Commencement speaker,
people in the Stanford community
"have a special responsibility to
make our views known to him," and
that he, in turn, "should consider
himself particularly accountable to
us."
Olga Talamante, former Argentine
political prisoner and the featured
speaker, and organizer David Ayon
denounced the current administra
tion's interventionist policies. Ayon
insisted upon Shultz's "personal re
sponsibility" for the situation in

Central America, and spoke of the
disappointment felt by many Ameri
cans who had anticipated a change in
policy when "the mild-mannered
professor replaced the bombastic
ex-general."
"We must refuse complicity with
the continuing atrocities caused by
our government in Central
America," Ayon said. Expressing op
position is not only "appropriate and
necessary" but also urgent, accord
ing to Ayon.
Talamante, who opened the dem
onstration, called to mind the event
which Cinco de Mayo commemo
rates, the victory of the Mexican pat
riots over the French imperialist ar
mies of Napoleon 111. "The history of
the Americas has been written on the
battlefields," she said,
Talamante spoke of her visit to
Nicaragua in January, enumerating
the many violations against the San
dinista government by counter

revolutionaries financed with U.S.
dollars. Talamante acknowledged
that the United States has not yet
sent "a direct invasion army, but they
have outfitted a surrogate army for
U.S. interests."
Following Ayon's and Talamante's
speeches, and a dance performance
by the Balet Folklorico de Estanford,
about two-thirds of the group
marched from White Plaza and down
Mayfield Avenue, chanting slogans
such as "Reagan, Shultz, CIA; Send
ing arms is not the way!"
When the demonstrators arrived at
Shultz's home, SCAAN member
Charles Hale read a letter written to
Shultz explaining the group's posi
tion. He also read a petition signed
by more than 1000 members of the
Stanford community since the start
of a petition drive two weeks ago.
The petition makes three demands of
Shultz:
• Stop all military aid to El Salvador

until the government agrees to
negotiate with all parties involved in
the conflict.
• End CIA covert action against the
Nicaraguan government.
• Comply with U.S. policy estab
lished under the Carter administra
tion to eliminate all military aid to
Guatemala because of persistent
human rights violations.
Freshman Republican Zschau will
cast a swing vote in the upcoming
House Foreign Affairs Committee's
consideration of a total Central
American aid package.
The organizers hoped actions such
as yesterday's rally and march here
may have some influence on the
committee's vote concerning the
elimination of covert aid to
Nicaragua, the reduction of aid to El
Salvador, and the end to military aid
in Guatemala. Those votes are
scheduled for next week.
