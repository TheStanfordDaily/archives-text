rhe Flower of the Republic
Raymond Kennedy
Alfred A. Knopf, $11.95
To begin with, Raymond Kennedy's The Flower of the
Republic is not a usual book. It is decidedly unusual. But
that doesn't mean it is not also very, very readable.
I he surface plot of the novel revolves around the main
character Homer Prudhomme, a wandering professor
conducting a story-telling odyssey into his past as he
searches New England for his missing wife. We first
eik ounter Prudhomme in a Virginia bar, enthusiastically
complaining practically raving — about his missing
family and lite. Indeed Homer "raves" throughout most
of the book. It is in this bar that Homer meets Pansy
Iruax, a woman of "incredible proportions," and be
comes her stay-at-home paramour. After this scene,
which, though odd, seems at least grounded in the
world as we know it, Homer responds to everyone and
everything with fantastic stories about his family, and it
becomes increasingly clear that New England is The
I /owe/ of the Republic is not quite the New England we
may be ac< ustomed to.
I or instant e, there is an unexplained sex role reversal
throughout the book; that is, women constantly treating
husbands as "the little wife," and men acting that way, as
does the husband of Mrs. French — a businesswoman
who takes a fancy to Homer — Nigel, who is always off
with gangs of virile young college women or batting his
eyelashes in bars. Or Pansy, who wants to set
Prudhomme up on a farm where she will give him "pin
money tor notions," and he should let Pansy do all the
heavy work while he keeps a little flower garden.
the other level of the plot revolves around Homer's
stories, which make up the better part of the book. The
stories seem fantastical, and very related to mythology.
Homer's wite was a victim and later an accomplice in
father-daughter incest, "Hell's princess," he calls her;
his mother's sister Daphne was attacked by bees and had
to wear a mask for the rest of her life after giving birth to
the son ot her sister's husband, Homer's father. "I al

ways imagined that tar back in the deep recesses of
Daphne's beautiful head there were bees!' Homer says.
Homer's flowery style and exclamations heighten the
•ales until they arc a new mythology; indeed he con
stantly reminds us that "times were different then, ' th.it
his stories take place in a kind ot rural twilight before the
war. However, there is an obvious connection with
(i reek mythology as well (We can't ignore Horner's lir si
name, and in fact the blurb on the jacket suuuests look

ing al Prudhomine as "a Now Fngland Ulysses.") II
Homer is making an odyssey of sorts, it is an odyssey o)
the mind more than the physical journey through New
I ngland. All his life Homer has been a sort of rec eptacle
for other people's stories. Now full, the stories just seem
to spill out ot him as it by talking he could find what he
was searching tor
As Homer goes deeper into the background of his
stories, he seems to retreat from the material world,
until he responds to virtualh everything with a tale. Yet

none o! the c harac ters around him seem to notice, be
som! tlx 1 level that he may talk a little too much. In fact,
most of the characters seem drawn and entertained by
Homer's lyric ism. For instance, when Homer describes
the daughter he had tli.it lived "about as long as it takes
to dunk a cup of coffee,' he concludes,
on iv,in) ,i lonely night, while sitting under

outside m\ window, I saw her in the shadow of my
hooki.tse, or here, he said, extending his palm down

Homer's tales might seem merely strange perhaps or
even dightlv mad if juxtaposed against our everyday
world but in the world in which we see him they seem
oniehow to tit It is a world enough like ours to make his
tones powerful, but just different enough to make
th- mi oddh enough lyrical, and to give them an extra
depth and symbolism.
Ihi book ends oddly yet satisfyingly. One is left with
doubts, about the reality" of the tales, about what has
re.illv happened in the end, but the doubts them
■el es are nec essarv perhaps this questioningof human
reality is what the book is about.
lor .ill its depth and symbolism — this reviewer is
positive she didn't understand all of the significance and
( onnei tions in the book — The Flower of the Republic is
remarkably enjoyable reading. The characters are well
drawn and tunny and Kennedy's prose style is nothing
short of wonderful. And besides all that there are the
tales the tales that keep you saying, "what happens
nextr , the tales that make the book impossible to put
down. A really excellent book, the type of book you
would read in one afternoon—l did.
