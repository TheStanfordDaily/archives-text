# A
						paperback festival: 'Just what is that book you're reading?'
## 
### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
I her e comes a time in
everyone's life when they are
forced to read a book they
would not otherwise glance at.
Sometimes it happens in an
airport, sometimes in tin" early
morning hours before a big
test. It's likely that Abraham
I iiu oln, procrastinating before
writing his speech, read the
latest "penny dreadful" at
home in Washington, forcing
him to hastily scribble his
speech on the back of an en
velope on the red-eye express
train to (.ettysburg.
Given that these books are a
fact of life, it is in a spirit of

public service that the Ihiily
chooses to break from its nor
mal habit of criticizing the
best-sellers and plant care
books that are our strength and
spend some time on the books
that are read and not just kept
on shelves and coffee tables.
So here follow three reviews of
some paperbacks, each shin
ing examples of the genus
"paperback.
I ho Flfstom's of Shannara
Terry Books
Del Rey/Ballanline Books $9.50
Although this book is strictly
called an "oversize," and
might as well be further

clarified as "overprice," this
book is bound in the finest
paper, and boasts a total am
biance of airport stores and
spinning drugstore racks. The
book itself is a sequel to a pre
ceding book called The Sword
of Shannara, and two charac
ters have survived the transi
tion.
There are always dangers to
sequels, but this book skirts
the most common, preventing
a repetition of the same story
about characters on a quest
accompanied by a mage by in
stead presenting us with the
tale of two characters on a

quest with the implicit guid
ance of a inage.
The story deals with the
search for a new seed ot the
Ellcrys tree, that tree having
been the guardian keeping
demons, goblins and used car
salesmen out of the land of the
races of man. The tree is dying,
and has set loose three of tfit*
most powerful beasties previ
ously held back: The Dagda
Mor, the Changeling and the
Reaper.
The monsters are carefully
chosen, here. The Dagda Mor
(don't pre-judge, what did you
think the first time you heard

"Darth Vader"?) is ,i wizard, a
fine match for the Druid Alla
no n (this is s c of 112 a b Ie .
Iverytime he popped up I
thought of the <inti ale oholism
group) I he changeling is a fine
spy, to keep guard over the
Elven King Fventine Elessedil
and his second son Ander, the
prim e who deserves the c town
but who is overshadowed by
his older brother I he Reaper,
some sort ot huge assassing
beast, < hases the two kids who
are sent out to gel the seed,
which is hidden somewhere
unknown to everyone.
One of the questers is the

granddaughter ot the king,
who rejec led her appointment
to the guardianship of the tree
and ran otl, to the great em
h.irassmenl ot the rest of her
tamil\. Ihe other is VViI, a
part elf part man who has in
hibited the powerful elfstones,
but who doesn I know how to
use thi'in I h<• i • they go with a
sin,ill ,ir ins our to tind the
seed which is hidden some
where.
Rather familial sounding,
eh? A hero with an admittedly
great power which he doesn't
know how to call up and an
unwilling heroine tore ed into a

role alien and unwelcome to
her, both sent out to some un
known destination confronted
by the evil might of a malign
sorcerer, weakly contravened
by the power of a good wizard,
while the home front is be
seiged by a huge army of nas
ties. This is virtually the set plot
for the science fantasy book.
There are some other
< haracters thrown in, includ
ing a gypsy girl who falls in love
with Wil on first sight and con
sistently sacrifices and covers
for him and Stee Jans, com
mander of a regiment of ex
