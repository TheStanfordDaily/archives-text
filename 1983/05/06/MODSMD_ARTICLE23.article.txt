# A 						paperback festival: 'Just what is that book you're reading?'
## 
### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
I her e comes a time in
everyone's life when they are
forced to read a book they
would not otherwise glance at.
Sometimes it happens in an
airport, sometimes in tin" early
morning hours before a big
test. It's likely that Abraham
I iiu oln, procrastinating before
writing his speech, read the
latest "penny dreadful" at
home in Washington, forcing
him to hastily scribble his
speech on the back of an en
velope on the red-eye express
train to (.ettysburg.
Given that these books are a
fact of life, it is in a spirit of

public service that the Ihiily
chooses to break from its nor
mal habit of criticizing the
best-sellers and plant care
books that are our strength and
spend some time on the books
that are read and not just kept
on shelves and coffee tables.
So here follow three reviews of
some paperbacks, each shin
ing examples of the genus
"paperback.
I ho Flfstom's of Shannara
Terry Books
Del Rey/Ballanline Books $9.50
Although this book is strictly
called an "oversize," and
might as well be further

clarified as "overprice," this
book is bound in the finest
paper, and boasts a total am
biance of airport stores and
spinning drugstore racks. The
book itself is a sequel to a pre
ceding book called The Sword
of Shannara, and two charac
ters have survived the transi
tion.
There are always dangers to
sequels, but this book skirts
the most common, preventing
a repetition of the same story
about characters on a quest
accompanied by a mage by in
stead presenting us with the
tale of two characters on a

quest with the implicit guid
ance of a inage.
The story deals with the
search for a new seed ot the
Ellcrys tree, that tree having
been the guardian keeping
demons, goblins and used car
salesmen out of the land of the
races of man. The tree is dying,
and has set loose three of tfit*
most powerful beasties previ
ously held back: The Dagda
Mor, the Changeling and the
Reaper.
The monsters are carefully
chosen, here. The Dagda Mor
(don't pre-judge, what did you
think the first time you heard

"Darth Vader"?) is ,i wizard, a
fine match for the Druid Alla
no n (this is s c of 112 a b Ie .
Iverytime he popped up I
thought of the <inti ale oholism
group) I he changeling is a fine
spy, to keep guard over the
Elven King Fventine Elessedil
and his second son Ander, the
prim e who deserves the c town
but who is overshadowed by
his older brother I he Reaper,
some sort ot huge assassing
beast, < hases the two kids who
are sent out to gel the seed,
which is hidden somewhere
unknown to everyone.
One of the questers is the

granddaughter ot the king,
who rejec led her appointment
to the guardianship of the tree
and ran otl, to the great em
h.irassmenl ot the rest of her
tamil\. Ihe other is VViI, a
part elf part man who has in
hibited the powerful elfstones,
but who doesn I know how to
use thi'in I h<• i • they go with a
sin,ill ,ir ins our to tind the
seed which is hidden some
where.
Rather familial sounding,
eh? A hero with an admittedly
great power which he doesn't
know how to call up and an
unwilling heroine tore ed into a

role alien and unwelcome to
her, both sent out to some un
known destination confronted
by the evil might of a malign
sorcerer, weakly contravened
by the power of a good wizard,
while the home front is be
seiged by a huge army of nas
ties. This is virtually the set plot
for the science fantasy book.
There are some other
< haracters thrown in, includ
ing a gypsy girl who falls in love
with Wil on first sight and con
sistently sacrifices and covers
for him and Stee Jans, com
mander of a regiment of ex
criminals who fight bravely and
atone for whatever evils they
may have done. (These guys do
such great things, though, one
wonders why they just don't
say "Okay! That's enough.
We're going home now!")
The book is a fine timewas
ter, but falls short as reading
because it is so typed. You
know the elf and the girl are
going to fall in love, and there
is so much else of the book that
is likewise predictable. Also,
we have another of the tvpe of
elf, dwarf, troll, man arid
monster books, which is the
cheapest kind of fantasy book.
Finally, this book breaks its
ground rules—or maybe it
hasn't even set them. The end
ing is strictly deus es machma,
and that sours the book.

Playing With Fire
Bob Veder
Pocket Books $2.95
The Altar
Paul Walker
Pocket Books $2.95
Pocket Books has inadver
tently provided a textbook les
son about what makes a good
timewasting book and what
makes the kind of book that
makes you feel ashamed to
have read it and cheated to
have paid for it.
Both books are packaged in
the kind of repellent, lurid
style that characterized the
boom; Playing
With Fire has a gingerbread
man with a human face being
tossed into flames, while The
Altar has a demonaic dog and a
girl in white robes posing be
fore a gothic stone arch. The
jacket copy for the former

dwells on small town lust and
envy, while the latter tell of a
young girls murdered in a
pagan rite.
But—surprise, surprise! —
both books are whodunits.
Welcome to Pocket Book's
Beat the Clock: Who's burning
the town of Fallsview, and who
is killing the young girls of
Culmar Lakes? You have 490
pages. . . .
Playing With Fire is by far the
better book, but also by far the
harder to read. Veder has a
strongly negative view of hu
manity, but he also has an odd
view of novel writing: most of
the characters are presented as
strongly unlikeable—there is
even a stock Nazi, now the
town's baker—and the writing
itself is ugly. Plenty of racial
slurs and disgusting personal
habits, enough to make me
seriously consider not finish
ing the book simply because it
was too gross.

The Alter is quite the oppo
site. The writing is squeaky
clean, and the hero and
heroine are both "noble
people in their own way' types.
Still, just as the killer is a evil
person behind a nice facade so
the book passes itself off. "I'm
not an exploitation book," it
says. "I'm a detective novel!
The hero is a private inves
tigator hire to solve the mur
ders, and he does so in grand
detective stvle. I know the
jacket promises 'the blood of
young girls (lowing sweetly
into the ground,' but none of
that actually happens. I'm
clean, man!"
I wonder why The Altar was
packaged as it was, rather than
as the first adventure of Dick
Kasavian, Private Eye. Still, the
•Uiminess of the book is not re

stricted to the cover. The book
toys with the reader, going in
side the mind of the killer and
showing glimpses of details
and promises of horror, but
never delivers anything; it ap
peals to the inner side of the
reader that rubbernecks for car
crashes but never satisfies it.
Further, it shortchanges the
reader who bought the book
off the neo-occult image of the
cover. Three-quarters through
the book it intimates that the
secondary villain is possessed,
and one person even swears to
be witness to a manifestation.
In the end, the only occult
thing that happens is with the
possessed man's dog when (in
the hero's words) "Wade
swears he shot it six times, and
it just looked at him and ran off
into the swamp."

The Alter is fairly well done
as a detective story—the man I
had pegged as the Killer turned
out to be only the First
Accomplice—but it is a lot less,
on many levels, than it prom
ises to be.
Playing With Fire was so
much more. In the small
northern town we watch a
struggle for land and a rash of
arson played out in literally a
townful of suspects. Perhaps
because it is easy to portray
monomaniacs, the characters
in this book are all well drawn
and behave understandably—a
harder feat in this genre than
one would think.
Furthermore, the few good
characters in the book get their
moments of just rewards, and
then are thoroughly victimized

by the bad guys. Veder plays
with his characters masterfully.
It is sometimes had that the au
thor's hand is visible as it is
here, but it such a well*
orchestrated flow that to the
reader it feels more like watch
ing a chess game than charac
ter manipulation.
If you can get past the sicken
ing details of human nature in
the opening pages (it is almost
as if Veder is telling us that
eveyrone one deserves to be
burned clean) you'll enjoy the
book. Try to guess who the
firebug is, it's good fun, but
don't be depressed if your sus
pect dies or loses his own
property. My only word: it's
not the Nazi baker.
