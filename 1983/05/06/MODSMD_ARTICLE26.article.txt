## Clinic strives for cultural health care awareness 
### PHILLIS BURTON 
A multi-cultural teaching program for health
care providers, giving them guidelines to help
effectively treat members of the various cultures
in the Bay Area, is underway at the Medical
School.
Developed by Dr. Elois Ann Berlin, a medical
anthropologist, the clinic is designed to educate
physicians about cultural differences in health
beliefs and practices, which often disrupts the
effectiveness of treatments.
The issue is especially important for the Bay
Area, where large numbers of immigrants settle.
While California's white population increased
only .7 percent, during the past decade the His
panic population increased 33.3 percent and the
Asian population increased 41.1 percent, ac
cording to the West Bay Area Health Systems
Agency report.
Berlin cited, as an example of cultural
differences encountered by medical workers
here, a scene where a young Vietnamese
woman gives birth to a healthy baby. Her physi
cian gives her post-delivery instructions to
which she smiles and nods in agreement. But
the nurses note on her records that she resists
all medication and baths.
Berlin explained that the mother, following
the procedures her culture has taught, is trying
to gain back the heat she said she lost during
childbirth. She cannot understand why the
nurses want her to take showers, which may
chill her.

Traditional Asian health beliefs prescribe a
constant balance between hot and cold sub
stances in the body.
Berlin said that physicians should let patients
say what they are experiencing, rather than ask
ing them if they have specific symptoms, be
cause in many cultures it is considered impolite
to disagree, so the patient would agree with
every symptom their physician mentioned.
"The fundamental concept to teach physi
cians attitude," Berlin said. "They have to be
receptive to their patients, and must realize that
patients do have an explanation of the illness
they are experiencing, and that it may not fit the
biomedical model."
"For example, in Asian cultures the soul is
thought to reside in the head. The common
practice of patting a child on the head could
startle the soul and cause it to run away," Berlin
explained.
"In order to avoid this," she said, "physicians
should always ask permission to touch patients'
heads during a clinical examination."
Among Hispanics, on the other hand, blood is
considered to be in limited supply, and is
equated with strength and virility. "Patients may
resist blood tests for this reason," Berlin ex
plained
Berlin teaches these concepts to residents at
the Family Practice Residency Program at the
Med Center and to medical students here as a
guest lecturer in internal medicine, pediatrics
and family medicine.
