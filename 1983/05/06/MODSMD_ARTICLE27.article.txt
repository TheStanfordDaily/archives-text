# New movie tells the tectonics tale
## 
### JONATHAN TREITEL 
The earth moves.
So what's new?
No, really it does. I rlon't mean just
whirling round the sun and all that
but the actual crust of the earth is crack
ing up and floating about like the gol
den topping on creme caramel.
Still not convinced? Remember that
quake on \uesday? I'll show you where
it came from.
Imagine the earth 85 million years
ago. Its surface has cooled into a frag
mented crust. The pieces are wander
ing all over the globe like icebergs on a
sea. Hot matter trom within the earth is
rising, and cold falling, dragging the
plates along with it.
And so the continents and oceans are
being formed: as the plates shift, the
Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean are
formed.
Examining the coasts of Africa and
South America they tit together like
two pieces of a |igsaw puzzle.
This whole theory is'called Plate Tec
tonics.
Still find it hard to picture? Stanford's
Geophysics Department has just made
an animated film about plates in the
Pacific Ocean that might just persuade
you.
Dave Engerbetson did his Ph.D.
thesis here last year on the plates off the

Pacific Coast; and when he had
finished it, he and Allan Cox, dean of
the School of Earth Sciences got to
gether to make the movie about the
plates. They roped in a couple of un
dergraduates, Michel Debiche and
Brian Hart, to do the work.
Debiche and Hart had only ten weeks
to get it ready tor the American
Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in
San Francisco last December.
When the team showed the movie to
the scientists at AGU, they applauded
wildly, they scuttled in from all corners
of the building, they requested copies
from all over the world. . . And this is
what they saw:
First, the tectonics theme is stated
andante: starting from 85 million years
ago, the Pacific Plate heaves over to
wards North America, squashing in the
Farallon Plate against Oregon, while
the Kula Plate gets pushed over towards
Alaska and disappears entirely.
This is played forward and backward
in time.
Then a scherzo: the same (heme re
peated four times more rapidly.
You can see how the Kula Plate dis
appears: getting drawn down slowly
but surely, then jumping up towards
Alaska in a sprint and dying there.
Then the scherzo is plaved in reverse
— and transformed into high contrast,

psychedelic disco colors: Vou can see
a "hot spot", shown on the film as a
blazing crimson disk, spitting up the
magma that became Hawaii and a chain
of sea mounts. The chain curls around
as the plates shift.
Then the grand theme returns — but
slowly, more majestic.
Next, two turther variations emerge
tirst the North American Plate is held
fixed and the other plates move relative
to it; then the velocities of the plates
are marked with arrows.
The scientific value of this film is said
Cox, that "It makes you decide what
happened at each moment. . . .and ac
cept all the consequences. . . And it
gets the message through to the scien
tific community."
Besides, according to Cox it may
soon be possible to use this film "in
teractively": to try out different possi
ble tectonic scenarios what happens or
even to penetrate the Earth three di
mensionally.
Cox plans to offer a sophomore
seminar next year, on making similar
movies.
And how does the film end?
The credits roll, the words THE END
flash on the screen. And the entire
Earth disappears into darkness.
