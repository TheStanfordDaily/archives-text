# Public key cryptography systems: a revolution in secret-telling
## 
### ALEX TARG 
Cryptography, the science of encoding
-and concealing the meaning of messages,
has been practiced for a least 3000 years. In
the past 200 years, as improved technology
has increased information flow regarding
military affairs, diplomacy, and international
commerce, cryptography has become an in
dispensible tool to help guard against mes
sage interception. As the users' demands
have become increasingly sophisticated,
cryptography systems have changed and
grown to meet them. Now, new devel
opments in information theory and com
puter calculating power are on the brink of
revolutionizing cryptography. One of the
most promising of the new systems is public

key cryptography.
The "public key concept" was developed
by Electrical Engineering Prof. Martin
Hellman, and Whitfield Diffie in 1976, but at
the time no computer system existed which
could apply their ideas, explained electrical
engineering graduate student Taher El-
Gamal who currently works with Hellman in
cryptography.
El-Gamal described an industry-wide need
for systems such as the public key cryptosys
tems in communications: "An encryption
system would be especially valuable for pay
T.V. stations. The codes now used are easy
to break and electrical engineers can easily
make their own decoders. Applications also
will be found in banking and other mass data

storage operations. With the increasing
number of personal computers in this coun
try we will see more concern with security
and more security provisions built into
computing and communications systems."
A conventional crtyptography system re
lies upon a single encoding and decoding
scheme, in cryptography lingo called a
"key." Someone sending a message would
use the key to change a message into an
unrecognizable coded form," much like
putting it in a box a locking it shut," said
El-Gamal. The receiver, uses the same key to
change the encoded message back to read
able form, as one might open the box
the problem with a single \ey system is
that both the encoding and decoding keys

are the same: if someone finds out what a
coding key is, no messages are sec ure. This
problem is intensified because noth sender
and receiver must obtain their identical keys
by some safe distribution system.
Hellman's revolutionary concept is to use
two keys instead of just one. The first key is
used only for encoding and the set ond only
for decoding. It is not feasible to compute
the decoding key trom knowledge of the
encoding key â€” one kind of key opens the
box and entirely different variety closes it.
Using this system, communication in code
is set up securelv without an initial visit be
cause an encoding key can be sent through
public c hannels.
lo initiate the two-way encoded corn

munication each sending station creates a
spy station would create an encoding and a
decoding key, then send the encoding key
to another station.
According to El-Gamal, the encoding key
is the product of two secret prime numbers
each having 100 digits, selected by the per
son creating the keys, and the encoding key
is derived from the same pair of prime num
bers using a non-secret formula. It is difficult
to calculate the prime numbers from the en
coding key because it would require factor
ing a 200 digit number. Using the fastest
computers in the existence shortest likely
time required to factor a number of this
magnitude and break the system would be
about 4 billion years.
