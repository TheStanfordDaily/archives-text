# Responds to student petition
## Kennedy reaffirms University support of SSRL research 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
I n a strongly worded letter to the signers of a
petition opposing a proposal at the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) that
would involve research on nuclear weapons,
University President Donald Kennedy re
emphasized his support yesterday of Univer
sity policies that refuse restrictions on re
search based on end-use.
The letter was released in answer to the
more than 2500 people who have signed the
petitions, which were presented to Kennedy
after 150 students marched from White Plaza to
his office to protest the proposal.
The petition opposed research "explicitly
dedicated to nuclear weapons testing and in
strumentation undertaken at SLAC (the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center) or anywhere
else on campus, even when unclassified."

The protesters also presented Kennedy with
two letters asking him to meet with staff and
faculty members at SLAC and with community
members in an "open forum" to discuss the
proposal. Kennedy's letter said he had ar
ranged with SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky
and SSRL Director Arthur Bienenstock to talk
with SLAC staff and faculty members.
Kennedy did not promise to attend an open
forum, saying he has already addressed the
Academic Council and ttae \ssue
with students.
In a related development, the faculty sen
ate's Committee on Research heard two days
ago a report presented by Jon Adelstein, a
junior in political science, Roger Miller, a SLAC
faculty member, and Robert Mayer, an SSRL
technician, claiming that the proposal at SSRL
was inconsistent with the University's research
policy.

Adelstein and Miller, who wrote the report,
proposed three areas where the research proj
ect could conflict with University policy:
• Researchers at SLAC and SSRL who opposed
the proposal would be forced to "contribute
directly and unavoidably to that proposed re
search project which they consider morally
unacceptable." This violates a part of the Uni
versity's "Statement of Principles Concerning
Research" which states that these principles
"\n no way indeed thev rein
force, ihe mdividual researcher's personal re
sponsibility to assure that the sources of fund
ing for his research, and its perceived applica
tions, are consistent with his own judgment
and conscience," according to the report'.
•The proposal would come into conflict with a
part of the statement that says the "University
should foster an environment conducive to
research."

• Proposed department of energy rules would
give the secretary of energy maximum flexibil
ity to prohibit the dissemination of any infor
mation required for research activities essen
tial to the national and economic security of
the United States. Adelstein claims these rules
"contravene University policy" and would af
fect the proposal at SSRL.
Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost and dean of
graduate studies and research, said the com
plaints were "worth discussing" and that the
committee would consider the report at its
next meeting two weeks from now. He noted
that the committee would have no jurisdiction
on the proposal unless it is accepted by SSRL.
Bienenstock said earlier this week that he
did not know when he would decide whether
or not to accept the plan.
