# Responds to student petition
## Kennedy reaffirms University support of SSRL research 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
I n a strongly worded letter to the signers of a
petition opposing a proposal at the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) that
would involve research on nuclear weapons,
University President Donald Kennedy re
emphasized his support yesterday of Univer
sity policies that refuse restrictions on re
search based on end-use.
The letter was released in answer to the
more than 2500 people who have signed the
petitions, which were presented to Kennedy
after 150 students marched from White Plaza to
his office to protest the proposal.
The petition opposed research "explicitly
dedicated to nuclear weapons testing and in
strumentation undertaken at SLAC (the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center) or anywhere
else on campus, even when unclassified."

The protesters also presented Kennedy with
two letters asking him to meet with staff and
faculty members at SLAC and with community
members in an "open forum" to discuss the
proposal. Kennedy's letter said he had ar
ranged with SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky
and SSRL Director Arthur Bienenstock to talk
with SLAC staff and faculty members.
Kennedy did not promise to attend an open
forum, saying he has already addressed the
Academic Council and ttae \ssue
with students.
In a related development, the faculty sen
ate's Committee on Research heard two days
ago a report presented by Jon Adelstein, a
junior in political science, Roger Miller, a SLAC
faculty member, and Robert Mayer, an SSRL
technician, claiming that the proposal at SSRL
was inconsistent with the University's research
policy.

Adelstein and Miller, who wrote the report,
proposed three areas where the research proj
ect could conflict with University policy:
• Researchers at SLAC and SSRL who opposed
the proposal would be forced to "contribute
directly and unavoidably to that proposed re
search project which they consider morally
unacceptable." This violates a part of the Uni
versity's "Statement of Principles Concerning
Research" which states that these principles
"\n no way indeed thev rein
force, ihe mdividual researcher's personal re
sponsibility to assure that the sources of fund
ing for his research, and its perceived applica
tions, are consistent with his own judgment
and conscience," according to the report'.
•The proposal would come into conflict with a
part of the statement that says the "University
should foster an environment conducive to
research."

• Proposed department of energy rules would
give the secretary of energy maximum flexibil
ity to prohibit the dissemination of any infor
mation required for research activities essen
tial to the national and economic security of
the United States. Adelstein claims these rules
"contravene University policy" and would af
fect the proposal at SSRL.
Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost and dean of
graduate studies and research, said the com
plaints were "worth discussing" and that the
committee would consider the report at its
next meeting two weeks from now. He noted
that the committee would have no jurisdiction
on the proposal unless it is accepted by SSRL.
Bienenstock said earlier this week that he
did not know when he would decide whether
or not to accept the plan.
Kennedy's letter was mainly a reaf
firmation of an address he gave to the
Academic Council April 1 in which he
pledged that he would not interfere
with the proposal if it is accepted. He
was, however, somewhat critical of
the petition, which was written by
Adelstein.
He said "the language used by the
framers misstates the issue," and
said that the petition should point
out that changes in University policy
would involve accepting proposals
on the basis of end-use.
"What we are talking about is the
institutional regulation of individual
behavior," the letter said.
Kennedy said University policy

now is based on the "principles of
openness and freedom of publica
tion. The social benefit flowing from
free and unimpeded efforts to gain
new knowledge will outweigh the
cost exacted by the occasional pieces
of dangerous knowledge we obtain
as a result of free inquiry."
Adelstein responded to Kennedy's
letter by saying "there has to be
some way that morality can be in
jected into the process."
Adelstein said, however, that "the
petition is an avenue for people to
express their moral outrage. It was
not designed to be a call for a change
in policy based on end-use."
He said the large number of
people signing the petitions was a
"strong signal by the students that
they want to make a moral state
ment."

In a related development, the faculty sen
ate's Committee on Research heard two days
ago a report presented by Jon Adelstein, a
junior in political science, Roger Miller, a SLAC
faculty member, and Robert Mayer, an SSRL
technician, claiming that the proposal at SSRL
was inconsistent with the University's research
policy.

Adelstein and Miller, who wrote the report,
proposed three areas where the research proj
ect could conflict with University policy:
• Researchers at SLAC and SSRL who opposed
the proposal would be forced to "contribute
directly and unavoidably to that proposed re
search project which they consider morally
unacceptable." This violates a part of the Uni
versity's "Statement of Principles Concerning
Research" which states that these principles
"\n no way indeed thev rein
force, ihe mdividual researcher's personal re
sponsibility to assure that the sources of fund
ing for his research, and its perceived applica
tions, are consistent with his own judgment
and conscience," according to the report'.
•The proposal would come into conflict with a
part of the statement that says the "University
should foster an environment conducive to
research."

• Proposed department of energy rules would
give the secretary of energy maximum flexibil
ity to prohibit the dissemination of any infor
mation required for research activities essen
tial to the national and economic security of
the United States. Adelstein claims these rules
"contravene University policy" and would af
fect the proposal at SSRL.
Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost and dean of
graduate studies and research, said the com
plaints were "worth discussing" and that the
committee would consider the report at its
next meeting two weeks from now. He noted
that the committee would have no jurisdiction
on the proposal unless it is accepted by SSRL.
Bienenstock said earlier this week that he
did not know when he would decide whether
or not to accept the plan.
Kennedy's letter was mainly a reaf
firmation of an address he gave to the
Academic Council April 1 in which he
pledged that he would not interfere
with the proposal if it is accepted. He
was, however, somewhat critical of
the petition, which was written by
Adelstein.
He said "the language used by the
framers misstates the issue," and
said that the petition should point
out that changes in University policy
would involve accepting proposals
on the basis of end-use.
"What we are talking about is the
institutional regulation of individual
behavior," the letter said.
Kennedy said University policy

now is based on the "principles of
openness and freedom of publica
tion. The social benefit flowing from
free and unimpeded efforts to gain
new knowledge will outweigh the
cost exacted by the occasional pieces
of dangerous knowledge we obtain
as a result of free inquiry."
Adelstein responded to Kennedy's
letter by saying "there has to be
some way that morality can be in
jected into the process."
Adelstein said, however, that "the
petition is an avenue for people to
express their moral outrage. It was
not designed to be a call for a change
in policy based on end-use."
He said the large number of
people signing the petitions was a
"strong signal by the students that
they want to make a moral state
ment."
