Stanford held off a final
day charge by fourth-place
Arizona Wednesday to
claim third place by just a
stroke at the Pacific-10 Con
ference Golf Champion
ships in Los Angeles.
UCLA ran away with the
team title, tallying a 72-hole
1476. USC was second at
1498, followed by Stanford
at 1534, Arizona at 1535 and
Oregon at 1555.
Arizona State, Washing
ton, Oregon State, Wash
ington State and California
rounded out the field in that
order. The tournament was
played at the par-74 Los
Angeles Country Club,
home of the annual Los
Angeles Open—a Profes
sional Golfers Association
tour event.
Stanford, which was in
third for the entire tourna
ment, held a five-stroke ad
vantage over the Wildcats

after the first 36 holes, but
saw its lead dwindle to four
after the third round.
It took a four-round team
total of 377, seven strokes
lower than Tuesday's 384, to
nail down third place for
Stanford. Arizona shot a 374
over the final 18.
The Cardinal's third-place
finish at the Pac-10s should
assure it a bid to the NCAA
Championship June 8-11 in
Fresno, especially after
Stanford's impressive first
place last month at the 20-
team United States
Intercollegiates—a tourna
ment Stanford hosted.
Individually, USC's Sam
Randolph and UCLA's Steve
Pate tied for medalist hon
ors. Randolph led after 36
holes, but Pate fired a
seven-under-par 67 over the
third 18 to gain the lead.
Four of UCLA's six golfers
placed in the top 10 indi
vidually.

For Stanford, Carl
Wagner, who has finished
in the top 15 in each of his
past four tournaments, was
the only Cardinal golfer to
shoot all four rounds in the
70 s, with scores of 72, 76, 77
and 75.
lack Skilling had a chance
to duplicate Wagner's feat,
but after shooting in the 70's
over the first 54 holes fired
San 80 on the final round to
record a four-round 306
(76-74-77-80).
Lanny Sawchuck, how
ever, was the hero for Stan
ford on the final day, shoot
ing a six-u nder-par 68.
Combined with three 80s on
the first three rounds, he
finished at 308, third best for
the Card.
)osh Mondry at 310 (78-
80-75-77), Lew Dickey at 314
(78-79-80-77) and Scott
Erickson at 322 (85-81-78-80)
rounded out the field for
Stanford.
