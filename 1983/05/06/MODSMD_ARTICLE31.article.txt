# Netwomen hit the road

### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford's women's tennis team is going on a
road trip this weekend.
But it won't be a road trip of the partying
variety. Instead, it will be one of a more serious
nature.
Coach Frank Brennan and his troops hope to
gain momentum for the NCAA Championships
May 14-22 in Albuquerque, N.M., in its final two
matches of the season against a pair of Southern
California powers — No. 3 UCLA and No. 5 San
Diego State.
And the Card is in a situation where it can
equally gain or lose momentum. It has not
played a dual match since April 17, as three
home matches were rained out last week.
Stanford, ranked fourth nationally, takes on
San Diego State, 18-7 overall and 7-5 in the
WCAA, today at 2 p.m., then heads up the coast
to Westwood Saturday to face UCLA, 18-5 over
all and 9-2 conference, at 11 a.m.
The Cardinal, 17-3 overall and 8-2 conference,
needs a sweep in SoCal this weekend to assure
itself the No. 3 seeding at Albuquerque, which
means it would not have to face undefeated USC
— the nation's top-ranked team — until the
NCAA finals.
Losses to UCLA and San Diego State would
probably drop Stanford into the fifth spot at
Albuquerque and severely dent any hopes of
successfully defending its NCAA title of 1982.

If Stanford wins both matches, it should have
an easier time with San Diego State. The Aztecs
are still recovering from injuries sustained eight
days ago when the team van crashed on the way
back from a rain-canceled match with UCLA.
San Diego State lost its No. 3 player — Carol
Neeld — for the season when the junior suf
fered a fractured collar bone in the accident.
The Aztecs, however, feature one of the na
tion's top singles players — Micki Schillig —
who won her 100 th career match Tuesday in the
Aztecs' 9-0 victory over Long Beach State.
Elise Burgin, Stanford's No. 1 netter and the
top-ranked amateur in the world, has split her
two matches with Schillig this year. Burgin, 16-0
in dual matches, beat Schillig at Stanford's 5-4
win over the Aztecs March 22, but lost in the
Marriot Intercollegiate semi-finals.
The UCLA match, however, is of even greater
importance to Stanford. The season series be
tween the two teams is knotted at 1-1, making
Saturday's rubber match that muth more cru
cial.
Stanford upset the Bruins at the National In
door Championships March 6 at Ann Arbor,
Mich., but lost a close 5-4 match two weeks ago
here.
A pair of wins this weekend would give Stan
ford sole possession of second place in the
WCAA regardless of the outcome of Monday's
UCLA-San Diego State match.
