Stanford quarterback Fred Buckley works out a spring football practice. The annual
workouts culminate Saturday at 10 a.m. with the Cardinal-White scrimmage, which will
be held in Stanford Stadium for the first time this season. In a 40-minute scrimmage
played last Friday, junior-to-be quarterback Greg Topp completed five of nine passes
for 51 yards. Steve Cottrell, the heir apparent to John Elway, is not at spring practice
since he is a starting pitcher on Stanford's nationally-ranked baseball team.
