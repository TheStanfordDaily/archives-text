## 
### SID SPAETH Senior Sports Writer 
The plot has thic kened in the
6-Pac race and despite all the
what-ifs concerning the re
maining conference games,
Stanford's shot at winning the
baseball conference title could
well be decided at (JSC this
weekend.
The four-game series, open
ing tonight at 7, continuing
with a doubleheader tomor
row (1 and7p.m.)and conclud
ing Sunday at 1 p.m., pits
league-leading Stanford
against the Trojans who are
two games back. Arizona State
has climbed to within one
game of Stanford.
If Stanford wins five of their
remaining seven games, they
will capture outright the divi
sion title. If they win four, in
cluding two this weekend, and
Arizona State sweeps their final
series at homeagainst Arizona,
the Cardinal will tie the Sun
Devils, but win the title be
cause they won the season
series four games to two over
ASU.
The Cardinal, now 32-13-1
overall and 15-8 conference, is
ranked 7th in both collegiate
baseball polls, but is only
9-10-1 on the road. USC is 28-10
overall and 13-10 conference.
Stanford continues to be led
by strong pitching. Brian Myers
(7-4) and Steve Cottrell (7-2)
pace the starting rotation.
Kevin Kunkel is 6-2 as both a
starter and reliever while Jeff
Ballard continues to be the
stopper out of the bullpen. Bal
lard is 6-1 and leads the confer
ence with six saves.
The Cardinal's on-and-off
hitting would appear to be cru
cial going into the playoff
stretch.
Eric Hardgrave, batting a
team-high .374 â€” second in the
conference, leads the 6-Pac in
RBl's with 63.
Hardgrave's 17 home runs is
second only to the USC's Mark
McGwire's 18. The two should
balance out in the long-ball
category this weekend.
Stanford also has the confer
ence's third and fourth best
hitters in Mike Aldrete (.367,11
doubles, 10 home runs and 47
RBl's) and Vince Sakowski
(.364, 13 doubles and only nine
strikeouts).
Pete Stanicek has been effec

tive as a lead-oft hitter, batting
nearly .300, walking a
conference-high 50 times, and
stealing a team-high 23 bases.
USC's leading hitter is )ohn
Wallace, who is batting .338
with 12 doubles.
