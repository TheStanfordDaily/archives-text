# SPORTS CLUBS Ultimate
## 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Although frisbee throwing emerged 60
years ago, the sport is by no means a "fling"
of the past. The modern game of frisbee,
known as ultimate, has become a favorite on
the Farm.
At the intramural level, about 30 teams par
ticipate in three different divisions. The Ath
letic Department offers frisbee classes at
tracting nearly 100 students each quarter.
Stanford also has an ultimate club which
competes for regional and national titles and
is involved in several tournament throughout
the year.
The men's team is a member of the NorCal
Ultimate Frisbee League, founded in 1976. A
women's club was organized a few years ago
and also competes throughout the year. Both
clubs practice three days a week and play
games each weekend.
The men's team has compiled an impress
ive 20-7 record this year. "This is the best
team Stanford has ever had," said Tom
Mcßann, Stanford's frisbee director.
Mcßann is a qualified judge of frisbee tal
ent. Afterall, he is a frisbee instructor here, a
world-class champion and a world-record
holder. In 1980, Mcßann threw a frisbee-like
disc (Skyro) 286 yards—the greatest distance
an object has been tossed by muscle-power
alone.
Mc Rann introduced ultimate to Stanford's
curriculum in 1973. "After starting frisbee
programs all around the west, I knew Stan
ford would be the best place to teach fris
bee," Mcßann said.
Ultimate is not exclusively a West Coast
craze. According to Mcßann, several eastern
schools take the game very seriously. "Ulti
mate in the west is a little more mellow, less

regimented," noted the frisbee expert.
Where did ultimate start? No one seems to
know for certain. Mcßann, however, said the
game was being played in California and in
the east at the same time but the "East Coast
claims to have put the rules together about 10
years ago."
The history behind recreational frisbee is a
little more clear. According to Mcßann's find
ings, the original pasttime started at Yale in
the 19205. Students used to throw empty pie
tins bought from a local store called Frisbie
Bakery in Bridgeport, Conn. In 1948,
Whammo produced the first plastic disc and
stole the original name, but changed the
spelling of Frisbie to Frisbee.
Although the rules for ultimate vary, nor
mally the fast-paced game is played on a grass
field with two seven-player teams. The object
is to score points by passing the disc to a
teammate in the endzone.
Different scoring and defensive strategies
are used similar to football, basketball and
soccer.
Stanford's ultimate club is hosting the an
nual Mother's Day Invitational tomorrow and
Sunday, next to the Stanford Stadium. Six
teen men's teams and eight women's teams
from Oregon, Washington and California will
be on hand for the tournament.
Ice Hockey
The Stanford ice hockey club took first
place in the Golden State Tournament in
Fresno last weekend. In the first round, the
Card defeated UC-Berkeley 5-3. In the sec
ond round the team crushed Concord 9-1,
and went on to secure the title by beating
Fresno 7-4. Cardinal standouts included Ted
Tracey, Kurt Heck and Richie Sobol.
Softball
Last Monday the softball team lost to San
Francisco State 0-4, 3-6 in their last games of
the season. Freshman Sara Fullerton pitched
the first game, and freshman Monique
Bautista pitched the second. The sluggers
finish the season with a record of 9-10, and
they are pleased with their performance
against top California teams.
