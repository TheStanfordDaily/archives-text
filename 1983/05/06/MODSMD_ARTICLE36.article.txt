Derby set for Saturday
Louisville, Ky. - The 109 th Ken
tucky Derby was stamped yesterday
as a Derby of entries and as one in
which the jockeying for position
started two days before the race.
Wayne Lukas will become the first
trainer to send out three starters in
the 1 1 4-mile Derby since 1946 — Tom
Smith sent out the fourth, fifth and
ninth finishers that year — when he
saddles controversial Marfa, Balboa
Native and Total Departure.
This entry was made the oarly 5-2
favorite for Saturday's race.

other entries will be the
Woody Stephens-trained pair of
Caveat and Chumming, listed at 5-1,
and the Bwamazon Farm coupling of
Highland Park and Freezing Rain,
15-1.
Since there can be only 12 betting
interests, there will be a five-horse
mutuel field, which means a bettor
gets five horses for the price of one.
In fact, four bets for a total of $8 will
cover 12 of the 20 Derby starters.
The field horses will be Paris
Prince, My Mac, Luv A Libra, Ex
plosive Wagon and Law Talk.
