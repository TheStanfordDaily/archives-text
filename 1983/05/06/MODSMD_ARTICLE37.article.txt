When I went to the film, and saw all the black-and-white
feelings that nobody felt,
and heard the audience sighing and sobbing with all the
emotions they none of them felt,
and saw them cuddling with rising passions they none of
them for a moment felt,
and caught them moaning from close-up kisses, black-and
white kisses that could not be felt,
It was like being in heaven, which I am sure has a
white atmosphere ...

How could any film do jus
tice to D.H. Lawrence's auto
biographical novel about grow
ing up in a Nottingham mining
town? Given the impossibility
of the task, the director, Jack
Cardiff, and the screenwriters,
Gavin Lambert and T.E.B.
Clarke, have done better than
anyone could have expected:
it's a smashing movie, even it is
dwarfed by its source. Three ex
traordinary English actors do
pretty close to their best work
here — Trevor Howard as
Morel, Wendy Hiller as Mrs.
Morel and Mary Ure (whose
performance is a paragon of
understatement) as Clara —
and the great Freddie Francis'
black and white photography is
sensuous and evocative. As
usual, Dean Stockwell (in the
central role) — the only Ameri
can in the cast — isn't quite sat
isfying; in this case, he doesn't
chart Paul Morel's develop
ment in a way that we can truly
comprehend. Still, his lineread
ings are sensitive and in
telligent, and when you have
dialogue like this, you can do
without a young Olivier if you
have to. "You would put me in
your pocket, but I should die
there, smothered," Paul says to
Miriam (Heather Sears) — it was
wise of Lambert and Clarke to
stick so close to dialogue they
could never have bettered.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
Tuesday (Larkin).
Kind Hearts and Coronets
(1949) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
This ingenious but un
stressed black comedy is one of
the earliest — and best — of the
golden age of English comic
films. Dennis Price plays a
young man of insurmountable
ambition who murders his way
through a whole family so that
he can inherit a fortune The
kicker is that the entire familv
D'Ascoigne is impersonated by
one man — Alec Guinness,
whose performance seems to
grow betterand more richly en
joyable with each of his eight
incarnations. (His make-up is
terrific, too.) Robert Hamer did
the witty diretion and co-au
thored the script, with John
Dighton, and the impeccable
cast features Joan Greenwood
(of the honeyed voice), Valerie
Hobson, Miles Malleson and
Arthur Lowe.
Plays through Wednesday
with The Man in the White Suit.

The Big Heat (1953) ★
Geology Corner, Room 320
Fritz Lang's movie has its civ
ics class side: when the wife of
prying Sergeant Dave Bannion
(Glenn Ford, in an intense, low
key performance) is
murderered by a syndicate
thug, he finds that almost ev
eryone is too scared to help him
locate the killer. (This was the
early '50s, after all; High Noon
had come out the previous
year.) And Sidney Boehm's
script (out of a Satevepost serial
by William P. McGivern) is ov
erwritten and sentimental,
laying on the domestic bliss for
half an hour before the sweet,
loving wife (Jocelyn Brando)
gets it. But it's a mean, engross
ing little thriller, with a good
performance by Gloria
Grahame as Lee Marvin's vain,
wisecracking, alcoholic moll.
Alexander Scourby plays the
boss mobster who has the po
lice commissioner (Howard
Wendell) and all the politicians
in town in his pocket, and
Jeanette Nolan is the cop's
widow who is blackmailing
him. (This is one of the first cor
rupt-establishment mysteries.)
The supporting cast includes
Willis Bouchey as Ford's super
visor, Dorothy Green as a
hooker, Dan Seymour, F.dith
Evanson, Adam Williams as a hit
man, and Carolyn Jones in a bit,
looking very young and very
blond.
Plays tonight.
Black and White in Color
(1977) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean-Jacques Annaud's deli
cately ironic account of a
French settlement on the Ivory
Coast in 1915 that learns —
months after the fact, due to the
slowness of the mails — that
France is at war with Germany;
these complacent colonials, out
of touch for so long with their
native country, must become
military leaders and train
Africans to kill Germans. The
movie, which Annaud wrote
with George Cauchon, is dist
inguished by its under
statement and its lack of
cynicism; Annaud displays gen
uine compassionfor the de
luded members of this settle
ment — who can never return
to the easy contentment of the
pre-war era — even as he ex
plores the comic possibilities of
the situation. A very fine, too
seldom-seen satire, with a
large, impressive cast of virtual

unknowns, a good score by
Pierre Bachelet, and first-rate
cinematography by Claude
Agostini.
Plays Sunday with Breaker
Morant.
You Can't Take It with You
(1938)
Tresidder LJnion, Room 270
George S. Kaufman and Moss
Hart wrote a wonderful com
edy about a family of noncon

formists who manage to largely
ignore the Depression, but
Frank Capra wasn't satisfied
with it: he had Robert Riskin re
write it in the glorified-little
man mode that was Capra's
trademark. It took the Oscars
for best picture and best direc
tor, but it's overlong (127
minutes), shamelessly preachy,
and not especially well done. In
beefed-up versions of the hero
and heroine roles, Jimmy Stew
art and Jean Arthur salvage ev

erything they can (Riskin did
write one charming new scene
lor them, set in a restaurant),
and Mischa Auer makes an
hilarious Kolenkhov (the Rus
sian dance instructor). But
Lionel Barrymore is no more
convincing as a lovable old
codger here than he would be
as a reprehensible old bastard
in Capra's It's a Wonderful Life
some years later. The cast also
includes Edward Arnold, Spring
Byington, Ann Miller, Samuel S.

Hinds, Donald Meek, H.B.
Warner, Ha 11 i well Hobbes,
Mu, Forbe 4 Dub Taylor and
Eddie Anderson.
Plays Monday evening.
Lies My Father Told Me
(1975)
Kresge Auditorium
Insufferable. The Czech di
rector Jan Kadar made this film
(shot in Montreal) about the
childhood of a Jewish immi
grant in Canada, and just about

everything in it — the script (by
Ted Allan), the performances,
the slick, picturesque photog
raphy, the suffocating, over-or
chestrated score — seems en
tirely wrong. Kadar tries for a
Sholom Aleichem folklorish
quality that does not come easi
ly, but except for the casting of
Yossi Yadin as Elias (a Tevye-like
character) he doesn't even
seem to be in the right ballpark.
Len Birman, Marilyn Lightstone
and Jeffrey Lyons co-star.
Plays tonight.
Barbarella (1967)
Kresge Auditorium
Roger Vadim directing Terry
Southern's sci-fi porno comic
strip script (based on a book by
lean-Claude Forest): it sounds
luscious but in fact it's a bit
paltry. Southern's wit is not
consistently charged in this
movie, and neither are the de
signers'. But Jane Fonda, as the
heroine who has sex with all the
men in the cast without losing
her jokey innocence, gives the
only completely satisfying com
ic performance of her career.
With her trembling, expectant
voice and her bright eyes, she is
a comic-sexual dream. The film
contains a few terrific cartoon
images and one really night
marish one (Barbarella is ac
costed by steel-toothed dolls
set on her by sweetly smiling
children), but on the whole it
doesn't linger in the memory.
With John Philip Law, Anita
Pallenberg, Milo O'Shea, David
Hemmings (as there
volutionary, Dildow), Marcel
Marceau, Ugo Tognazzi and
Claude Dauphin; photo
graphed by Claude Renoir.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Quest for Fire ★
Memorial Auditorium
A lovely surprise. Jean-Jac
ques Annaud's movie is an un
cynical account of the struggle
of early homo sapiens to find
fire; it is huge and impressive
but Annaud has concentrated
on a very strong narrative line.
Annaud not only captures his
hero Naoh's sense of wonder at
the discovery of new marvels;
in the best tradition of literature
and film, he shares it. Annaud
has used his actors wonderfully
(Everett McGill and Rae Dawn
Chong are especially good),
though perhaps the movie
needs a little more humor.
Plays Sunday evening.

he can inherit a fortune The
kicker is that the entire familv
D'Ascoigne is impersonated by
one man — Alec Guinness,
whose performance seems to
grow betterand more richly en
joyable with each of his eight
incarnations. (His make-up is
terrific, too.) Robert Hamer did

The Big Heat (1953) ★
Geology Corner, Room 320
Fritz Lang's movie has its civ
ics class side: when the wife of
prying Sergeant Dave Bannion
(Glenn Ford, in an intense, low
key performance) is
murderered by a syndicate
thug, he finds that almost ev
eryone is too scared to help him
locate the killer. (This was the
early '50s, after all; High Noon
had come out the previous
year.) And Sidney Boehm's
script (out of a Satevepost serial
by William P. McGivern) is ov
erwritten and sentimental,
laying on the domestic bliss for
half an hour before the sweet,
loving wife (Jocelyn Brando)
gets it. But it's a mean, engross
ing little thriller, with a good
performance by Gloria
Grahame as Lee Marvin's vain,
wisecracking, alcoholic moll.
Alexander Scourby plays the
boss mobster who has the po
lice commissioner (Howard
Wendell) and all the politicians
in town in his pocket, and
Jeanette Nolan is the cop's
widow who is blackmailing
him. (This is one of the first cor
rupt-establishment mysteries.)
The supporting cast includes
Willis Bouchey as Ford's super
visor, Dorothy Green as a
hooker, Dan Seymour, F.dith
Evanson, Adam Williams as a hit
man, and Carolyn Jones in a bit,
looking very young and very
blond.
Plays tonight.
Black and White in Color
(1977) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean-Jacques Annaud's deli
cately ironic account of a
French settlement on the Ivory
Coast in 1915 that learns —
months after the fact, due to the
slowness of the mails — that
France is at war with Germany;
these complacent colonials, out
of touch for so long with their
native country, must become
military leaders and train
Africans to kill Germans. The
movie, which Annaud wrote
with George Cauchon, is dist
inguished by its under
statement and its lack of
cynicism; Annaud displays gen
uine compassionfor the de
luded members of this settle
ment — who can never return
to the easy contentment of the
pre-war era — even as he ex
plores the comic possibilities of
the situation. A very fine, too
seldom-seen satire, with a
large, impressive cast of virtual

unknowns, a good score by
Pierre Bachelet, and first-rate
cinematography by Claude
Agostini.
Plays Sunday with Breaker
Morant.
You Can't Take It with You
(1938)
Tresidder LJnion, Room 270
George S. Kaufman and Moss
Hart wrote a wonderful com
edy about a family of noncon

formists who manage to largely
ignore the Depression, but
Frank Capra wasn't satisfied
with it: he had Robert Riskin re
write it in the glorified-little
man mode that was Capra's
trademark. It took the Oscars
for best picture and best direc
tor, but it's overlong (127
minutes), shamelessly preachy,
and not especially well done. In
beefed-up versions of the hero
and heroine roles, Jimmy Stew
art and Jean Arthur salvage ev

erything they can (Riskin did
write one charming new scene
lor them, set in a restaurant),
and Mischa Auer makes an
hilarious Kolenkhov (the Rus
sian dance instructor). But
Lionel Barrymore is no more
convincing as a lovable old
codger here than he would be
as a reprehensible old bastard
in Capra's It's a Wonderful Life
some years later. The cast also
includes Edward Arnold, Spring
Byington, Ann Miller, Samuel S.

Hinds, Donald Meek, H.B.
Warner, Ha 11 i well Hobbes,
Mu, Forbe 4 Dub Taylor and
Eddie Anderson.
Plays Monday evening.
Lies My Father Told Me
(1975)
Kresge Auditorium
Insufferable. The Czech di
rector Jan Kadar made this film
(shot in Montreal) about the
childhood of a Jewish immi
grant in Canada, and just about

everything in it — the script (by
Ted Allan), the performances,
the slick, picturesque photog
raphy, the suffocating, over-or
chestrated score — seems en
tirely wrong. Kadar tries for a
Sholom Aleichem folklorish
quality that does not come easi
ly, but except for the casting of
Yossi Yadin as Elias (a Tevye-like
character) he doesn't even
seem to be in the right ballpark.
Len Birman, Marilyn Lightstone
and Jeffrey Lyons co-star.
Plays tonight.
Barbarella (1967)
Kresge Auditorium
Roger Vadim directing Terry
Southern's sci-fi porno comic
strip script (based on a book by
lean-Claude Forest): it sounds
luscious but in fact it's a bit
paltry. Southern's wit is not
consistently charged in this
movie, and neither are the de
signers'. But Jane Fonda, as the
heroine who has sex with all the
men in the cast without losing
her jokey innocence, gives the
only completely satisfying com
ic performance of her career.
With her trembling, expectant
voice and her bright eyes, she is
a comic-sexual dream. The film
contains a few terrific cartoon
images and one really night
marish one (Barbarella is ac
costed by steel-toothed dolls
set on her by sweetly smiling
children), but on the whole it
doesn't linger in the memory.
With John Philip Law, Anita
Pallenberg, Milo O'Shea, David
Hemmings (as there
volutionary, Dildow), Marcel
Marceau, Ugo Tognazzi and
Claude Dauphin; photo
graphed by Claude Renoir.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Quest for Fire ★
Memorial Auditorium
A lovely surprise. Jean-Jac
ques Annaud's movie is an un
cynical account of the struggle
of early homo sapiens to find
fire; it is huge and impressive
but Annaud has concentrated
on a very strong narrative line.
Annaud not only captures his
hero Naoh's sense of wonder at
the discovery of new marvels;
in the best tradition of literature
and film, he shares it. Annaud
has used his actors wonderfully
(Everett McGill and Rae Dawn
Chong are especially good),
though perhaps the movie
needs a little more humor.
Plays Sunday evening.

Mary Ure in Sons and Lovers.
When I went to the film, and saw all the black-and-white
feelings that nobody felt,
and heard the audience sighing and sobbing with all the
emotions they none of them felt,
and saw them cuddling with rising passions they none of
them for a moment felt,
and caught them moaning from close-up kisses, black-and
white kisses that could not be felt,
It was like being in heaven, which I am sure has a
white atmosphere ...
-- From "When I Went To the Film," D.H. Lawrence

isn't there a certain in
compatability between
the terms 'cinema' and

Sons and Lovers (1960) ★
Lagunita Dining Room; Larkin
West Lounge
How could any film do jus
tice to D.H. Lawrence's auto
biographical novel about grow
ing up in a Nottingham mining
town? Given the impossibility
of the task, the director, Jack
Cardiff, and the screenwriters,
Gavin Lambert and T.E.B.
Clarke, have done better than
anyone could have expected:
it's a smashing movie, even it is
dwarfed by its source. Three ex
traordinary English actors do
pretty close to their best work
here — Trevor Howard as
Morel, Wendy Hiller as Mrs.
Morel and Mary Ure (whose
performance is a paragon of
understatement) as Clara —
and the great Freddie Francis'
black and white photography is
sensuous and evocative. As
usual, Dean Stockwell (in the
central role) — the only Ameri
can in the cast — isn't quite sat
isfying; in this case, he doesn't
chart Paul Morel's develop
ment in a way that we can truly
comprehend. Still, his lineread
ings are sensitive and in
telligent, and when you have
dialogue like this, you can do
without a young Olivier if you
have to. "You would put me in
your pocket, but I should die
there, smothered," Paul says to
Miriam (Heather Sears) — it was
wise of Lambert and Clarke to
stick so close to dialogue they
could never have bettered.

native country, must become
military leaders and train
Africans to kill Germans. The
movie, which Annaud wrote
with George Cauchon, is dist
inguished by its under
statement and its lack of
cynicism; Annaud displays gen
uine compassionfor the de
luded members of this settle
ment — who can never return
to the easy contentment of the
pre-war era — even as he ex
plores the comic possibilities of
the situation. A very fine, too
seldom-seen satire, with a
large, impressive cast of virtual

unknowns, a good score by
Pierre Bachelet, and first-rate
cinematography by Claude
Agostini.
Plays Sunday with Breaker
Morant.
You Can't Take It with You
(1938)
Tresidder LJnion, Room 270
George S. Kaufman and Moss
Hart wrote a wonderful com
edy about a family of noncon

formists who manage to largely
ignore the Depression, but
Frank Capra wasn't satisfied
with it: he had Robert Riskin re
write it in the glorified-little
man mode that was Capra's
trademark. It took the Oscars
for best picture and best direc
tor, but it's overlong (127
minutes), shamelessly preachy,
and not especially well done. In
beefed-up versions of the hero
and heroine roles, Jimmy Stew
art and Jean Arthur salvage ev

erything they can (Riskin did
write one charming new scene
lor them, set in a restaurant),
and Mischa Auer makes an
hilarious Kolenkhov (the Rus
sian dance instructor). But
Lionel Barrymore is no more
convincing as a lovable old
codger here than he would be
as a reprehensible old bastard
in Capra's It's a Wonderful Life
some years later. The cast also
includes Edward Arnold, Spring
Byington, Ann Miller, Samuel S.

Hinds, Donald Meek, H.B.
Warner, Ha 11 i well Hobbes,
Mu, Forbe 4 Dub Taylor and
Eddie Anderson.
Plays Monday evening.
Lies My Father Told Me
(1975)
Kresge Auditorium
Insufferable. The Czech di
rector Jan Kadar made this film
(shot in Montreal) about the
childhood of a Jewish immi
grant in Canada, and just about

everything in it — the script (by
Ted Allan), the performances,
the slick, picturesque photog
raphy, the suffocating, over-or
chestrated score — seems en
tirely wrong. Kadar tries for a
Sholom Aleichem folklorish
quality that does not come easi
ly, but except for the casting of
Yossi Yadin as Elias (a Tevye-like
character) he doesn't even
seem to be in the right ballpark.
Len Birman, Marilyn Lightstone
and Jeffrey Lyons co-star.
Plays tonight.
Barbarella (1967)
Kresge Auditorium
Roger Vadim directing Terry
Southern's sci-fi porno comic
strip script (based on a book by
lean-Claude Forest): it sounds
luscious but in fact it's a bit
paltry. Southern's wit is not
consistently charged in this
movie, and neither are the de
signers'. But Jane Fonda, as the
heroine who has sex with all the
men in the cast without losing
her jokey innocence, gives the
only completely satisfying com
ic performance of her career.
With her trembling, expectant
voice and her bright eyes, she is
a comic-sexual dream. The film
contains a few terrific cartoon
images and one really night
marish one (Barbarella is ac
costed by steel-toothed dolls
set on her by sweetly smiling
children), but on the whole it
doesn't linger in the memory.
With John Philip Law, Anita
Pallenberg, Milo O'Shea, David
Hemmings (as there
volutionary, Dildow), Marcel
Marceau, Ugo Tognazzi and
Claude Dauphin; photo
graphed by Claude Renoir.
Plays tomorrow evening.
Quest for Fire ★
Memorial Auditorium
A lovely surprise. Jean-Jac
ques Annaud's movie is an un
cynical account of the struggle
of early homo sapiens to find
fire; it is huge and impressive
but Annaud has concentrated
on a very strong narrative line.
Annaud not only captures his
hero Naoh's sense of wonder at
the discovery of new marvels;
in the best tradition of literature
and film, he shares it. Annaud
has used his actors wonderfully
(Everett McGill and Rae Dawn
Chong are especially good),
though perhaps the movie
needs a little more humor.
Plays Sunday evening.
★ Highly recommended

Mary Ure in Sons and Lovers.
When I went to the film, and saw all the black-and-white
feelings that nobody felt,
and heard the audience sighing and sobbing with all the
emotions they none of them felt,
and saw them cuddling with rising passions they none of
them for a moment felt,
and caught them moaning from close-up kisses, black-and
white kisses that could not be felt,
It was like being in heaven, which I am sure has a
white atmosphere ...
-- From "When I Went To the Film," D.H. Lawrence

"Well, to put it bluntly,
isn't there a certain in
compatability between
the terms 'cinema' and
:British7"
— Francois Truffaut
Sons and Lovers (1960) ★
Lagunita Dining Room; Larkin
West Lounge
How could any film do jus
tice to D.H. Lawrence's auto
biographical novel about grow
ing up in a Nottingham mining
town? Given the impossibility
of the task, the director, Jack
Cardiff, and the screenwriters,
Gavin Lambert and T.E.B.
Clarke, have done better than
anyone could have expected:
it's a smashing movie, even it is
dwarfed by its source. Three ex
traordinary English actors do
pretty close to their best work
here — Trevor Howard as
Morel, Wendy Hiller as Mrs.
Morel and Mary Ure (whose
performance is a paragon of
understatement) as Clara —
and the great Freddie Francis'
black and white photography is
sensuous and evocative. As
usual, Dean Stockwell (in the
central role) — the only Ameri
can in the cast — isn't quite sat
isfying; in this case, he doesn't
chart Paul Morel's develop
ment in a way that we can truly
comprehend. Still, his lineread
ings are sensitive and in
telligent, and when you have
dialogue like this, you can do
without a young Olivier if you
have to. "You would put me in
your pocket, but I should die
there, smothered," Paul says to
Miriam (Heather Sears) — it was
wise of Lambert and Clarke to
stick so close to dialogue they
could never have bettered.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
Tuesday (Larkin).
Kind Hearts and Coronets
(1949) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
This ingenious but un
stressed black comedy is one of
the earliest — and best — of the
golden age of English comic
films. Dennis Price plays a
young man of insurmountable
ambition who murders his way
through a whole family so that
he can inherit a fortune The
kicker is that the entire familv
D'Ascoigne is impersonated by
one man — Alec Guinness,
whose performance seems to
grow betterand more richly en
joyable with each of his eight
incarnations. (His make-up is
terrific, too.) Robert Hamer did
the witty diretion and co-au
thored the script, with John
Dighton, and the impeccable
cast features Joan Greenwood
(of the honeyed voice), Valerie
Hobson, Miles Malleson and
Arthur Lowe.
Plays through Wednesday
with The Man in the White Suit.

The Big Heat (1953) ★
Geology Corner, Room 320
Fritz Lang's movie has its civ
ics class side: when the wife of
prying Sergeant Dave Bannion
(Glenn Ford, in an intense, low
key performance) is
murderered by a syndicate
thug, he finds that almost ev
eryone is too scared to help him
locate the killer. (This was the
early '50s, after all; High Noon
had come out the previous
year.) And Sidney Boehm's
script (out of a Satevepost serial
by William P. McGivern) is ov
erwritten and sentimental,
laying on the domestic bliss for
half an hour before the sweet,
loving wife (Jocelyn Brando)
gets it. But it's a mean, engross
ing little thriller, with a good
performance by Gloria
Grahame as Lee Marvin's vain,
wisecracking, alcoholic moll.
Alexander Scourby plays the
boss mobster who has the po
lice commissioner (Howard
Wendell) and all the politicians
in town in his pocket, and
Jeanette Nolan is the cop's
widow who is blackmailing
him. (This is one of the first cor
rupt-establishment mysteries.)
The supporting cast includes
Willis Bouchey as Ford's super
visor, Dorothy Green as a
hooker, Dan Seymour, F.dith
Evanson, Adam Williams as a hit
man, and Carolyn Jones in a bit,
looking very young and very
blond.
Plays tonight.
Black and White in Color
(1977) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean-Jacques Annaud's deli
cately ironic account of a
French settlement on the Ivory
Coast in 1915 that learns —
months after the fact, due to the
slowness of the mails — that
France is at war with Germany;
these complacent colonials, out
of touch for so long with their
native country, must become
military leaders and train
Africans to kill Germans. The
movie, which Annaud wrote
with George Cauchon, is dist
