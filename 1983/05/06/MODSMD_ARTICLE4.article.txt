# Coffee House faces debt

The Coffee House could face serious problems if someone is not hired
soon to replace full-time Manager Steve Weiss, who is leaving his job May 31.
"We're currently looking at three candidates who we could make an offer
to next week, and it would still be two weeks before they could start," said
Chris Cramer, Coffee House president. "We can run without a manager for a
week or two, if need be, or we might have to get an interim manager for a
short time. Where we'd get them is a tough question."
The Coffee House board began looking for a new manager in January,
when Weiss announced his intention to leave the post.
According to Weiss, the board is looking for "a food service person —
someone who has experience in the restaurant business, college food ser
vice and financial matters." Weiss had originally planned to leave May 15,
but extended his deadline because of the problems finding a new manager.
The current assistant manager will leave May 31 as well.
Besides finding new managers, the Coffee House also must meet financial
obligations such as a loan obtained from the University three years ago, to be
paid back in five years.
"Our major goal right now is to become financially stable — to make up
the loss we incurred fall quarter," said Cordon Hecker, Coffee House board
member.
According to Cramer, the restaurant has come a long way in meeting this
goal. "We had a tough fall quarter —we lost a lot of money, and we had to
make some changes quickly," he said.
One of these changes was to cut back on labor. Because a major goal of the
Coffee House has been to employ students, there are now more than 100
part-time student workers.
"This is good because we want to put as many students as possible to
work, but it's also inefficient. Before we cut back we had people bumping
into each other," said Cramer. Rather than cutting back on the number of
students employed, they have tried instead to increase the number of hours
on each shift.
Another change was in the price structure. After raising some prices and
eliminating some items, the Coffee House is now able to meet its costs
better. "We've switched more to items with a higher price margin, like
beverages and alcohol," said Cynthia Mathewson, chairman of the Coffee
House board.


WHERE'S THE MANAGER?: The Coffee House is currently suffering
from a lack of money and a lack of managers. Manager Steve Weiss and
the assistant manager plan to leave their posts May 31. In addition, the
Coffee House is trying to meet financial obligations, after suffering a loss
fall quarter.
