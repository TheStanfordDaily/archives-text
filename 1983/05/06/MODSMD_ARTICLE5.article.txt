Reagan stands firm on freeze
Washington — President Reagan said yester
day he will not support the House-passed reso
lution calling for a "mutual and verifiable
freeze" on U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals, de
spite a modification won by his supporters.
He said he was confident that if the non-bind
ing resolution is debated in the Senate, "the
doubts and opposition to a simple freeze . . .
will continue to grow."
Reagan said in a written statement he was
pleased that "a great number in Congress came
to recognize the threats posed by a simple
'freeze now' approach and passed amendments
that sought to improve the final resolution."

Beirut shelled for five hours
Beirut — President Amin Gemayel alerted his
fledgling air force and artillery last night for
their first combat after Christian-Druse fighting
in the hills spilled over onto Beirut. The capital
suffered its heaviest bombardment since the
end of the Israeli-Palestinian war last summer.
Senior military sources said Gemayel ordered
the air force, which consists of eight Hawker
Hunter jet fighters and a squadron of missile
equipped helicopter gunships, and the army ar
tillery to "attack and silence" the batteries that
rained shells on Beirut if they resumed the at
tack.
It had not been determined who was respon

sible for the firing.
Dozens of rockets and shells were fired into
the cit from the hills over a period of more than
five hours yesterday afternoon, killing at least
seven people and wounding 25, police said.
One shell landed near an Israeli convoy
southeast of the city, killing an Israeli sergeant
and wounding nine others, the Israeli military
command announced.
Three machine-gun rounds hit a helicopter
carrying Col. James Mead of Boston, com
mander of U.S. Marine peacekeeping forces,
who was trying to find out which side was shell
ing the city. None of the Americans were hurt,
but Mead hadtoterminate his mission abruptly.
Jetliner nearly crashes
Miami — A jetliner carrying 172 people lost power
in all three engines shortly after takeoff yesterday be
cause oil seals had not been installed. The plane
plunged to within 2700 of the Atlantic Ocean before
the pilot restarted the tail engine and limped to a
landing in Miami.
No injuries were reported as the Bahamas-bound
Eastern Airlines L-1011 plunged 17,200 feet in about 10
minutes while frantic passengers donned their life
vests. As they prepared to ditch, Pilot Dick Boddy
managed to get the one engine going and turned
back, landing at Miami International Airport.
"I was never so scared in all my life, never closer to
death," said Dr. Bruce Jacobs, a dentist from nearby
Hollywood.
"They came down pretty fast," said Federal Avia
tion Adminstration spokesman Roger Myers.
National Transportation Safety Board officials
blamed the engine failures on three missing "O
rings," thumb-size rubber dough nuts that seal oil into
the engine.
"With the 'O ring' missing, the oil was able to leak
out," NTSB spokesman Ira Furman said. "If oil leaks
out, the engine will fail."
Furman said the ring, which costs "pennies," fits
into a notch on a magnetized oil plug that is removed
nightly from the engines. New oil plugs were ap
parently installed without the seals during nightly
maintenance, he said, adding that the seals definitely
did not fall off in flight.
NRC threatens reactor shutdown
Washington — The Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission yesterday said it would issue an order next
month shutting down the Indian Point atomic power
reactors, located 35 miles north of New York City, un
less their operators produce a satisfactory plan for
protecting nearby residents in an emergency.
The unanimous NRC decision marked the first time
the commission hasthreatenedtosuspendtheopera
tion of atomic power plants for lack of an adequate
plan for evacuating or sheltering residents who live
within 10 miles of the facility in the event of a severe
nuclear accident.
The emergency-planning rule was adopted in 1979
following the nation's worst civilian nuclear power
accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania.
The zone, largely comprised of Westchester Coun
ty, where the plant is located, and Rockland County
on the west bank of the river, is the most densely pop
ulated area around any nuclear power plant in this
country.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency iast
month advised the NRC for the third time that emer
gency plans for Indian Point "continue to be signifi
cantly deficient," and "FEMA cannot assure that the
public health and safety can be protected" in the area
around the plant.
A major deficiency cited by FEMA is the refusal of
Rockland County to participate in evacuation ex
ercises. The county has rejected the emergency plan
prepared by Indian Point'sownersas unworkable and
is trying to formulate its own plan, a process expected
to take another year.
Israel may withraw troops
Jerusalem — Secretary of State George Shultz's
Middle East shuttle came to a pause yesterday while
the Israeli government pondered the proposed troop
withdrawal agreement Shultz brought from Lebanon
the day before. The Israeli Cabinet will meet on the
question today, although it is not certain that it will
make a final decision.
The U.S. negotiators who have worked on the troop
withdrawal since late last year, Philip Habib and
Morris Draper, met with Israeli officials to answer
questions and supply clarifications on the text of the
draft agreement.
Shultz, bothered by a cold, spent most of the day in
his hotel. He conferred briefly by phone with Presi
dent Reagan, bringing him up to date on what Shultz
clearly believed is the last phase of te negotiations. It
was his first direct conversation with Reagan since he
left Washington almost two weeks ago, although they
have exchanged daily cables.
Reagan, in San Antonio, Texas, to give a speech, was
asked later to comment on the status of the nego
tiations in Lebanon and Israel. "We've got a no-hitter
going," he answered, "and I didn't want to say any
thing to jinx it."
Shultz also talked to Israeli Defense Minister
Moshe Arens, a key negotiator, by telephone and met
with him briefly at the hotel. Shultz later attended the
inauguration of Chaim Herzog as president of Israel
and a reception afterwards.

" All indications seem to have been that it's decision
time tomorrow," a senior U.S. official said late yester
day. The official, who spoke on the condition that he
not be identified, added, "We brought back a clear
indication of the government of Lebanon's position.
The expected questions have been raised and ex
changes are now in progress."
Reagan tours Texas
San Antonio, Texas — President Reagan, courting
Mexican-American support in vote-rich Texas,
pressed his military and economic policies in Central
America with a warning yesterday that the region is
threatened by "enemies of democracy."
Setting out on a five-day foray from Washington,
the president attended festivities marking Cinco de
Mayo, a Mexican holiday commemorating the May 5,
1862, defeat of French troops by heavily outnum
bered Mexican forces defending their capital.
Reagan claimed credit for repairing U.S. relations
with Mexico, appointing 130 Hispanics to high-level
jobs in his administration, and applying the right pre
scription for "the economic troubles we inherited
from the 19705."
Appealing for support for his Central-American
policies, Reagan said:
"I hope you agree with me that the United States
can no longer remain complacent about what is hap
pening to our neighbors and to our friends in the
south.
"We can no longer find excuses for doing nothing
and then hope for the best, when the enemies of de
mocracy — Cuba, the U.S.S.R. and Nicaragua — are
actively working to subvert these nations.
"What's going on in Central America relates direct
ly to the security of the United States, and when it
comes to that, we aren't Republicans and Democrats,
we're Americans."
The outline of a thick bulletproof vest was clearly
visible under Reagan's tan suit as he spoke on a sun
drenched stage he shared with Mexican-American
men in sombreros and women in long dresses. Shouts
of "Fight for jobs, not for war" could be heard from
several demonstrators outside the plaza.
Fusion reactor dedicated
Plainsboro, N.J. — The world's largest experimental
reactor designed to produce electricity by fusing
rather than splitting atoms was dedicated yesterday
and hailed by the Reagan administration as a key to
meeting the country's energy needs in the next cen
tury.
The process may be commercially feasible in 35
vears, said Harold Furth, director of the Princeton
Plasma Physics Laboratory.
"At this significant moment, you are not only dedi
cating a new institution, but perhaps launching a truly
historic program that will lead to a new era of un
limited energy," said a letter from President Reagan
that was read by Energy Secretary Donald Hodel.
Hodel, who was joined by Reagan science adviser
George Keyworth, said the reactor's "low radioactive
results give us hope that we will have an environmen
tally acceptable energy source at a low cost."
But Hodel acknowledged that, "This is only a
milestone on a long road," referring to the $314 mil
lion experimental reactor that has worked only in
bursts of less than a second.
Those brief bursts have involved creation of a
plasma, a hot, electrically conducting form of matter
in which atoms are stripped of their electrons. The
goal is to confine a plasma in magnetic fields at high
temperature and pressure until the atomsfuse, releas
ing energy in the form of heat and radiation.
Researchers believe they will have the the donut
shaped reactor at the "break even" point, when it will
produce as much energy as it consumes, by 1985.
Stocks gain, trading active
Stock prices rang up their third straight gain yester
day, carrying several market indicators past their re
cent record highs in another busy session on Wall
Street.
Analysts said talk of possible further declines in in
terest rates helped keep the market in high gear.
Speculation persisted that the the Federal Reserve
might soon lower its discount rate from the 8.4 per
cent level that has prevailed since last December.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.07 to
1,219.72, a half dozen points short of its record close
of 1,226.20 last Friday.
Today's weather
Mostly sunny in the morning but increasing clouds
in the afternoon. Highs in the 60s with generally light
winds. Tonight and tomorrow mostly cloudy with a
chance of rain late tonight.
