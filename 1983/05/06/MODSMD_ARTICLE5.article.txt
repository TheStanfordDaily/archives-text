Reagan stands firm on freeze
Washington — President Reagan said yester
day he will not support the House-passed reso
lution calling for a "mutual and verifiable
freeze" on U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals, de
spite a modification won by his supporters.
He said he was confident that if the non-bind
ing resolution is debated in the Senate, "the
doubts and opposition to a simple freeze . . .
will continue to grow."
Reagan said in a written statement he was
pleased that "a great number in Congress came
to recognize the threats posed by a simple
'freeze now' approach and passed amendments
that sought to improve the final resolution."

Beirut shelled for five hours
Beirut — President Amin Gemayel alerted his
fledgling air force and artillery last night for
their first combat after Christian-Druse fighting
in the hills spilled over onto Beirut. The capital
suffered its heaviest bombardment since the
end of the Israeli-Palestinian war last summer.
Senior military sources said Gemayel ordered
the air force, which consists of eight Hawker
Hunter jet fighters and a squadron of missile
equipped helicopter gunships, and the army ar
tillery to "attack and silence" the batteries that
rained shells on Beirut if they resumed the at
tack.
It had not been determined who was respon

sible for the firing.
Dozens of rockets and shells were fired into
the cit from the hills over a period of more than
five hours yesterday afternoon, killing at least
seven people and wounding 25, police said.
One shell landed near an Israeli convoy
southeast of the city, killing an Israeli sergeant
and wounding nine others, the Israeli military
command announced.
Three machine-gun rounds hit a helicopter
carrying Col. James Mead of Boston, com
mander of U.S. Marine peacekeeping forces,
who was trying to find out which side was shell
ing the city. None of the Americans were hurt,
but Mead hadtoterminate his mission abruptly.
