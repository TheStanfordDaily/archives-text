# Food service survey: food 'fair,' hours short
## 
### FELICIA LEE 
A recent survey showed that stu
dents herearesatisfied, but not over
joyed, with the quality of food and
eating facilities here. The survey was
conducted by University Facilities
and Services, and Business and Fi
nance.
While Food Service received high
marks for cleanliness and size of
serving portions, students berated
Food Service's short hours and the
lack of variety in breakfast and lunch
menus. According to the recently re
leased report which outlined the re
sults of the survey, students com
plained that they often were unable
to get breakfast before lines closed,
lunch hours sometimes interfered
with class schedules and early din
ner hours "seemed to bring on
hunger laier in the evening during
study hours."
The survey polled 2092 students,
or 62 percent of the total number
who subscribe to Food Service.
As a result of the survey's findings,
Food Service have been extended in
several residences, according to lack
Albrecht, assistant director of
Facilities and Services.
Students also asked that a greater
variety of food be served at lunch and
breakfast. In particular, students
asked that meat be served at break
fast and that more different kinds of
cereal be available.
According to the survey, 28 per
cent of the students who responded
considered breakfast variety "fair"
while 31 percent called it "poor."
The report said, however, that meat
could not be served regularly at
breakfast for financial and nutritional
reasons.
Not surprisingly, the quality of
food varied noticeably among the
different residences despite the fact
that all residences served by Food
Service follow the same menus and
recipes. According to the survey, res
idents of Wilbur and Flroence Moore
showed the most satisfaction with the
quality of food in their residences,
while residents of Stern and Lagunita
expressed the least satisfaction.

Albrecht attributed the differences
to "the human factor" involved in
food preparation. "Cooks have
different ways of doing things," he
said. He added, however, that Food
Service strives to maintain some con
sistency in the quality of food in the
different residences.
Although changes were suggested
in many areas, students were over
whelmingly pleased with the present
policy involving unlimited second
servings. According to the survey, 88
percent of the students who re
sponded supported thecontinuation
of the policy. Fven though students
frequently complained that Food
Service rates were a "rip-off" for
those who do not eat a lot, a large
majority — 81 percent — felt that in
dividuals should not have to pay
extra for seconds. The report also
said that Food Service received
"many, many comments" suggesting
the use of a pay-as-you-eat plan.
Because ot the findings, a pay-as
you-eat plan will be implemented
next year in Sterling Quad. The plan
will involve a computerized system
which will keep track of how much
food is taken.
Students also expressed some dis
content with the decor and atmos
phereof their residences. Although a
large majority of students surveyed
found the layout and arrangement of
dining rooms attractive, they were
less enthusiastic about the furnish
ing and decor in their dining
facilities. Strangely enough, a slightly
higher percentage of women than
men found the furnishings "very at
tractive."
Students said they generally found
their dining facilities comfortable
and socially inviting places to have
their meals. Over half of the students
surveyed said that they found the
comfort and noise levels in their din
ing halls acceptable "most of the
time," and more than half of the res
idents of small houses found them
acceptable "all the time."
A major complaint, however, in
volved the frequently long waits in
line for food.
