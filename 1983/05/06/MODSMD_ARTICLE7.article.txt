## Faculty senate welcomes Heller as new chair 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
Newly elected faculty senate
chairman Craig Heller said his
new position is "kind of like being
a traffic cop in Paris."
Heller, an associate professor
of biological sciences and winner
of the Walter J. Gores award for
excellence in teaching, was
elected to the post yesterday by
the faculty senate, replacing Alex
ander Fetter as chairman.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said Heller will be a "fine, intelli
gent" chairman for the group.
Fetter said the elections were
run "in a very gentlemanly, and
ladylike way . . . there were no
platforms, and people didn't get
particularly excited about them,"
he said.
According to Heller, the faculty
senate is an important body
through which faculty can helpes

tablish University policy. After is
sues are reviewed by appropriate
senate committees, they are
cleared by a steering committee
and then acted upon by the entire
senate.
Issues presented before the
senate are of University-wide
interest, and range from profes
sorial and curricular matters to
budgets and degree granting, Fet
ter said.
Items for next year's senate in
clude the University's connection
with weapons-related research
and overseas campus. Rebholz is
also seeking a senate inquiry into
the controversial relationship be
tween the Hoover Institution and
the University.
Rebholz said he feels the senate
is too apathetic. "The senate has
become a fairly boring institution.
Few subjects are arousing to the
faculty. I hope the new steering

committee will actively seek is
sues rather than present them to a
passive faculty," he said.
According to Fetter the position
of senate chairman is more pro
cedural than philosophical. "I
think it's important for the chair
man to keep a low profile, to act as
a facilitator rather than telling
people what to do," he said.
Heller agreed that his position
does not involve taking a stand.
It is the upcoming issues that are
important, not the mechanism
dealing with them," he said.
Heller also said he feels that an
important function of the senate
is to act as a regular public forum
in which direct questions can be
asked to the University president
and provost. The group meets
every two weeks, and both Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and Provost
Albert Hastorf are present at every
meeting.
