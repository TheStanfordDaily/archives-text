Jeanne Kirkpatrick blasted what she
caled "anti-Israel emotionalism" in
the U.N. at a benefit dinner for the
American Friends of the Hebrew
University last night.
Kirkpatrick denounced extremist
groups within the U.N. for their ef
forts to de-legitimize and isolate Is
rael from the international commu
nity.
"It is a slow process whose miser
able poison will be worked slowly
against the people of Israel," she
said. As she spoke at the Fairmont
Hotel, a rain-soaked crowd of about
150 protesters chanted slogans
against U.S. intervention in Central
America.
Kirkpatrick claimed the U.N. is di
vided into the Soviet, African, and
Arab blocks, and claimed that these
groups worked together to manipu
late votes for their particular inter
ests.
"The African and Arab blocks trade
off opposition to issues in order to
gain votes for their respective
causes," she said.
She also criticized the Soviets for
their role in the U.N., claiming that
they manipulate the "non-aligned
movement" in order to distract
world attention from Soviet affairs.
She cited the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan and the Soviet role in the
Middle East as attempts to sway na
tions toward Soviet policy.
"The Soviets will seek to exploit

conflicts in the Middle Fast re
gion in order to gain political sup
port." she s.iid. Kirkpatrick added
that the United States will not hesi
tate to oppose any U.N. initiatives to
de-legitimize Israel.
"Israel is not a burden to the
United States," she said, "it is a
cherished friend and a valued ally."
She denounced the "block politics
and rhetoric of hatred" within the
U.N., claiming that these gave "the
upper hand to the most extremist
members of the U.N."
Kirkpatrick also criticized the
budget of the U.N., and cited the
imbalance between funding and rep
resentative votes. She pointed to the
controversial Golan Heights initia
tive, and said that the 86 nations
which voted for the initiative collec
tively paid less than the United
States, which has only one vote.
"This initiative laid the
groundwork for the expulsion of Is
rael from the U.N.," she said, "those
without the votes are paying (for the
U.N.), and those who aren't paying
have the votes. In this way our forum
is dominated by a non-democratic
majority."
Kirkpatrick praised Camp David as
one of the best means to resolve cur
rent Middle East problems, "though it
doesn't seek to include everyone in
the negotiation process, it gives the
parties involved the chance to sit face
to face and talk things out," she said.
She also praised Secretary of State
George Shultz's efforts in the Middle
East peace process and reaffirmed the
U.S. position to find a solution "ac
ceptable to all parties involved."
