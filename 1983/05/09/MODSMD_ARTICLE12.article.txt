# The 						Archives: a valuable research facility
## 
### ELISE CHAPIN 
Entering the formidable
doors of Cecil H. Green Li
brary, fondly known as
"Old Green," and winding
back to the small elevator
marked "For Archives push
5," a visitor begins to won
der what lies beyond these
rickety confines and down
the dark hall that leads to
the Archives.
Surprisingly, the room is
filled not with musty vol
umes and faded curtains but
with a young woman sitting
behind a computer terminal
calling up various collec
tions within the Archives.
The University Archives
do not cater exclusively to
those trivia seekers who
want to see a picture of their
grandmother, but rather to
numerous administrators,
scholars and interested
browsers. According to
University Archivist
Roxanne Nilan, less than
two percent of the visitors
are there for pleasure. Sixty
percent of the users are ad

ministrators who wish to re
trieve information that their
offices have filed with the
Archives. The remaining 38
percent are scholars.
The Archives are accessi
ble to all, and as a result,
almost 3000 researchers a
year come in to borrow the
more than 8000 linear feet of
information that the Arc
hives contain. Linda Long,
the manuscripts specialist,
said that the Archives are "a
repository for any paper or
publication that comes out
of an organization" and that
they are there for the be
nefit of the public.
The numerous manu
scripts, photographs, per
sonal papers, scrapbooks,
maps, posters and other bits
of history are used by re
searchers from various in
stitutions and for various
reasons. Development of
fices from other schools
have used the records to de
termine what have been the
successes and failures of
University fund-raising.
However, when the Arc
hives split from the Special
Collections Department, it
had to limit its intake of ma
terial to those things that are
directly connected to the
University.
Because there is no re

cords management office
within the University, Nilan
said, the Archives has had to
become that office.
The Archives have been
around for a long while, al
though there has only been
a separate office since 1965.
Before that Green had a
basic stock of information
that they could use to an
swer commonly asked
questions, but they had no
formalarrangement of mate
rial.
When the Archives were
first begun by Ralph Han
son, Nilan said that he went
on a search and "raided the

attics." The ones in the pres
ident's house and Encina
Hall were among the first to
be hit. After establishing
"good relations" with the
larger offices on campus,
the Archives has tried to ex
pand their scope to include
most of the departments,
Nilan said.
The many bits of
memorabilia that have been
collected are not all within
the walls of Green Library,
though. Some things are on
loan to the Smithsonian In
stitute, various colleges, the
Bank of America and Ming's
Restaurant.
While they "try to dis
suade" people from bor
rowing items, the Archives

"encourages qualified in
stitutions to display things
properly," said Nilan.
The Archives does not
have such things as the pa
pers of former student John
Steinbeck or of Emeritus
Prof. Wallace Stegner. In
stead, Special Collections
houses these items.
Aside from the bag in
which Jane Stanford kept
her opera glasses and the
early football helmets, the
Archives has a few "plug
hats."
These hats were worn by
the juniors to signify their
class rank (as opposed to
the freshmen beanies and
the senior sombreros). Each
junior carefully painted his
h.nt with lead paint, hoping
to make it as hard as possi
ble. At the end of the year,
the juniors staged a play
called the "Plug Ugly" after
which they went to the
Quad and attacked the
seniors with their hats. The
winners of this battle would
control the turf. However,
in 1915 the University stop
ped this practice because
there were too many in
juries.
Both Nilan and Long have
stories to tell about humor
ous events that have hap
pened in the course of Uni
versity history, but they

stress the functional value
of the Archives.
In recent years, students
in classes studying the 1960s
have used the "Project
South" papers which are
transcribed interviews with
people who worked in the
South during the civil rights
movement.
When faced with the pos
sibility of closing down the
Cliveden campus, the
Overseas Study Office went
into some old files that it
had deposited in the Arc
hives to find out the reason
ing for having a campus in
Britain in the first place.
Through these files they
could understand what ad
ministrators in those days
had seen as the benefits of
the Cliveden campus.
While the Archives is
happy to assist the few
memorabilia seekers, they
are primarily interested in
helping the many re
searchers who need infor
mation on the University's
extensive history.
