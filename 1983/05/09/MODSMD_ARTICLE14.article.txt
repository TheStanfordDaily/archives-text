## The 						Stanford Daily Solidarity celebrated

"No man can be transformed into a beast of
burden," said the Polish Bishop Lech
Kraczmarek a week ago in Gdansk.
May 1 marked the largest demonstrations on
behalf of the Polish trade union Solidarity since
the anniversary of the organization last August
31. Undeterred by a government propaganda
campaign warning of the political conse
quences of further unrest, tens of thousands of
Poles took to the streets to demonstrate against
the rule of the military government of Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski.
For communist countries, International
Workers' Day is a holiday set aside for planned
celebrations of Marxism and the "dictatorship
of the proletariat." In the Soviet Union and most
of the Eastern bloc nations, the day is marked by
military parades and communist slogans like
those which take place in the Red Square in
Moscow.
In Poland also International Workers' Day, or
"May Day" as it has come to be called, was
intended to be a celebration of communism,
but it also was intended to be a showdown be
tween the forces of the government and those
who, according to Jaruzelski, wish to "sow

chaos." The government of Poland hoped that it
would achieve a victory over the forces of Sol
idarity finally proving that the organization was
no longer viable.
Throughout Poland, however, red banners
marking International Workers' Day were con
tradicted by the red and white banners of the
Solidarity movement. The participants of the
official military parade in Warsaw were de
scribed as "listless" by western journalists
covering the event, in stark, even frightening,
contrast to the fervor and violence of the
crowds as they were dispersed by the water
cannons and clubs of the police.
The latest demonstrations in Poland provide
two clear lessons: first, time alone will not grant
the military government of laruzelski the legiti
macy it so much craves. The spirit, if not the
legal standing, of Solidarity lives on.
In a broader context, the demonstrations of
the workers against the socialist government of
Poland on International Workers' Day illustrate
the systemic failure of communist goverments
to provide for even the needs of the supposed
ideologically sympathetic workers, much less
the population as a whole.
