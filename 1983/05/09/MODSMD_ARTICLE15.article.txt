# Hoover: partisans or scholars?
## 
### 
Last spring, when I told a good
friend that I would attend Stanford
next fall, he looked at me seriously
and said, "I hope you don't becomea
fascist. They have the Hoover Institu
tion out there."
With my normal wit, aplomb and
lucidity, I smiled, giggled twice, and
muttered, "Well, Hoover . . . hmm
. . . yes ... I don't know." My friend
was reassured, and I had no idea
what he was worried about. After lis
tening to the fuss about Hoover and
Stanford these past few weeks, I still
haven't found a reason to worry.
Faculty and student groups have
accused Hoover of partisanship,
which means, in this context, sup
porting Republicans and conserva
tive issues in a non-academic, unrea
soning way. George Marotta, the
publicity director for Hoover, says
that Hoover can't be partisan be
cause it can't speak, but that defense
is disingenuous. If all or most of the
fellows at Hoover behaved in a parti
san manner, it wouldn't matter
whether the Institution officially
spoke on issues or not. The real issue
is what partisanship is, and why it is
wrong.
If every time the Reagan adminis
tration announced a policy, the
Hoover fellows rushed a series of
badly done articles into print to sup
port the new policy, then the com
munity would have reason to comp
lain. That is partisan. But no such
group actions exist at the Hoover. If
anything, the Reagan administration
follows some of the Hoover fellows,
not the other way around. Hoover
does not practice partisanship, as
every dictionary I know defines the
word.
For some people, partisan seems
to mean "is connected to politics."
One petition distributor has argued

that politics have no place at a
value-neutral university. Perhaps
Stanford can be value-neutral in
some ways, although I have rny
doubts, but individuals at Stanford
cannot and should not be. Donald
Kennedy lobbies for grants and stu
dent aid. People around campus pro
test nuclear weapons at SSRL and
support the rights of minority
groups. Most of these actions have
some controversy around them, but
they are necessary and important.
Right or wrong, the issues are not to
be avoided to avoid involving Stan
ford in politics.
The root problem is not that
Hoover scholars have values and be
liefs, but what those values are. One
student petition claims that "political
interests," specifically "involvement
in the Reagan administration," may
injure the reputation of the Univer
sity. The clear implication is that any
one who advocates policies or values
that are adopted by the Republicans
should be removed from Stanford.
When I think of forms of censorship
that could hurt the Stanford reputa
tion, telling scholars to be silent be
cause people are listening is near the
top of the list.
It is true, of course, that some
scholars at Hoover support some ac
tions of the Reagan administration. It
is true that some people perceive a
pipeline between the two. But one
can hardly blame Hoover for what
people think.
In fact, partisanship is wrong not
because people have values and ex
press them, but because partisans
suppress their real values out of mis
placed loyalty to a side. It is not
wrong because it is political, but be
cause it is a forfeiture of the indi
vidual conscience that is a necessity
for every scholar.
The other accusations against

Hoover are equally vague, at least by
any evidence I have heard. The fac
ulty says that Hoover has a "hazy,
quasi-independent" status. Well,
what's wrong with that? And why
should we agitate to change it? They
complain that Hoover is two-tiered, a
sort of Trojan horse of partisan policy
advocates hiding behind reputable
scholars. But none of the scholars
seems to have noticed that state of
affairs, and I have heard no identifi
cation of those hidden in the inner
sanctum.
Words like "hazy," "quasi-,"
"two-tiered," and "biased" are sim
ply rhetorical ammunition, meant to
prejudice the discussion. But the
words are only adjectives, not
judgements in themselves, and only
their context makes them good ot
bad. Instead of arguing over precon
ceptions and prejudices, let's hear
some hard evidence on something
the Hoover has done, and why it
should be investigated.
Stanford gives a couple of million
dollars to Hoover each year, so it is
worth asking what the University
buys with the money. I imagine the
answer would be in terms of people
whose presence benefits the cam
pus, library and archive facilities and
upkeep on a campus landmark. But
somehow, the whc!e squabble does
not seem to be about cost
effectiveness.
Generally, it is wise to distrust
anyone who wants to investigate and
write new rules, but cannot clearly
and specifically state why. I have
heard no good reasons to worry
much about the Hoover, much less
to try reforming its relationship with
Stanford.

spoke on issues or not. The real issue
is what partisanship is, and why it is
wrong.
If every time the Reagan adminis
tration announced a policy, the
Hoover fellows rushed a series of
badly done articles into print to sup
port the new policy, then the com
munity would have reason to comp
lain. That is partisan. But no such
group actions exist at the Hoover. If
anything, the Reagan administration
follows some of the Hoover fellows,
not the other way around. Hoover
does not practice partisanship, as
every dictionary I know defines the
word.
For some people, partisan seems
to mean "is connected to politics."
One petition distributor has argued

that politics have no place at a
value-neutral university. Perhaps
Stanford can be value-neutral in
some ways, although I have rny
doubts, but individuals at Stanford
cannot and should not be. Donald
Kennedy lobbies for grants and stu
dent aid. People around campus pro
test nuclear weapons at SSRL and
support the rights of minority
groups. Most of these actions have
some controversy around them, but
they are necessary and important.
Right or wrong, the issues are not to
be avoided to avoid involving Stan
ford in politics.
The root problem is not that
Hoover scholars have values and be
liefs, but what those values are. One
student petition claims that "political
interests," specifically "involvement
in the Reagan administration," may
injure the reputation of the Univer
sity. The clear implication is that any
one who advocates policies or values
that are adopted by the Republicans
should be removed from Stanford.
When I think of forms of censorship
that could hurt the Stanford reputa
tion, telling scholars to be silent be
cause people are listening is near the
top of the list.
It is true, of course, that some
scholars at Hoover support some ac
tions of the Reagan administration. It
is true that some people perceive a
pipeline between the two. But one
can hardly blame Hoover for what
people think.
In fact, partisanship is wrong not
because people have values and ex
press them, but because partisans
suppress their real values out of mis
placed loyalty to a side. It is not
wrong because it is political, but be
cause it is a forfeiture of the indi
vidual conscience that is a necessity
for every scholar.
The other accusations against

Hoover are equally vague, at least by
any evidence I have heard. The fac
ulty says that Hoover has a "hazy,
quasi-independent" status. Well,
what's wrong with that? And why
should we agitate to change it? They
complain that Hoover is two-tiered, a
sort of Trojan horse of partisan policy
advocates hiding behind reputable
scholars. But none of the scholars
seems to have noticed that state of
affairs, and I have heard no identifi
cation of those hidden in the inner
sanctum.
Words like "hazy," "quasi-,"
"two-tiered," and "biased" are sim
ply rhetorical ammunition, meant to
prejudice the discussion. But the
words are only adjectives, not
judgements in themselves, and only
their context makes them good ot
bad. Instead of arguing over precon
ceptions and prejudices, let's hear
some hard evidence on something
the Hoover has done, and why it
should be investigated.
Stanford gives a couple of million
dollars to Hoover each year, so it is
worth asking what the University
buys with the money. I imagine the
answer would be in terms of people
whose presence benefits the cam
pus, library and archive facilities and
upkeep on a campus landmark. But
somehow, the whc!e squabble does
not seem to be about cost
effectiveness.
Generally, it is wise to distrust
anyone who wants to investigate and
write new rules, but cannot clearly
and specifically state why. I have
heard no good reasons to worry
much about the Hoover, much less
to try reforming its relationship with
Stanford.

A view from normalcy
Last spring, when I told a good
friend that I would attend Stanford
next fall, he looked at me seriously
and said, "I hope you don't becomea
fascist. They have the Hoover Institu
tion out there."
With my normal wit, aplomb and
lucidity, I smiled, giggled twice, and
muttered, "Well, Hoover . . . hmm
. . . yes ... I don't know." My friend
was reassured, and I had no idea
what he was worried about. After lis
tening to the fuss about Hoover and
Stanford these past few weeks, I still
haven't found a reason to worry.
Faculty and student groups have
accused Hoover of partisanship,
which means, in this context, sup
porting Republicans and conserva
tive issues in a non-academic, unrea
soning way. George Marotta, the
publicity director for Hoover, says
that Hoover can't be partisan be
cause it can't speak, but that defense
is disingenuous. If all or most of the
fellows at Hoover behaved in a parti
san manner, it wouldn't matter
whether the Institution officially
spoke on issues or not. The real issue
is what partisanship is, and why it is
wrong.
If every time the Reagan adminis
tration announced a policy, the
Hoover fellows rushed a series of
