## SSRL proposal will violate research autonomy 
### 
The "Statement of Principles Concerning Re
search," adopted by the Senate of the Academic
Council in 1971 after years of discussion and
reevaluation, is designed to protect the indi
vidual researcher's freedom of inquiry. It states
that a particular proposal should be evaluated
"based on the scholarly and educational merits
of the proposed research, and not on specula
tion concerning the political and moral impro
priety of the uses which might be made of its
results." Under this policy, University restric
tions on research may not be imposed based
upon intent or end-use; the morality, values or
political beliefs of the administration, the faculty
and the students are not to be imposed upon the
individual researcher.
By including this in the Statement of Princi
ples, the Senate acted to protect the individual
researcher's right to choose the type of research
in which he wished to become involved in, un
impeded by the moral and political judgments of
other segments of the University. The statement
concludes that its principles, "in no way di
minish, and indeed they reinforce, the individual
researcher's personal responsibility to assure
that the sources of funding for his research, and
its perceived applications, are consistent with his
own judgement and conscience."
Numerous research scientists at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator (SLAC) and the Stanford Syn
chrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) have ex
pressed, via petitions and other means, that a
research proposal submitted by Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos Na
tional Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory,
and the University of California, in their percep
tion of its potential applications, conflicts with
their judgement and conscience. At the same
time, due to the special nature of operations at
SLAC anu ojcvu, ine research woik ui many %ji
them would contribute directly and unavoidably
to that proposed research project which they
consider morally unacceptable.

A brief description of how individual's re
search work would contribute directly and unav
oidably to the proposed research project is in
order. The research of Roger Miller, a SLAC fac
ulty member, Mary lames, a graduate student,
and others is developing a refined technique
which produces for SSRL a shorter, cleaner pulse
of X-rays. These would be used by the project
proposers for the development of X-ray diagnos
tics which "are essential to understanding many
nuclear device complexities," according to the
funding request they submitted to the Depart
ment of Energy, Office of Military Applications.
The special type of X-ray pulse created through
the research of Miller, James and others for SSRL
would be employed by the project proposers to
create, according to the funding request, "new
types of fast response (X-ray) detectors to charac
terize absolutely the intensity, time, and energy
distribution of weapons-generated X-rays." The
ongoing research of Miller, lames, and others
would contribute toward the success of that pro
gram, which they consider morally unaccept
able. Miller and lames exemplify a broader group
of research scientists who consider the proposed
project unacceptable.
The right and freedom of the individual re
searcher to choose what type of research in
which he becomes involved, given his percep
tions of its potential applications, is clearly and
demonstrably diminished if the research project
is undertaken at SSRL. Many individuals would
be deprived of the responsibility to assure that
his research work "is consistent with his own
judgement and conscience." Indeed, over 67
percent of the SSRL staff and 280 SLAC staffers,
including many research scientists whose labors
would directly contribute to the research proj
ect, have stated thay they consider the project
unacceptable.
The project proposal, if it were undertaken,
would render the Statement of Principles invalid,
and so it does not conform to University research

policy. The project would contravene the spirit
of those principles as well, in that it would im
pose the values, morality, and political beliefs of
the principal investigator upon the individual re
searcher in this case.
The proposal in question, due to the nature of
operations at SLAC and SSRL, may be the first
case of its kind and magnitude to appear before
the committee. The unique set of circumstances
in which research work undertaken by certain
individuals at SLAC and SSRL is necessarily and
inextricably connected with the research under
taken by other individuals, and the fact that di
rectly weapons-related work has never before
been undertaken at SLAC or SSRL, presents the
first case of its kind which thus contravenes the
research policy.
If the proposed research project for SSRL is
accepted, then the prevailing research policy is
demonstrably insufficient to protect the indi
vidual researcher's freedom to determine that
his work is consistent with his own judgement
and conscience. Ironically, such protection is
precisely why the policy was originally enacted.
The policy does not then fairly protect Stanford
researchers from being placed in a position of
moral compromise, subject to the values and
beliefs of other researchers being imposed upon
them.
