## Marxism: ignorance implied 
### 
According to Shirish Date's column ("Marxism' nice
idea' or necessary," Daily, May 2), those of us who
oppose Marxism do so out of ignorance. I would argue
the contrary: that only out of ignorance could someone
embrace Marxism.
Date argues that I and my capitalist cohorts believe
that Marxism is unworkable because of our "partial and
incomplete understanding of Marx's writings." Yet our
self-appointed Marxism expert offers no examples of
successful Marxist societies and fails to prescribe any
formulae for the achievement thereof.
Date complains that "Too often Marx the Utopian in
stead of Marx the analytical economist is used to form
opinions regarding the practical prospects of
socialism," but he fails to realize that ideologies in and
of themselves are inert. The only logical manner in
which to examine the relative merits of ideologies is to
evaluate the systems which profess those ideologies.
Given the fact that historical reality is the only credible
yardstick forjudgingthe present and future, any "analyt
ical economic" review of past attempts to implement
Marxism would reveal to Date that "the practical pros
pects of socialism" are bleak at best. Date, however,
challenges the validity of the test of reality, implying that
it is somehow unfair that one should rely upon the
record of history to demonstrate the impossibility of
achieving Marx's ideal state.
In his banal regurgitation of The Communist Man
ifesto, Date lists three supposedly inherent characteris
tics of capitalism, which, of course, represent the seeds
of its demise. They are: the cyclical performance of
capitalist economies, the tendency to become increas
ingly capital intensive, and the tendency for social
polarization.
The fundamental flaw of Date's analysis is his failure to
understand capitalism. Capitalism is not a monolith. It is
not immutable or static. Its inherent strength is its
dynamic.
In skimming his Pelican edition of the Manifesto, Date
obviously ignored A.J.P. Taylor's exhaustive introduc
tion which elaborates upon the shortcomings of Marx's
vision. For each of the three allegedly dooming flaws of
capitalism there has arisen a remedy not anticipated by
Marx. To alleviate the ill effects of cyclical booms and
busts, we have implemented such automatic stabilizers
as unemployment insurance and progressive income
tax. Powerful labor unions inconceivable in Marx's day
have battled the tendency toward greater capital inten
sity, which has itself stimulated the evolution of a vast
post-industrial service sector. Finally, the growth and
endurance of the middle class has disproved Marx's
prophecies of revolution stemming from social polariza
tion.
Date glosses over the aforementioned developments
of capitalism which attest to its vitality and the critical
limits of a Marxian analysis. Consistent with his apparent
aversion to reality, Date argues that "Any conflict of
interest between worker and capitalist is almost always
resolved in favor of the latter." Has Date never heard of
Douglas Fraser or the United Mine Workers? Granted,
capitalist nations have not been immune to economic
dislocation, but they have proved remarkably resilient.
I stated earlier that I believe that only out of ignorance
could someone embrace Marxism. Date contends that
Marx's "social system was the means for achieving real
human freedom and true equality of opportunity."

Nothing could be turther from the truth. Where have
"the means" been implemented successfully? Marxism
is Utopian because it lacks any practical operational
structure.
"The means" that Date speaks of is the infamous "dic
tatorship of the proletariat." Central planning is the
means of a Marxist state. The concept of "from each
according to his ability and to each according to his
needs" is fundamentally contradictory to human free
dom. The individual is subordinate to the whole. While
unemployment is nonexistent so is choice. One's occu
pation, place of work, housing, education — in short,
one's life — is decided by the state. Dissent of any kind is
intolerable, for if any cog in the machine fails, the whole
process is harmed.
"But at least everyone would be equal," responds the
Marxist. THAT'S JUST THE POINT! The ultimate injustice
is forced equality. Cod, or Mother Nature or Fate did not
create people equal except in birth or death. Because
inequalities exist in nature, any system which ignores
relative advantages is fundamentally wrong.
Date condemns the inequalities of the American sys
tem and concludes that capitalism is "incompatible"
with democracy. Given the fact that for Date "democ
racy" is a mire of mediocrity, he is correct. Capitalism
punishes second-rateness with ruthless efficiency,
while it rewards excellence and enterprise lavishly. It
elicits human creativity and ingenuity, drawing forth the
best within each of us, and acknowleding our peculiar
talents.
The opposite is true of Marxism. It is a system which
seeks universal equality despite the great diversity of
humankind. Thus, initiative is discouraged by a lack of
incentive to excel. The system allows the best of human
ity to languish uninspired and unnoticed, depriving
everyone the benefits of those rare gifts. How else can
one explain the relative scarcity of innovation and de
velopment within the communist world?
Date is free to think, write, and say anything he
wishes,butnoamount of baseless babble can distort the
reality of the worldwide exodus to the capitalist nations.
Remarked John Curley in Challengers to Capitalism:
" . . . in assessing the strength of capitalism today, it is
pertinent to observe that many people in all walks of life
throughout the world wish to emigrate into the United
States, Canada, France, and Britain, and other advanced
capitalist nations. Walls, oceans, rivers and land masses
do not appear to discourage the flows of people into
these lands. This fact speaks loudly for the claim that
capitalism is still vigorous and able to inspire millions of
people."
Certainly none of these people believe that the system
is doomed!
The real writing on the wall, Date, is that millions of
people the world over prefer the challenges, risks, and
rewards of capitalism to the uninspiring mass of aver
ageness of Marxism, and they are willing to leave their
homelands in order to live under a system which en
courages the human pursuit of excellence. How many
people have ever climbed over the wall into East Berlin
or cast themselves into the South China Sea in the direc
tion of Vietnam? That's how "inevitable" your tomorrow
is!

In skimming his Pelican edition of the Manifesto, Date
obviously ignored A.J.P. Taylor's exhaustive introduc
tion which elaborates upon the shortcomings of Marx's
vision. For each of the three allegedly dooming flaws of
capitalism there has arisen a remedy not anticipated by
Marx. To alleviate the ill effects of cyclical booms and
busts, we have implemented such automatic stabilizers
as unemployment insurance and progressive income
tax. Powerful labor unions inconceivable in Marx's day
have battled the tendency toward greater capital inten
sity, which has itself stimulated the evolution of a vast
post-industrial service sector. Finally, the growth and
endurance of the middle class has disproved Marx's
prophecies of revolution stemming from social polariza
tion.
Date glosses over the aforementioned developments
of capitalism which attest to its vitality and the critical
limits of a Marxian analysis. Consistent with his apparent
aversion to reality, Date argues that "Any conflict of
interest between worker and capitalist is almost always
resolved in favor of the latter." Has Date never heard of
Douglas Fraser or the United Mine Workers? Granted,
capitalist nations have not been immune to economic
dislocation, but they have proved remarkably resilient.
I stated earlier that I believe that only out of ignorance
could someone embrace Marxism. Date contends that
Marx's "social system was the means for achieving real
human freedom and true equality of opportunity."

Nothing could be turther from the truth. Where have
"the means" been implemented successfully? Marxism
is Utopian because it lacks any practical operational
structure.
"The means" that Date speaks of is the infamous "dic
tatorship of the proletariat." Central planning is the
means of a Marxist state. The concept of "from each
according to his ability and to each according to his
needs" is fundamentally contradictory to human free
dom. The individual is subordinate to the whole. While
unemployment is nonexistent so is choice. One's occu
pation, place of work, housing, education — in short,
one's life — is decided by the state. Dissent of any kind is
intolerable, for if any cog in the machine fails, the whole
process is harmed.
"But at least everyone would be equal," responds the
Marxist. THAT'S JUST THE POINT! The ultimate injustice
is forced equality. Cod, or Mother Nature or Fate did not
create people equal except in birth or death. Because
inequalities exist in nature, any system which ignores
relative advantages is fundamentally wrong.
Date condemns the inequalities of the American sys
tem and concludes that capitalism is "incompatible"
with democracy. Given the fact that for Date "democ
racy" is a mire of mediocrity, he is correct. Capitalism
punishes second-rateness with ruthless efficiency,
while it rewards excellence and enterprise lavishly. It
elicits human creativity and ingenuity, drawing forth the
best within each of us, and acknowleding our peculiar
talents.
The opposite is true of Marxism. It is a system which
seeks universal equality despite the great diversity of
humankind. Thus, initiative is discouraged by a lack of
incentive to excel. The system allows the best of human
ity to languish uninspired and unnoticed, depriving
everyone the benefits of those rare gifts. How else can
one explain the relative scarcity of innovation and de
velopment within the communist world?
Date is free to think, write, and say anything he
wishes,butnoamount of baseless babble can distort the
reality of the worldwide exodus to the capitalist nations.
Remarked John Curley in Challengers to Capitalism:
" . . . in assessing the strength of capitalism today, it is
pertinent to observe that many people in all walks of life
throughout the world wish to emigrate into the United
States, Canada, France, and Britain, and other advanced
capitalist nations. Walls, oceans, rivers and land masses
do not appear to discourage the flows of people into
these lands. This fact speaks loudly for the claim that
capitalism is still vigorous and able to inspire millions of
people."
Certainly none of these people believe that the system
is doomed!
The real writing on the wall, Date, is that millions of
people the world over prefer the challenges, risks, and
rewards of capitalism to the uninspiring mass of aver
ageness of Marxism, and they are willing to leave their
homelands in order to live under a system which en
courages the human pursuit of excellence. How many
people have ever climbed over the wall into East Berlin
or cast themselves into the South China Sea in the direc
tion of Vietnam? That's how "inevitable" your tomorrow
is!

According to Shirish Date's column ("Marxism' nice
idea' or necessary," Daily, May 2), those of us who
oppose Marxism do so out of ignorance. I would argue
the contrary: that only out of ignorance could someone
embrace Marxism.
Date argues that I and my capitalist cohorts believe
that Marxism is unworkable because of our "partial and
incomplete understanding of Marx's writings." Yet our
self-appointed Marxism expert offers no examples of
successful Marxist societies and fails to prescribe any
formulae for the achievement thereof.
Date complains that "Too often Marx the Utopian in
stead of Marx the analytical economist is used to form
opinions regarding the practical prospects of
socialism," but he fails to realize that ideologies in and
of themselves are inert. The only logical manner in
which to examine the relative merits of ideologies is to
evaluate the systems which profess those ideologies.
Given the fact that historical reality is the only credible
yardstick forjudgingthe present and future, any "analyt
ical economic" review of past attempts to implement
Marxism would reveal to Date that "the practical pros
pects of socialism" are bleak at best. Date, however,
challenges the validity of the test of reality, implying that
it is somehow unfair that one should rely upon the
record of history to demonstrate the impossibility of
achieving Marx's ideal state.
In his banal regurgitation of The Communist Man
ifesto, Date lists three supposedly inherent characteris
tics of capitalism, which, of course, represent the seeds
of its demise. They are: the cyclical performance of
capitalist economies, the tendency to become increas
ingly capital intensive, and the tendency for social
polarization.
The fundamental flaw of Date's analysis is his failure to
understand capitalism. Capitalism is not a monolith. It is
not immutable or static. Its inherent strength is its
dynamic.
