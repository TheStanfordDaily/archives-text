# Experts debate Reagan plan for Social Security

### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
President Reagan's bipartisan plan
to insure the solvency of Social Secu
rity is "at best innocent wishful think
ing, and at worst a calculated effort to
give the U.S. public false confi
dence," Haeworth Robertson, a
former chief actuary of the Social Se
curity Administration, said in an in
formal debate Friday night in Bishop
Auditorium.
Robertson, cFiief actuary from 1975
to 1978, debated the merits of the
president's plan with Robert Ball,
commissioner of Social Security
from 1%2 to 1973.
Ball praised Reagan's plan, saying
he is "very optimistic" about the fu
ture of Social Security under Reagan's
current plan.
"The legislation is a statement of
clear intent to provide money, and to
make any necessary provisions for a
balance of input and outgo," he said.
Despite stories of bankruptcy, Ball
said the program is now on sound
financial footing and no massive
taxes will be needed to maintain it.
According to Ball, the Social Secu
rity system's survival without under
going radical change during the past
two years has proven its durability
and basic popularity.
However, Ball said he is less confi
dent about the long-term future of

Sacial Set urity because the size of the
future labor force, or "inputters into
the svctem " cannot be predicted.
Robertson said he is somewhat
less enthusiastic about Reagan's
plan. "If you're not confused, you
just don't understand the situation,"
Robertson said.
He disagreed with Ball's conten
tion that Medicare and Social Secu
rity should be considered separately
when discussing taxation. "To the
taxpayer, it's one large tax. If optimis
tic pronouncements don't apply to
the whole of Social Security, they are
inexcusably deceitful," he said.
Robertson said that the present
system is not financially viable in the
environment of the future. "We have
promised more than we can deliver.
It's a dangerous false sense of secu
rity," he said.
Claiming that the present system
discourages personal saving, re
duces national productivity, and re
wards male-dominated life patterns,
Robertson said that change in the
system is "inevitable" and that a clear
understanding of the workings of the
system is essential if it is to succeed.
Robertson said that the impetus
for change in the system must come
from the nation's young people, be
cause they will be most affected by
Social Security's future.
