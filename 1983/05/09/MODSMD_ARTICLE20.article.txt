# Stanford jazz band wins honors in recent competition

### FELICIA LEE 
A little luck and a lot of en
thusiasm were all the student
run Stanford Jazz Band
needed.
After a long period of less
than-stellar performances in
local competitions, the 19band
members surprised them
selves — and everyone else —
by receiving scores of "I"
(superior performance) from
each of the four judges at the
prestigious Pacific Coast Col
lege Jazz Festival last month.
Out of the over 300 bands that
participated in the competi
tion, several judges singled out
the Stanford Jazz Band as "one
of the best they've ever
heard," according to the
band's student director Jose
Bowen.
According to Bowen, the
band's recent success is espe
cially remarkable when viewed
in light of the band's composi
tion. While most members of
the other bands which per
formed were music majors —
some even specializing in the
study of jazz — "not one" of
Stanford's band members this
year is majoring in music,
Bowen said. This disadvantage,
he added, is compounded for
Stanford band members by the
difficulty of finding time to
practice on top of already
rigorous academic demands.
The band holds two-hour re
hearsals on Tuesdays and
Thrusdays, as well as extra ses
sions for individual sections of
the band.
Freshman band member
Jamie Smeltz agreed that the
band is definitely a strong time
commitment. Outside of
group sessions, he said, band

members generally put in "at
least three, four or five hours a
week" of individual practice.
For students such as himself
who also have jobs, Smeltz
said, the time really adds up.
The Stanford Jazz Band also
differs from most other college
jazz bands in that it is student-

Out of the over 300 bands that participated
in the competition, several judges singled
out the Stanford Jazz Band as 'one of the
best they've ever heard/

run, and this year, open to
musicians other than Stanford
students. Currently the band
counts among its members two
professors: )ohn Cudding
ton, assistant professor of
economics, plays electric
guitar and Bob Flannigan, an
associate professor in the
Graduate School of Business,
plays tenor sax.
Band members said that they
are enthusiastic about the pro
fessors' participation in the
band. They said that they find
the professors' extra years of
experience and practice help
ful to the band, and praised
their musical abilities. Stu
dents praised Flannigan's tal
ents in particular. "He's got
great chops and a great ear,"
Bowen said. Smeltz agreed,
calling him "a master musi
cian."
Despite the generation gap
between the professors and
the students, there exists virtu
ally no tension or uneasiness
between the two groups,
Bowen said.
Flannigan agreed, describ

ing the band as "a very infor
mal group." He said that he did
not feel uneasy about being di
rected by a student. "He
(Bowen) knows what he's do
ing," Flannigan said.
Besides playing in the Stan
ford band, Flannigan also plays
with various community bands

in the area, most of which are
composed of "people like my
self" — jazz enthusiasts who
are also full-time professionals
in other fields. In comparison
to these bands, he said he finds
the Stanford group "in many
aspects, a lot more fun," ad
ding that "they laugh a lot
more than mature profession
als."

Like the other band mem
bers, Flannigan said he was
pleased by the results of last
month's competition Unlike
many of the students in the
band, however, Flannigan had
never played in a competition
before. "They're a valuable
thing," he said. "I wish they
had them when I was in
school." He added that by lis
tening to the other bands, he
became aware that college
bands had become more
sophisticated since his college
days. "All bands play very ad
vanced arrangements now,"
he said.
The band's performances
usually include one formal
concert each quarter, noon
concerts at Tresidder, and oc
casional gigs at dorm parties
and off-campus affairs.
The group's most important
performance this year was its
concert in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium last Friday, which fea
tured guest trombonist Bill

Watrous. The concert was the
first in the band's history to fea
ture a guest soloist, and band
members said that they were
looking forward to performing
with Watrous. "It'll be great for
the band to play with someone
of his skill," Flannigan said,
"and I think he'll be surprised
by the skill of the band."
Bringing Watrous to Stan
ford, according to Bowen, was
not an easy matter. Getting in
touch with him, however, was
relatively easy. "I got his
number from someone and
called him up," Bowen said.
I he band held one rehearsal
with Watrous before the actual
performance, Bowen added.
Despite the work involved in
individual and group practice
and performances, band
members said they thoroughly
enjoy what they do. "Once
you're in it, you're really in it,"
Smeltz said. "It's great know
ing people enjoy listening to
you."
