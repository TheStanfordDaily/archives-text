## Card sluggers split series with USC 
### BUCK MONTANA Cub reporter 
For the third consecutive
weekend, Stanford roared
back from two conference los
ses to win the final game of the
series and cling to a one-game
lead in the series.
Veteran Mike Aldrete paced
the Cardinal attack with a
grand slam and six runs batted
in their 12-5 win over USC at
Dedeaux Field yesterday.
Stanford opened the four
game series with a 12-5 win Fri
day, but dropped both games
Saturday, and Arizona State
who is idle this weekend,
lurked only a half-game back.
But yesterday, Aldrete
went 4-for-5 from the plate as
the Cardinal fought back to a
one-game lead in the confer
ence. With three games re
maining, USC trails by two
games. Only the top two
finishers in the conference are
eligible for post-season play.
Stanford's magic number is
now two, meaning any combi
nation of Stanford wins or
Arizona State losses will give
Stanford the conference title.
The Cardinal will know Fri
day how many games they have
to win since the Arizona-
Arizona State series will be
played Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday at ASU's Packard
Stadium. Assuming the red-hot
Sun Devils sweep their three
game series against a struggl
ing Arizona ball club next
weekend, Stanford would

need to win two of their three
conference games with
California next weekend to tie
for the conference title. Since
Stanford won the series with
ASU this year, thev would be
crowned champions.
If Stanford is swept b\ Cal,
thev would need at least one
win by UCLA over USC to claim
a post-season berth.
Aldrete opened Stanford's
scoring with a two-run single in
the third inning off loser Sid
Atkins, now 7-9, and then
hammered his grand slam off
reliever Steve McGhghv in the
sixth. Mickey Meister, who
pitched one inning, walked
two batters and hit a third to
load the bases tor Aldrete be
fore being replaced by
McChghy.
Eric Hardgrave hit his 20th
homer of the season in the fifth
inning to pad his Stanford
one-season record and take
the conference lead. The old
Stanford record was 13.
John Verducci went for
2-for-4 and drove in two runs.
Mark Davis went 2-for-5 with a
triple and scored three runs.
John Radtke went seven in
nings for the Cardinal and im
proved his record to 2-2.
Stanford is now 34-15-1 over
all and 17-10 conference. ASU
is 16-11 in the conference and
USC is one game farther back
at 15-12. Arizona, UCLA and
California are out of the playoff
picture.
After getting off to a promis

ing start in Friday night's 12-5
trouncing of the Trojans, Stan
ford dropped Saturday's
double-headerâ€”l 3-2 and 8-6.
In Saturday's afternoon con
test, USC ripped freshman
starter Kevin Kunkel for eight
earned runs on only seven hits
before David Harris came on in

the sixth.
Stanford's runs came on a
pair of solo home runs by
Hardgrave and Davis. Aldrete
had three hits in four at bat, but
did not score. Bob Cun
narsson, now 5-4, picked up
the win after scattering eight
hits over eight innings and giv

ing up only two runs.
Stanford's regular season
concludes in a three-game
series with Cal next weekend.
Friday's 2:30 p.m. game and
Sunday's 1 p.m. game will be
held at Sunken Diamond while
Saturday's 1 p.m. contest will
be held at Cal.
