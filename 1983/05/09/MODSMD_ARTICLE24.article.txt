# Women await NCAAs
## Netters beat SDSU, lose to UCLA

The Stanford women's ten
is team beat San Diego State
4 Friday and lost to UCLA 7-2
day later.
The loss to the Bruins in all
probability will lower the Car
dinal to the fourth seeding at
the NCAA Championships,
|vvhich begin Saturday in Al
j'luquerque, N.M. And a No. 4
' feeding means Stanford will
Have to face undefeated and
Bio. 1-ranked USC in the semi
-finals.
| The split of the Southern
Kalifornia road trip, which
| ended the regular season, left
; Stanford at 18-4 overall and in
■hird place in the WCAA at 9-3.
Stanford's only losses have
jcome against UCLA and USC.
| But things are not that bad
Ifor coach Frank Brennan and
Mi is netwomen. In fact, things
I might even be better than if
IvStanford had indeed defeated
K(CLA Saturday.
"I thought we wanted to be
seded two or three," Brennan
aid. "But now UCLA looks
ery, very good. UCLA may be
he best team in the country
rifight now."

Senior team captain Caryn
Copeland, who was the only
Card netter to win a singles
match against the Bruins,
echoed Brennan's sentiments.
"I don't mind playing USC (in
the semis). I don't think they
have very good doubles.
"And I'm not trying to ra
tionalize our loss to UCLA."
There were bright spots for
Stanford, however.
The victory over San Diego
State was the second of the
year for the Cardinal. Since
Stanford will most likely enter
the NCAAs seeded fourth and
the Aztecs fifth, the two teams
— barring a first-round upset
— will meet in the quarterfi
nals.
"By beating San Diego, I feel
confident against them,"
Brennan said. "I don't feel ad
verse about playing them in the
quarterfinals."
Another bright spot was
Copeland's 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 win
over UCLA's Patty Barg, a pro
ven player on the national cir
cuit. Copeland then teamed
with junior Michelle Weiss to
beat the Bruin pair of Karen
Dewis and Helena Manset at
No. 1 doubles 1-6, 6-3, 7-5, av

enging a loss to them last
month.
But for every spot of sun,
there were two or three dark
clouds.
The Cardinal's No. 1 netter,
Elise Burgin, was defeated
twice in the two-day road trip
— by San Diego State's Micki
Schillig and UCLA's Heather
Ludloff. To call the losses up
sets, however, might be a bit
too strong.
Although Burgin entered the
weekend as the nation's No.
l-ranked singles player with a
16-0 record in dual matches,
"She wasn't match-tough,"
Brennan said, referring to the
various injuries and illnesses
that have plagued her this sea
son.
Furthermore, Schillig and
Ludloff are no slouches when it
comes to a tennis match. Schil
lig lost to Stanford's Alycia
Moulton last year in the NCAA
singles finals and Ludloff, a
very inconsistent player, is de
vastating when she's on.
Against UCLA, the Cardinal
lost five of the six singles as the
Bruins put the victory and sole
possession of second place in
the WCAA away early.
