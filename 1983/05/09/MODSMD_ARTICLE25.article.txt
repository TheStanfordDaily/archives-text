Sunny's Halo wins Derby
Louisville — Sunny's Halo earned $426,000
from a purse of $531,000 and paid $7, $4.80
and $4 after racing the VA miles in 2:02 over a
track that was fast but made "greasy" by a rain
that hit 42 minutes before post time.
It was the first rainy Derby day since 1970
when Dust Commander won, and the first
time the race was run in the rain since Proud
Clarion won in 1967.
Most of the crowd of 134,444, which bet a
record $5,546,977 on the Derby, was sent
scurrying for cover by the rain. The majority
got soaked.
Sunny's Halo joined Omar Khayyam, 1917,
and Tomy Lee, 1959, both foaled in England,
and Northern Dancer, 1964, of Canada, as the
only Derby winners foaled outside the Unit
ed States.
