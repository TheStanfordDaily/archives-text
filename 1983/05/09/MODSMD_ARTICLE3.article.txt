# Two freshmen push for new local frat chapter
## 
### JULIE HAGEN Staff writer 
Two freshmen looking for an op
portunity to make friends and earn
an "ego trip" are working to form a
University chapter of the national
fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu.
An effort made four years ago to
build a Sigma Alpha Mu chapter here
failed, but this time Ethan Orlinsky
and Mark Weis, the two freshman,
are enthusiastic and determined to
succeed.
The two became interested in start
ing a chapter when a national field
secretary for the fraternity contacted
Weis and other University students
about a month ago to discuss build
ing a chapter here.
Since then Orlinsky and Weis,
along with four other charter mem
bers of the new fraternity, have been
working furiously to publicize and
promote Sigma Alpha Mu among
students here anH to garner recogni

tion Doth from the University and the
national chapter.
"We're actually not a chapter yet.
We're a colony," Weis said. "To gain
chapter status one of the things we
have to demonstrate is the ability to
draw pledges, and that we'll have to
find out next spring because we can't
rush, obviously, until next spring."
Presently, Sigma Alpha Mu is con
ducting a sort of informal rush, con
tacting people all over campus and
accepting calls from anyone in
terested in learning more about the
fraternity.
Orlinsky stressed that while they
are not looking for a certain type of
person, they are looking for people
with leadership qualities who are wil
ling to make a commitment and de
vote timeand energy toward creating
a new fraternity.
In return for this time commit
ment, Orlinsky and Weis believe that
Sigma Alpha Mu can offer some
things which an established frater
nity cannot. These include im
mediate involvement, with an equal
say in the development of the iden
tity and personality of the fraternity,
along with the building of the tradi
tions of the group.
"The thing that's going to be
different about starting it, that would
be different from joining one that's
already here, is the fact that we're all
going to be working so closely to
gether getting it working. We'll all be
that much closer than if we joined an
established fraternity," Weis said.
Students often ask the two why
they are trying to start a new chapter
and how it will be different from
existing fraternities.
"We're not going to say that we're
different from the other fraternities. I
mean, obviously right now we are,
but eventually we want to become a
part of the 'Creek life' here. We don't

have to be stereotyped as just
another fraternity. We can be
different, hut we do want to get in
volved with fraternity life, too," Weis
said.
"We'd like to emphasize social,
but just as much as social, academic
and intellectual kinds of endeavors.
There's no limit," Orlinsky said.
A problem that the Sammies, as
members of Sigma Alpha Mu are
called, may face here is combatting
the image of Sigma Alpha Mu as an
exclusively lewish fraternity. Al
though it was designed to be a lewish
fraternity when it was founded in
New York 75 years ago, the organiza
tion has long since abandoned the
practice of any kind of religious dis
crimination in membership selec
tion.
"Even though we are no longer a
lewish fraternity, the reputation still
remains, and we don't want anybody
to think that we're a Jewish fraternity
and in thinking that to just knock us
off their list," Weis stressed.
Another problem they have found
in publicizing the fraternity is that as

freshmen, it somewhat difficult
for them to speak with many up
perclassmen in the course of their
day. Orlinsky said that they are look
ing for ways to reach more up
perclassmen who may be interested.
Strangely enough, the people
working to create a chapter here
have received valuable support from
the UC-Berkeley chapter of Sigma
Alpha Mu. "It seems they want us to
have a chapter as much as we do,"
Orlinsky said.
The two freshmen said they are
confident that, with or without rec
ognition, Sigma Alpha Mu will join
other fraternities here in traditional
rush next spring.
If things go well for the fraternity,
Orlinsky foresees "a kind of a
brotherhood, not necessarily just a
bunch of guys getting together, but
having a certain thing to stand for
that we all believe in and kind of have
some sort of unity between us that
we can be proud of and stand out and
be happy with ourselves, in terms of
ourselves and the organization."
