Soviets build new bases in Siberia
Moscow — The Soviet Union is building new bases
in Siberia that would double the number of medium
range SS-20 missiles targeted on Asia and the Near
East, two newspapers reported yesterday.
Reagan administration officials said satellite photo
grapns show the the missile bases are currently being
built, The New York Times reported.
Officials told the Times that the photos were taken
several months ago, but officials only recently de
termined the sites were for the SS-20s.
The Los Angeles Times quoted "informed Western
sources," in reporting that the bases, which are in var
ious stages of completion, would approximately
double its current force of 108 missiles now deployed
in the eastern Soviet Union.

Each of the missiles has a range of 5000 kilometers,
or 3100 miles, and carries three independently
targetable, 150-kiloton nuclear warheads.
The locations of the new bases — east and west of
Lake Baikal in southern Siberia — indicate that most
of the new missiles are to be targeted on China, Japan
and other Asian countries, the Los Angeles news
paper said.
And while none of the bases are said to be within
striking distance of Western Europe, the Los Angeles
Times said some are within range of Turkey, a mem
ber of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
Shultz ends Mideast shuttle
Paris — Secretary of State George Shultz ended his
two-week Mideast shuttle yesterday and flew to Paris
from Beirut after expressing anger that Syria and Israel
had not stopped the fighting in areas in Lebanon un
der their control.
There was a brief suspension of the heavy shelling
in the mountains outside Beirut during Shultz's brief
visit there earlier in the day, but the bombardments
resumed after he left.
I hose countries that are occupying Lebanese soil
have the responsibility to control any fire from areas
they occupy," Shultz said at the Beirut airport.
While in Paris, Shultz will attend a ministerial meet
ing of the 24-nation Organization for Economic Co
operation and Development and meet with President
Francois Mitterrand.
Shultz ended his strenuous Middle East tour by
briefing Lebanese and Israeli officials on Syria's strong
objections to the tentative agreement on troop with
drawals from Lebanon.
A senior U.S. official told reporters during the flight
to Paris that Shultz's statement about the fighting in
Lebanon was an admonition for Syria and Israel to

Swedes search for Soviet minisubs
Sundsvall, Sweden — The navy detained a Soviet
tanker for four hours yesterday while search squads
hunted nearby for suspected Soviet minisubmarines
that have eluded mines, depth charges and sophisti
cated sonar for 11 days.
A Swedish pilot boat finally escorted the 300-foot
tanker Auseklis through a mine field in Sundsvall Bay,
where naval vessels dumped 14 depth charges Satur
day in fruitless attempts to force the alien intruders to
surface.
An anti-sub helicopter and search boat cruised
nearby for possible underwater movements as the
tanker steamed out to sea.The Soviet vessel had sailed
into port Saturday to unload methanol from Libya.
There had been fears that minisubs believed to be
inside the mine field would sneak to safety under the
ship's hull. But navy officials said their electronic sub
detection gear could discover any minisub trying to
escape.
The navy's search command was deciding on an in
dividual basis whether to allow commercial vessels in
and out of the area. The command invoked a World
War II emergency law Saturday night to prevent non
resident civilians from entering some islands and to
stop all sea and aerial traffic.
The navy took the measure after reporters watched
from close range Saturday as the Swedes dumped 14
depth charges within 2Vi hours.

Koch discusses Hitler 'diaries'
Frankfurt, West Germany — A top editor of Stern
magazine who resigned after the purported Hitler
diaries were labeled fraudulent said yesterday he
fears there "may be an ugly story" behind Stern's
purchase and publication of the documents.
"I don't know who wrote them," former Stern edi
tor-in-chief Peter Koch said during a telephone in
terview with The Associated Press from his Hamburg
home.
"As far as I know maybe Heidemann wrote them,
but I don't think so," Koch said, referring to the Stern
reporter who said he had tracked down the
purported diaries of Adolf Hitler in East Germany.
Koch and Felix Schmidt, two of Stern's three chief
editors, stepped down Saturday, one day after the
West German government said chemical testsand his
torical analysis had shown the 62 volumes of diaries
and other writings were "obvious fakes."
Stern has promised to tell its readers this week how
it got the documents and decided to publish them.
The Hamburg-based Welt am Sonntag newspaper
said in an unattributed report yesterday that Chan
cellor Helmut Kohl has ordered the secret service to
find out whether the East bloc was to blame for the
forgerv of Hitler's "secret diaries" as some reports
have suggested. Other speculation centers on former
Nazis and Nazi supporters.
Pakistan expels diplomat
Islamabad, Pakistan — Afghan authorities an
nounced yesterday they have declared an American
diplomat person non grata and ordered him to leave
the country within 48 hours.
State-run Radio Kabul said the diplomat, whom it
identfied as Peter Graham, was found guilty of dis
tributing "illegal magazines."
The broadcast, monitored here, said the expulsion
order was sent to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. It gave no
other details.
U.S. diplomats in the Pakistani capital were unable
to confirm that Graham works for the American mis
sion in Kabul or say how many staffers are posted
there.
It is believed to be the first time a U.S. diplomat has
been expelled from Kabul since the Soviet-backed
government came to power December 1979.
Afghan president Babrak Karmal is known to keepa
close rein on foreign diplomats, who are not allowed
to travel outside a 10-mile radius of the city.

Swedes search for Soviet minisubs
Sundsvall, Sweden — The navy detained a Soviet
tanker for four hours yesterday while search squads
hunted nearby for suspected Soviet minisubmarines
that have eluded mines, depth charges and sophisti
cated sonar for 11 days.
A Swedish pilot boat finally escorted the 300-foot
tanker Auseklis through a mine field in Sundsvall Bay,
where naval vessels dumped 14 depth charges Satur
day in fruitless attempts to force the alien intruders to
surface.
An anti-sub helicopter and search boat cruised
nearby for possible underwater movements as the
tanker steamed out to sea.The Soviet vessel had sailed
into port Saturday to unload methanol from Libya.
There had been fears that minisubs believed to be
inside the mine field would sneak to safety under the
ship's hull. But navy officials said their electronic sub
detection gear could discover any minisub trying to
escape.
The navy's search command was deciding on an in
dividual basis whether to allow commercial vessels in
and out of the area. The command invoked a World
War II emergency law Saturday night to prevent non
resident civilians from entering some islands and to
stop all sea and aerial traffic.
The navy took the measure after reporters watched
from close range Saturday as the Swedes dumped 14
depth charges within 2Vi hours.

diaries were labeled fraudulent said yesterday he

editors, stepped down Saturday, one day after the

it got the documents and decided to publish them.

Soviets build new bases in Siberia
Moscow — The Soviet Union is building new bases
in Siberia that would double the number of medium
range SS-20 missiles targeted on Asia and the Near
East, two newspapers reported yesterday.
Reagan administration officials said satellite photo
grapns show the the missile bases are currently being
built, The New York Times reported.
Officials told the Times that the photos were taken
several months ago, but officials only recently de
termined the sites were for the SS-20s.
The Los Angeles Times quoted "informed Western
sources," in reporting that the bases, which are in var
ious stages of completion, would approximately
double its current force of 108 missiles now deployed
in the eastern Soviet Union.

Each of the missiles has a range of 5000 kilometers,
or 3100 miles, and carries three independently
targetable, 150-kiloton nuclear warheads.
The locations of the new bases — east and west of
Lake Baikal in southern Siberia — indicate that most
of the new missiles are to be targeted on China, Japan
and other Asian countries, the Los Angeles news
paper said.
And while none of the bases are said to be within
striking distance of Western Europe, the Los Angeles
Times said some are within range of Turkey, a mem
ber of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
