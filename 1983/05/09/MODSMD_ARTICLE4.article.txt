Soviets build new bases in Siberia
Moscow — The Soviet Union is building new bases
in Siberia that would double the number of medium
range SS-20 missiles targeted on Asia and the Near
East, two newspapers reported yesterday.
Reagan administration officials said satellite photo
grapns show the the missile bases are currently being
built, The New York Times reported.
Officials told the Times that the photos were taken
several months ago, but officials only recently de
termined the sites were for the SS-20s.
The Los Angeles Times quoted "informed Western
sources," in reporting that the bases, which are in var
ious stages of completion, would approximately
double its current force of 108 missiles now deployed
in the eastern Soviet Union.

Each of the missiles has a range of 5000 kilometers,
or 3100 miles, and carries three independently
targetable, 150-kiloton nuclear warheads.
The locations of the new bases — east and west of
Lake Baikal in southern Siberia — indicate that most
of the new missiles are to be targeted on China, Japan
and other Asian countries, the Los Angeles news
paper said.
And while none of the bases are said to be within
striking distance of Western Europe, the Los Angeles
Times said some are within range of Turkey, a mem
ber of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
