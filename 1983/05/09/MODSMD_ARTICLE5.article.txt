While everyone else enjoyed the sunny weather Sunday, a small
group of first-year staffers worked to produce today's Daily. To
day's issue, the annual first-year staffer's issue, was produced solely
by rookie Daily personnel. But it wasn't quite as easy as that. A
larger group of people, including those shown above, worked to
sabotage the "cub" staffers' efforts. The first-year staffers suffered
through missing chairs and phone receivers, dozens of crank phone
calls, a locked photo darkroom, altered computer programs, fake
story leads and generally uncooperative veteran Daily staffers, all
for the sake of the daily news.
