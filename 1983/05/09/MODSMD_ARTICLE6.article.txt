# Draw results due out today

Round one results are in. The 4314
students who participated in the
spring 1983 housing draw will dis
cover this morning whether their
accommodations next fall will be a
dream, a nightmare, or a mystery
until Round Two results are released
in late May.
According to Rodger Whitney, as
sistant dean of student affairs and di
rector of student housing, students
have three options once they view
Round One results — besides the
traditional wailing and gnashing of
teeth. "First of all, students can ac
cept their Round I assignments by
filing Draw Card Two," Whitney said.
"Otherwise, they can do two things:
drop out of the draw completely, or
do nothing at all — which means that
they will participate in Round Two of
the draw." In Round Two, a student
is guaranteed their original assign
ment or something listed higher on
their draw card, though they cannot
change what is listed on the card.
"There are probably some stu
dents who don't want to do any bet
ter than they did in Round One,"
Whitney said. "These students
should remember to accept their as
signment, so they don't go through
Round Two."
All of this is of course irrelevent to
the approximately 1200 students who

haven't been assigned anywhere yet
— and who are competing for about
660 remaining spaces. According to
Whitney, all guaranteed females and
unguaranteed females with draw
numbers lower than 946 have been
assigned. But 85 men who have hous
ing guarantees will not be assigned
until Round Two, when RAs and
those accepting fraternity bids have
dropped out ot the draw. "The
guarantees of those 85 men will eas
ily be met," he said, and added that
last year there were 283 men who
were not assigned during the first
round.
In fact, there are still some draw
assignable spaces that have not been
filled. Because only students with
priorities are assigned to special
priority houses during the first draw,
spaces remain in East House, Haus
Mitteleuropa, La Maison Francaise,
Columbae, Synergy and Terra. "East
House has spaces for both men and
women," Whitney said, "and the rest
have spaces available to men." He
explained that if a student listed one
of these houses and did not get a
priority for it, they still have an op
portunity to do so before Round Two
of the draw.
"Any student interested in getting
a priority should do so before Tues
day, May 10," Whitney said.
