# Draw results due out today
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Round one results are in. The 4314
students who participated in the
spring 1983 housing draw will dis
cover this morning whether their
accommodations next fall will be a
dream, a nightmare, or a mystery
until Round Two results are released
in late May.
According to Rodger Whitney, as
sistant dean of student affairs and di
rector of student housing, students
have three options once they view
Round One results — besides the
traditional wailing and gnashing of
teeth. "First of all, students can ac
cept their Round I assignments by
filing Draw Card Two," Whitney said.
"Otherwise, they can do two things:
drop out of the draw completely, or
do nothing at all — which means that
they will participate in Round Two of
the draw." In Round Two, a student
is guaranteed their original assign
ment or something listed higher on
their draw card, though they cannot
change what is listed on the card.
"There are probably some stu
dents who don't want to do any bet
ter than they did in Round One,"
Whitney said. "These students
should remember to accept their as
signment, so they don't go through
Round Two."
All of this is of course irrelevent to
the approximately 1200 students who

haven't been assigned anywhere yet
— and who are competing for about
660 remaining spaces. According to
Whitney, all guaranteed females and
unguaranteed females with draw
numbers lower than 946 have been
assigned. But 85 men who have hous
ing guarantees will not be assigned
until Round Two, when RAs and
those accepting fraternity bids have
dropped out ot the draw. "The
guarantees of those 85 men will eas
ily be met," he said, and added that
last year there were 283 men who
were not assigned during the first
round.
In fact, there are still some draw
assignable spaces that have not been
filled. Because only students with
priorities are assigned to special
priority houses during the first draw,
spaces remain in East House, Haus
Mitteleuropa, La Maison Francaise,
Columbae, Synergy and Terra. "East
House has spaces for both men and
women," Whitney said, "and the rest
have spaces available to men." He
explained that if a student listed one
of these houses and did not get a
priority for it, they still have an op
portunity to do so before Round Two
of the draw.
"Any student interested in getting
a priority should do so before Tues
day, May 10," Whitney said.
Priorities for students interested in
waitlisting at any special-priority
houses are available until |une 13.
Once fraternities are tilled and RAs
are hired, more spaces will become
available tor students. "There are
5450 spaces in the housing system,'
Whitney said, "and we till about 3100
through the draw." The rest of the
spaces, Whitney explained, are
draw-exempt; about 500 fraternity
spaces, IbO RA spaces and 16*00
freshman spaces.
The new housing at Governor's
Corners has definitely improved a

student s chances of getting hous
ing; Whitney explained that tHpre
were about 250 more students who
entered the draw, yet a larger per
centage of the students were as
signed housing. "About 71 percent
of all students who drew were in the
assignable pool," Whitney said, "as
opposed to 65 percent last vear."
In addition to providing more
housing, Governor's Corners has
given students a chance at better
housing. Whitney said that the cutoff
numbers were generally higher this
year than before — with the excep
tion of Manzanita Park.
"We now have 60 spaces available
in Manzanita through the draw," he

explained. "Last year there were
450."
Ihe most popular places seemed
to be Murray and Yost Houses; least
popular are the theme houses and
coops which still remain unfilled.
Whitney said that there were "no
problems" with this year's draw, and
nothing unusual about it, except that
the numbers I and 5000 had both
been drawn. "This is the first draw I
can remember when both were
drawn," he said, and added that
number 5000 was one of the lucky
"assignable" 71 percent.
"As I remember, the student had
returning residence priority," Whit
ney said.

filing Draw Card Two," Whitney said.
"Otherwise, they can do two things:
drop out of the draw completely, or
do nothing at all — which means that
they will participate in Round Two of
the draw." In Round Two, a student
is guaranteed their original assign
ment or something listed higher on
their draw card, though they cannot
change what is listed on the card.
"There are probably some stu
dents who don't want to do any bet
ter than they did in Round One,"
Whitney said. "These students
should remember to accept their as
signment, so they don't go through
Round Two."
All of this is of course irrelevent to
the approximately 1200 students who

haven't been assigned anywhere yet
— and who are competing for about
660 remaining spaces. According to
Whitney, all guaranteed females and
unguaranteed females with draw
numbers lower than 946 have been
assigned. But 85 men who have hous
ing guarantees will not be assigned
until Round Two, when RAs and
those accepting fraternity bids have
dropped out ot the draw. "The
guarantees of those 85 men will eas
ily be met," he said, and added that
last year there were 283 men who
were not assigned during the first
round.
In fact, there are still some draw
assignable spaces that have not been
filled. Because only students with
priorities are assigned to special
priority houses during the first draw,
spaces remain in East House, Haus
Mitteleuropa, La Maison Francaise,
Columbae, Synergy and Terra. "East
House has spaces for both men and
women," Whitney said, "and the rest
have spaces available to men." He
explained that if a student listed one
of these houses and did not get a
priority for it, they still have an op
portunity to do so before Round Two
of the draw.
"Any student interested in getting
a priority should do so before Tues
day, May 10," Whitney said.
Priorities for students interested in
waitlisting at any special-priority
houses are available until |une 13.
Once fraternities are tilled and RAs
are hired, more spaces will become
available tor students. "There are
5450 spaces in the housing system,'
Whitney said, "and we till about 3100
through the draw." The rest of the
spaces, Whitney explained, are
draw-exempt; about 500 fraternity
spaces, IbO RA spaces and 16*00
freshman spaces.
The new housing at Governor's
Corners has definitely improved a

student s chances of getting hous
ing; Whitney explained that tHpre
were about 250 more students who
entered the draw, yet a larger per
centage of the students were as
signed housing. "About 71 percent
of all students who drew were in the
assignable pool," Whitney said, "as
opposed to 65 percent last vear."
In addition to providing more
housing, Governor's Corners has
given students a chance at better
housing. Whitney said that the cutoff
numbers were generally higher this
year than before — with the excep
tion of Manzanita Park.
"We now have 60 spaces available
in Manzanita through the draw," he

explained. "Last year there were
450."
Ihe most popular places seemed
to be Murray and Yost Houses; least
popular are the theme houses and
coops which still remain unfilled.
Whitney said that there were "no
problems" with this year's draw, and
nothing unusual about it, except that
the numbers I and 5000 had both
been drawn. "This is the first draw I
can remember when both were
drawn," he said, and added that
number 5000 was one of the lucky
"assignable" 71 percent.
"As I remember, the student had
returning residence priority," Whit
ney said.
