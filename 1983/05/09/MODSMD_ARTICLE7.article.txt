# Presides over moot court
## Rehnquist praises Law School students 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist,
after hearing Friday the final arguments of the
Law School moot court competition, c.illed the
advocacy "excellent" and said the arguments
were "well above the median of what we regu
larly hear in (the U.S. Supreme) Court."
The moot court, composed of Rehnquist, Dis
trict Court justice Zita Weinshienk and Appeals
Court Justice Arthur Alarcon, heard a hypotheti
cal case, Alvarez vs. Cory, which involved the
Immigration and Naturalization Servi< e (INS)
practice of making factory "sweeps" for the pur
pose of identifying and arresting employees who
are in this country illegally.
Rehnquist said the case, developer) by the
Stanford Moot Court Board, was outstanding be
cause it "combined a significant constitutional
issue which has main-stream implications in con
stitutional law together with the complex ques
tion of class certification." A similar case will be
heard by the Supreme Court later this vear, ac
cording to Michael Gennaco, board president.
Finalists Eva Marie Carney and Lisa Landsverk
argued that the INS practice was umonstitu
tional because it violated the "Fourth Amend
ment's reasonableness requirement.' Carney
said the sweeps were unconstitutional because

there was no "individualized suspicion of illegal
alienage for each person detained" in the course
of the sweeps and because the "seizure was the
least intrusive means available to the INS."
Landsverk also argued that the decision of a
lower court to deny class action certification was
an "abuse of discretion." She said disagreement
among members of the class was not cause for
denying class certification and that certification
was necessary to "provide effective relief."
Opposing finalists Duncan Matteson and How
ard Weinberg argued that the sweep was "both
reasonable and constitutional." Matteson ar
gued that "Fourth Amendment restrictions were
not implicated because there was no seizure.
The INS procedure was reasonable because in
trusion was minimal (and) justified by the signifi
cant government interest in apprehending illegal
aliens."
Weinberg said the district court's decision to
deny class certification was correct because of
the "economic antagonism of dissenting class
members" and the lack of "homogeny of inter
est" among class members.
The competitors were interrupted often with
pointed questions from the jurists. Matteson
drew good-natured laughter from the audience
when Weinshienk asked him what factors
besides appearance determined which factory

workers were questioned by the INS. Matteson
answered that the agents question people who
perhaps are not dressed in an American way."
After hearing the arguments, the justices re
tired to decide the case, not on its merits, but on
the merits of the competitors.
The award for the best team overall went to
Matteson and Weinberg. Carney and Landsverk
won the award for the best legal brief and Wein
berg was deemed best oral advocate.
Weinberg said, "I think everybody was ner
vous, but it was less threatening than we antici
pated. I was humbled and surprised to win the
best advocate award. Still, the best thing to come
out of the moot court competition was the
friendship that developed between Matt (Matte
son) and me."
Weinshienk said the briefs were "absolutely
outstanding" and the "oral arguments were tre
mendous, especially because we gave you such a
difficult time." She said the proceedings were
"great fun" tor the jurists. "I'm not sure its been
great for the competitors, though," she joked.
Alarcon said the arguments of the competitors
fell within the "top 10 percent of the advocacy I
hear. I'm very impressed with your law school
and its product."
