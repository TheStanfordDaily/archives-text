Chemistry Prof, lames Collman has received the
( alifornia Scientist of the Year Award from the California
Museum of Science and Industry.
Collman was selected by a nine member panel which
included Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky, director of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center.
Collman, who was recently charged with Honor Code
violations by Council of Presidents member Mark Eps
tein, received the $5000 award for experimenting with
methods of achieving superconductivity—extremely
low resistance to electric current—in synthetic materi
als.
A simple, inexpensive method of creating supercon
ductivity could bring abundant energy to the world at
low cost and revolutionize existing power systems.

Presently the only known method to overcome elec
trical resistance is to lower the temperature of the wires
that carry electric current to around absolute zero,
which is both expensive and impractical.
Collman's experiments are designed to produce a
new class of materials which will test a proposal by
Stanford Physics Prof. Bill Little, who has speculated that
a different type of superconductivity could exist at much
higher temperatures than is now possible with tradi
tional superconduction.
A University faculty member since 1967, Collman
holds the George and Hilda Daubert professorship in
chemistry. A member of the National Academy of Sci
ences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
he received a dean's award for distinguished teaching
from the School of Humanities and Sciences in 1981.
