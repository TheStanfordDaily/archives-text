The fudge with a message
TODAY'S MESSAGE IS:
God bless all the beautifully brave and sincere Stanford
students and teachers who have circulated and signed the
petition that sheds light on some of the covert activities of
the Hoover Institute. We all know the Hoover Institute has
made many positive contributions to society. However
developing policy and techniques that fosters terrorism by
destabilizing certain countries that are not cooperative with
multinational corporations is certainly not one of them.
Today is the firsl day of the rest of your life.
Have a good one!
Personal to J.E.: I wouldn't want to play football in
Baltimore either, even if Jesus was quarterback, too cold for
me too!
PS. I need help with my free soup kitchen — anyone
interested may contact me through POB 5834, Berkeley
