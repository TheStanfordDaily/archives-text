# Students, faculty introduce new petitions on Hoover
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
As evidence of the growing
Hoover controversy, two new peti
tions came into existence this
week—one a conservative faculty re
sponse, and the other a formal re
statement of the initial student peti
tion signed by 1500 members of the
Stanford community.
The proposed probe into the rela
tionship between the University and
the Hoover Institution has led con
cerned faculty members to draw up
an alternative response to the ques
tions raised, according to Prof. Al
phonse Juilland, chairman of the
French and Italian departments. The
petition originated in an effort to
dispel the false impression that the
University faculty as a body is ques
tioning the Hoover Institution, Juil
land said.
"The matter has been presented as
a conflict between the Stanford fac
ulty and Hoover," Juilland said, "but
only 69 members of the faculty have
signed the original petition and there
are almost 1000 members of the

Academic Council."
JuiHand said he and other faculty
members are also concerned about
"the dangerous precedent" such an
investigation would represent "both
inside and outside the University."
"This presents a very grave threat to
academic freedom," he said. "We
are all convinced that no such inves
tigation would be contemplated if
Hoover's bias were liberal rather
than conservative."
"We see this as a liberal witch-hunt
of conservatives," said Jui Hand.
"This may spread from the tower to
the quad—there is no reason why
they couldn't investigate the political
bias of departments next."
"There are departments at Stan
ford whose political bias is more
marked than Hoover's," he said. "If
certain things are improper at
Hoover they can't be proper in Stan
ford departments can they?"
Furthermore, "Hoover isn't the
only think tank associated with a
University and an investigation at
Stanford could ignite similar investi
gations at other universities," Juil

land said.
luilland said that by circulating the
petition, he aims to inform his col
leagues in the Faculty Senate of the
opposing petition. Finally, he in
ends to release to the public the
names of those signing the petition,
he said.
The student petition, a 12-page
legal document requesting a "for
mal inquiry was filed with the Uni
versity's board of trustees yesterday.
Drawn up in support of the 1500
people who signed the previous
student-initiated petition, the legal
document asks that an independent
board examine the Hoover Institu
tion's impact on the University's
academic integrity, faculty indepen
dence and national reputation.
Fhe petition was prepared and
tiled on behalf of the ad hoc Stanford
Students for Academic Truth (SAT)
by Public Advocates, Inc., a public
interest law firm based in San Fran
cisco.
Dan Cohen and Jim Steyer, both
third-year law students, submitted
the lengthy document in order to

"formalize" their concerns, Steyer
said.
"All of us involved feel this is a very
serious issue and want it to be seen in
that light," Steyer said. The petition
clarifies the specific areas of inquiry
sought, cites factual evidence why,
and suggests particular actions to be
taken by the board.
"We hope that by filing a legal peti
tion, we'll be encouraging the ad
ministration to look more closely at
Hoover," Cohen said. "For example,
if Hoover claims its organization is
separate from that of Stanford, then
why did the board of trustees meet
there yesterday?"
Cohen and Steyer said they see a
potentially large "conflict of inter
est" between Hoover's board of
overseers and the board of trustees.
Eight current and former trustees
serve on the Institution's board. "We
feel that members of the board who
have such conflict of interest should
not take part in any formal inquiry,"
they said.

a feud fueled by political bias, Cohen
said that he hopes the legal petition
will "raise the plane of debate from
that of pot-shots and ad hominem
attacks" to one of a "studied investi
gation."
"What I don't understand is, if
Hoover scholars are all convinced
that Hoover is not politically parti
san, they why are they resisting the
inquiry?" Cohen added.

Second-year law student and pres
ident of Women of Stanford Law,
Karen Zacharia said she supports the
legal petition and is in favor of the
idea of a formal inquiry. "All we're
really asking the board of trustees to
do is hold an inquiry," she said.
"Isn't one of the aspects of a liberal
education to question?"
Supporters of the petition empha
size that while the controversy thus
far has tended to degenerate into a
political debate, the most compel
ling issues are those of academic
independence. According to
Zacharia, the Hoover Institution's
visibility, particularly due to its tie to
the Reagan administration, could
"lead people to question the
academic integrity of the Univer
sity."
"Part of the what the University is
supposed to represent is a broad
spectrum of ideas without con
straint. . . .I don't mind having a
think tank associated with the Uni
versity, but I mind having a partisan
think tank," Zacharia said.
Council of Presidents member
elect Peter Spivack said, "the way I
look at it, Hoover is no more political
than the Political Science Depart
ment. . . .partisanship doesn't con
cern me and is very hard to prove."
Spivack said there are other ques
tions, however, which concern him
and seem worthy of inquiry. "What
about the non-financial support the

University provides?" Spivack said,
referring to the facilities and Univer
sity benefits the Institution enjoys.
"Does Stanford receive reciprocal
benefits that are tantamount to the
amount of support that Stanford
gives Hoover?"
In contrast, Spivack pointed out
that the Hoover Institution does pro
vide many benefits to the University
and said he doesn't see-the con
troversy as "an attack on Hoover,"
but as a studied inquiry to define
some of the relationships between
the University and the Institution."
Raga Elim, ASSU Senate chair, said,
"I am sympathetic to the complaints
of the professors—if they are con
cerned, I am concerned." Elim said
he believes a public inquiry would
"put the debate to rest."

As evidence of the growing
Hoover controversy, two new peti
tions came into existence this
week—one a conservative faculty re
sponse, and the other a formal re
statement of the initial student peti
tion signed by 1500 members of the
Stanford community.
The proposed probe into the rela
tionship between the University and
the Hoover Institution has led con
cerned faculty members to draw up
an alternative response to the ques
tions raised, according to Prof. Al
phonse Juilland, chairman of the
French and Italian departments. The
petition originated in an effort to
dispel the false impression that the
University faculty as a body is ques
tioning the Hoover Institution, Juil
land said.
"The matter has been presented as
a conflict between the Stanford fac
ulty and Hoover," Juilland said, "but
only 69 members of the faculty have
signed the original petition and there
are almost 1000 members of the

Academic Council."
JuiHand said he and other faculty
members are also concerned about
"the dangerous precedent" such an
investigation would represent "both
inside and outside the University."
"This presents a very grave threat to
academic freedom," he said. "We
are all convinced that no such inves
tigation would be contemplated if
Hoover's bias were liberal rather
than conservative."
"We see this as a liberal witch-hunt
of conservatives," said Jui Hand.
"This may spread from the tower to
the quad—there is no reason why
they couldn't investigate the political
bias of departments next."
"There are departments at Stan
ford whose political bias is more
marked than Hoover's," he said. "If
certain things are improper at
Hoover they can't be proper in Stan
ford departments can they?"
Furthermore, "Hoover isn't the
only think tank associated with a
University and an investigation at
Stanford could ignite similar investi
gations at other universities," Juil

land said.
luilland said that by circulating the
petition, he aims to inform his col
leagues in the Faculty Senate of the
opposing petition. Finally, he in
ends to release to the public the
names of those signing the petition,
he said.
The student petition, a 12-page
legal document requesting a "for
mal inquiry was filed with the Uni
versity's board of trustees yesterday.
Drawn up in support of the 1500
people who signed the previous
student-initiated petition, the legal
document asks that an independent
board examine the Hoover Institu
tion's impact on the University's
academic integrity, faculty indepen
dence and national reputation.
Fhe petition was prepared and
tiled on behalf of the ad hoc Stanford
Students for Academic Truth (SAT)
by Public Advocates, Inc., a public
interest law firm based in San Fran
cisco.
Dan Cohen and Jim Steyer, both
third-year law students, submitted
the lengthy document in order to

"formalize" their concerns, Steyer
said.
"All of us involved feel this is a very
serious issue and want it to be seen in
that light," Steyer said. The petition
clarifies the specific areas of inquiry
sought, cites factual evidence why,
and suggests particular actions to be
taken by the board.
"We hope that by filing a legal peti
tion, we'll be encouraging the ad
ministration to look more closely at
Hoover," Cohen said. "For example,
if Hoover claims its organization is
separate from that of Stanford, then
why did the board of trustees meet
there yesterday?"
Cohen and Steyer said they see a
potentially large "conflict of inter
est" between Hoover's board of
overseers and the board of trustees.
Eight current and former trustees
serve on the Institution's board. "We
feel that members of the board who
have such conflict of interest should
not take part in any formal inquiry,"
they said.

a feud fueled by political bias, Cohen
said that he hopes the legal petition
will "raise the plane of debate from
that of pot-shots and ad hominem
attacks" to one of a "studied investi
gation."
"What I don't understand is, if
Hoover scholars are all convinced
that Hoover is not politically parti
san, they why are they resisting the
inquiry?" Cohen added.

Second-year law student and pres
ident of Women of Stanford Law,
Karen Zacharia said she supports the
legal petition and is in favor of the
idea of a formal inquiry. "All we're
really asking the board of trustees to
do is hold an inquiry," she said.
"Isn't one of the aspects of a liberal
education to question?"
Supporters of the petition empha
size that while the controversy thus
far has tended to degenerate into a
political debate, the most compel
ling issues are those of academic
independence. According to
Zacharia, the Hoover Institution's
visibility, particularly due to its tie to
the Reagan administration, could
"lead people to question the
academic integrity of the Univer
sity."
"Part of the what the University is
supposed to represent is a broad
spectrum of ideas without con
straint. . . .I don't mind having a
think tank associated with the Uni
versity, but I mind having a partisan
think tank," Zacharia said.
Council of Presidents member
elect Peter Spivack said, "the way I
look at it, Hoover is no more political
than the Political Science Depart
ment. . . .partisanship doesn't con
cern me and is very hard to prove."
Spivack said there are other ques
tions, however, which concern him
and seem worthy of inquiry. "What
about the non-financial support the

University provides?" Spivack said,
referring to the facilities and Univer
sity benefits the Institution enjoys.
"Does Stanford receive reciprocal
benefits that are tantamount to the
amount of support that Stanford
gives Hoover?"
In contrast, Spivack pointed out
that the Hoover Institution does pro
vide many benefits to the University
and said he doesn't see-the con
troversy as "an attack on Hoover,"
but as a studied inquiry to define
