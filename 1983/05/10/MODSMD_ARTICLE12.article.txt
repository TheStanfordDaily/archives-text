# IBM plan provides computers for humanities depts
## 
### RANDY BROBERG Staff writer 
The Computer Science De
partment relies on computers
by definition. Engineering and
natural science departments
have become almost totally
and visibly dependent on
computers. Our eyes have be
come accustomed to seeing
computer terminals in the of
fices of the University adminis
tration and libraries, but only
in the last few months have we
seen the proliferation of com
puters within the departments
of humanities here.
Computers are rapidly
changing the way the Univer
sity works. Scarcely an ad
ministrator or librarian can be
found who does not have his
hands on the keyboard of a
computer terminal. But does a
computer belong in the office
of a philosophy or history pro
fessor? Has the last remaining
"bulwark against the forces of
technology" succumbed and
given in to reliance on silicon
chips?
According to current figures
provided by the office of
Humanities and Sciences, 151
of the 185 eligible professors in
14 humanities departments
have obtained IBM personal
computers through a project
designed to make computing
and word processing
capabilities available for re
search in the humanities.
Some departments such as
history and English boast al
most total participation in the

project. Representatives of
these departments claim that
prior exposure to computer
word-processing systems in
the possession of the depart
ment created a favorable, even
anxious, attitude among the
faculty.
To be eligible for the project,
called Tiro after the Roman in
ventor of shorthand, partici
pants have to be regular te
nured faculty members in strict
humanities disciplines. The
project is aimed at aiding the
research of such disciplines as
English, classics, and history
but not the social science dis
ciplines such as political sci
ence or psychology.
About a year ago the Univer
sity approached the Pew Foun
dation of Philadelphia and
asked for funds to further re
search in the humanities. The
Pew Foundation provided
$250,000 to fund the Tiro proj
ect. An initial study of seven
personal computers was fol
lowed by the actual testing of
the top three choices: the
Apple computer, the Tandy
Corporation TRS-80 and the
IBM personal computer. Fac
ulty members who compared
the systems last summer
showed a marked preference
for the IBM system, according
to the office of Humanities and
Sciences. The first training
courses and computer de
liveries became available in
january of this year.
Through the Tiro project, 14
humanities departments have

received a letter-quality printer
in addition to the personal
computer package. Faculty
members are able to obtain for
their use a personal computer,
disc drive, matrix-dot printer,
and complete word
processing software set. The
complete package costs the
University approximately $4500
at a 25 percent discount from
IBM.
The professors do not own
the computers though they are
asked to make a donation to
the Tiro project in return for
use of the computer as long as
they remain at Stanford. If the
faculty member should leave
Stanford for some reason, the
computer remains in the pos
session of the University. As
sistant professors are asked to
pay $300 for three years, as
sociate professors $350, and
full professors $400. After the
first three years the professors
are expected to pick up their
own service contract which
previously had been provided
by the project.
The Tiro project also in
cludes training for the faculty
members coordinated through
the Center for Information
Technology (CIT), in particular
from the Instruction and Re
search Information Systems
division (IRIS), according to a
memo provided by the center.
IRIS staff have trained the fac
ulty in the use of their comput
ers using "hands on" instruc
tion and consulting facilities.
The professors must complete

basic instruction in the use of
computers before their pack
ages can be delivered.
According to Barbara
Wawrzynski, departmental
administrator for the History
Department, it is very difficult
to measure any reduction in
the secretarial workload as a
result of the Tiro project.
Wawrzynski said, "Some of
(the faculty members with
computers) are using them a
lot, some not at all. I believe
the faculty will save most on
research time, which doesn't
affect departmental secretaries
that much." Another secretary
in the History Department,
Nancy Ristuben, said that the
departmental staff has more
time to do things for the stu
dents, but that the secretaries
are spending some time
"computer consulting."
The staff of the Classics and
English Departments agree.
Kay Hanner in the Classics De
partment said she did not be
lieve her workload has been
reduced. Patricia Bunge in the
English Department said the
computers have reduced the
departmental workload, but
not by much.
There did not seem to be any
generational difference in the
receptivity of the professors to
using computers. In the His
tory Department, for example,
31 out of 35 of the eligible pro
fessors have obtained their
computers and two of the re
maining four have applied,
another is on leave.

Although many of the pro
fessors keep their computers
at home, Asst. History Prof.
Stephen Ferrulo keeps his IBM
in his office. Ferrulo uses his
IBM mostly for writing books
and articles, but he also uses it
for correspondence and com
mittee work, "for which it is a
great help," he said. Ferrulo
especially appreciates the ease
of storage provided by the
magnetic discs. "I save every
thing. You never know which
you have to go back and re
vise," he added.
But Ferrulo pointed out that
the computers are no
"panacea." He argued, "they
in no way improve the quality
of a faculty member's work."
Computers, Ferrulo said,
"facilitate expression rather
than the creation of ideas."
Ferrulo also said he does not
think it is true that he can
spend more time on research.
"In the long run it reduces
time, but in the short run it
often increases it." He ex
plained this by saying, "I think
the faculty member is expected
to assume more of the work
and not leave it to the sec
retaries."
Another professor in the His
tory Department, Carl Degler,
would agree with Ferrulo

about the faculty workload.
"My workload has not been
reduced in any appreciable
way. Most of my time is spent
reading anyway," he said.
Degler said he sees certain
advantages in having a per
sonal computer but he is "not
convinced that it is superior to
an electric typewriter if you
have a secretary to help with
final drafts." He continued by
making it clear that he is keep
ing an open mind about
whether it is the way he will be
working.
Several humanities profes
sors, however, said they
doubted the nature of their re
search would change with the
use of computers. Asst. Prof.
John Winkler of the Classics
Department could not forsee
any changes in the nature of his
research, but he did believe
the greater ease allowed by
computers would increase the
quantity of research.
Prof lames Sheehan, chair
man of the History Department
said he was "skeptical" if the
nature of research would
change to become more statis
tical or quantitative. "We al
ready think of ourselves as
empirical," he said.
Susan Lansdale of the office
of Humanities and Sciences is

assisting in the coordination of
the Tiro project. She said that
there is a study going on to ex
plore the networking to the
computers, connecting them
to each other and to the library
system. Michael Carter, the di
rector of IRIS, said the plans
are to hook the humanities
computers up in a University
wide network when it becomes
operational. Networking
would allow the computers to
have access to any computer
on campus, not just the library
computers, Carter said.
The future networking of the
computers is exciting for
humanities professors. There
is a potential for a "dramatic
impact" on humanities re
search if the computers can go
"on-line" with the library sys
tem, Sheehan said.
Although there is no convic
tion that the computers will
change the nature of
humanities research or sub
stantially reduce the secretarial
load of the humanities de
partments, the very high level
of participation in the project is
cited by Sheehan as evidence
that shows "The faculty has ab
sorbed and learned to use
these computers with extraor
dinary speed. People have
been remarkably receptive."

But Ferrulo pointed out that
the computers are no
"panacea." He argued, "they
in no way improve the quality
of a faculty member's work."
Computers, Ferrulo said,
"facilitate expression rather

Ferrulo also said he does not
think it is true that he can
spend more time on research.
"In the long run it reduces
time, but in the short run it

Another professor in the His

about the faculty workload.
"My workload has not been

The Computer Science De
partment relies on computers
by definition. Engineering and
natural science departments
have become almost totally
and visibly dependent on
computers. Our eyes have be
come accustomed to seeing
computer terminals in the of
fices of the University adminis
tration and libraries, but only
in the last few months have we
seen the proliferation of com
puters within the departments
of humanities here.
Computers are rapidly
changing the way the Univer
sity works. Scarcely an ad
ministrator or librarian can be
found who does not have his
hands on the keyboard of a
computer terminal. But does a
computer belong in the office
of a philosophy or history pro
fessor? Has the last remaining
"bulwark against the forces of
technology" succumbed and
given in to reliance on silicon
chips?
According to current figures
provided by the office of
Humanities and Sciences, 151
of the 185 eligible professors in
14 humanities departments
have obtained IBM personal
computers through a project
designed to make computing
and word processing
capabilities available for re
search in the humanities.
Some departments such as
history and English boast al
most total participation in the

project. Representatives of
these departments claim that
prior exposure to computer
word-processing systems in
the possession of the depart
ment created a favorable, even
anxious, attitude among the
faculty.
To be eligible for the project,
called Tiro after the Roman in
ventor of shorthand, partici
pants have to be regular te
nured faculty members in strict
humanities disciplines. The
project is aimed at aiding the
research of such disciplines as
English, classics, and history
but not the social science dis
ciplines such as political sci
ence or psychology.
About a year ago the Univer
sity approached the Pew Foun
dation of Philadelphia and
asked for funds to further re
search in the humanities. The
Pew Foundation provided
$250,000 to fund the Tiro proj
ect. An initial study of seven
personal computers was fol
lowed by the actual testing of
the top three choices: the
Apple computer, the Tandy
Corporation TRS-80 and the
IBM personal computer. Fac
ulty members who compared
the systems last summer
showed a marked preference
for the IBM system, according
to the office of Humanities and
Sciences. The first training
courses and computer de
liveries became available in
january of this year.
Through the Tiro project, 14
humanities departments have

received a letter-quality printer
in addition to the personal
computer package. Faculty
members are able to obtain for
their use a personal computer,
disc drive, matrix-dot printer,
and complete word
processing software set. The
complete package costs the
University approximately $4500
at a 25 percent discount from
IBM.
The professors do not own
the computers though they are
asked to make a donation to
the Tiro project in return for
use of the computer as long as
they remain at Stanford. If the
faculty member should leave
Stanford for some reason, the
computer remains in the pos
session of the University. As
sistant professors are asked to
pay $300 for three years, as
sociate professors $350, and
full professors $400. After the
first three years the professors
are expected to pick up their
own service contract which
previously had been provided
by the project.
The Tiro project also in
cludes training for the faculty
members coordinated through
the Center for Information
Technology (CIT), in particular
from the Instruction and Re
search Information Systems
division (IRIS), according to a
memo provided by the center.
IRIS staff have trained the fac
ulty in the use of their comput
ers using "hands on" instruc
tion and consulting facilities.
The professors must complete

basic instruction in the use of
computers before their pack
ages can be delivered.
According to Barbara
Wawrzynski, departmental
administrator for the History
Department, it is very difficult
to measure any reduction in
the secretarial workload as a
result of the Tiro project.
Wawrzynski said, "Some of
(the faculty members with
computers) are using them a
lot, some not at all. I believe
the faculty will save most on
research time, which doesn't
affect departmental secretaries
that much." Another secretary
in the History Department,
Nancy Ristuben, said that the
departmental staff has more
time to do things for the stu
dents, but that the secretaries
are spending some time
"computer consulting."
The staff of the Classics and
English Departments agree.
Kay Hanner in the Classics De
partment said she did not be
lieve her workload has been
reduced. Patricia Bunge in the
English Department said the
computers have reduced the
departmental workload, but
not by much.
There did not seem to be any
generational difference in the
receptivity of the professors to
using computers. In the His
tory Department, for example,
31 out of 35 of the eligible pro
fessors have obtained their
computers and two of the re
maining four have applied,
another is on leave.

Although many of the pro
fessors keep their computers
at home, Asst. History Prof.
Stephen Ferrulo keeps his IBM
in his office. Ferrulo uses his
IBM mostly for writing books
and articles, but he also uses it
for correspondence and com
mittee work, "for which it is a
great help," he said. Ferrulo
especially appreciates the ease
of storage provided by the
magnetic discs. "I save every
thing. You never know which
you have to go back and re
vise," he added.
But Ferrulo pointed out that
the computers are no
"panacea." He argued, "they
in no way improve the quality
of a faculty member's work."
Computers, Ferrulo said,
"facilitate expression rather
than the creation of ideas."

University approximately $4500
at a 25 percent discount from
IBM.
The professors do not own
the computers though they are
asked to make a donation to
the Tiro project in return for
use of the computer as long as
they remain at Stanford. If the
faculty member should leave
Stanford for some reason, the
computer remains in the pos
session of the University. As
sistant professors are asked to
pay $300 for three years, as
sociate professors $350, and
full professors $400. After the
first three years the professors
are expected to pick up their
own service contract which
previously had been provided
by the project.
The Tiro project also in
cludes training for the faculty
members coordinated through
the Center for Information
Technology (CIT), in particular
from the Instruction and Re
search Information Systems
division (IRIS), according to a
memo provided by the center.
IRIS staff have trained the fac
ulty in the use of their comput
ers using "hands on" instruc
tion and consulting facilities.
The professors must complete

basic instruction in the use of
computers before their pack
ages can be delivered.
According to Barbara
Wawrzynski, departmental
administrator for the History
Department, it is very difficult
to measure any reduction in
the secretarial workload as a
result of the Tiro project.
Wawrzynski said, "Some of
(the faculty members with
computers) are using them a
lot, some not at all. I believe
the faculty will save most on
research time, which doesn't
affect departmental secretaries
that much." Another secretary
in the History Department,
Nancy Ristuben, said that the
departmental staff has more
time to do things for the stu
dents, but that the secretaries
are spending some time
"computer consulting."
The staff of the Classics and
English Departments agree.
Kay Hanner in the Classics De
partment said she did not be
lieve her workload has been
reduced. Patricia Bunge in the
English Department said the
computers have reduced the
departmental workload, but
not by much.
There did not seem to be any
generational difference in the
receptivity of the professors to
using computers. In the His
tory Department, for example,
31 out of 35 of the eligible pro
fessors have obtained their
computers and two of the re
maining four have applied,
another is on leave.

Although many of the pro
fessors keep their computers
at home, Asst. History Prof.
Stephen Ferrulo keeps his IBM
in his office. Ferrulo uses his
IBM mostly for writing books
and articles, but he also uses it
for correspondence and com
mittee work, "for which it is a
great help," he said. Ferrulo
especially appreciates the ease
of storage provided by the
magnetic discs. "I save every
thing. You never know which
you have to go back and re
vise," he added.
But Ferrulo pointed out that
the computers are no
"panacea." He argued, "they
in no way improve the quality
of a faculty member's work."
Computers, Ferrulo said,
"facilitate expression rather
than the creation of ideas."
Ferrulo also said he does not
think it is true that he can
spend more time on research.
"In the long run it reduces
time, but in the short run it
often increases it." He ex
plained this by saying, "I think
the faculty member is expected
to assume more of the work
and not leave it to the sec
retaries."
Another professor in the His
tory Department, Carl Degler,
would agree with Ferrulo

about the faculty workload.
"My workload has not been
reduced in any appreciable
way. Most of my time is spent
reading anyway," he said.
Degler said he sees certain
advantages in having a per
sonal computer but he is "not
convinced that it is superior to
an electric typewriter if you
have a secretary to help with
final drafts." He continued by
making it clear that he is keep
ing an open mind about
whether it is the way he will be
working.
Several humanities profes
sors, however, said they
doubted the nature of their re
search would change with the
use of computers. Asst. Prof.
John Winkler of the Classics
Department could not forsee
any changes in the nature of his
research, but he did believe
the greater ease allowed by
computers would increase the
quantity of research.
Prof lames Sheehan, chair
man of the History Department
said he was "skeptical" if the
nature of research would
change to become more statis
tical or quantitative. "We al
ready think of ourselves as
empirical," he said.
Susan Lansdale of the office
of Humanities and Sciences is

assisting in the coordination of
the Tiro project. She said that
there is a study going on to ex
plore the networking to the
computers, connecting them
to each other and to the library
system. Michael Carter, the di
rector of IRIS, said the plans
are to hook the humanities
computers up in a University
wide network when it becomes
operational. Networking
would allow the computers to
have access to any computer
on campus, not just the library
computers, Carter said.
The future networking of the
computers is exciting for
humanities professors. There
is a potential for a "dramatic
impact" on humanities re
search if the computers can go
"on-line" with the library sys
tem, Sheehan said.
Although there is no convic
tion that the computers will
change the nature of
humanities research or sub
stantially reduce the secretarial
load of the humanities de
partments, the very high level
of participation in the project is
cited by Sheehan as evidence
that shows "The faculty has ab
sorbed and learned to use
these computers with extraor
dinary speed. People have
been remarkably receptive."
