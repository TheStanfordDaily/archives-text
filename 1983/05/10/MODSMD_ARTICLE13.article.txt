## The 						Stanford Daily DoE too restrictive 
### 
The Department of Energy last month pro
posed overly restrictive regulations governing
Jfie dissemination of information on nuclear re
search. These rules could harm the University's
place as a leading research institution. How
ever, Stanford has indicated its opposition to
these rules and intends to take its fight to
Washington—and to Capitol Hill if necessary—
to prevent their implementation.
We agree with the University's position on
these proposed rules; they are so restrictive
that they threaten Stanford's rule forbidding
classified research here and they are so cumber
some that, according to Vice Provost Gerald
Lieberman, the University might have to review
its entire library collection for information that
is affected and controlled by the proposed regu
lations.
The Department of Energy designed the rules
to give its secretary the ability to control the
dissemination of unclassified controlled nu
clear information (i.e., information on nuclear
research which is currently unclassified and
available to researchers on a need-to-know
basis). For the University this would represent a
serious obstacle to research because re
searchers and scholars here are not allowed to
conduct research, the results of which may not
be freely and publicly announced. The pro
posed rules allow the Secretary of Energy, if he
so wished, to prohibit the teaching of the results
of certain types of research after it had been
completed.
The rules could most seriously affect basic

research like that which is done at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center and the Stanford Syn
chroton Radiation Laboratory because of the
energy secretary's ability to limit access to re
search results after the research had been com
pleted; because researchers cannot always
know the specific end result of their research
they would be unable to undertake research
with the certainty that they could publish their
results, and this contravenes University re
search policy.
Because of these problems we recommend
that the Energy Department rewrite the rules in
a less odious fashion. The DoE should
minimize, instead of maximize, the power of its
secretary in making decisions on UNCI, as was
the intent of the Congress when it formulated
the guidelines on nuclear research in the
Atomic Energy Act of 1952.
The Energy Department should also clarify
what type of research will and will not be clas
sified. The ambiguity of the proposed rules will
lead to researchers' refusing research, at least at
Stanford, because of their uncertainty as to
whether the research will be classified or not.
We would prefer the minimal restrictions on
research, of course, but we urge at least some
clarification of the proposed research guide
lines.
Stanford has earned its world-renowned
reputation partly through the quality of re
search done here; the proposed rules would
seriously hinder the University's role as a center
for high quality research.
