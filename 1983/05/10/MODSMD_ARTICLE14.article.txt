# Breaking the wrong laws
## 
### 
When I read Timothy Taylor's col
umn on "Mellow terrorism" (Daily,
April 25), I was struck by what
seemed to me one of the most
thoughtful and incisive reflections
on the limits of protest in a free soci
ety that I've read anywhere in quite a
while. It was all the more disconcert
ing to me, therefore, to read Prof.
Wilfred Stone's inept attack on
Taylor's column (Daily, May 3). Aside
from Stone's ad hominem approach
(he smugly labels Taylor a "white,
middle-class Stanford graduate stu
dent"), it seems to me he missed the
boat entirely on what Taylor was talk
ing about.
I think I understand the distinction
expressed in "Mellow terrorism":
it's the distinction between consci
entious law-breaking and purely
attention-getting law-breaking. In
my view "civil disobedience," prop
erly thought of, means disobeying a
particular law because one feels that
particular law is unjust, not breaking
any old law just to get publicity and
make a point about some separate
issue. I think Stone's own "concrete
examples" illustrate this point most
effectively. When, as he recounts,
blacks in the South during the 1960s
sat in "whites only" bus seats or
drank from "whites only" drinking
fountains, they committed these
"lawless" acts because they sincerely
believed the law they were
breaking—the law of segregation—
was inhumane, unjust and uncon
stitutional. Theirs was indeed an act
of true civil disobedience, motivated
by the demands of conscience.
When Gandhi burned his racial iden
tification card in South Africa and
was brutally beaten by a white

policeman as a result, he was moti
vated by a conscientious abhorrence
of that particular law; he wasn't try
ing to get publicity to advance his
views on some "third issue."
As Martin Luther King knew, the
purpose of civil disobedience, and
what makes it a moral act, is that it
forces the community to realize how
unjust it is being in enforcing a par
ticular law. While blacks humbly
obeyed the Jim Crow laws, most
Southern whites could delude them
selves that no injustice was being
done. King realized that his task was
to break the laws en masse, to rub
the white majority's nose in the injus
tice they were supporting, to make
them realize that if they really wanted
segregation they were going to have
to firehose young children and im
prison elderly women. The purpose,
at which King was masterfully suc
cessful, was to make the majority
realize its injustices and voluntarily
change it, which of course eventually
occurred, at least as to the letter of
the law.
Quite contrary to the tradition of
Gandhi and King, the MX missile pro
testers at Vandenberg Air Force Base
(whom Taylor criticized in his col
umn) were not engaging in civil dis
obedience. The law they broke was
oneprohibitingtrespassingon a mili
tary base and blocking all ingress and
egress from the base. These are
clearly not "unjust laws"; they're
perfectly reasonable regulations.
Most important, though, the Van
denberg protesters never claimed
that these laws were unjust; indeed
their protest had nothing at all to do
with the specific laws they were
breaking.

The Vandenberg protesters were
simply breaking laws to get atten
tion, so they could publicize what
they were really mad about; Presi
dent Reagan's support for Congres
sional funding of the MX missile.
If the protesters were demand
ing a moral right of Americans to
trample over the country's military
bases and block all access to them, I
would not have much sympathy for
their position, but I would be forced
to admit that they were indeed prac
ticing "civil disobedience." By
openly admitting, however, that they
were only breaking the law to make a
point about a separate (albeit very
important) political issue, they relin
quished the right to call their actions
"civil disobedience." They were in
deed, as Taylor maintained, perform
ing "illegal direct action." If they
wished to protest MX funding di
rectly by civil disobedience they
should have refused to pay taxes like
Thoreau. But of course that wouldn't
have generated that much publicity.
It is offensive to the memory of
genuine practitioners of civil dis
obedience such as Gandhi and King,
to compare them with the hecklers at
Vandenberg. Taylor's column, in
pointing out the subtle and very im
portant differences between the two
types of protest, made a much
needed distinction between the con
scientious protest and mere
publicity-hungry flouting of the law.
Professor Stone's demagogic accu
sations do a disservice to Taylor's
thoughtful article and to the proper
understanding of civil disobedience.

at which King was masterfully suc

occurred, at least as to the letter of
the law.
Quite contrary to the tradition of
Gandhi and King, the MX missile pro

clearly not "unjust laws"; they're
perfectly reasonable regulations.
Most important, though, the Van
denberg protesters never claimed
that these laws were unjust; indeed
their protest had nothing at all to do
with the specific laws they were
breaking.

The Vandenberg protesters were
simply breaking laws to get atten

they were really mad about; Presi

If the protesters were demand
ing a moral right of Americans to
trample over the country's military

would not have much sympathy for
their position, but I would be forced
to admit that they were indeed prac

openly admitting, however, that they
were only breaking the law to make a
point about a separate (albeit very
important) political issue, they relin
quished the right to call their actions
"civil disobedience." They were in

ing "illegal direct action." If they
wished to protest MX funding di
rectly by civil disobedience they
should have refused to pay taxes like
Thoreau. But of course that wouldn't
have generated that much publicity.
It is offensive to the memory of
genuine practitioners of civil dis
obedience such as Gandhi and King,
to compare them with the hecklers at
Vandenberg. Taylor's column, in
pointing out the subtle and very im
portant differences between the two
types of protest, made a much
needed distinction between the con
scientious protest and mere
publicity-hungry flouting of the law.
Professor Stone's demagogic accu

thoughtful article and to the proper
understanding of civil disobedience.

A skeptical eye
When I read Timothy Taylor's col
umn on "Mellow terrorism" (Daily,
April 25), I was struck by what
seemed to me one of the most
thoughtful and incisive reflections
on the limits of protest in a free soci
ety that I've read anywhere in quite a
while. It was all the more disconcert
ing to me, therefore, to read Prof.
Wilfred Stone's inept attack on
Taylor's column (Daily, May 3). Aside
from Stone's ad hominem approach
(he smugly labels Taylor a "white,
middle-class Stanford graduate stu
dent"), it seems to me he missed the
boat entirely on what Taylor was talk
ing about.
I think I understand the distinction
expressed in "Mellow terrorism":
it's the distinction between consci
entious law-breaking and purely
attention-getting law-breaking. In
my view "civil disobedience," prop
erly thought of, means disobeying a
particular law because one feels that
particular law is unjust, not breaking
any old law just to get publicity and
make a point about some separate
issue. I think Stone's own "concrete
examples" illustrate this point most
effectively. When, as he recounts,
blacks in the South during the 1960s
sat in "whites only" bus seats or
drank from "whites only" drinking
fountains, they committed these
"lawless" acts because they sincerely
believed the law they were
breaking—the law of segregation—
was inhumane, unjust and uncon
stitutional. Theirs was indeed an act
of true civil disobedience, motivated
by the demands of conscience.
When Gandhi burned his racial iden
tification card in South Africa and
was brutally beaten by a white

policeman as a result, he was moti
vated by a conscientious abhorrence
of that particular law; he wasn't try
ing to get publicity to advance his
views on some "third issue."
As Martin Luther King knew, the
purpose of civil disobedience, and
what makes it a moral act, is that it
forces the community to realize how
unjust it is being in enforcing a par
ticular law. While blacks humbly
obeyed the Jim Crow laws, most
Southern whites could delude them
selves that no injustice was being
done. King realized that his task was
to break the laws en masse, to rub
the white majority's nose in the injus
tice they were supporting, to make
them realize that if they really wanted
segregation they were going to have
to firehose young children and im
prison elderly women. The purpose,
at which King was masterfully suc
cessful, was to make the majority
realize its injustices and voluntarily
change it, which of course eventually
occurred, at least as to the letter of
the law.
