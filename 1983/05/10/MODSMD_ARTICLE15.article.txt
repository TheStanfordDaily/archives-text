## MX missile is both unnecessary and dangerous 
### 
The course of U.S. nuclear arms
policy for the coming years will be
shaped in the next few weeks as
Congress considers funding for the
MX missile for 1983 and 1984. We
urge you to join us in say "no" to the
MX, to write your congressperson
and tell of the dangers of this
weapon. Here are some of the rea
sons why we oppose the MX:
Ronald Reagan made the so-called
"window of vulnerability" one of the
cornerstones of his 1980 presidential
campaign. He claimed that within a
decade, U.S. strategic forces would
be open to attack by increasingly ac
curate Soviet ICBMs. The MX missile
was supposed to solve this problem.
However, no workable deployment
scheme could be found which was
not susceptible to simple, inexpen
sive Soviet countermeasures. After
the latest such proposal ("dense
pack") was defeated in Congress last
December, President Reagan ap
pointed a commission to find an ac
ceptable deployment mode for the
MX.
Instead the commission reported
that the window of vulnerability
never really existed. The fact that a
Soviet first strike could not be
counted on to destroy all our land
bases missiles, and would leave two
thirds of our retaliatory force intact
on bombers and submarines as well,

was judged sufficient to deter nu
clear war.
Why then do we need the MX? The
commission could not find a way to
make it invulnerable; indeed, the
fact that the missile carries more
warheads than the missiles in our
current arsenal makes it a prime
target for Soviet planners. Rather, we
are supposed to buy the $15 billion
system for reasons entirely unrelated
to security considerations: we need
to demonstrate "national will" and
generate "bargaining chips."
By building the MX, the adminis
tration hopes to bargain with the
Soviets from a "position of
strength." Historically, the Soviets
have responded to such challenges
with new deployments, not new
treaties.
The MX is not necessary—its ex
treme accuracy makes it dangerous.
The MX matches the perceived
Soviet ability to destroy missile silos.
But do we really need to threaten the
other side's deterrent? This only
makes them uneasy about leaving
their missiles on the ground in times
of crisis. Thus the MX does not make
us safer; it only increases the pace
and instability of the arms race. In
stead of deterring nuclear war, the
MX makes it more likely. We now
have the opportunity to turn away
from this dangerous route by saying

"no" to funding the MX.

ASSU Senate
It's time someone gave the ASSU
Senate a good spanking. Do they
ever do anything besides draft reso
lutions concerning issues irrelevant
to their call of duty, which is to repre
sent student concerns? I'm sure not
being represented when the Senate
condemns weapons research at SSRI
because of a petition that was signed
by less than 13 percent of the student
body or when a couple of paranoid
members of the Jewish community
railroad an "official" statement of
dissassociation from Mr. McCloskey
because of some "anti-Semitic" re
marks he made. How I wish students
were given a chance to vote on a fee
assessment supporting the ASSU
Senate, so that we could really tell
those pseudo-politicos what we

think about them!

I am confused about your recent
article on work study employment
("On-campus jobs favor work-study
students" (Daily, April 27). Specif
ically, one section relates the sad tale
of Dave Holmes. It seems that poor
Dave, like many of us, must work to
help pay for his education. Dave,
however, has a "special deal"
worked out with the Athletic De
partment. Twoquartersperyearheis
a hasher for Lagunita Food Service,
and the third he wrestles for "com
parable pay."
How long has Stanford supported
a professional wrestling team? Did
|ohn Elway have the same type of
deal to cover his living expenses (and
keep him from the clutches of the
NFL or USFL)? Where do I sign up for
this amazing (and no doubt, gener
ous) program? I may not be the best
sportsman, but I feel confident that I
could improve my game with a little
practice, especially with a financial
incentive. Would I get a bonus for
making it to the North American Co
Fish Finals?

The course of U.S. nuclear arms
policy for the coming years will be
shaped in the next few weeks as
Congress considers funding for the
MX missile for 1983 and 1984. We
urge you to join us in say "no" to the
MX, to write your congressperson
and tell of the dangers of this
weapon. Here are some of the rea
sons why we oppose the MX:
Ronald Reagan made the so-called
"window of vulnerability" one of the
cornerstones of his 1980 presidential
campaign. He claimed that within a
decade, U.S. strategic forces would
be open to attack by increasingly ac
curate Soviet ICBMs. The MX missile
was supposed to solve this problem.
However, no workable deployment
scheme could be found which was
not susceptible to simple, inexpen
sive Soviet countermeasures. After
the latest such proposal ("dense
pack") was defeated in Congress last
December, President Reagan ap
pointed a commission to find an ac
ceptable deployment mode for the
MX.
Instead the commission reported
that the window of vulnerability
never really existed. The fact that a
Soviet first strike could not be
counted on to destroy all our land
bases missiles, and would leave two
thirds of our retaliatory force intact
on bombers and submarines as well,

was judged sufficient to deter nu
clear war.
Why then do we need the MX? The
commission could not find a way to
make it invulnerable; indeed, the
fact that the missile carries more
warheads than the missiles in our
current arsenal makes it a prime
target for Soviet planners. Rather, we
are supposed to buy the $15 billion
system for reasons entirely unrelated
to security considerations: we need
to demonstrate "national will" and
generate "bargaining chips."
By building the MX, the adminis
tration hopes to bargain with the
Soviets from a "position of
strength." Historically, the Soviets
have responded to such challenges
with new deployments, not new
treaties.
The MX is not necessary—its ex
treme accuracy makes it dangerous.
The MX matches the perceived
Soviet ability to destroy missile silos.
But do we really need to threaten the
other side's deterrent? This only
makes them uneasy about leaving
their missiles on the ground in times
of crisis. Thus the MX does not make
us safer; it only increases the pace
and instability of the arms race. In
stead of deterring nuclear war, the
MX makes it more likely. We now
have the opportunity to turn away
from this dangerous route by saying

"no" to funding the MX.

ASSU Senate
It's time someone gave the ASSU
Senate a good spanking. Do they
ever do anything besides draft reso
lutions concerning issues irrelevant
to their call of duty, which is to repre
sent student concerns? I'm sure not
being represented when the Senate
condemns weapons research at SSRI
because of a petition that was signed
by less than 13 percent of the student
body or when a couple of paranoid
members of the Jewish community
railroad an "official" statement of
dissassociation from Mr. McCloskey
because of some "anti-Semitic" re
marks he made. How I wish students
were given a chance to vote on a fee
assessment supporting the ASSU
Senate, so that we could really tell
those pseudo-politicos what we

think about them!
