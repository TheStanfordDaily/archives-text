## Questions to ask Hoover 
### 
So far the tone of much of the Hoover Institution's
response to the faculty-student petition has been set by
Director W. Glenn Campbell when he leveled the term
"character assassination charges" (Peninsula Times
Tribune, April 24) at those who raised questions about
partisan political activities by the Hoover Institution.
Normally we would ignore such rare displays of invec
tive in a university community, but on at least one issue
Hoover has a good point. The burden of proof is prop
erly put on the initiator. That is why we have compiled
and made available to the Faculty Senate a five-page
compendium of materials on Hoover's alleged political
activities. That is why we have also called the public's
attention to Hoover's Annual Reports as an authoritative
source on Hoover's activities. We believe readers of
these documents will see that the issues raised in this
debate cannot be reduced to "guilt by association" and a
liberal "witch hunt."
No one expected Hoover to like the petition but in
an academic community, when questions are raised for
discussion, shouldn't some effort be made to discuss
them as really presented? As we see it, the major con
cerns of those who have called for an inquiry include the
following:
1. Does the Hoover Institution receive millions of dol
lars from private sources outside the University, and
from private funds earmarked for Hoover but adminis
tered by the University, and, if so, whogivesthis money,
why do they give it and who decides how it is used?
2. If only about one-third of Hoover's budget ($2.7
million) goes to the Hoover Library, what sort of ac
tivities are funded by the remaining two-thirds ($5.7
million)? And would those who supply this money con
tinue to do so if Hoover were in fact nonpartisan?
3. Does the Hoover Institution, as suggested in its own
1981 and 1982 Annual Reports, engage in political and
partisan activities of concern to the broader Stanford
community?
4. Was the New York Times Magazine correct in July
1978 when, in an article by Kenneth Lamott, it was re
ported that: "Through its ties with the right wing of the
Republican Party, the Hoover Institution is exerting in
creasing political influence. It is the brightest star in a
small constellation of conservative think tanks that serve
as workshops where out of office intellectuals can fabri
cate the underpinnings of domestic and foreign-policy
positions for the Republicans."
5. Without denying the need of any political party for
research and support, do we, as a community, want such
activities (to the extent that they are shown to exist)
centered at Stanford?
6. To the extent that Hoover, as an organization, en
gages in partisan political activities, does not Hoover,
directly or indirectly, ensnare the University in such
activities?
7. And finally, to the extent that such activities are
found, by objective investigation, to exist, are they
compatible with Stanford's national reputation as a cen
ter of independent, nonpartisan, objective research?
Such legitimate questions are not an example of
McCarthyism. They pose serious issues for this Univer
sity. That is why many have asked for apublicinquiryina
responsible and appropriate forum. These are controv
ersial questions but let us not be deceived by the
rhetoric: none of the real issues in this debate centers
on the politics or activities of any individual member of

the Hoover Institution or the Stanford faculty.
We do not believe that such questions can be an
swered by claiming that Hoover is just another part of
Stanford and should not be singled out for special atten
tion. Hoover is not like a regular department, and most
members of Hoover's research staff are not recruited in
the same way as Stanford faculty. Individual faculty
members and members of Hoover obviously have full
rights to engage in whatever political activities they
please — as individuals.
But what about an Institution that receives and dis
penses millions of dollars? Just because that Institution
does not take formal positions on issues, does this make
it nonpolitical? Perhaps. But we doubt it.
Experienced Stanford faculty members and a great
deal of the media discern in Hoover a large and domi
nant core which sets the tone and tends to pursue over
whelmingly a fairly consistent political line. Is Hoover no
more than a collection of diverse individuals who hap
pen to congregate in one place? Are we to believe that
because Hoover contains some Democrats — perhaps
even some liberal Democrats — that it is a pluralist
institution without any discernible political leaning?
Some people say Hoover is a valuable asset to the
University. We agree. As a library and archive Hoover
must and should be retained.
But what about the political side of Hoover? Is it not
true that most of Hoover's budget supports research and
publications rather than archival activities? Is it not true
that to many observers Hoover's research and publica
tions appear political? And is it not true that many of
Hoover's activities appear partisan? Are these aspects of
Hoover assets to Stanford University? We wonder. Many
others wonder.
Are we to believe that Hoover, with its millions of
dollars from outside sources, and its overt political con
nections, is nothing more than a tall archive? Hoover
seems to claim and the press certainly reports that it is
one of the leading conservative think tanks in the coun
try. Do we want to be associated with such an organiza
tion? Does any other university accept such large funds
and allow one of its parts to pursue such goals as
Hoover? Should any university allow such activities?
These are the sort of questions that many faculty and
students think should be discussed: in the faculty sen
ate, among the student body, the President's Office, the
board of trustees and perhaps even by an objective
board of scholars from outside the University. These
substantive issues are too important to Stanford to get
bogged down in an endless debate over who at Hoover
is a Democrat or a Republican, or how many members of
Hoover are affiliated with radical left or radical right
journals. Such a focus trivializes important questions
and diverts attention to secondary issues.
These are questions that, in an academic community
dedicated to reasoned discourse, should be considered
dispassionately. We all know this is difficult. But a focus
sed inquiry into the facts should help us sort out fact
from rhetoric. Stanford now needs such an inquiry, and
we believe that it is up to those most directly concerned
with preserving the well-being and integrity of the Uni
versity to provide it.

activities. That is why we have also called the public's
attention to Hoover's Annual Reports as an authoritative
source on Hoover's activities. We believe readers of
these documents will see that the issues raised in this
debate cannot be reduced to "guilt by association" and a
liberal "witch hunt."
No one expected Hoover to like the petition but in
an academic community, when questions are raised for
discussion, shouldn't some effort be made to discuss
them as really presented? As we see it, the major con
cerns of those who have called for an inquiry include the
following:
1. Does the Hoover Institution receive millions of dol
lars from private sources outside the University, and
from private funds earmarked for Hoover but adminis
tered by the University, and, if so, whogivesthis money,
why do they give it and who decides how it is used?
2. If only about one-third of Hoover's budget ($2.7
million) goes to the Hoover Library, what sort of ac
tivities are funded by the remaining two-thirds ($5.7
million)? And would those who supply this money con
tinue to do so if Hoover were in fact nonpartisan?
3. Does the Hoover Institution, as suggested in its own
1981 and 1982 Annual Reports, engage in political and
partisan activities of concern to the broader Stanford
community?
4. Was the New York Times Magazine correct in July
1978 when, in an article by Kenneth Lamott, it was re
ported that: "Through its ties with the right wing of the
Republican Party, the Hoover Institution is exerting in
creasing political influence. It is the brightest star in a
small constellation of conservative think tanks that serve
as workshops where out of office intellectuals can fabri
cate the underpinnings of domestic and foreign-policy
positions for the Republicans."
5. Without denying the need of any political party for
research and support, do we, as a community, want such
activities (to the extent that they are shown to exist)
centered at Stanford?
6. To the extent that Hoover, as an organization, en
gages in partisan political activities, does not Hoover,
directly or indirectly, ensnare the University in such
activities?
7. And finally, to the extent that such activities are
found, by objective investigation, to exist, are they
compatible with Stanford's national reputation as a cen
ter of independent, nonpartisan, objective research?
Such legitimate questions are not an example of
McCarthyism. They pose serious issues for this Univer
sity. That is why many have asked for apublicinquiryina
responsible and appropriate forum. These are controv
ersial questions but let us not be deceived by the
rhetoric: none of the real issues in this debate centers
on the politics or activities of any individual member of

the Hoover Institution or the Stanford faculty.
We do not believe that such questions can be an
swered by claiming that Hoover is just another part of
Stanford and should not be singled out for special atten
tion. Hoover is not like a regular department, and most
members of Hoover's research staff are not recruited in
the same way as Stanford faculty. Individual faculty
members and members of Hoover obviously have full
rights to engage in whatever political activities they
please — as individuals.
But what about an Institution that receives and dis
penses millions of dollars? Just because that Institution
does not take formal positions on issues, does this make
it nonpolitical? Perhaps. But we doubt it.
Experienced Stanford faculty members and a great
deal of the media discern in Hoover a large and domi
nant core which sets the tone and tends to pursue over
whelmingly a fairly consistent political line. Is Hoover no
more than a collection of diverse individuals who hap
pen to congregate in one place? Are we to believe that
because Hoover contains some Democrats — perhaps
even some liberal Democrats — that it is a pluralist
institution without any discernible political leaning?
Some people say Hoover is a valuable asset to the
University. We agree. As a library and archive Hoover
must and should be retained.
But what about the political side of Hoover? Is it not
true that most of Hoover's budget supports research and
publications rather than archival activities? Is it not true
that to many observers Hoover's research and publica
tions appear political? And is it not true that many of
Hoover's activities appear partisan? Are these aspects of
Hoover assets to Stanford University? We wonder. Many
others wonder.
Are we to believe that Hoover, with its millions of
dollars from outside sources, and its overt political con
nections, is nothing more than a tall archive? Hoover
seems to claim and the press certainly reports that it is
one of the leading conservative think tanks in the coun
try. Do we want to be associated with such an organiza
tion? Does any other university accept such large funds
and allow one of its parts to pursue such goals as
Hoover? Should any university allow such activities?
These are the sort of questions that many faculty and
students think should be discussed: in the faculty sen
ate, among the student body, the President's Office, the
board of trustees and perhaps even by an objective
board of scholars from outside the University. These
substantive issues are too important to Stanford to get
bogged down in an endless debate over who at Hoover
is a Democrat or a Republican, or how many members of
Hoover are affiliated with radical left or radical right
journals. Such a focus trivializes important questions
and diverts attention to secondary issues.
These are questions that, in an academic community
dedicated to reasoned discourse, should be considered
dispassionately. We all know this is difficult. But a focus
sed inquiry into the facts should help us sort out fact
from rhetoric. Stanford now needs such an inquiry, and
we believe that it is up to those most directly concerned
with preserving the well-being and integrity of the Uni
versity to provide it.

So far the tone of much of the Hoover Institution's
response to the faculty-student petition has been set by
Director W. Glenn Campbell when he leveled the term
"character assassination charges" (Peninsula Times
Tribune, April 24) at those who raised questions about
partisan political activities by the Hoover Institution.
Normally we would ignore such rare displays of invec
tive in a university community, but on at least one issue
Hoover has a good point. The burden of proof is prop
erly put on the initiator. That is why we have compiled
and made available to the Faculty Senate a five-page
compendium of materials on Hoover's alleged political
activities. That is why we have also called the public's
attention to Hoover's Annual Reports as an authoritative
source on Hoover's activities. We believe readers of
