# Physicist Sydney Drell: an advocate of arms control
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Colleagues describe him as a
"sweetheart" and a "prince."
He is a renowned theoretical
physicist, a knowledgeable
arms control expert and an ac
complished violin player.
Sidney Drell, the deputy di
rector of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center has many
interests outside his labora
tory, and he said he feels a duty
to share his knowledge with
others.
"I'm not just a scientist, I'm a
human being," he said.
Drell, 56, has served as a
consultant to the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament
Agency, the National Security
Council, the President's Sci
ence Advisory Committee and
numerous other federal agen
cies.
He received the Leo Szilard
Award for Physics in the Public
Interest for his "outstanding
contribution to the formula
tion of national policy."
Yet Drell still has time to
teach an undergraduate arms
control course in the Political
Science Department and to
work with graduate students at
SLAC. In addition, he conducts

research in particle physics.
"That's really what I enjoy
doing," he said. "I consider it
the greatest adventure story of
the human mind — to try to
understand what we're made
of."
Drell has conducted studies
of quantum field theory and
elementary particle physics.
But he is probably best known
on campus forhis work in arms
control.
Drell said he serves as a de
fense and intelligence consul
tant because he feels an obliga
tion to explain the "technical
component" of political deci
sions to society's leaders.
"Because of our system of
government, one has oppor
tunities that one doesn't have
in other societies," he said.
"Opportunities and obliga
tions usually go together."
This feeling of obligation has
led him to testify at numerous
congressional hearings.
"If I have something to say,
and an opportunity to say it,
and I can fit it in with my job
here at Stanford," he said,
"then I will say it."
Drell first became involved
in national security work in
1960. He ended his affiliation

with the Arms Control and Dis
armament Agency and the Na
tional Security Council when
the Reagan administration
took over in 1981.
"They thanked me and said
goodbye," he said.
The reason they said good
bye is apparent: Drell isn't
satisfied with the Reagan ad
ministration's current arms
control policy. In fact, he is
fearful about the prospect of a
nuclear war.
"The challenge to avoid a
nuclear holocaust is the
number one challenge we
face," he said.
As a physicist and a
humanist, Drell deplores nu
clear weapons.
"They're basically weapons
of suicide. A controlled, lim
ited, winnable nuclear war is
utter nonsense."
But the scientist is optimistic
about the chances of avoiding
a nuclear disaster.
"I think that leaders of all
countries that have nuclear
weapons, or consider them
selves potential targets of nu
clear weapons, realize how
dangerous a nuclear war would
be," he said.
He is encouraged that the

present generation of nuclear
weapons hasn't been used yet.
"For 38 years we've had nu
clear weapons, and we've had
wars, and we haven't used
them," he said. "I don't know

of another time in the history
of mankind when we've had
very effective and dangerous
weapons for two generations
and our fear and respect for
them prevented us trom using
them."
"I just hope we don't lose
that fear and resped."
Drell believes th.it scientists

in a nuclear era have a unique
responsibility to explain the
technical aspects of political
decisions to society's leaders.
"Our understanding of na
ture has reached a point where
it is possible in ways never be
fore practical for us to have
major impact on the conditions
of human life," he said. "The
contact between science and
society and governments is
more important than ever be
cause of the magnitude of the
impact of our achievements."
The key to avoiding nuclear
war is making deterrence
work, Drell said. The United
States needs "on one hand se
cure retaliatory forces and on
the other hand progress in
arms control."
Drell said he was pleased by
the recent emergence of a
"major arms control consti
tuency" among the public. All
progress in arms control has
been the direct result of
people insisting that "they
didn't want bombs in the bac
kyard," Drell said.
Although he is no longer a
consultant to the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency,
Drell still keeps up with the
major arms control proposals

within the administration.
For example, the Scowcroft
report — which contains the
recommendations of a presi
dential advisory commission
on strategic forces — has "a
number of good recom
mendations and a number of
recommendations that I dis
agree with," Drell said.
The high-energy physicist,
who co-authored a proposal to
bass the MX missile on small
submarines last year, disagrees
with the Scowcroft Commis
sion's recommendation to
base the MX in Minuteman
silos.
The United States needs se
cure basing for its retaliatory
forces, Drell said. Putting the
MX in vulnerable silos is
against the goal of deterrence,
which is having "survivable
retaliatory forces, not vulnera
ble ones."
It might seem paradoxical for
a theoretical physicist to ar
dently support arms control.
Theories he develops now
might be used later for
weapons of mass destruction.
Drell admitted he could not
know if the basic research he is
doing could be used for devel
oping nuclear weapons. In

most basic research, but par
ticularly in particle physics,
"you don't know what the im
pact is."
According to SLAC Director
Wolfgang Panofsky, Drell is
unusual among theoretical
physicists in that he enjoys
working with other people.
Panofsky described his deputy
director and executive head of
theoretical physics as a
"hard-working, extremely
bright, very thoughtful" man.
In fact, Drell, who received
his bachelor's degree from
Princeton and his master's and
doctoral degrees from the Uni
versity of Illinois, seems well
liked by all his colleagues.
SLAC personnel director
Douglas Dupen had no diffi
culty describing Drell.
''The only word is
sweetheart," Dupen said.
"He's a prince."
Drell, the father of three,
doesn't work all the time. For
relaxation, he particularly en
joys playing chamber music on
his violin.
Between teaching, research
ing, testifying and writing, it
might seem surprising that he
has time. The physicist sighed.
"The day could be longer."
