## Marvin Gaye-a wild and sexy guy with an upbeat message 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
Marvin Gaye
Circle Star Theater
April 24, 1983

Besides Stevie Wonder and Smokey
Robinson, the most influential Motown
singer-songwriter has to be Marvin Gaye.
Easily the sexiest of those mentioned, Gaye
represented the lustier side of Motown's
relatively clean image. On such '60s stan
dards as "Can I Get A Witness," "How Sweet
It Is (To Be Loved By You)," and Motown's
largest seller ever, "I Heard It Through The
Grapevine, Gaye showcased an earthy
soulful intensity much like Otis Redding. A
superb writer as well, (he wrote numerous
hits for himself and other Motown acts, such
as Dancing in the Streets" for Martha and
the Vandellas), Gaye always strives to ex
pand Motown's horizons.
His time fully came, with 1971 s classic
album What's Going On. One of the first
(and still one of the finest) black political
social-musical commentaries ever, Gaye
took on the ghetto ("Inner City Blues Make

Me Want To Holler"), the environment
("Mercy, Mercy (The Ecology)"), and rela
tionships ( What s Going On ). In doing so,
Gaye went beyond anyone's expectations
for a Motown musician. It paved the way for
Stevie Wonder s later extrapolations on the
same themes, and it gave respectability to
black music in general.
Gaye continued this peak in 1973 with a
purely erotic album entitled Let's Get It On,
which provoked just that. Besieged with his
new sex image, though, Gaye lost sight of his
musical goals and tastes, and for the rest of
the '70s he was struggling to just stay afloat.
He fled to Europe after a rash of ill
happenings—a divorce, a slew of financial
difficulties and the end of his contract and
ties with Motown—and retired from the
music scene for more than three years.
However, in 1982, Gaye resurfaced on Co
lumbia Records with the album Midnight
Love. Gaye played almost every instrument
by himself on the album which also hap
pened to yield the hottest single of the year,
Sexual Healing." Gave was back in top
form, finally dealing favorably with his sex

image, so it would have been foolish tor any
Motown fan to miss out on seeing one of the
finest soulsters ever. Performing at the Cir
cle Star Theater, Gaye was classy, smooth,
and sensual, just as he looks on his album
covers.
Backed up by an extravagant 20-piece
band and four sultry female vocalists, Gaye
was able to present tull\ his immense talents
as a performer. Whether it was his soft
spoken persona on suih ballads as "If I
Could Build My Whole World Around You"
or his gritty, getting down, sexual persona
on "Let's Get It On," Gaye displayed a wide
range of capabilities. Through his extremely
evocative voice and his emotional ren
derings, Gaye successfully communicated
to the audience a sense of the tensions that
bring together and tear apart lovers.
For instance, for the second song of the
night, Gaye acted as if he was talking to his
girl on the telephone. However, he ad
libbed lines to reveal that his girl was reject
ing him and leaving for another man. Thus,
to the accompaniment of a slow dirge-like
bass run, Gaye was drawing the audience
into feeling this tension of being rejected for

another. However, Caye soon transformed
this "rejection" into a reality by joining that
lone bass rifting and plunging into a stagger
ing version of "I Heard It Through The
Grapevine." Therefore, when Caye sang the
lines, "You know that a man ain't supposed
to cry, but these tears I can't hold inside,"
members of the audience were able to envi
sion themselves in the same predicament.
This ability to convey totally the loss of a
love and the suffering and pain involved in
such a loss, was made apparent by Gaye
throughout his performance. However,
never once did this feeling of loss seem lack
ing in conviction and sincerity. In many
songs, Caye tortured himself through horrid
visions of a love that ended in tragedy. Ironi
cally though, his only comfort was found in
the music and the dancing trance that he
found himself in while singing these songs
of personal loss. This was best observed
when he did a medley of his famous duet hits
for Motown, such as "Ain't Nothin' Like The
Real Thing," "Your Precious Love," and
"You're All I Need To Get By." In these
tunes, Gaye was completely unable to con
tain his emotional loss. Rather sounding like

simple puppy love songs, they took on an
urgent and heartfelt quality and meaning.
Never once, however, did Gaye try to
place himself above his audience. He strove
to create a symbiotic relationship with his
audience, in which each other's love could
flow through one another. So when Gaye
tempted the crowd by asking if they wanted
Sexual Healing," he was asking it for more
than purely comical reasons (although the
screams heard in reply to that question were
quite amusing). In reality, Gaye was trying to
compel the crowd to apply any type of "heal
ing," whether sexual, social, or political, to
one another. In a way, it was a way for Gaye
to convey the themes of "What's Going On"
in a much more accessible fashion. How
ever, whereas "What's Going On" arose out
of confusion, anger, and black pride. "Sex
ual Healing" was formed from love and
hope.
Rarely did Gaye fail in this "healing" pro
cess in his hour and a half performance.
Even his newer songs off Midnight Love had
the intensity of his finest songs. It's a plea
sure that Gaye is back with none of his pow
ers diminished.
