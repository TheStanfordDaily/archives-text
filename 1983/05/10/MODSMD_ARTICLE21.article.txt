# New-Wave anger, old-time gospel and a dull old tune
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
In Exposed, writer-director James Toback allows Nas
tassia Kinski to show a lot of anger — much of it a kind of
self-indulgent, irrational, defensive New Wave anger
that defines her in a way that is different from her other
movies. Giving her this kind of edge turns out to be a
very smart move, because it releases more energy than
her nice-girl roles in Tess and Cat People allowed her to
work up. As Elizabeth Carlson, an English student break
ing out of an affair with an impossible, egotistic profes
sor, Leo (played by Toback himself), Kinski wears a black
leather jacket and blood-red pants, and she can't seem
to stand still; later, when Elizabeth has moved to New
York and become a famous model, she dances wildly
around her apartment to the old rocker "It's in His Kiss,"
hugging the walls and ending up smashing a wine glass in a
spoiled-brat snit.
None of this is great acting — Toback is such an out
of-control director that you'd never expect him to shape
a performance, and so Kinski is sloppy and excessive.
But the restless, pissed-off quality she gives Elizabeth
almost makes you forget how dull she was in those other
pictures, and it permits her appealing, earthy vulnerabil
ity to emerge from beneath somethingand in contrast to
something.
Toback's first movie, Fingers, was a nutty collage of
Dostoevski, Norman Mailer, Martin Scorsese and Ber
nardo Bertolucci, with a hero (played by Harvey Keitel)
who was a lot like Rojack in Mailer's American Dream
and Paul in Last Tango in Paris. It was masturbatory and
nonsensical, overloaded with an obsessive, literary sen
sibility, but it had a fascinating sort of energy that was
half intellectual and half kinetic. His second attempt,
Love and Money, was never released. Exposed is more
commercially viable than Fingers (it couldn't help but
be), but it's very weird and mostly terrible, with long,
overwritten passages that rival Leo's hyperbolic, self
important lecture on The Sorrows of Young Werther at
the beginning.
But by casting himself as such a ridiculous windbag
(his scenes have the impro-sketch rhythm of the early De
Palma parodies, Greetings and Hi Mom!), he seems to
invite us to have a good time and not take anything in the
picture seriously. That includes Rudolf Nureyev's recita
tion of a poem by William Carlos Williams and the hip Far
Left cliches about power and destruction Toback has put
in the mouths of Harvey Keitel (as a South American
terrorist) and various other characters. When we know
we don't have to think about the pseudo-philosophical
doggerel he's stuck everyone in the movie with (except
Nastassia Kinski), we can relax.
Nureyev, wrapped up in a thick, lisping accent, plays
Daniel, a violinst who involves Elizabeth in his scheme to
take revenge on Keitel for the deaths he has caused
(including Daniel's mother's). The convoluted story
doesn't really make sense, and it takes so long to get
going that by the time Toback reaches the final shoot
out the movie seems to be about absolutely nothing.
The New York and Paris settings and the high fashion
milieu lead one to expect a high tech thriller like Eyes of
Laura Mars or Dressed to Kill or Diva, but though it's
impressively shot, by the legendary Henri Decae, and
there is at least one great image — a Concorde landing in
a metallic fog like a huge-beaked bird testing its perch —
Toback takes his movie in another direction altogether.
He turns everything into an aggressive, stylized joke.

Exposed may be the first example of a new sub-genre:
belligerent farce.
The two performers at the center of Say Amen, Some
body — Thomas A. Dorsey, the "father of gospel
music," and his prize pupil, Willie Mae Ford Smith — are
irrepressible oldsters who need to use walkers when
they stand up to sing. You get the feeling that George T.
Nierenberg, who produced and directed this documen
tary, caught the last vestiges of first-generation gospel.
Dorsey started out as Ma Rainey's pianist, and his best
songs, like "If You See My Savior, Tell Him That You Saw
Me," are bluesy and really swing; Smith still sings in the
style of Bessie Smith and later women of the blues like
Etta Motten and Ivy Anderson.

One of the many pleasures of this movie is that if you
are as unfamiliar with old-time gospel as I was, you find
out how amazing the best of it is, and you see the links,
not only to jazz and blues, but also to show music.
(When Dorsey hauls out that deep, crackling voice of
his, he can still glide into a slick '20s vibrato.) And though
there is much talk in the film about legacy and con
tinuum, Dorsey's songs seem so much stronger than the
more recent stuff — like "Jesus Dropped the Charges"
by the O'Neal Twins — that Nierenberg's movie is in
evitably about loss.
The O'Neals — thick, multi-chinned middle-aged men
with '50s-hip sideburns — represent the second genera
tion of gospellers, and though they speak sadly about

the problems of living in the "hit record" age, it's hard to
tell exactly where they stand on this issue. Their appear
ance makes them demode, but they are smooth and
bland — defused — and you wonder how long ago
gospel underwent the transformation from rough-hewn
Chicago-born lifeblood music to mass-market pop. (A
clip of the great Mahalia Jackson in the '50s, her hair
piled characteristically on top of her head like an Egyp
tian headdress, tells us that it wasn't so very long ago.)
Even the vivacious younger singers Nierenberg shows
us, Delois Barrett Campbell and Zella Jackson Price,
have Motown-influenced looks — either of them might
be considered for the role of the Diana Ross-based
character in Dreamgirls. And when you see Thomas A.
Dorsey, that wonderful, tough old bird with the long,
full jaw and wide oval eyes, his arm upraised and index
finger pointed, his face stern and animated and proud,
you can feel that something immense and powerful has
fallen away.
Nierenberg is a smart documentarian with a sense of
irony. Whereas the makers of last year's Gospel, David
Leivick and Frederick A. Ritzenberg, restricted them
selves to concert footage (and the result was a fairly
relentless 90 minutes), Nierenberg understood that
these performers were likely to reveal themselves in
unexpected ways if he let them talk as well as sing.
Consequently, he has captured some lovely, unpredict
able moments, like Willie Mae Ford Smith's grandson
Keith rolling his eyes in amused impatience when she
preaches at him; Delois Barrett Campbell's private,
I've-been-through-this-battle-before smile when her
husband encourages her to spend more time with him
and less on the road; and Smith being rocked in the arms
of another woman at a gospel service like a contented
baby.
Everything Thomas Dorsey does is filmworthy. The
title of the movie echoes his words when; quoting a line
from a blues ballad about how to make a woman feel
good, he shows us how a Chicago club pianist could
have made the leap to gospel. Dorsey embodies the
bond between the sacred and the secular; he's an au
thentic folk hero.
In interviews, John Sayles always talks about his desire
to make movies he's never seen, but very little in his new
picture, Baby It's You, is fresh. Set in the mid-'6os, it tells
the story of an improbable romance between Jill
(Rosanna Arquette), an honor roll student from a loving,
liberal Jewish family, and "Sheik" (Vincent Spano), a
sleek, disreputable, unhappy Italian kid. It follows them
through their senior high school year in Trenton, New
Jersey through their changes as "Sheik" runs off to
Miami to become and singer and Jill enters Sarah Lawr
ence as an aspiring actress. The theme is the way in
which we submerge ourselves in different kinds of exc
lusive groups out of discomfort and defensiveness, and
how these groups alter our perspectives and cause us to
reject the valid experiences of our past. But, surpris
ingly, Sayles' writing keeps tumbling into platitudes, and
the acting isn't very interesting except for a few inflamed
moments from Vincent Spano. He and Rosanna Ar
quette do so little for each other as performers that we
keep wondering why "Sheik" and Jill's affair drags on for
so long. A few of the scenes are well observed, but the
only truly exciting moments in the movie are provided
by the four Bruce Springsteen numbers of the sound
track.
