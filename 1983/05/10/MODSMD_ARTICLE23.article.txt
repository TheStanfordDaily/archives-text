# Caustic fumes force local evacuation

A leak of chemical fumes resulted in the evacuation of
40 to 50 people from three Palo Alto buildings yesterday
evening.
According to Chief Chuck Challenger of the Palo Alto
Fire Department, fumes of sodium hydroxide escaped
from a tanker picking up waste materials from the Adval
loi Company on Fabian Way. The incident occurred at
approximately 5:10 p.m.
A worker loading the materials into the tanker "heard
a hissing sound" and then discovered 15 pounds of
pressure in the tank when there should have been a five
pound vacuum, Challenger said.
"We did open a valve on the bottom of the tank to let
off pressure," Challenger said, so fumes were released
for "three or four or five minutes."

The fumes were not toxic but were caustic, meaning
they were capable of causing burns, according to Chal
lenger.
The Advolloi Co. and two other buildings in the vicin
ity were evacuated, "just for safety because we weren't
sure what we were up against," Challenger said.
When a temperature guage indicated that heat and
pressure within the tank were dissipating, water was
added to the tank to dilute the sodium hydroxide and
the tanker was moved out of Palo Alto, according to
Challenger. "The problem virtually solved itself."
The pressure in the tank was apparently caused by a
mixing of sodium hydroxide with another chemical, ac
cording to Challenger. "But we never concluded what it
was mixed with," he said.
