The Daily incorrectly reported yes
terday that Chemistry Prof. James
Collman was names California scien
tist of the year for his experimenta
tion with superconductivity in syn
thetic materials. In actuality, Col
lman received the award "in recogni
tion of his design and synthesis of a
new class of chemical catalyst, using
knowledge from biological respira
tion." According to Collman, his
work with superconductivity is "just
beginning and highly speculative."
The Daily regrets any inconvenience
the error may have caused.
