Next year's housing assignments
may have been released yesterday,
but some students are still wonder
ing where University officials will
draw the cut-off lines for various re
sidences.
"It's been quite thankfully dull,"
said Mario Acquesta, assistant at the
Office of Residential Education, re
ferring to the annual housing lottery.
"A lot of the exciting part (of the
draw) happened several weeks ago."
Nearly all of the cut-off numbers
will be finalized after Round Two as
signments are made.
Acquesta said his office was pretty
happy with the results of this year s
housing lottery, calling it "a notice
able improvement over last year."
He noted that the cut-offs for various
residences vary widely, but com
pared to last year, students generally
had "significantly improved"
chances of getting into the resi
dences of their choice.
Students have until noon Thursday
to decide whether or not they want
to accept their present housing as
signments, enter the second round

of the draw, or drop out of the lottery
altogether. Students need not sub
mit anything to the Office of Resi
dential Education to enter Round
Two.
Acquesta said only about 85 eligi
ble men have not been guaranteed
housing this year, "a noticeable im
provement over last year." He said
these men will be assigned first in
Round Two, followed by all other
unguaranteed men "up to the first
couple hundred.
"Historically, we've had a lot more
movement for men than women in
Round Two," said Acquesta. He cited
the approximately 150-160 men who
pledged for fraternities last year and
eventually dropped out of the draw.
Despite Acquesta's contention
that this year's draw has been
"thankfully dull" in the Office of Res
idential Education, emotion still runs
high campus-wide in the wake of
Round One results.
"There is justice in the world," said
freshman Nancy Asbill in response to
news of her impending assignment
to Storey House. "I'm really excited.
I hope they have a lot of parties."
Asbill insisted that she "deserved"

her 228 draw number. "I've had a
hard year," she said.
Positive reaction to housing as
signments was not limited to stu
dents who drew low draw numbers.
Lupie Amezquita, a sophomore who
drew 4775 and claims his group of
four "were the last people assigned
in the draw" said he was "glad our
group stayed together."
But some of the responses to hous
ing assignments have been far from
favorable. Manuell Morales, a
three-year Stern resident who drew
4775 for his unguaranteed senior
year and boasts an over-all draw
number average "of over 4750" said
he would like to know "when and
how the annual housing lottery wili
change.
"I'll be lucky to live in a doorway
somewhere," said Morales of his
present unassigned status. "It's re
ally impractical for me to live off
campus. I don't have transporta
tion."
"We were boofed royally," said
Augie Martinez, a junior who drew
1732. "We were shooting for a six
person suite, but it looks like we
don't have a chance."
