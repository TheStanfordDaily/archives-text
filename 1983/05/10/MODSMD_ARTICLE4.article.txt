# University warns frats on drug sales

### SID ATKINS Senior staff writer 
The University has cautioned three
fraternities—Kappa Alpha, Delta Up
silon and Alpha Delta Phi—about
rumored drug sales in their houses,
according to Diana Conklin, director
of the Row.
"We hear rumors—a lot," Conklin
said. "We have said to the KAs, DUs
and the ADs that if selling is going on
their houses, it has to stop."
Conklin said that the warnings are
not part of a specific "crack-down"
effort by the University, but just part
of general concern about drug deal
ing which is damaging to the living
environment on campus.
"If it affects the residential envi
ronment, then we will address the
issue. Students feel like they're in a
protected little world. But when you
are dealing drugs with the big boys
you can get your knees broken just
like everybody else," Conklin said.
The president of the Kappa Alpha
house (KA), Rocky Rief, said that the
University "came down hard" on the
KAs and a few other fraternities.
"They told us it was our responsibil
ity to govern the affairs in our own
house, but that they didn't want any
selling going on. They also told us
that they don't want any freshmen
confronted with drugs during rush."
Rief said the specific problem had

been taken care of in the KA house.
"The RA and I went to the guys and
explained the situation. They de
cided on their own to stop. They
didn't want their backs to the wall."
Delta Upsilon President Chris Ehly
denied having spoken directly with
the University about drug dealing in
the house, but said it was "kind of
scary" how much the University
knows.
Ehly said he thought the University
heard some of these rumors from
plant services workers who have de
veloped a good rapport with stu
dents. "It's interesting that they
know as much as they do. They might
have people running around, who
knows?" Ehly said.
Conklin said that the University
doesn't need informants, though,
because "the rumor mill works too
well."
Conklin said she approached the
Alpha Delts months ago to warn
them of the problem. She said, "I
was not tolerant or lenient with them
at all."
But Alpha Delt President Mike
Chaple said they have not received
any calls from the Row recently.At a
house meeting towards the begin
ning of rush, Alpha Delt members
reached a group consensus not to
have drugs associated with their
