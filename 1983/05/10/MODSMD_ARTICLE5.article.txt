# Teller reaffirms innocence

### VANCE McMAHAN 
Edward Teller is tired — not because he is in his
mid-70s and in the twilight of a distinguished career
as a nuclear physicist, and not because he currently
holds positions as a Hoover Institution Senior Re
search Fellow, a consultant at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, and a member of the White
House Science Council. He is tired because of a
newspaper report that threatens to blemish his repu
tation.
But even as Teller slumps backward in the chair
inside his Hoover office and his baggy eyelids blink to
recognize a visitor, one thing is clear: he is going to
fight back.
On April 28, the New York Times reported that
Teller and others with strong connections to the Re
agan administration had been offered stock in a small
laser-technology company that could benefit from
the president's proposed space-age nuclear defense
plan. White House officials are currently investigat
ing Teller's receipt of stock from Helionetics.
Teller finds the publication of the Times article on
the same day he was scheduled to testify before the
House Armed Services subcommittee a "strange
coincidence."
He was in Washington to testify on behalf of Presi
dent Reagan's "Star Wars" defense program.
"In my opinion, the New York Times attempted to
counteract my testimony by dragging in spurious is

sues based on incorrect facts," Teller told the Daily
Friday. After giving his testimony, Teller noticed the
television crews coming toward him.
"The only thing the television people were in
terested in was the New York Times article which had
nothing to do with my argument on how to spend
money on defense."
Why would the Times want to divert attention from
Teller's testimony? "The New York Times moves in
strange ways," Teller replied. "Why did they help
Castro get into power? My political opinion, what
ever its worth, seems to be the opposite of the New
York Times point of view."
Teller reiterated his innocence in the controversy.
He claims he bought stock in the laser company,
Helionetics, at a "reasonable price" during the Carter
administration. He still holds the original stock, he
said, and has neither bought nor sold any stock
shares since then.
Charges that he used his influence with Reagan to
help Helionetics are particularly puzzling to Teller.
He said that naturally he exercised "as much influ
ence, direct or indirect, as I possible could ... I
thought and still think we must avoid war. For this
reason we should emphasize defense instead of re
taliation."
Teller said he saw the president and his advisers
only once at the White House's own request. He was,
however, part of a group that heard
the end of the Reagan address hours
before the president delivered it to
the nation.
"Needless to say," Teller said, "I
had no opportunity to influence the
stock market."
The New York Times also inferred
that Helionetics stands to substan
tially benefit from Reagan's defense
proposal. Teller said such claims are
"absurd." Helionetics stands to be
nefit from the proposals "about as
much as a five-and-ten-cent store"
would, he added.
