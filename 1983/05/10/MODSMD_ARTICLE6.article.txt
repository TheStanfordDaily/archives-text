Spanish socialists claim victory
Madrid, Spain— The governing Socialist Party
claimed victory in nationwide municipal elections on
the basis of partial results announced early yesterday.
With 57 percent of the ballots counted from Sun
day's elections, Vice Premier Alfonso Guerra told re
porters projections indicated the Socialists would ob
tain 45 percent of the vote compared to 27 percent for
the right-wing Popular Alliance.
Guerra predicted the Communists would get 7 per
cent and the Democratic and Social Center of former
Premier Adolfo Suarez 1.7 percent. There also were a
number of regional parties with candidates in the
elections.
Guerra, who took an active role in the campaigning
while Premier Felipe Gonzalez remained in the back

ground, said 67 percent of the country's 27.5 million
registered voters cast ballots.
That compared to an 80 percent turnout in last Oc
tober's general elections that carried the Socialists to
power.
Guerra said the Socialists won absolute majorities in
the city councils of 12 provincial capitals, including
Madrid and Seville, and had enough seats to control
the Barcelona council.
The Popular Alliance, led by Manuel Frega, won
control of four provincial capitals while the Com
munists retained Cordoba, he said.
Voters also elected members of 13 new regional
parliaments, and Guerra said the Socialists had ob
tained majorities in seven of the 13.
Interior Minister Jose Barrienuevo said there were
no incidents of violence reported during the voting. /

Top reporter charged with fraud
Frankfurt, West Germany —Stern magazine yester
day asked prosecutors to file fraud charges against a
star reporter who said he found Hitler's diaries. The
magazine claimed the journalist "fell into the hands
of a swindler" who cheated Stern out of millions of
dollars.
The wife of reporter Gerd Heidemann vigorously
denied the magazine's allegations, saying her hus
band had given Sfern evidence the diaries were genu
ine and that his editors told him the evidence had
been verified.
Stern, a Hamburg-based newsweekly, issued a
statement yesterday saying publisher Henri Nannen
had filed a complaint with the state prosecutor against
Heidemann, Stern's top investigative reporter.

Under West German law, the prosecutor's office
must investigate to determine whether any charges
are warranted. The office made no comment yester
day.
Peter Koch, one of two Stern editors who resigned
over the diaries scandal, said Sunday that Stern paid
the equivalent of $4.1 million to buy 62 volumes of
"Hitler's secret diaries" that Heidemann said he had
tracked down in East Germany.
"We don't know yet where the money is," Stern
spokesman Gunther Schoenfeld told The Associated
Press by telephone.
Heidemann, 51, was not at home yesterday. When
asked if he had any of the money, his wife, Gina, said,
"Unfortunately not. Then we might have been able to
hire a good attorney.... My husband has none of that
money."
Government investigators announced last Friday
that chemical tests and historical analysis had shown
the documents to be "obvious fakes" plagiarized
from a 1962 book and made with materials manufac
tured after World War 11.
In an apology to its readers and the "victims of Nazi
power," Stern said it "is not the publication in which
Nazi justification should be able to find its place."
Mrs. Heidemann insisted that Stern's three chief
editors — two of whom resigned Saturday — were to
blame.
"He delivered a few samples to Stern and they as
sured him that they would check them for authentici
ty. My husband told me that after they checked them,
they asked him to obtain the rest of them."
In his statement, Nannen said, "Heidemann named
as a supplier of the purported Hitler diaries a man
who most probably does not exist. Heidemann had
declared earlier that he received the diaries from an
informer whom he could not identify because human
lives would be endangered."
The publisher said Heidemann still refused to name
his sources after being given an "ultimatum."
Thatcher calls for early election
London —Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called
a June 9 general election yesterday, deciding to go to
the voters 11 months early with opinion polls indicat
ing her Conservative government will retain power.
The socialist Labor Party opposition accused her of
"cutting and running" before her five-year term ex
pired in May 1984 to take advantage of what it called a
temporary improvement in the recession-hit British
economy.
"If we give her another chance, it'll be even
worse," said Labor's 69-year-old leader Michael Foot.
He will campaign on the most leftist platform in his
party's history, including unilateral British nuclear
disarmament.
Four years after she became Europe's first woman
prime minister, Mrs. Thatcher, 57, said she set the date
because of election fever fanned by the press and Par
liament in recent months.
"It was becoming intolerable and everyone was be
coming obsessed with the date of an election," she
said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
"That was bad for Britain and it's bad for people
who are thinking whether to invest here. We had to
end that."
Mrs. Thatcher said she made up her mind after an
eight-hour strategy session Sunday with aides at her
country residence, Chequers.
"I made a provisional decision last night and slept
on it, as it's always wise to do. Finally I decided this
morning," she said.
She summoned an emergency Cabinet meeting at
her 10 Downing St. office in London. Her decision be
came obvious when she left for Buckingham Palace to
ask Queen Elizabeth II to dissolve Parliament on Fri
day. The queen is empowered to do so at the prime
minister's request.
Houses pass anti-tampering bills
Washington —Prompted by last year's Tylenol
cyanide deaths, both houses of Congress passed legis
lation yesterday making it a federal crime to tamper
with consumer products.
The bill was approved in a 292-0 vote in the House.
The Senate passed its version later in the day in a
unanimous voice vote.
The House and Senate now will try to resolve dif
ferences between the two measures, which set tough
new penalties for people convicted of tampering with
consumer products.
Both measures provide a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment and a $100,000 fine if serious injury or
death results from tampering with a consumer prod
uct.
Under the Senate bill, tampering merely with the
intent to damage a business would bring a maximum
penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and a $20,000 fine.
The House bill mandates no federal penalties for per
sons who tamper with products solely to damage a
business's reputation; the tampering must include a
significant threat of bodily harm.
Mitterrand calls for fixed rates
Paris —President Francois Mitterrand, comparing
the world economic crisis to the situation after World

War 11, called yesterday for a return to fixed currency
exchange rates between the United States and its al
lies.
Mitterrand also made clear that France would con
sider withdrawing from future economic summits if
the one scheduled for Williamsburg, Va., in less than
three weeks ends in failure. He spoke to foreign,
trade and finance ministers from 24 nations in Paris for
the annual meeting of the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development.
In contrast to Mitterrand's message, U.S. Secretary
of State George P. Shultz earlier in the day carried the
Reagan administration's optimistic economic outlook
to the ministers. He also urged allies to "beware" that
trade with Soviet bloc countries does not become too
important to their economies.
Mitterrand said at a reception for the ministers at
the presidential Elysee Palace: "Today, as after the
war, the world (economy) has to be reconstructed ...
The moment has come to think about a new Bretton
Woods," referring to the agreement that regulated
currencies from the end of World War II until the ear
ly 19705. "Outside such a proposition, there is no safe
ty."
Mitterrand said consultations should begin with
"an international monetary conference at the highest
level, within the framework of the IMF," the Interna
tional Monetary Fund.
High U.S. interest rates make the dollar stronger,
and European currencies weaker by comparison, but
the Reagan administration says interest rates cannot
come down until budget deficits are reduced.
Shultz said the United States is headed fora"yearof
unmistakable and significant growth" that could help
stimulate "recovery in OECD countries and the de
veloping world."
The OECD ministerial meeting, which ends today,
is laying the groundwork for the summit of seven ma
jor Western industrialized nations in Williamsburg at
which President Reagan will be host.
Powell criticizes death penalty
Savannah, Ga. —Supreme Court Justice Lewis
Powell, citing an "intolerable" backlog of criminals
on death row, said yesterday that the death penalty
should be abolished unless prolonged delays in carry
ing it out are eliminated.
"This malfunctioning of our system of justice is un
fair to the hundreds of persons confined anxiously on
death row," Powell told a conference of judges from
the 11th U.S. Judicial Circuit.
"It also disserves the public interest in the im
plementation of lawful sentences...," he said.
"Unless the courts — and Congress — discharge
their duty to move effectively to address this problem,
the legislatures of the several states should abolish
capital punishment."
Powell played an important role in the April 22 ex
ecution of John Louis Evans 111, convicted of murder
ing a Mobile, Ala., pawn shop owner in 1977. Powell
rejected attempts to delay Evans' execution and, to
head off further appeals to other court members, let
Evans' lawyers know that six other justices agreed with
his decision.
Evans was six hours away from the electric chair in
1979 when Powell's Supreme Court colleague, Justice
William Rehnquist, issued a stay based upon an ap
peal by Evans' mother.
Powell warned against a "rush to judgment" in cap
ital cases, but criticized the use of "repetitive review
to draw out for years the resolution of issues that have
or should have been resolved earlier."
Stocks up amid mixed trading
The stock market turned in a mixed performance
Monday as traders searched for potential sources of
profit in a market hovering at all-time high levels.
Lower-priced stocks and issues that have lagged in
the market's broad rally were among the day's win
ners.
After trailing for most of the session, stocks rising in
price outnumbered falling issues 9-8 at the close on
the New York Stock Exchange.
Today's weather
Sunny and a little warmer today with highs in the
60s to low 70s. Northwest winds breezing along at 15
to 25 mph. Tonight and tomorrow will be mostly fair.

Spanish socialists claim victory
Madrid, Spain— The governing Socialist Party
claimed victory in nationwide municipal elections on
the basis of partial results announced early yesterday.
With 57 percent of the ballots counted from Sun
day's elections, Vice Premier Alfonso Guerra told re
porters projections indicated the Socialists would ob
tain 45 percent of the vote compared to 27 percent for
the right-wing Popular Alliance.
Guerra predicted the Communists would get 7 per
cent and the Democratic and Social Center of former
Premier Adolfo Suarez 1.7 percent. There also were a
number of regional parties with candidates in the
elections.
Guerra, who took an active role in the campaigning
while Premier Felipe Gonzalez remained in the back

ground, said 67 percent of the country's 27.5 million
registered voters cast ballots.
That compared to an 80 percent turnout in last Oc
tober's general elections that carried the Socialists to
power.
Guerra said the Socialists won absolute majorities in
the city councils of 12 provincial capitals, including
Madrid and Seville, and had enough seats to control
the Barcelona council.
The Popular Alliance, led by Manuel Frega, won
control of four provincial capitals while the Com
munists retained Cordoba, he said.
Voters also elected members of 13 new regional
parliaments, and Guerra said the Socialists had ob
tained majorities in seven of the 13.
Interior Minister Jose Barrienuevo said there were
no incidents of violence reported during the voting. /

Top reporter charged with fraud
Frankfurt, West Germany —Stern magazine yester
day asked prosecutors to file fraud charges against a
star reporter who said he found Hitler's diaries. The
magazine claimed the journalist "fell into the hands
of a swindler" who cheated Stern out of millions of
dollars.
The wife of reporter Gerd Heidemann vigorously
denied the magazine's allegations, saying her hus
band had given Sfern evidence the diaries were genu
ine and that his editors told him the evidence had
been verified.
Stern, a Hamburg-based newsweekly, issued a
statement yesterday saying publisher Henri Nannen
had filed a complaint with the state prosecutor against
Heidemann, Stern's top investigative reporter.

Under West German law, the prosecutor's office
must investigate to determine whether any charges
are warranted. The office made no comment yester
day.
Peter Koch, one of two Stern editors who resigned
over the diaries scandal, said Sunday that Stern paid
the equivalent of $4.1 million to buy 62 volumes of
"Hitler's secret diaries" that Heidemann said he had
tracked down in East Germany.
"We don't know yet where the money is," Stern
spokesman Gunther Schoenfeld told The Associated
Press by telephone.
Heidemann, 51, was not at home yesterday. When
asked if he had any of the money, his wife, Gina, said,
"Unfortunately not. Then we might have been able to
hire a good attorney.... My husband has none of that
money."
Government investigators announced last Friday
that chemical tests and historical analysis had shown
the documents to be "obvious fakes" plagiarized
from a 1962 book and made with materials manufac
tured after World War 11.
In an apology to its readers and the "victims of Nazi
power," Stern said it "is not the publication in which
Nazi justification should be able to find its place."
Mrs. Heidemann insisted that Stern's three chief
editors — two of whom resigned Saturday — were to
blame.
"He delivered a few samples to Stern and they as
sured him that they would check them for authentici
ty. My husband told me that after they checked them,
they asked him to obtain the rest of them."
In his statement, Nannen said, "Heidemann named
as a supplier of the purported Hitler diaries a man
who most probably does not exist. Heidemann had
declared earlier that he received the diaries from an
informer whom he could not identify because human
lives would be endangered."
The publisher said Heidemann still refused to name
his sources after being given an "ultimatum."
Thatcher calls for early election
London —Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called
a June 9 general election yesterday, deciding to go to
the voters 11 months early with opinion polls indicat
ing her Conservative government will retain power.
The socialist Labor Party opposition accused her of
"cutting and running" before her five-year term ex
pired in May 1984 to take advantage of what it called a
temporary improvement in the recession-hit British
economy.
"If we give her another chance, it'll be even
worse," said Labor's 69-year-old leader Michael Foot.
He will campaign on the most leftist platform in his
party's history, including unilateral British nuclear
disarmament.
Four years after she became Europe's first woman
prime minister, Mrs. Thatcher, 57, said she set the date
because of election fever fanned by the press and Par
liament in recent months.
"It was becoming intolerable and everyone was be
coming obsessed with the date of an election," she
said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
"That was bad for Britain and it's bad for people
who are thinking whether to invest here. We had to
end that."
Mrs. Thatcher said she made up her mind after an
eight-hour strategy session Sunday with aides at her
country residence, Chequers.
"I made a provisional decision last night and slept
on it, as it's always wise to do. Finally I decided this
morning," she said.
She summoned an emergency Cabinet meeting at
her 10 Downing St. office in London. Her decision be
came obvious when she left for Buckingham Palace to
ask Queen Elizabeth II to dissolve Parliament on Fri
day. The queen is empowered to do so at the prime
minister's request.
Houses pass anti-tampering bills
Washington —Prompted by last year's Tylenol
cyanide deaths, both houses of Congress passed legis
lation yesterday making it a federal crime to tamper
with consumer products.
The bill was approved in a 292-0 vote in the House.
The Senate passed its version later in the day in a
unanimous voice vote.
The House and Senate now will try to resolve dif
ferences between the two measures, which set tough
new penalties for people convicted of tampering with
consumer products.
Both measures provide a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment and a $100,000 fine if serious injury or
death results from tampering with a consumer prod
uct.
Under the Senate bill, tampering merely with the
intent to damage a business would bring a maximum
penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and a $20,000 fine.
The House bill mandates no federal penalties for per
sons who tamper with products solely to damage a
business's reputation; the tampering must include a
significant threat of bodily harm.
Mitterrand calls for fixed rates
Paris —President Francois Mitterrand, comparing
the world economic crisis to the situation after World

War 11, called yesterday for a return to fixed currency
exchange rates between the United States and its al
lies.
Mitterrand also made clear that France would con
sider withdrawing from future economic summits if
the one scheduled for Williamsburg, Va., in less than
three weeks ends in failure. He spoke to foreign,
trade and finance ministers from 24 nations in Paris for
the annual meeting of the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development.
In contrast to Mitterrand's message, U.S. Secretary
of State George P. Shultz earlier in the day carried the
Reagan administration's optimistic economic outlook
to the ministers. He also urged allies to "beware" that
trade with Soviet bloc countries does not become too
important to their economies.
Mitterrand said at a reception for the ministers at
the presidential Elysee Palace: "Today, as after the
war, the world (economy) has to be reconstructed ...
The moment has come to think about a new Bretton
Woods," referring to the agreement that regulated
currencies from the end of World War II until the ear
ly 19705. "Outside such a proposition, there is no safe
ty."
Mitterrand said consultations should begin with
"an international monetary conference at the highest
level, within the framework of the IMF," the Interna
tional Monetary Fund.
High U.S. interest rates make the dollar stronger,
and European currencies weaker by comparison, but
the Reagan administration says interest rates cannot
come down until budget deficits are reduced.
Shultz said the United States is headed fora"yearof
unmistakable and significant growth" that could help
stimulate "recovery in OECD countries and the de
veloping world."
The OECD ministerial meeting, which ends today,
is laying the groundwork for the summit of seven ma
jor Western industrialized nations in Williamsburg at
which President Reagan will be host.
Powell criticizes death penalty
Savannah, Ga. —Supreme Court Justice Lewis
Powell, citing an "intolerable" backlog of criminals
on death row, said yesterday that the death penalty
should be abolished unless prolonged delays in carry
ing it out are eliminated.
"This malfunctioning of our system of justice is un
fair to the hundreds of persons confined anxiously on
death row," Powell told a conference of judges from
the 11th U.S. Judicial Circuit.
"It also disserves the public interest in the im
plementation of lawful sentences...," he said.
"Unless the courts — and Congress — discharge
their duty to move effectively to address this problem,
the legislatures of the several states should abolish
capital punishment."
Powell played an important role in the April 22 ex
ecution of John Louis Evans 111, convicted of murder
ing a Mobile, Ala., pawn shop owner in 1977. Powell
rejected attempts to delay Evans' execution and, to
head off further appeals to other court members, let
Evans' lawyers know that six other justices agreed with
his decision.
Evans was six hours away from the electric chair in
1979 when Powell's Supreme Court colleague, Justice
William Rehnquist, issued a stay based upon an ap
peal by Evans' mother.
Powell warned against a "rush to judgment" in cap
ital cases, but criticized the use of "repetitive review
to draw out for years the resolution of issues that have
or should have been resolved earlier."

Spanish socialists claim victory
Madrid, Spain— The governing Socialist Party
claimed victory in nationwide municipal elections on
the basis of partial results announced early yesterday.
With 57 percent of the ballots counted from Sun
day's elections, Vice Premier Alfonso Guerra told re
porters projections indicated the Socialists would ob
tain 45 percent of the vote compared to 27 percent for
the right-wing Popular Alliance.
Guerra predicted the Communists would get 7 per
cent and the Democratic and Social Center of former
Premier Adolfo Suarez 1.7 percent. There also were a
number of regional parties with candidates in the
elections.
Guerra, who took an active role in the campaigning
while Premier Felipe Gonzalez remained in the back

ground, said 67 percent of the country's 27.5 million
registered voters cast ballots.
That compared to an 80 percent turnout in last Oc
tober's general elections that carried the Socialists to
power.
Guerra said the Socialists won absolute majorities in
the city councils of 12 provincial capitals, including
Madrid and Seville, and had enough seats to control
the Barcelona council.
The Popular Alliance, led by Manuel Frega, won
control of four provincial capitals while the Com
munists retained Cordoba, he said.
Voters also elected members of 13 new regional
parliaments, and Guerra said the Socialists had ob
tained majorities in seven of the 13.
Interior Minister Jose Barrienuevo said there were
no incidents of violence reported during the voting. /

Top reporter charged with fraud
Frankfurt, West Germany —Stern magazine yester
day asked prosecutors to file fraud charges against a
star reporter who said he found Hitler's diaries. The
magazine claimed the journalist "fell into the hands
of a swindler" who cheated Stern out of millions of
dollars.
The wife of reporter Gerd Heidemann vigorously
denied the magazine's allegations, saying her hus
band had given Sfern evidence the diaries were genu
ine and that his editors told him the evidence had
been verified.
Stern, a Hamburg-based newsweekly, issued a
statement yesterday saying publisher Henri Nannen
had filed a complaint with the state prosecutor against
Heidemann, Stern's top investigative reporter.

Under West German law, the prosecutor's office
must investigate to determine whether any charges
are warranted. The office made no comment yester
day.
Peter Koch, one of two Stern editors who resigned
over the diaries scandal, said Sunday that Stern paid
the equivalent of $4.1 million to buy 62 volumes of
"Hitler's secret diaries" that Heidemann said he had
tracked down in East Germany.
"We don't know yet where the money is," Stern
spokesman Gunther Schoenfeld told The Associated
Press by telephone.
Heidemann, 51, was not at home yesterday. When
asked if he had any of the money, his wife, Gina, said,
"Unfortunately not. Then we might have been able to
hire a good attorney.... My husband has none of that
money."
Government investigators announced last Friday
that chemical tests and historical analysis had shown
the documents to be "obvious fakes" plagiarized
from a 1962 book and made with materials manufac
tured after World War 11.
In an apology to its readers and the "victims of Nazi
power," Stern said it "is not the publication in which
Nazi justification should be able to find its place."
Mrs. Heidemann insisted that Stern's three chief
editors — two of whom resigned Saturday — were to
blame.
"He delivered a few samples to Stern and they as
sured him that they would check them for authentici
ty. My husband told me that after they checked them,
they asked him to obtain the rest of them."
In his statement, Nannen said, "Heidemann named
as a supplier of the purported Hitler diaries a man
who most probably does not exist. Heidemann had
declared earlier that he received the diaries from an
informer whom he could not identify because human
lives would be endangered."
The publisher said Heidemann still refused to name
his sources after being given an "ultimatum."
Thatcher calls for early election
London —Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called
a June 9 general election yesterday, deciding to go to
the voters 11 months early with opinion polls indicat
ing her Conservative government will retain power.
The socialist Labor Party opposition accused her of
"cutting and running" before her five-year term ex
pired in May 1984 to take advantage of what it called a
temporary improvement in the recession-hit British
economy.
"If we give her another chance, it'll be even
worse," said Labor's 69-year-old leader Michael Foot.
He will campaign on the most leftist platform in his
party's history, including unilateral British nuclear
disarmament.
Four years after she became Europe's first woman
prime minister, Mrs. Thatcher, 57, said she set the date
because of election fever fanned by the press and Par
liament in recent months.
"It was becoming intolerable and everyone was be
coming obsessed with the date of an election," she
said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
"That was bad for Britain and it's bad for people
who are thinking whether to invest here. We had to
end that."
Mrs. Thatcher said she made up her mind after an
eight-hour strategy session Sunday with aides at her
country residence, Chequers.
"I made a provisional decision last night and slept
on it, as it's always wise to do. Finally I decided this
morning," she said.
She summoned an emergency Cabinet meeting at
her 10 Downing St. office in London. Her decision be
came obvious when she left for Buckingham Palace to
ask Queen Elizabeth II to dissolve Parliament on Fri
day. The queen is empowered to do so at the prime
minister's request.
Houses pass anti-tampering bills
Washington —Prompted by last year's Tylenol
cyanide deaths, both houses of Congress passed legis
lation yesterday making it a federal crime to tamper
with consumer products.
The bill was approved in a 292-0 vote in the House.
The Senate passed its version later in the day in a
unanimous voice vote.
The House and Senate now will try to resolve dif
ferences between the two measures, which set tough
new penalties for people convicted of tampering with
consumer products.
Both measures provide a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment and a $100,000 fine if serious injury or
death results from tampering with a consumer prod
uct.
Under the Senate bill, tampering merely with the
intent to damage a business would bring a maximum
penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and a $20,000 fine.
The House bill mandates no federal penalties for per
sons who tamper with products solely to damage a
business's reputation; the tampering must include a
significant threat of bodily harm.
Mitterrand calls for fixed rates
Paris —President Francois Mitterrand, comparing
the world economic crisis to the situation after World

War 11, called yesterday for a return to fixed currency
exchange rates between the United States and its al
lies.
Mitterrand also made clear that France would con
sider withdrawing from future economic summits if
the one scheduled for Williamsburg, Va., in less than
three weeks ends in failure. He spoke to foreign,
trade and finance ministers from 24 nations in Paris for
the annual meeting of the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development.
In contrast to Mitterrand's message, U.S. Secretary
of State George P. Shultz earlier in the day carried the
Reagan administration's optimistic economic outlook
to the ministers. He also urged allies to "beware" that
trade with Soviet bloc countries does not become too
important to their economies.
Mitterrand said at a reception for the ministers at
the presidential Elysee Palace: "Today, as after the
war, the world (economy) has to be reconstructed ...
The moment has come to think about a new Bretton
Woods," referring to the agreement that regulated
currencies from the end of World War II until the ear
ly 19705. "Outside such a proposition, there is no safe
ty."
Mitterrand said consultations should begin with
"an international monetary conference at the highest
level, within the framework of the IMF," the Interna
tional Monetary Fund.
High U.S. interest rates make the dollar stronger,
and European currencies weaker by comparison, but
the Reagan administration says interest rates cannot
come down until budget deficits are reduced.
Shultz said the United States is headed fora"yearof
unmistakable and significant growth" that could help
stimulate "recovery in OECD countries and the de
veloping world."
The OECD ministerial meeting, which ends today,
is laying the groundwork for the summit of seven ma
jor Western industrialized nations in Williamsburg at
which President Reagan will be host.
Powell criticizes death penalty
Savannah, Ga. —Supreme Court Justice Lewis
Powell, citing an "intolerable" backlog of criminals
on death row, said yesterday that the death penalty
should be abolished unless prolonged delays in carry
ing it out are eliminated.
"This malfunctioning of our system of justice is un
fair to the hundreds of persons confined anxiously on
death row," Powell told a conference of judges from
the 11th U.S. Judicial Circuit.
"It also disserves the public interest in the im
plementation of lawful sentences...," he said.
"Unless the courts — and Congress — discharge
their duty to move effectively to address this problem,
the legislatures of the several states should abolish
capital punishment."
Powell played an important role in the April 22 ex
ecution of John Louis Evans 111, convicted of murder
ing a Mobile, Ala., pawn shop owner in 1977. Powell
rejected attempts to delay Evans' execution and, to
head off further appeals to other court members, let
Evans' lawyers know that six other justices agreed with
his decision.
Evans was six hours away from the electric chair in
1979 when Powell's Supreme Court colleague, Justice
William Rehnquist, issued a stay based upon an ap
peal by Evans' mother.
Powell warned against a "rush to judgment" in cap
ital cases, but criticized the use of "repetitive review
to draw out for years the resolution of issues that have
or should have been resolved earlier."
Stocks up amid mixed trading
The stock market turned in a mixed performance
Monday as traders searched for potential sources of
profit in a market hovering at all-time high levels.
Lower-priced stocks and issues that have lagged in
the market's broad rally were among the day's win
ners.
After trailing for most of the session, stocks rising in
price outnumbered falling issues 9-8 at the close on
the New York Stock Exchange.
