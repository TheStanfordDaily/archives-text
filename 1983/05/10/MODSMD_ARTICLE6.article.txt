Spanish socialists claim victory
Madrid, Spain— The governing Socialist Party
claimed victory in nationwide municipal elections on
the basis of partial results announced early yesterday.
With 57 percent of the ballots counted from Sun
day's elections, Vice Premier Alfonso Guerra told re
porters projections indicated the Socialists would ob
tain 45 percent of the vote compared to 27 percent for
the right-wing Popular Alliance.
Guerra predicted the Communists would get 7 per
cent and the Democratic and Social Center of former
Premier Adolfo Suarez 1.7 percent. There also were a
number of regional parties with candidates in the
elections.
Guerra, who took an active role in the campaigning
while Premier Felipe Gonzalez remained in the back

ground, said 67 percent of the country's 27.5 million
registered voters cast ballots.
That compared to an 80 percent turnout in last Oc
tober's general elections that carried the Socialists to
power.
Guerra said the Socialists won absolute majorities in
the city councils of 12 provincial capitals, including
Madrid and Seville, and had enough seats to control
the Barcelona council.
The Popular Alliance, led by Manuel Frega, won
control of four provincial capitals while the Com
munists retained Cordoba, he said.
Voters also elected members of 13 new regional
parliaments, and Guerra said the Socialists had ob
tained majorities in seven of the 13.
Interior Minister Jose Barrienuevo said there were
no incidents of violence reported during the voting. /

Top reporter charged with fraud
Frankfurt, West Germany —Stern magazine yester
day asked prosecutors to file fraud charges against a
star reporter who said he found Hitler's diaries. The
magazine claimed the journalist "fell into the hands
of a swindler" who cheated Stern out of millions of
dollars.
The wife of reporter Gerd Heidemann vigorously
denied the magazine's allegations, saying her hus
band had given Sfern evidence the diaries were genu
ine and that his editors told him the evidence had
been verified.
Stern, a Hamburg-based newsweekly, issued a
statement yesterday saying publisher Henri Nannen
had filed a complaint with the state prosecutor against
Heidemann, Stern's top investigative reporter.

Under West German law, the prosecutor's office
must investigate to determine whether any charges
are warranted. The office made no comment yester
day.
Peter Koch, one of two Stern editors who resigned
over the diaries scandal, said Sunday that Stern paid
the equivalent of $4.1 million to buy 62 volumes of
"Hitler's secret diaries" that Heidemann said he had
tracked down in East Germany.
"We don't know yet where the money is," Stern
spokesman Gunther Schoenfeld told The Associated
Press by telephone.
Heidemann, 51, was not at home yesterday. When
asked if he had any of the money, his wife, Gina, said,
"Unfortunately not. Then we might have been able to
hire a good attorney.... My husband has none of that
