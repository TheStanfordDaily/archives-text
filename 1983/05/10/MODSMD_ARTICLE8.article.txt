# The 						Center for Entrepreneurship offers new programs for new ideas
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
"Students want to get out
and run something on their
own, be their own boss and
take on a lot more responsibil
ity at an earlier age," according
to business school student
Thayer Wendell, one of the
founders of a new campus
group, the Stanford University
Center for Entrepreneurship.
According to Wendell, the
center is an attempt to inte
grate the skills of students from
a wide range of academic and
business backgrounds. Un
dergraduates as well as*
graduates from the business,
engineering and liberal arts
schools are getting involved.
Mary Van Maren, a co
chairman of the center's con
ference planning group, said a
core group of about 20 stu
dents has grown to more than
50 students as the center gears
up for its Conference on En
trepreneurship here on May
21. "We hope to see new faces
every week and to have
touched a lot of people on
campus through the confer
ence," she said.
"People are moving from
community help to self-help.
How should this trend be di
rected? Entrepreneurs are pro
viding opportunities to retrain
and retool the work force.
They are people who have the
ability to make an idea reality,
and not necessarily for profit.
Hopefully, some of these is
sues will be discussed at the
conference," she added.

Steven Wisch, a senior in
volved in planning for the cen
ter's internship program, said
that even though the program
is still in an elementary stage,
five interns have already been
placed with venture capital
firms. He said he expects the
program to "really get going
next year."

Wisch said another program
which he started would make it
possible for students to visit
with and learn from entrepre
neurs in their factories and of
fices. The program, appropri
ately enough, is called the on
site program.
Sophomore Letty Mallin,
who joined the center because
of the "energy and innovation"
of the programs, said she was
"very interested in getting in
volved in the internship pro
gram next year." Right now,
she's busy planning for the
conference which will host
such entrepreneurial greats as

|.R. Simplot, the inventor of
the frozen french fry, Nolan
Bushnell of Atari and David Di
xon, founder of World Cham
pionship Tennis and the
United States Football League.
Mallin's contribution to the
conference was persuading
Robert Pittman, the founder of
MTV (Music Television), to

give one of the seminars at the
conference. "He's coming.
That's incredible!" she said.
"I think people are getting
sick of the values of much of
American society," Mallin said.
"The nine to five day, working
for someone else your whole
life and then the gold watch. If
you can start your own com
pany, you can run everything
your own way," she added.
The center moved into its
new office in Owen House last
February. Since then, office
furniture has been supple
mented with an IBM typewriter
and a computer terminal tied

into the computer at the
Graduate School of Business,
according to David Gleba, one
of the founders. For him, en
trepreneurship is a "sense of
personal autonomy and crea
tive self mastery."
Wendell said she thought
the number of students in
terested in entrepreneurship
was growing. "A student that
had a good idea 20 years ago
wouldn't have had the oppor
tunities open to him that stu
dents have today. Societal
standards have changed. Par
ents are more likely to be sup
portive. And the growth of the
venture capital pool makes it
easier to get entrepreneurial
ventures underway."
Original funding for the cen
ter came in the form of three
$500 grants from the Business
School, the School of En
gineering and the Office of
Graduate Studies and Re
search. The group hopes to
fund itself next year with the
proceeds from the conference
and donations, according to
Van Maren.
Van Maren said the philoso
phy behind the conference
was to "bring together entre
preneurs who could provide
both inspiration and the
knowledge of some of the
practical skills required of an
entrepreneur. We're aiming
for 50 percent student partici
pation and 50 percent commu
nity members." Admission to
the day-long conference will
be $15 for students, $40 for all
others.

"Students want to get out
and run something on their
own, be their own boss and
take on a lot more responsibil
ity at an earlier age," according
to business school student
Thayer Wendell, one of the
founders of a new campus
group, the Stanford University
Center for Entrepreneurship.
According to Wendell, the
center is an attempt to inte
grate the skills of students from
a wide range of academic and
business backgrounds. Un
dergraduates as well as*
graduates from the business,
engineering and liberal arts
schools are getting involved.
Mary Van Maren, a co
chairman of the center's con
ference planning group, said a
core group of about 20 stu
dents has grown to more than
50 students as the center gears
up for its Conference on En
trepreneurship here on May
21. "We hope to see new faces
every week and to have
touched a lot of people on
campus through the confer
ence," she said.
"People are moving from
community help to self-help.
How should this trend be di
rected? Entrepreneurs are pro
viding opportunities to retrain
and retool the work force.
They are people who have the
ability to make an idea reality,
and not necessarily for profit.
Hopefully, some of these is
sues will be discussed at the
conference," she added.

Steven Wisch, a senior in
volved in planning for the cen
ter's internship program, said
that even though the program
is still in an elementary stage,
five interns have already been
placed with venture capital
firms. He said he expects the
program to "really get going
next year."

Wisch said another program
which he started would make it
possible for students to visit
with and learn from entrepre
neurs in their factories and of
fices. The program, appropri
ately enough, is called the on
site program.
Sophomore Letty Mallin,
who joined the center because
of the "energy and innovation"
of the programs, said she was
"very interested in getting in
volved in the internship pro
gram next year." Right now,
she's busy planning for the
conference which will host
such entrepreneurial greats as

|.R. Simplot, the inventor of
the frozen french fry, Nolan
Bushnell of Atari and David Di
xon, founder of World Cham
pionship Tennis and the
United States Football League.
Mallin's contribution to the
conference was persuading
Robert Pittman, the founder of
MTV (Music Television), to

give one of the seminars at the
conference. "He's coming.
That's incredible!" she said.
"I think people are getting
sick of the values of much of
American society," Mallin said.
"The nine to five day, working
for someone else your whole
life and then the gold watch. If
you can start your own com
pany, you can run everything
your own way," she added.
The center moved into its
new office in Owen House last
February. Since then, office
furniture has been supple
mented with an IBM typewriter
and a computer terminal tied

into the computer at the
Graduate School of Business,
according to David Gleba, one
of the founders. For him, en
trepreneurship is a "sense of
personal autonomy and crea
tive self mastery."
Wendell said she thought
the number of students in
terested in entrepreneurship
was growing. "A student that
had a good idea 20 years ago
wouldn't have had the oppor
tunities open to him that stu
dents have today. Societal
standards have changed. Par
ents are more likely to be sup
portive. And the growth of the
venture capital pool makes it
easier to get entrepreneurial
ventures underway."
Original funding for the cen
ter came in the form of three
$500 grants from the Business
School, the School of En
gineering and the Office of
Graduate Studies and Re
search. The group hopes to
fund itself next year with the
proceeds from the conference
and donations, according to
Van Maren.
Van Maren said the philoso
phy behind the conference
was to "bring together entre
preneurs who could provide
both inspiration and the
knowledge of some of the
practical skills required of an
entrepreneur. We're aiming
for 50 percent student partici
pation and 50 percent commu
nity members." Admission to
the day-long conference will
be $15 for students, $40 for all
others.
