# Kennedy stresses interest in major
## 
### SID ATKINS Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Ken
nedy told a squinting, sun-drenched
crowd of students at A Majors Event
yesterday that "the subject to major
in is exactly what you desire."
"What you do in your under
graduate life seldom relates to what
you'll do afterwards," Kennedy said.
"The most educated people aren't
doing what they are trained for, but
make their intelligence known in
sometimes obscure ways."
Kennedy was one of a group of
faculty and administration speakers
who told of their own experiences as
undergraduates and provided advice
for students confronted with an array
of possible majors.
Students tend to be too utilitarian
when they look at the value of their
majors, Kennedy said. The average
American changes jobs at least once
in the first five years out of school.
"What should a major be good for?
My answer is: you."
Kennedy originally set out to be a
creative writer while at Harvard, but
turned to biology after an upper level
English course, he said. "After turn
ing in my final short story for the
class, the instructor called me in and
asked me why I was doing this. I said,
'I want to be writer.' He asked me
what else I was interested in. I said
biology, and he told me that he
thought that would be a very good
field for me."
Also on hand was Provost Albert
Hastorf, who spoke to the students

about the advantages of studying the
humanitiesâ€”learning how to relate
to people, how to use common
sense, and what it means in general
to be a human being.
"You should study what you find
interesting, excitingand demanding,
and not what you think will be eco
nomically rewarding, because that
may not be true in 10 years," Hastorf
said.
While Kennedy and Hastorf told of
their college days, students con
tinued to gather around the 46 tables
spread out in the Quad representing
each major in the University. Up
pperclassmen and faculty in the re
spective departments gave advice,
information and sometimes even
beer and cookies to curious stu
dents.
According to Audrey Bernfield, di
rector of advising and career coun
seling and chief coordinator for the
event, the chief purpose of A Majors
Event is to "give students the mes
sage that they are free without pen
alty to major in what they love."
At the international relations table,
Administrative Asst. Barbara Caerlan
said, "We're primarily trying to com
bat the idea of majoring in something
just to get a job."
Kennedy said AMajors Event was a
great stimulus to the enthusiasm and
entrepreneurial spirit of the various
departments. "It shows that depart
ments aren't just lying there waiting
for students to come by, but are ac
tually interested in students."


lae So/Daily
NOT A WRITER: University President Donald Kennedy speaks at "A
Majors Event"yesterday on the importance of picking an interesting,
desirable undergraduate major. Other activities included departmental
demonstrations, a raffle and lots of free food.
Besides the speeches and de
partmental displays, A Majors Event
also provided entertainment, food
and t-shirt stands, and a raffle with
prizes of $100 Bookstore certificates
and lunches with Kennedy.
Another unique aspect of A Majors
Event was that it combined the ef
forts of almost every part of the Uni
versity. Residential Education, the
Alumni Association and Plants and
Services represent a few of the di
verse areas that contributed.
Bernfield said she thought people
were pleased with the turn-out,
aided by the second straight day of
sunny skies. "German Studies is not
too happy, though, because nobody
is drinking their beer."
"We were aiming mostly at the
freshmen and sophomores and we

think that's who turned out,"
Bernfield said.
Vivek Bhargava, a junior majoring
in history, said the turnout was
higher than expected because of the
weather. "People have been asking
questions about history as compared
with other subjects in the
humanities," he said.
Junior Jonathan Lutz said that most
of the questions at the economics
table dealt with planned changes in
the major requirements. "We really
not trying to recruit people, but just
to let them know more about the de
partment," Lutz said.
A large crowd surrounded the In
dustrial Engineering table, where
senior Scott Lynch explained, "Most
people just want to know what IE is."
Cold Michelobs served as incentive
to visit the already overcrowded de
partment's table. Lynch said that IE
definitely wasn't trying to recruit,

just to inform.
Students shopping for majors
seemed content, if not overwhelmed
with the amount of information
available. Freshman Kelly Gonser
said he found a lot of majors he pre
viously didn't know existed. "My de
cision will be a lot harder now, but it
will also be a lot more intelligent," he
said.
Sophomore Scott Ludeke said he is
trying to decide whether he should
major in geology or geophysics. "I'd
say I've had more luck just having a
good time drinking beer than I have
had at making decisions, though."
A Majors Event activities continue
today, with the individual depart
ments explaining some of their pro
grams. Although she was satisfied
with the success of the first day's ac
tivities, Bernfield said it was an
enormous organizational task to put
it all together.
