## The
						Stanford Daily An econ major and his arm 
### 
It may seem a little ironic that a University
which prides itself on being at the forefront of
research and education should draw unprece
dented national attention from a blond eco
nomics major named John Elway.
No one seemed to care that the University
had just sold its patented DNA cloning rights to
yet another genetic engineering firm. Instead,
America focused on a much more intriguing
drama: which way for Elway? The questions
bandied about on sports pages and in bars
across the nation were: Will he or won't he?
Baseball or football? Baltimore or New York?
The plot of the drama pitted East Coast against
West Coast and, more important, one man
against a mean institution — the NFL draft. The
cast of characters (George Steinbrenner, Frank
Kush and others) were deliciously evil and un
predictable. The setting — the All-American
golden boy on an idyllic college campus — was

ideal.
But our man had leverage, and he used it. He
showed the Colts that if they wanted to call his
bluff he'd be just happy to play his cards. And he
did. The next hand will be dealt in Denver.
Of course, it was fun to watch Elway challenge
the NFL draft. In the best Stanford tradition he
refused to submit to the standard way of doing
things. He skillfully used his options to get what
he wanted although he is now an unlikely reci
pient of the key to the city of Baltimore.
The Class of '83 has already made its mark,
and graduation is still more than a month away.
No doubt other future superstars are within the
ranks, eager to shine in their chosen field. But
for now they will have to resign themselves to a
slightly lower starting salary than Elway.
You can accomplish amazing things with an
economics degree.
