# Reshape medical priorities
## 
### 
There is no denying that high priority should
be placed on medical research in this country.
Developments in the laboratory often result in
greater and longer health for our citizens.
But the amount of public funding devoted to
medicine has been escalating. A few years ago,
in the era of double-digit inflation, the figures
did not seem so astounding; however, they do
now as they are going in the opposite direction
from the Consumer Price Index.
The exact cause of the continuing escalation
is disputed—the most often mentioned is the
altruistic attitude instilled in us by President
Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" and our
preoccupation with finding technological solu
tions to problems. Both factors have contrib
uted to the rising costs of medicine and medical
care and something has to be done to halt the
current trend.
This issue, of the costs of medicine, was
brought to our attention last week, when Or
ganic Chemistry Prof. Oleg Jardezsky testified
before Congress. Jardezsky called for increased
National Institutes of Health funding for high
technology research projects.
If Congress listens to Jardezsky, who made
his comments in support of a 1982 NIH report,
the funding for NIH instrumentation programs
will increase by $25 million annually for the next
five years.
Jardezsky claimsthat iffundsare notallocated
as he so desires, improvements in the practice
medicine will be slowed and the United
States' leading position in research could be
jeopardized. His arguments, granted, are im

portant ones, but $125 million is no small sum.
Technological developments have come to
be viewed as cure-alls, particularly in the field of
medicine, where we are trying to find ways to
combat chronic diseases which have uncertain
causes and no known cures.
New instruments, particularly in the field of
radiology, have unquestionably made life easier
and less painful for both patient and doctor, but
we fear a time when only technology can solve
our problems.
Research in biology and chemistry aimed to
wards determining the exact causes of heart
disease and cancer—our chronic killers—
should continue, but we should not put ourse
lves in a situation where we have machines that
cannot find solutions to diseases.
There are risk factors, like smoking cigarettes
and ingesting saccharin, associated with the
major disease killers. While we remain in this
cure-less period, we should educate the
public on how to best stay healthy. More proj
ects like the Stanford Heart Disease Prevention
Program should be started and expanded, par
ticularly in areas where people are least likely to
know or care about habits that make them more
susceptible to disease.
Congress should consider splitting up Jar
dezsky's called-for funds, devoting some to NIH
instrumentation programs for technology and
the rest to prevention programs. That allocation
might be less glamorous, but we have to face
the fact that fighting disease may have to be
done by people, not machines.
