# East Palo Alto should incorporate
## 
### 
On June 7, pending a ruling from
the state District Court of Appeal in
San Francisco, the voters of East Palo
Alto will decide whether to incorpo
rate as a new city. There are a lot of
issues in the election, but the fun
damental one is this: Should people
have a direct voice in the govern
ment that makes decisions affecting
their daily lives? The incorporation of
East Palo Alto will bring decision
making power to a level that is both
easily accessible and directly ac
countable to the city's residents, and
should for this reason be strongly
supported.
Here is some brief background in
formation. East Palo Alto is a com
munity of less than three square
miles, with a population of about
18,000. It consists of a small section
on the Palo Alto side of Highway 101
(known as the West of Bayshorearea)
that is primarily multi-unit resi
dences, and a larger section on the
other side of the freeway (East
Bayshore) that is largely single-family
homes. The population is about 60
percent black and mostly working
class. As an unincorporated area, the
community is under the govern
mental jurisdiction of the San Mateo
County Board of Supervisors; there
is also an elected "municipal coun
cil," which has advisory powers to
the Board. - —
It is commonly acknowledged by
both the supporters and the oppo
nents of incorporation that the status
quo is unsatisfactory. The level of ser
vices to the area is low, and the lack of
businesses in the area leads to both
high unemployment and to a high
outflow of money from the commu
nity. The issue then is not whether
there is a problem, but how to solve
it; and the evidence strongly suggests
that incorporation is the best solu
tion.
As I stated at the beginning, the
fundamental argument for incorpora
tion is that it puts the relevant
decision-making power within the
reach of the members of the commu
nity.
Under the status quo, the resi
dents of East Palo Alto play a very
small part in electing the county
board of supervisors and command
a correspondingly small share of the
supervisors' attention. The munici

pal council, with a minimal staff and
budget and advisory powers only,
has not been able to significantly
help solve the community's prob
lems. Incorporation, and the corre
sponding establishment of a city
government directly responsible to
the residents of the community, will
allow attention, energy and money
to be focused on the questions of
development and services that have
been such difficult problems to ad
dress.
A city government has the power
to make the kinds of decisions and
arrangements that are necessary to
revitalize a community. Power over
planning, zoning and development
are necessary to create a situation
that is favorable for private develop
ment of business and industry with
out being detrimental to the com
munity. The county government has
been too far away and unconcerned
with these questions, with the result
that after years of talk, nothing has
changed.
The primary alternative to incorpo
ration, other than the unsatisfactory
status quo, is annexation to Menlo
Park. The Menlo Park city govern
ment would have the same powers
that an incorporated East Palo Alto
would have.
But there are a number of reasons
why this is very unlikely ever to take
place. First of all, Menlo Park already
contains an area known as Belle
Haven that is very similar to East Palo
Alto in its race and class composi
tion; annexation of East Palo Alto
would give the combined regions of
Belle Haven and East Palo Alto a
majority of the voting population, a
prospect the current Menlo Park
government would not eagerly an
ticipate. Secondly, from the point of
view of East Palo Alto, the situation of
Belle Haven, which is a part of Menlo
Park, has not been significantly
helped by that status.
With annexation as an unlikely al
ternative, opponents of incorpora
tion have focused on the question of
the financial viability of the new city.
Using the slogan "Save Our Homes,"
they have advanced the claim that
the low tax base of the future city will
result in tax increases that will raise
rents and force homeowners out of
their homes. Several reports by pri
vate consultants, however, including

SRI International, have indicated that
the city will be financially sound.
A recent report by Angus
McDonald and Associates for the San
Mateo County Local Agencies For
mation Commission (LAFCo)
suggests that the city will have a
budget surplus of about $1.5 million
after five years. The budget surplus
comes both from the fact that for the
first year of incorporation a city can
collect revenues while still drawing
on county services (a state law de
signed to help in city start-up), and
from the fact that there is significant
state and federal money that is avail
able to cities but not to unincorpo
rated areas. This prediction does in
clude an increased "user fee" for
utilities, in the amount of $17 per
household per year; this hardly con
stitutes the kind of tax that will force
people out of their homes. Beyond
that, property tax increases are lim
ited to 2 percent per year by Proposi
tion 13.
Opponents of incorporation have
also argued that the city will be un
able to provide adequate ser
vices.They claim quite rightly that
fire protection, health and welfare
services and police services will con
tinue to be provided by outside
agencies — but this simple statement
misses some very important points.
After the first year, the new city will
provide its own police department, a
very important factor in a largely
minority community where relations
with the police have been problema
tic. The city would continue to pay
taxes to and be part of the Menlo
Park Fire District, which already con
tains East Palo Alto, Atherton and
several other areas of the county in
addition to Menlo Park; this will be
no problem, as the district provides
good service. And finally, it should
be noted that health and welfare ser
vices have always been county func
tions in all cities.
The issue of roads has come up
repeatedly as well. County estimates
put the cost of refurbishing the roads
in East Palo Alto at $22 million, out of
which the county has agreed to pro
vide $4.5 million. The fact is, how
ever, that the county has agreed to
only $4.5 million whether the city in
corporates or not. Improving the
roads will be a problem, and the new
city government will have to work
hard to find the money for capital

improvements. But the fact that the
county has not done anything until
now suggests that remaining unin
corporated will not be any better a
solution.
Who stands to lose, then, from in
corporation? I believe it is not coin
cidental that a very significant part of
the opposition (although certainly
not all) comes from owners of apart
ments. In an unincorporated area,
"landlords" (I use the term for
property-owners of both sexes) are
not subject to any of the legislation
— rent stabilization, just-cause evic
tion, deposit and security require
ments and so forth — that a city can
use for the protection of renters'
rights. So in arguing that incorpora
tion will raise taxes and rents, the
landlords are trying to persuade re
nters as well that laissez-faire is to the
renters' advantage. Stanford stu
dents who rent in East Palo Atlo
should look into this closely — find
out what laws your landlord is bound
by, and then consider the potential
advantages of incorporation.
Even though incorporation is in
the interests of students and other
short term renters, however, the real
advantage is for the permanent resi
dents of the city. Incorporation will
give the city both the political power
and the inspiration it needs to force
fully address its problems. And there
is no doubt that there are real prob
lems. But if the Appeals Court rules
favorably, in less than a month the
residents of East Palo Alto will be able
to take the first and perhaps most
important step in the renewal of their
community.

Paul Baer
Is this all there is?
On June 7, pending a ruling from
the state District Court of Appeal in
San Francisco, the voters of East Palo
Alto will decide whether to incorpo
rate as a new city. There are a lot of
issues in the election, but the fun
damental one is this: Should people
have a direct voice in the govern
ment that makes decisions affecting
their daily lives? The incorporation of
East Palo Alto will bring decision
making power to a level that is both
easily accessible and directly ac
countable to the city's residents, and
should for this reason be strongly
supported.
Here is some brief background in
formation. East Palo Alto is a com
munity of less than three square
miles, with a population of about
18,000. It consists of a small section
on the Palo Alto side of Highway 101
(known as the West of Bayshorearea)
that is primarily multi-unit resi
dences, and a larger section on the
other side of the freeway (East
Bayshore) that is largely single-family
homes. The population is about 60
percent black and mostly working
class. As an unincorporated area, the
community is under the govern
mental jurisdiction of the San Mateo
County Board of Supervisors; there
is also an elected "municipal coun
cil," which has advisory powers to
the Board. - —
It is commonly acknowledged by
both the supporters and the oppo
nents of incorporation that the status
quo is unsatisfactory. The level of ser
vices to the area is low, and the lack of
businesses in the area leads to both
high unemployment and to a high
outflow of money from the commu
nity. The issue then is not whether
there is a problem, but how to solve
it; and the evidence strongly suggests
that incorporation is the best solu
tion.
As I stated at the beginning, the
fundamental argument for incorpora
tion is that it puts the relevant
decision-making power within the
reach of the members of the commu
nity.
Under the status quo, the resi
dents of East Palo Alto play a very
small part in electing the county
board of supervisors and command
a correspondingly small share of the
supervisors' attention. The munici

pal council, with a minimal staff and
budget and advisory powers only,
has not been able to significantly
help solve the community's prob
lems. Incorporation, and the corre
sponding establishment of a city
government directly responsible to
the residents of the community, will
allow attention, energy and money
to be focused on the questions of
development and services that have
been such difficult problems to ad
dress.
A city government has the power
to make the kinds of decisions and
arrangements that are necessary to
revitalize a community. Power over
planning, zoning and development
are necessary to create a situation
that is favorable for private develop
ment of business and industry with
out being detrimental to the com
munity. The county government has
been too far away and unconcerned
with these questions, with the result
that after years of talk, nothing has
changed.
The primary alternative to incorpo
ration, other than the unsatisfactory
status quo, is annexation to Menlo
Park. The Menlo Park city govern
ment would have the same powers
that an incorporated East Palo Alto
would have.
But there are a number of reasons
why this is very unlikely ever to take
place. First of all, Menlo Park already
contains an area known as Belle
Haven that is very similar to East Palo
Alto in its race and class composi
tion; annexation of East Palo Alto
would give the combined regions of
Belle Haven and East Palo Alto a
majority of the voting population, a
prospect the current Menlo Park
government would not eagerly an
ticipate. Secondly, from the point of
view of East Palo Alto, the situation of
Belle Haven, which is a part of Menlo
Park, has not been significantly
helped by that status.
With annexation as an unlikely al
ternative, opponents of incorpora
tion have focused on the question of
the financial viability of the new city.
Using the slogan "Save Our Homes,"
they have advanced the claim that
the low tax base of the future city will
result in tax increases that will raise
rents and force homeowners out of
their homes. Several reports by pri
vate consultants, however, including

SRI International, have indicated that
the city will be financially sound.
A recent report by Angus
McDonald and Associates for the San
Mateo County Local Agencies For
mation Commission (LAFCo)
suggests that the city will have a
budget surplus of about $1.5 million
after five years. The budget surplus
comes both from the fact that for the
first year of incorporation a city can
collect revenues while still drawing
on county services (a state law de
signed to help in city start-up), and
from the fact that there is significant
state and federal money that is avail
able to cities but not to unincorpo
rated areas. This prediction does in
clude an increased "user fee" for
utilities, in the amount of $17 per
household per year; this hardly con
stitutes the kind of tax that will force
people out of their homes. Beyond
that, property tax increases are lim
ited to 2 percent per year by Proposi
tion 13.
Opponents of incorporation have
also argued that the city will be un
able to provide adequate ser
vices.They claim quite rightly that
fire protection, health and welfare
services and police services will con
tinue to be provided by outside
agencies — but this simple statement
misses some very important points.
After the first year, the new city will
provide its own police department, a
very important factor in a largely
minority community where relations
with the police have been problema
tic. The city would continue to pay
taxes to and be part of the Menlo
Park Fire District, which already con
tains East Palo Alto, Atherton and
several other areas of the county in
addition to Menlo Park; this will be
no problem, as the district provides
good service. And finally, it should
be noted that health and welfare ser
vices have always been county func
tions in all cities.
The issue of roads has come up
repeatedly as well. County estimates
put the cost of refurbishing the roads
in East Palo Alto at $22 million, out of
which the county has agreed to pro
vide $4.5 million. The fact is, how
ever, that the county has agreed to
only $4.5 million whether the city in
corporates or not. Improving the
roads will be a problem, and the new
city government will have to work
hard to find the money for capital

improvements. But the fact that the
county has not done anything until
now suggests that remaining unin
corporated will not be any better a
solution.
Who stands to lose, then, from in
corporation? I believe it is not coin
cidental that a very significant part of
the opposition (although certainly
not all) comes from owners of apart
ments. In an unincorporated area,
"landlords" (I use the term for
property-owners of both sexes) are
not subject to any of the legislation
— rent stabilization, just-cause evic
tion, deposit and security require
ments and so forth — that a city can
use for the protection of renters'
rights. So in arguing that incorpora
tion will raise taxes and rents, the
landlords are trying to persuade re
nters as well that laissez-faire is to the
renters' advantage. Stanford stu

should look into this closely — find

in East Palo Alto at $22 million, out of
which the county has agreed to pro
vide $4.5 million. The fact is, how
ever, that the county has agreed to
only $4.5 million whether the city in
corporates or not. Improving the
roads will be a problem, and the new
city government will have to work
hard to find the money for capital

improvements. But the fact that the
county has not done anything until
now suggests that remaining unin
corporated will not be any better a
solution.
Who stands to lose, then, from in
corporation? I believe it is not coin
cidental that a very significant part of
the opposition (although certainly
not all) comes from owners of apart
ments. In an unincorporated area,
"landlords" (I use the term for
property-owners of both sexes) are
not subject to any of the legislation
— rent stabilization, just-cause evic
tion, deposit and security require
ments and so forth — that a city can
use for the protection of renters'
rights. So in arguing that incorpora
tion will raise taxes and rents, the
landlords are trying to persuade re
nters as well that laissez-faire is to the
renters' advantage. Stanford stu
dents who rent in East Palo Atlo
should look into this closely — find
out what laws your landlord is bound
by, and then consider the potential
advantages of incorporation.
Even though incorporation is in
the interests of students and other
short term renters, however, the real
advantage is for the permanent resi
dents of the city. Incorporation will
give the city both the political power
and the inspiration it needs to force
fully address its problems. And there
is no doubt that there are real prob
lems. But if the Appeals Court rules
favorably, in less than a month the
residents of East Palo Alto will be able
to take the first and perhaps most
important step in the renewal of their
community.
