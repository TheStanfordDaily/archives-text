## Nuclear dangers: a way out 
### 
In this day and age it seems superfluous to state that
avoiding nuclear war is by far the biggest and most
urgent problem we face. For, any nuclear war confronts
us with the high probability of total destruction, with the
elimination of all life on earth. As Jonathan Schell said in
The Fate of the Earth, "The peril of human extinction
exists not because every single person in the world
would be killed by the immediate explosive and radioac
tive effects of a holocaust — something that is exceed
ingly unlikely, even at present levels of armament — but
because a holocaust might render the biosphere unfit
for human survival."
The destruction of life on earth in a nuclear war could
start through willful action through "an act that, without
quite admitting it to ourselves, we plan in certain cir
cumstances to commit. . .such as the defense of our
nation, or the defense of liberty, or the defense of
socialism or whatever else we happen to believe in." Or
it could start through "a wholly accidental attack,
triggered by human error or mechanical failure. On
three occasions in the last couple of years, American
nuclear forces were placed on the early stages of alert:
twice because of the malfunctioning of a computer
chip. . .and once when a test tape depicting a missile
attack was inadvertently inserted in the system." Such
accidental "attacks" become ever more likely as the
number of weapons is increased and the available time
to spot a mistake is reduced. Schell says ". . . if we are
honest with ourselves we have to admit that, unless we
rid ourselves of our nuclear arsenals, a holocaust not
only might occur but will occur — if not today, then
tomorrow; if not this year, then next."
While I have no quarrel with theadvocates of a nuclear
freeze who believe that one has to start somewhere to
stop this mad weapons build-up, I have two serious con
cerns about the freeze resolutions: the first is that a
freeze, even if agreed on and effective, would give many
people a false sense of security. For the weapons already
at our and the USSR's disposal are many times what is
needed to bring about the destruction of the earth. My
second concern is that the distrust between the two
superpowers and their peoples is steadily rising and
that, in this growing distrust, neither side dares disarm.
It is in the nature of people to see others in simple
colors, the more so, the less they know of the other.
Those of us who lived through World War II will recall
the popular hatred of the Japanese who were pictured as
slant-eyed, scheming, vicious yellow devils. Many
Americans today look at the Russians in much the same
biased way.
I believe that true and meaningful disarmament can
come about only through a mutual understanding of our
similarities and our differences, our mutual need for
survival, hatred of war and fear of a holocaust, our
differences in political ideas, religious beliefs and
habits.
Perhaps no one has studied and reported on the USSR
more thoroughly and dispassionately than George Ken-

nan, our former ambassador in Moscow. In his recent
book The Nuclear Delusion - Soviet-American Relations
in the Atomic Age he states: "If we in the West could get
over this fixation we have with the idea that the Russians
are dying to drop bombs on us, and think, instead, of
what is happening to our planet and address ourselves,
resolutely and rapidly, to preventing the catastrophe
that looms before us, we would be doing a great deal
better." From our military experts "an image arises, if
only initially for purposes of military planning, of an
utterly inhuman adversary, committed to our total de
struction and committed to it not for any coherent polit
ical reason but only because he has the capacity to inflict
it." Kennan realizes, of course, that "there has always
been an area where collaboration with Russia, as we
would like to see it, has not been possible. This was true
before the Revolution. It is true today. But there is
another area in which collaboration — and mutually
profitable collaboration — is possible."

To accomplish this, Kennan says, "American states
manship will have to overcome some of the traits that
have handicapped it in the past. . . It will have to over
come that subjectivity that caused Americans to be
strongly pro-Soviet at the height of the Stalin era and
equally anti-Soviet in the days of Khrushchev. . .It will
have to make greater progress than it has made to date in
controlling the compulsions of the military-industrial
complex. . and "American politicians will have to
learn to resist the urge to exploit, as a target for rhetori
cal demonstrations of belligerent vigilance, the image of
a formidable external rival in world affairs." In reality,
"this whole great militarization of concept about the
Cold War is largely unnecessary. . .Neither side wants a
third world war. Neither side sees in such a war a promis
ing means of advancing its interests. The West has no
intention of attacking the Soviet Union. The Soviet lead
ership, I am satisfied, has no intention and has never had
any intention, of attacking Western Europe," far less the
United States.
Unless such an approach is taken, and disarmament
becomes a sensible as well as an emotional necessity,
there is no way of avoiding the holocaust, for "modern
history offers no example of the cultivation by rival
powers of armed force on a massive scale which did not
in the end lead to an outbreak of hostilities."

urgent problem we face. For, any nuclear war confronts
us with the high probability of total destruction, with the
elimination of all life on earth. As Jonathan Schell said in
The Fate of the Earth, "The peril of human extinction
exists not because every single person in the world
would be killed by the immediate explosive and radioac
tive effects of a holocaust — something that is exceed
ingly unlikely, even at present levels of armament — but
because a holocaust might render the biosphere unfit
for human survival."
The destruction of life on earth in a nuclear war could
start through willful action through "an act that, without
quite admitting it to ourselves, we plan in certain cir
cumstances to commit. . .such as the defense of our
nation, or the defense of liberty, or the defense of
socialism or whatever else we happen to believe in." Or
it could start through "a wholly accidental attack,
triggered by human error or mechanical failure. On
three occasions in the last couple of years, American
nuclear forces were placed on the early stages of alert:
twice because of the malfunctioning of a computer
chip. . .and once when a test tape depicting a missile
attack was inadvertently inserted in the system." Such
accidental "attacks" become ever more likely as the
number of weapons is increased and the available time
to spot a mistake is reduced. Schell says ". . . if we are
honest with ourselves we have to admit that, unless we
rid ourselves of our nuclear arsenals, a holocaust not
only might occur but will occur — if not today, then
tomorrow; if not this year, then next."
While I have no quarrel with theadvocates of a nuclear
freeze who believe that one has to start somewhere to
stop this mad weapons build-up, I have two serious con
cerns about the freeze resolutions: the first is that a
freeze, even if agreed on and effective, would give many
people a false sense of security. For the weapons already
at our and the USSR's disposal are many times what is
needed to bring about the destruction of the earth. My
second concern is that the distrust between the two
superpowers and their peoples is steadily rising and
that, in this growing distrust, neither side dares disarm.
It is in the nature of people to see others in simple
colors, the more so, the less they know of the other.
Those of us who lived through World War II will recall
the popular hatred of the Japanese who were pictured as
slant-eyed, scheming, vicious yellow devils. Many
Americans today look at the Russians in much the same
biased way.
I believe that true and meaningful disarmament can
come about only through a mutual understanding of our
similarities and our differences, our mutual need for
survival, hatred of war and fear of a holocaust, our
differences in political ideas, religious beliefs and
habits.
Perhaps no one has studied and reported on the USSR
more thoroughly and dispassionately than George Ken-

nan, our former ambassador in Moscow. In his recent
book The Nuclear Delusion - Soviet-American Relations
in the Atomic Age he states: "If we in the West could get
over this fixation we have with the idea that the Russians
are dying to drop bombs on us, and think, instead, of
what is happening to our planet and address ourselves,
resolutely and rapidly, to preventing the catastrophe
that looms before us, we would be doing a great deal
better." From our military experts "an image arises, if
only initially for purposes of military planning, of an
utterly inhuman adversary, committed to our total de
struction and committed to it not for any coherent polit
ical reason but only because he has the capacity to inflict
it." Kennan realizes, of course, that "there has always
been an area where collaboration with Russia, as we
would like to see it, has not been possible. This was true
before the Revolution. It is true today. But there is
another area in which collaboration — and mutually
profitable collaboration — is possible."

To accomplish this, Kennan says, "American states
manship will have to overcome some of the traits that
have handicapped it in the past. . . It will have to over
come that subjectivity that caused Americans to be
strongly pro-Soviet at the height of the Stalin era and
equally anti-Soviet in the days of Khrushchev. . .It will
have to make greater progress than it has made to date in
controlling the compulsions of the military-industrial
complex. . and "American politicians will have to
learn to resist the urge to exploit, as a target for rhetori
cal demonstrations of belligerent vigilance, the image of
a formidable external rival in world affairs." In reality,
"this whole great militarization of concept about the
Cold War is largely unnecessary. . .Neither side wants a
third world war. Neither side sees in such a war a promis
ing means of advancing its interests. The West has no
intention of attacking the Soviet Union. The Soviet lead
ership, I am satisfied, has no intention and has never had
any intention, of attacking Western Europe," far less the
United States.
Unless such an approach is taken, and disarmament
becomes a sensible as well as an emotional necessity,
there is no way of avoiding the holocaust, for "modern
history offers no example of the cultivation by rival
powers of armed force on a massive scale which did not
in the end lead to an outbreak of hostilities."
