# Storyteller Joel Dickholtz continues old traditions

"What I'm doing is very trad
itional. People have been
doing it for thousands of years.
But in the context of Stanford
in the 1980s, it's absolutely off
the wall."
This is how storyteller Joel
Dickholtz, better known as
Joel ben Izzy, described his
work.
A senior majoring in English
with an interdisciplinary em
phasis on creative writing and
storytelling, Dickholtz became
interested in storytelling as a
result of his major. Storytelling
"combines the different things
I've studied," he claimed.
Dickholtz began studying at
Stanford in 1977 and after two
years, stopped-out with "no in
tention of ever returning." For
the next two years, he travelled
in Europe and worked at many
different occupations includ
ing a chef and a mime. Dick
holtz then decided to return
to school at UC Santa Cruz, en
rolling in their creative writing

program. At this time, the crea
tive writing program at UCSC
was not very good, according
to Dickholtz. His instructors
were "boosting" Stanford's
creative writing program.

brought him back to Stanford.
During the summer between
his year at UCSC and the cur
rent academic year, Dickholtz
became interested in storytel
ling. He said that while he was
in the creative writing program
at UCSC, "I was writing piles of
drivel." Also, he saw Robin
Williamson, a local profes
sional storyteller tell Celtic
stories. Williamson was an in
fluence on Dickholtz who said,
"I realized I couldn't tell Celtic
stories so I began with Yid
dish."

Because they "deal in lo
calized ways with universal is
sues," stories can "really cross
cultures," according to Dic
kholtz. Consequently, his re
pertoire includes stories from
many different ethnic and cul

tural backgrounds. He admits
that his favorites are Jewish
stories which go "right on the
border between laughter and
tears."
One type of story that Dick
holtz does not tell is the fairy
tale which he claims has "a lot
of values I don't agree with."
He cites as an example the por
trayal of women in stories such
as "Cinderella" as "horrible
stepmothers" and "helpless
daughters." Instead, Dickholtz
prefers what he calls non
traditional stories. These are

stories which combine humor
and sadness, according to Dick
holtz.
Many of Dickholtz' stories
are told to him by other
people, especiallv the elderly.
Since they contain a wealth of
information due to their vast
experiences, the elderly
should be encouraged to
interact with the young by tel
ling them of these experi
ences, according to Die kholtz.
"In our culture, it just doesn't
happen," he admitted. Rather,
we tend to segregate the el
derly in rest homes, he con
tinued.
A sort of "blanket organiza
tion" devoted to bringing back
the art of storytelling, the
American Storytelling Re
source Center, is currently
working on a proposal for a
project to encourage such in
teraction, Dickholtz said. He is
helping the organization ob
tain funding for a year-long
project which entails having
young people speak to elderly

people about their experi
ences and memories of nota
ble events in their lives. The
group also hopes to publish
such accounts in a book with
photos. Dickholtz said that
such accounts provide excel
lent bases for stories.
Despite the services of or
ganizations such as the Ameri
can Storytelling Resource Cen
ter, storytelling is somewhat of
a dying art, according to Dick
holtz. "In our culture, you're
told stories and then the parent
or grandparent is replaced by a

about storytelling—a story 'received as
funny one time will be sad another.'

book," he explained. Further
more, Dickholtz said that in
school, "You're deluged with
printed material," and for this
reason, people seem to enjoy
the change of pace that being
told a story offers.

"It'ssurprising. People really
want to hear stories," Dick
holtz claims. Last summer, a
rabbi in Santa Cruz asked him
to tell stories at a bar mitzvah.
In relation to this experience,
Dickholtz said that, "People
wonder a little at first; then
they all go back to a five-year
old's approach and love it."
Dickholtz emphasized that
part of the success of a per
formance lies in his being able
to relate to his audience and
being able to tell them a par
ticular story. "The thing with a

story is the rhythm," he said.
This means knowing when to
pause and when to speed up.
Also, Dickholtz added that the
crowd situation makes each
story different. Calling this the
"magical thing" about storytel-

ling, Dickholtz explained,
"Stories received as tunny one
time will be sad another. Dick
holtz has found students as an
audience are "a little too cool
and don't allow themselves to
be excited.'' He then
suggested perhaps this was
due to the fact that he had
done much of his storytelling
in the classroom situation.
After graduation, Dickholtz
plans on trying his luck in
storytelling in cafes and
cabarets in San Francisco
where he currently has a job
teaching mime and storytelling
to children. If this does not
work out, he said he will travel
and work somewhere else. He
wants an "adventure" and to
"meet people," he said.
In relation to storytelling,
Dickholtz said, "I've found
something I love." It gives him
the ability to do something
which he said, "reaches out
and touches people."
"What I'm doing is very trad
itional. People have been
doing it for thousands of years.

stories which go "right on the

One type of story that Dick

tale which he claims has "a lot
of values I don't agree with."
He cites as an example the por
trayal of women in stories such
as "Cinderella" as "horrible
stepmothers" and "helpless
daughters." Instead, Dickholtz
prefers what he calls non
traditional stories. These are

stories which combine humor
and sadness, according to Dick
holtz.
Many of Dickholtz' stories
are told to him by other
people, especiallv the elderly.
Since they contain a wealth of

experiences, the elderly

A sort of "blanket organiza

the art of storytelling, the
American Storytelling Re

working on a proposal for a

project which entails having
young people speak to elderly

group also hopes to publish
such accounts in a book with

more, Dickholtz said that in
school, "You're deluged with
printed material," and for this
reason, people seem to enjoy
the change of pace that being
told a story offers.

"It'ssurprising. People really
want to hear stories," Dick
holtz claims. Last summer, a
rabbi in Santa Cruz asked him
to tell stories at a bar mitzvah.
In relation to this experience,
Dickholtz said that, "People
wonder a little at first; then
they all go back to a five-year
old's approach and love it."
Dickholtz emphasized that
part of the success of a per
formance lies in his being able
to relate to his audience and
being able to tell them a par
ticular story. "The thing with a

story is the rhythm," he said.
This means knowing when to
pause and when to speed up.
Also, Dickholtz added that the
crowd situation makes each
story different. Calling this the
"magical thing" about storytel-

ling, Dickholtz explained,
"Stories received as tunny one
time will be sad another. Dick
holtz has found students as an
audience are "a little too cool
and don't allow themselves to
be excited.'' He then
suggested perhaps this was
due to the fact that he had
done much of his storytelling
in the classroom situation.
After graduation, Dickholtz
plans on trying his luck in
storytelling in cafes and
cabarets in San Francisco
where he currently has a job
teaching mime and storytelling
to children. If this does not
work out, he said he will travel
and work somewhere else. He
wants an "adventure" and to
"meet people," he said.
In relation to storytelling,
Dickholtz said, "I've found
something I love." It gives him
the ability to do something
which he said, "reaches out
and touches people."
"What I'm doing is very trad
itional. People have been
doing it for thousands of years.
But in the context of Stanford
in the 1980s, it's absolutely off
the wall."
This is how storyteller Joel
Dickholtz, better known as
Joel ben Izzy, described his
work.
A senior majoring in English
with an interdisciplinary em
phasis on creative writing and
storytelling, Dickholtz became
interested in storytelling as a
result of his major. Storytelling
"combines the different things
I've studied," he claimed.
Dickholtz began studying at
Stanford in 1977 and after two
years, stopped-out with "no in
tention of ever returning." For
the next two years, he travelled
in Europe and worked at many
different occupations includ
ing a chef and a mime. Dick
holtz then decided to return
to school at UC Santa Cruz, en
rolling in their creative writing

program. At this time, the crea
tive writing program at UCSC
was not very good, according
to Dickholtz. His instructors
were "boosting" Stanford's
creative writing program.

brought him back to Stanford.
During the summer between
his year at UCSC and the cur
rent academic year, Dickholtz
became interested in storytel
ling. He said that while he was
in the creative writing program
at UCSC, "I was writing piles of
drivel." Also, he saw Robin
Williamson, a local profes
sional storyteller tell Celtic
stories. Williamson was an in
fluence on Dickholtz who said,
"I realized I couldn't tell Celtic
stories so I began with Yid
dish."

Because they "deal in lo
calized ways with universal is
sues," stories can "really cross
cultures," according to Dic
kholtz. Consequently, his re
pertoire includes stories from
many different ethnic and cul

tural backgrounds. He admits
that his favorites are Jewish
stories which go "right on the
border between laughter and
tears."
