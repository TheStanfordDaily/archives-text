# Trustees avoid Hoover protest

### HEATHER MILLAR 
Holding a press conference in front of Hoover Tower, students protesting
alleged political bias in the Hoover Institution attempted to strike a note of
controversy in yesterday's board of trustees meeting. But the board avoided
confrontation by dispersing from Stauffer Auditorium before the media
could approach trustees for comment.
Stanford Students for Academic Truth, the group pushing for an inquiry
into Hoover, had wanted to place discussion of the Hoover issue and the
recent petitions calling for inquiry on the agenda for this month's trustee
meeting. But the April 20 deadline had passed before students brought up
the suggestion, and the issue was not placed on the agenda.
As an alternative, the group tried to distribute the copies of the student
petitions to board members. These efforts failed; the petition packets never
reached members of the board.
The board did discuss the Hoover issue informally during University
President Donald Kennedy's report, according to Trustee Edward Ginzton,
but the board issued no specific statement.
"The president suggested that there ought to be a better understanding of
various subjects between the University and the Hoover Institution. The
board agreed with him," said Ginzton. Trustee action on the Hoover issue, if
any, has been deferred to the June 10 meeting of the board.
In an action unrelated to the recent Hoover controversy, the trustees also
approved various appointments to the Hoover Institution Board of Over
seers, the Hoover analog to the University board of trustees.
Independent of the Hoover issue, much of the activity at this month's
meeting focused on the various reports presented to the board for educa
tion rather than action.
The most voluminous of these was the Facilities Plan and Funding Forecast
1983 to 1986, a document outlining future construction which is presented
annually to the board.
According to the report, the present level of campus construction is likely
to continue. The University expects to generate $60 million for construction
in the next three years.
"That is a lot of money, but the needs are greater than that," said Linda
Weisberg, assistant provost of the Office of Management and Budget which
produced the report. "I don't see any decrease in funding, but I do see some
patterns emerging. The University will have to turn to redevelopment rather
than expansion in the future. We're rapidly losing sites near the central
campus so we are forced into redevelopment."
