## Unconceited Grabb undefeated at No. 6 
### BETH KLEID 
Freshman tennis player Jim
Grabb has been inconspicuous in
compiling his perfect 22-0 record
this season. Few know that Grabb,
who plays No. 6 singles and teams
with junior team captain Mark
McKeen at No. 2 doubles, has not
lost a single competitive match so
far this year.
And Grabb would have it no
other way.
"The team's record, not my
personal record, is what is really
important," Grabb said. "We had
19 straight wins and we're 20-1 —
now that's pretty good."
Grabb is modest about his suc
cess as a Card netter. "Other guys
on the team have pretty amazing
records, too. And I'm only No. 6."
But Grabb's consistent record
cannot be ignored.
The freshman hails from Tuc
son, Ariz., where he played the
No. 1 spot on the tennis team at
Tucson High School. Grabb
graduated from Tucson's Saguaro
High School, but did not play ten
nis for the school.
Grabb began his tennis career
at the tender age of eight. "My
dad and my brothers played ten
nis, and I got interested in it by
watching them."
Grabb credits his father for
helping him with tennis. His
father coached him since he
started playingthe game. "I had to
work hard and practice a lot. Ten
nis did not just come easily for
me."
When Grabb did slack off in
practicing tennis, his game felt it.
"I began to get tired of tennis, and
between the ages of 13 and 16 I
didn't play or practice enough.
Relative to the others in the tennis
world, my game went down in a
hurry."
At the age of 16, Grabb decided
to get serious about tennis again.
His attitude of dedication to the
sport led to a No. 1 junior ranking

in the Southwest Boys 18's, a No.
19 ranking in the National Boy's
18's singles division . . . and now
to his perfect record on the tennis
team here.
Grabb said that he is pleased
with the way things are going this
season. "It is really exciting for me
to get the chance to play here. My
tennis has improved a lot this sea
son — and that's really all you can
ask for," he said.
"Coach Gould has been excel
lent. He has good repoire with
everyone on the team, and it is a
lot more fun to work with some
one who you get along with."
Grabb noticed a sense of cam
raderie among his Card team
mates that is rare in a sport like
tennis where players are vying for
positions on the ladder.
So Grabb likes the team, the
coach and their successful record
— but it is not all over yet. "I feel
that there is a lot more we can do
when we go back to the NCAA's in
Athens, Ga., next week.
"Our team has depth, and if we
play well we can compete with all
of the tough schools."
The Cardinal began the season
rated seventh nationally, but will
enter the NCAAs, which begin
Saturday, seeded second after
upset wins over USC, UCLA and
Pepperdine.
"We all knew that we had po
tential; it just a matter of
seeing how much we could im
prove, and how far we could go."
For Grabb, adjusting to life on
the Farm has not been too dif
ficult. He is enjoying his tennis,
his studies and his social life. "My
academics haven't suffered too
much because of my tennis."
Obviously, Grabb does devote
much time to tennis. Practice is
held throughout the year, and at
times can last up to four hours a
day. He said that he feels he is
gaining, rather than missing out

on things because of tennis. He
mentioned travel and meeting
people as definite plusses to the
sport.
Grabb enjoys tennis so much
that pressure in a match situation
does not even bother him. "I
don't think about pressure too
much. I think about playing the
point, rather than how important
the point is — or how much I will
be chastised if I don't win it."
The home match against UCLA
was Grabb's favorite this season.
"All the matches were great, but
the UCLA match was the most ex

citing because it was so close and
we won at the end."
As for the future, Grabb wants
to continue playing for Stanford,
and if he has the chance to go
further he will "definitely give it a
whirl." In regard to academic
goals he plans to major in interna
tional relations.
Tennis kept Grabb from playing
other organized sports when he
was growing up, but he said that
he feels he has benefited from his
devotion to the sport. "I am so
glad that I chose to stick with ten
nis."
