Spurs even series at 1-1
Inglewood — George Gervin scored 22
of his 32 points in the second half last
night, leading the San Antonio Spurs to a
122-113 victory over the Los Angeles
Lakers to deadlock the National Basket
ball Association Western Confernce
Championship series at 1-1.
The best-of-seven series now moves to
San Antonio for the third and fourth

games, Friday night and Sunday after
noon.
Gervin was sensational in the second
half despite picking up his fourth foul af
ter only 3:27 of the third period. He went
on to score 16 points in the quarter, mak
ing all seven of his field goal attempts and
a pair of free throws.
San Antonio center Artis Gilmore, held
to only seven points and six rebounds in
the series opener won by the Lakers
119-107, had 27 points and 20 rebounds in
the second game.
Earvin "Magic" Johnson and Norm Nix
on led the Lakers with 28 points apiece.
Johnson also grabbed a team-leading 12
rebounds.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who scored 30
points in Game 1, was held to 19 in the
second game, all but six of them in the
first half.

The Lakers closed to 97-89 entering the
final quarter and got as close as one point
twice. San Antonio led 103-102 midway
through the quarter before outscoring
Los Angeles 12-4 to take a nine-point
lead. The Lakers couidn't get closer than
six points after that.
Islanders blank Oilers
Edmonton, Alberta — Duane Sutter
scored the decisive goal and the New
York Islanders, backed by the brilliant
goaltending of Billy Smith, threw a de
fensive blanket over the high-scoring Ed
monton Oilers for a 2-0 victory last night
in the opener of the Stanley Cup finals.
It was an impressive effort by the three
time National Hockey League champions,
who played without their top gun, Mike
Bossy, who was sidelined with severe
tonsillitis. The Oilers, who had not been

shut out since March 12, 1981, when
Smith blanked them 5-0 here, will try to
come back tomorrow night in Came 2.
SF's win streak halted at 6
