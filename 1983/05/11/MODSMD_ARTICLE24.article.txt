# Drell urges deterrence policy
## 
### RANDY BROBERG Staff writer 
Although he admitted that deterrence was a "horrible
philosophy to live by," Sidney Drell, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, told about 50
attentive listeners that "deterrence, threatening the
slaughter of civilian populations, is the only game in
town."
At the Bechtel International Center's Tuesday
Luncheon Series yesterday, Drell discussed the dilemma
posed to scientists by nuclear weapons.
Drell, a former consultant for the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, suggested that deterrence is
morally unacceptable in the long run but is good in the
short term because it provides time to negotiate disar
mament.
Addressing a question concerning the current admin
istration's views on the "winnability of nuclear war,"
Drell said he does not think the administration really
believes a nuclear war is winnable but that their concept
of deterrence is different than his. According to Drell,
deterrence means the possession of "a secure retaliat
ory force," not the ability to threaten each other's
weapons. "We need to make a clear choice between
deterrence and counterforce (the ability to attack the
Soviet's hardened missile sites after a Soviet surprise
attack)," Drell said.
He repeatedly attacked President Reagan's recent
speech calling for expanded research for the develop
ment of a missile defense system. "Reagan's 'Star Wars'

speech," Drell said, was a vision of the day when the
United States could get out "from under the sword of
Damocles" through defensive technology.
"If I thought there was an acceptable defense, then I
would have difficulty calling for us to rely on deter
rence," Drell reminded his listeners.
But he pointed out that a defensive system would have
to be so close to perfect to be effective that the advan
tage would remain with the offensive forces. "Defense
can't be guaged by shooting down one in 10 planes, it
has to shoot down 100 out of 100, and that achievement
is beyond my technological horizon anyway," Drell said.
The value of the "Star Wars" proposal as a bargaining
chip was not something he as a scientist was qualified to
speak about, Drell said. But he argued that the way to
achieve the president's vision was at the bargaining ta
ble, through the arms control process. The real defen
sive strategy, according to Drell, is cooperatively reduc
ing the offensive capabilities of the United States and the
USSR.
Drell, a participant in the study of the future of the
SLAC-SSRL relationship, said he would not comment on
the proposed nuclear weapons-related research at SSRL.
"It is an inopportune time for me to comment."
Although he expressed a note of optimism at the new
"arms control constituency" in this country, he began
his speech on a pessimistic note by saying, "Never be
fore has the gulf in expertise been so great between the
scientist and the political leaders who must make the
decisions (concerning nuclear weapons)."
