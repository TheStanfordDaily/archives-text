# New Wave elf to be Chief
## 
### 
Wearing a turquoise, micro
mini with gold trim, chain
smoking and Tab®-chugging, she
copy-edits a story on cancer. This
is an editor?
Kristen "Scoop" Christopher,
the Daily's first New Wave news
editor, will indeed be The Chief
come fall.
According to a reliable source,
the short, bald and totally clueless
former science editor may be the
third fall quarter woman editor
since the war years.
But she will be the first editor of
the Daily to have a father who is
on the board of trustees, who
served as undersecretary of state
and who negotiated the release of
the hostages in Iran.
But the former senior staff
writer denies claims that Dean
Fred let in because of her famous
father.
Christopher, of Valley Girl des
cent, is expected to continue to
dress in bright colors, polka dot
stocking and "elf" shoes when
she assumes duties as The Chief
this fall. But only time will tell
whether she will really be able to
provide Henry's at all happy
hours.
Christopher, who lives by the
golden rule "use it if the surgeon
general had decided it's hazard
ous to your health," goes through

dozens of quarter rolls to pur
chase her favorite carcinogenic
beverage, Tab r *. This and her
other favorite carcinogen, cigaret
tes, have contributed to her bald
ness, her shortness and her low
voice. Every once in a while, she
goes on a fro-yo only diet in hopes
that her hair will grow back.
Staff members have already ex
pressed fears that Christopher
might plunge from a balcony at
the next staff banquet. Although
she is not usually a "push-over,"
the Daily scheduled the spring
banquet at a one-story restaurant
just in case.
Our favorite WASP, fondly
called Road Trip by her first-year
fans, plans to leave the Los
Angeles Times in August to re
vamp the Daily office and install a
cigarette machine.
Poor Kristen is still waiting for
University President Donald Ken
nedy to make her omelettes. But
maybe he's still wondering why
the undersecretary of state's car
was parked in front of his office.
The renowned partier, who
claims to have many friends out
side of the Daily office, still plans
to stick to strict deadlines. "Am I
ever late?" she asks.
Time will tell if her weird shoes
are on the right feet.
