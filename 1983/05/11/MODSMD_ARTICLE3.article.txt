# Mickey Mouse, sunshine grace clock tower dedication
## 
### MARC PEYSER 
Donned with a red ribbon, a
crowd of on-lookers and a three
foot tall Mickey Mouse, Stan
ford's just-completed clock tower
was officially presented to the
University by William Kimball, the
donor and president of the Uni
versity board of trustees.
In the hope that it "will inspire
other non-academic gifts," Kim
ball and University President
Donald Kennedy presided at the
twenty-five minute ceremony,
both reminiscing about the
$250,000 tower's past and ex
pounding on hopes for its future.
"I hope it will be an opportunity
for meeting, posing, gathering
and conversing," said Kennedy,
who, before yielding the stage,
called the 45-foot tower "the
paradigm for incremental giving
to Stanford."
Kimball, accompanied by wife
Collie as well as several University
dignitaries, mused on his past
memories of the original tower,
torn down in 1967 to expand the
area behind Memorial Church.
There was one recent addition
to the original bell and inner
workings, however, in the shape
of a three-foot tall Mickey Mouse,
placed on the eastern face. The
mouse had a hammer and coffin,
the insignia of the Chaparral
humor magazine, on its belly.
But Chaparral editor Trey Ellis
denied that it was an "official"
Chaparral prank.
"We were framed. Everytime
something happens on this cam
pus, we get blamed for it," Ellis
said. "Officially, it not a Chaparral
thing. But if you find out who did
it, we'll hire them."
Kimball said with a laugh,
"leave Mickey there," when he
saw it.
Its four bells-the largest is four
feet high and weighs one tonâ€”
will be heard every quarter hour
from Ba.m. through 7:45 p.m. The
bells' notes are best known as the
Big Ben bells atop the British Parli
ament.
