Reagan reconsiders position on arms
Washington — President Reagan met with his national se
curity advisers yesterday to consider shifting the American
position in arms negotiations with the Soviet Union, while
the president also pressed his case with Congress for deploy
ment of the new MX missile.
An administration official said yesterday's meeting with
advisers "was not a decision-making session," but added that
by the time talks with the Soviet Union are resumed, the trea
ty that Reagan proposed a year ago may be modified.
The official, who declined to be quoted by name, said Rea
gan did not choose among the options presented to him for
compromising differences with the Soviet Union — and also
with Congress.
But he said the discussion was aimed at loosening restric

tions on the number of long-range missiles both sides can re
tain and to promote a shift from multi-warhead to single
warhead rockets.
"We are going to move in the direction of the Scowcroft
Commission report," said the official. He stressed that the
U.S. arms control effort would continue to seek substantial
reductions in strategic nuclear warheads.
The commission, headed by Brent Scowcroft, a former na
tional security adviser, called for deployment of 100 new MX
missiles, each with 10 warheads, as an interim step during the
development of a smaller, single-warhead missile.
The modifications considered at the White House and
earlier by an interagency panel would adopt the smaller mis
sile as a U.S. and Soviet goal while also lifting or even remov
ing the ceiling Reagan sought to impose on larger missiles on
both sides.

To try to gain Congressional support for the MX, the White
House also scheduled further negotiations yesterday with a
group of moderate Democrats and Republicans
Funds approved for Salvadoran army
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
yesterday unanimously approved $20 million more for train
ing the embattled Salvadoran army this year, but rejected an
additional $60 million that President Reagan had requested.
While the amount approved fell short of what the presi
dent had asked for, William Schneider, undersecretary of
state for security assistance, commended the committee "for
its progress" in granting the additional money.
But afterwards Schneider said the rejection of the
president's full request increases the risk that U.S.
support will not be enough for the Salvadoran gov
ernment to succeed in its war with leftist guerrillas.
If accepted by the full Senate and the House, the
$20 million would boost U.S. military aid to El Salvador
this year to $76.3 million. Reagan had sought a total of
$136.3 million for the Salvadoran army in its war with
leftist guerrillas.
The Senate committee also approved $76.3 million
in military aid to El Salvador for fiscal 1984, which starts
Oct. 1. Reagan had requested $86.3 million in military
aid for fiscal 1984.
The committee's vote also raised the non-military
aid to El Salvador by $25 million to $140 million this
year and set the amount for fiscal 1984 at $120 million.
The compromise proposal, sponsored by Sen. Nan
cy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) was approved on a 17-0 vote
after the committee had rejected, 11-6, an amend
ment by Sen. Richard Lugar (R-lnd.) to grant the pres
ident the full amounts he had requested.
PLO, Syria demand concessions
Damascus, Syria — The Palestine Liberation Or
ganization and Syria will not accept a U.S.-mediated
draft agreement for removing foreign forces from
Lebanon without settling issues so complex they
could take months to resolve.
Syrian determination to hold out for concessions
has been bolstered by the Soviet Union, which
Western diplomats say has replenished Syria's military
equipment destroyed by the Israelis during last sum
mer's fighting.
The Soviets also have increased their presence in
Syria since Israel invaded Lebanon last June 6 to de
stroy PLO guerrilla bases.
"Given certain circumstances, yes, I feel they (the
Syrians) will withdraw," said one European diplomat
who spoke on condition he not be identified. "But
they feel the present circumstances, which means the
draft agreement, conveys to Israel in the Syrian view
non-merited advantages."
The diplomat said if the Syrians agree to withdraw,
"it will only be at the end of a long process." The Syr
ians are in Lebanon under an Arab League mandate to
police the armistice that halted the 1975-76 civil war.
Syria has not detailed conditions for pulling out its
estimated 38,000 troops since Secretary of State
George Shultz won tentative agreement from Israel
for removing its 25,000 soldiers. But Israel has said it
will remove Israeli forces only when Syria and the PLO
start withdrawing.
However, Syria's ruling Baath Party said the Syrians
would leave "as soon as Lebanon regains its freedom
and expels the (Israeli) invaders from its territory."
Bombings, gunmen plague Beirut
Two-thousand Palestinian guerrillas may have in
filtrated eastern Lebanon from Syria by truck in recent
weeks, possibly in anticipation of renewed fighting
with Israel, Western diplomats in Damascus said yes
terday.
In Beirut, two bombs exploded last night, wound
ing six people and damaging buildings, police said.
The motives for the bombings were not known.
Israel's military command in Tel Aviv reported un
identified gunmen wounded an Israeli soldier in Leb
anon's central mountains, where Christian and Syr
ian-backed Druse militias battled last week. The com
mand said Israeli soldiers returned the fire and
pursued the attackers.

The Damascus-based diplomats, who declined to
be identified, said they had reports of units from the
Syrian-backed Palestine Liberation Army moving
over the border at night into the Bekaa Valley. Thev
said the infiltrators included groups evacuated last
summer from west Beirut in the face of Israel's in
vasion army.
The guerrillas apparently were reinforcing the
Palestine Liberation Organization's Lebanon force
estimated at about 10,000 fighters, the diplomats said
Israel radio quoted Israeli sources as confirming the
infiltration.
Moderates want tax increases
Washington — Five GOP moderates in the Senate,
refusing to embrace a budget plan backed by the par
ty leadership, are seeking $70 billion in tax increases
over three years and slight additional reductions in
President Reagan's defense buildup, sources said
Monday.
These sources, who spoke on condition they not be
identified by name, said the five have agreed not to
press for additional spending on domestic programs
beyond what the Budget Committee and full Senate
already have agreed to.
In all, the outline developed by thefiveand relayed
to Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), chairman of the Sen
ate Budget Committee, would cut deficits below the
level in a plan being pushed by Domenici and GOP
Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee.
The five moderates weighed in with their proposals
as Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd, trying to
coax Baker and Domenici into bipartisan negotiations
on a 1984 budget, conceded it was "unreasonable to
hope" Democrats can force repeal of this year's
scheduled 10 percent personal income tax cut.
Byrd said Democrats still intend to try to force a cap
on this year's tax cut, but added that President Reagan
enjoys enough support in Congress to sustain his cer
tain veto of a repeal bill.
Anti-tampering law passed
Washington — Prompted by last year's Tylenol
cyanide deaths, both housesof Congress passed legis
lation Monday making it a federal crime to tamper
with consumer products.
The bill was approved in a 292-0 vote in the House.
The Senate passed its version later in the day in a
unanimous voice vote.
The House and Senate now will try to resolve dif
ferences between the two measures, which set tough
new penalties for people convicted of tampering with
consumer products.
Both measures provide a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment and a $100,000 fine if serious injury or
death results from tampering with a consumer prod
uct.
Stocks climb higher
The stock market edged higher yesterday, toppling
more records. But some analysts said the market's
momentum was beginning to slow.
The Dow jones average of 30 industrials, down 4.36
Monday, rose 1.45 to 1229.68. The blue-chip average,
which had been up 6 points earlier in the day, finished
below the 1232.59 record close of last Friday.

Reagan reconsiders position on arms
Washington — President Reagan met with his national se
curity advisers yesterday to consider shifting the American
position in arms negotiations with the Soviet Union, while
the president also pressed his case with Congress for deploy
ment of the new MX missile.
An administration official said yesterday's meeting with
advisers "was not a decision-making session," but added that
by the time talks with the Soviet Union are resumed, the trea
ty that Reagan proposed a year ago may be modified.
The official, who declined to be quoted by name, said Rea
gan did not choose among the options presented to him for
compromising differences with the Soviet Union — and also
with Congress.
But he said the discussion was aimed at loosening restric

tions on the number of long-range missiles both sides can re
tain and to promote a shift from multi-warhead to single
warhead rockets.
"We are going to move in the direction of the Scowcroft
Commission report," said the official. He stressed that the
U.S. arms control effort would continue to seek substantial
reductions in strategic nuclear warheads.
The commission, headed by Brent Scowcroft, a former na
tional security adviser, called for deployment of 100 new MX
missiles, each with 10 warheads, as an interim step during the
development of a smaller, single-warhead missile.
The modifications considered at the White House and
earlier by an interagency panel would adopt the smaller mis
sile as a U.S. and Soviet goal while also lifting or even remov
ing the ceiling Reagan sought to impose on larger missiles on
both sides.

To try to gain Congressional support for the MX, the White
House also scheduled further negotiations yesterday with a
group of moderate Democrats and Republicans
Funds approved for Salvadoran army
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
yesterday unanimously approved $20 million more for train
ing the embattled Salvadoran army this year, but rejected an
additional $60 million that President Reagan had requested.
While the amount approved fell short of what the presi
dent had asked for, William Schneider, undersecretary of
state for security assistance, commended the committee "for
its progress" in granting the additional money.
But afterwards Schneider said the rejection of the
president's full request increases the risk that U.S.
support will not be enough for the Salvadoran gov
ernment to succeed in its war with leftist guerrillas.
If accepted by the full Senate and the House, the
$20 million would boost U.S. military aid to El Salvador
this year to $76.3 million. Reagan had sought a total of
$136.3 million for the Salvadoran army in its war with
leftist guerrillas.
The Senate committee also approved $76.3 million
in military aid to El Salvador for fiscal 1984, which starts
Oct. 1. Reagan had requested $86.3 million in military
aid for fiscal 1984.
The committee's vote also raised the non-military
aid to El Salvador by $25 million to $140 million this
year and set the amount for fiscal 1984 at $120 million.
The compromise proposal, sponsored by Sen. Nan
cy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) was approved on a 17-0 vote
after the committee had rejected, 11-6, an amend
ment by Sen. Richard Lugar (R-lnd.) to grant the pres
ident the full amounts he had requested.
PLO, Syria demand concessions
Damascus, Syria — The Palestine Liberation Or
ganization and Syria will not accept a U.S.-mediated
draft agreement for removing foreign forces from
Lebanon without settling issues so complex they
could take months to resolve.
Syrian determination to hold out for concessions
has been bolstered by the Soviet Union, which
Western diplomats say has replenished Syria's military
equipment destroyed by the Israelis during last sum
mer's fighting.
The Soviets also have increased their presence in
Syria since Israel invaded Lebanon last June 6 to de
stroy PLO guerrilla bases.
"Given certain circumstances, yes, I feel they (the
Syrians) will withdraw," said one European diplomat
who spoke on condition he not be identified. "But
they feel the present circumstances, which means the
draft agreement, conveys to Israel in the Syrian view
non-merited advantages."
The diplomat said if the Syrians agree to withdraw,
"it will only be at the end of a long process." The Syr
ians are in Lebanon under an Arab League mandate to
police the armistice that halted the 1975-76 civil war.
Syria has not detailed conditions for pulling out its
estimated 38,000 troops since Secretary of State
George Shultz won tentative agreement from Israel
for removing its 25,000 soldiers. But Israel has said it
will remove Israeli forces only when Syria and the PLO
start withdrawing.
However, Syria's ruling Baath Party said the Syrians
would leave "as soon as Lebanon regains its freedom
and expels the (Israeli) invaders from its territory."
Bombings, gunmen plague Beirut
Two-thousand Palestinian guerrillas may have in
filtrated eastern Lebanon from Syria by truck in recent
weeks, possibly in anticipation of renewed fighting
with Israel, Western diplomats in Damascus said yes
terday.
In Beirut, two bombs exploded last night, wound
ing six people and damaging buildings, police said.
The motives for the bombings were not known.
Israel's military command in Tel Aviv reported un
identified gunmen wounded an Israeli soldier in Leb
anon's central mountains, where Christian and Syr
ian-backed Druse militias battled last week. The com
mand said Israeli soldiers returned the fire and
pursued the attackers.

The Damascus-based diplomats, who declined to
be identified, said they had reports of units from the
Syrian-backed Palestine Liberation Army moving
over the border at night into the Bekaa Valley. Thev
said the infiltrators included groups evacuated last
summer from west Beirut in the face of Israel's in
vasion army.
The guerrillas apparently were reinforcing the
Palestine Liberation Organization's Lebanon force
estimated at about 10,000 fighters, the diplomats said
Israel radio quoted Israeli sources as confirming the
infiltration.
Moderates want tax increases
Washington — Five GOP moderates in the Senate,
refusing to embrace a budget plan backed by the par
ty leadership, are seeking $70 billion in tax increases
over three years and slight additional reductions in
President Reagan's defense buildup, sources said
Monday.
These sources, who spoke on condition they not be
identified by name, said the five have agreed not to
press for additional spending on domestic programs
beyond what the Budget Committee and full Senate
already have agreed to.

draft agreement, conveys to Israel in the Syrian view
non-merited advantages."
The diplomat said if the Syrians agree to withdraw,
"it will only be at the end of a long process." The Syr
ians are in Lebanon under an Arab League mandate to
police the armistice that halted the 1975-76 civil war.
Syria has not detailed conditions for pulling out its
estimated 38,000 troops since Secretary of State
George Shultz won tentative agreement from Israel
for removing its 25,000 soldiers. But Israel has said it
will remove Israeli forces only when Syria and the PLO
start withdrawing.
However, Syria's ruling Baath Party said the Syrians
would leave "as soon as Lebanon regains its freedom
and expels the (Israeli) invaders from its territory."
Bombings, gunmen plague Beirut
Two-thousand Palestinian guerrillas may have in
filtrated eastern Lebanon from Syria by truck in recent
weeks, possibly in anticipation of renewed fighting
with Israel, Western diplomats in Damascus said yes
terday.
In Beirut, two bombs exploded last night, wound
ing six people and damaging buildings, police said.
The motives for the bombings were not known.
Israel's military command in Tel Aviv reported un
identified gunmen wounded an Israeli soldier in Leb
anon's central mountains, where Christian and Syr
ian-backed Druse militias battled last week. The com
mand said Israeli soldiers returned the fire and
pursued the attackers.

The Damascus-based diplomats, who declined to
be identified, said they had reports of units from the
Syrian-backed Palestine Liberation Army moving
over the border at night into the Bekaa Valley. Thev
said the infiltrators included groups evacuated last
summer from west Beirut in the face of Israel's in
vasion army.
The guerrillas apparently were reinforcing the
Palestine Liberation Organization's Lebanon force
estimated at about 10,000 fighters, the diplomats said
Israel radio quoted Israeli sources as confirming the
infiltration.
Moderates want tax increases
Washington — Five GOP moderates in the Senate,
refusing to embrace a budget plan backed by the par
ty leadership, are seeking $70 billion in tax increases
over three years and slight additional reductions in
President Reagan's defense buildup, sources said
Monday.
These sources, who spoke on condition they not be
identified by name, said the five have agreed not to
press for additional spending on domestic programs
beyond what the Budget Committee and full Senate
already have agreed to.
In all, the outline developed by thefiveand relayed
to Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), chairman of the Sen
ate Budget Committee, would cut deficits below the
level in a plan being pushed by Domenici and GOP
Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee.
The five moderates weighed in with their proposals
as Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd, trying to
coax Baker and Domenici into bipartisan negotiations
on a 1984 budget, conceded it was "unreasonable to
hope" Democrats can force repeal of this year's
scheduled 10 percent personal income tax cut.
Byrd said Democrats still intend to try to force a cap
on this year's tax cut, but added that President Reagan
enjoys enough support in Congress to sustain his cer
tain veto of a repeal bill.
Anti-tampering law passed
Washington — Prompted by last year's Tylenol
cyanide deaths, both housesof Congress passed legis
lation Monday making it a federal crime to tamper
with consumer products.
The bill was approved in a 292-0 vote in the House.
The Senate passed its version later in the day in a
unanimous voice vote.
The House and Senate now will try to resolve dif
ferences between the two measures, which set tough
new penalties for people convicted of tampering with
consumer products.
Both measures provide a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment and a $100,000 fine if serious injury or
death results from tampering with a consumer prod
uct.
