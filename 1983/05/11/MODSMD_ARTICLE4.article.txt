Reagan reconsiders position on arms
Washington — President Reagan met with his national se
curity advisers yesterday to consider shifting the American
position in arms negotiations with the Soviet Union, while
the president also pressed his case with Congress for deploy
ment of the new MX missile.
An administration official said yesterday's meeting with
advisers "was not a decision-making session," but added that
by the time talks with the Soviet Union are resumed, the trea
ty that Reagan proposed a year ago may be modified.
The official, who declined to be quoted by name, said Rea
gan did not choose among the options presented to him for
compromising differences with the Soviet Union — and also
with Congress.
But he said the discussion was aimed at loosening restric

tions on the number of long-range missiles both sides can re
tain and to promote a shift from multi-warhead to single
warhead rockets.
"We are going to move in the direction of the Scowcroft
Commission report," said the official. He stressed that the
U.S. arms control effort would continue to seek substantial
reductions in strategic nuclear warheads.
The commission, headed by Brent Scowcroft, a former na
tional security adviser, called for deployment of 100 new MX
missiles, each with 10 warheads, as an interim step during the
development of a smaller, single-warhead missile.
The modifications considered at the White House and
earlier by an interagency panel would adopt the smaller mis
sile as a U.S. and Soviet goal while also lifting or even remov
ing the ceiling Reagan sought to impose on larger missiles on
both sides.

To try to gain Congressional support for the MX, the White
House also scheduled further negotiations yesterday with a
group of moderate Democrats and Republicans
Funds approved for Salvadoran army
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
yesterday unanimously approved $20 million more for train
ing the embattled Salvadoran army this year, but rejected an
additional $60 million that President Reagan had requested.
While the amount approved fell short of what the presi
dent had asked for, William Schneider, undersecretary of
state for security assistance, commended the committee "for
its progress" in granting the additional money.
