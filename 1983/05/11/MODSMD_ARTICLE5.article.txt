# University libraries rank fifth

### DAN NEWELL 
The Stanford University Libraries
ranked fifth overall in a recent na
tional study completed by the Asso
ciation of Research Libraries.
Harvard, UC-Berkeley, UCLA,
Vale, Stanford, University of To
ronto, University of Texas, University
of Michigan, University of Illinois
and Columbia were the top 10 uni
versity library systems rated by the
association.
Dale Canelas, associate director of
public services, said, "I think it's a
fair ranking and is reflective of the
concern the University has of its li
braries."
Joe Jezukewicz, assistant director
for University Libraries, said, "It's
wonderful. The University is in good
shape to support research at Stan
ford." He also expresses skepticism
at the value of trying to overtake
other universities in the study.
"When you're supporting all of the
needs of the library community,
does it matter whether you are
ranked first or 10th? Harvard's so far
out in front because they've been at
it so long." He added, "UCLA and
Berkeley are very well endowed for
public universities."
The study presented data com
piled from 113 research libraries
across the nation during the 1981-82
academic year. It used a weighted
scale based on the number of vol
umes held and added, microform
holdings, the number of current se
rials, expenditures for materials, ex
penditures for binding, total salaries,
operating expenditures, the number
of professional staff members and
nonprofessional staff members.
Dave Weber, director of libraries,
said, "The statistics of size of a library
are a very poor measure of a library's
ability as a research tool. What this
kind of index does not do is to meas
ure the effectiveness of a library."
While the statistics provided "in
dications of strength and vitality in a
research library," he said they were
not of "overwhelming importance."
Major problems facing the library
today center mainly on the difficul
ties of managing such a large
storehouse of knowledge and on fi
nancial considerations.
Projected rates of collection
growth also show that several librar
ies will soon run out of spce to house
books, according to Weber. Physics,
Mathematics, Computer Science,
Education and the Art branch librar
ies are currently projected to run out
of space in five to 10 years.
"Stanford has been very fortunate
in housing libraries in good or excel
lent facilities," Weber said. But sev
eral of the branch libraries were in
poor condition, specifically the
Hopkins Marine Institute Library and
the Chemistry and Chemical En
gineering Library.
