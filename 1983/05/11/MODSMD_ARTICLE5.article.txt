# University libraries rank fifth

### DAN NEWELL 
The Stanford University Libraries
ranked fifth overall in a recent na
tional study completed by the Asso
ciation of Research Libraries.
Harvard, UC-Berkeley, UCLA,
Vale, Stanford, University of To
ronto, University of Texas, University
of Michigan, University of Illinois
and Columbia were the top 10 uni
versity library systems rated by the
association.
Dale Canelas, associate director of
public services, said, "I think it's a
fair ranking and is reflective of the
concern the University has of its li
braries."
Joe Jezukewicz, assistant director
for University Libraries, said, "It's
wonderful. The University is in good
shape to support research at Stan
ford." He also expresses skepticism
at the value of trying to overtake
other universities in the study.
"When you're supporting all of the
needs of the library community,
does it matter whether you are
ranked first or 10th? Harvard's so far
out in front because they've been at
it so long." He added, "UCLA and
Berkeley are very well endowed for
public universities."
The study presented data com
piled from 113 research libraries
across the nation during the 1981-82
academic year. It used a weighted
scale based on the number of vol
umes held and added, microform
holdings, the number of current se
rials, expenditures for materials, ex
penditures for binding, total salaries,
operating expenditures, the number
of professional staff members and
nonprofessional staff members.
Dave Weber, director of libraries,
said, "The statistics of size of a library
are a very poor measure of a library's
ability as a research tool. What this
kind of index does not do is to meas
ure the effectiveness of a library."
While the statistics provided "in
dications of strength and vitality in a
research library," he said they were
not of "overwhelming importance."
Major problems facing the library
today center mainly on the difficul
ties of managing such a large
storehouse of knowledge and on fi
nancial considerations.
Projected rates of collection
growth also show that several librar
ies will soon run out of spce to house
books, according to Weber. Physics,
Mathematics, Computer Science,
Education and the Art branch librar
ies are currently projected to run out
of space in five to 10 years.
"Stanford has been very fortunate
in housing libraries in good or excel
lent facilities," Weber said. But sev
eral of the branch libraries were in
poor condition, specifically the
Hopkins Marine Institute Library and
the Chemistry and Chemical En
gineering Library.
Long-term library problems in
clude fundraising, difficulties in at
tracting staff to the area, greater di
versification in information formats
and preservation of the collections,
according to administrators.
While the Music Library in Braun
Music Center will help alleviate a
long-term space problem, the Li
brary Development Office has yet to
solicit donations from private
donators to reimburse funds ad
vanced from the University's operat
ing budget. In addition, more than $1
million must still be raised to finish
reimbursing the University for con
struction costs of Green Library.
As with most departments, the li

braries have difficulty attracting top
rate staff because the Palo Alto area is
so expensive to live in, Weber said.
According to the study, higher
salaries here relative to most other
universities help compensate for the
high cost of living.
Preservation of the library collec
tions is becoming an increasingly
important problem with as much as
25 percent of the University's collec
tions rated in very poor condition,
according to Weber.
Some departments have texts that
are 100 to 200 years old and natural
decay has left many of them torn and
falling apart.
"Great efforts and expense went
into acquiring them (the Stanford
collections) and it behooves our
generation to renew efforts to pre
serve these collections," Weber
said.
According to Jezukewicz, plans for

improving the library system focus
on the on-line catalog system due to
begin operation in Meyer Library this
fall.
Dale Canelas, associate director of
public services, said, "Most effort
will go into improving services al
ready given, such as making
database searches more accessible."
Weber said, "It is our hope that
with some increase in computer re
sources we can improve library effec
tiveness without unduly increasing
expenditures."
Plans also include allocating funds
to improve and standardize database
access. Currently, the library has no
method of finding all relevant mate
rials on a given topic throughout the
library system because materials
listed in one library are not always
referenced in the other branch li
brary databases, according to

Canelas.
Research librarians are needed to
search the entire system because of
widely varying methods of retrieving
information that would take an indi
vidual researcher too much time to
learn. A standardized system would
allow searches from any library to be
completed and such a simplified sys
tem would allow researchers to per
form their own searches and cut
down on staffing costs.
For 1982-83 the University libraries
were budgeted $20.9 million.
Jezukewicz said, "The Stanford li
braries are very well endowed. We
receive over 10 percent of the Uni
versity's operating budget. The Uni
versity is strongly committed to its
library system. They might cut your
grass a little less often, but they're
not going to cut down on the
books," he said.
