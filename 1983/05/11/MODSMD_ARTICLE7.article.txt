# Hoover fellow discusses oppressive governments
## 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
Hoover Senior Fellow Sidney
Hook yesterday expressed support
for the distinction between au
thoritarian and totalitarian regimes
popularized by U.S. Ambassador to
the United Nations Jeanne Kirkpat
rick.
In his speech, part of the "Tower
Talks" series held each month at the
Hoover Institution, Hook said, "Al
though Kirkpatrick's distinction is
valid, it should be incorporated
under the general principle that
when we have to make a difficult
choice, we should choose the lesser
of two evils."
In a question and answer session
after his speech, Hook said the Re
agan administration's policy of inter
vention in El Salvador is justified be
cause it is attempting to prevent the
intervention of Nicaragua, Cuba and
the Soviet Union there.
Because of last year's elections in
El Salvador, which Hook praised as
"free elections," he did not classify,
that nation's government as au
thoritarian. But he said the guerrillas
fighting against El Salvador's gov
ernment should be feared as being
"totalitarian" because he believes
they are receiving aid from the Soviet
Union and Cuba—two governments
he classifies as totalitarian.
Rejecting the leftist guerrillas' ex
planation that fear of reprisals from
right wing death squads kept them
from participating in the elections
last spring, Hook said the guerrillas
did not become involved in the elec
tions because they knew they would
lose.
Hook's distinction between au
thoritarian and totalitarian regimes
relied on three main differences.
First, he claimed totalitarian gov
ernments systematically oppress
their people while oppression in au
thoritarian countries is more limited
and arbitrary.
"In authoritarian regimes there are
islands of privacy. There are escapes
through religion, culture and art.
And, people are permitted to
leave. . . .There are no islands of
privacy in totalitarian governments."
The second difference between

the two types of government, Hook
said, was their potential to become
democratic. He cited the examples of
Spain and Greece —two govern
ments which became democratic
after being ruled for long periods by
dictators—to back up his assertion
that authoritarian regimes can evolve
into democracies.

By contrast, he said, "There is no
single illustration of a totalitarian so
ciety developing into a democracy."
Finally, according to Hook, the two
forms of government are distinct be
cause authoritarian regimes can be
pressured by the United States while
totalitarian governments would not
be influenced by U.S. political
pressure.
At the beginning of his speech
Hook said, "As partisans of democra
tic society we should be opposed to
both authoritarian and totalitarian
societies, but in situations where
there is no viable alternative, we
should support authoritarian gov
ernments over movements as
sociated with totalitarianism."
Hook's moral justification for his
support of authoritarian govern
ments over totalitarian regimes was
support for the lesser of two evils.
