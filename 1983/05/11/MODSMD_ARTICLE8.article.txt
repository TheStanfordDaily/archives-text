## Lake Lagunita offers spring recreation for students 
### ANDREA OLIVAS 
Lake Lagunita has been used
by thousands of students over
the decades as an escape from
the drudgery of their studies.
Nearly every spring, since
the lake's Water Carnival of the
early 1900s, Stanford has held
its Aqua Follies. In addition,
the Athletic Department has
taught sailing and windsurfing
during spring quarter. On a
sunny afternoon, onecan stroll
by the lake and see windsur
fers, people in sailboats or in
their infamous Big Way Yacht
Club vessels and even a few
swimmers brave enough to
take on the cold water and
ducks.
As for the question in many
people's minds concerning the
safety of swimming in the lake,

no one need worry, according
to Council of Presidents
member Mark Epstein, main
tenance man around the
boathouse. The water quality is
periodically tested for pollut
ants by the Health and Safety
Department on campus, Eps
tein said.
The boathouse crew re
trieves bottles, cans and other
debris.
Few injuries have been re
ported in recent years. At the
end of the school year when
the lake bed is dry, Epstein
said, a tractor tills the lake bot
tom.
The only real hazards to
swimmers are the sailboats and
windsurf boards which get in
the way of those who swim the
length of the lake. Inexperi

enced windsurfers do not
know how to steer enough to
avoid an unseeing swimmer.
To alleviate this problem, Eps
tein said, "There's talk of next
year setting up a designated
swimming area."
In the late 1880s, two
wholesale butchers by the
names of Crummy and Hall
brought sheep from San Fran
cisco for the sole purpose of
helping to finalize the hole in
the ground behind what are
now Roble and Lagunita. But
the intention of Crummy and
Hall was not to dig a lake. In
stead they had been commis
sioned to dig a sort of a dam to
store water during the wet
winter months for use in irriga
tion in the dry summer
months.
Crews excavated the hole.
Sheep were brought in to per
form "puddling." The bottom
and sides of the pit were
covered with adobe, a small
amount of water was let into
the bed of the pit and the
sheep were driven around in
circles to pack in the adobe.
This procedure is called
puddling because eventually,
the sheep forced the water that
had been let in into the clay. As
the sheep went round and
round, they kept closing in, so
that only a small puddle of
water remained in the middle.
The "lake" was used for irri
gation when Stanford opened
in 1891. A fence was erected
around it to keep students out.
The fence served its purpose
until in 1945, when members of
the Stanford Crew Team de

cided that the lake would be an
ideal place to practice. Shortly
afterward, the University
openend the lake for student
boating and swimming ac
tivities.
Along the east and north
shores of Lake Lag are large
chunks of concrete. These
slabs serve an important pur
pose. Since the "lake" is really
a sort of dam, and the path
around it is what is holding the
water back, this bank must
have some kind of support.
According to Campus Plan
ner Judy Chan, "What this is
called is rip-rap. It's generally
used in the construction of rec
reational marina areas, and
here it is used to stabilize the
berm (the bank) and hold the
earth back." Without these
somewhat unsightly concrete
slabs, the lake would never
have been around as long as it
has been.
For years Lake Lagunita has
been getting its water from
several different sources. But it
is currently receiving water
from the flume that runs from
San Francisquito Creek across
the golf course and empties
into Lake Lag. The flume was
damaged this year during the
torrential rains of a month ago.
Subsequently, the level of the
water has dropped off consid
erably. The flow of the San
Francisquito Creek must be
quite heavy in order for the
lake to receive enough water for
it to be put into use.
People wonder why the lake
is drained every summer. The
most popular belief is that the

lake is drained to lessen the
prevalent mosquito problem.
This is in part true. The other
reasons that the lake is drained
are also health-related.
The water does not flow
when the San Francisquito
Creek's water level is low and
little or no water comes
through the flume. The lake,
no longer with a supply of in
coming water, and never hav
ing had an outlet, must be
drained in keeping with state
regulations.
According to Sheryl Jensen
of Utilities and Engineering, "It
is not a natural lake and be
comes stagnant and grows
green things and it is required
by state regulation that it be
drained every June." She did
not know how long the Univer
sity has been draining the lake
because of the regulation.
In the distant past, the lake
was drained every summer for
agricultural purposes.
The lake seems to have had
relatively few problems from
Stanford/non-Stanford student
conflicts. But in the 1970s it
was reported that Stanford
students were being harassed
by high school students and
other non-Stanford students
who were just "hanging out" at
the lake.
This past academic year, out
siders caused only one inci
dent. Several motorcyclists
were caught trying to knock
over the recycling shed by the
boathouse with their motorcy
cles.
Epstein said the reason for
the drastic reduction in the

number of incidents of
harassment and vandalism is
due to the chains preventing
any large vehicles, other than
University maintenance vehi
cles, from coming too near the
boathouse and vicinity and
causing any damage. Motorcy
cles are the only vehicles that
are virtually impossible to bar be
cause they are about the same

size as a bicycle, and the Univer
sity does not want to deny access
ie students on bicycles. Unfortu
nately, motorcycles often take
advantage of the paths.
Stanford students should
continue to have fun in the sun
on, in and around Lake
Lagunita. Hopefully its tradi
tion may live on for future stu
dents to enjoy.

lake to receive enough water for
it to be put into use.
People wonder why the lake
is drained every summer. The
most popular belief is that the

lake is drained to lessen the
prevalent mosquito problem.
This is in part true. The other
reasons that the lake is drained
are also health-related.
The water does not flow
when the San Francisquito
Creek's water level is low and
little or no water comes
through the flume. The lake,
no longer with a supply of in
coming water, and never hav
ing had an outlet, must be
drained in keeping with state
regulations.
According to Sheryl Jensen
of Utilities and Engineering, "It
is not a natural lake and be
comes stagnant and grows
green things and it is required
by state regulation that it be
drained every June." She did
not know how long the Univer
sity has been draining the lake
because of the regulation.
In the distant past, the lake
was drained every summer for
agricultural purposes.
The lake seems to have had
relatively few problems from
Stanford/non-Stanford student
conflicts. But in the 1970s it
was reported that Stanford
students were being harassed
by high school students and
other non-Stanford students
who were just "hanging out" at
the lake.
This past academic year, out
siders caused only one inci
dent. Several motorcyclists
were caught trying to knock
over the recycling shed by the
boathouse with their motorcy
cles.
Epstein said the reason for
the drastic reduction in the

number of incidents of
harassment and vandalism is
due to the chains preventing
any large vehicles, other than
University maintenance vehi
cles, from coming too near the
boathouse and vicinity and
causing any damage. Motorcy
cles are the only vehicles that
are virtually impossible to bar be
cause they are about the same

size as a bicycle, and the Univer
sity does not want to deny access
ie students on bicycles. Unfortu
nately, motorcycles often take
advantage of the paths.
Stanford students should
continue to have fun in the sun
on, in and around Lake
Lagunita. Hopefully its tradi
tion may live on for future stu
dents to enjoy.

SPRING FUN: Windsurfers enjoy the sun out on Lake Lag but
they have to compete with Big Way yachters, sailors and
swimmers too.
Lake Lagunita has been used
by thousands of students over
the decades as an escape from
the drudgery of their studies.
Nearly every spring, since
the lake's Water Carnival of the
early 1900s, Stanford has held
its Aqua Follies. In addition,
the Athletic Department has
taught sailing and windsurfing
during spring quarter. On a
sunny afternoon, onecan stroll
by the lake and see windsur
fers, people in sailboats or in
their infamous Big Way Yacht
Club vessels and even a few
swimmers brave enough to
take on the cold water and
ducks.
As for the question in many
people's minds concerning the
safety of swimming in the lake,

no one need worry, according
to Council of Presidents
member Mark Epstein, main
tenance man around the
boathouse. The water quality is
periodically tested for pollut
ants by the Health and Safety
Department on campus, Eps
tein said.
The boathouse crew re
trieves bottles, cans and other
debris.
Few injuries have been re
ported in recent years. At the
end of the school year when
the lake bed is dry, Epstein
said, a tractor tills the lake bot
tom.
The only real hazards to
swimmers are the sailboats and
windsurf boards which get in
the way of those who swim the
length of the lake. Inexperi

enced windsurfers do not
know how to steer enough to
avoid an unseeing swimmer.
To alleviate this problem, Eps
tein said, "There's talk of next
year setting up a designated
swimming area."
In the late 1880s, two
wholesale butchers by the
names of Crummy and Hall
brought sheep from San Fran
cisco for the sole purpose of
helping to finalize the hole in
the ground behind what are
now Roble and Lagunita. But
the intention of Crummy and
Hall was not to dig a lake. In
stead they had been commis
sioned to dig a sort of a dam to
store water during the wet
winter months for use in irriga
tion in the dry summer
months.
Crews excavated the hole.
Sheep were brought in to per
form "puddling." The bottom
and sides of the pit were
covered with adobe, a small
amount of water was let into
the bed of the pit and the
sheep were driven around in
circles to pack in the adobe.
This procedure is called
puddling because eventually,
the sheep forced the water that
had been let in into the clay. As
the sheep went round and
round, they kept closing in, so
that only a small puddle of
water remained in the middle.
The "lake" was used for irri
gation when Stanford opened
in 1891. A fence was erected
around it to keep students out.
The fence served its purpose
until in 1945, when members of
the Stanford Crew Team de

cided that the lake would be an
ideal place to practice. Shortly
afterward, the University
openend the lake for student
boating and swimming ac
tivities.
Along the east and north
shores of Lake Lag are large
chunks of concrete. These
slabs serve an important pur
pose. Since the "lake" is really
a sort of dam, and the path
around it is what is holding the
water back, this bank must
have some kind of support.
According to Campus Plan
ner Judy Chan, "What this is
called is rip-rap. It's generally
used in the construction of rec
reational marina areas, and
here it is used to stabilize the
berm (the bank) and hold the
earth back." Without these
somewhat unsightly concrete
slabs, the lake would never
have been around as long as it
has been.
For years Lake Lagunita has
been getting its water from
several different sources. But it
is currently receiving water
from the flume that runs from
San Francisquito Creek across
the golf course and empties
into Lake Lag. The flume was
damaged this year during the
torrential rains of a month ago.
Subsequently, the level of the
water has dropped off consid
erably. The flow of the San
Francisquito Creek must be
quite heavy in order for the
lake to receive enough water for
it to be put into use.
