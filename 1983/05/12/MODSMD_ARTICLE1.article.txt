# Committee advises evaluation changes
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
The Committee on Academic Ap
praisal and Achievement (C-AAA)
will recommend sweeping changes
in the current teacher evaluation
form to the faculty senate today.
Noting that the form is actually
used in only 59 percent of the classes
where it should he administered, the
committee recommends a simplified
form that reduces the number of
questions from 32 to six.
"We're hoping we've come up
with a system that will be used more
widely," said Susan Matisoff, profes
sor of Asian Languages and the head
of the committee. "We're also trying
to make the forms more meaningful
for students."
The committee's report noted that
the old form was not taken as seri
ously as the committee would like
and that there was "some degree of
student burn-out' in filling out the
form'' because of its length.
"We have concluded that a smaller
number of questions requiring
scale-ranking responses will be less
burdensome to answer, yet will not
result in a decrease in the usefulness
of the forms," the report states.
Thirty percent of students who are
given the forms in class fail to fill
them out, the report says.
The six questions asked by the
form will be "relatively general," the
report states. They will be: "How
would you evaluate the contribution
of this course to your learning expe
rience?"; "How would you evaluate
the course overall?"; "How would

you evaluate the instructor's teach
ing overall?"; "Consideringsuch fac
tors as course organization, readings
and assignments, assessment
methods and teaching style, what
were the best things about this
course?"; "What improvements, if
any, would you suggest if this in
structor is to give this course again?"
Students will also be asked to
make any general comments they
feel would be useful to the instruc
tor.
The new form would replace nu
merical ratings with a scale of de
scriptive adjectives such as "Excel
lent," "Good " and "Very Good."
The evaluations will consist of two
parts: one for the use of faculty and
the administration alone, and the
other for [be ASSU Course Guide.
Matisoff said combining the two
parts will simplify the evaluation pro
cess.
The committee also recom
mended making students more
aware of what the evaluations are
used for by printing an explanation
on the form.
"Only 27 percent of the students
and 49 percent of the faculty sur
veyed knew that student evaluations
are used for decisions about promo
tion, tenure and salary," the report
says. "One-quarter of both groups
responded that they did not know
the uses to which evaluations were
put."
The report also said it would con
tinue "close cooperation between
the ASSU and the University for the
gathering of information."
