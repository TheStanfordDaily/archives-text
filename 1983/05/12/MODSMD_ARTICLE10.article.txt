## The
						Stanford Daily Coffee House blues 
### 
So quickly we forget. Less than fouryears ago,
the ASSU submitted a proposal to run the Cof
fee House at Tresidder Union. After negotia
tions were completed, the Coffee House be
came a student-run organization.
The aim when the Coffee House was set up
was to break even, rather than make a profit.
Profits were to go back to the students in the
form of lower prices and better entertainment.
Profits, however, have been rare. The Coffee
House incurred a loss fall quarter.
The Coffee House has made some promising
moves to improve its service but it seems
plagued by mismanagement. It is facing tough
competition from the Corner Pocket and other
new student-run operations. As a result,
changes are beingconsidered. The board wisely
plans to concentrate on tougher marketing
strategies. It also intends to implement innova
tions such as outside entertainment.
Unfortunately for the ASSU and the Coffee
House, however, Manager Steve Weiss is leav
ing his job May 31. The Coffee House board
should act quickly to fill his position rather than
postpone the decision by choosing an interim

manager. The board has already operated
somewhat incompetently since it has not yet
replaced a manager who announced his inten
tion to resign back in January.
Logically, the Coffee House is looking for
someone with previous experience in food
management. Is it so difficult to find such a
person given four months notice?
We agree wholeheartedly with the ASSU that
the Coffee House should remain student-run.
But we also agree that the manager should be a
permanent, full-time employee in order to lend
much needed continuity and operational and
financial expertise to the operation.
We hope the lack of a manager does not hurt
the ASSU goal of making the Coffee House a
prime student gathering spot for eating, talking,
studying and entertainment in a pleasant at
mosphere while providing student jobs, and of
fering the best possible service at the lowest
possible price.
As former Council of Presidents member Dick
Butterfield said, "It is up to all of you to demand
prompt and effective management of one of
your prize student activities."
