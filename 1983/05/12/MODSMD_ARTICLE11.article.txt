# Who cares about Harvard?
## 
### 
University President Donald Ken
nedy, the Derek Bok of the West,
wakes up and jogs the Dish. The
Dish, for all those who aren't aware,
is the Boston Marathon of Palo Alto.
Kennedy runs on Nike training
shoes, because Nikes, as we all
know, are the Adidas of Japan.
After a quick cold shower Kennedy
drives down to campus. The car Ken
nedy drives is a Ford; Fords, of
course, are the Ferarris of Detroit.
Kennedy looks dapper in a Bill Blass
suit. Blass is, after all, the Yves Saint-
Laurent of America.
Kennedy is an employee of Stan
ford University, and I probably don't
have to remind you that Stanford is
known as the "Harvard of the West."

UnJike cancer, however, we know how Harvard
envy works, and it can even be cured if it is diag
nosed early enough.

One must remember not to confuse
Stanford with Northwestern (the
Harvard of the Midwest) or with
Duke (the Harvard of the South) or
with Rice (the Harvard of Texas) or
even with Yale (the Harvard of New
Haven). There are also about 500
other Harvard spin-offs that Stanford
must not be confused with.
So remember: this school is Stan
ford, the Harvard of the West! If you
don't believe me, there are several
hundred T-shirts on campus which
attest to this fact. Although the
T-shirts read, "Harvard, the Stanford
of the East," the Harvard-envy mes
sage is still crystal clear. (Harvard
envy is not a Freudian term, so don't
try to look it up.)
Unfortunately, the "Stanford of
the East" T-shirt is just one of many
manifestations of Stanford's Har
vard-inferiority complex infatuation. I
was at Harvard over winter break
(for a pomposity contest), and while I
didn't measure precise numbers, I
can safely say that there are about
three times as many people wearing
Harvard T-shirts here as there are at
the place of origin. I'm also sorry to
report that I counted but two Stan
ford T-shirts during my week-long
stay in Cambridge, and one of those
was being worn by a bag lady. What's
worse is that I'm not even lying.
But there is more to Harvard-envy
than just Harvard-envy clothing. At
least as popular here are Harvard
envy comments. One of the more
common is the frustrated Stanford
student complaining, "I'll bet this
never happens at Harvard." And how
many times have we all heard the
Harvard-accepted Stanford student
asked, "How come you came here?"
Let's face it: Harvard-envy is as
common out here as Vuarnets, and I
haven't met a student here yet who
hasn't encountered this dreaded
disease in one form or another.
Unlike cancer, however, we know
how Harvard-envy works, and it can
even be cured if it is diagnosed early
enough.
Harvard-envy exists because a
large body of Stanford students do
not actually believe that Stanford is a
better school than Harvard. (Why
these students even care about this
contest is another matter; right now
let's just stick to the problem at
hand.)
Clearly if we all knew that, yes in
deed, Stanford is a "better" school
than Harvard, then there would be
no need for the "Stanford of the
East" T-shirt. Nor would we inces
santly compare our admissions fig
ures, our numbers of Nobel Prize
winners and the number of volumes
in our libraries with our Cambridge
competitor. In brief, if we really be

lieved that we are the hot stuff that
we claim to be, then we'd lose about
as much sleep over Harvard people
as they lose over us â€” namely none.
Right now, Harvard and Stanford
have an Avis/Hertz relationship.
While we may very well "try harder,"
the very fact that we acknowledge
Harvard's sovereignty (via T-shirts,
etc.) is evidence that we are guilty of
flattery. The truly great is beyond
comparison. If you think that Stan
ford is a better place than Harvard,
then you shouldn't sink to Harvard's
level through comparisons. When
has Harvard even acknowledged our
friendly rivalry? I can't think of even
one instance.
Now imagine that some brilliant

young entrepreneur at De Anza Col
lege prints up a bunch of T-shirts that
read, "Stanford, the De Anza College
of Palo Alto." Would any of us care?
Would any of us do more than
perhaps force out a condescending
chuckle? Of course we wouldn't;
because to us, De Anza College is
strictly minor league ball.
So by the same token, assuming:
(1) that we feel a need to be "better"
than Harvard, and (2) that we
genuinely believe that Stanford is
better than Harvard would not a
more appropriate Stanford T-shirt
read something like, "I go to Stan
ford. Please show your ID if you wish
to speak with me."
But back to the disease. I'm going
to try to convince all of you doubting
Buffys and Biffs that Stanford is, in
fact, the better of the two institu
tions. First let me describe for you
the four students in my high school
class who went on to study at Har
vard. I have changed their names to
protect their guilt.
Danny Brown. Worst brown-noser
of all time. Danny played the clarinet
and he wrestled, but he also fre
quently stole UNICEF money and
played tricks on the blind and crip
pled. Today Danny is working on his
12th unpublished trilogy, he smokes
a pipe, and of course he wears a be-

So by the same token, assuming 1) that we feel a
need to be 'better' than Harvard, and 2) that we
genuinely believe that Stanford is better than Har
vard; would not a more appropriate Stanford T-shirt
read something like, 7 go to Stanford. Please show
your I.D. if you wish to speak with me/

ret.
Peter Brown. Second worst
brown-noser of all time. Peter used
to make films and also good grades,
but he also used to torture small
animals and insects and he once set
fire to a Hallmark card store. Today
Peter is working on his 12th unpub
lished trilogy, he smokes a pipe, and
of course he also wears a beret.
Nathan Brown. Third worst
brown-noser of all time. Nathan
played basketball and volunteered in
a hospital, but he also used to steal
drugs when he volunteered, and he
sold grass to third-graders. Nathan
was once seen decapitating a Smurf.
Today Nathan is working on his 12th
unpublished trilogy, he smokes a
pipe, and of course he too wears a
beret.
Richie Rich. Rich was actually only
about eighth or ninth on the All Time

Brown-Noser Hit Parade. He was in
credibly stupid, however. Not that
SATs mean anything, but if I had
$10,000 for every SAT question that
Rich got correct, I'd still have to take
my dates to McDonalds. Rich was
quite wealthy, though, and he was
quite a tennis stud. Today Rich is
working on his 12th unpublished
trilogy, he smokes a pipe, and of
course he wears a beret.
Now let's look at the students
whicb my high school sent here . . .
me. Clearly the higher quality people
go to Stanford.
But there are still more reasons
why Stanford is the place to be. (1)
When you walk down the street in
Palo Alto, you don't get a cup of es
presso shoved up your nose every
five seconds. (2) When you go on a
date out here, the chances are much
better that your date is NOT secret/y
recording your conversation for use
in a future short story. (3) Our athle
tic teams are bigger, better, meaner,
and wealthier. (4) You don't have to
feel guilty out here if your family did
not arrive in America on the May
flower. (5) Aberrations are more toler
ated out here, such as being Black,
Jewish or Oriental. (6) You can de
velop skin cancer almost all year
round in California. (7) There are no
Dennys in the Cambridge area. (8)
It's not fair or nice to say that we're
better looking, so I won't. (9) Stan
ford leads the way in the computer
sciences. So while a Harvard grad
may know the significance of "Dr.
Suess meets Marcel Proust," we
Stanford grads will be able to over
power the philosophy jocks with the
latest high-tech advancements. We'll
"blind them with science and hit
them with technology," to quote
Thomas Dolby. (10) Check this one
out: when it's seven in the evening in
Cambridge, it's still only the late af
ternoon in Palo Alto! What a deal!
You don't have to be Paul Wiggin
to know that the best defense is a
strong offense. Similarly, our
strongest weapon in the war against
Harvard-envy is a rightfully immod
est self-image.
After that, it is important to be able
to identify the early warning signs of
Harvard-envy when they appear.
They are: (1) A desire for imported
coffees that are served in dollhouse
sized cups and saucers. (2) Excessive
use of the suffix "-esque." (3) The

development of a George
Plimptonesque fake British accent.
(4) Overuse of the words
"platitudinous," "eleemosynary,"
and "chimerical." (5) The over
whelming desire to wear a beret if
you are male, or peasant dresses if
you are female. (6) Inflammation and
swelling of the ego, and (7) the de
velopment of a vehement aversion to
listening to anything that is not ut
tered by a person who wears horn
rimmed glasses and straight-legged
jeans. (If there are any Harvard
graduates reading this column, the
previous list was not intended to
parallel the Seven Deadly Sins.)
If you recognize any of these
symptoms in yourself or in others,
read "Once Around the Quad" and
call me in the morning,
