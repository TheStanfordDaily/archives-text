## The 						place not to get married 
### 
It may seem unusual for an undergraduate to be con
sidering marriage, but there are a few of us around. In a
population of roughly 6000 students pursuing an
academic education at an undergraduate level, few seri
ously contemplate marriage as a part of their near future,
at least at Stanford. A majority of students are more
concerned with completing their education and obtain
ing employment or being accepted by a graduate studies
program. These are also my goals. However, in the pro
cess, I was lucky enough to develop a lasting relation
ship, one that I am willing to commit myself to for my
remaining years. My friends consider me a rarity, but not
an unlucky one. The clergy of Stanford Memorial
Church share this opinion.
According to Reverend Wendy Smith, a member of
the Memorial Church ministry, it is indeed rare that an
undergraduate, or even someone in their early 20s, ap
proaches the officials of the church with a request to be
married there. Most of the people who do make this
choice are in their late 20s or early 30s and have attended
a graduate program here. After speaking with Smith
about my own request, I can better understand why.
Like many students, my fiancee and I were impressed
with the beauty of the church, having admired it from
the time we were freshmen. It is truly an admirable
tribute to Cod, but one that no longer has special mean
ing to me. Its walls seem insurmountably high, its
stained glass windows coldly foreboding, and I no
longer feel welcome in its worn pews.
My request was simple: to have my aunt, who is a
professional organist, play at my wedding. In the past,
those who had an affiliation with the University were
afforded the privilege of being married in Memorial
Church, sharing this special occasion with others who
have been an integral part of their lives by including
them in a ceremony that marks a great transition.
Today, this does not continue to be true. The tradition
that the privilege of using the church is only afforded to
Stanford students, faculty and staff still remains, but the
freedom to include others in the ceremony is no longer
fullv embodied. According to Smith, the clergymen

were "so embarrassed" by the quality of the musical
performances within the sanctuary that they could not
continue to allow this freedom. "You realize it is a ques
tion of quality control."
As an industrial engineer, I am familiar with quality
and its importance, but my education has failed to in
struct me of its application in this capacity. Surely, in the
context of a wedding service, or any worship service,
God does not question the quality of our tribute to Him
through music and song. If this is true, perhaps the
clergy should censor others who we wish to include,
such as the best man, or even the mother of the bride, in
order to prevent embarrassment to themselves and to
maintain the quality of presentation.
Indeed, this is ridiculous, but it is a reality. Besides this
limitation, the administrators of the church maintain
that only those who are members of the Music Depart
ment may sing or play a musical instrument in the
chapel.
Further, the music that is to be performed must be
classical and religious; no contemporary music, includ
ing that which is religious, is permissible. The price for
the use of the chapel is $125, but this does not include
the $60 that must be paid to each performer (the or
ganist, other musicians, and vocalists) or the compensa
tion to be given to the presiding minister or priest. The
total of these costs could easily amount to over twice
that of any other facility.
After learning of all the restrictions imposed by the
Memorial Church clergy, it is not difficult to understand
why fewer students choose to be married in Memorial
Church. For myself, I must disregard the beauty of the
facility and abandon the notion of being married there.
My experience indicates that the clergy are too con
cerned with maintaining Jane Stanford's memorial to her
beloved husband Leland and not wholly dedicated to
providing an open and welcome sanctuary for the wor
ship of Cod.
