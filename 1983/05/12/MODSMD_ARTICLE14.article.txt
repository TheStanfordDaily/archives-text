## Is life a negotiable commodity? 
### 
It depressed me to read an edito
rial stating that "undoubtedly the re
search is sometimes unpleasant, but
the animals serve a useful purpose in
helping researchers learn about
organ transplants, cancer. . (Daily,
May 5). Aside from the flagrant
euphemism "unpleasant," I was in
terested by the word "useful."
The research may be useful, but is
it really in the long-term interests of
one species to ignore, through
euphemisms or simple callousness,
its own victimization of fellow
species? Perhaps it is more important
to ask whether life is a negotiable
commodity. The mere fact that re
searchers sacrifice the lives of "les
ser" creatures (who for all we know
are as sentient and emotionally com
plex as the Homo Sapiens) for a per
ceived "greater" benefit (and one
that is in no wise always obvious to
the laity) seems to establish intelli
gence as a criterion for the valuation
of life.
The implications are ominous, but
perhaps a shade too subtle for our
society's esteemed inserters of metal
electrodes into living animal brains,
etc. to fathom. The frequent com
parison of their laboratories to Treb
linka and Belsen is as philosophically
valid as in terms of actual torture (as if
the latter. . . .were not sufficient in
itself.)
I feel that lack of historical and
philosophical perspective accounts
for such abuses in fields that tend to
specialize. The issue is applicable
even to the nuclear disarmament
movement. It is easy for rich and
poor alike to be far-sighted and work
against the extinction of their species
(and indeed most of life); a more
legitimate vision, however, is clearly
one which operates through com
passion as well as self-interest. It is in
animal rights that concerned people
(somewhat quixotically?) demon
strate their commitment to the wider
picture.

A comment in a recent "Bug Me"
column on closed doors bugged us
(Daily, May 6). In order to answer the
questions about closed doors in
Meyer and in Tresidder, you con
sulted Elizabeth Salzer and Cheryl St.
Clair, who happen to be female.
The sentence we object to is the
following: "Women seem to be in
charge of all the places that have un
used doors." What relevance does
this have to the article? Are we to
infer that women choose to close
doors, or that you think it is notewor

thy that women are in charge? In any
case, we doubt that you would have
made a similar comment if men held
those two positions.
Your sexism is showing.

Graduate aid
In response to the article (Daily,
April 28) commending Stanford for
awarding aid on the basis of need
rather than merit, I would like to
point out that this policy pertains
primarily to undergraduates. Many
departments at Stanford award
graduate fellowships solely on the
basis of academic performance.

The rationale for this is that such an
incentive is necessary to attract
superior students who might other
wise do their graduate work
elsewhere. Unfortunately, the result
is that many students who are capa
ble of financing their education are
given full support while others (in
cluding those admitted to MA pro
grams where no financial is "avail
able") who cannot attend Stanford
without assistance receive nothing at
all.
Before Stanford officials wax holier
than thou about their "egalitarian"
financial aid policy it would behoove
them to make certain that all
graduate students, like under
graduates, are awarded aid on the
basis of need.
