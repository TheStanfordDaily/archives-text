# Views on the Hoover controversy
## Viewpoint/Sidney Hook Socialist responds to charges 
### 
The following was addressed to
University President Donald Ken
nedy:
I have been reading with a growing
sense of concern the orchestrated at
tacks against the Hoover Institution
and its Fellows on the ground that
their alleged ideological bias com
prises their academic integrity and
violates the spirit, if not the letter, of
the principles of academic freedom.
Since I have spent the larger part of
the last 10 years as Senior Research
Fellow at the Hoover Institution, my
observations and experience during
this time are relevant in assessing the
validity of charges that are being
aired on campus.
Politically, I am a life-long Socialist,
an old friend and admirer of Norman
Ihomas, currently a member of
Social-Democrats, USA and Vice-
President of The League for Indus
trial Democracy. Philosophically I am
an experimental naturalist who has
applied the principles of pragmatic
analysis, learned from my teacher,
John Dewey, to the major social and
political philosophy, the philosophy
of law, history and education, with
special interest in the thought of Karl
Marx and the legacies of Marxism. I
have published extensively in all of
these areas.
When I retired, after reaching
Emeritus status as Professor of Phi
losophy at New York University, I re
ceived several offers to continue my
research elsewhere but decided to
accept Dr. Glenn Campbell's invita
tion to come to Hoover for several
reasons. Among them were the ex
cellence of its research and library
facilities, the opportunity to engage
in dialogue and critical exchange
with reputable colleagues, and the
salibrious climate at Stanford—all of
which I had sampled during the year I
spent at The Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences
when Ralph Tyler was its director.
My 10 years here have been very
fruitful despite several setbacks to
my health. Since 1973 I have pub
lished five major volumes: Prag
matism and the Tragic Sense of Life,
Education and the Taming of Power,
Revolution, Reform and Social jus
tice, Philosophy and Public Policy
and this year on the 100 th anniver
sary of Karl Marx's death, Marxism
and Beyond, the first chapter if which
ts entitled "Karl Marx versus the
Communist Movement" and the last
"A Critique of Conservatism."
Not only have my years here been
productive, they have been intellec
tually stimulating—even more so
that the longer period at New York

University and other institutions at
which I have taught as well as my year
at the Center for Advanced Study.
At New York University as well as at
the Center, there was too much of a
sameness in social and political
orientation. Only in the arcane areas
of epistemology and ontology did I
find the bracing criticism of my first
principles that is so provacative to
second thought. To my surprise, de
spite Hoover's reputation for con
servatism, I found a broader spec
trum of thought my col
leagues at Hoover than I found
among my colleagues at NYU and,
from what I have been able to infer
from reading and occasional meet
ings, at Stanford itself.
Having spent most of my adult life
at the academy—l began to teach in
1927—with a varied educational ex
perience that includes, amusingly
enough, serving as External Examiner
of Dr. Richard Lyman and his wife
when they were matriculating at
Swarthmore, I believe I can distin
guish intellectual-shoddy from the
merely competent and the merely
competent from the first rate. The
test is always the quality, not the
quantity of achievement. It is my
considered judgment that my col
leagues at Hoover taken as a group,
regardless of the character and color
of their beliefs, compare favorably
with the standards of achievement
reached by the faculties of our
foremost institutions of higher edu
cation.
The accusation that there is a polit
ical test administered to those who
are invited as Fellows to Hoover calls
into question the good faith of those
who, without evidence, have leveled
these slanderous charges. To single
out Hoover for investigation because
of the presence of some outstanding
conservative thinkers among its Fel
lows could very well establish a prec
edent for investigation of other dis
ciplines and departments at Stanford
University because of the absence of
conservative thinkers among them.
It seems to me that as the chief
responsible officer of instruction at
Stanford you have the authority and
authentic knowledge to present the
facts to the academic and general
community and to cut short the cam
paign of harassment and innuendo
against the scholars at Hoover who
are no less dedicated to the pursuit
of truth and clarity than you yourself.

edent for investigation of other dis
ciplines and departments at Stanford
University because of the absence of
conservative thinkers among them.
It seems to me that as the chief
responsible officer of instruction at
Stanford you have the authority and
authentic knowledge to present the
facts to the academic and general
community and to cut short the cam
paign of harassment and innuendo
against the scholars at Hoover who
are no less dedicated to the pursuit
of truth and clarity than you yourself.

The following was addressed to
University President Donald Ken
nedy:
I have been reading with a growing
sense of concern the orchestrated at
tacks against the Hoover Institution
and its Fellows on the ground that
their alleged ideological bias com
prises their academic integrity and
violates the spirit, if not the letter, of
the principles of academic freedom.
Since I have spent the larger part of
the last 10 years as Senior Research
Fellow at the Hoover Institution, my
observations and experience during
this time are relevant in assessing the
validity of charges that are being
aired on campus.
Politically, I am a life-long Socialist,
an old friend and admirer of Norman
Ihomas, currently a member of
Social-Democrats, USA and Vice-
President of The League for Indus
trial Democracy. Philosophically I am
an experimental naturalist who has
applied the principles of pragmatic
analysis, learned from my teacher,
John Dewey, to the major social and
political philosophy, the philosophy
of law, history and education, with
special interest in the thought of Karl
Marx and the legacies of Marxism. I
have published extensively in all of
these areas.
When I retired, after reaching
Emeritus status as Professor of Phi
losophy at New York University, I re
ceived several offers to continue my
research elsewhere but decided to
accept Dr. Glenn Campbell's invita
tion to come to Hoover for several
reasons. Among them were the ex
cellence of its research and library
facilities, the opportunity to engage
in dialogue and critical exchange
with reputable colleagues, and the
salibrious climate at Stanford—all of
which I had sampled during the year I
spent at The Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences
when Ralph Tyler was its director.
My 10 years here have been very
fruitful despite several setbacks to
my health. Since 1973 I have pub
lished five major volumes: Prag
matism and the Tragic Sense of Life,
Education and the Taming of Power,
Revolution, Reform and Social jus
tice, Philosophy and Public Policy
and this year on the 100 th anniver
sary of Karl Marx's death, Marxism
and Beyond, the first chapter if which
ts entitled "Karl Marx versus the
Communist Movement" and the last
"A Critique of Conservatism."
Not only have my years here been
productive, they have been intellec
tually stimulating—even more so
that the longer period at New York

University and other institutions at
which I have taught as well as my year
at the Center for Advanced Study.
At New York University as well as at
the Center, there was too much of a
sameness in social and political
orientation. Only in the arcane areas
of epistemology and ontology did I
find the bracing criticism of my first
principles that is so provacative to
second thought. To my surprise, de
spite Hoover's reputation for con
servatism, I found a broader spec
trum of thought my col
leagues at Hoover than I found
among my colleagues at NYU and,
from what I have been able to infer
from reading and occasional meet
ings, at Stanford itself.
Having spent most of my adult life
at the academy—l began to teach in
1927—with a varied educational ex
perience that includes, amusingly
enough, serving as External Examiner
of Dr. Richard Lyman and his wife
when they were matriculating at
Swarthmore, I believe I can distin
guish intellectual-shoddy from the
merely competent and the merely
competent from the first rate. The
test is always the quality, not the
quantity of achievement. It is my
considered judgment that my col
leagues at Hoover taken as a group,
regardless of the character and color
of their beliefs, compare favorably
with the standards of achievement
reached by the faculties of our
foremost institutions of higher edu
cation.
The accusation that there is a polit
ical test administered to those who
are invited as Fellows to Hoover calls
into question the good faith of those
who, without evidence, have leveled
these slanderous charges. To single
out Hoover for investigation because
of the presence of some outstanding
conservative thinkers among its Fel
lows could very well establish a prec
edent for investigation of other dis
ciplines and departments at Stanford
University because of the absence of
conservative thinkers among them.
It seems to me that as the chief
responsible officer of instruction at
Stanford you have the authority and
authentic knowledge to present the
facts to the academic and general
community and to cut short the cam
paign of harassment and innuendo
against the scholars at Hoover who
are no less dedicated to the pursuit
of truth and clarity than you yourself.
