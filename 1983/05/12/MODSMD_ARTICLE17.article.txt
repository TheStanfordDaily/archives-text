EDITOR'S NOTE: In re
cent weeks much debate
has surrounded the place
of the Hoover Institution
in the overall structure of
the University. The Daily
has covered the growing
controversy both on its
news' and opinions'
pages, yet has received

many more letters and
viewpoints in this
than on an y oth e r
campus-wide issue in
some time.
Thus the following, a
sampling of opinions
which the Daily has re
ceived on this topic.
