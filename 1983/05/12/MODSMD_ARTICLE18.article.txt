## No bias in Hoover research 
### 
The proposal to sever the ties be
tween Stanford and the Hoover In
stitution is as distuibing as it is in
explicable. I was a visiting research
fellow at Hoover for a year and there
is no evidence of politicization. My
appointment was based on written
materials only, and I challenge the
Daily to find any political litmus test
in these materials. My proposed re
search continued efforts that were
begun at UC-Berkeley, under the
dissertation supervision of a liberal
economist of international renown.
During my year at Hoover, no one
made any attempt to direct or focus
my research along political lines.
I found the year spent at Hoover to
be extremely rewarding. The perma

nent researc hers there vver scholar s
of the highest caliber. The two most
senior historians, for example, were
qualified, clearly, to hold an ap
pointment in any histoiy department
in the nation.
Several Hoover senior s< holars are
involved in the Reagan adrninistra
tion. Several senior scholar from
other universities and research in
stitutions were involved in the Carter
administration. These s< holars were
not criticized as being politicized
from any source including the con
servative press. Why should Hoover
scholars be subjec ted to such criti
cisms.
