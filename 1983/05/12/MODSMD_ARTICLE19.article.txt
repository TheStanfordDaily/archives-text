## Humanities too have a bias 
### 
No matter how intellectually
superior and fair-minded an indi
vidual or, a fortiori, an institution,
there is always a ceitain amount of
bias stemming from a specific back
ground and cultural environment.
Indeed, it proper proportions are
preserved, this balance of the deeply
personal (including the traditional
and local) and the other oriented
(universality and tolerance) seems
light and healthy for humans.
Is the Hoover Institution unbal
anced in this sense, as some col
leagues have charged in your col
umns? I do not see how anyone can
reasonably claim this. I know a
number of Hoover people person
ally, and most of them strike me as
being admirably decent and open
minded by any objective criteria. As
for the matter of their political lean
ing en masse, clearly there is consid
erable diversity, despite whatever
"core bias, inevitable to some ex
tent in any case.
just how fair-minded the Institu
tion is can best be judged by compar
ing the situation on the main cam
pus, tor example in the c rucial area of
the humanities. In my 24 years here, I
have met only a tiny handful of pro
lessors who were other than liberal.
On the contrary, according to a sur
vey conducted by Seymour Lipset,
among i'jOO professors of the

humanities in the country at largo, it
turned out that for practical pur
poses (and I mean practical) they all
subscribed to exactly the same (lib
eral) views. This is health and bal
ance?
It is my considered opinion that
this incredible lockstep combined
with a veritable protectionism and
tyranny of the majority (predicted by
locqueville) has helped to pull the
humanities down to near-demise
and, specifically here, has caused us
to drop in national ratings (if one
picks faculty on the basis of liberal
belief and non-qualitative criteria to
whatever extent, what can you ex
pect?)
The other day, against consider
able resistance, I persuaded the
Great Works program to hear Sidney
Hook, the grand old man of Hoover
who knows more about Marxism that
anyone in this country and probably
the world. Sidney Hook is a socialist,
but that wasn't liberal enough for
some and others weren't sure: he
was a Hoover! And anti-Soviet! Well,
he came and delivered and the stu
dents seemed to love it. It was splen
did. If all the Hoover Institution ever
did was to bring us Sidney Hook, I
say let's put a garland of flower*
around the tower.
