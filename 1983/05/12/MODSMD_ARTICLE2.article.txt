# Wallet, bank card thefts hit campus
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
A few students here have been victims of an automatic teller card scam
which begins with a missing card or wallet, proceeds with a call from an
alleged bank official requesting the victim's "secret code" and ends with a
lower than expected account balance.
Pat Warrick, a spokesperson for the Tresidder branch of Wells Fargo, said
that though the incidents have not been widespread, the bank is concerned
about them and is having its technicians look into the problem.
Stanford Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer said he was not aware of recent
thefts of automatic teller cards. But since the problem has occurred in the
past, "it wouldn't surprise me if it happened again," he said.
According to Niemeyer, the area is currently undergoing a "whole rash of
wallet thefts" and his department is warning victims about the possibility of
such a bank card scam happening to them.
kathy George, the Versateller specialist for the Stanford Shopping Center
Bank of America branch, said Bank of America has also suffered from "a
couple" of the thefts.
I found this out a month or two ago when one of my customers came in
and said his wife had her card stolen and a guy called her from Market and
Castro and said that he had her card and needed the I.D. number. But she
knew we didn't operate that way and told him that she knew he had stolen
the card," George said.
I rom what the guy told me, the people are really professional-sounding.
Ihey don't hesitate to give out a manager's name or a bank branch, even
though they're lying," she said.
According to George, a computer generates the secret code numbers,
called Personal Identification Numbers (PIN), and the bank has no way of
knowing the number.
"The PIN is issued by a computer, and that way no one can say to us 'you
have my PIN number and you're using my account.' There is no way tor us
even to retrieve a lost number. The computer wipes the number right off the
records. People should just remember that we have no way of knowing the
PIN number," George explained.
Any Bank of America customers who have either lost or had stolen their
24-hour-teller cards should report the missing card to the appropriate
branch or call the toll-free Versateller hotline at 800-622-0789.
When a customer reports a missing card, the bank immediately "blocks
the card. When someone tries to use it the machine will tell them to see a
bank officer," George said.
