## An inquiry into Hoover serves no purpose 
### 
My remarks below reflect my opin
ions and not the opinions of the
Hoover Institution or my Stanford
University colleagues.
The Daily's endorsement of the pe
tition urging the faculty senate to
empower the board of trustees to in
vestigate Hoover strains my credulity
("Take a look at the Tower," Daily,
May 4). Such an inquiry is an exercise
in futility, a waste of valuable time
and human effort and an insult to
those who work at Hoover. Why?
First, there are many different re
ports and publications about the
Hoover Institution already in the
public domain that describe in detail
funding, hiring procedures, schol
arly activities, library developements
and services performed by the
Hoover Institution.
If those materials had been accu
rately consulted, none of the base
less charges and slanderous state
ments published in the Daily and the
public press would have ever ap
peared.

Second, such an inquiry is a waste
of time for the administrators and
staff of Stanford University and
Hoover Institution alike to have to
invest their time and energy, when
they should be at work or their nor
mal managerial and scholarly ac
tivities.
Third, an inquiry is an insult to
those who manage Stanford Univer
sity and Hoover Institution because
the charges are so idiotic and really
should not deserve a response.
Let me elaborate on my last state
ment with some particulars from my
perspective at the Hoover Institution
as the curator-scholar of the Fast
Asian Collection.
Upon my arrival ai Stanford in An
gusl 1975, (he Hocjtj Resc-arc /»
tute gratiously extended to me a
courtesy appointment as an adjunct
professor. This action impressed
upon me the cordial and excellent
relationship between the University
and Hoover Institution.

In 1979 80 I was reviewed by com
mittees and according to procedures
agreed upon by Stanford and
floover, I appointed a Senior Fel
low.
My duties have been to manage
and develop the East Asian Collec
tion, help to publish distinguished
scholarship on bast Asia in the 20th
century and conduct my research on
Chinese economic history and inter
national relations of Asia.
I have been at the Institution now
for nearly eight years and I have
never observed any political parti
sanship or any other activities as
charged in the faculty petition.
What I have noted are the follow
ing l it st, I have observed a unique
relation evolving between a great
university ancJ «» cJistinguish&cj c*?ntc*r
for advanced studies. I have ob
served how Hoover Institution re
sources made possible new research
on fast Asia which could not be done
under the existing circumstances of
financial squeeze of the past five

years in area studies. I have observed
how Hoover Institution resources
combined with University financial
aid have been effectively used to de
velop the East Asian Library so that
the collection can continue to he on
the cutting edge of research in the
1980s and beyond. I have heard
numerous visitors from around the
United States and abroad tell me
what a unique arrangement Stanford
University and the Hoover Institu
tion have had to cooperate and
evolve together, 112 inally, I have had
the opportunity, which I could not
have had in any other institution, to
participate in developing new schol
arly research on Fast Asia. This op
portunity c ertainly owes much to the
Stanford-Hoover connection.
/ strongly appeal to the' faculty spn
afe to table this petition as it so justly
deserves to be and to get on with
more important matters at hand.
