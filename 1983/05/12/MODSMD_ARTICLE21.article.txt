						point-by-point response to Hoover countercharges 
### 
Hoover is not a partisan political organization because it
does not take stands on political issues.
For evidence of Hoover's diverse political activities,
look first at the 1982 Annual Report of the Hoover Institu
tion, a document that could have been written by the
Republican National Committee. In it are no fewer than
five pictures of President Reagan together with Hoover
connected photographs of virtually the entire top lead
ership of the Reagan administration: Edwin Meese, Cas
par Weinberger, Donald Regan, William French Smith,
Philip Habib, former top domestic policy advisor Martin
Anderson (now returned to Hoover as a senior fellow)
and a number of others.
We all know that one way a research organization
participates in politics is by doing research for candi
dates. Does Hoover engage in this sort of activity, and, if
so, for whom?
Let Hoover Director Glenn Campbell and Reagan ad
dress these questions:
Reagan: "Under the leadership of your able director
Glenn Campbell, and with hard work and diligence, you
built the knowledge base that made the changes now
taking place in Washington possible." Said at a )an. 11,
1982 White House reception for the Hoover Board of
Overseers. (1982 Hoover Annual Report, p. 29.)
Campbell: "Since President Reagan took office on
January 20, 1981, more than 30 scholars and former fel
lows of the Hoover Institution have been requested to
participate in public service and have been appointed to
positions in the executive branch of the federal govern
ment or as members of boards and commissions." (1981
Hoover Annual Report, pp. 11-12.) Hoover has since
claimed more than 40 individual placements with the
administration and other branches of government.
As far as I know the Institute for Policy Studies, the
Brookings Institution and the American Enterprise Insti
tute let their individual members do as they please polit
ically. It would be shocking to learn that the officers of
any of these institutions told any one on the staff what to
write. Nor, as far as I know, do these institutions take
stands on issues. But can anyone seriously believe that
because these organizations don't take stands on issues,
they are not political? Or do not serve certain partisan
causes more than others? lust because these organiza
tions are comprised of individuals and do not take
stands on issues hardly makes them apolitical research
organizations. If anything, such apparent nonpartisan
ship probably enhances their effectiveness as
politically-inclined research organizations, just as is true
in Hoover's case.
Hoover is not a partisan political organization because
Hoover represents a diversity of views, and contains Demo
crats as well as Republicans.
No one would be so rash as to claim that everyone at
Hoover sees the world in exactly the same way, but there
is a great deal of evidence to suggest that Hoover is not
in fact mainly a pluralistic institution of diverse views
but an organization with a mission:
History: Was the Hoover Institution established to
engage in value-neutral research, or was it established to
defend and advocate certain values and policies? The
evidence here seems fairly decisive. As Herbert Hoover

put it in a 1959 declaration to the University Board of
Trustees:
"The purpose of this Institution must be, by its re
search and publications, to demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx — whether Communism,
Socialism, economic materialism or atheism — thus to
protect the American way of life from such ideologies,
their conspiracies and to reaffirm the validity of the
American system."
It is fashionable to dismiss Herbert Hoover's declara
tion as an unfortunate example of Cold War rhetoric but
a look at the Hoover Institution's activities and publica
tions since 1959 suggest that the Institution has re
mained quite faithful to its founder's design.
For example, Stanford Prof, of History Alexander Dal
lin, for seven years a Senior Fellow at Hoover and cur
rently chair of the University's international relations
program, told the Daily recently that he resigned from
Hoover because he perceived violations of academic
standards by an "inner sanctum" of conservative ac
tivists whom he was unable to influence from inside the
institution. (Daily, April 19)
The press has investigated the Hoover Institution reg
ularly, and if it is to be believed, Hoover has a quite
definite tilt. To cite only two examples:
— New York Times Magazine, July 23, 1978, Kenneth
Lamott: "Through its ties with the right wing of the
Republican Party, the Hoover Institution is exerting in
creasing political influence. It is the brightest star in a
small constellation of conservative think tanks that serve
as workshops where out of office intellectuals can fabri
cate the underpinnings of domestic and foreign-policy
positions for the Republicans."
— Los Angeles Times, Nov. 18, 1980, William Endicott:
"Throughout this campaign year, Reagan turned to
Hoover to provide intellectual substance for his conser
vative views on a broad range of domestic and interna
tional issues. Now, as he starts to shape a new adminis
tration, he is expected to lean heavily on the institution
for both personnel and policy advice."
It should be emphasized that even if Hoover were
better balanced politically the existence of any such
organization — radical left, right or middle — with ac
cess to millions of dollars in outside private funds,
would cause questions in an academic institution. The
central problem of Hoover is not its conservative bent,
but that it is bent at all.
Hoover is no more partisan or political than Harvard
during the Kennedy Presidency, so why all the fuss?
This argument also takes the form of noting how many
Stanford faculty have served Democratic administra
tions. Kennedy's role as the Food and Drug Administra
tion Commissioner under President Jimmy Carter is fre
quently cited.
Of all the arguments that have been put forward on
Hoover's behalf, this is probably the most effective. It
appeals to our sense of fair play: the government needs
all the help it can get, liberal professors help Democrats,
conservative Hoover people help Reagan, so what's the
difference?
There are three:
— Those professors who joined the Kennedy adminis

tration came from a variety of different departments at
Harvard, not from a central liberal think t.ink associated
with Harvard, and they did so as individuals, not as
members of a left-leaning equivalent to Hoover. There
was and is no Harvard equivalent to Hoover — no
Franklin Delano Roosevelt Institution with millions of
dollars in liberal endowment and private contributions
established especially to advance liberal political causes.
— No one has ever questioned the right of any indi
vidual faculty member or for that matter of any one at
Hoover to join the Reagan administration. What has
been questioned is the existence of a separate and
unique institution within Stanford University that is
largely autonomous from University control and en
gages in the kinds of overt politic al activities that Hoover
appears to pursue. Hoover can justly lay claim to being
one of the leading conservative think tanks in the coun
try, a situation not really comparable to the academic
brain trust around Kennedy or other libeial presidents.
— Let us for the sake of argument accept the Harvard
analogy. The questions that must then be faced are: (a)
Does the University want to become so closely con
nected to conservative donors and conservative politics
that it counter-balances I larvard's liberalism? (b) Do we
want to become a Republican counterweight to Har
vard's Democratic bias? (() Or do we want to maintain
our reputation for independence and nonpartianship?
There are dangers for a univei sitv that gets too close to
one particular political spt c tium Stanford retains con
siderable diversity, but if the Hoover Institution has, as
the press reports, a $t>o million endowment, at what
point does this "universitv" within the University raise
concern? Is there nothing especially troubling about
Hoover because a lot of Harvard professors worked for
Kennedy? Some think so Others are not so sure.
The problem with Hoover is net that it is too close to
Stanford but that it is not ( lose enough: we should therefore
increase joint appointments and further blur the lines
separating Hoover from the University.
The problem with this line of reasoning is that to the
extent that Hoover is a partisan politic al organization
and to the extent that the lines between it and the Uni
versity are blurred or obscured, Hoover's prestige and
influence are enhanc ed and so too the t auses for which
Hoover exists Or, to put it another way, the problem
with Hoover is that it has a < ause not that it is too far
removed organizationally from Stanford control.
The issue here is: can Stanford University, or any
university, atlord to !)■ c ome so c losely linked to certain
sources of money and to certain politic il interests that it
runs the danger of losing or appealing to lose its inde
pendent e and autonomy.' Some say Hoover just offsets
the liberal political bias of professors generally. This
position at least has the merit of admitting Hoover's
conservative bias but, again, such arguments miss the
central point: one cannot compare the Hoover Institu
tion, with its money and power and political leverage, to
some statistical tendencies for certain kinds of profes
sors to be more liberal than conservative. In my experi
ence at Stanford, conservatives are by no means unrep
resented in the departments — and certainly not so
much that we need an organization like Hoover to bal

ante us out.
As for efforts to diversify Hoover through joint ap
pointments and the like, consider Dallin's experience:
"There were people on the faculty side who thought the
only way to influence Hoover was to get a foot in the
door by piacing tenured faculty over there. I have come
to believe that will not work; you'll never change the
inner sanctum" (Daily, April 20, 1983).
Conclusion.
The San Francisco Examiner, in a May 8, 1983 news
article hy Carl Irvine, cautions us about Hoover in the
following words: "As the institution became widely
known for leadership that openly backed conservative
causes, endowment funds flowed in, reaching $f>o mil
lion earlier this year. "I he ratn of growth in support per
scholar far exceeded most other campus units in recent
years."
Hoover's budget this year is more than $8 million, and
tor next year it will exceed $9 million. Only about one
third of this money goes for the library and archive. The
rest goes for other activities.
What seems to have happened in the past 10 or 15
years is that Hoover has emerged as one of the leading
conservative think tanks in the country. Its endowment
exceeds that of many universities, and as a research
organization it enjoys many subsidies from Stanford.
Some people are not bothered by any of this. They
point out that Stanford has emerged as one of the lead
ing universities in the world, and ask: What is wrong
with an Institution that brings millions of dollars into the
University?
What is wrong is that Hoover does not bring millions
of dollars into the University. Most of the money goes to
Hoover. It is used to support activities that appear to
many observers to be political, partisan and objectiona
ble.
What is wrong with having such a well-endowed uni
versity within the University? Such funds obviously pro
vide some benefits to Stanford, and not all of Hoover's
work is political.
What is wrong concerns the nature of a university.
Although universities often fail to live up to their ideals,
they nonetheless have them. Among the core ideals are
nonpartisanship, objectivity and a rejection of overt
and covert political participation by the university.
If these ideals are to be upheld, can the Stanford
community ignore the existence of a $60 million re
search organization with'n its midst that openly engages
in a wide assortment of political activities? Perhaps. But
to do so endangers the University's reputation as a non
politic al, nonpartisan institution and thus endangers
I he most precious thing a great university has: its legiti
macy. Ihese are subtle issues. It is hard to measure
credibility and legitimacy. But if there is anything at all
valid in the concerns that have been raised about
I loover, perhaps it is tune for the University community
to look up and see what Hoover has become. The pic
ture of itself that Hoover projects to the outside world in
its Annual Reports and its multiple political ties is, and
must be of concern to the broader Stanford commu
nity.
