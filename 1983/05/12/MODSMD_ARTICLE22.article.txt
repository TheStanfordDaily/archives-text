# Grad students with kids facing increasing costs
## 
### CATHY JANUS 
Many students here are con
cerned with more than just
their studies: child-care is a
real problem for many of the
married students in Escondido
Village.
Most couples in the Village
already had one child before
beginning their graduate de
grees, said Pam Lagarche,
mother and director of the
Pepper-Tree After School Pro
gram.
They are at the age at which
they desire a family after hav
ing experienced the "real
world" and then decide to go
back to school, she said. "They
are in their 30s and if they are
going to have another child
they have to do it now."
She and her husband had
their first child in France. They
had no idea how expensive

child care is in the United
States, she said. "Costs are
phenomenal: both having a
child and then bringing it up."
in France, costs for prenatal
and post-artum as well as the
actual birth are free.
Coverage under the Student
Health Plan is very limited, she
said. When paying $100 per
month on Blue Shield, $500 of
the total cost of $3000 to have a
baby is paid.
Nevertheless, many couples
decide to have their second
child while finishing their
studies at Stanford, she said.
Faced with increasing living
expenses, Lagarche said that
one parent usually works and
child care is very much in de
mand.
"Child-care is an additional
financial burden for many stu
dents," she said, adding that

there are 500 children living in
Escondido who are less than
five years old. "There are very
few facilities on campus to ful
fill the child-care need, and the
issue is becoming more impor
tant as mothers need to work
due to increasing rents."
Fran Roth, director of the
Cnildcare Center of the Stan
ford Community, said child
care is a hardship for many
parents due to costly and very
limited space in the facilities.
There is a two-year waiting list,
she said.
"Women get on the list
when they find they are preg
nant and infant care is pro
vided beginning when babies
are one week old."
In the fall, Roth said approx
imately 50 new spaces will
open when new modules are
put up. There are currently 90
spaces in the three programs:
the Craig Infant Program, the
Lil' Kids Program and the Big
Kids Program.
The University does not
charge rent for the Lil' and Big
Kids Centers. But Roth said the
rent for the Craig Infant Pro
gram is quite costly. Next year
they plan to house all three
programs in the CCSC she
said.
At the centers, parents are
charged $2.50 per hour for in
fants and $1.67 per hour for
nine months through kinder
garten age. The money pays for
staff salaries, equipment,
supplies and maintenance.
Both centers are parent
cooperatives, Lagarche said.
"If staffing had to be done com
pletely by paid personnel our
fees would be higher.
Everyone with a child there
to put in a certain number of
hours a week or pay a slightly
higher fee. The number of
hours depends on the child's
age and the house spent
there." Ifachild isunder three

years of age and spends 45
hours a week at the program, a
parent owes seven hours of
classroom help.
Bing Nursery School also
provides day care, but for
many families the tuition is
"exhorbitant," said Director
Carol Youngholt. Graduate
students' children comprise 30
to 40 percent of the total, of
whom 10 percent are on finan
cial assistance.
Other child-care options in
clude Toddlers Treehouse, an
Escondido Village House, Es
condido Nursery School, and a
morning program for mothers
taking English as a second lan
guage, said Lagarche. Toddlers
Treehouse is for two- to three
year-olds during the morning
hours and kindergarten to
third grade from noon to 5:30
p.m.
"To facilitate child-care we try
to raise funds from alumni and
have projects," she said, ad
ding that cost: of living are in
creasing more than stiends and
grants. "It is absolutely manda
tory that funds come from
somewhere else."
"I chose Stanford in part be
cause they offered cheaper
housing," said Tom Lunz, a

graduate student in Modern
Thought and Literature. "In
general, I am very happy with
the fellowships and a number
of other incentives. It is a great
luxury to be able to do this at
all." Lutz is a married student
with three young children,
aged seven, four and 20
months. "Parents are on tight
budgets and rents are being
raised exhorbitantly." He said
his rent will almost double in
the time he has been here. "I
could practically live in Man
hattan," Lutz said.
"The rent increases are really
outrageous," said Denise
Perry, mother and electrical
engineering student. "Stu
dents, especially those from
out of state, feel the rates are
very high. In Pennsylvania we
lived in a three-bedroom
house which cost as much as
our two-bedroom apartment in
Escondido."
Norm Robinson, assoc. dean
of Residential Education, said
rents are increasing rea
sonably. "Rents are not being
made comparable with off
campus housing. Escondido is
still an incredibly good deal
with what you get in the com
munity." Robinson attributed

rent increases to rising utility,
overhead and salary costs, as
well as to the costs incurred
from new housing projects.
Lagarche said Escondido has
limited space for families. But
she said the location is safe for
children.
While the University will not
support child-care as a student
need per se, it is making provi
sions for child-care in the new
housing facilities. "They are
beginning to see the need,"
Lagarche said.
Families adapt to their in
creasing expenses in different
ways. Lutz said he will be un
able to finish his dissertation in
the Stanford area because of
financial difficulties and will go
back to Massachusetts. "I will
have poor access to my advis
ers and to my committee," he
said.
When Erica Pitre first mar
ried her high school
sweetheart, she went to
school. When she decided to
move to California to be with
her husband, a mechanical en
gineering student, she could
no longer afford to attend
school because they were not
residents. The Pitres have two
children, aged four and four

months, and Erica worked at
the Bookstore until her second
child was born. She said their
income includes loans, schol
arships, their parents contrib
utions and jobs she and her
husband have held.
The Perrys also met in high
school. "My husband finished
his education at Stanford and
then we got married," Denise
said. When they could no
longer afford child-care, De
nise said she stopped out and
took a year off. Now she re
ceives some financial assist
ance and said the University
took into account that she has
children. She studies when the
children take naps and after
they have gone to sleep for the
night. "After having them and
looking back they are the most
important things in my life,"
she said. "They give me a goal
to strive for."

child care is very much in de
mand.
"Child-care is an additional
financial burden for many stu
dents," she said, adding that

there are 500 children living in
Escondido who are less than
five years old. "There are very
few facilities on campus to ful
fill the child-care need, and the
issue is becoming more impor
tant as mothers need to work
due to increasing rents."
Fran Roth, director of the
Cnildcare Center of the Stan
ford Community, said child
care is a hardship for many
parents due to costly and very
limited space in the facilities.
There is a two-year waiting list,
she said.
"Women get on the list
when they find they are preg
nant and infant care is pro
vided beginning when babies
are one week old."
In the fall, Roth said approx
imately 50 new spaces will
open when new modules are
put up. There are currently 90
spaces in the three programs:
the Craig Infant Program, the
Lil' Kids Program and the Big
Kids Program.
The University does not
charge rent for the Lil' and Big
Kids Centers. But Roth said the
rent for the Craig Infant Pro
gram is quite costly. Next year
they plan to house all three
programs in the CCSC she
said.
At the centers, parents are
charged $2.50 per hour for in
fants and $1.67 per hour for
nine months through kinder
garten age. The money pays for
staff salaries, equipment,
supplies and maintenance.
Both centers are parent
cooperatives, Lagarche said.
"If staffing had to be done com
pletely by paid personnel our
fees would be higher.
Everyone with a child there
to put in a certain number of
hours a week or pay a slightly
higher fee. The number of
hours depends on the child's
age and the house spent
there." Ifachild isunder three

years of age and spends 45
hours a week at the program, a
parent owes seven hours of
classroom help.
Bing Nursery School also
provides day care, but for
many families the tuition is
"exhorbitant," said Director
Carol Youngholt. Graduate
students' children comprise 30
to 40 percent of the total, of
whom 10 percent are on finan
cial assistance.
Other child-care options in
clude Toddlers Treehouse, an
Escondido Village House, Es
condido Nursery School, and a
morning program for mothers
taking English as a second lan
guage, said Lagarche. Toddlers
Treehouse is for two- to three
year-olds during the morning
hours and kindergarten to
third grade from noon to 5:30
p.m.
"To facilitate child-care we try
to raise funds from alumni and
have projects," she said, ad
ding that cost: of living are in
creasing more than stiends and
grants. "It is absolutely manda
tory that funds come from
somewhere else."
"I chose Stanford in part be
cause they offered cheaper
housing," said Tom Lunz, a

graduate student in Modern
Thought and Literature. "In
general, I am very happy with
the fellowships and a number
of other incentives. It is a great
luxury to be able to do this at
all." Lutz is a married student
with three young children,
aged seven, four and 20
months. "Parents are on tight
budgets and rents are being
raised exhorbitantly." He said
his rent will almost double in
the time he has been here. "I
could practically live in Man
hattan," Lutz said.
"The rent increases are really
outrageous," said Denise
Perry, mother and electrical
engineering student. "Stu
dents, especially those from
out of state, feel the rates are
very high. In Pennsylvania we
lived in a three-bedroom
house which cost as much as
our two-bedroom apartment in
Escondido."
Norm Robinson, assoc. dean
of Residential Education, said
rents are increasing rea
sonably. "Rents are not being
made comparable with off
campus housing. Escondido is
still an incredibly good deal
with what you get in the com
munity." Robinson attributed

rent increases to rising utility,
overhead and salary costs, as
well as to the costs incurred
from new housing projects.
Lagarche said Escondido has
limited space for families. But
she said the location is safe for
children.
While the University will not
support child-care as a student
need per se, it is making provi
sions for child-care in the new
housing facilities. "They are
beginning to see the need,"
Lagarche said.
Families adapt to their in
creasing expenses in different
ways. Lutz said he will be un
able to finish his dissertation in
the Stanford area because of
financial difficulties and will go
back to Massachusetts. "I will
have poor access to my advis
ers and to my committee," he
said.

ried her high school
sweetheart, she went to

move to California to be with
her husband, a mechanical en

no longer afford to attend
school because they were not

children, aged four and four

months, and Erica worked at
the Bookstore until her second

said. When they could no

took a year off. Now she re
ceives some financial assist

took into account that she has
children. She studies when the
children take naps and after
they have gone to sleep for the

she said. "They give me a goal

Many students here are con
cerned with more than just
their studies: child-care is a
real problem for many of the
married students in Escondido
Village.
Most couples in the Village
already had one child before
beginning their graduate de
grees, said Pam Lagarche,
mother and director of the
Pepper-Tree After School Pro
gram.
They are at the age at which
they desire a family after hav
ing experienced the "real
world" and then decide to go
back to school, she said. "They
are in their 30s and if they are
going to have another child
they have to do it now."
She and her husband had
their first child in France. They
had no idea how expensive

child care is in the United
States, she said. "Costs are
phenomenal: both having a
child and then bringing it up."
in France, costs for prenatal
and post-artum as well as the
actual birth are free.
Coverage under the Student
Health Plan is very limited, she
said. When paying $100 per
month on Blue Shield, $500 of
the total cost of $3000 to have a
baby is paid.
Nevertheless, many couples
decide to have their second
child while finishing their
studies at Stanford, she said.
