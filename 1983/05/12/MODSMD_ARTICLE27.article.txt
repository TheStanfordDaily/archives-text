## Roxy Music re-formed is still doing Ferry well, thanks 
### PAUL IRVIN 
Roxy Music
Oakland Auditorium
7 May 1983

I recall, not too long ago, listening to a
gold-chained, silk-shirted Deejay describe
Bryan Ferry as a "vacuous excuse for a rock
and roll star." We all know what happened
to disco, but what of Ferry and his creation,
Roxy Music? Well, it's been a long time since
Roxy's beginnings and certainly there have
been some changes. We're talking here
about a band that once inflicted audiences
with pompadour hairdos, insane synthe
sizer solos and songs about infatuations with
plastic dolls.
Roxy Music has had its share of fits and
starts; eventually, in the late '70s the band
broke up, each member splitting off to pur
sue solo careers. Brian Eno, one of the main
creative forces of the band, had left long
before and was continuing his brand of art
rock experimentalism with a variety of musi
cians.
Andy MacKay produced a few lackluster
albums, and Phil Manzanera, one of the best
and most energetic members of the band,
continued adding to his notoriety with y his
contribution to 801, a band made up of the
cream of the pop avant-garde.
Surprisingly, the star of this story, Bryan
Ferry, this crooner, this Bing Crosby of the
modern age, faded into the background. In
the years that Roxy Music was separated,
Ferry produced a handful of albums, most of
which were hardly worth listening to, even

to the most die-hard of Roxy fans. Filled with
cover tunes and rehashes of earlier Roxy
Music songs, his most popular achievement
was a version of "Take Me to the River,"
released, oddly enough, right on the heels
of the Talking Heads' version.
Basically, the band's members, out on
their own, seemed to lack the creativity that
they achieved together, as seems to be the
case for most groups when they become
disillusioned with themselves after a long
career. However, unlike most broken-up
bands, Roxy Music re-formed, although

without Manzanera. It seemed to take the
group a while to find their feet again, releas
ing such uninspired albums as Manifesto
and its pop release Dance Away. Not until
recently, with Avalon, and the subsequent
return of Manzanera to the band, did fans
think that Roxy would ever regain their old
magic.
Well, last Saturday night at the Oakland
Auditorium, Bryan Ferry showed a packed
house that he and his band are indeed back
with the same sophistication, style and sheer
power that has brought many a twisted smile

to the faces of longtime Roxy Music listen
ers. The music has changed some in style but
not the feeling. Ferry is and always will be a
hapless romantic, writing love songs ranging
from the hopelessly soppy, such as "Senti
mental Fool" and "Chance Meeting," to the
satirically flip, as in "2 HB," an ode to Bogart.
Lately the group has developed a deep,
sophisticated sound, dreamy and deliber
ate. To some this change from the elemental
sound of their early efforts seemed too
smooth, too packaged. However, Ferry has
always played the sophisticate, and their

new music shows the evolution from their
early violent rock-pop to the cultured sound
that shows, without the posing of the past,
the romanticism of Ferry's music.
Throughout the concert, with the addition
of an incredible light and stage design, Roxy
played selections drawn from their entire
career, with an occasional acknowledge
ment from Ferry to the "aficionados" out in
the audience. Backed by the Sirens (two
females, asusual,along witha male vocalist!)
Koxy brought out such favorites as "Editions
of You," "A Song For Europe," and (with a
chilling solo by the band's woodwind spe
cialist, Andy MacKay) "Seabreezes," as well
as most of their newest album.
Roxy's two-man percussion section set up
a powerful beat to each song, ranging from
the slow rhythms which Ferry continually
danced with, to the slamming cadence
heard in songs like their encore, a longtime
show-stopper, "Do the Strand." Manzanera
took charge during the instrumentals, taking
on both the back-up guitar and the bass in an
electrifying "chord contest." Ferry played
conductor to each song, taking the pace up
or down according to the mood of the audi
ence who, despite the security crew's ef
forts, crowded the stage and exploded into
fervent applause as each song ended. In
fact, nearly half the songs played earned
standing ovations from the crowd.
In the end, Bryan Ferry proved that even
ing that Roxy Music is back in earnest, as
good as ever, confident that wherever they
play, there will be fans old and new who will
remember the effects of Roxy Music.

cialist, Andy MacKay) "Seabreezes," as well
as most of their newest album.
Roxy's two-man percussion section set up
a powerful beat to each song, ranging from
the slow rhythms which Ferry continually
danced with, to the slamming cadence
heard in songs like their encore, a longtime
show-stopper, "Do the Strand." Manzanera
took charge during the instrumentals, taking
on both the back-up guitar and the bass in an
electrifying "chord contest." Ferry played
conductor to each song, taking the pace up
or down according to the mood of the audi
ence who, despite the security crew's ef
forts, crowded the stage and exploded into
fervent applause as each song ended. In
fact, nearly half the songs played earned
standing ovations from the crowd.
In the end, Bryan Ferry proved that even
ing that Roxy Music is back in earnest, as
good as ever, confident that wherever they
play, there will be fans old and new who will
remember the effects of Roxy Music.

Roxy Music
Oakland Auditorium
7 May 1983

I recall, not too long ago, listening to a
gold-chained, silk-shirted Deejay describe
Bryan Ferry as a "vacuous excuse for a rock
and roll star." We all know what happened
to disco, but what of Ferry and his creation,
Roxy Music? Well, it's been a long time since
Roxy's beginnings and certainly there have
been some changes. We're talking here
about a band that once inflicted audiences
with pompadour hairdos, insane synthe
sizer solos and songs about infatuations with
plastic dolls.
Roxy Music has had its share of fits and
starts; eventually, in the late '70s the band
broke up, each member splitting off to pur
sue solo careers. Brian Eno, one of the main
creative forces of the band, had left long
before and was continuing his brand of art
rock experimentalism with a variety of musi
cians.
Andy MacKay produced a few lackluster
albums, and Phil Manzanera, one of the best
and most energetic members of the band,
continued adding to his notoriety with y his
contribution to 801, a band made up of the
cream of the pop avant-garde.
Surprisingly, the star of this story, Bryan
Ferry, this crooner, this Bing Crosby of the
modern age, faded into the background. In
the years that Roxy Music was separated,
Ferry produced a handful of albums, most of
which were hardly worth listening to, even

to the most die-hard of Roxy fans. Filled with
cover tunes and rehashes of earlier Roxy
Music songs, his most popular achievement
was a version of "Take Me to the River,"
released, oddly enough, right on the heels
of the Talking Heads' version.
Basically, the band's members, out on
their own, seemed to lack the creativity that
they achieved together, as seems to be the
case for most groups when they become
disillusioned with themselves after a long
career. However, unlike most broken-up
bands, Roxy Music re-formed, although

without Manzanera. It seemed to take the
group a while to find their feet again, releas
ing such uninspired albums as Manifesto
and its pop release Dance Away. Not until
recently, with Avalon, and the subsequent
return of Manzanera to the band, did fans
think that Roxy would ever regain their old
magic.
Well, last Saturday night at the Oakland
Auditorium, Bryan Ferry showed a packed
house that he and his band are indeed back
with the same sophistication, style and sheer
power that has brought many a twisted smile

to the faces of longtime Roxy Music listen
ers. The music has changed some in style but
not the feeling. Ferry is and always will be a
hapless romantic, writing love songs ranging
from the hopelessly soppy, such as "Senti
mental Fool" and "Chance Meeting," to the
satirically flip, as in "2 HB," an ode to Bogart.
Lately the group has developed a deep,
sophisticated sound, dreamy and deliber
ate. To some this change from the elemental
sound of their early efforts seemed too
smooth, too packaged. However, Ferry has
always played the sophisticate, and their

new music shows the evolution from their
early violent rock-pop to the cultured sound
that shows, without the posing of the past,
the romanticism of Ferry's music.
Throughout the concert, with the addition
of an incredible light and stage design, Roxy
played selections drawn from their entire
career, with an occasional acknowledge
ment from Ferry to the "aficionados" out in
the audience. Backed by the Sirens (two
females, asusual,along witha male vocalist!)
Koxy brought out such favorites as "Editions
of You," "A Song For Europe," and (with a
chilling solo by the band's woodwind spe
cialist, Andy MacKay) "Seabreezes," as well
as most of their newest album.
