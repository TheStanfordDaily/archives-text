# Appeal, Holdup: moral dilemmas come to stage
## 
### MARC FAJER 
Mass Appeal
Theatre on the Square

At a time when the role of the
church in shaping moral and
political thought is constantly
in the news, the appearance of
a play dealing with the ethical
dilemmas of the Catholic
Church in modern society
seems particularly approp
riate. Mass Appeal, which
comes to San Francisco after a
recent successful run in New
York, examines the proper
place of religion and morality
in our world with wit and com
passion and raises some im
portant questions about the
church and its practitioners.
Milo O'Shea fills the stage
for an entire evening in his role
as a popular parish priest con
fronted with a troubling young
seminarian. He cheerfully
drinks, lies, and goes to the
races, yet has moral vision
enough to be very concerned
with the problems created by
the young radical. Shaun Cas
sidy (yes, the Shaun Cassidy)
manages to overcome his oc
casional lapses into terminal
cuteness to give a very interest
ing portrayal of the seminarian.
The basic problem that
Mark, the seminarian, has is
that he is unable to keep his
mouth shut and to play politics
long enough to become a
priest. He objects violently
when two classmates are

kicked out ot the seminary for
homosexual activity, tells the
congregation in no uncertain
terms what he thinks of their
ties to material possessions,
and finally confesses a bisexual
past to the head of the semi
nary. The older priest is, in the
meantime, trying to educate
him to the realities of caring for
people who don't want reli
gion to interfere too much with
their lives. Sermons must be
related to everyday life; Mark
is instructed to talk about jelly
doughnuts and tropical fish to
make the people listen to him.
Condolences must be kept
"simple and stupid" â€” it is
more important to have a
soothing voice than real ad
vice.
As the play progresses, we
see a growing void between
the moral ideas that Mark
stands for and wishes to pre
ach, and the actual practice of
the church. The awareness of
this eventually leads the priest
to a moral choice of his own:
whether or not to risk the care
fully guarded love of his
parishioners in order to defend
Mark. O'Shea does a fine job
making the difficulty of the
choice apparent.
Lest I leave the impression
that this is a long moral tirade, I
emphasize that author Bill
Davis has written a very funny,
as well as very intellectually in
teresting play. Director Geral
dine Fitzgerald does very well

also in letting the play speak tor
itself and not over
emphasizing the ethical ques
tions. David Gropman's set,
imported from the Broadway
production cleverly empha
sizes the themes of the show.
Mass Appeal plays at Theatre
on the Square just off Union
Square through |une 12. It is
certainly the best thing that I
have seen in San Francisco this
year, and provides an enter
taining and stimulating even
ing of theater.
The Holdup
ACT
Marsha Norman's The Hol
dup, which is ACT's last pro
duction this season, also deals
with moral dilemmas in a
changing society. The action,
however, takes place in New
Mexico in 1914, at the tail end
of the mythic old west. An old
outlaw, played by Peter Donat,
has returned to meet an old
flame, a former madam who
now runs a respectable hotel
(Barbara Dirickson). They
choose to meet at an old cook
shack outside of town which is
presently inhabited by two
brothers. The eldest, Henry
(Lawrence Hecht) is an almost
stereotypical nasty cowpoke
(he cheated at egghunt when
he was a child) except for his
obsession with the old out
laws. He can recite information

and statistics on each rather
the way a baseball tanatic can.
His younger brother Archie
(Tom O'Brien) is a young, self
righteous kid who is annoying
and appealing by turns. His
confidence in his own moral
vision is touching in its naivete,
and a bit frightening as it be
comes clear that this is the sort
of mind that will run America
for much of the 60 years after
the play ends.
The performances are all
quite good. Donat adds a dash
of intelligence to the outlaw
which makes him more in
teresting and less of a
stereotype than he could have
been. He spends much of his
live wandering around leading
people on and encouraging
them to shoot at him so that he
can draw faster and kill them.
He claims to be doing this in
hopes that he will lose some
day, yet it is clear that part of
the older morality that he rep
resents approves of trapping
people who don't know better.
Dirickson is charming, as al
ways, if not quite old enough,
as the woman the outlaw re
turns for. She disapproves of
his games and wants him to set
tle down and marry her. O'
Brien is adequate as the over
eager Archie; it is not clear
whether he doesn't ring true
on occasion because of his act
ing or his lines, but there are
definitely moments when he is

hard to take. Still, he has a nice
earnestness about him the rest
of the time, and his scenes
alone with Dirickson in the
second act are quite nice.
Hecht is fine as the older
brother; he certainly has the
nasty sneer down pat.
The play has quite a few very
funny moments. After Henry
predictably gets killed off, the
outlaw offers his money to Ar
chie, who complains that it
won't do any good. The outlaw
quips, " Henry's dead, here's
$40,000' sounds better than
just Henry's dead.' " The fun
eral oration over Henry is also
hysterical, and includes a
wonderful description of
heaven and hell being just hav
ing to be in a room with a lot of
people just like yourself.
Unfortunately, whether due
to Norman's writing, or Edward
Hastings' directing, the mes
sage of the play is muddy. If we
are supposed to like Archie as
he goes bravely off to save the
world, there are too many
times that he is obnoxious. On
the other hand, it seems fairly
clear that the morality of the
old west, whatever that was,
was no great shakes either.
Still, the play is a lot of fun to
watch, and has a few interest
ing twists that set it apart from
most western-type drama. It
has the advantage of two fine
performances by Peter Donat
and Barbara Dirickson, who, as
in Uncle Vanya earlier this year,
are wonderful together.
