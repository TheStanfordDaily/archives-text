# Alvin Lee proves that the '60s were no fluke
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
For anyone who has ever seen the
rock film Woodstock, one of the most
memorable moments captured was an
intense bluesy stomper by some hot
shot guitarist named Alvin Lee. Lee and
his band, Ten Years After, were caught
blazing through the nine-minute mons
ter "I'm Going Home," and instantly
the band was an underground sensa
tion. Like the majority of '60s bands
with flashy guitarists, Lee and Ten Years
After had originated in Britain after
Cream had made blues-derived rock a
viable (and quite profitable) genus of
music. They managed to putouta string
of powerhouse albums like Sssh,
Cricklewood Green, and Watt, that are
all tragically out of print. By the early
'70s, though, the band disbanded, and
Lee went on to a sporadic, undistin
guished solo career.
Lee rarely toured during the years fol
lowing Ten Year After's breakup, so the
announcement for Alvin Lee (and "Ten
Years Later") at the Stone in San Fran
cisco came as a pleasant surprise.
Likewise, it must have been a pleasant
surprise to a lot more people than just
myself, because there was a throng of
fans who packed into the Stone to wit
ness if Lee could recapture any of the

adept prowess that he had so clearly
demonstrated at Woodstock.
To the delight (or should I say hys
teria) of the crowd, Lee produced
exactly what he was remembered for —
kinetic, sexually driven guitar rave-ups.
Looking as lusty as ever (besides the
slightly added weight in his mid
section), Lee re-established himself as a
solid, yet manic instrumentalist. With a
very efficient band (which just con
sisted of a bassist and drummer), Lee
romped through his best known num
bers (such as "Love Like a Man" and
"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl"),
along with doing some '50s standards
("Sweet Little Sixteen") and blues
workouts. Altogether, he proved that
his appearance at Woodstock was not a
fluke.
Coming out to an extremely drunken
Frisco crowd, Lee and his band burst
into a rambunctious version of one of
his more popular bluesy tunes, called
"One Of These Days," and never let
up. Sporting a guitar that had to be
dated back to circa 1969 with its peace,
love and Woodstock stickers, Lee thor
oughly entertained the crowd with a
taste of the days when guitar solos were
thought to be mysterious wonders
conceived by the gods. By the third

song, "Good Morning Little School
girl," Lee had the crowd up on their feet
as he displayed his first extended guitar
improvisation. On this number, Lee
exhibited the finesse and showmanship
that would dominate his guitar solos
throughout the night. Though his flash
and speed were simply mind-boggling,
Lee always remembered to keep the
music as the main focal point of the
show.
This obvious concern with the musi
cal quality of his show was the major
difference between watching a great
guitarist, like Lee, and watching a poor
imitator, like any of the faceless
heavy-metal guitarists in such bands as
Styx, Foreigner and Triumph. For Lee, it
is the musicianship first, and the flash
(meaning the fancy finger-work, the
feed-back distortions, the banging of
the guitar on the microphone stand,
etc.) are only extras that enhance the
visual portion of the show. However,
the majority of the heavy-metal
guitarists (and I use the term
"guitarists" with much reserve) only
concentrate on the flashy, showy as
pects of the guitar •
Lee's musicianship went beyond any
categorical definition. He played in a
variety of styles, from bluesy rockers

(like his own "Love Like a Man"), to
Chuck Berry riffings (like "Choo Choo
Mama"), to frenzied rave-ups (as in an
extremely well received version of the
'60s standard "Hey |oe," made popular
by Hendrix).
However, throughout all of his
songs, no matter how worthy they
were, the rowdy audience continually
shouted for "I'm Going Home." Lee,
therefore, teased the crowd and their
cries for this song by sprinkling the set
with short little five-second snippets
from the classic song. Finally giving in,
Lee fulfilled the crowd's wishes, and
treated them to an exact replica of the
song to close the set. Looking, sound
ing, and grunting exactly as at
Woodstock, I for one forgot that this
was only the Stone.
For me, along with the rest of the
audience, it was 14 years earlier with
over half a million bouncing along to
this foot-stomper. It was, of course,
only a momentary trip back into the
past glories of rock and roll history, yet
it was to Lee's credit that he did indeed
bring this magic back after all these
years. And to tell you the truth, a little
more magic like the type that Lee dis
played, would help the music industry
indefinitely.

love and Woodstock stickers, Lee thor
oughly entertained the crowd with a
taste of the days when guitar solos were
thought to be mysterious wonders
conceived by the gods. By the third

song, "Good Morning Little School
girl," Lee had the crowd up on their feet
as he displayed his first extended guitar
improvisation. On this number, Lee
exhibited the finesse and showmanship
that would dominate his guitar solos
throughout the night. Though his flash
and speed were simply mind-boggling,
Lee always remembered to keep the
music as the main focal point of the
show.
This obvious concern with the musi
cal quality of his show was the major
difference between watching a great
guitarist, like Lee, and watching a poor
imitator, like any of the faceless
heavy-metal guitarists in such bands as
Styx, Foreigner and Triumph. For Lee, it
is the musicianship first, and the flash
(meaning the fancy finger-work, the
feed-back distortions, the banging of
the guitar on the microphone stand,
etc.) are only extras that enhance the
visual portion of the show. However,
the majority of the heavy-metal
guitarists (and I use the term
"guitarists" with much reserve) only
concentrate on the flashy, showy as
pects of the guitar •
Lee's musicianship went beyond any
categorical definition. He played in a
variety of styles, from bluesy rockers

(like his own "Love Like a Man"), to
Chuck Berry riffings (like "Choo Choo
Mama"), to frenzied rave-ups (as in an
extremely well received version of the
'60s standard "Hey |oe," made popular
by Hendrix).
However, throughout all of his
songs, no matter how worthy they
were, the rowdy audience continually
shouted for "I'm Going Home." Lee,
therefore, teased the crowd and their
cries for this song by sprinkling the set
with short little five-second snippets
from the classic song. Finally giving in,
Lee fulfilled the crowd's wishes, and
treated them to an exact replica of the
song to close the set. Looking, sound
ing, and grunting exactly as at
Woodstock, I for one forgot that this
was only the Stone.
For me, along with the rest of the
audience, it was 14 years earlier with
over half a million bouncing along to
this foot-stomper. It was, of course,
only a momentary trip back into the
past glories of rock and roll history, yet
it was to Lee's credit that he did indeed
bring this magic back after all these
years. And to tell you the truth, a little
more magic like the type that Lee dis
played, would help the music industry
indefinitely.
For anyone who has ever seen the
rock film Woodstock, one of the most
memorable moments captured was an
intense bluesy stomper by some hot
shot guitarist named Alvin Lee. Lee and
his band, Ten Years After, were caught
blazing through the nine-minute mons
ter "I'm Going Home," and instantly
the band was an underground sensa
tion. Like the majority of '60s bands
with flashy guitarists, Lee and Ten Years
After had originated in Britain after
Cream had made blues-derived rock a
viable (and quite profitable) genus of
music. They managed to putouta string
of powerhouse albums like Sssh,
Cricklewood Green, and Watt, that are
all tragically out of print. By the early
'70s, though, the band disbanded, and
Lee went on to a sporadic, undistin
guished solo career.
Lee rarely toured during the years fol
lowing Ten Year After's breakup, so the
announcement for Alvin Lee (and "Ten
Years Later") at the Stone in San Fran
cisco came as a pleasant surprise.
Likewise, it must have been a pleasant
surprise to a lot more people than just
myself, because there was a throng of
fans who packed into the Stone to wit
ness if Lee could recapture any of the

adept prowess that he had so clearly
demonstrated at Woodstock.
To the delight (or should I say hys
teria) of the crowd, Lee produced
exactly what he was remembered for —
kinetic, sexually driven guitar rave-ups.
Looking as lusty as ever (besides the
slightly added weight in his mid
section), Lee re-established himself as a
solid, yet manic instrumentalist. With a
very efficient band (which just con
sisted of a bassist and drummer), Lee
romped through his best known num
bers (such as "Love Like a Man" and
"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl"),
along with doing some '50s standards
("Sweet Little Sixteen") and blues
workouts. Altogether, he proved that
his appearance at Woodstock was not a
fluke.
Coming out to an extremely drunken
Frisco crowd, Lee and his band burst
into a rambunctious version of one of
his more popular bluesy tunes, called
"One Of These Days," and never let
up. Sporting a guitar that had to be
dated back to circa 1969 with its peace,
love and Woodstock stickers, Lee thor
oughly entertained the crowd with a
taste of the days when guitar solos were
thought to be mysterious wonders
conceived by the gods. By the third
