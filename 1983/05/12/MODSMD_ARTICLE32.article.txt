Scared shirtless
If you don't come in and sign up
for a Daily t-shirt by Friday, jan will
forever have you scared shirtless. Al
though we don't know exactly what it
will look like, Mark Wilson promises
it will be a fune one — and it won't
have too many ducks.
Cold turkey
The Softball game against the PjFs
will take place on Sunday at scenic
Wilbur Field at 11 p.m. We have de
cided to give the old folks a break
and enter the game cold turkey. In
other words, the practice has been
canceled. See you Sunday and batter
up!
