A group of researchers from Stan
ford and Utah State University, in
coordination with a team from the
University of Tokyo, will meet in
White Sands, New Mexico, on May
14 to launch a rocket into the farthest
layer of the earth's atmosphere as a
forerunner of future space shuttle
flights. They will test the effects of a
beam of electrons in "jello-like"
plasma.
The sounding rocket, officially
called an ionospheric explorer, will
be sent to an altitude of up to 150
miles in a flight lasting approximately
nine minutes.
During the experiment,
nicknamed CHARGE (Cooperative
High Altitude Rocket Gun Experi
ment), a beam of electrons will be
emitted from an electron gun. Their
activities will be monitored on, a
mong other equipment, a processor
and an antenna-like electrodynamic
tether.
Unlike many in the past, the exper
iment is an active one, rather than
passive, and takes place in a dual
part process. An electron is emitted
from one end, the "mother", while
another is picked up on the electri
cally connected "daughter."
Co-investigator Peter Banks said
the object will "analyze the physics
of studying the current from one end
to the other." The ionosphere is the
closest thing to natural plasma.
Aside from its applications for the
Aeronautics Department, the ionos
phere experiment is perhaps most
important in its application to future
shuttle flights. "The explorer will be
a precursor to the 1987 shuttle, a
scaled-down mimic of missions in
the future," explained Banks.
No similar experiment has been
conducted in the past. "The biggest
problem will be in collecting current
and generating the low-frequency
radio waves," Banks said, because
"we do not know how to yet."
