### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
Israelis will have to move out of the
West Rank for any settlement with
the Palestinians to be possible, ac
cording to Shlomo Avineri, former
director-general of Israel's Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.
"There will be those who feel
badly because they're losing a part of
the historical land," Avineri said. But
he stressed that only through com
promise could peace be ac hieved.

Avineri, now a professor of politi
cal science at the Hebrew University
of lerusalem, spoke last night on "Is
rael and the Palestinians" in kresge
Auditorium.
Avineri spoke primarily about the
conflict's background and the issues
behind it. He said constant media
coverage of the conflict has made the
world aware of the situation but can
hide the basic issue in a "maze of
details."
"Other international conflicts

come and go, hut we are still on the
front pages," he said.
According to Avineri, the main fal
lacy about the nature of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict is that it is a con
flict between Western and Eastern
powers. "This crisis has not been
polarized on an East-West axis," Av
ineri said, explaining that Soviet,
French, English and American loyal
ties have shifted several times in the
past few decades.
