House approves Salvadoran aid
Washington — The House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee approved a compromise aid package yesterday
for El Salvador that would cut off U.S. military as
sistance if the Salvadoran government balks at uncon
ditional talks with leftist guerrillas.
The vote was 36-1. The dissenter was Rep. George
Crockett (D-Mich.) who said he opposed military as
sistance in Central America or elsewhere.
It was the second time in two days that a con
gressional committee had voted to curb President
Reagan's proposal to help the Salvadoran govern
ment fight off a leftist insurrection that has lasted
more than three years.
tOn Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Commi

tee approved $76 million in Salvadoran military aid
this year and the same amount next year. The Reagan
administration asked $110 million for this year, on top
of $26 million appropriated in January, and $86 mil
lion for fiscal 1984 starting Oct. 1.
The House committee approved $65 million for
next year and the same amount for fiscal 1985, with $5
million each year earmarked for medical suppliesand
$10 million a year for training outside El Salvador. The
committee had voted earlier to deny any additional
military assistance to El Salvador this year.
The House bill would halt all military assistance af
ter 90 days of congressional enactment if the
Salvadoran government had not entered uncondi
tional talks with the guerrillas, unless the government
could show it was thwarted by a leftist refusal to talk.

Unconditional negotiations have been a key issue
in sparring between the administration and Congress
over Salvadoran aid. The administration wants any
talks limited to arrangements for forthcoming elec
tions. Liberal Democrats argue that the Salvadoran
factions should sit down at the bargaining table
without limiting their options.
House passes loan program
Washington — House Democrats overrode solid
Republican opposition yesterday to pass a $760 mil
lion program of emergency loans to tide over
thousands of unemployed Americans behind on their
mortgages and in danger of losing their homes.
The measure was attacked by the administration

and Republicans as too costly and cumbersome and
unnecessary in a recovering economy.
An early test vote on a Republican-sponsored
amendment to strike major provisions from the bill
was an omen of the outcome. Democrats fought off a
string of less damaging but still weakening Re
publican amendments before the final vote.
The vote defeating the key amendment was 220-197
and for final passage 216-196. A similar bill is pending
in the Senate, and if it passes there, differences would
have to be ironed out by a conference committee of
the two houses.
The amendment would have stripped the fore
closure part of the bill of its vital parts except for one
directing federal banking regulators to make it easier
