House approves Salvadoran aid
Washington — The House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee approved a compromise aid package yesterday
for El Salvador that would cut off U.S. military as
sistance if the Salvadoran government balks at uncon
ditional talks with leftist guerrillas.
The vote was 36-1. The dissenter was Rep. George
Crockett (D-Mich.) who said he opposed military as
sistance in Central America or elsewhere.
It was the second time in two days that a con
gressional committee had voted to curb President
Reagan's proposal to help the Salvadoran govern
ment fight off a leftist insurrection that has lasted
more than three years.
tOn Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Commi

tee approved $76 million in Salvadoran military aid
this year and the same amount next year. The Reagan
administration asked $110 million for this year, on top
of $26 million appropriated in January, and $86 mil
lion for fiscal 1984 starting Oct. 1.
The House committee approved $65 million for
next year and the same amount for fiscal 1985, with $5
million each year earmarked for medical suppliesand
$10 million a year for training outside El Salvador. The
committee had voted earlier to deny any additional
military assistance to El Salvador this year.
The House bill would halt all military assistance af
ter 90 days of congressional enactment if the
Salvadoran government had not entered uncondi
tional talks with the guerrillas, unless the government
could show it was thwarted by a leftist refusal to talk.

Unconditional negotiations have been a key issue
in sparring between the administration and Congress
over Salvadoran aid. The administration wants any
talks limited to arrangements for forthcoming elec
tions. Liberal Democrats argue that the Salvadoran
factions should sit down at the bargaining table
without limiting their options.
House passes loan program
Washington — House Democrats overrode solid
Republican opposition yesterday to pass a $760 mil
lion program of emergency loans to tide over
thousands of unemployed Americans behind on their
mortgages and in danger of losing their homes.
The measure was attacked by the administration

and Republicans as too costly and cumbersome and
unnecessary in a recovering economy.
An early test vote on a Republican-sponsored
amendment to strike major provisions from the bill
was an omen of the outcome. Democrats fought off a
string of less damaging but still weakening Re
publican amendments before the final vote.
The vote defeating the key amendment was 220-197
and for final passage 216-196. A similar bill is pending
in the Senate, and if it passes there, differences would
have to be ironed out by a conference committee of
the two houses.
The amendment would have stripped the fore
closure part of the bill of its vital parts except for one
directing federal banking regulators to make it easier
for lending institutions to be forbearing on delin
quent home loans.
The amendment did not attempt to touch a section
authorizing $100 million in emergency assistance for
the homeless, to be distributed through local govern
ments.
The bill contains a number of provisions designed
to target the program to people of modest means who
face loss of their homes because they have lost their
jobs.
People who got loans under the program would be
required to kick in 38 percent of whatever income
they had toward monthly housing expenses with the
government loans covering the balance.
A lien would be held by the government to insure
repayment of the so-called bridge loans, which would
carry a maximum 10 percent interest rate and would
have to be repaid within the same time period as the
original mortgage.
The Senate legislation, not expected to reach the
floor before June at the earliest, would have a similar
impact on the homeowner but involve no direct fed
eral outlays.
Instead, it would set up a program under which the
emergency loans would be issued by private lenders
and backed by the government, in much the same
way FHA and VA loans are already handled.
The administration also opposes the Senate bill.
House votes to free funds for MX
Washington — With President Reagan promising to
change the U.S. stance on nuclear arms negotiations
with the Soviet Union, a key House panel voted yes
terday to free funds for the controversial MX missile
that looms as a bargaining chip in the critical talks.
The 9-3 vote by the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee came after Reagan told congressional
critics in a letter that he would undertake a "com
prehensive" review of arms control proposals and
urged at the same time approval for deploying the MX
missile.
Reagan also said at the White House that he sup
ports the "build-down" concept calling for the the
United States and the Soviets to destroy two nuclear
warheads for each new one deployed.
He replied "the concept — yes" when asked if he
agreed with the idea, but then he added: "I think
there are some things that have to be worked out. It
isn't as simple as it sounds, in order to achieve equal
ity."
He said of the build-down idea, "Yes, that is some
thing we very definitely will look at."
Spokesman Larry Speakes said later Reagan was
"very pleased" by the vote, but he predicted a vote
today on the same issue in the Appropriations Com
mittee would be "much more difficult."
The House subcommittee voted to approve spend
ing $560 million for research, development and flight
testing of the 10-warhead MX missile the adminis
tration says is needed to upgrade America's atomic
arsenal and win Soviet concessions at the bargaining
table.

The money was appropriated by the House last De
cember, but the Pentagon was banned from spending
it until a basing plan for the missile was approved.
EPA releases internal study
Washington — The Environmental Protection
Agency, conceding its $1.6 billion "superfund" pro
gram was not effectively managed, recommended
major policy changes yesterday to speed emergency
cleanup and end bureaucratic wrangling.
The agency, in an internal study, charged that a sec
tion of the superfund law that provides for emer
gency cleanup of imminent hazards to human health
had been "drastically underutilized." It also said
cleanups were delayed because of infighting and a
lack of trust in regional officials.
The report estimated that as many as half the 419
dumps listed as the worst in the country could qualify
for these emergency removals if EPA would only com
mit funds to them.
The internal review, based on interviews with 60
EPA employees, echoed criticisms of the troubled
program which members of Congress and environ
mentalists have been voicing for months.
The study was undertaken at the direction of Anne
Burford, who resigned as EPA administrator in March
under pressure of multiplying congressional in
vestigations, many of which focused on the super
fund program.
The internal EPA report does not address two of the
primary subjects of the congressional probes: that
cleanup decisions were influenced by politics and
that settlement agreements favored polluting in
dustries.
West makes progress at meeting
Paris — The Western industrialized nations ended
two days of economic talks Tuesday that reflected a
conciliatory spirit but failed to banish some fun
damental differences, especially between the United
States and France.
The ministerial meeting of the 24-nation Organiza
tion for Economic Cooperation and Development —
OECD — managed to agree on a more flexible ap
proach toward a non-inflationary recovery and
avoided the divisiveness that has hampered recent
economic relations.
For some of the foreign, trade and finance ministers
the conference was setting the stage for the seven-na
tion economic summit meeting that opens May 28 in
Williamsburg, Virginia.
On the final day, French Finance Minister Jacques
Delors renewed an appeal for more accommodating
fiscal and monetary policies while U.S. Treasury Sec
retary Donald Regan stuck by his commitment to the
fight on inflation.
Regan gave a dinner Tuesday night for the trade
and finance ministers, but the French boycotted the
affair, saying it interfered with preparations for the
Williamsburg summit.
Secretary of State George Shultz declared himself
pleased with the conference results, telling reporters,
"A consensus is taking shape."

He termed the atmosphere "healthier" than at last
November's meeting of members of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that was marked by
open conflict.
The ministers approved a final communique saying
OECD members should "reverse protectionist trends
and relax and dismantle progressively trade restric
tions and trade-distorting domestic measures."
It said the participants also agreed on the need for
further efforts to "sustain a supply of finance" to
hard-pressed developing countries.
The communique reported the ministersagreed in
flation had to be controlled to provide "growing
room" for their nations' economies and established
separate guidelines for low-inflation, medium-infla
tion and high-inflation countries.
The ministers gave their full support to President
Reagan's efforts to reduce budget deficits, which U.S.
officials have said are the key to lower interest rates
and a lower dollar.
Shamir predicts pact-signing
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir told
Parliament yesterday the troop withdrawal pact with
Lebanon will be signed soon but that Israel will be
free to act in its own interests if the Syrians and PLO
refuse to leave Lebanon.
Shamir said the pact "will be signed in the coming
days by Israel and Lebanon with the participation of
the U.S. government." He called the United States "a
full partner" in the accord which Secretary of State
George Shultz worked out in two weeks of Middle
East shuttle diplomacy.
But if Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion do not match Israel's agreement to withdraw,
Shamir said that "the agreement will be considered
suspended. Israel will be free to act as it sees fit and
according to its interests."
Shamir's statement to the Knesset, Israel's Par
liament, pre-empted an opposition bid to force an
immediate vote on the agreement. The vote will be
held next Monday, when the pact may already have
been signed.
Opposition Labor Party leader Shimon Peres sharp
ly attacked the government for its handling of the
Lebanon war and of the negotiations. Israeli forces
have been in Lebanon since invading June 6 to smash
the PLO. The Syrians have been in Lebanon since
snuffing out the 1975-76 civil war.
Governor suggests loophole'
Sacramento — Governor Deukmejian proposed a
$466 million "tax loophole" package yesterday in
cluding $222 million in new sales taxes on consumers.
The Republican governor's proposal was im
mediately criticized by the Republican leader of the
Assembly, who said it was a tax increase, no matter
what Deukmejian called it. But it was praised by a
leading fiscal spokesmen of Assembly Democrats.
The plan would also raise an extra $134 million an
nually in property taxes, $80 million more from faster
collection of withholding taxes from businesses, $25
million in horseracing taxes and $5 million by

eliminating the remaining income tax deductions for
gasoline taxes.
Deukmejian also proposed another $24 million in
spending cuts and the sale of $33 million worth of ex
cess state property.
He said most of the exira money will be needed to
cover rising Medi-Cal, welfare and local school costs,
which are now estimated at $261 million more than es
timated in the $25 billion budget Deukmejian pro
posed earlier this year.
Exit permission denied Sakharov
Moscow — The Kremlin said yesterday it will not
permit dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov to leave
the Soviet Union because his work in developing the
Soviet hydrogen bomb made him privy to state se
crets.
The human rights activist's wife Yelena Bonner said
hours earlier that he was willing to leave the country.
After the Kremlin announcement, she appealed to
the West for pressure on the Soviet government to
free the Nobel Peace Prize winner, and said she
feared government agents would kill him.
Sakharov, 61, has been exiled in the Volga River city
of Gorky for more than three years. His wife returned
to the couple's Moscow apartment yesterday morn
ing and spoke to Western reporters. Foreigners are
not permitted to travel to Gorky.
The announcement through the official news agen
cy Tass that Sakharov would not be allowed to leave
the Soviet Union said it was "the sovereign right of
any state" to deny exit permission for national secur
ity reasons.
Mrs. Sakharov, a 59-year-old physician, became vis
ibly agitated after reading the Tass announcement,
handed to her by an Associated Press reporter.
"Hal" she said. "He'll be simply killed. Really, he'll
be killed ... They can enter this flat and put a pillow
over his face and kill him and say he died of a heart
attack. And any Soviet doctor would sign the autopsy
She did not elaborate on her fear. Last year, how
ever, she reported that unidentified men assaulted
Sakharov, knocked him out with a chemical sub
stance and stole his scientific research papers.
Stocks fall
The stock market staged a broad retreat from rec
ord heights yesterday as traders cashed in on the
nine-month rally.
"I don't think you can expect the market to go up
day after day after day," said analyst Raymond DeVoe
at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 1.45
Tuesday, fell 9.96 to 1219.72. The blue-chip average
had edged up early in the day, closing in on the rec
ord high of 1232.59 of last Friday.
Today's weather
Fair today, becoming partly cloudy tonight and
tomorrow. Highs in the 60s and 70s. Northwest winds
10-20 miles per hour this afternoon and evening.

arsenal and win Soviet concessions at the bargaining
table.

The money was appropriated by the House last De
cember, but the Pentagon was banned from spending
it until a basing plan for the missile was approved.
EPA releases internal study
Washington — The Environmental Protection
Agency, conceding its $1.6 billion "superfund" pro
gram was not effectively managed, recommended
major policy changes yesterday to speed emergency
cleanup and end bureaucratic wrangling.
The agency, in an internal study, charged that a sec
tion of the superfund law that provides for emer
gency cleanup of imminent hazards to human health
had been "drastically underutilized." It also said
cleanups were delayed because of infighting and a
lack of trust in regional officials.
The report estimated that as many as half the 419
dumps listed as the worst in the country could qualify
for these emergency removals if EPA would only com
mit funds to them.
The internal review, based on interviews with 60
EPA employees, echoed criticisms of the troubled
program which members of Congress and environ
mentalists have been voicing for months.
The study was undertaken at the direction of Anne
Burford, who resigned as EPA administrator in March
under pressure of multiplying congressional in
vestigations, many of which focused on the super
fund program.
The internal EPA report does not address two of the
primary subjects of the congressional probes: that
cleanup decisions were influenced by politics and
that settlement agreements favored polluting in
dustries.
West makes progress at meeting
Paris — The Western industrialized nations ended
two days of economic talks Tuesday that reflected a
conciliatory spirit but failed to banish some fun
damental differences, especially between the United
States and France.
The ministerial meeting of the 24-nation Organiza
tion for Economic Cooperation and Development —
OECD — managed to agree on a more flexible ap
proach toward a non-inflationary recovery and
avoided the divisiveness that has hampered recent
economic relations.
For some of the foreign, trade and finance ministers
the conference was setting the stage for the seven-na
tion economic summit meeting that opens May 28 in
Williamsburg, Virginia.
On the final day, French Finance Minister Jacques
Delors renewed an appeal for more accommodating
fiscal and monetary policies while U.S. Treasury Sec
retary Donald Regan stuck by his commitment to the
fight on inflation.
Regan gave a dinner Tuesday night for the trade
and finance ministers, but the French boycotted the
affair, saying it interfered with preparations for the
Williamsburg summit.
Secretary of State George Shultz declared himself
pleased with the conference results, telling reporters,
"A consensus is taking shape."

He termed the atmosphere "healthier" than at last
November's meeting of members of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that was marked by
open conflict.
The ministers approved a final communique saying
OECD members should "reverse protectionist trends
and relax and dismantle progressively trade restric
tions and trade-distorting domestic measures."
It said the participants also agreed on the need for
further efforts to "sustain a supply of finance" to
hard-pressed developing countries.
The communique reported the ministersagreed in
flation had to be controlled to provide "growing
room" for their nations' economies and established
separate guidelines for low-inflation, medium-infla
tion and high-inflation countries.
The ministers gave their full support to President
Reagan's efforts to reduce budget deficits, which U.S.
officials have said are the key to lower interest rates
and a lower dollar.
Shamir predicts pact-signing
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir told
Parliament yesterday the troop withdrawal pact with
Lebanon will be signed soon but that Israel will be
free to act in its own interests if the Syrians and PLO
refuse to leave Lebanon.
Shamir said the pact "will be signed in the coming
days by Israel and Lebanon with the participation of
the U.S. government." He called the United States "a
full partner" in the accord which Secretary of State
George Shultz worked out in two weeks of Middle
East shuttle diplomacy.
But if Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion do not match Israel's agreement to withdraw,
Shamir said that "the agreement will be considered
suspended. Israel will be free to act as it sees fit and
according to its interests."
Shamir's statement to the Knesset, Israel's Par
liament, pre-empted an opposition bid to force an
immediate vote on the agreement. The vote will be
held next Monday, when the pact may already have
been signed.
Opposition Labor Party leader Shimon Peres sharp
ly attacked the government for its handling of the
Lebanon war and of the negotiations. Israeli forces
have been in Lebanon since invading June 6 to smash
the PLO. The Syrians have been in Lebanon since
snuffing out the 1975-76 civil war.
Governor suggests loophole'
Sacramento — Governor Deukmejian proposed a
$466 million "tax loophole" package yesterday in
cluding $222 million in new sales taxes on consumers.
The Republican governor's proposal was im
mediately criticized by the Republican leader of the
Assembly, who said it was a tax increase, no matter
what Deukmejian called it. But it was praised by a
leading fiscal spokesmen of Assembly Democrats.
The plan would also raise an extra $134 million an
nually in property taxes, $80 million more from faster
collection of withholding taxes from businesses, $25
million in horseracing taxes and $5 million by

eliminating the remaining income tax deductions for
gasoline taxes.
Deukmejian also proposed another $24 million in
spending cuts and the sale of $33 million worth of ex
cess state property.
He said most of the exira money will be needed to
cover rising Medi-Cal, welfare and local school costs,
which are now estimated at $261 million more than es
timated in the $25 billion budget Deukmejian pro
posed earlier this year.
Exit permission denied Sakharov
Moscow — The Kremlin said yesterday it will not
permit dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov to leave
the Soviet Union because his work in developing the
Soviet hydrogen bomb made him privy to state se
crets.
The human rights activist's wife Yelena Bonner said
hours earlier that he was willing to leave the country.
After the Kremlin announcement, she appealed to
the West for pressure on the Soviet government to
free the Nobel Peace Prize winner, and said she
feared government agents would kill him.
Sakharov, 61, has been exiled in the Volga River city
of Gorky for more than three years. His wife returned
to the couple's Moscow apartment yesterday morn
ing and spoke to Western reporters. Foreigners are
not permitted to travel to Gorky.
The announcement through the official news agen
cy Tass that Sakharov would not be allowed to leave
the Soviet Union said it was "the sovereign right of
any state" to deny exit permission for national secur
ity reasons.
Mrs. Sakharov, a 59-year-old physician, became vis
ibly agitated after reading the Tass announcement,
handed to her by an Associated Press reporter.
"Hal" she said. "He'll be simply killed. Really, he'll
be killed ... They can enter this flat and put a pillow
over his face and kill him and say he died of a heart
attack. And any Soviet doctor would sign the autopsy
She did not elaborate on her fear. Last year, how
ever, she reported that unidentified men assaulted
Sakharov, knocked him out with a chemical sub
stance and stole his scientific research papers.
Stocks fall
The stock market staged a broad retreat from rec
ord heights yesterday as traders cashed in on the
nine-month rally.
"I don't think you can expect the market to go up
day after day after day," said analyst Raymond DeVoe
at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 1.45
Tuesday, fell 9.96 to 1219.72. The blue-chip average
had edged up early in the day, closing in on the rec
ord high of 1232.59 of last Friday.

House approves Salvadoran aid
Washington — The House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee approved a compromise aid package yesterday
for El Salvador that would cut off U.S. military as
sistance if the Salvadoran government balks at uncon
ditional talks with leftist guerrillas.
The vote was 36-1. The dissenter was Rep. George
Crockett (D-Mich.) who said he opposed military as
sistance in Central America or elsewhere.
It was the second time in two days that a con
gressional committee had voted to curb President
Reagan's proposal to help the Salvadoran govern
ment fight off a leftist insurrection that has lasted
more than three years.
tOn Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Commi

tee approved $76 million in Salvadoran military aid
this year and the same amount next year. The Reagan
administration asked $110 million for this year, on top
of $26 million appropriated in January, and $86 mil
lion for fiscal 1984 starting Oct. 1.
The House committee approved $65 million for
next year and the same amount for fiscal 1985, with $5
million each year earmarked for medical suppliesand
$10 million a year for training outside El Salvador. The
committee had voted earlier to deny any additional
military assistance to El Salvador this year.
The House bill would halt all military assistance af
ter 90 days of congressional enactment if the
Salvadoran government had not entered uncondi
tional talks with the guerrillas, unless the government
could show it was thwarted by a leftist refusal to talk.

Unconditional negotiations have been a key issue
in sparring between the administration and Congress
over Salvadoran aid. The administration wants any
talks limited to arrangements for forthcoming elec
tions. Liberal Democrats argue that the Salvadoran
factions should sit down at the bargaining table
without limiting their options.
House passes loan program
Washington — House Democrats overrode solid
Republican opposition yesterday to pass a $760 mil
lion program of emergency loans to tide over
thousands of unemployed Americans behind on their
mortgages and in danger of losing their homes.
The measure was attacked by the administration

and Republicans as too costly and cumbersome and
unnecessary in a recovering economy.
An early test vote on a Republican-sponsored
amendment to strike major provisions from the bill
was an omen of the outcome. Democrats fought off a
string of less damaging but still weakening Re
publican amendments before the final vote.
The vote defeating the key amendment was 220-197
and for final passage 216-196. A similar bill is pending
in the Senate, and if it passes there, differences would
have to be ironed out by a conference committee of
the two houses.
The amendment would have stripped the fore
closure part of the bill of its vital parts except for one
directing federal banking regulators to make it easier
for lending institutions to be forbearing on delin
quent home loans.
The amendment did not attempt to touch a section
authorizing $100 million in emergency assistance for
the homeless, to be distributed through local govern
ments.
The bill contains a number of provisions designed
to target the program to people of modest means who
face loss of their homes because they have lost their
jobs.
People who got loans under the program would be
required to kick in 38 percent of whatever income
they had toward monthly housing expenses with the
government loans covering the balance.
A lien would be held by the government to insure
repayment of the so-called bridge loans, which would
carry a maximum 10 percent interest rate and would
have to be repaid within the same time period as the
original mortgage.
The Senate legislation, not expected to reach the
floor before June at the earliest, would have a similar
impact on the homeowner but involve no direct fed
eral outlays.
Instead, it would set up a program under which the
emergency loans would be issued by private lenders
and backed by the government, in much the same
way FHA and VA loans are already handled.
The administration also opposes the Senate bill.
House votes to free funds for MX
Washington — With President Reagan promising to
change the U.S. stance on nuclear arms negotiations
with the Soviet Union, a key House panel voted yes
terday to free funds for the controversial MX missile
that looms as a bargaining chip in the critical talks.
The 9-3 vote by the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee came after Reagan told congressional
critics in a letter that he would undertake a "com
prehensive" review of arms control proposals and
urged at the same time approval for deploying the MX
missile.
Reagan also said at the White House that he sup
ports the "build-down" concept calling for the the
United States and the Soviets to destroy two nuclear
warheads for each new one deployed.
He replied "the concept — yes" when asked if he
agreed with the idea, but then he added: "I think
there are some things that have to be worked out. It
isn't as simple as it sounds, in order to achieve equal
ity."
He said of the build-down idea, "Yes, that is some
thing we very definitely will look at."
Spokesman Larry Speakes said later Reagan was
"very pleased" by the vote, but he predicted a vote
today on the same issue in the Appropriations Com
mittee would be "much more difficult."
The House subcommittee voted to approve spend
ing $560 million for research, development and flight
testing of the 10-warhead MX missile the adminis
tration says is needed to upgrade America's atomic
arsenal and win Soviet concessions at the bargaining
table.

The money was appropriated by the House last De
cember, but the Pentagon was banned from spending
it until a basing plan for the missile was approved.

gasoline taxes.
Deukmejian also proposed another $24 million in
spending cuts and the sale of $33 million worth of ex
cess state property.
He said most of the exira money will be needed to
cover rising Medi-Cal, welfare and local school costs,
which are now estimated at $261 million more than es
timated in the $25 billion budget Deukmejian pro
posed earlier this year.
Exit permission denied Sakharov
Moscow — The Kremlin said yesterday it will not
permit dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov to leave
the Soviet Union because his work in developing the
Soviet hydrogen bomb made him privy to state se
crets.
The human rights activist's wife Yelena Bonner said
hours earlier that he was willing to leave the country.
After the Kremlin announcement, she appealed to
the West for pressure on the Soviet government to
free the Nobel Peace Prize winner, and said she
feared government agents would kill him.
Sakharov, 61, has been exiled in the Volga River city
of Gorky for more than three years. His wife returned
to the couple's Moscow apartment yesterday morn
ing and spoke to Western reporters. Foreigners are
not permitted to travel to Gorky.
The announcement through the official news agen
cy Tass that Sakharov would not be allowed to leave
the Soviet Union said it was "the sovereign right of
any state" to deny exit permission for national secur
ity reasons.
Mrs. Sakharov, a 59-year-old physician, became vis
ibly agitated after reading the Tass announcement,
handed to her by an Associated Press reporter.
"Hal" she said. "He'll be simply killed. Really, he'll
be killed ... They can enter this flat and put a pillow
over his face and kill him and say he died of a heart
attack. And any Soviet doctor would sign the autopsy
She did not elaborate on her fear. Last year, how
ever, she reported that unidentified men assaulted
Sakharov, knocked him out with a chemical sub
stance and stole his scientific research papers.

House approves Salvadoran aid
Washington — The House Foreign Affairs Commit
tee approved a compromise aid package yesterday
for El Salvador that would cut off U.S. military as
sistance if the Salvadoran government balks at uncon
ditional talks with leftist guerrillas.
The vote was 36-1. The dissenter was Rep. George
Crockett (D-Mich.) who said he opposed military as
sistance in Central America or elsewhere.
It was the second time in two days that a con
gressional committee had voted to curb President
Reagan's proposal to help the Salvadoran govern
ment fight off a leftist insurrection that has lasted
more than three years.
tOn Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Commi

tee approved $76 million in Salvadoran military aid
this year and the same amount next year. The Reagan
administration asked $110 million for this year, on top
of $26 million appropriated in January, and $86 mil
lion for fiscal 1984 starting Oct. 1.
The House committee approved $65 million for
next year and the same amount for fiscal 1985, with $5
million each year earmarked for medical suppliesand
$10 million a year for training outside El Salvador. The
committee had voted earlier to deny any additional
military assistance to El Salvador this year.
The House bill would halt all military assistance af
ter 90 days of congressional enactment if the
Salvadoran government had not entered uncondi
tional talks with the guerrillas, unless the government
could show it was thwarted by a leftist refusal to talk.

Unconditional negotiations have been a key issue
in sparring between the administration and Congress
over Salvadoran aid. The administration wants any
talks limited to arrangements for forthcoming elec
tions. Liberal Democrats argue that the Salvadoran
factions should sit down at the bargaining table
without limiting their options.
House passes loan program
Washington — House Democrats overrode solid
Republican opposition yesterday to pass a $760 mil
lion program of emergency loans to tide over
thousands of unemployed Americans behind on their
mortgages and in danger of losing their homes.
The measure was attacked by the administration

and Republicans as too costly and cumbersome and
unnecessary in a recovering economy.
An early test vote on a Republican-sponsored
amendment to strike major provisions from the bill
was an omen of the outcome. Democrats fought off a
string of less damaging but still weakening Re
publican amendments before the final vote.
The vote defeating the key amendment was 220-197
and for final passage 216-196. A similar bill is pending
in the Senate, and if it passes there, differences would
have to be ironed out by a conference committee of
the two houses.
The amendment would have stripped the fore
closure part of the bill of its vital parts except for one
directing federal banking regulators to make it easier
for lending institutions to be forbearing on delin
quent home loans.
The amendment did not attempt to touch a section
authorizing $100 million in emergency assistance for
the homeless, to be distributed through local govern
ments.
The bill contains a number of provisions designed
to target the program to people of modest means who
face loss of their homes because they have lost their
jobs.
People who got loans under the program would be
required to kick in 38 percent of whatever income
they had toward monthly housing expenses with the
government loans covering the balance.
A lien would be held by the government to insure
repayment of the so-called bridge loans, which would
carry a maximum 10 percent interest rate and would
have to be repaid within the same time period as the
original mortgage.
The Senate legislation, not expected to reach the
floor before June at the earliest, would have a similar
impact on the homeowner but involve no direct fed
eral outlays.
Instead, it would set up a program under which the
emergency loans would be issued by private lenders
and backed by the government, in much the same
way FHA and VA loans are already handled.
The administration also opposes the Senate bill.
House votes to free funds for MX
Washington — With President Reagan promising to
change the U.S. stance on nuclear arms negotiations
with the Soviet Union, a key House panel voted yes
terday to free funds for the controversial MX missile
that looms as a bargaining chip in the critical talks.
The 9-3 vote by the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee came after Reagan told congressional
critics in a letter that he would undertake a "com
prehensive" review of arms control proposals and
urged at the same time approval for deploying the MX
missile.
Reagan also said at the White House that he sup
ports the "build-down" concept calling for the the
United States and the Soviets to destroy two nuclear
warheads for each new one deployed.
He replied "the concept — yes" when asked if he
agreed with the idea, but then he added: "I think
there are some things that have to be worked out. It
isn't as simple as it sounds, in order to achieve equal
ity."
He said of the build-down idea, "Yes, that is some
thing we very definitely will look at."
Spokesman Larry Speakes said later Reagan was
"very pleased" by the vote, but he predicted a vote
today on the same issue in the Appropriations Com
mittee would be "much more difficult."
The House subcommittee voted to approve spend
ing $560 million for research, development and flight
testing of the 10-warhead MX missile the adminis
tration says is needed to upgrade America's atomic
arsenal and win Soviet concessions at the bargaining
table.

The money was appropriated by the House last De
cember, but the Pentagon was banned from spending
it until a basing plan for the missile was approved.
EPA releases internal study
Washington — The Environmental Protection
Agency, conceding its $1.6 billion "superfund" pro
gram was not effectively managed, recommended
major policy changes yesterday to speed emergency
cleanup and end bureaucratic wrangling.
The agency, in an internal study, charged that a sec
tion of the superfund law that provides for emer
gency cleanup of imminent hazards to human health
had been "drastically underutilized." It also said
cleanups were delayed because of infighting and a
lack of trust in regional officials.
The report estimated that as many as half the 419
dumps listed as the worst in the country could qualify
for these emergency removals if EPA would only com
mit funds to them.
The internal review, based on interviews with 60
EPA employees, echoed criticisms of the troubled
program which members of Congress and environ
mentalists have been voicing for months.
The study was undertaken at the direction of Anne
Burford, who resigned as EPA administrator in March
under pressure of multiplying congressional in
vestigations, many of which focused on the super
fund program.
The internal EPA report does not address two of the
primary subjects of the congressional probes: that
cleanup decisions were influenced by politics and
that settlement agreements favored polluting in
dustries.
West makes progress at meeting
Paris — The Western industrialized nations ended
two days of economic talks Tuesday that reflected a
conciliatory spirit but failed to banish some fun
damental differences, especially between the United
States and France.
The ministerial meeting of the 24-nation Organiza
tion for Economic Cooperation and Development —
OECD — managed to agree on a more flexible ap
proach toward a non-inflationary recovery and
avoided the divisiveness that has hampered recent
economic relations.
For some of the foreign, trade and finance ministers
the conference was setting the stage for the seven-na
tion economic summit meeting that opens May 28 in
Williamsburg, Virginia.
On the final day, French Finance Minister Jacques
Delors renewed an appeal for more accommodating
fiscal and monetary policies while U.S. Treasury Sec
retary Donald Regan stuck by his commitment to the
fight on inflation.
Regan gave a dinner Tuesday night for the trade
and finance ministers, but the French boycotted the
affair, saying it interfered with preparations for the
Williamsburg summit.
Secretary of State George Shultz declared himself
pleased with the conference results, telling reporters,
"A consensus is taking shape."

He termed the atmosphere "healthier" than at last
November's meeting of members of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that was marked by
open conflict.
The ministers approved a final communique saying
OECD members should "reverse protectionist trends
and relax and dismantle progressively trade restric
tions and trade-distorting domestic measures."
It said the participants also agreed on the need for
further efforts to "sustain a supply of finance" to
hard-pressed developing countries.
The communique reported the ministersagreed in
flation had to be controlled to provide "growing
room" for their nations' economies and established
separate guidelines for low-inflation, medium-infla
tion and high-inflation countries.
The ministers gave their full support to President
Reagan's efforts to reduce budget deficits, which U.S.
officials have said are the key to lower interest rates
and a lower dollar.
Shamir predicts pact-signing
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir told
Parliament yesterday the troop withdrawal pact with
Lebanon will be signed soon but that Israel will be
free to act in its own interests if the Syrians and PLO
refuse to leave Lebanon.
Shamir said the pact "will be signed in the coming
days by Israel and Lebanon with the participation of
the U.S. government." He called the United States "a
full partner" in the accord which Secretary of State
George Shultz worked out in two weeks of Middle
East shuttle diplomacy.
But if Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion do not match Israel's agreement to withdraw,
Shamir said that "the agreement will be considered
suspended. Israel will be free to act as it sees fit and
according to its interests."
Shamir's statement to the Knesset, Israel's Par
liament, pre-empted an opposition bid to force an
immediate vote on the agreement. The vote will be
held next Monday, when the pact may already have
been signed.
Opposition Labor Party leader Shimon Peres sharp
ly attacked the government for its handling of the
Lebanon war and of the negotiations. Israeli forces
have been in Lebanon since invading June 6 to smash
the PLO. The Syrians have been in Lebanon since
snuffing out the 1975-76 civil war.
Governor suggests loophole'
Sacramento — Governor Deukmejian proposed a
$466 million "tax loophole" package yesterday in
cluding $222 million in new sales taxes on consumers.
The Republican governor's proposal was im
mediately criticized by the Republican leader of the
Assembly, who said it was a tax increase, no matter
what Deukmejian called it. But it was praised by a
leading fiscal spokesmen of Assembly Democrats.
The plan would also raise an extra $134 million an
nually in property taxes, $80 million more from faster
collection of withholding taxes from businesses, $25
million in horseracing taxes and $5 million by

eliminating the remaining income tax deductions for
gasoline taxes.
Deukmejian also proposed another $24 million in
spending cuts and the sale of $33 million worth of ex
cess state property.
He said most of the exira money will be needed to
cover rising Medi-Cal, welfare and local school costs,
which are now estimated at $261 million more than es

in the Senate, and if it passes there, differences would
have to be ironed out by a conference committee of
the two houses.
The amendment would have stripped the fore
closure part of the bill of its vital parts except for one
directing federal banking regulators to make it easier
for lending institutions to be forbearing on delin
quent home loans.
The amendment did not attempt to touch a section
authorizing $100 million in emergency assistance for
the homeless, to be distributed through local govern
ments.
The bill contains a number of provisions designed
to target the program to people of modest means who
face loss of their homes because they have lost their
jobs.
People who got loans under the program would be
required to kick in 38 percent of whatever income
they had toward monthly housing expenses with the
government loans covering the balance.
A lien would be held by the government to insure
repayment of the so-called bridge loans, which would
carry a maximum 10 percent interest rate and would
have to be repaid within the same time period as the
original mortgage.
The Senate legislation, not expected to reach the
floor before June at the earliest, would have a similar
impact on the homeowner but involve no direct fed
eral outlays.
Instead, it would set up a program under which the
emergency loans would be issued by private lenders
and backed by the government, in much the same
way FHA and VA loans are already handled.
The administration also opposes the Senate bill.
House votes to free funds for MX
Washington — With President Reagan promising to
change the U.S. stance on nuclear arms negotiations
with the Soviet Union, a key House panel voted yes
terday to free funds for the controversial MX missile
that looms as a bargaining chip in the critical talks.
The 9-3 vote by the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee came after Reagan told congressional
critics in a letter that he would undertake a "com
prehensive" review of arms control proposals and
urged at the same time approval for deploying the MX
missile.
Reagan also said at the White House that he sup
ports the "build-down" concept calling for the the
United States and the Soviets to destroy two nuclear
warheads for each new one deployed.
He replied "the concept — yes" when asked if he
agreed with the idea, but then he added: "I think
there are some things that have to be worked out. It
isn't as simple as it sounds, in order to achieve equal
ity."
He said of the build-down idea, "Yes, that is some
thing we very definitely will look at."
Spokesman Larry Speakes said later Reagan was
"very pleased" by the vote, but he predicted a vote
today on the same issue in the Appropriations Com
mittee would be "much more difficult."
The House subcommittee voted to approve spend
ing $560 million for research, development and flight
testing of the 10-warhead MX missile the adminis
tration says is needed to upgrade America's atomic
arsenal and win Soviet concessions at the bargaining
table.

The money was appropriated by the House last De
cember, but the Pentagon was banned from spending
it until a basing plan for the missile was approved.
EPA releases internal study
Washington — The Environmental Protection
Agency, conceding its $1.6 billion "superfund" pro
gram was not effectively managed, recommended
major policy changes yesterday to speed emergency
cleanup and end bureaucratic wrangling.
The agency, in an internal study, charged that a sec
tion of the superfund law that provides for emer
gency cleanup of imminent hazards to human health
had been "drastically underutilized." It also said
cleanups were delayed because of infighting and a
lack of trust in regional officials.
The report estimated that as many as half the 419
dumps listed as the worst in the country could qualify
for these emergency removals if EPA would only com
mit funds to them.
The internal review, based on interviews with 60
EPA employees, echoed criticisms of the troubled
program which members of Congress and environ
mentalists have been voicing for months.
The study was undertaken at the direction of Anne
Burford, who resigned as EPA administrator in March
under pressure of multiplying congressional in
vestigations, many of which focused on the super
fund program.
The internal EPA report does not address two of the
primary subjects of the congressional probes: that
cleanup decisions were influenced by politics and
that settlement agreements favored polluting in
dustries.
West makes progress at meeting
Paris — The Western industrialized nations ended
two days of economic talks Tuesday that reflected a
conciliatory spirit but failed to banish some fun
damental differences, especially between the United
States and France.
The ministerial meeting of the 24-nation Organiza
tion for Economic Cooperation and Development —
OECD — managed to agree on a more flexible ap
proach toward a non-inflationary recovery and
avoided the divisiveness that has hampered recent
economic relations.
For some of the foreign, trade and finance ministers
the conference was setting the stage for the seven-na
tion economic summit meeting that opens May 28 in
Williamsburg, Virginia.
On the final day, French Finance Minister Jacques
Delors renewed an appeal for more accommodating
fiscal and monetary policies while U.S. Treasury Sec
retary Donald Regan stuck by his commitment to the
fight on inflation.
Regan gave a dinner Tuesday night for the trade
and finance ministers, but the French boycotted the
affair, saying it interfered with preparations for the
Williamsburg summit.
Secretary of State George Shultz declared himself
pleased with the conference results, telling reporters,
"A consensus is taking shape."

He termed the atmosphere "healthier" than at last
November's meeting of members of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that was marked by
open conflict.
The ministers approved a final communique saying
OECD members should "reverse protectionist trends
and relax and dismantle progressively trade restric
tions and trade-distorting domestic measures."
It said the participants also agreed on the need for
further efforts to "sustain a supply of finance" to
hard-pressed developing countries.
The communique reported the ministersagreed in
flation had to be controlled to provide "growing
room" for their nations' economies and established
separate guidelines for low-inflation, medium-infla
tion and high-inflation countries.
The ministers gave their full support to President
Reagan's efforts to reduce budget deficits, which U.S.
officials have said are the key to lower interest rates
and a lower dollar.
Shamir predicts pact-signing
Jerusalem — Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir told
Parliament yesterday the troop withdrawal pact with
Lebanon will be signed soon but that Israel will be
free to act in its own interests if the Syrians and PLO
refuse to leave Lebanon.
Shamir said the pact "will be signed in the coming
days by Israel and Lebanon with the participation of
the U.S. government." He called the United States "a
full partner" in the accord which Secretary of State
George Shultz worked out in two weeks of Middle
East shuttle diplomacy.
But if Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion do not match Israel's agreement to withdraw,
Shamir said that "the agreement will be considered
suspended. Israel will be free to act as it sees fit and
according to its interests."
Shamir's statement to the Knesset, Israel's Par
liament, pre-empted an opposition bid to force an
immediate vote on the agreement. The vote will be
held next Monday, when the pact may already have
been signed.
Opposition Labor Party leader Shimon Peres sharp
ly attacked the government for its handling of the
Lebanon war and of the negotiations. Israeli forces
have been in Lebanon since invading June 6 to smash
the PLO. The Syrians have been in Lebanon since
snuffing out the 1975-76 civil war.
Governor suggests loophole'
Sacramento — Governor Deukmejian proposed a
$466 million "tax loophole" package yesterday in
cluding $222 million in new sales taxes on consumers.
The Republican governor's proposal was im
mediately criticized by the Republican leader of the
Assembly, who said it was a tax increase, no matter
what Deukmejian called it. But it was praised by a
leading fiscal spokesmen of Assembly Democrats.
The plan would also raise an extra $134 million an
nually in property taxes, $80 million more from faster
collection of withholding taxes from businesses, $25
million in horseracing taxes and $5 million by

eliminating the remaining income tax deductions for
gasoline taxes.
Deukmejian also proposed another $24 million in
spending cuts and the sale of $33 million worth of ex
cess state property.
He said most of the exira money will be needed to
cover rising Medi-Cal, welfare and local school costs,
which are now estimated at $261 million more than es
timated in the $25 billion budget Deukmejian pro
posed earlier this year.
Exit permission denied Sakharov
Moscow — The Kremlin said yesterday it will not
permit dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov to leave
the Soviet Union because his work in developing the
Soviet hydrogen bomb made him privy to state se
crets.
The human rights activist's wife Yelena Bonner said
hours earlier that he was willing to leave the country.
After the Kremlin announcement, she appealed to
the West for pressure on the Soviet government to
free the Nobel Peace Prize winner, and said she
feared government agents would kill him.
Sakharov, 61, has been exiled in the Volga River city
of Gorky for more than three years. His wife returned
to the couple's Moscow apartment yesterday morn
ing and spoke to Western reporters. Foreigners are
not permitted to travel to Gorky.
The announcement through the official news agen
cy Tass that Sakharov would not be allowed to leave
the Soviet Union said it was "the sovereign right of
any state" to deny exit permission for national secur
ity reasons.
Mrs. Sakharov, a 59-year-old physician, became vis
ibly agitated after reading the Tass announcement,
handed to her by an Associated Press reporter.
"Hal" she said. "He'll be simply killed. Really, he'll
be killed ... They can enter this flat and put a pillow
over his face and kill him and say he died of a heart
attack. And any Soviet doctor would sign the autopsy
She did not elaborate on her fear. Last year, how
ever, she reported that unidentified men assaulted
Sakharov, knocked him out with a chemical sub
stance and stole his scientific research papers.
Stocks fall

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 1.45
Tuesday, fell 9.96 to 1219.72. The blue-chip average
