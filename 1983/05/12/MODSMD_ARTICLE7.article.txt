## Sacramento report: Duke and assembly hard at work Assembly defeats auto bill; stalls on labor 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
In Sacramento legislative action earlier this week,
the assembly stalled on a grower-backed bill on labor
regulations, whle approving in committee another
bill which would regulate the commercial use of dead
people's names. A bill which would restrict auto in
surance companies from "redlining" policy holders
in bad neighborhoods was defeated in committee.
The measure on labor regulations would overturn
an Agricultural Labor Relations Board ruling which
held that a San Benito County grower should have
negotiated with the United Farm Workers union be
fore selling 40 acres of garlic to a seed company.
The seed company employees harvested the crop
instead of UFW members.
A bill by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos)
would overturn that decision by stipulating that
growers do not have to negotiate with workers over
decisions about what to grow or produce.
Areias insisted he had enough votes on the Assem
bly Labor and Employment Committee to send the
measure to the full Assembly, but the bill stalled as
opponents tried to refer it to the Ways and Means
Committee.
The vote on that motion deadlocked 6-6, but sup
porters held the roll open in hopes of picking up
additional support.
Critics said the labor relations ruling, known as the
Bertuccio decision, would set a precedent that could
create economic calamity for growers.
"I think it would be absolutely suicide for (farmers)
to stay in California if we are going to get union
decisions over crops," said Assemblyman Eric Seas
trand (R-Salinas).
But opponents of the Areias measure said the deci
sion would require bargaining only in limited circum

stances.
In the Bertuccio case, the board, relying on a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling, held that collective bargaining
requirements outweighed business needs of the
grower.
Heirs bill
Urged by actress Ginger Rogers and relatives of
some of entertainment's biggest names, a legislative
committee voted Tuesday to ban commercial exploi
tation of a dead celebrity without the heirs' consent.
Moneyfrom products bearingacelebrity's nameor
likeness "should go to his loved ones and not to some
unrelated ripoff artist," Priscilla Presley, former wife
of the late singer Elvis Presley, told the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
Attorney Everett Fields sat beside a poster depict
ing his late grandfather, comedian W C. Fields, in the
nude and said, "None of these salacious products
would have been perpetrated on the public while he
was alive."
With no one speaking against it, the bill, 58613 by
Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) was
sent to the Senate floor on an 8-0 vote. It was given a
"consent" classification, reserved for non
controversial bills that will be voted on without de
bate.
The bill would require consent from the heirs, for
100 years after a celebrity's death, for any advertising
that used the celebrity's name, picture, voice or sig
nature. Damages would include all profits made from
the unauthorized use.
Under current state law, the right to forbid com
mercial use of one's name ends at a person's death.

That was decided by the state Supreme Court in a
1979 case rejecting a claim by heirs of actor Rela
Lugosi to an interest in Universal Pictures' continued
exploitation of Dracula, as portrayed by Lugosi.
Auto insurance
Amid impassioned pleas from a group of black
ministers and a threatened ballot initiative, an As
sembly panel rejected a plan Tuesday to force au
tomobile insurance companies to stop "redlining" —
charging residents of certain neighborhoods more
for insurance.
The measure, opposed by the insurance industry,
would require insurance companies to use only the
customer's driving record in setting premiums for
California's 16.3 million licensed drivers.
Companies currently consider the address of the
customer and the location of where the car is kept at
night — among other factors — in deciding upon
rates, resulting in higher premiums for residents of
poorer areas because those motorists dwell in high
risk zones.
Insurance industry representatives said the com
panies must use a number of factors, such as marital
status, sex and address, to "spread the risk around."
The average motorist has about one accident in every
seven years, they said.
But supporters of the bill, A 81406 by Assemblywo
man Gloria Molina (D-Los Angeles) say good drivers
who live in poor areas pay more than motorists with
identical driving records in higher-income, low-risk
areas.
"Let them charge for theft insurance in bad areas,"
said Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Lawndale), "but
not more for collision and liability."
