# Deukmejian wants mothers to work
## Hostile reception for welfare plan 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Gov. George Deukmejian's welfare plan
received a hostile reception from an As
sembly committee Tuesday, but the legis
lator carrying it said it would be changed.
The Human Services Committee spent
four hours hearing critical testimony on
one of the two bills containing the Repub
lican governor's 38-part plan, but took no
vote.
People opposed to the bill, the majority
of them women, packed the hearing room
to testify that the Deukmejian proposal to
make welfare mothers work for three
months was unfair unless there was
adequate affordable child care and unless
more fathers were forced to pay child sup
port.

Assemblyman Ernest Konnyu (R-
Saratoga) said the administration would
"make every sincere attempt to meet all
reasonable concerns" raised in the tes
timony and bring the bill back before the
committee in two weeks.
But Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-
Berkeley), chairman of the committee,
said he would take the parts of the plan he
supports, mainly tougherchildsupport en
forcement, and put those in his own bill.
Several committee members, annoyed
with the long hearing, insisted on an im
mediate vote to kill the bill. One Democrat
opposed to it stomped out in anger and for
much of the hearing Bates was the only
one of the 10 committee members pre
sent.

Deukmejian's plan to change the Aid to
Families With Dependent Children pro
gram is contained in two bills, Konnyu's
ABB6I and 58962 by Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-
Woodland) which is being considered in
Senate committees this week.
The AFDC program provides welfare
benefits to 1.6 million persons, most of
them mothers and children. It costs the
state $1.3 billion this year, and the federal
government another $1.5 billion. The
grant for a mother and two children is $506
a month.
The Deukmejian plan would:
â€¢ Require mothers with chidren 3 and
older to search for a job for four to eight
weeks, then work for the county for three
months to get benefits.
