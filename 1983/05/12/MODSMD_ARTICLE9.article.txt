## Auschwitz survivor relates death camp experience 'Little room for hatred' 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
The only way to emotionally survive a Nazi
Death Camp is to remember, but not hate.
"When you try to live, there is very little room
for hatred," explained Max Garcia, a San Fran
cisco architect and survivor of Auschwitz, who
spoke Tuesday in Roble Lounge. "If you live with
hatred, you leave old wounds open."
Garcia, a native Hollander, was arrested in )uly
of 194 5. He was sent to Auschwitz where he re
mained for almost two years. His parents and his
sister were arrested at other times but only he
survived.
T he prisoners were shipped to camps in closed
boxcars, which had open tubs for human excre
ment and contained no food or fresh air, Garcia
said, "When you get in the cars, you don't know
nothing, and they don't tell you nothing."
Prisoners were sorted into those who could
work and those who looked too young, old or
sick to work. The latter were usually gassed im
mediately.
"Children were automatically gassed," he
said. The rest of the prisoners were then sepa
rated into different camps.
"You have to understand, when you to the
camp you no longer have a name. You are a
number," Garcia said. "If you have any hair,
anywhere, that is shaved off. All your clothes, all
your property is taken away; you're allowed to
keep your belt and your shoes. Then you are
given a tattoo and sent to be deloused."
The prisoners were assigned to work details,

Garcia said. "I told them I was a carpenter," he
said. "Until that day, I had never touched a saw."
He explained that he felt the career to which he
had been apprenticed, diamond polishing,
would not be as useful as carpentry skills.
Garcia was sent to work as a miller, then as a
roofer. He said he was "very lucky" to get the
work he did; other jobs included shoveling
bodies into an incinerator or shoveling waste out
of latrines.
After several illnesses, Garcia was assigned to
what he described as the best job at the camp —
he became a postal clerk. "I reported to be as
signed to a work detail; the officer looked at me
and said, 'If you've made it this long, you deserve
something easy.' He told me that maybe two
people from my original group were still alive."
His new job was to sort and deliver packages for
prisoners.
"Eighty percent of the packages that came
were for dead prisoners," he said. Packages for
live prisoners were delivered; the others were
stolen by postal clerks or SS officers.
"An officer would come in and say, 'I need a
sausage in an hour.' You would get it for them. It
was just like a retail store," Garcia explained.
Although better off that many of his fellow
prisoners, Garcia still experienced the full horror
of life at Auschwitz. The SS officers who guarded
the camp were not only brutal, they treated the
prisoners as if they were not human beings.
"All of the SS officers at the camp were volun
teers," Garcia said. "These were Hitler's chil

dren; they thought they were supermen." The
prisoners were constantly beaten, constantly
hungry; they lived on a small piece of turnip
flour bread and a bowl of rotten cabbage soup
daily.
In May of 1946, Ebensee, a subcamp of Au
schwitz, was liberated by American Gls; Garcia
remembers what happened when the Gls first
entered the camp."I could describe it in a movie,
perhaps not in words," Garcia said. "Two tanks
came rolling in; the tank man in front leaned
over and took a gun from one of the guards, and
broke it over his gun moll. He hung it over the
gate of the camp." Then, he said, the Gls looked
around the camp in disbelief.
"They looked at us — you had to remember
that we were filthy, our skin was not white, it was
so dirty. We stank like pigs. Multiply that by the
18,000 to 24,000 that were there. . . . They (the
Gls) were disgusted. They didn't want to have
anything to do with us, they who had fought
across the oceans to get here . . . looking
around, for the first time they realized what the
war was all about.
"I doubt this sort of thing can happen again,"
he said, "because now the world is covered with
television cameras." The present generation is
too aware and too concerned with global affairs
to permit such a carnage.
"At any rate, it can't happen in the United
States," he said, "because this is the only country
that is truly homogenous; any group of you
would be in too much danger to let any other
group be singled out.
