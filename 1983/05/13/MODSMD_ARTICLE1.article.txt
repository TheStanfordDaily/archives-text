# University, protesters gear up for graduation
## 
### JASON COLE Staff writer 
Students and the University began
making some "just-in-case" prepara
tions for commencement yesterday
— just in case Secretary of State
George Shultz cannot deliver his
planned speech or rain dampens the
ceremony. If Shultz does speak, he
will face protest from student groups
and some seniors.
Current negotiations in the Middle
East may keep Shultz there through
graduation and force the com
mencement speakers panel to find a
replacement.
Although none of the members of
the panel had discussed the possibil
ity of finding someone else, some of
the previous candidates were Wil
liam Hewlett and David Packard,
founders of Hewlett-Packard; Robert
Rosenzweig, former vice president
for public affairs here and current
president of the American Associa
tion of Universities; and Richard Ly
man, former University president
and current president of the Roc
kefeller Foundation.
Lawrence Horton, director of gov
ernment relations and member of
the panel, added that although he
hadn't heard of any possible re
placements, "The president does
have a list of other people who were
previously considered."
This winter's excessive rains have
also caused University officials to
worry about the possibility of rain
during commencement. In case of
rain, an alternate plan calls for dis
persion of participants and spec
tators to several campus facilities.
According to Nan Bentley, assis
tant director of events and <;ervirf"=
in case of "something more than a
heavy mist" ceremonies for the
School of Humanities and Sciences
will be moved to Maples Pavilion,
while the other schools will be
moved to auditoriums in their rela
tive vicinity. The schools of Art,
Drama, and Music will, for example,
be moved to Annenberg Auditorium.
The speeches will be held at
Maples and broadcast over KZSU to
the other auditoriums. Bentley said
this is essentially the first time the
University has ever considered a rain
plan, "because we never considered
the possibility would be as great."
Members of progressive groups
on campus, as well as several con
cerned seniors, met yesterday to
begin planning possible protests of
Shultz's speech at commencement.
The meeting was organized by the
Stanford Central American Action
Network (SCAAN) and was held at El
Centro Chicano in Old Union.
SCAAN is protesting Shultz be
cause, as a previous flyer stated, "He
is a principal architect of Reagan's
interventionist policies in Central
America, and a strong voice behind
the administration's escalation of the

arms race." The other groups com
plained about Shultz' policies in the
Middle East and in South Africa.
Some of the seniors said simply
that they are protesting what Shultz
represents and that they are not
happy having Shultz as their speaker.
The suggestions for protest action
ranged from holding a press confer
ence before commencement to
wearing sashes during the actual
ceremonies. However, most of these
suggestions were tabled and left to
be considered in several committees
formed at the end of the meeting.
Craig Richards, a graduate student
in education and also a member of
SCAAN, said that he thought that as
many as 200 people would partici
pate in a protest. "Considering the
number of people who showed up in
the rain at Shultz' house last week
(nearly 125), I think we will definitely
have a large group," he said, referr
ing to the Cinco de Mayo rally and
march.
