When and how was
frozen yogurt inventedf
How many flavors exist in
the world todayf
— a daily consumer
Yogurt was first made in
Turkey, and it is still a
peasant's staple there and in
Greece. There milk, usually
from goats or sheep, is
boiled in large buckets over
an open fire, then after it has
cooled inoculated with left
over yogurt. (There's a
chicken-and-egg question
here I don't want to get
into.) The milk gradually
thickens and curdles into
yogurt
In Northern Europe and
America, where yogurt has
become big business, the
process is slightly different.
Pasteurized cow's milk (this
being a comprehensive ser
vice, I'll tell you that in Egypt
and India water buffalo's
milk is preferred) is in
oculated with active bac
teria cultures — tradi
tionally Lactobacillus bul
garicus and Streptococcus
thermophilus, although
lately the much-ballyhooed
L. acidophilus has been
used for yogurt. The stuff is
then incubated four or five
hours at 110-112 degrees.
Yogurt's reputation as a
"health food" is based en
tirely on the effects of
massive doses of live L. bul
garicus on the human sys
tem. If enough of the bac
teria are introduced into the
intestines, they will coat the
intestinal lining and help
break down things that
would otherwise rot and de
cay inside your body. This
digestive effect is yogurt's
only known active health
benefit (claims that it lowers
cholesterol counts are un
substantiated), although it is
a high-protein, low-fat food

that in its basic form won't
hurt you. L. acidophilus is
thought by many to be a
more potent digestive aid
than L. bulgaricus, but so far
no one has definitively
shown that it has any
positive effect at all.
Many American com
mercial yogurts are, after in
cubation, pasteurized
again. This kills off the bac
teria, and completely
negates the yogurt's
digestive value. This is done
because re-pasteurized
yogurt will last up to three
times as long on the shelf. If
you care about this sort of
thing, you should avoid
brands that are labeled
"pasteurized" without
further explanation, and
seek out those, like Dan
non, that advertise "live
bacteria cultures."
There are a number of
other things that can be
done to yogurt to make it
less healthful, and most
commercial yogurts have
had some or all of these
donetothem. Many yogurts
carry various chemical pre
servatives. A bigger prob
lem are flavored yogurts. In
terms of calories, fruit
yogurts run 230-280 calories
per serving and other
flavors (vanilla, chocolate,
etc.) around 200, compared
to the 150-180 of plain
yogurts. Fruit yogurts that
have the fruit suspended
throughout the yogurt have
to contain chemical stabi
lizers. The yogurts with fruit
at the bottom still often con
tain additional pre
servatives. And finally, many
manufacturers use whole
milk and/or cream in their
yogurt base to get a
smoother, thicker final
product. The least calorific
yogurts are made from non

fat milk and milk solids.
Points to remember:
yogurts labeled "all-natu
ral" and so forth are gener
ally no better for you than
ones that aren't, and if they
contain fruit they're proba
bly worse. Yogurts sold pri
marily in natural-food stores
are in general no more nat
ural than those sold in gro
cery stores (where the turn
over is faster and shelf life
doesn't have to be as long).
Questions of quality are
much hazier with frozen
yogurt, which is almost en
tirely a wholesale
phenomenon. Dairy whole
salers sell frozen yogurt
powders or liquid mixes,
which the vendors (like the
Corner Pocket) just pour
into soft ice-cream ma
chines. You can usually
count on frozen yogurt to
be higher in both calories
and chemicals than you'd
expect.
It is possible to make
frozen yogurt at home. You
use an ice cream machine,
and just follow the direc
tions for ice cream but use
cold yogurt instead of milk
and cream. You can even
make your own flavored
frozen yogurt — the best
method is to whip together
your yogurt and some fruit
in a blender beforehand,
rather than adding fruit dur
ing the process.
After all that, I can't really
answer either of your ques
tions (my laziness is show
ing). The first frozen yogurt
outlet is rumored to have
been located in Harvard
Square. To give you some
idea about flavors: among
local dairy wholesalers,
Piers carries seven flavors of
frozen yogurt mix, Peninsu
la Creamery six, and
Berkeley Farms three.

that in its basic form won't
hurt you. L. acidophilus is
thought by many to be a
more potent digestive aid
than L. bulgaricus, but so far
no one has definitively
shown that it has any
positive effect at all.
Many American com
mercial yogurts are, after in
cubation, pasteurized
again. This kills off the bac
teria, and completely
negates the yogurt's
digestive value. This is done
because re-pasteurized
yogurt will last up to three
times as long on the shelf. If
you care about this sort of
thing, you should avoid
brands that are labeled
"pasteurized" without
further explanation, and
seek out those, like Dan
non, that advertise "live
bacteria cultures."
There are a number of
other things that can be
done to yogurt to make it
less healthful, and most
commercial yogurts have
had some or all of these
donetothem. Many yogurts
carry various chemical pre
servatives. A bigger prob
lem are flavored yogurts. In
terms of calories, fruit
yogurts run 230-280 calories
per serving and other
flavors (vanilla, chocolate,
etc.) around 200, compared
to the 150-180 of plain
yogurts. Fruit yogurts that
have the fruit suspended
throughout the yogurt have
to contain chemical stabi
lizers. The yogurts with fruit
at the bottom still often con
tain additional pre
servatives. And finally, many
manufacturers use whole
milk and/or cream in their
yogurt base to get a
smoother, thicker final
product. The least calorific
yogurts are made from non

fat milk and milk solids.
Points to remember:
yogurts labeled "all-natu
ral" and so forth are gener
ally no better for you than
ones that aren't, and if they
contain fruit they're proba
bly worse. Yogurts sold pri
marily in natural-food stores
are in general no more nat
ural than those sold in gro
cery stores (where the turn
over is faster and shelf life
doesn't have to be as long).
Questions of quality are
much hazier with frozen
yogurt, which is almost en
tirely a wholesale
phenomenon. Dairy whole
salers sell frozen yogurt
powders or liquid mixes,
which the vendors (like the
Corner Pocket) just pour
into soft ice-cream ma
chines. You can usually
count on frozen yogurt to
be higher in both calories
and chemicals than you'd
expect.
It is possible to make
frozen yogurt at home. You
use an ice cream machine,
and just follow the direc
tions for ice cream but use
cold yogurt instead of milk
and cream. You can even
make your own flavored
frozen yogurt — the best
method is to whip together
your yogurt and some fruit
in a blender beforehand,
rather than adding fruit dur
ing the process.
After all that, I can't really
answer either of your ques
tions (my laziness is show
ing). The first frozen yogurt
outlet is rumored to have
been located in Harvard
Square. To give you some
idea about flavors: among
local dairy wholesalers,
Piers carries seven flavors of
frozen yogurt mix, Peninsu
la Creamery six, and
Berkeley Farms three.

When and how was
frozen yogurt inventedf
How many flavors exist in
the world todayf
— a daily consumer
Yogurt was first made in
Turkey, and it is still a
peasant's staple there and in
Greece. There milk, usually
from goats or sheep, is
boiled in large buckets over
an open fire, then after it has
cooled inoculated with left
over yogurt. (There's a
chicken-and-egg question
here I don't want to get
into.) The milk gradually
thickens and curdles into
yogurt
In Northern Europe and
America, where yogurt has
become big business, the
process is slightly different.
Pasteurized cow's milk (this
being a comprehensive ser
vice, I'll tell you that in Egypt
and India water buffalo's
milk is preferred) is in
oculated with active bac
teria cultures — tradi
tionally Lactobacillus bul
garicus and Streptococcus
thermophilus, although
lately the much-ballyhooed
L. acidophilus has been
used for yogurt. The stuff is
then incubated four or five
hours at 110-112 degrees.
Yogurt's reputation as a
"health food" is based en
tirely on the effects of
massive doses of live L. bul
garicus on the human sys
tem. If enough of the bac
teria are introduced into the
intestines, they will coat the
intestinal lining and help
break down things that
would otherwise rot and de
cay inside your body. This
digestive effect is yogurt's
only known active health
benefit (claims that it lowers
cholesterol counts are un
substantiated), although it is
a high-protein, low-fat food

that in its basic form won't
hurt you. L. acidophilus is
thought by many to be a
more potent digestive aid
than L. bulgaricus, but so far
no one has definitively
shown that it has any
positive effect at all.
