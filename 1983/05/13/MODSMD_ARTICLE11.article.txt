## The
						Stanford Daily Give homosexuals respect 
### 
The poster near the student lockers at the Law
School has been up for a week now. It was
placed by students seeking support for gays and
lesbians â€” victims of vandalism and harass
ment.
More than 200 students and faculty members
signed the Cay Law Student Association state
ment which listed incidents of harassment in
cluding graffitied threats against homosexual
students. Though the signatures are impressive,
they are not enough. Too easily the statement
has become an unnoticed fixture ignored by
students and faculty caught up in academics.
Having signed the poster many walk away
without considering the possibility of contribut
ing to solving the problem of gay and lesbian
harassment. Others refuse to become involved
at any level. This is cause for more than a little
concern.
The Stanford community is diverse. And the
University is proud of this fact. Administrators,
faculty and students proudly claim goals of
academic and social freedom of thought. How
then can we as a community stifle one seg
ment's expression?

Whether or not we agree with another indi
vidual's chosen lifestyle is not the issue at hand.
What matters is that a group of our community
has been singled out and told that it is unfit. This
is wrong.
Homosexuality is not illegal in California.
Neither is it solely a question of legality. Per
sonal moral questions admittedly cloud the is
sue, but they do not alter the fact, and it seems
law students would be particularly aware of this,
that homosexuals have and deserve the legal
right to live free from vindictive attacks against
them.
We each have a responsibility to one
another's humanity long before we consider
whether or not we share the same sexual pref
erence. Caring and mutual respect are values
fostered in residential programs here. Yet the
need for a poster supporting gays and lesbians
is evidence that our actions fall short of our
stated goals.
We need to strengthen our community com
mitment. To do otherwise is to discount a seg
ment that has much to contribute to academic
and social thought.
