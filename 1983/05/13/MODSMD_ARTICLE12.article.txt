## Peace institutes: words and reality 
### 
Those of us who have the misera
ble task of following innumerable in
ternational conferences, like the
second special disarmament session
of the U.N. General Assembly, are
struck by two facts. The first is that
while, as Churchill said, "jaw jaw is
better than war war," this perpetual
jaw jaw is a sterile and expensive
opera bouffe. The second is that
words acquire a code meaning.
Thus, "peace" means Soviet aggres
siveness. Both of these points are
appropriate in considering the pro
posal tor a peace academy, which is
supported by doves like Sen. Mark
Hatfield and hawks like Sen. Sam
Nunn, who want the eagle to con
tinue holding the olive branch ap
propriately in its right claw. An unfor
tunate fact is that in American institu
tions internal debate has almost en
ded. Institutes are labeled either lef
tist or rightist, and an institute with
one bias is usually countered by one
with the opposite. Thus, it seems
likely that a peace academy would be
taken over byoneside, leadingtothe
establishment of a counter academy.
The result would be jaw jaw versus
jaw jaw.
Dean Theodore Eliot of the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplo
macy opposes the proposed
academy, and surely it would make
more sense to reinvigorate the ap
propriate academic programs al
ready existing. Here, with concision
imposed by lack of space, are some
of the steps which should be taken.
Since "peace" has come to mean
"peace at any price," we should
think instead in terms of strategic
studies. This expression may sound
bellicose, but it really means taking a
hard look at reality in the pursuit of
peace. There is a strategy for peace as
well as for war. As a first step toward a
realistic approach to strategic issues,
geography, so disgiacefully ne
glected in our universities, must be
recognized as the study of the envi
ronment in which issues of war and
peace are decided. Political geogra
phy, once a staple of political science
departments but now rarely taught,
should be part of all international
studies programs. The word
"geopolitics," shunned because it
was abused by Na/i Germans as was
the word "race," should be revived,
since it corresponds to a hard reality.
General Karl Haushofer and his Insti
tute of Geopolitics in Munich gave it
its bad name, but the word was
coined by a political scientist, Rudolf
Kjellen, of Sweden. T he theory of the
heartland which Sir Halford Mac-
Kinder developed in his 1904 paper
"The Geographical Pivot of History"
is still of the utmost importance in
understanding the world role of the
Soviet Union. It is complemented by
the rimland theory that Nicholas
Spykman propounded in The Geog
raphy of Peace (1944).
When the behavioral scientists
took over political scient e, it became
fashionable to sneer at these men,
who were infinitely wiser and better
informed than their critics. The time
has come to dump much of the be
havioral sciences approach into the
garbage can of history. It was 13
pieces of Ford Foundation silver
which persuaded some political sci
entists to switch loyalties. The game
theory is a game. Some years ago,
Citibank published an excellent bul
letin on international affairs. I called
to talk with the staff. Before reaching
its office, I passed a large room
where some 30 young men were
playing a game like tiddlywinks; they
were being trained in banking as a
game. It turned out that the bulletin
was prepared by a little old lady and
one young typist. Fhe bulletin was
later discontinued as an economy
measure. No wonder our banks have
acted so foolishly.

Another behavioristic theory ready
for the dump is the belief that there is
a quick way to learn foreign lan
guages. Learning any foreign lan
guage well requires decades of hard
work. International studies should
begin with language. The practice of
studying a behavioral science and
then picking up a language on the
side is a hoax. We have even had
Latin Americanists who needed an
interpreter when they went to Latin
America. One foreign-born lan
guage expert running a IJ.S. gov
ernment program claimed he could
train Americans to speak like natives
in three months. He had been in the
United States over 20 years, but his
English resembled pidgin English.
When, during World War 11, lan
guage and area programs were estab
lished in U.S. universities, language
study was a primary component. Its
ousting by the behavioral sciences
was admittedly in large measure a
consequence of the attitude of lan
guage teachers. The old-fashioned

ones continued to concentrate on
one research topic (usually one au
thor) which provided them with a
rock behind which they could hide in
murky waters, occasionally emitting
a squirt of black print. The younger
and less scholarly ones swam around
in the shallow waters of conversa
tional language, bilingual, and
Chicano studies. The decline in pre
stige of language departments has
been vertical.
Given the lamentable state of our
language teaching, it might be wise
for language departments to leave
research in foreign literatures largely
to the countries concerned. They
should likewise cease to think that
the study of a modern language
should be conducted on the Berlitz
level. Language specialists need a de
tailed knowledge of the complex
workings of modern society.
Lexicography, which provides the
link between that society and lan
guage, should become a major con
cern of our language departments.
Unfortunately, few language
teachers are competent in it, since
their training is purely literary.
A major problem is the role of his
tory in international studies. Histo
rians argue rightly that we do not yet
have adequate documentary evi
dence about contemporary affairs
and that, until the record is available,
solid research is impossible. At the
same time, they aspire to power, and
at many universities they have
pushed others aside and taken con
trol of programs in the international
.field. The consequences of this may
be serious. While it is true that we
never have adequate documentation
on contemporary developments,
they are the essential concern of in
ternational relations, which must use
a variety of approaches far broader
than the traditional methods of his
torical documentation. Wars are
largely the result of miscalculation,
often born of an obsession with his
tory. For example, Portugal would
have avoided its colonial tragedy if
Portugese historians had not lived,
like Don Quixote, in a world gone
forever. Moreover, historians tend
to be strong departmentalists, unwil
ling to share power with other disci
plines, even though a wide array,
from aeronautics to /oology, can and
should make an invaluable contrib
ution to our understanding of the
contemporary scene.

The remedy is at once simple and
drastic. Abolish history departments
and replace them with historical in
stitutes, in which there would be a
core of historians performing the
role of synthesis, while the history of
each field would be left to the ap
propriate department. The historical
institute would be an omnium
gatherum in which all departments
would participate. Thus the de
partmental loyalty of historians
would give way to an ecumenical un
derstanding of the historical process,
with the historians in the vanguard.
A detailed study would be neces
sary to explain the role of various de
partments in strategic studies. Here
there is space to mention only one
crucial discipline, namely, econom
ics. Traditionally, economists have
maintained that they dealt with uni
versal verities and that area studies
are irrelevant. Some arrogantly
claimed that they had the economy
under control and that now their job
was simply to fine-tune it. The pre-

sent economic disarray of the world
has demonstrated the vanity of this
claim, and economists are sharply
divided; in simplistic terms, we may
say it is the Chicago School versus
the rest. This new, grudging modesty
should force economists to cooper
ate with area programs.
Finally, what ahout the world out
side of academe? Universities may
no longer be ivory towers, but they
are word factories. This brings us
back to the theme of words and real
ity. A businessman who has been try
ing to operate in El Salyador, for
example, may have a better grasp of
the problems of that country than an
academician who has had little prac
tical experience or responsibility.
We should not dismiss businessmen
as unprincipled rogues, of whom
there are as many in academe.
Academicians should listen to what
businessmen have to say, and vice
versa. Our foreign service may be full
of wafflers and intriguers, but not
more than academe. That a man like
George Ball should be looked upon
as an uncertified outsider by an
academician simply proves that
academe can be the theater of the
absurd.
There are mad military men, like
the old Japanese army or the Argen
tine junta, but the threat to peace
often comes from civilians like Hi
tler, Mussolini, or Begin. They are
much more likely to engage in mili
tary adventures than a modern army
leader; 19th-century Napoleonism is
a disappearing phenomenon. Latin
America, where it was prevalent,
now has some responsible army
leaders, like the Brazilian army's
"Sorbonne." There seems to be a re
vival of Napoleonism in Asia, and we
must view it as a danger, but the
more thoughtful military of today can
make an important contribution to
strategic or peace studies.
Eisenhower said, "War is hell," and a
number of leaders of the peace
movement in Western Europe and
the United States are retired generals
and admirals.
In sum, what is needed is not a
peace academy but a more realistic
assessment of international affairs in
our universities, the very structure of
which militates against the approach
here recommended.
