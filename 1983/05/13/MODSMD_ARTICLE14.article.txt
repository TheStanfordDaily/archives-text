Time: 1:30 p.m., May 2, 1983.
Place: an economics classroom.
He stared nervously at the test.
There were five questions, but he
couldn't answer any of them. Visions
of Fs ran through his head. Following
that were visions of law school rejec
tion letters, derogatory letters from
his parents, students laughing at
him, etc.
His palms started to sweat. His
eyes grew blurry. He started to burp,
which he always did whenever he
became nervous.
He noticed the woman sitting next
to him. She was writing a lot. He even
heard her say to herself, "God! This
is so easy!"
He realized that he was able to see
her paper. Guilt went out the win
dow in the face of failure, and he
started to copy from her. He was on
question three when a big hand
came out of the sky and landed on his
writing arm. He looked up and saw
the TA.
"C'mon kid," the TA said. "We're
going to the Ombudsman's Office."
The ombudsman said he was tired
of all the cheating and that he wanted
to make an example of the unfortu
nate cheater. He said he was going to
suspend him.
The miserable student said, "Be
fore I go, I want to to talk to President
Kennedy."
Time: 8:48 a.m., May 2, 1983. Place:
the Post Office.
Walking toward her box, she had
to say "Hello" to at least 10 people.
She was one of the most well-known
and popular figures on campus. It
wasn't that she did anything so spe
cial. She was just very nice.
At her P.O. box she pulled out a
letter from the Office of the Regis
trar. Immediately she remembered
why she had been so depressed
lately.
It was her academic record. She
was doing terribly. Only 30 units
completed in the last three quarters.
She knew she was in trouble.
In high school, she had always
been the "girl who could do it all."
Academics, athletics, friends. She
was just a great individual. When she
was accepted to Stanford, everyone
in her neighborhood said, "I told you
so."
But a funny thing happened on the
way to Harvard Law School. Stan
ford's competitive environment af
fected her. During classes she would
look around at all the intense note
takers and would think, "They make
me sick. They don't enjoy what
they're doing. They just want to get
As because they think that's what will
make their teachers, their parents,
and even some of their friends
happy. But they never think about
what makes them happy. What am I
doing here with these nerds any
way?"
Opening the envelope, her heart
began to pound. She was already on
academic probation, and she knew
what the next step was. The letter
said that she was being considered
for probation, and would she please
go to Kennedy's office the next day.
She wished she were home.
Time: 11:09 p.m., May 2, 1983.
Place: home of Kennedy.
1 he president was just about to go
to sleep when the phone rang.
"Can you get it, honey?" he called
to his wife. "I want to go to bed. I'm
getting up early to run with some
freshmen tomorrow."
"But dear," his wife responded,
"I'm still doing the dishes."
The president picked up the re
ceiver.
"If you're from the Peninsula
Times Tribune, he said, "I already get
the Chronicle."
"Listen to me," said a rushed, ner
vous voice. "I work in a big, well
known company that has close rela
tions with your big, well-known uni
versity."
"Who is this?"
"It doesn't matter. My company
recently hired somebody who is ac

tually from a big, well-known coun
try that is very hostile to the United
States."
"What are you talking about?"
"I happen to know that this person
is using resources in your universi
ty's labs to do experiments that are
actually going to benefit his country.
Nobody knows this. My company
thinks all his work is for them. And
the University is letting him use its
facilities because they always give
our company special treatment."
"I know," said the president.
"You're from the Chaparral
"Look Kennedy. This is a matter of
national security. If you want . . . uh
oh, somebody's coming." The
phone clicked.
Kennedy was stunned. Something
deep inside of him, an instinct he had
acquired while working in Washing
ton, told him that this wasn't a total
joke.
Time: 2 p.m., May 3, 1983. Place:
Office of the President.
The two nervous students sat fac
ing the president.
"Well, son," the president said.
"What's your story?"
"You'd ruin my life if you sus
pended me, President Kennedy. My
friends would think I was an idiot, my
girlfriend would drop me, law school
would be out the door, my parents
would disown me and worst of all, I
probably wouldn't be able to get a
job in the Polo Store this summer.
You wouldn't believe the discounts I
get by working there."
"Young lady," the president said.
"What's your story?"
"I don't really care that much what
happens. I don't think I'm cut out for
university life."
"Do you two know each other?"
the president asked.
they both answered.
"Well, take a good look at one
another."
They stared at each other. She had
brown hair, was very fit, and had a
vibrant look in her face that he found
very appealing. He had a look of in

tensity in his eyes that she found ex
citing.
"You two are about to become a
team. I'm not going to suspend
either one of you, but you have to do
something for me."
The president described the
phone call from the previous night.
He told the two that he wanted them
to find out who the "hostile person
from the big well-known country"
was.
This sounds great, the male stu
dent thought to himself. I'm turning
into some kind of University James
Bond. The only problem is what am I
going to tell old Dad when he asks
me what I've been learning about
Wall Street.
The female student was thrilled by
what she heard. This was her chance
to do incredibly exciting things while
everyone else bored themselves to
death in the library. And the guy was
becoming increasingly better look
ing as she became better acquainted
with him.
"You're going to have to move out
of your old residences. I've set up a
special suite in Governor's Corner
for you. Also you're going to have to
learn how to operate weapons. From
now on, you two have special
privileges," the president said.
He woke up with a terrible pain in
his neck. He had fallen asleep with
his head turned sideways. Saliva had
collected on page 45 of his econom
ics book.
Picking his head up, he realized
with incredible disappointment that
he was in the purple section in the
basement of Green Library. It had all
been a dream.
What a drag, he thought. Back to
the dull existence of being a studious
college student.
But he had an econ test on Mon
day. What if he didn't study. He
would then have to cheat and then
. . . who knows?

He stared nervously at the test.
There were five questions, but he
couldn't answer any of them. Visions
of Fs ran through his head. Following
that were visions of law school rejec
tion letters, derogatory letters from
his parents, students laughing at
him, etc.
His palms started to sweat. His
eyes grew blurry. He started to burp,
which he always did whenever he
became nervous.
He noticed the woman sitting next
to him. She was writing a lot. He even
heard her say to herself, "God! This
is so easy!"
He realized that he was able to see
her paper. Guilt went out the win
dow in the face of failure, and he
started to copy from her. He was on
question three when a big hand
came out of the sky and landed on his
writing arm. He looked up and saw
the TA.
"C'mon kid," the TA said. "We're
going to the Ombudsman's Office."
The ombudsman said he was tired
of all the cheating and that he wanted
to make an example of the unfortu
nate cheater. He said he was going to
suspend him.
The miserable student said, "Be
fore I go, I want to to talk to President
Kennedy."
Time: 8:48 a.m., May 2, 1983. Place:
the Post Office.
Walking toward her box, she had
to say "Hello" to at least 10 people.
She was one of the most well-known
and popular figures on campus. It
wasn't that she did anything so spe
cial. She was just very nice.
At her P.O. box she pulled out a
letter from the Office of the Regis
trar. Immediately she remembered
why she had been so depressed
lately.
It was her academic record. She
was doing terribly. Only 30 units
completed in the last three quarters.
She knew she was in trouble.
In high school, she had always
been the "girl who could do it all."
Academics, athletics, friends. She
was just a great individual. When she
was accepted to Stanford, everyone
in her neighborhood said, "I told you
so."
But a funny thing happened on the
way to Harvard Law School. Stan
ford's competitive environment af
fected her. During classes she would
look around at all the intense note
takers and would think, "They make
me sick. They don't enjoy what
they're doing. They just want to get
As because they think that's what will
make their teachers, their parents,
and even some of their friends
happy. But they never think about
what makes them happy. What am I
doing here with these nerds any
way?"
Opening the envelope, her heart
began to pound. She was already on
academic probation, and she knew
what the next step was. The letter
said that she was being considered
for probation, and would she please
go to Kennedy's office the next day.
She wished she were home.
Time: 11:09 p.m., May 2, 1983.
Place: home of Kennedy.
1 he president was just about to go
to sleep when the phone rang.
"Can you get it, honey?" he called
to his wife. "I want to go to bed. I'm
getting up early to run with some
freshmen tomorrow."
"But dear," his wife responded,
"I'm still doing the dishes."
The president picked up the re
ceiver.
"If you're from the Peninsula
Times Tribune, he said, "I already get
the Chronicle."
"Listen to me," said a rushed, ner
vous voice. "I work in a big, well
known company that has close rela
tions with your big, well-known uni
versity."
"Who is this?"
"It doesn't matter. My company
recently hired somebody who is ac

tually from a big, well-known coun
try that is very hostile to the United
States."
"What are you talking about?"
"I happen to know that this person
is using resources in your universi
ty's labs to do experiments that are
actually going to benefit his country.
Nobody knows this. My company
thinks all his work is for them. And
the University is letting him use its
facilities because they always give
our company special treatment."
"I know," said the president.
"You're from the Chaparral
"Look Kennedy. This is a matter of
national security. If you want . . . uh
oh, somebody's coming." The
phone clicked.
Kennedy was stunned. Something
deep inside of him, an instinct he had
acquired while working in Washing
ton, told him that this wasn't a total
joke.
Time: 2 p.m., May 3, 1983. Place:
Office of the President.
The two nervous students sat fac
ing the president.
"Well, son," the president said.
"What's your story?"
"You'd ruin my life if you sus
pended me, President Kennedy. My
friends would think I was an idiot, my
girlfriend would drop me, law school
would be out the door, my parents
would disown me and worst of all, I
probably wouldn't be able to get a
job in the Polo Store this summer.
You wouldn't believe the discounts I
get by working there."
"Young lady," the president said.
"What's your story?"
"I don't really care that much what
happens. I don't think I'm cut out for
university life."
"Do you two know each other?"
the president asked.
they both answered.
"Well, take a good look at one
another."
They stared at each other. She had
brown hair, was very fit, and had a
vibrant look in her face that he found
very appealing. He had a look of in

tensity in his eyes that she found ex
citing.
"You two are about to become a
team. I'm not going to suspend
either one of you, but you have to do
something for me."
The president described the
phone call from the previous night.
He told the two that he wanted them
to find out who the "hostile person
from the big well-known country"
was.
This sounds great, the male stu
dent thought to himself. I'm turning
into some kind of University James
Bond. The only problem is what am I
going to tell old Dad when he asks
me what I've been learning about
Wall Street.
The female student was thrilled by
what she heard. This was her chance
to do incredibly exciting things while
everyone else bored themselves to
death in the library. And the guy was
becoming increasingly better look
ing as she became better acquainted
with him.
"You're going to have to move out
of your old residences. I've set up a
special suite in Governor's Corner
for you. Also you're going to have to
learn how to operate weapons. From
now on, you two have special
privileges," the president said.
He woke up with a terrible pain in
his neck. He had fallen asleep with
his head turned sideways. Saliva had
collected on page 45 of his econom
ics book.
Picking his head up, he realized
with incredible disappointment that
he was in the purple section in the
basement of Green Library. It had all
been a dream.
What a drag, he thought. Back to
the dull existence of being a studious
college student.
But he had an econ test on Mon
day. What if he didn't study. He
would then have to cheat and then
. . . who knows?
