## Renewable energy lab provides 'hands on' experience 
### TO BENOIT 
I he renewable energy lab is now
open for business after months of
preparation. In the lab, students ac
quire hands-on experience in solar
energy and conservation
technologies, and verify for them
selves whether solar "really works."
At present the facility houses a class
entitled, "Building Energy Lab" (C.E.
177), in which students cooperate in
testing predictions about residential
heating efficiency using microcom
puter models.
Experiments being carried out in
clude a study of infiltration, the leak
age of air into and out of a building.
Heat lost by this path can be as high
as 30 percent of the total in an
energy-efficient building. The
amount of leakage or "crack" can be
measured by two techniques. In one,
a device known as a blower door is
inserted in a doorway. A fan on the
device builds up a pressure within
the building. By measuring the in
duced pressure at a given fan speed,
a computer model can be used to
determine the amount of leakage

and theoretical heat loss. Another
method for measuring infiltration in
volves injecting a tracer gas into a
building and observing the rate at
which it disappears.
Another experiment compares
passive solar heating methods. The
heat absorption by a Trombe Wall, a
black concrete wall placed in front of
south-facing windows, is compared
with storage of solar energy in the
concrete floor in a windowed room.
The efficiency of various floor sur
faces is also examined. Tempera
tures of various parts of a system are
automatically monitored and fed into
the lab's microcomputer. Actual re
sults can be compared with com
puter models to test the assumptions
on which those models are based.
The class and the facility, led by
Gil Masters, adjunct professor of civil
engineering, grew out of his class en
titled "Small-Scale Energy Systems."
Masters said that he wanted to give
his students hands-on experience
using the techniques and rules about
which he lectures in the classroom.
He obtained seed money from the

Institute for Energy Studies and hired
three students who were interested
in studying home heating
phenomena. The three did studies of
air quality and heat loss as it relates to
the leakage of air into and out of
houses. Masters took the results to
the Department of Civil Engineering
which matched the funds. The
School of Engineering then matched
both grants. A total of $40,000 was
raised for the lab.
Over the summer a list of neces
sary equipment was compiled and a
search to find a location for the build
ing was initiated. After the roof of
Terman was rejected as being too
expensive and a spot on Searsville
Road was found to be too remote, an
area formerly used by the Mechan
ical Engineering Department for test
ing rocket engines was decided
upon. The building was constructed
using energy efficient materials in
cluding high quality insulation and
"heat mirror windows" that have
only one-fifth the heat loss of con
ventional windows. A computer and
data accumulating devices were do
nated by Hewlett-Packard. Construc
tion of the building was completed
over spring break and installation of
equipment continues on a weekly
basis.
Recently installed equipment in
cludes a solar water heating system
donated by Fafco Solar Systems and
photovoltaic cells donated by the let
Propulsion Lab. Students plan to use
an air-to-air heat exchanger in study
ing the effects of a kerosene heater
on the air quality inside an energy
efficient building. The machine can
take in fresh air and heat it using the
inside air that is being removed.
About 70 percent of the heat in the
outgoing air can be reclaimed by
such a device.
Lab members had to be resource
ful and cooperative in obtaining ma
terials and organizing the lab. For
example, the cost of temperature
sensing devices known as thermis
tors was reduced from $10 to $1 each

by purchasing them unassembled
and holding "soldering parties."
The curriculum was developed
using student input. Individual ex
periments were formulated by about
12 students last quarter, then com
piled by Masters but are still under
going revision. The order of experi
ments had to be changed because of
the persistent rains this spring.
The lab forms part of a sort of "en
ergy community" on campus. Other
classes on energy this quarter in
clude C.E. 238, "Planning for Decen
tralized Energy" and Undergraduate
Specials 44, "The Energy Con
troversy." "The spirit of co-operative
learning (this) system fosters is very
exciting," said Seth Zuckerman, a TA
for C.E. 177, "not like one person is
teaching others, more like we're all
learning and exploring together."
Though at present the facilities are
used primarily for teaching, the re
search has already extended into the
community. Moose Hydeman, the
Other C.E. 177 TA and another stu
dent, Paul Helliker, studied infiltra
tion of Eichler homes in Palo Alto
using the blower door. The effects of
various types of weather stripping
were compared and an advisory
pamphlet was drawn up. Infiltration
losses were cut in half in one case.
Unlike other alternative energy
projects like those at Lawrence Ber
keley Labs or Princeton, or the re
search on photovoltaic cells carried
on here at Stanford, the new lab is
not in the mainstream of federal
funding. However, workers at the lab
are enthusiastic about making the
facilities available for research, espe
tially during the nine months that
they are not being used for teaching.
Masters said he is pleased that he
can now show experimental verifica
tion of design rules of thumb that he
uses in the classroom. Even if all the
equations predict that a collector will
produce water of a given tempera
ture, "it doesn't mean much until
you actually feel the hot water on
your hand," Masters said.

inserted in a doorway. A fan on the
device builds up a pressure within
the building. By measuring the in
duced pressure at a given fan speed,
a computer model can be used to
determine the amount of leakage

and theoretical heat loss. Another
method for measuring infiltration in
volves injecting a tracer gas into a
building and observing the rate at
which it disappears.
Another experiment compares
passive solar heating methods. The
heat absorption by a Trombe Wall, a
black concrete wall placed in front of
south-facing windows, is compared
with storage of solar energy in the
concrete floor in a windowed room.
The efficiency of various floor sur
faces is also examined. Tempera
tures of various parts of a system are
automatically monitored and fed into
the lab's microcomputer. Actual re
sults can be compared with com
puter models to test the assumptions
on which those models are based.
The class and the facility, led by
Gil Masters, adjunct professor of civil
engineering, grew out of his class en
titled "Small-Scale Energy Systems."
Masters said that he wanted to give
his students hands-on experience
using the techniques and rules about
which he lectures in the classroom.
He obtained seed money from the

Institute for Energy Studies and hired
three students who were interested
in studying home heating
phenomena. The three did studies of
air quality and heat loss as it relates to
the leakage of air into and out of
houses. Masters took the results to
the Department of Civil Engineering
which matched the funds. The
School of Engineering then matched
both grants. A total of $40,000 was
raised for the lab.
Over the summer a list of neces
sary equipment was compiled and a
search to find a location for the build
ing was initiated. After the roof of
Terman was rejected as being too
expensive and a spot on Searsville
Road was found to be too remote, an
area formerly used by the Mechan
ical Engineering Department for test
ing rocket engines was decided
upon. The building was constructed
using energy efficient materials in
cluding high quality insulation and
"heat mirror windows" that have
only one-fifth the heat loss of con
ventional windows. A computer and
data accumulating devices were do
nated by Hewlett-Packard. Construc
tion of the building was completed
over spring break and installation of
equipment continues on a weekly
basis.
Recently installed equipment in
cludes a solar water heating system
donated by Fafco Solar Systems and
photovoltaic cells donated by the let
Propulsion Lab. Students plan to use
an air-to-air heat exchanger in study
ing the effects of a kerosene heater
on the air quality inside an energy
efficient building. The machine can
take in fresh air and heat it using the
inside air that is being removed.
About 70 percent of the heat in the
outgoing air can be reclaimed by
such a device.
Lab members had to be resource
ful and cooperative in obtaining ma
terials and organizing the lab. For
example, the cost of temperature
sensing devices known as thermis
tors was reduced from $10 to $1 each

by purchasing them unassembled
and holding "soldering parties."
The curriculum was developed
using student input. Individual ex
periments were formulated by about
12 students last quarter, then com
piled by Masters but are still under
going revision. The order of experi
ments had to be changed because of
the persistent rains this spring.
The lab forms part of a sort of "en
ergy community" on campus. Other
classes on energy this quarter in
clude C.E. 238, "Planning for Decen
tralized Energy" and Undergraduate
Specials 44, "The Energy Con
troversy." "The spirit of co-operative
learning (this) system fosters is very
exciting," said Seth Zuckerman, a TA
for C.E. 177, "not like one person is
teaching others, more like we're all
learning and exploring together."
Though at present the facilities are
used primarily for teaching, the re
search has already extended into the
community. Moose Hydeman, the
Other C.E. 177 TA and another stu
dent, Paul Helliker, studied infiltra
tion of Eichler homes in Palo Alto
using the blower door. The effects of
various types of weather stripping
were compared and an advisory
pamphlet was drawn up. Infiltration
losses were cut in half in one case.
Unlike other alternative energy
projects like those at Lawrence Ber
keley Labs or Princeton, or the re
search on photovoltaic cells carried
on here at Stanford, the new lab is
not in the mainstream of federal
funding. However, workers at the lab
are enthusiastic about making the
facilities available for research, espe
tially during the nine months that
they are not being used for teaching.
Masters said he is pleased that he
can now show experimental verifica
tion of design rules of thumb that he
uses in the classroom. Even if all the
equations predict that a collector will
produce water of a given tempera
ture, "it doesn't mean much until
you actually feel the hot water on
your hand," Masters said.

coming out of the flate plate collectors at the new renewable energy lab.
The lab, opened just this quarter, is being used to research applications
of solar energy and conservation techniques.
I he renewable energy lab is now
open for business after months of
preparation. In the lab, students ac
quire hands-on experience in solar
energy and conservation
technologies, and verify for them
selves whether solar "really works."
At present the facility houses a class
entitled, "Building Energy Lab" (C.E.
177), in which students cooperate in
testing predictions about residential
heating efficiency using microcom
puter models.
Experiments being carried out in
clude a study of infiltration, the leak
age of air into and out of a building.
Heat lost by this path can be as high
as 30 percent of the total in an
energy-efficient building. The
