# Federal government loses $60 million in coal sale
## 
### KEN BROWN 
Controversy is again boiling over the Reagan adminis
tration's natural resource policies. This time the issue
centers around the Department of Interior's leasing
policies for federally owned coal. A recent report by the
House of Representatives Appropriations Committee
has accused the administration of selling federal coal to
the energy industry at "firesale" prices.
Environmental groups disturbed the effects stepped
up leasing would have on environmentally sensitive
coal-rich lands in such states as New Mexico, Colorado
and Utah began to document revenue losses in the coal
sales conducted by the administration as early as July of
1982. The most cited example was the leasing of coal
reserves in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. The
sale, which took place in April of 1982, involved the
leasing of over 1.1 billion tons of coal â€” more than three
times as much coal in a single month than has been
leased since the beginning of the coal leasing program in
the Department of Interior (DOI) near the turn of the
century.
Not only was the size of the sale unusual, but the price
received for the coal was, according to environmental
groups, unbelievably low. Coal prices for private sector
coal sales in the Powder River area commonly range
from 20 cents per ton to as much as $1 per ton. In the
April sale the DOI accepted bids as low as seven cents
per ton in the Powder River sale. The average value for

the entire sale was a low 3.8 cents per ton. According to
federal government figures the difference between the
estimated market value of the leases and the received
bids from the sale represent a net loss of more than $240
million.
According to figures from the Congressional Office of
Technology Assessment, existing coal leases were, at
the time of the sale, more than sufficient to meet the
probable high demand for coal until the year 1990. Citing
these figures, environmental groups claimed that the
administration was flooding an already over-saturated
market for coal. The proposed Powder River coal sale
would accordingly drive lease prices lower, creating
even greater losses in future sales. With the administra
tion planning to lease an additional 8.7 billion tons ot
federally owned coal between 1982 and 1984, environ
mental groups claimed that the government could lose
as much as $16.6 billion as a result of the flooded market.
Judith Kunofsky of the Sierra Club, offered two possi
ble explanations for the "bargain basement" coal sales:
"Either the administration wants some money in the
treasury now and doesn't care about the future, or it is a
matter of ideology . . . Watt doesn't believe the public
should own natural resources and thinks they should be
sold off."
In April, the House Appropriations Committee re
leased its own eight-month study of the administra
tion's coal leasing policy, charging that the government

lost more than $60 million in the Powder River sale alone
due to "bad timing" and "procedural irregularities" in
the sale. The report contends that the sale was badly
timed because the coal market was over-saturated. The

accusation of procedural irregularities surrbunding the
sale steins from a DOI leak which revealed minimum
acceptable bids for the sale areas before the sale took
place. The report also levelled the much publicized ac
cusation that the Reagan administration is selling federal
coal at "firesale" prices.
Interior Department officials have labeled the report
as "deceitful" and "unprofessional." In defending the
DO Is leasing policies, Assistant Secretary of the Interior
Carrey Carruthers argues that the leak of the minimum
bid information to the coal industry was unimportant
since the information would have appeared 30 days be
fore the sale under normal procedures anyway. He also
defended the lower prices accepted by the DOI, stating
that new leasing guidelines determine acceptable bids
by a complex formula which "emphasizes the forces of
the market." According to Carruthers the coal sale was
also "in the national interest."
In Wyoming, Neal lacquot, an Interior Department
economist, offered further defense for the low sale price
of the Powder River Sale. According to lacquot,
minimum bid prices were lowered because government
geologists had made a "technical error" in estimating
how deep coal was buried in the area and the cost of
mining it. This controversial reduction in price came
about when the first round of industry bids came in
more than 50 percent below the earlier minimum bids
established bv the DOI.
