"Would you ever stop here if
you were just driving by look
ing for a place to eat?"
I didn't pause long before
answering, "No," as we stood
in front of our reviewing as
signment, La Cremaillere.
But now that I did stop, did
dine there and did enjoy it, I'd
love to go back.
La Cremaillere is an unob
trusive little place on Irving
Street in San Francisco's Sunset
District. Hidden between a raw
fabric store and a five-and
dime, La Cremaillere was a
touch of European countryside
amidst the streets of San Fran
cisco. The food, the service and
the atmosphere all contributed
to making our dinner a pleas
ure.
The decor is a collage of

country home gadgets; from
kitchen utensils to china to
children's toys. The collection
covers the walls and is sus
pended from the ceiling as
well, creating an overhead
museum.
The tables contrast this
somewhat distracting array by
their simple elegance. Each was
covered with the traditional
checkered tablecloths and
adorned with a lovely arrange
ment of fresh flowers. The
room was sofly lit with the
candles' glow.
Although the tables were
close together the chairs had
been arranged at angles which
allowed the diners to feel a
sense of privacy, tucked cozilv
into a roomful of quiet, in
timate charm.
Our menus were placed
before us along with an ex
tensive wine list. The selection
