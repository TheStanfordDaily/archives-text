# French dining under the utensils

### KATY DORE 
featured wines from France as
well as a good selection of Cali
fornia wines; all were reason
ably priced and many of the
domestics were available in
both full and half bottles.
The menu selection was
equally satisfying. From the
apertifs to the desserts, all the
items looked delightful. The
choice wasn't an easy one, but
we eased the pressures of our
decision-time with escargots
de Bourogne and a slightly
sweet California Chenin Blanc.
Would it be the Coquilles
Saint Jacques (fresh scallops in
a light cream, shallots and a
white wine sauce for $10.95), or
perhaps Poulet a L'Estragon
(roasted chicken in a brown
tarragon sauce with wild
mushrooms for $8.75). Hmm,
maybe the Boeuf Bourguignon
(French beef stew in cognac
and red wine sauce for $8.95),
or possibly the Grillade
D'Agneau a la Provencale
(small loin lamb chops broiled

with rosemary and thyme for
$11.95).
We considered the other
items on the menu which
sounded equally as appetizing.
Eventually, while enjoying our
excellent escargot, we decided
to try the Filets de Sole Aman
dine ($8.95) and the Canard
Aux Peches ($10.95).
Before our dinner arrived we
were served a robust vegetable
soup. A different homemade
soup is served each day. Our
waitress asked us if we pre
ferred to have our salad served
before or after dinner. Being
the New World citizens that we
are, we had our salads after our
soup. The salad was butter let
tuce tossed with a tangy house
dressing.
When our dinners arrived
and we tasted them, our con
fidence in La Cremaillere was
complete.
The sole, sauteed in lemon
and butter and served with
almonds, was obviously very

fresh and very tasty.
The duckling was roasted
and served with a peach sauce.
I had pet ducks as a child and
have had difficulty enjoying
the flavor since that time, how
ever, when my partner and I
exchanged bites, I realized
what I had been missing. It was
delicious. The peach sauce was
delectable but was in no way
overwhelming.

hunger was satisfied, but, ahh
— the desserts.
We certainly couldn't resist
selecting some sweets. I chose
the Vacherin Glace, a mer
ingue topped with vanilla ice
cream, whipped cream,
almonds and chocolate sauce.
It was very good.

My partner selected the
Mousse au Chocolat which was
light arid creamy with just a
hint of rum. The options were
Creme Caramel Renversee,
Omelette Norvegienne (24-
hour notice needed), and the
Dessert Maison du Jour which
was strawberries in cream. We
nibbled our desserts, drank ex
cellent French coffee and en
joyed the peaceful warmth of
the restaurant.

An energetic, large party
would not be well suited to this
restaurant. The clientele was
clearly one that had gone out
for a fine dinner, not for a night
in the City. No party had more
than five people in it — again
an element of the restaurant's
small-tabled intimacy. The age

bracket which patronized La
Cremaillere on the night that
we did spanned the college age
to elderly gamut.
The warm and friendly peo
ple who served us made the
evening complete. We over
heard them mention that they
were short-staffed that night,
but no one would possibly
have noticed. The waitress was
polite and cheerful.
They were attentive and qui
etly served, cleared and reset
the entire dining area, never
looking harried or invoking a
rushed feeling.
Not being a suave speaker of
French myself, I was ap
preciative of our waitress' help
ful interpretations and ex
planations.

San Franciscans know. But the
natives have been hiding a
great secret from us. I wish I'd

delectable but was in no way
overwhelming.
The meal was complete, the

items looked delightful.

hunger was satisfied, but, ahh
— the desserts.
We certainly couldn't resist
selecting some sweets. I chose
the Vacherin Glace, a mer
ingue topped with vanilla ice
cream, whipped cream,
almonds and chocolate sauce.
It was very good.

My partner selected the
Mousse au Chocolat which was
light arid creamy with just a
hint of rum. The options were
Creme Caramel Renversee,
Omelette Norvegienne (24-
hour notice needed), and the
Dessert Maison du Jour which
was strawberries in cream. We
nibbled our desserts, drank ex
cellent French coffee and en
joyed the peaceful warmth of
the restaurant.

An energetic, large party
would not be well suited to this
restaurant. The clientele was
clearly one that had gone out
for a fine dinner, not for a night
in the City. No party had more
than five people in it — again
an element of the restaurant's
small-tabled intimacy. The age

bracket which patronized La
Cremaillere on the night that
we did spanned the college age
to elderly gamut.
The warm and friendly peo
ple who served us made the
evening complete. We over
heard them mention that they
were short-staffed that night,
but no one would possibly
have noticed. The waitress was
polite and cheerful.
They were attentive and qui
etly served, cleared and reset
the entire dining area, never
looking harried or invoking a
rushed feeling.
Not being a suave speaker of
French myself, I was ap
preciative of our waitress' help
ful interpretations and ex
planations.

restaurant route that most non-
San Franciscans know. But the
natives have been hiding a
great secret from us. I wish I'd
found this place sooner.
