## Tennis teams travel, try to triumph at top tourney Women attempt to defend 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Stanford coach Frank Bren
nan and his defending NCAA
champion women's tennis
team travel to a high-elevation
city for the second year in a row
to compete in the NCAA
Championships, which begin
tomorrow.
But things are a bit different
this year.
The city is Albuquerque,
N.M., and not Salt Lake City,
Utah — the site of the 1982
NCAAs.
And the elevation is 4,958
feet above sea level, not the
4,260 in Salt Lake City.
More importantly, though,
Stanford will notenterthe 1983
NCAA tournament as the fa
vorite, a position they oc
cupied a year ago.
The Cardinal is seeded
fourth this year in the team
tournament that starts tomor

row and ends Tuesday. The in
dividual singles and doubles
championships follow the
team competition.
"Last year was considerably
different because we had the
No. 1 team in the country,"
Brennan explained. "It looked
like if we could keep things to
gether, we'd win."
And that's exactly what hap
pened.
With since-graduated Alycia
Moulton playing No. 1 singles
and Kate Gompert, who has
lost her amateur status, at No.
3, Stanford rolled to a perfect
20-0 season, including a 5-4 de
cision over UCLA in the finals.
Without Moulton, Gompert
and a pair of super-subs —
Gayle Chan and Sue
Rasmussen — Stanford com
piled an 18-4 overall recordthis
season and finished third in the
newly-formed and highly com

petitive WCAA with a 9-3 mark.
In fact, so competitive is the
WCAA that four of the top five
seeded teams at Albuquerque
are from it — No. 1 USC, No. 3
UCLA, No. 4 Stanford and No. 5
San Diego State. Trinity is
seeded second.
Despite four losses — two
each to USC and UCLA — and a
No. 4 seeding, Brennan is con
fident. "I really think we're in a
good position this year," he
said.
His only worry is not reach
ing Monday's semi-final round
and not living up to the Card's
No. 4 ranking. The 16 partici
pating teams play their first
round matches tomorrow fol
lowed by the quarterfinals Sun
day.
Getting to the quarterfinals
should not a problem, how
ever. Stanford opens the sin
gle-elimination tournament
tomorrow against 19th-ranked
Princeton, the 13th-seeded
team at Albuquerque.
"You don't want to look past
anyone, but they (Princeton)
are definitely (ranked in the)
second 10," Brennan said. "I
would think we'll be in pretty
good shape.
Princeton, 13-3 overall and
the co-Ivy League champion
with Harvard, features junior
Joy Cummings, ranked 13th by
the ITCA (Intercollegiate Ten
nis Coaches Association) and
151st in the world by the com
puter.
Last year, Cummings upset
No. 1 seeded singles player
Vicki Nelson of Rollins College
and will be matched against
Stanford's Elise Burgin tomor
row. Burgin, who until a pair of
losses last weekend was un
defeated in dual match singles
play, is ranked first in the most
recent ITCA poll.
Princeton's usual No. 2
player — Pia Tomayo — did not
make the trip to Albuquerque
due to illness, Tiger coach Lou
ise Gengler said. That moves
the other five Priceton
netwomen — Jan Shelburne,
Emile Schuette, Hareena
Meghani and Robin Ro
