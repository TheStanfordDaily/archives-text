# Second-seed men on road to Athens
## 
### TOM MOORE 
Ignoring cautious pre
season predictions, the
men's tennis team has stun
ned observers with it fine
performances all year.
Despite suffering an early
defeat to Pepperdine and
deploying a predominantly
freshman lineup through
out the season, the Cardinal
roared to the finest record
in the nation.
Owners of a 20-1 mark
and seeded second at the
NCAA Championships,
which begin tomorrow in
Athens, Georgia, the Card
netters figure to seriously
contend for the team title.
Coach Dick Could attrib
uted his team's success to
practice and improvement.
"We're stronger at each po
sition this year," he ac
knowledged. "We've been
getting solid efforts all sea
son."
Junior Scott Davis will an
chor the No. 1 position.
Sidelined earlier in the sea
son with mononucleosis,
Davis still remains one of
the fop seeds in singles
play, and, as Gould re
marked, "is capable of win
ning the whole thing if he
remains aggressive on the
court."
The tournament will be a
new experience for the
freshmen at the next three
slots, however. John Letts,
Dan Goldie and Eric Rosen
feld have played consis
tently well all season.
"They've come through all
year," Gould said, "and
we're hoping for four
more (wins)."
At Nos. 5 and 6, Mark Mc-
Keen and Jim Grabb will be
key factors in the Cardinal's
success as well.
McKeen, the team cap
tain, has been "very steady
throughout the campaign,"
Gould said, and Grabb has
had an undefeated season.
Grabb's play has shored up
the No. 6 position, which
was a problem the last time
the Card went to the
NCAAs.

In doubles, the Grabb/
McKeen duo have surpas
sed last year's No. 2 doubles
team, and have adjusted
well to each other on the
court.
Nevertheless, the Cardi
nal's doubles efforts are not
as strong as he would like
them to be at this point.
"We need a great perform
ance from our doubles to

stay alive," Could admitted.
"But we've had tremendous
improvementthatcould pay
off."
The Goldie/Rosenfeld
pair have shifted their style
of play throughout the sea
son as well, and hope to put
it all together at No. 3 dou
bles.
At No. 1, the Davis and
Letts team is one of the top

doubles seeds, and expects
continued success in the
tournament. "John has
adapted well to the front
court," Could said. "They
play phenomenally at
times."
Stanford faces Harvard in
the first round tomorrow at
12 noon EDT, with the vVin
ner to face the Arkansas/
UC-Berkeley victor Sunday.
