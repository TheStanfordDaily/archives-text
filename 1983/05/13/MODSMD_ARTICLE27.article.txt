# Stanford's magic number is '1' to clinch 6-Pac title
## Card opens 3-game series with Cal 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
With help from Arizona, who heat the hard
charging Arizona State Sun Devils 5-2 last night,
Stanford opens their final baseball series of the
year today needing to win just one of three
games to clinch the 6-Pac title.
A single victory by Stanford or another win bv
Arizona would give the Cardinal their lirst con
ference title since 1967.
Today's 2:30 p.m. and Sunday's ' p.m. con
tests will be at Sunken Diamond, where the
Cardinal is 23-3. Saturday's 1 p.m. game will be
at Cal. Stanford is only 11-12-1 on the road.
First base All-/ meiica candidate Mike Aldrete
led Stanford to a split of their crucial four-game
series at Southern Cal last weekend. In his last
five outings, Aldrete is on a 12-for-21 (. r >7l)tear,
with five RBl's and two home runs.
Conference officials named Aldrete Pat itic-10
"Player of the Week."
Aldrete's batting production has moved him
into the top spot on Stanford's team with a .387
average.
Eric Hardgrave, who is second on the team in
hitting with a .369 average, knocked in six runs
last weekend to give him a Stanford single
season record of 69. His 20 home runs are well
ahead of the old Stanford one-season mark of
13.
Vince Sakowski (.351) and Mark Davis (.321)
also bolster the Cardinal hitting attack that
boasts a .300 team batting average.
Brian Myers pitched a complete game against

USC last week to improve his record to 8-4.
Steve Cottrell, 6-2, has been the second most
consistent starter for the Cardinal.
Treshman Kevin kunkel, 6-3, has been seeing
consistent starting assignments, but can also be
used for relief.
left Ballard, 6-2, has handled most of the relief
duty for Stanford this season and leads the team
with 23 appearances.
After taking two-of-three games from the
Cardinal in their first series in early April, the
Golden Bears have been on a slide. California,
2 5-34 overall and 9-17 c onference, has lost four
straight games and nine of its last 10.
Despite dismal records due mainly to poor
run production, the California pitching staff has
been effective.
Bryan Price, Nick Esposito and John Cox are
scheduled starters this weekend. The team
earned run average is a respectable 3.94.
Mike Zahn, Dave Hengel and Lance Blanken
ship are Cal's leading hitters. Blankenship leads
the conference in stolen bases with 37, while the
team has compiled a school-record 157 thefts.
Arizona's appeal of a Stanford victory that
charged that the Cardinal dressed too many
players for a home game has been denied by the
conference. But Pac-10 officials attached a stern
warning that any subsequent violations of the
25-player limit would mean automatic forfei
ture.
The Stanford Band will be in attendance at
today's game starting at 2:30 p.m. at Sunken
Diamond.
