Women's crew
Last weekend the women's crew
team encountered their toughest com
petitors, UC-Berkeley and Oregon
State, and won. The victory over Cal
shows that the Cardinal oarswomen are
a dominant force in varsity level rowing
in California. The team is now prepar
ing for the Pac-10 championships at
Redwood Shores near Stanford on May
21 and 22. After the Pac-lOs, the women
are looking forward to the United
States Rowing Association Collegiate
National Championships, which are
held in Madison, Wisconsin.

Surfing
The Stanford surf club is an en
dangered species. The club, after
finishing a successful season surfing up
and down the coast, is near extinction.
The team members are graduating, and
next year there will no longer be a club
â€” unless there are surfers hiding on the
campus who want to participate in a
club. Jim Lightner, surf club member,
advises Southern California surfers not
to be afraid of the surfing conditions in
the North. "The waves are really good
here, and once you get used to the
rougher and colder water it's great," he
said. Lightner thinks it is a shame that
the club is going to fold, and said that
he hopes that it can survive.
Ultimate
The Stanford Ultimate team finished
second in the 16 team Mother's Day
Tournament held last weekend. De
spite injuries to key people Stanford

defeated the California State champ
ions, Santa Barbara 19-17 in a tight semi
final game. Down 14-9 they outscored
the Condors 10-3 winning on a clutch
grab by all-state Rick Geyer. The top
ranked Flying Circus proved to be too
tough an opponent and won the final
18-12. In two weeks, Stanford will host
the Northern California Ultimate
League Championships at Roble Field.
Cycling
The cycling club finished off the sea
son with a successful weekend at Chico
State on Saturday, and UC-Davis on
Sunday. Davis was an important race
for the Card, and they peddled to vic
tory. Brad Chen won the expert time
trial at the race, while cycling phenom
Jenny Keasling won the women's time
trial. In the criterium at Davis, )ohn Fos
ter and Brian Chen took first and sec
ond places respectively. At Chico, Fos
ter was first in the expert division and
Keasling won the women's race.
