# H&S dean laments rise in average professor age
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Citing unusually high tenure rates and the effects of
legislation permitting retirement at a later age, Dean
Norman Wessells of Humanities and Sciences told the
faculty senate in a report yesterday that mean faculty age
is "rising at a distressing rate" and said the mean at his
school is now nearly 48 years.
"Something must be done to guarantee continuing
presence in our departments, laboratories and class
rooms of significant numbers of developing young
scholars," Wessells said.
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Bernard Roth coun
tered Wessels, charging that he was guilty of "ageism"
and likening his remarks to "spouting racism or sexism."
In response, Wessells said, "brain cells die as a func
tion of age. On average, an older faculty is a less vigor
ous faculty."
Efforts to solve the problem should focus on two
areas, according to Wessells. "Major funding for a
Junior Faculty Fellows Program is the highest single de
velopment package for our school," he said.
As part of a program designed to combat the tenure
problem, Wessells also proposed a dramatic change in
the ranking of faculty members and said tenure re
quirements should be stringent.
Calling for the elimination of tenured assistant profes
sorships, Wessells suggested the implementation of a
track which would allow progression from non-tenured
associate professor to assistant professor to the tenured
position of professor.
The number of faculty holding tenured positions in
the School of Humanities and Sciences has risen from 62
percent in 1949 to almost 80 percent today. This com
pares with an average of about 70 percent for 13 major

private universities. More than 30 percent of tenure
track faculty are eventually tenured as compared with
about 10 percent for most Ivy League schools.
On tenure itself, Wessells said, "(A) solid record of
published scholarship and of teaching is now not
enough to guarantee tenure at Stanford. We are now
among the elite research universities of the world, no
person should be granted tenure here who is not de
monstrably excellent as a research scholar."
The rapid growth in the numberof grievances brought
by faculty members denied tenure was also addressed
by Wessells. He attributed the increase to the "dried up"
job market for assistant professors in most Humanities
and Sciences disciplines.
In order to counter "combinations of accusations
never seen a decade ago" outlined in grievance docu
ments "monographic in size," Wessells said, "We must
define our criteria for tenure, describe our time-tested
procedures, apply them with utter equity and fairness,
and insist that it is the University professoriate, not the
aggrieved assistant professor, the attorneys, or the
courts, that determines the rules of the game."
One grievance case which has received much atten
tion recently followed the denial of tenure to former
Asst. History Prof. Estelle Freedman.
In other action, the senate approved unanimously a
proposal made by the Committee on Academic Apprai
sal and Achievement (C-AAA) which will significantly
revise the current teacher evaluation form.
After presenting the proposal to the senate, Prof.
Susan Matisoff, C-AAA head, cited the addage: If it ain't
broke don't fix it. "It's broke," she said.
Although several minor objections
were raised to the simplified form
suggested in the C-AAA proposal,
these were resolved by an amend
ment delegating the authority to
make minor changes in the language
and administration of the evaluations
to the C-AAA. - - , ftni — , „ mam
The senate postponed considera
tion of a resolution calling for an in
quiry into the relationship between
the Hoover Institution and the Uni
versity until the next senate meeting
May 26.
In response to several requests
from faculty members for a state
ment on the Hoover controversy,
University President Donald Ken
nedy said he did not want to "pre
empt the terms of the discussion
which I hope will be forward looking
and constructive in the characteristic
mode of this distinguished body."
