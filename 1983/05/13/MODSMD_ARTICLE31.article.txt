Krukow: no hits thru 6
Cincinnati — Mike Krukow, in his
first appearance since coming off the
disabled list, pitched six hitless innings
before giving way to a pinch hitter, and
three San Francisco pitchers settled for
a two-hitter and a 4-2 victory over the
Cincinnati Reds last night.
Krukow, 1-2, a 31-year-old right
hander, came off the 21-day disabled
list last Sunday after a bout with a sore
right elbow. He was removed for a
pinch-hitter in the top of the seventh
and Jim Barr lost the no-hitter when
Ron Oester tripled off the center-field
wall leading off the eighth.
Krukow struck out four and issued
four walks, two of them in the first in
ning when the Reds scored their first
run. Gary Lavelle came on to get the last
out and record his third save.
