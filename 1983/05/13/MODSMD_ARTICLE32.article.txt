Reviews by Steve Vineberg

The Gay Divorcee (1934) ★
Tresidder Union, Room 270
Based — more or less — on
the Cole Porter show Gay
Divorce, this was the second
film Fred Astaire and Ginger
Rogers made together, and
their first starring vehicle. On
stage two years earlier, Fred had
sung "Night and Day" to Clare
Luce; although all the other
Porter songs were cut from the
film version, this ballad re
mained, and to its strains Fred
and Ginger danced their first —
and, many feel, their finest —
romantic pas de deux. They also
performed "The Continental"
by Herb Magidson and Con
Conrad, which became the first
original song to win an Oscar.
The Cay Divorcee, directed by
Mark Sandrich and featuring
Alice Brady, Edward Everett
Horton, Erik Rhodes, Eric Blore
and (in a small part) Betty
Grable, is one of the great mov
ie musicals.
Plays Monday evening.
You Can't Take It with You
(1938)
Kresge Auditorium
George S. Kaufman and Moss
Hart wrote a wonderful com
edy about a family of noncon
formists who manage to largely
ignore the Depression, but
Frank Capra wasn't satisfied
with it: he had Robert Riskin re
write it in the glorified-little
man mode that was Capra's
trademark. It took the Oscars
for best picture and best direc
tor, but it's overlong (127
minutes), shamelessly preachy,
and not especially well done. In
beefed-up versions of the hero
and heroine roles, jimmy Stew
art and lean Arthur salvage ev
erything they can (Riskin did
write one charming new scene
for them, set in a restaurant),
and Mischa Auer makes an
hilarious Kolenkhov (the Rus
sian dance instructor). But
Lionel Barrymore is no more

convincing as a lovable old
codger here than he would be
as a reprehensible old bastard
in Capra's It's a Wonderful Life
some years later. The cast also
includes Edward Arnold, Spring
Byington, Ann Miller, Samuel S.
Hinds, Donald Meek, H.B.
Warner, Halliwell Hobbes,
Mary Forbes, Dub Taylor and
Eddie Anderson.
Plays tonight.
The French Connection
(1971)
Kresge Auditorium
William Friedkin did a neat,
craftsmanlike job of directing
Ernest Tidyman's script (from a
Robin Cook novel) about the
trackdown of a heroin connec
tion in New York and Paris. And
Gene Hackman is excellent as
"Popeye" Doyle, the tough, in
dividualistic cop in charge of
the case. All told, this bloody
steamroller of a thriller is ter
ribly effective — but it's also a
highly unpleasant experience,
and manipulative in a way that
raises moral questions. The sup
porting cast features Roy
Scheider, Fernando Rey and
Tony Lo Bianco.
Plays tomorrow evening.
All That jazz (1979)
Memorial Auditorium
Perhaps the most dazzling
display of ego ever attempted
by a motion picture director.
Roy Scheider gives a solid,
energetic performance as Joe
Gideon (read Bob Fosse), a mu
sical comedy wizard who is run
ning himself down by simulta
neously rehearsing a Broadway
show (read Chicago), editing a
big-budgeted movie (read Len
ny), and keeping up warm rela
tionships with his mistress (Ann
Reinking), his ex-wife and lead
ing lady (Leland Palmer), and
his daughter (Erzsebet Foldi),
while indulging in occasional
flings with aspiring starlets. Al

though he philanders, he can't
seem to help himself: ev
erywhere he goes, women fling
themselves at him. Besides, he's
so talented. Bob Fosse directed
and choreographed this musi
cal drama about himself, and
his gifts are everywhere in evi
dence — it's beautifully made,
and two-of the numbers are
classics — but the entire project
may give you pause. Giuseppe
Rotunno did the superior
cinematography.
Plays Sunday evening.
Rebel Without a Cause
(1955) ★
Bishop Auditorium
A bad movie of uncommon
resonance. James Dean was al
ready a star in consequence of
his feverous performance as Cal
in Elia Kazan's East of Eden; Re
bel made him a '50s cult hero,
like the young Brando, and
when he died in a car crash the
next year, millions of teenagers
were shattered. (In my own
house, my older brother —
then 15 — put pictures of Dean
up all over the basement.) Even
now, nearly 30 years later, many
movie lovers feel very close to
this movie, in which Dean gives
the quintessential misun
derstood youth performance.
He and the movie override
Stewart Stern's obvious
screenplay and are un
reasonably moving; Nicholas
Ray did the heavy, effective
direction. Jim Backus and Ann
Doran play Dean's parents,
Natalie Wood is the girl who
loves him, Sal Mineo (at his
most histrionic) is his faithful
spaniel. Dennis Hopper has a
small part.
Plays tonight.
Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf? (1966) ★
Lagunita Dining Room; Larkin
West Lounge
Edward Albee's drama of

marital games played at a small
New England college is certain
ly brilliant, though he's not real
ly enough of a poet to carry off
the blatant theatrical devices he
employs (as, say, Tennessee
Williams does in A Streetcar
Named Desire and The Class
Menagerie). But Albee has con
structed a real workout for four
actors. Mike Nichols directed
this much praised film version,
which won a battle against the
censors (though Ernest
Lehman's script is a little tamer
than the stage play) and was
thus a breakthrough "adult"
picture. It's a classy production
(and a lot of credit goes to the
photographer, Haskell Wexler,
and the composer, Alex North)
and pretty good, too, though
not quite as earth-shattering as
critics have often claimed. Eliz
abeth Taylor won an Oscar for
her brassy performance as
Martha, but this is one of those
cases (like Sunset Boulevard
and the Judy Garland-James
Mason A Star Is Born) when a
strong, vociferous star received
more attention than a finer,
subtler one: Taylor is commen
dable but Richard Burton is
amazing. The secondary couple
— theguests — are played by an
aggravating, actressy Sandy
Dennis and an unmemorable
George Segal.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
Tuesday (Larkin).
Swept Away by an Unusual
Destiny in the Blue Sea of
August (1975)
Fox, Redwood City
Lina Wertmuller's variation
on J.M. Barrie's The Admirable
Crichton stars Mariangela
Melato as the aristocrat and
Giancarlo Giannini, with his
deep, soulful eyes and wonder
ful deadpan mug, as the re
sourceful plebe who takes
command when the two of
them are marooned together

on an island. The first part of the
movie is a loud, vigorous politi
cal cartoon, not good but not
unenjoyable, but then Giannini
begins to brutalize Melato and
to deny her sexual satisfaction
until, half crazed with desire for
him, she confesses she adores
him and caresses his foot. And
the film rapidly loses what little
appeal it had. Under a guise of
class satire which has fooled a
surprisingly large number of
people, Wertmuller has made a
repulsively misogynous fable
that resurrects the old line
about the pure-souled roman
tic male who is misunderstood,
mistreated and finally aban
doned by a fatuous bitch. The
sole warmth derives from Ennio
Guarnieri's photography,
Plays Wednesday with
Seduced and Abandoned.
National Velvet (1945) ★
Fox, Redwood City
The reputation of this cele
brated children's film is fully
justified. Elizabeth Taylor gives
a classic performance as the girl
who loves, trains and races a
magnificent horse named The
Pie, and she looks more beau
tiful than any child has the right
to be — almost spookily beau
tiful. Theodore Reeves and
Helen Deutsch adapted the
popular book by Enid Bagnold,
and the underrated Clarence
Brown, who had a gift for direc
ting children (see Claude
Jarman, Jr. in Intruder in the
Dust), was at the helm. Eliz
abeth Taylor is surrounded by
troupers, notably Mickey
Rooney, Anne Revere (who
won the Supporting Actress Os
car that year), Donald Crisp,
Angela Lansbury, Reginald
Owen, Jackie "Butch" Jenkins,
Arthur Treacher and Arthur
Shields.
Plays today and tomorrow
with My Friend Flicka.
