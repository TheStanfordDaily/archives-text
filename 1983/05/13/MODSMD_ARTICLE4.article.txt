Stanford is now a university with a mission.
In a recently issued report, the "mission" of
Stanford University was formally stated by the
Management and Organization Study Group,
headed by Assoc. Provost Michael Oman. Ac
cording to University President Donald Ken
nedy, this is the first written statement of pur-
and objectives 'hat Stanford ha? ha H
recent years.
"My goal is to keep the document alive
through occasional reviews and revisions reflect
ing Stanford's vitality and changing circum
stances," said Kennedy. "It will, I hope, lead to
lively discussions about the purposes of the Uni
versity and stimulate comments from the Stan
ford community."
Though the objectives are broad, they do de
fine areas of concern in the coming years. They
are also backed up by specific plans at each level

of the University.
In admissions, the University reaffirmed its
commitment to need-blind admissions and af
firmative action, and stated that "both individual
merit and diversity of the student population
shall be the criteria for admitting students."
In the academic area one of the main objec
tives is to improve the undergraduate cur
riculum, through introducing more multi
quarter sequence courser., providing more hon
ors and seminar work, and allowing under
graduates to participate more in research.
Another objective is recruitment of minority
and women faculty, and rigorous standards for
promotion. "Only the truly outstanding should
serve on the faculty," the report stated.
One objective which Oman said he feels will
be achieved within five years is the establishment
of an innovation fund. This fund would allow
continuing revision of curriculum in response to
changing requirements in research and teach

ing. "We would need to find external or internal
support to make grants to faculty and depart
ments to stimulate new programs," Oman said.
An issue which has emerged recently is that of
corporate research support. The University plans
to establish policies that allow "flexible re
sponses" to these emerging patterns, while still
"maintaining the University's essential commit
ment to academic freedom," the report stated.
In ;,tudcnt affairs, a big piiOiily is to tevise
residential policies such as the guaranteed hous
ing plan and returning residence, in response to
the new housing on campus.
Another objective in this area is to "help stu
dents recognize and appreciate racial, religious,
socioeconomic and other differences at Stan
ford." According to Norm Robinson, acting dean
of residential education, programs to achieve
this goal include the recent "Building Bridges"
workshop, Race Awareness week, resident ad-
