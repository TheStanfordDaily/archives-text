Senate nixes budget plans
Washington — The Senate, closely divided
over taxes and deficits, rejected three budget
plans yesterday, including one sponsored by
Republican leaders with the tacit support of
President Reagan.
Seeking to avoid an unprecedented break
down of the congressional budget process, the
Senate ordered its Budget Committee to go
back to the drawing board and send another
proposal to the floor for action Tuesday or
Wednesday.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.) said he hoped committee members
would "use their tender mercies to come to

gether on a true bipartisan basis" and produce
an acceptable budget for the fiscal year begin
ning Oct. 1.
Although the Senate has yet to produce a
budget after nearly 47 hours of debate, it has
made several key political points, all bad news
for Reagan. The president apparently has lost
considerable control of the budget process and
may get only 50 percent to 60 percent of his de
fense request. He also may havetoaccept signif
icantly higher tax increases than he wants for
the next two years.
The first evidence of that came yesterday,
when a group of Republican moderates helped
scuttle the low-tax, high-deficit plan developed
by Senate GOP leaders with Reagan's qualified

blessing. That plan was defeated 52-48, with sev
en Republicans supporting a motion by Sen.
Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) to table, and thus kill, the
GOP leadership plan.
The Republican moderates then failed, on a
53-46 vote, to win approval of their own budget
proposal, which called for higher taxes and less
defense spending than the leadership plan in a
bid to reduce huge projected deficits over the
next several years. But Sen. Slade Gorton (R-
Wash.) a sponsor of the plan, predicted that the
Senate would wind up with something close to
the GOP moderates' proposal next week.
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici
(R-N.M.) indicated that he agreed.
MX funds approved
Washington — President Reagan yesterday
committed himself to a new "build-down" ap
proach for U.S. strategic nuclear arms control
proposals, in which more atomic warheads
would be destroyed than deployed in the
future by both superpowers.
After pledging to senators that he would
pursue this approach actively, Reagan promptly
won another congressional vote releasing mon
ey for the controversial MX intercontinental
ballistics missile that Congress blocked last year.
The Senate Appropriations Committee voted
17-11 to approve $625 million for the MX. This
includes $560 million for engineering and $65
million for flight testing the mammoth missile,
which will carry 10 nuclear warheads.
A House Appropriations subcommittee also
gave the green light to the MX on Wednesday
after Reagan sent House members a letter
pledging his flexibility in nuclear arms control
negotiations with the Soviet Union.
In a similar letter yesterday to Sens. Sam Nunn
(D-Ga.), William Cohen (R-Maine) and Charles
Percy (R-lll.), Reagan committed himself to the
build-down approach, but was vague about
how it will be incorporated into revised U.S.
proposals when the strategic arms reduction
talks (START) resume at Geneva next month.
However, all three senators praised the presi
dent's letter.
Israel reduces troops
Jerusalem — Israel has gradually reduced its
military presence in Lebanon over the winter
and now has fewer than 20,000 soldiers in that
country, according to diplomatic and Israeli
military sources.
Despite warnings by Syria and the Soviet
Union that renewed fighting could erupt at any
moment in eastern Lebanon, there has been no
significant Israeli military buildup in Lebanon in
recent weeks, the sources said. As a result, they
said, the Israeli force of between 15,000 and
20,000 troops faces a Syrian force of close to
50,000 in Lebanon and along the Syrian-Leba
nese border, including about 40,000 combat
troops in the Bekaa valley.
The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot said this
week that Israeli troop strength in Lebanon had
shrunk to 15,000. This figure was confirmed as
roughly correct although sources indicated
there may be slightly more than 15,000.
For several months the generally published
estimate of the numberof Israeli troops in Leba
non had been 30,000. During the height of the
war, Israel had more than 100,000 soldiers there.
Military sources gave three reasons why Israel
is content to have about a 3-to-1 manpower dis
advantage along the line separating it from the
Syrians.
Fighters return to Lebanon
Beirut — Over the last nine months,
thousands of Palestine Liberation Organization
guerrilla fighting men have abandoned their
isolated outposts in the Arab world and have re
turned to face the Israelis in Lebanon's Bekaa
Valley.
They have trickled back, a few at a time, from
bases in such places as South Yemen and Alger
ia, two of the eight Arab countries that agreed
to take them in when they were forced by the
Israeli invasion to evacuate from Beirut last Au
gust.
According to U.S. and Israeli government
sources, as well as information gathered in
Beirut, there has been a major increase in the

number of guerrillas in the Bekaa Valley and in
northern Lebanon since last summer, with
some saying that the total is roughly double
what it was rigafter the evacuation. The esti
mates of the numbers vary, with U.S. sources
providing the highest figures.
U.S. government sources in Washington said
their best estimate is that there are 12,000 PLO
guerrillas in Lebanon, of which about 4000 have
entered the country since last summer's with
drawal. About 1000 of the new arrivals reported
ly have arrived in the past week to 10 days, the
U.S. sources said.
Reagan loses black support
Washington — Several black appointees in
the Reagan administration said this week that
the White House has written off blacks political
ly for the 1984 campaign. They cited as one ex
ample the fact that the White House office of
public liaison has had no one dealing with
blacks for more than two months.
One senior White House official said the ad
ministration has decided that no effort in the
next 17 months would be sufficient to moderate
the opposition of blacks to Reagan and capture
a sufficient amount of the black vote. He said
most of the White House staff, including Faith
Whittlesey, assistant to the president for public
liaison, have made the same assessment.
Whittlesey's public liaison office, which is
preparing a political operation to try to win key
blue-collar, female and ethnic votes for Presi
dent Reagan in 1984, also has had no represent
ative to Hispanics since she took over the office
in March.
Tax bill sent to house
Washington — The House Ways and Means
Committee, forced into complete retreat by the
banking industry, yesterday voted to send to
the House floor a bill to repeal a year-old pro
vision calling for withholding of taxes on
dividend and interest income.
The bill would prevent withholding from
starting as scheduled July 1. It would cost the
Treasury an estimated $13.4 billion through
1988, much of it in taxes on income that now
goes unreported.
The banking industry has lobbied intensively
to kill the withholding. Rep. Thomas Downey
(D-N.Y.) yesterday denounced Ways and
Means' decision to yield, saying it would "send
a signal that the Congress of the United States is
a group of patsies to any well-organized
group."
Woman hijacks jet to Cuba
Miami — A woman armed with a flare pistol
hijacked a Capitol Air jet carrying 248 people to
Cuba late last night, and the unharmed passen
gers were flown early Friday to Miami, where
federal officials waited to question them.
The hijacker got off the plane in Havana and
"no one knows what the Cubans have done
with this woman," Capitol Air dispatcher
Courtney Knox said in a telephone interview
from the carrier's Smyrna, Tenn., dispatch cen
ter.
No passengers or crew members were in
jured, he sa'd.
It was the second time this month that Capitol
Air Flight 236 has been hijacked.
The DC-8, flying from San Juan, Puerto Rico,
to Chicago with a stop in Miami, was comman
deered at 8:12 p.m. EDT, only minutes before it
should have touched down in Miami, Federal
Aviation Administration Jack Barker in Atlanta
said in a telephone interview.
The plane landed at Jose Marti International

Airport in Havana at 9:06 p.m. After a three
hour layover, the plane left Cuba at 12:14 a.m.
and arrived in Miami at 12:57 a.m.
Man accused of forgery
Stuttgart, West Germany — A West German
newspaper said yesterday that a Stuttgart
merchant in Nazi paraphernalia wrote the
bogus Hitler diaries and sold them to Stern
magazine for nearly $4 million.
The daily Stuttgarter Nachrichten, quoting
what it called "reliable informants," said
Konrad Fischer, alias Konrad Kujau, com
plained to friends 15 months ago that he was
compelled to write "day and night" and was to
tally exhausted by the ordeal.
Fischer, described as a designer and calli
grapher with a zealous interest in Third Reich
artifacts, also showed one informant a suitcase
stuffed with nearly 3 million marks ($1.2 mil
lion), the newspaper reported in a story which
will be published today.
Gerd Heidemann, the 51-year-old Hamburg
reporter who acquired the 62 volumes for Stern
and now faces a lawsuit for fraud by his former
employers, admitted this week that Fischer was
the source for the fake diaries.
Californian wins Miss USA
Knoxville, Tenn. — A teary-eyed Julie Lynne
Hayek, the 22-year-old Miss California, was
crowned Miss USA 1983 in a nationally televised
pageant last night.
The 5-foot, 10-inch student from Westwood,
Calif., won more than $150,000 in cash and
prizes and will advance to the Miss Universe
pageant July 11 in St. Louis, where she will com
pete with representatives from 75 other coun
tries'.
The 1982 Miss USA,Terri Utley of Cabot, Ark.,
placed the crown over the long, light brown
hair of the smiling Hayek, a part-time model
and actress and a senior at the University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles.
Researchers find AIDS' clue
Washington — A rare virus that causes cancer
has been detected in some patients who have
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, ac
cording to research published Friday. The dis
covery is the strongest clue yet to the cause of
AIDS, a disease that destroys the body's im
mune system.
Researchers are unsure of whether this
means that the virus causes the disease or sim
ply affects patients after they become ill with
AIDS.
Researchers at the Harvard School of Public
Health, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and
the Pasteur Institute all found signs of human T
cell leukemia viruses in some patients with
AIDS, as well as those with an illness that may
precede the disease, according to research pub
lished today in the journal Science.
