Senate nixes budget plans
Washington â€” The Senate, closely divided
over taxes and deficits, rejected three budget
plans yesterday, including one sponsored by
Republican leaders with the tacit support of
President Reagan.
Seeking to avoid an unprecedented break
down of the congressional budget process, the
Senate ordered its Budget Committee to go
back to the drawing board and send another
proposal to the floor for action Tuesday or
Wednesday.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-
Tenn.) said he hoped committee members
would "use their tender mercies to come to

gether on a true bipartisan basis" and produce
an acceptable budget for the fiscal year begin
ning Oct. 1.
Although the Senate has yet to produce a
budget after nearly 47 hours of debate, it has
made several key political points, all bad news
for Reagan. The president apparently has lost
considerable control of the budget process and
may get only 50 percent to 60 percent of his de
fense request. He also may havetoaccept signif
icantly higher tax increases than he wants for
the next two years.
The first evidence of that came yesterday,
when a group of Republican moderates helped
scuttle the low-tax, high-deficit plan developed
by Senate GOP leaders with Reagan's qualified

blessing. That plan was defeated 52-48, with sev
en Republicans supporting a motion by Sen.
Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) to table, and thus kill, the
GOP leadership plan.
The Republican moderates then failed, on a
53-46 vote, to win approval of their own budget
proposal, which called for higher taxes and less
defense spending than the leadership plan in a
bid to reduce huge projected deficits over the
next several years. But Sen. Slade Gorton (R-
Wash.) a sponsor of the plan, predicted that the
Senate would wind up with something close to
the GOP moderates' proposal next week.
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici
(R-N.M.) indicated that he agreed.
