# Construction set for new research center
## 
### KEVIN GROSS Staff writer 
Groundbreaking ceremonies next
Thursday for the new Center for In
tegrated Systems (CIS) building will
hail the beginning of a joint venture
between private industry and the
University into scientific research on
integrated systems.
Construction of the $14.5 million
building will begin soon thereafter at
the site, which is located near the
intersection of Campus Drive and Via
Palou.
Richard Reis, director of career de
velopment at CIS, said, "The center
is unique There is nothing like it in
the United States. It brings together
three components: industry, the
federal government, and the Univer
sity."
It is not uncommon for the federal
government to fund research, as it
currently provides a significant por
tion of the funding for University re
search programs. What makes con
struction of the center unique is that
it is being made possible by dona
tions of $750,000 from each of 19 pri
vate corporations, including Xerox,
IBM and Hewlett-Packard.
Indeed, Reis said, an inherent goal
of CIS is to eliminate reliance on
government funding by eventually
having close to 50 percent of its
money provided by private corpora
tions.
Initially, however, the govern
ment, through its various depart
ments, will be sponsoring most of
the CIS research. According to Elec
trical Engineering Prof. )ohn Linvill,
co-director of CIS, "The government
will be the principal base for funding
research. The companies are provid
ing the building, but we expect that
the companies will also be funding
research."
Repeatedly in the past, members
of the faculty have expressed the im
portance of maintaining indepen
dence from restrictions on research
from outside influences, namely
government and private industry.
Reis said that the center will give fac
ulty members more independence
by freeing them from the necessity to
rely solely on government funding

for research projects.
"The engineers feel we need more
input from industry on research pro
grams," Reis said.
Moreover, Linvill said that CIS
"broadens our academic freedom"
by diversifying the funding of re
search. Private industry will provide a
different perspective on research
than the federal government.
Reis added that the ties which will
be created with industry will help to
keep the faculty aware of what the
problems are in industry, and vice
versa.
Not surprisingly, the electronics
industry also wants to work with the
nation's universities in research pro
grams. "They see it in their long-term
interests to have this research being
conducted at one of America's lead
ing universities," Reis said.
Prof. James Meindl, the other co
director of CIS, agreed. "It's to their
benefit to use us for long-range re
search, that nourishes the roots of
new product ideas," Meindl said.
According to Reis, everything that
comes out of the center is "public
knowledge and public information."
While he noted that the University
may consider licensing certain dis
coveries, nobody, including the
sponsoring companies, will be given
an exclusive license.
"The University has to be open by
its very nature," Linvill added.
"People will be able to learn what's
going on at the center by visiting and
reading the results in reports."
The center is not a department. It is
an integration of research into com
puter hardware, software, fabrica
tions, VLSI (very large scale inte
grated) circuits, and applications. All
faculty members associated with the
center are members of other Univer
sity departments, and may voluntar
ily affiliate with CIS.
Included among these depart
ments are Computer Science, Math
ematics, Applied Physics, Electrical
Engineering and Mechanical En
gineering. Graduate students in
these disciplines may also become
involved in CIS.
