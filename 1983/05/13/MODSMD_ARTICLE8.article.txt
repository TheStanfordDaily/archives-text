## New hospital names project director 
### PAM CLOYD 
Langston Trigg has been named
project director of the new Chil
dren's Hospital at Stanford, accord
ing to Lawrence Crowley, new
chairman of the joint board and Uni
versity vice-president for medical af
fairs.
"He was selected after an exten
sive search that was, in fact, nation
wide," explained Crowley, who an
nounced the decision earlier this
week. "He was the top candidate."
In his new position, Trigg's first re
sponsibility will be supervising the
planning and construction of the
new $40 million Children's Hospital,
slated for completion in May 1987.
The project will merge the pediatric
facilities of Stanford University Hos
pital and Children's Hospital.
"The whole board is very en
thusiastic about the project," said
Trigg. "Our challenge is to retain the
human element conducive to chil
dren's health care while keeping
pace with new highly technical med
ical developments."
Crowley cited Trigg's experience
as facilities planner and project man
ager at Children's Hospital Medical
Center in Oakland and his "demon
strated ability" at Stanford in his un
qualified praise of Trigg.
Trigg, who has served as assistant
director of facilities/projects of Stan
ford University Medical Center since

1980, will assume nis new position on
June 6, 1983.
Prior to coming to Stanford, Trigg
was facilities planner and project
manager at Children's Hospital Med
ical Center in Oakland, where he
headed up a $36 million new building
project.
The new hospital will be physically
attached to Stanford University Hos
pital. Presently, Stanford and the
Children's Hospital are running their
pediatric programs from separate lo
cations under the direction of the
Medical School. About 2500 patients
yearly are shuttled one mile across a
busy thoroughfare between the hos
pitals for specialized treatment at
Stanford.
"The separateness results in in
convenience to patients, duplication
of services and higher costs," ex
plained Crowley.
The new facility will house the 60
beds of Children's Hospital and the
44 pediatric acute medical-surgical
and intensive care beds of Stanford
Hospital. It will also accommodate
the Children's Ambulatory Care Cen
ter, which provides for such spe
cialties as cardiology, oncology and
child psychiatry.
"Right now, we're just in the pro
cess of looking into needs," said
Trigg. "It's not been determined
what kind of organization the plan
ning committee will have."

but he and Crowley are both ready
to get underway. "We look forward
to getting into high gear," Crowley
said.
The existing Children's Hospital at
520 Willow Road in Palo Alto will con
tinue to operate until the new build
ing is completed.
The main source of funding for the
project is a $20 million gift from
David and Lucille Packard. "We want
to help develop the finest Children's
Hospital in the country and have it
physically and intellectually con
nected to an outstanding university
medical center such as Stanford,"
the Packards said earlier this year.
Both are well-known for their ac
tive support of education and com
munity betterment. The gift, known
as the David and Lucille Packard New
Children's Hospital Fund, consti
tutes the "largest personal pledge
either institution has received since
their founding," according to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
"It has given us a truly magnificent
start for our comprehensive goal to
consolidate all children's services in
a new Children's Hospital."
The gifts, Kennedy has said, will
also complement the present efforts
of the University to modernize Stan
ford Hospital and research facilities
of the Medical School.

said.
The existing Children's Hospital at
520 Willow Road in Palo Alto will con
tinue to operate until the new build
ing is completed.
The main source of funding for the
project is a $20 million gift from
David and Lucille Packard. "We want
to help develop the finest Children's
Hospital in the country and have it
physically and intellectually con
nected to an outstanding university
medical center such as Stanford,"
the Packards said earlier this year.
Both are well-known for their ac
tive support of education and com
munity betterment. The gift, known
as the David and Lucille Packard New
Children's Hospital Fund, consti
tutes the "largest personal pledge
either institution has received since
their founding," according to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy.
"It has given us a truly magnificent
start for our comprehensive goal to
consolidate all children's services in
a new Children's Hospital."
The gifts, Kennedy has said, will
also complement the present efforts
of the University to modernize Stan
ford Hospital and research facilities
of the Medical School.
