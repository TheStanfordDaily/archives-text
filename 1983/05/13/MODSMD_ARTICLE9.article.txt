## Many options for co-term students 
### JESSICA NEIGHBOR 
Like Reg Pack and the soror
ity rush, the coterminal pro
gram here seems to be one of
those collegiate phantoms that
many students have heard of
but one which few can explain.
And yet, this educational op
tion some say is too good to
discard as readily as loose
paper or social convention.
Just what does going cotermi
nal mean?
According to Tania Granoff,
of the Academic Information
Center, going coterm essen
tially means committing one
self to beyond 180 units of di
rected study. However, specu
lation envelops this unique of
fering, and its definition ranges
widely. Some students suggest
it is a refuge for seniors with
cold feet — a way to avoid the
realities of life in a non
sheltered environment.
Others call it the greatest edu
cational bargain since public
education.
In reality, the program is
neither easy nor inexpensive,
as it entails completing 225
units of credit and paying an
additional year of Stanford tui
tion. However, for some stu
dents, particularly those with
AP credits or specific career
goals, going coterm means a
fast road to earning two
bachelor's degrees, or to be
ginning coursework toward a
master's degree while still an
undergraduate.
The key concept of the
Coterminal program is simul
taneity. Both the graduate and
undergraduate branches share
the attractive feature of allow
ing students to work toward
more than one degree at once.
The undergraduate program,
arranged through the Regis
trar's office, resembles a com
bination of two other academic
tracks — the double major and
the BAS degree. Like double
majors, undergraduate
coterms complete major re
quirements in two academic
departments. Unlike the singu-

Ia r double major degree,
coterms receive two degrees at
graduation, both an AB and a
BS. This option is a surprising
companion to University pol
icy which stipulates that stu
dents will not be awarded
more than one bachelor of arts
or bachelor of science degree.
Students who have completed
major requirements in two Art
or two Science departments
cannot receive separate de
grees in each, but must double
major under one degree, for
example, receive an AB in En
glish and Psychology.
The advantage of the coter
minal program for students
considering working towards
an AB after completing their BS
coursework or vice versa, is

that they need not finish one
degree before beginning the
other, nor do they have to
apply for candidacy or re
register. As opposed to receiv
ing a BAS degree, with one arts
and one sciences major within
180 units, coterms can pursue
each field more leisurely in an
additional 45 unit period. The
problem with thedouble major
and the BAS, says Granoff, who
has "mixed feelings about the
idea," is that students trying to
pack their required course
work into 180 units tend to be
come too narrowly focused,
denying themselves "that
breadth which is essential to

undergraduate education."
The main detriment of the
program, while it does encour
age broad education, is its
esotericism. Clearly, its feasi
bility is limited to students with
interests and abilities varied
enough to take them through a
rigorous study of both arts and
sciences.
In this respect, the cotermi
nal graduate program, ad
ministered through the
Graduate Program Office, is
more flexible. As in the under
graduate case, coterm
graduates work toward two
degrees at once, completing
an additional 45 units of
graduate work beyond the un
dergraduate 180. At the end of
the program, these students
receive both a bachelor's and
master's degree. Unlike the
undergraduate program, both
degrees can be in the same
general field of arts or sci
ences, and even in the same
specific department. Contrary
to some misconceptions, this
program does not enable stu
dents to obtain a master's de
gree more easily than by the
standard graduate school track
— once admitted to the school,
coterm students follow the
same course as other graduate
students. What distinguishes
the program from the regular
route is that it lets students mix
undergraduate and graduate
courses, beginning their
graduate studies before meet
ing all the bachelor's degree
requirements.
Apart from specific course
work, the two coterminal pro
grams differ in relative ease of
application and admission. For
the undergraduate program,
the process is simple — in
terested students declare one
major in the usual way and
then petition for the second by
their tenth or eleventh quarter.
The petition itself is non
competitive, according to
Granoff, more a "statement of
intent" than a request for can
didacy. The process for coter

minal graduates is more selec
tive. In approximately junior
year (technically after their
eighth quarter or 105 units),
candidates apply directly to the
departments in which they will
be working. Some potential
coterms may be disappointed
to learn that the program does
not guarantee escape from the
Graduate Record Exam, that
bane of college seniors. Most
departments now require it, as
well as the standard written
application and letters of ref
erence. According to Pat Weiss
of the GPO, recent trends tend
toward making the coterminal
program just as competitive as
admissions from the outside,
and as involved in terms of
paperwork and fees.
If the coterminal program
does not mean an easy entr
ance to graduate school, what
attracts the annual slew of
applicants? More than 235
applied in 1982. Many say
"continuity." They believe that
the opportunity to study with
familiar professors and fellow
students enhances their edu
cation, that they are better
prepared for the graduate
studies because of acquain
tance with the undergraduate
program.
Also, combining degrees al
lows them to establish a broad
educational base at the under
graduate level, while gaining
marketable specialization in a
graduate area. An undergrad
interested in computer sci
ences or operations research
can't pursue either field for a
bachelor's degree. However, a
major in math sciences can si
multaneously complete
coterminal work in either
graduate area. Proponents
claim that after five years, such
a student has thorough prepa
ration for a professional
career. Said Lynnea Griep, a
math sciences major, "Sure,
the coterminal program is a
loss of time and money, but it
puts you at an incredible ad
vantage when you leave."

coterms may be disappointed
to learn that the program does
not guarantee escape from the
Graduate Record Exam, that
bane of college seniors. Most
departments now require it, as
well as the standard written
application and letters of ref
erence. According to Pat Weiss
of the GPO, recent trends tend
toward making the coterminal
program just as competitive as
admissions from the outside,
and as involved in terms of
paperwork and fees.
If the coterminal program
does not mean an easy entr
ance to graduate school, what
attracts the annual slew of
applicants? More than 235
applied in 1982. Many say
"continuity." They believe that
the opportunity to study with
familiar professors and fellow
students enhances their edu
cation, that they are better
prepared for the graduate
studies because of acquain
tance with the undergraduate
program.
Also, combining degrees al
lows them to establish a broad
educational base at the under
graduate level, while gaining
marketable specialization in a
graduate area. An undergrad
interested in computer sci
ences or operations research
can't pursue either field for a
bachelor's degree. However, a
major in math sciences can si
multaneously complete
coterminal work in either
graduate area. Proponents
claim that after five years, such
a student has thorough prepa
ration for a professional
career. Said Lynnea Griep, a
math sciences major, "Sure,
the coterminal program is a
loss of time and money, but it
puts you at an incredible ad
vantage when you leave."

Like Reg Pack and the soror
ity rush, the coterminal pro
gram here seems to be one of
those collegiate phantoms that
many students have heard of
but one which few can explain.
And yet, this educational op
tion some say is too good to
discard as readily as loose
paper or social convention.
Just what does going cotermi
nal mean?
According to Tania Granoff,
of the Academic Information
Center, going coterm essen
tially means committing one
self to beyond 180 units of di
rected study. However, specu
lation envelops this unique of
fering, and its definition ranges
widely. Some students suggest
it is a refuge for seniors with
cold feet — a way to avoid the
realities of life in a non
sheltered environment.
Others call it the greatest edu
cational bargain since public
education.
In reality, the program is
neither easy nor inexpensive,
as it entails completing 225
units of credit and paying an
additional year of Stanford tui
tion. However, for some stu
dents, particularly those with
AP credits or specific career
goals, going coterm means a
fast road to earning two
bachelor's degrees, or to be
ginning coursework toward a
master's degree while still an
undergraduate.
The key concept of the
Coterminal program is simul
taneity. Both the graduate and
undergraduate branches share
the attractive feature of allow
ing students to work toward
more than one degree at once.
The undergraduate program,
arranged through the Regis
trar's office, resembles a com
bination of two other academic
tracks — the double major and
the BAS degree. Like double
majors, undergraduate
coterms complete major re
quirements in two academic
departments. Unlike the singu-

Ia r double major degree,
coterms receive two degrees at
graduation, both an AB and a
BS. This option is a surprising
companion to University pol
icy which stipulates that stu
dents will not be awarded
more than one bachelor of arts
or bachelor of science degree.
Students who have completed
major requirements in two Art
or two Science departments
cannot receive separate de
grees in each, but must double
major under one degree, for
example, receive an AB in En
glish and Psychology.
The advantage of the coter
minal program for students
considering working towards
an AB after completing their BS
coursework or vice versa, is

that they need not finish one
degree before beginning the
other, nor do they have to
apply for candidacy or re
register. As opposed to receiv
ing a BAS degree, with one arts
and one sciences major within
180 units, coterms can pursue
each field more leisurely in an
additional 45 unit period. The
problem with thedouble major
and the BAS, says Granoff, who
has "mixed feelings about the
idea," is that students trying to
pack their required course
work into 180 units tend to be
come too narrowly focused,
denying themselves "that
breadth which is essential to

undergraduate education."
The main detriment of the
program, while it does encour
age broad education, is its
esotericism. Clearly, its feasi
bility is limited to students with
interests and abilities varied
enough to take them through a
rigorous study of both arts and
sciences.
In this respect, the cotermi
nal graduate program, ad
ministered through the
Graduate Program Office, is
more flexible. As in the under
graduate case, coterm
graduates work toward two
degrees at once, completing
an additional 45 units of
graduate work beyond the un
dergraduate 180. At the end of
the program, these students
receive both a bachelor's and
master's degree. Unlike the
undergraduate program, both
degrees can be in the same
general field of arts or sci
ences, and even in the same
specific department. Contrary
to some misconceptions, this
program does not enable stu
dents to obtain a master's de
gree more easily than by the
standard graduate school track
— once admitted to the school,
coterm students follow the
same course as other graduate
students. What distinguishes
the program from the regular
route is that it lets students mix
undergraduate and graduate
courses, beginning their
graduate studies before meet
ing all the bachelor's degree
requirements.
Apart from specific course
work, the two coterminal pro
grams differ in relative ease of
application and admission. For
the undergraduate program,
the process is simple — in
terested students declare one
major in the usual way and
then petition for the second by
their tenth or eleventh quarter.
The petition itself is non
competitive, according to
Granoff, more a "statement of
intent" than a request for can
didacy. The process for coter

minal graduates is more selec
tive. In approximately junior
year (technically after their
eighth quarter or 105 units),
candidates apply directly to the
departments in which they will
be working. Some potential
coterms may be disappointed
to learn that the program does
not guarantee escape from the
Graduate Record Exam, that
bane of college seniors. Most
departments now require it, as
well as the standard written
application and letters of ref
erence. According to Pat Weiss
