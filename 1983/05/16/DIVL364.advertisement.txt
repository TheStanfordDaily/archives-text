TO STANFORD FACULTY
We would appreciate your endorsement of the following
statement, to be submitted to President Kennedy, Provost
Hastorf, the Academic Senate, and the Board of Trustees.
IN DEFENSE OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM
The undersigned professors at Stanford University deplore and oppose the investigation of the
political orientation of the Hoover Institution, although we have no objection to an impartial
assessment of the scholarly excellence and achievements of Hoover appointees.
I he claim that 1 loover js to be investigated for political rather than conservative bias, that an
investigation would he requested even if Hoover's orientation were liberal, strikes us as disingeneous.
We are convinced that no such investigation would be contemplated if Hoover's bias were liberal
rather than conservative. Hoover's tics with the Reagan Administration disturb us no more than the
preeminent role played by Harvard professors in the Kennedy Administration some time ago. when
no requests were made that Harvard be investigated for services rendered to the country's
government.
We are concerned by the dangerous precedent such an investigation would represent both inside
and outside of the University. Since practices deemed improper at Hoover could not be tolerated in
the University's schools, departments and programs, similar investigations may be requested of
Stanford departments which may appear too liberal or too conservative or too radical. We are also
concerned about the fate of numerous institutes and programs associated with collegesand universities
all over the country. the political orientation of which is mostly liberal, sometimes conservative, rarely
radical. Stanford's investigation of Hoover's politics could set a precedent for similar investigations of
joint institutions elsewhere, resulting in a generalized witch-hunt with liberals trying to track down
conservative bi;is while conservatives would strive to expose liberal prejudice.
Because of the grave threat it poses to academic freedom, we urge you to oppose the investigation
of the Hoover Instituion's political orientation and associations.
