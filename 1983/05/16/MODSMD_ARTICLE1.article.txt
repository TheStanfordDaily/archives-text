# University considered Hoover study before petitions
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
The administrative response to the cur
rent Hoover Institution debate has been one
of calm concern. In fact, William Kimball,
chairman of the University Board of Trustees
said Friday that although the idea of an "in
quiry" probing the "political partisanship"
of Hoover is unlikely, fie and University Pres
ident Donald Kennedy discussed conduct
ing a "study" of the institution long before
any of the current debate began.
"Don and I had thought of doing this be
fore any of the petitions," Kimball said. "I
wouldn't want people to think the petitions
were the catalyst of our concern."
In reference to recent criticisms of Hoover,
Kimball said, "Don, the Board of Overseers
and I hope to cool the furor and somehow
bring Hoover and the University closer to

gether."
Similarly, Kennedy discussed Hoover at
length in his report before the trustees last
week and in a speech before alumni Satur
day said the administration hopes to have "a
forward-looking and productive relation
ship" with Hoover in the future.
Kennedy was not available for further
comment but will release a formal statement
of his position on the issue this week, ac
cording to Bob Hamrdla, his assistant.
While University administrators have
taken a pragmatic stance, those at Hoover
have downplayed the controversy. While
this is not surprising, one os tempted to
wonder what those in the tower, with their
clear vistas over both the institution and the
University, make of the issues raised. Di
rector Glenn Campbell has refused to talk to
the press, but Associate Director Richard

Burress did give a recent interview to the
Daily.
"I suppose it's one price you have to pay
for success," he said, in reference to all the
discussion. "If you were a dismal failure no
one would be interested in attacking you."
Interpretations of the debate depend on
who furnishes them. On the most tangible
level, it seems the campus conflict was ig
nited by the institution's 1902 annual report.
The report makes the most of Hoover's
"success," featuring numerous photo
graphs of President Reagan and quoting the
president as saying that Hoover "built the
knowledge base that made the changes tak
ing place in Washington possible."
Apparently, Hoover administrators and
some University faculty members measure
the report by different yardsticks. Burress
said of it and of the institution's ties with

Reagan, "It is an asset to have an ex
president associated with the University . . .
and to have a current president associated
with the University."
But some faculty members and students
disagree. They contend that the institution's
connections with the current administration
are "politically partisan" and potentially
damaging to the University's national repu
tation.
From Burress' perspective, these
Hoover-Reagan ties do not pose any prob
lems and Political Science Prof. John Man
ley's concerns are "way off base." He said,
"As far as I know, every first-rate university
encourages its people to participate in gov
ernment roles. . . . I would think any institu
tion would want to be part of the process."
As the debate has intensified, Hoover


William Kimball
scholars, administrators, faculty
members and students have inevita
bly taken sides. To date, the debate
has relied more on paper than actual
discussion.
At last count, four petitions were
being circulated ar/iund campus.
The first three — now supported by
at least 70 professors and 1500 stu
dents — question Hoover's "political
partisanship'' and its effect on the
University's "national reputation."
The latest petition entered the
arena last week with about 15 signa
tures. It defends the Hoover scholars
right to "academic freedom," and
denounces the proposed enquiry as
a political "witch-hunt."
Its author, Prof. Alphose Juilland,
chairman of the French and Italian
departments, explained his involve
ment in an interview yesterday, "lam
definitely taking this quite seriously
now — I feel threatened," he said.
Juilland, who called himself a
"philosophical conservative," said
this is "the first time in many years"
that he has seen academic freedom
threatened.
As evidence of Juilland's concern,
the faculty member has taken out a
quarter-page advertisement in the

Daily in order to gain support for his
petition. J uilland personally financed
the $227 advertisement.
Is there any single thread that runs
through these documents? Probably
the most significant question raised
concerns the idea of "academic
freedom." Again, the conception
rests entirely on whose petition is de
fining the terms.
According to Juilland, the pro
posed enquiry of Hoover is dis

criminatory and hypocritical. In ref
erence to the initiators of the first
three petitions he said, "They ha
ven't had such a juicy cause in quite
some time, but what bothers me is
that they are going after Hoover
when their motives are precisely
political."
As far as motives are concerned,
JuiHand contended that if Hoover
had been liberal rather than conser
vative, the issue would be nonexis
tant. But Hoover opponents insisted
that their own political biases are ir
relevant.
Manley said the issue is not one of
"motives," political or other. "I am
saying," said Manley, "in the name
of academic freedom — ask ques
tions (about Hoover's alleged politi
cal partisanship). Juilland is saying, in
the name of academic freedom —
don't ask."
Juilland said that examining the re
lationship between Hoover and the
University is legitimate but that
people are "trying to exploit a legiti
mate question to political ends."
In any case, interviews with lead
ers of the faculty petitions showed a
genuine concern for the fundamen
tal questions involved, as well as with
one another's motives. The verbal
debate will take place May 26, when
the issue is scheduled for discussion
in the faculty senate.
