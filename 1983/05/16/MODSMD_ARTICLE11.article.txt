## The
						Stanford Daily On a mission from... 
### 
The Statement of University Mission, re
leased by University President Donald Kennedy
last week, is not something most people had
thought was missing or even necessary until
they saw it.
The University is more than simply a place to
learn or teach or work, but forgetting that is
sometimes easy when we get caught up in our
specific role here. Stanford is a large organiza
tion which grew quickly, maybe even too
quickly.
At a quick, cynical glance, one might judge
the statement of mission to be meaningless
rhetoric. But the statement is important be
cause it caused administrators here to look
where the University stands now and how it
should grow during the next five years.
The specific goals and objectives are reason
able and most deserve praise. The statement
shows great concern for affirmative action and
increasing "interaction among diverse groups
and individuals." Attracting more minority stu
dents, faculty and women is an area where the
University appears to work relentlessly for not
completely satisfactory results; it is reassuring
that officials here do not plan to give up.
Other particularly admirable points in the
statement are the commitment to need-blind
admissions, the plan to review and possibly re
vise residential policies, the call for new Univer
sity personnel policies and the decision to es
tablish an innovation fund to "respond to
changing requirements in research and teach

ing by creating new programs and phasing out
old ones."
THo idea to create more multi-quarter se
quences for undergraduate classes, which
emerged during the faculty senate debate on
the semester/quarter system controversy,
should be explored. But the number of manda
tory "general education" classes should not in
crease.
The University seems to be cautioning itself in
corporate/university relations and the possible
stifling of academic freedom. The statement
says, "Stanford shall maintain a maximum de
gree of financial and political independence"
and the University should "Establish policies
that allow flexible responses to emerging pat
terns of corporate research support, while
maintaining the University's essential commit
ment to academic freedom."
That caution is absolutely necessary; adminis
trators should move slowly and carefully if other
projects akin to the Center for Integrated Sys
tems are being considered. Collaborations be
tween the University and industry should be
watched with a close eye and leaders on either
side of the agreement should be willing to admit
any mistakes.
Administrators here will sort out the issue of
corporate support during the next few years.
Administrators should be able to make major
decisions more competently because the
Statement of University Mission has given them
a bigger picture. And if Stanford is lucky, the
mission will not be impossible.
