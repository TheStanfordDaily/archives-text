## Two GPBs are better than one 
### 
As long as the topic of the pre
judices of the Guest Professorship
Board (GPB) has come up, I'd like to
talk about another one, namely its
prejudice against scientifically
oriented speakers and topics. This
longstanding prejudice consistently
disregards the interests of the 50 per
cent of the undergraduate popula
tion who study in the sciences and
engineering.
Perhaps conscious malice is at
work here, but I doubt it. Since the
Guest Professorship Board is consti
tuted year after year almost exclu
sively of humanities-oriented stu
dents, it probably simply never cros
ses their minds to hire Nobel
laureates in the sciences instead of
failures at the polls. We have here, I
suspect, an illustration of the aliena
tion of what C.P. Snow called the
"Two Cultures" in modern thought.
In this case, the alienation is man
ifested in the monopolization of the
Guest Professorship Board by the
members of one of the two cultures.
This monopoly results in the prejudi
cial actions of the GPB, but its cause
is the very way the GPB is organized
and its members selected. The struc
ture of the GPB guarantees that its
members will be prejudiced, be
cause any campus-wide election for
any ASSU body will result in the elec
tion of humanities majors: students
in the sciences and engineering
neither run for political office nor
vote.
To try to convince the GPB to serve
the other half of the campus which

they so consistently neglect is an un-
American approach to solving this
problem. It is not the American way
to rely upon the virtues of one group
of people for the faithful service of
the interests of another group. The
American approach is to bind people
down in a system which frustrates
everyone's voices. Accordingly, I
propose the following reform of the
Guest Professorship Board.
Begin by classifying all the under
graduate academic departments ac
cording to Snow's cultures: the
humanities-oriented and the scienti
fically oriented. Partition the GPB
into two boards, the humanities
oriented board (HGPB) and the
sciences-oriented board (SGPB).
Then annually rotate membership on
the two boards from department to
department within each culture.
Proceeding alphabetically, the two
departments empowered to select
guest professors the first year would
be Afro and Afro-American Studies
and Applied Earth Sciences. The next
year, students from American
Studies would choose one guest pro
fessor and students from the Biologi
cal Sciences Department would
choose the other. And so on to the
Spanish and Portugese Department
and the Physics Department. Or, if
funds are only sufficient for one
guest professor each year, alternate
cultures annually and rotate within
each culture over the years.
I believe that such a reform would

improve the quality of the guest pro
fessorship program in every respect.
The interests of both cultures would
be presented by their guest profes
sors. The members of each culture
would be represented in the selec
tion process. Each individual disci
pline within these cultures would re
ceive the opportunity to present to
the campus as a whole the lessons
which it has learned from its particu
lar perspective on modern life. Over
the years, students from every de
partment would be involved in the
guest professorship program. Plan
ning, by the boards, by the depart
ments, by the University and by the
guest professors themselves could
be extended over a longer period of
time, since the year when each de
partment selects a guest professor
would be known far in advance. The
various departmental CPB commit
tees could meet to discuss difficul
ties or to coordinate multi-year
themes. The benefits go on and on.
In any event, little could be worse
than the fiascos of the past few years.
Nothing of quality can be expected
from a few necessarily prejudiced
individuals scrambling for a few
months to come up with a topic and
speaker with their idea of campus
wide appeal. Better to serve the
campus as a whole by giving each
part of it the structure within which
to serve, present, and represent it
self.

would be represented in the selec
tion process. Each individual disci
pline within these cultures would re
ceive the opportunity to present to
the campus as a whole the lessons
which it has learned from its particu
lar perspective on modern life. Over
the years, students from every de
partment would be involved in the
guest professorship program. Plan
ning, by the boards, by the depart
ments, by the University and by the
guest professors themselves could
be extended over a longer period of
time, since the year when each de
partment selects a guest professor
would be known far in advance. The
various departmental CPB commit
tees could meet to discuss difficul
ties or to coordinate multi-year
themes. The benefits go on and on.
In any event, little could be worse
than the fiascos of the past few years.
Nothing of quality can be expected
from a few necessarily prejudiced
individuals scrambling for a few
months to come up with a topic and
speaker with their idea of campus
wide appeal. Better to serve the
campus as a whole by giving each
part of it the structure within which
to serve, present, and represent it
self.
