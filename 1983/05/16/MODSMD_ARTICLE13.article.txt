## Don't blame frats for individual actions 
### 
By cautioning three fraternities
about rumored drug sales in their
houses (Daily, May 10), Residential
Education has once again unjustly
singled out fraternities for problems
unrelated to the houses as a whole.
The University should be warning
individuals known to be selling
drugs, not the houses in which they
reside.
Why did the University not simul
taneously issue warnings to dorms
such as Serra or Cedro? Drug dealing
occurs on all parts of the campus,
and it is grossly unfair to collectively
blame the members of the three
fraternities for dealing.
By warning the houses as a whole,
the University is saying fraternities
have full responsibility for all the ac
tions of their individual members,
regardless of whether those actions
have any relations to formal or in
formal house activities. According to
the same ludicrous reasoning, if a
student who resides in a fraternity is
caught cheating on an exam, the
University should issue a warning to
all the members of his fraternity
against Honor Code violations.
I fully support Residential Educa
tion's intentions of curbing drug de
aling on campus. Let's see the Uni
versity stick to that task by dealing
solely with the students involved —
and without blaming its own prob
lems on fraternities.

Major's reasons
"Pawning the golden torch of wis
dom'' by james Azzarello (Daily,

April 29), dealing with the under
graduate study of technical fields, is
an .example of gross overstatement
and absurd assumption. The suppos
ition that students in technical fields
study only to obtain a "five- or six
digit salary" is an unfortunate
stereotype forwarded by Azzarello.
While monetary considerations
are a factor in some instances, it is by
no means the only factor and, in
many cases, has no bearing on a stu
dent's intended major. As Azzarello
must be aware, students have vary
ing interests and, as such, enjoy what
different fields have to offer.
For some, the intellectual journeys
and abstract thinking induced by
quantum mechanics is a joy while
others relish the exploration offered
by the biological sciences.
To claim that engineers et al. find
no motivation, excitement or gratifi
cation in what they do is quite ludicr
ous. For many, the sciences afford an
opportunity "to explore new ideas
(and) . . . fall in love with ideas they
never thought of before."
Finally, to imply that the only way
one can truly be educated is through
the exclusive and lifelong study of
the liberal arts is to imply that one
should cut himself from a large frac
tion of knowledge and exploration,
an act vehemently opposed in the
article.
Before Azzarello criticizes a field
which he apparently dislikes,
perhaps he should explore (with
some "intellectual passion") what it
has to offer.

Sigma Alpha Mu
When we found out that the Daily
wanted an interview with us about
our new fraternity (Daily, May 9) we
saw it as an excellent opportunity to
inform the Stanford community
about our organization. For the most
part, we were quite pleased with the
coverage we received, and we had
hoped that the article would help to
arouse interest in our colony.
Unfortunately, our ambitions were
misrepresented in the story's lead.
While it is true that one of our objec
tives is to make friends, our goal is
not to "earn an ego trip." What we do
expect, though, is to gain a certain
measure of satisfaction pending the
future success of Sigma Alpha Mu at
Stanford. Call it euphemism if you
wish, but we believe there are very
few people who do not desire to see
their endeavors become successful.
We hope that we are embarking
upon a long and prosperous rela
tionship between Sigma Alpha Mu
and Stanford University, and cor
dially invite anyone who would like
to join our "ego trip" to get involved.

Hoover questions
Four questions might help to
clarify the major issue in the current
Hoover Institution controversy:
• What was the extent and nature
of institutional involvement (if any)
in the Reagan presidential campaign?
•Would the University community

have considered comparable institu
tional involvement (if there was any
in the Reagan campaign) in cam
paigns of the past?
•Is the Stanford community pre
pared to accept the extent and nature
of the institutional involvement (if
any) in the Reagan campaign as a
precedent for schools, departments,
institutions and research centers
university-wide in electionsof the fu
ture?
•If the answers to the last two
questions are in the affirmative, then
what are the criteria and definable
limits that should govern such in
volvement?
In my view, these questions re
quire sober, careful, even-handed
and unhurried consideration.

Incorrect petition
To my amazement, I find a book
edited by me, Communism in Cent
ral America and the Caribbean, cited
by the Rebholz petition as evidence
of conservative bias at the Hoover
Institution.
The writers of chapters for this
book include no right-wingers, a
numberof very centrist scholars, and
at least two rather left of center,
Thomas Anderson and William
LeoGrande.
The general conclusion of the vol
ume is that problems in the region
are primarily of indigenous social
economic origin. No review that has
come to my attention has accused it
of any conservative bias.
