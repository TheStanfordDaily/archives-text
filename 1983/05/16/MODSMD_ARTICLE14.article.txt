# Democratize the capitalist system
## 
### 
Two weeks ago, I synopsized Marx's Das Kapital.
Through explicating his economic theories, I tried to
show the validity in Marx's critique of capitalism as a
doomed economic system. In this column, I'd like to
follow up my criticisms of the current order with some
much needed suggestions for change.
As mentioned previously, capitalism suffers from
three basic flaws: the tendency to overproduce, result
ing in the fluctuations of the "business" cycle; the ten
dency toward increasingly capital-intensive industry, re
sulting in declining profit rates; and last, the formation of
semipermanent and conflicting classes based on oppos
ing interests. If we are to create a survivable economic
system, then we must be sure to eliminate such struc
tural contradictions.
The best way to develop a viable alternative is to
examine the present system with an eye for its relative
strengths and weaknesses. We must decide what it does
well, and find a way to keep it in the new order, and
eliminate what it does poorly.
A quick glance shows us that there are two halves to
the U.S. economy. The market side is responsible for the
distribution of goods and services based on the laws of
supply and demand. Although inequalities of income
and wealth favor the rich in obtaining scarce necessities,
this is not really a fault of the market as such. As a whole,
the open market does a fair job in allocating resources
and reflecting consumer preferences.
The second half of the economy concerns the produc
tion of the above goods and services. As it exists, the
present system survives on accumulation of capital
through the extraction of surplus labor. This structure is
unfair because those that are directly responsible for
production, the workers, are excluded from profits as
well as the economic decision-making process. In fact,
as explained in my last column, the workers are the sole
source of profits (from surplus labor value), and a system
that systematically gives them subservient status is not
only unethical but, in the long run, doomed to failure.
In addition to the structural problem created by the
rift between labor and the ownership of the means of
production, there exist negative social consequences
from a purely profit-maximizing economy. Pollution is
one such problem, as private corporations feel no incen
tive to clean up what becomes a public problem. A more
subtle problem is worker alienation. When people have
nothing to sell but their labor and are used simply as
tools of production, there remains little opportunity for
fulfillment and a sense of worth. A third problem, one
considerably in the public eye today, is unemployment.
When labor is viewed solely as a commodity, the human
costs of unemployment are painlessly neglected when
laying off workers appears attractive.
Based on this analysis, we find a need for a system that
incorporates the market method of distribution while
eliminating the flaws inherent in the production side.
On further consideration, a peaceful, practical, and al
most anticlimactic solution becomes apparent. What

needs to be done is to replace the present owners of the
means of production (rich individuals, financial institu
tions, conglomerates) with those who have a personal
stake in the operations of a firm: its workers and resi
dents of the community.
By allocating all of a company's stock to its workers
and those that must bear the environmental impact of its
operations, one eliminates the conflicts of interest be
tween stockholders and "ordinary folk." When those
who feel the immediate brunt of policy decisions are
instrumental in making them, we can rest assured that
social costs such as pollution and unemployment will be
considered with great regard. This type of worker own
ership will also encourage the long needed trend to
produce not for profit, but for use.
If this type of economy doesn't sound like the
stereotypical "Marxist" society, this is because it isn't. I
mentioned in my last column that the Soviet Union is not
a good role model for progressive change. Regardless of
this exhortation, there persists the typical objection that
Marxism necessitates a totalitarian government with
monolithic, centralized planning. This could not be
further from the truth.
In actuality, there is absolutely no reason to believe
that a society such as the one sketched above can't enjoy
full civil liberties. The method of ownership itself
guarantees an efficient, decentralized (far more decen
tralized than what we have today) economy.
Another objection frequently raised insists that
capitalism is in fact a healthy, thriving, and dynamic
system. Keynesian "fine-tuning" (fiscal and monetary
policies), the progressive income tax and a large
middle-class are often pointed to as proof of capitalism's
vitality.
These factors, however, are only superficially perti
nent. It is true that government intervention somewhat
alleviates the misery during recessions. It is also true that
the progressive income tax and a large service-sector
oriented middle class lessen strain between upper and
lower classes.
Nevertheless, surplus labor value derived from a mul
titude of workers and funneled to a considerably smaller
number of individuals must necessarily concentrate
economic and political power. With this concentration
comes decision-making that far more often than not
favors the ruling classes. The "safety valves" of modern
capitalism may weaken and prolong class conflict, but
they certainly cannot alter its inevitability.
Concentration of political power is antithetical to the
ideals of equality. Popular American history teaches us
that this country was founded upon the values of liberty
and equality of opportunity. Under our present system,
these ideas are only words for a great majority of people.
Only with the democratization of our political and eco
nomic structures — with the advent of democratic
socialism — can the American dream ever become a
reality.
