# The
						coast: get away for a Monterey weekend
## 
### 
It's been a rotten winter.
But things can get better, al
tho ugh it might take a
weekend getaway to Mon
terey.
Ihe journey down High
way I is pleasant and enjoy
able as you pass through the
Santa Cruz mountains and
approach the California
coastline. When you get to
Monterey, take the second
exit at Monterey Central to
inquire about lodging, food
and activities at the Tourist
Office located on Camino El
Estero and Webster Street.
You'll immediately be
swamped with shows to see
and breathtaking sights to
enjoy.
You'll also receive hotel,
motel and restaurant
guides. You can opt for the
more modest inns or lodges
that start at around $25 per
night, find reasonably
priced, yet cozy, bed and
breakfast inns or go all out
at ritzier places such as the
Pebble Beach Lodge.

We found the Gosby
House Inn, located in
Pacific Grove near Mon
terey, to be a moderately
priced B&B (rooms start at
$40) specifically suited to a
romantic couple looking for
a quaint, antique-funished
lodging.

The labberwock B&B, in
Monterey, was slightly
more expensive, yet offered
an incredibly comfortable
homey atmosphere and
cozy accomodations for six
couples. The owners of the
old Victorian convent
pamper their patrons with
daily sherry hours, an open
"TumTum Tree" (a stocked

refrigerator) and
homemade cookies and
milk waiting by the firepku e
for exhausted guests when
they arrive back at night.
Prices of the five rooms of
fered at the labberwock
range from $85 to $105 (for
the king room with private
fireplace and bath).
Though $150 for one
room at the Pebble Beach
Lodge seems a little out
rageous, don't panic. Dur
ing the off-season, the
lodge offers a 50 percent
discount to guests request
ing a room several months
in advance.
Whether or not you de
cide to spend your salary at
the lodge, the magnificent
17-Mile Drive through Peb
ble Beach is a must. The
entry gate charge is $4, un
less you are a guest of the
lodge. It is well worth the
price to drive along the c liffs
and coast of Monterey Bay.
The lodge proved to be a
luxurious complex of rooms
and shops. The service was
impeccable and the rooms
were elegant, neat and
equipped with everything
from a television and re
frigerator to monogrammed
Pebble Beach bathrobes for
each visitor. Try to get a
room right on the water and
watch the old golf pros (who
pay $50 a shot for a chance
to play the course) shuttle
by on their carts. For one
extravagant evening, the
lodge is a must.
Dining — in addition to
lodging — choices are ex
tensive on the Monterey
peninsula. We found
Casanova's in Carmel to
satisfy our craving for Italian
food: fettucini made with
four cheese and filet of sole
(both $14.95) and lots of
chianti classico (quite ex
pensive at $12 a bottle)
served in a beautiful out
door setting. Italian gnocchi
and sauteed mushrooms
are two specialities not to be
passed up.
The Clock Garden in

Monterey, offering mostly
seafood fare at reasonable
prices, provided another
welcome treat for our pa
lates. We enjoyed grilled
salmon ($12.95) and red
snapper ($9.95) and Cas
troville artichokes in a
casual, antique-clocked set
ting. ■
Fresh Cream Restaurant
on Cannery Row, an inti
mate F tench restaurant with
an extensive wine list and
fantastic food, is also worth
a try.
Nightlife after our long
dinners was surprisingly ex
citing. Many of the Carmel
bars stay open until 2 a.m.
He sure to try Jack Londons
for splendid coffee drinks,
the General Store (or Forge
in the Forest) for daiquiris
and pina coladas, and of
course the Hogs Breath,

Clint Eastwood's famous
hangout. All of these bars
are located downtown off
Ocean Street.
In Monterey, we found
stomping, two-stepping
country tunes at Doc Ric
kett's lab on Cannery Row.
There's always a Western
band rockin' away, and the
drinks are reasonably
priced. The First National
Fog Bank is another favorite
of the young adult crowd.
Check out the Outrigger
and Latitude 36 (in Carmel
Valley) also . . . ask locals
where to go.
Daytime activities are
never-ending. One must is a
stroll along the historic
Cannery Row, the famous
row where john Steinbeck
walked and wrote about.
Cannery Row is indeed
touristy, but the strip
crowded with seafood res

taurants, wineries and tast
ing rooms, dancing halls,
shops and art galleries has a
certain charm. There's also
the old-fashioned Edgewa
ter Packing Company Build
ing that covers an antique
merry-go-round, Game Ar
cade and a great ice cream
parlor.
Fisherman's Wharf is a
mini replica of San Francis
co's attraction. The only ex
citing activity to do there is
to feed the obnoxiously
loud sea lions barking for
tourists' food. It's worth a
short glance anyway.
A shopping center a little
more worthwhile is the
elegant Barnyard Center in
Carmel Valley. The 40 out
door cafes and boutiques
really tempt your eyes and
your pocketbook.
If you're tired of shop
ping, you'll find the peace

ful, scenic Point Lobos State
Reserve a deserved resting
point only five miles south
of Carmel Valley along
Highway 1. Picnic on top of
the cliffs above the waves
and then walk along the
marked trails among the
gorgeously lush forest for a
pleasant and cheap (only $2
to enter) afternoon.
For a more cultural after
noon, make sure you see
the Carmel Mission,
founded by Father lunipero
Serra in 1771. Admission is
free. And of course there
are the white sandy
beaches, one of the best
being Carmel Beach at the
bottom of Ocean Avenue.
Go for it — after this winter,
Monterey is a deserved re
treat.
