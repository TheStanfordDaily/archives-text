Albuquerque, N.M. — Call it the "Stanford will."
That's how sophomore Linda Gates described Stanford's
come-from-behind 5-4 victory over the San Diego State
Aztecs yesterday in the quarter finals of the NCAA Tennis
Championships here.
Coupled with the Cardinal's 9-0 decision over Princeton
Saturday, yesterday's win advances fourth-seeded Stanford
to today's semi-finals against No. 1 ranked and undefeated
USC at noon.
"The 'Stanford will' is the will to win," Gates explained.
"It's the idea that we are going to win no matter what."
_ And the Cardinal certainty tested its will yesterday. To say
Gates and Company had their backs against the wall would
be grossly understating the issue.
Stanford, paced by Elise Burgin's clutch three-set win
over San Diego State's Micki Schillig, split the singles with
the fifth-seeded Aztecs. In the doubles, the Cardinal team
of Caryn Copeland and Michelle Weiss won at No. 2, but
Alison Hardey and Alyce Werdell were defeated in three
sets at No. 3.
"And then things started to look bleak," said Stanford
coach Frank Brennan.
With the score knotted at 4-4, the match rested on the No.
1 doubles contest between Stanford's Burgin and Gates and
San Deigo State's Schillig and Cindy MacGregor.
The Aztec pair had won the first set and was leading 3-0 in
the second period.
But Burgin and Gates refused to say "die" and proceeded

to reel off five straight games and assume a 5-3 lead. Burgin
held serve twice and Gates once in the string, while the
Card duo broke Schillig and MacGregor once each.
After MacGregor held to cut it to 5-4, Gates' powerful
serve was too much for the Aztec team as Burgin/Gates cap
tured the game and the second set 6-4.
The Cardinal pair returned from a 10-minute break be
tween sets and picked up in the third set where it had left off
in the second. Burgin/Gates kept to a 3-1 lead on the
strength of two service breaks.
But MacGregor/Schillig tied it at 3-3, forcing Stanford to
break Schillig and move ahead for good at 4-3.
"There could have been a letdown after the break in the
third (to make it 3-3)," Burgin said. "We didn't let their
breaking us affect us. We just kept going."
With Gates serving for both the individual and team
match at 5-4, Burgin threaded the needle twice with win
ners up the middle to give the Card a 3-2 advantage.
The Aztec team fought off the first match-match point,
but Burgin killed a volley at 3-3 to give Stanford the victory.
"You become possessed," Burgin said. "The momentum
just went our way."
The No. 1 doubles win capped a day for Stanford that saw
it lose three matches after winning the first set.
In fact, Cardinal netters won eight of nine first sets, only
to lose five of nine second sets and three of five third sets.
But in the end it was experience that paid off.
Burgin and Weiss and senior team captain Copeland all
won their singles and doubles matches.
"Our veterans really played well today," Brennan said.
"They've been here (to the NCAAs) before and they've
been in a lot of big matches."
Although the match began under sunny skies at 2:30
p.m., it finished under the center court lights at 9 p.m. Three
singles and two doubles matches went the full three sets.
Stanford jumped to an early 2-0 team lead afterCopeland
disposed of Sylvia Schenck 6-4, 6-2 and Weiss downed Jen
nifer Chapin 6-1, 7-5.
But the Aztecs won three consecutive matches, Nos. 2, 3
and 6 singles — to take a 3-2 lead with only Burgin's match
with Schillig at center court still in progress.
At No. 2 singles, Gates bolted to a first-set 4-1 advantage
before MacGregor settled down and tied it at four apiece.
Gates held on to win the set 6-4, then watched the match
slip away as MacGregor, with an excellent serve and volley
game, prevailed easily in the second 6-2 and third, 6-4.
"When I lost my singles, I wanted to get revenge in the
doubles and get a point for our team," Gates said.
While Gates was able to come back and win at doubles,
Werdell — who also lost a three-set singles contest could
not.
"Elise Werdell was having one of those days," Brennan
said. "She just couldn't close it (the match) out," he said.
"She was losing a lot of key points."
Although USC is undefeated and is the tournament's No.
1 seed, Brennan thinks his Cardinal has more than a small
chance.
"I think they (USC) are definitely beatable. We match up
well with them."
Stanford has lost to the Trojans twice this season, both by
5-4 scores. In the teams' first meeting, USC took five of six
singles matches then played with abridged doubles teams.
However, in the match two months ago in Los Angeles, the
Trojans were forced to win in the doubles.
"We're riding high right now and we'll go out there with
nothing to lose," Brennan said.

singles matches then played with abridged doubles teams.
However, in the match two months ago in Los Angeles, the
Trojans were forced to win in the doubles.
"We're riding high right now and we'll go out there with
nothing to lose," Brennan said.

Albuquerque, N.M. — Call it the "Stanford will."
That's how sophomore Linda Gates described Stanford's
come-from-behind 5-4 victory over the San Diego State
Aztecs yesterday in the quarter finals of the NCAA Tennis
Championships here.
Coupled with the Cardinal's 9-0 decision over Princeton
Saturday, yesterday's win advances fourth-seeded Stanford
to today's semi-finals against No. 1 ranked and undefeated
USC at noon.
"The 'Stanford will' is the will to win," Gates explained.
"It's the idea that we are going to win no matter what."
_ And the Cardinal certainty tested its will yesterday. To say
Gates and Company had their backs against the wall would
be grossly understating the issue.
Stanford, paced by Elise Burgin's clutch three-set win
over San Diego State's Micki Schillig, split the singles with
the fifth-seeded Aztecs. In the doubles, the Cardinal team
of Caryn Copeland and Michelle Weiss won at No. 2, but
Alison Hardey and Alyce Werdell were defeated in three
sets at No. 3.
"And then things started to look bleak," said Stanford
coach Frank Brennan.
With the score knotted at 4-4, the match rested on the No.
1 doubles contest between Stanford's Burgin and Gates and
San Deigo State's Schillig and Cindy MacGregor.
The Aztec pair had won the first set and was leading 3-0 in
the second period.
But Burgin and Gates refused to say "die" and proceeded

to reel off five straight games and assume a 5-3 lead. Burgin
held serve twice and Gates once in the string, while the
Card duo broke Schillig and MacGregor once each.
After MacGregor held to cut it to 5-4, Gates' powerful
serve was too much for the Aztec team as Burgin/Gates cap
tured the game and the second set 6-4.
The Cardinal pair returned from a 10-minute break be
tween sets and picked up in the third set where it had left off
in the second. Burgin/Gates kept to a 3-1 lead on the
strength of two service breaks.
But MacGregor/Schillig tied it at 3-3, forcing Stanford to
break Schillig and move ahead for good at 4-3.
"There could have been a letdown after the break in the
third (to make it 3-3)," Burgin said. "We didn't let their
breaking us affect us. We just kept going."
With Gates serving for both the individual and team
match at 5-4, Burgin threaded the needle twice with win
ners up the middle to give the Card a 3-2 advantage.
The Aztec team fought off the first match-match point,
but Burgin killed a volley at 3-3 to give Stanford the victory.
"You become possessed," Burgin said. "The momentum
just went our way."
The No. 1 doubles win capped a day for Stanford that saw
it lose three matches after winning the first set.
In fact, Cardinal netters won eight of nine first sets, only
to lose five of nine second sets and three of five third sets.
But in the end it was experience that paid off.
Burgin and Weiss and senior team captain Copeland all
won their singles and doubles matches.
"Our veterans really played well today," Brennan said.
"They've been here (to the NCAAs) before and they've
been in a lot of big matches."
Although the match began under sunny skies at 2:30
p.m., it finished under the center court lights at 9 p.m. Three
singles and two doubles matches went the full three sets.
Stanford jumped to an early 2-0 team lead afterCopeland
disposed of Sylvia Schenck 6-4, 6-2 and Weiss downed Jen
nifer Chapin 6-1, 7-5.
But the Aztecs won three consecutive matches, Nos. 2, 3
and 6 singles — to take a 3-2 lead with only Burgin's match
with Schillig at center court still in progress.
At No. 2 singles, Gates bolted to a first-set 4-1 advantage
before MacGregor settled down and tied it at four apiece.
Gates held on to win the set 6-4, then watched the match
slip away as MacGregor, with an excellent serve and volley
game, prevailed easily in the second 6-2 and third, 6-4.
"When I lost my singles, I wanted to get revenge in the
doubles and get a point for our team," Gates said.
While Gates was able to come back and win at doubles,
Werdell — who also lost a three-set singles contest could
not.
"Elise Werdell was having one of those days," Brennan
said. "She just couldn't close it (the match) out," he said.
"She was losing a lot of key points."
Although USC is undefeated and is the tournament's No.
1 seed, Brennan thinks his Cardinal has more than a small
chance.
"I think they (USC) are definitely beatable. We match up
well with them."
