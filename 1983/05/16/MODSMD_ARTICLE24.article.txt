# Cardinal sluggers sweep Cal to claim 6-Pac crown
## 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
The Stanford C ardinal sailed
into post-season form this
weekend, burying California in
a three game baseball series
and clinching their first con
ference title since 1%7.
The season-ending sweep
also enhanced Stanford's bid
to host the Western Regional.
The NCAA decided last night
which teams will qualify for re
gional action and, atter dis
cerning where most of the
powerful baseball schools are,
where the regionals will be
played. Their announcement is
expected this afternoon.
Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess said Friday that "we
submitted a very good bid and
would be eager to host (the re
gional)."
Historically, the western
schools have been deemed
numerous enough to have two
western regionals. If two west
ern regions are granted, Sun
ken Diamond has a good
chance of being one of the
sites. If the West is packed into
one regional, Sunken
Diamond will probably be
eliminated from consideration
because it does not have lights.
Stanford's 9-2 win Friday
clinched the 6-Pac title and
doused the Bears' hopes of
again acting as spoiler for Car
dinal extra-season action. But
the Cardinal did not drop gears
for Saturday's 9-1 win at Cal

and yesterday's b-3 win back
home.
It was a real good perform
ance today," Marquess said
yesterday."It was tough to play
because we had already won
the title."
The Cardinal finished 37-15-1
overall and 20-10 conference.
Second-place Arizona State
finished at 17-13.
Friday's performance best
exemplified what the Cardinal
will need to earn a repeat per
formance at the College World
Series.
"We've played great defense
the last two to three weeks,"
Marquess said ot his young
team. "We had hoped (Eric)
Hardgrave, (Mike) Aldrete and
those guys (veterans) would
play like they are playing, but
you get an added bonus out of
a (Vince) Sakowski who is just
playing his heart out."
Hardgrave, Aldrete and
Sakowski, who along with fel
low senior Mike Dotterer,
played their final home game
yesterday, have fueled the
Cardinal offense all year.
Hardgrave leads the nation
in home runs (22) and RBI (75)
and was torrid in his final six
games. California feared him
enough yesterday to inten
tionally walk him in the third
inning even though he repre
sented the go-ahead run.
'Hardgrave isjustonatear,"
Marquess said. "I've never
seen anyone hit the ball like he

is. (The intentional walk) was
the ultimate show of respect.
Normally you wouldn't do that
unless you're scared to death
of the guy."
Sakowski, who came into his
senior year with a career bat
ting average of .173, is an
chored near the .350 mark and
leads the team in doubles.
Aldrete, with the second
best career average ever at
Stanford, leads the team in hit
ting and lends experience to
what was earlier thought to be
a fragile infield.
Instead, the Aldrete,
Sakowski, Pete Stanicek and
John Verducci infield has been
spectacular.
"Our defense has been
pretty solid all year and that's
been picking us up," Stanicek
said. "It's kept us in a lot of
games when our hitting has
been off."
Although Stanicek, Verducci
and Sakowski are all new to
starting positions this year,
they practiced together as the
second unit last year.

Brian Myers pitched his sec
ond complete game Friday, giv
ing up two runs on eight hits
and raising his record to 9-4. In
his last few outings, Myers has
been busting out of phone
booths in the late innings and
transforming himself into his
own relief pit*, her.
"The last couple of games
I've been getting stronger at
the end," Myers said. "I wasn't
in a groove (Friday) but I finally
found it in the late innings. I
think all pitchers feel lucky
when they get stronger late in
the game."
Both teams traded lead-off
homers — Stanicek for Stan
ford and Lance Blankenship for
Cal — and the Cardinal added
one more run in the first when
Hardgrave s ground ball
scored Mark Davis from third.
Stanford added single runs
in the second and third.
Stanicek drove in the game
winning run in the second.
After Verducci singled to left,
he moved to second when
John Cox hit Lvle Smith with a

pitch, stole third and scored on
Stanicek's single.
Davis blasted a two-run
homer in the fourth and
Hardgrave hit a three-run shot
in the eighth.
Stanford hit Cal — perhaps
the runningest team in the con
ference — with some speed of
its own, stealing seven bases.
I he Cardinal waited a while
Saturday, before breaking
open a I-1 deadlock with an
eight-run explosion in the
eleventh.
Dotterer broke the tie with a
pinch-hit, bases-loaded single
and Stanicek followed with a
grand slam. Two batters later,
Hardgrave hit a two-run home
run to straight-away cen
terfield — the fifth straight
game he had homered.
John Radtke kept his starting
appointment on the mound
despite twisting an ankle at
practice eariler in the week and
gave up just four hits in 8 2/3
innings. Jeff Ballard mopped
up the final 2 1/3 innings for his
seventh win of the season.

The Cardinal's final regular
season appearance coupled
with bright sunshine brought
out 1936 fans — the season's
largest crowd — to Sunken
Diamond yesterday.
Davis led Stanford with a
game-tying solo home run in
the fifth and then doubled in
Lyle Smith for the go-ahead run
in the sixth.
Stanford capped their scor
ing with three runs in the
seventh. Dotterer singled in
Hardgrave, who had walked
and moved to second on a wild
pitch, and Greg Lorenzetti fol
lowed with a towering two-run
homer to left.
Steve Cottrell gave up three

runs in 7 M\ innings to pick up
the win and boost his record to
8-2.
The sun-baked Stanford fans
cheered the Cardinal for sev
eral minutes after Ballard
struck out Mike Zahn to end
the game and the regular sea
son.
"Our crowds are great,"
Marquess said. "They don't
ride the other team and they
acknowledge good plays,
whether its by us or the other
team. I'd like to host the re
gional. It would be good not
only for Stanford, but for the
community. They could come
out and see some real good
baseball."

Marquess said ot his young
team. "We had hoped (Eric)
Hardgrave, (Mike) Aldrete and
those guys (veterans) would
play like they are playing, but
you get an added bonus out of
a (Vince) Sakowski who is just
playing his heart out."
Hardgrave, Aldrete and
Sakowski, who along with fel
low senior Mike Dotterer,
played their final home game
yesterday, have fueled the
Cardinal offense all year.
Hardgrave leads the nation
in home runs (22) and RBI (75)
and was torrid in his final six
games. California feared him
enough yesterday to inten
tionally walk him in the third
inning even though he repre
sented the go-ahead run.
'Hardgrave isjustonatear,"
Marquess said. "I've never
seen anyone hit the ball like he

is. (The intentional walk) was
the ultimate show of respect.
Normally you wouldn't do that
unless you're scared to death
of the guy."
Sakowski, who came into his
senior year with a career bat
ting average of .173, is an
chored near the .350 mark and
leads the team in doubles.
Aldrete, with the second
best career average ever at
Stanford, leads the team in hit
ting and lends experience to
what was earlier thought to be
a fragile infield.
Instead, the Aldrete,
Sakowski, Pete Stanicek and
John Verducci infield has been
spectacular.
"Our defense has been
pretty solid all year and that's
been picking us up," Stanicek
said. "It's kept us in a lot of
games when our hitting has
been off."
Although Stanicek, Verducci
and Sakowski are all new to
starting positions this year,
they practiced together as the
second unit last year.

Brian Myers pitched his sec
ond complete game Friday, giv
ing up two runs on eight hits
and raising his record to 9-4. In
his last few outings, Myers has
been busting out of phone
booths in the late innings and
transforming himself into his
own relief pit*, her.
"The last couple of games
I've been getting stronger at
the end," Myers said. "I wasn't
in a groove (Friday) but I finally
found it in the late innings. I
think all pitchers feel lucky
when they get stronger late in
the game."
Both teams traded lead-off
homers — Stanicek for Stan
ford and Lance Blankenship for
Cal — and the Cardinal added
one more run in the first when
Hardgrave s ground ball
scored Mark Davis from third.
Stanford added single runs
in the second and third.
Stanicek drove in the game
winning run in the second.
After Verducci singled to left,
he moved to second when
John Cox hit Lvle Smith with a

pitch, stole third and scored on
Stanicek's single.
Davis blasted a two-run
homer in the fourth and
Hardgrave hit a three-run shot
in the eighth.
Stanford hit Cal — perhaps
the runningest team in the con
ference — with some speed of
its own, stealing seven bases.
I he Cardinal waited a while
Saturday, before breaking
open a I-1 deadlock with an
eight-run explosion in the
eleventh.
Dotterer broke the tie with a
pinch-hit, bases-loaded single
and Stanicek followed with a
grand slam. Two batters later,
Hardgrave hit a two-run home
run to straight-away cen
terfield — the fifth straight
game he had homered.
John Radtke kept his starting
appointment on the mound
despite twisting an ankle at
practice eariler in the week and
gave up just four hits in 8 2/3
innings. Jeff Ballard mopped
up the final 2 1/3 innings for his
seventh win of the season.

The Cardinal's final regular
season appearance coupled
with bright sunshine brought
out 1936 fans — the season's
largest crowd — to Sunken
Diamond yesterday.
Davis led Stanford with a
game-tying solo home run in
the fifth and then doubled in
Lyle Smith for the go-ahead run
in the sixth.
Stanford capped their scor
ing with three runs in the
seventh. Dotterer singled in
Hardgrave, who had walked
and moved to second on a wild
pitch, and Greg Lorenzetti fol
lowed with a towering two-run
homer to left.
Steve Cottrell gave up three

runs in 7 M\ innings to pick up
the win and boost his record to
8-2.
The sun-baked Stanford fans
cheered the Cardinal for sev
eral minutes after Ballard
struck out Mike Zahn to end
the game and the regular sea
son.
"Our crowds are great,"
Marquess said. "They don't
ride the other team and they
acknowledge good plays,
whether its by us or the other
team. I'd like to host the re
gional. It would be good not
only for Stanford, but for the
community. They could come
out and see some real good
baseball."

at home by catcher Lyle Smith. Jeff Ballard (right) entered the game in the seventh inning to relieve starting pitcher Steve Cottrell and wind up the Card's regular season.
The Stanford C ardinal sailed
into post-season form this
weekend, burying California in
a three game baseball series
and clinching their first con
ference title since 1%7.
The season-ending sweep
also enhanced Stanford's bid
to host the Western Regional.
The NCAA decided last night
which teams will qualify for re
gional action and, atter dis
cerning where most of the
powerful baseball schools are,
where the regionals will be
played. Their announcement is
expected this afternoon.
Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess said Friday that "we
submitted a very good bid and
would be eager to host (the re
gional)."
Historically, the western
schools have been deemed
numerous enough to have two
western regionals. If two west
ern regions are granted, Sun
ken Diamond has a good
chance of being one of the
sites. If the West is packed into
one regional, Sunken
Diamond will probably be
eliminated from consideration
because it does not have lights.
Stanford's 9-2 win Friday
clinched the 6-Pac title and
doused the Bears' hopes of
again acting as spoiler for Car
dinal extra-season action. But
the Cardinal did not drop gears
for Saturday's 9-1 win at Cal

and yesterday's b-3 win back
home.
It was a real good perform
ance today," Marquess said
yesterday."It was tough to play
because we had already won
the title."
The Cardinal finished 37-15-1
overall and 20-10 conference.
Second-place Arizona State
finished at 17-13.
Friday's performance best
exemplified what the Cardinal
will need to earn a repeat per
formance at the College World
Series.
