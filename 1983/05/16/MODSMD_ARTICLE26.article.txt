# Locals in Bay to Breakers
## 
### 
Thousands of Stanford students and alums
flocked to San Francisco yesterday morning to
run in Bay to Breakers, the single largest partici
pation sporting event in the nation.
More than 54,000 people officially — and an
estimated 80,000 total — entered the 72nd run
ning of the 7.4-mile race.
New Zealand's Rod Dixon, 32, won the Bay to
Breakers Race for the second straight year, in 35
minutes and one second.
Stanford graduate Duncan Mac Donald
finished fourth in the men's.
Nancy Ditz, Class of '76 and special assistant to
the director of the Alumni Association, finished
second among the women.
Three-time Breakers champ Laurie Binder, 35,
of Oakland made it her fourth victory in an unof
ficial 41 minutes, 24 seconds.
A 13-person group composed of last year's
Branner residents won the co-ed centipede divi
sion.
The course begins at the Ferry Building near
the Embarcadero Center and ropes around San
Francisco, mostly downhill, running through
Golden Gate Park and finishing at the beach.
The Band greeted racers at the finish line.
Participants paid $7.50 to enter the run. Pro
ceeds benefit San Francisco charities.
The race was marred by the death of an un
identified male contestant who collapsed in
Golden Gate Park slightly more than a mile from
the ocean front finish line.

As the race leaders were finishing the race
between 35 and 36 minutes after the Ba.m. start,
some of the slower joggers were still crossing
the starting line downtown.
One of the "objects" of the annual race,
sponsored by the San Francisco Examiner, is to
run along as weirdly as possible. This year some
of the top honors had to go to a perambulating,
132-foot-long version of the San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge, disguising 26 frat guys from
UC-Berkeley.
A genetic engineering outfit from Berkeley
fielded a team of runners dressed like a monster
version of a DNA molecule.
One fellow pushed a wheeled chair labeled
"love," in the chair was a pretty girl looking
embarrassed over the whole thing. The famous
"human juke box" from Fisherman's Wharf was
put on wheels and pushed along by another
bunch. The contraption hit a road reflector and
tumbled, threatening to shove a trumpet down
somebody's throat.
The race drew almost $1 million in donated
goods. Hotels in the downtown area were re
porting a big business putting up out-of-town
runners who had arrived early.
Planning for the event started months ago.
Observers at various points in the race said
police and others whose duty was to keep order
could have been totally overwhelmed at any
time, if the crowd had chosen to do so.
