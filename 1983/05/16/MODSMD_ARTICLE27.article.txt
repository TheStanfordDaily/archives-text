rally by the San Antonio Spurs for a
129-121 victory yesterday and a 3-1 lead
in the National Basketball Association
Western Conference final playoff
series.
Game 5 of the best-of-seven series
will be Wednesday night at Los Angeles.
The defending champion Lakers are
trying to become the first team to win
two straight NBA championships since
the Boston Celtics did it in 1968-69.
The Spurs whittled a 12-point half
time deficit to two at the end of the
third quarter with the help of 10 points
by Mike Mitchell, the game's high
scorer with 35, and 11 points from Artis
Gilmore.

score 98-98 with a jump shot opening
the finaf period. Los Angeles' Michael
Cooper and the Spurs' Gene Banks
were ejected from the game for fighting
with 11:01.

Angeles opened a four-point lead with
8:55 remaining on a layup by Kurt Ram
bis and two free throws by Kareem Ab

A's shutout Seattle
Oakland — Tom Underwood re
turned to the Oakland starting rotation
by pitching three-hit ball over 6 2-3 in
nings, and reliever Steve McCatty com
pleted the game as the A's shut out the
Seattle Mariners 3-0 yesterday.
McCatty allowed only one hit in rec
ording his third save and now has given
up just one hit in his last nine innings of
work. Left-hander Underwood, 2-1, left
the game in the seventh because of

tightness in his back.
Dwayne Murphy singled home Mike
Davis from second base in the first in
ning after Seattle made the first of sev
eral fielding mistakes behind pitcher
Jim Beattie, 2-2. Davis had reached sec
ond on a bloop double to center field.
Beattie had him picked off, but short
stop Todd Cruz could not hold the
throw. No error was charged.
The Seattle defense committed four
errors later, however, two of them com
ing in the fourth when the A's scored an
unearned run.
In the eighth, Murphy singled, stole
second and scored on Kelvin Moore's
single.
Giants beat Reds
Cincinnati — Jack Clark singled to
snap a 1-1 tie in the eighth inning and
ignite a four-run rally that lifted the San
Francisco Giants to a rain-delayed 5-2
decision yesterday over the Cincinnati
Reds.
Atlee Hammaker, 4-1, pitched seven
innings, and Gary Lavelle earned his
fourth save.
Johnnie LeMaster singled to start the
Giants' eighth inning against reliever
Tom Hume, 0-3. Darrell Evans, who had
his hitting streak stopped at 13 games,
walked but was erased at second on
Chili Davis' grounder. LeMaster took
third.
Clark then singled, scoring LeMaster.
The ball got past left fielder Gary Redus
for an error, but Davis was thrown out at
the plate while trying to score as Clark
took third. Dave Bergman doubled to
score Clark, and, after Max Venable was
intentionally walked, Bob Brenly hit a
two-run double for a 5-1 advantage.
Johnny Bench hit his fourth homer of
the season in the second inning off
Hammaker. The Reds scored again in
the eighth.
The Giants' first run came on starter
Ted Power's wild pitch in the sixth.
Conners wins Classic
Tulsa, Okla —Top-seeded Jimmy
Conners defeated Roscoe Tanner, 6-4,
6-3, yesterday to capture his second

$100,000 Bank of Oklahoma Tennis
Classic title.
Tanner's renowned serve earned him
seven aces to Conner's one. But Con
ners' returns, especially his cross-court
backhand, allowed him to break Tan
ner's serve four times.
"It was windy and cold, but I think I
played pretty well considering the con
ditions," Conners said after the match,
which lasted just over one hour.
Conners, currently ranked third in
the world, took home $32,000 for the
victory. Tanner, ranked 125 th after an
infrequent 1982 playing schedule,
earned $20,000.
Tanner had defeated Steve Denton,
Sandy Mayer and Chip Hooper earlier
in the eight-man, round-robin tour
nament at the Shadow Mountain Rac
quet Club to advance to the finals.
Conners won the BOK classic by de
aling Eddie Gibbs in his only other ap
pearance in 1979. Tanner was runner
up to Dick Stockton in 1981 and also
competed in the 1982 event.
