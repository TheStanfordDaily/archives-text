# Alumni phone-a-thon nets $80,000
## 
### JERRY BALL 
Student and alumni volunteers
raised more than $80,000 for the Uni
versity general fund, surpassing their
goal by $30,000, during the first
nationwide phone-a-thon this
weekend.
About 320 volunteers manned 40
phones, working in shifts of two
and-a-half hours. Each volunteer also
went through a half-hour training
session to learn the finer points of
tundraising.
The lames Irvine Foundation made
the volunteers' efforts doubly fruitful
by contributing matching funds. The
Irvine Foundation will match 50 per
cent of donations in excess of last
year's total. They also promised to
match 100 percent of increased do
nations from alumni who graduated
after 1968, up to $2 million.
Wendy Gibson, director of student
development, called the event
"enormously successful." She said,
"They set a goal of $50,000, but we
passed that mark by 5:30 Saturday."
Student chairman John Blum said
the program's success "went beyond
our wildest dreams."
Blum said he first thought of initiat
ing a phone-a-thon at Stanford last
year when he was serving on a task
force which dealt with rising tuition
costs. Blum decided to emulate a
similar program at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
MIT has the most successful cam
pus phone-a-thon in the nation, but
"it isn't nearly as much fun as ours,"
said Mark Phillips, chairman of the
Stanford University Now Program.
Indeed, the callers did seem to be
having a good time. Whenever a vol
unteer received a donation from an
alumnus, he or she would ring a cow
bell and yank on a balloon. A clerk
would then dash to the desk and an
nounce the size of the donation as
everyone cheered.

the Stanford General Fund by 320 student and alumni volunteers.
