The recipients are:
• Deborah Chen, undergraduate, Mechanical Engineer
ing, "For effectively applying her technical skills to social
needs for solar energy, improved computer instruction
in local schools, and mechanical devices to aid the
locomotion of disabled children; and for her many cam
pus contributions, among them to ARLO, the Heritage
Fund, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers,
WISE, and the Karate Association.
• Doug Perkins, undergraduate, Biological Sciences,

"For the mental and physical toughness that combine to
make him a nationally recognized athlete; for his many
achievements as captain of the wrestling team; and for
time and affection freely given — to his teammates, to
little kids on the nursery school playground, to young
sters at Sierra Camp, and to Stanford students new to the
scene of college athletics."
• Ruth Williams, graduate, Mathematics, "For the clarity
and value of her perceptions into Brownian Motion as
well as into the needs of her students in the Calculus 20
series; for many hard work as a Teaching
Fellow in the Mathematics Department; and especially
for organizing the highly successful 1982-83 lecture
series for WISE, Women in Science and Engineering."
