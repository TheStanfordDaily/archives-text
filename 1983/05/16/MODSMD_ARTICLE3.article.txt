# Kennedy stresses research funding at alumni conference

In his State of the University
speech Saturday, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy emphasized
the need for sustained growth here
to assure researchers the advanced
facilities they need.
"We have an extraordinary faculty
at the Medical Center and they ur
gently r ?ed new facilities," he told
more than 1200 alumni at Bowman
Oak Grove during one of the largest
Stanford Alumni Conferences ever.
"We have ambitious plans to mod
ernize the hospital and construct the
new Center for Molecular Genetics.
It is critical to be far-sighted if we are
to lead phase two of the wave of
breakthroughs in biochemical re
search in the same way that we have
led phase one."
The 51st Annual Alumni Confer
ence featured a series of lectures on
Breakthroughs at Stanford. During
the day-long conference, partici
pants listened to three from among a
choice of 15 lectures on break
throughs in research here.
The lectures were given by Stan
ford professors selected in consulta
tion with deans and faculty from each

of the seven schools and were sing
led out for exceptional contributions
in their fields. The lectures focused
on advances in many disciplines
from "Zen and American Business"
to "Breakthroughs in Particle
Physics."
"The breakthrough conference
lectures brought the alumni into the


Donald Kennedy
back pocket of researchers and gave
them unusual access to the cutting
edge of Stanford research," said
Delia Van Heyst, deputy director of
the Stanford Alumni Association.
"Stanford does not have a com
prehensive continuing education
program, and our alumni programs
help fill the gap," she said.
While the alumni dined under the
spreading branches of Bowman Oak
Grove, Kennedy delivered his annual
address. He also described this past
year's budget as "one of the most
difficult ever to balance," citing an
inflationary environment as a cause
of budget-balancing strain. Kennedy
added on a positive note that "Stan
ford's endowment increases lead
those of its cohorts."

He reaffirmed his stand against
prohibiting "research specifically
devoted to nuclear weapons design
at the Stanford Synchrotron Radia
tion Laboratory," citing the unclas
sified status of the work and saying
he had "decided that restrictions
would do more harm than good."
"Once we start making restrictions
based on morality here, how will we
know where to stop?" he added.
Responding to the recent petitions
calling for an investigation of the
Hoover Institution, Kennedy main
tained that such an investigation
would violate the University's cur
rent conceptions of academic free
dom and would therefore be inap
propriate.
Kennedy defended the controver
sial Stanford West housing devel
opment plans to provide additional
housing for students and faculty.
"We must pay attention to the bad

job-to-housing balance in the area
surrounding Stanford. To navigate
through the community's maze of
regulations governing new housing
construction was a difficult job. We
recognize that the community has
important concerns, and we are pre
pared to meet these."
Music to accompany the alumni
luncheon was provided by the Band.
The conference was well attended
by some of the University's earlier
graduates including featured
speaker, Birge Clark of the class of
1914. Clark, who inducted the class
of 1933 into the alumni half-century
club, joked, "I am proud to belongto
the class of 1914, but only I wish they
would make our table placards a bit
smaller. I can almost see the mental
gears cranking as people try to calcu
late how old I must be. You know . . .
83 minus 14 plus 20."
