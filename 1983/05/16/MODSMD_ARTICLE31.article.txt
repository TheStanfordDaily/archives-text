# 'Daily' wins big

### 
The Daily softball team dealt a whopping defeat to the Professional
journalism Fellows at Wilbur Field yesterday.
The PJFs, who mistakenly called themselves "The Winners," lost 19-11
despite aid from numerous small children and ringers and scoring by P)F
Captain FHarry Press' wife.
Daily members appeared poorly organized at the 11 a.m. game time —
indeed, only four valiant staffers made the "deadline." But three of the
Valiant Four went from dorm to dorm, awakening staffers and pulling
others from the breakfast table.
Soon, the Daily had 14 in the outfield — and a wide, if unfair, lead.
A cameo appearance by Jason "Homerun" Cole clinched the Daily
victory and scared the PJFs, who resorted to calling Cole, left fielder Steve
Trousdale and first baseman Carl Johnson Daily "imposters."
PJFs next year have nowhere to go but up, since yesterday's game
marked the second Daily victory against the Old Folks this year.
