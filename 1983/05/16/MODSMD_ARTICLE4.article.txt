# Library may limit Meyer access
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff Writer 
Meyer library might not seem like
a place that would attract a steady
stream of outsiders, but non-
University traffic at the library is be
coming a problem. Students from
local high schools and colleges are
using Meyer with an enthusiasm ri
valing that of the average pre-med
freshman, and the drain on facilities
and reference personnel may cause
the University to limit Meyer access.
"We have not definitely decided to
close access to the library," said
Meyer Head librarian Elizabeth
Salzer, "and if we do it probably
won't be until winter quarter of next
year."
To see if a limited access policy is at
all necessary, the library staff de
cided to survey incoming Meyer traf
fic for a week. The survey, which
began last Monday and ended yes
terday, was designed to "see if our
perceptions are accurate," Salzer
said.
Library personnel were stationed
al the portal of the library; those en
tering Meyer were asked to show
their student identification and say
whether they were undergraduate or
graduate students. In addition to
tabulating the number of non-
University persons entering the li
brary, the survey showed at which
hours traffic was lightest and
heaviest.

"Our perception is that the library
is used more by outsiders during the
weekend," Salzer said.
Dale Canelas, director of public
services for University libraries,
commented that outside traffic dur
ing intersessions was particularly
heavy.
According to Canelas, Meyer libra
rians begin noticing increased non-
University traffic when Green Library
was closed to public access in Janu
ary 1980.
Originally, only the stacks in

Green were closed to the public,"
Canelas said. "The reference roorr
and the card catalog could still be
used by anyone. "
The presence of "outsiders" in
Meyer library is not obvious or irritat
ing; the main complaint about public
access is that Stanford students then
have to compete for reference help.
"It places a greater burden on some
of our services," Salzer said. "We
don't want to see Stanford students
waiting while someone who isn't
from Stanford is being helped.''
