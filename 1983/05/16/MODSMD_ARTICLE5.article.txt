Dole pushes budget compromise
Washington — Declaring that the congressional
budget process is not a "spectator sport," Senate Fi
nance Committee Chairman Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
urged President Reagan yesterday to mount a "full
coi; press" on Capitol Hill along with top House and
Senate leaders to help break the stalemate over taxing
and spending priorities.
Dole, an influential COP leader, said there are
enough Republicans and Democrats to put together a
"fairly conservative" budget resolution for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1 if the president signals his will
ingness to help Congress reach a compromise.
Without changes in tax and spending programs,
federal budget deficits over the next three years

could total between $550 billion and $650 billion,
"any way you slice it,"and pose a serious threat to a
sustained economic recovery, Dole said.
"It's time for the president to become a participant
in the budget process," Dole said in an interview on
ABC-TV's "This Week with David Brinkley." "He is
the president. Whether or not he succeeds in '84, as I
believe he will, will depend on the economy — and
that's going to depend somewhat on the deficit."
Two Democratic members of the House Budget
Committee, Reps. Timothy Wirth of Colorado and
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, also called yesterday
for the president to become more actively involved in
budgetmaking.
PLO dissention over Arafat
Beirut — Rebellion against the leadership of Yasser
Arafat has broken out among the ranks of the
Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas in
eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, according to several
reports reaching here.
According to the still sketchy accounts, there have
been recent battles in the Bekaa between PLO ele
ments supporting and opposing Arafat, and on one
occasion a sit-in demonstration there to protest his
continuing leadership.
Arafat went to the area Friday and Saturday, re
portedly in an effort to resolve the dispute.
The reports came as Israeli and Lebanese nego
tiators, meeting in Netanya, Israel, reached agree
ment on a final text of a U.S.-sponsored plan for with
drawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. Israeli radio
said the agreement would be signed tomorrow.
Syrian President Hafez Assad has sharply attacked
the Lebanese-Israeli accord, and yesterday Arafat
condemned it.
"An effective war is the only way to redraw the po
litical map of the Middle East," Arafat told members
of Fatah, his faction within the PLO. "The way out of
this present deadlock is taking a decision to wage war
to change the balance of power," Arafat said, urging
his followers to battle the "Zionist-American enemy."
Israel wants Syrians out
Jerusalem — Refusing to take Syria's "no" for an an
swer, Israel served notice yesterday that it is prepared
for a long and tense process aimed at securing the
withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
After the regular weekly Cabinet meeting, spokes
man Dan Meridor'said Israel continues to hope that
Syria will withdraw its troops from Lebanon despite
President Hafez Assad's flat rejection of the Israeli-
Lebanese agreement for the pullout of Israeli forces.
"But it may take some time," Meridor told re
porters. "It is obvious that we want to hear the Syrian
reply, but we are not standing with a stopwatch and
wouldn't set any deadline now."
Senior Israeli officials, meanwhile, said that they ex
pect Damascus to maintain a high level of military
pressure on both Lebanon and Israel during the
course of Lebanese-Syrian talks about the withdrawal
of Syrian forces. One official said it has been Syria's
habit to accompany negotiations with military pres
sure.
Defense Minister Moshe Arens told the Cabinet
that he does not expect Syria to launch an all-out war,
according to accounts broadcast by Israel radio and
Israel armed forces radio. But Arens reportedly said
that Damascus might initiate "limited hostilities" in an
effort to "torpedo the troop withdrawal accord with
Lebanon."
Leaders seek help for industry
Washington — Seventy-eight of the nation's busi
ness and academic leaders, warning that foreign com
petition is undermining U.S. "social and economic
well-being," appealed yesterday to President Reagan

to lead a drive to revitalize U.S. industry and spur ex
ports.
The leaders, who said they plan to meet with the
president May 26, recommended a variety of reme
dies, including cutting governmental red tape, grant
ing more tax incentives to businesses and mobilizing
public opinion.
"The central objective of domestic policy for the
remainder of the decade must be to improve the abili
ty of American industry and American workers to
compete on an international scale," the Business-
Higher Education Forum declared.
The group made its statements in a report, "Ameri
ca's Competitive Challenge: The Need for a National
Response," that was prepared at the request of Dr.
Robert Woolsey, Reagan's science adviser.
"Unless we rebuild the American economy and
strengthen our educational system, it will be increas
ingly difficult — if not impossible — to maintain a just
society, a high standard of living for all Americansand
a strong national defense," the leaders said in the re
port.
The panel includes top executives from firms such
as AT&T, General Electric, and the Ford Motor Co, as
well as the presidents of Harvard, Notre Dame and
other major universities.
The report called for a national displaced workers
program to provide education or training benefits
along the lines of the G.I. Bill. They said this "could be
self-financed by a third trust fund in the unemploy
ment insurance system," supported by workers, em
ployers and the federal government.
Chinese man jailed as U.S. spy
Peking — Lo Fu, founder and editor of the New Eve
ning Post, a Communist newspaper published in
Hong Kong, has been jailed here for 10 years as a U.S.
spy, Chinese authorities announced yesterday.
Lo pleaded guilty to charges of providing an un
named U.S. intelligence agency with "important se
cret information about China's political, diplomatic
and military affairs," the official New China News
Agency reported. It said Fu had been working as an
American spy for several years and was paid regularly
by the United States. It did not disclose the exact na
ture of the information he was accused of passing.
The case reflects the deterioration of Sino-Ameri
can relations. Lo was convicted under the section of
the Chinese criminal code forbidding disclosure of
secret information to "the enemy," a characterization
that China stopped applying to the United States
nearly a decade ago.
The emphasis on Lo's spying for the United States is
certain to raise questions here about Sino-American
relations.
There was no immediate comment from either the
U.S. Embassy here or the U.S. Consulate General in
Hong Kong.

The report called for a national displaced workers
program to provide education or training benefits
along the lines of the G.I. Bill. They said this "could be
self-financed by a third trust fund in the unemploy

Chinese man jailed as U.S. spy
Peking — Lo Fu, founder and editor of the New Eve
ning Post, a Communist newspaper published in
Hong Kong, has been jailed here for 10 years as a U.S.
spy, Chinese authorities announced yesterday.
Lo pleaded guilty to charges of providing an un
named U.S. intelligence agency with "important se
cret information about China's political, diplomatic
and military affairs," the official New China News
Agency reported. It said Fu had been working as an
American spy for several years and was paid regularly
by the United States. It did not disclose the exact na
ture of the information he was accused of passing.
The case reflects the deterioration of Sino-Ameri
can relations. Lo was convicted under the section of
the Chinese criminal code forbidding disclosure of
secret information to "the enemy," a characterization
that China stopped applying to the United States
nearly a decade ago.
The emphasis on Lo's spying for the United States is
certain to raise questions here about Sino-American
relations.
There was no immediate comment from either the
U.S. Embassy here or the U.S. Consulate General in
Hong Kong.

Dole pushes budget compromise
Washington — Declaring that the congressional
budget process is not a "spectator sport," Senate Fi
nance Committee Chairman Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
urged President Reagan yesterday to mount a "full
coi; press" on Capitol Hill along with top House and
Senate leaders to help break the stalemate over taxing
and spending priorities.
Dole, an influential COP leader, said there are
enough Republicans and Democrats to put together a
"fairly conservative" budget resolution for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1 if the president signals his will
ingness to help Congress reach a compromise.
Without changes in tax and spending programs,
federal budget deficits over the next three years

could total between $550 billion and $650 billion,
"any way you slice it,"and pose a serious threat to a
sustained economic recovery, Dole said.
"It's time for the president to become a participant
in the budget process," Dole said in an interview on
ABC-TV's "This Week with David Brinkley." "He is
the president. Whether or not he succeeds in '84, as I
believe he will, will depend on the economy — and
that's going to depend somewhat on the deficit."
Two Democratic members of the House Budget
Committee, Reps. Timothy Wirth of Colorado and
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, also called yesterday
for the president to become more actively involved in
budgetmaking.
PLO dissention over Arafat
Beirut — Rebellion against the leadership of Yasser
Arafat has broken out among the ranks of the
Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas in
eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, according to several
reports reaching here.
According to the still sketchy accounts, there have
been recent battles in the Bekaa between PLO ele
ments supporting and opposing Arafat, and on one
occasion a sit-in demonstration there to protest his
continuing leadership.
Arafat went to the area Friday and Saturday, re
portedly in an effort to resolve the dispute.
The reports came as Israeli and Lebanese nego
tiators, meeting in Netanya, Israel, reached agree
ment on a final text of a U.S.-sponsored plan for with
drawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. Israeli radio
said the agreement would be signed tomorrow.
Syrian President Hafez Assad has sharply attacked
the Lebanese-Israeli accord, and yesterday Arafat
condemned it.
"An effective war is the only way to redraw the po
litical map of the Middle East," Arafat told members
of Fatah, his faction within the PLO. "The way out of
this present deadlock is taking a decision to wage war
to change the balance of power," Arafat said, urging
his followers to battle the "Zionist-American enemy."
Israel wants Syrians out
Jerusalem — Refusing to take Syria's "no" for an an
swer, Israel served notice yesterday that it is prepared
for a long and tense process aimed at securing the
withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
After the regular weekly Cabinet meeting, spokes
man Dan Meridor'said Israel continues to hope that
Syria will withdraw its troops from Lebanon despite
President Hafez Assad's flat rejection of the Israeli-
Lebanese agreement for the pullout of Israeli forces.
"But it may take some time," Meridor told re
porters. "It is obvious that we want to hear the Syrian
reply, but we are not standing with a stopwatch and
wouldn't set any deadline now."
Senior Israeli officials, meanwhile, said that they ex
pect Damascus to maintain a high level of military
pressure on both Lebanon and Israel during the
course of Lebanese-Syrian talks about the withdrawal
of Syrian forces. One official said it has been Syria's
habit to accompany negotiations with military pres
sure.
Defense Minister Moshe Arens told the Cabinet
that he does not expect Syria to launch an all-out war,
according to accounts broadcast by Israel radio and
Israel armed forces radio. But Arens reportedly said
that Damascus might initiate "limited hostilities" in an
effort to "torpedo the troop withdrawal accord with
Lebanon."
Leaders seek help for industry
Washington — Seventy-eight of the nation's busi
ness and academic leaders, warning that foreign com
petition is undermining U.S. "social and economic
well-being," appealed yesterday to President Reagan

to lead a drive to revitalize U.S. industry and spur ex
ports.
The leaders, who said they plan to meet with the
president May 26, recommended a variety of reme
dies, including cutting governmental red tape, grant
ing more tax incentives to businesses and mobilizing
public opinion.
"The central objective of domestic policy for the
remainder of the decade must be to improve the abili
ty of American industry and American workers to
compete on an international scale," the Business-
Higher Education Forum declared.
The group made its statements in a report, "Ameri
ca's Competitive Challenge: The Need for a National
Response," that was prepared at the request of Dr.
Robert Woolsey, Reagan's science adviser.
"Unless we rebuild the American economy and
strengthen our educational system, it will be increas
ingly difficult — if not impossible — to maintain a just
society, a high standard of living for all Americansand
a strong national defense," the leaders said in the re
port.
The panel includes top executives from firms such
as AT&T, General Electric, and the Ford Motor Co, as
well as the presidents of Harvard, Notre Dame and
other major universities.
The report called for a national displaced workers
