Dole pushes budget compromise
Washington — Declaring that the congressional
budget process is not a "spectator sport," Senate Fi
nance Committee Chairman Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
urged President Reagan yesterday to mount a "full
coi; press" on Capitol Hill along with top House and
Senate leaders to help break the stalemate over taxing
and spending priorities.
Dole, an influential COP leader, said there are
enough Republicans and Democrats to put together a
"fairly conservative" budget resolution for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1 if the president signals his will
ingness to help Congress reach a compromise.
Without changes in tax and spending programs,
federal budget deficits over the next three years

could total between $550 billion and $650 billion,
"any way you slice it,"and pose a serious threat to a
sustained economic recovery, Dole said.
"It's time for the president to become a participant
in the budget process," Dole said in an interview on
ABC-TV's "This Week with David Brinkley." "He is
the president. Whether or not he succeeds in '84, as I
believe he will, will depend on the economy — and
that's going to depend somewhat on the deficit."
Two Democratic members of the House Budget
Committee, Reps. Timothy Wirth of Colorado and
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, also called yesterday
for the president to become more actively involved in
budgetmaking.
