# Off-campus renters face problems
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
The student renters' clothes dryer caught on fire
because their landlord failed to install it properly.
Several choices faced the tenants: they could
forget the problem or approach their landlord. If the
landlord refused to correct the problem, they could
go to court or contact a mediator.
The above case ended well. The landlord admitted
she was at fault. The student tenants fixed the dryer
and deducted the repair costs from the rent. Their
advice: let the buyer beware.
About 60 percent of the students here — 34 percent
of the graduate and 85 percent of undergraduate
population — live on campus and pay room rates to
the University. But most of the other 40 percent must
pay off-campus rent to landlords who are often less
benevolent than the University.
Many students claim area landlords hold distorted
views of "normal wear and tear," dislike "noisy" un
dergraduate renters or charge excessive rental rates.
Rental rates within a five-mile radius of campus
have skyrocketed in the last few years. According to
Molly Kunkel, director of the Off-Campus Housing
Office, one-bedroom listings have jumped from an
verage of $250 in 1977 to $400 in 1980 to $500 in 1983.

According to the 1980 census, the average Palo Alto
rent as of April 1979 was $352 per month.
Renting is common throughout the Bay Area, not
just around Stanford. Almost half of the 54,000 resi
dents of Palo Alto are renters. The student percent
age of this renter population has dropped in recent
years, according to Miller. He attributed the decline
to stepped up Palo Alto rents and to the increased
number of available housing units on campus.
Rental rates
The good news: it's cheaper to rent in the Bay Area
than in New York City. The bad news: it's still expen
sive to rent here.
Average rents on the Peninsula range from $450 to
$550 for one-bedroom and from $550 to $650 for
two-bedroom units, according to John klymp, presi
dent of the Tri-County Apartment Association, a
group of 3500 landlords in San Mateo, Santa Clara and
Santa Cruz counties.
Students suffer most, since new tenants moving
into apartments can expect to pay the market rate
while long-time tenants usually receive gradual in
creases that bring them up to market rates.
Klymp, also president of
Mayfield Management Com
pany, which owns 120 apart
ments in Palo Alto, Los Gatos
and Los Altos, said he keeps his
tenants annual rent increases
between 7 and 10 percent.
Rents must be at least that
high to pay for the landlords'
rising costs, he said.
During the '70s rents rose
more slowly than other prices.
Between 1970 and 1980, when
home sale prices increased

339.2 percent, rents increased
only 114.8 percent.
Rent controls are an unlikely
solution, Roe said. In 1978, 63
percent of Palo Alto voters re
jected putting controls on the
amount landlords can raise
rents.
Students should be careful
in setting up sub-leasing and
sub-letting arrangements.
Keith Suddjien, chairman of
the rental housing mediation
task force, said, "The original

tenant is ultimately responsi
ble to the landlord for rent."
Suddjien distinguished sub
leasing, or signing a lease,
from sub-letting, which is un
official. "Ihey (the sub-leasers)
may get burned if the person
doesn't pay them or if the per
son doesn't pay the landlord,"
he said.
Students suffer in the rent
race, since they tend to be here
on a shorter term basis than
older residents. Thus their
rents reflect increases faster.
Help for renters
On-campus residents can
complain to Res Ed, but the an
swers_.for those living off
campus do not come so easily.
Renters raise numerous
questions: What risks do stu
dent tenants face in defaulting
on or breaking a lease? What
are the terms and clauses in a
lease? What happens when a
tenant causes excessive dam
ages or when a landlord fails to
fix broken appliances?
The Rental Housing Media
tion Task Force, which consists
of 10 to 12 members who vol
unteer their time, is one such
group which tries to mediate
disputes over these questions.
According to senior Jeff
Bradach, a volunteer mediator
for the task force, "The law is
vague on what normal wear
and tear is," Bradach said. As a
result, many renters feel their
deposit is withheld without
reason.
Most callers are not vindic
tive or unreasonable, Bradach
said. "Usually when they call,
they're people who want to see
an end to the problem,"
Bradach said. "Often it's just a
matter of communication."
The Palo Alto Information
and Referral Service (PAIRS),
funded by the city of Palo Alto,
also offers services to renters
and landlords. PAIRS
mediators attempt to prevent
the tenant and landlord from
going to small claims court

over these problems.
Barbara Krzyczkowska, a
specialist for the information
and referral service, estimated
that between 10 and 15 percent
of the calls the service receives
are from Stantord students.
Stanford students often call
about housemate problems,
Krzyczkowska said. "A lot of
things at Stanford are made on
an oral basis,'' she said, rec
ommending that students get
written agreements from their
friends. "Rentingan apartment
is a business," Krzyczkowska
said.
She suggested that a student
approach a fellow housemate
as follows: "Look, I realize that

we're best friends, but let's get
this in writing."
PAIRS receives calls from
landlords as well as tenants,
Krvzckzkowska said, but the
tenant/landlord ratio is 10:1. It
is not a tenant advocacy group.
"We won't call on behalf of the
tenant," Krzyckzkowska said.
Usually, she said, "both parties
have done something they
probably shouldn't have
done."
The mediator — a volunteer
— contacts the first calling
party, then calls the second
party. If telephone mediation
fails, then the mediator tries to
set up a meeting between the
two parties in a neutral spot.

Each side receives a specific
amount of time to air its griev
ances.
"A good 60 percent, once it
goes to mediation, get set
tled," Krzyckzkowska said.
Unsettled cases proceed to
small claims court.
Hard to get?
Finding a house or apart
ment to rent is not easy. The
five-mile radius of campus has
a vacancy rate of less than 1
percent, according to Molly
Kunkel, director of the Rental
Housing Office.
Finding an affordable house
or apartment is even more dif
ficult. According to Kunkel,
studio apartments average

$400 to $450, one bedrooms
average $500 and two bed
rooms average $()00. A room in
a family home averages $250,
she said, and "shares" average
$300. According to Kunkel,
most student renters share
houses or apartments.
More than 1500 students use
the Rental Housing Office
clearinghouse in September,
Kunkel said. The clearing
house receives about 4000 list
ings a year. "We operate
somewhat like a newspaper,"
she said. But the clearinghouse
will be computerized within a
month. The clearinghouse
rents about 75 percent of its
listings.

student body which rents.

The student renters' clothes dryer caught on fire
because their landlord failed to install it properly.
Several choices faced the tenants: they could
forget the problem or approach their landlord. If the
landlord refused to correct the problem, they could
go to court or contact a mediator.
The above case ended well. The landlord admitted
she was at fault. The student tenants fixed the dryer
and deducted the repair costs from the rent. Their
advice: let the buyer beware.
About 60 percent of the students here — 34 percent
of the graduate and 85 percent of undergraduate
population — live on campus and pay room rates to
the University. But most of the other 40 percent must
pay off-campus rent to landlords who are often less
benevolent than the University.
Many students claim area landlords hold distorted
views of "normal wear and tear," dislike "noisy" un
dergraduate renters or charge excessive rental rates.
Rental rates within a five-mile radius of campus
have skyrocketed in the last few years. According to
Molly Kunkel, director of the Off-Campus Housing
Office, one-bedroom listings have jumped from an
verage of $250 in 1977 to $400 in 1980 to $500 in 1983.

According to the 1980 census, the average Palo Alto
rent as of April 1979 was $352 per month.
Renting is common throughout the Bay Area, not
just around Stanford. Almost half of the 54,000 resi
dents of Palo Alto are renters. The student percent
age of this renter population has dropped in recent
years, according to Miller. He attributed the decline
to stepped up Palo Alto rents and to the increased
number of available housing units on campus.
Rental rates
The good news: it's cheaper to rent in the Bay Area
than in New York City. The bad news: it's still expen
sive to rent here.
Average rents on the Peninsula range from $450 to
$550 for one-bedroom and from $550 to $650 for
two-bedroom units, according to John klymp, presi
dent of the Tri-County Apartment Association, a
group of 3500 landlords in San Mateo, Santa Clara and
Santa Cruz counties.
Students suffer most, since new tenants moving
into apartments can expect to pay the market rate
while long-time tenants usually receive gradual in
creases that bring them up to market rates.
Klymp, also president of
Mayfield Management Com
pany, which owns 120 apart
ments in Palo Alto, Los Gatos
and Los Altos, said he keeps his
tenants annual rent increases
between 7 and 10 percent.
Rents must be at least that
high to pay for the landlords'
rising costs, he said.
During the '70s rents rose
more slowly than other prices.
Between 1970 and 1980, when
home sale prices increased

339.2 percent, rents increased
only 114.8 percent.
Rent controls are an unlikely
solution, Roe said. In 1978, 63
percent of Palo Alto voters re
jected putting controls on the
amount landlords can raise
rents.
Students should be careful
in setting up sub-leasing and
sub-letting arrangements.
Keith Suddjien, chairman of
the rental housing mediation
task force, said, "The original

tenant is ultimately responsi
ble to the landlord for rent."
Suddjien distinguished sub
leasing, or signing a lease,
from sub-letting, which is un
official. "Ihey (the sub-leasers)
may get burned if the person
doesn't pay them or if the per
son doesn't pay the landlord,"
he said.
Students suffer in the rent
race, since they tend to be here
on a shorter term basis than
older residents. Thus their
rents reflect increases faster.
Help for renters
On-campus residents can
complain to Res Ed, but the an
swers_.for those living off
campus do not come so easily.
Renters raise numerous
questions: What risks do stu
dent tenants face in defaulting
on or breaking a lease? What
are the terms and clauses in a
lease? What happens when a
tenant causes excessive dam
ages or when a landlord fails to
fix broken appliances?
The Rental Housing Media
tion Task Force, which consists
of 10 to 12 members who vol
unteer their time, is one such
group which tries to mediate
disputes over these questions.
According to senior Jeff
Bradach, a volunteer mediator
for the task force, "The law is
vague on what normal wear
and tear is," Bradach said. As a
result, many renters feel their
deposit is withheld without
reason.
Most callers are not vindic
tive or unreasonable, Bradach
said. "Usually when they call,
they're people who want to see
an end to the problem,"
Bradach said. "Often it's just a
matter of communication."
The Palo Alto Information
and Referral Service (PAIRS),
funded by the city of Palo Alto,
also offers services to renters
and landlords. PAIRS
mediators attempt to prevent
the tenant and landlord from
going to small claims court

over these problems.
Barbara Krzyczkowska, a
specialist for the information
and referral service, estimated
that between 10 and 15 percent
of the calls the service receives
are from Stantord students.
Stanford students often call
about housemate problems,
Krzyczkowska said. "A lot of
things at Stanford are made on
an oral basis,'' she said, rec
ommending that students get
written agreements from their
friends. "Rentingan apartment
is a business," Krzyczkowska
said.
She suggested that a student
approach a fellow housemate
as follows: "Look, I realize that

we're best friends, but let's get
this in writing."
PAIRS receives calls from
landlords as well as tenants,
Krvzckzkowska said, but the
tenant/landlord ratio is 10:1. It
is not a tenant advocacy group.
"We won't call on behalf of the
tenant," Krzyckzkowska said.
Usually, she said, "both parties
have done something they
probably shouldn't have
done."
The mediator — a volunteer
— contacts the first calling
party, then calls the second
party. If telephone mediation
fails, then the mediator tries to
set up a meeting between the
two parties in a neutral spot.

Each side receives a specific
amount of time to air its griev
ances.
"A good 60 percent, once it
goes to mediation, get set
tled," Krzyckzkowska said.
Unsettled cases proceed to
small claims court.
Hard to get?
Finding a house or apart
ment to rent is not easy. The
five-mile radius of campus has
a vacancy rate of less than 1
percent, according to Molly
Kunkel, director of the Rental
Housing Office.
Finding an affordable house
or apartment is even more dif
ficult. According to Kunkel,
studio apartments average

$400 to $450, one bedrooms
average $500 and two bed
rooms average $()00. A room in
a family home averages $250,
she said, and "shares" average
$300. According to Kunkel,
most student renters share
houses or apartments.
More than 1500 students use
the Rental Housing Office
clearinghouse in September,
Kunkel said. The clearing
house receives about 4000 list
ings a year. "We operate
somewhat like a newspaper,"
she said. But the clearinghouse
will be computerized within a
month. The clearinghouse
rents about 75 percent of its
listings.
