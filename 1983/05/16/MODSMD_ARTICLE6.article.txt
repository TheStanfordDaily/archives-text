# Off-campus renters face problems
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
The student renters' clothes dryer caught on fire
because their landlord failed to install it properly.
Several choices faced the tenants: they could
forget the problem or approach their landlord. If the
landlord refused to correct the problem, they could
go to court or contact a mediator.
The above case ended well. The landlord admitted
she was at fault. The student tenants fixed the dryer
and deducted the repair costs from the rent. Their
advice: let the buyer beware.
About 60 percent of the students here — 34 percent
of the graduate and 85 percent of undergraduate
population — live on campus and pay room rates to
the University. But most of the other 40 percent must
pay off-campus rent to landlords who are often less
benevolent than the University.
Many students claim area landlords hold distorted
views of "normal wear and tear," dislike "noisy" un
dergraduate renters or charge excessive rental rates.
Rental rates within a five-mile radius of campus
have skyrocketed in the last few years. According to
Molly Kunkel, director of the Off-Campus Housing
Office, one-bedroom listings have jumped from an
verage of $250 in 1977 to $400 in 1980 to $500 in 1983.

According to the 1980 census, the average Palo Alto
rent as of April 1979 was $352 per month.
Renting is common throughout the Bay Area, not
just around Stanford. Almost half of the 54,000 resi
dents of Palo Alto are renters. The student percent
age of this renter population has dropped in recent
years, according to Miller. He attributed the decline
to stepped up Palo Alto rents and to the increased
number of available housing units on campus.
Rental rates
The good news: it's cheaper to rent in the Bay Area
than in New York City. The bad news: it's still expen
sive to rent here.
Average rents on the Peninsula range from $450 to
$550 for one-bedroom and from $550 to $650 for
two-bedroom units, according to John klymp, presi
dent of the Tri-County Apartment Association, a
group of 3500 landlords in San Mateo, Santa Clara and
Santa Cruz counties.
Students suffer most, since new tenants moving
into apartments can expect to pay the market rate
while long-time tenants usually receive gradual in
creases that bring them up to market rates.
