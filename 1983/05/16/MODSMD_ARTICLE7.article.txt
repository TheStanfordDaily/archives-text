# Colts owner wants to 'get' Elway
## 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Baltimore Colts owner Robert Irsay on Saturday
backed down on statements he made Thursday that his
team would "get" former Stanford quarterback )ohn
Elway.
Irsay explained he did not intend that his players
would intentionally hurt Elway, who turned down the
Colts when they made him the No. 1 draft pick last
month and said he would play baseball with the New
York Yankess.
"What reference we made is that several (of our) de
fensive players, without mentioning their names, are
quarterback sackers," Irsay told the Associated Press. "If
Elway's a quarterback, they would go after him, just like
any other quarterback. That is the intent of the entire
statement."
National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle
on Friday reprimanded Irsay for his statements.
As Irsay announced the signing of offensive tackle
Chris Hinton, who the Denver Broncos traded to Balti
more along with quarterback Mark Herrmann and a fu
ture draft choice for Elway, he said: "We are also signing
a couple of boys this week who are looking for Elway.
We are going to get Elway."
Elway was on his way to Denver for a quarterback
mini-camp last night and was not available for comment,
but earlier he said that the comments did not disturb
him.

"That's his freedom of speech," Elway said. "I'm not
concerned with that stuff. I'm glad to be with the Bron
cos. I've said all along I had nothing against the Colts
Last week's statement by Irsay was not the first time
the feisty owner had grabbed headlines since he ac
quired the Colts in a 1972 franchise swap with former Los
Angeles Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom.
Irsay, in fact, negotiated the deal that sent Elway to
Denver without consulting his general manager or coach.
Before chastising Elway for not wanting to play in a
cold-weather city like Baltimore, Irsay had spent several
years disenchanting Colt fans with threats to move the
team to a warm-weather site like Memphis, Tenn.,
Phoenix, Ariz, or lacksonville, Fla.
The Colts, 0-8-1 in their strike-abbreviated season last
year, have been in disarray since their season finale last
December.
Colts Coach Frank Kush was recently notified that he
must face more charges stemming from an incident
while he was coaching at Arizona State when he al
legedly struck punter Kevin Rutledge.
Quarterback Art Schlichter's NFL future has been
cloudy since he admitted involvement with gamblers
and helped FBI agents track down several gambling
bookies to whom he owed gambling debts reported to
exceed S1(M),000.
The failure of the Colts to trade their No. 1 pick or to
sign Elway also had many fans irritated at Colt manage
ment.
