## Expert: nuclear waste can be stored safely 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
The United States now has the
technology to dispose of nuclear
waste relatively safely, but the
"sociopolitical" problems of dis
posal remain to be solved, a
geologist told about 200 people in
the History Corner Saturday.
"It's fair to say that the technical
problem of disposing of waste is
pretty well in hand," Konrad Kraus
kopf, emeritus professor of applied
earth sciences, said. "We know
enough now so that radioactive
waste could be disposed of using
techniques that we have available."
But some political problems are
posed by the current proposal to
bury nuclear waste in deep under
ground shafts, Krauskopf said.
Although the risks of radiation es
caping from an underground nuclear
waste repository are comparable to

the risks of driving a car, people are
still afraid to have disposal sites near
their homes, Krauskopf said.
"Would you be willing to have one
of these waste repositories con
structed near where you live?"
Krauskopf said.
Despite this problem of location,
the geologist said he is still optimistic
that the problem of nuclear waste
disposal will soon be solved.
"Real progress has been made in
the last five to 10 years," Krauskopf
said. Soon the United States should
be able to move toward "getting rid
of this nasty stuff permanently."
In fact, the United States should
have at least one operating reposit
ory for radioactive waste by the end
of the century, Krauskopf said.
Speaking at the 51st anuual Stan
ford Conference, Krauskopf called
nuclear waste disposal "one of the
great problems facing this country

and other industrialized nations."
The used fuel rods from commer
cial nuclear reactors, along with the
nitric acid solution left after the pro
cess of plutonium extraction by the
military, are among the most
dangerous forms of nuclear waste,
he said.
Although all radioactive materials
ultimately decay into familiar, harm
less elements, some elements "re
main dangerous for a long period of
time."
"Can we imagine that our remote
descendants — say 100,000 years
from now — will still be interested in
taking care of the waste that we gen
erate?" Krauskopf asked.
Currently, the radioactive waste
from all over the country would fill
Stanford Stadium "considerably
above the half-way mark," Krauskopf
said.
But the radioactive waste gener

ated over 40 years is still something
less than 1 percent of the chemical
waste generated each year.
Many types of "ingenious
schemes" have been proposed to rid
the nation of its nuclear waste,
krauskopf said. Some proposals ad
vise firing the waste out into space,
burying it on the bottom of the ocean
or installing it at the South Pole.
But the most effective method is
geologic disposal, krauskopf said.
Under this method, workers would
solidify the radioactive waste and
place it in metal cans. Then they
would sink a shaft into the ground,
place the cans in the shaft, fill the
remaining cavity and finally seal the
shaft.
Although the safety of this method
cannot be ensured for millions of
years, he said, the danger to human
ity is much less than that of many
other risks.

kopf told a large crowd at the history corner Saturday that underground
disposal of nuclear waste was safe using current technology. The talk was
part of the 'Breakthroughs' conference sponsored by the Alumni Asso
ciation.
