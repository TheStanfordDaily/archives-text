# Humane society still to file charges against researcher for animal abuse
## 
### JUDSON LOBDELL 
The Peninsula Human Society is "close to bringing
charges" against the Veterans Administration (V.A.)
Hospital and Stanford researchers for alleged mistreat
ment of a dog used in research at the V.A. hospital in
March, according to the society's director.
"There has been some abuse and someone should be
prosecuted," Director Richard Ward told the Daily.
On Thursday, the Peninsula Times Tribune reported
that the Humane Society was "backing down" on
charges against Stanford personnel.
"Stanford researchers are definitely at fault. The ex
periment was V.A. funded, but Stanford people de
signed the project and participated in it,"he said.
James Dewson, director of the University's Division of
Laboratory Animal Medicine, would not name the re
searchers involved in the project. "The matter is totally
out of Stanford's jurisdiction," he said.
The charges stem from a March 24 incident in which
Stanford medical student Peter Barran found an injured
dog walking in the halls of the Veterans Administration
Hospital.
The dog had ulcers on all four legs and an open surgi
cal wound in its groin.
Barran notified Stanford veterinarian Carolyn Reed
who instructed him to return the dog to the hospital.
Barran refused and took the animal to Palo Alto veterina
rian Randy Hemphill.
Hemphill euthanized the dog.

The Veterans Administration maintained that the
dog's injuries were caused in a fight with another dog
and were not the result of experimental misconduct.
"We have conducted an investigation into the matter
which clears all our personnel," said Veterans Adminis
tration Hospital Director Peter DeNiro.
Ward called the V.A. inquiry "inadequate" and
claimed that DeNiro was slowing down his own investi
gation. "Apparently an edict has been passed down by
DeNiro that no one is to talk to humane society inves
tigators," he said.
Stanford medical spokesman Michael Coodkind con
curred with DeNiro, saying, "There has been no abuse
of any kind by anyone involved with Stanford. This issue
has been blown way out of proportion by those who
think Stanford is an easy target."
Ward denied that the charges are part of a campaign
against Stanford by anti-vivisectionists who condemn
the University's extensive use of laboratory animals for
testing. Ward said that abuse of animals by Stanford
researchers is widespread.
The charges to be brought against the V.A. and Stan
ford personnel will probably fall under Santa Clara
County ordinance section 84-12, which states, "it shall
be unlawful to maliciously kill, maim, wound, mutilate,
torment, tortue or physically abuse any animal."
Dewson said he is confident that an investigation by
the district attorney will exonerate Stanford researchers
involved in the incident.
