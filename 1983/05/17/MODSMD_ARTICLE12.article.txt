## The
						Stanford Daily Major decisions 
### 
Do students take an overly utilitarian view of
their education? University President Donald
Kennedy thinks so, and said as much at last
week's "A Major Event" held in the Quad.
"The subject to major in," Kennedy said, "is
exactly what you desire." Provost Alberl Hastorf
agreed with his boss saying, "You should study
what you find interesting, exciting and demand
ing, and not what you think will be economically
rewarding, because that may not be true in 10
years."
These words go against the trend on this
campus to pursue only those subjects that are
eminently practical. All too often a student
studiesonly what he feels he ought to study, not
what he really wants to study.
Vet, for students looking about for majors,
the words of Kennedy must have seemed con
fusing. A tight economy encourages students to
follow paths that offer the most job security. A
major in say, anthropology, seems like a tre
mendous gamble in that its future job potential
is much less ohvious.

The idea of a major's day is a good one espe
cially because the event demonstrated the vast
educational options which the University has to
offer. However, even the soothing words of
President Kennedy can not totally ease the pain
of decision between the practical and the en
joyable.
If "A Majors Event" did nothing to resolve the
persistent dilemma involved in choosing a
major, then perhaps it at least encouraged stu
dents to explore the University a bit. Of course,
the event was not an end-all but only the begin
ning of a process designed to peak student's
curiosity and to make their choice of a major a
more intelligent one. A side benefit of the event
was the sight of all the University departments
coming together for the common purpose of, as
coordinator Audrey Bernfield put it, "giving
students the message that they are free without
penalty to major in what they love."
Whether students accept this message re
mains to be seen.
