Why? Because I have been faithfully spending every
other Saturday for the last eight months attempting to
write something that would at least distract you, hope
fully inspire you and maybe even get you to rethink
some of your ideas and opinions. Since I could not rely
on my modest writing skills to accomplish this, I formu
lated a plan of action one cold, gray day last October.
My first step was to move up the Daily columnist
hierarchy so as to be able to secure that strategic space
on the fourth page every other Tuesday. Why Tuesdays?
Well, for two reasons. First, it's the less hangover-prone
day of the week. The relationship between the afteref
fects of alcohol and one's desire to read anything "seri
ous" is fairly straightforward, so I will not comment
upon it.
Instead, I will comment upon the second, perhaps
less obvious reason. Tuesday is one of those days in
which there is no sports section in the Daily. This is
important because the sports page seems to be the only
faithfully read section of most daily newspapers. If any

thing, I figured that the existence of a news-hungry/
sports-deprived/clear-headed crowd would slightly in
crease the chances of my column being read. After much
behind-the-typewriter maneuvering and the formula
tion of some blatant threats, I was successful in achiev
ing the first part of my plan.
The next step was to master some dubious article
writing techniques and methods. Anthony Downs, a
Brookings Institution senior fellow, has described these
in terms of one's ability to use "mega-hyping psuedo
facts." More simply, Downs was referring to the fairly
common practice that exists among journalists of pre
sentinganecdotes and events concealed as facts in order
to support their claims. Another form of this technique
is the renowned hype-a-trend. This is something along
the lines of "it's a proven fact that as many as 75 percent
of Stanford students will be earning over $40,000 per
year within five years after graduation." Unfortunately,
one never knows whether the figure is closer to one or
75 percent.

Another method, of which I am particularly fond, is
the "gradually retracted shocker." For instance, just
think back to my "Athletes avoid opportunities" or "The
hypocrisy of free trade" articles. The key is to catch the
reader's attention with an initial stomach-disturbing
generalization even when the arguments contained in
the ensuing paragraphs don't necessarily follow suit and
may even prove an opposite point of view, judging from
the responses my columns have generated over the last
three quarters, I would venture to say that the second
part of my plan—getting your attention—has also pro
ven to be rather successful.
However, my modest success in these two not-so
serious endeavors is meaningless unless it has contrib
uted toward helping us become more aware of our
apathetic attitudes and intellectual self-centeredness.
About two years ago, I was very moved by an editorial
written by then-editor of the Daily Sam Howe. In that
article, he talked about how the easy grading policy and
unchallenging attitude toward learning of students at

Stanford ill-prepared us for life after graduation.
In a similar way, I feel that the unwillingness of most
students to make an effort to challenge their views or to
even keep themselves informed in a serious manner on
problems such as the ones affecting East Palo Alto, the
Middle East or Chicanos in this country ill-prepares us to
become responsible citizens.
Are we going to wait until our tax money is being
spent, our gas supplies are running low or our civil rights
are being violated before we can take an active, edu
cated position on a few of these issues?
It takes only a few minutes a day to pick up an editorial
or news page and read it. Thinking about, disagreeing
with and reacting publicly or within our own mind to a
particular column will prepare us for when we are con
fronted with an issue in which we have more at stake
than our credibility, reputation and school work.
