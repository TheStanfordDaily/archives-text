## Plight of working moms 
### 
It is time this administration faced
some of the basic needs of an in
creasing segment of its population.
More and more graduate students
are older today, and therefore many
more have children, and more are
single parents. A large segment of
this population has been constantly
ignored in the past—no health be
nefits, no stipend consideration and
a lack of childcare facilities for chil
dren of working spouses.
This University heavily relies on
the work and research of these stu
dents for its standing, yet it is increas
ingly difficult to live in this area with a
family. Rather than help alleviate that
burden, those with two or more chil
dren will be hit with a whopping 16
percent increase in their rents.
Why is it that this University con
siders it normal that such a large bur
den for this extended period of edu
cation be placed on the spouse's
shoulders: financial, childcare,
fund-raising for the day-care
facilities, without any access to Uni
versity funding for any of these
needs?
I, personally, have spent months
organizing an event for the childcare
scholarship fund that brought in
$800, and one might think that the
University could at least adopt a pol
icy of matching these funds raised by
volunteers spending hours away
from their families, working with
bare essentials, when it is truly in the

University's best interest to under
stand and come to terms with these
very basic student needs.
I simply cannot understand the
discrepancy in priorities that gives
such things as the pavingofthe Quad
class A status and children and their
needs none at all. I cannot come to
terms with the so-called "thinking"
man and woman's lack of sensitivity
to what must be one of the most es
sential and fundamental needsof the
human race, i.e., replenishing itself.
When will we stop to look at the
causes of the degeneracy of the
species rather that its effects. If we
stopped to consider, rather, how we
raise our children and the priorities
accorded their growth and well
being in this society rather than the
sinister aftermath of neglect, then
perhaps we could begin to com
prehend how structures that stress
monetary success "über alles" lead
to our downfall as a race.
But these considerations I'll leave
to the intellectuals of this campus;
what I would like to stress here is that
something constructive must be
done, that priorities must be rear
ranged so that our children are no
longer neglected and that this admin
istration come to terms with its
necessary commitment to the well
being of this ever-increasing seg
ment of its population.
