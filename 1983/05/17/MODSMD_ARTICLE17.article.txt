## Hoover inquiry would benefit all 
### 
As concerned Stanford students,
we are distressed by the current de
bate about the status of the Hoover
Institution. The Institution, founded
in a democracy, should protect
democratic ideals; the pursuit of
knowledge, the value of question
ing, and the right to pursue inde
pendent study.
For the better part of a month, the
Institution has resisted an indepen
dent study on its relationship with
Stanford University. Its defense has
been that an independent study is
not necessary and would interfere
with its scholars' rights to engage in
their own studies. Inquiries into the
nature of study at Hoover are called,
in W. Glenn Campbell's words
"character assassinations." An in
stitution which is dedicated to the
democratic tradition has denied
others' rights to question in the
name of democratic ideals. These
questions about the academic free
dom of both the Hoover Institution
and Stanford University should not
be confused with a "witch hunt."

It is our desire to see both sides
engage in dialogue of study and dis
closure that would benefit the
Hoover Institution, the student
body, and the University. When fac
ing such collegiate concerns, W.
Glenn Campbell should recall Adlai
Stevenson's words, "It is often easier
to fight for one's principles than live
up to them.

The recent Pete McCloskey affair
has caused me to begin an active
search for an answer to a question
that has bothered me for a long time.
Is it possible to make any statement
critical of Israel and/or Jews without
being smeared with the epithet
"anti-Semite'' or "anti-Semitic"? I
have seen these terms applied to

people who have made the most in
ocuous and factual statements and
now I am ready to adopt McCloskey's
idea of "reverse anti-Semitism."
Have we come to the point that Israel
and the Jews are beyond or above
criticism? I haven't reached that
point yet. In fact, I think I'll put out a
few feelers.
First, aren't Arabs and Palestinians
Semitic? I believe they are. Ergo: Any
anti-Semitic remark applies to Arabs
as well as Jews, am I right?
Second: In 1946 Menachem Begin,
the most vicious of living terrorists,
blew up the King David Hotel in
Palestine, causing the death of 70
people and still the worst example of
terrorism in the war for Palestine. Is
there some relation to this and the
bombing of the American Embassy in
Beirut? What was the motive for this?
Who planned to benefit and why?
These questions have not been an
swered and I plan to make an effort in
this direction.
