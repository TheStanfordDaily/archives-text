"What kills me is that we practi
cally invented popular revolution yet
we seem to be opposed to it taking
place anywhere else."
—Edward Asner
Throughout your many truly in
formative articles on El Salvador, as
throughout the wider media, the
same naive American world view
trips over the same blind mistake.
That mistake was explained best by
Daniel Ellsberg in reference to the
Vietnam War: "We weren't backing
the wrong side, we were the wrong
side."
To cite the atrocities of the "out
of-hand" militaries of Guatemala, El
Salvador, Chile, etc. conducted
against the poor masses of these na
tions as "violations" of U.S. foreign
policy, (or human rights) goals is to
misunderstand entirely. They are the
U.S. foreign policy. When Stanford
student Phillip Bourgeois is shot at
along with countless 112 leeing Salvado
ran peasants by U.S. army-issue guns
from U.S. army-issue helicopters by
soldiers trained in the United States
at Fort Bragg, all of this at U.S. ex
pense and coordinated by U.S. ad
visors (officers), how can one con
tinue to sincerely believe that the
U.S. government is an independent,
third, aid-giving party?
It is no understatement to note
that the United States can make or
break the majoring of Third World
governments. Indeed, in many Latin
American countries, as in the Philip
pines and previously, South Viet
nam, the United States is the gov
ernment. Even the long democratic
tradition of Chile was sacrificed to
Nixon and the CIA in the interest of
protecting U.S. investments there.
Another naive understatement is
that the current administration is le
nient with the military forces in
Guatemala and El Salvador, defend
ing the veneer of democracy in El
Salvador and the perpetual procras
tination of any significant local land
reform. In fact, the Reagan adminis
tration despises the rural popula
tions at least as much as Roberto
D'Aubuisson and Rio Montt. We are
talking here about indigenous,
idealistic, freedom-loving Roman
Catholics who are fighting to protect
their lands and families from the
machinations of foreign capital and
export-cropping.
Not once in 20 years has President
Reagan credited the deadly struggles
of these poor, sincere people as any
thing less than an evil global conspi
racy against the United States. Since
taking office, this administration h&s
taken every advantage to support
and promote the obliteration of
these rural populations, including
the current, unprecendentedly-high
military aid packages.

One of Stanford's overseas aid or
ganizations, Relay, has recently
adopted a program of medical aid to
FMLN guerilla-controlled areas of El
Salvador. Along with other genuinely
productive Third World projects,
Relay will be raising funds this sum
mer for the poor in El Salvador and
refugees who have fled the war to
Costa Rica. Over and above personal
contributions toward relief and re
construction (of such U.S.-financed
devestations as Beirut, East Timor,
Somalia, etc.), the American people
need to exert an intense outrage on a
presidential foreign policy gone
amok.
We must immediately acknowl
edge that we, as an electorate, are
responsible for the human rights at
rocities in El Salvador from which our
ignorance and del usions-of
stabilizing-intervention will not ex

cuse us. In short, as so many Slate
Department officials reiterate: The
United States cannot stop funding
the Salvadoran war effort without
conceding an end to that war.
Clearly, the current regime cannot
survive there without strong U.S.
presence.
Are we such hypocrites that we
cannot aknowledge that America,
too, fought a vicious, insurgent war
against the political control by
foreign capital of a leading democ
racy perceiving us as a bulwark
against its global enemies?
As Henry David Thoreau spoke,
"Yes sir! That's revolution. What do
you think happened at Concord
bridge? A prayer meeting?"

ton who used to teach at Stanford on
World Hunger.)

ganizations, Relay, has recently
adopted a program of medical aid to
FMLN guerilla-controlled areas of El
Salvador. Along with other genuinely
productive Third World projects,
Relay will be raising funds this sum
mer for the poor in El Salvador and
refugees who have fled the war to
Costa Rica. Over and above personal
contributions toward relief and re
construction (of such U.S.-financed
devestations as Beirut, East Timor,
Somalia, etc.), the American people
need to exert an intense outrage on a
presidential foreign policy gone
amok.
We must immediately acknowl
edge that we, as an electorate, are
responsible for the human rights at
rocities in El Salvador from which our
ignorance and del usions-of
stabilizing-intervention will not ex

cuse us. In short, as so many Slate
Department officials reiterate: The
United States cannot stop funding
the Salvadoran war effort without
conceding an end to that war.
Clearly, the current regime cannot
survive there without strong U.S.
presence.
Are we such hypocrites that we
cannot aknowledge that America,
too, fought a vicious, insurgent war
against the political control by
foreign capital of a leading democ
racy perceiving us as a bulwark
against its global enemies?
As Henry David Thoreau spoke,
"Yes sir! That's revolution. What do
you think happened at Concord
bridge? A prayer meeting?"
