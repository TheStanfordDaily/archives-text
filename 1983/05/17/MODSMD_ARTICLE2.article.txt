# Physicists call for Soviets to release Sakharov

### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
Eight prominent physicists and arms control experts,
including Sidney Drell, deputy director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, released a statement yester
day asking the Soviet government to allow dissident
physicist Andrei Sakharov to emigrate to the West.
Drell and his colleagues deny Soviet claims that
Sakharov knows classified information stemming from
his previous work in arms research. According to the
statement, Sakharov has been away from weapons re
search long enough for him to have no crucial state
secrets.
"Based on our experience and our understanding that
Sakharov has had no involvement in Soviet weapons
programs for more than 15 years, we can neither under
stand nor accept the validity of the Soviet statement,"
the eight said.
According to Luis Alvarez, professor emeritus of
physics at UC-Berkeley who signed the statement,
weapons research advances so quickly that someone
involved 15 years ago would have no knowledge of the
state of the science now.
"I've been out of the field for 30 years. I had a chance
recently to visit Los Alamos, and I didn't have any idea
about what was going on. I wouldn't have been able to
tell anyone anything," Alvarez said.
Drell said the purpose of the scientists' statement is to
tell the Soviets that they are detaining Sakharov for "an
unacceptable reason."

"We're trying to create the case for Sakharov to be
allowed to come to the West. The particular argument
that has been given by the Soviet Union is one we reject.
It's a matter of making a statement that their's is not a
credible statement," Drell said.
William Perry, a lecturer in the Arms Control and Dis
armament Program here, signed the statement because
he is "not convinced with the reasons the Soviets gave.
Sakharov has been separated from classified informa
tion for 15 years. I think a statement by a non
government group could provide some psychological
pressure on the Soviet government, not very strong to
be sure, but any small gesture that could tip the balance
is worth the effort."
Drell said he believes the Kremlin has yet to make a
final decision on Sakharov's fate.
"The issue is not resolved," Drell said. ". . . .the an
nouncement (that Sakharov would not be allowed to
emigrate) was only an unsigned statement in Tass (the
official Soviet news agency) and it wasn't from a high
official. From that, one can figure that it's not a final
decision."
According to an Associated Press report, Sakharov's
wife, Velena Bonner, said Wednesday that Sakharov was
ready and willing to leave the Soviet Union. When a
reporter handed her the official announcement that her
husband would not be allowed to leave the country,
Bonner said that she feared for her husband's life.
