## A 						splendid, uplifting view of the 'Flight of the Eagle' 
### 
By STEVE VINEBERG
In the early '70s, the Swedish
director Jan Troell brought out
his great two-part epic, The
Emigrants and The New Land,
about the journey of a family of
Swedes to this country in the
middle of the last century.
Peculiarly, these pictures are
seldom revived now, but those
of us who saw them on their
initial release have never for
gotten their astonishing sweep
or Troell's painterly command
of visual detail — or the super
bly modulated performances
he drew from Max von Sydow
and Liv Ullmann in the central
roles.
But having completed this
overwhelming project, on
which he had served as photo
grapher, editor and co-writer
as well as director, Troell
began to disappear from the
film world.
In Hollywood, Troell was not
permitted to act as his own
one-man film crew — others
shot and cut his pictures — and
that may go a long way toward
explaining the virtual eclipse of
his genius in America. On The
Flight of the Eagle, he is once
more cinematographer and
editor, and he worked on the
script, too, which was derived
from the true story of a tragic
Arctic expedition by a trio of
Swedes in 1897. (Troell, Ceorg
Oddner, lan Rakoff and Klaus
Rifberg based their screenplay
on Per Olof Sundman's book.)
And though the movie is on a
much smaller scale than The
Emigrants and The New Land,
you can see that the same man
made them all. Troell must
have looked on the story, more
than half of which takes place
in the far north with a cast of
three (Max von Sydow, Sverre
Anker Ousdal and Goran
Stangertz), as a challenge to his
ingenuity: he employs a variety
of visual styles, and his im
maculate camerawork is end
lessly inventive. He creates a
symphony out of the inflation
of the balloon that will carry
.the explorers across the Arctic
Sea — it becomes a fourth pro
tagonist in the movie, and is
shot so expressively, in so
many stages and from so many
angles, that you can't imagine
another filmmaker getting
more artistic mileage out of it.
(Think of what he could have
done with that ship in Fitzcar
raldo.)
Troell comes very close to
his three heroes in the course
of their physical disintegration
during this expedition (all
three become pockmarked by

the cold, and they contract a
number of ailments), but he
never invades them; he has the
respect of a 19th-century
painter for the integrity of his
subjects. Max von Sydow's
performance is corre
spondingly delicately
nuanced, so that the strength
of this not-terribly-likable man,
Salomon Andree, whose ego
and prideful ambition seem in
extricably bound up with his
patriotism, who is enamored of
civilization's delights yet can
live in almost total deprivation,
remains something of a mys
tery. It's a beautifully re
strained piece of acting — as
the weeks go by, Andree, clad
in black, grows to look more
and more like a Calvinist minis
ter and his scientific detach
ment infuriates us as much as it
does his humanistic compan
ion, Knut Fraenkel (Sverre
Anker Qusdal). Then, when
the third member of their
party, Nils Strindberg (Goran
Stangertz), drowns and Fraen
kel blames Andree, Sydow al
lows Andree's shell to cave in
and we see him confronting his
emotions for the first time. The
spectacle is a glorious one.
The Flight of the Eagle has an
unusual texture, and some of
the scenes in it are moving in
ways just as mysterious as An
dree's personality. When the
balloon has been inflated, the
crew of the ship that has car
ried the explorers as far as the
Arctic Sea, and the employees
of the manufacturer,
Lachambre (the cherubic Cle
ment Harari), tear down the
structure that has housed it
and celebrate: Lachambre is
carried down to the beach on a
board, decked out as Mere Bal
lon, and Nils plays the violin.
It's a party scene, but so
touched with sadness —
perhaps because of the plain
tive music (Hans Erik Philip
wrote the accomplished score)
and the palpable snap of the
northern air — that it feels like
a mourning ceremony. (It re
minds me of another sad cele
bration: the moment in Robert
Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Mil
ler when a fiddler accompanies
a mud dancer in the damp,
dirty streets of that half-born
western town.)
But the way in which Troell
angles almost every scene to
ward the inevitable death of
the three men diminishes the
emotional scope of the pic
ture. The opening photo
graphs predict the end for us,
and the dialogue is heavily
ironic, reminding us that the

deflated balloon looks like a
corpse when we can see that
perfectly well, and emphasiz
ing the men's solitude and iso
lation needlessly by having Nils
write letters to his fiancee that
we know he cannot mail.
All of Troell's virtuosity — his
use of motifs (the shape of the
balloon is echoed in the billow
ing Arctic waves and in a
flashback set on a circular,
snow-lined stone mound), his
superb rendering of claus
trophobia and immense space,
the purity of his photographc
vision — serves to reinforce
the depressing tone he sets in
the first few minutes. The
Flight of the Eagle is a magnifi
cent movie, but it's relentless.
Bruce Beresford, the di
rector of Tender Mercies, and
Horton Foote, its screenwriter,
engage in a less rewarding
variety of relentlessness. From
the opening moments of the
picture, when Rosa Lee (Tess
Harper), a young widow who
runs a motel/gas station in rural
Texas, and her son Sonny (Al
lan Hubbard), overhear a
drunken fit by one-time coun
try music star Mac Sledge
(Robert Duvall), we can see
that the filmmakers are striving
for gritty realism in a muted,
allusive style. But the spare,
banal dialogue is so strategi
cally planted that there seem to
be arrows pointed at every
word — and the words aren't
worth listening for. Except for
Betty Buckley (as Mac's ex
wife, who looks like a
pinched-faced Susan Anspach
and sings in a reedy, zinging
vibrato) and Ellen Barkin (as
their discontented daughter),
the actors fix flat, impassive
stares on the camera that,
though clearly intended to
speak volumes, are pretty
much tabulae rasae on which
any reasonable emotional in
terpretation can be written. So
there's nothing much worth
watching, either, except for
Russell Boyd's handsome
nighttime exteriors. A number
of critics have been impressed
by the phony, vacant natu
ralism of the acting and the
writing, and Beresford may ac
tually believe he's modeled
these tough-jawed southwes
ternerson Walker Evans's pho
tographs. But I couldn't keep
my mind off all the country
western movies I had enjoyed
immeasurably more — not just
Nashville, but also Payday and
even the trivial romance Hon
eysuckle Rose. Tender Mer
cies, lean and solemn, is actu
ally a non-movie.
