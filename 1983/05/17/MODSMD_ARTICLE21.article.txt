# Gags and glitter: a 'Once in a Lifetime' experience
## 
### MARINA PICCIOTTO 
In the 1920s a new phenomenon hit Hol
lywood. The talkies were invented and Al
Jolson's The jazz Singer ushered in a transi
tion between silent pictures and talkies that
was filled with confusion and mayhem.
Once in a Lifetime, by George Kaufman and
Moss Hart, directed by Steve Vineberg, is set
during this time and is the story of how a
second-rate vaudeville trio down on their
luck travel to Hollywood to take advantage
of the chaos and make their fortune. The
play is very funny and is at its best when the
dialogue does its fast-paced, witty, crazy
kind of thing.
On the whole the script is excellent. Most
of the play is brief, almost slapstick encoun
ters between the vaudevilleans and the crazy
Hollywoodites. Unfortunately, the second
act, set in the main office of the Glagauer
Studios, doesn't have theenergy to carry off
the humor. Many of the clever lines fall flat
because the pace of the play is too slow.
In addition, there is also a somewhate sen
timental scene in the second act where May
Daniels (Christine Roum) and lerry Hyland
(Sean Laughlin), two members of the vau
deville trio, have a confrontation about how
Hollywood has changed lerry. The play is
designed as a light satire and when it tries to
inject real emotion it fails. The actors do
their best with this comfortable scene, but
the sentiment does not work.
Also in this act, however, are several of the
most wonderful characters in the play.
Lawrence Vail, (Stephen Weeks), the playw

right who goes insane from inactivity, kam
merling (Graham Winton), the blustering
German director imported to improve
American pictures, and Glogauer (Laurence
Maslon), the belabored studio head are
crowd-pleasing characters. They are all un
abashed caricatures rather than deep real
characters which therefore entitles them to
the funniest lines and the broadest slapstick
humor. Most of the Hollywood characters
are invented along these lines and provide
the best moments of the play.

'Once in a Lifetime' is the
story of how a second-rate
vaudeville trio down on their
luck travel to Hollywood to
take advantage of the chaos
and make their fortune.

The main characters were well cast. Christ
ine Roum as the cynical wise-cracking May
Daniels and Tom Lindbladeas George Lewis,
the lovable dumb vaudeville partner who be
comes the top man at Glagauer Studios,
were especially good. On the whole, the
acting was very good. One problem, how
ever, was that the characterization of Miss
Leighton (Macall Dunahee), the secretary of
Glogauer Studios and one of the main
characters in Act 11, was languid and un
energetic. A little more energy from Miss

Leighton could have increased the pace of
the act and improved it.
The play was well-staged although the first
scene of Act 111 was slightly awkward. The
scene was the set of a movie. Actor sitting in
the audience, moved about the theater and
generally involved the audience in the ac
tion. Although this added interest, the play
works best exactly because the audience is
removed from the unrealistic, crazy situa
tion and can laugh at its silliness. As a result,
involving the audience in the scene was
somewhat uncomfortable. The rest of the
staging was very effective and helped keep
the individual bits of dialogue from becom
ing too discontinuous.
The sets, designed by Wendell Cole, en
hanced the performance. The studio's office
and the Gold Room of the Hotel Stilton were
properly sumptuous without being distract
ing, and the use of staircases and platforms
to create different levels was very effective.
Also an attractive edition, were the cos
tumes of the Hollywood characters, espe
cially the gaudy creations worn by the gossip
columnist Helen Hobart (Celia Maurice).
Another excellent touch was the use of
filmed opening credits which introduced
the audience to the main characters and set
the scene and the tone for the rest of the
play.
Although there were a few minor prob
lems the audience laughed through most of
the play and came away feeling cheered. The
director, cast and crew did justice to Kauf
man and Hart's fine play.

Lawrence Vail, (Stephen Weeks), the playw

right who goes insane from inactivity, kam
merling (Graham Winton), the blustering
German director imported to improve
American pictures, and Glogauer (Laurence
Maslon), the belabored studio head are
crowd-pleasing characters. They are all un
abashed caricatures rather than deep real
characters which therefore entitles them to
the funniest lines and the broadest slapstick
humor. Most of the Hollywood characters
are invented along these lines and provide
the best moments of the play.

'Once in a Lifetime' is the
story of how a second-rate
vaudeville trio down on their
luck travel to Hollywood to
take advantage of the chaos
and make their fortune.

The main characters were well cast. Christ
ine Roum as the cynical wise-cracking May
Daniels and Tom Lindbladeas George Lewis,
the lovable dumb vaudeville partner who be
comes the top man at Glagauer Studios,
were especially good. On the whole, the
acting was very good. One problem, how
ever, was that the characterization of Miss
Leighton (Macall Dunahee), the secretary of
Glogauer Studios and one of the main
characters in Act 11, was languid and un
energetic. A little more energy from Miss

Leighton could have increased the pace of
the act and improved it.
The play was well-staged although the first
scene of Act 111 was slightly awkward. The
scene was the set of a movie. Actor sitting in
the audience, moved about the theater and
generally involved the audience in the ac
tion. Although this added interest, the play
works best exactly because the audience is
removed from the unrealistic, crazy situa
tion and can laugh at its silliness. As a result,
involving the audience in the scene was
somewhat uncomfortable. The rest of the
staging was very effective and helped keep
the individual bits of dialogue from becom
ing too discontinuous.
The sets, designed by Wendell Cole, en
hanced the performance. The studio's office
and the Gold Room of the Hotel Stilton were
properly sumptuous without being distract
ing, and the use of staircases and platforms
to create different levels was very effective.
Also an attractive edition, were the cos
tumes of the Hollywood characters, espe
cially the gaudy creations worn by the gossip
columnist Helen Hobart (Celia Maurice).
Another excellent touch was the use of
filmed opening credits which introduced
the audience to the main characters and set
the scene and the tone for the rest of the
play.
Although there were a few minor prob
lems the audience laughed through most of
the play and came away feeling cheered. The
director, cast and crew did justice to Kauf
man and Hart's fine play.
