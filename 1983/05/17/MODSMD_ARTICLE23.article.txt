# Card netmen squeeze past USC in third set tie-breaker to win 5-4
## 
### TOM MOORE 
Before an approving
crowd in Athens, Ga. yester
day, the Cardinal No. 2 dou
bles team of Mark Mckeen
and Jim Grabb staged a
dramatic come from behind
victory against USC to push
Stanford into the NCAA fi
nals. Behind 5-4 in the third
set to USC's Anton Emerson
and Matt Anger, the
McKeen/Grabb duo broke
service to tie the set at 5-5,
forced a tiebreaker at six
games each, and ultimately
clinched the Card victory
with fine net play.
"It was pretty scary out
there for a while," said
coach Dick Gould after the
match, "but they came
through with a great job in
the tiebreaker." The crucial
contest took nearly 5V2
hours to complete. McKeen
and Grabb escaped with a
6-7, 7-6, 7-6 (tiebreaker 7-5)
victory.
Earlier in the match, the
Card had continued the
strong singles play that has
carried them throughout
the tourney, taking a 4-2
team advantage into the
doubles play. Though
USC's Todd Witken swiftly
defeated John Letts at the
No. 2 positions 6-2, 6-2,
Cardinal ace Scott Davis
demolished Matt Anger 6-1,
6-3 to even the slate. Dan
Goldie turned in his usual
solid performance, beating
Tim Pawset 6-3, 6-4; Eric
Rosenfeld held off Anton
Emerson 6-4, 4-6, 6-4; and
captain Mark McKeen used
a sharp serve and volley at
tack to defeat Jorge Lozano
6-1, 7-6. At No. 6, however,
Trojan Rick Bengston snap

ped Jim Grabb's singles
winning streak at 22
matches, pulling out a 6-3,
4-6, 6-4 win.
In doubles, needing only
one victory to gain the fi
nals, the Cards' momentum
slowed down. The fourth
seeded Trojan duo of
Lozano/Pawset upset the

top seeded Davis/I.etts team
6-4, 3-6, 6-1 and at No. 3
doubles, USC's
Bengston/Witken defeated
Rosenfeld/Goldie in two
sets (7-6, 6-4) to tie the
match at 4-4 and set the
scene for the thrilling finale.
In the other semifinal
match, top seeded SMU

ripped Pepperdine 5-1 to
advance to the champion
ship match. Second seeded
Stanford has not played
SMU this year. "They are a
good, strong team," said
Gould of the Mustangs. "It
should be an excellent
matchup." The finals will be
held this afternoon.
