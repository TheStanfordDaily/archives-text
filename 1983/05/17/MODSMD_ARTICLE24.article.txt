## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Albuquerque, N.M. — The
Stanford women's tennis team
dug itself another hole yester
day at the NCAA champion
ships here and this time- it didn't
get out.
Playing just 15 hours after de
feating San Diego State in a
grueling, six-hour quarter final
match 5-4, a tired Cardinal
squad was simply overpowered
by No. 1 seeded and unde
feated USC 8-1.
The Trojans meet No. 2 seed
Trinity (of Texas), who beat
UCLA yesterday 7-2 in today's
final at 11 a.m while Stanford
and the Bruins lace off for third
place in the consolation finals at
9 a.m.
"It's very difficult to come
back," said Cardinal coach

Frank Brennan. "After a physi
callv and emotionally draining
match like we played yesterday
(against San Diego State) and
beat a team like USC — a team
we've never beaten.
Against the Aztecs Sunday
Stanford found itself behind
6-4, 3-0 at No. 1 doubles with
the team score tied at 4-4.
But the Card duo of Elise Bur
gin and Linda Gates staged a
brilliant comeback to win the
second set 6-4 and then the
third set as well.
Stanford was in a similar situ
ation yesterday and, for a short
while, appeared poised to do it
again.
The Trojans jumped to an
early 3-0 lead in the singles be
fore Michelle Weiss — the only
Card netter still undefeated in

singles play at the NCAAs — re
corded a -6 (7-3), 6-1 victory at
No. r >.
That cut USC's advantage to
3-1, with Burgin's No. 1 match
with Beth Herr and Alyce Wer
del's No. 5 contest against
Cecillia Fernandez still in prog
ress.
Both Burgin and Werdel had
lost first sets but both prevailed
in the second and the momen
tum seemed to be shifting their
way.
But there the rally stopped,
and Stanford was history before
the doubles had even started.
Today's match against UCLA
will be a chance for Brennan
and Company to get revenge
for the 7-2 shellacking they re
ceived in Los Anceles.
