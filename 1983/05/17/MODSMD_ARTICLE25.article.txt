## 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
The National Collegiate Athletic Association
announced yesterday that Sunken Diamond,
home of 6-Pac Conference champion Stanford,
will be the site of the Western Region I baseball
tournament May 27-31.
Arizona State, which placed second behind
Stanford, will host the Western Region II tour
nament at Packer Stadium in Tempe, Ariz., ac
cording to Jerry Miles, director of men's cham
pionships for the NCAA.
Only four of the eight region tournament sites
have been finalized, Miles told the Daily by
telephone. The University of North Carolina will
host the Eastern Region and Florida State Uni
versity will host the Southern Region.
The University of Michigan will host the Mid-
Eastern region if they win the Big-10Tournament
this weekend, Miles saiii, but if Michigan loses,
the committee will "go back to the drawing
board on a conference call this weekend."
The University of Maine will host the North
eastern region if they win the Eastern College
Athletic Conference, Section I, tournament this
weekend. If not, Delaware will get the tourna
ment.
The Central and Midwestern Regions "are still
up in the air," Miles said.

"We're going to wait and see on the others,"
Miles said. "We've received a lot of good propo
sals from the teams."
Miles said more regions may be finalized
Thursday when it's more clear which teams will
qualify for the tournament.
Stanford and Arizona State are automatic
qualifiers through their conference finishes, but
tournaments are still in progress in the Big Eight,
Southeastern and Southwestern conferences.
Stanford coach Mark Marquess said Sunday
that hosting a tournament is an advantage, but
it's not a guarantee that the Cardinal will make
its second straight appearance in the World
Series after not reaching the playoffs for 13
years.
"It really helps because you're sleeping in the
same bed and eating the same meals and the
home crowd always helps," Marquess said. "But
it can be deceiving. Arizona State and Fresno
State hosted tournaments last year and neither
one of them made it.
The region tournaments are double elimina
tion. Two games will be played on each of the
first three days — May 26, 27 and 28 — and the
championship, if necessary, will be played on
Monday, May 30.
The teams, pairings and times have not been
announced.
