Summer daze
Bored of sitting in sun? Take a few
minutes off to "be true to your
school"—and your newspaper—and
write for the Summer Visitor's
Guide. All stories can be written be
fore you leave for vacation, so go for
it. Talk to Tim (that's Grieve—just like
you're sad) if you'd like to help out.
Return to school
When you return to school in Sep
tember, you'll be itching to come
back to the Daily. Today through Fri
day, Kristen Christopher and
Heather Millar, who will be manag
ing editor along with Adam Good
man, will be meeting with anyone

who has done anything for the paper
to discuss next volume. Sign-up on
the door inside the office.
Staff lunch
Have you ever wondered what
happens to old Daily department
editors? Come to the staff lunch this
Thursday with Larry Liebert, now a
political reporter for the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, and find out.
Food for thought
Tastier than munchies, more pow
erful than air-popped corn, better
even than a Safeway staff lunch — it's
the upcoming Daily banquet at
Ming's on Monday, May 30. Sign up
as soon as possible.
