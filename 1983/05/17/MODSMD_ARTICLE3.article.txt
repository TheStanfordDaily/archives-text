No one can disagree that infla
tion in the United States has de
clined in recent months. But with
presidential campaigns already
under way, the question of who
controls economic boom or bust
becomes increasingly important.
Economics Prof. )ohn Shoven
said that while President Reagan
played an active role in curbing
inflation, the "major player" in
economic improvement was the
Federal Reserve System.
"It's a matter of political sci
ence," Shoven said. "The Federal
Reserve was tight; it eased up last
August. If you believe the Federal

Reserve is under his (Reagan's)
control, then you believe that Re
agan was responsible."
According to Shoven, the Fed
eral Reserve had been mainly
concerned with bringing about a
recession through inflation.
"They blinked in August," he
said, "they saw that the economy
was very weak . . .realized that
they might have an actual depres
sion on their hands instead of a
recession."
The Federal Reserve also
realized that inflation might "go
out of control on the downsw
ing," Shoven said.


John Shoven
Charles Schultze, chairman of the
council for economic advisors dur
ing the Carter administration and
designated "distinguished guest" at
the Graduate School of Business,
said it was "partly true" that the Fed
eral Reserve had curbed inflation,
but that Reagan had been a major
influence.
"They did roughly what he
wanted," Schultze said.
Shoven said Reagan himself had
done several things to augment the
economy. "His policies were fairly
stimulative," he said. "He spent a lot
of money." Increased defense
spending, he said, may not ideologi
cally appealing but it does stimulate
the economy.

"Whether you like battleships or
not, he said, it's an expansionary
thing," Shoven said. He added that it
was "very difficult to be intelligent"
about defense spending because of
the complexity of the issue.
"When you don't know how to as
sess the dangers faced, and the level
of weaponry that you're debating
about, you can't possibly know all
the issues involved," Shoven said.
Aside from policy, Shoven said he
felt Reagan had surrounded himself
with competent advisors. "I don't
know what his (Reagan's) economic
intelligence is," Shoven said, "but
his advisors are good. . . .they are
conservative, but they're sensible.
There are no Watts among his
economists."
Schultze said the negative side of
Reagan's economic policy was in
creased unemployment. "There's no

such thing as a free lunch," he said.
"We had to pay a price for decreased
inflation; perhaps this is higher than
what we should pay."
Overall, Shoven said that Reagan's
role in boosting the economy had
been "about average" for a presi
dent. Whether or not Reagan's con
tributions to the economy were
timed for the upcoming election is
another question.
"Any administration likes the eco
nomic situation to look good around
election time," Shoven said. "You
give out your bitter pills as soon as
you are elected."
Schultze said there was no way Re
agan could have timed economic
improvement. "Nobody can do
that," he said. "Reagan came into of
fice wanting to have his cake and eat
it too; now things are working out."
