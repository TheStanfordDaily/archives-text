No one can disagree that infla
tion in the United States has de
clined in recent months. But with
presidential campaigns already
under way, the question of who
controls economic boom or bust
becomes increasingly important.
Economics Prof. )ohn Shoven
said that while President Reagan
played an active role in curbing
inflation, the "major player" in
economic improvement was the
Federal Reserve System.
"It's a matter of political sci
ence," Shoven said. "The Federal
Reserve was tight; it eased up last
August. If you believe the Federal

Reserve is under his (Reagan's)
control, then you believe that Re
agan was responsible."
According to Shoven, the Fed
eral Reserve had been mainly
concerned with bringing about a
recession through inflation.
"They blinked in August," he
said, "they saw that the economy
was very weak . . .realized that
they might have an actual depres
sion on their hands instead of a
recession."
The Federal Reserve also
realized that inflation might "go
out of control on the downsw
ing," Shoven said.
