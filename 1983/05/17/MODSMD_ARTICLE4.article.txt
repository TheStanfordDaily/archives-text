# University names Public Affairs VP
## 
### SID ATKINS Senior staff writer 
Robert Freelen has officially been
named vice-president for Public Af
fairs, University President Donald
Kennedy announced yesterday, end
ing a three-month search.
Freelen was formerly associate
vice-president for Public Affairs, and
has been acting vice-president since
February, when Robert Rosenzweig
heft for Washington to become pres
ident of the American Association of
Universities. Freelen received both
his bachelor's in Political Science and
M.B.A. from Stanford.
In making the appointment, Ken
nedy cited breadth of experience
along with organizational and lead
ership ability as reasons for choosing
Freelen. Kennedy said, "Stanford's
public affairs will be in good hands.
He is deeply knowledgeable about
public policy in the areas important
to us."
Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost
and dean of graduate studies, was in
charge of the committee which rec
ommended candidates to Kennedy.
He said Freelen enjoys very high na
tional stature. "I spoke with his col
leagues at other institutions and they
all said 'you've got the best guy there
(at Stanford).' "
In the vice-president's position,
Freelen, 49, will be in charge of fed
eral, state and local government rela
tions, news and publications, events
and services, and the guide service.
Larry Horton will take over as act
ing associate vice-president, until
Freelen appoints someone perma
nently to the position. "This won't
happen for a while," Freelen said.
Freelen said he heard about the
appointment last Thursday and was
somewhat surprised. "At a place like
Stanford with so many qualified
people around, you can never be too
sure," he said.
Freelen said he felt "terrific" after
bi4**rinfi */"»«■» o#' r /.» p.
"I'm really looking forward to it. I
think it will be fun."
The process of choosing a new
vice-president took more than three
months, an unusually long time, but
Lieberman said this had nothing to
do with the candidates themselves.
Rather, he attributed the delay to or
ganizational hassles. "Trying to get a
group of busy faculty members into
the same room at the same time is
virtually impossible," he said.
Lieberman said his committee did
present more than one name to Ken
nedy. "We looked at other people
who were all very talented, but they
weren't as good as Bob."
Freelen said he plans to spend
more time talking with the individual
managers in public affairs about the
future of the office and other issues.
He also said he intends to set up a
"visiting committee" of outside ex
perts which will provide feedback on
how well the Office of Public Affairs
is working.

"This would be a group of five or
six experts who would once a year or
so look at everything we do — gov
ernment relations, cultural pro
gramming, press relations, etc.,"
Freelen said.
Freelen said he did not know
exactly what the University will be
lobbying for in the upcoming year,
but cited indirect cost recovery, stu
dent aid and more tax policy debates
as persistent issues on the national
level.
On the local scene, where Freelen
says he will be spending more timeas
vice-president, he said, "It's hard to
imagine that the use-of-animals-in
laboratory-research problem will
disappear."
"Don't forget that 1984 is an elec
tion year too . . . there will be lots of
issues," Freelen said.

In the public affairs office, director
of University Relations Don Carlson
choice for the job. "He'll do a very
good job. He has exactly the right
background for the position because
he's done a lot of varied things in the
University." Carlson added that
Freelen was former Vice-President
Rosenzweig's choice for the posi
tion.
Carlson said that changes will have
to be made in the office. "We're in
the '80s and Bob will have to make his
own adjustments, but he's equipped
to make these changes," he said.
Carlson said he has known Freelen
since he was president of the student
body here as an undergraduate. He
said, "I think he's a great guy and
everyone else in the office is smiling
from ear to ear today too."
Freelen is the third appointment to
the vice-president level this year. Ear
lier, Industrial Engineering Prof.
Henry Riggs was made vice
president for development and Uni
versity Counsel john Schwartz was
also promoted to vice-president.
