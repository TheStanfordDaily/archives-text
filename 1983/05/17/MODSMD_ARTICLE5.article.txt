# Trustees approve Tower plans

### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
A plan to install a new fire protection system in Hoover
Tower that brought about the year-long closing of the
tower's observation deck has been approved by the
board of trustees.
Construction will begin on the new fire safety system
— which will include the installation of a new sprinkler
system, an alarm system, smoke barriers, emergency
power and water pumps — in August, according to John
Hughes, the assistant to the vice-provost for manage
ment and budget . The tower's platform was closed to
visitors for safety reasons Feb. 12.
The installation of the system will cost $800,000, ac
cording to Hughes. This includes both construction
costs and architectural fees.
Hughes said the board of trustees' approval of the
plan was the second step in the University's project
approval system. Concept approval, the first step, re
sulted in the closing of the platform in February but
project approval, the second step, represents accep
tance of a concrete plan.
Hughes said the University plans to re-open the tower

in March 1984.
The University has been planning a new fire protec
tion system for the building for the last three years. A
state law passed last year mandates stricter fire safety
systems for high-rise buildings.
The observation deck was closed in February because
"the more we thought about the problem the more we
realized that it was a fire hazard," Hughes said.
He said, however, that staff members who work for
the Hoover Library, which is located in the tower, will
still use the building.
More than 40,000 people a year visit the observation
deck of the tower, which is located on the 14th floor of
the building. The Guide and Visitors Service,
which is responsible for leading visitors to the top of the
tower, has reassigned to other duties the 35 student
guides who, previously manned the tower.
Ray Bacchetti, the vice-provost for management and
budgets, said the new fire protection system will be in
stalled because "we're concerned about fire safety."
The hazards of the tower, which was built in 1941, are
exacerbated by "the fact that it's quite tall and enclosed.
You can't bring a hook and ladder to put out fires there."
