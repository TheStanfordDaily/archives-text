Israel, Lebanon near settlement
Jerusalem — The Israeli Parliament yesterday en
dorsed the U.S.-mediated agreement for the with
drawal of foreign forces from Lebanon, clearing the
way for its ratification and the end of a state of war that
has existed between the two countries for 16 years.
The Israeli Cabinet had already approved the
agreement, and the government of Prime Minister
Menachem Begin did not formally need Parliament's
affirmation before signing an accord with a foreign
country. , •
But, with ratification ceremonies scheduled for to
day in Israel and Lebanon, which also approved the
plan yesterday, the parliamentary endorsement rep
resents significant support for the withdrawal agree
ment.

In approving the plan on a 57-6 vote with 47 absten
tions, Parliament did, however, express reservations
about the government's handling of the war with Leb
anon. An eight-hour debate on the plan centered on
the war itself, whether it was justified and what it ac
complished.
"This agreement is the lesser evil and I will not vote
against it," said former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
a member of the opposition Labor Party, which voted
as a bloc to abstain. "But it is an expression of failure, a
failure of concept to which I object.
"That concept is using the Israeli army to achieve
political objectives. No military action can abolish our
Arab terrorists."
The pending ratification in Israel brought neither
celebration nor any great sense of relief. For Syria,
which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley

and on the Lebanon-Syria border, and controls an
other 10,000 Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon, can
sabotage the agreement if it refuses to withdraw. Is
rael has said it would not pull out unless the Syrians
and Palestinians do likewise.
The agreement has not been made public but
copies of the text were obtained yesterday by news
agencies.
Teacher's aide takes hostages
Brentwood, N.Y. — A fired teacher's aide dressed in
fatigues and combat boots barged into a junior high
school classroom yesterday, shot a 9th-grade student
and the principal, and then held 18 terrified students
hostage, releasing them slowly during a nine-hour
siege that ended when he killed himself.

As the last hostage watched, 24-year-old Robert
Wickes turned on himself the same 22-cal. semi
automatic rifle he had fired at the two victims at the
start of the siege at East Junior High School. The gun
man, wounded in the right temple, was taken to
nearby Southside Hospital and pronounced dead at
11:41 p.m. EDT. Police said he pulled the trigger just as
a song he had requested, "Fooling Yourself," was
being played on a radio station, dedicated to his pa
rents and brother.
In the same hospital, the student Wickes had shot
remained in the intensive care unit, suffering from liv
er and kidney damage. The principal, suffering from
facial wounds, was released early in the evening.
None of the hostages, all 9th-grade students, was in
jured.
