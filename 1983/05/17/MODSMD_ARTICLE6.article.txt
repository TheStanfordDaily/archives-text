Israel, Lebanon near settlement
Jerusalem — The Israeli Parliament yesterday en
dorsed the U.S.-mediated agreement for the with
drawal of foreign forces from Lebanon, clearing the
way for its ratification and the end of a state of war that
has existed between the two countries for 16 years.
The Israeli Cabinet had already approved the
agreement, and the government of Prime Minister
Menachem Begin did not formally need Parliament's
affirmation before signing an accord with a foreign
country. , •
But, with ratification ceremonies scheduled for to
day in Israel and Lebanon, which also approved the
plan yesterday, the parliamentary endorsement rep
resents significant support for the withdrawal agree
ment.

In approving the plan on a 57-6 vote with 47 absten
tions, Parliament did, however, express reservations
about the government's handling of the war with Leb
anon. An eight-hour debate on the plan centered on
the war itself, whether it was justified and what it ac
complished.
"This agreement is the lesser evil and I will not vote
against it," said former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
a member of the opposition Labor Party, which voted
as a bloc to abstain. "But it is an expression of failure, a
failure of concept to which I object.
"That concept is using the Israeli army to achieve
political objectives. No military action can abolish our
Arab terrorists."
The pending ratification in Israel brought neither
celebration nor any great sense of relief. For Syria,
which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley

and on the Lebanon-Syria border, and controls an
other 10,000 Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon, can
sabotage the agreement if it refuses to withdraw. Is
rael has said it would not pull out unless the Syrians
and Palestinians do likewise.
The agreement has not been made public but
copies of the text were obtained yesterday by news
agencies.
Teacher's aide takes hostages
Brentwood, N.Y. — A fired teacher's aide dressed in
fatigues and combat boots barged into a junior high
school classroom yesterday, shot a 9th-grade student
and the principal, and then held 18 terrified students
hostage, releasing them slowly during a nine-hour
siege that ended when he killed himself.

As the last hostage watched, 24-year-old Robert
Wickes turned on himself the same 22-cal. semi
automatic rifle he had fired at the two victims at the
start of the siege at East Junior High School. The gun
man, wounded in the right temple, was taken to
nearby Southside Hospital and pronounced dead at
11:41 p.m. EDT. Police said he pulled the trigger just as
a song he had requested, "Fooling Yourself," was
being played on a radio station, dedicated to his pa
rents and brother.
In the same hospital, the student Wickes had shot
remained in the intensive care unit, suffering from liv
er and kidney damage. The principal, suffering from
facial wounds, was released early in the evening.
None of the hostages, all 9th-grade students, was in
jured.
Wickes, of Brentwood, had been fired by Principal
Paul Stephen Howland after getting into a fight with
the wounded student, 15-year-old Louis Burgos, in
the same classroom two weeks ago.
As Wickes talked with police, negotiating the grad
ual release of 17 of the 18 hostages, dozens of police
manned a command post and kept observers away.
Behind the barricades, the crowd cheered each time
students were let go, with teachers and students re
leased by police in small groups and led to waiting
buses, limousines outside school grounds, and in
some cases, to their anxious parents' arms. The
school's nearly 1000 students were escorted from the
building starting at about 2:30 p.m.
Task force urges modernization
Washington — A blue ribbon task force of busi
nessmen and educators urgently recommended yes
terday that President Reagan launch a program to
modernize American industry and to lift the country
out of "our economic malaise."
The object is to make the United States more com
petitive in the rapidly changing global marketplace.
But to achieve that goal, the group said, the United
States will have to develop a consensus and a will to
elevate the worldwide competitive challenge to the
top of the national agenda.
Only the president himself can provide the leader
ship to do that, the Business-Higher Education Forum
said in the 51-page report.
The group of education and businesssuperstars en
gaged in some dramatic rhetoric to emphasize the im
portance it places on its recommendations. "We
stand at the hinge of history," the group said in its
transmittal letter to Reagan.
The Forum, founded in 1978, is composed of the
presidents and chief executive officers of 40 Ameri
can corporations and the presidents and chancellors
of 38 colleges and universities. Its major goal is to
foster cooperation between the corporate and aca
demic worlds.
The 16-member task force which conducted the
study was led by Robert Anderson, chairman and
chief executive officer of Rockwell International
Corp., and David Saxon, president of the University of
California.
In the spring of 1982, Reagan invited the Forum to
explore ways to strengthen the United States' com
petitive position through increased innovation and
productivity. The response focuses on the need for a
national debate and consensus on how to achieve
that. The report is titled "America's Competitive
Challenge: The Need For a National Response."
The report cites one simple set of statistics to high
light the country's declining role in the world busi
ness market: the annual rate of increase in manufac
turing productivity between 1967 and 1980. The rate
for the United States increased by only 3.6 percent,
outdone by every other major western industrial

country: United Kingdom 4.7 percent; Canada and
Germany 5.3 percent; France 6.1 percent; Italy 7.3
percent and Japan 11.4 percent.
In its letter to the president, the forum members
said, "We make one central recommendation: Our
society must develop a consensus that industrial com
petitiveness on a global scale is crucial to our social
and economic well-being.
Eastern jets had failed before
Miami — Engines failed on a dozen Eastern Airlines
jets because of trouble with oil seals, but not until a
jumbo jet nearly ditched in the Atlanticdidthe airline
realize how easily mechanics could overlook the tiny
parts, an Eastern official testified yesterday.
Two months before the near-ditching on May 5, a
foreman warned mechanics in a memo posted at Mi
ami International Airport to be careful because of
rumors that similar problems had caused several oth
er failures.
Kenneth Wilson, Eastern's manager of terminal air
craft maintenance in Miami, told a hearing by Na
tional Transportation Safety Board on yesterday that
there had been 12 engine failures, but the problem
did not come to the attention of Eastern officials be
cause those engine failures were "systemwide" and
not easily traceable.
"Because they were so scattered, most of us weren't
aware of them," Wilson told the NTSB investigators
looking into the power loss in all three engines of an
L-1011 jet during a run from Miami to Nassau,
Bahamas.
"Unfortunately, this incident had to bring it to our
attention," Wilson said. "It's a routine, simple pro
cedure that's done so frequently, I don't think anyone
realized the magnitude of the problem we had."
NTSB officials say all three Rolls Royce RB-211 en
gines on Flight 855 overheated or stalled because oil
seals had not been installed. The plane barely made it
back to Miami, and none of the 172 people aboard
was injured.
Wilson said no Eastern officials were aware of all 12
problems until after that emergency. He said he did
not know how many of the 12 were caused by missing
or leaking seals — known as "O" rings — or improper
ly placed plugs.
The two mechanics blamed for the near-accident
testified that the parts they had been given to install
were marked "serviceable" — ready for use.
Mechanics James Sunbury and Lynn Burris ad
mitted it was their responsibility to verify that "O"
rings were wrapped around plugs fitted into the
plane's engines.
But they said it was too dark to see properly in the
pre-dawn hours when they serviced the jet, and they
had never before received a plug without the rings
from the stock room. Two of the rings fit on each
plug; one plug fits into each of the L-1011's three en
gines.
"I have always received the chip detectors with the
proper number of 'O' rings on them," Sunbury testi

fied. "It is my assumption that when a 'serviceable' tag
is attached to a part, the part is ready to be placed into
service."
S.F. to regulate smoking
San Francisco — The Board of Supervisors, express
ing concern over the hazards of "second-hand
smoke," approved a far-reaching ordinance yester
day regulating tobacco smoking in privateand munic
ipal offices.
The measure, adopted by a vote of 9-2, requires
employers to try to reach a "reasonable accommoda
tion" between the preferences of nonsmoking and
smoking employees. But if nonsmokers are not satis
fied with the resulting policy, the employer must pro
hibit smoking in the office workplace.
The law would be administered by city environ
mental-health inspectors, responding to citizen com
plaints. Civil penalties of up to $500 per day could be
imposed on employers found by a court to be in vio
lation of the ordinance.
"If someone wants to smoke, that's his pre
rogative," Supervisor Wendy Nelder, the sponsor of
the measure, told the board. "But he shouldn't have
the right to impose it on someone else in the office
who doesn't want to risk his health."
Anothersupervisor, Carol Ruth Silver, recalled how
in years past board meetings had been conducted in a
thick haze of cigarette smoke. More recently, she
noted, no-smoking sections had been established in
the meeting room.
"And as I look out now," she said, nodding toward
the audience, the news media section and the super
visors themselves, "I do not see one single person
with a lit cigarette. That means times have changed —
and the city had better catch up."
The ordinance represents a landmark of sorts in
municipal anti-smoking legislation. Until recently,
the emphasis had been on measures to restrict smok
ing in auditoriums, restaurants and other public
places. Now, some cities are turning to the workplace.
The city of San Diego, for example, plans to imple
ment an ordinance next year requiring private em
ployers to establish smoke-free areas for workers "to
the maximum extent possible."
Backers of the San Francisco ordinance are count
ing on good-faith efforts by employers and employ
ees to make the measure effective.
The ordinance has drawn widespread attention
here in recent weeks — but little formal opposition.
British campaign begins
London — A national election campaign that offers
the voters a clear choice of parties with vastly differing
policies began yesterday in Britain. In the style of Brit
ish elections, it will be a whirlwind affair.
wnne u.i. presiaentiat campaigns can last a year or
more, only four weeks will elapse from last Friday's
dissolution of Parliament until the nationwide ballot
ing June 9. The candidates for 650 parliamentary seats

in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
must present their arguments to the estimated 40 mil
lion eligible voters in that time.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher fired the open
ing round in the campaign yesterday with a sharp at
tack on the platform of the opposition Labor Party. In
a television interview, Thatcher said Labor's pledge to
unilaterally scrap Britain's nuclear forcesand increase
government spending by $17 billion the "most ex
treme policy ever put before the electorate."
The Labor Party leaders, at a news conference for
mally issuing their campaign platform, went on the at
tack as well. Deputy leader Denis Healey, pointing to
Britain's 13 percent unemployment, declared: "Mrs.
Thatcher has done more damage to Britain's econo
my than Hitler's bombers."
U.S. gov't to sell rockets
Washington — President Reagan has decided to
rent launching pads and sell government rockets to
private companies to help get commercial space ven
tures off the ground.
The president's directive, announced yesterday,
would allow the private firms to buy parts and govern
ment-owned plans for the rockets at cost, as well as
pay for the use of government launch pads, equip
ment and engineers. The plan does not envision that
entire rockets would be sold.
Delta, Atlas and Titan rockets — called expendable
launch vehicles (ELV) because they can be used only
once — have been sending up government and
private payloads for years. The government decided a
decade ago to phase out these expendable rockets in
favor of reusable space shuttles.
Contracts with the companies building the expen
dable rockets are coming to an end, and the rockets'
launch pads at Cape Canaveral were due to be shut
down. Turning over the older rockets and launch
pads to private companies, would "offer a domestic
Stock market declines
Stock prices lapsed into a broad decline yesterday
after hopes for lower interest rates suffered a setback.
Financial issues that normally respond quickly to
changes in interest-rate expectations posted some of
the day's biggest losses.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 13.84
last week, tumbled 15.77 to 1202.98.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slowed to
a five-week low of 76.25 million shares from 83.11 mil
