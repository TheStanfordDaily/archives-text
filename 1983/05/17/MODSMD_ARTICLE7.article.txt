## Menlo residents protest Stanford West construction 
### TYLER OCHOA 
Make no mistake about it.
Menlo Park residents are upset
about Stanford West.
"I think they (Stanford offi
cials) feel that nobody's going
to be bothered by it except the
people in Menlo, and we don't
give a damn about them," said
Arthur Bolton, a retired factory
consultant.
"When I first heard about
it," Dorothy Bolton, Arthur's
wife said, "I thought, 'Why ha
ven't we heard about this be
fore, and how could it have
gone this far without giving
Menlo a chance to have some
thing to say abouc it?' "
"It's very frustrating," said
Claudette Gregg, a research
psychologist who has become
a vocal opponent of the proj
ect. "I don't think that the
people out there have gotten a
fair view of what's going on."
The Stanford West housing
project consists of 1275 units to
be built on 46 acres north of
Willow Road, directly across
San Francisquito Creek from
Menlo Park, as well as an addi
tional 194 units to be built on
4.3 acres on Welch Road.
It is the larger plot which has
prompted a vigorous protest
from its Menlo Park neighbors.
They are concerned about
many things, including the
proposed density of the proj
ect, traffic problems, air and
noise pollution, environmen
tal damage to the creek and vi
sual intrusion. But most of all,
they are upset about the way
they feel they have been ig
nored and disregarded by Palo
Alto and Stanford officials.
"Menlo Park people were
involved (in the planning pro
cess), but we were not heard,"
Ira Bonde, the former mayor of
Menlo Park, said. "We've re
peatedly been listened to and
nicely dealt with, but that was
the end of it."
A map of the area reveals the
cause of the dispute. Although
the Stanford West site is offi
cially in Palo Alto, it is effec
tively isolated from the rest of
the city by the Stanford campus
and El Camino Real. The
people who live adjacent to the
site, and would be most greatly

affected by it, not only live in a
different city, Menlo Park, but
a different county, San Mateo.
"You've got all these artifi
cial boundries—it's ridicul
ous," Charles Brandon said. "If
somebody hadn't drawn that
line there, it'd be everybody's
problem. . . .From the point of
view of community, of envi
ronment, we're all in this to
gether."
"The environmental impacts
won't stop at the county line,"
Arthur Bolton added.
Stanford officials deny that
they have ignored the con
cerns of Menlo Park, either de
liberately or unintentionally.
They point out that a series of
public meeting were held in
1980, to give Menlo Park resi
dents a say in the planning of
the project.
However, the Menlo Park
residents who attended those
meetings say that they were lit
tle more than a token gesture.
"It became very discourag
ing," said resident Lorraine
Downing, "Manyof usfeltthey
were just tolerating what we
said, and they were goingto go
ahead and do what they
wanted."
What adds to the residents
feelings of betrayal are indica
tions that Stanford already had
the current plan in mind before
these public meetings took
place. Claudette Gregg
pointed to a passage in the
1978-80 Palo Alto-Stanford
Forum which stated that the 46
acres are a good site for high
density housing.
"Because the site is not near
established single-family Palo
Alto residential neighbor
hoods, it is likely to encounter
minimal political opposition,"
the report said.
"That document was created
without Menlo Park's knowl
edge," said Bonde. "All that
format work was being
planned, and they never told
us about it. . . . "I have been
so supportive of Stanford all
down the line and then
bang—l came across that
book. I really feel I've been
betrayed."
Bonde has a historical per
spective that the newer Stan

ford officials lack, he said. He
was mayor in the early 1970s
when Stanford proposed ex
tending Willow Road to El
Camino. At that time, Palo Alto
made housing at the Stanford
West site a condition of its ap
proval. joint meetings that in
cluded Menlo Park were held
to arrive at a compromise.
"We gained a permanent
open-space reserve (on a
nearby parcel) that was guaran
teed," he explained. "We were
talking about 800 units. . . .But
that all went down the drain
when the Palo Alto Council
changed its mind."
One of Menlo Park's major
complaints is that the housing
project is simply too big and
crams too many people into a
small area. Stanford West is
slated for a density of about 28
units per acre. By contrast, the
condominiums on Peter
Coutts Hill are only seven units
per acre, and the residential
neighborhood in Menlo Park is
just four units per acre.
"It changes the nature of the
community when you add that
many more people," Downing
said. "I came here because the
pace was slower, and there was
a quiet, peaceful atmosphere,
and I don't want a city of 3000
people so close that. . . .I
could hit a tennis ball over
there."
"Why here?" is a common
theme among the Menlo Park
citizen's pleas. Gregg noted
that Stanford's 1982 Com
prehensive Housing Program
stated that parcels of land
should be reserved for single
family homes, since 63 percent
of the Stanford faculty pre
ferred that type of housing.
"Why is it socially responsi
ble to reserve quarter-acre lots
elsewhere on Stanford prop
erty, but not next to a similar
adjacent community that
would welcome such a place
mentat its border?" sheasked.
In support of their position,
the Menlo Park neighbors also
contend that the project
will not be attractive to the fac
ulty it is supposed to house.
"There's no professor from
the East Coast who's going to
give up a large house to live in a

five-story, pink-and-white
concrete building," said
Gregg.
Traffic is another concern of
the residents across the creek.
Outside traffic consultants
hired by the community have
disputed the findings of the
Stanford West environmental
impact report. The consultants
say it is based on unrealistic as
sumptions of bicycle use and
as-yet-uncompleted road ren
ovations.
"They're assuming that 40
percent of the people will ride
bicycles," said Gregg, "which
is fine—until it rains."
"They've only allowed 1.7
cars per person over there,"
said Downing. "When they in

vite friends over, they're going
to tell them to park on San
Mateo Drive and walk across
the pedestrian bridge. It's
going to become a parking lot
over there."
One of Bonde's concerns is
that Stanford West will accel
erate environmental damage
to San Francisquito Creek.
"I hate to say it, but kids are
the creek's biggest enemy. . . .
and Stanford West will put 300
kids right next to that creek.
Where are they going to play?"
Bonde claimed that a pro
posed six-foot diameter drain
line will cause further damage.
He pointed out how the bank
of the creek has eroded across

from a smaller drain line that
already exists. He also com
plained that Stanford has al
ready begun constructing that
drain line on the south side of
Willow Road.
"They're just proceeding
right ahead," he said. "They're
just going to do these things
whether anyone agrees or
not."
Several of the residents em
phasized that they feel no per
sonal animosity toward the
University or its officials, but
merely that they oppose what
they see as an unnecessary and
ill-conceived project.
"I consider myself a member
of the Stanford community,"
said Gregg, who did postdoc

toral research at Stanford. "I
just wish they would look at al
ternative proposal from a city
that will be drastically af
fected."
"I think Stanford's a great
university," said Bonde.
"They're just not recognizing
the effect this will have on the
community."
Although they have not yet
given up, the Menlo Park resi
dents recognize that Stanford
will probably not change its
design plans now.
"I'm very tired of this whole
thing," said Gregg. "When this
is over, I'm going to say, 'Let's
celebrate a job well-done.'
Even if they build this thing, it'll
be over our protests."
Make no mistake about it.
Menlo Park residents are upset

"We gained a permanent
open-space reserve (on a
nearby parcel) that was guaran
teed," he explained. "We were
talking about 800 units. . . .But
that all went down the drain
when the Palo Alto Council
changed its mind."
One of Menlo Park's major
complaints is that the housing
project is simply too big and
crams too many people into a
small area. Stanford West is
slated for a density of about 28
units per acre. By contrast, the
condominiums on Peter
Coutts Hill are only seven units
per acre, and the residential
neighborhood in Menlo Park is
just four units per acre.
"It changes the nature of the
community when you add that
many more people," Downing
said. "I came here because the
pace was slower, and there was
a quiet, peaceful atmosphere,
and I don't want a city of 3000
people so close that. . . .I
could hit a tennis ball over
there."
"Why here?" is a common
theme among the Menlo Park
citizen's pleas. Gregg noted
that Stanford's 1982 Com
prehensive Housing Program
stated that parcels of land
should be reserved for single
family homes, since 63 percent
of the Stanford faculty pre
ferred that type of housing.
"Why is it socially responsi
ble to reserve quarter-acre lots
elsewhere on Stanford prop
erty, but not next to a similar
adjacent community that
would welcome such a place
mentat its border?" sheasked.
In support of their position,
the Menlo Park neighbors also
contend that the project
will not be attractive to the fac
ulty it is supposed to house.
"There's no professor from
the East Coast who's going to
give up a large house to live in a

five-story, pink-and-white
concrete building," said
Gregg.
Traffic is another concern of
the residents across the creek.
Outside traffic consultants
hired by the community have
disputed the findings of the
Stanford West environmental
impact report. The consultants
say it is based on unrealistic as
sumptions of bicycle use and
as-yet-uncompleted road ren
ovations.
"They're assuming that 40
percent of the people will ride
bicycles," said Gregg, "which
is fine—until it rains."
"They've only allowed 1.7
cars per person over there,"
said Downing. "When they in

vite friends over, they're going
to tell them to park on San
Mateo Drive and walk across
the pedestrian bridge. It's
going to become a parking lot
over there."
One of Bonde's concerns is
that Stanford West will accel
erate environmental damage
to San Francisquito Creek.
"I hate to say it, but kids are
the creek's biggest enemy. . . .
and Stanford West will put 300
kids right next to that creek.
Where are they going to play?"
Bonde claimed that a pro
posed six-foot diameter drain
line will cause further damage.
He pointed out how the bank
of the creek has eroded across

from a smaller drain line that
already exists. He also com
plained that Stanford has al
ready begun constructing that
drain line on the south side of
Willow Road.
"They're just proceeding
right ahead," he said. "They're
just going to do these things
whether anyone agrees or
not."
Several of the residents em
phasized that they feel no per
sonal animosity toward the
University or its officials, but
merely that they oppose what
they see as an unnecessary and
ill-conceived project.
"I consider myself a member
of the Stanford community,"
said Gregg, who did postdoc

toral research at Stanford. "I
just wish they would look at al
ternative proposal from a city
that will be drastically af
fected."
"I think Stanford's a great
university," said Bonde.
"They're just not recognizing
the effect this will have on the
community."
Although they have not yet
given up, the Menlo Park resi
dents recognize that Stanford
will probably not change its
design plans now.
"I'm very tired of this whole
thing," said Gregg. "When this
is over, I'm going to say, 'Let's
celebrate a job well-done.'
Even if they build this thing, it'll
be over our protests."
Make no mistake about it.
Menlo Park residents are upset
about Stanford West.
"I think they (Stanford offi
cials) feel that nobody's going
to be bothered by it except the
people in Menlo, and we don't
give a damn about them," said
Arthur Bolton, a retired factory
consultant.
"When I first heard about
it," Dorothy Bolton, Arthur's
wife said, "I thought, 'Why ha
ven't we heard about this be
fore, and how could it have
gone this far without giving
Menlo a chance to have some
thing to say abouc it?' "
"It's very frustrating," said
Claudette Gregg, a research
psychologist who has become
a vocal opponent of the proj
ect. "I don't think that the
people out there have gotten a
fair view of what's going on."
The Stanford West housing
project consists of 1275 units to
be built on 46 acres north of
Willow Road, directly across
San Francisquito Creek from
Menlo Park, as well as an addi
tional 194 units to be built on
4.3 acres on Welch Road.
It is the larger plot which has
prompted a vigorous protest
from its Menlo Park neighbors.
They are concerned about
many things, including the
proposed density of the proj
ect, traffic problems, air and
noise pollution, environmen
tal damage to the creek and vi
sual intrusion. But most of all,
they are upset about the way
they feel they have been ig
nored and disregarded by Palo
Alto and Stanford officials.
"Menlo Park people were
involved (in the planning pro
cess), but we were not heard,"
Ira Bonde, the former mayor of
Menlo Park, said. "We've re
peatedly been listened to and
nicely dealt with, but that was
the end of it."
A map of the area reveals the
cause of the dispute. Although
the Stanford West site is offi
cially in Palo Alto, it is effec
tively isolated from the rest of
the city by the Stanford campus
and El Camino Real. The
people who live adjacent to the
site, and would be most greatly

affected by it, not only live in a
different city, Menlo Park, but
a different county, San Mateo.
"You've got all these artifi
cial boundries—it's ridicul
ous," Charles Brandon said. "If
somebody hadn't drawn that
line there, it'd be everybody's
problem. . . .From the point of
view of community, of envi
ronment, we're all in this to
gether."
"The environmental impacts
won't stop at the county line,"
Arthur Bolton added.
Stanford officials deny that
they have ignored the con
cerns of Menlo Park, either de
liberately or unintentionally.
They point out that a series of
public meeting were held in
1980, to give Menlo Park resi
dents a say in the planning of
the project.
However, the Menlo Park
residents who attended those
meetings say that they were lit
tle more than a token gesture.
"It became very discourag
ing," said resident Lorraine
Downing, "Manyof usfeltthey
were just tolerating what we
said, and they were goingto go
ahead and do what they
wanted."
What adds to the residents
feelings of betrayal are indica
tions that Stanford already had
the current plan in mind before
these public meetings took
place. Claudette Gregg
pointed to a passage in the
1978-80 Palo Alto-Stanford
Forum which stated that the 46
acres are a good site for high
density housing.
"Because the site is not near
established single-family Palo
Alto residential neighbor
hoods, it is likely to encounter
minimal political opposition,"
the report said.
"That document was created
without Menlo Park's knowl
edge," said Bonde. "All that
format work was being
planned, and they never told
us about it. . . . "I have been
so supportive of Stanford all
down the line and then
bang—l came across that
book. I really feel I've been
betrayed."
Bonde has a historical per
spective that the newer Stan

ford officials lack, he said. He
was mayor in the early 1970s
when Stanford proposed ex
tending Willow Road to El
Camino. At that time, Palo Alto
made housing at the Stanford
West site a condition of its ap
proval. joint meetings that in
cluded Menlo Park were held
to arrive at a compromise.
"We gained a permanent
open-space reserve (on a
nearby parcel) that was guaran

to be bothered by it except the
people in Menlo, and we don't
give a damn about them," said
Arthur Bolton, a retired factory
consultant.
"When I first heard about
it," Dorothy Bolton, Arthur's
wife said, "I thought, 'Why ha
ven't we heard about this be
fore, and how could it have
gone this far without giving
Menlo a chance to have some
thing to say abouc it?' "
"It's very frustrating," said
Claudette Gregg, a research
psychologist who has become
a vocal opponent of the proj
ect. "I don't think that the
people out there have gotten a
fair view of what's going on."
The Stanford West housing
project consists of 1275 units to
be built on 46 acres north of
Willow Road, directly across
San Francisquito Creek from
Menlo Park, as well as an addi
tional 194 units to be built on
4.3 acres on Welch Road.
It is the larger plot which has
prompted a vigorous protest
from its Menlo Park neighbors.
They are concerned about
many things, including the
proposed density of the proj
ect, traffic problems, air and
noise pollution, environmen
tal damage to the creek and vi
sual intrusion. But most of all,
they are upset about the way
they feel they have been ig
nored and disregarded by Palo
Alto and Stanford officials.
"Menlo Park people were
involved (in the planning pro
cess), but we were not heard,"
Ira Bonde, the former mayor of
Menlo Park, said. "We've re
peatedly been listened to and
nicely dealt with, but that was
the end of it."
A map of the area reveals the
cause of the dispute. Although
the Stanford West site is offi
cially in Palo Alto, it is effec
tively isolated from the rest of
the city by the Stanford campus
and El Camino Real. The
people who live adjacent to the
site, and would be most greatly

affected by it, not only live in a
different city, Menlo Park, but
a different county, San Mateo.
"You've got all these artifi
cial boundries—it's ridicul
ous," Charles Brandon said. "If
somebody hadn't drawn that
line there, it'd be everybody's
problem. . . .From the point of
view of community, of envi
ronment, we're all in this to
gether."
"The environmental impacts
won't stop at the county line,"
Arthur Bolton added.
Stanford officials deny that
they have ignored the con
cerns of Menlo Park, either de
liberately or unintentionally.
They point out that a series of
public meeting were held in
1980, to give Menlo Park resi
dents a say in the planning of
the project.
However, the Menlo Park
residents who attended those
meetings say that they were lit
tle more than a token gesture.
"It became very discourag
ing," said resident Lorraine
Downing, "Manyof usfeltthey
were just tolerating what we
said, and they were goingto go
ahead and do what they
wanted."
What adds to the residents
feelings of betrayal are indica
tions that Stanford already had
the current plan in mind before
these public meetings took
place. Claudette Gregg
pointed to a passage in the
1978-80 Palo Alto-Stanford
Forum which stated that the 46
acres are a good site for high
density housing.
"Because the site is not near
established single-family Palo
Alto residential neighbor
hoods, it is likely to encounter
minimal political opposition,"
the report said.
"That document was created
without Menlo Park's knowl
edge," said Bonde. "All that
format work was being
planned, and they never told
us about it. . . . "I have been
so supportive of Stanford all
down the line and then
bang—l came across that
book. I really feel I've been
betrayed."
Bonde has a historical per
spective that the newer Stan

ford officials lack, he said. He
was mayor in the early 1970s
when Stanford proposed ex
tending Willow Road to El
Camino. At that time, Palo Alto
made housing at the Stanford
West site a condition of its ap
proval. joint meetings that in
cluded Menlo Park were held
to arrive at a compromise.
"We gained a permanent
open-space reserve (on a
nearby parcel) that was guaran
teed," he explained. "We were
talking about 800 units. . . .But
that all went down the drain
when the Palo Alto Council
changed its mind."
One of Menlo Park's major
complaints is that the housing
project is simply too big and
crams too many people into a
small area. Stanford West is
slated for a density of about 28
units per acre. By contrast, the
condominiums on Peter
Coutts Hill are only seven units
per acre, and the residential
neighborhood in Menlo Park is
just four units per acre.
"It changes the nature of the
community when you add that
many more people," Downing
said. "I came here because the
pace was slower, and there was
a quiet, peaceful atmosphere,
and I don't want a city of 3000
people so close that. . . .I
could hit a tennis ball over
there."
"Why here?" is a common
theme among the Menlo Park
citizen's pleas. Gregg noted
that Stanford's 1982 Com
prehensive Housing Program
stated that parcels of land
should be reserved for single
family homes, since 63 percent
of the Stanford faculty pre
ferred that type of housing.
"Why is it socially responsi
ble to reserve quarter-acre lots
elsewhere on Stanford prop
erty, but not next to a similar
adjacent community that
would welcome such a place
mentat its border?" sheasked.
In support of their position,
the Menlo Park neighbors also
contend that the project
will not be attractive to the fac
ulty it is supposed to house.
"There's no professor from
the East Coast who's going to
give up a large house to live in a

five-story, pink-and-white
concrete building," said
Gregg.
Traffic is another concern of
the residents across the creek.
Outside traffic consultants
hired by the community have
disputed the findings of the
Stanford West environmental
impact report. The consultants
say it is based on unrealistic as
sumptions of bicycle use and
as-yet-uncompleted road ren
ovations.
"They're assuming that 40
percent of the people will ride
bicycles," said Gregg, "which
is fine—until it rains."
"They've only allowed 1.7
cars per person over there,"
said Downing. "When they in

vite friends over, they're going
to tell them to park on San
Mateo Drive and walk across
the pedestrian bridge. It's
going to become a parking lot
over there."
One of Bonde's concerns is
that Stanford West will accel
erate environmental damage
to San Francisquito Creek.
"I hate to say it, but kids are
the creek's biggest enemy. . . .
and Stanford West will put 300
kids right next to that creek.
Where are they going to play?"
Bonde claimed that a pro
posed six-foot diameter drain
line will cause further damage.
He pointed out how the bank
of the creek has eroded across

from a smaller drain line that
already exists. He also com
plained that Stanford has al
ready begun constructing that
drain line on the south side of
Willow Road.
"They're just proceeding
right ahead," he said. "They're
just going to do these things
whether anyone agrees or
not."
Several of the residents em
phasized that they feel no per
sonal animosity toward the
University or its officials, but
merely that they oppose what
they see as an unnecessary and
ill-conceived project.
"I consider myself a member
of the Stanford community,"
said Gregg, who did postdoc

toral research at Stanford. "I
just wish they would look at al
ternative proposal from a city
that will be drastically af
fected."
"I think Stanford's a great
university," said Bonde.
"They're just not recognizing
the effect this will have on the
community."
Although they have not yet
given up, the Menlo Park resi
dents recognize that Stanford
will probably not change its
design plans now.
"I'm very tired of this whole
thing," said Gregg. "When this
is over, I'm going to say, 'Let's
celebrate a job well-done.'
Even if they build this thing, it'll
be over our protests."
