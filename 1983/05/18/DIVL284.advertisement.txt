Cancer strikes 120,000 people in our work force
every year Although no dollar value can ever
be placed on a human lite, the fact remains that
our economy loses more than $10 billion in
earnings every year that cancer victims would have
generated. Earnings they might still be generating
if they had known the simple facts on how to
protect themselves from cancer.
Now you can do something to protect your
employees,your company,and yourself...call
your local unit of the American Cancer Society
and ask for their free pamphlet,"Helping
Your Employees to Protect Themselves
Against Cancer." Start your company on a
policy of good health today!
