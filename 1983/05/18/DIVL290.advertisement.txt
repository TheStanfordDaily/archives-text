INTERNATIONAL REGIMES
Edited by STEPHEN I). KRASNER
Here fourteen distinguished specialists in international political economy
thoroughly explore the concept of international regimes—the implicit and explicit
principles, norms, rules, and procedures that guide international behavior.
In the first section, the authors develop several theoretical views of regimes.
Some of them, contending that international regimes must be viewed in terms of a
power-oriented realist approach to international relations, claim that regimes arise
only under certain circumstances. Other contributors, arguing from a liberal or
Grotian standpoint, assert that regimes are inherent in any persistent pattern of
international interaction. In the following section, the theories are applied to
specific issues in international relations, focusing on such topics as the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and on the still-enduring postwar regimes for
money and security.
How can regimes be defined? How do they originate and change? How do they
work, and what functions do they serve? What arc the virtues and the drawbacks
of the term as a tool for studying international relations? These are among the
questions addressed in this comprehensive investigation of a crucial concept. It will
interest political scientists and others concerned with international law and
international economics.
