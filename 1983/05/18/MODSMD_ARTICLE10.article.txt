## The 						Stanford Daily Stop merit scholarships 
### 
The recent trend among universities across
the nation toward giving merit-based schol
arships worries us; more important, it should
worry all students because of the effects it may
have on university financial aid programs.
The trend is the result of the end of the "Baby
Boom" generation; fewer young men and
women are entering the many colleges that
prospered during the student glut of the '60s.
This situation has created a buyer's market for
students entering college; unfortunately, it has
also created student-hungry colleges.
Thus the merit-based scholarship is a form of
student aid based not on need but on demon
strated talent, usually of an academic nature.
Colleges desperate for scholastic talent have re
sorted to what amounts to bribes to attract top
rate students, while need-based financial aid
programs have been cut. The result: a flock of
top-ranked high school seniors going to the
highest bidder and not necessarily to the school
that best suits their abilities.
On the surface, the program seems good;
students receive money in a tight financial aid
market, while colleges attract first-rate scholars
to build their academic reputation. The prob

lem, however, is that students who do not need
aid often receive it, shortchanging those stu
dents who do need the money.
Once federal funds are secured, colleges can
use other resources to attract "desirable" can
didates (those with impressive high school re
cords) away from other schools.
Also, students may end up attending a school
which is not the best for their intellectual needs.
Do we want our best and brightest receiving less
than superior education? Obviously not, but
merit-based scholarships raise this disturbing
possibility.
Comparisons to athletic scholarships ring un
true; at Stanford, for instance, athletic schol
arships are funded by donations and not out of
financial aid funds.
Fortunately, the trend has not gotten out of
hand. Bright seniors are not being lured to col
leges by vacation trips or new cars. University
President Donald Kennedy has reaffirmed Stan
ford's commitment to need-blind admissions.
But the use of such merit-based scholarships
is increasing. For the benefit of students, uni
versities and the public, merit scholarships
should be banned and banned immediately.
