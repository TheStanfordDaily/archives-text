## Hostages of militarist technology 
### 
A recent news item in the paper
quotes me as saying that I rejected
the theory that "any scientific re
search that can be done is good."
And the piece goes on to cite my
prediction that "if these policies are
extrapolated out into the future,
there in fact is no future." For one
who has spent his working life in a
milieu of scientific research, it may
be thought that these sentiments are
uncharacteristic.
I come from a family of engineers
and my father at his death was presi
dent of the Newcomen society, the
British society devoted to the history
of technology. Going further back,
one grandfather, a well-known sur
geon, was known for his innovations
in medical technology and his father
was an iconoclastic Scottish minister
who in his spare time invented a
steam plough for use on the steep
hills of Scotland. One of my own ear
liest memories is of making little
drawings with my brother of what we
thought a super streamlined car of
the future might look like. (It turned
out like a 1950 Buick; Detroit should
have hired us.) I grew up as what the
British call a techno-twit: someone
who has an unreasoning belief in the
value of technology. Now, I suppose
people will wonder how I came to be
a modern day Luddite.
In the early years of the 19th cen
tury, in the north of England, the
textile industry began to introduce
machinery for the spinning of cot
ton, machinery which brought to an
end the cottage industry that existed
at that time. Artisans led by one Ned
Lud broke into the mills and de
stroyed the machinery. Modern texts
usually comment that Ned Lud was
"said to be an imbecile."
Fifty years later it was the social
conditions of these same textile
workers, now proletarianised, their
village culture destroyed, that
aroused an emigre German social
worker, Karl Marx, to write a man
ifesto which echoes around the
world to this day. A hundred years
after the Communist Manifesto,

when I was working in a Yorkshire
textile mill, the life of the factory
hand was still grim and unhealthy;
the mill towns still greasy black
monuments to technology,
punctuating the beautiful Pennine
hills. Ned I ud was perhaps not such
an imbecile.
In this century we have become
more and more aware that the nega
tive outcome of technical innovation
is an increasingly serious problem.
The automobile which shapes our
cities and defines our leisure is a
leading cause of early death and
tragic injury. The lead from gasoline,
introduced to save a few pennies, is
now known to cause widespread
learning disability in urban children.
Chemical herbicides, introduced to
save hand labor in a time of wide
spread structural unemployment,
are found to be contaminated with
poisonsthat remain forever in the en
vironment, adding to the burden of
birth defects and cancer. After public
expenditures of hundreds of billions
of dollars, nuclear power is increas
ingly seen as a technological and
economic disaster.
But it was in the context of military
technology that my remarks were
made. And here the argument is
straightforward: it is not the side ef
fect that threatens society, it is the
main effect. Shortly before his death,
E.F. Schumacher wrote that increas
ingly, technical and scientific prog
ress were beingputtothepurposeof
human domination rather than that
of human liberation. And increas
ingly in this country, the Department
of Defense (DoD) is moving into a
position of the main funding agency
for all scientific research. The share
of research funded by the military,
compared to that funded by civilian
agencies has inceased threefold in
the last five years. For some years the
extent of DoD support of basic re
search was limited by the Mansfield
amendment, but by 1980 a DoD di
rector of research could say:
. . .only the availability of funding
and the level of interest of the agen

cies determines the spectrum of re
search support possible. . When
asked whether the laws affected the
ability of the DoD to support basic
research he responded, "No, abso
lutely not."
Outside the realm of research, in
the realm of deployment, it becomes
clear that the ever increasing flood of
weapons exceeds the ability of the
political forces to manage them. The
recent views of the MX basing prob
lem presents us with a clear picture
of a polity frantically trying to find a
rationale for weapons systems which
it neither wants or needs. In the
Falklands/Malvinas war the British
found themselves attacked by
weapons of their own manufacture,
as well as those produced by their
closest allies. They are now fortifying
the islands while the Argentines are
re-equipping their navy with ships
which are partly of British manufac
ture.
Military technology is now one ot
the world's largest industries; the
annual expenditures amount to $120
for every man, woman and child on
earth. Its momentum has out
stripped the ability of the political
system to contain it. Wars are fought
for reasons which defy explanation.
We are hostages of technology in the
service of militarism.
Technical development has always
enhanced the power of those who
control it. And now it predominantly
serves the militarists. Some of that
power flows back through the politi
cal system to further accelerate the
control of science and its diversion
bellicose ends. The last 15 years have
been a "time of peace" in which 10
million have died, many of them civi
lian victims of advanced weapons.
And we move closer to the last
spasm, the final physics experiment.
The time is short and choices have to
be made between complicity or re
sistance. Ned Lud, where are you
when we need you most?

straightforward: it is not the side ef
fect that threatens society, it is the
main effect. Shortly before his death,
E.F. Schumacher wrote that increas
ingly, technical and scientific prog
ress were beingputtothepurposeof
human domination rather than that
of human liberation. And increas
ingly in this country, the Department
of Defense (DoD) is moving into a
position of the main funding agency
for all scientific research. The share
of research funded by the military,
compared to that funded by civilian
agencies has inceased threefold in
the last five years. For some years the
extent of DoD support of basic re
search was limited by the Mansfield
amendment, but by 1980 a DoD di
rector of research could say:
. . .only the availability of funding
and the level of interest of the agen

cies determines the spectrum of re
search support possible. . When
asked whether the laws affected the
ability of the DoD to support basic
research he responded, "No, abso
lutely not."
Outside the realm of research, in
the realm of deployment, it becomes
clear that the ever increasing flood of
weapons exceeds the ability of the
political forces to manage them. The
recent views of the MX basing prob
lem presents us with a clear picture
of a polity frantically trying to find a
rationale for weapons systems which
it neither wants or needs. In the
Falklands/Malvinas war the British
found themselves attacked by
weapons of their own manufacture,
as well as those produced by their
closest allies. They are now fortifying
the islands while the Argentines are
re-equipping their navy with ships
which are partly of British manufac
ture.
Military technology is now one ot
the world's largest industries; the
annual expenditures amount to $120
for every man, woman and child on
earth. Its momentum has out
stripped the ability of the political
system to contain it. Wars are fought
for reasons which defy explanation.
We are hostages of technology in the
service of militarism.
Technical development has always
enhanced the power of those who
control it. And now it predominantly
serves the militarists. Some of that
power flows back through the politi
cal system to further accelerate the
control of science and its diversion
bellicose ends. The last 15 years have
been a "time of peace" in which 10
million have died, many of them civi
lian victims of advanced weapons.
And we move closer to the last
spasm, the final physics experiment.
The time is short and choices have to
be made between complicity or re
sistance. Ned Lud, where are you
when we need you most?

SLAC.)
A recent news item in the paper
quotes me as saying that I rejected
the theory that "any scientific re
search that can be done is good."
And the piece goes on to cite my
prediction that "if these policies are
extrapolated out into the future,
there in fact is no future." For one
who has spent his working life in a
milieu of scientific research, it may
be thought that these sentiments are
uncharacteristic.
I come from a family of engineers
and my father at his death was presi
dent of the Newcomen society, the
British society devoted to the history
of technology. Going further back,
one grandfather, a well-known sur
geon, was known for his innovations
in medical technology and his father
was an iconoclastic Scottish minister
who in his spare time invented a
steam plough for use on the steep
hills of Scotland. One of my own ear
liest memories is of making little
drawings with my brother of what we
thought a super streamlined car of
the future might look like. (It turned
out like a 1950 Buick; Detroit should
have hired us.) I grew up as what the
British call a techno-twit: someone
who has an unreasoning belief in the
value of technology. Now, I suppose
people will wonder how I came to be
a modern day Luddite.
In the early years of the 19th cen
tury, in the north of England, the
textile industry began to introduce
machinery for the spinning of cot
ton, machinery which brought to an
end the cottage industry that existed
at that time. Artisans led by one Ned
Lud broke into the mills and de
stroyed the machinery. Modern texts
usually comment that Ned Lud was
"said to be an imbecile."
Fifty years later it was the social
conditions of these same textile
workers, now proletarianised, their
village culture destroyed, that
aroused an emigre German social
worker, Karl Marx, to write a man
ifesto which echoes around the
world to this day. A hundred years
after the Communist Manifesto,

when I was working in a Yorkshire
textile mill, the life of the factory
hand was still grim and unhealthy;
the mill towns still greasy black
monuments to technology,
punctuating the beautiful Pennine
hills. Ned I ud was perhaps not such
an imbecile.
In this century we have become
more and more aware that the nega
tive outcome of technical innovation
is an increasingly serious problem.
The automobile which shapes our
cities and defines our leisure is a
leading cause of early death and
tragic injury. The lead from gasoline,
introduced to save a few pennies, is
now known to cause widespread
learning disability in urban children.
Chemical herbicides, introduced to
save hand labor in a time of wide
spread structural unemployment,
are found to be contaminated with
poisonsthat remain forever in the en
vironment, adding to the burden of
birth defects and cancer. After public
expenditures of hundreds of billions
of dollars, nuclear power is increas
ingly seen as a technological and
economic disaster.
But it was in the context of military
technology that my remarks were
