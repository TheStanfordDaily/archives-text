# Build-up belies bargaining

### 
If the most recent arms control and defense initiatives
of the Reagan administration are any indication, then
Ronald Reagan may very well be the first American pres
ident in over a decade to fail to reach agreement on any
arms control measures with the Soviet Union. This fail
ure comes at a time when the need for arms control is in
many respects more urgent than it has ever been before,
with the United States on the verge of deploying a wide
variety of new weapons systems capable of destroying
the 75 percent of Soviet missiles that are deployed in
vulnerable land-based silos in the Soviet Union.
If the United States carries through with the deploy
ment of Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe, the MX
missile in the United States and the Trident II at sea, it
will leave the Soviet Union with little choice but to either
accept American superiority or embark upon a costly
and destabilizing effort to offset the United States' arms
buildup with one of its own. Judging from similar deci
sions faced by the Soviets in the past, they will not
hesitate to choose in favor of vet more arms.
Perhaps even more troublesome than the prospect of
the lack of any arms control agreements with the Soviets
in the next two or possibly even six years is the possibil
ity that the Reagan administration will undermine some
of the most important existing arms control agreements.
During congressional debate over the MX last year, Pen
tagon officials openly speculated over the possibility of
developing an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system to de
fend densely packed MX missiles. Such a plan would
have directly contravened the provisions of SALT I
against such an ABM system, provisions which many
regard as the most important arms control measures
ever concluded.
Reagan's "Star Wars" speech advocating that the
United States should develop a space-based laser ABM
system would also require abrogation of the ABM provi
sions of SALT I and would probably go against the 1967
treaty banning weapons of mass destruction in outer
space as well. Finally, the Reagan administration's en
dorsement of the Scowcroft Commission's recom
mendation that the United States should deploy both
the MX missile and a smaller single warhead "Midget
man" may signal the end of continued Soviet obser
vance of the unratified SALT II accords, which limit both
sides to the testing of one new intercontinental ballistic
missile. Ironically, it is this very provision that the Re
agan administration accused the Soviets of violating.
The most serious problem with the Reagan adminis

tration's almost casual contemplation ot the possibility
that the arms control achievements of the last decade
might be swept away by the proposed United States
arms buildup is that the potential abrogation of SALT I
and SALT II by the United States was not a regrettable but
necessary consequence of vitally important weapons
systems but an entirely avoidable consequence of the
possible deployment of weapons systems of very dubi
ous strategic value. If the majority of expert opinion can
be trusted, space based ABM systems will never offer a
technically and economically viable means of defending
against a massive nuclear attack. In any case, there is no
need to endanger the ABM treaty and provide material
for Soviet accusations of American insincerity in arms
control by makingthe space-based ABM a national prior
ity in such an extremely public manner.
In the case of the MX, Congress already decided that
the dense pack basing idea was unwise even without the
addition of an ABM protection system that would violate
SALT I. Despite the admission of several members of the
Scowcroft Commission that MX missiles placed in ai
cordance with its recent recommendations in Mm
uteman silos would be vulnerable to Soviet attack, hov\
ever, the president persists in pushing Congress to de
ploy the multiple warhead MX in vulnerable silos that
might prove to be tempting targets for Soviet pre
emptive nuclear strikes.
The most effective argument that President Reagan
has used in Congress in order to win acceptance of the
deployment of the MX is that he needs it as a bargaining
chip in arms control negotiations with the Soviets. The
effect of the deployment of the MX would not be that of
furthering arms control negotiations, however, but that
of forestalling them. The Soviets have already signaled
that they feel that they might have to wait for the end of
Reagan's presidency before they can conclude arms
control agreements with the United States, and the de
ployment of the MX would only make them more firm in
that conviction and cause them to seek to redress the
United States buildup not through more arms control
but through more arms. The United States already has a
more than adequate supply of bargaining chips in the
Trident li, the cruise missile and especially in the Persh
ing 11, which the Soviet leadership fears above all be
cause it could reach Moscow in five to eight minutes
from silos in Europe. What the United States needs now
is not more bargaining chips but more bargaining.

of forestalling them. The Soviets have already signaled
that they feel that they might have to wait for the end of
Reagan's presidency before they can conclude arms
control agreements with the United States, and the de
ployment of the MX would only make them more firm in
that conviction and cause them to seek to redress the
United States buildup not through more arms control
but through more arms. The United States already has a
more than adequate supply of bargaining chips in the
Trident li, the cruise missile and especially in the Persh
ing 11, which the Soviet leadership fears above all be
cause it could reach Moscow in five to eight minutes
from silos in Europe. What the United States needs now
is not more bargaining chips but more bargaining.

The sound and the fury
If the most recent arms control and defense initiatives
of the Reagan administration are any indication, then
Ronald Reagan may very well be the first American pres
ident in over a decade to fail to reach agreement on any
arms control measures with the Soviet Union. This fail
ure comes at a time when the need for arms control is in
many respects more urgent than it has ever been before,
with the United States on the verge of deploying a wide
variety of new weapons systems capable of destroying
the 75 percent of Soviet missiles that are deployed in
vulnerable land-based silos in the Soviet Union.
If the United States carries through with the deploy
ment of Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe, the MX
missile in the United States and the Trident II at sea, it
will leave the Soviet Union with little choice but to either
accept American superiority or embark upon a costly
and destabilizing effort to offset the United States' arms
buildup with one of its own. Judging from similar deci
sions faced by the Soviets in the past, they will not
hesitate to choose in favor of vet more arms.
Perhaps even more troublesome than the prospect of
the lack of any arms control agreements with the Soviets
in the next two or possibly even six years is the possibil
ity that the Reagan administration will undermine some
of the most important existing arms control agreements.
During congressional debate over the MX last year, Pen
tagon officials openly speculated over the possibility of
developing an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system to de
fend densely packed MX missiles. Such a plan would
have directly contravened the provisions of SALT I
against such an ABM system, provisions which many
regard as the most important arms control measures
ever concluded.
Reagan's "Star Wars" speech advocating that the
United States should develop a space-based laser ABM
system would also require abrogation of the ABM provi
sions of SALT I and would probably go against the 1967
treaty banning weapons of mass destruction in outer
space as well. Finally, the Reagan administration's en
dorsement of the Scowcroft Commission's recom
mendation that the United States should deploy both
the MX missile and a smaller single warhead "Midget
man" may signal the end of continued Soviet obser
vance of the unratified SALT II accords, which limit both
sides to the testing of one new intercontinental ballistic
missile. Ironically, it is this very provision that the Re
agan administration accused the Soviets of violating.
The most serious problem with the Reagan adminis

tration's almost casual contemplation ot the possibility
that the arms control achievements of the last decade
might be swept away by the proposed United States
arms buildup is that the potential abrogation of SALT I
and SALT II by the United States was not a regrettable but
necessary consequence of vitally important weapons
systems but an entirely avoidable consequence of the
possible deployment of weapons systems of very dubi
ous strategic value. If the majority of expert opinion can
be trusted, space based ABM systems will never offer a
technically and economically viable means of defending
against a massive nuclear attack. In any case, there is no
need to endanger the ABM treaty and provide material
for Soviet accusations of American insincerity in arms
control by makingthe space-based ABM a national prior
ity in such an extremely public manner.
In the case of the MX, Congress already decided that
the dense pack basing idea was unwise even without the
addition of an ABM protection system that would violate
SALT I. Despite the admission of several members of the
Scowcroft Commission that MX missiles placed in ai
cordance with its recent recommendations in Mm
uteman silos would be vulnerable to Soviet attack, hov\
ever, the president persists in pushing Congress to de
ploy the multiple warhead MX in vulnerable silos that
might prove to be tempting targets for Soviet pre
emptive nuclear strikes.
The most effective argument that President Reagan
has used in Congress in order to win acceptance of the
deployment of the MX is that he needs it as a bargaining
chip in arms control negotiations with the Soviets. The
effect of the deployment of the MX would not be that of
furthering arms control negotiations, however, but that
of forestalling them. The Soviets have already signaled
that they feel that they might have to wait for the end of
Reagan's presidency before they can conclude arms
control agreements with the United States, and the de
ployment of the MX would only make them more firm in
that conviction and cause them to seek to redress the
United States buildup not through more arms control
but through more arms. The United States already has a
more than adequate supply of bargaining chips in the
Trident li, the cruise missile and especially in the Persh
ing 11, which the Soviet leadership fears above all be
cause it could reach Moscow in five to eight minutes
from silos in Europe. What the United States needs now
is not more bargaining chips but more bargaining.
