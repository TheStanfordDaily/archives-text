## Open letter from a former Hoover director 
### 
(The following is an open letter to
President Donald Kennedy.)
As you may recall, while I was dean
of Humanities and Sciences I also
served briefly in 1959 as acting di
rector of the Hoover Institution in
the interim between the resignation
of Easton Rothwell to become Presi
dent of Mills College and the ap
pointment of Glenn Campbell, the
present director. In view of this cir
cumstance, I venture to comment
briefly on the current controversy
over the relation between the Uni
versity and the Hoover Institution.
The issues that have been recently
raised are not new; they were all
faced and considered in 1959. It was
because of concern with these same
matters that I undertook the acting
directorship, and it was after consid
ering them that the trustees of the
University made their decision at that
time. Now it is obvious that indi
vidual opinions can and do differ on
the complex questions involved.
At the same time, it seems to me
that in the interests of all concerned
it is of primary importance that once
a decision has been made on a matter
of this sort, it should be adhered to
unless strong reasons exist for a
re-examination. And no such reasons
have been put forward, as far as I am
aware. The current requests for an
inquiry seem rather to assume that
the issues raised have never been
recogni/ed and should therefore be
looked into. But such an assumption
is mistaken. A new inquiry would
merely repeat former inquiries with
out adding anything of significance,
as far as I can see. In this connection

several facts are specially relevant:
• There is more diversity of opin
ion among the Fellows of the Hoover
Institution today than there was 25
years ago. Hence there is less reason
to be concerned over the "partisan"
character of the Institution now than
there was then.
• Commitment to a partisan posi
tion or partisan ideology can seri
ously threaten the "free market of
ideas" when such commitment is
concealed or misrepresented. But
we have the opposite position here.
The current objection is that the
Hoover Institution's links with the
Reagan administration have been
publicized too extravagantly, not too
little. Thus nobody could claim to
have been misled or deceived.
• The notable progress made by
the University over the past 25 years
is ample evidence that its academic
prestige has not suffered from its as
sociation with the Hoover Institu
tion, which has been widely known
for having a special orientation.

Irsay threats
"I'm a graduate of the University of
Illinois. I'm as bright if not brighter
than he is." Those were the words of
Robert Irsay, owner of the Baltimore
Colts, after announcing that he was
going to "get Flway" for not signing
with the team.
Why is intelligence always an issue
when there is talk of talented

athletes? Why do people assume that
athletic talent can only exist in some
one lacking in intelligence? Other
positive attributes are discriminated
against as well:
"Anyone with her looks cannot
have brains." A local student's com
ment after learning of Brooke
Shields' acceptance to Princeton.
Should good looks be one of the in
dices of inferior intellect? I'm not de
fending her acting talents (I went to
Blue Lagoon to see her slinking
through the grass), but I think it is
unfair to judge her I.Q. by her ap
pearance. We'd have some pretty
ugly people here if that were the only
criterion!
To the Robert Irsays of the world I
say, mellow out! Be tolerant of those
that are more gifted than you are. In
the meantime it would be best to
keep your mouth shut: while your
classmates at the U of I may agree
that your threat against Elway clearly
demonstrates superior intellect, you
cannot count on the rest of us draw
ing the same conclusion.

In reference to Lyn Bowman's
hopefully facetious suggestion that
we need two Guest Professorship
Boards, let me point out two things.
First of all, engineering and science
students don't have much right to
demand anything at all if, as stated,
they "neither run for political office
nor vote." If students of sciences and
engineering expect elected student

organizations to serve their interests
they must be willing to vote and
serve on the necessary boards and
committees.
Surely the nerds are not entirely
too busy studying that they cannot
take time to vote? Students well
versed in the Laws of Ther
modynamics, cell reproduction and
such must know that one does not
get something for nothing. As long as
science and engineering students
make themselves unavailable for
such unworthy things as student
politics and service organizations,
they must expect to go unheard. As I
see it, the ones who don't vote are
the real "failures at the polls."
My second point concerns the
proposed division of students along
the lines of C.P. Snow's "Two Cul
tures." It seems to me that this con
cept is a convenient means of furth
ering intellectual stereotypes and
promoting division among people of
a society already divided and
categorized to the extreme. It allows
the "scientific-minded" a ready ex
cuse for avoiding difficult philosoph
ical or cultural issues and the
"liberal-arts" or "humanities" per
son one for fearing technology or
science.
I suggest that the non-humanities
students who would really ap
preciate a science/engineering guest
professor get involved in the selec
tion process, help encourage others
to do the same and work in a united
effort to bring us quality guest teach
ing.

dices of inferior intellect? I'm not de
fending her acting talents (I went to
Blue Lagoon to see her slinking
through the grass), but I think it is
unfair to judge her I.Q. by her ap
pearance. We'd have some pretty
ugly people here if that were the only
criterion!
To the Robert Irsays of the world I
say, mellow out! Be tolerant of those
that are more gifted than you are. In
the meantime it would be best to
keep your mouth shut: while your
classmates at the U of I may agree
that your threat against Elway clearly
demonstrates superior intellect, you
cannot count on the rest of us draw
ing the same conclusion.

In reference to Lyn Bowman's
hopefully facetious suggestion that
we need two Guest Professorship
Boards, let me point out two things.
First of all, engineering and science
students don't have much right to
demand anything at all if, as stated,
they "neither run for political office
nor vote." If students of sciences and
engineering expect elected student

organizations to serve their interests
they must be willing to vote and
serve on the necessary boards and
committees.
Surely the nerds are not entirely
too busy studying that they cannot
take time to vote? Students well
versed in the Laws of Ther
modynamics, cell reproduction and
such must know that one does not
get something for nothing. As long as
science and engineering students
make themselves unavailable for
such unworthy things as student
politics and service organizations,
they must expect to go unheard. As I
see it, the ones who don't vote are
the real "failures at the polls."
My second point concerns the
proposed division of students along
the lines of C.P. Snow's "Two Cul
tures." It seems to me that this con
cept is a convenient means of furth
ering intellectual stereotypes and
promoting division among people of
a society already divided and
categorized to the extreme. It allows
the "scientific-minded" a ready ex
cuse for avoiding difficult philosoph
ical or cultural issues and the
"liberal-arts" or "humanities" per
son one for fearing technology or
science.
I suggest that the non-humanities
students who would really ap
preciate a science/engineering guest
professor get involved in the selec
tion process, help encourage others
to do the same and work in a united
effort to bring us quality guest teach
ing.

As you may recall, while I was dean
of Humanities and Sciences I also
served briefly in 1959 as acting di
rector of the Hoover Institution in
the interim between the resignation
of Easton Rothwell to become Presi
dent of Mills College and the ap
pointment of Glenn Campbell, the
present director. In view of this cir
cumstance, I venture to comment
briefly on the current controversy
over the relation between the Uni
versity and the Hoover Institution.
The issues that have been recently
raised are not new; they were all
faced and considered in 1959. It was
because of concern with these same
matters that I undertook the acting
directorship, and it was after consid
ering them that the trustees of the
University made their decision at that
time. Now it is obvious that indi
vidual opinions can and do differ on
the complex questions involved.
At the same time, it seems to me
that in the interests of all concerned
it is of primary importance that once
a decision has been made on a matter
of this sort, it should be adhered to
unless strong reasons exist for a
re-examination. And no such reasons
have been put forward, as far as I am
aware. The current requests for an
inquiry seem rather to assume that
the issues raised have never been
recogni/ed and should therefore be
looked into. But such an assumption
is mistaken. A new inquiry would
merely repeat former inquiries with
out adding anything of significance,
as far as I can see. In this connection

several facts are specially relevant:
• There is more diversity of opin
ion among the Fellows of the Hoover
Institution today than there was 25
years ago. Hence there is less reason
to be concerned over the "partisan"
character of the Institution now than
there was then.
• Commitment to a partisan posi
tion or partisan ideology can seri
ously threaten the "free market of
ideas" when such commitment is
concealed or misrepresented. But
we have the opposite position here.
The current objection is that the
Hoover Institution's links with the
Reagan administration have been
publicized too extravagantly, not too
little. Thus nobody could claim to
have been misled or deceived.
• The notable progress made by
the University over the past 25 years
is ample evidence that its academic
prestige has not suffered from its as
sociation with the Hoover Institu
tion, which has been widely known
for having a special orientation.

"I'm a graduate of the University of
Illinois. I'm as bright if not brighter
than he is." Those were the words of
Robert Irsay, owner of the Baltimore
Colts, after announcing that he was
going to "get Flway" for not signing
with the team.
Why is intelligence always an issue
when there is talk of talented

athletes? Why do people assume that
athletic talent can only exist in some
one lacking in intelligence? Other
positive attributes are discriminated
against as well:
"Anyone with her looks cannot
have brains." A local student's com
ment after learning of Brooke
Shields' acceptance to Princeton.
