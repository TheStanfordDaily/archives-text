# Kennedy on Hoover: issue is governance, not politics
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
In a statement issued on the Hoover In
stitution debate yesterday, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy struck a tone of com
promise which drew positive reactions from
the sponsors of both faculty petitions.
"The important issues, it seems to me,
have to do with governance and appoint
ments, and not with who has what kind of
politics," Kennedy said. Political consid
erations "are not only an improper criterion
for appointment or evaluation under our
principles of academic freedom." but "can
turn a discussion into one that is unnecessar
ily strident on both sides."
The president's concern that the debate
had degenerated into rounds of political
mud-slinging and ad-hominum attacks was
evident throughout the three-page docu
ment. The statement represents the first
time the administration has taken a stance
on the controversy.

Administrators at Hoover were unavail
able for comment. Director Glenn Campbell
was out of town and Assoc. Director Richard
Burress could not be reached last night.
Coordinator of Public Affairs George
Marotta said he would rather not comment
on the president's statement.
In an interview with the Daily, Kennedy
stressed that the relationship between
Hoover and the University is an important
one and acknowledged that there are "seri
ous issues" to be discussed. At the same
time, he said he hopes to see an "improve
ment in the quality of discussion" and "con
centration on more substantive issues."
Asked why the numerous petitions have
elicited such heated reactions, Kennedy
said, "the question is whether you consider
their (the petitioners') concerns to be just
those on the surface, or whether they don't
really reflect some underlying need for
changes in governance and
appointments—which seem to me to be the

real issues."
As to whether an official inquiry into the
Hoover Institution is likely Kennedy said
the board of trustees vmII probably ask an
eminent "visiting committee to look at the
relationships and give us some advice."
The board of trustees would determine
the composition of the committee, which
Kennedy said would probably include
people from both inside and outside the
University. Such a study is "a reasonable and
entirely typical academic undertaking.," he
said.
Kennedy clarified the status of the Univer
sity's budgetary relations with Hoover, con
cluding that the rate of growth of the Hoover
budget noted by the petitioners has "eco
nomic significance, but no political signifi
cance whatsoever."
According to Kennedy, the increase since
1979-80 in University general funds received
by Hoover is 55 percent not 64 percent, as
the petitioners assert, it compares with a 62

percent increase in the University's overall
operating budget over the same period.
"This rate of growth reflects the degree to
which all budgets have been subject to infla
tionary increase," Kennedy said. "Any hy
pothesis that Hoover's funding has in
creased faster in nonsensical—everything
has gone up."
In acknowledging that there are indeed
substantive and serious issues to be dis
cussed, Kennedy has set the stage for what
should be a pertinent debate on the floor of
the faculty senate May 26.
Leaders of the various Hoover petition
drives reacted favorably to the president's
moderate statement.
Political Science Prof. John Manley and
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz issued a joint
reply. "We were very pleased to receive Don
Kennedy's constructive statement on the
Hoover Institution inquiry," they said. "We
have maintained from the start that that the
politics of individuals is not the at issue in

this debate and wish to join him in dis
couraging such a focus for the public discus
sion.
Manley and Rebholz agreed that the gov
ernance of Hoover and the appointment
process are important questions. In addi
tion, they pointed out that 'one of the cent
ral concerns raised by the petitioners in
volves the proper role, if any, of a research
institution like Hoover within the Univer
sity."
Prof. Alphonse )uiHand, chairman of the
French and Italian Department and the in
itiator of the counter-petition said Ken
nedy's response "seems highly reason
able."
"If they (the original petitioners) had
started out from the beginning with substan
tive questions about the budget and ap
pointments, I would have signed the original
petition myself," jui Hand said. "However,
they started by playing up the political angle
and Hoover responded."
