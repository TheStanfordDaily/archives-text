## Men surprise No. 1 SMU and win NCAA final match 
### TOM MOORE 
The men's tennis team dis
played classical form in Athens
(Georgia) yesterday, whipping
top-seeded Southern Method
ist University to claim the
NCAA title for the second time
in three years.
Last year the men's team did
not even receive an invitation
to the tournament, but coach
Dick Gould rebuilt the team by
recruiting a freshmen-studded
line-up.
Relying once again on su
perb singles play and rallying
around Jim Grabb's come from
behind victory at N0.6 singles,
the Cardinal took a 4-2 advan
tage in doubles play and never
looked back.
Behind 3-2 in the deciding
set, Grabb broke service and
rode a booming service attack
to defeat Mark Stuslinger 1-6,
7-5, 6-4, and rovide Stanford
with its cu'hion entering
doubles. "I w-is never really
worried," said Grabb. "I
thought I was serving pretty
well and I only needed to break
his service once more. It was a
good match."
Boosted by Grabb's win, an

inspired Letts/Davis team out
lasted SMU's van't Hof/Korita
duo 7-6, 6-4 to clinch the
crown. The other doubles
squads defaulted their contests
to join the celebration. "We
were all a little nervous out
there," said John Letts of the
doubles play. "We wanted to
win it as quickly as possible."
Earlier Letts also captured his
first singles win of the touna
ment beating Korita 6-4, 7-6.
Scott Davis continued his
torrid play at the top position.
Davis, who has not lost a set
thoughout the tourney, de
stroyed Rodney Harmon 6-4,
7-5 in singles. "I wasn't sur
prised that we beat SMU," he
commented. "We've had a
winning attitude all season and
it paid off."
Teammate Dan Goldie
agreed with Davis. "We just
played the way we've been
playing all season and it
worked out."
Though seeded second, the
Card was not really considered
as a viable choice to beat SMU
at the start of the tourney.
Freshman Eric Rosenfeld said
he felt that helped the team.

"We had no real pressure on us
from the start. We were just
happy to be here and we were
ready to play," he said.
Team captain Mark McKeen
added, "It was a great incentive
to be out there and win. We be
lieved in ourselves even
though we were disregarded.
All those 23 wins (Stanford had
won 23 of their last 24 matches)
meant nothing now. It was our
chance to take the final step."
With only veteran Davis
playing in his second tourney,
the Card took an extremely
young team to Athens. Coach
Dick Gould praised the team's
success. "Everybody played
well throughout the year. It's
been a great season." Gould
commended juniors Davis and
McKeen for providing leader
ship throughout the year as
well for the Card rookie net
ters.
Individual tournament play
begins Thursday. Davis, Goldie
and Letts are competing in sin
gles competition. The
Davis/Letts and
McKeen/Grabb teams will also
vie for the doubles title.
