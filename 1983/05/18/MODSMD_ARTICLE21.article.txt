# Women face disappointment at NCAA tourney
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Albuquerque, N.M.—lt was a storybook
setting with an unfitting ending.
Stanford lost to UCLA 5-4 yesterday in
the consolation final at the NCAA Wom
en's Tennis Championships here. But it
was how it lost that ruined the Hollywood
script.
While Stanford and UCLA battled it out
on the Lobo Tennis Club's back courts,
USC was busy beating Trinity to end Stan
ford's year-long reign as NCAA champion.
Yesterday's match for third place had
little importance for the Cardinal as far as
team standings are concerned. "If we're
the No. 4 team in the country or the No. 3
team in the country, it doesn't make much
difference to me," coach Frank Brennan
said Monday night.
But for senior team captain Caryn Cope
land, the match did matter.
"I had a personal reason for winning
because it was my last match," she said.
The stage was set for Copeland to go out
with a victory in exciting fashion. With the
team score knotted at 4-4, the match
hinged on Copeland and Michelle Weiss'
No. 2 doubles contest against UCLA's
Karen Dewis and Helena Manset.

The Bruin pair won the first set 6-2, and
were leading the second 2-0. But Cope
land and Weiss charged back to take the
second set and send the match to a third.
The two teams battled back and forth in
the third set, desparately trying to break
each other's serve, but to no avail. Finally,
the match came down to a tie-breaker.
"It couldn't have been more perfect for
it to come down to our match—the last
match, Copeland said. And what an ideal
way for Copeland to end her career at
Stanford: a tie-breaker win in the third set
to decide a match at the NCAAs.
But that final page in the storybook was
ripped out and replaced by another one:
Copeland and Weiss lost the tie-breaker
7-4, the set 7-6, the doubles match 2-1 and
the team match 5-4.
"Everything was going our way," Cope
land said "I thought the luck was on our
side.
"I didn't think we were going to lose
until we actually lost that last point."
Unlike Stanford's two previous
matches, the Cardinal was the one who
assumed the early lead this time, not its
opponent.
Copeland, at No. 4, Weiss at No. 5 and

Linda Gates at No. 2 finished off their op
ponents in straight sets as Stanford
jumped to a 3-1 lead. Only Alison Hatdey,
celebrating her 21st birthday, had lost.
In the other two singles matches, No. 1
and No. 3 Elise Burgin and Alyce Werdel
had won second sets after losing the first.
However, Werdel surrendered quickly to
Dewis, losing 6-1 in the third while Burgin
and UCLA's Heather Ludloff fought to a
match deciding tie-breaker.
Burgin led 6-5 in the tie-breaker, but
Ludloff fought off the match point and
scored two more on volley winners to cap
ture the game, set and match.
It was Burgin's second straight singles
setback and her fourth loss in her last six
matches, before which she was 16-0.
