A's blank Twins
Minnesota — Wayne Gross hit a home
run in the top of the ninth inning to give
the Oakland A's a 7-0 lead over the Min
nesota Twins. What appeared to be just ic
ing on the cake turned out to be the in
gredient the A's needed to hold off a six
run rally in the bottom of the ninth that
included four home runs.
"They sure did a job on that 7-0 lead,"
said catcher Bob Kearney, whose three
run homer off Minnesota's Brad Havens
in the second inning started the scoring.
"I haven't seen that in a long time, if ever.
What are those guys eating over there?"
Oakland's Mike Norris and Matt
Keough blanked the Twins on five hits un
til the ninth, when Dave Beard took over

and was greeted by consecutive home
runs by pinch hitter Dave Engle and Bob
by Mitchell. Gary Gaetti hit a two-run,
two-out shot with John Castino aboard
via a walk and, after Beard walked Tom
Brunansky, pinch hitter Mickey Hatcher
greeted Tom Burgmeier with the fourth
home run of the inning to make it 7-6.
Lenny Faedo singled, but Engle, batting
for the second time in the inning, struck
out to end the game.
Giants fall to Phillies
Philadelphia — Right-hander John Denny
pitched seven scoreless innings and sin
gled in a run as the Philadelphia Phillies
beat the San Francisco Giants 2-1 last
night.
Denny struck out six and walked two in
upping his record to 4-2. Reliever Al
Holland hurled the final two innings — al
lowing Bob Brenly's homer in the ninth —
to gain his first save. Brenly's one-out
homer was his third of the season.
Rookie Andy McGaffigan, 4-2, took the
loss.
The Phillies scored twice in the second
inning as Bo Diaz beat out an infield hit

and went to third on Garry Maddox's
double. Larry Milbourne hit a sacrifice fly
and Denny drove in the second run with a
two-out single off the third-base bag.
Giant Manager Frank Robinson pro
tested the game, claiming that plate um
pire Charlie Williams was allowing
Holland to blow on his pitching hand
while on the mound.
Islanders win Cup
landers completed a stunning four-game
sweep for their fourth straight Stanley
Cup, riding first-period goals 1:37 apart
by Bryan Trottier, John Tonelli and Mike
Bossy to a 4-2 victory over the Edmonton
Oilers last night.
The Islanders rocked the Oilers with
that early three-goal lead, then held on in
the face of a spirited comeback by Ed
monton to become only the second Na
tional Hockey League franchise to cap
ture four consecutive titles. The Montreal
Canadiens won five from 1956-60 and
four from 1976-79.
Ken Morrow's empty-net goal with

1:09 remaining, his second of the series,
clinched the championship.
Bossy got the Cup-winning goal for the
second year in a row and had five game
winning goals in these playoffs, an NHL
record. He led all playoff goal-scorers
with 17.
But New York couldn't have extended
its victory streak to 16 series without the
unfaltering goaltending of Billy Smith.
The only player left from the Islanders'
first team in 1972, Smith was steady
throughout the post-season and spec
tacular against Edmonton. He was named
winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as the
playoffs' most valuable player.
Invaders beat Federals
Oakland — Ted Besana threw four
touchdown passes, one more than the
Washington Federals' Mike Hohensee,
leading the Oakland Invaders to a 34-27
United States Football League victory
Monday night.
Washington drove to the Oakland 2-
yard line in the closing minutes, was
pushed back to the 7 by a damaging de
lay-of-game penalty, and Hohensee was

stopped at the 1 as he tried to score on a
quarterback draw play with 1:22 left.
Oakland, 5-6, moved into a tie with Los
Angeles for first place in the Pacific
Division. Washington lost its seventh
straight game and dropped to 1-10.
Hohensee's touchdown passes all went
to wide receiver Mike Holmes, on plays
covering 6, 80 and 21 yards.
Besana raised hisseason TD pass total to
15.
