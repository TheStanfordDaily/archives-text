## 
### JASON COLE Staff Writer 
The renovation of the School ot
Education's Cubberley Auditorium is
drawing to a close, with University
officials hoping for completion by
lune 11. The project is approximately
a month behind its original schedule,
but that comes as no surprise to
Susan Crawford, office services
manager for the School of Education.
"It's a little delayed, but not seri
ously. Considering things I've seen
at Stanford, I don't think it's bad,"
Crawford said.
When work is completed the au
ditorium will have new seals, im
proved lighting, a new catwalk for
theatrical events, a deeper stage,
more room backstage, improved
audio qualities and folding arm desks
on chairs for classes. The new seats
will be upholstered in three shades
of purple and red in alternating rows.
"We're having a lot of grumbling
and some praise for the color
scheme. We wanted something with
a little pizzazz," Crawford said, ad
ding that she felt it was also "warm
and vibrant."
The auditorium will also be some
what smaller, seating about 400
people including the balcony, ac
cording to Crawford.
Renovation became necessary
when, in Crawford's words, "Whole
rows of seats were falling over and it
was really getting dangerous. The
lights were terrible and the air circu
lation was non-existent."
Construction began Dec. 6 after a
planning committee, with represen
tatives from the Office of Events and
Services, Registrars Office, Planning
Office, provost, Construction Office
and Communication Department,
approved renovation plans. The cost
of renovation will be about $400,000.
