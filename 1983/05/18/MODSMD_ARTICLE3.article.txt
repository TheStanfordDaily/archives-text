# Students decry ASSU McCloskey remarks
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Last night's event-filled final meet
ing of the ASSU Senate saw the re
signation of one ASSU Guest Profes
sorship Board member, the presen
tation of two student petitions and
the passage of several important bills,
as well as a mock "terrorist" attack
perpetrated by a group of Chaparral
staff members.
GPB member David Marks submit
ted his resignation to the senate as a
"formal protest to the treatment" of
Guest Prof. Paul "Pete" McCloskey.
Two weeks ago, the senate voted
unanimously to disassociate itself
from McCloskey's "anti-Semitic"
remarks.
Marks "objected vehemently" to
the board's practice of reviewing the
course reading materials "on the
grounds that this practice infringed
on McCloskey's academic freedom."
Marks did not accuse anyone of
deliberately attempting to sabotage
the class "because that would be too
hard to prove," he said. But he
characterized ASSU treatment of the
course as "unprofessional."
Two petitions relating to the
McCloskey class were also presented
to the board. One petition, signed by
40 percent of the students enrolled in
the class and presented by sopho
more |eff Au, resolved that students
in the class "disassociate ourselves
from, and disclaim any responsibility
for, the ASSU's and ASSU Guest Pro
fessorship Board's recent anti-
McCloskey actions and remarks."
Another petition, submitted by
seniors Tracy Field and Dave Stucky
and signed by 150 students, criticized
the "unwarranted, paternalistic role
of the ASSU . . .attempt to censure
academic materials presented in

courses taught by guest professors."
Field said the two came up with the
idea for the petition after a discus
sion "over lunch with (Political Sci
ence Prof. David) Abernethy about
the course." Neither Field nor Stucky
are students in the class.
"We don't feel the ASSU is accu
rately representing us on this issue,"
Stucky said.
Although a bill which would have
significantly reorganized most ASSU
service organizations was tabled by
the senate until nextyear, the section
of the bill dealing with administra
tion of the GPB was passed by a large
margin. The bill defines more
explicitly the responsibilities and
powers of the GPB.
Au questioned the GPB reorgani
zation bill which permits the GPB,
"upon breach of contract, or with
just cause (to) take any remedial ac
tion available to it, including, but not
limited to revoking the title of, ad
justing the salary of or dismissing a
guest professor."
Graduate senator Roland Van
Gaalen agreed with Au. "This gives
excessive power to the core (GPB)
committee," he said.
As of the final acts as member
of the Council of Presidents (COP),
Rod Beckstrom delivered the "State
of the Association (ASSU) Address"
to Ihe senate. Looking back over "a
year of hard work and solid accomp
lishments," Beckstrom suggested
that next year's senate "carefully bal
ance the relative amounts of time
spent on service projects and on stu
dent advocacy," noting that this year
there has been an "undesirable shift
toward the advocacy of special polit
ical interests which are not so clearly
the political interests of the student
