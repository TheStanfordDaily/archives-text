# Students decry ASSU McCloskey remarks
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Last night's event-filled final meet
ing of the ASSU Senate saw the re
signation of one ASSU Guest Profes
sorship Board member, the presen
tation of two student petitions and
the passage of several important bills,
as well as a mock "terrorist" attack
perpetrated by a group of Chaparral
staff members.
GPB member David Marks submit
ted his resignation to the senate as a
"formal protest to the treatment" of
Guest Prof. Paul "Pete" McCloskey.
Two weeks ago, the senate voted
unanimously to disassociate itself
from McCloskey's "anti-Semitic"
remarks.
Marks "objected vehemently" to
the board's practice of reviewing the
course reading materials "on the
grounds that this practice infringed
on McCloskey's academic freedom."
Marks did not accuse anyone of
deliberately attempting to sabotage
the class "because that would be too
hard to prove," he said. But he
characterized ASSU treatment of the
course as "unprofessional."
Two petitions relating to the
McCloskey class were also presented
to the board. One petition, signed by
40 percent of the students enrolled in
the class and presented by sopho
more |eff Au, resolved that students
in the class "disassociate ourselves
from, and disclaim any responsibility
for, the ASSU's and ASSU Guest Pro
fessorship Board's recent anti-
McCloskey actions and remarks."
Another petition, submitted by
seniors Tracy Field and Dave Stucky
and signed by 150 students, criticized
the "unwarranted, paternalistic role
of the ASSU . . .attempt to censure
academic materials presented in

courses taught by guest professors."
Field said the two came up with the
idea for the petition after a discus
sion "over lunch with (Political Sci
ence Prof. David) Abernethy about
the course." Neither Field nor Stucky
are students in the class.
"We don't feel the ASSU is accu
rately representing us on this issue,"
Stucky said.
Although a bill which would have
significantly reorganized most ASSU
service organizations was tabled by
the senate until nextyear, the section
of the bill dealing with administra
tion of the GPB was passed by a large
margin. The bill defines more
explicitly the responsibilities and
powers of the GPB.
Au questioned the GPB reorgani
zation bill which permits the GPB,
"upon breach of contract, or with
just cause (to) take any remedial ac
tion available to it, including, but not
limited to revoking the title of, ad
justing the salary of or dismissing a
guest professor."
Graduate senator Roland Van
Gaalen agreed with Au. "This gives
excessive power to the core (GPB)
committee," he said.
As of the final acts as member
of the Council of Presidents (COP),
Rod Beckstrom delivered the "State
of the Association (ASSU) Address"
to Ihe senate. Looking back over "a
year of hard work and solid accomp
lishments," Beckstrom suggested
that next year's senate "carefully bal
ance the relative amounts of time
spent on service projects and on stu
dent advocacy," noting that this year
there has been an "undesirable shift
toward the advocacy of special polit
ical interests which are not so clearly
the political interests of the student

body at large."
Regarding ASSU projects and ac
tivities, Beckstrom said the "per
formance of the Coffee House was
the poorest of all" but said that "the
Flicks, T-shirt Service and the Linen
Service performed very well." He
warned that the ASSU Course Guide
is "threatened by the desire of some
faculty for tighter restraints."
Beckstrom also criticized a recent
"surge" in the amount of paperwork
required in ASSU processes which
"seemed to obscure the real issues."
An election reform bill passes
unanimously. Bill author Roc Blu
menthal said the bill makes a provi
sion for appeal of election commis
sion rulings and clears up several
ambiguities. "Essentially we tried to
take into account all the problems we
encountered this year," he said.
Co-directors for next year's CPB
were also approved by the senate,
sophomore Nathan Brostrom and
freshman Enrique Lerner told the
senate thev would continue the CPB
policy of reviewing the reading mate
rials of guest professors. Brostrom
said he hoped the review would be a
cooperative effort between the pro
fessor, the CPB and whatever
academic department might be in
volved.
The senate passed unanimously
the recommendations of the Nomi
nations Committee for students po
sitions on next year's University
committees. Some senators ex
pressed frustration at having to rely
so heavily on the Nominations
Committee's recommendations.
A stop-gap resolution which will
permit ASSU Recycling to continue
functioning until )une 10 was passed
unanimously. Regarding Universitv
subsidy of the service, COP member
Mark Epstein said, "They can't
guarantee us anything but they are
optimistic."
Just as the meeting wound down,
and another chapter in senate history
was about to come to a close, the
senators were interrupted by a group
of five students dressed in army
fatigues, wearing masks and carrying
fake weapons. The mock terrorists
threw firecrackers onto the floor of
the senate, yelled unintelligible slo
gans and attacked senators with
cream pies.
Graduate senator Jim McCrath and
COP member-elect Vinnie Freda
were among the casualties.
