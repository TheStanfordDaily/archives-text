Israel, Lebanon sign pact
Israel and Lebanon signed their troop
withdrawal agreement yesterday and an an
gry Syria launched a blockade of road traffic
between Lebanon and the rest of the Arab
world.
Saudi Arabia gave the pact guarded sup
port, and banners supporting the agree
ment appeared in several Beirut neighbor
hoods. But Lebanese troops opened fire
during a demonstration by about 100 pro-
Iranian Shiites opposing the pact, and sever
al people were wounded.
The U.S.-sponsored agreement providing
for the withdrawal of the 25,000 Israeli

troops in central and southern Lebanon was
signed in twin ceremonies by the three
diplomats who did most of the negotiating:
David Kimche, director-general of the Is
raeli Foreign Ministry; Ambassador Antoine
Fattal of Lebanon and Morris Draper, a spe
cial U.S. Middle East envoy.
"If we sign this agreement with you, it is
because Lebanon has an urgent need for
tranquility and order," Fattal told Kimche
after they signed the 37-page text in the
south Beirut suburb of Khalde.
The Israeli negotiator hailed the accord as
a "new chapter in our history." He said
nothing about the possibility that it might
not take effect because of Syrian refusal to

withdraw its 40,000 troops and the 8000 to
12,000 Palestinian guerrillas in northern and
eastern Lebanon
Without mentioning Syria by name, Presi
dent Reagan in Washington called on "Leb
anon's friends" to support the agreement.
Reagan to fight higher taxes
Washington — President Reagan said last
night "it is time to draw the line" in his
budget battle with Congress and vowed to
veto any bill that would raise taxes while the
nation is emerging from recession.
Fielding questions at his 17th formal news
conference, Reagan posted the same warn

ing against spending increases that might
"rekindle the fires of inflation and high in
terest rates."
Reagan is confronting Republicans as
well as Democrats as Congress works to
complete a fiscal 1984 budget that cuts defi
cits below his own plan.
In an effort to trim deficits below the $189
billion level proposed by Reagan, the Dem
ocrat-controlled House has approved a plan
calling for a $30 billion tax increase in fiscal
1984 The Senate is still trying to break a
deadlock over the size of a new tax increase.
v
Reagan told reporters he'd wait and see whether to
accept the virtually certain vote of Congress to repeal
the withholding of income taxes from interest and
dividend payments. Earlier he had threatened to veto
repeal, but he said now,"l understandthere'stalkofa
compromise. I'm going to wait and see what they
come up with on the Hill."
House repeals withholding tax
Washington — Rejecting pleas from its leaders, the
House voted overwhelmingly yesterday to repeal the
controversial 10 percent withholding tax on dividend
and interest income that Congress had incorporated
in last summer's $98.3 billion tax bill.
By a 382-41 margin, House members thus killed a
measure that the nation's banks had lobbied against
vigorously by encouraging an outpouring of protest
letters from savings depositors. The bill now goes to
the Senate, where a measure delaying the tax
withholding passed last month.
President Reagan has vowed repeatedly to veto
outright repeal of the interest-withholding law,
which is scheduled to take effect July 1. The president
as well as House and Senate leaders have argued that
this added tax collection tool is badly needed at a time
of deficit spending.
However, the wide margin of victory in the House
— and the equally lopsided 91-5 Senate vote last
month — appear to make the repeal movement veto
proof. A two-thirds majority is needed in each
chamber to override a presidential veto.
Congress approves MX plan
Washington — President Reagan yesterday hailed
what he called an emerging bi-partisan consensus on
arms control and said such cooperation "can show
the Soviets that we Americans stand united, ready to
negotiate in good faith until we succeed in reducing
the level of nuclear weapons on both sides."
The president, speaking only hours afterthe House
Appropriations Committee voted 30-26 to approve
his plan to deploy 100 MX missies in existing
Minutemen silos in Wyoming and Nebraska, called
congressional consideration of the missile plan "one
of the most important arms control votes of the Con
gress."
The favorable vote on the MX resulted largely from
Reagan's personal lobbying, coupled with his written
assurances to Congress last week that he will seriously
seek an arms control agreement with the Soviets and
will heed the recommendations of his bi-partisan
Commission on Strategic Forces, which was headed
by Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Advisor
under President Ford.
Reagan, in a prepared statement opening his first
full-scale White House press conference in three
months, enthusiastically embraced the Scowcroft
Commission's recommendations. "Their report com
bined in one package three of our top priority goals
— modernization, deterrence and arms control," he
said.
Senate confirms Ruckelshaus
Washington — William Ruckelshaus was confirmed
unanimously yesterday to head the Environmental
Protection Agency, instructed to not only resurrect
EPA's tarnished integrity but to restore the agency as a
guardian of public health.
The Senate vote was 97-0 to return Ruckelshaus to
the post he held as the agency's first administrator. He
is expected to take his oath of office today at the
White House.
Ruckelshaus was chosen by President Reagan to
succeed Anne Burford, the controversial former ad

ministrator who resigned under the pressure of a half
dozen congressional investigations into allegations of
mismanagement, political manipulation and sweet
heart deals with polluters.
Immigration bill nears approval
Washington — The Senate, moving toward ex
pected passage today of a massive immigration re
form bill, agreed by voice vote yesterday that farmers
may continue to hire some illegal aliens during a
three-year phase-in of the reform program.
The amendment was particularly crucial to Western
growers who, according to the Department of Labor,
currently rely on illegal aliens to harvest their most
perishable crops.
However, the Senate on a 59-26 vote rebuffed an ef
fort by the American Civil Liberties Union and repre
sentatives of minority groups to add provisions aimed
at preventing discrimination by employers against
workers because of their national origin.
Nitze, Soviets negotiate on arms
Geneva, Switzerland — The United States began
exploring with the Soviet Union yesterday a proposal
to limit nuclear warheads in Europe as an interim step
toward banishing medium-range missiles from the
Continent.
The outlook for an accord was unclear after U.S. ne
gotiator Paul Nitze met for two hours with his Soviet
counterpart, Yuli Kvitsinsky. Another session was
scheduled for tomorrow.
The Soviets already have condemned the U.S. pro
posal as a scheme to impose a "unilateral reduction"
of the missiles targeted on Western Europe. Privately,
American officials do not expect a breakthrough in
the current round, the fourth since the talks were
opened in November 1981.
Court upholds ban on cameras
Washington — News organizations have failed in a
major constitutional assault on a 50-year ban against
electronic and still-photography coverage of federal
courtroom proceedings.
The Supreme Court, acting without a recorded dis
sent Monday, left intact a ruling that the blanket ban
does not violate free-speech rights guaranteed by the
Constitution's First Amendment.
The Post-Newsweek television stations in Florida,
the Community Television Foundation of South Flori
da, which operatesa publictelevision station, and The
Miami Herald Publishing Co. challenged the
courtroom coverage ban imposed during the trial of
U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings.
Stocks climb after retreat
A late flurry of buying sent stock prices higher yes
terday, reversing early losses and halting a sharp re
treat.
Ten stocks rose for every seven that fell on the New
York Stock Exchange. The Dow Jones average of 30 in
dustrials, down 15.77 points Monday and off nearly 6
more points midway through the session, closed at
1205.79 with a gain of 2.81 points.
The resilience of the market's best-known indicator
at the 1200 level indicated continued optimism
among traders, analysts said.

to limit nuclear warheads in Europe as an interim step
toward banishing medium-range missiles from the
Continent.
The outlook for an accord was unclear after U.S. ne
gotiator Paul Nitze met for two hours with his Soviet
counterpart, Yuli Kvitsinsky. Another session was
scheduled for tomorrow.
The Soviets already have condemned the U.S. pro
posal as a scheme to impose a "unilateral reduction"
of the missiles targeted on Western Europe. Privately,
American officials do not expect a breakthrough in
the current round, the fourth since the talks were
opened in November 1981.
Court upholds ban on cameras
Washington — News organizations have failed in a
major constitutional assault on a 50-year ban against
electronic and still-photography coverage of federal
courtroom proceedings.
The Supreme Court, acting without a recorded dis
sent Monday, left intact a ruling that the blanket ban
does not violate free-speech rights guaranteed by the
Constitution's First Amendment.
The Post-Newsweek television stations in Florida,
the Community Television Foundation of South Flori
da, which operatesa publictelevision station, and The
Miami Herald Publishing Co. challenged the
courtroom coverage ban imposed during the trial of
U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings.

Israel, Lebanon sign pact
Israel and Lebanon signed their troop
withdrawal agreement yesterday and an an
gry Syria launched a blockade of road traffic
between Lebanon and the rest of the Arab
world.
Saudi Arabia gave the pact guarded sup
port, and banners supporting the agree
ment appeared in several Beirut neighbor
hoods. But Lebanese troops opened fire
during a demonstration by about 100 pro-
Iranian Shiites opposing the pact, and sever
al people were wounded.
The U.S.-sponsored agreement providing
for the withdrawal of the 25,000 Israeli

troops in central and southern Lebanon was
signed in twin ceremonies by the three
diplomats who did most of the negotiating:
David Kimche, director-general of the Is
raeli Foreign Ministry; Ambassador Antoine
Fattal of Lebanon and Morris Draper, a spe
cial U.S. Middle East envoy.
"If we sign this agreement with you, it is
because Lebanon has an urgent need for
tranquility and order," Fattal told Kimche
after they signed the 37-page text in the
south Beirut suburb of Khalde.
The Israeli negotiator hailed the accord as
a "new chapter in our history." He said
nothing about the possibility that it might
not take effect because of Syrian refusal to

withdraw its 40,000 troops and the 8000 to
12,000 Palestinian guerrillas in northern and
eastern Lebanon
Without mentioning Syria by name, Presi
dent Reagan in Washington called on "Leb
anon's friends" to support the agreement.
Reagan to fight higher taxes
Washington — President Reagan said last
night "it is time to draw the line" in his
budget battle with Congress and vowed to
veto any bill that would raise taxes while the
nation is emerging from recession.
Fielding questions at his 17th formal news
conference, Reagan posted the same warn

ing against spending increases that might
"rekindle the fires of inflation and high in
terest rates."
Reagan is confronting Republicans as
well as Democrats as Congress works to
complete a fiscal 1984 budget that cuts defi
cits below his own plan.
In an effort to trim deficits below the $189
billion level proposed by Reagan, the Dem
ocrat-controlled House has approved a plan
calling for a $30 billion tax increase in fiscal
1984 The Senate is still trying to break a
deadlock over the size of a new tax increase.
v
Reagan told reporters he'd wait and see whether to
accept the virtually certain vote of Congress to repeal
the withholding of income taxes from interest and
dividend payments. Earlier he had threatened to veto
repeal, but he said now,"l understandthere'stalkofa
compromise. I'm going to wait and see what they
come up with on the Hill."
House repeals withholding tax
Washington — Rejecting pleas from its leaders, the
House voted overwhelmingly yesterday to repeal the
controversial 10 percent withholding tax on dividend
and interest income that Congress had incorporated
in last summer's $98.3 billion tax bill.
By a 382-41 margin, House members thus killed a
measure that the nation's banks had lobbied against
vigorously by encouraging an outpouring of protest
letters from savings depositors. The bill now goes to
the Senate, where a measure delaying the tax
withholding passed last month.
President Reagan has vowed repeatedly to veto
outright repeal of the interest-withholding law,
which is scheduled to take effect July 1. The president
as well as House and Senate leaders have argued that
this added tax collection tool is badly needed at a time
of deficit spending.
However, the wide margin of victory in the House
— and the equally lopsided 91-5 Senate vote last
month — appear to make the repeal movement veto
proof. A two-thirds majority is needed in each
chamber to override a presidential veto.
Congress approves MX plan
Washington — President Reagan yesterday hailed
what he called an emerging bi-partisan consensus on
arms control and said such cooperation "can show
the Soviets that we Americans stand united, ready to
negotiate in good faith until we succeed in reducing
the level of nuclear weapons on both sides."
The president, speaking only hours afterthe House
Appropriations Committee voted 30-26 to approve
his plan to deploy 100 MX missies in existing
Minutemen silos in Wyoming and Nebraska, called
congressional consideration of the missile plan "one
of the most important arms control votes of the Con
gress."
The favorable vote on the MX resulted largely from
Reagan's personal lobbying, coupled with his written
assurances to Congress last week that he will seriously
seek an arms control agreement with the Soviets and
will heed the recommendations of his bi-partisan
Commission on Strategic Forces, which was headed
by Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Advisor
under President Ford.
Reagan, in a prepared statement opening his first
full-scale White House press conference in three
months, enthusiastically embraced the Scowcroft
Commission's recommendations. "Their report com
bined in one package three of our top priority goals
— modernization, deterrence and arms control," he
said.
Senate confirms Ruckelshaus
Washington — William Ruckelshaus was confirmed
unanimously yesterday to head the Environmental
Protection Agency, instructed to not only resurrect
EPA's tarnished integrity but to restore the agency as a
guardian of public health.
The Senate vote was 97-0 to return Ruckelshaus to
the post he held as the agency's first administrator. He
is expected to take his oath of office today at the
White House.
Ruckelshaus was chosen by President Reagan to
succeed Anne Burford, the controversial former ad

ministrator who resigned under the pressure of a half
dozen congressional investigations into allegations of
mismanagement, political manipulation and sweet
heart deals with polluters.
Immigration bill nears approval
Washington — The Senate, moving toward ex
pected passage today of a massive immigration re
form bill, agreed by voice vote yesterday that farmers
may continue to hire some illegal aliens during a
three-year phase-in of the reform program.
The amendment was particularly crucial to Western
growers who, according to the Department of Labor,
currently rely on illegal aliens to harvest their most
perishable crops.
However, the Senate on a 59-26 vote rebuffed an ef
fort by the American Civil Liberties Union and repre
sentatives of minority groups to add provisions aimed
at preventing discrimination by employers against
workers because of their national origin.

his plan to deploy 100 MX missies in existing
Minutemen silos in Wyoming and Nebraska, called
congressional consideration of the missile plan "one
of the most important arms control votes of the Con
gress."
The favorable vote on the MX resulted largely from
Reagan's personal lobbying, coupled with his written
assurances to Congress last week that he will seriously
seek an arms control agreement with the Soviets and
will heed the recommendations of his bi-partisan
Commission on Strategic Forces, which was headed
by Brent Scowcroft, former National Security Advisor
under President Ford.
Reagan, in a prepared statement opening his first
full-scale White House press conference in three
months, enthusiastically embraced the Scowcroft
Commission's recommendations. "Their report com
bined in one package three of our top priority goals
— modernization, deterrence and arms control," he
said.
Senate confirms Ruckelshaus
Washington — William Ruckelshaus was confirmed
unanimously yesterday to head the Environmental
Protection Agency, instructed to not only resurrect
EPA's tarnished integrity but to restore the agency as a
guardian of public health.
The Senate vote was 97-0 to return Ruckelshaus to
the post he held as the agency's first administrator. He
is expected to take his oath of office today at the
White House.
Ruckelshaus was chosen by President Reagan to
succeed Anne Burford, the controversial former ad

ministrator who resigned under the pressure of a half
dozen congressional investigations into allegations of
mismanagement, political manipulation and sweet
heart deals with polluters.
Immigration bill nears approval
Washington — The Senate, moving toward ex
pected passage today of a massive immigration re
form bill, agreed by voice vote yesterday that farmers
may continue to hire some illegal aliens during a
three-year phase-in of the reform program.
The amendment was particularly crucial to Western
growers who, according to the Department of Labor,
currently rely on illegal aliens to harvest their most
perishable crops.
However, the Senate on a 59-26 vote rebuffed an ef
fort by the American Civil Liberties Union and repre
sentatives of minority groups to add provisions aimed
at preventing discrimination by employers against
workers because of their national origin.
Nitze, Soviets negotiate on arms
Geneva, Switzerland — The United States began
exploring with the Soviet Union yesterday a proposal
to limit nuclear warheads in Europe as an interim step
toward banishing medium-range missiles from the
Continent.
The outlook for an accord was unclear after U.S. ne
gotiator Paul Nitze met for two hours with his Soviet
counterpart, Yuli Kvitsinsky. Another session was
scheduled for tomorrow.
The Soviets already have condemned the U.S. pro
posal as a scheme to impose a "unilateral reduction"
of the missiles targeted on Western Europe. Privately,
American officials do not expect a breakthrough in
the current round, the fourth since the talks were
opened in November 1981.
Court upholds ban on cameras
Washington — News organizations have failed in a
major constitutional assault on a 50-year ban against
electronic and still-photography coverage of federal
courtroom proceedings.
The Supreme Court, acting without a recorded dis
sent Monday, left intact a ruling that the blanket ban
does not violate free-speech rights guaranteed by the
Constitution's First Amendment.
The Post-Newsweek television stations in Florida,
the Community Television Foundation of South Flori
da, which operatesa publictelevision station, and The
Miami Herald Publishing Co. challenged the
courtroom coverage ban imposed during the trial of
U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings.
