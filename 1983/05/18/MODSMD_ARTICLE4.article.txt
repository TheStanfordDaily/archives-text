Israel, Lebanon sign pact
Israel and Lebanon signed their troop
withdrawal agreement yesterday and an an
gry Syria launched a blockade of road traffic
between Lebanon and the rest of the Arab
world.
Saudi Arabia gave the pact guarded sup
port, and banners supporting the agree
ment appeared in several Beirut neighbor
hoods. But Lebanese troops opened fire
during a demonstration by about 100 pro-
Iranian Shiites opposing the pact, and sever
al people were wounded.
The U.S.-sponsored agreement providing
for the withdrawal of the 25,000 Israeli

troops in central and southern Lebanon was
signed in twin ceremonies by the three
diplomats who did most of the negotiating:
David Kimche, director-general of the Is
raeli Foreign Ministry; Ambassador Antoine
Fattal of Lebanon and Morris Draper, a spe
cial U.S. Middle East envoy.
"If we sign this agreement with you, it is
because Lebanon has an urgent need for
tranquility and order," Fattal told Kimche
after they signed the 37-page text in the
south Beirut suburb of Khalde.
The Israeli negotiator hailed the accord as
a "new chapter in our history." He said
nothing about the possibility that it might
not take effect because of Syrian refusal to

withdraw its 40,000 troops and the 8000 to
12,000 Palestinian guerrillas in northern and
eastern Lebanon
Without mentioning Syria by name, Presi
dent Reagan in Washington called on "Leb
anon's friends" to support the agreement.
Reagan to fight higher taxes
Washington â€” President Reagan said last
night "it is time to draw the line" in his
budget battle with Congress and vowed to
veto any bill that would raise taxes while the
nation is emerging from recession.
Fielding questions at his 17th formal news
conference, Reagan posted the same warn

ing against spending increases that might
"rekindle the fires of inflation and high in
terest rates."
Reagan is confronting Republicans as
well as Democrats as Congress works to
complete a fiscal 1984 budget that cuts defi
cits below his own plan.
In an effort to trim deficits below the $189
billion level proposed by Reagan, the Dem
ocrat-controlled House has approved a plan
calling for a $30 billion tax increase in fiscal
1984 The Senate is still trying to break a
deadlock over the size of a new tax increase.
