negotiations are successful.
"We're very close to an agreement
with Haley, and we're pursuing
negotiations in good faith with
Potok," said Seth Linfield, head of
the GPB.
Haley would probably teach a
broad survey course on American lit
erature, Linfield said. The English
Department has also expressed
interest in having Haley teach a
course on Afro-American writers.
Haley is the author of Roots and
Autobiography of Malcolm X. Two
plagiarism suits against him, which
were recently settled out of court,
have raised some controversy over
his appointment. But English De
partment Chairman Robert
Polhemus said this was not a major
concern.
The main barriers are logistical, ac
cording to Polhemus. "He only
wants to teach one day a week, and
that could pose a problem," said
Polhemus. "We'll have to see if he
cart teach what we need, when we
need it."
Though five people have been
contacted and have expressed inter
est in teaching, nothing is final at this
stage. Three guest professors will be
chosen for next year, with Haley and
Potok currently the leading candi
dates.
The GPB has also contacted H.A.
Raskin, dean of labor reporters and
former New York Times chief labor
correspondent, Douglas Fraser,
former president of the United Auto
Workers (UAW) and former con
gressman Father Robert Drinan.
"Nothing is definite at this point,
but we hope to know before the end
of the school year," said Linfield.
Potok, the author of The Chosen
and My Name is Asher Lev, would
probably teach a class on the philos
ophy of literature in the modern
period. He has taught this class be
fore at the University of Pennsylva
nia, but said he would "teach it
differently" here.
"I think teaching at Stanford would
be a marvelous prospect," he said.
Potok s appointment is less defini
tive that Haley's, according to Lin
field. "There's a problem with find
ing adequate schooling tor his son
