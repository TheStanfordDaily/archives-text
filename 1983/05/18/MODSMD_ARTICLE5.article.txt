Writers Alex Haley and Chaim
Potok may teach here next winter
quarter it Guest Professorship Board
negotiations are successful.
"We're very close to an agreement
with Haley, and we're pursuing
negotiations in good faith with
Potok," said Seth Linfield, head of
the GPB.
Haley would probably teach a
broad survey course on American lit
erature, Linfield said. The English
Department has also expressed
interest in having Haley teach a
course on Afro-American writers.
Haley is the author of Roots and
Autobiography of Malcolm X. Two
plagiarism suits against him, which
were recently settled out of court,
have raised some controversy over
his appointment. But English De
partment Chairman Robert
Polhemus said this was not a major
concern.
The main barriers are logistical, ac
cording to Polhemus. "He only
wants to teach one day a week, and
that could pose a problem," said
Polhemus. "We'll have to see if he
cart teach what we need, when we
need it."
Though five people have been
contacted and have expressed inter
est in teaching, nothing is final at this
stage. Three guest professors will be
chosen for next year, with Haley and
Potok currently the leading candi
dates.
The GPB has also contacted H.A.
Raskin, dean of labor reporters and
former New York Times chief labor
correspondent, Douglas Fraser,
former president of the United Auto
Workers (UAW) and former con
gressman Father Robert Drinan.
"Nothing is definite at this point,
but we hope to know before the end
of the school year," said Linfield.
Potok, the author of The Chosen
and My Name is Asher Lev, would
probably teach a class on the philos
ophy of literature in the modern
period. He has taught this class be
fore at the University of Pennsylva
nia, but said he would "teach it
differently" here.
"I think teaching at Stanford would
be a marvelous prospect," he said.
Potok s appointment is less defini
tive that Haley's, according to Lin
field. "There's a problem with find
ing adequate schooling tor his son
and housing for himself and his
wife," Linfield said.
Raskin, the third most likely candi
date, has taught at the Columbia
School of Business and would possi
bly be teaching a course through the
Communication Department in the
fall.
"I would like to teach a course on
labor relations as distinct from jour
nalism," said Raskin. "I'm very in
trigued by the idea
Fraser, an expert on new trend in
labor-management relations, might
be teaching a class next spring on
industrial relations and the history of
the labor movement. He retired last
week as UAW president and has
served as a member of the board of
directors of Chrysler Corporation.
Drinan, a Jesuit priest who was
asked by the Pope to resign his con
gressional post because of conflict
ing interests, may teach a course on
arms control and nuclear disarma
ment. He is a professor of law at

Georgetown University, a former
dean of the Boston College School of
Law, and an expert on nuclear arms
issues.
The five possible guest professors
were chosen from a list of 250 names
compiled by the GPB.
"We've contacted a diverse group
of people," said Linfield. "We're try
ing to move away from retired politi
cians and more toward writers, ar
tists and scientists."
Scientists cannot afford to leave
their labs to teach, Linfield said, ad
ding, "We are currently negotiating
with a world-famous biologist for fall
of 1984, though," he said.
The professors will each be paid
$7500 for the quarter. Their housing,
airfare and expenses will also be
covered. "The departments they're
in may also contribute," said Lin
field. The GPB can seek outside
sources of funding but they must
remain anonymous.
Guest professors must be accre
dited by the department in which
they will teach and approved by the
ASSU Senate.

Georgetown University, a former
dean of the Boston College School of
Law, and an expert on nuclear arms
issues.
The five possible guest professors
were chosen from a list of 250 names
compiled by the GPB.
"We've contacted a diverse group
of people," said Linfield. "We're try
ing to move away from retired politi
cians and more toward writers, ar
tists and scientists."
Scientists cannot afford to leave
their labs to teach, Linfield said, ad
ding, "We are currently negotiating
with a world-famous biologist for fall
of 1984, though," he said.
The professors will each be paid
$7500 for the quarter. Their housing,
airfare and expenses will also be
covered. "The departments they're
in may also contribute," said Lin
field. The GPB can seek outside
sources of funding but they must
remain anonymous.
Guest professors must be accre
dited by the department in which
they will teach and approved by the
ASSU Senate.
