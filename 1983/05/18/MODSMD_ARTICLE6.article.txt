## Communists make journalism tough 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
Bradley Martin said he got an interview with a top
policy-maker in North Korea because officials there sus
pected him of being a CIA agent.
Martin, who was then a correspondent for the Balti
more Sun, was granted the interview so the Korean gov
ernment could voice opinions on problems there. He
said he thinks the officials assumed he was a CIA agent
because he spent nine hours interviewing one Korean
bureaucrat.
I was really having problems getting information out
of the guy,' Martin said in explaining the lengthy inter
view.
Martin, who will work for the Asian Wall Street Journal
after he finishes studying here, joined fellow Profes
sional lournalism Fellows Klas Bergman, the Washing
ton correspondent for the Swedish Dagens Nyheter,
Glenn Frankel, who will cover Zimbabwe for the Wash
ington Post, and Kalpana Sharma, who works for the
Indian Himmat Fortnightly, in discussing the problems
of reporting in areas with information constraints before
a small group in Roble Lounge last night. Student repor
ters Tahirih Lee, loan O'Connell and Hillary Wood con
tributed to the discussion.
Both Martin, who covered China, Japan and South
Korea as well as North Korea, and Bergman, who
covered Eastern Furope for a Stockholm daily, agreed

that the totalitarian nature of these Communist coun
tries makes reporting there difficult.
Martin said because of Chinese controls, reporters
there "felt lucky if we could talk to a real human being
from time to time."
In North Korea, for example, the guides who had been
assigned to give him tours of the city where he was
staying would wait by the hotel's one exit to make sure
he did not see areas the government had not planned for
him to see.
But one afternoon Martin fooled his guides by pre
tending to nap. While they "took a siesta," he toured the
city, only to find out that he was being followed by
plainclothes police. He soon returned to his hotel.
Bergman said that though Eastern European countries
rarely harass foreign journalists, he had difficulties de
veloping contacts there.
"It's difficult to speak to people on the street. They
don't want to talk to foreign journalists," he said. Often
to contact sources he had to "sneak out to a phone
booth around the corner" to talk to them.
Bergman said one contact he made in Romania was
sentenced to three years in prison for talking to him.
Frankel pointed out that democracies often restrict
information too. When he was covering the Falkland
Islands war for the Washington Post, the British govern
ment manipulated journalists by withholding bad news
until it could be released concurrent with good news.


REPORTERS SPEAK OUT: Last night journalists spoke
to students in Roble lounge about the constraints
placed on their reporting while in foreign countries.
