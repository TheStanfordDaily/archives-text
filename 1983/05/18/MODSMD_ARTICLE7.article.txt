# Dean to respond to Honor Code charges
## 
### JULIE HAGEN Staff writer 
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Norm Wessells will soon respond to
Council of Presidents member Mark
Epstein's charges that a chemistry
professor violated the Honor Code
by proctoring exams.
Epstein recently sent letters "mak
ing his statement'' about the issue to
Wessells, Ombudsman John Co
heen and Assoc. Dean of Humanities
and Sciences David Kennedy, but he
refused to comment on the issue.
Epstein also met recently with Ken
nedy to discuss the issue.
Wessells' response will take the
form of a letter to Epstein. He would
not say what his response will be, but
said that "the Honor Code is working
very well."
Early in April, Epstein charged
Chemistry Prof, james Collman with
allowing teaching assistants to re
main in the final examination room
while students took an exam, thus
proctoring the exam, which is clearly
forbidden in the Honor Code.
So far, no official University action
has been taken on the issue, and
members of the Honor Code
Commission have deemed unlikely
the possibility of such action.

Wessells said the content of his let
ter is still under revision and is sub
ject to review by his colleagues be
fore he can comment on it. He did
not plan to issue any public state
ment on the matter.
Kennedy said the issue has be
come a general one: the question of

whether proctoring actually consti
tutes a violation, whether proctoring
is occurring, and what action should
actually be taken since there is "no
real faculty interest at stake."
Kennedy said, "The essence of this
thing has nothing to do with Col
lman," adding that it was no longer a
specific incident being discussed.
Collman, who said he had not
been contacted concerning the issue
since the original claim was filed,
said he was no longer interested in
anything concerning Epstein. "In no
way am I going to let it affect anything
I do. . . . I'll do exactly what I've
done for 16 years. As far as I'm con
cerned the issue is over."
In 16 years he has never received a
complaint from any student actually
enrolled in his class, Collman said.
Again this year his class seems to
have received generally positive
feedback on the course evaluations
completed by students.
Epstein said that since he was leav
ing office as a COP member Friday, it
would be up to the future COP to
follow up on the issue.
Peter Spivack, COP member-elect,
said the matter could be pursued in
two ways. First, Epstein has the right
to follow up the charge as an indi
vidual student. Second, the Honor
Code Commission couldtake further
action.
Confusion has existed regarding
the selection process of Honor Code
Commission members. It was Eps
tein's impression that the Nomina
tions Commission selected three
students to serve on the Honor Code
Commission, and a COP member
could sit in as the fourth student rep
resentation.
But the charge as interpreted by
the University seems to indicate that
the Nominations Commission
selects all four members while the
COP only has the power to designate
a chairperson from among the four.
Spivack said that unless a COP
member was selected asa memberof
the Honor Code Commission, the
COP would likely leave any future
action up to the commission itself.
Although Epstein has attended his
last senate meeting in his present
post, administrators say the Honor
Code controversy appears far from
over.
