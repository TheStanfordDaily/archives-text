# The
						Farm's future look: the Planning Office's responsibility
## 
### ELISE CHAPIN 
Although some find it dif
ficult to believe, the University
does have a construction plan.
Rumors that buildings are ran
domly placed around campus
are unfounded. "The aesthetic
consciousness of the Univer
sity" is preserved by the Plan
ning Office, according to
Campus Planner Judy Chan.
The Lund Use
published by the Planning Of
fice, outlined two plans for the
structural and environmental
organization of the central
campus. The first is a short
range plan for the next five
years, while the second en
compasses the next 30 years.
The book contains maps
with the environmental sen
sitivity composite, hydrog
raphy, slope stability and other
little-known facts about the
University's 8180 acres of land.
Because of environmental
variables, it is impossible to
rigidly plan for the future. Un
expected heavy rains and
flooding during the past two
years posed a problem the
University previously had not
considered seriously. But now
the University must plan for
these natural disasters.
Although the Planning Of
fice has its own set of priorities,
this list is subject to change if
community members voice
new concerns.
It would be nice to know
exactly what needs to be built
and when. But Chan said, "It is
important to plan but also to be
flexible. We may need another
SLAC."
Aside from large projects,
the Planning Office is also wor
ried about smaller scale prob
lems, such as the lack of space
in Wilbur and Stern bath
rooms.
Chan said the campus "will
see a change in academic
facilities as well as support ser
vice facilities" in the next few
years.
The Planning Office has di
vided the University's land ac
cording to uses. The two main
categories are academic and
Unversity support.
The academic areas com
prise not only the inner cam
pus, but areas such as SLAC,
jasper Ridge, the Hoover In
stitution, the Food Research
Institute and the athletic
facilities.
Areas such as the Stanford
Shopping Center, Palo Alto
Square and the faculty housing
developments provide income
to the University and thus the
Planning Office considers
them University support areas.
The Planning Office next de
termines the future uses of
these areas.
While the University does
not plan to construct many

new high-rise buildings, it will
be redeveloping the existing
structures.
The lecent reconstruction of
the History Corner is an exam
ple of the type of modification
that will be most prevalent in
the future
Areas such as the "sci-tech
quad," the west side of campus
and the Medical Center will
undergo the most drastic
changes, according to Chan.
The "sci-tech quad ' is the area
including the Central Energy
facility, the Hansen Labora
tories, the electronics labs, the
petroleum engineering build
ing and the Hepl End Station.
The University hurriedly
built many of these buildings
during World War 11. As a re
sult, they are not as efficient as
they could be, said Chan.
The addition of the Gover
nor's Cornercomplex and Ster
ling Quadrangle marks the be
ginning of the development of
the west side of campus. The
land west of Campus Drive is
vacant. The lanci which is cur
rently the driving range may
also be developed. The driving
range would then be relo
cated.
Currently, the new Animal
Research Facility is part of a
plan to expand the Medical
Center.
As in most city planning, the
Planning Office realizes that it
must do "planning on all
different levels" and consider
the impact of all decisions on
many different departments,
Chan said.

The Planning Office main
tains contact through the
ASSU's Committee on Land
arid Development. Doug Kes
sler, a student member of the
committee said that the com
mittee meets once a month. In
addition to the regular mem
bers of the committee, includ
ing representatives from "geo,
history and art," there are also
"people who represent Uni
versity business operations
such as Facilities and Services,"
Kessler said.
The parking problem is an
issue currently under
campus-wide debate. While
some members of the commu
nity think more parking space
is needed, the addition of con
crete tiers would change the
atmosphere of the campus.
The Planning Office has set
up a committee on transporta
tion, and it will probably have a
recommendation for the office
within the year.
But the parking problem is
the result of another Planning
Office decision made during
the energy crisis of the mid
-19705: the Carpenter Report.
At the time planners assumed
that fewer people would be
driving cars and that more
would utilize public transpor
tation and bicycles.
Because of this, parts of

Lomita Drive, Galvez Street
and Lasuen Street were made
into malls, thereby eliminating
parking space.
Marguerite bus service was
also initiated to bring drivers to
and from their cars which were
parked on the edge of campus.
Bollards also sealed off the
inner core of the campus and
made it more oriented toward
pedestrians and bicycles.
But as Chan said, "human
behavior says, I want to go to
the front door'," and many
were frustrated that they no
longer could drive up to their
offices. Even today, Â»vith the
restrictions on traffic, service
vehicles can still be seen travel
ing through White Plaza
The five-year plan outlines a
plan for the new music build
ing currently under construc
tion, a fieldhouse next to Fn
cino Gym, the Governor's
Corner and Independent hous
ing projects and expansion of
faculty housing on Peter
Coutts Hill.
Plans for better vehicle circu
lation were also ini luded, such
as the extensions of Campus
Drive to lurnpero Serra
Boulevard, Lomita Drive to
Campus, Welch Road to Cam
pus and Willow Road to El
Camino Real.
In addition to planning new
construction, the University
has also begun a vegetation
management plan. This is an at
tempt to maintain the atmos
phere of "being at the Farm,"
Chan said.
One of the problems with
campus vegetation it this point
is that the youngest oak trees
are 30 or 40 years old. The fatt
that acorns have been unable
to get enough water to germi
nate or that the grazing cattle
have eaten them has reduced
the oak population so that
there are few. if anv, new oaks.
The Planning Office has di
vided the reforestation plan
into three stages. Presently,
they only have funding for
stage one, which involves the
i foothills and the west campus
area.
