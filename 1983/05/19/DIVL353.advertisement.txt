RIVER TRIPS
AS LOW AS
PER PERSON'
Raft the spectacular rapids
of California's Sierra rivers
Run rapids with the evocative names of Troublemaker,
Meatgrinder and Triple Threat on the American; crash down the
Tuolumne; float the Truckee or the Carson in Nevada (alas the
damn builders have drowned the Stanislaus) These and other
Sierra rivers await the adventurous who feel that "gusto ' is more
than a can of beer Rent a raft capable of carrying six to nine
complete with paddles, life vests, bailers and life lines, for only
$100 per day ('see eight of you can do it for only $12 50 each).
