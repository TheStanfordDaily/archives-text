# Scholars to review Mosher expulsion
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
Three nationally known scholars
will review the case of former an
thropology, Ph.D. candidate Steven
Mosher, who was dismissed from the
University Feb. 24 for "illegal and
unethical conduct," Norman Wes
sells, dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, an
nounced yesterday.

Emeritus Profs. Gordon Wright
and Ernest Hilgard and University of
Pennsylvania Prof. Ernest
Goodenough will serve as grievance
officers.
Wessells said, "I tried to get the
best individuals I could find who had
not had any contact with the depart
ment, with Mosher, or with China."
The Anthropology Department
expelled Mosher for engaging in "il
legal and unethical conduct" while
doing field research in the People's
Republic of China. Mosher's griev
ance maintains he was deprived of
his rights under the University's reg-

ulations governing student conduct.
The committee will act primarily as
an investigative body. Wessells will
take no part in the proceedings of the
committee except to be sure the in
vestigation is fair. Coodenough, Hil
gard and Wright have all pledged to
maintain the confidentiality of the
case's details. Claiming it would en
danger people in China, the Univer
sity has declined to release the spe
cific reasons for Mosher's dismissal
and this mystery has given rise to a
nation-wide debate.
Wessells said he has found three
people with an "impeccable sense of
fairness" to review the Mosher case.
Goodenough is a nationally known
anthropologist and curator of the
Oceania Ethnology Museum in
Pennsylvania. Wright is former pres
ident of the American Historical As
sociation, and Hilgard is former pres
ident of the American Psychological
Association.
Throughout the debate surround
ing his conduct, Mosher has blamed
his review and subsequent expulsion
on a popular Taiwan press article he
wrote documenting forced abortions
in China and on "slanderous" allega
tions by his former wife.
The committee should make a re
port to Wessells by June 30, but its
recommendations will not be bind
ing on Wessells' decision.
"The decision is my own," Wes
sells said. "But I think I would natu
rally give great weight to what such a
distinguished group of people would
recommend."
If Wessells ultimately upholds the
Anthropology Department's action,
Mosher may file a grievance with
Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost and
dean of graduate studies and re
search.
