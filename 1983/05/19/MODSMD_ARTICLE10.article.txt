## Democrats criticize covert action

Compiled from news reports and wire services
Covert U.S. aid to guerrillas fighting the
leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua
has strengthened international support
for the Sandinistas and has failed to stop
them from helping to train and arm leftist
rebels in nearby El Salvador, the Democra
tic majority of the House Intelligence
Committee said in a report released Mon
day.

'The acid test is that the Sal
vadoran insurgents continue
to be well-armed and
supplied. They have grown
in numbers and have
launched more and longer
offensives. All this requires
an uninterrupted flow of
arms/

The Reagan administration has "allowed
the spotlight of international opprobrium
to shift from Sandinista attempts to sub
vert a neighboring government (in El Sal
vador) to a U.S. attempt to subvert that of
Nicaragua," the committee's nine Democ
rats concluded in the unprecedented re

port about an ongoing CIA covert opera
tion.
Significantly, they agree with the Reagan
administration's contention that the San
dinistas have helped give communist
backed rebels in El Salvador logistical sup
port, training and arms.
According to the report, available intel
ligence information shows "with cer
tainty" that "a major portion of the arms
and other material sent by Cuba and other
communist countries to the Salvadoran in
surgents transits Nicaragua with the per
mission and assistance of the Sandinista.
This arms flow has not been interrupted,
the Democrats concluded, by covert CIA
support for about 7000 anti-Sandinista
guerrillas in Nicaragua. "The acid test is
that the Salvadoran insurgents continue to
be well armed and supplied," the report
said. "They have grown in numbers and
have launched more and longer offensives.
All this requires an uninterrupted flow of
arms."
"There are certainly a number of ways to
interdict arms, but developing a sizeable
military force and deploying it in
Nicaragua is one which strains credibility
as an operation only to interdict arms," the
Democrats said in the report.
But the committee's five Republicans is
sued a dissenting conclusion that the

covert operation has been successful in
deterring arms shipments. Cutting it off,

'Having twice sent U.S.
troops to Nicaragua in this
century, this country has
once again been cast in the
role of interventionist.'

as the committee's Democratic majority
has voted to do, would hand "a legisla
tively engineered victory" to the Sandinis
tas, the Republicans said.
"The Sandinista Nicaraguan govern
ment marks the first foothold of Marxism
on the mainland in our Western Hemis
phere," they said. "With only a modicum
of help from the United States democracy
can flourish in Central America."
The Democrats argued in the 44-page
report that U.S. support for the anti-
Sandinista insurgents has had "entirely
opposite results" from those intended.
"Having twice sent U.S. troops to
Nicaragua in this century, this country has
once again been cast in the role of inter
ventionist."
