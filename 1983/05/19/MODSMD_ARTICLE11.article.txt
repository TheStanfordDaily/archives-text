# Costa Rica tries to stay neutral
## Guerrillas strike across border 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
Striking by surprise, usually in small boats,
guerrilla bands have turned the jungle swamp
lands of southern Nicaragua into a second front
against the Sandanista government.
Although the fighting here is on a smaller
scale than that resulting from Nicaraguan exile
attacks along the Honduran border, it is exten
sive.
Fighting along Nicaragua's Costa Rican border
flared last week from the Caribbean shore to
points near the Pacific.
The rebels, operating out of clandestine bases
in neutral Costa Rica, have launched a campaign
to command the San luan River, a vital waterway
that reaches the Nicaraguan heartland and
forms part of the frontier between the two coun
tries.
Costa Rica's democratic, outspokenly anti
communist government insists that it is seeking
to remain neutral, but that it lacks the troops to
prevent clashes as the anti-Sandinista guerrillas
operated along its border. Costa Rica has asked
four countries for an international peacekeep
ing force, but the countries—Mexico, Colom
bia, Venezuala and Panama—said Friday they
would send only civilian observers, two from
each country, to monitor activity along the bor
der.
Last week, a force of the Sandino Revolutio
nary Front, which is headed by the breakaway
Sandanista leader Eden Pastora, reported that it
had raided a government outpost at Barro Del
Rio Maiz, 40 miles north of the border on the
Caribbean coast. The Sandino Front's com
munique said 48 government troops and 12 of its
own were killed in the fighting, which would
make it the heaviest battle yet on the southern
front.
Aides of Pastora, who was known as Com
mander Zero when he was fighting with the
Sandinistas to topple Nicaragua's Somoza
dynasty, say he is "inside Nicaragua." They did
not say whether he led the attack. Rebel
spokesmen say that other attacks have taken
place this month on the western side of the
country: at Rivas and San Jorge on the narrow
isthmus between Lake Nicaragua and the Pacific
Ocean; at Cardenas and San Carlos on the lake's
southern shore and at San Francisco, Fatima and
El Castillo.
Early this month, Nicaraguan patrols regularly
cruised the San )uan, checking and sometimes
harassing tourists making the jungle trip up
river. The Costa Rican government charged that
Nicaraguan sailors kidnapped two Costa Ricans
they suspected of being "contras" —
counterrevolutionaries— on the Costa Rican
side of the river.
Subsequently, Pastora's men sank a Nicara
guan patrol boat, killing two men and capturing
an officer, and raids on Sandanista outposts fol
lowed. River pilots say the Nicaraguans now
rarely go out on the river and have withdrawn
from outposts they fear they cannot defend.
The Nicaraguans have commandeered private
yachts in an effort to increase the Sandanista
forces' ability to fight on the rivers and lakes.
They used a converted fishing boat recently to
capture three civilian U.S. sailors off the Carib
bean shore. The Americans were later released.
The Nicaraguans are known to have some
powerful East German patrol boats, but in re
cent weeks they have been unable to operate on
the San luan, which is navigable in the dry sea
son only by outboard skiffs.
Now, however, the six-month rainy season is
beginning and the big boats would be able to

patrol from the Caribbean to Lake Nicaragua—if
they could use Costa Rica's Colorado River for
acces. The San Juan's mouth is too heavily silted
for large vessels to pass. It is doubtful that Costa
Rica would let war vessels sail up the Colorado
to the San )uan, as they do Nicaragua's civilian
craft.
If the rebel forces can maintain control of the
San juan, they will have access to the more than
100-mile-long lake that stretches north almost to
Managua.
Pastora's forces are operating in a loose, and
at times uneasy, alliance with those of Francisco
Chamorro, another breakaway Sandinista
leader. Chamorro's forces are operating on the
western side of the San )uan, Pastora's on the
eastern side.
"We work in coordination with Pastora," said
a spokeman for the Chamorro group, the
Nicaraguan Revolutionary Armed Forces, who
gave his name only as Adan. "But we are more
middle-of-the-road. We are opposed to dic
tatorships of both the right and the left."
Pastora's front has refused to accept CIA aid
or cooperate with exile groups in Honduras
whose leaders include former Somoza officers.
Chamorro's group broke with Pastora and his
allies on this point last lanuary. Chamorro has
since agreed to cooperate with the forces work
ing out of Honduras.
Both Pastora's and Chamorro's people con
sider themselves true Sandanistas and say the
men running the Managua government sold out
the revolution to the Cubans.
A third rebel group organized in San Jose is
the southern branch of the Misurasata, three
Indian tribes indigenous to the Caribbean coast.
The Indians are asking to for autonomy for join
ing with the southern front.
The groups of the south have broader popular
support than those from Honduras, who in the
eyes of Nicaraguans are tainted by Somoza as
sociation. For this reason, leader of the south
ern front say they are a bigger threat to Managua
than the northern groups. Most diplomatic ob
servers in San Jose agree.
The anti-Sandinista rebels operating out of
Costa Rica number "in the hundreds," and
those inthe north, operating out of Honduras
from 1500 to 4000, according to diplomatic
sources.
The Sandinista government in Managua is re
ported to have an army of 25,000.
The officials said that 1000 Nicaraguans have
joined Pastora's guerrillas in that time, including
more than 100 government soldiers. Pastora, 46,
a leader of the Sandinista revolution that over
threw the regime of Anastasio Somoza, now
heads an alliance of counterrevolutionary
groups seeking to overthrow the Managua gov
ernment. Alfonso Robelo, another leader of the
alliance, said Monday that Pastora's operations
had been more successful than expected.
"The first step was to win a place where we
could operate freely, and this has been ac
complished already," Robelo said in an inter
view at the San Jose headquarters of the Democ
ratic Revolutionary Alliance, an umbrella or
ganization for the rebels based along
Nicaragua's Costa Rican border.
Pastora's spokesman in San Jose say that
young men inside Nicaragua are enlisting in his
forces as they raid villages and towns there. And
people in Barra Colorado, 15 miles down the
Colorado River from the San Juan, tell of seeing
young men in groups of three or four looking for
transport "up the river."
And up the river lies the war.
