## Differing answers to grading question 
### SID ATKINS Senior staff writer 
Whether viewing grades
as feedback on personal
performance or as society's
ultimate judgment, profes
sors recently interviewed by
the Daily generally referred
to grading as the least fa
vored part of their jobs.
"It's no fun," said Com
munication Department
Chairman Henry Breitrose.
"I don't enjoy sitting in
judgment of others."
James Adams, associate
dean of the School of En
gineering, said he wished
students would have the
chance to grade a class
themselves. "The unfortu
nate thing is that students
don't get to see the other
end of grading. I think if
they did, people would un
derstand what they really
meant, and a lot wouldn't
put so much importance on
them."
Adams added, "It's pos
sible to live well without
having straight A's in
school."
Grading here has not fol
lowed a completely tradi
tional path. In fact, when
the University first came
into being there were no
grades at all. A system of
"reference letters" was
used to provide feedback to
students in their courses,
according to Adams.
Even now Stanford does
not compile overall grade
point averages or class rank
ings as most other univer
sities do.
Even with the present sys
tem, History Prof. Barton
Bernstein said he "worries
deeply" about grades.
"When there is only a
final in a class, I worry about
the value of the grade. It's a
bit mercurial," said Berns
tein. "There's always the
danger that a student will
just have a bad day."
Bernstein also said grade
inflation hurts the student.
"When you have a col
lapsed grade scale between
C + and A, a student may get
a faulty impression of how
well he's doing," he said.
Adams agreed that the

University operates with a
collapsed grading scale.
"An A + or aD- is an ex
pression of passion to a stu
dent," he said.
Chemistry Prof. Hans An
dersen said he realized that
grades function as neces
sary motivation for stu
dents.

But Andersen said he felt
students worry too much
about grades here and don't
always take courses out of
interest. "It's my impres
sion that undergraduates
spend an inordinate
amount of time studying.
There are lots of other
things to do in college," he
said.
Art Department Chair
man Lorenz Eitner offered a
sober viewpoint. "Grades
are serious," he said. "They
are supposed to represent
reality — to say if something
is right or wrong. When I
give a student a bad grade, I
remind him that he has fal
len short of something out
side the department — life,
reality."
Eitner said it is harmful
when too many high grades
are given in a department or
school. "If everything gets
slack, it puts students to
sleep. It takes the drama out
of working hard," he said.
When things don't work
out — the grade is bad —
professors are concerned
about student reaction.
Breitrose said he was
made very unhappy by stu
dents who felt that one poor

grade was going to ruin
their future. "To have a stu
dent get hysterical about
whether he deserved an A
or an A - in a class is crazi
ness. A student takes 35 to
40 courses while here and
no one course means that
much," he said.
Art Prof. Dwight Miller
said he can understand why
students react so sensitively
to a single poor grade.
' They genuinely believe
that their whole profes
sional life depends on it. A
pre-medical student almost
always gets the point at ross
to me that his whole career
may be blighteci by a bad
grade I may give him in an
introductory art class," he
said.
Miller said he thinks that
grades do not indicate
exactly how a student is
doing anymore, but that he
could not think of a better
way to evaluate perform
ance. "Grades are a neces
sary evil. They provide the
kind of discipline that most
students need to make
them get more out of a
course," he said.
Though grades may be a
"necessary evil," there are
various ways of approach
ing the problem.
Breitrose cited Oxford,
England, as an example of
an alternative system where
students take one set of
exams during their whole
undergraduate career.
"There's no serious grading
before that. As a senior, you
sit for University exams, and
receive either a first, a sec
ond or a pass for a grade."
Students complaining
about grades may just be an
inevitable part of any
academic evaluation sys
tem, according to many pro
fessors.
Breitrose said he knew of
a professor whose final
exam always asked students
to make up three questions
pertaining to the course,
answer two and then grade
themselves.
"He would get a perfect
curve and would still have
students come in to comp
lain," Breitrose said.

"I don't enjoy sitting in
judgment of others."
James Adams, associate
dean of the School of En
gineering, said he wished
students would have the
chance to grade a class
themselves. "The unfortu
nate thing is that students
don't get to see the other
end of grading. I think if
they did, people would un
derstand what they really
meant, and a lot wouldn't
put so much importance on
them."
Adams added, "It's pos
sible to live well without
having straight A's in
school."
Grading here has not fol
lowed a completely tradi
tional path. In fact, when
the University first came
into being there were no
grades at all. A system of
"reference letters" was
used to provide feedback to
students in their courses,
according to Adams.
Even now Stanford does
not compile overall grade
point averages or class rank
ings as most other univer
sities do.
Even with the present sys
tem, History Prof. Barton
Bernstein said he "worries
deeply" about grades.
"When there is only a
final in a class, I worry about
the value of the grade. It's a
bit mercurial," said Berns
tein. "There's always the
danger that a student will
just have a bad day."
Bernstein also said grade
inflation hurts the student.
"When you have a col
lapsed grade scale between
C + and A, a student may get
a faulty impression of how
well he's doing," he said.
Adams agreed that the

University operates with a
collapsed grading scale.
"An A + or aD- is an ex
pression of passion to a stu
dent," he said.
Chemistry Prof. Hans An
dersen said he realized that
grades function as neces
sary motivation for stu
dents.

But Andersen said he felt
students worry too much
about grades here and don't
always take courses out of
interest. "It's my impres
sion that undergraduates
spend an inordinate
amount of time studying.
There are lots of other
things to do in college," he
said.
Art Department Chair
man Lorenz Eitner offered a
sober viewpoint. "Grades
are serious," he said. "They
are supposed to represent
reality — to say if something
is right or wrong. When I
give a student a bad grade, I
remind him that he has fal
len short of something out
side the department — life,
reality."
Eitner said it is harmful
when too many high grades
are given in a department or
school. "If everything gets
slack, it puts students to
sleep. It takes the drama out
of working hard," he said.
When things don't work
out — the grade is bad —
professors are concerned
about student reaction.
Breitrose said he was
made very unhappy by stu
dents who felt that one poor

grade was going to ruin
their future. "To have a stu
dent get hysterical about
whether he deserved an A
or an A - in a class is crazi
ness. A student takes 35 to
40 courses while here and
no one course means that
much," he said.
Art Prof. Dwight Miller
said he can understand why
students react so sensitively
to a single poor grade.
' They genuinely believe
that their whole profes
sional life depends on it. A
pre-medical student almost
always gets the point at ross
to me that his whole career
may be blighteci by a bad
grade I may give him in an
introductory art class," he
said.
Miller said he thinks that
grades do not indicate
exactly how a student is
doing anymore, but that he
could not think of a better
way to evaluate perform
ance. "Grades are a neces
sary evil. They provide the
kind of discipline that most
students need to make
them get more out of a
course," he said.
Though grades may be a
"necessary evil," there are
various ways of approach
ing the problem.
Breitrose cited Oxford,
England, as an example of
an alternative system where
students take one set of
exams during their whole
undergraduate career.
"There's no serious grading
before that. As a senior, you
sit for University exams, and
receive either a first, a sec
ond or a pass for a grade."
Students complaining
about grades may just be an
inevitable part of any
academic evaluation sys
tem, according to many pro
fessors.
Breitrose said he knew of
a professor whose final
exam always asked students
to make up three questions
pertaining to the course,
answer two and then grade
themselves.
"He would get a perfect
curve and would still have
students come in to comp
lain," Breitrose said.
