1 he news media has thoroughly documented
a nationwide preoccupation with cocaine. The
death of actor John Belushi, the arrest of busi
nessman Ralph DeLorean and the economy of
Dade County, Florida have made headlines and
stirred an interest in their common factor: a
white powder classified medically as an al
kaloid, legally as a narcotic and on the streets as
a highly lucrative enterprise.
Cocaine has had its effect on the University as
well. The large concentration of young,
affluent, trendy students has created a high on
campus demand for the drug. And, not surpris
ingly, a handful of enterprising students has
accepted risks of arrest, theft and personal ad
diction in the hopes of realizing a profit. This
seems rather foolhardy when the risks to the
students could ruin the future they are sup
posedly here to ensure. Chances are slight,
however, that many campus dealers will be re
formed by this, or any, newspaper article.
The University has a responsibility toward the
health of its students and the strength of its

reputation. On-campus cocaine dealers
threaten bothof theseand place the administra
tion in a dilemma. The only guaranteed way of
dealing with the problem is to alert police to the
activities of individuals, but this created exactly
the kind of publicity the University would rather
avoid.
What the University has done is to confront
resident advisers with the University's knowl
edge of illegal activities in several student
residences. This action seems to have some
what stifled the flow of drugs into the campus.
Unfortunately, in protecting individuals by
dealing with the problem through residences
and then discussing these actions with the
press, the University inadvertently harms
everyone who lives there. The reputation of liv
ing in a "drug-house" is something that most
residents don't deserve and certainly don't de
sire. When dealing with campus drug problems,
the administration should use a bit more discre
tion.
