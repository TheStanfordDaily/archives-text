# It will be standing room only at Stanford's commencement

It's the toughest ticket in town. Tougher
than Gandhi. Tougher than Big Came.
Tougher than The King and I. Even tougher
than a ticket to see the annual Lake Lagunita
nude kayak racing championships.
You can't buy it in stores, at Ticketron, or
through any special TV offer. We're talking
about the big one — a ticket to the Leland
Stanford Junior University Commencement
Exercises, 1983 version.
To get your hands on this hot little item,
you have to be a student "actually marching
in the Academic Procession," to quote the
form letter I received from University Events
and Services. I was slightly alarmed when I
first read this. I wasn't planning on march
ing. I thought I'd do a basic shuffle. But I
called Fvents and Services and they said that
was okay.
However, my relief was short-lived. When

I read on, I discovered that each eligible
student is entitled to three tickets and ONLY
three tickets to the big event. I need seven —
mom, dad, sister one, sister two, brother
in-law, grandmother A, grandmother B (I'm
terrible with names). But three's the limit.
Vou can't get more unless you're lucky
enough to know someone whose entire fam
ily was wiped out in a terrible airplane crash.
Tickets are limited, of course, because
Frost Amphitheater simply doesn't hold too
many people. One obvious solution might
be to move the ceremony to the football
stadium. Sure, you'd lose some of the inti
macy of Frost. But at least everyone who
wanted to could get a ticket. The Band could
put on a big halftime show, all the graduat
ing seniors could wear helmets, and Don
Kennedy could shave his head and pretend
he was Paul Wiggin. Hey, we could make a
real party out of this thing!

The current ceremony, after all, is not
exactly bubbling with excitement. Every
body marches (or shuffles) in at the same
time, wearing the same outfit in the same
color. Kennedy says a few words, the com
mencement speaker says a few words and
poof — it's all over. Why, even the name
could use a little punching up: "Com
mencement Exercises." Sounds like some
thing you'd find in the first chapter of lane
Fonda's Workout Book.
In general, it doesn't seem to me that this
is going to be the most exciting day of my
four years at Stanford or even the most excit
ing day that weekend. All things considered,
I'd rather be at the Oakland Coliseum on
June 12 watching the A's-White Sox doub
leheader. They can mail the diploma to me
(COD, of course).
Unfortunately, the rest of the Mitchel clan
doesn't feel this way. They can't wait to

come out west for graduation weekend. My
sisters and brother-in-law want to see me in
a cap and gown. My mother wants to cry (she
also cries at weddings and at old Jerry Lewis
movies). My dad wants to meet John Elway,
and my grandmothers want the free trip to
San Francisco. I told them all that this thingis
nothing special; it's going to be just like my
high school graduation, except I won't be
wearing a blue tux.
Nevertheless, they all want tickets, which
poses a bit of a problem. As I see it, I have a
couple of options. I can sell my tickets to the
three highest-bidding family members,
which might not be very fair but would cer
tainly be fairly profitable. Or, my two
grandmothers could beat up a security
guard and sneak into Frost with my sisters.
There is, of course, a third option. That is,
some senior out there will take pity on me
and my family and sell me a few tickets. Oh, I

know I don't deserve extra tickets any more
than you do, just because my dad shoveled
manure 18 hours a day for 30 years in order
to save enough money to send me to Stan
ford. Or, just because my mother sold col
ored shoelaces on the street corner to pay
for my books. Or, just because my two
grandmothers have been lugging bricks to
the top of the John Hancock Building for 10
cents a day, for the past four years, just so I'd
have enough money to buy a hot meal every
two weeks.
No, I don't deserve any special treatment.
But just in case you've got any extra tickets,
HELP. I'll pay big bucks, and I'll even throw in
a pair of box seats to the A's-White Sox doub
leheader.
