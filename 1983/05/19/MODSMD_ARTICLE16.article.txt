## Original Hoover petition built on shaky academic standards 
### 
As a foreign citizen at the Hoover, I am neither a
Democrat nor a Republican (when I first became a Fel
low here I had always voted Labour at home, though I
was never asked about this or about any other political
matter . . . ).
However, if I may contribute something from British
experience to the debate, my first academic post was the
the LSE — the London School of Economics and Political
Science. A part, though a largely autonomous part, of
London University, its Founding Father was the socialist
theoretician and politician Sidney Webb, and the head
of its Political Science Department was chairman of the
Labour Party; it boasted of its role not merely among the
leading cadres of the Labour Party, but also in left-wing
parties and governments throughout the Common
wealth.
It came in for a good deal of attack and criticism, but as
tar as I know it was never suggested that there was
anything academically wrong about the situation,
perhaps because everyone remembered that a certain
concentration of the like-minded has often proved
academically fruitful — as with the "Cambridge school"
of philosophy, the "Chicago school" of economics, the
"Vienna school," the "Frankfurt school." The most I
ever heard as a complaint in the academic context was

that the position was "anomalous," to which the reply of
a socialist colleague was that the opposite of anomaly is
entropy . . .
I do think that one academic issue arises in the present
controversy. The original anti-Hoover petition contains,
quite apart from dubious argument, simple errors of fact
— that the Hoover has made an "almost total" shift to
domestic studies; that it is not bound by the academic
prohibition of political discrimination in hiring; that its
share of University funds is $4 million; that its research
fellows are not subject to University approval.
The true facts are easily available. Those who drafted
the petition have therefore shown themselves either
incapable of, or unwilling to undertake, research even
of this very simple nature — an academic disqualifica
tion, surely. (And I may add that since those who signed
the petition were induced to do so by untrue assump
tions, their signatures must, by all reasonable standards,
be deemed invalid.)
There is another, and more profound, sign of shaky
academic standards in the petition. That is, the refer
ence to the University (apart from the Hoover) as
"value-neutral." For what is this but to say that one set of
values is so correct as to be the norm, and others aber

rant and intolerable? But the duty of an academic is
surely, above all, to listen to arguments and standpoints
with which he disagrees.
All institutions concerned with scholarship must en
sure that the search for truth is not hampered by regula
tory dogma, or narrowed by (for example) consid
erations of sex or race. But within these general proposi
tions lies a wide range of legitimate diversity, to limit
which would itself be an unwarranted intrusion on
academic liberty.
Nor is it true that, within those limits, the University is
"value-neutral." Thirty years ago the prevailing atmos
phere at Stanford might have been called "conserva
tive"; today it might be called "liberal." Neither fashion
has any eternal validity: the LSE itself later went through
a conservative phase and is now more or less middle-of
the-road.
To take a specific case: as has been pointed out, the
University has a "Feminist Studies Program" which, by
its very title is committed to a certain view of its subject.
If liberals are able to get the University to approve such
an institution, well and good. But they cannot simulta
neously mount a "value-neutral" assault on a far less
committed Hoover.

When it comes down to it, what the petitioners would
have us believe is that men and minds as fine as Sidney
Hook and Admiral Stockdale, Philip Habib and Seymour
Martin Lipset, have been bribed or duped into accepting
a false view of the Hoover; and that the truth is to be
found in a document as inaccurate as to fact as it is
defective as to argument.
There is no basis for any "inquiry" into the Hoover;
and when it comes to the suggestion that if all is well an
inquiry could do no harm, perhaps the principle might
be applied to the petitioners' own claims that they are
not politically motivated. Maybe a polygraph test would
not be decisive; but it might be interesting to watch one
or two of them.
May I add that, (as suggested in Professor Hook's
experience), in addressing student groups here, even
ones in principle disagreeing with me, I have always
found that discussions proceed with every sign of both
interest and amenity — qualities so necessary in the
pursuit of knowledge, and ones which one would have
hoped to find as universal among their elders.

May I add that, (as suggested in Professor Hook's
experience), in addressing student groups here, even
ones in principle disagreeing with me, I have always
found that discussions proceed with every sign of both
interest and amenity — qualities so necessary in the
pursuit of knowledge, and ones which one would have
hoped to find as universal among their elders.

As a foreign citizen at the Hoover, I am neither a
Democrat nor a Republican (when I first became a Fel
low here I had always voted Labour at home, though I
was never asked about this or about any other political
matter . . . ).
However, if I may contribute something from British
experience to the debate, my first academic post was the
the LSE — the London School of Economics and Political
Science. A part, though a largely autonomous part, of
London University, its Founding Father was the socialist
theoretician and politician Sidney Webb, and the head
of its Political Science Department was chairman of the
Labour Party; it boasted of its role not merely among the
leading cadres of the Labour Party, but also in left-wing
parties and governments throughout the Common
wealth.
It came in for a good deal of attack and criticism, but as
tar as I know it was never suggested that there was
anything academically wrong about the situation,
perhaps because everyone remembered that a certain
concentration of the like-minded has often proved
academically fruitful — as with the "Cambridge school"
of philosophy, the "Chicago school" of economics, the
"Vienna school," the "Frankfurt school." The most I
ever heard as a complaint in the academic context was

that the position was "anomalous," to which the reply of
a socialist colleague was that the opposite of anomaly is
entropy . . .
I do think that one academic issue arises in the present
controversy. The original anti-Hoover petition contains,
quite apart from dubious argument, simple errors of fact
— that the Hoover has made an "almost total" shift to
domestic studies; that it is not bound by the academic
prohibition of political discrimination in hiring; that its
share of University funds is $4 million; that its research
fellows are not subject to University approval.
The true facts are easily available. Those who drafted
the petition have therefore shown themselves either
incapable of, or unwilling to undertake, research even
of this very simple nature — an academic disqualifica
tion, surely. (And I may add that since those who signed
the petition were induced to do so by untrue assump
tions, their signatures must, by all reasonable standards,
be deemed invalid.)
There is another, and more profound, sign of shaky
academic standards in the petition. That is, the refer
ence to the University (apart from the Hoover) as
"value-neutral." For what is this but to say that one set of
values is so correct as to be the norm, and others aber

rant and intolerable? But the duty of an academic is
surely, above all, to listen to arguments and standpoints
with which he disagrees.
All institutions concerned with scholarship must en
sure that the search for truth is not hampered by regula
tory dogma, or narrowed by (for example) consid
erations of sex or race. But within these general proposi
tions lies a wide range of legitimate diversity, to limit
which would itself be an unwarranted intrusion on
academic liberty.
Nor is it true that, within those limits, the University is
"value-neutral." Thirty years ago the prevailing atmos
phere at Stanford might have been called "conserva
tive"; today it might be called "liberal." Neither fashion
has any eternal validity: the LSE itself later went through
a conservative phase and is now more or less middle-of
the-road.
To take a specific case: as has been pointed out, the
University has a "Feminist Studies Program" which, by
its very title is committed to a certain view of its subject.
If liberals are able to get the University to approve such
an institution, well and good. But they cannot simulta
neously mount a "value-neutral" assault on a far less
committed Hoover.

When it comes down to it, what the petitioners would
have us believe is that men and minds as fine as Sidney
Hook and Admiral Stockdale, Philip Habib and Seymour
Martin Lipset, have been bribed or duped into accepting
a false view of the Hoover; and that the truth is to be
found in a document as inaccurate as to fact as it is
defective as to argument.
There is no basis for any "inquiry" into the Hoover;
and when it comes to the suggestion that if all is well an
inquiry could do no harm, perhaps the principle might
be applied to the petitioners' own claims that they are
not politically motivated. Maybe a polygraph test would
not be decisive; but it might be interesting to watch one
or two of them.
