## Don't count out the 'old' professors yet 
### 
I was distressed when on Friday
the 13th the Daily featured on its
front page a picture of Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Norman
Wessells, looking harassed and pre
maturely aging, the victim of the
burden of his office. The accompany
ing report on the faculty senate meet
ing said he had been accused of
ageism, like racism or sexism. I was
even more distressed to read that he
that the likes of Sidney Hook and
me had been losing our marbles
since about age 20. When the
humanities faculty received personal
< omputers, my urgent request was
turned down on the grounds that I
was not an active faculty member.
This seemed to me to indicate that
there was something wrong with sci
entific observation or with the En
glish Now to be told that I
was steadily losing my marbles was
adding insult to injury.
As always, my reaction was mild
and reasonable. Not so that of some
of my colleagues. A born-again
( hristian said "Do you remember
what he said about us? He knew we
would turn the other cheek. Scienti
fically the Old Testament is non
sense, but a hint of criticism of the
lews would trigger the McCloskey
treatment." "Yes," commented
another, "all groups which threaten
violence are treated with deference.
The people who were most vigorous
in opposing the U.S. involvement in
Vietnam or now in Central America
have pushed policies which may lead
lo a nuclear war in the Middle East,
and no one dares discuss it. Let's
march on the Administration build
ing."

I calmed him down and said we
should leave such behavior to the ac
tive faculty.
A European colleague, an expert
fencer, wanted to challenge the
Dean to a duel. I calmed him down,
too, sayingthatthe Dean wasa highly
esteemed administrator whom the
University could not afford to lose.
Finally all agreed that the only
civilized course was for me to write
to the Daily. I will therefore present a
few facts.
As a humanist, let me begin with
the arts. Michelangelo was nearly 80
when he designed the dome of Saint
Peter's. Renoir and Goya painted
masterpieces until they were at the
end of their 70s, Matisse went on
until his 80s and Titian until his 90s.
Verdi completed his opera Falstaff
when he was 79, and Arthur Rubens
tein still gives brilliant concerts in his
90s. Stradivarius, who died at 97,
produced most of his 1116 violins
after he was 60.1 could go on and on.
It is true that scientists tend to go
to seed earlier than humanists, but
there are exceptions, many of them.
Benjamin Franklin invented bifocal
glasses when he was 78; he helped
frame the Constitution when he was
80. One of the great biologists of all
times, the Spanish Nobel Prize win
ner Ramon y Cajal, was active as a
scientist and an administrator until
his death at 83. If he has not done so,
I would suggest that the Dean read
his book The World Seen at Age 80.
He would enjoy it, since Ramon y
Cajal was an extraordinary indi
vidual, comparable in his breadth of
interests with Leonardo da Vinci.
Is it a coincidence that both the

Soviet Union and the United States
are run by individuals who biologi
cally are over the hill? Gladstone be
came prime minister of England for
the fourth time at 83. Somehow,
whether we like it or not, people
trust older political leaders. Hopes
that younger leaders would sweep
away ancient corruption have been
cheated in countries like Cuba,
Kampuchea, and Nicaragua, where
what appeared to be glorious revolu
tions have turned out to be ruthless
grabs for power.
On the Stanford scene, during my
many decades here, I have often wit
nessed the appointment of young
heads of department who ruthlessly
sweep aside the work of senior col
leagues, surround themselves with
younger people who are no threat to
them, and introduce programs
which don't work, as the older col
leagues warned.
This is not an argument for a
gerontocracy, heaven forbid! The
old must not stand in the way of the
young. They should indeed give
them every encouragement and turn
over administration to them. It is,
however, distressing to note that
students in some departments know
nothing of distinguished faculty
members in their field who happen
to be emeriti. There must be a happy
medium, but the solution will not be
easy to find.
The Dean may be right in general
biological terms, but there are
enough exceptions to make a policy
based on biology as risky as one
based on sex or race.

Semite defined
A recent letter to the Daily ("Anti-
Semitism," May 17) repeated a com
mon misunderstanding of the term
"anti-Semitism"; the writer pro
posed that, because Arabs are Se
mites, any anti-Semitic remark
applies to Arabs as well as to lews.
This is too literal an approach to
the term. The expression "anti-
Semitism" was introduced in the late
18th century as a euphemism for
"Jew-hatred." At that time there was
an attempt to use pseudo-scientific
racial theories to justify prejudice
against lews; the term reflects this
racial approach. In fact, the Jews are
not a race (despite Hitler's opinions
on the matter), and racial arguments
were only an excuse to justify hatreds
that had existed for centuries.
Nevertheless, the euphemism
"anti-Semite" caught on; perhaps it
is considered a more cultured alter
native to "Jew-hater."
Historically the term has never
been used to denote hatred of Se
mites in general, but rather hatred of
just Jews. Adolph Hitler, an extreme
example of an anti-Semite, openly
collaborated with Arabs during
World War II and hosted the Grand
Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin el Hus
seini, in Berlin for most of the war.
Anti-Semitism has, therefore,
nothing to do with "Semites," but is,
as Webster's defines it, "having or
showing prejudice against Jews," or
"discriminating against or persecut
ing Jews."

me had been losing our marbles
since about age 20. When the
humanities faculty received personal
< omputers, my urgent request was
turned down on the grounds that I
was not an active faculty member.
This seemed to me to indicate that
there was something wrong with sci
entific observation or with the En
glish Now to be told that I
was steadily losing my marbles was
adding insult to injury.
As always, my reaction was mild
and reasonable. Not so that of some
of my colleagues. A born-again
( hristian said "Do you remember
what he said about us? He knew we
would turn the other cheek. Scienti
fically the Old Testament is non
sense, but a hint of criticism of the
lews would trigger the McCloskey
treatment." "Yes," commented
another, "all groups which threaten
violence are treated with deference.
The people who were most vigorous
in opposing the U.S. involvement in
Vietnam or now in Central America
have pushed policies which may lead
lo a nuclear war in the Middle East,
and no one dares discuss it. Let's
march on the Administration build
ing."

I calmed him down and said we
should leave such behavior to the ac
tive faculty.
A European colleague, an expert
fencer, wanted to challenge the
Dean to a duel. I calmed him down,
too, sayingthatthe Dean wasa highly
esteemed administrator whom the
University could not afford to lose.
Finally all agreed that the only
civilized course was for me to write
to the Daily. I will therefore present a
few facts.
As a humanist, let me begin with
the arts. Michelangelo was nearly 80
when he designed the dome of Saint
Peter's. Renoir and Goya painted
masterpieces until they were at the
end of their 70s, Matisse went on
until his 80s and Titian until his 90s.
Verdi completed his opera Falstaff
when he was 79, and Arthur Rubens
tein still gives brilliant concerts in his
90s. Stradivarius, who died at 97,
produced most of his 1116 violins
after he was 60.1 could go on and on.
It is true that scientists tend to go
to seed earlier than humanists, but
there are exceptions, many of them.
Benjamin Franklin invented bifocal
glasses when he was 78; he helped
frame the Constitution when he was
80. One of the great biologists of all
times, the Spanish Nobel Prize win
ner Ramon y Cajal, was active as a
scientist and an administrator until
his death at 83. If he has not done so,
I would suggest that the Dean read
his book The World Seen at Age 80.
He would enjoy it, since Ramon y
Cajal was an extraordinary indi
vidual, comparable in his breadth of
interests with Leonardo da Vinci.
Is it a coincidence that both the

Soviet Union and the United States
are run by individuals who biologi
cally are over the hill? Gladstone be
came prime minister of England for
the fourth time at 83. Somehow,
whether we like it or not, people
trust older political leaders. Hopes
that younger leaders would sweep
away ancient corruption have been
cheated in countries like Cuba,
Kampuchea, and Nicaragua, where
what appeared to be glorious revolu
tions have turned out to be ruthless
grabs for power.
On the Stanford scene, during my
many decades here, I have often wit
nessed the appointment of young
heads of department who ruthlessly
sweep aside the work of senior col
leagues, surround themselves with
younger people who are no threat to
them, and introduce programs
which don't work, as the older col
leagues warned.
This is not an argument for a
gerontocracy, heaven forbid! The
old must not stand in the way of the
young. They should indeed give
them every encouragement and turn
over administration to them. It is,
however, distressing to note that
students in some departments know
nothing of distinguished faculty
members in their field who happen
to be emeriti. There must be a happy
medium, but the solution will not be
easy to find.
The Dean may be right in general
biological terms, but there are
enough exceptions to make a policy
based on biology as risky as one
based on sex or race.

Semite defined
A recent letter to the Daily ("Anti-
Semitism," May 17) repeated a com
mon misunderstanding of the term
"anti-Semitism"; the writer pro
posed that, because Arabs are Se
mites, any anti-Semitic remark
applies to Arabs as well as to lews.
This is too literal an approach to
the term. The expression "anti-
Semitism" was introduced in the late
18th century as a euphemism for
"Jew-hatred." At that time there was
an attempt to use pseudo-scientific
racial theories to justify prejudice
against lews; the term reflects this
racial approach. In fact, the Jews are
not a race (despite Hitler's opinions
on the matter), and racial arguments
were only an excuse to justify hatreds
that had existed for centuries.
Nevertheless, the euphemism
"anti-Semite" caught on; perhaps it
is considered a more cultured alter
native to "Jew-hater."
Historically the term has never
been used to denote hatred of Se
mites in general, but rather hatred of
just Jews. Adolph Hitler, an extreme
example of an anti-Semite, openly
collaborated with Arabs during
World War II and hosted the Grand
Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin el Hus
seini, in Berlin for most of the war.
Anti-Semitism has, therefore,
nothing to do with "Semites," but is,
as Webster's defines it, "having or
showing prejudice against Jews," or
"discriminating against or persecut
ing Jews."
