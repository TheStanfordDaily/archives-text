# Campus squirrel may claim Chinese ancestry

### KEILA DIEHL 
"To the garden came two
new tenants less exotic than th
monkey and the parrot, but by
no means indigenous to
California."
Thus the arrival of the
"black" squirrels to the Stan
ford campus was recorded in
1893 by David Starr Jordan, the
first University president, in his
biography, Days of Man.
"Certain individuals are
melanistic glossy black
throughout and exceedingly
handsome," he wrote.
However, a popular theory
around campus states that
black squirrels were first
brought here from China in the
1950s for an experiment from
which they managed to es
cape.
Advocates of this theory
maintain that these six squir
rels were the ancestors of the
many furry black rodents who
now run rampant around cam
pus.
It is true that black tree squir
rels exist in China, where they
are considered good luck
charms and are kept in large
numbers as pets.
But the Chinese squirrels are
much smaller than the sturdy
species found here, according
to Biology Prof. David Regnery.
Regnery is not an advocate of
the "escaping Chinese squirrel
theory."
"It is doubtful that the
Chinese squirrels could have
interbred with the native squir
rels," said Regnery. "The black
squirrels I have noticed here
are simply melanistic eastern
gray squirrels or Sciurus
carolinensis."
Information provided by
David Starr Jordan in 1893 indi
cates that the black squirrels
were here long before the
19505.
The eastern gray squirrels
are thought to have been the
first introduced to western
America in the late 19th cen
tury by easterners who missed
the little rodents after moving
west.
The distribution of the squir
rels increased with the growth
of oak and pine woods. Even
tually, the species was accli

mated in Golden Gate Park in
San Francisco, causing the
overflow to make its way down
the Peninsula toward Stanford.
The different coloring of the
"black" gray squirrels is due to
a genetic mutation.
"The melanistic squirrels
freely breed with the other
eastern gray squirrels," Re
gnery said. "In fact, both col
ors may often be found in the
same brood."
The eastern gray squirrel is
characterized by a relatively
short, bushy tail. The species
has no special winter coat or
ear plumes. The gray squirrels
compete with the woodpec
kers, as both live and store
their food in oak trees.
"The woodpeckers. . . on
their intermittent returns feel
outrage by raids upon their
storehouse in the big oak and
scold vociferously over the in

trusion," wrote Jorden of the
gray squirrel.
Sciurus carolensis is a soci
able rodent who is often found
in populated areas, especially
in farmers' fruit gardens.
Many students can testify as
to the socially agressive nature
of the squirrels. They are often
found rummaging around
dorm rooms in search of food
or a little attention. But the
squirrels are rarely caught,
since they can reach ground
speeds of up to 12 miles per
hour.
Apparently 90 years has not
affected the behavior of Stan
ford's squirrels.
Jordan wrote that the squir
rel in his garden "seems like all
his brethen to need an audi
ence and watches the spec
tator as though craving admira
tion."
