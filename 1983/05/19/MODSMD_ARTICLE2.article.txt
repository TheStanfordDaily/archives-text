In preparation for commencement exercises next month, a work
crew trims ivy in the Quad. The University's maintenance budget
increases by about $30,000 each May to prune bushes, pull weeds,
plant flowers and repaint traffic lanes to spruce up the Farm for
graduation, scheduled this year for June 12.
