## 'Hunger' leaves audiences wanting 
### RICHARD KYLBERG 
Everything about MGM's latest re
lease, The Hunger, is absurd, but the
film is presented as if it were an impor
tant philosophical treatise. On the
other hand, perhaps this is the major
contribution to Western culture that
immortal bisexual cannibals have been
waiting for.
Catherine Deneuve plays Miriam, a
part human, part alien creature who
know the secrets of eternal life, but
must eat people to sustain it. She
slashes hervictims with a penknife hid
den in her ankh necklace, and then eats
them with no table manners at all, spil
ling blood all over her fabulous cos

tumes. Deneuve is disappointing in this
film, uncertain whether she is fright
ened or frightening, and sexually AC or
DC.
David Bowie is no stranger to strange
roles—The Man Who Fell To Earth—and
in The Hunger he plays Miriam's
sidekick from the 19th century, John
Blaylock. Bowie is honestly very good
in this film, turning into a convincing
150-year-old man so early in the movie
that we never get a chance to decide
whether or not he is taking it as seri
ously as everyone else is.
Susan Sarandon has had similar ex
perience in strange movies, Janet in

The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and
here she plays the third fruit in the
cake, a doctor researching the aging
process who meets Blaylock when he
realizes he is aging and needs help. She
then, for reasons unknown, becomes
telepathically involved with Miriam and
the two have a fling which Hustler read
ers might term erotic, but which others
will most likely find offensive when the
two bite each other and begin bleed
ing.
The film opens like a poor segment of
"M TV": a pointless rock video set to
unbearable music. One really has to
hear this opening number before ap
preciating the silence in Green Library.

This cacophony is set to an equally
upsetting group of images. In these
opening moments, the shots are struc
tured to reveal some relationship be
tween Miriam and Blaylock and a pair of
baboons. While the music crashes on,
Miriam and Blaylock murder their
"pick-ups" from a punk bar and one of
the baboons kills and eats part of
another. It is not a very interesting cor
relation, but a correlation just the
same. After this opening relationship is
dropped, and we never understand
why the baboon ate his friend, or why
the filmmakers subjected us to it. The
film is full of inexplicable tangents like
this, and they rapidly become annoy
ing.
The film purports to be frightening,
but the only fear that the viewer teels in
The Hunger is that it will continue as it
begins. The film is predictable, the
fears warranted, and the film goes on,
getting only slightly better because we
don't have to hear that music again. The
extreme close-ups of throats being slit
by Blaylock do not frighten, but irk, the
viewer. When Miriam put the 150-
year-old Blaylock into an attic retire
ment community with her past lovers
who likewise grew old but could not
die, we are supposed to be frightened,
but instead we laugh. Indeed, the only
time we laugh harder is when the film
tries to become more frightening, like
when these petrified people seek re
venge.
Despite such absurdity, director
Tony Scott shows promise in this film.
His previous work has been documen
tary, and we recognize a documentary
sense in The Hunger which would work
very well on a different script. Making a
film about bisexual bloodsuckers with a
documentary conscience doesn't work
in The Hunger. Scott tries valiantly to
offer sense to life and death, but he
does so in a senseless script, and it ends
up looking a bit silly.
Some of the cinematography is very
nice, suggestive of recent innovative
rock videos, and Scott reveals a full pa
late of cinematic effects. The film is full
of slanted shots, obscured frames, ex
tremes of high-key and low-key light
ing, and so on throughout the
textbook. Scott's five-year study of
painting is reflected in the sensitivity of
his shot selection.
There is a problem, however, with
the way in which Scott chooses to ulti
mately piece these shots together.
Some pass by so quickly that we can't
tell what they are pictures of, while
others create small jump cuts which
don't follow well. For example, a series
of shots shift from a barn to a bedroom
to the barn and then back to the bed
room again in straight cuts that wake no
sense. In another scene, the sound
track continues over two shots of
Miriam and Doctor Roberts which
makes them appear to be speaking
without opening their mouths. At first,
we feel that the voices we hear are tele
pathic, but then there is a sudden dis
solve to a scene in which they finish the
conversation. One leaves the theater
wondering whether it was actually a
final cut or not.
In short, there are very few reasons to
see The Hunger, except perhaps for a
sick giggle. The film is laughable in its
absurdity, but also somewhat sad in
that its creators take it so seriously.
Alferd Packard might enjoy The
Hunger, but no one else will.

know the secrets of eternal life, but
must eat people to sustain it. She
slashes hervictims with a penknife hid
den in her ankh necklace, and then eats
them with no table manners at all, spil
ling blood all over her fabulous cos

tumes. Deneuve is disappointing in this
film, uncertain whether she is fright
ened or frightening, and sexually AC or
DC.
David Bowie is no stranger to strange
roles—The Man Who Fell To Earth—and
in The Hunger he plays Miriam's
sidekick from the 19th century, John
Blaylock. Bowie is honestly very good
in this film, turning into a convincing
150-year-old man so early in the movie
that we never get a chance to decide
whether or not he is taking it as seri
ously as everyone else is.
Susan Sarandon has had similar ex
perience in strange movies, Janet in

The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and
here she plays the third fruit in the
cake, a doctor researching the aging
process who meets Blaylock when he
realizes he is aging and needs help. She
then, for reasons unknown, becomes
telepathically involved with Miriam and
the two have a fling which Hustler read
ers might term erotic, but which others
will most likely find offensive when the
two bite each other and begin bleed
ing.
The film opens like a poor segment of
"M TV": a pointless rock video set to
unbearable music. One really has to
hear this opening number before ap
preciating the silence in Green Library.

This cacophony is set to an equally
upsetting group of images. In these
opening moments, the shots are struc
tured to reveal some relationship be
tween Miriam and Blaylock and a pair of
baboons. While the music crashes on,
Miriam and Blaylock murder their
"pick-ups" from a punk bar and one of
the baboons kills and eats part of
another. It is not a very interesting cor
relation, but a correlation just the
same. After this opening relationship is
dropped, and we never understand
why the baboon ate his friend, or why
the filmmakers subjected us to it. The
film is full of inexplicable tangents like
this, and they rapidly become annoy
ing.
The film purports to be frightening,
but the only fear that the viewer teels in
The Hunger is that it will continue as it
begins. The film is predictable, the
fears warranted, and the film goes on,
getting only slightly better because we
don't have to hear that music again. The
extreme close-ups of throats being slit
by Blaylock do not frighten, but irk, the
viewer. When Miriam put the 150-
year-old Blaylock into an attic retire
ment community with her past lovers
who likewise grew old but could not
die, we are supposed to be frightened,
but instead we laugh. Indeed, the only
time we laugh harder is when the film
tries to become more frightening, like
when these petrified people seek re
venge.
Despite such absurdity, director
Tony Scott shows promise in this film.
His previous work has been documen
tary, and we recognize a documentary
sense in The Hunger which would work
very well on a different script. Making a
film about bisexual bloodsuckers with a
documentary conscience doesn't work
in The Hunger. Scott tries valiantly to
offer sense to life and death, but he
does so in a senseless script, and it ends
up looking a bit silly.
Some of the cinematography is very
nice, suggestive of recent innovative
rock videos, and Scott reveals a full pa
late of cinematic effects. The film is full
of slanted shots, obscured frames, ex
tremes of high-key and low-key light
ing, and so on throughout the
textbook. Scott's five-year study of
painting is reflected in the sensitivity of
his shot selection.
There is a problem, however, with
the way in which Scott chooses to ulti
mately piece these shots together.
Some pass by so quickly that we can't
tell what they are pictures of, while
others create small jump cuts which
don't follow well. For example, a series
of shots shift from a barn to a bedroom
to the barn and then back to the bed
room again in straight cuts that wake no
sense. In another scene, the sound
track continues over two shots of
Miriam and Doctor Roberts which
makes them appear to be speaking
without opening their mouths. At first,
we feel that the voices we hear are tele
pathic, but then there is a sudden dis
solve to a scene in which they finish the
conversation. One leaves the theater
wondering whether it was actually a
final cut or not.
In short, there are very few reasons to
see The Hunger, except perhaps for a
sick giggle. The film is laughable in its
absurdity, but also somewhat sad in
that its creators take it so seriously.
Alferd Packard might enjoy The
Hunger, but no one else will.


Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie in '77ie Hunger'
Everything about MGM's latest re
lease, The Hunger, is absurd, but the
film is presented as if it were an impor
tant philosophical treatise. On the
other hand, perhaps this is the major
contribution to Western culture that
immortal bisexual cannibals have been
waiting for.
