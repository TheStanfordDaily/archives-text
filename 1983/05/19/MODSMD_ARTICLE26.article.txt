# What will your mother think?

We mean, you haven't done anything. She had such great
plans for you, too. "My child is going to be a big success at
college," she told all her friends. When you got in at Stanford
she was so proud. She was sure you'd do great things, like
head the ASSU, or work on the research team that finally cured
cancer. But what do you do? You spend all of your time bribing
21-year-olds to go to the liquor store and buy you beer.
That's terrible. The worst thing is that you think she'll never
find out. Well, you're wrong.
We're a newspaper. We do investigative reporting. We have
a score or so of photographers adept at taking candid photo
graphs. (A candid photograph is one where the subject
doesn't knowtheir picture is being taken, understand?) Plus,
we have a WATS line. We can call anywhere in the country, and
it hardly costs us anything. We have a mailing permit, so we
can send stuff anywhere, free.
We hope you get the picture. Mom doesn't have to find out.
Maybe if you come in and pick up a story we'll let sleeping
dogs lie. After all, the shock would probably kill her.
And that wouldn't be a pretty picture, now would it?
