# 'Blue Thunder' a dull rumble, 'Max Dugan' retreads
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
So far this has been a painfully
slow year for American movies.
In the midst of estimable con
tributions from Australian, Ita
lian, Scottish and Swedish
filmmakers, the only American
film I've been able to recom
mend unreservedly since
Christmas is George Nieren-

berg's documentary Say Amen,
Somebody. The few releases
by notable directors (The King
of Comedy, The Outsiders)
have been major disappoint
ments, and most of the rest
seems to be filler — as if Hol
lywood were marking time be
fore what it hopes will be an
enormous box office summer.

{The Return of the ledi, Super
man 111, The 71vilight Zone,
Staying Alive — the sequel to
Saturday Might Fever — and a
lames Bond picture or two are
promised, as well as a sci-fi tan
tasy from Peter Yates, Krull,
and |ohn Badham's thriller,
War Games.) But it's difficult to
get revved up over the pros
pect of pleasurable summer
evenings at the movies — some
of these films may actually be
good — when you're stuck at
Blue Thunder or Beathless or
Max Dugan Returns.
Blue Thunder stars four tal
ented actors — Roy Scheider,
Malcolm McDowell, Daniel
Stern and the late Warren
Oates — but the title refers to a
super-equipped helicopter
being tested by LAPD aerial
cops Murphy (Scheider) and
Lymangood (Stern), and from
the moment it is introduced
against a red sun, like a huge,
other-worldly, metallic taran
tula, and the music soars, we
understand where the emo
tional focus of the movie is.
That helicopter upstages all of
the actors except Oates, who
plays Murphy and Lyman
good's chief as the closest
human equivalent to a bulldog.
Scheider gives a non
performance in a role — the
Vietnam vet who relives the
war in nightmares — that has
been a cliche almost since the
war ended, and Stern stays
fresh-faced and sincere (he's
playing a rookie) until his early,
predictable demise. (Like the
WWII dramas of the '40s, Blue

Thunder sets up its youthful
victim from the first.)
McDowell is the only one
who actually gives a certified
bad performance, as a huffy
British villain who somehow
fought for the Americans in
Vietnam and is now associated
with a fascist organization
working through the LAPD; his
permanent expression in this
film — eyes wide, lips pressed
together in a scowl, nostrils
flaring — suggests that if the
camera fixed on him for
longer, we might see smoke is
suing from his nose.
This isn't a terrible movie,
but it's terribly mediocre. The
director, John Badham (who is
certainly flooding the market
this summer), and the editors,
Frank Morriss and Edward Ab
roms, assemble the action se
quences in an efficient, work
manlike manner, like visual in
struction manuals, and the
early ones receive a lift from
)ohn Alonzo's dreamy, under
water, pastel-concentrated
photography. But the plotting
(Dan O'Bannon and Don
jakoby wrote the script) is
crimped and confusing —
we're never quite sure what
Murphy's evil adversaries are
trying to prove, or why he
should have such easy access
to their plans.
The film is designed as a
crowd pleaser, with lots of ac
tion and a genial disregard of
dramatic and thematic incon
sistencies in order to provide
maximum excitement. (One
instance: the bad guys are es

tablished immediately by their
lack of concern over the lives
of innocent bystanders, but
when Murphy maneuvers his
'copter to evade a missile, a
skyscraper is hit instead, and
not a moment wasted regret
ting— or even inquiring into —
the possible resultant injuries.)
The audience I saw Blue 1 blun
der with enjoyed themselves
immensely; it was primarily a
male group, and they laughed
heartily over the sophomoric
masculine gags, like Murphy's
and Lymangood's delight in
playing peeping Tom outside
the window of a nude woman
and above a drive-in restaurant
where the waitresses wear
low-cut uniforms. Women may
react differently. I guess it
doesn't do to be too sensitive
at a movie in which such
sophisticated, high-flying air
craft aim so low.
Can anyone think of an ur
gent reason to remake Breath
less? lean-Luc Godard's 1960
film, one of the first master
pieces of the French New
Wave, was innovative both in
technique and in its perception
of the generation of European
moviegoers who had grown up
on American gangster melod
ramas and had adopted the
style of the heroes of the
genre, modified with a casual,
amoral cool. Patricia (Jean
Seberg) was the first Godard
heroine: stunning and morally
vacuous. And Michel (Jean-
Paul Belmondo) devoted him
self — even sacrificed his life —
to a stylistic ideal rather than a

principle.
In |im Mcßride's new version
of Breathless, Michel lias be
come an impeccably dressed
transient named lesse (Richard
Cere) who steals a car, shoots a
cop and resurfaces to make
love to a French beauty named
Monica (Valerie Kaprisky).
M c B r i d e a n d hi s c o -
screenwriter, L.M. Kit Carson,
have retained the international
romance (simply reversing the
origins of the two leading
characters), the quote from
Faulkner's The Wild Palms
("Between grief and nothing, I
will take grief") and the pop
cultural fixation of the hero.
But whereas. Michel idolized
Bogart, Jesse's obsession is a
comic book figure called the
Silver Surfer. And in case we
don't understand what the
filmmakers are doing with this
sci-fi superman, they include
an argument between lesse
and a sneering adolescent on a
skateboard that underlines the
symbolism in red. Richard
Mine comes across with some
chic photography, but the
movie is a pointless, embarras
sing bomb, and it's directed —
by a man known for his ex
perimental films — like a per
fume commercial. I crept out
after the interminable first
hour.
On the other hand, I sat
through all of the latest Neil
Simon-Herbert Ross collabora
tor Max Dugan Returns, pos
sibly as penance for skipping
the last two Simons, Only
When I Laugh and I Ought to

Be in Pictures. (They sounded
like exactly the same movie.)
Max Dugan Returns isn't tor
ture, really, but you feel after
wards as it you'd killed a
couple of brain cells, lason
Robards lends his welcome
presence to the role of a dying
renegade who forces his es
tranged daughter (Marsha Ma
son), a widow schoolteacher,
and her teenage son (Matthew
Broderick), to adopt him and
then wins their hearts. Mason
is worse than usual (and she's
usually pretty uninspired), in
clothes and a hairdo that make
her look like Sandy Dennis in
Come Back to the > & Dime,
limmy Dean, limmy Dean, and
Donald Sutherland, miscast as
an L.A. cop, looks like he can't
figure out why Ross cast them
opposite each other. (He's not
alone.) I used to resent Neil
Simon's skill at getting off one
liners because they blinded
audiences to the queasy
making amalgam of mean
spiritedness and sentimental
ity underneath, but in the past
few years his jokes have be
come so worn that there's no
longer any reason to get upset.
In the most miscalculated
scene in Max Dugan Returns,
Mason and Sutherland — an
English major before entering
police academy — exchange
favorite authors. Mason says
she prefers Austen because
you can depend on her, and
Sutherland says he likes Thac
keray because he makes you
work. This isn't a movie for
people who read.

Roy Scheider in Blue Thunder'
So far this has been a painfully
slow year for American movies.
In the midst of estimable con
tributions from Australian, Ita
lian, Scottish and Swedish
filmmakers, the only American
film I've been able to recom
mend unreservedly since
Christmas is George Nieren-

berg's documentary Say Amen,
Somebody. The few releases
by notable directors (The King
of Comedy, The Outsiders)
have been major disappoint
ments, and most of the rest
seems to be filler — as if Hol
lywood were marking time be
fore what it hopes will be an
enormous box office summer.

{The Return of the ledi, Super
man 111, The 71vilight Zone,
Staying Alive — the sequel to
Saturday Might Fever — and a
lames Bond picture or two are
promised, as well as a sci-fi tan
tasy from Peter Yates, Krull,
and |ohn Badham's thriller,
War Games.) But it's difficult to
get revved up over the pros
pect of pleasurable summer
evenings at the movies — some
of these films may actually be
good — when you're stuck at
Blue Thunder or Beathless or
Max Dugan Returns.
Blue Thunder stars four tal
ented actors — Roy Scheider,
Malcolm McDowell, Daniel
Stern and the late Warren
Oates — but the title refers to a
super-equipped helicopter
being tested by LAPD aerial
cops Murphy (Scheider) and
Lymangood (Stern), and from
the moment it is introduced
against a red sun, like a huge,
other-worldly, metallic taran
tula, and the music soars, we
understand where the emo
tional focus of the movie is.
That helicopter upstages all of
the actors except Oates, who
plays Murphy and Lyman
good's chief as the closest
human equivalent to a bulldog.
Scheider gives a non
performance in a role — the
Vietnam vet who relives the
war in nightmares — that has
been a cliche almost since the
war ended, and Stern stays
fresh-faced and sincere (he's
playing a rookie) until his early,
predictable demise. (Like the
WWII dramas of the '40s, Blue

Thunder sets up its youthful
victim from the first.)
McDowell is the only one
who actually gives a certified
bad performance, as a huffy
British villain who somehow
fought for the Americans in
Vietnam and is now associated
with a fascist organization
working through the LAPD; his
permanent expression in this
film — eyes wide, lips pressed
together in a scowl, nostrils
flaring — suggests that if the
camera fixed on him for
longer, we might see smoke is
suing from his nose.
This isn't a terrible movie,
but it's terribly mediocre. The
director, John Badham (who is
certainly flooding the market
this summer), and the editors,
Frank Morriss and Edward Ab
roms, assemble the action se
quences in an efficient, work
manlike manner, like visual in
struction manuals, and the
early ones receive a lift from
)ohn Alonzo's dreamy, under
water, pastel-concentrated
photography. But the plotting
(Dan O'Bannon and Don
jakoby wrote the script) is
crimped and confusing —
we're never quite sure what
Murphy's evil adversaries are
trying to prove, or why he
should have such easy access
to their plans.
The film is designed as a
crowd pleaser, with lots of ac
tion and a genial disregard of
dramatic and thematic incon
sistencies in order to provide
maximum excitement. (One
instance: the bad guys are es

tablished immediately by their
lack of concern over the lives
of innocent bystanders, but
when Murphy maneuvers his
'copter to evade a missile, a
skyscraper is hit instead, and
not a moment wasted regret
ting— or even inquiring into —
the possible resultant injuries.)
The audience I saw Blue 1 blun
der with enjoyed themselves
immensely; it was primarily a
male group, and they laughed
heartily over the sophomoric
masculine gags, like Murphy's
and Lymangood's delight in
playing peeping Tom outside
the window of a nude woman
and above a drive-in restaurant
where the waitresses wear
low-cut uniforms. Women may
react differently. I guess it
doesn't do to be too sensitive
at a movie in which such
sophisticated, high-flying air
craft aim so low.
Can anyone think of an ur
gent reason to remake Breath
less? lean-Luc Godard's 1960
film, one of the first master
pieces of the French New
Wave, was innovative both in
technique and in its perception
of the generation of European
moviegoers who had grown up
on American gangster melod
ramas and had adopted the
style of the heroes of the
genre, modified with a casual,
amoral cool. Patricia (Jean
Seberg) was the first Godard
heroine: stunning and morally
vacuous. And Michel (Jean-
Paul Belmondo) devoted him
self — even sacrificed his life —
to a stylistic ideal rather than a

principle.
In |im Mcßride's new version
of Breathless, Michel lias be
come an impeccably dressed
transient named lesse (Richard
Cere) who steals a car, shoots a
cop and resurfaces to make
love to a French beauty named
Monica (Valerie Kaprisky).
M c B r i d e a n d hi s c o -

have retained the international
romance (simply reversing the
origins of the two leading
characters), the quote from
Faulkner's The Wild Palms
("Between grief and nothing, I
will take grief") and the pop
cultural fixation of the hero.
But whereas. Michel idolized
Bogart, Jesse's obsession is a
comic book figure called the
Silver Surfer. And in case we
don't understand what the
filmmakers are doing with this
sci-fi superman, they include
an argument between lesse
and a sneering adolescent on a
skateboard that underlines the
symbolism in red. Richard
Mine comes across with some
chic photography, but the
movie is a pointless, embarras
sing bomb, and it's directed —
by a man known for his ex
perimental films — like a per
fume commercial. I crept out
after the interminable first
hour.
On the other hand, I sat
through all of the latest Neil
Simon-Herbert Ross collabora
tor Max Dugan Returns, pos
sibly as penance for skipping
the last two Simons, Only
When I Laugh and I Ought to

Be in Pictures. (They sounded
like exactly the same movie.)
Max Dugan Returns isn't tor

wards as it you'd killed a
couple of brain cells, lason
Robards lends his welcome
presence to the role of a dying
renegade who forces his es
tranged daughter (Marsha Ma

movie is a pointless, embarras
sing bomb, and it's directed —
by a man known for his ex
perimental films — like a per
fume commercial. I crept out
after the interminable first
hour.
On the other hand, I sat
through all of the latest Neil
Simon-Herbert Ross collabora
tor Max Dugan Returns, pos
sibly as penance for skipping
the last two Simons, Only
When I Laugh and I Ought to

Be in Pictures. (They sounded
like exactly the same movie.)
Max Dugan Returns isn't tor
ture, really, but you feel after
wards as it you'd killed a
couple of brain cells, lason
Robards lends his welcome
presence to the role of a dying
renegade who forces his es
tranged daughter (Marsha Ma
son), a widow schoolteacher,
and her teenage son (Matthew
Broderick), to adopt him and
then wins their hearts. Mason
is worse than usual (and she's
usually pretty uninspired), in
clothes and a hairdo that make
her look like Sandy Dennis in
Come Back to the > & Dime,
limmy Dean, limmy Dean, and
Donald Sutherland, miscast as
an L.A. cop, looks like he can't
figure out why Ross cast them
opposite each other. (He's not
alone.) I used to resent Neil
Simon's skill at getting off one
liners because they blinded
audiences to the queasy
making amalgam of mean
spiritedness and sentimental
ity underneath, but in the past
few years his jokes have be
come so worn that there's no
longer any reason to get upset.
In the most miscalculated
scene in Max Dugan Returns,
Mason and Sutherland — an
English major before entering
police academy — exchange
favorite authors. Mason says
she prefers Austen because
you can depend on her, and
Sutherland says he likes Thac
keray because he makes you
work. This isn't a movie for
people who read.
