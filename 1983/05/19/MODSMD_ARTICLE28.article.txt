# 'War': dealing you two sides of deep music

Island Records

The third album by the Dublin band U2 is called War.
Ironically, the album has been No. 1 on the charts of
both Ireland and England, and is presently in the top 10
on the American charts. I'd also lay odds that this album
is also high on the charts in Lebanon, Israel, Argentina
and El Salvador, if, of course, they have charts. If you
haven't figured out what these various countries have in
common, the answer can easily be found in one of the
truest lines uttered onthisalbum — "And so we are told
this is the golden age; and gold is the reason for the wars
we wage."
The band, U2, although previously known for their
psychedelic-punk singles "I Will Follow" and "Gloria"
(off the erratic albums Boy and October respectively),
has jumped suddenly into a musical-political format that
elevates the band to the status of the Clash. This album,
then, should catch even the most rabid U2 fans off
guard, since the group displays a cohesive powerful
quality that has been previously lacking. It may, in fact,
be the finest thing that has come out of the British
Commonwealth (Ireland included) since the Clash's
London Calling album of 1979.
Undoubtedly, the album succeeds because it tackles
the issue of war without falling into the usual pitfalls that

other musical commentaries on war have succumbed to.
Instead, U2 attacks war with an honest heart, a sensitive
soul and a manic passion. The band forcefully and emo
tionally lets the blood start flowing on the album's open
ing track, "Sunday Bloody Sunday," and continually cas
tigates war and its consequences throughout the re
mainder of the album.
But in the album's anti-war and anti-nuclear sen
sibilities, it never pretends to have all (or even any)
solutions. This album refuses to create false poses of
hope. It is not an album that has all the answers. How
ever, what it does have is a belief and a power that needs
to be heard and carried out — "And the battle's just
begun; There's many lost, but tell me who has won?;
The trenches dug within our hearts, and mother's chil
dren, brothers, sisters torn apart . . . How long, how
long must we sing this song — how long?"
Throughout, the album describes the pessimistic
truths of our nuclear world along with presenting the
more optimistic hopes for love to prevail. While the
harsh horrors of "Seconds" are continually with us ("Say
goodbye, say goodbye . . . push the button and pull the
plug, say goodbye"), there is still in "Drowning Man"
the contrasting beauties of life and love ("The storms
will pass; It won't be long now; The storms will pass, but
my love lasts forever"). The strength of this album lies in
U2's ability to state that they (and we, the people), won't
stand for the governments of the world to use nuclear
power for selfish aggrandizements. They exclaim fer

vently that they won't stand for any hypocrisies or in
equalities, no matter the consequences — "And we love
to wear a badge, a uniform; And we love to fly a flag; But
I won't let others live in hell
However, the social commentary and inherent
themes of War are not the only qualities that this band
has conquered. Their musical sound also has taken a
quantum leap in both energy and substance. The band's
range has branched out and the subtleties of the
rhythms are quite diverse (compare the funk beat of
"Two Hearts Beat As One" to the very European and
waltzy intro to "Drowning Man"). The band communi
cates through their emotive musicianship the feelings of
war and their passions against it. The main kinetic force
comes forth from the band's lead guitarist, known as
"The Edge." Whatever the Edge's real name is, his guitar
is razor sharp and quite original (a sort of Ramones cum
Pete Townshend sound, if that is possible). His guitar
work is the powerful drive that enhances the vocals sung
by the lead singer, Bono Vox
A perfect interplay between the two can be heard
especially on "New Year's Day" where the heartbreak of
love in the face of death and war is dismissed due to the
frenzied passion of the guitar. Even though Bono Vox
tragically sings "Nothing changes on New Year's Day"
and realizes his imminent death if he goes to war, he still
can believe that "I will be with you again" because his
passion to live and love is in the music.
It is an admirable step for a band to devote itself to so

worthy a cause, especially since the band has never
really received any acclaimed success before. That
people are listening, buying, and believing this album is
a testament to the group's abilities as well as a testament
to the immediacy of the themes found on this album. If
for no other reason, War is a statement album that suc
ceeds in condemning war. Now only if someone would
send a copy of this record to Reagan and Ms. Thatcher —
ahh, but nothing changes on New Year's Day.
