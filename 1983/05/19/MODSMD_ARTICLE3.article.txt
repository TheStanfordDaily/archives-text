With the help of a $600,000 grant,
the University has established an
arms control center which will ex
pand the Stanford Arms Control and
Disarmament Program.
The four-year Hewlett Foundation
grant has helped transform the 12-
year-old-program — which is already
"one of the most successful
university-based arms contrgl pro
grams in the country," according to
Political Science Prof. Alexander
George — into the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Control.
The Center "fulfills a three-fold
mandate" designed to strengthen
undergraduate programs, graduate
and post-graduate fellowships and
public outreach in arms control and
international security fields, said
Coit Blacker, associate director of
the Center.
"Our first goal is to promote un
dergraduate education," said
Blacker. Beginning in academic year
1984-85, the Center will offer a
three-quarter course sequence
under the auspices of the Political
Science Department on international
security and arms control.
Blacker said the new curriculum
will "stretch" the exisiting Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Program from
two to three quarters.
The Center will also "expand fel
lowship opportunities for graduate
students and post-doctoral scholars"
with special emphasis .on the re
cruitment of qualified candidates
from Japan and China, according to
Blacker.

Center directors will hold annual
competitions for these fellowships,
which will be open to candidates in
the natural and physical sciences, in
addition to such disciplines as politi
cal science and history.

The Center also hopes to expand
the scope and intensity of public out
reach in the program. A series of
weekend and summer programs will
address such "highly targeted"
groups as journalists and congres
sional staffs, according to Blacker.
The Center joins a handful of simi
lar arms control institutes around the
country, including facilities at Cor
nell, Harvard and UCLA. "We have 12
