# $600,000 grant
## Gift paves way for new arms center 
### TROY EID Staff writer 
With the help of a $600,000 grant,
the University has established an
arms control center which will ex
pand the Stanford Arms Control and
Disarmament Program.
The four-year Hewlett Foundation
grant has helped transform the 12-
year-old-program — which is already
"one of the most successful
university-based arms contrgl pro
grams in the country," according to
Political Science Prof. Alexander
George — into the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Control.
The Center "fulfills a three-fold
mandate" designed to strengthen
undergraduate programs, graduate
and post-graduate fellowships and
public outreach in arms control and
international security fields, said
Coit Blacker, associate director of
the Center.
"Our first goal is to promote un
dergraduate education," said
Blacker. Beginning in academic year
1984-85, the Center will offer a
three-quarter course sequence
under the auspices of the Political
Science Department on international
security and arms control.
Blacker said the new curriculum
will "stretch" the exisiting Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Program from
two to three quarters.
The Center will also "expand fel
lowship opportunities for graduate
students and post-doctoral scholars"
with special emphasis .on the re
cruitment of qualified candidates
from Japan and China, according to
Blacker.

Center directors will hold annual
competitions for these fellowships,
which will be open to candidates in
the natural and physical sciences, in
addition to such disciplines as politi
cal science and history.

The Center also hopes to expand
the scope and intensity of public out
reach in the program. A series of
weekend and summer programs will
address such "highly targeted"
groups as journalists and congres
sional staffs, according to Blacker.
The Center joins a handful of simi
lar arms control institutes around the
country, including facilities at Cor
nell, Harvard and UCLA. "We have 12


Alexander George
years of experience which we think is
as good or better than any other pro
gram," said Blacker.
He cited the diversity of the Cen
ter's faculty, which has been in
creased from 18 to 42 scholars, and
noted that John Lewis, the William
Haas professor of Chinese Politics,
will continue as director.
Visiting scholars at the Center will
include Larry Smith, executive di
rector of Harvard's Center for Sci
ence and International Affairs, and
Prof. David Holloway, internationally
known Soviet specialist at the Uni
versity of Edinburgh.
Marilyn Russell, assistant to the
program officer in education at the
Hewlett Foundation, said the four
year general support grant to the
Center marks "the first time Hewlett

has worked in arms control pro
grams."
Hewlett will use the Center as a
test site for future arms control pro
grams at other universities, Russell
said. The Menlo Park-based founda
tion has previously provided grants
for "international education pro
grams" at several American univer
sities, including Stanford, Princeton,
Yale and Johns Hopkins, she added.
The Ford Foundation, Weingart
Foundation, Columbia Foundation
and anonymous private donors have
provided financial assistance to the
Center.
"I think it's an exciting develop
ment," said George, who will be in
residence on a half-time basis at the
Center during the 1983-84 year. "I'm
very happy with the half-time ar
rangement."
George said he will help advance
the Center's work via research in

United States-Soviet relations in ad
dition to teaching a political science
seminar on diplomacy autumn quar
ter.
Sidney Drell, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, said, "I'm very excited by it (the
Center)." He "was a founding
member" of the Program "and will
continue to be involved" in activities
at the Center, he said.
"Sound financial foundation" will
"strengthen existing Program ac
tivities" at the Center, according to
Drell. He noted the "expertise" of
the program's teaching and research
faculty, which includes SLAC Di
rector Wolfgang Panofsky and Wil
liam Perry, former undersecretary of
defense under President Carter.
"The point of this is to be a diverse
group," said Drell. "In that diversity
we feel lies our strength."

address such "highly targeted"
groups as journalists and congres
sional staffs, according to Blacker.
The Center joins a handful of simi
lar arms control institutes around the
country, including facilities at Cor
nell, Harvard and UCLA. "We have 12

years of experience which we think is
as good or better than any other pro
gram," said Blacker.
He cited the diversity of the Cen
ter's faculty, which has been in
creased from 18 to 42 scholars, and
noted that John Lewis, the William
Haas professor of Chinese Politics,
will continue as director.
Visiting scholars at the Center will
include Larry Smith, executive di
rector of Harvard's Center for Sci
ence and International Affairs, and
Prof. David Holloway, internationally
known Soviet specialist at the Uni
versity of Edinburgh.
Marilyn Russell, assistant to the
program officer in education at the
Hewlett Foundation, said the four
year general support grant to the
Center marks "the first time Hewlett

has worked in arms control pro
grams."
Hewlett will use the Center as a
test site for future arms control pro
grams at other universities, Russell
said. The Menlo Park-based founda
tion has previously provided grants
for "international education pro
grams" at several American univer
sities, including Stanford, Princeton,
Yale and Johns Hopkins, she added.
The Ford Foundation, Weingart
Foundation, Columbia Foundation
and anonymous private donors have
provided financial assistance to the
Center.
"I think it's an exciting develop
ment," said George, who will be in
residence on a half-time basis at the
Center during the 1983-84 year. "I'm
very happy with the half-time ar
rangement."
George said he will help advance
the Center's work via research in

United States-Soviet relations in ad
dition to teaching a political science
seminar on diplomacy autumn quar
ter.
Sidney Drell, deputy director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, said, "I'm very excited by it (the
Center)." He "was a founding
member" of the Program "and will
continue to be involved" in activities
at the Center, he said.
"Sound financial foundation" will
"strengthen existing Program ac
tivities" at the Center, according to
Drell. He noted the "expertise" of
the program's teaching and research
faculty, which includes SLAC Di
rector Wolfgang Panofsky and Wil
liam Perry, former undersecretary of
defense under President Carter.
"The point of this is to be a diverse
group," said Drell. "In that diversity
we feel lies our strength."
