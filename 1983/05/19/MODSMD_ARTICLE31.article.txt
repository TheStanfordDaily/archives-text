### RANDY BROBERG Staff writer 
Three East Palo Alto men were arrested yesterday
morning after two students in Hurlburt House called the
police when they saw the individuals "sneaking around"
on their porch.
Olan Brantley, .12, Scott Hamilton, 2b, and lames
Jackson were arrested at 1:20 a.m. Wednesday with the
help of students Patrick kwan and Tim Phillips, who were
thanked afterward by the Stanford Police Department.
Kwan said he was studying in his room near the porch
with his window open when he heard noises outside.
Phillips, who was unavailable for comment, saw the sus
pects and phoned the police, while Kwan watched them
stealing a bicycle. The bike was locked to the porch

railing, but the lock was cut clean as it with a bolt cutter,
Kwan said.
Immediately after the three men left in a car, Stanford
police officers picked them up and asked Kwan to verify
their identity. After a positive identification was made,
the three were taken into custody and charged with
possession of stolen property.
The bicycle was a Raleigh 10-speed that belonged to
Laura Charlton, another resident of Hurlburt. Charlton
was unavailable for comment.
Captain Raoul Niemeyer of the Stanford police
claimed that students providing information leading to
arrests was "not unusual." But he also said, "it doesn't
happen enough, with the number of bike thefts on cam
pus. It is more unusual than it is the norm."
