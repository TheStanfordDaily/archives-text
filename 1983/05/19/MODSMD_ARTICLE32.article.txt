Lunch bunch
Today's staff lunch is very special.
Larry Liebert, political reporter for
the San Francisco Chronicle and
former editor of several Daily de
partments, is the featured speaker.
As a real treat, Karen got innovative
foodâ€”well, meat and rolls anyway.
The traditional salty tortilla chips will
return.
Fall volume
There are two days left to talk to
Kristen Christopherand Heather Mil
lar about what you want to do for the

Daily next fall; sign-up on the door
inside the Daily office or give us a
call if you're really bogged down.
Love that beef
The annual, always festive Daily
spring banquet is just around the
corner; Karen has already make res
ervations at a Chinese restaurant that
makes a delicious beef dish. But of
course you can have a vegetarian
meal if you so desire, and to be
honest, you probably won't get any
beef anyway. The date is May 30;
meet at the Daily office at 6:30 p.m.
for drinks. The banquet starts at 7:30
p.m.
