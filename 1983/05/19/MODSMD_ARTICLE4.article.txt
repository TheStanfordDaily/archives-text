# Kappa Alpha Theta gets the nod: University grants recognition
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
The University officially recognized Kappa
Alpha Theta yesterday, making it the third
sorority to be granted recognition this year.
The recognition will allow the sorority to
call itself the official Stanford chapter of the
national Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and will
permit the group to hold meetings on cam
pus, something that unrecognized sororities
and fraternities are not allowed to do.
According to Cindy Howell, a Theta
member who coordinated the recognition
drive for the group, the ability to legally
meet on campus will be a big help to the
sorority.
"Now whenever we want to be together
we don't have to worry about going off cam
pus. We can just go to the Coffee House and

have a beer," Howell said.
Theta member Chris Wall agreed.
"We've been meeting at the Oak Creek
Apartments, but now we can have formals
on campus if we want to. Before, even if we
wanted to have a party at the Boathouse we
had to rent it out under someone else's
name," she said.
However, Wall said that the sorority's offi
cers have met informally on a regular basis at
Tresidder Union.
Diana Conklin, Row director, said she did
not know if the Thetas had been meeting on
campus but that if she had known earlier it
could have hurt the group's chances for rec
ognition.
During the year-and-a-half effort to earn
recognition, the sorority had to prove to the
University that it had "local autonomy in all

matters," Conklin said.
"They clarified that the national officers
advised only, that they do not control chap
ter policies or activities. They clarified that
the chapter may or may not follow the na
tional's advice. The national had to confirm
that all decisions are in the hands of the local
chapter," Conklin explained.
An important element of the decision
whether or not to grant recognition was the
sorority's usage of alumni recom
mendations. According to Conklin, many
national sororities want local chapters to
take into consideration recommendations
submitted by the sorority's alumni when
selecting new members. The University,
however, does not allow such consid
erations in chapters here.
As a compromise move, the national has

agreed that the local chapter will have on file
recommendations for each member, but
that it will not use those recommendations
in selecting new members.
"At a school where you have 1300 to 1400
girls rushing, a lot of sororities use the rec
ommendations to screen girls. But we don't
have that many girls rushing, so we can meet
with them personally," Howell explained.
Neither Conklin nor Howell knew what
the sorority would use the recom
mendations for, but only that each member
would have one on file.
The other two sororities which have
gained recognition this year are Sigma Delta
Tau and Alpha Delta Phi. Delta Gamma has
also been recognized.
Conklin said a number of sororities and
fraternities are currently in "varying stages"

of attempts to be recognized. Sororities
Alpha Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta,
Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Phi, and frater
nities Alpha Phi Alpha, Omega Psi Phi, Zeta
Psi and Sigma Alpha Mu are all attempting to
gain University recognition.
However, because of a freeze on Univer
sity housing for fraternities and sororities,
none of the groups will be able to get a
house until after a review of the Creek sys
tem here is completed next year.
Although no Stanford sororities currently
have houses on campus, Conklin said there
is no permanent University policy which
prohibits — or allows — them to have their
own houses.
According to Howell, the Thetas are not
concerned with having their own house.
