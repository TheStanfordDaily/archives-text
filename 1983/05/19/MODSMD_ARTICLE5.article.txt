# New York University case settled but photocopy law still a mystery

The out-of-court settlement last month of a copyright
infringement suit has left many educators — including
professors here—uncertain of the legal limits of repro
ducing copyrighted materials.
The group of publishers that charged New York Uni
versity (NYU), nine of its professors and an off-campus
copy shop with copyright infringement, settled with
NYU and its professors in April.
Many educators and printers were disappointed that
the case was not resolved in court, where a judicial
ruling could have clarified the somewhat vague
academic copying rights allowed under the Federal
Copyright Act.
The out-of-court settlement caused many professors
to remain unsure of the precise limits of their copying
rights.
History Prof. Gordon Wright said the NYU suit made
him reconsider giving his students more packets of
copied material.
"I thought I had better not do something that might be
illegal," he said.
'he "fair use" clause of the Copyright Act of
states that the reproduction of copyrighted materials
tor purposes such as . . . teaching (including multiple
copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is

not an infringement of copyright."
This means that the strict boundaries for the "fair use"
of copyrighted materials — length and content, for
example — are "left open to translation," according to
Bob Van De Weerd, manager of Kinko's Copies in Palo
Alto.
But the NYU settlement did not further clarify what "is
or is not fair use," according to Staff Counsel Iris Brest.
"It did not add any new, substantive guidelines,"
Brest said.
As part of the settlement, NYU agreed to promulgate a
set of minimum guidelines for reproducing copyrighted
material. These guidelines were devised seven years ago
by a group of publishers, writers and educators.
The guidelines define the nature and amount of mate
rial teachers may copy without seeking permission from
the publisher — hut they are narrower than many
photocopying shops would like.
NYU will refer to these minimum guidelines when
advising its faculty members on whether permission for
copying needs to be sought.
If faculty members are charged with copyright infring
ement after the university has advised them to proceed
with their copying, the university will pay their court
expenses.
