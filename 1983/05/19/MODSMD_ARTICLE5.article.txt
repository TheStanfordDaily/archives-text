# New York University case settled but photocopy law still a mystery

### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
The out-of-court settlement last month of a copyright
infringement suit has left many educators — including
professors here—uncertain of the legal limits of repro
ducing copyrighted materials.
The group of publishers that charged New York Uni
versity (NYU), nine of its professors and an off-campus
copy shop with copyright infringement, settled with
NYU and its professors in April.
Many educators and printers were disappointed that
the case was not resolved in court, where a judicial
ruling could have clarified the somewhat vague
academic copying rights allowed under the Federal
Copyright Act.
The out-of-court settlement caused many professors
to remain unsure of the precise limits of their copying
rights.
History Prof. Gordon Wright said the NYU suit made
him reconsider giving his students more packets of
copied material.
"I thought I had better not do something that might be
illegal," he said.
'he "fair use" clause of the Copyright Act of
states that the reproduction of copyrighted materials
tor purposes such as . . . teaching (including multiple
copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is

not an infringement of copyright."
This means that the strict boundaries for the "fair use"
of copyrighted materials — length and content, for
example — are "left open to translation," according to
Bob Van De Weerd, manager of Kinko's Copies in Palo
Alto.
But the NYU settlement did not further clarify what "is
or is not fair use," according to Staff Counsel Iris Brest.
"It did not add any new, substantive guidelines,"
Brest said.
As part of the settlement, NYU agreed to promulgate a
set of minimum guidelines for reproducing copyrighted
material. These guidelines were devised seven years ago
by a group of publishers, writers and educators.
The guidelines define the nature and amount of mate
rial teachers may copy without seeking permission from
the publisher — hut they are narrower than many
photocopying shops would like.
NYU will refer to these minimum guidelines when
advising its faculty members on whether permission for
copying needs to be sought.
If faculty members are charged with copyright infring
ement after the university has advised them to proceed
with their copying, the university will pay their court
expenses.
Lynn Hawkes, special projects coordinator for Kinko's
Graphics, said the guidelines in the NYU settlement are
"extremely restrictive" and counter-productive.
"They cause more harm than good," she said.
But Carol Risher, director of the Association of Ameri
can Publisher's copyright division, said the NYU guide
lines clarify professors' photocopying rights.
"This creates a model for universities around the
country," Risher said.
The private photocopying shop that was also named in
the publishers' suit against NYU was not a party to the
settlement. The Unique Copy Center has filed a coun
tersuit against the publishers, charging them with anti
trust violations.
Kinko's Graphics is giving financial support to this
copy shop.
"We obviously have a strong interest that fair use is

adequately defended," Hawkes said. Professors are
"very good customers" of photocopying shops, she
said.
Hawkes said the printers hope that Unique will not
settle out of court. The Copyright Act was passed by
Congress on the assumption that case law would estab
lish the maximum guidelines for fair use, Hawkes said.
Unfortunately, there has not been much judicial action,
she said.
According to Van De Weerd, the "bad publicity"
about the suit caused Stanford professors to be "much
more concerned than I have ever seen them before."
Although the lawsuit did not hurt his business, Van De
Weerd said, his growth rate was not as high as he had
expected.
Risher said the publishers sued NYU because they
wanted to show the public "that our members are seri
ous about enforcing their copyrights."
But Van De Weerd said the publishers were being
excessively zealous in this quest.
"They'd be quite happy if every single American paid a
royalty to copy a recipe out of a book," he said.
