Syria rejects Habib mission
Beirut — U.S. presidential envoy Philip Habib his
mission rebuffed by Syria — returned to Beirut last
night to help the Lebanese in their attempt to over
come Syria's opposition to the Israeli-Lebanese troop
withdrawal agreement.
Lebanese officials said Habib would meet with Pres
ident Amin Gemayel, Prime Minister Shafik Wazzan,
an <i U.S. sources in Beirut said he had planned to go to
Damascus, the Syrian capital, today.
Nut the Syrian government said it would not receive
American troubleshooter because it had "noth
to discuss" with him. It called him "one of the
m, )st hostile American officials to the Arabs and their

The Syrians also announced they would not nego
tiate with the Lebanese government on the withdraw
al of the 40,000 Syrian troops and 8000 to 12,000
Palestinian guerrillas in northern and eastern Leba
non.
This promised the continuance of the division of
mjch of Lebanon into occupied Syrian and Israeli
zones since Israel will not carry out its agreement to
withdraw its 25,000 troops in southern and central
Lebanon unless the Syrians and Palestinians pull out
simultaneously.
The White House said it regretted that the Syrians
would not talk with Habib. But before the rebuff,
President Reagan said at a news conference Tuesday
night he was confident Syria would overcome its res
ervations and agree to withdraw its troops.
"I can't believe that the Syrians want to find them
selves alone, separated from all of their Arab allies,"
said Reagan.
Senate approves immigration bill
Washington — The Senate approved, 76-18, a his
toric immigration reform bill yesterday that would al
low millions of illegal aliens in the United States to be
come permanent, legal residents, while imposing
criminal sanctions on employers who hire illegal al
iens in the future.
The compromise bill was steered by author Sen.
Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) through opposition from
Western growers and civil liberties groups. A similar
measure, passed by the House Judiciary Committee,
faces a tough hurdle on the House floor later this year.
But unlike a similar measure that died in the last Con
gress, some form of the bill is expected to win House
approval and become law this year.
"The bill is not nativist, not racist, not mean. I'm
proud of it," Simpson said before the final vote. Al
though some controversial differences remain be
tween the House and Senate versions, he concluded
that "there isn't a thing in herethat isn't reconcilable"
in time for President Reagan's signature this year.
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) who voted againstthe
measure, said that it was "a major step toward a police
state" because, in setting up a national worker-identi
fication system, it would "require every person in the
U.S. to have some form of authorization by his or her
government in order to work."
U.S. wins support at summit
Washington — The United States has won tentative
agreement from six other industrialized nations to
adopt a joint economic recovery policy that will min
imize trade and monetary conflicts at their summit
conference in Williamsburg later this month, in
formed sources said yesterday.
The U.S. working paper on the summit, which was
presented at a preparatory meeting in Paris last week,
represents an effort to avoid confrontation and to
strike a balance between continuing American con
cern over East-West trade and European demands for
American action on high interest rates, budget defi
cits and volatile foreign exchange markets, these
sources reported.
In addition to seeking to reduce the sharp conflicts
that broke into the open at last year's seven-nation
economic summit in France, the Reagan adminis
tration also will reportedly seek a political declaration
at the meeting endorsing the deployment of a new
generation of American nuclear missiles in Western
Europe, now scheduled to begin in December.
The heads of state of Britain, Canada, France, Italy,
Japan and West Germany and officials of the Europe
an Community will meet with President Reagan at
Williamsburg, Va., on May 28 and 29.
Budget blocked in Senate
Washington — The refusal of Senate Majority Lead
er Howard Baker to support a bipartisan budget plan
because it was backed by a minority of Budget Com
mittee Republicans prevented an end yesterday to
the Senate's budgetary paralysis.
Five of the committee's 12 Republicans had ap
peared ready to back the plan. However, Baker said
he would refuse to support it because of the lack of
support of a majority of Republicans — later in
terpreted as six.
As a result, the Senate wound up as uncertain as
ever that it would be able to produce a set of tax and
spending guidelines this year. Senators will get their
last chance to approve a budget — and to send it to a
conference committee with a version passed by the

House — in a series of votes scheduled for today.
If the Senate comes up with nothing, the eight
year-old congressional budget process will have ex
perienced its first collapse. But the lack of a budget
would greatly help President Reagan's new strategy of
using his veto power to obtain his domestic spending
cuts and to preserve his defense buildup and tax-cut
programs.
Soviets block charity fund
Moscow — Soviet authorities, having all but extin
guished the country's organized human rights move
ment, have launched a harsh new attack on a chari
table fund sponsored by exiled writer Alexander
Solzhenitsyn for families of political prisoners.
For nearly a decade, royalties that Solzhenitsyn has
earned in the West from his monumental history of
death and privation in Soviet labor camps, the "Gulag
Archipelago," have been filtering back to the Nobel
laureate's homeland to feed and clothe the wives and
children of Gulag's current inmates, as well as the
prisoners themselves.
Dissident sources say that more than 1000 families
have benefited from the Solzhenitsyn fund since its
inception in April 1974, two months after the Soviet
Union deported the writer, who now lives in the Unit
ed States.
Now a young man involved in distributing benefits
from the fund, Valery Repin, 32, is on trial in Lenin
grad for high treason, and the fund's principal Soviet
coordinator in Moscow, Sergei Khodorovich, is un
der arrest on unspecified charges.
Court upholds literacy test
Atlanta — A federal appeals court yesterday upheld
Florida's controversial functional literacy test, allow
ing the state to withhold diplomas from about 1300
seniors who failed the exam.
A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals denied a motion for the stay in a 2-1 ruling
with Judge Phyllis Kravitch dissenting.
Judges James Hill and A.J. Henderson upheld the
state without comment.
"This case raises a close legal question, resolution
of which requires a balancing of significant interest
on both sides," the dissenting judge wrote. "Because
the appellants will be irreparably harmed pending a
resolution on the merits, I would grant the stay."
The first high school graduation in Florida is Thurs
day.
Attorney Steve Hanlon, who guided the suit
through nearly six years of legal battles, said he didn't
know yet whether he would take the case to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
"I'm certainly encouraged that a judge such as
Judge Kravitch voted to grant the stay and acknowl
edged there are close legal questions involved. We'll
have to consider a lot of issues," Hanlon said.
"I have not fully considered what I'm going to do. I
will discuss those options tonight."
