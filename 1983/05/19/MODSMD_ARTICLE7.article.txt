# Faculty questions grade inequities
## 
### SID ATKINS Senior staff writer 
• "Techies" complain that "fuzzies" get A's in easy
five-unit classes while they pull all-nighters for B's in
their three-unit killers.
• Students in political science accuse students in
history that "in their department, it's almost impossi
ble to get a C."
• One engineering student claims electrical en
gineers' grades are much higher than mechanical or
industrial engineers' and that EEs are therefore
grossly over-represented in Tau Beta Pi, the engineer
ing honors society.
The accuracy of such statements is unclear since
the University has refused to release statistics on in
terdepartmental grading differences. The Registrar's
Office compiles a statistical study of grades given in
each department every quarter, but this report is
distributed to the deans of major schools and de
partment chairmen only, and is not available to the
public.
Registrar Sally Mahoney explained, "The report is
not released because of long-standing custom that
goes back for many years. Practice over time has the

force of policy."
Another policy of custom — the fact that few, if any,
departments have articulated grading policies —
further clouds the issue of whether interdepartmen
tal grading discrepancies exist.
In addition, the issue of how grades and grading
policies vary between departments has often been
overlooked amidst more concern with overall grade
inflation.
Still, it would be difficult to deny that good grades
flow more easily in some departments than others.
Law Prof. |ohn Kaplan, called this "the biggest
scandal in the school," adding, "I think some de
partments may simply be inflating grades to buy stu
dents and majors."
Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost and dean of
graduate studies, said that while he doesn't believe
there is overall grade inflation here but hinted that it
may exist in some departments.
"I'm not making a pejorative statement about one
department or another, but I don't think that CPAs for
engineers are too high, for instance," said Lieher-
man. "The law school thinks
that all their applicants from
here have high grades, but I
don't think they get too many
engineers."
Neither Lieberman nor any
other administrator would
pinpoint the specific depart
ments where grade inflation
might exist — and the regis
trar's report remains confiden
tial.
Mahoney considers the re
port to be filled with "raw
data," and therefore said she is
uncertain whether it would
provide relevant information
about inter-departmental grad
ing differences.
Most of the deans and
chairmen who were contacted

had long since filed their copy
of the report away in a not eas
ily accessible place, and were
reluctant to look for it because
of its "classified" nature. Kap
lan, however, is determined to
dig it up. He says he will take
the matter to the provost and
president if necessary.

"If I was sure that nothing
was in those breakdowns, I
wouldn't bother. But I think
there are things of consider
able interest," Kaplan said.
Mahoney said the Commit
tee on Academic Achievement
and Appraisal (C-AAA) has
jurisdiction over grading mat
ters, but the Registrar's Office
has expressed interest in ob
taining more specific data.
"I would take the advice of
the C-AAA very seriously," said
Mahoney. "They do an analysis
of trends at the major school
level every five years, and this
is the information that they feel
is relevant."
In October of 1980, the
C-AAA released a report com
paring grades in the major

schools, which placed the
number of A's in Humanities
and Sciences at 36 percent,
while the School of Engineer
ing had 31 percent A's.
The report also said that
there were too many high
grades at Stanford — 60 per
cent of all grades were A's and

B's — and recommended that
professors here assign grades
according to their literal defini
tions in order to decrease the
number of high grades (Literal
definition of grades: A = ex
ceptional performance, B =
superior performance, C
satisfactory performance, D =
minimal pass).
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Norm Wessells said a
special committee will be look
ing into the grades in H & S
over the next year to try to give
them a feel for where they
stand in relation to the rest of
the University on grading.
With regard to the
humanities versus engineering
question, Wessells said, "I'd
be surprised if there is a big
difference." Wessells said that
some differences are bound to

exist because students pro
duce different work for evalua
tion in engineering classes
than for humanities classes.
"It's a different kind of work if
you're writing one essay for
your only grade compared with
two or three objective exams,"
Wessells said.

All of the 10 department
chairmen contacted said that
there were no particular stan
dards within their departments
regarding grading. French De
partment Chairman Alphonse
)uilland said, "There are as
many different grading
philosophies in our depart
ment as there are professors."
Chemistry Department
Chairman )ohn Brauman said
there are some courses in
chemistry where nearly all stu
dents receive A's and B's, es
pecially at the upper levels. "By
that time students are compe
tent and interested, so they are
very good and get higher
grades," he said.
Brauman emphasized that
there is no department policy.
But he said that in chemistry
there are objective standards
accepted across the country to
measure students by. "So if
Stanford has better students,
then we may give higher
grades than other schools and
that's all right," Brauman said.
Prof. Lorenz Eitner, Art De
partment chairman, said he
reads each blue book himself
and uses no curves. "I have no
absolute standards of grading
because classes vary tremen
dously — some are better than
others," Eitner said.
Some students believe that
"tougher" departments are try
ing to discourage enrollments
in their major. But as Prof. John
Shoven of the Economics De
partment pointed out, that is
not necessarily the case. Eco
nomics is planningto put more
mathematics in its under
graduate courses and will
make other related changes in
their major.
"It works both ways," Sho
ven said. "A lot of students are
looking for good, hard classes
now. Engineering-Economic
Systems is thriving because it is
viewed as being curriculum
with some rigor in it."
Industrial Engineering has a
student-faculty ratio that is
twice the University average,
but Department Chairman
Warren Hausman said that IE
doesn't discourage students by
tightening up on grades.
"We are putting in depth re
quirements which may lower
the number of people in the
major. That's going to be inter
preted by students as a tighten
ing up," Hausman said.
While none of the chairmen
said they knew anything about
how their department com
pared with others in grading,
most said they would be in
terested to learn. Prof. Carolyn
Lougee, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences,
agreed that increased interest
in grading policies has been
generated.
"We are becoming con
cerned and its going to be
close to the top of our agenda
in the next six months,"
Lougee said.

departments have articulated grading policies —
further clouds the issue of whether interdepartmen
tal grading discrepancies exist.
In addition, the issue of how grades and grading
policies vary between departments has often been
overlooked amidst more concern with overall grade
inflation.
Still, it would be difficult to deny that good grades
flow more easily in some departments than others.
Law Prof. |ohn Kaplan, called this "the biggest
scandal in the school," adding, "I think some de
partments may simply be inflating grades to buy stu
dents and majors."
Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost and dean of
graduate studies, said that while he doesn't believe
there is overall grade inflation here but hinted that it
may exist in some departments.
"I'm not making a pejorative statement about one
department or another, but I don't think that CPAs for
engineers are too high, for instance," said Lieher-
man. "The law school thinks
that all their applicants from
here have high grades, but I
don't think they get too many
engineers."
Neither Lieberman nor any
other administrator would
pinpoint the specific depart
ments where grade inflation
might exist — and the regis
trar's report remains confiden
tial.
Mahoney considers the re
port to be filled with "raw
data," and therefore said she is
uncertain whether it would
provide relevant information
about inter-departmental grad
ing differences.
Most of the deans and
chairmen who were contacted

had long since filed their copy
of the report away in a not eas
ily accessible place, and were
reluctant to look for it because
of its "classified" nature. Kap
lan, however, is determined to
dig it up. He says he will take
the matter to the provost and
president if necessary.

"If I was sure that nothing
was in those breakdowns, I
wouldn't bother. But I think
there are things of consider
able interest," Kaplan said.
Mahoney said the Commit
tee on Academic Achievement
and Appraisal (C-AAA) has
jurisdiction over grading mat
ters, but the Registrar's Office
has expressed interest in ob
taining more specific data.
"I would take the advice of
the C-AAA very seriously," said
Mahoney. "They do an analysis
of trends at the major school
level every five years, and this
is the information that they feel
is relevant."
In October of 1980, the
C-AAA released a report com
paring grades in the major

schools, which placed the
number of A's in Humanities
and Sciences at 36 percent,
while the School of Engineer
ing had 31 percent A's.
The report also said that
there were too many high
grades at Stanford — 60 per
cent of all grades were A's and

B's — and recommended that
professors here assign grades
according to their literal defini
tions in order to decrease the
number of high grades (Literal
definition of grades: A = ex
ceptional performance, B =
superior performance, C
satisfactory performance, D =
minimal pass).
Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Norm Wessells said a
special committee will be look
ing into the grades in H & S
over the next year to try to give
them a feel for where they
stand in relation to the rest of
the University on grading.
With regard to the
humanities versus engineering
question, Wessells said, "I'd
be surprised if there is a big
difference." Wessells said that
some differences are bound to

exist because students pro
duce different work for evalua
tion in engineering classes
than for humanities classes.
"It's a different kind of work if
you're writing one essay for
your only grade compared with
two or three objective exams,"
Wessells said.

All of the 10 department
chairmen contacted said that
there were no particular stan
dards within their departments
regarding grading. French De
partment Chairman Alphonse
)uilland said, "There are as
many different grading
philosophies in our depart
ment as there are professors."
Chemistry Department
Chairman )ohn Brauman said
there are some courses in
chemistry where nearly all stu
dents receive A's and B's, es
pecially at the upper levels. "By
that time students are compe
tent and interested, so they are
very good and get higher
grades," he said.
Brauman emphasized that
there is no department policy.
But he said that in chemistry
there are objective standards
accepted across the country to
measure students by. "So if
Stanford has better students,
then we may give higher
grades than other schools and
that's all right," Brauman said.
Prof. Lorenz Eitner, Art De
partment chairman, said he
reads each blue book himself
and uses no curves. "I have no
absolute standards of grading
because classes vary tremen
dously — some are better than
others," Eitner said.
Some students believe that
"tougher" departments are try
ing to discourage enrollments
in their major. But as Prof. John
Shoven of the Economics De
partment pointed out, that is
not necessarily the case. Eco
nomics is planningto put more
mathematics in its under
graduate courses and will
make other related changes in
their major.
"It works both ways," Sho
ven said. "A lot of students are
looking for good, hard classes
now. Engineering-Economic
Systems is thriving because it is
viewed as being curriculum
with some rigor in it."
Industrial Engineering has a
student-faculty ratio that is
twice the University average,
but Department Chairman
Warren Hausman said that IE
doesn't discourage students by
tightening up on grades.
"We are putting in depth re
quirements which may lower
the number of people in the
major. That's going to be inter
preted by students as a tighten
ing up," Hausman said.
While none of the chairmen
said they knew anything about
how their department com
pared with others in grading,
most said they would be in
terested to learn. Prof. Carolyn
Lougee, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences,
agreed that increased interest
in grading policies has been
generated.
"We are becoming con
cerned and its going to be
close to the top of our agenda
in the next six months,"
Lougee said.


HIGH BALL OR LOW BALL?: Student Nelson
Christensen and Lynn Kawamura smile at
spring registration as they pick up their
grades. Some members of the University

Arlie Streiber/Daily
community claim that smiles or frowns at this
time often depend on the students' major de
partment.
• "Techies" complain that "fuzzies" get A's in easy
five-unit classes while they pull all-nighters for B's in
their three-unit killers.
• Students in political science accuse students in
history that "in their department, it's almost impossi
ble to get a C."
• One engineering student claims electrical en
gineers' grades are much higher than mechanical or
industrial engineers' and that EEs are therefore
grossly over-represented in Tau Beta Pi, the engineer
ing honors society.
The accuracy of such statements is unclear since
the University has refused to release statistics on in
terdepartmental grading differences. The Registrar's
Office compiles a statistical study of grades given in
each department every quarter, but this report is
distributed to the deans of major schools and de
partment chairmen only, and is not available to the
public.
Registrar Sally Mahoney explained, "The report is
not released because of long-standing custom that
goes back for many years. Practice over time has the

force of policy."
