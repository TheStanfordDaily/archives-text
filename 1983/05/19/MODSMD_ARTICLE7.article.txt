# Faculty questions grade inequities

• "Techies" complain that "fuzzies" get A's in easy
five-unit classes while they pull all-nighters for B's in
their three-unit killers.
• Students in political science accuse students in
history that "in their department, it's almost impossi
ble to get a C."
• One engineering student claims electrical en
gineers' grades are much higher than mechanical or
industrial engineers' and that EEs are therefore
grossly over-represented in Tau Beta Pi, the engineer
ing honors society.
The accuracy of such statements is unclear since
the University has refused to release statistics on in
terdepartmental grading differences. The Registrar's
Office compiles a statistical study of grades given in
each department every quarter, but this report is
distributed to the deans of major schools and de
partment chairmen only, and is not available to the
public.
Registrar Sally Mahoney explained, "The report is
not released because of long-standing custom that
goes back for many years. Practice over time has the

force of policy."
Another policy of custom — the fact that few, if any,
departments have articulated grading policies —
further clouds the issue of whether interdepartmen
tal grading discrepancies exist.
In addition, the issue of how grades and grading
policies vary between departments has often been
overlooked amidst more concern with overall grade
inflation.
Still, it would be difficult to deny that good grades
flow more easily in some departments than others.
Law Prof. |ohn Kaplan, called this "the biggest
scandal in the school," adding, "I think some de
partments may simply be inflating grades to buy stu
dents and majors."
Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost and dean of
graduate studies, said that while he doesn't believe
there is overall grade inflation here but hinted that it
may exist in some departments.
"I'm not making a pejorative statement about one
department or another, but I don't think that CPAs for
engineers are too high, for instance," said Lieher-
