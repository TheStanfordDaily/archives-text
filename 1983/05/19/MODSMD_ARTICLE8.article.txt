### ALAN TRIPP Senior writer 
A Ph.D. candidate in electrical en
gineering was elected senate chair
on the fourth ballot at the first meet
ing of the 14th ASSU Senate last
night.
lug lagadish, who replaces former
chair Raga Elim, told the senators that
he hoped to lead the new senate "in
a drive toward eliminating red-tape
and regaining the confidence of the
student body.'^'
In 1981 lagadi'sh was general secre
tary of the student council at
the Indian fnstitute of Technology in
Delhi. He compared the job to that of
senate chair here. As an outsider
who has had occasion to observe the
proceedings of this' year's senate,
lagadish said he would "inject some
fresh blood into the ASSU" which
might lead to a "break with tradi

tion."
"A significant proportion of the
student body is disaffected with the
functioning of the ASSU," jagadish
said, mostly as a result of overly bur
densome rules and procedures. He
would like to see this changed, he
said.
"I'll be in a good position to help
you make the ASSU what you want it
to be," he added.
Some senators wondered if a
Ph.D. candidate might not be too
Â»jiusy with ac ademic work to fulfill the
'ft* ponsibilities of the chair. But
lagadisfci said he expected to have the
time.
As a third-year graduate student
next year, jagadish will have com
pleted his coursework and passed
the required examinations. He will
then have two to three years to com


Outgoing chair Raga Elim
plete his dissertation, a commitment
jagadish called "flexible."
He affirmed his commitment to
running "tight (senate) meetings,"
and said he would be capable of
doing so because of his prior experi
ence.
As an outsider to the ASSU,
Jagadish said he has "an advantage."
He will be able to claim "the com
plete neutrality which a senate chair
ought to have."
The job will be a "challenge and a
privilege."
