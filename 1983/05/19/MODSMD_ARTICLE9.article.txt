## New pressure on Nicaragua as guerrillas seize land Congressional support rising for Reagan plan 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire
services
Three weeks ago, President
Reagan faced the possibility of
an embarrassing defeat in
Congress over his Central
America policies.
Committees in the House
and in the Senate voted to scale
back military to El Salvador.
But the mood on Capitol Hill
has changed. Some of
Reagan's congressional critics
have muted their voices. Con
frontational tensions have
eased. And new, bipartisan
compromises are being forged
that impose some limits but
give the administration much
of what it wants.
The House and Senate
committees that earlier cut
administration requests for
military aid to El Salvador—
citing failure of the Salvadoran
regime to stem human rights
abuses that have claimed the
lives of thousands of
civilians—voted last week to
restore much of the aid, al
though with strings attached.
Even the House Intelligence
Committee, which voted May 3
to cut off all covert U.S. sup
port for anti-Sandinista rebels,
declined to put real teeth into
that measure. After a hot,

closed door debate last week,
the committee decided not to
reduce the U.S. government's
secret contingency fund tor
such operations.
What has brought about this
change? And what does it
mean tor the future of U.S. pol
icy in Central America?
Interviews with key con
gressmen caught in the middle
of the secrecy-shrouded Cent
ral America debate indicate
that some congressmen are
genuinely shifting their opin
ion about U.S activities in the
region, while others are back
ing off because they are afraid
they will be accused in the 1984
elections of being "soft on
Communism" or "losing El
Salvador."
Beginning in 1977 during the
Carter administration, the
United States has pumped
huge sums of money into tiny
El Salvador, hoping to stop
what Reagan has described as a
Marxist, Soviet-inspired re
volution there. The separate
covert action program in
Nicaragua was presented sec
retly to the House and Senate
Intelligence committees in De
cember 1981 as a U.S.-backed
effort by 500 men to stop the
flow of arms from Nicaragua's

Marxist government to the Sal
vadoran rebels.
Although the CIA and Re
agan administration have in
sisted that they seek only to
interdict the arms flow from
Nicaragua, critics charge that
they have misrepersented the
purpose and scope of the
anti-Sandinista operations.
The U.S.-backed rebel leaders
have said they hope to over
throw the Sandinista govern
ment.
When the House Intelli
gence committee's nine
Democrats voted against the
committee's five Republicans
May 3 to cut off all covert aid
for the operation, they also
voted to set up an $80 million
open aid program to friendly

Central American govern
ments, to assist them in stop
ping any arms sent over their
borders by the Sandinistas or
Cuba.
The next day Reagan de
nounced the committee's ac
tion and defended the anti-
Sandinista rebels as "freedom
fighters."
The House and Senate Intel
ligence Committee measures
limiting covert action in
Nicaragua do not have the
power of law yet, because they
have not been approved by
both the houses of Congress
and signed by the president.
While the measures work their
ways through the legislative
mill, other aid bills affecting El
Salvador also are pending.
