# Dean told senate-chair candidate not to run
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
A letter sent to junior Craig Spear
man by Norman Robinson, acting
dean of student affairs, may have
seriously hurt Spearman's chances in
Wednesday's ASSU Senate chair
election, according to ASSU sources.
The letter informed Spearman that
he "must . . . remove (his) name
from consideration for the post of
senate chair until such time as (he) is
again a registered student."
Spearman, who is suspended for
academic reasons but has petitioned
to register fall quarter, did not re
ceive the post in Wednesday's first
meeting of the Senate-elect. Spear
man claims that his chances were
"indubitably hurt" by Robinson's let
ter.
The former COP, senate chair,
deputy senate chair and current COP
sent a joint letter to Robinson pro
testing his letter to Spearman.
"I think is was inappropriate for
(Robinson) to interfere in ASSU af
fairs by interpreting by-laws that I'm
not sure he read," said former Dep
uty Senate Chair Roc Blumenthal.
"The letter he sent was unprofes
sional because he threatened
(Spearman)."
Robinson said, "People might
draw that implication (that the letter
was threatening) but that's not what I
meant. I meant that having a non
student participate in University ac
tivities was improper and something
would have to be done about it. Just
what that something may have been,
I don't know."
Blumenthal claims that the letter
misinterprets the ASSU Constitu
tion. "The major point is the eligibil
ity of Craig to be senate chair," said
Blumenthal. "Robinson included
passages from the Constitution and
the Campaign Practices Code which
are not applicable to the senate
chair and neglected to point out the
one section that was applicable."
Robinson sent the corre
spondence to Spearman Wednes
day, the day of the election, saying
that members of his office had tried
to reach Spearman but had been un
successful and therefore it was
necessary to communicate by letter.
The letter said, "You are not eligi
ble to run for senate chair. If the
Senate-Elect elects you in disregard
or ignorance of your ineligibility, I
will not let the matter go unnoticed
or uncorrected."
Soon after receipt of the letter,
Spearman informed former Senate
Chair Raga Elim that he was dropping
his name from consideration. At the
urging of Blumenthal, Spearman
later placed his name back on the
ballot — but only after the first meet

ing of the Senate-elect and consid
eration of the senate chair candi
dates had started.
According to Spearman, he met
Blumenthal after the senate meeting
had started and immediately rushed
over to the meeting to try to reinstate
his candidacy. "I think I gave the
worst impression possible. In a nut
shell, I just wasn't prepared. I had no
time to shower, shave, prepare my
statement ... In short, I had no time
to do the things that I was supposed
to do."
"He did sound as if he was speak
ing off the top of his head," said
Blumenthal. "He may have been at
some disadvantage."
"I took it as a direct order from the
dean of student affairs not to run for
senate chair," Spearman said. "I
took it as a direct warning: 'I am
going to make trouble for you.'
"There's a good chance that I
could have won, and my whole game
plan has been upset. I feel I was mis
led by the wording in the letter. I'd
like to see in writing what his reasons
are."
Spearman was suspended for
academic reasons last fall. He had
previously been on provisional regis
tration which requires that a student
must petition the Registrar's Office
to register and complete 12 units the
following quarter. Spearman's peti
tion was accepted but he later had to
stop out of school for economic rea
sons. The University does not allow
stopping out while on provisional
registration and suspended Spear
man for a year. Spearman has been
involved in the ASSU while trying to
raise money to return to school.
According to Spearman, Robinson
told him at a private meeting yester
day that he was primarily concerned
that Spearman concentrate on im
proving his economic situation so
that he might return to school.
"Writing that letter was something
that I was not looking forward to do
ing," said Robinson. "I was trying to
do something that would help Craig.
If I didn't think it was proper, I
wouldn't have sent it."
Robinson raised questions about
Spearman's academic standing.
"There are certain privileges that ac
crue to somebody that is a student —
that is participating in what's going
on. The senate can do what it wants,
but it would raise serious questions
about the senate's work if there were
people working for ASSU that were
not students. It would call into ques
tion the validity of (the senate's) ac
tions."

later placed his name back on the
ballot — but only after the first meet

ing of the Senate-elect and consid
eration of the senate chair candi
dates had started.
According to Spearman, he met
Blumenthal after the senate meeting
had started and immediately rushed
over to the meeting to try to reinstate
his candidacy. "I think I gave the
worst impression possible. In a nut
shell, I just wasn't prepared. I had no
time to shower, shave, prepare my
statement ... In short, I had no time
to do the things that I was supposed
to do."
"He did sound as if he was speak
ing off the top of his head," said
Blumenthal. "He may have been at
some disadvantage."
"I took it as a direct order from the
dean of student affairs not to run for
senate chair," Spearman said. "I
took it as a direct warning: 'I am
going to make trouble for you.'
"There's a good chance that I
could have won, and my whole game
plan has been upset. I feel I was mis
led by the wording in the letter. I'd
like to see in writing what his reasons
are."
Spearman was suspended for
academic reasons last fall. He had
previously been on provisional regis
tration which requires that a student
must petition the Registrar's Office
to register and complete 12 units the
following quarter. Spearman's peti
tion was accepted but he later had to
stop out of school for economic rea
sons. The University does not allow
stopping out while on provisional
registration and suspended Spear
man for a year. Spearman has been
involved in the ASSU while trying to
raise money to return to school.
According to Spearman, Robinson
told him at a private meeting yester
day that he was primarily concerned
that Spearman concentrate on im
proving his economic situation so
that he might return to school.
"Writing that letter was something
that I was not looking forward to do
ing," said Robinson. "I was trying to
do something that would help Craig.
If I didn't think it was proper, I
wouldn't have sent it."
Robinson raised questions about
Spearman's academic standing.
"There are certain privileges that ac
crue to somebody that is a student —
that is participating in what's going
on. The senate can do what it wants,
but it would raise serious questions
about the senate's work if there were
people working for ASSU that were
not students. It would call into ques
tion the validity of (the senate's) ac
tions."
A letter sent to junior Craig Spear
man by Norman Robinson, acting
dean of student affairs, may have
seriously hurt Spearman's chances in
Wednesday's ASSU Senate chair
election, according to ASSU sources.
The letter informed Spearman that
he "must . . . remove (his) name
from consideration for the post of
senate chair until such time as (he) is
again a registered student."
Spearman, who is suspended for
academic reasons but has petitioned
to register fall quarter, did not re
ceive the post in Wednesday's first
meeting of the Senate-elect. Spear
man claims that his chances were
"indubitably hurt" by Robinson's let
ter.
The former COP, senate chair,
deputy senate chair and current COP
sent a joint letter to Robinson pro
testing his letter to Spearman.
"I think is was inappropriate for
(Robinson) to interfere in ASSU af
fairs by interpreting by-laws that I'm
not sure he read," said former Dep
uty Senate Chair Roc Blumenthal.
"The letter he sent was unprofes
sional because he threatened
(Spearman)."
Robinson said, "People might
draw that implication (that the letter
was threatening) but that's not what I
meant. I meant that having a non
student participate in University ac
tivities was improper and something
would have to be done about it. Just
what that something may have been,
I don't know."
Blumenthal claims that the letter
misinterprets the ASSU Constitu
tion. "The major point is the eligibil
ity of Craig to be senate chair," said
Blumenthal. "Robinson included
passages from the Constitution and
the Campaign Practices Code which
are not applicable to the senate
chair and neglected to point out the
one section that was applicable."
Robinson sent the corre
spondence to Spearman Wednes
day, the day of the election, saying
that members of his office had tried
to reach Spearman but had been un
successful and therefore it was
necessary to communicate by letter.
The letter said, "You are not eligi
ble to run for senate chair. If the
Senate-Elect elects you in disregard
or ignorance of your ineligibility, I
will not let the matter go unnoticed
or uncorrected."
Soon after receipt of the letter,
Spearman informed former Senate
Chair Raga Elim that he was dropping
his name from consideration. At the
urging of Blumenthal, Spearman
later placed his name back on the
ballot — but only after the first meet

ing of the Senate-elect and consid
eration of the senate chair candi
dates had started.
