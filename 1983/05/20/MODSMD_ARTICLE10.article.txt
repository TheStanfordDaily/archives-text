# Electronic mail system aids inter library loans
## 
### DAN NEWELL 
As big as our libraries may
be, they do not have all the
books one could ever want.
For this reason, Stanford
has joined the Research Li
braries Group (RIG), a con
sortium of universities
which utilizes an electronic
interlibrary loan system.
The system was intro
duced in November, 1980
and was improved last Sep
tember, and its proponents
say that it has greatly im
proved the time needed to
get a book.

Prior to the existence of the RLG, interli
brary loan requests made to Eastern uni
versities such as Yale„ Cornell Columbia
or Princeton took an average of four to
five weeks to be processed.

Prior to the existence of
RLG, interlibrary loan re
quests made to eastern uni
versities such as Yale, Cor
nell, Columbia or Princeton
took an average of four to
five weeks to be processed.
Today, using the new sys
tem, interlibrary loan re
quests made inside the
group are filled in an aver
age of 10 to 14 days.
In order to improve ser
vice and increase the
number of available docu
ments, each member library
adds records of any new ma
terials to the RLIN database.
When a library places an
interlibrary loan request,
this database is searched to
locate libraries that own the
requested materials. More
than 7Vi million records are
now being stored.
Once a search has been
completed, a message is
sent through the RLIN elec
tronic message system to
one of the libraries that was
recorded as owning the ma
terial. According to
Canelas, each request costs
about 65 cents. That library
then searches its collections

Because of a unique relationship between
Stanford University and UC-Berkeley, re
quests made between the two universities
regularly are filled within a day or two.

and tries to respond within
three days as to whether or
not it is able to fill the re
quest. Since last Septem
ber, response times from
other universities for re
quests originating here
have taken an average of 4.3
days to be filled.
Materials are usually
shipped through UPS sur
face delivery, but if speedier

delivery is needed, the bor
rowing university may re
quest that the material be
shipped by UPS Air Service.
The result has been a
dramatic decrease in the
amount of time it takes to
receive materials through
the interlibrary loan system.
In one exceptionally
speedy case, the time from
initial request for a disserta
tion from the University of
Minnesota to delivery at
Stanford was less than three
days, according to Canelas.
Because of a unique rela

tionship between Stanford
University and UC -
Berkeley, requests made
between the two univer
sities regularly are filled
within a day or two. Re
quests are made through
the electronic mail system
as is normally the case, but
the library materials are de
livered twice daily on the
Gutenberg Express shuttle
bus instead of UPS. This

before/

greatly reduces delivery
times.
Bernard Denham, a libra
rian for Green Library and
head of Interlibrary Ser
vices, said two things ac
count for the greatly im
proved response: elec
tronic mail gives speedier
delivery and a commitment
by member libraries gives
RLG members priority.
"Another by-product of

this cooperation is that they
(other RLG member librar
ies), will lend things they
wouldn't have lent before,"
said Denham.
Materials not normally
available through the inter
library loan program, such
as old or fragile texts, are
often times photocopied or
copied onto microfilm, said
Canelas. The copies are

then sent through the inter
library system rather than
the originals. This not only
allows sharing of materials
that would not normally be
considered, but it protects
the originals and saves
paperwork associated with
billing and other financial
charges.
Requests made through
the RLG system are consid
erably faster than those
using more traditional
methods. Unfortunately, 68
percent of the requests
made through the interli
brary loan system are not
able to be filled from within
the RLG electronic system
and librarians must revert to
older manual and paper op
erations.
"We try to stay within the
network," Denham said.
"Outside the network,
you're back to the old horse
and buggy."
Denham advised re
searchers who have
exhausted Stanford's re
sources to try using the
interlibrary system for
further material. "Don't
give up. Give interlibrary
system a chance and see if
we can get it from one of our
other libraries."
All Stanford faculty and
students are able to utilize
the system.

"One thing a lot of people
think is that we don't serve
undergraduates. We do,"
said Denham. Under
graduates are faced with
time restraints that tend to
restrict the usefulness of the
service, he said. Classes for
undergraduates end
quickly, and while the inter
library loan system is much
faster than before, it still
takes time.
Denham said graduate
students are the biggest
group of users.
Charles Milford, a libra
rian at the Food Research
Institute, said he found RLG
performance "excellent."
"It's a commendable ser
vice if you keep in mind
Stanford University covers
the cost," Milford said.
The Lane Medical Library,
Crown Law Library, the
Hoover Institution, the
Music Library and Green Li
brary are currently the only
university library members
of RLG. Other university
branch libraries may use the
RLG services but they are
not presently represented
inside the RLIN database.

In one exceptionally

greatly reduces delivery
times.
Bernard Denham, a libra
rian for Green Library and
head of Interlibrary Ser
vices, said two things ac
count for the greatly im
proved response: elec
tronic mail gives speedier
delivery and a commitment
by member libraries gives
RLG members priority.
"Another by-product of

this cooperation is that they
(other RLG member librar

said Denham.
Materials not normally
available through the inter
library loan program, such
as old or fragile texts, are
often times photocopied or
copied onto microfilm, said
Canelas. The copies are

then sent through the inter
library system rather than
the originals. This not only
allows sharing of materials
that would not normally be
considered, but it protects
the originals and saves
paperwork associated with
billing and other financial
charges.
Requests made through
the RLG system are consid
erably faster than those
using more traditional
methods. Unfortunately, 68
percent of the requests
made through the interli
brary loan system are not
able to be filled from within
the RLG electronic system
and librarians must revert to
older manual and paper op
erations.
"We try to stay within the
network," Denham said.
"Outside the network,
you're back to the old horse
and buggy."
Denham advised re
searchers who have
exhausted Stanford's re
sources to try using the
interlibrary system for
further material. "Don't
give up. Give interlibrary
system a chance and see if
we can get it from one of our
other libraries."
All Stanford faculty and
students are able to utilize
the system.

"One thing a lot of people
think is that we don't serve
undergraduates. We do,"
said Denham. Under
graduates are faced with
time restraints that tend to
restrict the usefulness of the
service, he said. Classes for
undergraduates end
quickly, and while the inter
library loan system is much
faster than before, it still
takes time.
Denham said graduate
students are the biggest
group of users.
Charles Milford, a libra
rian at the Food Research
Institute, said he found RLG
performance "excellent."
"It's a commendable ser
vice if you keep in mind
Stanford University covers
the cost," Milford said.
The Lane Medical Library,
Crown Law Library, the
Hoover Institution, the
Music Library and Green Li
brary are currently the only
university library members
of RLG. Other university
branch libraries may use the
RLG services but they are
not presently represented
inside the RLIN database.
As big as our libraries may
be, they do not have all the
books one could ever want.
For this reason, Stanford
has joined the Research Li
braries Group (RIG), a con
sortium of universities
which utilizes an electronic
interlibrary loan system.
The system was intro
duced in November, 1980
and was improved last Sep
tember, and its proponents
say that it has greatly im
proved the time needed to
get a book.

Prior to the existence of the RLG, interli
brary loan requests made to Eastern uni
versities such as Yale„ Cornell Columbia
or Princeton took an average of four to
five weeks to be processed.

In order to improve ser

When a library places an

this database is searched to
locate libraries that own the
requested materials. More
than 7Vi million records are
now being stored.
Once a search has been
completed, a message is
sent through the RLIN elec

one of the libraries that was
recorded as owning the ma

Canelas, each request costs
about 65 cents. That library
