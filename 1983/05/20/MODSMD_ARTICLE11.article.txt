What do the three- or four-letter
codes on the right side of Stanford ID
cards stand forP There are many dif
ferent ones; could you please explain
each one.
— Steve Trousdale
Okay, if you're sure you want to
know:
There are two sets of codes on the
right side of your ID. Of these, the let
ters on the left classify you: "U-GRAD,"
"GRAD" and "E/A" (which indicates
TGR status) are common here.
The letters on the right deal with the
distribution of PTRs. If you went
through registration in Maples on Reg
Day, your ID should say "GEN" or
"BKUP." "GEN" means there was noth
ing special about your PTR — it was part
of the "general" mass of PTRs. "BKUP"
stands for backup and means there was
a problem with your registration — i.e.,
a hold — and the registrar printed two
PTRs for you. The first said "HOLD,"
and the second, which you were given
after you cleared the hold, said
"BKUP."
During pre-reg, however, PTRs are
distributed according to major and the
right-hand code on normal PTRs will
either be your major code or "UOO"
(undeclared). Therefore, if you pre-reg,
your ID should never say "GEN," but it
can read "BKUP" if you had a hold dur
ing pre-reg.
How come the parking authorities ig
nore the 50 or so autos parked illegally
every day on the vacant plot of land at
the corner of Panama and Via Crespi,
opposite the Terman Centerf What

gripes me most is that many of these
cars have no parking stickers what
soever, and moreover are left all day
smack on the pathway, so that those of
us who have parked our cars legally
have to step into the puddles and muck
to get by.
Keep up your column which is a vent
for the collective community.
— Nancy Williams
It's positively uncanny — every time I
call about a complaint of this type, be it
doors, stoplights, or parking, it turns
out something is about to be done.
Either someone really cares, or there's a
conspiracy afoot to sap the righteous
anger of the collective community.
The politics of this particular piece of
ground are murky, but fascinating. Ac
cording to Leonard Screws, supervisor
of parking enforcement (a real Herb
Caen name-phreak there), the parking
problem arose when the University
widened the sidewalk along Panama
Street to improve handicapped access.
This made the sidewalk, with its wheel
chair ramp at the curb, a perfect auto
mobile access as well. The patch of
ground became what Screws calls a
"pirate lot" — a place where cars can
park close and easy, and continue to do
so in spite of citations. Screws re
quested that bollards be placed on the
sidewalk to keep out cars, but was told
there was a problem with funding. He
also asked for "No Parking" signs to be
put up — there are some on the street,
but none in the lot itself. Here we get to
the heart of your question: he then re
fused to cite cars until the University did

something about closing off the area.
He has recently decided to again cite
cars that park on the sidewalk — follow
ing, among other things, a complaint
from a blind student who couldn't
make it down the walk without hitting a
car.
I then called Operations and Main
tenance, the department to which
Screws said he had submitted work or
ders requesting bollards. Asst. Director
Bruce Wiggins said O & M cannot dic
tate where bollards will go — other de
partments and committees do that. He
also said the University has decided to
turn the ground in question into —
drum roll, please — a parking lot.
My next stop was Campus Planner
Judy Chan. She said a decision "has es
sentially been made" to turn the
ground into a parking lot. In her telling,
bollards or other restrictions were not
installed because the University did not
want to invest before they knew what
the spot would be used for. It is still not
known whether the lot will be per
manent or not, how it will be changed
physically — gravel, asphalt — and what
sort of lot it will be — permit, gated,
time. Now that a decision has been
made, though, things will start happen
ing within a couple of months, accord
ing to Chan.
In the meantime, you can hope along
with Leonard Screws that the $22 fine
for obstructing a sidewalk will keep the
pirate cars (most of which, incidentally,
bear C and A permits) off of the side
walk. In his words, "parking is a funny
situation here."

tate where bollards will go — other de
partments and committees do that. He
also said the University has decided to
turn the ground in question into —
drum roll, please — a parking lot.
My next stop was Campus Planner
Judy Chan. She said a decision "has es
sentially been made" to turn the
ground into a parking lot. In her telling,
bollards or other restrictions were not
installed because the University did not
want to invest before they knew what
the spot would be used for. It is still not
known whether the lot will be per
manent or not, how it will be changed
physically — gravel, asphalt — and what
sort of lot it will be — permit, gated,
time. Now that a decision has been
made, though, things will start happen
ing within a couple of months, accord

In the meantime, you can hope along
with Leonard Screws that the $22 fine
for obstructing a sidewalk will keep the
pirate cars (most of which, incidentally,
bear C and A permits) off of the side
walk. In his words, "parking is a funny
situation here."

What do the three- or four-letter
codes on the right side of Stanford ID
cards stand forP There are many dif
ferent ones; could you please explain
each one.
— Steve Trousdale
Okay, if you're sure you want to
know:
There are two sets of codes on the
right side of your ID. Of these, the let
ters on the left classify you: "U-GRAD,"
"GRAD" and "E/A" (which indicates
TGR status) are common here.
The letters on the right deal with the
distribution of PTRs. If you went
through registration in Maples on Reg
Day, your ID should say "GEN" or
"BKUP." "GEN" means there was noth
ing special about your PTR — it was part
of the "general" mass of PTRs. "BKUP"
stands for backup and means there was
a problem with your registration — i.e.,
a hold — and the registrar printed two
PTRs for you. The first said "HOLD,"
and the second, which you were given
after you cleared the hold, said
"BKUP."
During pre-reg, however, PTRs are
distributed according to major and the
right-hand code on normal PTRs will
either be your major code or "UOO"
(undeclared). Therefore, if you pre-reg,
your ID should never say "GEN," but it
can read "BKUP" if you had a hold dur
ing pre-reg.
How come the parking authorities ig
nore the 50 or so autos parked illegally
every day on the vacant plot of land at
the corner of Panama and Via Crespi,
opposite the Terman Centerf What

gripes me most is that many of these
cars have no parking stickers what
soever, and moreover are left all day
smack on the pathway, so that those of
us who have parked our cars legally
have to step into the puddles and muck
to get by.
Keep up your column which is a vent
for the collective community.
— Nancy Williams
It's positively uncanny — every time I
call about a complaint of this type, be it
doors, stoplights, or parking, it turns
out something is about to be done.
Either someone really cares, or there's a
conspiracy afoot to sap the righteous
anger of the collective community.
The politics of this particular piece of
ground are murky, but fascinating. Ac
cording to Leonard Screws, supervisor
of parking enforcement (a real Herb
Caen name-phreak there), the parking
problem arose when the University
widened the sidewalk along Panama
Street to improve handicapped access.
This made the sidewalk, with its wheel
chair ramp at the curb, a perfect auto
mobile access as well. The patch of
ground became what Screws calls a
"pirate lot" — a place where cars can
park close and easy, and continue to do
so in spite of citations. Screws re
quested that bollards be placed on the
sidewalk to keep out cars, but was told
there was a problem with funding. He
also asked for "No Parking" signs to be
put up — there are some on the street,
but none in the lot itself. Here we get to
the heart of your question: he then re
fused to cite cars until the University did

something about closing off the area.
He has recently decided to again cite
cars that park on the sidewalk — follow
ing, among other things, a complaint
from a blind student who couldn't
make it down the walk without hitting a
car.
I then called Operations and Main
tenance, the department to which
Screws said he had submitted work or
ders requesting bollards. Asst. Director
Bruce Wiggins said O & M cannot dic
tate where bollards will go — other de
partments and committees do that. He
also said the University has decided to
turn the ground in question into —
drum roll, please — a parking lot.
