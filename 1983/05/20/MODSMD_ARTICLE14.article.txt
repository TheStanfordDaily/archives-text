The fact that nearly 80 percent of the faculty of
the School of Humanities and Sciences is te
nured is indeed a mixed blessing. While it
seems an advantage for the faculty to be domi
nated by experienced, knowledgeable and pub
lished scholars, this unusually high tenure rate
leaves little room for the scholars of the future.
If the trend continues, as Norm Wessells, dean
of Humanities and Sciences predicted it would
last week in a report to the faculty senate, te
nure track spots will grow increasingly less
common and the faculty will be almost entirely
composed of tenured professors in the coming
years.
The 80 percent mark, which compares with an
average of 70 percent for 13 major private uni
versities, is for all practical purposes the natural
result of a University tendency to offer tenure to
an extremely high percentage of its tenure track
faculty. Since the early 19605, about 38 percent
of Stanford tenure track faculty in the School of
Humanities and Sciences have eventually been
tenured as compared with about 10 percent for
many Ivy League schools.
In the short run, this disparity in tenure rates
offers a significant advantage to those charged
with the recruiting of bright new faculty
members. Not only is the weather nicer in
California, the chances of "making the team"
are far better at Stanford than at most compara
ble universities.
It doesn't take an analytical genius, however,
to spe that there is no free lunch and that high

rates now will only necessitate lower rates later.
We would hate to see the University's relative
advantage in recruiting new faculty eliminated,
but it must be moderated if the scenario fore
seen by Wessells is to be avoided. Simply put,
the standards for tenure in the School of
Humanities and Sciences will have to be made
even more stringent.
Unfortunately, this conclusion leaves us in a
difficult position when it comes time to con
sider its effects on efforts to increase the
number of women and minorities among the
body of white male tenured professors. Affirma
tive action is currently only considered in the
recruiting of tenure track faculty, not in the te
nure decision.
Perhaps some thought should be given to the
implementation of affirmative action in the te
nure review process itself. This may be the only
way to significantly diversify the faculty while
making tenure standards even more stringent.
In any event, the effort to combat the high te
nure rate should not be used to excuse the
extremely low number of women and
minorities on the faculty.
The tenure ra'te problem has the potential to
seriously affect the composition of the faculty
and the quality of a Stanford education. The
University will best serve the interests of stu
dents and its educational mission if it considers
possible solutions to the problem before it gets
out of hand.
