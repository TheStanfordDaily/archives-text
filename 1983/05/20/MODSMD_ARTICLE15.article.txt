# How to cheat in Comp Sci
## 
### 
Stanford's Computer Science De
partment is the run-away leader in
the production of Honor Code vio
lators. While this article may seem to
welcome this fact and intend to pad
the department's lead, in fact it is an
attempt to force an introduction of
reforms. No one is excusing the
choices of certain students, but the
structure of. the Computer Science
DepaT\menV s curncu\um ( \Vie access
to copying and limited access to ter
minals are an unnecessary induce
ment to cheat. Computer classes are
among the hardest, especially when
measured in time per unit. Students
are often expected to need more
time at the terminals than they are
allocated. On top of this, it is very
easy to cheat, and so, cheating is next
to popular.
Occasionally, but far more fre
quently than in other departments,
students are suspended for a quarter
with their first "offense" Whether
by copying files, getting help from
friends or picking up programs
abandoned in the printing room,
hundreds of students have had to
pack their bags for a while. But the
Computer Science Department is
also at fault if it is so easy to cheat —
and by many students' accounts, it is
sometimes necessary for their survi
val in that class to see someone else's
program.
The Honor Code states that
teachers are not to tempt or in any
way make "violations" feasible.
Here, the Computer Science De
partment gets its hands slapped. The
following information provides more
people with the knowledge few
have, and perhaps abuse (it's only
fair). Hopefully the system that has
seduced some good kids into an et
ernal hell will make a few changes.
Find out the names of the students
in your class section by typing (at
your terminal) FINGER/CLASS then
the class name and section. For
example, FINGER/CLASS CSIO6-5 will
give you a list of all the people in
section five of Comp Sci 106. The list

will be headed by classmates work
ing on LOTS at the same time you're
typing. Do you recognize the names
of students who know what they're
talking about in section?
When you choose a name, see
what programs they have written that
you can copy. Type vd-jtheir account
name}. vd{T.THIEF} will get you a
listing of all that person's programs
as well as their protection codes. If
you see the program you want to
check (or steal — whatever you want
to call it), then you will have to see if
their protection code is available for
any user. A protection code has six
digits. Vou are only concerned with
last two. If the last two numbers are
52 or greater (as in 775252) you are
able to copy their programs.
To get their program into your file,
type COPY{their account
name}their program name (for
example CO PY {T .T HIE F} R O B
ERY.PGO). If the protection code is
right you have possibly obtained a
finished program, which you can and
must alter in any number of superfi
cial ways to make it yours, or just use
it as a reference guide when you are
stuck.
If you can't copy a file, search the
printer room. Often students leave
perfect or nearly completed print
outs lying around that room.
If the printer room is devoid of
what you are looking for temporarily,
there is a more dramatic but failproof
way of finding what you are looking
for. This is the tape drive. Every few
days the LOTS staff copies all re
cently written or altered programs
onto a magnetic tape, much like a
reel-to-reel tape. The purpose of this
is to keep copies of programs avail
able in case a user erases his or her
program(s) accidently. However,
these programs have no protection
codes and can be accessed by any
body, anytime. Even confidential
mail files can be stolen this way.
What the student must do to copy

a program from a tape-drive is this:
go into the master control room (this
is the room adjoining the room
where LOTS-B is located. It's never
locked); logon to the terminal in that
room (either LOTS-A or LOTS-B);
and then find the tape which con
tains the program you want to copy.
The tapes are arranged by date and
by account name, so make sure you
Have the "proper" tape. a con
sultant for help if necessary.
The instructions for using the tape
drives are above the LOTS-A terminal
in the machine room. The instruc
tions are not hard. Back up to what
ever program you wish, into your ac
count following those directions.
It is illegal to use even small proce
dures from friends' programs. A
minority of students do get through
computer science classes (especially
106 and 105) without significant help
from people other than TAs, consul
tants or teachers. It seems strange
that a discipline, computer pro
gramming in this case, which is rarely
solitary work at professional levels,
shouldn't encourage informal
cross-referencing. I know, they have
to learn the skill at some point. On
the other hand, like a 55 mph speed
limit, we are being deluged with
honor code violators who don't ac
tually realize their offence. They be
come numb to the law! Work in
groups by having each person con
tribute small parts in the program,
after having gotten together on the
solution's format. We might have
fewer convicted criminals and more
people who could hold a conversa
tion together.
just to save one or two people the
time of writing a reply to all this, I d
like to make my sarcastic position
clearer. It should be harder to cheat
in Comp Sci classes. Students need
more time allotted to their accounts.
There should bea more realistic ratio
of units for time spent in these clas
ses.

seduced some good kids into an et
ernal hell will make a few changes.
Find out the names of the students
in your class section by typing (at
your terminal) FINGER/CLASS then
the class name and section. For
example, FINGER/CLASS CSIO6-5 will
give you a list of all the people in
section five of Comp Sci 106. The list

will be headed by classmates work
ing on LOTS at the same time you're
typing. Do you recognize the names
of students who know what they're
talking about in section?
When you choose a name, see
what programs they have written that
you can copy. Type vd-jtheir account
name}. vd{T.THIEF} will get you a
listing of all that person's programs
as well as their protection codes. If
you see the program you want to
check (or steal — whatever you want
to call it), then you will have to see if
their protection code is available for
any user. A protection code has six
digits. Vou are only concerned with
last two. If the last two numbers are
52 or greater (as in 775252) you are
able to copy their programs.
To get their program into your file,
type COPY{their account
name}their program name (for
example CO PY {T .T HIE F} R O B
ERY.PGO). If the protection code is
right you have possibly obtained a
finished program, which you can and
must alter in any number of superfi
cial ways to make it yours, or just use
it as a reference guide when you are
stuck.
If you can't copy a file, search the
printer room. Often students leave
perfect or nearly completed print
outs lying around that room.
If the printer room is devoid of
what you are looking for temporarily,
there is a more dramatic but failproof
way of finding what you are looking
for. This is the tape drive. Every few
days the LOTS staff copies all re
cently written or altered programs
onto a magnetic tape, much like a
reel-to-reel tape. The purpose of this
is to keep copies of programs avail
able in case a user erases his or her
program(s) accidently. However,
these programs have no protection
codes and can be accessed by any
body, anytime. Even confidential
mail files can be stolen this way.
What the student must do to copy

a program from a tape-drive is this:
go into the master control room (this
is the room adjoining the room
where LOTS-B is located. It's never
locked); logon to the terminal in that
room (either LOTS-A or LOTS-B);
and then find the tape which con
tains the program you want to copy.
The tapes are arranged by date and
by account name, so make sure you
Have the "proper" tape. a con
sultant for help if necessary.
The instructions for using the tape
drives are above the LOTS-A terminal
in the machine room. The instruc
tions are not hard. Back up to what
ever program you wish, into your ac
count following those directions.
It is illegal to use even small proce
dures from friends' programs. A
minority of students do get through
computer science classes (especially
106 and 105) without significant help
from people other than TAs, consul
tants or teachers. It seems strange
that a discipline, computer pro
gramming in this case, which is rarely
solitary work at professional levels,
shouldn't encourage informal
cross-referencing. I know, they have
to learn the skill at some point. On
the other hand, like a 55 mph speed
limit, we are being deluged with
honor code violators who don't ac
tually realize their offence. They be
come numb to the law! Work in
groups by having each person con
tribute small parts in the program,
after having gotten together on the
solution's format. We might have
fewer convicted criminals and more
people who could hold a conversa
tion together.
just to save one or two people the
time of writing a reply to all this, I d
like to make my sarcastic position
clearer. It should be harder to cheat
in Comp Sci classes. Students need
more time allotted to their accounts.
There should bea more realistic ratio
of units for time spent in these clas
ses.

Stanford's Computer Science De

among the hardest, especially when
measured in time per unit. Students
are often expected to need more

easy to cheat, and so, cheating is next
