## Mem Chu is place to be married 
### 
The clergy of Memorial Church
are, indeed, "dedicated to providing
an open and welcome sanctuary for
the worship of God," and we are very
sorry that Scott Lynch has concluded
otherwise ("Where nol to get mar
ried," Daily, March 12). It is the case
that we have policies intended to
"control" the quality of what takes
place in the church, and experience
has shown that they are necessary.
We do, however, try to implement
our policies reasonably and flexibly,
and our side of the story which Lynch
tells is somewhat different from his.
It is a policy of the National Guild
of Organists that the resident or
ganist is entitled to play for all wed
dings in the church where he/she re
sides, and that guests can only be
invited to play with the organist's
permission. We do grant such per
mission to duly qualified organists.
Lynch was told to ask his aunt to send
us some certification that she was,
indeed, a professional organist.
We heard nothing from
Lynch or his aunt for several months,
until the attack on us in the Daily.
I deeply regret whatever it was that

caused Scott Lynch's unhappiness.
The approximately three weddings a
week, fifty-two weeks a year, that we
celebrate show that Memorial
Church is, for many people, a good
place to be married. Our fees are not
twice as much as comparable
churches (in fact they are signifi
cantly less than our chief "rival" and
include significantly more service for
the fee, namely three sessions with a
certified professional counselor).
The chief reason why fewer under
graduates than alumni are married
here is that most people are marrying
in their middle or late 20s
It is a pity that Lynch's aunt did not
see fit to contact us. Had she done
so, it is quite probable that he and his
fiancee and his aunt would be enjoy
ing the beauty and inspiration of a
Memorial Church wedding.

Major decisions
The editorial in "Major decisions,"

(Daily, May 17) discussed some ot the
consequences faced by Stanford
students resulting from the choice of
a major. I agree with your writer that
it is a mistake to choose a major be
cause of the notion that it is "market
able and uninteresting" rather than
"impractical and interesting." How
ever, you may be creating a false split
here.
It is possible to choose a major at
Stanford that is both practical and in
teresting, and this is true both in En
gineering and Humanities and Sci
ences. Liberal arts majors are practi
cal; it is simply the students' task to
be able to describe to an employer in
specific, tangible terms the skills and
attributes acquired through the
study of anthropology, French,
music, etc. The Career Planning and
Placement Center specializes in help
ing students clearly understand and
express to employers, both in speak
ing and in writing, the skills they pos
sess.
