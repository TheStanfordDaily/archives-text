## Democratizing capitalism 
### 
In this column, I would like to expand on Shirish
Date's suggestion (Daily, May 16) for "democratizing
capitalism." His proposal, to democratize capitalism by
giving the control of corporations to those who work for
them (i.e., give all their stock to their employees), while
retaining the market allocation system of capitalism
(which works fairly well), is a good one, and one which
many forward-looking analysts have studied.
The advantages of this system are several.
First, it is much more egalitarian than the current sys
tem because he who works has a say in things, while he
who doesn't work, has no say. This is surely better than
the unjustifiable control of a huge corporation by sev
eral wealthy stockholders.
Second, it would put a "human face" on our corporate
system — for who has never heard a complaint about
"callous" or "uncaring" bosses? Under democratized
capitalism, the workers in a firm could remove a callous
boss.
Third, such a corporation would probably be better
able to strike a balance between technological advances
and environmental concerns, for those in control of the
firm (the workers) would also be those most affected
ecologically (the citizens of the community). In short,
such a system would retain a free market, the decentral
ized system of private industry initiative and competi
tion so valued hy-"conservative's," while also respond
ing to the social arid environmental needs of society
valued by "liberals" — and all without government regu
lation!
In theory, that is. Of course, this system would not be
a perfect one, even if it would be a big improvement. For
instance, there's nothing that says that workers will want
to actively participate in running a firm. In fact, experi
ence in Yugoslavia's system of "self-management" (simi
lar in many ways to what I've outlined) shows the same
sort of apathy we have in this country about politics.
But then, just because there's political apathy in this
country doesn't mean free elections should be
abolished. Similarly, democratized capitalism shouldn't
be tossed out because we expect worker apathy. On the
contrary, we can look to the strengths of our political
system for a model for democratizing capitalism, letting
those who care participate, while those who don't care
watch TV. We'd still be better off than we are now,
where only the wealthy or the very lucky participate.
There would also be some potential economic prob
lems with this system, however. Such a labor-run corpo
ration would try to maximize income per person, not
maximize total revenue. Thus, production would take
place where marginal returns are at a maximum, which is
a lower level of production than what pure capitalism
provides (per firm). Also, a successful democratized
corporation might be tempted not to hire more workers,
even if needed, because this would mean the pie has to

be cut into more pieces. Thus there is, potentially, an
unemployment problem, and an underproduction
problem.
Vet, if the society could somehow achieve full or
near-full employment (if the government forms new
corporations, say), the society would be better off than
under pure capitalism — because of this maximum
income-per-worker criterion. Nevertheless, the case of
Yugoslavia again indicates there are some dangers in this
regard (although fewer than traditional economic
analysis would predict).
You may have noticed another potential problem in
passing: a democratized firm is a risk-averse firm. Logi
cally, a rich capitalist is more likely to risk some of his
money on a new venture than a worker would risk his
job and his livelihood on the same venture. This is prob
ably the most real difficulty democratized capitalism
must face.
Also, given a system with risk-averse firms and with
little excess capital available for speculation (though
everybody could save something, of course), how are
new businesses formed? Small firms would be no prob
lem, of course, but an industry requiring large initial
investments (a new shale-oil industry, say), would never
get off the ground without governmental help. This is
unfortunate but unavoidable (but then, the current
"capitalist" shale-oil industry isn't going anywhere
without government help either). This also means that
democratized capitalism is unsuited for developing
countries, for the poor rural populations could never
raise the capital necessary for expansion, technological
improvements or firm creation.
Nor would these Third World peasants have the edu
cation necessary to help run a corporation. Again,
Yugoslavia confirms this, as "self-management" is suc
cessful in the industrialized North, but inadequate with
out major government assistance in the underdevel
oped regions in the South such as the Kosovo. Thus, at
least at first, democratized capitalism must be limited to
the industrialized West.
Yet, for the West, this system would be both econom
ically beneficial, more humanitarian and more egalita
rian than the present system. What remains is only to
find a way to implement it. Giving employees stock
options, putting labor leaders on corporate boards of
directors (like Douglas Fraser of the United Auto Work
ers was) or breaking decision-making into smaller "work
teams" are all good starts. These democratizing meas
ures need to be expanded, and the initiative for this can
only come from the workers themselves. One thing is
certain: it would be hypocritical to impose democratiza
tion from above.
