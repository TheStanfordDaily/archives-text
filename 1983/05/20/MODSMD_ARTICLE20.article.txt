# Get away: retreat to the redwoods
## 
### JIM BREYER JOHN SAGE 
Although many Stanford
students are aware of the
dramatic natural beauty of
the Mendocino coastline,
few students take the time
to explore this area which
has been the scene of many
mo\ies and television pro
ductions.
Mendocino is about a
six-hour drive from Palo
Alto if the Highway 1 coast
route is used, and a four
hour drive by way of High
way 101 to Cloverdale, and
Route 128 to the coast. If
time is not a problem, we
strongly suggest the coastal
route since it offers spec
tacular ocean vistas. .
The New England-style
village of Mendocino offers
a number of attractions to
visitors. Its architecture is
the result of a group of
pioneer families from
Maine who settled there,
and native New Englanders
will be pleased to see white
picket fences, and colonial
inns and taverns. Many of
the buildings, originally
constructed in the 1800s,
are finely preserved.
Mendocino also has a
surprisingly rich cultural life
for such a small town. The
Mendocino Art Center,
founded in 1959, offers pro
grams in pottery, painting,
weaving and other arts. In
addition, theatrical produc
tions, art galleries and
poetry readings are avail
able for tourists.
North of Mendocino, at
Russian Gulch State Park,
visitors can hike on the
miles of trails, or along the
cliffs down to secluded
beaches.
Many small inns are
situated in Mendocino or
along the highway within
easy driving distance of the
town. The Flk Cove Inn, lo
cated 15 miles south of
Mendocino in the town of
Elk, offers a truly unique ex
perience to travelers along
the coast Innkeepers
Hildrun-Uta and Michael
Roynoff are totally commit
ted to creating a personal
and warm atmosphere. The
facilities are quite varied. A
two-bedroom cabin, rented
as a single unit, offers a
dramatic view of the ocean
and the rocky coast. The
main guest house, which
has facilities to accommo
date 14 to 16 people, offers a
redwood panel and beam
living room with a large
fireplace. The bedrooms
have spectacular ocean
views and are attractively
furnished with flowers,
hand embroidered linens
and the work of local pho
tographers. A path leading
down from the guest house
to a secluded beach as well
as local hiking and biking

trails are available for
guests.
On weekends, French or
German specialties are
served for dinner in the
main house. Our dinner in
cluded a rich plum soup
(the plums were picked
from trees just behind the
house), garden salad, ten
der beef in a thick
homemade sauce, fresh as
paragus, German potatoes
and apricot cheese cake.
Each offering was excellent,
and an extensive array of
wines is also available.
Complete breakfasts featur
ing German Egg Cakes are
served seven days a week.
Weekend lodging, which
includes dinner and break
fast ranges from $98 to $126
per night for two. Mid-wegk

rates (Monday-Thursday)
range from $46 to $68 per
night for two. We have
rarely encountered inn
keepers who care so much
about their guests and are
so committed to offering
their guests a personal and
charming atmosphere. The
Elk Cove Inn receives our
highest recommendation
for travelers looking for
such an atmosphere.
Another inn visited in the
area was the Hill House in
Mendocino. Atop the high
est knoll in town, the Hill
House offers 21 comforta
ble and spacious rooms, all
with color TV, private
phones and separate baths.
The inn was builtin 1977and
is owned by Monty and Bar
bara Reed, who also main

tain interests in Palo Alto.
For all its modern conveni
ences, the Hill House also
sports some very traditional
touches. Each room is fur
nished with antiques and art
reproductions, including
work by local artist Emily
Lou Packard. A number of
the rooms have patios and
broad ocean views, and the
inn is a short walk from
shopping and dining.
The service was excellent
and our host was Julie Beck,
a Stanford graduate, who
gave helpful tips on local
dining, recreation, shop
ping and history. A com
plete dinner menu guide for
the Mendocino area is also
available. A continental
breakfast of rolls, |uice and
coffee is included in the
room price. Most of the
other guests were vacation
ing, but the movie company
shooting Racing with the
Moon including Richard
Benjamin and Elizabeth
McGovern, were also stay
ing at the hotel.
In short, the Hill House is
an excellent choice for
those that desire traditional
amenities without giving up
modern conveniences. It
may not have all of the
charm of some other local
inns, but it is ideally situated
and quite comfortable.
Rooms go for $59 to $95 per
night, double occupancy,
and a fireplace suite is avail
able. Summer and weekend
stays should be made well in
advance.
The Whitegate Inn, lo
cated in the town of Men
docino, has retained the
charm of a Victorian home.
A white picket fence sur
rounds the house, and
well-kept flower beds line
the path to the front door.
The elegant rooms are fur
nished with antiques and
three of the six rooms have
Franklin fireplaces. Inn
keepers Wally and Robbie
Clegg offer guests a com
plete dinner guide for the

Mendocino area, and are
more than willing to discuss
their personal favorite res
taurants and dishes. Room
prices which include break
fast range from $49 to $70
per room, single or double
occupancy.
Fort Bragg, which lies 10
miles north of Mendocino,
offers many exciting sights
and activities for the visitor.
Especially noteworthy are
the Skunk train and Noyo
Harbor. The Skunk train
winds its way through the
thick redwood forest be
tween Fort Bragg and Wil
lits, stopping briefly for re
freshments. The round trip
lasts from the morning to
the late afternoon, although
a shorter trip is available
during the summer months.
Presently the old-fashioned
train runs on diesel power,
but a group of community
leaders are attempting to
bring back a steam locomo
tive. Just south of Fort
Bragg, the fishing village of
Noyo Harbor is home port
for hundreds of weather
beaten boats moored in
wooden docks that seem
permanently unsturdy. Vis
itors can also enjoy the fresh
fish, shady walkways and
shipbuilding yards.
The Country Inn, located
in Fort Bragg, provides an
elegant and comfortable
home base for exploringthe
area. At night complimen
tary wine is served in a sit
ting room and breakfast
consists of delicious
home-baked breads, fresh
fruit, coffee and orange
juice. The inn was reno
vated two years ago by Don
and Helen Miller, the inn's
friendly, helpful innkeep
ers. Don Miller handled the
renovation and contributed
a number of excellent pho
tographs, wood carvings
and paintings which add to
the warmth of the inn.
Rooms cost $45 to $50 per
night, single or double oc
cupancy.
