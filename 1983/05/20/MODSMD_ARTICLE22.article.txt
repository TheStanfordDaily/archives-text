# The 						off-campus want-ad blues
## 
### LISA MURPHY 
It was Thursday, April 21,
when Gary Miner and Dennis
Duckworth, both unguaran
teed, reached into the chest
and plucked out their fateful
number—4262. Unguaranteed
and 4262 spell only one thing:
O-F-F C-A-M-P-U-S.
"We tried to look at the
bright side," said Miner. "We
tried to think of all the things
we'd learn to do like cooking
and cleaning."
They hope to find a house or
apartment that is cheap, close
by and has a kitchen.
Miner and Duckworth are
only two out of about 400 un
dergraduates who will have to
endure the rigors of house
hunting because they did not
draw low enough in their un
guaranteed year to receive
on-campus housing.
Deborah Drew, director of
the Housing Center, suggests
that those looking for off
campus housing attend the
Spring Clearinghouse at Tre
sidder Union May 23.
"The Clearinghouse is a
centrally located place," she
said, "where students can
check listings, meet prospec
tive housemates and use the
phones for free."
The Housing Center, located
on the third floor of Old Union,
posts listings for apartments,
homes and rooms for rent in
the area.
Defining living priorities is
crucial, according to Drew.
"You should ask yourself
whether it is more important to
live cheaply, to live near cam
pus, or to have privacy," she
said. There are advantages and
disadvantages to every type of
living situation.
Houses are the most expen
sive but they can be divided up
creatively between house
mates and there is sometimes
the option of pets, according
to Drew. One the other hand,

houses include the added ex
pense of utilities.
"Apartments offer privacy,
cooking facilities, a more social
atmosphere and a laundry
room," she said.
"Laundry is one thing many
fail to consider before renting a
house or apartment," said
Drew. "If all you have is a bike,
then you may be faced with
biking your laundry to a laun
dromat."
Rooms are by far the
cheapest places to live but
there are many things to con
sider before renting one.
"In renting a room, you need
to consider whether there is a
private entrance or kitchen
privileges," said Drew.
"Also you need to find out
how the owners feel about
smoking, utilities and over
night guests," she said.
Students should take pre
cautions before signing a
rental agreement or lease.
"You should go over all dam
ages with the landlord before
moving in and paying a de
posit," Drew said.
The renter should inquire
about subletting in case he or
she is not able to stay through
the specified time of the hous
ing agreement.
"The ASSU Legal Service can
look over your housing agree
ment form and offer sugges
tions," she said.
For those who have not
found housing by Sept. 1, the
Clearinghouse Hotel offers in
expensive rooms for $5 to $10 a
night through Sept. 20.
Like most people Miner and
Duckworth have some misgiv
ings about off-campus life.
They worry about how their
social life will be cut because of
the time lost in transportation
to and from campus. However,
as they correctly assert, "If you
don't have a social life, lack of
time won't be problem."
