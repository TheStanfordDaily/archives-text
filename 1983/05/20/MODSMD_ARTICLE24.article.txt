This recently dedicated memorial to the pioneering work
of photographer Eadweard Muybridge now stands near
the Stanford Stables. On June 1 5,1878 Muybridge set up
a dozen cameras around Gov. Stanford's racetrack to

capture the motion of Stanford's trotter Occident. Muyb
ridge succeeded, and by proving that a horse lifts all feet
off the ground at certain gaits, Stanford won a $25,000
bet.
