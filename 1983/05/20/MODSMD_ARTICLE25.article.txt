Gary Hart
In 1976, Rep. Morris Udall of
Arizona told his delegates, on
the brink of tears, toyield their
support to the "next president
of the United States, limmy
Carter." Udall fought Carter in
almost every state and with few
exceptions, took a strong sec
ond in the democratic
primaries. In that year
everyone was waiting to see if
either Teddy Kennedy or the
aging Happy Warrior, Hubert

Humphrey would declare their
candidacy and seize the nomi
nation. Kennedy backed away
and Humphrey made his play
too late, but the really big dis
appointment for many Demo
crats was the nomination of
Carter.
Although Carter was later to
prove inept at congressional
politics, in '76 he was the mas
ter of presidential politics. He
captured the Democratic party
and eventually the nation
without once addressing any
substantive issues, revealing
nothing but his good inten
tions and alleged honesty. Al
most the antithesis of Carter,
Udall crusaded the country on
a classic progressive reform
platform, taking strong, al
though not particularly radical,
stands on the issues. While
people could think of no ob
jections to Carter, because he
hadn't said anything, they
might have disagreed with
Udall on a couple of issues.
The result: )immy.
Then in 1980 the Grecian
Formula candidate Ronald Re
agan out-limmied Jimmy. He
promised America the impos
sible and looked very good
next to the lackluster Carter.
This time Carter couldn't fight
on the issues, not that he
would want to. He was running
on a record that could not be

interesting to anyone save the
dead, and was trying to limp to
victory on the remaining
foreign policy leg, Camp
David. (The other leg had been
cut off by the Iranian fiasco.)
It didn't really matter, be
cause Ronnie had taken the
campaign into Fantasyland and
there was no prospect of re
turn. The question of the day
was, "Is Ronald Reagan the
conservative messiah with
magical powers?" America de
cided that he was and the re
sult: massive unemployment.
In his latest book, A New
Democracy, Gary Hart seems
to be banking on a hope that
the United States is ready for
an issue-oriented candidate
with realistic proposals to help
smooth the way for an America
that is obviously in transition
from a non-stop rapid growth
economy of the '50s and '60s to
something else. The book is
clearly a calculated risk, for
while it gives his enemies a
written document to study and
shoot down, it may serve to
change the grounds on which
the battle for president is
fought, from Fantasyland to
the issues, and more impor
tantly, to the issues Hart is in
terested in. While it is possible
that shifting the debate to his
issues may be worth the risk of
giving other contenders a

target to shoot at, it st ems just
as likely that Hart will be
sandbagged in a way reminis
cent of the '7f> campaign.
While doing some lip
service to political rhetoric and
style, Hart manages to make
some important social and
public policy corn ments.
When one looks at the red,
white and blue cover of the
book, one expects to read the
same type of drivel that has
won the last two campaigns for
president, but surprisingly
candidate Hart takes a very
different approach. He in
cludes almost no autobiog
raphical information telling
what a great humanitarian per
son he is, and sticks to criticism
of the present and past presi
dential administrations, mak
ing innovative policy sugges
tions as the book progresses.
Hart divides the book into
two parts; "The path of pros
perity" and "National security
today and tomorrowThe first
part deals primarily with
domestic issues with concen
tration on "restoring industrial
vitality," and a "new" strategy
for solving the unemployment
that has grown to mammoth
proportions.
This section is particularly
concise and well-written, em
bracing liberal doctrines while
meeting many standard analyt

ical criteria of political science
and economics. A good exam
ple of this is his encapsulation
of Reaganomics. He writes:
"The Reagan fiscal program
consisted of massive tax ( uts,
and thus reduced revenues,
with simultaneous huge in
creases in military spending,
and reductions in government
support for all other domestic
and human needs-from educa
tion and environmental protec
tion to care for infants and the
elderly. The principal goal all
along was not to reduce defi
cits but to shift priorities mas
sively. The arithmetic of suffer
ing had added up to huge
deficits-far from the balanced
budgets the President prom
ised. The large tax cuts did not
lead to increased private-sector
investment because interest
rates were too high to encour
age borrowing and demand
was stagnant. Interest rates
stayed high because the gov
ernment had to borrow more
money than ever to finance
huge deficits caused by tax cuts
and the frantic military buil
dup. And consumer demand,
stifled by the prohibitive cost
of housing and car loans, for
example, slowed drastically,
leaving warehouse shelves
crowded. Producers were
stuck with unsold goods and

unwilling to manufacture more
or invest for future, increased
productivity."
The second part of the book,
while less concrete than the
first, clearly states Hart's
priorities for national security.
Number one on the list, and
the issue that has thus far got
ten the greatest publicity, is
nuclear disarmament. Hart
takes a stand against a limited
nuclear war, saying that any
use of nuclear weapons will re
sult in unacceptable losses for
both sides. He destroys the
myth that "seeking to control
nuclear weapons amounts ot
being soft on security," and
suggests instead that it is es
sential to U.S. security and that
of the world. Following this is
the reshaping of the military,
particularly the conventional
forces, with an emphasis on
small, fast, portable and dura
ble weapons systems. Finally
Hart brings energy, the issue
everyone thought was dead, to
the forefront. He depicts the
country's energy needs as as
urgent issue essential to any
debate on national security.
The tone of Hart's book on
the whole is one of optimism,
of consolidation and change.
When he talks about "shaping
a better future," it is like he is
giving America a new lease on

life, but this is balanced with
pragmatic suggestions and
practical estimates of potential
progress. He is unquestionably
committed to a pluralist
America, and greater social
equality with hints of eco
nomic equality lurking in the
background of his policy
suggestions. This is not to say
that he is radical or socialist,
but he does say, "the result of
this presicJent's policies is to
resurrect class conflict in this
society for the first time in 50
years," indicating that his per
sonal ideological underpin
nings may lean more to the left
than his policy statements
suggest.
Whether Hart's gamble with
this book pays off or not, it is
refreshing to at last see the
possibility of a presidential
campaign at least somewhat
based on the issues, and not
solely on mannerisms and
looks. While this book is not
very entertaining or funny, it is
a different and interesting ap
proach to policy and is written
by a man who may be "the next
President of the United
States," so it is definitely worth
more than a casual glance if
spied in your local bookstore.
