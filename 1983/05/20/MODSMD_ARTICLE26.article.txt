The Changing Anatomy of Britain
Random House $17.95
Anthony Sampson
No, this book is not another quickie at
tempt to play off of our wacky American
preoccupation with body-building and fit
ness. In fact, Anthony Sampson's The
Changing Anatomy of Britain is a well
researched, well-documented, far-from
routine physical examination of Britain and
its most sacred institutions. Sampson's
diagnosis: like Monty Python, the body is

sound, but the mental faculties are a bit ail
ing.
Though Sampson claims that he has
"tried not to impose any single theme or
thesis" on his presentation of contemporary
Britain, one quickly realizes that he is not
thrilled with the sticky traditionalism that he
believes to be the primary source of Britain's
"post-imperial malaise." In Sampson's very
professional opinion, cultural arterios
clerosis has been responsible for Britain's
economic decline and its bleak prospects for
recovery. However, the condition is not
terminal—fresh blood and a few more Eric
Idles are all that is needed for a complete
cure.
Having hurdled the driest aspect of any
review, (the raising of the author's mes
sage), let me hasten to say that The Changing
Anatomy of Britain is both palatable and en
tertaining leisure-time reading. I have to
admit that I was a little leary about reviewing
a book that is 435 pages long, that has noth
ing to do with any of my classes (much less
my major), and which has no tedium-easing
photographs or illustrations. The type isn't
even all that large.
But just consider: would any American
historian think to liken that most prestigious
of American exports, the Entrepreneur, to
"chimpanzees, jumping from tree to tree
and only occasionally dropping to ground
level?" Of course not. But even entrepre
neurs have mothers, and it is in this spirit of
high-minded practicality that Sampson
chooses to analyze the people and places of
that little island off the coast of Nova Scotia.
Sampson approaches the macro outline of
Anatomy in an orderly fashion. We are in
troduced to Britain by means of that most
British of institutions, the monarchy. Follow
ing our courtesies tothekingandqueen, we
are sped through the respective realms of

politics, government (yes, there is a distinc
tion) finance, and finally, industry. What
makes Anatomy worth the reading, how
ever, is not the form or even the style of
Sampson's writing, but its content. The lib
eral supply of anecdotes and goodies from
personal interviews with everyone who is
worth knowing in Britain are an unexpected
compliment to Sampson's historical per
spective on current events, and in no way
detract from the overall continuity of his
individual chapters.
Sampson is only disappointing in the open
ended quality of a few sections. In Chapter
22, "Entrepreneurs: the Outsiders come In
side," he decides what the facts of present
day entrepreneurial activity are, noting:
"The successes of entrepreneurs cannot be
explained only in economic or sociological
terms, like else in Britain. They be
long more to the world of anthropology, or
even zoology, as if they belonged to a
species from a strange habitat. While ordi
nary workers and managers move in their
well-worn sheep-tracks, the entrepreneurs
swing above them like chimpanzees. . . ."
Unfortunately, Sampson swings around a
little too much, the discontinuity of his
thoughts on entrepreneurial activity making
for a verbal slide-presentation of success
story vignettes.
Thus a discussion on the role of entrepre
neurs in the "recurring British saga of august
British institutions threatened by dreaded
intruders," leads from an insightful glimpse
at the roots of British distaste for entrepre
neurship to a three-page ramble about the
antics of Tiny Rowland.
As his name clearly suggests, Tiny appears
to be a large, shadowy figure who delights in
accumulating failing enterprises in the Third
World and somehow forcing them to make
him wealthyand notorious. In a laterchapter

on "The Press: the World and the Street
(Fleet)," I found out that Tiny owns the Ob
server which happens to be a rival of the
Sunday Times, which is big news in Britain.
Although I now know that Tiny is someone
to-be-reckoned-with in British financial cir
cles, I still have no idea why he is "a kind of
caricature of the species." Maybe all British
entrepreneurs are tall of shape and long of
face.
Perhaps Sampson is weakest in regard to
the story of entrepreneurial activity in Britain
becuse it is, as he demonstrates in other
chapters, such a revolutionary occupation
for Britons in general, and the financial
community in particular. In an excellent sec
tion on Britain's financial heartland, the City
of London (which, we are informed, is dis
tinct from London London, Sampson gives
us a thrilling feel for the static Old Lady who
was a hellraiser in her day, but who is now
having problems seeing her way around.
For Sampson, . . the City has become
like an offshore island in the heart of the
nation," its inhabitants separated from the
rest of the world by the metal barrier of habit
and tradition. Thus, "the style of the Bank (of
England) suggests financial monarchy, with
its own courtiers and king, such was the
set-up in 1694." Like their monarchs, the
bankers are a tribe, their status marked by
bowler hats and umbrellas and their actions
frighteningly predictable for their historical
continuity without change.
If England is the beaming mother of the
modern-day exchange floor, it is the less
proud parent of big-time bureaucracy. Brit
ain's civil-service positions, unlike those in
the United States, are considered plums,
with England's best and brightes vying for
jobs in the various ministries. However,

Britain's civil service has grown into a self
sustaining dragon that governments are not
only afraid to challenge, but are powerless
to contain.
Sampson, though he does not explicitly
say so, leaves us with the nasty suspicion
that elections, changes in government,
Maggie Thatcher v. "Sunny" |im Callahan,
and various other surface disturbances in
Britain's political waters don't mean very
much to the bulf of the civil service. What
ever, happens, they'll be able to manipulate
their ministry heads, and continue their
self-interested business as usual.
In the interests of honesty (and my sub
stantial stock holdings in the Random House
Publishing Company), I must recommend
that anyone who is even thinking of attend
ing Stanford's campus in Britain read The
Changing Anatomy of Britain. Recalling my
own limited experience living in England, I
found Sampson's presentation of contem
porary English institutions to be extremely
comprehensive and wonderfully revealing.
Anyone who has been to Cliveden will
wish that they had had this book as a ready
reference to understanding the cultural
idiosynchrasies that have given rise to Parli
ament, Oxbridge and the whole British edu
cational system, trading estates, British Ley
land and nationalized industries, the distinc
tion between solicitors, barristers and
|udges, and many other uniquely British in
stitutional phenomena. For those without
any background on Brits and Britain: not to
worry. Anthony Sampson's The Changing
Anatomy of Britain is as pleasant and edify
ing as a holiday in Bath. Cheers!

swing above them like chimpanzees. . . ."
Unfortunately, Sampson swings around a
little too much, the discontinuity of his
thoughts on entrepreneurial activity making
for a verbal slide-presentation of success
story vignettes.
Thus a discussion on the role of entrepre
neurs in the "recurring British saga of august
British institutions threatened by dreaded
intruders," leads from an insightful glimpse
at the roots of British distaste for entrepre
neurship to a three-page ramble about the
antics of Tiny Rowland.
As his name clearly suggests, Tiny appears
to be a large, shadowy figure who delights in
accumulating failing enterprises in the Third
World and somehow forcing them to make
him wealthyand notorious. In a laterchapter

on "The Press: the World and the Street
(Fleet)," I found out that Tiny owns the Ob
server which happens to be a rival of the
Sunday Times, which is big news in Britain.
Although I now know that Tiny is someone
to-be-reckoned-with in British financial cir
cles, I still have no idea why he is "a kind of
caricature of the species." Maybe all British
entrepreneurs are tall of shape and long of
face.
Perhaps Sampson is weakest in regard to
the story of entrepreneurial activity in Britain
becuse it is, as he demonstrates in other
chapters, such a revolutionary occupation
for Britons in general, and the financial
community in particular. In an excellent sec
tion on Britain's financial heartland, the City
of London (which, we are informed, is dis
tinct from London London, Sampson gives
us a thrilling feel for the static Old Lady who
was a hellraiser in her day, but who is now
having problems seeing her way around.
For Sampson, . . the City has become
like an offshore island in the heart of the
nation," its inhabitants separated from the
rest of the world by the metal barrier of habit
and tradition. Thus, "the style of the Bank (of
England) suggests financial monarchy, with
its own courtiers and king, such was the
set-up in 1694." Like their monarchs, the
bankers are a tribe, their status marked by
bowler hats and umbrellas and their actions
frighteningly predictable for their historical
continuity without change.
If England is the beaming mother of the
modern-day exchange floor, it is the less
proud parent of big-time bureaucracy. Brit
ain's civil-service positions, unlike those in
the United States, are considered plums,
with England's best and brightes vying for
jobs in the various ministries. However,

Britain's civil service has grown into a self
sustaining dragon that governments are not
only afraid to challenge, but are powerless
to contain.
Sampson, though he does not explicitly
say so, leaves us with the nasty suspicion
that elections, changes in government,
Maggie Thatcher v. "Sunny" |im Callahan,
and various other surface disturbances in
Britain's political waters don't mean very
much to the bulf of the civil service. What
ever, happens, they'll be able to manipulate
their ministry heads, and continue their
self-interested business as usual.
In the interests of honesty (and my sub
stantial stock holdings in the Random House
Publishing Company), I must recommend
that anyone who is even thinking of attend
ing Stanford's campus in Britain read The
Changing Anatomy of Britain. Recalling my
own limited experience living in England, I
found Sampson's presentation of contem
porary English institutions to be extremely
comprehensive and wonderfully revealing.
Anyone who has been to Cliveden will
wish that they had had this book as a ready
reference to understanding the cultural
idiosynchrasies that have given rise to Parli
ament, Oxbridge and the whole British edu
cational system, trading estates, British Ley
land and nationalized industries, the distinc
tion between solicitors, barristers and
|udges, and many other uniquely British in
stitutional phenomena. For those without
any background on Brits and Britain: not to
worry. Anthony Sampson's The Changing
Anatomy of Britain is as pleasant and edify
ing as a holiday in Bath. Cheers!

Random House $17.95

No, this book is not another quickie at
tempt to play off of our wacky American
preoccupation with body-building and fit
ness. In fact, Anthony Sampson's The
Changing Anatomy of Britain is a well
researched, well-documented, far-from
routine physical examination of Britain and
its most sacred institutions. Sampson's
diagnosis: like Monty Python, the body is

sound, but the mental faculties are a bit ail
ing.
Though Sampson claims that he has
"tried not to impose any single theme or
thesis" on his presentation of contemporary
Britain, one quickly realizes that he is not
thrilled with the sticky traditionalism that he
believes to be the primary source of Britain's
"post-imperial malaise." In Sampson's very
professional opinion, cultural arterios
clerosis has been responsible for Britain's
economic decline and its bleak prospects for
recovery. However, the condition is not
terminal—fresh blood and a few more Eric
Idles are all that is needed for a complete
cure.
Having hurdled the driest aspect of any
review, (the raising of the author's mes
sage), let me hasten to say that The Changing
Anatomy of Britain is both palatable and en
tertaining leisure-time reading. I have to
admit that I was a little leary about reviewing
a book that is 435 pages long, that has noth
ing to do with any of my classes (much less
my major), and which has no tedium-easing
photographs or illustrations. The type isn't
even all that large.
But just consider: would any American
historian think to liken that most prestigious
of American exports, the Entrepreneur, to
"chimpanzees, jumping from tree to tree
and only occasionally dropping to ground
level?" Of course not. But even entrepre
neurs have mothers, and it is in this spirit of
high-minded practicality that Sampson
chooses to analyze the people and places of
that little island off the coast of Nova Scotia.
Sampson approaches the macro outline of
Anatomy in an orderly fashion. We are in
troduced to Britain by means of that most
British of institutions, the monarchy. Follow
ing our courtesies tothekingandqueen, we
are sped through the respective realms of

politics, government (yes, there is a distinc
tion) finance, and finally, industry. What
makes Anatomy worth the reading, how
ever, is not the form or even the style of
Sampson's writing, but its content. The lib
eral supply of anecdotes and goodies from
personal interviews with everyone who is
worth knowing in Britain are an unexpected
compliment to Sampson's historical per
spective on current events, and in no way
detract from the overall continuity of his
individual chapters.
Sampson is only disappointing in the open
ended quality of a few sections. In Chapter
22, "Entrepreneurs: the Outsiders come In
side," he decides what the facts of present
day entrepreneurial activity are, noting:
"The successes of entrepreneurs cannot be
explained only in economic or sociological
terms, like else in Britain. They be
long more to the world of anthropology, or
even zoology, as if they belonged to a
species from a strange habitat. While ordi
nary workers and managers move in their
well-worn sheep-tracks, the entrepreneurs
swing above them like chimpanzees. . . ."
