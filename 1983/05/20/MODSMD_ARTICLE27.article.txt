## Computerizing the Farm: dorm, class use foreseen 
### ALEX TARC 
In the wake of the University's vow to pro
vide text editing equipment tor humanities
professors, administrators are now planning
innovative changes in how undergraduates
will use computers here in the future.
"A task force now exists, set up by Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and chaired
by Prof, lerry Lieberman, vice-provost and
dean of research. The group is trying to set a
three to five-year set ot objectives, and they
are now studying various problems and pos
sible options in all applications of computers
to education," said Ralph Corin, director of
Stanford's Low Overhead Time-sharing Sys
tem (LOTS) computer facility.
"One of our major goals for the future,
which must still be described as tentatively
proposed, is the establishment of a distri
buted computing tacility in which not all of a
job would be done by a single computer. We
plan to use LOTS and two new VAX 11780
computers made by Digital Equipment Cor
poration in addition to about 50 smaller com
puters. All of these machines will be electron
ically tied together in a network and will be
able to communicate with one another,"
Corin explained.

"There is a prospect of installing personal
computers in dormitories instead of the ter
minals currently in place. One advantage of
these computers would be that they would
not be subject to the load constraints of the
LOTS system and could be used for such low
priority tasks as text editing," Corin said.
Students can now use computers and high
quality printers to write papers and theses at
the Center tor Information Technology (CIT)
but the facility charges hourly fees for use of
its computers.
Stanford's reliance on distributed comput
ing to augment existing computer educa
tional facilities is substantially superior to iso
lated small computers. Despite this, some
schools now require incoming freshmen to
purchase micro-computers for use in cour
sework. But Stanford is not heading in this
direction.
"A policy of forced buying of personal
computers is not contemplated for the im
mediate future here at Stanford. Such a pol
icy is equivalent to raising tuition, and as a
consequence of Stanford's need-blind ad

missions policy, this would require more fi
nancial aid for the students. Because no clear
definition of the educational benefits which
would be derived from all students getting a
personal computer has been established, we
are not rushing to establish such a program,"
Corin said.
"LOTS does, however, offer some text
editing tacilities tor such projects as Ph.D.
dissertations. These large projects would not
fit in the restricted memory of a small per
sonal computer, so the LOTS facility is impor
tant.
"In addition to acting as an information
repository, LOTS also is an information
source. An example of its potential in this
regard is the recent establishment of a com
puterized library. In this system, all of the
University's library books and their locations
have been categorized and stored in a com
puter. This program program makes it possi
ble for to obtain listings of books on
any sub)ect or by any author 24 hours a day.
Instances ot direct, computer-assisted in
struction already exist at Stanford. One is a
logic class taught entirely by computer. This
"Introduction to Logic" class, initiated in
1971 by Philosophy Prof. Patrick Suppes, now
attracts more than 100 students each quarter,
with large numbers being turned away be
cause of limited computational facilities. An
ana logo us course of the same name is taught
b\ a human instructor, but it attracts only
about a third as many students.
"The amount of computer-aided instruc
tion here in the future will depend on the
extent to which faculty members develop
courseware.' Once developed, these pro
grams can be a worthwhile adjunct to lectur
ing. However, the faculty is not planning to
give up lecturing. The faculty is still responsi
ble for the quality of instruction. Corin said.
But Corin adds a note of warning to the
idea of computerized education: "The Uni
versity must exercise caution in changing its
structure because there are fads in educa
tion. The rush of late has been into engineer
ing and computer-related courses. We do
not know if it is a long-term switch, or if the
bubble will burst tomorrow and all students
will want to major in history. The University
does not want to waste money on fads,"
Corin said.
"The overwhelming perception among
undergraduates is that computer science
knowledge is important."
"We have discussed the possibility of
enacting a computer literacy academic re
quirement similar to a language or western
civilization requirement. However, we are
not quite sure what computer literacy is.
Hence wp cannot agree that it should be re
quired
"I think we have only begun to scratch the
surface and the real importance of comput
ers in education will not be evident until we
change the way that courses are taught. Be
fore we go about changing teaching tech
niques, we must first make sure that the
techniques we use as substitutes have been
proven," he said.
