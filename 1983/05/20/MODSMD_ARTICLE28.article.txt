# Med School administrators offer advice
## Avoiding the 'Premed Syndrome' 
### HARA LEVY 
Concerned about the nar
row science specialization of a
premed's undergraduate edu
cation and the anxiety of many
pre-meds seeking admission to
medical school, Stanford
physicians tell pre-meds that
medical school admission
should be put into its proper
perspective: an undergraduate
education should not revolve
around seeking admission to
medical school.
Stanford Medical School
Dean Dominick Purpura, for
example, stressed the impor
tance of a "total education and
pursuit of one s interests,"
stating that a broader educa
tion makes a better person and
a better physician. And Dr.
Elizabeth Short associate dean
of student affairsat the Medical
Center, said she believes that
premeds striving to gain entr
ance to medical school are
often overlooking too much:
"Instead of saying how do I
get into medical school?' pre
meds should be asking them
selves, do I really want to be
there and why?' Pre-meds
should be asking and finding
out if being a doctor is really
what they want to do for the
next 60 years," Short said.
Sometimes called "pre-med
syndrome," Short envisioned a
problem with students who do
only sciences: this prevents
them from getting a diverse
education or from taking
courses in which they do not
feel confident of getting A's.
"One should not disown the

sciences, and one planning to
go to medical school should
demonstrate that they can mas
ter science concepts quickly
and rationally, (but) it is a
means and not an end," Short
said.
"While chemistry may be the
language of medicine, other
aspects of medicine — ethics
and morality, philosophy, and
the understanding of health
care delivery systems — also
need to be considered," said
Purpura, in accord with Short.
More important, Purpura
stressed that what is really im

portant is "one's method of
learning and the thinking pro
cess," enabling one to cope
with situations without dying,
rather than what is actually
learned for test purposes, "be
cause that essentially
changes."
A major problem with the
pre-med mentality, according
to Short, is that "pre-meds
focus too intensely on getting
into medical school, which is
only a four-year span, and not
on what it is like to be a doctor
and if this is what they think
they want to do with the rest of

their lives; pre-meds should
not make a career out of get
ting into and going to medical
school."
Both Purpura and Short said
that while CPAs and MCA Is
provide a base entry test, they
are the minimum standards
considered tor admission. Ac
cording to Short they are "a
clutch but they are not all
telling. Admissions commit
tees look tor someone's inter
est and understanding of the
medical profession as opposed
to pie in the sky."
And Purpura stated that
"there really is no chemical
formula that guarantees ad
mission. While an applicant
should be well prepared in
biology, they should also have
parallel interests. That is what
makes the successful person
and applicant."
Both Purpura and Short also
implied that, in approaching
medical school, one should
not simply "go through the
motions" just to create a
good-looking application
While lab experience and hos
pital work do provide some
credibility for going into
medicine, they are not the solp
determinants for admission.
"Once the applicant passes the
basic screening process, the
total person is considered,
Purpura said.
"High status, pay, and secu
rity as reasons for going into
the medical profession do not
cut it with the admissions
committee and should not with
your life," Short concluded.
