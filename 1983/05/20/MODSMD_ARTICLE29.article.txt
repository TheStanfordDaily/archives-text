# Clinical Nutrition offers new view on diets

"Diets containing less than 1200 calories
per day put people into a semi-starvation
state," according to Dr. Keith Taylor, pro
fessor of medicine and gastroenterology
at the Medical School.
Taylor elaborates on this, and other im
portant aspects of nutritional status, in his
new book Clinical Nutrition, which he co
authored with Dr. Luan Anthony of the
University of Texas Health Center and pre
viously a fellow in Gastroenterology here.
"Diets which are too low in calories af
fect metabolism, including brain activity,"
said Taylor. "In the extreme they can cause
people to become dehydrated, stuporous,
or even comatose."
Taylor said safe diets contain not less
than 1200 calories per day, and have all of
the essential nutrients included. This type
of diet causes weight loss at a slower,
steadier pace, and can be combined with
increased physical activity. Even a diet of

this type, he stressed, should be done
under medical supervision.
Taylor said he wrote Clinical Nutrition as
a reference book to provide physicians,
medical students, nurses and health care
providers with the information they need
to be able to discuss eating habits and
educate their patients in nutrition.
According to Taylor, the book may be
the first all-inclusive medical text focusing
on the importance of what people eat.
"Like a medical textbook, each chapter
treats a different body system and includes
the basic medical information about each
one. The difference is that we emphasize
nutritional matters in relation to each sys
tem."
All the diets which have come and gone
are evaluated by Taylor, who has said that
the worst diets have been the liquid pro
tein type, in which a person typically takes
in only 300-400 calories per day. Many de
aths have been reported of people on this

type of diet, according to Taylor, usually
from cardiac irregularities. Taylor said
these irregularities are thought to be due
to an imbalance of body chemicals, but
"we really just don't know.
"Many of our problems with diet are of a
cultural origin," Taylor said. "Americans
have a tendency to a more restricted diet
than they need to, with too many animal
foods, especially meat.
"In many other countries," he said,
"people are vegetarians, or lacto
vegetarians, not just because it's all that is
available, but because they find meat un
desirable and unnecessary."
Taylor said he is encouraged by the ap
parent shift in American eating habits,
stressing increased consumption of veg
etables and less meat. He said he is now
writing a book "designed to capture the
interest of the general public, which will
trace the historical development of foods
and then show us the ways in which we
should use them."
