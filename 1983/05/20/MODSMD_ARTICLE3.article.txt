# Eight remain anonymous
## Faculty lists names on Hoover petition 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
The names of 76 faculty members
who signed the original Hoover peti
tion calling for a Faculty Senate de
bate were made public yesterday.
The release of the names is signifi
cant because until now adminis
trators at Hoover have refused to ac
knowledge charges and instead
questioned petition organizers' mo
tives in not releasing the names.
Of the 84 people whose names ap
pear on the faculty petition, eight
elected not to have their names
made public. Political Science Prof.
John Manley and English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz led the petition
drive.
Included among the 76 signers are
Political Science Profs. Hubert Mar
shall, David Danelski and Charles
Drekmeier; Law School Prof. Marc
Franklin; Chairman of the An
thropology Department Clifford
Barnett; English Profs. Wilfred Stone
and Albert Guerard; and Genetics
Profs. Leonard Herzenberg and Stan
ley Cohen.
Director of the Hoover Institution
W. Glenn Campbell, said in a brief
statement released earlier this week,
"the various political charges thatthe
petitioners, virtually all of whom still
remain anonymous, have hurled at
the Hoover Institution and its distin
guished scholars can only turn into a
discussion that is unnecessarily stri
dent on both sides."

The statement represented
Campbells's first comment to the
press since the beginning of the de
bate four weeks ago. Campbell was
unavailable for comment following
the signatures' release.
Faculty members who support the
counter-petition contending the
proposed inquiry would threaten
"academic freedom" have pointed
out the seeming "hypocrisy" of
withholding the names. Alphonse
)uiHand, chair of the French and Ita
lian Department, said recently, "If
they want full disclosure, doesn't it
strike you as strange that they don't
wish to disclose their own names?"
Manley and Rebholz explained
why they withheld the petition from
the public in a statement released
with the 76 names. "When individual
faculty members were asked to sign
the petition they were being asked to
endorse a faculty senate discussion
. . . they were not asked for their
permission to have their names
made public."
After the names were filed, the
Academic Secretary and organizers
of the petition drive decided against
releasing the names to the press.
According to the Manley-Rebholz
statement, "in light of the misinfor
mation that was circulated" the two
later asked the signers whether they
objected to having their names made
public.

HOOVER PETITION: Director W. Glenn Campbell yesterday made his first
statement to the press since the beginning of the Hoover controversy,
warning signers ot the initial petition that political charges 'can only turn
into a discussion that is unnecessarily strident on both sides/ Yesterday the
names of all but eight of the 84 faculty who signed the petition were
released.
Those signers of the petition con
tacted by the Daily yesterday all indi
cated that they signed assuming their
names would be public record.
Manley and Rebholz declined to
speculate why 76 faculty members al
lowed their names to be made public
or why eight did not. However they
emphasized that the petition "does
not represent a list of 'accusers' of
Hoover."
"No valid inferences can be made
about the beliefs and views of the
signers" beyond that they agreed to a
senate debate, they said. But when
asked why eight of the signers
wished to remain anonymous, Man
ley said he knew of one case where
the faculty member "feared repris
als."
Prof. Barnett said that while he had
assumed the petition would be made
public, he could understand why

faculty members might be afraid of
retaliation within their departments
or from Hoover. "While I have no
evidence of such instances, I can
very well see how this could be a fear
for junior faculty concerned with te
nure," he said.
George Marotta, public affairs
coordinator at Hoover, told the Daily
that he has a personal interest in the
names of the signers because he was
in the State Department when Sen.
Joseph McCarthy made a national
issue from charges of communism
he never substantiated.
"In this case, I am interested in the
motivation of the people signing . . .
in an academic community it is im
portant to know who is of what bias,"
Marotta said. The use of the term
"political partisanship" in references
to Hoover "implies that the signers
don't like the Hoover Institution," he
said.
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Ber
nard Roth, who aided Manley and
Rebholz in circulating the petition,
said he signed it assuming it would

be made public. But when the ques
tion of whether or not to release the
names came up, he felt that the
names should be made public
through the Academic Secretary, or
with the assent of the signers.
"I was the one who urged Manley
and Rebholz not to release the peti
tion," Roth said. In response to
whether withholding the names had
been wise politically, Roth said he
was not sure in retrospect, but that
"it seemed a violation of the signa
tures, since we had requested them
not for a public petition but for the
Academic Senate."
Roth said that Marotta's comparing
the Hoover petition to instances dur
ing the McCarthy period was "sheer
nonsense."
"People aren't going to debate the
issue with masks on," he said. "Sud
denly these guys (Hoover officials)
are reacting to the situation with
complete paranoia ... it makes you
think there must really be something
worth hiding at Hoover."
