# Eight remain anonymous
## Faculty lists names on Hoover petition 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
The names of 76 faculty members
who signed the original Hoover peti
tion calling for a Faculty Senate de
bate were made public yesterday.
The release of the names is signifi
cant because until now adminis
trators at Hoover have refused to ac
knowledge charges and instead
questioned petition organizers' mo
tives in not releasing the names.
Of the 84 people whose names ap
pear on the faculty petition, eight
elected not to have their names
made public. Political Science Prof.
John Manley and English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz led the petition
drive.
Included among the 76 signers are
Political Science Profs. Hubert Mar
shall, David Danelski and Charles
Drekmeier; Law School Prof. Marc
Franklin; Chairman of the An
thropology Department Clifford
Barnett; English Profs. Wilfred Stone
and Albert Guerard; and Genetics
Profs. Leonard Herzenberg and Stan
ley Cohen.
Director of the Hoover Institution
W. Glenn Campbell, said in a brief
statement released earlier this week,
"the various political charges thatthe
petitioners, virtually all of whom still
remain anonymous, have hurled at
the Hoover Institution and its distin
guished scholars can only turn into a
discussion that is unnecessarily stri
dent on both sides."

The statement represented
Campbells's first comment to the
press since the beginning of the de
bate four weeks ago. Campbell was
unavailable for comment following
the signatures' release.
Faculty members who support the
counter-petition contending the
proposed inquiry would threaten
"academic freedom" have pointed
out the seeming "hypocrisy" of
withholding the names. Alphonse
)uiHand, chair of the French and Ita
lian Department, said recently, "If
they want full disclosure, doesn't it
strike you as strange that they don't
wish to disclose their own names?"
Manley and Rebholz explained
why they withheld the petition from
the public in a statement released
with the 76 names. "When individual
faculty members were asked to sign
the petition they were being asked to
endorse a faculty senate discussion
. . . they were not asked for their
permission to have their names
made public."
After the names were filed, the
Academic Secretary and organizers
of the petition drive decided against
releasing the names to the press.
According to the Manley-Rebholz
statement, "in light of the misinfor
mation that was circulated" the two
later asked the signers whether they
objected to having their names made
public.
