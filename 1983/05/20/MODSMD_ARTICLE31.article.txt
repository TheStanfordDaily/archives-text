•' NCAA team title, members of
pthe Cardinal men's squad,
■competed yesterday in the in
wjdividuals portion of the tour-
Bnament. Forced indoors by a
■ driving Georgia rain, Stan
■ ford's top-three netters had to
Wadjust quickly to new condi
■ tions for the beginning rounds
■ of singles competition.
The Card was not so success-
I ful in its efforts to continue to
B dominate its opponent, how-
I ever. Dan Coldie, penalized
I three games for appearing late
1 to his match, could not find his
I earlier top form and suc-
I cumbed to SMU's Eric Korita in
I the first round 6-2, 7-5.

Stanford's other freshman
also had trouble. )ohn Letts
demolished Scott Appledorn
in straight sets in the prelimi
nary matchup, but ran up
against top-seeded Greg
Holmes of Utah in his next
match, losing 6-0,6-3. "John
got beat by a guy on a red-hot
streak," said coach Dick Gould
of his No. 2 player. "There was
really nothing he could do."
In the biggest surprise of the
individual competition so far,
Stanford ace Scott Davis was
upset in the second round.
Davis, who going into the
match had not dropped a set,
was stopped dead in his tracks
by UCLA's Jeff Klaparda 7-5,
6-4. "It really was quite a disap
nointing day," reflected

Gould. "All their (the Card's)
opponents were playing ex
ceptionally well."
lust prior to his loss, Davis
had swept Michigan's Mark
Meese by identical 6-3 tallies.
The Cardinal hopes to re
group and recoup its losses
during the rest of this weekend
in the doubles play. In first
round action tomorrow, Mark
McKeen and Jim Grabb square
off against Miami's Craig
Campbell/Ira Schwartz pair.
Meanwhile, top-seeded Davis
and Letts face Michigan Uni
versity's Maney/Meese duo.
The tourney will continue
throughout the weekend with
the team returning home late
Sunday evening.
