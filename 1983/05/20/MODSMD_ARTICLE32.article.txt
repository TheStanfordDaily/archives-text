# Card women remain in tourney

### MARK ZEIGLER 
Albuquerque, N.M. —
Caryn Copeland, the Stan
ford senior playing in her
last NCAA tennis champi
onship, is going out
fighting—and winning.
Undefeated Copeland
had a hand in three upsets
yesterday—two of them
over No. 6 seed— n the first
and second rounds of the
NCAA singles and doubles
tournaments.
"I thought her performance
was one of the gutsiest I've
ever seen," said Stanford
coach Frank Brennan.
"She showed a lot of
poise today, and vou've got
to have that poise."
Besides Copeland, only
junior Elise Burgin, the
tournament's No. 2 seed,
remained alive in singles
play. Freshman Alyce Wer
del was dropped by
freshman BarbGerken, UC
LA's No. 2 player, 6-3, 6-1.
Sophomore Linda Gates,
seeded in the second
eighth, was surprised by
USC's Cheryl jones in three
sets, 3-6, 7-6, (7-5), 6-1.
Both Cardinal doubles
teams that qualified —
Burgin and Gates, and
Copeland and Michelle
Weiss—passed their first
round tests yesterday.
But the day belonged to
Copeland, who has become
the Cinderella of the NCAA
competition.
The senior team captain
began the day by upsetting
UC-Berkeley's Barrie Bul
more, the Bears' No. 2 net
ter in straight sets 6-4, 7-5.
A few hours later, Cope
land was at it again, this time
stunning sixth-seeded
Cindy MacGregor from San
Diego State 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
And there was more to
come. Thirty minutes after
driving MacGregor to tears,
Copeland and doubles
partner Weiss defeated the
second No. 6 seed of the
afternoon—Florida's Kim
Clingan and K.ithy Holton
6-3, 6-4.

It was the manner in
which Copeland beat Mac-
Gregor in the "biggest win
of my college career" that
prompted Brennan to laud
her performance.
Deploying an excellent
net game with accurate, ap
proach shots and powerful
serves, Copeland stymied
MacGregor and convinc
ingly took the first set 6-2.
Copeland led 4-2 in the
second set and seemed
poised for victory. Then
MacGregor caught fire and
reeled off seven straight
games to capture the set 6-4,
and lead 3-0 in the third.
But it was then that Cope
land started a streak of her
own, winning six straight
games and the deciding set
6-3.
"I never give up, but I
didn't like the situation (be
hind 3-0 in the third set) at
all," Copeland explained.
"I have to admit, it looked
kind of grim."
The match was played in

gusty winds, which Cope
land used to her advantage.
"I don't mind it (wind) at all.
I thought I played the wind
pretty well."
Burgin had a relatively
easy time advancing to the
third round of singles al
though it was not an une
ventful day for the Card
junior.
After defeating Pepper
dine's No. 2 player, Elisa
Fernandez, 6-0,7-5, in the
opening round, Burgin was
matched against a player
who knew her game well—
teammate Weiss.
The junior Weiss de
feated Southern Metho
dist's Stephanie Fess
in straight sets 6-4, 6-0, ex
tending her singles win
streak at the NCAAs to five
matches. But Burgin snap
ped the streak with a 6-J, 6-2
victory.
"I found it really difficult
(to play Burgin)," Weiss
said. "I thought all year long
that she could win the

NCAAs and so I told myself I
couldn't beat her."
"You always want your
teammates to win and then
have to play them . .
There was one more
upset yesterday, but one
not in Stanford's favor.
Gates, the No. 2 netter,
seemed to have things
undercontrol against lones,
who played No. 6 for the
Trojans.
Gates won the first set 6-3,
while lones held off two
match points and was serv
ing for the second set at 6-5.
But the Cardinal sopho
more took four straight
points from lones and sent
the set to a 12-point tie
breaker.
"She got up (5-1) in the
tie-breaker, and changed
sides," Brennan said. "Then
it was like somebody took
over her body."
Gates went on to lose the
tie-breaker 7-5 and the third
set 6-1.
"This loss in particular I'm
just going to forget about,"
she said. "It just wasn't me
out there."
Gates stayed alive in the
doubles, though, as she and
Burgin defeated Georgia's
Lisa Spain and Nancy Cohen
6-2, 6-3. The Card duo takes
on Trinity's No. 2 team Lee
Elliot and Lisa Sassano in
tomorrow's second round.
Copeland and Weiss face
the Clemson pair of Gigi
Fernandez and Jane Fore
man. The winner of the
match most likely will play
the No.l seeded doubles
team of the tournament.
Trinity's Louise Allen and
Gretchen Rush. Burgin and
Gates are seeded second.
In singles, Burgin in
match with UCLA's Andrea
kriba tomorrow, the winner
of which takes on South
Carolina's Laura Bernstein
or UCLA's Heather Ludloff.
Burgin is 1-2 against Ludloff
this season, making her the
only player aginst which
Burgin has a losing record.
