Twins oust Oakland
Minneapolis — It was an interesting
game, to say the least.
Led by Gary Ward's three hits — in
cluding a homer — and five runs batted
in, the Minnesota Twins put together a
20-hit attack and ran away from the
Oakland A s 16-5 Wednesday. So de
cisive was the victory that the A's put a
non-pitcher on the mound to finish the
game.
A's Manager Steve Boros said he saw
that the game had "slipped away" and
did not want to use up his depleted
pitching staff. He decided third
baseman Wayne Gross was a good can
didate to make his major league
pitching debut.
"Gross came to mind," Boros said.
"He throws batting practice and is a
good athlete. I felt he could cope with
the situation. I was surprised he got
them out, though."
Gross went the final 21-3 innings, giv
ing up only two hits and no runs. He
walked one, struck out none and hit a
batter.
"Ward was sick today," Twins' Man
ager Billy Gardner said of his hitting
star, who also doubled and singled. "I
hope he stays sick."
Ward said he was dizzy after the
game, the result of battling the flu. He
also has been battling to raise his bat
ting average (.243) but in the meantime
is leading the American League with 32
RBI.
Giants belt Phillies
Philadelphia — Jack Clark received
some excellent information from his
teammates in the dugout Wednesday
night.
The San Francisco right fielder belted
a seventh-inning grand slam and drove
in six runs as he led the red-hot Giants
to an 8-1 victory over the Philadelphia
Phillies.
Clark hit his grand slam off Phillies re
liever Porfi Altamirano, whom he had
never faced before.
The advice paid off, as the Giants,
with Mike Krukow hurling six strong in

nings, won their 11th game in their last
13 outings. Krukow, acquired from the
Phillies in an off-season trade, gave up
only five hits, struck out six and walked
two in evening his record at 2-2.
Reliever Greg Minton pitched the
final three innings and gained his fifth
save.
Clark, who has been struggling all
season, went into the game with a .212
batting average and 12 RBI.
Philadelphia starter Dick Ruthven,
1-3, took the loss.
76ers rip Bucks
Philadelphia— Andrew Toney scored
30 points, Moses Malone 28 and Julius
Erving 24 as the Philadelphia 76ers
routed the Milwaukee Bucks 115-103 to
win the National Basketball Associa
tion's Eastern Conference title and ad
vance to the championship round for
the fourth time in seven years.
The 76ers, who won the Atlantic
Division with a 65-17 record, best in the
league, eliminated the Central Division
champion Bucks 4-1 in the best-of-sev
en series.
Philadelphia plays the winner of the
Western Conference final between the
defending champion Los Angeles
Lakers and San Antonio Spurs. The
Lakers led that series 3-1 going into
Wednesday night's game.
The 76ers broke the game open in the
third period when, leading 63-62, they
scored the next 10 points and 13 of 15 as
they built a 76-64 lead with 5:25 left in
the period.
The Bucks, however, rallied to re
duce their deficit to five points, at 81-76,
after a 12-foot jumper by 5-foot-8
Charlie Criss with 1:56 on the third-pe
riod clock.
But the 76ers scored the next seven
points for an 88-76 lead that was re
duced to 88-79 after three quarters on a
three-point field goal by Junior
Bridgeman.
The closest Milwaukee could get in
the final period was seven points, the
last at 92-85 with 9:33 left in the game.
Golf Classic shortened
Atlanta — The steady rains washed
out Thursday's scheduled opening
round in the Georgia-Pacific Atlanta
Golf Classic and reduced the tour

nament to a 54-hole event.
The format — weather permitting —
now calls for rounds of 18 holes today,
tomorrow and Sunday.
The tournament will be declared of
ficial, PGA Tour Tournament Director
Jack Tuthill said in a prepared
statement, "after 54 holes of play.
"The tournament will be shortened
to ... three rounds in order to fulfill a
CBS-television commitment," the
statement said.
Under similar circumstances, a
double round of 36 holes often is
played on the final day. CBS, however,
had scheduled a 3:30 p.m. EDT con
clusion of its national telecast Sunday.
The early finish made it impractical to
play 36 holes.
The possibility existed, however, that
continued rain could further disrupt
the revised schedule. The forecast was
for showers through Friday.
Officials declined to speculate about
the tournament format should further
delays be encountered. Two possi
bilities existed: reduction of the tour
nament to 36 holes, or extending play
through Monday.
Jones leaves football
Anaheim — Bert Jones, for 10 years a
leading National Football League pass
er, officially retired yesterday, tracing
his decision to a neck injury he suffered
last season and a warning from doctors
that another blow to the wrong place
could paralyzed him.
"I think only the players really realize
it,"the Los Angeles Rams' quarterback
said, choking back tears, "that when
you play, you're always just one hit
away from the end of your career."
The hit that ended Jones' career came
last November, when he collided with
linebacker Fulton Kuykendall of the At
lanta Falcons. Jones suffered a ruptured
disc in the collision.
The 31-year-old former LSU star un
derwent surgery last January after the
injury failed to respond to treatment.
He said doctors told him just prior to
the recent NFL draft that he could play
no more.
"They didn't tell me I shouldn't play,"
Jones said at a press conference at
Anaheim Stadium. "They told me I
couldn't play."
He said that he was told that one blow
to the wrong place could leave him per
manently paralyzed.

you play, you're always just one hit
away from the end of your career."
The hit that ended Jones' career came
last November, when he collided with
linebacker Fulton Kuykendall of the At
lanta Falcons. Jones suffered a ruptured
disc in the collision.
The 31-year-old former LSU star un
derwent surgery last January after the
injury failed to respond to treatment.
He said doctors told him just prior to
the recent NFL draft that he could play
no more.
"They didn't tell me I shouldn't play,"
Jones said at a press conference at
Anaheim Stadium. "They told me I
couldn't play."
He said that he was told that one blow
to the wrong place could leave him per

Twins oust Oakland
Minneapolis — It was an interesting
game, to say the least.
Led by Gary Ward's three hits — in
cluding a homer — and five runs batted
in, the Minnesota Twins put together a
20-hit attack and ran away from the
Oakland A s 16-5 Wednesday. So de
cisive was the victory that the A's put a
non-pitcher on the mound to finish the
game.
A's Manager Steve Boros said he saw
that the game had "slipped away" and
did not want to use up his depleted
pitching staff. He decided third
baseman Wayne Gross was a good can
didate to make his major league
pitching debut.
"Gross came to mind," Boros said.
"He throws batting practice and is a
good athlete. I felt he could cope with
the situation. I was surprised he got
them out, though."
Gross went the final 21-3 innings, giv
ing up only two hits and no runs. He
walked one, struck out none and hit a
batter.
"Ward was sick today," Twins' Man
ager Billy Gardner said of his hitting
star, who also doubled and singled. "I
hope he stays sick."
Ward said he was dizzy after the
game, the result of battling the flu. He
also has been battling to raise his bat
ting average (.243) but in the meantime
is leading the American League with 32
RBI.
Giants belt Phillies
Philadelphia — Jack Clark received
some excellent information from his
teammates in the dugout Wednesday
night.
The San Francisco right fielder belted
a seventh-inning grand slam and drove
in six runs as he led the red-hot Giants
to an 8-1 victory over the Philadelphia
Phillies.
Clark hit his grand slam off Phillies re
liever Porfi Altamirano, whom he had
never faced before.
The advice paid off, as the Giants,
with Mike Krukow hurling six strong in

nings, won their 11th game in their last
13 outings. Krukow, acquired from the
Phillies in an off-season trade, gave up
only five hits, struck out six and walked
two in evening his record at 2-2.
Reliever Greg Minton pitched the
final three innings and gained his fifth
save.
Clark, who has been struggling all
season, went into the game with a .212
batting average and 12 RBI.
Philadelphia starter Dick Ruthven,
1-3, took the loss.
76ers rip Bucks
Philadelphia— Andrew Toney scored
30 points, Moses Malone 28 and Julius
Erving 24 as the Philadelphia 76ers
routed the Milwaukee Bucks 115-103 to
win the National Basketball Associa
tion's Eastern Conference title and ad
vance to the championship round for
the fourth time in seven years.
The 76ers, who won the Atlantic
Division with a 65-17 record, best in the
league, eliminated the Central Division
champion Bucks 4-1 in the best-of-sev
en series.
Philadelphia plays the winner of the
Western Conference final between the
defending champion Los Angeles
Lakers and San Antonio Spurs. The
Lakers led that series 3-1 going into
Wednesday night's game.
The 76ers broke the game open in the
third period when, leading 63-62, they
scored the next 10 points and 13 of 15 as
they built a 76-64 lead with 5:25 left in
the period.
The Bucks, however, rallied to re
duce their deficit to five points, at 81-76,
after a 12-foot jumper by 5-foot-8
Charlie Criss with 1:56 on the third-pe
riod clock.
But the 76ers scored the next seven
points for an 88-76 lead that was re
duced to 88-79 after three quarters on a
three-point field goal by Junior
Bridgeman.
The closest Milwaukee could get in
the final period was seven points, the
last at 92-85 with 9:33 left in the game.
Golf Classic shortened
Atlanta — The steady rains washed
out Thursday's scheduled opening
round in the Georgia-Pacific Atlanta
Golf Classic and reduced the tour

nament to a 54-hole event.
The format — weather permitting —
now calls for rounds of 18 holes today,
tomorrow and Sunday.
The tournament will be declared of
ficial, PGA Tour Tournament Director
Jack Tuthill said in a prepared
statement, "after 54 holes of play.
"The tournament will be shortened
to ... three rounds in order to fulfill a
CBS-television commitment," the
statement said.
Under similar circumstances, a
double round of 36 holes often is
played on the final day. CBS, however,
had scheduled a 3:30 p.m. EDT con
clusion of its national telecast Sunday.
The early finish made it impractical to
play 36 holes.
The possibility existed, however, that
continued rain could further disrupt
the revised schedule. The forecast was
for showers through Friday.
Officials declined to speculate about
the tournament format should further
delays be encountered. Two possi
bilities existed: reduction of the tour
nament to 36 holes, or extending play
through Monday.
Jones leaves football
Anaheim — Bert Jones, for 10 years a
leading National Football League pass
er, officially retired yesterday, tracing
his decision to a neck injury he suffered

that another blow to the wrong place
