"He was not aroused

that engrossed his whole
being with its flaming re

— Louise Brooks, speak
ing of C.W. Pabst in Lulu
In Hollywood
Pandora's Box (1928) *
Haus Mitteleuropa
Frank Wedekind's great plays
Earth Spirit and Pandora's Box
were compressed into two mas
terpieces in other media: Alban
Berg's opera Lulu and this Ex
pressionist silent film by G.W.
Pabst. Lulu, played by the ex
traordinary Louise Brooks, with
her razor-edge bangs, is beau
tiful, carnal and amoral; she
draws men to her but refuses
responsibility for their destruc
tion when they crash on the
rocks. There are two unforget
table sequences: the scene in
which Lulu, in her dressing
room before a show she is ap
pearing in, refuses to perform
as long as her lover's fiancee is
in the audience; and the Jack
the Ripper episode, with
Gustav Diessl. The cast, which
includes Fritz Kortner and Fran
cis Lederer as father and son,
both lovers of Lulu, and Alice
Roberts as her devoted lesbian
companion Countess
Geschwitz, is impeccable.
Plays Thursday evening.
The Spider's Stratagem
(1970) ★
Casa italiana
The source of this early
Bernardo Bertolucci film, made
for Italian TV, is a great puzzle
story by Jorge Luis Borges called
"Theme of the Traitor and the
Hero." The movie is too sparse
ly scripted and acted (by Giulio
Brogi, as both father and son) to
be much good, but the direc
tion and photography (by Vit
torio Storaro) are devastatingly
exquisite; the imagery upstages
the action, and one remains
blissfully dazzled even while
the threads of the story are slip
ping away. This may be the best
made bad movie of all time.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Jaws (1975) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Steven Spielberg's shark
centered suspense adventure is
one of the most deeply pleas
urable scare pictures since mov
ies began. Tne Peter Benchley-
Carl Gottlieb script (based on
Benchley's stupetyingly banal
novel) has surprising pockets of
wit which the sharp, com
fortable trio of leading men
(Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss
and Roy Scheider) makes the
most of; but the champion
clown is Spielberg, who sees to
it that we laugh at our own ter
ror. John Williams did the musi
cal score (of course), Bill Butler
photographed, and Verna
Fields supervised the amazing
editing pyrotechnics. When the
movie gets away from the
ocean and into the town (for
scenes featuring Lorraine Gary
and Murray Hamilton), it
flattens out a little, but
Spielberg's film sense is too
strong to keep us stranded on
the streets for long.
Plays tomorrow evening.
The Spy Who Loved Me
(1977)
Memorial Auditorium
The highlights of the 10th
James Bond movie (one of the
best of the series) are a ski se
quence which is almost as good
as the one in On Her Majesty's
Secret Service and the best vil
lain since Oddjob, the deadly
boomerang thrower in Cold
finger: "Jaws" (Richard Kiel), a
giant with a mouth full of lethal
cutlery. Roger Moore and
Barbara Bach star; Lewis Gilbert
directed.
Plays Sunday evening.

The Wild One (1954) ★
Fox, Redwood City
This was one of the key
American films of the '50s: it
isn't very good, but it has a great
deal of energy and a classic per
formance by Marlon Branoo as
Johnny, the anti-establishment
biker millions of young men
identified with. The obvious
equivalent among movies of
the next moviegoing gener
ation is Easy Rider, but The Wild
One is less masochistic and de
pressive, and a lot more fun.
John Paxton's script (out of
Frank Rooney's story "The
Cyclists' Raid," which was in
spired by an actual incident)
contains a very famous ex
change: Mary Murphy asks
Brando, "What are you rebell
ing against?" and he replies,
"Whaddya got?" With a very
young Lee Marvin, Robert
Keith and Jay C. Flippen. Laslo
Benedek directed.
Plays today and Monday with
Easy Rider.
Triumph of the Will (1936)
★
Fox, Redwood City
Leni Riefenstahl fuses Greek,
Roman, Norse and Anglo-Sax
on mythology as well as Biblical
imagery in this most famous
and most disturbing of all prop
aganda films, dedicated to the
deification of Adolf Hitler. The
crowd sequences are in a class
with the ride of the Klan in Grif
fith's Birth of a Nation, and one
shot of soldiers' arms raised si
multaneously in salute like so
many self-propelled playing
cards is one of the most startling
images in the history of cinema.
This movie still holds so much
power that it offers an un
equalled magnetic-repellent
viewing experience. It's great,
despicable art.
Plays Wednesday with
Mephisto.
The Man from Snowy River
Fox, Redwood City
Tom Burlinson plays a young
man who lands a job on a ranch
in this Australian coming-of
age picture. The story, based on
a poem by Banjo Paterson, in
volves horses and romance and
Kirk Douglas in a double role;
it's prime material for a won
derful children's adventure,
but the director, George Miller
(not to be confused with the
George Miller of the Mad Max
pictures), botches much of it.
The big climactic scenes have
no visual excitement, the
dialogue (by Jphn Djxqn) is
bari&f, and the' 1 performances
are mediocre. You keep wish
ing Carroll Ballard would move
in and save the day. With Jack
Thompson, Sigrid Thornton
and Lorraine Bayly.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with My Brilliant Career.
Veronika Voss
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This posthumously released
Rainer Werner Fassbinder film
is full of the kind of cinematic
allusiveness and self-proclaim
ing flourishes that his followers
adore: the plot, about a former
movie queen (Rosel Zech) now
at the mercy of a predatory psy
chiatrist (Annamarie Duringer)
who supplies heroin for her, is a
variation of Sunset Boulevard,
and every scene in it is a hyper
bolic version of Hollywood
filmmaking of the '40s and '50s.
However, just making these
connections doesn't fill a movie
up. Veronika Voss is neither
moving nor funny, and since
everyone in it acts in the same
overwrought, emblematic
style, you may have difficulty
distinguishing performances
and scenes in your head two
days after you've seen it.
Plays Tuesday with The Mar
riage of Maria Braun.

Adam's Rib (1949) *
Tresidder Union, Room 270
Ruth Gordon and Garson
Kanin, a husband-and-wife
screenwriting team, came up
with an inspired plot idea for
this Spencer Tracy-Katharine
Hepburn movie: the stars play
husband-and-wife lawyers who
argue opposite sides of a case of
attempted murder. It's a prize
comedy. Tracy and Hepburn
had already made five films to
gether (and would make three
more), and their teamwork
glistened with wit and finesse;
furthermore, they had never
had anywhere near as sharp a
script to play. (Three years later,
Gordon and Kanin wrote a still
better one for them — Pat and
Mike.) George Cukor directed,
seamlessly, Cole Porter wrote
the (mediocre) theme song,
"Amanda," and a number of
buoyantly talented people pro
vided support for the stars —
David Wayne, Tom Ewell, Judy
Holliday and Jean Hagen. (Ewell
and Holliday play the plaintiff
and defendant in the court
case.)
Plays Monday evening.
The Marriage of Maria
Braun (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The opening scenes are in
triguing — Maria (Hanna
Schygulla) loses her husband to
the war on their wedding day;
after it is over she parades up
and down the platform at the
train station witn a placard ask
ing homecoming soldiers for
information on his where
abouts. But the movie soon de
generates into a political fable
about Germany and capitalism
that is alternately obvious and
opaque. Though much better
crafted than Rainer
Fassbinder's earlier movies, it's
emotionally blank. Schuygulla,
Fassbinder's favorite actress,
looks amazing and gives an in
teresting, Dietrich-like per
formance.
Plays Tuesday with Veronika
Voss.

The Great Muppet Caper
(1981)
Fox, Redwood City
Visually, this film (directed by
Muppet master Jim Henson) isa
lot better than The Muppet
Movie, which looked flat and
cardboard and under
populated, and though it's easi
ly forgotten fluff, it's Tightly wit
ty and parodistic. Dozens of
movie musicals are sent up, in
cluding Top Hat, Roberta,
Easter Parade, the Busby
Berkeley canon, and (hilarious
ly) csther Williams' aquatic
films. Diana Rigg appears to be
having a wonderful time
caricaturing a grande dame
whose jewels are stolen; the
other humans in the cast in
clude Charles Grodin, Jack
Warden, Robert Morley, Peter
Falk, Peter Ustinov and John
Cleese, and they interact with
the Muppets in a pleasantly cas
ual way. Joe Roposo's songs
aren't all they might be.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Adventures of
Popeye.

Modern Times (1936) ★
Lagunita Dining Room; Larkin
West Lounge
By 1936, no Hollywood stu
dio nad made a silent picture in
eight years, but Charles Chaplin
had still not released a talkie
when he wrote, directed and
starred in this proletarian com
edy, though he did add a musi
cal soundtrack, composed by
Chaplin, of course, and featur
ing the sentimental popular
ballad "Smile (Thougn Your
Heart Is Breaking)." (His first
talkie, The Great Dictator,
didn't come out until 1940.) This
obstinacy may seem perverse —
until you see the movie.
Chaplin was clearly inspired by
Rene Clair's 1931 A Nous la Lib
erte (particularly in the factory
sequence). Paulette Goddarcl,
one of his few decent leading
ladies and one of his several
wives, plays the Gamine, and
the fair-sized supporting cast
includes Chester Conklin and
Henry Bergman.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
Tuesday (Larkin).

Mephisto
Fox, Redwood City
Klaus Mann's 1936 novel
about the disintegration of in
tellectual life under Hitler isn't
terribly well written, but the
fascinating subject matter
keeps you reading. Istvan
Szabo's film version never al
lows you to be swept away; de
spite some startling moments, it
is disjointed and a little stolid —
it lacks rhythm and shape. And
the editing is often dismaying:
gripping moments dissipate
when small, slow scenes follow
them. As the actor-director
Hendrik Hofgen, a thinly dis
guised representation of
Gustav Grundgens (who man
aged the State Theater under
the Third Reich), Klaus Maria
Brandauer gives a fascinating
performance; his acting is a
strange mixture of commitment
and self-consciousness. (He's a
little like Mick Jagger.)
Plays Wednesday with
Triumph of the Will.

My Brilliant Career (1979)
Fox, Redwood City
Sybylla (Judy Davis, in a lively
performance) is a rebellious
spirit in turn-of-the-century
Australia who is given a tem
porary reprieve from farm life
when she is invited to visit her
t wealthy, stuffy aunt. All the oth
er women in her family posture
and say things like "Marriage
gives us respectability" and"I
prayed to God for guidance,"
so we can see how independent
Sybylla is by comparison; did
she spring full-blown, we won
der, from this conservative
brood? This patchwork of bits
from Little Women and The
Sound of Music and various co
medies of the 19305, adapted by
Eleanor Whitcombe from Miles
Franklin's novel and directed
by Gill Armstrong, is rather
clumsily staged, and the role of
Sybylla, who flirts with, writing
and politics and rejects tVie pro
posal of a decent, intelligent
landowner (Sam Neill) is puzzl
ing to say the least.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday

man who lands a job on a ranch
in this Australian coming-of
age picture. The story, based on
a poem by Banjo Paterson, in
volves horses and romance and
Kirk Douglas in a double role;
it's prime material for a won
derful children's adventure,
but the director, George Miller
(not to be confused with the
George Miller of the Mad Max
pictures), botches much of it.
The big climactic scenes have
no visual excitement, the
dialogue (by Jphn Djxqn) is
bari&f, and the' 1 performances
are mediocre. You keep wish
ing Carroll Ballard would move
in and save the day. With Jack
Thompson, Sigrid Thornton
and Lorraine Bayly.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with My Brilliant Career.
Veronika Voss
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This posthumously released
Rainer Werner Fassbinder film
is full of the kind of cinematic
allusiveness and self-proclaim
ing flourishes that his followers
adore: the plot, about a former
movie queen (Rosel Zech) now
at the mercy of a predatory psy
chiatrist (Annamarie Duringer)
who supplies heroin for her, is a
variation of Sunset Boulevard,
and every scene in it is a hyper
bolic version of Hollywood
filmmaking of the '40s and '50s.
However, just making these
connections doesn't fill a movie
up. Veronika Voss is neither
moving nor funny, and since
everyone in it acts in the same
overwrought, emblematic
style, you may have difficulty
distinguishing performances
and scenes in your head two
days after you've seen it.
Plays Tuesday with The Mar
riage of Maria Braun.

Adam's Rib (1949) *
Tresidder Union, Room 270
Ruth Gordon and Garson
Kanin, a husband-and-wife
screenwriting team, came up
with an inspired plot idea for
this Spencer Tracy-Katharine
Hepburn movie: the stars play
husband-and-wife lawyers who
argue opposite sides of a case of
attempted murder. It's a prize
comedy. Tracy and Hepburn
had already made five films to
gether (and would make three
more), and their teamwork
glistened with wit and finesse;
furthermore, they had never
had anywhere near as sharp a
script to play. (Three years later,
Gordon and Kanin wrote a still
better one for them — Pat and
Mike.) George Cukor directed,
seamlessly, Cole Porter wrote
the (mediocre) theme song,
"Amanda," and a number of
buoyantly talented people pro
vided support for the stars —
David Wayne, Tom Ewell, Judy
Holliday and Jean Hagen. (Ewell
and Holliday play the plaintiff
and defendant in the court
case.)
Plays Monday evening.
The Marriage of Maria
Braun (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The opening scenes are in
triguing — Maria (Hanna
Schygulla) loses her husband to
the war on their wedding day;
after it is over she parades up
and down the platform at the
train station witn a placard ask
ing homecoming soldiers for
information on his where
abouts. But the movie soon de
generates into a political fable
about Germany and capitalism
that is alternately obvious and
opaque. Though much better
crafted than Rainer
Fassbinder's earlier movies, it's
emotionally blank. Schuygulla,
Fassbinder's favorite actress,
looks amazing and gives an in
teresting, Dietrich-like per
formance.
Plays Tuesday with Veronika
Voss.

The Great Muppet Caper
(1981)
Fox, Redwood City
Visually, this film (directed by
Muppet master Jim Henson) isa
lot better than The Muppet
Movie, which looked flat and
cardboard and under
populated, and though it's easi
ly forgotten fluff, it's Tightly wit
ty and parodistic. Dozens of
movie musicals are sent up, in
cluding Top Hat, Roberta,
Easter Parade, the Busby
Berkeley canon, and (hilarious
ly) csther Williams' aquatic
films. Diana Rigg appears to be
having a wonderful time
caricaturing a grande dame
whose jewels are stolen; the
other humans in the cast in
clude Charles Grodin, Jack
Warden, Robert Morley, Peter
Falk, Peter Ustinov and John
Cleese, and they interact with
the Muppets in a pleasantly cas
ual way. Joe Roposo's songs
aren't all they might be.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Adventures of
Popeye.

Modern Times (1936) ★
Lagunita Dining Room; Larkin
West Lounge
By 1936, no Hollywood stu
dio nad made a silent picture in
eight years, but Charles Chaplin
had still not released a talkie
when he wrote, directed and
starred in this proletarian com
edy, though he did add a musi
cal soundtrack, composed by
Chaplin, of course, and featur
ing the sentimental popular
ballad "Smile (Thougn Your
Heart Is Breaking)." (His first
talkie, The Great Dictator,
didn't come out until 1940.) This
obstinacy may seem perverse —
until you see the movie.
Chaplin was clearly inspired by
Rene Clair's 1931 A Nous la Lib
erte (particularly in the factory
sequence). Paulette Goddarcl,
one of his few decent leading
ladies and one of his several
wives, plays the Gamine, and
the fair-sized supporting cast
includes Chester Conklin and
Henry Bergman.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
Tuesday (Larkin).

Mephisto
Fox, Redwood City
Klaus Mann's 1936 novel
about the disintegration of in
tellectual life under Hitler isn't
terribly well written, but the
fascinating subject matter
keeps you reading. Istvan
Szabo's film version never al
lows you to be swept away; de
spite some startling moments, it
is disjointed and a little stolid —
it lacks rhythm and shape. And
the editing is often dismaying:
gripping moments dissipate
when small, slow scenes follow
them. As the actor-director
Hendrik Hofgen, a thinly dis
guised representation of
Gustav Grundgens (who man
aged the State Theater under
the Third Reich), Klaus Maria
Brandauer gives a fascinating
performance; his acting is a
strange mixture of commitment
and self-consciousness. (He's a
little like Mick Jagger.)
Plays Wednesday with
Triumph of the Will.

My Brilliant Career (1979)
Fox, Redwood City
Sybylla (Judy Davis, in a lively
performance) is a rebellious
spirit in turn-of-the-century
Australia who is given a tem
porary reprieve from farm life
when she is invited to visit her
t wealthy, stuffy aunt. All the oth
er women in her family posture
and say things like "Marriage
gives us respectability" and"I
prayed to God for guidance,"
so we can see how independent
Sybylla is by comparison; did
she spring full-blown, we won
der, from this conservative
brood? This patchwork of bits
from Little Women and The
Sound of Music and various co
medies of the 19305, adapted by
Eleanor Whitcombe from Miles
Franklin's novel and directed
by Gill Armstrong, is rather
clumsily staged, and the role of
Sybylla, who flirts with, writing
and politics and rejects tVie pro
posal of a decent, intelligent
landowner (Sam Neill) is puzzl
ing to say the least.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Man from Snowy
River.

"He was not aroused
by sexual love, which he
dismissed as an enevating
myth. It was sexual hate
that engrossed his whole

In Hollywood
Pandora's Box (1928) *
Haus Mitteleuropa
Frank Wedekind's great plays
Earth Spirit and Pandora's Box
were compressed into two mas
terpieces in other media: Alban
Berg's opera Lulu and this Ex
pressionist silent film by G.W.
Pabst. Lulu, played by the ex
traordinary Louise Brooks, with
her razor-edge bangs, is beau
tiful, carnal and amoral; she
draws men to her but refuses
responsibility for their destruc
tion when they crash on the
rocks. There are two unforget
table sequences: the scene in
which Lulu, in her dressing
room before a show she is ap
pearing in, refuses to perform
as long as her lover's fiancee is
in the audience; and the Jack
the Ripper episode, with
Gustav Diessl. The cast, which
includes Fritz Kortner and Fran
cis Lederer as father and son,
both lovers of Lulu, and Alice
Roberts as her devoted lesbian
companion Countess
Geschwitz, is impeccable.
Plays Thursday evening.
The Spider's Stratagem
(1970) ★
Casa italiana
The source of this early
Bernardo Bertolucci film, made
for Italian TV, is a great puzzle
story by Jorge Luis Borges called
"Theme of the Traitor and the
Hero." The movie is too sparse
ly scripted and acted (by Giulio
Brogi, as both father and son) to
be much good, but the direc
tion and photography (by Vit
torio Storaro) are devastatingly
exquisite; the imagery upstages
the action, and one remains
blissfully dazzled even while
the threads of the story are slip
ping away. This may be the best
made bad movie of all time.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Jaws (1975) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Steven Spielberg's shark
centered suspense adventure is
one of the most deeply pleas
urable scare pictures since mov
ies began. Tne Peter Benchley-
Carl Gottlieb script (based on
Benchley's stupetyingly banal
novel) has surprising pockets of
wit which the sharp, com
fortable trio of leading men
(Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss
and Roy Scheider) makes the
most of; but the champion
clown is Spielberg, who sees to
it that we laugh at our own ter
ror. John Williams did the musi
cal score (of course), Bill Butler
photographed, and Verna
Fields supervised the amazing
editing pyrotechnics. When the
movie gets away from the
ocean and into the town (for
scenes featuring Lorraine Gary
and Murray Hamilton), it
flattens out a little, but
Spielberg's film sense is too
strong to keep us stranded on
the streets for long.
Plays tomorrow evening.
The Spy Who Loved Me
(1977)
Memorial Auditorium
The highlights of the 10th
James Bond movie (one of the
best of the series) are a ski se

Plays Sunday evening.

The Wild One (1954) ★
Fox, Redwood City
This was one of the key
American films of the '50s: it
isn't very good, but it has a great
deal of energy and a classic per
formance by Marlon Branoo as
Johnny, the anti-establishment
biker millions of young men
identified with. The obvious
equivalent among movies of
the next moviegoing gener
ation is Easy Rider, but The Wild
One is less masochistic and de
pressive, and a lot more fun.
John Paxton's script (out of
Frank Rooney's story "The
Cyclists' Raid," which was in
spired by an actual incident)
contains a very famous ex
change: Mary Murphy asks
Brando, "What are you rebell
ing against?" and he replies,
"Whaddya got?" With a very
young Lee Marvin, Robert
Keith and Jay C. Flippen. Laslo
Benedek directed.
Plays today and Monday with

★
Fox, Redwood City
Leni Riefenstahl fuses Greek,
Roman, Norse and Anglo-Sax
on mythology as well as Biblical
imagery in this most famous
and most disturbing of all prop
aganda films, dedicated to the
deification of Adolf Hitler. The
crowd sequences are in a class
with the ride of the Klan in Grif
fith's Birth of a Nation, and one
shot of soldiers' arms raised si
multaneously in salute like so
many self-propelled playing
cards is one of the most startling
images in the history of cinema.
This movie still holds so much

Mephisto
Fox, Redwood City
Klaus Mann's 1936 novel
about the disintegration of in
tellectual life under Hitler isn't
terribly well written, but the
fascinating subject matter
keeps you reading. Istvan
Szabo's film version never al
lows you to be swept away; de
spite some startling moments, it
is disjointed and a little stolid —
it lacks rhythm and shape. And
the editing is often dismaying:
gripping moments dissipate
when small, slow scenes follow
them. As the actor-director
Hendrik Hofgen, a thinly dis
guised representation of
Gustav Grundgens (who man
aged the State Theater under
the Third Reich), Klaus Maria
Brandauer gives a fascinating
performance; his acting is a
strange mixture of commitment
and self-consciousness. (He's a
little like Mick Jagger.)
Plays Wednesday with

My Brilliant Career (1979)
Fox, Redwood City
Sybylla (Judy Davis, in a lively
performance) is a rebellious
spirit in turn-of-the-century
Australia who is given a tem
porary reprieve from farm life
when she is invited to visit her
t wealthy, stuffy aunt. All the oth
er women in her family posture
and say things like "Marriage
gives us respectability" and"I
prayed to God for guidance,"
so we can see how independent
Sybylla is by comparison; did
she spring full-blown, we won
der, from this conservative
brood? This patchwork of bits
from Little Women and The
Sound of Music and various co
medies of the 19305, adapted by
Eleanor Whitcombe from Miles
Franklin's novel and directed
by Gill Armstrong, is rather
clumsily staged, and the role of
Sybylla, who flirts with, writing
and politics and rejects tVie pro
posal of a decent, intelligent
landowner (Sam Neill) is puzzl
ing to say the least.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday

Pandora's Box (1928) *
Haus Mitteleuropa
Frank Wedekind's great plays
Earth Spirit and Pandora's Box
were compressed into two mas
terpieces in other media: Alban
Berg's opera Lulu and this Ex
pressionist silent film by G.W.
Pabst. Lulu, played by the ex
traordinary Louise Brooks, with
her razor-edge bangs, is beau
tiful, carnal and amoral; she
draws men to her but refuses
responsibility for their destruc
tion when they crash on the
rocks. There are two unforget
table sequences: the scene in
which Lulu, in her dressing
room before a show she is ap
pearing in, refuses to perform
as long as her lover's fiancee is
in the audience; and the Jack
the Ripper episode, with
Gustav Diessl. The cast, which
includes Fritz Kortner and Fran
cis Lederer as father and son,
both lovers of Lulu, and Alice
Roberts as her devoted lesbian
companion Countess
Geschwitz, is impeccable.

The Spider's Stratagem
(1970) ★
Casa italiana
The source of this early
Bernardo Bertolucci film, made
for Italian TV, is a great puzzle
story by Jorge Luis Borges called
"Theme of the Traitor and the
Hero." The movie is too sparse
ly scripted and acted (by Giulio
Brogi, as both father and son) to
be much good, but the direc
tion and photography (by Vit
torio Storaro) are devastatingly
exquisite; the imagery upstages
the action, and one remains
blissfully dazzled even while
the threads of the story are slip

Jaws (1975) ★
Kresge Auditorium
Steven Spielberg's shark

one of the most deeply pleas

Carl Gottlieb script (based on
Benchley's stupetyingly banal
novel) has surprising pockets of
wit which the sharp, com
fortable trio of leading men
(Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss
and Roy Scheider) makes the
most of; but the champion
clown is Spielberg, who sees to
it that we laugh at our own ter
ror. John Williams did the musi
cal score (of course), Bill Butler
photographed, and Verna
Fields supervised the amazing
editing pyrotechnics. When the
movie gets away from the
ocean and into the town (for
scenes featuring Lorraine Gary
and Murray Hamilton), it
flattens out a little, but
Spielberg's film sense is too

Plays tomorrow evening.
The Spy Who Loved Me

The Wild One (1954) ★
Fox, Redwood City
This was one of the key
American films of the '50s: it
isn't very good, but it has a great
deal of energy and a classic per
formance by Marlon Branoo as
Johnny, the anti-establishment
biker millions of young men
identified with. The obvious
equivalent among movies of
the next moviegoing gener
ation is Easy Rider, but The Wild
One is less masochistic and de
pressive, and a lot more fun.
John Paxton's script (out of
Frank Rooney's story "The
Cyclists' Raid," which was in
spired by an actual incident)
contains a very famous ex
change: Mary Murphy asks
Brando, "What are you rebell
ing against?" and he replies,
"Whaddya got?" With a very
young Lee Marvin, Robert
Keith and Jay C. Flippen. Laslo
Benedek directed.
Plays today and Monday with

Triumph of the Will (1936)
★
Fox, Redwood City
Leni Riefenstahl fuses Greek,
Roman, Norse and Anglo-Sax
on mythology as well as Biblical
imagery in this most famous
and most disturbing of all prop
aganda films, dedicated to the
deification of Adolf Hitler. The
crowd sequences are in a class
with the ride of the Klan in Grif
fith's Birth of a Nation, and one
shot of soldiers' arms raised si
multaneously in salute like so
many self-propelled playing
cards is one of the most startling
images in the history of cinema.
This movie still holds so much
power that it offers an un
equalled magnetic-repellent
viewing experience. It's great,
despicable art.
Plays Wednesday with
Mephisto.
The Man from Snowy River
Fox, Redwood City
Tom Burlinson plays a young
man who lands a job on a ranch
in this Australian coming-of
age picture. The story, based on
a poem by Banjo Paterson, in
volves horses and romance and
Kirk Douglas in a double role;
it's prime material for a won
derful children's adventure,
but the director, George Miller
(not to be confused with the
George Miller of the Mad Max
pictures), botches much of it.
The big climactic scenes have
no visual excitement, the
dialogue (by Jphn Djxqn) is
bari&f, and the' 1 performances
are mediocre. You keep wish

in and save the day. With Jack
Thompson, Sigrid Thornton
and Lorraine Bayly.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with My Brilliant Career.
Veronika Voss
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This posthumously released
Rainer Werner Fassbinder film
is full of the kind of cinematic
allusiveness and self-proclaim
ing flourishes that his followers
adore: the plot, about a former
movie queen (Rosel Zech) now
at the mercy of a predatory psy
chiatrist (Annamarie Duringer)
who supplies heroin for her, is a
variation of Sunset Boulevard,
and every scene in it is a hyper
bolic version of Hollywood
filmmaking of the '40s and '50s.
However, just making these
connections doesn't fill a movie
up. Veronika Voss is neither
moving nor funny, and since
everyone in it acts in the same
overwrought, emblematic
style, you may have difficulty
distinguishing performances
and scenes in your head two
days after you've seen it.
Plays Tuesday with The Mar

Adam's Rib (1949) *
Tresidder Union, Room 270
Ruth Gordon and Garson
Kanin, a husband-and-wife
screenwriting team, came up
with an inspired plot idea for
this Spencer Tracy-Katharine
Hepburn movie: the stars play
husband-and-wife lawyers who
argue opposite sides of a case of
attempted murder. It's a prize
comedy. Tracy and Hepburn
had already made five films to
gether (and would make three
more), and their teamwork
glistened with wit and finesse;
furthermore, they had never
had anywhere near as sharp a
script to play. (Three years later,
Gordon and Kanin wrote a still
better one for them — Pat and
Mike.) George Cukor directed,
seamlessly, Cole Porter wrote
the (mediocre) theme song,
"Amanda," and a number of
buoyantly talented people pro
vided support for the stars —
David Wayne, Tom Ewell, Judy
Holliday and Jean Hagen. (Ewell
and Holliday play the plaintiff
and defendant in the court
case.)
Plays Monday evening.
The Marriage of Maria
Braun (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto

Schygulla) loses her husband to
the war on their wedding day;
after it is over she parades up
and down the platform at the
train station witn a placard ask
ing homecoming soldiers for
information on his where
abouts. But the movie soon de
generates into a political fable
about Germany and capitalism
that is alternately obvious and
opaque. Though much better
crafted than Rainer
Fassbinder's earlier movies, it's
emotionally blank. Schuygulla,
Fassbinder's favorite actress,
looks amazing and gives an in
teresting, Dietrich-like per
formance.
Plays Tuesday with Veronika

The Great Muppet Caper
(1981)
Fox, Redwood City
Visually, this film (directed by
Muppet master Jim Henson) isa
lot better than The Muppet
Movie, which looked flat and
cardboard and under
populated, and though it's easi

ty and parodistic. Dozens of
movie musicals are sent up, in
cluding Top Hat, Roberta,
Easter Parade, the Busby
Berkeley canon, and (hilarious
ly) csther Williams' aquatic
films. Diana Rigg appears to be
having a wonderful time
caricaturing a grande dame
whose jewels are stolen; the
other humans in the cast in
clude Charles Grodin, Jack
Warden, Robert Morley, Peter
Falk, Peter Ustinov and John
Cleese, and they interact with
the Muppets in a pleasantly cas

aren't all they might be.

Modern Times (1936) ★
Lagunita Dining Room; Larkin

By 1936, no Hollywood stu

eight years, but Charles Chaplin
had still not released a talkie
when he wrote, directed and
starred in this proletarian com

cal soundtrack, composed by
Chaplin, of course, and featur
ing the sentimental popular
ballad "Smile (Thougn Your
Heart Is Breaking)." (His first
talkie, The Great Dictator,
didn't come out until 1940.) This
obstinacy may seem perverse —
until you see the movie.
Chaplin was clearly inspired by
Rene Clair's 1931 A Nous la Lib

sequence). Paulette Goddarcl,
one of his few decent leading
ladies and one of his several

The highlights of the 10th
James Bond movie (one of the
best of the series) are a ski se
quence which is almost as good
as the one in On Her Majesty's
Secret Service and the best vil
lain since Oddjob, the deadly
boomerang thrower in Cold
finger: "Jaws" (Richard Kiel), a
giant with a mouth full of lethal
cutlery. Roger Moore and
Barbara Bach star; Lewis Gilbert
directed.
Plays Sunday evening.

The Wild One (1954) ★
Fox, Redwood City
This was one of the key
American films of the '50s: it
isn't very good, but it has a great
deal of energy and a classic per
formance by Marlon Branoo as
Johnny, the anti-establishment
biker millions of young men
identified with. The obvious
equivalent among movies of
the next moviegoing gener
ation is Easy Rider, but The Wild
One is less masochistic and de
pressive, and a lot more fun.
John Paxton's script (out of
Frank Rooney's story "The
Cyclists' Raid," which was in
spired by an actual incident)
contains a very famous ex
change: Mary Murphy asks
Brando, "What are you rebell
ing against?" and he replies,
"Whaddya got?" With a very
young Lee Marvin, Robert
Keith and Jay C. Flippen. Laslo
Benedek directed.
Plays today and Monday with
Easy Rider.
Triumph of the Will (1936)
★
Fox, Redwood City
Leni Riefenstahl fuses Greek,
Roman, Norse and Anglo-Sax
on mythology as well as Biblical
imagery in this most famous
and most disturbing of all prop
aganda films, dedicated to the
deification of Adolf Hitler. The
crowd sequences are in a class
with the ride of the Klan in Grif
fith's Birth of a Nation, and one
shot of soldiers' arms raised si
multaneously in salute like so
many self-propelled playing
cards is one of the most startling
images in the history of cinema.
This movie still holds so much
power that it offers an un
equalled magnetic-repellent
viewing experience. It's great,
despicable art.
Plays Wednesday with
Mephisto.
The Man from Snowy River
Fox, Redwood City
Tom Burlinson plays a young
man who lands a job on a ranch
in this Australian coming-of
age picture. The story, based on
a poem by Banjo Paterson, in
volves horses and romance and
Kirk Douglas in a double role;
it's prime material for a won
derful children's adventure,
but the director, George Miller
(not to be confused with the
George Miller of the Mad Max
pictures), botches much of it.
The big climactic scenes have
no visual excitement, the
dialogue (by Jphn Djxqn) is
bari&f, and the' 1 performances
are mediocre. You keep wish
ing Carroll Ballard would move
in and save the day. With Jack
Thompson, Sigrid Thornton
and Lorraine Bayly.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with My Brilliant Career.
Veronika Voss
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This posthumously released
Rainer Werner Fassbinder film
is full of the kind of cinematic
allusiveness and self-proclaim
ing flourishes that his followers
adore: the plot, about a former
movie queen (Rosel Zech) now
at the mercy of a predatory psy
chiatrist (Annamarie Duringer)
who supplies heroin for her, is a
variation of Sunset Boulevard,
and every scene in it is a hyper
bolic version of Hollywood
filmmaking of the '40s and '50s.
However, just making these
connections doesn't fill a movie
up. Veronika Voss is neither
moving nor funny, and since
everyone in it acts in the same
overwrought, emblematic
style, you may have difficulty
distinguishing performances
and scenes in your head two
days after you've seen it.
Plays Tuesday with The Mar
riage of Maria Braun.

Adam's Rib (1949) *
Tresidder Union, Room 270
Ruth Gordon and Garson
Kanin, a husband-and-wife
screenwriting team, came up
with an inspired plot idea for
this Spencer Tracy-Katharine
Hepburn movie: the stars play
husband-and-wife lawyers who
argue opposite sides of a case of
attempted murder. It's a prize
comedy. Tracy and Hepburn
had already made five films to
gether (and would make three
more), and their teamwork
glistened with wit and finesse;
furthermore, they had never
had anywhere near as sharp a
script to play. (Three years later,
Gordon and Kanin wrote a still
better one for them — Pat and
Mike.) George Cukor directed,
seamlessly, Cole Porter wrote
the (mediocre) theme song,
"Amanda," and a number of
buoyantly talented people pro
vided support for the stars —
David Wayne, Tom Ewell, Judy
Holliday and Jean Hagen. (Ewell
and Holliday play the plaintiff
and defendant in the court
case.)
Plays Monday evening.
The Marriage of Maria
Braun (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The opening scenes are in
triguing — Maria (Hanna
Schygulla) loses her husband to
the war on their wedding day;
after it is over she parades up
and down the platform at the
train station witn a placard ask
ing homecoming soldiers for
information on his where
abouts. But the movie soon de
generates into a political fable
about Germany and capitalism
that is alternately obvious and
opaque. Though much better
crafted than Rainer
Fassbinder's earlier movies, it's
emotionally blank. Schuygulla,
Fassbinder's favorite actress,
looks amazing and gives an in
teresting, Dietrich-like per
formance.
Plays Tuesday with Veronika
Voss.

The Great Muppet Caper
(1981)
Fox, Redwood City
Visually, this film (directed by
Muppet master Jim Henson) isa
lot better than The Muppet
Movie, which looked flat and
cardboard and under
populated, and though it's easi
ly forgotten fluff, it's Tightly wit
ty and parodistic. Dozens of
movie musicals are sent up, in
cluding Top Hat, Roberta,
Easter Parade, the Busby
Berkeley canon, and (hilarious
ly) csther Williams' aquatic
films. Diana Rigg appears to be
having a wonderful time
caricaturing a grande dame
whose jewels are stolen; the
other humans in the cast in
clude Charles Grodin, Jack
Warden, Robert Morley, Peter
Falk, Peter Ustinov and John
Cleese, and they interact with
the Muppets in a pleasantly cas
ual way. Joe Roposo's songs
aren't all they might be.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Adventures of
Popeye.

Modern Times (1936) ★
Lagunita Dining Room; Larkin
West Lounge
By 1936, no Hollywood stu
dio nad made a silent picture in
eight years, but Charles Chaplin
had still not released a talkie
when he wrote, directed and
starred in this proletarian com
edy, though he did add a musi
cal soundtrack, composed by
Chaplin, of course, and featur
ing the sentimental popular
ballad "Smile (Thougn Your
Heart Is Breaking)." (His first
talkie, The Great Dictator,
didn't come out until 1940.) This
obstinacy may seem perverse —
until you see the movie.
Chaplin was clearly inspired by
Rene Clair's 1931 A Nous la Lib
erte (particularly in the factory
sequence). Paulette Goddarcl,
one of his few decent leading
ladies and one of his several
wives, plays the Gamine, and
the fair-sized supporting cast
includes Chester Conklin and
Henry Bergman.
Plays Monday (Lagunita) and
Tuesday (Larkin).

Mephisto
Fox, Redwood City
Klaus Mann's 1936 novel
about the disintegration of in
tellectual life under Hitler isn't
terribly well written, but the
fascinating subject matter
keeps you reading. Istvan
Szabo's film version never al
lows you to be swept away; de
spite some startling moments, it
is disjointed and a little stolid —
it lacks rhythm and shape. And
the editing is often dismaying:
gripping moments dissipate
when small, slow scenes follow
them. As the actor-director
Hendrik Hofgen, a thinly dis
guised representation of
Gustav Grundgens (who man
aged the State Theater under
the Third Reich), Klaus Maria
Brandauer gives a fascinating
performance; his acting is a
strange mixture of commitment
and self-consciousness. (He's a
little like Mick Jagger.)
Plays Wednesday with
Triumph of the Will.

My Brilliant Career (1979)
Fox, Redwood City
Sybylla (Judy Davis, in a lively
performance) is a rebellious
spirit in turn-of-the-century
Australia who is given a tem
porary reprieve from farm life
when she is invited to visit her
t wealthy, stuffy aunt. All the oth
er women in her family posture
and say things like "Marriage
gives us respectability" and"I
prayed to God for guidance,"
so we can see how independent
Sybylla is by comparison; did
she spring full-blown, we won
der, from this conservative
brood? This patchwork of bits
from Little Women and The
Sound of Music and various co
medies of the 19305, adapted by
Eleanor Whitcombe from Miles
Franklin's novel and directed
by Gill Armstrong, is rather
clumsily staged, and the role of
Sybylla, who flirts with, writing
and politics and rejects tVie pro
posal of a decent, intelligent
landowner (Sam Neill) is puzzl
ing to say the least.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Man from Snowy
River.
