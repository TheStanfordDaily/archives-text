memorating groundbreaking at the future Cen
ter for Integrated Systems (CIS) site, charac
terized the center as one of the key institutions
which will assist in building a successful U.S.
economy over the next few decades.
DeLauer, who is the U.S. undersecretary of
defense for research and development, said,
"The basis of our security has to be the well
being of our economy. There's no question that
technology has to be in the forefront of our plans
for security."
The public official spoke in front of an audi
ence of more than 400 persons, which included
members from the 19 corporations which are
co-sponsoring the program (along with the De
partment of Defense), as well as students and
University faculty who are affiliated with the pro
gram.
Earlier yesterday afternoon, groundbreaking

ceremonies were held at the construction site of
the future CIS building. William Hewlett, co-
1>... U„..l <= r ... ... ,
addressed a crowd of more than 300 people on
the merits of corporate support for American
university education.
"U.S. industry must recognize that much of its
lifeblood is dependent on basic research con
ducted in our universities. It is entirely approp
riate, then, that industry become a more vigor
ous supporter of university research programs.
CIS is a splendid model of how that can be
done," Hewlett said.
Hewlett noted that lapan, West Germany,
France and the United Kingdom are all increasing
their support for research and development pro
grams. "The U.S. must increase its level of basic
research to remain competitive in the world
market," Hewlett said.
Hewlett described CIS as a consortium of 19

major United States corporations that have joined Stan
ford and the U.S. government to undertake basic and
applied research across a broad spectrum of disciplines.
Each sponsoring company pledged $750,000 towards the
construction of ihe new CIS building, and each is ex
pected to contribute $100,000 annually to partially sup
port research programs at the center.
According to George Heilmeier, who is the senior vice
president of research, development and engineering at
Texas Instruments, his corporation is sponsoring the
program for several reasons. They are interested in the
research results, and want early access to new ideas
which result from the research. Moreover, they want
access to the University faculty, and access to Stanford
graduate students as well.
Although the results of the research will be made
public, Heilmeier said that interaction between Univer
sity faculty and corporate employees will be important in
helping American industry stay at the forefront of
technology.
Heilmeier, a member of the CIS advisory committee,
said, "The ability to interact with people before it (the
research results) is published is critical." In an industry
where the technology is relentlessly advancing, "A six
month lead time is exceptionally helpful," Heilmeier
said.
Indeed, University President Donald Kennedy men
tioned the importance of using basic research in social
and industrial applications. Speaking before the dinner,
Kennedy said, "Social sponsorship of innovation is a

role in which universities have been assigned a major
part." He characterized CIS as part of "a new set of
relationships which is needed to speed technology
transfers from the University to industry without damag
ing the University."
DeLauer, who graduated from Stanford with a degree
in Mechanical Engineering, also stressed the economic
and educational value of the CIS program. While he
noted that the military may be able to utilize CIS re
search in developing information systems, he said that
the University and industry will be the primary be
neficiaries of the program.
"The Department of Defense has always been a
pusher, a leader of new concepts," DeLauer said. "But
the Department of Defense only represents 8 percent of
the country's manufacturing capability, and only 3 per
cent of its electronics capability. It (DoD) can't provide
for the economic well-being of the country, though it
can help . . . Wetry to spend the taxpayer's money smart
enough so that it can flow over into the economy.
"The real heart of the thing (CIS) is that it is educa
tional for students. We wanted graduate students to
come and work for us," DeLauer added.
Glen Trewitt, a Ph.D. candidate in electrical engineer
ing, agreed with DeLauer. "Students get really good
contacts with industry, which they wouldn't normally
have. We're able to be in contact with companies for at
least a year," said Trewitt, who is currently working with
CIS.
The 19 sponsoring corporations include Digital
Equipment, Fairchild Camera, GE, GTE, Gould/Ami,
Hewlett-Packard, Honeywell, Intel, IBM, ITT, Mon
santo, Motorola, Northrop, Phillips/Signetics, Tek
tronix, Texas Instruments, TRW, United Technologies,
and Xerox.
