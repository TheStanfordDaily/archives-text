### MARC PEYSER 
A seminar on U.S.-Soviet arms
control and Soviet domestic issues
was abruptly canceled Wednesday
when two Soviet researchers were
denied visas by their government.
Eric Horvitz, member of the Stan
ford Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum which sponsored the event,
said cancellations of this sort are
"not unusual. Often these events
have been canceled by our State De
partment to keep Russians, speaking
in San Francisco, from traveling
down here, near the sensitive Silicon
Valley area.
"This is the first time, though, that
I remember the Soviets have denied
their own people visas."
|ohn Maddox, co-director of the
Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum, agreed with Horvitz. "It is not
at all unusual for the Russians to
agree to come to a meeting and not
show up without saying anything,"
he said.

A spokesman at the Soviet consul
ate in San Francisco told Maddox the
Russians "had to stay and teach," he
said. However, he said this seemed
"quite unlikely whereas they (the
Soviet researchers) had recently sent
a telegram affirming their trip."
A spokesman at the consulate told
the Daily, "Our diplomats do not
know anything about these people
and the situation."
The forum, which was to feature,
in addition to the two Soviet dig
nitaries from the Foreign Ministry
and the Moscow State Institute for
International Relations, Law Prof.
John Barton and law student Mar
garet Niles, has not been resched
uled, according to Horvitz. How
ever, the Arms Control and Disar
mament Forum plans to host "similar
events in the future," he said.
In the past, the group has strived to
arrange "large debates on campus of
high quality — made of people of
many different views," Horvitz ad
ded.
