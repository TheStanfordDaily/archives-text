Budget a defeat for Reagan
Washington — The Republican-controlled Senate,
in a stunning defeat for President Reagan, gave final
approval 50-49 late yesterday night to a 1984 budget
relying on tax increases of $9.9 billion next year and
more than $74 billion over three years to reduce
swollen federal deficits.
The budget itself does not raise taxes, but requires
the full Senate to do so later in the year.
Democrats and moderate Republicans have al
ready said they hope to use that requirement to place
a cap on this year's 10 percent tax cut and repeal tax
indexing.
In addition to a setback for Reagan, the vote was the
most embarrassing defeat Baker has suffered since he
became leader of the Republican Senate in 1981.

In the end, it was Baker who gave in. He declared he
was determined to have the Senate pass a budget,
even if he didn't like it, and personally called for the
second vote on Gorton's plan. Baker voted against it,
but enough Republicans switched their votes to give
it tentative approval.
U.S. to release F-16s to Israel
Washington — President Reagan has decided to
release to Israel the 75 F-16 jet fighters that he had or
dered held until that country agreed to withdraw its
forces from Lebanon, administration officials said yes
terday.
The announcement, which may come today, is a
U.S. gesture of cooperation with tne Jewish state fol
lowing the signing earlier this week of the Lebanese-

Israeli peace agreement.
The actual withdrawal of Israeli forces depends on a
parallel withdrawal by Syria and the Palestine Liber
ation Organization, which have attacked the agree
ment and show no sign of cooperation.
Secretary of State George Shultz, who negotiated
the final stage of the Lebanese-Israeli accord in 17
days of shuttle diplomacy, told a House subcommit
tee that U.S. diplomatic efforts are under way to build
support for the pact in the Arab world and thus in
directly persuade the balking parties.
Shultz said that "the view of other Arab countries is
developing very strongly that Syria should withdraw."
As part of the U.S. effort, Reagan's special Mideast
•mvoy, Philip Habib, flew to Saudi Arabia yesterday
night for immediate discussions with King Fahd, ac
cording to reports from the Middle East. Saudi Arabia

is considered among the most influential Arab na
tions and, in Shultz' view, supports the U.S. effort to
obtain withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.
Syrian troops hold fast
Beirut —- Syria, intensifying its war of words with
Lebanon, said yesterday it would never pull its troops
out of northern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley as long
as Lebanese President Amin Gemayel remains in
power.
The latest evidence of Syria's hard-line position op
posing Lebanon's troop-withdrawal agreement with
Israel came in a commentary broadcast by state-run
Damascus radio, which reflects the thinking of the
government of President Hafez Assad.
