Budget a defeat for Reagan
Washington — The Republican-controlled Senate,
in a stunning defeat for President Reagan, gave final
approval 50-49 late yesterday night to a 1984 budget
relying on tax increases of $9.9 billion next year and
more than $74 billion over three years to reduce
swollen federal deficits.
The budget itself does not raise taxes, but requires
the full Senate to do so later in the year.
Democrats and moderate Republicans have al
ready said they hope to use that requirement to place
a cap on this year's 10 percent tax cut and repeal tax
indexing.
In addition to a setback for Reagan, the vote was the
most embarrassing defeat Baker has suffered since he
became leader of the Republican Senate in 1981.

In the end, it was Baker who gave in. He declared he
was determined to have the Senate pass a budget,
even if he didn't like it, and personally called for the
second vote on Gorton's plan. Baker voted against it,
but enough Republicans switched their votes to give
it tentative approval.
U.S. to release F-16s to Israel
Washington — President Reagan has decided to
release to Israel the 75 F-16 jet fighters that he had or
dered held until that country agreed to withdraw its
forces from Lebanon, administration officials said yes
terday.
The announcement, which may come today, is a
U.S. gesture of cooperation with tne Jewish state fol
lowing the signing earlier this week of the Lebanese-

Israeli peace agreement.
The actual withdrawal of Israeli forces depends on a
parallel withdrawal by Syria and the Palestine Liber
ation Organization, which have attacked the agree
ment and show no sign of cooperation.
Secretary of State George Shultz, who negotiated
the final stage of the Lebanese-Israeli accord in 17
days of shuttle diplomacy, told a House subcommit
tee that U.S. diplomatic efforts are under way to build
support for the pact in the Arab world and thus in
directly persuade the balking parties.
Shultz said that "the view of other Arab countries is
developing very strongly that Syria should withdraw."
As part of the U.S. effort, Reagan's special Mideast
•mvoy, Philip Habib, flew to Saudi Arabia yesterday
night for immediate discussions with King Fahd, ac
cording to reports from the Middle East. Saudi Arabia

is considered among the most influential Arab na
tions and, in Shultz' view, supports the U.S. effort to
obtain withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.
Syrian troops hold fast
Beirut —- Syria, intensifying its war of words with
Lebanon, said yesterday it would never pull its troops
out of northern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley as long
as Lebanese President Amin Gemayel remains in
power.
The latest evidence of Syria's hard-line position op
posing Lebanon's troop-withdrawal agreement with
Israel came in a commentary broadcast by state-run
Damascus radio, which reflects the thinking of the
government of President Hafez Assad.
"We will never allow the Arab masses in the liber
ated areas of Tripoli and the Bekaa to fall into the
hands of Israel and its Falangist ally," the broadcast
said.
Gemayel's father, Pierre, is the founder of the right
wing Falange Party, which effectively controls the
Christian-dominated part of Lebanon around East
Beirut and the coastal area immediately to the north
of the capital. Gemayel's brother, Bashir, was the
Falange's military strongman, as well as president
elect, before his assassination last Sept. 14.
"Our national and regional duties obligate us to de
fend the liberated territories and the Arab-Lebanese
masses in these territories," the broadcast said. "Our
armed forces will pursue this national duty until the
Lebanese people can overcome the plot against its
territory. Syria will stand by its obligations at whatever
cost. The only decision taken over Arab land is an
Arab decision, and the only determination is an Arab
one. The next few days will prove this to be true."
Reaganomics under fire
Washington — Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill fired
a broadside at President Reagan from the House floor
yesterday, saying Reagan's economic program is cruel
to America's poor and middle class.
With unusually harsh words, a White House official
quickly returned the criticism against O'Neill and
House Democratic Leader Jim Wright of Texas, who
earlier this week called Reagan "the biggest alibi artist
ever to serve in the White House."
"I don't know what's got into Wright and Tip," said
White House spokesman Larry Speakes. "I think more
and more those two guys are taking to flights of parti
san fantasy here lately. I don't know whether it has to
do with age or with the fact we've got an election
coming up."
O'Neill (D-Mass.) had made similar comments
before the House convened, prompting Rep. Robert
Walker (R-Pa.) to rise on the House floorto denounce
O'Neill and his "liberal cronies" fortrying to increase
federal spending, raise taxes and expand welfare pro
grams.
White House tied to EPA scandal
Washington — Rita Lavelle, the former Environ
mental Protection Agency official in charge of the
"superfund" toxic waste cleanup program, discussed
the political use of the fund with Michael Deaver, a
top adviser to President Reagan, a House committee
chairman charged today.
Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, released a 1982
memo from Lavelle to Deaver, deputy White House
chief of staff, discussing how "superfund" projects in
Indianaand New Jersey could beannouncedto bene
fit candidates favored by the White House.
"The memorandum makes clear that Lavelle and
Beaver had been discussing the use of 'superfund' for
the intended benefit of certain congressional can
didates, a governor and the president of the United
States," Dingell said.
In addition, Dingell said, the calendars of both
Lavelle and former EPA Administrator Anne Burford
show they met on Sept. 23 with Edwin Meese, the
counselor to the president, to discuss the cleanup
fund. Two days later, he said, Burford traveled to New
Jersey to announce cleanup actions.
"Clearly, there was closer political involvement by
White House officials in the 'superfund' program
than has heretofore been acknowledged," Dingell
said, saying the subcommittee needed to learn all the
facts.
As a result of the 413-0 House contempt vote,
Lavelle faces criminal prosecution for failing to testify.
She was fired by President Reagan Feb. 7.
Economic growth slow
Washington — The economic recovery in the first
quarter of this year was weaker than previously was
believed and after-tax corporate profits fell sharply in
that period, the Department of Commerce reported
yesterday.
It said the economy expanded at an annual rate of
only 2.5 percent in the opening months of 1983, com
pared to a 3.1 percent growth figure originally calcu
lated for the gross national product, the broadest
measure of economic activity.
Corporations' net profits plunged 4.6 percent from
January through March, a steeper drop than in the
previous quarter, when most analysts say the worst re
cession since the end of World War II finally ended
after 18 months.
After-tax profits dipped 1.3 percent in the last quar
ter of 1982 and were down 22.4 percent for the year.
However, despite the latest figures, both govern
ment and private economists said growth will speed
up in the current quarter on the basis of April read

ings tor industrial production, employment, retail
sales and other economic indicators.
Allen Sinai, senior vice president of Data Resources
Inc., a private consulting firm, predicted that business
profits likely would rise 10 percent or more in the sec
ond quarter, despite what he called a subpar recovery
compared to most post-recession rebounds of the
past 35 years.
He said GNP may hit a yearly pace of as high as 7
percent in the April-June period, primarily because of
a surge in consumer spending and a much slower re
duction in business inventories.
Eastern jet hijacked
Miami — A New York-bound Eastern Airlines jet
was hijacked to Cuba yesterday, the third air piracy
this month, officials said.
Flight 24, a Boeing 727 jet with 125 passengers and a
crew of seven, left Miami International Airportat2:l9
p.m. bound for La Guardia Airport in New York City,
said Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock.
"When the aircraft was 60 miles northeast of Palm
Beach, the pilot reported a man aboard who wanted
to go to Havana," said Jack Barker, spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta.
There was no immediate information from the pilot
on whether the hijacker had a weapon, Ashlock said,
adding the crew "just let them know the reasons they
feel are sufficient to go down" to Cuba.
"We'll just wait until he gets back to Miami and see
what happens," Ashlock said.
Reagan makes faces
Washington — "I've been told this is all off the rec
ord and the cameras are off," President Reagan told
the black-tie crowd at the White House News Photog
raphers Association dinner Wednesday night. " ...
I've been waiting years to do this."
Then the president of the United States, before
1000 guests, stuck his thumbs in his ears, fingers
spread-eagled from the palms and wiggled them
clown-fashion.
He did it so quickly, so slickly (he must have prac
ticed for hours in front of a White House mirror), that
by the time the laughter at the Sheraton Washington
Hotel ballroom rose to a full roar, his hands were Back
on the podium and he was simply standing there with
a satisfied grin.
Tuxedoed photographers, at their own party but
some still wise enough have the tools of their trade
with them, clumped in front of Reagan with cameras
poised. "Do it again," they urged. But too late.
U.N. speaks to Central America
The U.N. Security Council unanimously called on
Latin nations to settle the conflict in Central America
among themselves rather than involving the United
States, as Nicaragua had wanted, and endorsed a
peace initiative by Mexico, Panama, Venezuela and
Colombia.
Despite the council's rejection of what Nicaragua
had originally asked for — a condemnation of U.S.
support for anti-Sandinista insurgents and a call for
U.S.-Nicaragua negotiations — Nicaraguan Foreign
Minister Miguel D'Escoto said after the vote on the
resolution that he hoped the United States would end
its "armed aggression" and enter peace talks with
Managua.
He also cited Nicaraguan fears triggered by Presi
dent Reagan's news conference statement Tuesday
that the United States does not give open, instead of
covert, support to the rebels fighting to topple
Nicaragua's leftist government because "we want to
keep on obeying the laws of our country."
U.S. representative Charles Lichenstein, replacing
the absent Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick at yester
day's council session, responded, "The foreign min
ister of Nicaragua tests our patience, our tolerance
and, indeed, our sense of reality."
Stocks show loss
The stock market, hit by a late wave of selling for the
second straight session, posted a broad loss yesterday
that sent the Dow Jones industrial average to its first
close below 1200 in more than three weeks.
Analysts said rising interest rates in the credit mar
kets were one important force behind stocks' decline.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 12.19 to
1191.37, its lowest close since it stood at 1187.21 on
April 25. The average has dropped back more than 41
points from the record closing high of 1232.59 it
reached on May 6.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled
83.26 million shares, against 99.78 million in the pre
vious session.
Today's weather
Fair and warm through Saturday with some late
night and morning low clouds along the coast. Lows
in the 40s and 50s.
