## Doctor tells of cruelty to El Salvadoran people 
### GLENN BAKER Staff writer 
In a speech laden with criticism of
American support of a "right-wing"
El Salvador government, )im
Mittleberger called "the certification
of human rights obscene and absurd.
The only thing different now as com
pared to 1980 is that all those who
spoke up then have been killed off."
In a speech before about 50 people
last night at the Stanford Medical
School, Mittleberger discussed the
sights he had observed as a member
of the January 1983 American Public
Health Association Delegation which
ventured to El Salvador to investigate
the disappearance of health workers
and abuses of medical neutrality.
"Numerous stories were told to us
from people who had seen doctors
shot down while over the operating
tableand peasants killed orabducted
while standing in line waiting to re
ceive medical attention,"
Mittleberger said.

The government, he said, believes
that doctors who give aid to the poor
are either communists or guerillas.
The delegation had a meeting with
some 30 of these exiled physicians,
"the most talented, compassionate
doctors in the country,"
Mittleberger said. "They are just the
type of doctors that should be pro
tected."
Mittleberger, a recent graduate of
the UC-San Diego Medical School,
was on the delegation with six other
U.S. health professionals with
different political leanings. The de
legation came out with a report lam
basting U.S. policies in El Salvador
and asking tor a (horough tnvesViga

tion of the situation.
"The first thing that leaps out at
you is the poverty. Over 80 percent
of the children population is malnut
ritioned while almost all the popula
tion lives in extreme poverty. The
constant discontent arises out of this
poverty," Mittleberger said.
Mittleberger also described
numerous incidents where gover
nment troops committed ghastly acts
of torture and killing. "A common
form of torture was to successively
cut off parts of the body, starting with
the arms, then to the feet, then cut
ting off the legs, and ending with a
severing of the head, which was then
hung up for other prisoners to ob
serve." Furthermore, he added,
political prisoners who could legally
be held for only 15 days were usually
never heard from again.
Mittleberger frequently com
mented on U.S. involvement in the
support of the "right-wing" Salvado
ran government. "The soldiers are
trained at our camps, use our guns,
and have the expertise of our lead
ers. There is no doubt that the U.S.
has a great deal of involvement in the
situation."
Furthermore, he said, "we just
can't trust American papers to give
an accurate description of what is
happening." Focusing on the 1982
elections, which had an extremely
high turn-out and were touted in
U.S. papers as a "triumph of free
elections," he noted, "how many
papers wrote that the peasants ID
cards would not be stamped if they
did not vote, or that the ballots were
numbered and it was an act of
treason to tear off the numbers?
The primary worry of the delega
tion was the government's refusal to
allow the peasant's medical neces
sities. As Mittleberger said, "They
felt that anyone who helped the
peasants were communists or gueril
las. This is also why they shot down
those who were receiving medicine;
they assumed that it was for the
guerillas."
Mittleberger ended on a personal
opinion on how the situation will
end. "I don't think the military solu
tion is the way. We've already put in
some $800 million into the cause of
fighting communism and we're not
any better off now than when we
started. The only ones who want a
military solution is the right wing; all
others are hoping for negotiations to
end tYie tight."
