# ASSU Recycling seeks more University funds
## 
### JERRY BALL 
The ASSU recycling project, which
was scheduled to be closed earlier
this year because it was losing
money, now seems to be on the way
to becoming a permanent and fis
cally viable project. According to
Margaret Fidler, assistant dean of
student affairs, there is "a very good
chance" that the University will soon
make a commitment to support the
project on a yearly basis.
Fidler said that William Massy, vice
president of Business and Finance,
has made a recommendation to the
president and provost that "strongly
supports" a University grant of
$16,000 per year with the goal of
keeping the project alive.
Fidler indicated that the University
has apparently changed its earlier
position that the recycling project
does not save the University any
money. Fidler said "The proposed
$16,000 grant is noi jn out and out
gift; it is a subsidy based on the cost
the University expects to save." She
added, "We'd prefer to give money
to ASSU Recycling instead of the gar
bage service."
In December the University
granted ASSU Recycling $10,000, but
officials refused to fund the project
on a long-term basis because they
felt that recycling did not save the
University any money in garbage col
lection. Dean of Student Affairs on

sabbatical lames Lyons said in De
cember, "Present capacity of Univer
sity trash hauling could absorb that
(garbage that recycling new collects)
without additional costs."
ASSU representatives argued that
although recycling might not de
crease garbage collection costs, it
certainly cuts the University's ex
penditures on dumping fees. "Our
computation is that we savethem be
tween $12,000 and $20,000, but we're
still waiting for their estimate," proj
ect manager Fred Beddall said.
He also said that ASSU Recycling
should save the University even
more money in the next few years
than it did this year.
Beddall said, "these expenditures
(for ordinary garbage disposal) are
going to be increasing over the next
several years."
At the same time, he said, the re
cyclable materials market "is re
covering some" and our efficiency is
getting better. He said, "Our reve
nue is up 30 percent, and our volume
is up 12 percent. We should even
break 900 tons."
ASSU funding for the project will
run out lune 10. According to Bob
Brody, 1982-83 financial manager, "It
by June 10 the University has not ar
ranged for next spring's funding,
then the recycling project will be
closed." Brody said he expects the
decision "bv the end of this month."
