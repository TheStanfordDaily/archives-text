# Students find fewer jobs at career planning center
## 
### RANDY BROBERG Staff writer 
Senior Allen Fox is majoring in mechanical en
gineering. He interviewed with 13 companies
through the Career Planningand Placement Cen
ter (CPPC) before he finally received a job offer.
Fox accepted a position with Ai√üesearch Man
ufacturing after interviewing with them three
times.
According to Chris Shinkman, director of the
CPPC, "We expected a down year and that is
pretty much what happened. The number of
employers has dropped off slightly. There were
around 500 companies coming to campus last
year, but it is down to 400-and-something this
year.
"We experienced cancellations. There were
employers who told us they had placed freezes
on hiring so they obviously would not be coming
to campuses to recruit."
Students with technical expertise may have a
better chance getting a job, Shinkman said. "It is
apparent that engineers and computer scientists

have an easier time of it. Last year about 350 of
the 500 firms recruiting were looking for
graduates with technical expertise."
But liberal arts graduates should not lose
hope, Shinkman insisted: "Opportunities are
still there. It is important to remember that a
Stanford liberal arts degree is different than a
liberal arts degree from a lesser known institu
tion."
Although Shinkman guessed roughly 50 per
cent of Stanford graduates go on to graduate and
professional schools, many Stanford students
who want jobs have not yet found them.
Senior Stephanie Brugler, a human biology
major, said she interviewed "a little" through the
CPPC, but she finally decided, "banking and re
tail is not what I really want to do."
Brugler said she "got fed up with the CPPC
routine" and has been going out on her own to
look for a job. She plans to work for Stanford
Sierra Camp this summer and to continue look
ing for a job in September.
is interested in hospital consultation and

administration, Brugler said. With some help
from the Alumni Contact Service, she was able to
get "a couple of specific interviews for specific
jobs," but she is still waiting for a firm offer.
Brugler expressed optimism, however, saying, "I
am sure there are jobs out there."
With the job market tight already, 26.6 million
16 to 24-year-olds will be entering the work force
this summer, according to recent Department of
Commerce figures. Of these, two-thirds are
looking for summer jobs and the remaining third
is looking for permanent employment.
Shinkman said it is not a safe assumption to say
that students will go on to graduate school when
the economy is bad. "Students are getting skep
tical of the advantages of graduate degrees.
"Student interest (in interviewing for jobs
through the CPPC) was high," he continued,
"but students tended to accept offers earlier.
Employers made less offers but got the same
number of acceptances. Students seemed to ac
cept offers earlier, in February, instead of hold
ing off until May."
