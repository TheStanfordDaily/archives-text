### PAM CLOYD REBECCA SPEER 
The virtues of free enterprise, personal motivation
and integrity were lauded at the second annual Con
ference on Entrepreneurship held Saturday at the
Graduate School of Business. Well-known business
leaders from around the country addressed a largely
blue blazer-clad audience of 1200 students, faculty
and community members, who paid up to $40 to
attend the day-long event.
High-technology dominated the 40 workshops and
exhibits, where successful entrepreneurs shared
their secrets on such topics as capital formation,
management and industry trends.
One of the five featured speakers, R.J. Simplot, a
pioneer in the frozen french fry industry who has
served as director of McDonald's, got the conference
off to a lively start with a tribute to free enterprise. His
speech, punctuated with laughterand a standing ova
tion, challenged all "to do the best to keep going in
the direction of free enterprise. . .
Cnmmenting on the citizens of socialist countries,
Simplot said, "They're all dependent — there's no
bait on the hook. . . . The individuals making jobs to
keep people busy — that's what built this country."
Concluding his speech, Simplot said, "I think we're
just getting started. We're capable of building a

Utopia for millions."
Sandra Kurtzig, founder of ASK Computer Systems,
stressed "believing in yourself" in describing how
she started her business in her living room.
"You really can make it . . . we were so poor we
couldn't even afford to start in a garage like Hewlett-
Packard," she said, referring to the small-scale be
ginnings of Stanford graduates William Hewlett and
David Packard's computer firm.
Kurtzig added that she would like to see a year-long
entrepreneurial course at Stanford, which would in
clude as a term project a workable business plan.
However, James Treybig, founder of Tandem
Computers, Inc., said he felt the school year would
be better spent learning traditional skills such as
management techniques. In addition, Ireybig stres
sed a need to find a balance between work and per
sonal life, emphasizing the need to stay healthy.
David Dixon, a New Orleans art dealer who
founded the United States Football League (USFL),
is enthused about his project's success. He said the
emergence of cable TV has opened up the sports
media market to the USFL, and the March to July
season avoids competition from fall and winter
sports.

SUNNY MONEY: Some of the 1200 participants in the second annual Conference on Entrepreneurship
browse through displays on entrepreneurial projects. The conference was held Saturday at the Graduate
School of Business.
Me a.so stressed the importance
of professional sports' public ob
ligation. I think there's a social
obligation that football has. . . .
They're really subsidized by the
public," he said.
In reference to the Oakland
Raiders' move to Anaheim, Dixon
noted that the city of Oakland
sold out their stadium 13 years in a
row and is now left with a costly
stadium and no team. "I happen
to think 'Raiders' owner) Al Davis
is one of the most progressive
men in sports, but I think that
situation is a disgrace," he said.
On the players' right to choose
a team, Dixon called the NFL
"callous towards human beings.
"We (the USFL) allow a player to
play close to home. The NFL has
becomp so powerful that they
think they've got a divine right to
send lohn I Iway to Baltimore.
(he\ think they have the world by
the tail. ! hey' 11 rethink that when
we teach them a lesson."
Dixon concluded his speech by
re-emphasi/ing high standards as
the key to success. We all look up
to the really fine people in this
world, he said. The businessman
who operates as impeccably as
he can" will succeed.
Nolan Bushnell, founder of
Atari and Pizza-Time Theater,
pointed out, however, "You can
not have the paralysis of perfec
tion. That way the companies be
come completely inert . . . you
must have a gutsy play."
He said he sees the creation of
wealth through venture capital as
"the best thing that's happened to

the world," enabling us to elimi
nate much poverty in our lifetime.
He envisions a "New Victorian
Era," in which robots will be
cheap and only human skills will
maintain a price.
"Ideas are bullshit, because the
American way is to copy. You
must beat the people in the mar
ket," Bushnell added later.
Outside the auditorium,
Bushnell defended the quality of
the pizza served at Pizza-Time
Theaters in response to com
ments from a small crowd.
University President Donald
Kennedy also addressed the
group. After praising the
student-run Stanford University
Center for Entrepreneurship as
"an exceptional success," he
spoke on the importance of busi
ness' obligation to public service.
"We need to devote extraordinary
talents to the less fortunate,"
Kennedy said.
Thaver Wendell, chair of the
Student Management Commit
tee, read a letter from President
Reagan to conclude the confer
ence. His message, supporting
the Center and"the tremendous
entrepreneurial energies of the
private sector," drew both hisses
and applause.
The Conference was put on by
the Center for Entrepreneurship,
which was formed in response to
a similar conference held here last
year. The Center's operations
began this fall, funded by three
$500 grants from the Deans of
Graduate Studies, Business and
Engineering. In addition to the
annual conference, the Center

runs an internship program which
matches Stanford students with
start-up firms.
Graduate students Bruce
lohnson and Mary Van Maren
served as co-chairmen of the en
tirely student-run conference.
The event generated an even
more exceptional response than
last year's, which drew about 500
people.
Eddie Poplawski, a Stanford
graduate who handled marketing
for the conference, said, "We had
more people calling than we had
phones. The key is the excited
people." He estimated that at
least 400 people had been turned
away.
Those attending the conference
included both executives and
students seeking practical advice
and inspiration. Michael Boone, a
successful student entrepreneur
who started his million-dollar

computer video corporation from
a University dorm room, said it
was a great opportunity to meet
other business leaders and stu
dents. He now plans to use the
Center's internship program, be
cause "students are too young to
know what they can't do. They
have a willingness to work, a fresh
approach that is 180 degrees
different from anyone else, in
cluding MBAs."
Ronald Maagdenburg, presi
dent of a Sunnyvale manufactur
ing firm, said the conference gave
him "fresh ideas."
"I like to use student opinions
— you just have to give them a
chance," he said. Maagdenburg
added that he plans to use the in
ternship program offered by the
Center: "I need new people and I
found them right here today. It's
wonderful."
