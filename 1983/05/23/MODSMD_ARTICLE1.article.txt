The virtues of free enterprise, personal motivation
and integrity were lauded at the second annual Con
ference on Entrepreneurship held Saturday at the
Graduate School of Business. Well-known business
leaders from around the country addressed a largely

and community members, who paid up to $40 to
attend the day-long event.

exhibits, where successful entrepreneurs shared
their secrets on such topics as capital formation,
management and industry trends.

pioneer in the frozen french fry industry who has
served as director of McDonald's, got the conference
off to a lively start with a tribute to free enterprise. His
speech, punctuated with laughterand a standing ova
tion, challenged all "to do the best to keep going in
the direction of free enterprise. . .
Cnmmenting on the citizens of socialist countries,
Simplot said, "They're all dependent — there's no
bait on the hook. . . . The individuals making jobs to
keep people busy — that's what built this country."
Concluding his speech, Simplot said, "I think we're
just getting started. We're capable of building a

Utopia for millions."
Sandra Kurtzig, founder of ASK Computer Systems,
stressed "believing in yourself" in describing how
she started her business in her living room.
"You really can make it . . . we were so poor we
couldn't even afford to start in a garage like Hewlett-
Packard," she said, referring to the small-scale be
ginnings of Stanford graduates William Hewlett and
David Packard's computer firm.
Kurtzig added that she would like to see a year-long
entrepreneurial course at Stanford, which would in
clude as a term project a workable business plan.

Computers, Inc., said he felt the school year would
be better spent learning traditional skills such as
management techniques. In addition, Ireybig stres
sed a need to find a balance between work and per
sonal life, emphasizing the need to stay healthy.
David Dixon, a New Orleans art dealer who
founded the United States Football League (USFL),
is enthused about his project's success. He said the
emergence of cable TV has opened up the sports
media market to the USFL, and the March to July
season avoids competition from fall and winter
sports.
