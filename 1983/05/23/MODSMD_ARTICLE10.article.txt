Two-hundred-and-forty
athletes and more than 450
volunteers were at De Guerre
Pool Saturday for the Special
Olympics Swim Meet. This was
the second consecutive year
that Stanford hosted and co
sponsored the games with the
Santa Clara County Special
Olympics Foundation.
The Special Olympics were
started about 14 years ago to
help each developmentally
disabled person "to become all
that he or she can be." The
games have grown from one
event with 50 athletes to seven
events and more than 1.5 mil
lion participants world-wide.
Each year the Special Olympics
are organized at the local, state
and regional levels with Stan
ford hosting the swimming
events for all of Santa Clara
County.
The athletes trained through
their schools, agencies and
Special Olympic, programs.
The National Committee stres
ses that because of the many
hours of training and hard
work necessary before each
event, each participant is in

most ways no different than
any other competitive athlete.
In the opening ceremonies,
Stanford swimmer kim Carlyle
and football player Mike Dot
terer encouraged the special
athletes to compete seriously
but to have a good time too. At
the end of the ceremonies all
the athletes stood up and re
peated the Special Olympic
motto, "Let me win, but it I
cannot win, let me be brave in
the attempt."
Steve Elig and a co-director
of the event, said, "Although
the games are competitive,
every athlete is a winnei and
receives a medal.
The planning committee has
been working since October,
mobilizing volunteers and rais
ing donations from dorms,
businesses and the commu
nity. Volunteers consisted
mostly of Stanford students
who helped as chaperones,
lane swimmers, timers and en
tertainers.
Throughout the day, artists,
clowns, magicians, the Kar
toonz, LSJUMB and the Dollies
provided entertainment. A

highlight of the day occurred
when most of the Band, Dol
lies, athletes and volunteers
ended up in the pool for a
good-natured splash to All
Right Now."
Many of the volunteers said
Ihey telt d r i if they had learned
and experienced as much as
the athletes. Micky Aleman, a
second-year volunteer, said
she was impressed by the ' teal
sense ot accomplishment felt
by each athlete. It was incredi
ble to have a special athlete
come up to you and say, 'I got
third place!', while he looked
at you in a wav that said, Please
be proud of me. "
"The neat thing about it was
that people would swim and
even if they lost they'd just get
excited that thev finished,"
said volunteer Dave Hale
"They were excited just to be
involved." Hale added that he
wanted to be involved next
year, saying 'i had a hell of a lot
of fun."
Carol lennings called this
year s Olympics "a tremen
dous success,, judging by the
looks on people's faces."
