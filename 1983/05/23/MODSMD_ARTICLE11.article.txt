## The 						Stanford Daily What's so secret? 
### 
Grades are an uneasy subject around here,
the more so because so much secrecy and mys
tique surrounds them. Unlike many univer
sities, Stanford does not compute GPAs or class
rankings for individual students.
It does, however, compile a statistical study of
grades given in each department. But this study
is only distributed to departmental chairs and
deans of major schools.
In a University devoted to the free flow of
information, such secrecy is worrying, all the
more so because many of those "in the know"
tell us that nothing is wrong with departmental
grading here. If this is true, why not let everyone
in on the big secret?
"Long-standing policy," says University Re
gistrar Sally Mahoney. But this "policy" should
end.
Stanford is as much a rumor-mill as any other
large institution, and grades are often the topic
of such scuttlebutt. But rumors are the easiest
way to distort, magnify and subvert any piece of
information, and the University has only
exacerbated the problem by shrouding the
whole grading system in mystery.
The University can and should end the sus
pense (and the rumors) now and reveal the
best-kept secret on campus. Its statistical survey
of departmental grading policy would answer
some of the most-asked questions on campus,

such as which departments, if any, have grade
inflation and which departments don't, and do
the engineering disciplines grade easier or har
der than the humanities or sciences.
These questions can now only be answered
by a combination of supposition, misinforma
tion and downright guessing . Students are un
sure if grade inflation exists here, or if it does, in
which departments. But rumors indicating that
it exists in certain departments lead to as much
harm as if it actually did.
If grade inflation exists, let the truth be told.
The artificial increasing of grades hurts both
students and teachers, and it is best nipped in
the bud. Other grading problems, such as col
lapsed curves that only recognize grades from A
to C and unarticulated grading policies, are
equally poor and deserve no place here.
However, there is no reason for cross
departmental norms in grading policy, just as
there is no need for cross-departmental norms
in teaching. Each department should set its own
grading policy, but students should be allowed
to see the results of this policy. Let students
base any grade decisions about a major or disci
pline on fact, not fiction.
For the sake of all concerned, the University
should letthe truth speak for itself and makethe
report public.
