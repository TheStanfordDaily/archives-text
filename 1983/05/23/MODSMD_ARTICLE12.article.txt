## Danger in Kennedy's amorality 
### 
I am a first year undergraduate en
rolled in the history track of the
Western Civilization program. I have
just returned from watching Triumph
of the Will, a Nazi propaganda film.
After watching scene after scene of
zombie-like Germans lifting their
hands in a gesture of support for the
National Socialist Party led by Adolf
Hitler, the point that History Prof.
James Sheehan made this morning in
lecture hit me with great force. These
people had lost all ability to make
moral judgments for themselves.
Whatever goals Hitler presented as
Germany's became theirs. Even the
people who did not go to the Nazi
rallies but who continued to work in
their niche of society's order without
any concern for the broad picture
were working towards Hitler's goals.
Sheehan's examples of train conduc
tors driving their trains just as they
had always done and of office work
ers continuing to process paperwork
just as they had always done clearly
show cases of simple, seemingly un
related tasks which ended up making
Hitler's murderous system of depor
tation of undesirables to concentra
tion camps operate so efficiently.
My point of bringing the Nazi
dominated society of the 1930s and
1940s to the attention of the Stanford
community of 1983 is only to show

the connection that I see between
the Holocaust ot World War II and
the direction in which we are being
led by the decision of President
Donald Kennedy to support the nu
clear weapons research at Stanford's
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
(SSRL). The U.S. Defense Depart
ment is making use of the estab
lished order for carrying on highly
sophisticated nuclear research. It

workers in order to further its

knowledge of X-ray pumped laser
weaponry. In accordance with
Reagan's "Star Wars" scenario, the
Defense Department hopes to gain
technical advantages over the Soviet
Union so that it can effectively deter
any missiles from reaching the U.S.,
and thus have more freedom to
negotiate disarmament less seri
ously. Meanwhile, the arms race
continues at full throttle with each
side trying to achieve "parity" with
the other, and with neither side re

ally knowing what parity means since
both already have many times as
much megatonnage as would be
needed to kill the entire population
of its rival.
I sympathize with Kennedy's con
cern that once a research proposal is
turned down on moral grounds there
is no way of preserving academic
freedom. On the other hand, it is
impossible for me to keep from mak
ing the connection between Ken
nedy's willingness to comply with
the Defense Department's plan to do
nuclear research here and the train
conductor's and office worker's
compliance to their superiors who
were knowingly helpingthe Nazis. In
no other way do I make connections
between Nazi Germany and Stanford
University. But by refusing to oppose
the research proposal, Kennedy is
becoming just another link in the
chain toward the Pentagon's aims of
continuing the arms race with little
concern for the future of the planet.
In order for disarmament to become
a reality, the machinery of continued
armament must be disrupted. Ken
nedy has a chance to make such a
disruption and has chosen not to
take it instead he chooses to be just
another amoral link in the chain.
