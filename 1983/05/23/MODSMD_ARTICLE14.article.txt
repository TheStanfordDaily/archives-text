# Rumblings and ramblings

### 
As the school year ends, I'm cracking under the strain,
lust a little, you understand, says the mad giggler as he
brushes his tongue absent-mindedly. I know that none
of you really want rigorous logic and close analysis this
week—you have your own problems. Anyway, I'm re
serving all my answers for examination questions. So
this week, faithful readers, my thoughts are organized
into questions. Not too well-organized, either, but I
don't notice all of you clamoring to fill the editorial page.
Practice charity and read on.
About studying. Is everyone studying economics
these days or only me? I guess everyone isn't, since
someone must be pushing up the load on the computer
system, checking the books I want out of the library and
relaxing in the sun to taunt me. How can a person carry
on a social life and study simultaneously? Or, how can a
person study and even meet anyone else? Somehow,
people in the library always look willing to talk but no
one ever says anything.
About world affairs. Now that Israel has signed a treaty
with Lebanon, will the United Nations and public opin
ion do anything to force Syria out of the Lebanese terri
tory it has occupied since 1976? Will anyone blame the
Soviet Union for Syria, the way the United States is
blamed for Israel? Why does the American government
spend money and manpower spying on the Soviet Union
for violations of arms control treaties and then refuse to
announce anything they find out because it might harm
arms control negotiations? Does Yuri Andropov listen to
reggae or the Stones? Who are "the people" in Central
American countries and why do they tell different
people all these different things about what they really
think and feel? Do Americans want to live like the
Japanese or do they just want the economic benefits
without the rest of the culture?
About tanning. Is tanning an inborn gift or the result of
hard work? Is there anyone else besides me who can
wander around in the sun for hours without even getting
a respectable burn? Can native Minnesotans tan in the
summer and is this my problem? (I know; my problems
run deeper.) Are the incredible tans I see around cam
pus accumulated from years of past sunbathing (per
fectly acceptable), the result of winter ski trips (gauche,
but understandable) or an instantaneous reaction to a
week of sun (totally revolting and unthinkable)?
About domestic affairs. If the economy booms in 1984

without inflation, will anyone give Reagan any credit?
Can any human being be as foolish as lames Watt seems
to be and not know it? (Leave me out of it.) How many of
the people who worry about nuclear power and acid rain
smoke cigarettes and drink Coca-Cola? Why does taxing
rich people remove incentives to work but taxing the
poor people (by tightening welfare requirements) is
supposed to increase incentives to work? Is anyone even
mildly excited about any of the Democratic presidential
candidates?
About sleeping. This may not be an absorbing topic to
all of you but it's my column so I get to flaunt my obses
sions. If relevance were a test for existence, I wouldn't
be here. Anyway, why do I keep sleeping more and
needing more sleep? If I slept less, would I need less
sleep? If I didn't sleep at all, how long before I crack up?
Can I learn to sleep and ride a bicycle? I can't ride a
bicycleandchewgum but sleeping comes moreeasilyto
me.
About Stanford. Are lines longer at the post office
here than at other post offices? If we decide that we
don't want the Hoover Institution, what will we do with
it? Was anyone excited about any of the ASSU Senate
candidates? Is anyone excited about them now? Why are
admissions directors the most popular people in any
school administration? (Because they said "yes" to
everyone here?) Has anyone noticed that campuses
have a big controversy every spring? The good weather
makes everyone feisty, and all the students want to fight
over something and then leave for home.
On paleontology, ethics and all other subjects. Is vol
leyball a metaphor for life or vice versa? Where would
you like the Dish to end up if it floats down the foothills
in a mudslide? How does John Elway attend Stanford and
the Denver Broncos rookie camp simultaneously? Why
is my bicycle falling apart? I know these questions are
trivial but at least they're not about economics. Be grate
ful for small favors.
I don't claim to be original in any of this but I would
like to be unique. And eclectic, because I like the sound
of the word. Eschew and übquitous are nice words too.
And platitudinous makes me think of platypuses, which
seems like a good thing. Happy spring, everyone. Close
out the year in style.
