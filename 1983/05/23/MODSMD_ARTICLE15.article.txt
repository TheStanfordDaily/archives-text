## Teaching just as important as research ability 
### 
University President Donald Kennedy's recent
policy proposal to make research ability a more
important factor than teaching ability in tenure
decisions has been met with silence from the
faculty and the undergraduate population. This
is highly disconcerting considering the potential
impact such statements have on the future of
undergraduate teaching and learning at Stan
ford.
The proposal appears in Kennedy's recent
Statement of University Mission and, simply put,
places research ability above teaching ability in
promotion and tenure decisions. The earlier
criteria fortenure required that a faculty member
be "truly superior in scholarship or teaching and
at least very good in the other." Elaborating on
Kennedy's proposal, Norman Wessells, dean of
Humanities and Sciences, in his speech to the
faculty senate said that "those criteria are no
longer adequate." Stanford is now "an elite re
search institution," and so it must apparently
emphasize scholarship before students in order
to maintain that position. The justification for
making research the primary factor and teaching
secondary is that "the two are inseparable."
While it may be true that in order to be a good
teacher, a professor must also be a good re
searcher, any undergraduate knows that the re
verse is not always true. Some of the worst
teachers are the ones best known for schol
arship.
Such a policy raises several serious questions.
Is Stanford primarily a research institution and
are the students merely "window dressing"?
Should teaching ability therefore be secondary
in importance to research ability among profes
sors? Should the students be content to be
taught by first-rate researchers who have no in
centive whatsoever to be first-rate teachers? And
can we justify paying $10,000 a year to watch
these people research? These questions, and
others in the same vein, should and must be
answered by the students, the faculty and the
administration if quality teaching is to be pre
served at Stanford.

GPB and science
I was dismayed by Lyn Bowman's proposal
("Two CPBs are better than one," Daily, May 16)
that the Guest Professorship Board be split up
into a humanities-oriented GPB and a sciences
oriented GPB. The purpose of the GPB should be
to bring new ideas and attitudes from outside the
University community that would stimulate
those of us working here.

Given limited resources, it seems to me that it
would be most productive to bring in new ideas
and means of education — not necessarily radi
cal in political stance but new approaches to
academic study that would be worth drawing
into an already diverse University environment.
What I fear about Bowman's suggestion is that
some of the most invigorating bodies of
academic thought lie not solely within the
humanities or sciences but in the interstice be
tween these areas. Proposals which "begin by
classifying all academic departments according
to . . . the humanities-oriented and the scientifi
cally oriented" only further this schism.
While his proposal applies only to the GPB,
the spirit of the letter has important implications
towards academic inquiry in general, specifically
towards the fragmentation of modern thought.
Some of today's most pressing issues clearly
elucidate the dangers of such segmented study.
The proliferation of nuclear weapons or chemi
cal wastes show us the horrors of technological
advance taken without regard to the interests of
the society for which it was designed. The abun
dance of confusing legislation hindering scien
tific inquiry in industry and the lack of an en
vironmentally sound energy policy both illus
trate the problems of the humanities when
studied without regard to the scientific context in
which they may be applied.
As a scientist, I think Bowman's point to bring
more scientific thinkers to Stanford is well taken.
As a humanist, however, I strongly resent her
blatant stereotypes ("students in the sciences and
engineering neither run for political office nor
vote"). Such institutionalized intellectual bar
riers are indicative of a society which generates
so many people interested only in their part of
the overall picture, and we continually find our
selves less and less equipped to manage our own
world.
In fact, I see little difference between Bow
man's strong distaste for humanities students
who ignore scientific inquiry, and the scientists
who ignore the society in which their work reve
als its consequences.
Scientists who study only science certainly
may make better scientists, but I doubt that they
make better citizens. It has taken me a great deal
of energy (wasted, from a scientific standpoint)
not only to exert myself within the scientific
community but also to understand the society in
which that work fits in. This has been vital to my
understanding of the world about me and has
made me a better human being.
Breaking out of a "two culture" University al
lows us a broader world view, while examining
the interactions of technology and society can

lend a greater coherence to this view, yet the
importance of this fuller and more coherent
education extends far beyond distribution re
quirements and western culture programs. All
resources as potentially fruitful as the GPB
should not spend half their time in the sciences
and half in the humanities but should instead
examine the ways in which these cultures inter
act to shape our world.

SLAC Accelepede
Although the Campus Report ran a front page
picture of our SLAC Accelepede, which won the
prize for best Bay to Breakers centipede cos
tume, I note that the Daily has not mentioned our
feat. This leads me to suspect that you have not
heard about the exciting, supportive rally-round
that the incomparable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (LSJUMB) gave us at
the Hyatt Regency on Saturday night.
Packed onto, into and above the Plaza outside
the Hyatt Regency were all invited costume parti
cipants for Bay to Breakers. This was a televised
party, with celebrities from San Francisco's vari
ous walks of life as well as television and sports
personalities.
Our major maneuver was to snake our 33-
person, bright red accelepede in among the dra
gons, Atari game centipedes, playboy bunnies,
trans-am buildings and "ladies of the night," not
to mention the hazards we encountered from the
sheer size and weight of Cal's Bay Bridge, but we
did it. As we arrived, the Band bounded to our
side(s) and with Dollies prancing and the tree
gyrating and all of them shouting our praises,
they played "Come )oin the Band" as though this
were as important as a Big Game rally.
The LSIUMB's support was greatly appreciated
by us all and I'm sure that they helped us win the
prize. It was pretty exciting being up there on the
stage with all that spontaneity going for us. We
noted that the Bay Bridge disappeared fast!
And to top it all off, the next day, when we
finished the race at an hour and 49 minutes, there
was the Band, still waiting for us and again hailing
us with "Come join the Band" at the finish line!
The Band has had some adverse criticism in the
past and I'd like to say that I think the LSJUMB is
truly incomparable, wonderful, thrilling and just
plain marvelous! 33 members of the SLAC Ac
celepede love them madly!

may make better scientists, but I doubt that they
make better citizens. It has taken me a great deal
of energy (wasted, from a scientific standpoint)
not only to exert myself within the scientific
community but also to understand the society in
which that work fits in. This has been vital to my
understanding of the world about me and has
made me a better human being.
Breaking out of a "two culture" University al
lows us a broader world view, while examining
the interactions of technology and society can

lend a greater coherence to this view, yet the
importance of this fuller and more coherent
education extends far beyond distribution re
quirements and western culture programs. All
resources as potentially fruitful as the GPB
should not spend half their time in the sciences
and half in the humanities but should instead
examine the ways in which these cultures inter
act to shape our world.

SLAC Accelepede
Although the Campus Report ran a front page
picture of our SLAC Accelepede, which won the
prize for best Bay to Breakers centipede cos
tume, I note that the Daily has not mentioned our
feat. This leads me to suspect that you have not
heard about the exciting, supportive rally-round
that the incomparable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (LSJUMB) gave us at
the Hyatt Regency on Saturday night.
Packed onto, into and above the Plaza outside
the Hyatt Regency were all invited costume parti
cipants for Bay to Breakers. This was a televised
party, with celebrities from San Francisco's vari
ous walks of life as well as television and sports
personalities.
Our major maneuver was to snake our 33-
person, bright red accelepede in among the dra
gons, Atari game centipedes, playboy bunnies,
trans-am buildings and "ladies of the night," not
to mention the hazards we encountered from the
sheer size and weight of Cal's Bay Bridge, but we
did it. As we arrived, the Band bounded to our
side(s) and with Dollies prancing and the tree
gyrating and all of them shouting our praises,
they played "Come )oin the Band" as though this
were as important as a Big Game rally.
The LSIUMB's support was greatly appreciated
by us all and I'm sure that they helped us win the
prize. It was pretty exciting being up there on the
stage with all that spontaneity going for us. We
noted that the Bay Bridge disappeared fast!
And to top it all off, the next day, when we
finished the race at an hour and 49 minutes, there
was the Band, still waiting for us and again hailing
us with "Come join the Band" at the finish line!
The Band has had some adverse criticism in the
past and I'd like to say that I think the LSJUMB is
truly incomparable, wonderful, thrilling and just
plain marvelous! 33 members of the SLAC Ac
celepede love them madly!

University President Donald Kennedy's recent
policy proposal to make research ability a more
important factor than teaching ability in tenure
decisions has been met with silence from the
faculty and the undergraduate population. This
is highly disconcerting considering the potential
impact such statements have on the future of
undergraduate teaching and learning at Stan
ford.
The proposal appears in Kennedy's recent
Statement of University Mission and, simply put,
places research ability above teaching ability in
promotion and tenure decisions. The earlier
criteria fortenure required that a faculty member
be "truly superior in scholarship or teaching and
at least very good in the other." Elaborating on
Kennedy's proposal, Norman Wessells, dean of
Humanities and Sciences, in his speech to the
faculty senate said that "those criteria are no
longer adequate." Stanford is now "an elite re
search institution," and so it must apparently
emphasize scholarship before students in order
to maintain that position. The justification for
making research the primary factor and teaching
secondary is that "the two are inseparable."
While it may be true that in order to be a good
teacher, a professor must also be a good re
searcher, any undergraduate knows that the re
verse is not always true. Some of the worst
teachers are the ones best known for schol
arship.
Such a policy raises several serious questions.
Is Stanford primarily a research institution and
are the students merely "window dressing"?
Should teaching ability therefore be secondary
in importance to research ability among profes
sors? Should the students be content to be
taught by first-rate researchers who have no in
centive whatsoever to be first-rate teachers? And
can we justify paying $10,000 a year to watch
these people research? These questions, and
others in the same vein, should and must be
answered by the students, the faculty and the
administration if quality teaching is to be pre
served at Stanford.

GPB and science
I was dismayed by Lyn Bowman's proposal
("Two CPBs are better than one," Daily, May 16)
that the Guest Professorship Board be split up
into a humanities-oriented GPB and a sciences
oriented GPB. The purpose of the GPB should be
to bring new ideas and attitudes from outside the
University community that would stimulate
those of us working here.

Given limited resources, it seems to me that it
would be most productive to bring in new ideas
and means of education — not necessarily radi
cal in political stance but new approaches to
academic study that would be worth drawing
into an already diverse University environment.
What I fear about Bowman's suggestion is that
some of the most invigorating bodies of
academic thought lie not solely within the
humanities or sciences but in the interstice be
tween these areas. Proposals which "begin by
classifying all academic departments according
to . . . the humanities-oriented and the scientifi
cally oriented" only further this schism.
While his proposal applies only to the GPB,
the spirit of the letter has important implications
towards academic inquiry in general, specifically
towards the fragmentation of modern thought.
Some of today's most pressing issues clearly
elucidate the dangers of such segmented study.
The proliferation of nuclear weapons or chemi
cal wastes show us the horrors of technological
advance taken without regard to the interests of
the society for which it was designed. The abun
dance of confusing legislation hindering scien
tific inquiry in industry and the lack of an en
vironmentally sound energy policy both illus
trate the problems of the humanities when
studied without regard to the scientific context in
which they may be applied.
As a scientist, I think Bowman's point to bring
more scientific thinkers to Stanford is well taken.
As a humanist, however, I strongly resent her
blatant stereotypes ("students in the sciences and
engineering neither run for political office nor
vote"). Such institutionalized intellectual bar
riers are indicative of a society which generates
so many people interested only in their part of
the overall picture, and we continually find our
selves less and less equipped to manage our own
world.
In fact, I see little difference between Bow
man's strong distaste for humanities students
who ignore scientific inquiry, and the scientists
who ignore the society in which their work reve
als its consequences.
Scientists who study only science certainly
may make better scientists, but I doubt that they
make better citizens. It has taken me a great deal
