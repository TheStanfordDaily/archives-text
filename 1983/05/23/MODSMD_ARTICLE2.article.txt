# Faculty, students discuss article on Law School
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
Faculty and students at the Law School had mixed
reactions to a lengthy article in yesterday's New York
Times Magazine that raised questions about the school's
teaching method, curriculum and emphasis on career
placement.
The article came in the wake of a well-publicized in
dictment of law schools by Harvard University President
Derek Bok, who said the schools train students "more
for conflict than for the gentler arts of reconciliation and
accommodation." Many critics of the Law School said
the article helped bring to light many problems that go
unaddressed.
Commenting on the school, David Lempert, a third
year student in business and law here, said, "It's creating
a professional mind set. It's creating people who can sit
behind a desk, follow orders, support the status quo and

earn a lot of money."
The article, written by an alumnus of the Law School,
David Margolick, pointed out problems with the
school's use of the "case method," a way of teaching
that emphasizes student review of appellate-court deci
sions. In the article, Margolick claimed that "class atten
dance, participation and interest are down" and thai
"for many students, law school has become more a
conduit to lucrative positions in large law firms than an
opportunity to ponder the larger questions about law
and justice."
But the article also pointed out that the Law School has
in "recent years . . . broken into the almost impenetra
ble inner circle of leading American law schools." It also
commends "Curriculum B," an alternative course
schedule for first-year students, and speaks favorably of
the school's emphasis on non-case book programs. The
article concludes that the school's
method "works."
The article quotes Jim Steyer, a
third-year student at the Law School:
"You have courses where on an av
erage day 30 percent of the enrolled
students show up." Although Steyer
said he was quoted out of context
and that most courses have atten
dance levels higher than that, Paul
Cassell, the president of theStanford
Law Review, estimated that the aver
age attendance for upper-level
courses at the school is 60 percent.

"It's easy for you to not go to
school most of the term and show up
for the exams and pass them," Cas
sell said.
Steyer said, however, the t courses
such as Curriculum B "reflect the fact
that Stanford is a progressive
thinking law school." The Law
School's attempts to provide such
clinical courses as the East Palo Alto
Community Law Project, which will
give students "real legal skills" by al
lowing them to represent people in
the community, are also positive as
pects of the school, he added.
But Lempert, who once sent a 22-
page letter to Law School Dean john
Ely pointing out what he thought
were many of the school's problems,

remains an unrelenting critic of the
school.
He called the case method "intel
lectually bankrupt," saying that the
school is "not skill-oriented — it's
book-oriented."
The school should provide more
courses teaching other skills, Lem
pert said, so that students will be able
to present themselves better orally
and will understand fully the tactics
and psychology of the trial system.
Out of last year's Law School class
of 171 people, two went into public
interest law, according to Lempert.
The rest work in private law firms, he
said.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg dis
puted these figures and said about 80
percent of the class went into private
law firms.
"There aren't a great number of
public interest jobs available,"
Weisberg said.

The school should provide more
courses teaching other skills, Lem
pert said, so that students will be able
to present themselves better orally
and will understand fully the tactics
and psychology of the trial system.
Out of last year's Law School class
of 171 people, two went into public
interest law, according to Lempert.
The rest work in private law firms, he
said.
Law Prof. Robert Weisberg dis
puted these figures and said about 80
percent of the class went into private
law firms.
"There aren't a great number of
public interest jobs available,"
Weisberg said.
