## Burgin-Gates beaten in final 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Albuquerque, N.M. —
The Stanford team of Elise
Burgin and Linda Gates
lived up to its seeding yes
terday in the doubles finals
of the NCAA Women's Te
nnis Championships here.
The only problem was, so
did its opponents — Trini
ty's Louise Allen and
Gretchen Rush.
Burgin and Gates entered
the 32-team doubles tour
nament seeded second. Al
len and Rush, however,
were seeded first and dealt
the Cardinal duo only its
third defeat of the season,
6-2, 6-4.
Burgin and Gates were
the only Stanford netters to
get past the quarterfinals in
either the singles or doubles
tournaments, which fol
lowed the conclusion of the
NCAA team competition
last Tuesday.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles
team, which had compiled a
16-2 record before yester
day's loss, never got rolling
in the match for the NCAA
doubles crown.

Burgin and Gates never
broke Allen's or Rush's
serve in either set. In fact, so
dominant were the Trinity
pair that they outscored
their Stanford opponents
36-8 when serving. In the
first set, Burgin and Gates
won only two of 18 points
when Allen or Rush was
serving.
"We served really well
and got some key returns
when we needed them," Al
len said.
"They (Burgin and Gates)
are both big hitters. I don't
think they played as well as
they could have."
The first set was marred by
controversy after Burgin
persistently argued a few
questionable calls by the
umpire and the linesmen.
One call in particular — a
Burgin drop shot that Allen
evidently hit back before
the ball bounced twice —
seemed to turn the match in
Trinity's favor. The call gave
Allen and Rush a service
break and caused a five
minute argument from the
Stanford corps.

"I think it was a turning
point in a way," Gates saia.
"We knew we weren't
playing well enough to ov
ercome that (a controversial
call) so any momentum we
had before that slowed
down."
After the controversial
service break in the first set's
fifth game, Allen and Rush
breezed through the next
three games to clinch the
set.
The match pitted Gates
and her former doubles
partner in the junior ranks,
Rush, with whom she won
the National Junior doubles
title two years ago in Mid
dlebury, Conn.
Burgin and Gates de
feated UCLA's team of An
drea Kriva and Heather
Ludloff 6-1,6-7 (7-2), 6-3 and
then the San Diego State
pair of Cindy MacGregor
and Micki Schillig 6-4, 6-3 in
the semi-finals.
While the No. 2 seeded
Burgin and Gates reached
the doubles finals, Burgin —
Stanford's other No. 2 seed
— did not in the singles.
Burgin was knocked out
of the 64-player singles
tournament in Friday's
quarterfinals by UCLA's
Ludloff in straight sets 6-4,
6-3. USC's Beth Herr, the
No. 3 seed, held off two
match points in a third set
tie-breaker to defeat
Clemson's unseeded Gigi
Fernandez, a native Puerto
Rican, in the singles final
3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6).
Although Burgin's loss to
eighth-seeded Ludloff was
an upset on paper, it was not
on the courts. The Bruin
senior from Foster City has
been Burgin's nemesis all
season, beating Burgin in
three of their four matches
this year.
Dictating the style of play
with her aggressive net
game, Ludloff broke
Burgin's serve in the 10th

game to win the first set —
one interrupted by an hour
and 50-minute rain delay.
In the second set, Ludloff
broke open a 3-3 tie with a
three-game string that
locked up the set and the
match.
"I think my aggressive
style of play and my volleys
were the key," Ludloff said.
Stanford coach Frank
Brennan analyzed the
match in a similar fashion. "I
think, number one, Ludloff
played very, very well;
number two, Elise (Burgin)
played very, very tentative
ly; and number three, we
didn't get any breaks."
Also on Friday, senior
team captain Caryn
Copeland, who had
stunned sixth-seeded Cindy
MacGregor from San Diego
State Thursday, ended her
college singles career with a
loss to Oklahoma State's
Lori McNeil, 6-4, 6-7 (7-4),
6-1.
Copeland's doubles ca
reer came to a close later
that afternoon. She and jun
ior Michelle Weiss were un
able to pull out their round
of-16 match against singles
finalist Fernandez and Jane
Foreman from Clemson 6-1,
4-6, 7-6 (7-1).
After splitting the first two
sets, Copeland and Weiss
found themselves quickly
behind 5-1 in the third. The
Stanford duo roared back,
fighting off a match point in
the 10th game, and forced a
12-point tiebreaker. But the
pair had nothing left and
loss the match-deciding
breaker 7-1.
Burgin, Gates and
Copeland all became Ail-
Americans in the individual
tournaments. Had
Copeland and Weiss pre
vailed against Fernandez
and Foreman, Weiss would
have become Stanford's
fourth All-American.

three games to clinch the
set.
The match pitted Gates
and her former doubles
partner in the junior ranks,
Rush, with whom she won
the National Junior doubles
title two years ago in Mid
dlebury, Conn.
Burgin and Gates de
feated UCLA's team of An
drea Kriva and Heather
Ludloff 6-1,6-7 (7-2), 6-3 and
then the San Diego State
pair of Cindy MacGregor
and Micki Schillig 6-4, 6-3 in
the semi-finals.
While the No. 2 seeded
Burgin and Gates reached
the doubles finals, Burgin —
Stanford's other No. 2 seed
— did not in the singles.
Burgin was knocked out
of the 64-player singles
tournament in Friday's
quarterfinals by UCLA's
Ludloff in straight sets 6-4,
6-3. USC's Beth Herr, the
No. 3 seed, held off two
match points in a third set
tie-breaker to defeat
Clemson's unseeded Gigi
Fernandez, a native Puerto
Rican, in the singles final
3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6).
Although Burgin's loss to
eighth-seeded Ludloff was
an upset on paper, it was not
on the courts. The Bruin
senior from Foster City has
been Burgin's nemesis all
season, beating Burgin in
three of their four matches
this year.
Dictating the style of play
with her aggressive net
game, Ludloff broke
Burgin's serve in the 10th

game to win the first set —
one interrupted by an hour
and 50-minute rain delay.
In the second set, Ludloff
broke open a 3-3 tie with a
three-game string that
locked up the set and the
match.
"I think my aggressive
style of play and my volleys
were the key," Ludloff said.
Stanford coach Frank
Brennan analyzed the
match in a similar fashion. "I
think, number one, Ludloff
played very, very well;
number two, Elise (Burgin)
played very, very tentative
ly; and number three, we
didn't get any breaks."
Also on Friday, senior
team captain Caryn
Copeland, who had
stunned sixth-seeded Cindy
MacGregor from San Diego
State Thursday, ended her
college singles career with a
loss to Oklahoma State's
Lori McNeil, 6-4, 6-7 (7-4),
6-1.
Copeland's doubles ca
reer came to a close later
that afternoon. She and jun
ior Michelle Weiss were un
able to pull out their round
of-16 match against singles
finalist Fernandez and Jane
Foreman from Clemson 6-1,
4-6, 7-6 (7-1).
After splitting the first two
sets, Copeland and Weiss
found themselves quickly
behind 5-1 in the third. The
Stanford duo roared back,
fighting off a match point in
the 10th game, and forced a
12-point tiebreaker. But the
pair had nothing left and
loss the match-deciding
breaker 7-1.
Burgin, Gates and
Copeland all became Ail-
Americans in the individual
tournaments. Had
Copeland and Weiss pre
vailed against Fernandez
and Foreman, Weiss would
have become Stanford's
fourth All-American.

Albuquerque, N.M. —
The Stanford team of Elise
Burgin and Linda Gates
lived up to its seeding yes
terday in the doubles finals
of the NCAA Women's Te
nnis Championships here.
The only problem was, so
did its opponents — Trini
ty's Louise Allen and
Gretchen Rush.
Burgin and Gates entered
the 32-team doubles tour
nament seeded second. Al
len and Rush, however,
were seeded first and dealt
the Cardinal duo only its
third defeat of the season,
6-2, 6-4.
Burgin and Gates were
the only Stanford netters to
get past the quarterfinals in
either the singles or doubles
tournaments, which fol
lowed the conclusion of the
NCAA team competition
last Tuesday.
Stanford's No. 1 doubles
team, which had compiled a
16-2 record before yester
day's loss, never got rolling
in the match for the NCAA
doubles crown.

Burgin and Gates never
broke Allen's or Rush's
serve in either set. In fact, so
dominant were the Trinity
pair that they outscored
their Stanford opponents
36-8 when serving. In the
first set, Burgin and Gates
won only two of 18 points
when Allen or Rush was
serving.
"We served really well
and got some key returns
when we needed them," Al
len said.
"They (Burgin and Gates)
are both big hitters. I don't
think they played as well as
they could have."
The first set was marred by
controversy after Burgin
persistently argued a few
questionable calls by the
umpire and the linesmen.
One call in particular — a
Burgin drop shot that Allen
evidently hit back before
the ball bounced twice —
seemed to turn the match in
Trinity's favor. The call gave
Allen and Rush a service
break and caused a five
minute argument from the
Stanford corps.

"I think it was a turning
point in a way," Gates saia.
"We knew we weren't
playing well enough to ov
ercome that (a controversial
call) so any momentum we
had before that slowed
down."
After the controversial
service break in the first set's
fifth game, Allen and Rush
breezed through the next
three games to clinch the
set.
The match pitted Gates
and her former doubles
partner in the junior ranks,
Rush, with whom she won
