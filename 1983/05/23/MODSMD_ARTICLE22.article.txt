# Men falter in individuals

### TOM MOORE 
lust three days after climax
ing a Cinderella season with a
convincing win over Southern
Methodist University in the
team championships, the Stan
ford men's tennis team mem
bers quietly bowed out of the
individual's competition. After
eight singles players lost in the
second round Thursday, the

doubles competition was the
only chance the Card had to
take an individual title. Unfor
tunately, Stanford's third
seeded Scott Davis and lohn
Letts were upset in the first
round of doubles play. Michi
gan's Tom Haney-Mark Meese
duo squelched the Card's top
doubles pair in straight sets
6-4, 7-5.

Mark McKeen and |im Grabb
outlasted Miami's Craig
Campbell and Ira Schwartz in
the opening match, 6-7, 6-4,
6-4. They were not so success
ful in their second round con
test, though. Failing to
capitalize on a tense first set
victory, the Card pair fell to
Pepperdine's Rich Gallian and
Kelly Jones 5-7. 6-4, 6-3.
