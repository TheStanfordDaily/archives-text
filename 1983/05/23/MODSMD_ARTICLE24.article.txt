Philly wins game one
Philadelphia — The Philadelphia 76ers won
the opener of the National Basketball As
sociation championship series, scoring a
113-107 victory over the weary Los Angeles
Lakers yesterday, with both teams later com
plaining they could have played better.
"We were not as prepared as we wanted to
be," Lakers' guard Earvin "Magic" Johnson
said. "We flew all day Saturday and couldn't
focus on this game."
The Lakers, seeking to become the first
team in 14 years to repeat as NBA champions,
were playing their second game in less than
48 hours. They won the Western Conference
championship Friday night with a victory in
San Antonio.
Not everyone on the 76ers was satisfied
with their performance, either.
"We didn't really play up to our
capabilities," said center Moses Malone, who
led Philadelphia with 27 points. "We didn't
really play our game. If we get everything
down pat, we'll win again on Thursday."
Andrew Toney had 25 for Philadelphia,

which wore down Los Angeles in the second
half. The Lakers were shorthanded because
of an injury to Bob McAdoo and foul trouble,
they had to dig deep into the bench against
the 76ers after using just seven players in
some of their earlier playoff games.
The 76ers had best record in the league
during the regular season, thanks to the addi
tion of the 6-foot-10 Malone, who signed a
six-year $13.2 million contract. But they
trailed by three at halftime.
Then, with the Lakers leading 63-60, a 10-1
streak in which Maurice Cheeks and Julius
Erving scored four points piece, put the 76ers
ahead 70-64 with 7:29 left in the third quarter.
The Lakers, who had won the first road game
in their last nine playoff series since 1979, nev
er caught up again.
Sunny's Halo to rest
Baltimore — With no chance at winning
the Triple Crown after Sunny's Halo's sixth
place finish in the Preakness, trainer David
Cross said yesterday the colt's recurring rash
problem is his major concern.
RunninginthejuneH Belmont Stakes is all
but out of the question for the Kentucky
Derby winner, and that's just fine with Cross.
He didn't want to go to Belmont, but owner
David Foster had indicated he would over
rule Cross if the Triple Crown was at stake.
The prospect of getting an opportunity to
become the 12th Triple Crown winner in
thoroughbred history ended in Saturday's
Preakness as Deputed Testamony, a 14-1 shot,

charged through the stretch to overtake
Desert Wine for the victory.
"It may be a funny thing to say," Cross said,
"but it (losing) may have been the best thing
that happened. We've got to get this disorder
under control. It bothers me worse than
him."
Lea dumps Giants 2-0
Montreal — Montreal Expos' pitcher
Charlie Lea said his five-hit, 2-0 victory over
San Francisco yesterday "was notthat pretty."
But the adjectives Giants' Manager Frank
Robinson used while watching histeam make
five errors were undoubtedly far more col
orful than the term used by Lea. Two of the
errors led to unearned runs, the only two Lea
needed.
"Even with the errors, we didn't score any
runs, and vou don't win too many games that
way," saio Robinson. "But we gave them two
runs, so the worst it should have been was
0-0."
Lea, 3-1, had not won since April 16. He car
ried a five-hitter into the ninth inning but was
replaced by Jeff Reardon after walking Tom
O'Malley and pinch hitter Max Venable, the
first two batters. Reardon then retired the
next three batters in order for his third save.
Cerone keys Yankees
Oakland — Rick Cerone sent the New York
Yankees ahead with a ninth-inning single and
used his throwing arm a few minutes later to

end the Oakland A's victory hopes yesterday.
"The way I've been going, any hit is a good
hit," said Cerone, the catcher who entered
the game with a .176 batting average.
His tie-breaking single was followed by
jerry Mumphrey's sacrifice fly, and Rich
Gossage came out of the New York bullpen to
preserve the 4-2 victory.
Gossage struck out two batters, but Wayne
Gross singled and Mitchell Page walked in
the bottom of the ninth. Rickey Henderson
was at the plate with a 2-2 count when Gross
tried to steal third. Cerone made a perfect
throw to end the game.
"He had a pretty good jump. But I don't
think it was a real smart move, and we capital
ized on their mistake," Cerone said.
Holmes may retire
Las Vegas, Nev. — Larry Holmes, admitting
"I slipped a little," is faced with the decision
of retiring as an unbeaten heavyweight box
ing champion or continuing a profession
that, at age 33, is obviously becoming tougher
for him.
"He tried to do what he practiced in the
gym," trainer Eddie Futch said after Holmes
kept the World Boxing Council title in his
15th defense with a split decision over 25-
year-old Tim Witherspoon Friday night.
"That's a fighter who might be ready to put
them up on the wall."
"I would retire because there's sombody
out there stronger than him," said Withers
poon, who had Holmes in seriously trouble in
the ninth round of the 12-round bout. "I per
sonally think he should give it up."
