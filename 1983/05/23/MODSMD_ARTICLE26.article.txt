# Kennedy speaks on UC, Hoover
## 
### 
In a speech before a group of
California newspaper editors Friday,
University President Donald Ken
nedy discussed the financial prob
lems facing the University of Califor
nia system, the current controversy
over the Hoover Institution and
plans for a conference with the pres
idents of Yale and Harvard this sum
mer.
Kennedy urged the editors to pay
more attention to the UC system and
the "extraordinarily serious" finan-

cial problems facing it.
"This state has produced surely
the most distinguished example of
public higher education ever ac
complished in the world It is simply
an extraordinary, irreplacable asset. I
do not have the sense, at the mo
ment, that it is being taken seriously
enough by this state government, or
that the range of economic solutions
recommended to protect it are
adequate."
In response to a question on the

Hoover controversy, Kennedy said
he thinks "the temperature of the
controversy is going down now, as
people begin to understand that
political head counting ... is not
important."
Finally, Kennedy said that he has
plans to meet with the presidents of
Harvard and Yale at a conference on
major research universities and the
public schools to be held here late
this summer.
