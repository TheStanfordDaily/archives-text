# Udall: treat Soviets as people

### TROY EID Staff writer 
"I think we ought to start treating
the Soviets as human beings instead
of stereotypes," Rep. Morris Udall
(D-Ariz.) told a sparse Kresge Au
ditorium audience Friday afternoon.
Udall, a 1976 Democratic presiden
tial hopeful, commented on both the
military and energy aspects of the
nuclear age, which he said "has been
haunting our presidents" since 1944.
Noting the precarious position of
the continuing nuclear arms build
up between the United States and
the Soviet Union, Udall referred to a
near-catastrophic 1950s incident, in
which a faulty American radar system
interpreted a moon rise over the
North Pole "as a Soviet attack."
Udall explained the superpowers'
role in the arms race via analogy:
"We are paralyzed . . . in a basement
full of gasoline, fighting over who
has enough matches."
He said he does not see the Soviets
"as the center of evil, like the presi
dent does." The key to retarding the
arms race and establishing peaceful
relations with the Russians, he stres
sed, is "to open channels of com
munication with them."

In an attempt to achieve better
communication between the super
powers, Udall proposed a plan sev
eral years ago, in which American
and Soviet high school students
would exchange places for one year
study programs. Besides the stu
dents serving as "hostages," Udall
said such a joint venture "would
gradually develop a generation of
leaders on either side."
President Reagan has potential "to
restrict, perhaps a little bit, the
danger of nuclear war," according to
Udall. He said that if the president
decides to take serious steps to re
duce nuclear weapons, he could
possibly do with the arms race "what
Nixon did with China.
"He says he's more in favor of arms
control than anyone," Udall said, re
ferring to Reagan. "I hope he follows
through."
In reference to various proposals
for deployment of the MX missile,
jokingly mentioned his "favo
rite plan of all â€”check the MX on the
night flight to Boise."
Udall, who serves on the House
committee that investigated the
breakdown of the Three Mile Island
Nuclear Generating Plant and is pre

sently determining possible nuclear
waste disposal sites, also discussed
the benefits and risks of nuclear
power.
