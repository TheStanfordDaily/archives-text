# Udall: treat Soviets as people
## 
### TROY EID Staff writer 
"I think we ought to start treating
the Soviets as human beings instead
of stereotypes," Rep. Morris Udall
(D-Ariz.) told a sparse Kresge Au
ditorium audience Friday afternoon.
Udall, a 1976 Democratic presiden
tial hopeful, commented on both the
military and energy aspects of the
nuclear age, which he said "has been
haunting our presidents" since 1944.
Noting the precarious position of
the continuing nuclear arms build
up between the United States and
the Soviet Union, Udall referred to a
near-catastrophic 1950s incident, in
which a faulty American radar system
interpreted a moon rise over the
North Pole "as a Soviet attack."
Udall explained the superpowers'
role in the arms race via analogy:
"We are paralyzed . . . in a basement
full of gasoline, fighting over who
has enough matches."
He said he does not see the Soviets
"as the center of evil, like the presi
dent does." The key to retarding the
arms race and establishing peaceful
relations with the Russians, he stres
sed, is "to open channels of com
munication with them."

In an attempt to achieve better
communication between the super
powers, Udall proposed a plan sev
eral years ago, in which American
and Soviet high school students
would exchange places for one year
study programs. Besides the stu
dents serving as "hostages," Udall
said such a joint venture "would
gradually develop a generation of
leaders on either side."
President Reagan has potential "to
restrict, perhaps a little bit, the
danger of nuclear war," according to
Udall. He said that if the president
decides to take serious steps to re
duce nuclear weapons, he could
possibly do with the arms race "what
Nixon did with China.
"He says he's more in favor of arms
control than anyone," Udall said, re
ferring to Reagan. "I hope he follows
through."
In reference to various proposals
for deployment of the MX missile,
jokingly mentioned his "favo
rite plan of all —check the MX on the
night flight to Boise."
Udall, who serves on the House
committee that investigated the
breakdown of the Three Mile Island
Nuclear Generating Plant and is pre

sently determining possible nuclear
waste disposal sites, also discussed
the benefits and risks of nuclear
power.


Morris Udall
He pointed to 1950s predictions of
"1000 nuclear reactors operating by
the end of the century" which would
bring "cheap electricity" to America
and the world.
Today's revised estimate, accord
ing to Udall, consists of the existing
105 American nuclear plants, some
which are still under construction
after months or even years of con
troversy. "Not a single new nuclear
power plant has been ordered" in
the United States since 1978, he ad
ded.
"Nuclear has come to a halt,"
Udall said in reference to electrical
generating plants. We once had an
idea that whenever technology was
developed in America "we were wise
to use it,"he said. But now, "we've
reached a plateau."
"I'm not sure we should have that

attitude that we should charge down
the road" whenever a scientific dis
covery is made, Udall said.
He mentioned the Three Mile Is
land reactor mishap, in which a bro
ken feed pump caused billions of
dollars in damage. In contrast, he
said a similar breakdown at a coal
burning electrical plant "would have
been a 6- to 8-hour repair."
Udall contrasted the curtailment of
nuclear power plant construction in
America with an "accelerated" effort
in parts of Europe.
The Germans and French may re
gret the decision to develop nuclear
power, especially breeder reactors,
he said.
"If you dumped every nuclear
weapon in the ocean, shut down
every nuclear power plant," there
would still be "40 years of hazardous
nuclear waste lying around," Udall
said. "I think there's a real doubt
whether or not we want to plunge
ahead into this swamp."
In reference to the upcoming pres

idential election, Udall claimed that
"the president is in good shape polit
ically. If the election were held to
day, I think he would pull it off."
The "ingredients" for defeating
Reagan in 1984 do exist, Udall said,
but depend partly "on whether or
not the economy continues to im
prove." He added that much of the
president's opposition will stem
from his positions on minorities,
women and the environment.
Commenting on Reagan's term in
office, Udall said he hopes we get
some "presidential leadership"
soon. He mentioned former Presi
dent Gerald Ford's current lifestyle,
which includes golf and a home in
Palm Springs.
"Being an ex-president is so
good," Udall joked. "I would rec
ommend it to Ronald Reagan."
The speech marked the conclusion
of the "Visions of America: The 1984
Presidential Election" series, spon
sored by the Stanford Law Forum.

eral years ago, in which American
and Soviet high school students
would exchange places for one year
study programs. Besides the stu
dents serving as "hostages," Udall
said such a joint venture "would
gradually develop a generation of
leaders on either side."
President Reagan has potential "to
restrict, perhaps a little bit, the
danger of nuclear war," according to
Udall. He said that if the president
decides to take serious steps to re
duce nuclear weapons, he could
possibly do with the arms race "what
Nixon did with China.
"He says he's more in favor of arms
control than anyone," Udall said, re
ferring to Reagan. "I hope he follows
through."

Udall, who serves on the House
committee that investigated the

Nuclear Generating Plant and is pre

waste disposal sites, also discussed
the benefits and risks of nuclear
power.


Morris Udall
He pointed to 1950s predictions of
"1000 nuclear reactors operating by
the end of the century" which would
bring "cheap electricity" to America
and the world.
Today's revised estimate, accord
ing to Udall, consists of the existing
105 American nuclear plants, some
which are still under construction
after months or even years of con
troversy. "Not a single new nuclear
power plant has been ordered" in
the United States since 1978, he ad
ded.
"Nuclear has come to a halt,"
Udall said in reference to electrical
generating plants. We once had an
idea that whenever technology was
developed in America "we were wise
to use it,"he said. But now, "we've
reached a plateau."
"I'm not sure we should have that

attitude that we should charge down
the road" whenever a scientific dis
covery is made, Udall said.
He mentioned the Three Mile Is
land reactor mishap, in which a bro
ken feed pump caused billions of
dollars in damage. In contrast, he
said a similar breakdown at a coal
burning electrical plant "would have
been a 6- to 8-hour repair."
Udall contrasted the curtailment of
nuclear power plant construction in
America with an "accelerated" effort
in parts of Europe.
The Germans and French may re
gret the decision to develop nuclear
power, especially breeder reactors,
he said.
"If you dumped every nuclear
weapon in the ocean, shut down
every nuclear power plant," there
would still be "40 years of hazardous
nuclear waste lying around," Udall
said. "I think there's a real doubt
whether or not we want to plunge
ahead into this swamp."
In reference to the upcoming pres

idential election, Udall claimed that
"the president is in good shape polit
ically. If the election were held to
day, I think he would pull it off."
The "ingredients" for defeating
Reagan in 1984 do exist, Udall said,
but depend partly "on whether or
not the economy continues to im
prove." He added that much of the
president's opposition will stem
from his positions on minorities,
women and the environment.
Commenting on Reagan's term in
office, Udall said he hopes we get
some "presidential leadership"
soon. He mentioned former Presi
dent Gerald Ford's current lifestyle,
which includes golf and a home in
Palm Springs.
"Being an ex-president is so
good," Udall joked. "I would rec
ommend it to Ronald Reagan."
The speech marked the conclusion
of the "Visions of America: The 1984
Presidential Election" series, spon
sored by the Stanford Law Forum.
"I think we ought to start treating
the Soviets as human beings instead
of stereotypes," Rep. Morris Udall
(D-Ariz.) told a sparse Kresge Au
ditorium audience Friday afternoon.
Udall, a 1976 Democratic presiden
tial hopeful, commented on both the
military and energy aspects of the
nuclear age, which he said "has been
haunting our presidents" since 1944.
Noting the precarious position of
the continuing nuclear arms build
up between the United States and
the Soviet Union, Udall referred to a
near-catastrophic 1950s incident, in
which a faulty American radar system
interpreted a moon rise over the
North Pole "as a Soviet attack."
Udall explained the superpowers'
role in the arms race via analogy:
"We are paralyzed . . . in a basement
full of gasoline, fighting over who
has enough matches."
He said he does not see the Soviets
"as the center of evil, like the presi
dent does." The key to retarding the
arms race and establishing peaceful
relations with the Russians, he stres
sed, is "to open channels of com
munication with them."

In an attempt to achieve better
communication between the super
powers, Udall proposed a plan sev
eral years ago, in which American
and Soviet high school students
would exchange places for one year
study programs. Besides the stu
dents serving as "hostages," Udall
said such a joint venture "would
