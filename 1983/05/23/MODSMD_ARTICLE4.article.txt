### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Senior Vincent White, the Cardinal
running hack known for his speed
and compact size, went for gold —
the United States Football League's
Denver Cold — last Thursday.
White signed a "lucrative three
year contract," he said yesterday.
Although he declined to reveal his
salary, he said, "If it wasn't real good,
I would never have left school."

The 22-year-old Denver native left
Stanford Friday to play for his home
town team. He practiced with the
team for the first time Saturday and
played yesterday in his first profes
sional football game, broadcast here
at 10:10 a.m. bv ABC-TV.

He cited "hometown opportuni
ties" and more money as two reasons
for turning down his sixth-round
draft pick by the National Football
League's New York Jets. "I just had to
weigh all the opportunities," he said.
The 5-foot-8, 190-pound White
said he played in three plays for
about two minutes in the Cold's
game against the Los Angeles Express
yesterday.
White said he will buy a con
dominium in the Bay Area when the
USFL season ends in July. He will
then live here from July through Jan
uary.
He said he plans to graduate from
Stanford fall quarter, after finishing
incompletes from this quarter's clas
ses. He needs four additional unitsto
graduate, he said.
Football coach Paul Wiggin is out
of town and could not be reached for
comment. Offensive coordinator Jim
Fassel, who played with the World
Football League, said, "I'm very
happy for him. . . . It's a good situa
tion."
"He'll be a Surprise to them. Vin
cent White was one of the more un
derrated players in the country (be
cause of his small size)," Fassel ad
ded.
White is "very bright" and "very
competitive," Fassel said. "He's
going to be better than they think he
is."
White is currently at his family
home in Denver. His grandfather
told the Daily he was happy with his
grandson's decision. "He's right
