# McCloskey distributes 'obscure' reading list

### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
In yet another episode in the con
tinuing controversy over Pete "Paul"
McCloskey's Guest Professor Board
(GPB) class here, the former con
gressman passed out a reading list
last week with material that is "a little
more subjective and from slightly
obscure sources than other material
he's assigned," said one student in
the class.
"Up until now we've been reading
Congressional Reports, letters by
and to McCloskey and news articles.
But now there are some weird things
like a letter from the Arab News
which says some pretty ridiculous
things about our interests in Israel.
The reading at the end of the course
has drifted away from a strict adher
ence to the syllabus to a more subjec
tive outlook," the student said.
Although members of Stanford's
Jewish community have accused
McCloskey of anti-Semitism in the
past, heboid the Daily that he is only
trying to present both sides of the
Middle East issue.
"You'll find both pro-Israel and
pro-Arab reading on the list. I've
tried to balance that out. It certainly
isn't anti-Semitic to disagree with (Is
raeli Prime Minister Menachem) Be
gin, and for students at Stanford to
say that it's anti-Semitic is bizarre,"
McCloskey said.
Although the new directors of the
GPB, Enrique Lerner and Nathan
Brostrom, will not comment on
McCloskey's latest actions until they

have discussed them with him,
Lerner said that McCloskey has
drifted from the GPB's approved
reading list before.
But McCloskey claimed that there
never was any approved reading list
and that former C.PB Director Seth
Linfield only made non-binding
suggestions on the readings for the
class.
"What approved reading list? Seth
Linfield looked through some 20 fol
ders of material that I had, and after
he looked over my lists he suggested
certain things and he asked that I not
use certain things. There was never
any insistence; there were only
suggestions, and there was never any
'approved' reading list," McCloskey
said.
Linfield, whose term as director
ended this month, was not available
for comment.
According to Lerner, McCloskey
and the GPB did agree to a reading
list for the class but the list was only
"an agreement and never legalized."
"There was never anything
signed," Lerner said. "The way it
worked was that he gave us a whole
box of readings — about 2000 or WOO
pages — and said for us to read them.
He said, 'I'll show you my preference
and you show me mine and then
we'll compromise.' Our mistake was
not to sign anything,'' he said.
McCloskey said that even when he
agreed to drop books from his read
ing list, Linfield did not come
