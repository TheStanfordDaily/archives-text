Lebanon suggests new terms
Beirut â€” Lebanon is willing to offer far more gener
ous economic and political concessions to Syria to ob
tain the withdrawal of its troops than the Beirut gov
ernment has granted Israel, according to Lebanese of
ficials.
Lebanese are concerned whether the prickly, hard
line Syrian government will come to the bargaining
table or try to plunge Lebanon into greater chaos. Is
rael will not pull out its troops under last week's ac
cord with the Beirut government until Syrian and
Palestine Liberation Organization forces also leave
Lebanon.
Advisers to President Amin Gemayel are pondering
various contingency plans in the event Syria follows
through on veiled threats it has made since the Leba

non-Israel accords.
These include the possibility that Syria would close
its borders with Lebanon, blocking the country's vital
trade link to the Persian Gulf, or stir up conflict inside
Lebanon. The advisers are even trying to figure out
what they would do if Syria declares the area of Leba
non it occupies an independent state.
Advisers to Gemayel said they always knew that the
Syrian phase of the negotiations for the withdrawal of
foreign forces from Lebanon would be difficult, and
they say they were prepared for the initial rejection of
the accords with Israel.
But the sustained, vehement attack, especially the
polemical assaults on Gemayel and his government
amid warnings of new civil war here, were a surprise.
There is still hope that Syria will come around.
