Lebanon suggests new terms
Beirut — Lebanon is willing to offer far more gener
ous economic and political concessions to Syria to ob
tain the withdrawal of its troops than the Beirut gov
ernment has granted Israel, according to Lebanese of
ficials.
Lebanese are concerned whether the prickly, hard
line Syrian government will come to the bargaining
table or try to plunge Lebanon into greater chaos. Is
rael will not pull out its troops under last week's ac
cord with the Beirut government until Syrian and
Palestine Liberation Organization forces also leave
Lebanon.
Advisers to President Amin Gemayel are pondering
various contingency plans in the event Syria follows
through on veiled threats it has made since the Leba

non-Israel accords.
These include the possibility that Syria would close
its borders with Lebanon, blocking the country's vital
trade link to the Persian Gulf, or stir up conflict inside
Lebanon. The advisers are even trying to figure out
what they would do if Syria declares the area of Leba
non it occupies an independent state.
Advisers to Gemayel said they always knew that the
Syrian phase of the negotiations for the withdrawal of
foreign forces from Lebanon would be difficult, and
they say they were prepared for the initial rejection of
the accords with Israel.
But the sustained, vehement attack, especially the
polemical assaults on Gemayel and his government
amid warnings of new civil war here, were a surprise.
There is still hope that Syria will come around.
"I do not not believe that the Syrian position is
final," Foreign Minister Elie Salem, told reporters yes
terday in Paris.
"I cannot conceive that Syria will remain adamant
in its present position and expose Lebanon to the in
finite danger that we face," he said. "The choice is be
tween withdrawal with this agreement or the extinc
tion of Lebanon."
But neither Lebanese nor foreign diplomats here
express the measure of confidence about the situ
ation that is found in the comments coming out of
Washington.
The confidence in Washington involves a "certain
amount of whistling in the dark," said a diplomat fa
miliar with the affairs of both the Americans and Leb
anese. "It isa tactic of 'Keepsmiling and hopethatthe
Syrians will be reasonable.'"
"Optimism is premature," he added.
Rights groups fight Reagan move
Washington — A national coalition of civil rights
groups, responding to reports that President Reagan
intends to replace four members of the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission, accused Reagan yesterday of at
tempting to turn the commission into a "political
football."
According to published reports, Reagan intends to
complete a turnover of the six-member commission
by replacing three commissioners appointed by Presi
dent Carter and one appointed by President Ford.
The chairman and vice chairman of the commission
are Reagan appointees.
However, a White House aide said yesterday that
the Ford appointee — Jill Ruckelshaus, wife of En
vironmental Protection Agency administrator Wil
liam Ruckelshaus — would retain her seat on the
commission.
Asked about the reports yesterday as he returned to
the White House from Camp David, Md., Reagan
said, "I can't answer that now."
Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, said the reported over
haul "would be challenging the independence and
integrity of both the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
and the United States Senate."
The large-scale turnover would turn the com
mission "into a political football, something that ev
ery previous Republican and Democratic president
has refused to do," Neas said. The only time a mem
ber of the 26-year-old commission has been removed
was in 1972, when President Nixon dismissed the Rev.
Theodore Hesburgh, the University of Notre Dame
president critical of Nixon's civil-rights policies.
Aides of commission members were quoted yester
day as saying that Reagan intends to appoint new
members while the Senate is in recess for the Memo
rial Day holiday, meaning the members could serve
for the rest of the year without Senate confirmation.
The nominees reportedly would include several who
have publicly opposed affirmative action and busing
as tools to fight discrimination.
An administration attempt to change the com
mission's membership failed last yearwhen nominees
ran into stiff opposition in the Senate, which sent the
names back to the White House at the end of the con
gressional session.
Doctors escape during strike
Jerusalem — Like B-52 crews on a strategic bomb
ing mission, Israel's doctors left their hospitals and
clinics yesterday aboard buses bound for destinations
that were kept secret until a group leader opened an
envelope en route.
The maneuver to escape government back-to
work orders — which began when a special code
word was passed in early morning — was the latest ef
fort by the 8,500 government-employed physicians to
press their demands for higher wages. Although tech
nically on strike forthe past 82 days, most doctors had
been treating patients much of the time.
The military flavor of yesterday's gambit may prove
to be prophetic. At least one Cabinet member has
suggested drafting the striking physicians into the
army. Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Cabinet
plans to meet either tomorrow or Wednesday to con
sider its next step.
In the meantime, the Cabinet voted at its regular
meeting yesterday to issue back-to-work orders un
der Israeli labor law. If the physicians do not return to
the hospitals and clinics by this morning, they could
be subject to arrest and imprisonment.

The doctors say that the back-to-work orders do
not apply to them because they resigned en masse
before the government issued the writs. But Attorney
General Yitzhak Zamir insisted that the orders were
legal and would be enforced.
Most Israelis receive medical care either through
government-operated hospitals and clinics or
through facilities run by a health insurance fund
sponsored by the Histadrut Labor Federation. In both
cases, they are considered civil servants. Private doc
tors were not affected by the strike.
According to accounts broadcast by Israel radio
and television networks, most of the 8500 striking
doctors headed for resort hotels around the country.
The international border south of the southern city of
Eliat was closed temporarily after a rumor circulated
that the physicians were all headed for a beach resort
in the previously-Israeli, now-Egyptian Sinai.
A hotel operator in Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee
told Israel Radio that he hoped the doctors were not
headed his way because he had just received reserva
tions from a large group of "university graduates." He
said later that the reservations were actually from the
doctors who had registered under false names and
had listed their occupations simply as "university
graduate."
Call for troops in El Salvador
Quarry Heights, Panama — Stopping Marxist ex
pansion in Central America requires a substantial,
ideally open-ended increase in U.S. military aid and
military trainers on the ground in El Salvador, and may
ultimately require a willingness to use U.S. troops, ac
cording to the commander of U.S. forces in Latin
America.
"From my point of view, in a military judgment,"
said Lt. Gen. Wallace Nutting, head of the U.S. South
ern Command, "we have not done what is required."
In an end-of-tour interview at his headquarters
here last week, Nutting, 54, described his nearly four
years in Panama as filled with frustration, initially over
American unwillingness to recognize the problem in
Central America, and more recently, failure to
achieve consensus on what should be done about it.
Central America is at war, Nutting said. The United
States, like it or not, "is engaged in that war." He said
the moment of crisis that he predicted when "nobody
listened" is now at hand and"the alternatives.. . are
starkly clear .... If we give up, it may be the last
time."
Although the Reagan administration "has said that
we will not allow a Marxist government to take office
in San Salvador, our government as a whole and our
people as a whole have not followed up that commit
ment with a willingness to take those steps necessary
to bring that about," Nutting said.
Germany seeks U.S. flexibility
Bonn, West Germany — West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl hopes to obtain new assurances of U.S.
flexibility in the Geneva arms control talks from Presi
dent Reagan this week in order to carry a positive
message to Soviet Leader Yuri Andropov when Kohl
travels to Moscow on July 4, according to chancellery
and Foreign Ministry officials here.
Kohl's trip to Moscow is considered here the most
crucial diplomatic effort this year to nail down an
arms control agreement, and he ardently desires as
surances of cooperation from Washington during his
trip to the United States for the Williamsburg, Va., ec
onomic summit.
Senior government officials in Bonn are concerned
by what they perceive as a growing conviction in the
Reagan administration that Pershing II missiles must
be deployed in West Germany later this year before
the Soviets will bend toward a plausible compromise.
While prepared to deploy the missiles if necessary,
the Kohl government wants to explore every possible
avenue to curtail medium-range nuclear weapons
before the December stationing deadline.
Senior government officials in Bonn said they are
pleased that chief U.S. negotiator Paul Nitze has
gained more flexibility to explore possible com
promises at Geneva. But they also said tnat they would
like to see Nitze acquire even more authority and
possibly revive the tentative agreement he reached
last summer with his Soviet counterpart, Yuli
Kvitsinsky.

The maneuver to escape government back-to
work orders — which began when a special code
word was passed in early morning — was the latest ef
fort by the 8,500 government-employed physicians to
press their demands for higher wages. Although tech
nically on strike forthe past 82 days, most doctors had
been treating patients much of the time.
The military flavor of yesterday's gambit may prove
to be prophetic. At least one Cabinet member has
suggested drafting the striking physicians into the
army. Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Cabinet
plans to meet either tomorrow or Wednesday to con
sider its next step.
In the meantime, the Cabinet voted at its regular
meeting yesterday to issue back-to-work orders un
der Israeli labor law. If the physicians do not return to
the hospitals and clinics by this morning, they could
be subject to arrest and imprisonment.

The doctors say that the back-to-work orders do
not apply to them because they resigned en masse
before the government issued the writs. But Attorney
General Yitzhak Zamir insisted that the orders were
legal and would be enforced.
Most Israelis receive medical care either through
government-operated hospitals and clinics or
through facilities run by a health insurance fund
sponsored by the Histadrut Labor Federation. In both
cases, they are considered civil servants. Private doc
tors were not affected by the strike.
According to accounts broadcast by Israel radio
and television networks, most of the 8500 striking
doctors headed for resort hotels around the country.
The international border south of the southern city of
Eliat was closed temporarily after a rumor circulated
that the physicians were all headed for a beach resort
in the previously-Israeli, now-Egyptian Sinai.
A hotel operator in Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee
told Israel Radio that he hoped the doctors were not
headed his way because he had just received reserva
tions from a large group of "university graduates." He
said later that the reservations were actually from the
doctors who had registered under false names and
had listed their occupations simply as "university
graduate."
Call for troops in El Salvador
Quarry Heights, Panama — Stopping Marxist ex
pansion in Central America requires a substantial,
ideally open-ended increase in U.S. military aid and
military trainers on the ground in El Salvador, and may
ultimately require a willingness to use U.S. troops, ac
cording to the commander of U.S. forces in Latin
America.
"From my point of view, in a military judgment,"
said Lt. Gen. Wallace Nutting, head of the U.S. South
ern Command, "we have not done what is required."
In an end-of-tour interview at his headquarters
here last week, Nutting, 54, described his nearly four
years in Panama as filled with frustration, initially over
American unwillingness to recognize the problem in
Central America, and more recently, failure to
achieve consensus on what should be done about it.
Central America is at war, Nutting said. The United
States, like it or not, "is engaged in that war." He said
the moment of crisis that he predicted when "nobody
listened" is now at hand and"the alternatives.. . are
starkly clear .... If we give up, it may be the last
time."
Although the Reagan administration "has said that
we will not allow a Marxist government to take office
in San Salvador, our government as a whole and our
people as a whole have not followed up that commit
ment with a willingness to take those steps necessary
to bring that about," Nutting said.
Germany seeks U.S. flexibility
Bonn, West Germany — West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl hopes to obtain new assurances of U.S.
flexibility in the Geneva arms control talks from Presi
dent Reagan this week in order to carry a positive
message to Soviet Leader Yuri Andropov when Kohl
travels to Moscow on July 4, according to chancellery
and Foreign Ministry officials here.
Kohl's trip to Moscow is considered here the most
crucial diplomatic effort this year to nail down an
arms control agreement, and he ardently desires as
surances of cooperation from Washington during his
trip to the United States for the Williamsburg, Va., ec
onomic summit.
Senior government officials in Bonn are concerned
by what they perceive as a growing conviction in the
Reagan administration that Pershing II missiles must
be deployed in West Germany later this year before
the Soviets will bend toward a plausible compromise.
While prepared to deploy the missiles if necessary,
the Kohl government wants to explore every possible
avenue to curtail medium-range nuclear weapons
before the December stationing deadline.
Senior government officials in Bonn said they are
pleased that chief U.S. negotiator Paul Nitze has
gained more flexibility to explore possible com
promises at Geneva. But they also said tnat they would
like to see Nitze acquire even more authority and
possibly revive the tentative agreement he reached
last summer with his Soviet counterpart, Yuli
Kvitsinsky.

Lebanon suggests new terms
Beirut — Lebanon is willing to offer far more gener
ous economic and political concessions to Syria to ob
tain the withdrawal of its troops than the Beirut gov
ernment has granted Israel, according to Lebanese of
ficials.
Lebanese are concerned whether the prickly, hard
line Syrian government will come to the bargaining
table or try to plunge Lebanon into greater chaos. Is
rael will not pull out its troops under last week's ac
cord with the Beirut government until Syrian and
Palestine Liberation Organization forces also leave
Lebanon.
Advisers to President Amin Gemayel are pondering
various contingency plans in the event Syria follows
through on veiled threats it has made since the Leba

non-Israel accords.
These include the possibility that Syria would close
its borders with Lebanon, blocking the country's vital
trade link to the Persian Gulf, or stir up conflict inside
Lebanon. The advisers are even trying to figure out
what they would do if Syria declares the area of Leba
non it occupies an independent state.
Advisers to Gemayel said they always knew that the
Syrian phase of the negotiations for the withdrawal of
foreign forces from Lebanon would be difficult, and
they say they were prepared for the initial rejection of
the accords with Israel.
But the sustained, vehement attack, especially the
polemical assaults on Gemayel and his government
amid warnings of new civil war here, were a surprise.
There is still hope that Syria will come around.
"I do not not believe that the Syrian position is
final," Foreign Minister Elie Salem, told reporters yes
terday in Paris.
"I cannot conceive that Syria will remain adamant
in its present position and expose Lebanon to the in
finite danger that we face," he said. "The choice is be
tween withdrawal with this agreement or the extinc
tion of Lebanon."
But neither Lebanese nor foreign diplomats here
express the measure of confidence about the situ
ation that is found in the comments coming out of
Washington.
The confidence in Washington involves a "certain
amount of whistling in the dark," said a diplomat fa
miliar with the affairs of both the Americans and Leb
anese. "It isa tactic of 'Keepsmiling and hopethatthe
Syrians will be reasonable.'"
"Optimism is premature," he added.
Rights groups fight Reagan move
Washington — A national coalition of civil rights
groups, responding to reports that President Reagan
intends to replace four members of the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission, accused Reagan yesterday of at
tempting to turn the commission into a "political
football."
According to published reports, Reagan intends to
complete a turnover of the six-member commission
by replacing three commissioners appointed by Presi
dent Carter and one appointed by President Ford.
The chairman and vice chairman of the commission
are Reagan appointees.
However, a White House aide said yesterday that
the Ford appointee — Jill Ruckelshaus, wife of En
vironmental Protection Agency administrator Wil
liam Ruckelshaus — would retain her seat on the
commission.
Asked about the reports yesterday as he returned to
the White House from Camp David, Md., Reagan
said, "I can't answer that now."
Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, said the reported over
haul "would be challenging the independence and
integrity of both the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
and the United States Senate."
The large-scale turnover would turn the com
mission "into a political football, something that ev
ery previous Republican and Democratic president
has refused to do," Neas said. The only time a mem
ber of the 26-year-old commission has been removed
was in 1972, when President Nixon dismissed the Rev.
Theodore Hesburgh, the University of Notre Dame
president critical of Nixon's civil-rights policies.
Aides of commission members were quoted yester
day as saying that Reagan intends to appoint new
members while the Senate is in recess for the Memo
rial Day holiday, meaning the members could serve
for the rest of the year without Senate confirmation.
The nominees reportedly would include several who
have publicly opposed affirmative action and busing
as tools to fight discrimination.
An administration attempt to change the com
mission's membership failed last yearwhen nominees
ran into stiff opposition in the Senate, which sent the
names back to the White House at the end of the con
gressional session.
Doctors escape during strike

pleased that chief U.S. negotiator Paul Nitze has
gained more flexibility to explore possible com
promises at Geneva. But they also said tnat they would
like to see Nitze acquire even more authority and
possibly revive the tentative agreement he reached
last summer with his Soviet counterpart, Yuli
Kvitsinsky.

Lebanon suggests new terms
Beirut — Lebanon is willing to offer far more gener
ous economic and political concessions to Syria to ob
tain the withdrawal of its troops than the Beirut gov
ernment has granted Israel, according to Lebanese of
ficials.
Lebanese are concerned whether the prickly, hard
line Syrian government will come to the bargaining
table or try to plunge Lebanon into greater chaos. Is
rael will not pull out its troops under last week's ac
cord with the Beirut government until Syrian and
Palestine Liberation Organization forces also leave
Lebanon.
Advisers to President Amin Gemayel are pondering
various contingency plans in the event Syria follows
through on veiled threats it has made since the Leba

non-Israel accords.
These include the possibility that Syria would close
its borders with Lebanon, blocking the country's vital
trade link to the Persian Gulf, or stir up conflict inside
Lebanon. The advisers are even trying to figure out
what they would do if Syria declares the area of Leba
non it occupies an independent state.
Advisers to Gemayel said they always knew that the
Syrian phase of the negotiations for the withdrawal of
foreign forces from Lebanon would be difficult, and
they say they were prepared for the initial rejection of
the accords with Israel.
But the sustained, vehement attack, especially the
polemical assaults on Gemayel and his government
amid warnings of new civil war here, were a surprise.
There is still hope that Syria will come around.
"I do not not believe that the Syrian position is
final," Foreign Minister Elie Salem, told reporters yes
terday in Paris.
"I cannot conceive that Syria will remain adamant
in its present position and expose Lebanon to the in
finite danger that we face," he said. "The choice is be
tween withdrawal with this agreement or the extinc
tion of Lebanon."
But neither Lebanese nor foreign diplomats here
express the measure of confidence about the situ
ation that is found in the comments coming out of
Washington.
The confidence in Washington involves a "certain
amount of whistling in the dark," said a diplomat fa
miliar with the affairs of both the Americans and Leb
anese. "It isa tactic of 'Keepsmiling and hopethatthe
Syrians will be reasonable.'"
"Optimism is premature," he added.
Rights groups fight Reagan move
Washington — A national coalition of civil rights
groups, responding to reports that President Reagan
intends to replace four members of the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission, accused Reagan yesterday of at
tempting to turn the commission into a "political
football."
According to published reports, Reagan intends to
complete a turnover of the six-member commission
by replacing three commissioners appointed by Presi
dent Carter and one appointed by President Ford.
The chairman and vice chairman of the commission
are Reagan appointees.
However, a White House aide said yesterday that
the Ford appointee — Jill Ruckelshaus, wife of En
vironmental Protection Agency administrator Wil
liam Ruckelshaus — would retain her seat on the
commission.
Asked about the reports yesterday as he returned to
the White House from Camp David, Md., Reagan
said, "I can't answer that now."
Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, said the reported over
haul "would be challenging the independence and
integrity of both the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
and the United States Senate."
The large-scale turnover would turn the com
mission "into a political football, something that ev
ery previous Republican and Democratic president
has refused to do," Neas said. The only time a mem
ber of the 26-year-old commission has been removed
was in 1972, when President Nixon dismissed the Rev.
Theodore Hesburgh, the University of Notre Dame
president critical of Nixon's civil-rights policies.
Aides of commission members were quoted yester
day as saying that Reagan intends to appoint new
members while the Senate is in recess for the Memo
rial Day holiday, meaning the members could serve
for the rest of the year without Senate confirmation.
The nominees reportedly would include several who
have publicly opposed affirmative action and busing
as tools to fight discrimination.
An administration attempt to change the com
mission's membership failed last yearwhen nominees
ran into stiff opposition in the Senate, which sent the
names back to the White House at the end of the con
gressional session.
Doctors escape during strike
Jerusalem — Like B-52 crews on a strategic bomb
ing mission, Israel's doctors left their hospitals and
clinics yesterday aboard buses bound for destinations
that were kept secret until a group leader opened an
envelope en route.
The maneuver to escape government back-to
work orders — which began when a special code
word was passed in early morning — was the latest ef
fort by the 8,500 government-employed physicians to
press their demands for higher wages. Although tech
nically on strike forthe past 82 days, most doctors had
been treating patients much of the time.
The military flavor of yesterday's gambit may prove
to be prophetic. At least one Cabinet member has
suggested drafting the striking physicians into the
army. Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Cabinet
plans to meet either tomorrow or Wednesday to con
sider its next step.
In the meantime, the Cabinet voted at its regular
meeting yesterday to issue back-to-work orders un
der Israeli labor law. If the physicians do not return to
the hospitals and clinics by this morning, they could
be subject to arrest and imprisonment.

The doctors say that the back-to-work orders do
not apply to them because they resigned en masse
before the government issued the writs. But Attorney
General Yitzhak Zamir insisted that the orders were
legal and would be enforced.
Most Israelis receive medical care either through
government-operated hospitals and clinics or
through facilities run by a health insurance fund
sponsored by the Histadrut Labor Federation. In both
cases, they are considered civil servants. Private doc
tors were not affected by the strike.
According to accounts broadcast by Israel radio
and television networks, most of the 8500 striking
doctors headed for resort hotels around the country.
The international border south of the southern city of
Eliat was closed temporarily after a rumor circulated
that the physicians were all headed for a beach resort
in the previously-Israeli, now-Egyptian Sinai.
A hotel operator in Tiberias on the Sea of Galilee
told Israel Radio that he hoped the doctors were not
headed his way because he had just received reserva
tions from a large group of "university graduates." He
said later that the reservations were actually from the
doctors who had registered under false names and
had listed their occupations simply as "university
graduate."
Call for troops in El Salvador
Quarry Heights, Panama — Stopping Marxist ex
pansion in Central America requires a substantial,
ideally open-ended increase in U.S. military aid and
military trainers on the ground in El Salvador, and may
ultimately require a willingness to use U.S. troops, ac
cording to the commander of U.S. forces in Latin
America.
"From my point of view, in a military judgment,"
said Lt. Gen. Wallace Nutting, head of the U.S. South
ern Command, "we have not done what is required."
In an end-of-tour interview at his headquarters
here last week, Nutting, 54, described his nearly four
years in Panama as filled with frustration, initially over
American unwillingness to recognize the problem in
Central America, and more recently, failure to
achieve consensus on what should be done about it.
Central America is at war, Nutting said. The United
States, like it or not, "is engaged in that war." He said
the moment of crisis that he predicted when "nobody
listened" is now at hand and"the alternatives.. . are
starkly clear .... If we give up, it may be the last
time."
Although the Reagan administration "has said that
we will not allow a Marxist government to take office
in San Salvador, our government as a whole and our
people as a whole have not followed up that commit
ment with a willingness to take those steps necessary
to bring that about," Nutting said.
Germany seeks U.S. flexibility
Bonn, West Germany — West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl hopes to obtain new assurances of U.S.
flexibility in the Geneva arms control talks from Presi
dent Reagan this week in order to carry a positive
message to Soviet Leader Yuri Andropov when Kohl
travels to Moscow on July 4, according to chancellery
and Foreign Ministry officials here.
Kohl's trip to Moscow is considered here the most
crucial diplomatic effort this year to nail down an
arms control agreement, and he ardently desires as
surances of cooperation from Washington during his
trip to the United States for the Williamsburg, Va., ec
onomic summit.
Senior government officials in Bonn are concerned
by what they perceive as a growing conviction in the
Reagan administration that Pershing II missiles must
be deployed in West Germany later this year before
the Soviets will bend toward a plausible compromise.
While prepared to deploy the missiles if necessary,
the Kohl government wants to explore every possible
avenue to curtail medium-range nuclear weapons
before the December stationing deadline.
Senior government officials in Bonn said they are
pleased that chief U.S. negotiator Paul Nitze has
gained more flexibility to explore possible com
promises at Geneva. But they also said tnat they would
like to see Nitze acquire even more authority and
possibly revive the tentative agreement he reached
last summer with his Soviet counterpart, Yuli
Kvitsinsky.
