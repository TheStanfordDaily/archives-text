# Round Two draw results due today
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
Students who stayed in for Round Two of the housing
draw will discover today where and if they are housed.
Some will be relieved to find they have been liberated
trom their Round One assignment, while others will go
back to the "drawing board"—leafing through the draw
book to dedide where to waitlist.
As usual, fraternity pledges who dropped out of the
draw created a disparity between the number of addi
tional spaces for men and women. Rodger Whitney,
assistant dean of student affairs and director of housing,
said the cutoff for assigned males was 1026 unguaran
teed.
"Last year at this time, the cutoff was 4740 guaran
teed," he said. "The Round One cutoff for this year was
close to that figure."
The cutoff for women rose from 946 unguaranteed to
1377 unguaranteed, a considerably smaller jump than

the men's cutoff. Because of this, fewer women moved
from their Round One assignments to desirable choices.
"Some women did move up," Whitney said, but there
were many more male reassignments.
Overall, there were actually fewer Round One drop
outs this year than last year. Two hundred and ninety
two students dropped out of the 1982 spring draw, and
only 236 dropped this year. Whitney said that this was
because for the first time ever resident assistants (RAs)
were pulled out of the draw during Round One.
"We've never taken RAs out before," he said. "It will
definitely make a difference."
In Round Two, special-priority houses are filled with
students who have priority, but when this pool runs out
students without priorities are admitted. Columbae,
EAST house, La Maison Francaise, and Terra began to
admit students without priorities; there are still spaces
available for men in La Maison and for women and men
in EAST house.
"We still have several vacancies," Whitney said. "We
filled the co-ops for the first time, but we have spaces in
EAST, the French house and the suites." He added that
the spaces in the suites were all individual spaces, and
that several would be reserved for transfer students.
Now that Round Two is over, students again have

three choices. "At this point, everyone must take care of
draw card three," Whitney said. On this card, students
must state whether they wish to drop out of the draw
entirely, accept their assignment or waitlist over the
summer.
Students accepting their assignment should re
member to attend meetings held this week to determine
where they will be living within the house they have
been assigned. A schedule of room assignment meet
ings will be available today at the residential education
office, Whitney said.
