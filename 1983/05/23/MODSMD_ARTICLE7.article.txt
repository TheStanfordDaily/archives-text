# Round Two draw results due today
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
Students who stayed in for Round Two of the housing
draw will discover today where and if they are housed.
Some will be relieved to find they have been liberated
trom their Round One assignment, while others will go
back to the "drawing board"â€”leafing through the draw
book to dedide where to waitlist.
As usual, fraternity pledges who dropped out of the
draw created a disparity between the number of addi
tional spaces for men and women. Rodger Whitney,
assistant dean of student affairs and director of housing,
said the cutoff for assigned males was 1026 unguaran
teed.
"Last year at this time, the cutoff was 4740 guaran
teed," he said. "The Round One cutoff for this year was
close to that figure."
The cutoff for women rose from 946 unguaranteed to
1377 unguaranteed, a considerably smaller jump than

the men's cutoff. Because of this, fewer women moved
from their Round One assignments to desirable choices.
"Some women did move up," Whitney said, but there
were many more male reassignments.
Overall, there were actually fewer Round One drop
outs this year than last year. Two hundred and ninety
two students dropped out of the 1982 spring draw, and
only 236 dropped this year. Whitney said that this was
because for the first time ever resident assistants (RAs)
were pulled out of the draw during Round One.
"We've never taken RAs out before," he said. "It will
definitely make a difference."
In Round Two, special-priority houses are filled with
students who have priority, but when this pool runs out
students without priorities are admitted. Columbae,
EAST house, La Maison Francaise, and Terra began to
admit students without priorities; there are still spaces
