# Court approves EPA's cityhood election

### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
In a victory for proponents of East
Palo Alto incorporation, the state
Court of Appeal in San Francisco
ruled Friday that the controversial
cityhood election should be held June
7.
The 2-1 decision overturned an
earlier ruling by San Mateo County
Superior Court Judge Melvin Cohn,
who said the election should not be
held because county officials failed
to follow state law when they put the
issue on the ballot.
Opponents of incorporation, who
are being represented by former
U.S. Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey,
may still appeal to the California Su
preme Court. McCloskey, currently
a guest professor here, could not be
reached for comment on whether or
not he would appeal the decision.
Supporters of incorporation —
and a few opponents — said they
were happy with the decision.
"We've got a clear election for
June. Now we just have to win it,"
said Barbara Mouton, a proponent of
incorporation.
And Gertrude Wilks, a member of
the five-person East Palo Alto Munic
ipal Council who is against incorpo
ration, said, "The issue should be
settled.
"I'm looking forward to the elec
tion. I want to get it over with/'Wilks
said.
Wilks would not predict which
side would win the election. "I don't
have a crystal ball," she said.
Cohn halted the election because

he said petition gatherers in East Palo
Alto should have gathered 25 percent
of the signatures of the registered
voters in the community instead of
the 5 percent they obtained.
He also said state law prohibits the
community from having an election
for two years after its first election,
which took place last year, unless
San Mateo County's Local Agency
Formation Committee documents
that the election is in the public
interest. LAFCO had not properly
shown that the election was in the
public interest, Cohn said.
The appeals panel ruled that the
pro-cityhood petitioners had acted
properly in gathering the signatures
and that LAFCO had properly shown
that the election was in the public
interest.
Ruben Abrica, a supporter of in
corporation, said opponents of in
corporation, like Wilks, were being
"contradictory" by saying they want
the vote then filing the lawsuit
against it.
"People wonder what the opposi
tion is working for," Abrica said.
But Wilks said she opposes incor
poration because East Palo Alto does
not have the tax base to become a
city independent of San Mateo
County and that the county is trying
to divest itself of the responsibility
for helping the mostly poor people in
the area. *
"The powers that be will stop at
nothing to rid themselves of the poor
and black and other minority people
in East Palo Alto," Wilks said.
