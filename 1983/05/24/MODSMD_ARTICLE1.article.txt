# Athletics Department: Auxiliary enterprise'
## NEWS 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
Many people think of football
when they think of Stanford athle
tics, but the Department of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation
oversees everything from intercol
legiate varsity sports to instructional
frisbee. In the next two days the Daily
will look at the department's $11 mil
lion budget operations and its schol
arship and recruiting practices.

The Department of Athletics, Phys
ical Education and Recreation is a
multi-million dollar entity bearing a
special "auxiliary enterprise" status
which allows a degree of indepen
dence from the rest of the University.
I he department's budget, which
has stabilized after several years of
growth under Athletic Director Andy
Geiger, relies on three basic
sources: income from intercol
legiate events, golf course revenues
and general University funds, ac
cording to Alan Cum mi ngs, associate
director of athletics.
The Athletic Department is some
what unique because none of the
University money it receives pays for
any of the 24 varsity programs cur
rently offered on campus, Cum

mings noted.
Sue Lem Mon, administrative as
sistant to the athletic director, said,
"It's a self-contained unit ... a self
sustaining operation."
Although the University does con
tribute more than $2 million to the
Athletic Department — money that
comes principally from students' tui
tion — this supports only
"academic" areas: physical educa
tion classes and non-intercollegiate
recreational programs.
In addition to the $2 million in Uni
versity funds, the operating budget
includes $5.5 million from intercol
legiate income, $1.4 million from the
Stanford Golf Course and more than
$1 million in miscellaneous funds,
said Cummings.
Intercollegiate income includes
gate receipts from football and bas
ketball games, revenue from conces
sions, programs and souvenirs and
proceeds from television contracts
and postseason bowl games. All this
money directly returns to the Uni
versity's intercollegiate programs,
with football receiving by far the
largest amount.
In addition, the profits from the
golf course — after maintenance of
the links is accounted for — also
support these programs.
Thus, as Cummings explained, all
Athletic Department expenses for
varsity team equipment, facilities,
recruiting and coaches come from
the department itself.
"It (this system) is known techni
cally as an auxiliary enterprise," said
