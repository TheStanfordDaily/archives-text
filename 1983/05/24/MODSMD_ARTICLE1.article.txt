# Athletics Department: Auxiliary enterprise'
## NEWS 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
Many people think of football
when they think of Stanford athle
tics, but the Department of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recreation
oversees everything from intercol
legiate varsity sports to instructional
frisbee. In the next two days the Daily
will look at the department's $11 mil
lion budget operations and its schol
arship and recruiting practices.

The Department of Athletics, Phys
ical Education and Recreation is a
multi-million dollar entity bearing a
special "auxiliary enterprise" status
which allows a degree of indepen
dence from the rest of the University.
I he department's budget, which
has stabilized after several years of
growth under Athletic Director Andy
Geiger, relies on three basic
sources: income from intercol
legiate events, golf course revenues
and general University funds, ac
cording to Alan Cum mi ngs, associate
director of athletics.
The Athletic Department is some
what unique because none of the
University money it receives pays for
any of the 24 varsity programs cur
rently offered on campus, Cum

mings noted.
Sue Lem Mon, administrative as
sistant to the athletic director, said,
"It's a self-contained unit ... a self
sustaining operation."
Although the University does con
tribute more than $2 million to the
Athletic Department — money that
comes principally from students' tui
tion — this supports only
"academic" areas: physical educa
tion classes and non-intercollegiate
recreational programs.
In addition to the $2 million in Uni
versity funds, the operating budget
includes $5.5 million from intercol
legiate income, $1.4 million from the
Stanford Golf Course and more than
$1 million in miscellaneous funds,
said Cummings.
Intercollegiate income includes
gate receipts from football and bas
ketball games, revenue from conces
sions, programs and souvenirs and
proceeds from television contracts
and postseason bowl games. All this
money directly returns to the Uni
versity's intercollegiate programs,
with football receiving by far the
largest amount.
In addition, the profits from the
golf course — after maintenance of
the links is accounted for — also
support these programs.
Thus, as Cummings explained, all
Athletic Department expenses for
varsity team equipment, facilities,
recruiting and coaches come from
the department itself.
"It (this system) is known techni
cally as an auxiliary enterprise," said

ently goes to great lengths to keep
these two components of their
budget — intercollegiate income and
University funds — as separate as
possible.
Cummings stressed that University
money is used only for "the kinds of
activities that would be on a college
campus whether we had an intercol
legiate program or not" — in
tramurals, open weight rooms, in-

Tim Warner, associate provost for
the University's Office of Manage
ment and Budget. "What that means
essentially is that it c harges people or
groups for services and the income
that is generated from these events is
used" to maintain the program.
"They (auxiliary enterprises) are
businesses that are internal to the
University that operate on either a
break-even or surplus generating
basis . . . they're separate entitles
that cover their costs and pay for
these costs out of the revenues they
generate," Warner continued.
Although this set-up allows the
Athletic Department to remain
somewhat independent, Warner
maintained that "they are part of the
University, and their budget is re
viewed in its entirety."
Other auxiliary enterprises here
are Tresidder Union, housing and
food services and the University
Press Service.
The theory behind the auxiliary en
terprise system is that students who
do not benefit from the organization
are not forced to support it directly
with their tuition, Warner explained,
lust as students living off campus do
not pay for University food service,
students who are not on the football
team do not pay for road trips and
training facilities, he said.
The Athletic Department appar-

University money is used
only for 'the kinds of ac
tivities that would be on
a college campus
whether we had an in
tercollegiate program or
not/

structional classes and recreational
facilities. He said the intercollegiate
programs receive no financial sup
port from general University funds.
As associate director for business
and finance, Cummings cited the
calculations the Athletic Department

uses to divide costs. Various teams or
classes are charged for maintenance
of the facilities according to a
schedule of how much they used that
particular resource.
"All of the cost sharing is based on
utilization," said Cummings.
Thus if the varsity basketball and
volleyball teams used Maples Pavil
ion 70 percent of the time and if clas

ses occupied the remaining 30 per
cent, the intercollegiate fund would
cover 70 percent of maintenance
costs and the University's $2 million
allocation would pay for the rest.
Twenty-four varsity teams — 14
men'sand lOwomen's — areentitled

to portions of the Athletic Depart
ment's budget. For each sport,
coaches submit a budget proposal —
including equipment, travel, recruit
ing and miscellaneous costs — to
Cummings, Ceiger and their assis
tants tor review.
"Each of the coaches prepares a
budget for the following year, which
includes the number of team mem
bers and number of trips. 1 hey build
their budget and make a submission
and we review it. Ultimately we ap
prove, modify, add and delete for
each of the teams," Cummings said.
"Each coach is then responsible
for operating within his approved
budget. I don't think most of the
coaches would feel particularly con
strained by the size of their budget
. . . most understand that we don't
have money to expand programs,''
he explained. Many team budgets for
next year were held to this year's
level.
Football, with a $1.4 million dollar
operating budget this year, ex
ceeded men's basketball, the next
closest sport, by more than $1 mil
lion, according to Cummings. The
football budget represents well over
one-third of the combined budgets
of all 24 varsity sports, Cummings
said.
"I don't think that there's any
jealousy or internal misconcep
tions," said Dick lames, administra
tive assistant for the football team.
Because football brings in the most
revenue, he noted, it is only right
that some of its receipts should go to
support other intercollegiate teams.
"Football brings in a lot of money
— we wouldn't be here if football
wasn't here," assistant volleyball
coach Don Shaw said.
Shaw explained that "you submit a
budget and you still end up having to
cut back a little bit. We generally do
the best we can to come up with
some deals from equipment com
panies." In addition, the volleyball
team "solicits donations from alumni

The theory behind the auxiliary enterprise system
is that students who do not benefit from the organi
zation are not forced to support it directly with their
tuition.... Just as students living off-campus do not
pay for University food service, students who are
not on the football team do not pay for road trips
and training facilities.

and friends of the program."
Fred Sturm, head coach of men's
and women's volleyball, said that
preparing next year's budget "was a
lot easier since we were all told that
we were going to have to live with the

same" sum of money as this year,
referring to the "zero-growth" of the
Athletic Department's budget.
Like most other sports, Sturm

noted that "up to 50 percent of our
budget is for team travel." His teams
also need money for recruiting,
equipment and administrative tasks.
Dante Dettamanti, coach of the
water polo team, said that although

the water polo budget is "one of the
lowest ... it is adequate in terms of
our needs."
Still, Dettamanti is a bit concerned
because the department has decided
not to pay for housing costs that the
team will incur during September,
when pre-season practices begin.
Chris Horpel, coach of the wrestl
ing team, said, "Wrestling is funded
in a unique way." Its operating
budget relies entirely on donations,
although the team is expected to re
turn to Athletic Department funding
in two years, he said.
In addition to next year's $ 1U.6 mil
lion Athletic Department's operating
budget, there exists a separate finan
cial aid fund of more than $3 million
which is used for athletic schol
arships. Tomorrow's story examines
the scholarship and recruiting prac
tices here at the Farm.

guard, helped the women's basketball team improve this season and
chances are the Card will do even better next year.
