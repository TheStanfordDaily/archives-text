# OPINIONS
## The 						Stanford Daily Think before you sign 
### 
From the time they first learn cursive hand
writing, people seem to have a fascination with
signing their names. Or so it appears, judging
from the rash of petitions circulating campus
this spring.
Petitionism — not to be confused with
activism—is running rampant here. Three
Hoover petitions, an SSRL petition, a McClos
key petition and an anti-George Shultz petition
are gaining widespread attention. But perhaps
the University is overreacting to the importance
of these lists.
Take the first Hoover petition. Admittedly, 84
faculty signatures and more than 1500 student
signatures is quite impressive. But to put these
figures in perspective, the University boasts
more than 1200 faculty members and more than
12,000 students.
A major petition-ethics question also arises:
isn't the whole purpose behind a petition the
fact that the signer is going on the record? Yet
eight signers of the Hoover petition have cho
sen to remain anonymous.
Without question, the signers may have
inner-University political fears. Perhaps some
signers are professors who are attempting to
obtain—or already hold— a joint appointment

with the Hoover Institution. They may have
much less to lose and little to gain by going on
record against an institution as politically and
financially power-based as the Hoover Institu
tion.
Nevertheless, the signers should have con
sidered this before they signed their names.
The Hoover petition is not the only question
able effort. The SSRL petition against weapons
related research here, despite its admirable in
tent, is a poorly-worded effort. Many well
intentioned community members appear to
have blindly endorsed what they perceived as a
"no nukes" plan without thoroughly scrutiniz
ing the wording.
Petitions seem like a painless way to support a
cause. But the signers are doing more than
scribbling their names on a sheet of paper, they
are expressing a personal alliance with the aim
of the petition. It is, of course, important to
check all the terms of the alliance.
Petitions seem to carry some weight so sig
ners should treat them with respect.
Our check-writing, credit card world has
trained us to sign our names with ease. So to
prevent an epidemic of petitionitis, next time
think before you sign.
