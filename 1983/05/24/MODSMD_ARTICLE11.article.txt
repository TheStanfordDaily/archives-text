# Carter wasn't so bad after all
## 
### 
It is an axiom of American politics
that every president tends to make
his predecessor look good. Sure
enough, the rule is holding true for
President Reagan and former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter. Nowhere is this
becoming more clear than in the
field of foreign policy. Carter, de
spite his short and generally unpopu
lar tenure, was in retrospect quite a
good hand at foreign policy and this
is only now coming to be realized.
He made what was beyond doubt the
wisest American decision in Latin
America policy this century: handing
over the Panama Canal to Panama,
thereby proving that the United
States could match its high-sounding
words with deeds, and deal fairly and
generously with a small nation.
Carter succeeded in marshalling a
NATO agreement for a rebuilding of
allied forces, he negotiated the SALT
II treaty with Russia, the normaliza
tion of relations with China (a move
of far-reaching strategic implica
tions), and, of course, he secured a
peace in the 30-year-old war between
Israel and Egypt, thus making the
most important step ever toward
comprehensive peace in the Middle
East.
All in all, Carter's record adds up to
a solid success in foreign affairs,
something which should temper our
assessment of his weak and vicis
situdinal domestic policies. Presi
dential power, in fact, is far more di
rect and comprehensive in the
foreign policy field than in the
domestic field, and presidents thus
should really be judged mostly on
their foreign policy record. Such an
emphasis would not bode well for
Reagan, as he basks in the popularity
of a recovery he helped to delay for
more than a year.
Addressing the strategic area of
foreign policy, Reagan has thor
oughly botched our developing rela
tions with China, which Carter la
bored so hard to establish, and he
has broadened the foolish and irra
tional policy of "linkage" between
"Soviet behavior" and bilateral
arms-control talks, a policy Carter
only reluctantly acquiesced in.
"Linkage" is quite popular, but
that does not lessen its absurdity.
Take the Soviet invasion of Afghanis
tan, for example, which caused the
SALT II treaty to crash like a lead bal
loon in the Senate (it was already in
some trouble). Now I certainly don't
favor taking the look-the-other-way
attitude toward Afghanistan, or even
a hands-off attitude. Clearly, we
should respond, and harshly to the
invasion. The Soviets should not be
allowed to get away with this kind of
blatant imperialism. But the approp
riate context within which to "re
spond" is not arms-control talks.
The whole premise of arms
control talks is that they are worth
while on their own merits; if they
weren't we shouldn't get into them
in the first place. To break off negoti
ations, when there is a chance of
securing a mutually beneficial treaty,
simply because the Soviets did some

thing evil or distasteful, is to cut off
our nose to spite our face. We know
the Soviets are evil and imperialist
when we go into the talks; our as
sumption is that we might neverthe
less be able to secure a mutually be
neficial treaty. That makes the talks
worthwhile in and of thenselves.
Their desirability does not depend
on "Soviet behavior in general." Cut
ting off the START negotiations in the
event of a Soviet invasion of Poland,
as Reagan has threatened, might
make us feel good, but it simply
would not be a rational way of ex
pressing our sympathy for the Polish
people.
Moving on to NATO: the Institute
of Strategic Studies, a prestigious,
non-partisan study group based in
London, which follows the United
States-Soviet strategic balance and
related matters, has concluded that
for the first time since it was founded
in 1949, the NATO alliance is in
danger of breaking up. The consen
sus achieved by Carter in 1979 over
forced modernization has almost
completely disintegrated among the
European public, and their govern
ments are nervously backstepping in
response. The single most important
reason: fear of Reagan. He is the
most vehemently disliked president of
the postwar era in Europe (they like
President Nixon, hard as that may be
for us to understand.)
Instead of using his supposed
skills as a "Great Communicator" to
convince Europeans that he really
does wish to negotiate nuclear arms
reductions with the Soviets, he has
convinced them by his careless and
crude Cold War rhetoric, that he
contemplates using Europe as a
battleground for a "limited nuclear
war" which the United States could
win. The Europeans, naturally, are
not thrilled by the costs of such a
"victory." As Europeans grew tired of
sermonizing, moralistic Carter, it
was widely suggested that then-West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt
better deserved the title of "Leader
of the Western Alliance." Margaret
Thatcher, the "Iron Lady" prime
minister of Great Britain, is far and
away the best claimant to the honor
today. Reagan isn't even in the run
ning.
The President's problems in Latin
American areas are even more seri
ous. He seems intent upon regarding
the civil war in El Salvador and the
related conflicts in Nicaragua, as
simply one more front on the Iron
Curtain, as a battle between free
dom and godless communism.
Needless to say, his view of the
situation demonstrates an abysmal
ignorance of the indigenous prob
lems of the area. Take Nicaragua, for
example: it is simply beyond
Reagan's ability to comprehend that
the present leftist government of
Nicaragua is actually still popular, to
a large degree, with its people.
Reagan knows what armchair
American political scientists know:
that there will probably never be free
elections in Nicaragua, and that the
government will probably grow

steadily more oppressive and com
munized until it is just as hated as the
one in Cuba. So he simpy can't be
lieve that the Nicaraguans won't
happily throw off the Sandinistas and
welcome back the former Somocista
thugs who now pose as "freedom
fighters."
What Reagan forgets (if he ever
knew in the first place) is that for 40
years the Nicaraguans suffered
under an American-sponsored dic
tatorship in which the Somoza family
ruled Nicaragua like a personal fief,
as their own private feudalistic king
dom. When Somoza's corrupt and
oppressive dictatorship was over
thrown in 1979 and the leftist San
dinistas swept to power, the Nicara
guan people understandably wel
comed them as liberators.
The revolutionary spirit is doubt
less growing somewhat thin now, as
the Nicaraguans experience the bu
reaucratic clamp of the Sandinistas'
socialist style of government, and as
political freedoms disappear under
the flood of socialist propaganda,
but the Sandinistas still enjoy a large
reservoir of popular support and
gratitude. By writing off Nicaragua
prematurely as "another Cuba" and
barraging it with hostile and
threatening rhetoric, Reagan not
only hastens the day when it will ac
tually become another Cuba, he
alienates the Nicaraguan people as
well as their present government.
We should be giving Nicaragua
heavy economic aid, on condition of
a slowdown in their military build-up
and the materialization of free elec
tions. This would not guarantee that
Nicaragua would forsake the Soviets
as their mentors, but at least there
would be chance. Encouraging the
former National Guard thugs from
the Somoza regime in destabilizing
revolution-weary Nicaragua yet
again will only serve to unite the
Nicaraguans behind the Sandinista
government and make it that much
easier for a Cuban-style police state
to develop.
When viewed in toto, Reagan's
shortcomings in the field of foreign
policy are alarming. His ignorance of
history, his inability to analyze com
plex regional situations (such as the
one in Central America) on anything
but a comic-book "good guys vs. bad
guys" level and his inability to con
vince our allies that he is anything
but a hardline militarist combine to
make him one of the least effective
foreign affairs presidents of the
post-World War II era. It is ironic that
a president's foreign affairs succes
ses and failures tend to be over
shadowed by the domestic eco
nomy, since in foreign relations his
ability to influence matters and thus
his responsibility for their good
management is much more direct in
inescapable. At least in the realm of
foreign policy, Carter is looking bet
ter all the time.

knew in the first place) is that for 40
years the Nicaraguans suffered
under an American-sponsored dic
tatorship in which the Somoza family
ruled Nicaragua like a personal fief,
as their own private feudalistic king
dom. When Somoza's corrupt and
oppressive dictatorship was over
thrown in 1979 and the leftist San
dinistas swept to power, the Nicara
guan people understandably wel
comed them as liberators.
The revolutionary spirit is doubt
less growing somewhat thin now, as
the Nicaraguans experience the bu
reaucratic clamp of the Sandinistas'
socialist style of government, and as
political freedoms disappear under
the flood of socialist propaganda,
but the Sandinistas still enjoy a large
reservoir of popular support and
gratitude. By writing off Nicaragua
prematurely as "another Cuba" and
barraging it with hostile and
threatening rhetoric, Reagan not
only hastens the day when it will ac
tually become another Cuba, he
alienates the Nicaraguan people as
well as their present government.
We should be giving Nicaragua
heavy economic aid, on condition of
a slowdown in their military build-up
and the materialization of free elec
tions. This would not guarantee that
Nicaragua would forsake the Soviets
as their mentors, but at least there
would be chance. Encouraging the
former National Guard thugs from
the Somoza regime in destabilizing
revolution-weary Nicaragua yet
again will only serve to unite the
Nicaraguans behind the Sandinista
government and make it that much
easier for a Cuban-style police state
to develop.
When viewed in toto, Reagan's
shortcomings in the field of foreign
policy are alarming. His ignorance of
history, his inability to analyze com
plex regional situations (such as the
one in Central America) on anything
but a comic-book "good guys vs. bad
guys" level and his inability to con
vince our allies that he is anything
but a hardline militarist combine to
make him one of the least effective
foreign affairs presidents of the
post-World War II era. It is ironic that
a president's foreign affairs succes
ses and failures tend to be over
shadowed by the domestic eco

ability to influence matters and thus
his responsibility for their good

A skeptical eye
It is an axiom of American politics
that every president tends to make
his predecessor look good. Sure
enough, the rule is holding true for
President Reagan and former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter. Nowhere is this
becoming more clear than in the
field of foreign policy. Carter, de
spite his short and generally unpopu
lar tenure, was in retrospect quite a
good hand at foreign policy and this
is only now coming to be realized.
He made what was beyond doubt the
wisest American decision in Latin
America policy this century: handing
over the Panama Canal to Panama,
thereby proving that the United
States could match its high-sounding
words with deeds, and deal fairly and
generously with a small nation.
Carter succeeded in marshalling a
NATO agreement for a rebuilding of
allied forces, he negotiated the SALT
II treaty with Russia, the normaliza
tion of relations with China (a move
of far-reaching strategic implica
tions), and, of course, he secured a
peace in the 30-year-old war between
Israel and Egypt, thus making the
most important step ever toward
comprehensive peace in the Middle
East.
All in all, Carter's record adds up to
a solid success in foreign affairs,
something which should temper our
assessment of his weak and vicis
situdinal domestic policies. Presi
dential power, in fact, is far more di
rect and comprehensive in the
foreign policy field than in the
domestic field, and presidents thus
should really be judged mostly on
their foreign policy record. Such an
emphasis would not bode well for
Reagan, as he basks in the popularity
of a recovery he helped to delay for
more than a year.
Addressing the strategic area of
foreign policy, Reagan has thor
oughly botched our developing rela
tions with China, which Carter la
bored so hard to establish, and he
has broadened the foolish and irra
tional policy of "linkage" between
"Soviet behavior" and bilateral
arms-control talks, a policy Carter
only reluctantly acquiesced in.
"Linkage" is quite popular, but
that does not lessen its absurdity.
Take the Soviet invasion of Afghanis
tan, for example, which caused the
SALT II treaty to crash like a lead bal
loon in the Senate (it was already in
some trouble). Now I certainly don't
favor taking the look-the-other-way
attitude toward Afghanistan, or even
a hands-off attitude. Clearly, we
should respond, and harshly to the
invasion. The Soviets should not be
allowed to get away with this kind of
blatant imperialism. But the approp
riate context within which to "re
spond" is not arms-control talks.
The whole premise of arms
control talks is that they are worth
while on their own merits; if they
weren't we shouldn't get into them
in the first place. To break off negoti
ations, when there is a chance of
securing a mutually beneficial treaty,
simply because the Soviets did some

thing evil or distasteful, is to cut off
our nose to spite our face. We know
the Soviets are evil and imperialist
when we go into the talks; our as
sumption is that we might neverthe
less be able to secure a mutually be
neficial treaty. That makes the talks
worthwhile in and of thenselves.
Their desirability does not depend
on "Soviet behavior in general." Cut
ting off the START negotiations in the
event of a Soviet invasion of Poland,
as Reagan has threatened, might
make us feel good, but it simply
would not be a rational way of ex
pressing our sympathy for the Polish
people.
Moving on to NATO: the Institute
of Strategic Studies, a prestigious,
non-partisan study group based in
London, which follows the United
States-Soviet strategic balance and
related matters, has concluded that
for the first time since it was founded
in 1949, the NATO alliance is in
danger of breaking up. The consen
sus achieved by Carter in 1979 over
forced modernization has almost
completely disintegrated among the
European public, and their govern
ments are nervously backstepping in
response. The single most important
reason: fear of Reagan. He is the
most vehemently disliked president of
the postwar era in Europe (they like
President Nixon, hard as that may be
for us to understand.)
Instead of using his supposed
skills as a "Great Communicator" to
convince Europeans that he really
does wish to negotiate nuclear arms
reductions with the Soviets, he has
convinced them by his careless and
crude Cold War rhetoric, that he
contemplates using Europe as a
battleground for a "limited nuclear
war" which the United States could
win. The Europeans, naturally, are
not thrilled by the costs of such a
"victory." As Europeans grew tired of
sermonizing, moralistic Carter, it
was widely suggested that then-West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt
better deserved the title of "Leader
of the Western Alliance." Margaret
Thatcher, the "Iron Lady" prime
minister of Great Britain, is far and
away the best claimant to the honor
today. Reagan isn't even in the run
ning.
The President's problems in Latin
American areas are even more seri
ous. He seems intent upon regarding
the civil war in El Salvador and the
related conflicts in Nicaragua, as
simply one more front on the Iron
Curtain, as a battle between free
dom and godless communism.
Needless to say, his view of the
situation demonstrates an abysmal
ignorance of the indigenous prob
lems of the area. Take Nicaragua, for
example: it is simply beyond
Reagan's ability to comprehend that
the present leftist government of
Nicaragua is actually still popular, to
a large degree, with its people.
Reagan knows what armchair
American political scientists know:
that there will probably never be free
elections in Nicaragua, and that the
government will probably grow

steadily more oppressive and com
munized until it is just as hated as the
one in Cuba. So he simpy can't be
lieve that the Nicaraguans won't
happily throw off the Sandinistas and
welcome back the former Somocista
thugs who now pose as "freedom
fighters."
What Reagan forgets (if he ever
knew in the first place) is that for 40
years the Nicaraguans suffered

of Strategic Studies, a prestigious,
non-partisan study group based in
London, which follows the United
States-Soviet strategic balance and
related matters, has concluded that
for the first time since it was founded
in 1949, the NATO alliance is in
danger of breaking up. The consen
sus achieved by Carter in 1979 over
forced modernization has almost
completely disintegrated among the
European public, and their govern
ments are nervously backstepping in
response. The single most important
reason: fear of Reagan. He is the
most vehemently disliked president of
the postwar era in Europe (they like
President Nixon, hard as that may be
for us to understand.)
Instead of using his supposed
skills as a "Great Communicator" to
convince Europeans that he really
does wish to negotiate nuclear arms
reductions with the Soviets, he has
convinced them by his careless and
crude Cold War rhetoric, that he
contemplates using Europe as a
battleground for a "limited nuclear
war" which the United States could
win. The Europeans, naturally, are
not thrilled by the costs of such a
"victory." As Europeans grew tired of
sermonizing, moralistic Carter, it
was widely suggested that then-West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt
better deserved the title of "Leader
of the Western Alliance." Margaret
Thatcher, the "Iron Lady" prime
minister of Great Britain, is far and
away the best claimant to the honor
today. Reagan isn't even in the run
ning.
The President's problems in Latin
American areas are even more seri
ous. He seems intent upon regarding
the civil war in El Salvador and the
related conflicts in Nicaragua, as
simply one more front on the Iron
Curtain, as a battle between free
dom and godless communism.
Needless to say, his view of the
situation demonstrates an abysmal
ignorance of the indigenous prob
lems of the area. Take Nicaragua, for
example: it is simply beyond
Reagan's ability to comprehend that
the present leftist government of
Nicaragua is actually still popular, to
a large degree, with its people.
Reagan knows what armchair
American political scientists know:
that there will probably never be free
elections in Nicaragua, and that the
government will probably grow

steadily more oppressive and com
munized until it is just as hated as the
one in Cuba. So he simpy can't be
lieve that the Nicaraguans won't
happily throw off the Sandinistas and
welcome back the former Somocista
thugs who now pose as "freedom
fighters."
What Reagan forgets (if he ever
knew in the first place) is that for 40
years the Nicaraguans suffered
under an American-sponsored dic
tatorship in which the Somoza family
ruled Nicaragua like a personal fief,
as their own private feudalistic king
dom. When Somoza's corrupt and
oppressive dictatorship was over
thrown in 1979 and the leftist San
dinistas swept to power, the Nicara
guan people understandably wel
comed them as liberators.
The revolutionary spirit is doubt
less growing somewhat thin now, as
the Nicaraguans experience the bu
reaucratic clamp of the Sandinistas'
socialist style of government, and as
political freedoms disappear under
the flood of socialist propaganda,
but the Sandinistas still enjoy a large
reservoir of popular support and
gratitude. By writing off Nicaragua
prematurely as "another Cuba" and
barraging it with hostile and
threatening rhetoric, Reagan not
only hastens the day when it will ac
tually become another Cuba, he
alienates the Nicaraguan people as
well as their present government.
We should be giving Nicaragua
heavy economic aid, on condition of
a slowdown in their military build-up
and the materialization of free elec
tions. This would not guarantee that
Nicaragua would forsake the Soviets
as their mentors, but at least there
would be chance. Encouraging the
former National Guard thugs from
the Somoza regime in destabilizing
revolution-weary Nicaragua yet
again will only serve to unite the
Nicaraguans behind the Sandinista
government and make it that much
easier for a Cuban-style police state
to develop.
When viewed in toto, Reagan's
shortcomings in the field of foreign
policy are alarming. His ignorance of
history, his inability to analyze com
plex regional situations (such as the
one in Central America) on anything
but a comic-book "good guys vs. bad
guys" level and his inability to con
vince our allies that he is anything
but a hardline militarist combine to
make him one of the least effective
foreign affairs presidents of the
post-World War II era. It is ironic that
a president's foreign affairs succes
ses and failures tend to be over
shadowed by the domestic eco
nomy, since in foreign relations his
ability to influence matters and thus
his responsibility for their good
management is much more direct in
inescapable. At least in the realm of
foreign policy, Carter is looking bet
ter all the time.
