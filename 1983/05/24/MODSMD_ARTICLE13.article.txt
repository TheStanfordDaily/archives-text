## Defeat incompetent incorporators 
### 
The fundamental issue in the incorporation of East
Palo Alto (EPA) is not "Should the people have a direct
voice in the government that makes decisions affecting
their daily life" as stated by Paul Baer (Daily, May 11).
Certainly no one would dare raise a voice in opposition
to motherhood — except the unwilling pregnant
woman, who alone and on her own must face many
problems, including money.
The perspective of students residing in EPA are not the
same as those of permanent homeowners and long-term
residents. Many of us, who oppose incorporation, have
lived in EPA for over 25 years. We are guided by our
inside knowledge of EPA and its people. We are guided
by our practical needs and not by abstract slogans,
which when applied to EPA may eventually lead to disas
ter, for it would further isolate us and lock us into a poor,
segregated, minority enclave.
We are a community of largely poor blacks, whites,
latinos and Asians. We have 6 percent of the population
of San Mateo County but 30 percent of its welfare cases.
We have at least 60 percent youth unemployment and 25
percent adult unemployment. We have many one par
ent households. We have open drug traffic and
crime. Changing the form of local government will have
little effect on these problems, for the problems result
from factors beyond the borders of EPA.
Can a small city, many of whose people are at or near
poverty level, overcome these larger problems by the
simple act of incorporating the area — an area that has
little or no industrial, commercial or sales-tax revenue
generating tax base?
The leaders of incorporation apparently believe that
incorporation, per se, would solve our problems if only
they were given power. Power comes not from wishful
thinking or slogans. Power comes from money and the
ability to manage money successfully plus knowledge
able and capable leadership. EPA has little money that is
generated by its own tax base. The leaders who push
incorporation now were totally ineffective when they
held positions of leadership in the Municipal Council,
the school district, the senior center. Why should we
have confidence or trust in them now?
We cannot blame the impotency of the Municipal
Council on its inability to make final decisions. Of the
proposals they have submitted, 95 percent have been
approved by the board of supervisors. Therefore the
responsibility for the lack of progress in EPA belongs to
the Municipal Council itself. Three candidates on the
pro-incorporation slate are or have been council mem
bers.
The contention that EPA cannot be serviced from gov
ernmental headquarters 15 minutes away is an absurdity
on the face of it. Look at the combined city and county of

San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and many other
jurisdictions. The board of supervisors wants to save
money and sever its responsibility for us. The incorpora
tionists seek power for themselves.
We have had local autonomy and control for years.
The sanitary district, the recreation district, the school
district are all elected locally. They exercise full control
to make and carry out their decisions, including expen
diture of funds. The recreation district and the school
district have for years been plagued with open quarrels
and scandals that have resulted in failure to perform
their duties and have wasted our tax dollars.
The financial viability of a new city of EPA has been the
center of our concerns. Statistics can be manipulated to
prove almost anything. Therefore I shall simply quote
from county staff.
lay Gellert, former assistant county manager, re
ported to the Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCo) on Oct. 13, 1981: "Over $2.2 million of county
wide revenue are utilized to subsidize services in EPA
and it will become increasingly difficult in future years
for the county to maintain this level of subsidy in face of
federal and state budget reductions." But, he urges the
incorporation of EPA!
Angus McDonald, consultant, stated to LAFCo, jan.
12,1983: "The first thing we considered was whether the
area was currently supporting the municipal services
. . . provided by the county. But, in fact, the area is not.
Costs exceed revenue ... by over $1 million for munici
pal services alone."
Taxpayers in Menlo Park and Atherton subsidize fire
protection in EPA by over $400,000. Will it continue?
"A positive fund balance after incorporation,"
McDonald warns, "is vulnerable to unforeseen events
... so that the fund balance can be reduced or possibly
eliminated."
At best, the new city would be walking a financial tight
rope from which it could easioy fall and fail, forcing us to
pay increased taxes or accepting lower services than
now.
None of the leaders pushing incorporation, hoping to
be elected, can show from previous positions of leader
ship that they have the knowledge, capability and integ
rity to effectively manage a city. We reject their cry for
power. We reject incorporation for our community until
an adequate tax base is built and leadership developed
and proven.
We hope the students will understand the dilemma of
the unwilling pregnant woman who believes in Mother
hood in principle but not for herself. We ask the stu
dents to help us by voting against incorporation.

The contention that EPA cannot be serviced from gov
ernmental headquarters 15 minutes away is an absurdity
on the face of it. Look at the combined city and county of

San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and many other
jurisdictions. The board of supervisors wants to save
money and sever its responsibility for us. The incorpora
tionists seek power for themselves.
We have had local autonomy and control for years.
The sanitary district, the recreation district, the school
district are all elected locally. They exercise full control
to make and carry out their decisions, including expen
diture of funds. The recreation district and the school
district have for years been plagued with open quarrels
and scandals that have resulted in failure to perform
their duties and have wasted our tax dollars.
The financial viability of a new city of EPA has been the
center of our concerns. Statistics can be manipulated to
prove almost anything. Therefore I shall simply quote
from county staff.
lay Gellert, former assistant county manager, re
ported to the Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCo) on Oct. 13, 1981: "Over $2.2 million of county
wide revenue are utilized to subsidize services in EPA
and it will become increasingly difficult in future years
for the county to maintain this level of subsidy in face of
federal and state budget reductions." But, he urges the
incorporation of EPA!
Angus McDonald, consultant, stated to LAFCo, jan.
12,1983: "The first thing we considered was whether the
area was currently supporting the municipal services
. . . provided by the county. But, in fact, the area is not.
Costs exceed revenue ... by over $1 million for munici
pal services alone."
Taxpayers in Menlo Park and Atherton subsidize fire
protection in EPA by over $400,000. Will it continue?
"A positive fund balance after incorporation,"
McDonald warns, "is vulnerable to unforeseen events
... so that the fund balance can be reduced or possibly
eliminated."
At best, the new city would be walking a financial tight
rope from which it could easioy fall and fail, forcing us to
pay increased taxes or accepting lower services than
now.
None of the leaders pushing incorporation, hoping to
be elected, can show from previous positions of leader
ship that they have the knowledge, capability and integ
rity to effectively manage a city. We reject their cry for
power. We reject incorporation for our community until
an adequate tax base is built and leadership developed
and proven.
We hope the students will understand the dilemma of
the unwilling pregnant woman who believes in Mother
hood in principle but not for herself. We ask the stu
dents to help us by voting against incorporation.

The fundamental issue in the incorporation of East
Palo Alto (EPA) is not "Should the people have a direct
voice in the government that makes decisions affecting
their daily life" as stated by Paul Baer (Daily, May 11).
Certainly no one would dare raise a voice in opposition
to motherhood — except the unwilling pregnant
woman, who alone and on her own must face many
problems, including money.
The perspective of students residing in EPA are not the
same as those of permanent homeowners and long-term
residents. Many of us, who oppose incorporation, have
lived in EPA for over 25 years. We are guided by our
inside knowledge of EPA and its people. We are guided
by our practical needs and not by abstract slogans,
which when applied to EPA may eventually lead to disas
ter, for it would further isolate us and lock us into a poor,
segregated, minority enclave.
We are a community of largely poor blacks, whites,
latinos and Asians. We have 6 percent of the population
of San Mateo County but 30 percent of its welfare cases.
We have at least 60 percent youth unemployment and 25
percent adult unemployment. We have many one par
ent households. We have open drug traffic and
crime. Changing the form of local government will have
little effect on these problems, for the problems result
from factors beyond the borders of EPA.
Can a small city, many of whose people are at or near
poverty level, overcome these larger problems by the
simple act of incorporating the area — an area that has
little or no industrial, commercial or sales-tax revenue
generating tax base?
The leaders of incorporation apparently believe that
incorporation, per se, would solve our problems if only
they were given power. Power comes not from wishful
thinking or slogans. Power comes from money and the
ability to manage money successfully plus knowledge
able and capable leadership. EPA has little money that is
generated by its own tax base. The leaders who push
incorporation now were totally ineffective when they
held positions of leadership in the Municipal Council,
the school district, the senior center. Why should we
have confidence or trust in them now?
We cannot blame the impotency of the Municipal
Council on its inability to make final decisions. Of the
proposals they have submitted, 95 percent have been
approved by the board of supervisors. Therefore the
responsibility for the lack of progress in EPA belongs to
the Municipal Council itself. Three candidates on the
pro-incorporation slate are or have been council mem
bers.
