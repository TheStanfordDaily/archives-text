## Fair questions 
### 
In your May 16 issue, Political Sci
ence Prof. John Manley is quoted as
saying: "I am saying in the name of
academic freedom—ask questions
(about Hoover's political partisan
ship). Juilland is saying, in the name
of academic freedom—don't ask."
This is not what juilland is saying.
What Juilland is saying is: "Ask all the
questions you wish, but do not ask
them in a discriminatory fashion."
Let me explain. The Marchesa's
diamond-studded necklace has dis
appeared while she was having din
ner with her distinguished guests.
Chief Detective Manley, who hap
pens to be one of them, takes the
investigation over: "All of you ladies
and gentlemen, go to your rooms
and take a nap, while you Campbell,
spread against the wall, 'cause I'm
gonna give you a thorough body
search."
What I am saying is that in nearly a
quarter of a century of peregrina
tions around the Quad, I have seen an
abundance of liberal bias. If we are to
investigate political partisanship, by
all means, let's do so. But the investi
gation should not be restricted to
conservatives: liberals also qualify.
