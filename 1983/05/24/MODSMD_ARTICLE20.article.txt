## The
						manic screwball comedies of Preston Sturges 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
"The first impression one
gets from a Sturges movie is
that of the inside of a Ford as
sembly line smashed together
and operating during a total
war crisis. The characters, all
exuding jaundice, cynicism,
and anxiety, work feverishly as
every moment brings them the
fear that their lives are going to
pieces, that they are going to
be fired, murdered, emascu
lated or trapped in such
ridiculous situations that head
lines will scream about them to
a hooting nation for the rest of
their lives." Manny Farber
and W.S. Poster, Preston
Sturges: Success in the Movies,
1954.
One memorable night when
I was a senior at Brandeis Uni
versity, two friends and I sat
down in front of a tiny portable
TV in a dorm room to watch a
late-night showing of a fairly
obscure 1937 screwball com
edy called Easy Living, starring
lean Arthur and Ray Mi Hand. In
the opening minutes of the
film we saw the following
oddball encounters: (1) A mil
lionaire (Edward Arnold) trips
of the top step of an enormous
staircase and tumbles straight
down to the feet of a deadpan
butler (Robert Creig), who
quips, without missing a beat,
"Down early to breakfast this
morning sir?" (2) Enraged by
the extravagances of his
spoiled wife, (Mary Nash), Ar
nold flings her latest fur coat
from the roof of her penthouse
apartment. (3) The coat lands
on the head of a young woman
(Arthur) traveling on the top
level of double-decker bus.
Furious, she whips around to
confront the man she assumes
to be her assailant—the inno
cent occupant of the seat be
hing her own— "Hey!" she
calls to him. But he turns out to
be a turbaned mystic, his head
buried in a book; he looks up
at her and whispers, "Kismet!"
Before five minutes of Easy
Living had elapsed, the three of
us were helpless with laughter
and in peril of arousing the
wrath of our sleeping
neighbors. We continued
laughing, almost without inter
ruption, for an hour and a

half—gasping for air through
the automat scene, the first
meeting of the lovers-to-be,
Arthur and Ray Milland,
wherein he (an automat who is
in reality the millionaire's son)
pities her poverty and rigs the
slots to release their little pack
ages of food for free, pre
cipitating a near-riot among
the hungry customers. And
though I haven't seen Easy Liv
ing since that night over a dec
ade ago, these and other se
quences in it are more vivid in
my memory than many pic
tures I saw — and wrote
about—last year.
This gem of a movie, perhaps
the most outrageous of the
Depression comedies, ought
to be a classic, revived as often
as It Happened One Night, and
Bringing Up Baby. It is one the

early examples of the genius of
Preston Sturges, perhaps the
most gifted comic writer
director since the coming of
sound, to whom the Castro
Theater in San Francisco dedi
cated a film festival throught
May 31.
Preston Sturges, dubbed by
Manny Farber and W.S. Poster
"the most spectacular man
ipulator of sheer humor since
Mark Twain," spent his pre
theatrical days, in the 19205,
running his mother's business
and inventing things; when he
became a writer in 1929, he
simply transferred his preoc
cupations with invention and
business and the American
drive for success to theater and
film.
His first play, The Guinea
Pig, created no stir, but the
popularity of his second,
Strictly Dishonorable, swept

Sturges to Hollywood like
many another celebrated New
York playwright in the despa
rate early days of the talkies.
Strictly Dishonorable made it
to Hollywood, too—it was
filmed in 1931 with Paul Lukas,
and again, in a messed-up mus
ical version in 1951 with Ezio
Pinza. (Sturges did not collabo
rate on either of these pic
tures.) While employed at
Paramount, penning dialogue
for undistinguished efforts like
the Maurice Chevalier-
Claudette Colbert musical The
Big Pond, he continued to
write plays; no one in Hol
lywood noticed him much un
til, in 1953, Fox Studios bought
his screenplay, The Power and
the Glory, a flashback-collage
treatment of the life of a tycoon
(piayed by Spencer Tracy)
which anticipated the tech
nique Herman Mankiewicz
would use in his screenplay for
Citizen Kane eight years later.
He spent the rest of the dec
ade as a successful
screenwriter, working on a
variety of projects. (Among
them: We Live Again, based on
Tolstoy's Resurrection; the pe
rennial Fannie Hurst weeper,
Imitation of Life; William
Wyler's The Good Fairy, out of
a Ferenc Molnar play;
Diamond Jim, starring Edward
Arnold, and Easy Living and
Remember the Night, both di
rected by Paramount's most
light-handed hack, Mitchell
Leisen.) In 1940, he wrote a
political satire called The Great
McCinty and pursuaded Wil
liam Leßaron, Paramount's
production chief, to let him di
rect it himself on condition that
he receive a much smaller sal
ary than usual. (According to
James Ursini, auther of The
Fabulous Life and Times of Pre
ston Sturges, An American
Dreamer, Sturges drew down
somewhere between $1000
and $2500 a week when he was
working on a script, and so the
frugal Leßaron couldn't resist
the offer.) The resultant pic
ture made money and won an
Academy Award for Best Orig
inal Screenplay—and no one
else but Sturges ever directed
one of his scripts again.
