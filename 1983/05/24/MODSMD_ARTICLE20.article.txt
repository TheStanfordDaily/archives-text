## The 						manic screwball comedies of Preston Sturges 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
"The first impression one
gets from a Sturges movie is
that of the inside of a Ford as
sembly line smashed together
and operating during a total
war crisis. The characters, all
exuding jaundice, cynicism,
and anxiety, work feverishly as
every moment brings them the
fear that their lives are going to
pieces, that they are going to
be fired, murdered, emascu
lated or trapped in such
ridiculous situations that head
lines will scream about them to
a hooting nation for the rest of
their lives." Manny Farber
and W.S. Poster, Preston
Sturges: Success in the Movies,
1954.
One memorable night when
I was a senior at Brandeis Uni
versity, two friends and I sat
down in front of a tiny portable
TV in a dorm room to watch a
late-night showing of a fairly
obscure 1937 screwball com
edy called Easy Living, starring
lean Arthur and Ray Mi Hand. In
the opening minutes of the
film we saw the following
oddball encounters: (1) A mil
lionaire (Edward Arnold) trips
of the top step of an enormous
staircase and tumbles straight
down to the feet of a deadpan
butler (Robert Creig), who
quips, without missing a beat,
"Down early to breakfast this
morning sir?" (2) Enraged by
the extravagances of his
spoiled wife, (Mary Nash), Ar
nold flings her latest fur coat
from the roof of her penthouse
apartment. (3) The coat lands
on the head of a young woman
(Arthur) traveling on the top
level of double-decker bus.
Furious, she whips around to
confront the man she assumes
to be her assailant—the inno
cent occupant of the seat be
hing her own— "Hey!" she
calls to him. But he turns out to
be a turbaned mystic, his head
buried in a book; he looks up
at her and whispers, "Kismet!"
Before five minutes of Easy
Living had elapsed, the three of
us were helpless with laughter
and in peril of arousing the
wrath of our sleeping
neighbors. We continued
laughing, almost without inter
ruption, for an hour and a

half—gasping for air through
the automat scene, the first
meeting of the lovers-to-be,
Arthur and Ray Milland,
wherein he (an automat who is
in reality the millionaire's son)
pities her poverty and rigs the
slots to release their little pack
ages of food for free, pre
cipitating a near-riot among
the hungry customers. And
though I haven't seen Easy Liv
ing since that night over a dec
ade ago, these and other se
quences in it are more vivid in
my memory than many pic
tures I saw — and wrote
about—last year.
This gem of a movie, perhaps
the most outrageous of the
Depression comedies, ought
to be a classic, revived as often
as It Happened One Night, and

early examples of the genius of
Preston Sturges, perhaps the
most gifted comic writer
director since the coming of
sound, to whom the Castro
Theater in San Francisco dedi
cated a film festival throught
May 31.
Preston Sturges, dubbed by
Manny Farber and W.S. Poster
"the most spectacular man
ipulator of sheer humor since
Mark Twain," spent his pre
theatrical days, in the 19205,
running his mother's business
and inventing things; when he
became a writer in 1929, he
simply transferred his preoc
cupations with invention and
business and the American
drive for success to theater and
film.
His first play, The Guinea
Pig, created no stir, but the
popularity of his second,
Strictly Dishonorable, swept

Sturges to Hollywood like
many another celebrated New
York playwright in the despa
rate early days of the talkies.
Strictly Dishonorable made it
to Hollywood, too—it was
filmed in 1931 with Paul Lukas,
and again, in a messed-up mus
ical version in 1951 with Ezio
Pinza. (Sturges did not collabo
rate on either of these pic
tures.) While employed at
Paramount, penning dialogue
for undistinguished efforts like
the Maurice Chevalier-
Claudette Colbert musical The
Big Pond, he continued to
write plays; no one in Hol
lywood noticed him much un
til, in 1953, Fox Studios bought
his screenplay, The Power and
the Glory, a flashback-collage
treatment of the life of a tycoon
(piayed by Spencer Tracy)
which anticipated the tech
nique Herman Mankiewicz
would use in his screenplay for
Citizen Kane eight years later.
He spent the rest of the dec
ade as a successful
screenwriter, working on a
variety of projects. (Among
them: We Live Again, based on
Tolstoy's Resurrection; the pe
rennial Fannie Hurst weeper,
Imitation of Life; William
Wyler's The Good Fairy, out of
a Ferenc Molnar play;
Diamond Jim, starring Edward
Arnold, and Easy Living and
Remember the Night, both di
rected by Paramount's most
light-handed hack, Mitchell
Leisen.) In 1940, he wrote a
political satire called The Great
McCinty and pursuaded Wil
liam Leßaron, Paramount's
production chief, to let him di
rect it himself on condition that
he receive a much smaller sal
ary than usual. (According to
James Ursini, auther of The
Fabulous Life and Times of Pre
ston Sturges, An American
Dreamer, Sturges drew down
somewhere between $1000
and $2500 a week when he was
working on a script, and so the
frugal Leßaron couldn't resist
the offer.) The resultant pic
ture made money and won an
Academy Award for Best Orig
inal Screenplay—and no one
else but Sturges ever directed
one of his scripts again.

Preston Sturges
Sturges' immediate success
as a director was not to be
wondered at. Anyone who
could design the automat se
quence in Easy Living clearly
had a fine eye, and it didn't
take Sturges long to develop a
strong individual style—The
Great McCinty is a bit stolid,
but Christmas in luly, released
later the same year, contains
the first instances of the blend
of manic humor and precise,
stinging satire that would be
come the Sturges trademark.
The talkies had begun in
1927, but it took more than a
decade for American movies to
attain the wedding of sight and
sound that was the dream of
visionaries of the late '20s. It is
perhaps no mere coincidence
that film historians link The
Power and the Glory and Citi
zen Kane, or that Kane in its
time the greatest achievement
in American pictures since the
late days of the silents, came
out just as Preston Sturges was
turning into a first-rate di
rector. And, as James Agee
pointed out, it seemed a singu
larly appropriate notion for
Sturges and the great silent
comic Harold Lloyd to marry
their talents inthe 1947 Mad
Wednesday, (also known as
The Sin of Harold Diddlebock),
a satire on the Horatio Alger
success stories Lloyed made in
the '20s. (The movie, which

it—on the whole, it's better

When Farber and Poster
compare Sturges to Mark

Twain, they are speaking not
only of the force of his humor,
but of its content as well. The
best of his movies, Hail the
Conquering Hero and the
commercially unsuccessful
Unfaithfully Yours, are so sav
agely satirical that they suggest
a home-grown Luis Bunuel. In

ments, one imagines, that
could not be easily tumbled
with impunity in 1944. Eddie
Bracken plays a young man,
the son of a war hero who has
been rejected by the Marines
because he has hay fever;
when he confides his troubles
to a crew of Marines in a bar,
they adopt him and bring him
home to his mother in the
guise of a battle-scarred
champion. Conquering Hero
marched triumphantly past the
censors, but The Miracle of
Morgan's Creek, made more
than a year earlier, had a rough
journey and was in fact held up
until 1944 because it was felt
that the story —about a preg
nant woman (Betty Huttcn)
who traps and innocent dupe
(Bracken again) into marrying
her—violated the Production
Code.
Iconoclast though he was,
Sturges was not immune to

sentimentality: it mars the sec
ond half of The Great McCinty
and much of Sullivan's Travels,
which many critics consider his
most important film (probably
because )oel McCrea plays a
movie director in it, with some
Sturgesian characteristics).
Sullivan's Travels isn't an easy
film to forget, however—it's
one of a kind, and some of it is
genuinely moving despite its
heavy-handedness. John Sulli
van, the filmmaker-hero, de
cides to dump his career as
supplier of crowd pleasers like
Hey Hey in the Hayloft and
Ants in the Plants of 1939 in
favor of making socially con
scious dramas like the proj
ected Brother, Where Art Thou?
In order to research his
subject — the life of the
hobo—Sullivan sets out to im
personate one. But his studio
trails him everywhere he goes,
and it isn't until he is knocked
out and robbed by a real tramp,
wakes up with amnesia and
lands himself on the chain
gang, that he learns that he can
best serve the underprivileged
of this country by making them
laugh.
A glance at the plots of
Sturges' movies reveals what
amazingly ingenious narrative
skills he possessed. The final
twist of The Palm Beach Story
makes movie lovers smile in
recollection for years after
wards. In Unfaithfully Yours, a
conductor (wonderfully played
by Rex Harrison) dreams of
murdering his wife (Linda Dar
nell) in fantasy scenes scored
in the music of Rossini,
Wagner and Tchaikowsky. And
perhaps no one since Sturges
has shown such joyous facility
with the English language. Un
faithfully Yours has a Noel
Coward-like deftness, and in
other movies, (Christmas in
luly, Mad Wednesday) Sturges
sets the cliches against each
other and pushes and pulls

them in so many directions that
he seems to have practically in
vented a new jargon. (Listen to
the exchange between Harold
Lloyd and Jimmy Conlan in
Mad Wednesday, in which
Conlan tries to persuade Lloyd
to drink his first alcoholic bev
erage.) The dramatis personae
of the Sturges canon abounds
with such names as Mayor Til
linghast, Mr. Hillbeiner, John
D. Hackensacker 111, Trudy and
Emmy Kockenlocker, Wallace
Whistling. Lee Leander, Luisa
Cingleb u she r, Woodrow
Truesmith, E.J. Waggleberry
and Formlift Franklyn. As for
his dialogue, perhaps I can
best explain why some of us
consider his a peerless
humorist by furnishing a few
samples:
Betty Crable: "You'd sell
your grandmother for a
hundred dollars."
Cesar Romero: "That's an
entirely different matter. She's
almost 80 and not at all well

"He was made for it —as the
ox was made to be eaten."
"You not only make the
same mistakes year after year,
you don't even change your
apologies."—Raymond Wal
burn to Harold Lloyd, Mad
Wednesday.
In their excellent article,
Farber and Poster describe the
characters in Sturges' films as
"too perfectly adjusted to life
to require minds, and, in place
of hearts, they seem to contain
an old scratch sheet, a glob of
tobacco juice, or a brown
banana. . . their faces—each
of which is a succulent worm's
festival, bulbous with sheer
living —. . . are eternally,
agelessly human, over
socialized to the point where
any normal animal component
has vanished." And he had a
stock company ideally suited
to embody these worn bits of
humanity.
As pleasurably as we re
member Henry Fonda and Bar
bara Stanwyck in The Lady Eve,
Joel McCrea and Claudette
Colbert in The Palm Beach
Story, we recall the supporting
players—William Demarest,
Rudy Vallee, Jimmy Conlan,
Raymond Walburn, Franklin
Pangborn, Torben Meyer, Al
Bridge, Vic Potel, Eric Blore,
Robert Creig, Julius Tannen,
Porter Hall, and a couple
dozen others—whose amazing
faces show up in one Sturges
comedy after another. Theyare
the completion of his crazy,
convoluted dialogue, his tall
tales, his unique satiric vision.
"The first impression one
gets from a Sturges movie is
that of the inside of a Ford as
sembly line smashed together
and operating during a total
war crisis. The characters, all
exuding jaundice, cynicism,
and anxiety, work feverishly as

early examples of the genius of
Preston Sturges, perhaps the
most gifted comic writer
director since the coming of
sound, to whom the Castro
Theater in San Francisco dedi
cated a film festival throught
May 31.
Preston Sturges, dubbed by
Manny Farber and W.S. Poster
"the most spectacular man
ipulator of sheer humor since
Mark Twain," spent his pre
theatrical days, in the 19205,
running his mother's business
and inventing things; when he
became a writer in 1929, he
simply transferred his preoc
cupations with invention and
business and the American
drive for success to theater and
film.
His first play, The Guinea
Pig, created no stir, but the
popularity of his second,
Strictly Dishonorable, swept

Sturges to Hollywood like
many another celebrated New
York playwright in the despa
rate early days of the talkies.
Strictly Dishonorable made it
to Hollywood, too—it was
filmed in 1931 with Paul Lukas,
and again, in a messed-up mus
ical version in 1951 with Ezio
Pinza. (Sturges did not collabo
rate on either of these pic
tures.) While employed at
Paramount, penning dialogue
for undistinguished efforts like
the Maurice Chevalier-
Claudette Colbert musical The
Big Pond, he continued to
write plays; no one in Hol
lywood noticed him much un
til, in 1953, Fox Studios bought
his screenplay, The Power and
the Glory, a flashback-collage
treatment of the life of a tycoon
(piayed by Spencer Tracy)
which anticipated the tech
nique Herman Mankiewicz
would use in his screenplay for
Citizen Kane eight years later.
He spent the rest of the dec
ade as a successful
screenwriter, working on a
variety of projects. (Among
them: We Live Again, based on
Tolstoy's Resurrection; the pe
rennial Fannie Hurst weeper,
Imitation of Life; William
Wyler's The Good Fairy, out of
a Ferenc Molnar play;
Diamond Jim, starring Edward
Arnold, and Easy Living and
Remember the Night, both di
rected by Paramount's most
light-handed hack, Mitchell
Leisen.) In 1940, he wrote a
political satire called The Great
McCinty and pursuaded Wil
liam Leßaron, Paramount's
production chief, to let him di
rect it himself on condition that
he receive a much smaller sal
ary than usual. (According to
James Ursini, auther of The
Fabulous Life and Times of Pre
ston Sturges, An American
Dreamer, Sturges drew down
somewhere between $1000
and $2500 a week when he was
working on a script, and so the
frugal Leßaron couldn't resist
the offer.) The resultant pic
ture made money and won an
Academy Award for Best Orig
inal Screenplay—and no one
else but Sturges ever directed
one of his scripts again.

Preston Sturges
Sturges' immediate success
as a director was not to be
wondered at. Anyone who
could design the automat se
quence in Easy Living clearly
had a fine eye, and it didn't
take Sturges long to develop a
strong individual style—The
Great McCinty is a bit stolid,
but Christmas in luly, released
later the same year, contains
the first instances of the blend
of manic humor and precise,
stinging satire that would be
come the Sturges trademark.
The talkies had begun in
1927, but it took more than a
decade for American movies to
attain the wedding of sight and
sound that was the dream of
visionaries of the late '20s. It is
perhaps no mere coincidence
that film historians link The
Power and the Glory and Citi
zen Kane, or that Kane in its
time the greatest achievement
in American pictures since the
late days of the silents, came
out just as Preston Sturges was
turning into a first-rate di
rector. And, as James Agee
pointed out, it seemed a singu
larly appropriate notion for
Sturges and the great silent
comic Harold Lloyd to marry
their talents inthe 1947 Mad
Wednesday, (also known as
The Sin of Harold Diddlebock),
a satire on the Horatio Alger
success stories Lloyed made in
the '20s. (The movie, which

ments, one imagines, that
could not be easily tumbled
with impunity in 1944. Eddie
Bracken plays a young man,
the son of a war hero who has
been rejected by the Marines
because he has hay fever;
when he confides his troubles
to a crew of Marines in a bar,
they adopt him and bring him
home to his mother in the
guise of a battle-scarred
champion. Conquering Hero
marched triumphantly past the
censors, but The Miracle of
Morgan's Creek, made more
than a year earlier, had a rough
journey and was in fact held up
until 1944 because it was felt
that the story —about a preg
nant woman (Betty Huttcn)
who traps and innocent dupe
(Bracken again) into marrying
her—violated the Production
Code.
Iconoclast though he was,
Sturges was not immune to

sentimentality: it mars the sec
ond half of The Great McCinty
and much of Sullivan's Travels,
which many critics consider his
most important film (probably
because )oel McCrea plays a
movie director in it, with some
Sturgesian characteristics).
Sullivan's Travels isn't an easy
film to forget, however—it's
one of a kind, and some of it is
genuinely moving despite its
heavy-handedness. John Sulli
van, the filmmaker-hero, de
cides to dump his career as
supplier of crowd pleasers like
Hey Hey in the Hayloft and
Ants in the Plants of 1939 in
favor of making socially con
scious dramas like the proj
ected Brother, Where Art Thou?
In order to research his
subject — the life of the
hobo—Sullivan sets out to im
personate one. But his studio
trails him everywhere he goes,
and it isn't until he is knocked
out and robbed by a real tramp,
wakes up with amnesia and
lands himself on the chain
gang, that he learns that he can
best serve the underprivileged
of this country by making them
laugh.
A glance at the plots of
Sturges' movies reveals what
amazingly ingenious narrative
skills he possessed. The final
twist of The Palm Beach Story
makes movie lovers smile in
recollection for years after
wards. In Unfaithfully Yours, a
conductor (wonderfully played
by Rex Harrison) dreams of
murdering his wife (Linda Dar
nell) in fantasy scenes scored
in the music of Rossini,
Wagner and Tchaikowsky. And
perhaps no one since Sturges
has shown such joyous facility
with the English language. Un
faithfully Yours has a Noel
Coward-like deftness, and in
other movies, (Christmas in
luly, Mad Wednesday) Sturges
sets the cliches against each
other and pushes and pulls

them in so many directions that
he seems to have practically in
vented a new jargon. (Listen to
the exchange between Harold
Lloyd and Jimmy Conlan in
Mad Wednesday, in which
Conlan tries to persuade Lloyd
to drink his first alcoholic bev
erage.) The dramatis personae
of the Sturges canon abounds
with such names as Mayor Til

Emmy Kockenlocker, Wallace
Whistling. Lee Leander, Luisa

and Formlift Franklyn. As for
his dialogue, perhaps I can
best explain why some of us
consider his a peerless
humorist by furnishing a few
samples:

your grandmother for a
hundred dollars."

In their excellent article,
Farber and Poster describe the
characters in Sturges' films as
"too perfectly adjusted to life
to require minds, and, in place
of hearts, they seem to contain
an old scratch sheet, a glob of
tobacco juice, or a brown
banana. . . their faces—each
of which is a succulent worm's

Bridge, Vic Potel, Eric Blore,
Robert Creig, Julius Tannen,
Porter Hall, and a couple
dozen others—whose amazing
faces show up in one Sturges
comedy after another. Theyare
the completion of his crazy,
convoluted dialogue, his tall
tales, his unique satiric vision.
"The first impression one
gets from a Sturges movie is
that of the inside of a Ford as
sembly line smashed together
and operating during a total
war crisis. The characters, all
exuding jaundice, cynicism,
and anxiety, work feverishly as
every moment brings them the
fear that their lives are going to
pieces, that they are going to
be fired, murdered, emascu
lated or trapped in such
ridiculous situations that head
lines will scream about them to
a hooting nation for the rest of
their lives." Manny Farber

I was a senior at Brandeis Uni
versity, two friends and I sat
down in front of a tiny portable
TV in a dorm room to watch a
late-night showing of a fairly
obscure 1937 screwball com
edy called Easy Living, starring
lean Arthur and Ray Mi Hand. In
the opening minutes of the
film we saw the following
oddball encounters: (1) A mil
lionaire (Edward Arnold) trips
of the top step of an enormous
staircase and tumbles straight
down to the feet of a deadpan
butler (Robert Creig), who
quips, without missing a beat,
"Down early to breakfast this
morning sir?" (2) Enraged by
the extravagances of his
spoiled wife, (Mary Nash), Ar
nold flings her latest fur coat
from the roof of her penthouse
apartment. (3) The coat lands
on the head of a young woman
(Arthur) traveling on the top
level of double-decker bus.
Furious, she whips around to
confront the man she assumes
to be her assailant—the inno
cent occupant of the seat be

calls to him. But he turns out to
be a turbaned mystic, his head

cupations with invention and
business and the American
drive for success to theater and
film.
His first play, The Guinea
Pig, created no stir, but the
popularity of his second,
Strictly Dishonorable, swept

Sturges to Hollywood like
many another celebrated New

rate early days of the talkies.
Strictly Dishonorable made it
to Hollywood, too—it was
filmed in 1931 with Paul Lukas,
and again, in a messed-up mus
ical version in 1951 with Ezio
Pinza. (Sturges did not collabo
rate on either of these pic
tures.) While employed at
Paramount, penning dialogue
for undistinguished efforts like
the Maurice Chevalier-
Claudette Colbert musical The
Big Pond, he continued to
write plays; no one in Hol
lywood noticed him much un
til, in 1953, Fox Studios bought
his screenplay, The Power and
the Glory, a flashback-collage
treatment of the life of a tycoon
(piayed by Spencer Tracy)
which anticipated the tech
nique Herman Mankiewicz
would use in his screenplay for
Citizen Kane eight years later.
He spent the rest of the dec
ade as a successful
screenwriter, working on a
variety of projects. (Among
them: We Live Again, based on
Tolstoy's Resurrection; the pe
rennial Fannie Hurst weeper,
Imitation of Life; William
Wyler's The Good Fairy, out of
a Ferenc Molnar play;
Diamond Jim, starring Edward
Arnold, and Easy Living and
Remember the Night, both di
rected by Paramount's most
light-handed hack, Mitchell
Leisen.) In 1940, he wrote a
political satire called The Great
McCinty and pursuaded Wil
liam Leßaron, Paramount's
production chief, to let him di
rect it himself on condition that
he receive a much smaller sal
ary than usual. (According to
James Ursini, auther of The
Fabulous Life and Times of Pre
ston Sturges, An American
Dreamer, Sturges drew down
somewhere between $1000
and $2500 a week when he was
working on a script, and so the
frugal Leßaron couldn't resist
the offer.) The resultant pic
ture made money and won an
Academy Award for Best Orig
inal Screenplay—and no one
else but Sturges ever directed
one of his scripts again.

Preston Sturges
Sturges' immediate success
as a director was not to be
wondered at. Anyone who
could design the automat se
quence in Easy Living clearly
had a fine eye, and it didn't
take Sturges long to develop a
strong individual style—The
Great McCinty is a bit stolid,
but Christmas in luly, released
later the same year, contains
the first instances of the blend
of manic humor and precise,
stinging satire that would be
come the Sturges trademark.
The talkies had begun in
1927, but it took more than a
decade for American movies to
attain the wedding of sight and
sound that was the dream of
visionaries of the late '20s. It is
perhaps no mere coincidence
that film historians link The
Power and the Glory and Citi
zen Kane, or that Kane in its
time the greatest achievement
in American pictures since the
late days of the silents, came
out just as Preston Sturges was
turning into a first-rate di
rector. And, as James Agee
pointed out, it seemed a singu
larly appropriate notion for
Sturges and the great silent
comic Harold Lloyd to marry
their talents inthe 1947 Mad
Wednesday, (also known as
The Sin of Harold Diddlebock),
a satire on the Horatio Alger
success stories Lloyed made in

ments, one imagines, that
could not be easily tumbled
with impunity in 1944. Eddie
Bracken plays a young man,
the son of a war hero who has
been rejected by the Marines
because he has hay fever;
when he confides his troubles
to a crew of Marines in a bar,
they adopt him and bring him
home to his mother in the
guise of a battle-scarred
champion. Conquering Hero
marched triumphantly past the
censors, but The Miracle of
Morgan's Creek, made more
than a year earlier, had a rough
journey and was in fact held up
until 1944 because it was felt
that the story —about a preg
nant woman (Betty Huttcn)
who traps and innocent dupe
(Bracken again) into marrying
her—violated the Production
Code.
Iconoclast though he was,
Sturges was not immune to

sentimentality: it mars the sec
ond half of The Great McCinty
and much of Sullivan's Travels,
which many critics consider his
most important film (probably
because )oel McCrea plays a
movie director in it, with some
Sturgesian characteristics).
Sullivan's Travels isn't an easy
film to forget, however—it's
one of a kind, and some of it is
genuinely moving despite its
heavy-handedness. John Sulli
van, the filmmaker-hero, de
cides to dump his career as
supplier of crowd pleasers like
Hey Hey in the Hayloft and
Ants in the Plants of 1939 in
favor of making socially con
scious dramas like the proj
ected Brother, Where Art Thou?
In order to research his
subject — the life of the
hobo—Sullivan sets out to im
personate one. But his studio
trails him everywhere he goes,
and it isn't until he is knocked
out and robbed by a real tramp,
wakes up with amnesia and
lands himself on the chain
gang, that he learns that he can
best serve the underprivileged
of this country by making them
laugh.
A glance at the plots of
Sturges' movies reveals what
amazingly ingenious narrative
skills he possessed. The final
twist of The Palm Beach Story
makes movie lovers smile in
recollection for years after
wards. In Unfaithfully Yours, a
conductor (wonderfully played
by Rex Harrison) dreams of
murdering his wife (Linda Dar
nell) in fantasy scenes scored
in the music of Rossini,
Wagner and Tchaikowsky. And
perhaps no one since Sturges
has shown such joyous facility
with the English language. Un
faithfully Yours has a Noel
Coward-like deftness, and in
other movies, (Christmas in
luly, Mad Wednesday) Sturges
sets the cliches against each
other and pushes and pulls

them in so many directions that
he seems to have practically in
vented a new jargon. (Listen to
the exchange between Harold
Lloyd and Jimmy Conlan in
Mad Wednesday, in which
Conlan tries to persuade Lloyd
to drink his first alcoholic bev
erage.) The dramatis personae

his dialogue, perhaps I can

consider his a peerless

samples:

characters in Sturges' films as
"too perfectly adjusted to life

Porter Hall, and a couple
dozen others—whose amazing
faces show up in one Sturges
comedy after another. Theyare
the completion of his crazy,
convoluted dialogue, his tall
tales, his unique satiric vision.
"The first impression one
gets from a Sturges movie is
that of the inside of a Ford as
sembly line smashed together
and operating during a total
war crisis. The characters, all
exuding jaundice, cynicism,
and anxiety, work feverishly as
every moment brings them the
fear that their lives are going to
pieces, that they are going to
be fired, murdered, emascu

ridiculous situations that head
lines will scream about them to
a hooting nation for the rest of
their lives." Manny Farber

One memorable night when
I was a senior at Brandeis Uni
versity, two friends and I sat
down in front of a tiny portable
TV in a dorm room to watch a
late-night showing of a fairly
obscure 1937 screwball com
edy called Easy Living, starring
lean Arthur and Ray Mi Hand. In
the opening minutes of the
film we saw the following
oddball encounters: (1) A mil
lionaire (Edward Arnold) trips
of the top step of an enormous
staircase and tumbles straight
down to the feet of a deadpan
butler (Robert Creig), who
quips, without missing a beat,
"Down early to breakfast this
morning sir?" (2) Enraged by
the extravagances of his
spoiled wife, (Mary Nash), Ar
nold flings her latest fur coat
from the roof of her penthouse
apartment. (3) The coat lands
on the head of a young woman
(Arthur) traveling on the top
level of double-decker bus.
Furious, she whips around to
confront the man she assumes
to be her assailant—the inno
cent occupant of the seat be
hing her own— "Hey!" she
calls to him. But he turns out to
be a turbaned mystic, his head
buried in a book; he looks up
at her and whispers, "Kismet!"
Before five minutes of Easy
Living had elapsed, the three of
us were helpless with laughter
and in peril of arousing the
wrath of our sleeping
neighbors. We continued
laughing, almost without inter
ruption, for an hour and a

half—gasping for air through
the automat scene, the first
meeting of the lovers-to-be,
Arthur and Ray Milland,
wherein he (an automat who is
in reality the millionaire's son)
pities her poverty and rigs the
slots to release their little pack
ages of food for free, pre
cipitating a near-riot among
the hungry customers. And

Preston Sturges
Sturges' immediate success
as a director was not to be
wondered at. Anyone who
could design the automat se
quence in Easy Living clearly
had a fine eye, and it didn't
take Sturges long to develop a
strong individual style—The
Great McCinty is a bit stolid,
but Christmas in luly, released
later the same year, contains
the first instances of the blend
of manic humor and precise,
stinging satire that would be
come the Sturges trademark.
The talkies had begun in
1927, but it took more than a
decade for American movies to
attain the wedding of sight and
sound that was the dream of
visionaries of the late '20s. It is
perhaps no mere coincidence
that film historians link The
Power and the Glory and Citi
zen Kane, or that Kane in its
time the greatest achievement
in American pictures since the
late days of the silents, came
out just as Preston Sturges was
turning into a first-rate di
rector. And, as James Agee
pointed out, it seemed a singu
larly appropriate notion for
Sturges and the great silent
comic Harold Lloyd to marry
their talents inthe 1947 Mad
Wednesday, (also known as
The Sin of Harold Diddlebock),
a satire on the Horatio Alger

ments, one imagines, that
could not be easily tumbled
with impunity in 1944. Eddie
Bracken plays a young man,
the son of a war hero who has
been rejected by the Marines
because he has hay fever;
when he confides his troubles
to a crew of Marines in a bar,
they adopt him and bring him
home to his mother in the
guise of a battle-scarred
champion. Conquering Hero
marched triumphantly past the
censors, but The Miracle of
Morgan's Creek, made more
than a year earlier, had a rough
journey and was in fact held up
until 1944 because it was felt
that the story —about a preg
nant woman (Betty Huttcn)
who traps and innocent dupe
(Bracken again) into marrying
her—violated the Production
Code.
Iconoclast though he was,
Sturges was not immune to

sentimentality: it mars the sec
ond half of The Great McCinty
and much of Sullivan's Travels,
which many critics consider his
most important film (probably
because )oel McCrea plays a
movie director in it, with some
Sturgesian characteristics).
Sullivan's Travels isn't an easy
film to forget, however—it's
one of a kind, and some of it is
genuinely moving despite its
heavy-handedness. John Sulli
van, the filmmaker-hero, de
cides to dump his career as
supplier of crowd pleasers like
Hey Hey in the Hayloft and
Ants in the Plants of 1939 in
favor of making socially con
scious dramas like the proj
ected Brother, Where Art Thou?
In order to research his
subject — the life of the
hobo—Sullivan sets out to im
personate one. But his studio
trails him everywhere he goes,
and it isn't until he is knocked
out and robbed by a real tramp,
wakes up with amnesia and
lands himself on the chain
gang, that he learns that he can
best serve the underprivileged
of this country by making them
laugh.
A glance at the plots of
Sturges' movies reveals what
amazingly ingenious narrative
skills he possessed. The final
twist of The Palm Beach Story
makes movie lovers smile in
recollection for years after
wards. In Unfaithfully Yours, a
conductor (wonderfully played
by Rex Harrison) dreams of
murdering his wife (Linda Dar
nell) in fantasy scenes scored
in the music of Rossini,
Wagner and Tchaikowsky. And
perhaps no one since Sturges
has shown such joyous facility
with the English language. Un
faithfully Yours has a Noel
Coward-like deftness, and in
other movies, (Christmas in
luly, Mad Wednesday) Sturges
sets the cliches against each
other and pushes and pulls

them in so many directions that
he seems to have practically in
vented a new jargon. (Listen to
the exchange between Harold
Lloyd and Jimmy Conlan in
Mad Wednesday, in which
Conlan tries to persuade Lloyd
to drink his first alcoholic bev

Porter Hall, and a couple
dozen others—whose amazing
faces show up in one Sturges
comedy after another. Theyare
the completion of his crazy,
convoluted dialogue, his tall
tales, his unique satiric vision.
"The first impression one
gets from a Sturges movie is
that of the inside of a Ford as
sembly line smashed together
and operating during a total
war crisis. The characters, all
exuding jaundice, cynicism,
and anxiety, work feverishly as
every moment brings them the
fear that their lives are going to
pieces, that they are going to
be fired, murdered, emascu
lated or trapped in such
ridiculous situations that head
lines will scream about them to
a hooting nation for the rest of
their lives." Manny Farber
and W.S. Poster, Preston
Sturges: Success in the Movies,
1954.
One memorable night when
I was a senior at Brandeis Uni
versity, two friends and I sat
down in front of a tiny portable
TV in a dorm room to watch a
late-night showing of a fairly
obscure 1937 screwball com
edy called Easy Living, starring
lean Arthur and Ray Mi Hand. In
the opening minutes of the
film we saw the following
oddball encounters: (1) A mil
lionaire (Edward Arnold) trips
of the top step of an enormous
staircase and tumbles straight
down to the feet of a deadpan
butler (Robert Creig), who
quips, without missing a beat,
"Down early to breakfast this
morning sir?" (2) Enraged by
the extravagances of his
spoiled wife, (Mary Nash), Ar
nold flings her latest fur coat
from the roof of her penthouse
apartment. (3) The coat lands
on the head of a young woman
(Arthur) traveling on the top
level of double-decker bus.
Furious, she whips around to
confront the man she assumes
to be her assailant—the inno
cent occupant of the seat be
hing her own— "Hey!" she
calls to him. But he turns out to
be a turbaned mystic, his head
buried in a book; he looks up
at her and whispers, "Kismet!"
Before five minutes of Easy
Living had elapsed, the three of
us were helpless with laughter
and in peril of arousing the
wrath of our sleeping
neighbors. We continued
laughing, almost without inter
ruption, for an hour and a

half—gasping for air through
the automat scene, the first
meeting of the lovers-to-be,
Arthur and Ray Milland,
wherein he (an automat who is
in reality the millionaire's son)
pities her poverty and rigs the
slots to release their little pack
ages of food for free, pre
cipitating a near-riot among
the hungry customers. And
though I haven't seen Easy Liv
ing since that night over a dec
ade ago, these and other se
quences in it are more vivid in
my memory than many pic
tures I saw — and wrote
about—last year.
This gem of a movie, perhaps
the most outrageous of the
Depression comedies, ought
to be a classic, revived as often
as It Happened One Night, and
Bringing Up Baby. It is one the

early examples of the genius of
Preston Sturges, perhaps the
most gifted comic writer
director since the coming of
sound, to whom the Castro
Theater in San Francisco dedi
cated a film festival throught
May 31.
Preston Sturges, dubbed by
Manny Farber and W.S. Poster
"the most spectacular man
ipulator of sheer humor since
Mark Twain," spent his pre
theatrical days, in the 19205,
running his mother's business
and inventing things; when he
became a writer in 1929, he
simply transferred his preoc
cupations with invention and
business and the American
drive for success to theater and
film.
His first play, The Guinea
Pig, created no stir, but the
popularity of his second,
Strictly Dishonorable, swept

Sturges to Hollywood like
many another celebrated New
York playwright in the despa
rate early days of the talkies.
Strictly Dishonorable made it
to Hollywood, too—it was
filmed in 1931 with Paul Lukas,
and again, in a messed-up mus
ical version in 1951 with Ezio
Pinza. (Sturges did not collabo
rate on either of these pic
tures.) While employed at
Paramount, penning dialogue
for undistinguished efforts like
the Maurice Chevalier-
Claudette Colbert musical The
Big Pond, he continued to
write plays; no one in Hol
lywood noticed him much un
til, in 1953, Fox Studios bought
his screenplay, The Power and
the Glory, a flashback-collage
treatment of the life of a tycoon
(piayed by Spencer Tracy)
which anticipated the tech
nique Herman Mankiewicz
would use in his screenplay for
Citizen Kane eight years later.
He spent the rest of the dec
ade as a successful
screenwriter, working on a
variety of projects. (Among
them: We Live Again, based on
Tolstoy's Resurrection; the pe
rennial Fannie Hurst weeper,
Imitation of Life; William
Wyler's The Good Fairy, out of
a Ferenc Molnar play;
Diamond Jim, starring Edward
Arnold, and Easy Living and
Remember the Night, both di
rected by Paramount's most
light-handed hack, Mitchell
Leisen.) In 1940, he wrote a
political satire called The Great
McCinty and pursuaded Wil
liam Leßaron, Paramount's
production chief, to let him di
rect it himself on condition that
he receive a much smaller sal
ary than usual. (According to
James Ursini, auther of The
Fabulous Life and Times of Pre
ston Sturges, An American
Dreamer, Sturges drew down
somewhere between $1000
and $2500 a week when he was
working on a script, and so the
frugal Leßaron couldn't resist
the offer.) The resultant pic
