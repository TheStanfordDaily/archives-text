# Keith Jarrett: A pianist possessed

Keith Jarrett performs like
one possessed. But exactly
what he's possessed by is
difficult to isolate.
That doesn't really mat
ter.
What matters is that
through this possession Jar
rett is able to transform his
energies and sensibilities as
a pianist into those of an ar
tist. He does this with a to
tal, and often seemingly
erotic, partnership with the
piano â€” even caring to
symbolically share the
applause with his instru
ment by acknowledging it
before leaving the stage.
Jarrett's presentation is
tirelessly physical but his
movements are consistently
synchronous with the
timbre and intensity of his
music. His feet, his head,
his back and his torso are as
intimiately connected to his
involvement at the
keyboard as are his fleet fin
gers, making his concerts
visual as well as aural
events.
Improvisation is Jarrett's
primary mode and anyone
unable to digest music
without a leading theme,
gradual variations on that
theme, and a tidy and con
sequent ending are likely to
find his wandering explora
tions rebellious, tangled
and alien. Jarrett can come

within millimeters of climax
ing a musical phrase or a
series of loosely-strung pas
sages, but he never quite al
lows an actual peak. To
someone with bearings in
traditional composition,
this could be as frustrating
as having the last note in the
progression of a musical
scale withheld.
While Jarrett's basic form,
or lack thereof, might not
satisfy, his content usually
can. The immense variety
contained in one of his 30 to
45-minute engagements at
the piano swings from lyri
cism to dynamism, from tr
ance to excitement, from
consonance to dissonance
and excludes nothing in be
tween. He also has a very
unusual and intuitive sense
for deftly combining com
plex rhythms, often tapping
or pounding the floor with
one or both feet in a pulsat
ing delirium.
Jarrett's spontaneous
style utilizes the unex
pected to charge a perform
ance, and though there may
be occasional moments of
flagging interest for even
the most avid listener, these
moments are indeed few.
He succeeds in creating
many sound environments
and atmospheric condi
tions, so that it was only fit
ting when, as a parting
statement, Jarrett thanked
his adoring audience for
sharing the weather with
him indoors.
