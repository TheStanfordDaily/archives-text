# Researcher Feigen dies

### 
George Feigen, a research
physiologist who taught at the Medi
cal School for 24 years, died Sunday
eveningat the Stanford Medical Cen
ter. Feigen, 62, suffered a ruptured
aorta which lead to his death.
Feigen, head of the department of
physiology's Ph.D. training program
for the past decade, was called "an
international leader in research who
literally trained students from
throughout the world" by Eugene
Robin, acting head of the depart
ment.
"As a teacher he was feisty and
demanding, but extremely loyal to
his students," Robin said. "George
Feigen radiated integrity."
During his career, Feigen con
ducted studies in the fields of im
munology and pharmacology. He
explored the effectiveness of several
blood substitutes, the mechanisms
of shock triggered by extreme allergy
attack and the effects of allergic reac
tion on the circulatory system.
Feigen spent 20 years studying why
the human immune system, which
normally functions to protect against
disease, occasionally malfunctions,

producing poisons that threaten the
life of the host.
Through research with guinea
pigs, Feigen and his colleagues dis
covered the biochemical reactions
by which a special protein, called
immunoglobulin E, causes the re
lease of the potent chemical his
tamine. When histamine is suddenly
released into the bloodstream, se
vere and sometimes fatal symptoms
can result.
One of Feigen's recent projects
examined the theory that certain
cases of female infertility result from
immunization to sperm. His work
documented the sensitivity of fallo
pian tubes to histamine.
After several years at Caltech and
USC, Feigen became a Stanford fac
ulty member in 1949. He was an
American Heart Association traveling
scholar at the University of Oxford
during 1956-57. In 1963-64 he re
turned to Oxford as a senior post
doctoral fellow, courtesy of the Na
tional Science Foundation.
Feigen is survived by his wife, Pris
cilla Feigen.
