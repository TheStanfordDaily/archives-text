# Local calls to cost more; long distance less
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Senior staff writer 
If the state Public Utilities Com
mission approves a proposed Pacific
Telephone rate increase, your phone
bill may — surprisingly — go down.
"Our average residential bill right
now is $39.35. We estimated that the
cost of the same type of service
would be the same orslightly lower,"
explained Frank Rit to, community re
lations manager for Pacific Tele
phone.
The key, Ritto said, is long
distance calling.
Previously, local phone companies
received a subsidy from American
Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) for

all long distance calls. Therefore,
local companies like Pacific Tele
phone could afford to actually lose
money on local rates, picking up the
difference with AT&T subsidies.
But with the divestiture of AT&T,
starting next year Pacific Telephone
will no longer get those long distance
subsidies and will have to raise its

local rates.
If the proposed increase is im
proved, basic rates will be doubled:
the lifeline rate — Pacific Tele
phone's lowest phone rate — will go
from $2.50 to $5 each month, the
measured service rate from $3.75 to
$7.50 and the basic rate from $7 to
$14.
But because AT&T will no longer
have to supply subsidies for local
companies, longdistance ratescould
go down 15 to 40 percent.
For students who make many long
distance calls, that long distance de
crease could mean a smaller monthly
phone bill.

"If you are a substantial user of toll
calls, your bill may go down," Ritto
said.
"The long distance rates will come
iown if the basic rate goes up. If you
don't make any long distance calls,
though, your bill will go up," he said.
According to Ritto, a basic residen
tial service costs Pacific Telephone
$29 per month to maintain. Although
thecompany would still be losingsls
per month if the proposed rate in
crease is approved, Pacific Tele
phone will use resources such as The
Yellow Pages and special business
services to make up the difference.
