# Faculty reaffirms research policy
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
The University's present research
policy is adequate to handle the con
troversy surrounding a proposal at
the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL) that would aid re
search on nuclear weapons, the Fac
ulty Senate's Committee on Re
search concluded after a lengthy
meeting yesterday.
The decision, reached by a 7-2 vote
in the committee's private session,
reaffirms University policy that a
proposed research project can only
be judged in its scientific meritâ€”and
not on its possible applications.
The decision signifies that the
committee will not attempt to inter
fere with the proposal if it is accepted
by the director of SSRL, Arthur
Bienenstock. The decision also
strongly rebuffs faculty and staff
members at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) who object
to the proposal because they would
be made "unwilling collaborators" in
work they oppose.
Many SLAC faculty and staff mem
bers have questioned the approp
riateness of University policy that
does not allow for workers' moral
opposition to projects. SLAC's ad
ministration is independent from
SSRL's, but SSRL's laboratory de
pends upon SLAC.
Gerald Lieberman, dean of
graduate studies and research and a
committee member, said after the
vote that he "didn't hear a strong ar
gument to make me feel that the
University's policy is inadequate."
Following two statements by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
that reaffirmed the University policy,
the decision indicates that the pro
posal will not be halted on the basis
of its possible applications if it is ac
cepted by Bienenstock.
Jon Adelstein, a junior in political
science who is a leading opponent of
the proposal, said last night that
"students won't sit idly by.
"The committee seems unwilling
to take the actions necessary to pro
tect Stanford researchers from moral
degradation," he said. "They will
allow the academic freedom of re
searchers to determine that their
work is consistant with their con
science to be violated."
Bienenstock said last week that he
is not sure when he will make a deci
sion on whether to accept the propo

sal. SSRL's proposal review panel
made a confidential recommenda
tion to Bienenstock three weeks ago.
Adelstein predicted that "since
they're not willing to change the pol
icy, the proposal will go through."
He said he is planning a "die in" rally
in White Plaza to protest the propo
sal.
Lieberman defended the Univer
sity policy, however, by saying that it
has been in existence for 12 years and
that "it has withstood the test of
time."
"I do not see a different policy aris
ing that would not lead to what I see
as chaos," Lieberman said.
The committee also presented in
formation indicating that the per
centage of University research spon
sored by the Department of Defense
(DoD) rose substantially in the last 10
years. The committee also con
cluded that virtually any research
project could have a potential mili
tary application and that, based on a
scale of zero to 10 (with 10 the high
est degree of applicability), most re
search here has a military application
ranging from one to nine.

The committee's conclusions re
sponded to the senate's March 31 re
quest that the committee study the
volume and character of weapons
related research here. The senate
passed a resolution, sponsored by
Physics Prof. Robert Mozley, asking
the committee to present it with a
preliminary report sometime this
school year, and the committee will
present the report to the senate at its
last meeting June 9.


Robert Mozley
Mozley, who was not at the execu
tive session and was unaware of the
committee's reaffirmation of Univer
sity policy, said last night that he had
"no objection to the way the commit
tee handled the resolution."
"It was a complex question and,
given the short amount of time the
committee had to consider the issue,
it was difficult to come up with defi
nite answers. But I don't necessarily
agree with its conclusions," he said.
Mozley said in his March opening
remarks to the senate that "a slight
move toward avoidance of work with
a clear direct military mission might
be desirable to prevent Stanford
from becoming foo deeply involved
in military research."
Lieberman said that although he
would "worry about concentrating
support (of research) in any one
agency," he is "not concerned"
about the rise in the percentage of
DoD-sponsored research from 11
percent in 1976 to 19.5 percent in
1982.
He said that concentrating support
"leaves us (the University) vulnera

ble to the whims of a particular
agency." He cited as an example the
National Institutes of Health, which
provides 40 percent of the Universi
ty's research funds.
