# Most students leave for summer but campus won't be empty
## Large numbers expected for school 
### JASON COLE Staff writer 
Although summer vacation is just around the corner,
the University will remain open and active while serving
several thousand students who will enroll for summer
quarter.
Sohaila Tofighrad, assistant registrar in charge of
summer session, expects more than 3000 students to
attend classes during the summer. Of those, approxi
mately 600 will be visiting students who are not enrolled
during the regular school year.
Tofighrad based her estimates on past enrollment fig
ures. In the summer of 1981, 3047 students enrolled —
including 606 visiting students.
Cecilia Burciaga, assistant provost and director of
summer session, said most regular students "take sum
mer courses to catch up or to take courses that they want
to fit in." Visiting students take courses for a number of
reasons, depending upon their standing (high school,
undergraduate or graduate).
Of the visiting students in 1981, there were 277
graduate students, 259 undergraduates and 70 high
school juniors or seniors, according to Tofighrad. While
graduate students may take courses to further research
projects, undergraduates seek something they are in
terested in and high school students want to see what
college is like, Burciaga explained.
This summer, the University will offer 211 courses,
about one third the number it offers during a regular
quarter. "We offer a full range of courses. Everything
from philosophy to computer science," Burciaga said.
She indicated that computer science and engineering
were among the more popular courses. "Engineering is
doing very well. The situation is a lot like the rest of the

year," she said.
"Many students are also interested in business
oriented classes. Although the Business School does not
offer any undergraduate courses, we do have several
courses (such as business theory, organizational be
havior and formal organizations) which we suggest to
students," Burciaga said.
Summer enrollment has increased steadily during the
past few years, although the increases have been quite
small. "Last year enrollment was up 2 percent from the
previous year," according to Burciaga. "I think that's
pretty promising considering all the other places to go
and the cost of going here."
The University is trying to increase its summer enroll
ment, especially for visiting students, for two reasons.
"First, we think we have a terrific program. Second, the
money we make from the summer goes toward the gen
eral operating costs of the University," Burciaga ex
plained.
Last year, the University made approximately $1.9 mil
lion from tuition for summer students. The University
grossed $2,780,286 from tuition fees, while it cost about
$900,000 to run the summer program, according to Bur
ciaga.
The University determines tuition fees on a sliding
scale, with each unit above the minimum number cost
ing $174. The minimum number of units is eight for
undergraduates (base cost, $1522) and three for
graduates (base cost, $652K
Univers.ity scholarships are not available to visiting
students, Burciaga said. Regular students may arrange a
financial aid package with the registrar according to their
financial situation, she added.
The application process for visiting
sludents is very simple, with only a
short form to fill out. "It's not any
thing like the real process," Tofig
hrad said. "But we do make sure that
the student is in good standing with
their regular school."
Burciaga said she is expecting the
number of high school students at
tending the summer session to in
crease. "The year before last we had
90 students."
Although the University is trying to
expand the visitors program, it is try
ing not to make taking summer
courses appear to help a student's
chances of being admitted to Stan
ford's regular session. "We are mak
ing sure that the two remain sepa
rate. Otherwise, it would give stu
dents from higher income families a
great advantage," Burciaga said.
