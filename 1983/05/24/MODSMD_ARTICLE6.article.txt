# Facilities improved for conferences

### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
Stanford students attending summer school this year
will have more than hot weather and studying to con
tend with because more than 1000 people from various
groups and organizations will inundate the campus start
ing |une 14.
The summer Conference Program, organized by the
Conference Office and in existence for more than 25
years, hosts 122 separate groups ranging from the U.S.
Cheerleaders Training Conference to the Suzuki Violin
Workshop. In all, the program will earn about $3 million.
The summer facilities and programs, however, bear
little resemblance to term-time programs. According to
Conference Manager Lois Fariello, "people are often
surprised with the quality of the facilities we provide.
Many come expecting dorm-type surroundings. But we
make beds, clean windows and even increase the main
tenance staff. Because we can charge more for the food,
we improve the quality there, too. People leave loving
Stanford, the weather, the ambiance and the facilities,"
Fariello said.
"One Nobel prize winner, who was placed in a hotel
instead of a dorm, even asked to be moved to campus
where the action is," she added.
Costing about $41 per person per day for board and

single-room occupancy, the program — which hires
more than 60 students to assist with the daily chores —
provides porters and maid service. "We try to be as
much like a hotel as possible," Fariello said.
I he programs use most of the bigger facilities, includ
ing Wilbur, Stern, Branner and Florence Moore dorms.
Lambda Nu hosts the longest of the seminars, a 12-week
summer sleep lab and Storey House will host the Execu
tive Program in Humanities.
Assigning the various groups poses a "big logistics
planning problem, said Fariello. "The conference pro
gram does try to provide the best for everyone, how
ever. We try, for instance, to put the youth together,
near the athletic fields."
While the program does strive to be "cost efficient
and to make a profit," many year-long benefits to the
University come from improvements made to satisfy
summer guests. "We paint the rooms and spruce up the
halls. Although not every student will return to a room
with a shampooed rug, most students do return to
cleaned windows and nice rooms," Fariello concluded.
In addition to improving the student facilities, the
summer programs allow the University to retain much of
the term-time maintenance staff, avoiding the problem
of large amounts of employment compensation.
