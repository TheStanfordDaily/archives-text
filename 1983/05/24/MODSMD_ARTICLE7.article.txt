Rebels ambush journalists
Jalapa, Nicaragua â€” A force of about 100
Nicaraguan rebels assaulting this northern town am
bushed a military convoy escorting 12 foreign journal
ists out of the town Sunday, killing five government
soldiers and wounding six others.
The correspondents, including four Americans, lay
in ditches and on the surface of the dirt road about
five miles outside jalapa for an hour and 15 minutes as
the U.S.-backed guerrillas poured a rain of mortar
shells and what appeared to be fire from 50-caliber
and M-60 machine guns along the highway.
The wounded included Nicaragua's Defense Min
istry spokesman, Capt. Roberto Sanchez, who was es
corting the journalists on a government-sponsored
tour of the combat zone near the Honduras border.

The rebels, operating out of Honduras, began their
heavy offensive against Jalapa on Saturday, reportedly
with the intention of seizing a part of Nicaraguan ter
ritory and setting up an operation base there.
Jalapa has been the scene of intermittent but heavy
fighting since December, according to local resi
dents. A major assault in March was aimed at taking
the city, guarded by Sandinista reservists, several hun
dred of whom have been sent here while the regular
army has been held in reserve in major cities.
The rebels, described recently by President Reagan
as "freedom fighters" and known to be receiving ma
terial U. S. support under a covert action program ap
proved by the president, came back to Jalapa on Sat
urday morning.
