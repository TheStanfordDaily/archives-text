Rebels ambush journalists
Jalapa, Nicaragua — A force of about 100
Nicaraguan rebels assaulting this northern town am
bushed a military convoy escorting 12 foreign journal
ists out of the town Sunday, killing five government
soldiers and wounding six others.
The correspondents, including four Americans, lay
in ditches and on the surface of the dirt road about
five miles outside jalapa for an hour and 15 minutes as
the U.S.-backed guerrillas poured a rain of mortar
shells and what appeared to be fire from 50-caliber
and M-60 machine guns along the highway.
The wounded included Nicaragua's Defense Min
istry spokesman, Capt. Roberto Sanchez, who was es
corting the journalists on a government-sponsored
tour of the combat zone near the Honduras border.

The rebels, operating out of Honduras, began their
heavy offensive against Jalapa on Saturday, reportedly
with the intention of seizing a part of Nicaraguan ter
ritory and setting up an operation base there.
Jalapa has been the scene of intermittent but heavy
fighting since December, according to local resi
dents. A major assault in March was aimed at taking
the city, guarded by Sandinista reservists, several hun
dred of whom have been sent here while the regular
army has been held in reserve in major cities.
The rebels, described recently by President Reagan
as "freedom fighters" and known to be receiving ma
terial U. S. support under a covert action program ap
proved by the president, came back to Jalapa on Sat
urday morning.
They launched offensives from four separate points
surrounding Jalapa, Capt. Ramon Gonzalez, who
heads the local Sandinista forces, said.
According to Lisa Fitzgerald, an American nun
working in Jalapa, there have been 25 assassinations
of local leaders here by the contras, or coun
terrevolutionaries, in the last 15 months, two of them
Nicaraguan Catholic lay workers and 10 of them in a
single meeting called to discuss local civil defense.
Mozambique bases bombed
Johannesburg, South Africa— South African jet
fighters attacked suspected bases of the exiled black
nationalist African National Congress in neighboring
Mozambique yesterday in reprisal for last Friday's
devastating explosion at South African air force head
quarters in Pretoria.
A defense spokesman here said, "Intelligence at
this early stage already indicates that scores of ANC
terrorists were killed in the attack," which was aimed
at installations in Matola, a residential suburb 10 miles
west of the Mozambique capital of Maputo. How
ever, in Mozambique, the official news agency said
only six persons were killed, all civilians.
In Dares Salaam, Tanzania, meanwhile, the ANC
admitted direct responsibility for the planting of a car
bomb Friday at the South African air force head
quarters. The blast killed 17 persons and injured 217
others, according to official South African reports.
Yesterday morning's raid by Impala jet fighters
struck what air force officers said were six African Na
tional Congress housing complexes and a Mozam
bique army surface-to-air missile site, which was
"neutralized," according to the South Africans.
J
Arafat assails Khadafy
Beirut, Lebanon — Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion chairman Yasser Arafat yesterday accused Libyan
leader Col. Moammar Khadafy of promoting re
bellion against him, underscoring the growing dis
sension within the PLO and the Arab world over
Arafat's leadership.
In Damascus, Syria, five mutinous leaders from
Arafat's own Fatah faction issued a statement reject
ing moves over the weekend to stifle the peaceful re
volt by placing the dissidents under Arafat's direct
command. The statement said the rebels aimed "to
halt the continuing deviation in the Fatah leadership
and step up the armed struggle against the Zionisten
emy."
Arafat assailed Khadafy after the radical Libyan
leader told a rally in his capital Sunday that the PLO
rebels had his "material and moral support... in or
der that the Palestinian resistance may resume its

leading role of liberation."
Addressing his forces in the PLO's northern Leba
nese stronghold of Tripoli, Arafat said that Khadafy
"declared yesterday (Sunday) that he will cause a split
in the Palestine revolution."
"Is he going to succeed where (President) Reagan
has failed?" Arafat asked rhetorically. "Of course not.
Reagan's agent won't succeed." At a rally Sunday
night in Tripoli, Arafat said of Khadafy, "I swearto cut
out his tongue."
242 nuclear protesters arrested
Washington — U.S. Capitol police yesterday ar
rested 242 singing, flower-waving Christians as they
knelt in the Capitol Rotunda to pray as part of a two
day protest against the Reagan administration's nu
clear arms policy in general and the proposed MX
missile development in particular.
The protesters, many of them clergy, were arrested
for "unlawful conduct" — District of Columbia stat
utes forbid demonstrating in the Rotunda — and
taken out of the Capitol in handcuffs, tothe applause
and cheers of supporters.
Unlawful conduct is a misdemeanor, punishable by
a fine of $500 or six months in jail or both.
Danny Collum, a spokesman for the protest or
ganizers, said that "the majority intend to plead guil
ty."
Those arrested were taken for processing to a spe
cial area set up in D.C. SuperiorCourt. Mostexpected
to spend the night in jail, Collum said.
The protest was organized by a tiny evangelical
Protestant organization called Sojourners, but the
non-violent demonstration included a wide spectrum
of church people, with Roman Catholics apparently
in the majority.
China training Laotian guerrillas
Peking — China iscovertly training and arming Lao
tian insurgents to fight Vietnamese troops stationed
in the strategic Southeast Asian nation of Laos, ac
cording to Western European diplomats here who re
cently visited areas near the Sino-Laotian border in
China.
These diplomats reported a chance encounter last
month with a self-described Laotian guerrilla in
southwest China's Yunnan Province. The encounter
provided the first confirmation of earlier reports by
Western intelligence sources of small-scale Chinese
support for the Laotian insurgents, who are said to be
Marxists, battling their country's pro-Hanoi govern
ment.
Diplomats who recently visited areas near the
border said they were told that Chinese military ad

visers operate eight camps strung along the south west
Chinese frontier in Yunnan Province. Over 1000
young Laotians are said to be receiving light weapons
and guerrilla training for use against the estimated
50,000 Vietnamese troops backing the Vientiane re
gime.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry denied the reports
yesterday, calling them "sheer fabrication."
China, once Hanoi's closest ally, now calls its south
ern neighbor "little hegemonists" bent on domi
nating Southeast Asia with the help of "big
hegemonists" — the Soviet Union.
NAACP leadership rift widens
Washington — An NAACP leadership rift widened
yesterday with quarreling about how soon the or
ganization's board should meet to discuss the sudden
suspension of Executive Director Benjamin Hooks
and whether it should curb the power of Chairman
Margaret Wilson.
The organization announced Friday that Wilson
had suspended Hooks without prior board consent.
Five key members of the 64-person board, some
contending that the reputation and effectiveness of
the nation's oldest civil rights organization are at
stake, last week called for a board meeting Saturday
morning at the NAACP national headquarters in
Brooklyn. They proposed discussing Hooks' sus
pension and Wilson's powers.
Yesterday, however, Wilson, working through act
ing Executive Director Thomas Atkins, said that the
call for a Saturday meeting was improper. Atkins in
structed board members to disregard that notice and
to meet instead June 11 in a hotel outside Chicago.
The sole stated purpose of that meeting, he said,
would be discussion of and appropriate action on the
suspension.
Several who had sought the earlier meeting said
they would meet this Saturday anyway. "That means
nothing to me, brother," NAACP national Vice Chair
man Kelly Alexander of Charlotte, North Carolina,
said yesterday, referring to the )une 11 date.
"The majority of the board members are going to
meet Saturday. I'll be there. ... I am interested in the
NAACP, and I am going to see that nobody is going to
destroy it," Alexander said.
Civil rights commissioners ousted
Washington — President Reagan intends this week
to replace three of the six members on the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission, but the White House has backed
away from an earlier plan to use "recess appoint
ments" that would have allowed them to serve
without confirmation until the end of this session of

Congress, administration officials said yesterday.
Reagan will submit the three nominees in the next
few days, before Congress leaves for the Memorial
Day recess, officials said. Senate confirmation will be
required before they can take office.
Some White House officials were considering the
use of "recess appointments" while Congress was
away, but that idea was scrapped, officials said.
Reagan is ousting commission members who have
been critical of the administration's record on civi'
rights and replacing them with nominees who ap
parently share his opposition to affirmative action
quotas and school busing as tools to fight racial dis
crimination.
Clarence Pendleton, the commission chairman,
said yesterday that he asked the White House to re
place four of his six fellow commissioners because he
needed more conservative support to carry out the
administration's civil rights policies.
Pendleton said he wrote a letter to Reagan last De
cember in which he asked the president to develop a
civil rights policy with the goal of creating a "col
orblind society" and requesting Reagan to consider
making conservative appointments to the com
mission.
"I saw Reagan a month later at a Martin Luther King
(birthday) reception at the White House and he told
me 'I've got your letter and you'll get an answer,' "
Pendleton said. "I think the appointments are part of
my answer."
According to White House officials, Pendleton has
met with White House counselor Edwin Meese sever
al times recently urging him to make changes in the
commission.
