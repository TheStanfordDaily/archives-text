# I.R. council to advise on curriculum
## 
### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
As part of an experimental pro
gram in the School of Humanities
and Sciences, the International Rela
tions Program has formed a visiting
advisory committee to review its cur
riculum. Committee members in
clude well-known figures in the field
of international relations, and sev
eral are also Stanford alumni.
The committee, known as the In
ternational Relations Council, met
this past April and will meet again
next year. According to David Ken
nedy, former chairman of Interna
tional Relations, the committee was
formed for the department to receive
an outside perspective on its teach
ing and offerings.
"This is a measure we take from
time to time around the school,"
Kennedy said. "We recently formed
a visiting committee to review the en
tire School of Humanities and Sci
ences."

Walter Stoessel, recently retired
undersecretary of state and Stanford
alumnus, is a member of the commit
tee. Other alumni include Leon
Sloss, a former foreign service of
ficer, and |ohn Steinhruner, director
of the Foreign Policy Studies Pro
gram at the Brookings Institution.

The four remaining committee
members are Strobe Talbott, diplo
matic correspondent for Time maga
zine, U.S. Rep. Lindy Boggs, Walter
Hoadley, former executive vice
president for Bank of America and
now a fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, and Richard Solomon, head of
the political science department of
the Rand Corporation.
Kennedy explained that the coun
cil was designed more to get a fresh
perspective on a strong department
than to strengthen an ailing one. "It
isn't anything extreme, in the sense
that we thought we had a problem
with our International Relations De
partment," Kennedy said. "Basically,
the committee affirmed what we al
ready knew — that International Re
lations was a strong and effective de
partment."
Barbara Gaerlan, administrative
as> istant in the IR department, said
that the council meetings were con

ducted over a two-day period, during
which council members met to
gether as well as with students and
faculty in the department.
"At the first meeting, the council
was asked to look at curriculum and
the educational needs of the stu
dents, and make recommendations
for reform," Caerlan said. "The
agenda for the second meeting
hasn't been decided, but I suppose
part of the time might be spent re
viewing how many of their recom
mendations have been followed."
Several potential council members
who were contacted were unable to
participate because their time was
limited, according to Gaerlan. "We
aimed very high and got pretty high,"
she said, referring to the caliber of
the council.
"Stoessel is undoubtably the
most highly placed in his field, but
everyone on the council deals in in
ternational relations daily," she said.
Stoessel, now a visiting professor
at American University, said he de
cided to join the council because
"my whole life has been in interna

tional affairs — I trained in that at
Stanford." When Stoessel attended
the University, a special international
relations program did not exist, but
he said, "There were many good
courses in the field."
Although Stoessel said, "I
wouldn't want to comment on the
work of the council in detail," he said
the International Relations Depart
ment "is a very good one as it is."
Everyone who was contacted
about the council reacted with en
thusiasm, Gaerlan said. "To someex
tent it's a public service, and many of
the council members are alums or
have other interests in the Univer
sity," she explained.
Kennedy suggested that a schol
arly interest in international affairs
might be a motive for council mem
bers to contribute. He also com
mented that the IR department
"draws a superior type of student,"
and said this might also be an incen
tive.
At (he April meeting several of the
council members also had an oppor
tunity to speak at the University
panel on U.S. foreign policy, which
was purposely scheduled at the same
time, Gaerlan said.

ducted over a two-day period, during
which council members met to
gether as well as with students and
faculty in the department.
"At the first meeting, the council
was asked to look at curriculum and
the educational needs of the stu
dents, and make recommendations
for reform," Caerlan said. "The
agenda for the second meeting
hasn't been decided, but I suppose
part of the time might be spent re
viewing how many of their recom
mendations have been followed."
Several potential council members
who were contacted were unable to
participate because their time was
limited, according to Gaerlan. "We
aimed very high and got pretty high,"
she said, referring to the caliber of
the council.
"Stoessel is undoubtably the
most highly placed in his field, but
everyone on the council deals in in
ternational relations daily," she said.
Stoessel, now a visiting professor
at American University, said he de
cided to join the council because
"my whole life has been in interna

tional affairs — I trained in that at
Stanford." When Stoessel attended
the University, a special international
relations program did not exist, but
he said, "There were many good
courses in the field."
Although Stoessel said, "I
wouldn't want to comment on the
work of the council in detail," he said
the International Relations Depart
ment "is a very good one as it is."
Everyone who was contacted
about the council reacted with en
thusiasm, Gaerlan said. "To someex
tent it's a public service, and many of
the council members are alums or
have other interests in the Univer
sity," she explained.
Kennedy suggested that a schol
arly interest in international affairs
might be a motive for council mem
bers to contribute. He also com
mented that the IR department
"draws a superior type of student,"
and said this might also be an incen
tive.
At (he April meeting several of the
council members also had an oppor
tunity to speak at the University
panel on U.S. foreign policy, which
was purposely scheduled at the same
time, Gaerlan said.
