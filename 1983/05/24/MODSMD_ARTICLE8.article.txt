### LISA LYNCH Staff writer 
As part of an experimental pro
gram in the School of Humanities
and Sciences, the International Rela
tions Program has formed a visiting
advisory committee to review its cur
riculum. Committee members in
clude well-known figures in the field
of international relations, and sev
eral are also Stanford alumni.
The committee, known as the In
ternational Relations Council, met
this past April and will meet again
next year. According to David Ken
nedy, former chairman of Interna
tional Relations, the committee was
formed for the department to receive
an outside perspective on its teach
ing and offerings.
"This is a measure we take from
time to time around the school,"
Kennedy said. "We recently formed
a visiting committee to review the en
tire School of Humanities and Sci
ences."

Walter Stoessel, recently retired
undersecretary of state and Stanford
alumnus, is a member of the commit
tee. Other alumni include Leon
Sloss, a former foreign service of
ficer, and |ohn Steinhruner, director
of the Foreign Policy Studies Pro
gram at the Brookings Institution.

The four remaining committee
members are Strobe Talbott, diplo
matic correspondent for Time maga
zine, U.S. Rep. Lindy Boggs, Walter
Hoadley, former executive vice
president for Bank of America and
now a fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion, and Richard Solomon, head of
the political science department of
the Rand Corporation.
Kennedy explained that the coun
cil was designed more to get a fresh
perspective on a strong department
than to strengthen an ailing one. "It
isn't anything extreme, in the sense
that we thought we had a problem
with our International Relations De
partment," Kennedy said. "Basically,
the committee affirmed what we al
ready knew â€” that International Re
lations was a strong and effective de
partment."
Barbara Gaerlan, administrative
as> istant in the IR department, said
