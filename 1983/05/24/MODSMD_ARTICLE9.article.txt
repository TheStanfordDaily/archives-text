Walking past the intramural
soccer fields this past
weekend, one would have
seen canopies and a teepee,
heard the beating of drums and
the chanting of voices, and
s m e 11 e d meat cooking for
Kiowa tacos and chili.
These were the sights and
sounds of the 12th Annual
Stanford Pow-Wow which was
held this weekend.
The Stanford American In
dian Organization (SAIO)
sponsored the three-day event
which Lester Johnson, ASSU
representative and treasurer
for the group, described as a
chance for Native Americans to
dance, socialize, sing and eat
together. "We just go there
and have a good time," he said.
There are many pow-wows
all over California and the
western United States. Among
these, Johnson said, Stanford's
is "fairly well known," drawing
about 5000 people.
The first Stanford pow-wow
was held 12 years ago when the
University did what George
Clever, dean of student affairs
for Native American students,
called a "major recruiting ef
fort." As a result of this effort,
Clever said, Stanford enrolled
about 70 Native American stu
dents that year. Of the Native
American students currently
attending Stanford, Clever es
timated that about i0 are ac
tively involved in the SAIO.
Since there is no permanent
funding for the pow-wow, the
students must "work very hard
to raise money," said Anne
Medicine, an assistant dean in
the graduate division. Johnson
said that in order to raise
funds, the SAIO sells T-shirts
and posters. "We send propo
sals to organizations for dona
tions," he said. This year, the
pow-wow received contrib
utions from such varied

sources as SWOPSI, Roble
Hall, the Anthropology De
partment and the Affirmative
Action Program.
By having a pow-wow here,
Johnson said, SAIO hopes to
introduce different aspects of
Native American ( ulture such
as singing, dancing and
artwork that many people will
never be exposed to.
One way the Native Ameri
cans present their culture at
the pow-wow is through com
petitive and noncompetitive
dancing.
The Gourd dance is an
example of a noncompetitive
dance which is also "intertri
bal," said dancer lim Onellion,
who is of Kiowa descent. He
said that the Gourd dance is a
religious dance done by older
men who try to "show leader
ship through example" to the
younger men. They also want
to exhibit "responsibility and
sobriety," he said.
In addition to the noncom
petitive group dances, there
are dancing competitions.
Johnson said that separate
competitions are held for men
and women in two categories
— traditional and fancy danc
ing. The difference between
the two categories lies mainly
in the dress.
Despite these differences,
the dance competitions for
both categories are similar in
that they both use the con
stant, steady beat of the drum
for background. Johnson said a
dancer is |udged on his ability
to "present" himself and
"keep in time with the drum."
Clothing is not a criterion for
judging, he said.
Not everyone who comes to
the pow-wow comes to dance.
Many are craftsmen who dis
play and sell their work.
"I used to dance," said
Manny Twofeathers, a sil
versmith at the pow-wow.

Twofeathers began doing his
craft about 12 years ago "a* a
hobby." Eventually, it became
too expensive to be just a
hobby and since there was
such a high demand for his
work, he said silversmithing
"got to be a full-time job."
like many of the
craftspeople, Twofeathers
goes to pow-wows because
they attract people "who are
really interested in hand
crafted jewelry."
Chris Ipina, another
craftsman at the Stanford
pow-wow, said that business is
not the only reason people
come to pow-wows. "I enjoy
being with Native Americans,"
she said. Originally from the
Klamath River area, Ipina now
lives in Hayward and feels par
ticularly close to the Native
Americans in the Bay Area. "It's
like a big family," she said.
"They get together every
Saturday unless there's one
(pow-wow) during the day."
Not everyone who goes to
the pow-wow is an active parti
cipant, though. The event is
free andopentothepublicand
there are many who come who
are not of Native American
background, Johnson said.
Helen Hoffknecht, a Palo
Alto resident, has been to
three previous pow-wows at
Stanford. "It's about the only
chance to see ceremonial
dances," she said, adding, "I
come for the foods and
jewelry, too." However, while
Hoffknecht enjoys these as
pects of the pow-wow, she
emphasized that her main rea
son for coming is for "an ap
preciation of the cultures and
traditions."
This is the whole idea behind
the Stanford pow-wow, ac
cording to Johnson, who said
that having a pow-wow is "how
we can exhibit our c ulture."




A CULTURAL ATTRACTION: The 12th onnu.il Stanford
pow-wow was an opportunity for many to share various as
pects of native Americ an culture. Dancing, singing, food and
crafts were among the many attractions at the pow-wow.

judging, he said.
Not everyone who comes to
the pow-wow comes to dance.
Many are craftsmen who dis
play and sell their work.
"I used to dance," said
Manny Twofeathers, a sil
versmith at the pow-wow.

Twofeathers began doing his
craft about 12 years ago "a* a
hobby." Eventually, it became
too expensive to be just a
hobby and since there was
such a high demand for his
work, he said silversmithing
"got to be a full-time job."
like many of the
craftspeople, Twofeathers
goes to pow-wows because
they attract people "who are
really interested in hand
crafted jewelry."
Chris Ipina, another
craftsman at the Stanford
pow-wow, said that business is
not the only reason people
come to pow-wows. "I enjoy
being with Native Americans,"
she said. Originally from the
Klamath River area, Ipina now
lives in Hayward and feels par
ticularly close to the Native
Americans in the Bay Area. "It's
like a big family," she said.
"They get together every
Saturday unless there's one
(pow-wow) during the day."
Not everyone who goes to
the pow-wow is an active parti
cipant, though. The event is
free andopentothepublicand
there are many who come who
are not of Native American
background, Johnson said.
Helen Hoffknecht, a Palo
Alto resident, has been to
three previous pow-wows at
Stanford. "It's about the only
chance to see ceremonial
dances," she said, adding, "I
come for the foods and
jewelry, too." However, while
Hoffknecht enjoys these as
pects of the pow-wow, she
emphasized that her main rea
son for coming is for "an ap
preciation of the cultures and
traditions."
This is the whole idea behind
the Stanford pow-wow, ac
cording to Johnson, who said
that having a pow-wow is "how
we can exhibit our c ulture."

Walking past the intramural
soccer fields this past
weekend, one would have
seen canopies and a teepee,
heard the beating of drums and
the chanting of voices, and
s m e 11 e d meat cooking for
Kiowa tacos and chili.
These were the sights and
sounds of the 12th Annual
Stanford Pow-Wow which was
held this weekend.
The Stanford American In
dian Organization (SAIO)
sponsored the three-day event
which Lester Johnson, ASSU
representative and treasurer
for the group, described as a
chance for Native Americans to
dance, socialize, sing and eat
together. "We just go there
and have a good time," he said.
There are many pow-wows
all over California and the
western United States. Among
these, Johnson said, Stanford's
is "fairly well known," drawing
about 5000 people.
The first Stanford pow-wow
was held 12 years ago when the
University did what George
Clever, dean of student affairs
for Native American students,
called a "major recruiting ef
fort." As a result of this effort,
Clever said, Stanford enrolled
about 70 Native American stu
dents that year. Of the Native
American students currently
attending Stanford, Clever es
timated that about i0 are ac
tively involved in the SAIO.
Since there is no permanent
funding for the pow-wow, the
students must "work very hard
to raise money," said Anne
Medicine, an assistant dean in
the graduate division. Johnson
said that in order to raise
funds, the SAIO sells T-shirts
and posters. "We send propo
sals to organizations for dona
tions," he said. This year, the
pow-wow received contrib
utions from such varied

sources as SWOPSI, Roble
Hall, the Anthropology De
partment and the Affirmative
Action Program.
By having a pow-wow here,
Johnson said, SAIO hopes to
introduce different aspects of
Native American ( ulture such
as singing, dancing and
artwork that many people will
never be exposed to.
One way the Native Ameri
cans present their culture at
the pow-wow is through com
petitive and noncompetitive
dancing.
The Gourd dance is an
example of a noncompetitive
dance which is also "intertri
bal," said dancer lim Onellion,
who is of Kiowa descent. He
said that the Gourd dance is a
religious dance done by older
men who try to "show leader
ship through example" to the
younger men. They also want
to exhibit "responsibility and
sobriety," he said.
In addition to the noncom
petitive group dances, there
are dancing competitions.
Johnson said that separate
competitions are held for men
and women in two categories
— traditional and fancy danc
ing. The difference between
the two categories lies mainly
in the dress.
Despite these differences,
the dance competitions for
both categories are similar in
that they both use the con
stant, steady beat of the drum
for background. Johnson said a
dancer is |udged on his ability
to "present" himself and
"keep in time with the drum."
Clothing is not a criterion for
judging, he said.
Not everyone who comes to
