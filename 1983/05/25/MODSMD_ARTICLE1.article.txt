# Athletic scholarships and recruiting equal big business

The complex athletic scholarship and recruiting pro
cess — whereby high school jocks are plucked from
their homes, offered financial support and brought to
the Farm — involves dozens of coaches, hundreds of
student-athletes, thousands of donors and millions of
dollars.
Nearly 265 men's and women's full scholarships, many
of them divided among two or more students, were
granted this year at a cost of more than $3 million, said
Alan Cummings, associate director of Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation.

Athletic Department authorities were eager to point
out that of this $3 million — which is less than one-third
of the department's separate operating budget — none
comes from student tuition payments.
Scholarship revenue is raised by the Stanford Buck
and Cardinal Clubs, organizations which solicit dona
tions from alumni and friends of the University, Cum
mings explained. In addition, some funding comes from
withdrawn interest on large endowed scholarships
which are also donated.
"Scholarships are strictly from the Buck Club and Car
dinal Club. That money cannot be used for any other
thing," said Sue Lem Mon, administrative assistant to
the athletic director.

lack Laird, associate director of development for the
Athletic Department, said the Buck Club generated
more than $1.7 million for men's scholarships this year.
I he department awarded 175 scholarships — the maxi
mum allowed by the NCAA — to athletes in 12 varsity
sports, he said.
Although 88 football players and 14 basketball players
received full scholarships, many more athletes are on
partial scholarships. Laird explained that the other 10
sports are awarded scholarships based on "full ride
equivalencies." Thus if tennis is allowed five full schol
arships, they can give five athletes full rides, or allocate
these funds — approximately $65,000 — among eight or
10 students instead.

"Football and basketball are all full rides. If you don't
give them a full ride, they're going to go somewhere
else," said Laird. For scholarship athletes who live off
campus, he added, "we just send them a check for their
room and board, etc."
More than $900,000 was generated for 87 women's
scholarships, according to Dorothea Gregowski, di
rector of events and acting director of the Cardinal Club.
Like the Buck Club, the Cardinal Club relies heavily on
alumni donations for women's scholarships.
"There's a great pool of alumni who are quite
affluent," noted Lem Mon.
