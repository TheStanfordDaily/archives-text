# Athletic scholarships and recruiting equal big business
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer (Second in a series) 
The complex athletic scholarship and recruiting pro
cess — whereby high school jocks are plucked from
their homes, offered financial support and brought to
the Farm — involves dozens of coaches, hundreds of
student-athletes, thousands of donors and millions of
dollars.
Nearly 265 men's and women's full scholarships, many
of them divided among two or more students, were
granted this year at a cost of more than $3 million, said
Alan Cummings, associate director of Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation.

Athletic Department authorities were eager to point
out that of this $3 million — which is less than one-third
of the department's separate operating budget — none
comes from student tuition payments.
Scholarship revenue is raised by the Stanford Buck
and Cardinal Clubs, organizations which solicit dona
tions from alumni and friends of the University, Cum
mings explained. In addition, some funding comes from
withdrawn interest on large endowed scholarships
which are also donated.
"Scholarships are strictly from the Buck Club and Car
dinal Club. That money cannot be used for any other
thing," said Sue Lem Mon, administrative assistant to
the athletic director.

lack Laird, associate director of development for the
Athletic Department, said the Buck Club generated
more than $1.7 million for men's scholarships this year.
I he department awarded 175 scholarships — the maxi
mum allowed by the NCAA — to athletes in 12 varsity
sports, he said.
Although 88 football players and 14 basketball players
received full scholarships, many more athletes are on
partial scholarships. Laird explained that the other 10
sports are awarded scholarships based on "full ride
equivalencies." Thus if tennis is allowed five full schol
arships, they can give five athletes full rides, or allocate
these funds — approximately $65,000 — among eight or
10 students instead.

"Football and basketball are all full rides. If you don't
give them a full ride, they're going to go somewhere
else," said Laird. For scholarship athletes who live off
campus, he added, "we just send them a check for their
room and board, etc."
More than $900,000 was generated for 87 women's
scholarships, according to Dorothea Gregowski, di
rector of events and acting director of the Cardinal Club.
Like the Buck Club, the Cardinal Club relies heavily on
alumni donations for women's scholarships.
"There's a great pool of alumni who are quite
affluent," noted Lem Mon.
Because the Cardinal Club is relatively young — it was
founded in 1978, whereas the Buck Club has a iO-year
history — it also depends on fundraising events. Such
extravaganzas include a celebrity golf tournament, anti
que car show, auction, wine festival, Mercedes raffle
and the Great Race, said Gregowski.
She added that, when scholarship decisions are made,
"athletic ability is the first consideration . . . (but) need
is in the picture.''
Don Shaw, assistant volleyball coach, said the vol
leyball team tries to spread its four scholarships as thin
as possible. "We have to compete to get the best guys,
but we want to try to help out everybody else too."
The volleyball program, like other sports, often needs
more scholarships in a given year than it is allotted be
cause it is seeking particular talent. In such instances,
Shaw explained, one varsity sport can "borrow" a schol
arship from another; gymnastics has in the past loaned
scholarships to volleyball.
Perhaps the most fundamental question concerning
athletic scholarships is why they are given at all. Ivy
League schools, for example, do not award scholarships
based on athletic ability.
Dick James, administrative assistant for the football
program, said Stanford gives athletic scholarships be
cause they have made the philosophical commitment to
compete athletically at the most competitive level in the
country."

Lem Mon said, "I never thought about it (why we give
athletic scholarships) before. I have no idea. I don't
know. Why do we give academic scholarships?"
Chris Horpel, coach of the wrestling team, said the
notion of students being paid to compete athletically is
the wrong way to perceive the system.
Still, "in the strictest sense, somebody who is on a

wrestling scholarship is paid to wrestle; somebody on a
football scholarship is paid to play football; somebody
on a music scholarship is paid to be a musician," Horpel
said.
While the general assessment of the merit of athletic
scholarships may or may not be an issue, students who
receive such aid clearly favor the system.
I think scholarships are good where you've got a
good player who's intelligent, but doesn't have the fi
nancial backing to come to Stanford," said senior Greg
Lambert, a scholarship water polo player.
But there is tremendous potential for abuse of the
system when athletes who don't need the aid insist on
scholarships and threaten to enroll elsewhere if they
don't receive one, Lambert noted.
Scholarships are the icing on the cake for most
athletes, however. Athletes and coaches must first sur
vive the admissions and recruiting procedures.
Department officials insisted that athletics enjoys no
special relationship with the University Admissions Of
fice. "Stanford athletics has absolutely nothing to do
with the Admissions Office . . . the Athletic Department
does not admit students," said Lem Mon.
"We are allowed to send over a list of athletes who we
are interested in. The admissions office will look at all
those applications and give the athletic director a 'likely'
or 'unlikely' whether he will be admitted. If 'likely' we
will send out a letter of intent," she explained.
"The letter of intent does not signify that he will get
into Stanford . . . (it) is null and void if he is not ac
cepted," she continued.
Lambert, the scholarship water polo player, said, "I
never knew I was in until I received notice."
James, administrative assistant forfootball, addedthat
the scholarship candidate "has to do the same level or
better academic work (during his last high school semes
ter) as when they were evaluated as a likely candidate.
They can't get senioritis and go to sleep."
Aside from travel and equipment expenses, many
coaches spend a good chunk of their budgets on recruit
ing costs. More than $200,000 has been allocated for next
year's recruiting — about one-fifth of the department's
total operating budget, according to Cummings.
The football program deploys nine coaches during
peak recruiting periods and spent $108,000 this year on
all recruiting-related expenses, James said. "We've got
them all (the nine coaches) on the road right now,"
running through airports from Florida to Oregon.
Shaw said the volleyball program invests "about 10
percent" of its budget on recruiting. He explained that,
in order to minimize expenses, "I'll go to one or two
tournaments (in Southern California) and try to catch
them all. In addition, the "top two or three prospects"
are flown up to visit campus each year.
Some students recalled that coaches can sometimes
play politics with their scholarships. One varsity athlete
noted that he was already on a plane on his way to visit
campus when the coach informed him — for the first
time — that he had no scholarship money left. The
athlete's face fell . . . until the coach phoned him at
home several days later and told him he had managed to
drum up the necessary money.
Lambert said that this was not a problem for him be
cause I couldn't afford to go to Stanford without a
scholarship."

"athletic ability is the first consideration . . . (but) need
is in the picture.''
Don Shaw, assistant volleyball coach, said the vol
leyball team tries to spread its four scholarships as thin
as possible. "We have to compete to get the best guys,
but we want to try to help out everybody else too."
The volleyball program, like other sports, often needs
more scholarships in a given year than it is allotted be
cause it is seeking particular talent. In such instances,
Shaw explained, one varsity sport can "borrow" a schol
arship from another; gymnastics has in the past loaned
scholarships to volleyball.
Perhaps the most fundamental question concerning
athletic scholarships is why they are given at all. Ivy
League schools, for example, do not award scholarships
based on athletic ability.
Dick James, administrative assistant for the football
program, said Stanford gives athletic scholarships be
cause they have made the philosophical commitment to
compete athletically at the most competitive level in the
country."

Lem Mon said, "I never thought about it (why we give
athletic scholarships) before. I have no idea. I don't
know. Why do we give academic scholarships?"
Chris Horpel, coach of the wrestling team, said the
notion of students being paid to compete athletically is
the wrong way to perceive the system.
Still, "in the strictest sense, somebody who is on a

wrestling scholarship is paid to wrestle; somebody on a
football scholarship is paid to play football; somebody
on a music scholarship is paid to be a musician," Horpel
said.
While the general assessment of the merit of athletic
scholarships may or may not be an issue, students who
receive such aid clearly favor the system.
I think scholarships are good where you've got a
good player who's intelligent, but doesn't have the fi
nancial backing to come to Stanford," said senior Greg
Lambert, a scholarship water polo player.
But there is tremendous potential for abuse of the
system when athletes who don't need the aid insist on
scholarships and threaten to enroll elsewhere if they
don't receive one, Lambert noted.
Scholarships are the icing on the cake for most
athletes, however. Athletes and coaches must first sur
vive the admissions and recruiting procedures.
Department officials insisted that athletics enjoys no
special relationship with the University Admissions Of
fice. "Stanford athletics has absolutely nothing to do
with the Admissions Office . . . the Athletic Department
does not admit students," said Lem Mon.
"We are allowed to send over a list of athletes who we
are interested in. The admissions office will look at all
those applications and give the athletic director a 'likely'
or 'unlikely' whether he will be admitted. If 'likely' we
will send out a letter of intent," she explained.
"The letter of intent does not signify that he will get
into Stanford . . . (it) is null and void if he is not ac
cepted," she continued.
Lambert, the scholarship water polo player, said, "I
never knew I was in until I received notice."
James, administrative assistant forfootball, addedthat
the scholarship candidate "has to do the same level or
better academic work (during his last high school semes
ter) as when they were evaluated as a likely candidate.
They can't get senioritis and go to sleep."
Aside from travel and equipment expenses, many
coaches spend a good chunk of their budgets on recruit
ing costs. More than $200,000 has been allocated for next
year's recruiting — about one-fifth of the department's
total operating budget, according to Cummings.
The football program deploys nine coaches during
peak recruiting periods and spent $108,000 this year on
all recruiting-related expenses, James said. "We've got
them all (the nine coaches) on the road right now,"
running through airports from Florida to Oregon.
Shaw said the volleyball program invests "about 10
percent" of its budget on recruiting. He explained that,
in order to minimize expenses, "I'll go to one or two
tournaments (in Southern California) and try to catch
them all. In addition, the "top two or three prospects"
are flown up to visit campus each year.
Some students recalled that coaches can sometimes
play politics with their scholarships. One varsity athlete
noted that he was already on a plane on his way to visit
campus when the coach informed him — for the first
time — that he had no scholarship money left. The
athlete's face fell . . . until the coach phoned him at
home several days later and told him he had managed to
drum up the necessary money.
Lambert said that this was not a problem for him be
cause I couldn't afford to go to Stanford without a
scholarship."

Number of full scholarships per varsity sport '82-'B3 academic year*
The complex athletic scholarship and recruiting pro
cess — whereby high school jocks are plucked from
their homes, offered financial support and brought to
the Farm — involves dozens of coaches, hundreds of
student-athletes, thousands of donors and millions of
dollars.
Nearly 265 men's and women's full scholarships, many
of them divided among two or more students, were
granted this year at a cost of more than $3 million, said
Alan Cummings, associate director of Athletics, Physical
Education and Recreation.

Athletic Department authorities were eager to point
out that of this $3 million — which is less than one-third
of the department's separate operating budget — none
comes from student tuition payments.
Scholarship revenue is raised by the Stanford Buck
and Cardinal Clubs, organizations which solicit dona
tions from alumni and friends of the University, Cum
mings explained. In addition, some funding comes from
withdrawn interest on large endowed scholarships
which are also donated.
"Scholarships are strictly from the Buck Club and Car
dinal Club. That money cannot be used for any other
thing," said Sue Lem Mon, administrative assistant to
the athletic director.

lack Laird, associate director of development for the
Athletic Department, said the Buck Club generated
more than $1.7 million for men's scholarships this year.
I he department awarded 175 scholarships — the maxi
mum allowed by the NCAA — to athletes in 12 varsity
sports, he said.
Although 88 football players and 14 basketball players
received full scholarships, many more athletes are on
partial scholarships. Laird explained that the other 10
sports are awarded scholarships based on "full ride
equivalencies." Thus if tennis is allowed five full schol
arships, they can give five athletes full rides, or allocate
these funds — approximately $65,000 — among eight or
10 students instead.

"Football and basketball are all full rides. If you don't
give them a full ride, they're going to go somewhere
else," said Laird. For scholarship athletes who live off
campus, he added, "we just send them a check for their
room and board, etc."
More than $900,000 was generated for 87 women's
scholarships, according to Dorothea Gregowski, di
rector of events and acting director of the Cardinal Club.
Like the Buck Club, the Cardinal Club relies heavily on
alumni donations for women's scholarships.
"There's a great pool of alumni who are quite
affluent," noted Lem Mon.
Because the Cardinal Club is relatively young — it was
founded in 1978, whereas the Buck Club has a iO-year
history — it also depends on fundraising events. Such
extravaganzas include a celebrity golf tournament, anti
que car show, auction, wine festival, Mercedes raffle
and the Great Race, said Gregowski.
She added that, when scholarship decisions are made,
"athletic ability is the first consideration . . . (but) need
is in the picture.''
