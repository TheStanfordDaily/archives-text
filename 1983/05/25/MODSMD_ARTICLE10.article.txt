## The Stanford Daily Attack of graduation-itis
### 
A malady that has stricken many who will be
graduating in June, both undergraduates and
graduates, is called "senior-itis" — or
"graduation-itis" for advanced degree candi
dates.
Having a case of "senior-itis" means one's
thoughts are on the future or the past, but most
definitely not on the present. Or perhaps it
means one has no productive thoughts at all.
The diseased are incapacitated and are ren
dered completely useless until school is offi
cially over. Going to parties, sitting in the sun
and "hanging out " replace studying and parti
cipating in extra-curricular activities.
Although the disease affects each student
with a different level of intensity, its universal
signs are easily recognizable.
Its gravest symptom is anxiety, even angst,
about the future. Questions about self-worth,
personal success or one's role in life frequently
reverberate in the minds of those about to leave
Stanford forever.
The anxiety over the future is compounded by

often sad and pensive retrospection. The na
tional and international make-up of our student
body means that goodbye in |une may be a final
farewell.
On the lighter side, seniors who have their
post-graduation plans already set tend to lose
their motivation to do schoolwork — or most
anything for that matter. Academic competition
is replaced by a desire to have the lightest work
load. The music and the "rays" at White Plaza
prove to be far more appealing than the call of
that 1:15 class. The desire to relax seems more
immediately relevant than being elected to Phi
Beta Kappa.
Many remedies for "senior-itis" have been
tried but so far none have worked successfully.
The most motivating "remedy" is the need to
complete those last units in order to receive a
diploma or a respectable final transcript. Re
gardless of the immediate solution, the disease
will disappear by this time next month, leaving
the Class of '83 immune and the Class of '84 as
the next victim.
