# Confessions of a leftist
## 
### 
It should be obvious to anyone
who has read my columns that I con
sider myself to be on the political
"left." In all cases where my subject
matter has been definable on a left/
right spectrum, I have inevitably
taken the left position (no draft, no
nukes, United States out of El Sal
vador). In doing so I have alienated
myself from a very significant part of
the Stanford community and the so
ciety as a whole; I have even gone so
far as to deliberately challenge the
system by announcing my refusal to
register for the draft.
It is not immediately obvious why I
should want to do these things. From
one perspective, I am really not per
sonally threatened by the draft or by
war in El Salvador; the advantages of
my class background would in all
probability allow me to avoid any
messy consequences of either. And
it is also painfully clear that, until
such time as my life is directly af
fected by national or global events,
the ups and downs of my personal
relationships play a much greater
part in my happiness than do goings
on elsewhere in the country or the
world.
Hence at some level all the or
ganizing I do and all that I write is
irrelevant. Most people, just like my
self, are more concerned about their
personal lives than about remote
problems like Central America,
cruise missiles or my pet issue, the
draft. People only spend a fraction of
their time thinking about these
things. So why should I waste my
time on this stuff?
To make the question even more
complicated, let me add this: given
that left political organizing is often
just as competitive, intolerant and
inhuman asanycorporation could be
and that it implies contradictions like
givingthe people of El Salvador some
significance that I deny to the people
of Afghanistan, how can I align my
self with the left?
The idea that motivates me and
which I have been trying to express
through the compromise of left polit
ical organizing is that all of the "sys
tems" we have seen so fa' have been
unsatisfactory. The improvements in
our material lives are real and sub
stantial, yet industrial society has
proven to be largely alienating and
unable to provide an environment
suitable for being human.
Marx said explicitly that the alien
tation people feel is fundamental to
their current condition. It must be
recognized that his goal was not the
totalitarianism of central control but
an organized anarchy in which
people overcome alienation through
controlling their own lives. In my
view, however, Marx overempha
sized the nature of the person as a
producer and hence the alienation of
the worker from the goods pro
duced; my conception focuses in
stead on the person as one who re

lates and thus on the alienation of
people from each other.
Like Marx, however, I have gone to
the left.because it is clear to me that
capitalism and the material accumu
lation that is basic to it are hopelessly
intertwined with our alienation. The
competition of workers for better
jobs result in alienation at the
workplace; the uneven distribution
of goods result in the alienation be
tween social classes; the economic
inequality of men and women
creates alienation between the
sexes. Where we are competing for
our rewards against others there can
be no real human contact.
Yet the left, taken broadly, does
not itself successfully resolve these
problems. As I stated before, left
political organizations can be just as
competitive and inhuman as any
other organization. It is especially
clear when one looks at the way men
in such groups interact with each
other and the women in those
groups. And it is certainly under
standable; having grown up in the
same culture, even those who now in
some sense set themselves against it
are nevertheless products of it. We
are alienated, lonely, sexually inse
cure, just likethe people wecriticize.
Why then do we even claim to be the
opposition?
As a way of addressing this question,
I want to look at three separate "left"
political movements: the youth
movement of the sixties, the move
ment for social justice led by Martin
Luther King and the feminist move
ment. I want in particular to look at
why these movements, even though
they would be as opposed to a
Soviet-style socialist system as to the
U.S.-style capitalist system, neverthe
less must be seen as "left" oriented.
The youth movement of the '60s
was about personal liberation. It was
about experimenting with clothes,
sex, drugs and music. It was about
trying to create new ways of dealing
with other people. And it was about
trying to regain a sense of meaning
and connectedness that was no
longer provided by any of the stan
dard cultural values: work, religion
and the family.
The experience of the civil rights
movement and the war in Vietnam
gave to the youth of the '60s a vivid
demonstration of the underside of
the U.S. capitalist/democratic sys
tem. The contradictions of that sys
tem were made into network news
and came into young people's lives
directly in the form of the draft.
Moreover, these contradictions ap
peared intimately linked to the emp
tiness of family life and the sterility
and hypocrisy of standard religions.
So the struggle against alienation
nec essarily took on as targets not just
the dominant social values but the
political/economic structure as well,
making the movement into a "left"

movement.
The social-justice movement led
by Martin Luther King was a left
movement tor many similar reasons.
Although King's approach was fun
damentally religious — emphasizing
love, non-violence and the sacred
community — the "real-world" im
plications of this doctrine were ines
capably political. Before his assassi
nation, King had gone far beyond a
demand for equal "civil rights"; he
spoke out strongly against the war in
Vietnam and in favor of a radical re
distribution of wealth and power (if
you don't believe this last point, read
King's book Chaos or Community).
In the terms in which this country
operates, that put him quite farto the
left.
The feminist movement is also a
left movement because of the nature
of its demands. Although the
feminist analysis regards sexual
rather than economic factors as the
driving force of oppression, the re
sult of the analysis is nevertheless
opposition to capitalism and to
militarism as well as to male
privilege in general. Clearly a
feminist analysis condemns Soviet
style socialism; yet clearly also the
natural allies of feminists are on the
left.
The three movements I've de
scribed have in common not just rad
ical demands, however, but a distinct
commitment to personal liberation.
And by that personal liberation is
seen not as the worship of the indi
vidual that underlies liberal democ
racy, but as the overcoming of aliena
tion and the birth of community.
I have come into the political strug
gle through personal experiences
both of alienation and of community
and I feel in my life direct connec
tions with the '60s struggle, with
Dr. King and with the feminist
movement. I see personal changes in
my life as being as important as na
tional or global changes. Vet I see as
well that I cannot focus on personal
issues alone.
After all, I can be drafted, nuked or
poisoned through the action of
forces beyond my individual control.
But even more than that, I have to
admit that for an awful lot of people
the immediateconditionsof material
life are of greater importance than
(heir personal alienation. A starving
person or an unemployed person
has more immediate concerns than,
say, the impersonality of the educa
tional system. My concern with rela
tionship and community is a luxury
of my class status; I cannot ignore
the fact that economic justice a pre
requisite for personal liberation.
That, then, is why I am a leftist.
