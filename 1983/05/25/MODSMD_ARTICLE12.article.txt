## University teachers have right to define content 
### 
I write concerning former Con
gressman Paul "Pete" McCloskey's
course this spring on the Congres
sional Decision-Making Process. Var
ious statements have been made
concerning his relationships with the
Guest Professorship Board. I have
had one brief meeting with the chair
man of that board and two members
of the Council of presidents; they
have clarified some of their dealings
with McCloskey. I cannot judge
whether one side or another violated
private agreements between the par
ties.
My concern, however, is quite
different. It should not be necessary,
but perhaps is, to reiterate the long
established principle of this Univer
sity that departmental faculties are

responsible for who will offer
courses for credit and the subject
matter of those courses. The faculty
in academic departments alone
select teachers and alone approve
their courses. Once that is done,
teachers at this University have the
freedom to define content. A teacher
may choose to consult with students
as to course material but in the end
the decision rests with the teacher.
It is my understanding that the
Political Science Department ap
proved McCloskey as a teacher and
his proposed course. I have re
quested that Norm Wessells, dean of
Humanities and Sciences, inquire as
to whether there have been any ir
regularities that breach academic
freedom in the offering of this

course. The principles of academic
freedom are crucial to the intellec
tual life and vigor of this University;
we cannot tolerate deviations from
them.

Israeli gov't
As a Jew and a supporter of Israel, I
was deeply disturbed by Rodman
Reade's letter (Daily, May 17). In the
letter, he suggests that Israel and the
Jews view themselves as being "be
yond or above criticism." On the
contrary, the Israelis are quite willing
to accept reasonable criticism from

without and from within. The gov
ernment most notably demonstrated
this willingness through its own re
cent report on the Sabra and Shatilla
massacres.
However, the type of criticism that
Israel and the Jewish people will not
stand for is the groundless nonsense
that Reade tries to put forward when
he implies a link between Menachem
Begin and the bombing of the Ameri
can Embassy in Beirut. The hint of
such a relation is plain absurdity.
The Israeli government and society
are far from perfection, but before
criticizing them, one rnust distin
guish between justifiable reproof
and unfounded imputation.
