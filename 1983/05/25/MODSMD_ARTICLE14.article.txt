## Hoover and academic freedom 
### 
No one likes to be called names and told they are
engaged in a "witch hunt," but if you look past the
rhetoric, Prof. Alphonse Juilland, by raising the issue of
academic freedom, has done the University a great ser
vice. Academic feedom is one of the central underlying
issues in the debate over Hoover: the freedom to as .
dangerous and unpopular questions and have them de
bated responsibly in a university community. Open dis
cussion of issues that some people would rather avoid
lies close to the heart of what a university is all about;
hence the University should be better off for having
these issues raised than having ignored them.
As a university, Stanford claims to be nonpolitical,
nonpartisan and politically independent. Our legitimacy
as an institution of higher education — the most preci
ous thing we have — is in complex and fragile ways
dependent upon the validity of these claims. To honor
these claims we not only allow but we encourage the
widest possible political expression on campus, and we
guard against any one view becoming too closely iden
tified with the University per se.
When President Reagan says . .during the recent
campaign, I called on more people from the Institution
to help with my campaign than from any other institu
tion," and when he tells a White House reception for
Hoover's Board of Overseers . .you built the knowl
edge base that made the changes now taking place in
Washington possible," it seems to some of us that
Hoover has entered national partisan politics in a big
way, and that Stanford is involved too.
The question that then arises is: If Stanford University,
as a university, is committed to nonpolitical, nonpartisan
and politically independent values, how can these values
be squared with a multi-million dollar research organiza
tion that justly lays claim to being the leading conserva
tive think tank in the country, that openly and proudly
engages in partisan politics and that necessarily involve
the University in such activities?
Many answers have been offered, but the nagging
questions for Stanford won't go away by reference to
Harvard and Kennedy, or the academic freedom of
Hoover scholars to do as they wish. Contrary to Jut
land's petition, we are not proposing an inquiry into the
political orientation of Hoover (that seems generally
well established); rather, we are proposing a debate
over the proper relationship between Hoover as a politi
cal research institution and the University.
The reason this is vitally important to the University is
that, whatever the benefits of having Hoover connected
with Stanford, the University also benefits Hoover. By
supplying valuable assets to Hoover, does not Stanford
help Hoover advance its political mission? To the extent
that Hoover engages in political and partisan activity,
does not Stanford get drawn into such activities? These
questions, like all good questions, are hard to answer
and generate controversy. But it is for precisely this
reason that they should be asked, not suppressed out of
false fears over threats to academic freedom.
If the University's legitimacy were not at issue, we
could all rest content with a few changes in the way
Stanford and Hoover do business. But if there is any real
basis for the concern over legitimacy, a little better gov
ernance may not suffice. We think Stanford must face up
to the difficult question of whether or not we want to be
so closely linked to certain sources of money and politi
cal causes that we become increasingly known as the
conservative, western counterweight of our leading rival
in the east.
T hat these concerns are University-concerns, and not

reducible to a political attack on conservatives is amply
demonstrated in the public media. Carl Irving, for
example, in a May 8, 1983 news article in the San Fran
cisco Examiner, calls attention to Hoover's $60 million
endowment and cautions the University: "As the institu
tion became widely known for leadership that openly
backed conservative causes, endowment funds flowed
in, reaching $60 million earlier this year."
In short, if Hoover and Stanford are joined ever more
closely and if Hoover engages in political activity, it
appears that Stanford directly and indirectly aids a politi
cal cause. This contradicts the University's commitment
to nonpolitical activity, and, at some point, might en
danger the University's legitimacy and reputation as
well. If we allow this to happen, it will be a sad day in the
history of a great university.
Prof. Juilland fears a liberal witch hunt if we discuss
these issues. We share his concern. There is always the
danger of violations of academic freedom when
academics exercise their rights freely. At a practical level
we find it hard to imagine a board of trustees witch hunt
into the Hoover Institution, or a board of distinguished
scholars selected by Kennedy burning the Political Sci
ence Department at the stake, but let us acknowledge
the potential danger of which he warns.
Prof, juilland's petition, however, in the name of pro
tecting academic freedom would shut down free and
open discussion of Hoover. Why? Because the debate
might get out of hand. This does not give the Stanford
community much credit for being able to conduct dis
cussion responsibly, but it is also a rather strange defini
tion of academic freedom. We think academic freedom
means not the avoidance of tough questions but their
responsible pursuit through reasoned discourse. Isn't
the University committed to the responsible exploration
of all questions? We believe it is, therefore fears of a
possible witch hunt are outweighed in favor of respon
sible academic discussion.
Juilland also objects that this is a liberal witch hunt.
Notice first how this contention shifts attention away
from Hoover to the motives of those who signed the
petition. We do not have to concern ourselves with thg
validity of the question, it is enough to know or be
suspicious of the motives of the questioner.
This problem aside, let us, merely for the sake of
argument, grant Prof. Juilland's point. Are liberals then
to be prevented from asking questions simply because
their motives are suspect? Are liberals to be intimidated
by the term "witch hunt" and let Hoover do whatever it
pleases — no questions asked?
What, then, are we to do? Liberals are especially sensi
tive to questions of academic freedom because they
have often been on the receiving end in the past. Yet it
would be no less a travesty of liberal values to cower
from a debate over controversial questions for fear of
being called anamethanto engage in a witch hunt itself.
Any university worth its salt must be a place where ques
tions are asked — responsibly and openly and freely.
Certainly conservatives and liberals must agree on this if
nothing else. And, if we agree, we must reject Prof.
Juilland's position as a confusion of academic freedom
with academic license. With people like Prof. Juilland
around to uphold the fairness of public debate we see
no reason why that debate, far from endangering the
University, might not demonstrate the University's
highest principles in action.

What, then, are we to do? Liberals are especially sensi
tive to questions of academic freedom because they
have often been on the receiving end in the past. Yet it
would be no less a travesty of liberal values to cower
from a debate over controversial questions for fear of
being called anamethanto engage in a witch hunt itself.
Any university worth its salt must be a place where ques
tions are asked — responsibly and openly and freely.
Certainly conservatives and liberals must agree on this if
nothing else. And, if we agree, we must reject Prof.
Juilland's position as a confusion of academic freedom
with academic license. With people like Prof. Juilland
around to uphold the fairness of public debate we see
no reason why that debate, far from endangering the
University, might not demonstrate the University's
highest principles in action.

No one likes to be called names and told they are
engaged in a "witch hunt," but if you look past the
rhetoric, Prof. Alphonse Juilland, by raising the issue of
academic freedom, has done the University a great ser
vice. Academic feedom is one of the central underlying
issues in the debate over Hoover: the freedom to as .
dangerous and unpopular questions and have them de
bated responsibly in a university community. Open dis
cussion of issues that some people would rather avoid
lies close to the heart of what a university is all about;
hence the University should be better off for having
these issues raised than having ignored them.
As a university, Stanford claims to be nonpolitical,
nonpartisan and politically independent. Our legitimacy
as an institution of higher education — the most preci
ous thing we have — is in complex and fragile ways
dependent upon the validity of these claims. To honor
these claims we not only allow but we encourage the
widest possible political expression on campus, and we
guard against any one view becoming too closely iden
tified with the University per se.
When President Reagan says . .during the recent
campaign, I called on more people from the Institution
to help with my campaign than from any other institu
tion," and when he tells a White House reception for
Hoover's Board of Overseers . .you built the knowl
edge base that made the changes now taking place in
Washington possible," it seems to some of us that
Hoover has entered national partisan politics in a big
way, and that Stanford is involved too.
The question that then arises is: If Stanford University,
as a university, is committed to nonpolitical, nonpartisan
and politically independent values, how can these values
be squared with a multi-million dollar research organiza
tion that justly lays claim to being the leading conserva
tive think tank in the country, that openly and proudly
engages in partisan politics and that necessarily involve
the University in such activities?
Many answers have been offered, but the nagging
questions for Stanford won't go away by reference to
Harvard and Kennedy, or the academic freedom of
Hoover scholars to do as they wish. Contrary to Jut
land's petition, we are not proposing an inquiry into the
political orientation of Hoover (that seems generally
well established); rather, we are proposing a debate
over the proper relationship between Hoover as a politi
cal research institution and the University.
The reason this is vitally important to the University is
that, whatever the benefits of having Hoover connected
with Stanford, the University also benefits Hoover. By
supplying valuable assets to Hoover, does not Stanford
help Hoover advance its political mission? To the extent
that Hoover engages in political and partisan activity,
does not Stanford get drawn into such activities? These
questions, like all good questions, are hard to answer
and generate controversy. But it is for precisely this
reason that they should be asked, not suppressed out of
false fears over threats to academic freedom.
If the University's legitimacy were not at issue, we
could all rest content with a few changes in the way
Stanford and Hoover do business. But if there is any real
basis for the concern over legitimacy, a little better gov
ernance may not suffice. We think Stanford must face up
to the difficult question of whether or not we want to be
so closely linked to certain sources of money and politi
cal causes that we become increasingly known as the
conservative, western counterweight of our leading rival
in the east.
T hat these concerns are University-concerns, and not

reducible to a political attack on conservatives is amply
demonstrated in the public media. Carl Irving, for
example, in a May 8, 1983 news article in the San Fran
cisco Examiner, calls attention to Hoover's $60 million
endowment and cautions the University: "As the institu
tion became widely known for leadership that openly
backed conservative causes, endowment funds flowed
in, reaching $60 million earlier this year."
In short, if Hoover and Stanford are joined ever more
closely and if Hoover engages in political activity, it
appears that Stanford directly and indirectly aids a politi
cal cause. This contradicts the University's commitment
to nonpolitical activity, and, at some point, might en
danger the University's legitimacy and reputation as
well. If we allow this to happen, it will be a sad day in the
history of a great university.
Prof. Juilland fears a liberal witch hunt if we discuss
these issues. We share his concern. There is always the
danger of violations of academic freedom when
academics exercise their rights freely. At a practical level
we find it hard to imagine a board of trustees witch hunt
into the Hoover Institution, or a board of distinguished
scholars selected by Kennedy burning the Political Sci
ence Department at the stake, but let us acknowledge
the potential danger of which he warns.
Prof, juilland's petition, however, in the name of pro
tecting academic freedom would shut down free and
open discussion of Hoover. Why? Because the debate
might get out of hand. This does not give the Stanford
community much credit for being able to conduct dis
cussion responsibly, but it is also a rather strange defini
tion of academic freedom. We think academic freedom
means not the avoidance of tough questions but their
responsible pursuit through reasoned discourse. Isn't
the University committed to the responsible exploration
of all questions? We believe it is, therefore fears of a
possible witch hunt are outweighed in favor of respon
sible academic discussion.
Juilland also objects that this is a liberal witch hunt.
Notice first how this contention shifts attention away
from Hoover to the motives of those who signed the
petition. We do not have to concern ourselves with thg
validity of the question, it is enough to know or be
suspicious of the motives of the questioner.
This problem aside, let us, merely for the sake of
argument, grant Prof. Juilland's point. Are liberals then
to be prevented from asking questions simply because
their motives are suspect? Are liberals to be intimidated
by the term "witch hunt" and let Hoover do whatever it
pleases — no questions asked?
What, then, are we to do? Liberals are especially sensi
tive to questions of academic freedom because they
have often been on the receiving end in the past. Yet it
would be no less a travesty of liberal values to cower
from a debate over controversial questions for fear of
