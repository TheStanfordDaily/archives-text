# Graffiti covers many student concerns, campus walls

### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
''Romance is dead.
Academia prevails.
Pithy adages like this are not
always confined to the dusty
pages of reference manuals.
Any wall-watcher here knows
that the problems, questions
and wisdom of the ages can
often be found etched in fad
ing pencil on the gray walls of
the Meyer Library bathrooms.
The anonymity of bathroom
walls in libraries, dorms and
administrative buildings gives
students the unusu.il opportu
nity to air their views on sex,
religion, herpes, depression
and Stern food.
As one creative writer on the
ground floor of Meyeh put it
(somewhat ungrammatically),
"Students mostly like graffiti.
It's more interesting than most
of the course material around
here."
Several psychologists con
tacted declined to comment
on the motives for indulging in
graffiti. One called the subject
"frivolous."
But whatever the source of
the Freudian impulses that
promote the graffiti, students
here seem to yield to those im
pulses often.
An informal survey of the
campus bathrooms showed
that the libraries have the most
graffiti. In addition, the
amount of graffiti decreases on
each successive floor (do graf
fiti writers avoid stairs?).
Among the women, requests
for advice are the most com
mon graffiti subjects.
One student asked the
Meyer bathroom community
for advice about her unfaithful
boyfriend.
"You'll get over him eventu
ally," one adviser prosaically
consoled
Another had more uncon
ventional advice. "Throw
yourself at his feet and profess
love," she said.
Other jilted Stanford women
were more succint.
"I HATE MEN," declared one
writer.
"If we can send one man to
the moon, why not send them
all?" asked another

The men tended to be more
obscene, but also more politi
cal.
"Any form of government is
synonymous with corruption,"
wrote one male anarchist.
Some writers seem to doubt
the sanity of others. "YOU ARE
ALL A BUNCH OF FLAKES!"
wrote one student.
Sometimes the wall-writers
allow their topics to verge on
the cosmic.
"Paradoxes exist," one
writer asserted philosoph
ically. Another astutely
pointed out that this phrase
employs an "assymetry of ter
minology."
The University often at
tempts to thwart would-be
graffitiists by scrubbing, or
even painting over, walls.
Such inconsiderate behavior
on the part of maintenance
men often provokes unre
strained anger from the writ
ers. "Don't wash the walls!" one
writer commanded.
Another was merely bored
by the newly scrubbed cubi
cles. "This is not real exciting,"
she wrote.
Perhaps the most infuriating
aspect of the clean walls for
graffitists is the reminder that
their words of wisdom will last
only a few scant weeks before
fading under a coat of new
paint. One writer chided the
tireless janitors.
"Why paint over all our valu
able graffiti? All that wisdom
gone to waste."
