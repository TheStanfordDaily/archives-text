# McCloskey class to be examined
## 
### JULIE HAGEN Staff writer 
University Vice-President and Pro
vost Albert Hastorf has called for an
inquiry into possible breaches of
academic freedom in the offering of
Guest Prof. Paul "Pete" McCloskey's
spring quarter class.
In a public statement, Hastorf said
that although he cannot judge
whether either McCloskey or the
Guest Professorship Board violated
private agreements made between
the two parties, he is concerned with
the possibility that University policy
regarding the approval of courses
and course content may have been
misinterpreted.
"When a department approves a
course, it's up to the teacher" to de
fine content, Hastorf said yesterday.
A teacher may choose to consult with
students as to course material, but
the final decision rests with the
teacher, Hastorf said.
McCloskey's course on the "Con
gressional Decision-Making Pro
cess" has been surrounded by con
troversy since it was first proposed.
During debate about the course at an
ASSU senate meeting, several stu
dents claimed that many of McClos
key's political statements concerning
the Arab-Israeli conflict were anti-
Semitic. McCloskey and former
Guest Professorship Board Director
Seth Linfield have clashed frequently
over the class syllabus.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Norman Wessells, who has been
asked to investigate the matter,
stated that the sovereignty of the
teacher regarding content of his
course is a primary "rule of academic
freedom in every university in the
country."
Wessells said he will ask the faculty
of the Political Science Department
to examine the set of circumstances,
and recommend any further action
to be taken by the University.
Calvin Quate, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said they
will be "looking for advice" from the
Political Science Department, and
