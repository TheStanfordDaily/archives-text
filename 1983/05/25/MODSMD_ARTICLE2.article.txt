# McCloskey class to be examined
## 
### JULIE HAGEN Staff writer 
University Vice-President and Pro
vost Albert Hastorf has called for an
inquiry into possible breaches of
academic freedom in the offering of
Guest Prof. Paul "Pete" McCloskey's
spring quarter class.
In a public statement, Hastorf said
that although he cannot judge
whether either McCloskey or the
Guest Professorship Board violated
private agreements made between
the two parties, he is concerned with
the possibility that University policy
regarding the approval of courses
and course content may have been
misinterpreted.
"When a department approves a
course, it's up to the teacher" to de
fine content, Hastorf said yesterday.
A teacher may choose to consult with
students as to course material, but
the final decision rests with the
teacher, Hastorf said.
McCloskey's course on the "Con
gressional Decision-Making Pro
cess" has been surrounded by con
troversy since it was first proposed.
During debate about the course at an
ASSU senate meeting, several stu
dents claimed that many of McClos
key's political statements concerning
the Arab-Israeli conflict were anti-
Semitic. McCloskey and former
Guest Professorship Board Director
Seth Linfield have clashed frequently
over the class syllabus.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Norman Wessells, who has been
asked to investigate the matter,
stated that the sovereignty of the
teacher regarding content of his
course is a primary "rule of academic
freedom in every university in the
country."
Wessells said he will ask the faculty
of the Political Science Department
to examine the set of circumstances,
and recommend any further action
to be taken by the University.
Calvin Quate, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said they
will be "looking for advice" from the
Political Science Department, and
that he expected the department
would form a faculty committee to
conduct the inquiry.
Wessells said that although he
could not say exactly when the in
quiry would begin, he hoped that the
department would begin action "ex
peditiously."
McCloskey, on April 18, charged
Linfield with invading his academic
freedom by censoring his proposed
reading list and deleting certain selec
tions. McCloskey said Linfield told
him he could not use certain materi
als because they were not "fair
enough." McCloskey called this "re
verse anti-Semitism" and an attempt
to prevent freedom of expression
on the Stanford campus."
Linfield claimed that the reading
list was reviewed only to insure
academic quality, and that the les
sons deleted were "unacademic,
non-rigorous and rather silly."
A letter delivered to the GPB April
21 signed by 20 students in McClos

key's class stated, "We feel that the
ASSU (CPB's) 'review' of Con
gressman McCloskey's syllabus, as
signed redings and selection of guest
lecturers is an unprecedented and
intolerable act of infringement of
Congressman McCloskey's
academic freedom. ... It is our
opinion that the ASSU (CPB) has

failed to effectively fulfill its adminis
trative responsibilities. . . ."
The ASSU subsequently voted
unanimously to "disassociate itself
with, and disclaim any responsibility
for, McCloskey's anti-Semitic re
marks," as part of a resolution au
thored by graduate senator )im
McGrath and passed May 3.
