# Football/basketball tix on sale today

Tom Davis is at it again.
The Stanford basketball coach, eight
months before his second season as Car
dinal mentor is scheduled to start, is at
tempting to sell out Maples Pavilion.
Step one in the strategy is aimed at the
student. Davis, along with some help from
the Athletic Department, is offering a
combined football-basketball student sea
son ticket for $26.
The package includes four football
games (UCLA, Oregon, Arizona and Cal)
and 18 basketball games (including North
Carolina twice in the Stanford Invitational
and the regular Pacific-10 schedule).
A basketball-only season ticket for next

year will sell for S5. Last year's sold for
$7.50. Davis is stopping nothing short of
giving the tickets away to get warm bodies
into every single Maples seat.
The tickets will sell today through Friday
at two locations — from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.
at the Athletic Ticket Office and 11 a.m. to
1 p.m. in White Plaza.
No money is required to purchase the
ticket at present. All student has to do now
is to sign up, thereby contracting at the
special price and agreeing to pay for the
ticket next fall.
Only 2000 basketball tickets will be "re
served" — whether in the combo package
or separately; there will be more football

tickets available in the fall at the regular
price.
The $5 price for the basketball-only op
tion is one-third lower than last year's
$7.50 price, at which 2000 student season
tickets were sold.
"Once we sell out Maples it becomes a
hot ticket," associate head coach Bruce
Pearl said. "That's our reasoning. We were
competitive this last year, and we've got
John Revelli and Keith (ones coming back
for their senior year, so we've got reason
to believe that next year will be even bet
ter."
Two thousand student sea
son tickets were sold last sea
son, and a goal of 2500 has
been set for 1983-84. Five
hundred of those will be re
served for the freshmen. Thus,
if all 2000 student tickets are
sold, no tickets could be avail
able next year.
"I'd say that there is a very
real chance that that might
happen," Jim Colton, director
of promotions for the depart
ment said. "We're not asking

for cash up front and this com
bined package lets a student
take care of both major season
sports tickets with one shot.
"The student who buys now
is getting 22 athletic events for
$26," Colton said. "That works
out to about $1.20 per event.
You can't beat that."
"A season ticket is the only
guarantee a student has of get
ting into the major games,"
said Athletic Department ticket
manager Bette Robertson.
"That is its major benefit. It is
also important to remember
that these tickets are being
sold at a discount."
