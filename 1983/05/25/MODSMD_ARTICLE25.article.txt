junior Scott Davis, who led
Stanford to the NCAA tennis
title last week, will forego his
final year of collegiate eligibil
ity and turn pro.
Seeded second in the NCAA
singles tournament, Davis
played No. 1 singles and dou
bles for the Cardinal for most
of the year despite being
sidelined for three weeks with
mononucleosis at mid-season.

"Any time you lose a player
like Scott (Davis), graduation
or not, it hurts," Stanford ten
nis coach Dick Gould said.
"We'reobviouslygoingto miss
him, but everyone else on the
team will improve."
Davis, who was unavailable
for comment, will finish out
the academic quarter before
leaving for England. Gould said
Davis plans to play in a few
! 'warm-up" tournaments in
England and then try to qualify

for Wimbledon, which he
played in two years ago.
"Scott is in the same class as
Sandy Mayer, Roscoe Tanner,
Gene Mayer and Tim Mayotte
when they left school (at Stan
ford)," Gould said. "And they
all did very well (in the pro
ranks) quickly."
Davis, known for his aggres
sive style of play and excellent
all-around game, did not drop
a set in dual match singles play
after he lost to UCLA's Jeff
Klaparda — who also knocked
Davis out of the NCAA singles
tourney last week — in Maples
Pavilion on April 16.
Gould said Davis' a n -
nouncement did not come as a
surprise to him. "Yes, I did an
ticipate it happening," he said,
"I thought he might have done
it last year."
Davis, from Santa Monica,
played as an amateur in a
number of pro tournaments
during the early part of this
season and even had a match
against Ivan Lendl, which he
lost.
Last season, he went 20-4 in
dual matches while playing at
the No. 1 singles spot. He also
won the Pacific-10 singles title
and teamed with Jeff Arons to
capture the doubles crown as
well.
In 1981, Davis was 16-1 at the
No. 2 singles position behind
All-American Tim Mayotte on
Stanford's NCAA Champion
ship team. In 1980, he played
on the U.S. Davis Cup team
with John McEnroe and Vitas
Gerulaitis.
The Cardinal star still
holds the record for the most
junior titles with 24. He was the
top-ranked junior for four
straight years from 1977-1980.
