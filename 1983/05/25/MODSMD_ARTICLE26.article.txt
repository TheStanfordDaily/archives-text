A's win wild one
Oakland — Bill Almon was cred
ited with a steal of home in the
eighth inning when Milwaukee
catcher Ned Yost failed to hold the
pitch on a suicide squeeze that
backfired, giving the Oakland A's a
wild 8-7 victory over the Milwaukee
Brewers last night.
Almon and Jeff Burroughs opened
the inning with singles off Milwau
kee reliever Jamie Easterly, 0-1, and
advanced on Dwayne Murphy's sac

rifice. Mike Davis missed the ball at
tempting to bunt on a suicide
squeeze, but so did Yost. Almon,
breaking from third, crossed the
plate as Yost fumbled for the loose
ball.
Winning pitcher Matt Keough,
1-3, worked out of an bases-loaded,
one-out jam in the top of the eighth
by striking out Gorman Thomas and
pinch hitter Roy Howell.
Krukow leads Giants
New York — Mike Krukow
pitched a seven-hitter and Jack Clark
and Chili Davis homered to lead the
San Francisco Giants to a 6-2 victory
last night over the New York Mets.
Krukow, 3-2, won for the third
straight time since coming off the 21-
day disabled list May 12. The right
hander, who was sidelined with a

sore elbow, struck out 10 and walked
two.
Clark led off the fourth inning
with his fourth homer of the year
while Chile Davis hit his sixth of the
season, a two-run shot in ninth.
The Mets' only runs came on Dave
Kingman's seventh and eighth hom
ers of the year, in the fourth and
ninth innings.
Celtics owner to sell
Boston — Boston Celtics owner
Harry Mangurian says he wants to
sell one of the most successful teams
in National Basketball Association
history because of a strained rela
tionship with his landlords at Boston
Garden.
And he expects potential buyers
to be plentiful.
"Over the last five years that I've
been with the Celtics, I would say I
get a call once a month to see if I'm

interested in selling," Mangurian
told a news conference. "So I would
think there would be buyers out
there."
Mangurian went public Tuesday
with his intention to sell the team
and said "nothing" would change
his mind. He claimed he's dis
satisfied with the way the Celtics
have been treated by the Delaware
North Companies of Buffalo, N.Y.,
who own the Garden and the Boston
Bruins of the National Hockey
League.
"I plan on selling the Boston
Celtics, and the main reason is that I
don't want to be the person that
moves the Celtics out of Boston,"
Mangurian said. "Our relationship
with the Garden people has literally
fallen apart.
"Hopefully, a new owner could
cope with these people, but I can't."
