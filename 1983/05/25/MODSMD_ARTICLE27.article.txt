# Graduation tickets a hot item
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Commencement ticket scalping
reached hi-tech heights yesterday
when a generous senior traded his
Atari computer for three extra tick
ets.
Senior Greg Jones had an Atari 400
— a home computer that retails for
S1 SO — that he "really didn't need."
So he and his friend, senior Susan
Rice, traded the computer for three
extra tickets to Commencement.
Seniors all over campus are
scrambling for extra passes to Com
mencement because they are per
mitted only three tickets each. Stu
dents began yesterday to pick up
their tickets for the graduation cere
monies, which will be held in Frost
Amphitheater on June 12.
After (ones and Rice put up signs
advertising their computer trade on
Monday, their phones soon began
ringing off the hook.
lones eventually gave the com
puter to graduate student John Par
key for three tickets.
"I figured that was about as much
as I could ask for," he said.
But even after he had already
promised the computer, prospective
traders kept calling. Jones and Rice
offered to buy the tickets from the
callers.
Between them, the two students
made tentative agreements to collect
the number of tickets they need.
"It's still pretty nebulous," Rice

said. But she said they will probably
get four to eight extra tickets.
Other students with less spectacu
lar items to offer in exchange for
tickets had worse luck finding willing
sellers.
One student looking for tickets
who asked not to be identified said
he hadn't found any tickets cheaper
than $25.
"That seems kind of expensive,"

he said. "It's 100 percent profit for
them."
Another student said he had sold
his three tickets for $75 each.
Nan Bentley, assistant director of
Events and Services, said the Univer
sity will not take action against
Commencement ticket scalpers.
"This does happen. . . . We can't let
everyone have the number of tickets
they want."

DESPERATE FOR DUCATS: Ticket-less seniors are doing just about
anything, including putting up signs like this one, to get extra tickets for
Commencement exercises on Sunday, June 12.
