## Student protests begin over graduation speaker 
### KATHY OLMSTED Senior staff writer 
Seniors picking up their Commencement tick
ets yesterday witnessed the first stage in the pro
test against Secretary of State George Shultz's
scheduled speech here.
Volunteers at the ticket pick-up area in Tresid
der Union handed out leaflets urging graduating
seniors to wear sashes on Graduation Day to
express dissatisfaction with the Reagan adminis
tration's foreign and military policies.
The flyers also said the sashes will symbolize
the graduates' support for "human rights, self
determination and disarmament."
The protest is being organized by a coalition of
campus progressive groups. The coalition plans
to have sashes available for one-third of those
graduating.
The flyers are the first stage in a carefully

planned protest against Shultz's speech here.
Several campus groups, including the Stanford
Central American Action Network (SCAAN), the
Stanford Disarmament Lobby and the Commit
tee for lustice in the Middle East (COJME), are
members of the protest coalition.
The coalition also plans to display placards and
possibly banners inside Frost Amphitheater,
where the Commencement ceremonies will be
held )une 12.
The possibility of holding a demonstration or
disturbance outside of Frost during the cere
monies was discussed at the coalition's meeting
yesterday.
But Andrew Bennett, one of SCAAN's repre
sentatives to the coalition, said after the meeting
that there is a "strong consensus against disrupt
ing Shultz's speech."
Bennett said the groups want to avoid a dem

onstration "as destructive or counter
productive as the highly publicized demonstra
tion at UC-Berkeley against U.N. Ambassador
Jeanne Kirkpatrick.
Before the ceremony, the coalition intends to
hold a memorial service for victims of violence
and human rights violations. Ministers from the
United Campus Christian Ministries will conduct
the service.
The group also plans to present a faculty peti
tion expressing opposition to the Reagan admin
istration's human rights policies at a press con
ference on 'he morning of Commencement.
The purpose of the press conference will be to
make "as strong and as coherent a statement as
possible," according to Bennett.
At this press conference, the groups will ex
plain "why we don't like their (the Reagan admin
istration's) policies."
