House votes to revive MX
Washington — The Democratic-controlled House
voted 239-186 yesterday to revive the MX missile, pro
viding $625 million for flight tests and basing studies in
return for President Reagan's promise to propose
new arms-control initiatives.
The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to
follow suit today with final passage of the measure,
giving the president a significant victory for the con
troversial weapons system. In a test vote yesterday,
the Senate agreed on a largely party-line vote, 59-35,
not to table the MX funding resolution.
The battle over MX flight-testing and basing funds
is the first of three congressional debates on the MX
this year. It may be the most critical, because it will be
hard for members to reverse themselves in the next

few weeks when they vote on authorization of $4.78
billion more for MX production in 1984.
In a statement, Reagan called yesterday's House
vote "a wise, courageous step forward for America."
He said it "sends an important signal to the world:
Americans are uniting in a common search to protect
our security, reduce tne level of nuclear weapons and
strengthen the peace. We now look to the Senate to
send this same message."
