House votes to revive MX
Washington — The Democratic-controlled House
voted 239-186 yesterday to revive the MX missile, pro
viding $625 million for flight tests and basing studies in
return for President Reagan's promise to propose
new arms-control initiatives.
The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to
follow suit today with final passage of the measure,
giving the president a significant victory for the con
troversial weapons system. In a test vote yesterday,
the Senate agreed on a largely party-line vote, 59-35,
not to table the MX funding resolution.
The battle over MX flight-testing and basing funds
is the first of three congressional debates on the MX
this year. It may be the most critical, because it will be
hard for members to reverse themselves in the next

few weeks when they vote on authorization of $4.78
billion more for MX production in 1984.
In a statement, Reagan called yesterday's House
vote "a wise, courageous step forward for America."
He said it "sends an important signal to the world:
Americans are uniting in a common search to protect
our security, reduce tne level of nuclear weapons and
strengthen the peace. We now look to the Senate to
send this same message."
Links to be improved
Washington — President Reagan urged the
Kremlin yesterday to consider a series of steps for re
ducing the threat of accidental nuclear war. A key
Democratic senator said the DroDosal should form thp
basis for a U.S.-Soviet summit.
In a ceremony in the Rose Garden, Reagan en
dorsed Pentagon recommendations for improved
communications between the two nations, including
upgrading the "hotline" between Washington and
Moscow.
Reagan also proposed creating a military com
munications link, parallelling the hotline, that could
be used for the rapid exchange of technical military
information to reduce the risk of misunderstanding in
a crisis.
Another step calls for high-speed data transmission
systems linking the foreign ministry in Moscow with
the American Embassy, and the State Department
with the Soviet embassy in Washington.
Committee approves health bill
Washington — The House Energy and Commerce
Committee yesterday brushed aside objections from
the administration and National Governors' Associa
tion and approved, 34 to 8, a bill to create a new pro
gram of health insurance for the unemployed.
The administration objects that it would create a
costly new national entitlement program, in which
spending would be automatic each year for all who
qualified; next fiscal year's estimated federal cost
would be $2.7 billion. The governors object because it
would also force them to come up with matching
money.
But the committee was unimpressed, and seven of
the 15 Republicans joined all 27 Democrats in voting
to send the measure to the floor.
There are more than 11 million unemployed now,
many of whom lost their health insurance when they
lost their jobs. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), chair
man of Energy and Commerce's health subcommit
tee, said he did not think President Reagan "would
have the nerve" to veto the bill if it reaches him.
Steamer sinks with 600 aboard
Cairo — A Nile River steamer with more than 600
people aboard caught fire and sank today, police said.
Early reports from the scene said about 180 persons
had been rescued from the muddy, alligator-infested
waters.
Feverish rescue operations were under way, police
sources said, and local authorities requested addi
tional rescue squads, including frogmen who were
being flown to tne scene.
The sources said the steamer, on a shuttle service
between Aswan in southern Egypt and Wadi Haifa in
northern Sudan, carried 599 passengers and a crew of
28.
Most of the passengers were Sudanese, the sources
said.
Poll shows fear of entanglement
Washington — A sizable majority of Americans sees
entanglement in the problems of Central America as a
greater danger to the United States than the spread of
communism there, according to a Washington Post-
ABC News public opinion poll.
Most citizens, including many who are otherwise
strong supporters of President Reagan, said that they
sharply oppose any increase in U.S. involvement in
the struggles in Central America. By more than three
to one, for example, they reject Reagan's proposed
increase in U.S. military aid to the government of El
Salvador for its fight against leftist guerrillas.
Although a majority accepts Reagan's argument
that Central American problems "directly affect the
security and well-being of our own people," only
three of every 10 people polled say they believe they
pose a serious threat to the United States.
A broad consensus of more than 80 percent also ac
cepts Reagan's view that a rebel victory in El Salvador
could destabilize the entire region and that the Soviet
Union, Cuba and Nicaragua are working to ac
complish that end. But, by a ratio of more than two to
one, the public says that it feels "poverty and the lack
of human rights" are a greater cause of unrest in Cen
tral America than is subversion by those nations.

Reagan, House seek compromise
Washington — The Reagan administration has
opened negotiations with House Democrats on a plan
to avert a showdown now on U.S.-backed undercover
operations in Nicaragua by permitting Congress to
vote on the operations later this year, informed
sources said yesterday.
The drive for a negotiated settlement of the ex
ecutive-legislative dispute over the anti-Sandinista
forces was described by a senior member of the For
eign Affairs Committee, Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-lnd.)
as "in very early stages of consideration."
Court upholds anti-discrimation
Washington — In a stinging rebuke to the Reagan
administration, the Supreme Court yesterday upheld
eight to one the power of the Internal Revenue Ser
vice to deny tax-exempt status to private schools
which discriminate on the basis of race.
The court, in a sweeping decision written by Chief
justice Warren Burger, rejected the claims of the ad
ministration, Bob Jones University and the Goldsboro
Christian Schools that the IRS should not have cut oft
tax exemptions to these schools without specific au
thorization from Congress. The sole dissenter was Jus
tice William Rehnquist.
The Goldsboro schools, located in Goldsboro,
N.C., have refused to admit black students since the
schools were set up in 1963. Bob Jones University, a
fundamentalist Christian college in Greenville, S.C.,
denied admission to blacks until 1971, and since then
has prohibited any sort of interracial dating or mar
riage.
'AIDS' research gets grants
Washington — The nation's top public health of
ficial announced yesterday nearly $2.5 million in new
grants for additional research into the mysterious dis
ease known as AIDS — Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome.
Dr. Edward Brandt, assistant secretary for health at
the Health and Human Services Department, also said
the Food and Drug Administration has approved a
new heat treatment to reduce infectious agents in
blood products, one of the ways in which AIDS is be
lieved to be transmitted.
"It is our No. 1 priority," Brandt said of the afflic
tion, which destroys the body's ability to fight off dis
ease. "I feel a sense of great urgency about AIDS."
Foreign diplomas suspect
Hundreds of foreign medical school graduates who
are nowseekinglicensesto practice in California have
received their education from schools that are "the
source of fraudulent documents, contrived educa
tional experiences, unethical practices, and worthless
diplomas," according to the state's Board of Medical
Quality Assuranc, which licenses doctors.
Officials for the board said yesterday that they have
turned down the applications of more than 200 grad
uates of one of those schools, CETEC University in the
Dominican Republic, because of allegations that the
school has misrepresented the educational ex
perience of its students and routinely granted medi
cal degrees to some students who never set foot on
the Caribbean island.
Stocks surge despite inflation
The stock market swept aside the worst inflation
news in nine months and surged broadly higher yes
terday in trading of 110 million shares.
Nearly 1200 issues rose on the New York Stock Ex
change, with steel, auto, computer, energy and finan
cial issues pacing the advance.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed
from the opening bell and closed with an 18.48-point
gain at 1219.04 — the measure's biggest one-day rise
since April 26, when it rose 22.25 points.
Today's weather
Morning fog and low overcast becoming mostly
sunny inland in the afternoon. Lows in the 50s. Highs
in the upper 50s near the ocean to the low 80s inland.
