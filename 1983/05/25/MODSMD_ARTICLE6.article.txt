# Counter-petition gets 131 names
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
Alphonse JuiHand, chairman of the
French and Italian Department, has
collected 131 signatures on a petition
opposing the proposed Hoover in
quiry. "I know I am no administrative
genius — the fact that I have been
able to get these signatures in 10 days
is indicative of where the faculty
stands," Juilland said yesterday.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, an
organizer of the original petition
supporting the inquiry which gar
nered 86 faculty signatures, said in
reference to the counter-petition,
"this monumental effort is admira
ble, but totally irrelevant."
The faculty senate will debate )uil
land's petition, as well as the initial
Hoover petition organized by Re
bholz and Political Science Prof. John
Manley, at a meeting tomorrow.
Juilland ran a quarter-page adver
tisement in the Daily 10 days ago urg
ing faculty members to endorse his
counter-petition. Following the pub
lication of the ad, Juilland organized
an intensive campaign by mail and
sent copies of his counter-petition to
hundreds ol professors.
There are about 1100 faculty mem
bers here.
Juilland said recently that he
undertook the massive petition drive
in an effort to dispel the "mispercep
tion" that the controversy is between
the faculty and the Hoover Institu
tion. According to Juilland, the
Manley-Rebholz petition represents
a "fringe" of "ultra-liberals."
According to Rebholz, the goal of
the original petition drive was to ob
tain the 50 signatures necessary to
qualify on the senate ballot. "We got
the 50 we needed very quickly and
stopped circulating the petitions
after that," he said.
"Ithinkitisa complete falsification
to compare the petitions as evidence
of faculty opinion," Rebholz said.
Included among the 131 signers of
Juilland's counter-petition are Clas
sics Prof. Antony Raubitschek, Eco
nomics Profs. Robert Hall and James
Rosse, Sociology Prof. Joseph Be
rger, Chemistry Profs. James Col-
Iman and Carl Djerassi, Geology
Profs. Richard Jahns and Tjeerd Van
Andel, Electrical Engineering Profs.
James Angell, Ronald Bracewell and
William Shockley, History Prof.
Lewis Spitz, Political Science Profs.
Robert Horn and Robert Ward and
Law School Prof. John Kaplan. (See
back page for complete list of
counter-petition signers.)
Of the faculty senate's 53 repre
sentatives, three signed the
counter-petition: Civil Engineering
Prof. James Gere, German Prof.
Gerald Gillespie and Radiology and
Pediatrics Prof. W.H. Northway.
The debate tomorrow should be
evenly matched as Rebholz and three
other signers of the original petition
— English Prof. Anne Mellor, Medi
cal Microbiology Prof. Leon Rosen
berg and Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Bernard Roth — are also mem
bers of the faculty senate.
While Juilland's petition opposes
an investigation of alleged partisan
political activity by the Hoover In

stitution as "a grave threat ... to
academic freedom," Manley and Re
bholz contend that Juilland's petition
"in the name of protecting academic
freedom would shut down free and
open discussion of Hoover."
Those counter-petition signers
contacted by the Daily cited surpris
ingly diverse reasons for endorsing
Juilland's position.
Economics Prof. Richard Muth
said, "there is no question that the
people at Hoover are more conserva
tive than the University community
as a whole. I take that as fact." But, he
continued, "one's political beliefs
are totally irrelevant as far as
academic competence is con
cerned."
French Prof. Robert Cohn said, "it
hardly behooves a professor in the
humanities to cry 'imbalance' when
one knows as a statistical fact that all
the professors in the Quad are liberal
. . . we shouldn't worry so much
about head-counting."

According to History Prof. Freder
ick Bowser, "the language on both
sides of the issue has become exagg
erated.
"I do not think that Hoover has
been any more political than any
University department. ... I think it
is basically a non-issue. What is there
to investigate?" he said. "It seems to
me to be a tempest in a tea-cup."
Biological Sciences Prof. Alan
Campbell emphasized that he con
siders himself "liberal," but "just be
cause I disagree with their politics
doesn't mean I should be calling for
an investigation," he said.
John Troxell, a professor in the
Graduate School of Business, said, "I
think the thing is wholly unneces
sary. ... I can't understand it, I will
not support it and I hope the trustees
reject it."
Despite requests by the New York
Times and the Washington Post to
attend the faculty senate meeting
tomorrow, the meeting is closed to
all press except for University News
and Publications and the Daily.

sics Prof. Antony Raubitschek, Eco
nomics Profs. Robert Hall and James
Rosse, Sociology Prof. Joseph Be
rger, Chemistry Profs. James Col-
Iman and Carl Djerassi, Geology
Profs. Richard Jahns and Tjeerd Van
Andel, Electrical Engineering Profs.
James Angell, Ronald Bracewell and
William Shockley, History Prof.
Lewis Spitz, Political Science Profs.
Robert Horn and Robert Ward and
Law School Prof. John Kaplan. (See
back page for complete list of
counter-petition signers.)
Of the faculty senate's 53 repre
sentatives, three signed the
counter-petition: Civil Engineering
Prof. James Gere, German Prof.
Gerald Gillespie and Radiology and
Pediatrics Prof. W.H. Northway.
The debate tomorrow should be
evenly matched as Rebholz and three
other signers of the original petition
— English Prof. Anne Mellor, Medi
cal Microbiology Prof. Leon Rosen
berg and Mechanical Engineering
Prof. Bernard Roth — are also mem
bers of the faculty senate.
While Juilland's petition opposes
an investigation of alleged partisan
political activity by the Hoover In

stitution as "a grave threat ... to
academic freedom," Manley and Re
bholz contend that Juilland's petition
"in the name of protecting academic
freedom would shut down free and
open discussion of Hoover."
Those counter-petition signers
contacted by the Daily cited surpris
ingly diverse reasons for endorsing
Juilland's position.
Economics Prof. Richard Muth
said, "there is no question that the
people at Hoover are more conserva
tive than the University community
as a whole. I take that as fact." But, he
continued, "one's political beliefs
are totally irrelevant as far as
academic competence is con
cerned."
French Prof. Robert Cohn said, "it
hardly behooves a professor in the
humanities to cry 'imbalance' when
one knows as a statistical fact that all
the professors in the Quad are liberal
. . . we shouldn't worry so much
about head-counting."

According to History Prof. Freder
ick Bowser, "the language on both
sides of the issue has become exagg
erated.
"I do not think that Hoover has
been any more political than any
University department. ... I think it
is basically a non-issue. What is there
to investigate?" he said. "It seems to
me to be a tempest in a tea-cup."
Biological Sciences Prof. Alan
Campbell emphasized that he con
siders himself "liberal," but "just be
cause I disagree with their politics
doesn't mean I should be calling for
an investigation," he said.
John Troxell, a professor in the
Graduate School of Business, said, "I
think the thing is wholly unneces
sary. ... I can't understand it, I will
not support it and I hope the trustees
reject it."
Despite requests by the New York
Times and the Washington Post to
attend the faculty senate meeting
tomorrow, the meeting is closed to
all press except for University News
and Publications and the Daily.


Alphonse luilland
Alphonse JuiHand, chairman of the
French and Italian Department, has
collected 131 signatures on a petition
opposing the proposed Hoover in
quiry. "I know I am no administrative
genius — the fact that I have been
able to get these signatures in 10 days
is indicative of where the faculty
stands," Juilland said yesterday.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, an
organizer of the original petition
supporting the inquiry which gar
nered 86 faculty signatures, said in
reference to the counter-petition,
"this monumental effort is admira
ble, but totally irrelevant."
The faculty senate will debate )uil
land's petition, as well as the initial
Hoover petition organized by Re
bholz and Political Science Prof. John
Manley, at a meeting tomorrow.
Juilland ran a quarter-page adver
tisement in the Daily 10 days ago urg
ing faculty members to endorse his
counter-petition. Following the pub
lication of the ad, Juilland organized
an intensive campaign by mail and
sent copies of his counter-petition to
hundreds ol professors.
There are about 1100 faculty mem
bers here.
Juilland said recently that he
undertook the massive petition drive
in an effort to dispel the "mispercep
tion" that the controversy is between
the faculty and the Hoover Institu
tion. According to Juilland, the
Manley-Rebholz petition represents
a "fringe" of "ultra-liberals."
According to Rebholz, the goal of
the original petition drive was to ob
tain the 50 signatures necessary to
qualify on the senate ballot. "We got
the 50 we needed very quickly and
stopped circulating the petitions
after that," he said.
"Ithinkitisa complete falsification
to compare the petitions as evidence
of faculty opinion," Rebholz said.

Juilland's counter-petition are Clas
