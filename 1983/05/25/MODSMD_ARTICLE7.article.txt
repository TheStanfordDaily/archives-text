# ASSU reorganization approved
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
During a four-hour meeting last night, the 14th ASSU
senate unanimously passed the bulk of a bill which
rewrote the operating rules for groups including the
I'ublications Board, the Program Board and the
â€¢\cademic Organizations Board.
The senate voted to table some of the more controver
sial stipulations of the reorganization bill, which some
senators seemed to think threatened the autonomy of
other student groups, and to consider them at its first
meeting next year. Two weeks ago the 13th senate
passed another section of the bill, dealing with the
Guest Professorship Board.
The legislation, authored by returning graduate
senator |im McGrath, was passed despite the fact that
only five of the 15 voting senators said they were familiar
with both the bill and the by-laws it would replace.

"People aren't aware of what they're changing,"
senator Donna Anderson said.
McCrath told the senate that the bill was needed in
order for the various organizations it affects to get off to
a smooth start next year. "Bureaucratic foul-ups'' would
result if the bill was not passed, he said.
David Porter, another returning senator, disagreed
with McCrath. The organizations could "continue to
operate" under the current rules, he said, and could
consider the reorganization next year after having
studied the bill and the by-laws "in detail."
After the senate voted to consider the bill, it was
debated section by section as McC.rath explained the
impact oi each proposed change. Council of Presidents
member Pete Spivack and two returning senators in
addition to Porter, raised questions about the legislation
"Be wary of legislating yourself into a corner that you
can t get out of," Spivack said early in the meeting.
The bill, single spaced on 16 pages, is largely directed
toward standardizing and clarifying the organizational
procedures of ASSU organizations. But Spivack and Por
ter both said they feared that many seemingly innocuous
stipulations could have far-reaching implications.
One highly controversial section which was eventu
ally tabled would have given "ultimate authority over
assignment of space within the Storke Student Publica
tions Building" to the Publications Board. Spivack said
this might threaten some student publications currently
using the building.
In a report to the senate, Nathan Brostrom and En
rique Lerner, co-chairs of the GPB, said they are cur
rently focusing their attention on planning for next year.
The GPB is currently involved in serious negotiations
with authors Alex Haley and Chaim Potok and former
congressman Father Robert Drinan.
The senate elected Anderson, a freshman, to the posi
i tion of deputy senate chair in a secret ballot.
Senator Chris O'Brien said, "What she lacks in experi-
R ence she makes up for with her enthusiasm." Anderson
Bj is president of Roble Hall this quarter.
The deputy chair replaces the senate chair at meetings
I when the chair is absent.
The senate also approved the nomination of Mindy
Basham to the position of student financial manager.
