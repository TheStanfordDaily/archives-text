# Athletes get summer job boost
## 
### BOB COHN Staff writer 
While many students are suffering from the unem
ployed summertime blues, varsity athletes enjoy a
"working relationship" with alumni and the football
program which can give them a leg-up in the student
job market.
"In order to play the game so that we have an equal
chance to recruit athletes, we are involved in a sum
mer employment program just like every other NCAA
school," said Dick James, administrative assistant for
football.
The football program has accepted "the adminis
trative responsibility of securing summer employ
ment for football and helping as many other sports as
possible," James explained. Assistant football coach
David Ottmar, who heads this summer employment
service, was unavailable for comment as he is out of
town on an extensive recruiting trip.
Assistant volleyball coach Don Shaw said, "If we
have a guy say, 'I really need a job for the summer,'
we'll talk to the coaches on the football program. If
they have them available, we'll jump in and get the
jobs."
Water polo coach Dante Dettamanti said his
players sometimes secure employment "through
alumni and jobs around here at the pool." Asked why
this service is provided, he said, "There aren't that
many jobs available. . . . We like to help if we can."

Sophomore runners Pat Fox and Brian Pettingill
have appealed to track coach Brooks Johnson for jobs
in the Los Angeles area this summer. "We told him
we'd be living together and running together and
training together, and hecould make it more possible
by finding us jobs," said Fox. Because neither of them
hails from Southern California, they had no job re
sources of their own.
Johnson has secured "good jobs" for athletes in
the past, according to Fox. While their main prospect
— testing methane gas levels in dumps — is still up in
the air, Fox said that whatever they get will probably
"be lucrative."
Another example of an employment aid program is
a "hashing grant." Wrestling coach Chris Horpel de
scribed it as "a form of wrestling scholarship. He (the
recipient) gets money for the amount of board for
winter quarter, which is the wrestling season. It's an
attempt to alleviate some of the time" demands of the
sport.
Students on hashing grants work for food service
during the off-season and receive similar pay for par
ticipating intercoilegiately during the season itself.
Hashing grants are a way to combine both athletic
and University aid, Horpel said.
Dave Holmes, a freshman wrestler currently receiv
ing a hashing grant, said, "I just get a check from the
Athletic Department for what should be equivalent to
what I would make if I hashed that quarter."
