## CERAS: a modern architectural home for LOTS 
### CHUCK MEYER 
The Center for Educational Research at Stanford is best known as the
home of Stanford's Low Overhead Timesharing System (LOTS). But CERAS
was not originally intended to be the home of LOTS. When Stanford com
bined $ J million of its own money with the $3.7 million it was granted by the
United States Office of Education, it intended to build what it then called the
Stanford Center for Research and Development in Teaching.
Ihe Center's goal was to improve the quality of teaching in U.S. schools
through the use of modern technology and new advances in the behavioral
sciences. It conducts basic and applied research, producing knowledge and
protoype programs, materials and procedures useful in training teachers
and in reshaping the education setting.
With these intentions made clear to them, architects Skidmore, Owings
and Merrill set out to design a building which would most practically serve its
users. They were responsible for all aspects of the project, including the
architecture, engineering, interior decoration and space planning. Project
architect ]ohn Woodbridge emphasized the importance of the School of
Education's input.
The result of the consultation and design process is the functional CERAS
building which now stands along Galvez Street, within a frisbee's toss of
both Meyer and Green libraries.

Most of the researchers at CERAS formerly worked in rented space about a
mile from campus. The space was too small for all education-related re
search, so many projects are housed in various other locations.
But the CERAS building brings them together under one parallelogram
shaped roof and thus aids in inter-project collaboration.
The single greatest success of the building design is the flexibility which it
allows. The flexibility is best exemplified by the iSOO square-feet of research
laboratory space which permits changes in spatial arrangements through the
use of partitionally separated office are,is. The booklet, A New Building for
Educational Research and Development, states the intent of the interior
design: Reflecting the current trend toward open-space schools, the work
spaces for the Center personnel have been designed with "open-office
landscaping which largely eliminates floor-to-ceiling partitions and thus
encourages interaction among Center staff while providing necessary audi
tory privacy.
In actuality, the auditory privacy was merely a planner's dream. "The
acoustics are so bad," said graduate student lohn Agnew, "that if there's a
meeting going on in a nearby office, I can't get anything done."
Agnew, a student in the School of Education who works in the building,
said of the partition system: "I appreciate the increased circulation of fresh
air caused by the openness, and it is easier to get to know your neighbors
here, but I don't like the lack of privacy and security."

[ he tloors on either side of the main level are off-set from each other, five
stories have cleverly been overlapped to create a total height closer to that of
a conventional four story building. The level offset not only adds a novel
twist to the building design, but also keeps the office workers on different
floors in closer contact with each other. The parallelogram shape of the
building is reflected in each of the individual tiles of the sun roof. A geomet
rical optical illusion occurs toward the far end of the building as the paral
lelograms gradually appear to straighten into rectangles.
With respect to spatial or energy efficiency, CERAS does not top any lists.
Its 60,000 gross square feet of space which cost just a little less than $100
a piece allows only about 65 percent, or 39,000 square teet to actually
be assigned for use. Although the design might have easily been adapted to
be more energy efficient, the engineers for the project chose to take the
initially inexpensive route since energy was relatively cheap in the early
1970s when the building was completed. Because ofthisCEÃŸASis now one of
the most energy-consuming buildings on campus.
If one's attention is transferred from efficiencey to the aesthetic pleasures
which CERAS offers, the building rates much higher. While the landscaping
surrounding the building conforms completley to the established University
pattern of grassy plots mixed with tree and bush lined paths, the building
itself conforms to Stanford architectural styling only in its beige body and
red roof.
The corduroy-like ridges of concrete in the wall form an irregular stepped
outline as they descend from roof to ground level. The roof is made of red
metal rather than tiles, and in this way adheres to the original plan to use
modern technology in construction wherever possible.
Overall, the CERAS building has successfully adapted to its additional role
as home of the LOTS computer faciltiy. The bright lights that hang high
above the LOTS "B" terminals may seldom or never be used inthemakingof
films.
This flexibility is the beauty of the CERAS design. The unforseen cuts to
educational research funding have forced the television studio and the
atrium lobby to become cluttered with terminals. The entire first floor, in fact
has been taken over by the various computer components, even though the
original plans called for "no satellite computer" within the building.

LOTS OF FUN: The inside of CERAS is familiar to many computer science
students here. Although the building was not originally intended to house
the LOTS computer, CERAS is best known as the site of all-nighters and
computer print-outs.


FLOOR SHOW: The original floor plan for CERAS was designed to
comfortably house the School of Education. The building now houses the
LOTS computer and numerous offices.

dows, red metal roof and angular structure of CKRAS are readily appa
rent.
