## Truman Scholar Shawnadean Bateman handles classes, kids PROFILE:

Do these sound like the cre
dentials of the average Stan
ford student? Maybe not, but
Shawnadean Bateman, winner
of a four-year $20,000 Truman
Scholarship, is not the average
student here.
At 22, Bateman is now finish
ing her second quarter at the
Farm as a sophomore. The
junior college that she at
tended autumn quarter nomi
nated her for the Truman
Scholarship — one of 1000
applicants from around the
state. A few months later, dur
ing April, she learned that she
had been awarded the pre
stigious scholarship. There is
one recipient from each state
and an additional 50 "scholars
at large" from around the
country. Bateman was the win
ner from California and repre
sented the state at the conven
tion of scholarship winners in
Missouri.
Bright, ambitious and confi
dent, Bateman needed these
traits to bring herself along the
often difficult path that has led
her to where she is today. She
was born and raised in the east

side of San jose, in a very poor
neighborhood where many
children could not read and
often came from broken
families. Bateman's parents
were divorced when she was
younger. At 14, she decided
that she had to improve her
situation. She dropped out of
high school, moved into a tiny
apartment in Sunnyvale and
got a job as an electronics
technician by lying about her
a ge — she said she was 20 —
and about her experience. She
told the company that she had
had two years of experience,
when she had only read a man
ual about electronics. Two
years later she married Bruce
Bateman, a "physics wiz" out
of UC-Berkeley. A year later
she had her first child, Craig.
And a year and a half ago the
Batemans had their second
son, Eric.
When Craig was a couple of
months old, Bateman, with her
husband's encouragement,
began taking courses at a
junior college. Gradually her
confidence and self-esteem in
creased as she caught up with
what she had missed in high
school and went on into col
lege preparatory courses.

Eventually she applied to Stan
ford and began school here
this winter quarter.
Though she has raised her
self out of her poverty, she has
not turned her back upon it.
She continues to lend her fam
ily (her mother and older
brother who work, and 10 year
old brother who is in school)
financial assistance and moral
support. The problems of the
poor are very important to
Bateman. "People that are out
of that situation are not really
aware of what it's like to be in
the situation," she said. But
Bateman is aware of the situa
tion and wishes to aid those
facing poverty.
"I want to help people that
are in ignorance and in poverty
understand what their re
sources are, what their options
are so they can improve their
standard of living and get out
of it . . . some people are in
poverty because they're lazy,
but that's a very small minority.
Most people are there because
they don't know how to get
out, and they don't know what
resources are available to
them. So that's basically what I
want to do — let them know
what their options are," she

said.
Ignorance, she feels, is the
major barrier to ending one's
poverty. She told a story of a
poor couple from her neigh
borhood who were unable to
buy enough food for their fam
ily with food stamps because
they did not realize how they
could both save money and
better their nutrition.
Her wish to help people out
of such situations was an im
portant part of her winning the
Truman Scholarship. It is
awarded to people who wish to
enter government service, and
requires that the recipients
complete an internship in
Washington while in school.
With the emphasis on politics,
it is strange that Bateman, who
is a pre-medical student,
applied for the scholarship.
But she is not a straight science
pre-med. With a strong inter
est in the humanities, she said
that a solid base in economics,
political science and history is
also important to her. When
she graduates from medical
school, she intends to enter
the Peace Corps. Finally, she
said that she hopes to use her
medical degree to give care to

SHAWNADEAN BATEMAN: 1983 Truman Scholar Shawnadean Bateman received her award
from Margaret Truman Daniel, the daughter of late President Truman, at the Truman Library
in Independence Missouri. Bateman, a sophomore here, will receive a maximum of $5000 per
year for up to four years of education preparing her for a career in public service.
people in poorer areas. Shaw
nadean said that she would like
to work in public policy ad
ministrating programs that
would benefit communities
without adequate medical
care. Therefore even though
she is not going directly into

politics, Bateman intends to
use her scholarship and educa
tion to aid the public.
Bateman admitted that she
used to be more selfish. When
she left home at 14, she only
thought about what she could
take from the world, for she
was somewhat bitter of the
poverty into which she had
been born, she said. But she
soon learned that taking didn't
satisfy her. "The only way to

improve the world is to give to
it and not take from it. The
smaller accomplishments were
sweeter when they were given
rather than taken," she said.
Now Bateman works in many
ways to bring to others some of
the happiness she has found
for herself. She keeps in close
touch with relatives; she vol
unteers her time at Santa
Theresa Hospital in San Jose,
where she works a great deal

with the elderly. "I have a soft
spot for them," she said. She is
also involved in a support
group for women who need
help with their children or just
need a friend. Dabbling in poli
tics, Bateman took it upon her
self to circulate a petition con
cerning contaminated water
near the Fairchild Plant in San
Jose. Her desire to give to
others is summed up in her
modest philosophy: "I know
that I can't change the WHOLE
world; but I'm going to do a
damn good job with my corner
of it."
Bateman has a basically op
timistic view of other people
which is tempered by her ob
servation that people don't
love each other enough. She
feels that everyone ought to
feel responsible for the well
being of others. "Basically, we
as individuals should reach out
to people around us and make
their lives better. . . . People
should feel angered and out
raged when something bad is
done to another human be
ing," she said.

At Stanford, this problem
manifests itself in students'
political activism, which she
said is somewhat of a decep
tion. "We talk a lot, we scream
a lot, we yell a lot, but we don't
do a lot," she said. She
suggests that people concen
trate more on the things that
one can personally affect
through one's interactions
with-others — first by solidify
ing one's own base and then
expanding to help relatives,
friends and one's community.
Overall though, Bateman
loves Stanford. "I'm delighted
to find so many intelligent, ar
ticulate, committed, idealistic
people here. There's really a
lot of very good people at Stan
ford. It's a great atmosphere,"
she said. Like many of us, she
felt alone the first quarter here.
But she has turned this into a
positive experience by proc
laiming that she will be a per
sonal guide for all her friends
who are coming here next
year, so that they will adjust
more readily to life on the
Farm.

She has been able to get to
know many friends at Stanford,
despite her not living on cam
pus. She leaves before 8 a.m.
from her home and returns at
5:30 p.m. The time includes 2 V2
hours of travel, the classes she
takes, studying time and
socializing time. When she re
turns home, she spends the
evening with her husband and
playing with her kids, until they
go to sleep. Then she goes
back to her studying, which
takes her into the late hours of
the night. When asked if it is
difficult to lead such a double
life, she replied that she loves
it. Having kids is fun, she said.
It keeps her young, since she
enjoys doing "kid stuff" like
water sliding, skiing and roller
skating, she added.
In addition it has helped to
change her outlook on life —
. . from a life centered
around myself to one where I
am a giving nurturer." She be
lieves that this will help her to
be a better doctor. She is actu
ally lucky to have had kids so
young, she stated, because by

the time she entered medical
school, her children will not be
as dependent upon her.
She notes that the issue of a
career is a difficult one for most
women. For her, though, it was
easy because her husband was
so encouraging. She said that
he is a complete partner in
their family — and every bit as
good a nurturer as she. Bate
man points out that all men can
be as good nurturers as women
except for two problems:
men's machoism and women's
fear that their niche is being
invaded. But Bateman and her
husband, Bruce, don't have
that problem, and for that rea
son have a very healthy rela
tionship, she said. About
Bruce, she said, "He's the
thing in my life that makes ev
erything wonderful. We've
been married for about six
years now and I'm madly in
love with him. What can I
say?!"
One can say of Bateman that
she has built quite a life for
herself out of a little idealism
and a lot of giving.

Missouri.
Bright, ambitious and confi
dent, Bateman needed these
traits to bring herself along the
often difficult path that has led
her to where she is today. She
was born and raised in the east

side of San jose, in a very poor
neighborhood where many
children could not read and
often came from broken
families. Bateman's parents
were divorced when she was
younger. At 14, she decided
that she had to improve her
situation. She dropped out of
high school, moved into a tiny
apartment in Sunnyvale and
got a job as an electronics
technician by lying about her
a ge — she said she was 20 —
and about her experience. She
told the company that she had
had two years of experience,
when she had only read a man
ual about electronics. Two
years later she married Bruce
Bateman, a "physics wiz" out
of UC-Berkeley. A year later
she had her first child, Craig.
And a year and a half ago the
Batemans had their second
son, Eric.
When Craig was a couple of
months old, Bateman, with her
husband's encouragement,
began taking courses at a
junior college. Gradually her
confidence and self-esteem in
creased as she caught up with
what she had missed in high
school and went on into col
lege preparatory courses.

Eventually she applied to Stan
ford and began school here
this winter quarter.
Though she has raised her
self out of her poverty, she has
not turned her back upon it.
She continues to lend her fam
ily (her mother and older
brother who work, and 10 year
old brother who is in school)
financial assistance and moral
support. The problems of the
poor are very important to
Bateman. "People that are out
of that situation are not really
aware of what it's like to be in
the situation," she said. But
Bateman is aware of the situa
tion and wishes to aid those
facing poverty.
"I want to help people that
are in ignorance and in poverty
understand what their re
sources are, what their options
are so they can improve their
standard of living and get out
of it . . . some people are in
poverty because they're lazy,
but that's a very small minority.
Most people are there because
they don't know how to get
out, and they don't know what
resources are available to
them. So that's basically what I
want to do — let them know
what their options are," she

said.
Ignorance, she feels, is the
major barrier to ending one's
poverty. She told a story of a
poor couple from her neigh
borhood who were unable to
buy enough food for their fam
ily with food stamps because
they did not realize how they
could both save money and
better their nutrition.
Her wish to help people out
of such situations was an im
portant part of her winning the
Truman Scholarship. It is
awarded to people who wish to
enter government service, and
requires that the recipients
complete an internship in
Washington while in school.
With the emphasis on politics,
it is strange that Bateman, who
is a pre-medical student,
applied for the scholarship.
But she is not a straight science
pre-med. With a strong inter
est in the humanities, she said
that a solid base in economics,
political science and history is
also important to her. When
she graduates from medical
school, she intends to enter
the Peace Corps. Finally, she
said that she hopes to use her
medical degree to give care to

SHAWNADEAN BATEMAN: 1983 Truman Scholar Shawnadean Bateman received her award
from Margaret Truman Daniel, the daughter of late President Truman, at the Truman Library
in Independence Missouri. Bateman, a sophomore here, will receive a maximum of $5000 per
year for up to four years of education preparing her for a career in public service.
people in poorer areas. Shaw
nadean said that she would like
to work in public policy ad
ministrating programs that
would benefit communities
without adequate medical
care. Therefore even though
she is not going directly into

politics, Bateman intends to
use her scholarship and educa
tion to aid the public.
Bateman admitted that she
used to be more selfish. When
she left home at 14, she only
thought about what she could
take from the world, for she
was somewhat bitter of the
poverty into which she had
been born, she said. But she
soon learned that taking didn't
satisfy her. "The only way to

improve the world is to give to
it and not take from it. The
smaller accomplishments were
sweeter when they were given
rather than taken," she said.
Now Bateman works in many
ways to bring to others some of
the happiness she has found
for herself. She keeps in close
touch with relatives; she vol
unteers her time at Santa
Theresa Hospital in San Jose,
where she works a great deal

with the elderly. "I have a soft
spot for them," she said. She is
also involved in a support
group for women who need
help with their children or just
need a friend. Dabbling in poli
tics, Bateman took it upon her
self to circulate a petition con
cerning contaminated water
near the Fairchild Plant in San
Jose. Her desire to give to
others is summed up in her
modest philosophy: "I know
that I can't change the WHOLE
world; but I'm going to do a
damn good job with my corner
of it."
Bateman has a basically op
timistic view of other people
which is tempered by her ob
servation that people don't
love each other enough. She
feels that everyone ought to
feel responsible for the well
being of others. "Basically, we
as individuals should reach out
to people around us and make
their lives better. . . . People
should feel angered and out
raged when something bad is
done to another human be
ing," she said.

At Stanford, this problem
manifests itself in students'
political activism, which she
said is somewhat of a decep
tion. "We talk a lot, we scream
a lot, we yell a lot, but we don't
do a lot," she said. She
suggests that people concen
trate more on the things that
one can personally affect
through one's interactions
with-others — first by solidify
ing one's own base and then
expanding to help relatives,
friends and one's community.
Overall though, Bateman
loves Stanford. "I'm delighted
to find so many intelligent, ar
ticulate, committed, idealistic
people here. There's really a
lot of very good people at Stan
ford. It's a great atmosphere,"
she said. Like many of us, she
felt alone the first quarter here.
But she has turned this into a
positive experience by proc
laiming that she will be a per
sonal guide for all her friends
who are coming here next
year, so that they will adjust
more readily to life on the
Farm.

She has been able to get to
know many friends at Stanford,
despite her not living on cam
pus. She leaves before 8 a.m.
from her home and returns at
5:30 p.m. The time includes 2 V2
hours of travel, the classes she
takes, studying time and
socializing time. When she re
turns home, she spends the
evening with her husband and
playing with her kids, until they
go to sleep. Then she goes
back to her studying, which
takes her into the late hours of
the night. When asked if it is
difficult to lead such a double
life, she replied that she loves
it. Having kids is fun, she said.
It keeps her young, since she
enjoys doing "kid stuff" like
water sliding, skiing and roller
skating, she added.
In addition it has helped to
change her outlook on life —
. . from a life centered
around myself to one where I
am a giving nurturer." She be
lieves that this will help her to
be a better doctor. She is actu
ally lucky to have had kids so
young, she stated, because by

the time she entered medical
school, her children will not be
as dependent upon her.
She notes that the issue of a
career is a difficult one for most
women. For her, though, it was
easy because her husband was
so encouraging. She said that
he is a complete partner in
their family — and every bit as
good a nurturer as she. Bate
man points out that all men can
be as good nurturers as women
except for two problems:
men's machoism and women's
fear that their niche is being
invaded. But Bateman and her
husband, Bruce, don't have
that problem, and for that rea
son have a very healthy rela
tionship, she said. About
Bruce, she said, "He's the
thing in my life that makes ev
erything wonderful. We've
been married for about six
years now and I'm madly in
love with him. What can I
say?!"
One can say of Bateman that
she has built quite a life for
herself out of a little idealism
and a lot of giving.

And a year and a half ago the
Batemans had their second
son, Eric.
When Craig was a couple of
months old, Bateman, with her
husband's encouragement,
began taking courses at a
junior college. Gradually her
confidence and self-esteem in
creased as she caught up with
what she had missed in high
school and went on into col
lege preparatory courses.

Eventually she applied to Stan
ford and began school here
this winter quarter.
Though she has raised her
self out of her poverty, she has
not turned her back upon it.
She continues to lend her fam
ily (her mother and older
brother who work, and 10 year
old brother who is in school)
financial assistance and moral
support. The problems of the
poor are very important to
Bateman. "People that are out
of that situation are not really
aware of what it's like to be in
the situation," she said. But
Bateman is aware of the situa
tion and wishes to aid those
facing poverty.
"I want to help people that
are in ignorance and in poverty
understand what their re
sources are, what their options
are so they can improve their
standard of living and get out
of it . . . some people are in
poverty because they're lazy,
but that's a very small minority.
Most people are there because
they don't know how to get
out, and they don't know what
resources are available to
them. So that's basically what I
want to do — let them know
what their options are," she

said.
Ignorance, she feels, is the
major barrier to ending one's
poverty. She told a story of a
poor couple from her neigh
borhood who were unable to
buy enough food for their fam
ily with food stamps because
they did not realize how they
could both save money and
better their nutrition.
Her wish to help people out
of such situations was an im
portant part of her winning the
Truman Scholarship. It is
awarded to people who wish to
enter government service, and
requires that the recipients
complete an internship in
Washington while in school.
With the emphasis on politics,
it is strange that Bateman, who
is a pre-medical student,
applied for the scholarship.
But she is not a straight science
pre-med. With a strong inter
est in the humanities, she said
that a solid base in economics,
political science and history is
also important to her. When
she graduates from medical
school, she intends to enter
the Peace Corps. Finally, she
said that she hopes to use her
medical degree to give care to

SHAWNADEAN BATEMAN: 1983 Truman Scholar Shawnadean Bateman received her award
from Margaret Truman Daniel, the daughter of late President Truman, at the Truman Library
in Independence Missouri. Bateman, a sophomore here, will receive a maximum of $5000 per
year for up to four years of education preparing her for a career in public service.
people in poorer areas. Shaw
nadean said that she would like
to work in public policy ad
ministrating programs that
would benefit communities
without adequate medical
care. Therefore even though
she is not going directly into

politics, Bateman intends to
use her scholarship and educa
tion to aid the public.
Bateman admitted that she
used to be more selfish. When
she left home at 14, she only
thought about what she could
take from the world, for she
was somewhat bitter of the
poverty into which she had
been born, she said. But she
soon learned that taking didn't
satisfy her. "The only way to

improve the world is to give to
it and not take from it. The
smaller accomplishments were
sweeter when they were given
rather than taken," she said.
Now Bateman works in many
ways to bring to others some of
the happiness she has found
for herself. She keeps in close
touch with relatives; she vol
unteers her time at Santa
Theresa Hospital in San Jose,
where she works a great deal

with the elderly. "I have a soft
spot for them," she said. She is
also involved in a support
group for women who need
help with their children or just
need a friend. Dabbling in poli
tics, Bateman took it upon her
self to circulate a petition con
cerning contaminated water
near the Fairchild Plant in San
Jose. Her desire to give to
others is summed up in her
modest philosophy: "I know
that I can't change the WHOLE
world; but I'm going to do a
damn good job with my corner
of it."
Bateman has a basically op
timistic view of other people
which is tempered by her ob
servation that people don't
love each other enough. She
feels that everyone ought to
feel responsible for the well
being of others. "Basically, we
as individuals should reach out
to people around us and make
their lives better. . . . People
should feel angered and out
raged when something bad is
done to another human be
ing," she said.

At Stanford, this problem
manifests itself in students'
political activism, which she
said is somewhat of a decep
tion. "We talk a lot, we scream
a lot, we yell a lot, but we don't
do a lot," she said. She
suggests that people concen
trate more on the things that
one can personally affect
through one's interactions
with-others — first by solidify
ing one's own base and then
expanding to help relatives,
friends and one's community.
Overall though, Bateman
loves Stanford. "I'm delighted
to find so many intelligent, ar
ticulate, committed, idealistic
people here. There's really a
lot of very good people at Stan
ford. It's a great atmosphere,"
she said. Like many of us, she
felt alone the first quarter here.
But she has turned this into a
positive experience by proc
laiming that she will be a per
sonal guide for all her friends
who are coming here next
year, so that they will adjust
more readily to life on the
Farm.

She has been able to get to
know many friends at Stanford,
despite her not living on cam
pus. She leaves before 8 a.m.
from her home and returns at
5:30 p.m. The time includes 2 V2
hours of travel, the classes she
takes, studying time and
socializing time. When she re
turns home, she spends the
evening with her husband and
playing with her kids, until they
go to sleep. Then she goes
back to her studying, which
takes her into the late hours of
the night. When asked if it is
difficult to lead such a double
life, she replied that she loves
it. Having kids is fun, she said.
It keeps her young, since she
enjoys doing "kid stuff" like
water sliding, skiing and roller
skating, she added.
In addition it has helped to
change her outlook on life —
. . from a life centered
around myself to one where I
am a giving nurturer." She be
lieves that this will help her to
be a better doctor. She is actu
ally lucky to have had kids so
young, she stated, because by

the time she entered medical
school, her children will not be
as dependent upon her.
She notes that the issue of a
career is a difficult one for most
women. For her, though, it was
easy because her husband was
so encouraging. She said that
he is a complete partner in
their family — and every bit as
good a nurturer as she. Bate
man points out that all men can
be as good nurturers as women
except for two problems:
men's machoism and women's
fear that their niche is being
invaded. But Bateman and her
husband, Bruce, don't have
that problem, and for that rea
son have a very healthy rela
tionship, she said. About
Bruce, she said, "He's the
thing in my life that makes ev
erything wonderful. We've
been married for about six
years now and I'm madly in
love with him. What can I
say?!"
One can say of Bateman that
she has built quite a life for
herself out of a little idealism
and a lot of giving.

Shawnadean Bateman
Dropped out of high school
at the age of 14. Married at 16.
Do these sound like the cre
dentials of the average Stan
ford student? Maybe not, but
Shawnadean Bateman, winner
of a four-year $20,000 Truman
Scholarship, is not the average
student here.
At 22, Bateman is now finish
ing her second quarter at the
Farm as a sophomore. The
junior college that she at
tended autumn quarter nomi
nated her for the Truman
Scholarship — one of 1000
applicants from around the
state. A few months later, dur
ing April, she learned that she
had been awarded the pre
stigious scholarship. There is
one recipient from each state
and an additional 50 "scholars
at large" from around the
country. Bateman was the win
ner from California and repre
sented the state at the conven
tion of scholarship winners in
Missouri.
Bright, ambitious and confi
dent, Bateman needed these
traits to bring herself along the
often difficult path that has led
her to where she is today. She
was born and raised in the east

side of San jose, in a very poor
neighborhood where many
children could not read and
often came from broken
families. Bateman's parents
were divorced when she was
younger. At 14, she decided
that she had to improve her
situation. She dropped out of
high school, moved into a tiny
apartment in Sunnyvale and
got a job as an electronics
technician by lying about her
a ge — she said she was 20 —
and about her experience. She
told the company that she had
had two years of experience,
when she had only read a man
ual about electronics. Two
years later she married Bruce
Bateman, a "physics wiz" out
of UC-Berkeley. A year later
she had her first child, Craig.
And a year and a half ago the
Batemans had their second
son, Eric.
When Craig was a couple of
months old, Bateman, with her
husband's encouragement,
began taking courses at a
