Do these sound like the cre
dentials of the average Stan
ford student? Maybe not, but
Shawnadean Bateman, winner
of a four-year $20,000 Truman
Scholarship, is not the average
student here.
At 22, Bateman is now finish
ing her second quarter at the
Farm as a sophomore. The
junior college that she at
tended autumn quarter nomi
nated her for the Truman
Scholarship — one of 1000
applicants from around the
state. A few months later, dur
ing April, she learned that she
had been awarded the pre
stigious scholarship. There is
one recipient from each state
and an additional 50 "scholars
at large" from around the
country. Bateman was the win
ner from California and repre
sented the state at the conven
tion of scholarship winners in
Missouri.
Bright, ambitious and confi
dent, Bateman needed these
traits to bring herself along the
often difficult path that has led
her to where she is today. She
was born and raised in the east

side of San jose, in a very poor
neighborhood where many
children could not read and
often came from broken
families. Bateman's parents
were divorced when she was
younger. At 14, she decided
that she had to improve her
situation. She dropped out of
high school, moved into a tiny
apartment in Sunnyvale and
got a job as an electronics
technician by lying about her
a ge — she said she was 20 —
and about her experience. She
told the company that she had
had two years of experience,
when she had only read a man
ual about electronics. Two
years later she married Bruce
Bateman, a "physics wiz" out
of UC-Berkeley. A year later
she had her first child, Craig.
And a year and a half ago the
Batemans had their second
son, Eric.
When Craig was a couple of
months old, Bateman, with her
husband's encouragement,
began taking courses at a
junior college. Gradually her
confidence and self-esteem in
creased as she caught up with
what she had missed in high
school and went on into col
lege preparatory courses.

Eventually she applied to Stan
ford and began school here
this winter quarter.
Though she has raised her
self out of her poverty, she has
not turned her back upon it.
She continues to lend her fam
ily (her mother and older
brother who work, and 10 year
old brother who is in school)
financial assistance and moral
support. The problems of the
poor are very important to
Bateman. "People that are out
of that situation are not really
aware of what it's like to be in
the situation," she said. But
Bateman is aware of the situa
tion and wishes to aid those
facing poverty.
"I want to help people that
are in ignorance and in poverty
understand what their re
sources are, what their options
are so they can improve their
standard of living and get out
of it . . . some people are in
poverty because they're lazy,
but that's a very small minority.
Most people are there because
they don't know how to get
out, and they don't know what
resources are available to
them. So that's basically what I
want to do — let them know
what their options are," she

said.
Ignorance, she feels, is the
major barrier to ending one's
poverty. She told a story of a
poor couple from her neigh
borhood who were unable to
buy enough food for their fam
ily with food stamps because
they did not realize how they
could both save money and
better their nutrition.
Her wish to help people out
of such situations was an im
portant part of her winning the
Truman Scholarship. It is
awarded to people who wish to
enter government service, and
requires that the recipients
complete an internship in
Washington while in school.
With the emphasis on politics,
it is strange that Bateman, who
is a pre-medical student,
applied for the scholarship.
But she is not a straight science
pre-med. With a strong inter
est in the humanities, she said
that a solid base in economics,
political science and history is
also important to her. When
she graduates from medical
school, she intends to enter
the Peace Corps. Finally, she
said that she hopes to use her
medical degree to give care to
