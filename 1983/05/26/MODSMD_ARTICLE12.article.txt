## The
						Stanford Daily Center for Arms Control 
### 
Perhaps one of the most constructive results
of the nation's growing concern with nuclear
weapons is the increased emphasis which vari
ous institutions have placed on studying arms
control and international security. A recent de
velopment in this trend, increased financial
support for university-level disarmament pro
grams, happened here last week in the form of a
$600,000 grant from the Hewlett Foundation.
The grant is earmarked for the University's Cen
ter for International Security and Arms Control.
We welcome this grant which will make it possi
ble to expand and improve and Center's pro
gram, already considered one of the best in the
country.
According to Coit Blacker, associate director,
the Center's primary goal is the promotion of
undergraduate education. The expansion of the
arms control course sequence from two to three
quarters is a good step in this direction. It also
seems likely that an expanded program for
graduate and post-doctoral fellowships will en
rich educational opportunities for the Univer
sity community as a whole through the Center's
public outreach program.
Although we are generally very enthusiastic

about the expansion and intensification of the
Center's efforts, we are wary about the idea of
proposed weekend seminars and summer pro
grams which would address "targeted" groups
like congressional staffs and journalists.
Clearly there is a need for such an "educa
tional" program. Arms issues are by their nature
complex and there is sometimes an alarming
lack of understanding among those charged
with the making of policy. However, there is a
fine line between those activities which are con
sidered educational and what is commonly con
sidered lobbying.
If the Center chooses to pursue its plans for
targeted "educational" programs, we hope that
care will be taken to present the issues in an
un-biased light. While it is virtually indisputable
that disarmament and international security are
worthy goals, there is not yet a consensus as to
the strategy which should be used to achieve
them. If the Center chooses to push its own
particular bundle of solutions onto its targeted
audience, we fear that that audience will not be
optimally served. And neither will the Univer
sity.
