## Compelling issues in Hoover controversy 
### 
Hoary cries of "political witch hunt" broadcast from
the heights of Hoover Tower have succeeded in shifting
attention away from the serious issues of academic in
tegrity that provided the impetus for the faculty/student
petition effort to debate the role of the Hoover Institu
tion at Stanford.
Despite efforts by Hoover's full-time public relations
staff to distort this effort through allegations of "reverse
McCarthyism," professors and students involved in the
petition drive calling for an inquiry into the relationship
between Hoover and Stanford never asked or intended
that the inquiry address the political beliefs of Hoover
fellows. An investigation of individuals would indeed
encroach upon academic freedom; however, peti
tioners are not interested in examining political convic
tions of individuals. Frankly, we do not care whether
Seymour Lipset's head count of registered Democrats
and Republicans among Hoover senior fellows is accu
rate.

The guidelines governing Stanford's
control over Hoover are worth
questioning precisely because of
Hoover's potential to be a great asset
to this University, instead of the
possible threat its "unique" status
now poses to Stanford's national
reputation.

No, the compelling issues are structural and academic
in nature. In an interview in the Daily on May 18, Presi
dent Kennedy expressed his hopes that there be "an
improvement in the quality of discussion" and "concen
tration on more substantive issues." We wholeheartedly
share this hope and would like to take another step in
that direction by listing some of the issues which we
continue to believe are worthy of study by a prestigious
committee of academics:
• Hoover research fellows (who constitute two-thirds of
the Hoover fellows who are not Stanford faculty mem
bers) are not subject to the normal academic hiring
process involving faculty search and review committees.
Moreover, they are not subject to the approval or disap
proval of the President or the Stanford board of trustees.
• Hoover is not subject to the Statement on Academic
Freedom, adopted by the faculty senate and binding on
all the University departments, which prohibits political

discrimination in hiring: "Decisions concerning the
search for and the appointment and promotion of fac
ulty . . . shall be made without regard to a person's
political, social or other views not directly related to
academic values or the assumption of academic respon
sibilities."
•The University obviously does not allow donors to
make grants with explicit political strings: one could
not, for instance, establish a "Deregulation" chair in the
Economics Department. Whether donors can more ef
fectively evade this general policy against politically tied
grants by giving to the Hoover Institution than they can
by giving to particular academic departments with a cer
tain political "reputation" is an open question which
must be seriously addressed.
• Particularly if Hoover is receiving large sums because it
is an effective funnel for "tied" grants, long term prob
lems could arise from a growing disparity in financial
resources between the academic departments and
Hoover. This may lead (and may already have led) to a
situation in which the departments consider factors
other than academic merit in making appointments: a
Hoover agreement to pick up some part of an appoin
tee's salary; Hoover assurances that a particular appoin
tee will have adequate research funds in a world in
which funding is often unattainable; covert or overt
Hoover "threats" that a department will not receive its
past share of Hoover dollars unless Hoover fellows re
ceive joint appointments may all lead to serious
pressures on departmental independence.
The guidelines governing Stanford's control over
Hoover are worth questioning precisely because of
Hoover's potential to be a great asset to this University,
instead of the possible threat its "unique" academic
status now poses to Stanford's national reputation.
Hoover's potential as a magnet to lure nationally recog
nized academics of diverse viewpoints to Stanford and
as a temporary refuge for Stanford faculty to engage in
scholarship free from teaching duties appears to be un
tapped. Right now Hoover plays that role to a limited
extent. Some Stanford faculty members currently enjoy
joint or courtesy appointments at Hoover and Hoover
has attracted such luminaries as Milton Friedman, Ed
ward Teller and Sidney Hook. Vet, the price Stanford
pays is that many other research slots are occupied by
policy advocates, many of whom would not have been
hired were they not exempt from the University's
academic hiring process.
We do not claim to have all the facts, because many of
the facts underlying these issues have not been made
available by Hoover. This is precisely the reason for an

inquiry. But one need not be steeped in Hoover history
and the intricacies of its operations to know that serious
issues are at stake. Even a Los Angeles Times editorial
which opposed an investigation conducted "under the
guise of rooting out political bias" at Hoover identified
problems with Hoover which lie close to the heart of our
rationale for an inquiry:
"Hoover is not a department at Stanford; therefore,
much of its research is not subject to the scrutiny that
regular academic departments undergo to preserve
quality and independent inquiry. The ties between
Hoover and Stanford are hazy and unique among
American universities. It is clearly awkward for Stanford
to be so closely associated with Hoover in the public
mind when in many cases it can pass no judgement on
the nature of the research or people doing it."

The 84 faculty members and 1500 students who en
dorsed a formal reconsideration of Hoover's role at
Stanford have from the beginning sought a reasoned
and dispassionate debate. Why then have many of the
Hoover fellows and even some faculty members op
posed an inquiry? And why have a few so misrepre
sented the petitioners' position that they labelled them
"political witch hunters." They appear to have done so
for no other reason than to distract the Stanford com
munity from these more serious and subtle academic
and institutional issues.
It is high time a prestigious committee of academics
takes a closer look at these and other serious issues
which may arise — nor to hunt for "witches," but to
uncover facts and make prudent recommendations
concerning an academically proper and prosperous role
for Hoover at Stanford.

• Hoover research fellows (who constitute two-thirds of
the Hoover fellows who are not Stanford faculty mem
bers) are not subject to the normal academic hiring
process involving faculty search and review committees.
Moreover, they are not subject to the approval or disap
proval of the President or the Stanford board of trustees.
• Hoover is not subject to the Statement on Academic
Freedom, adopted by the faculty senate and binding on
all the University departments, which prohibits political

discrimination in hiring: "Decisions concerning the
search for and the appointment and promotion of fac
ulty . . . shall be made without regard to a person's
political, social or other views not directly related to
academic values or the assumption of academic respon
sibilities."
•The University obviously does not allow donors to
make grants with explicit political strings: one could
not, for instance, establish a "Deregulation" chair in the
Economics Department. Whether donors can more ef
fectively evade this general policy against politically tied
grants by giving to the Hoover Institution than they can
by giving to particular academic departments with a cer
tain political "reputation" is an open question which
must be seriously addressed.
• Particularly if Hoover is receiving large sums because it
is an effective funnel for "tied" grants, long term prob
lems could arise from a growing disparity in financial
resources between the academic departments and
Hoover. This may lead (and may already have led) to a
situation in which the departments consider factors
other than academic merit in making appointments: a
Hoover agreement to pick up some part of an appoin
tee's salary; Hoover assurances that a particular appoin
tee will have adequate research funds in a world in
which funding is often unattainable; covert or overt
Hoover "threats" that a department will not receive its
past share of Hoover dollars unless Hoover fellows re
ceive joint appointments may all lead to serious
pressures on departmental independence.
The guidelines governing Stanford's control over
Hoover are worth questioning precisely because of
Hoover's potential to be a great asset to this University,
instead of the possible threat its "unique" academic
status now poses to Stanford's national reputation.
Hoover's potential as a magnet to lure nationally recog
nized academics of diverse viewpoints to Stanford and
as a temporary refuge for Stanford faculty to engage in
scholarship free from teaching duties appears to be un
tapped. Right now Hoover plays that role to a limited
extent. Some Stanford faculty members currently enjoy
joint or courtesy appointments at Hoover and Hoover
has attracted such luminaries as Milton Friedman, Ed
ward Teller and Sidney Hook. Vet, the price Stanford
pays is that many other research slots are occupied by
policy advocates, many of whom would not have been
hired were they not exempt from the University's
academic hiring process.
We do not claim to have all the facts, because many of
the facts underlying these issues have not been made
available by Hoover. This is precisely the reason for an

inquiry. But one need not be steeped in Hoover history
and the intricacies of its operations to know that serious
issues are at stake. Even a Los Angeles Times editorial
which opposed an investigation conducted "under the
guise of rooting out political bias" at Hoover identified
problems with Hoover which lie close to the heart of our
rationale for an inquiry:
"Hoover is not a department at Stanford; therefore,
much of its research is not subject to the scrutiny that
regular academic departments undergo to preserve
quality and independent inquiry. The ties between
Hoover and Stanford are hazy and unique among
American universities. It is clearly awkward for Stanford
to be so closely associated with Hoover in the public
mind when in many cases it can pass no judgement on
the nature of the research or people doing it."

The 84 faculty members and 1500 students who en
dorsed a formal reconsideration of Hoover's role at
Stanford have from the beginning sought a reasoned
and dispassionate debate. Why then have many of the
Hoover fellows and even some faculty members op
posed an inquiry? And why have a few so misrepre
sented the petitioners' position that they labelled them
"political witch hunters." They appear to have done so
for no other reason than to distract the Stanford com
munity from these more serious and subtle academic
and institutional issues.
It is high time a prestigious committee of academics
takes a closer look at these and other serious issues
which may arise — nor to hunt for "witches," but to
uncover facts and make prudent recommendations
concerning an academically proper and prosperous role
for Hoover at Stanford.

Hoary cries of "political witch hunt" broadcast from
the heights of Hoover Tower have succeeded in shifting
attention away from the serious issues of academic in
tegrity that provided the impetus for the faculty/student
petition effort to debate the role of the Hoover Institu
tion at Stanford.
Despite efforts by Hoover's full-time public relations
staff to distort this effort through allegations of "reverse
McCarthyism," professors and students involved in the
petition drive calling for an inquiry into the relationship
between Hoover and Stanford never asked or intended
that the inquiry address the political beliefs of Hoover
fellows. An investigation of individuals would indeed
encroach upon academic freedom; however, peti
tioners are not interested in examining political convic
tions of individuals. Frankly, we do not care whether
Seymour Lipset's head count of registered Democrats
and Republicans among Hoover senior fellows is accu
rate.

No, the compelling issues are structural and academic
in nature. In an interview in the Daily on May 18, Presi
dent Kennedy expressed his hopes that there be "an
improvement in the quality of discussion" and "concen
tration on more substantive issues." We wholeheartedly
share this hope and would like to take another step in
that direction by listing some of the issues which we
