## Editorial erred on evaluations 
### 
As stated in the Daily ("Teacher evaluations
useful," May 3), the University Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement (C-AAA)
and its subcommittee (Subcommittee on
Evaluation and Improvement of Teaching,
S-CEIT), should be commended for their ef
forts in preparing the recent report on student
evaluation of teaching. The C-AAA recom
mendations touched on many valid points and
lay the groundwork for an improved evalua
tion system. However, certain clarifications
concerning the Daily's editorial are in order.
To begin, we feel the Daily failed to note
clearly enough the distinction between the re
ports of the main committee, C-AAA, and its
subcommittee, the S-CEIT. This is an important
distinction to be made, because the C-AAA
report is an outgrowth of the bulky ,ind com
prehensive S-CEIT report. This initial report
(S-CEIT) was sheared down and revised in the
preparation of the C-AAA report, and in the
revision process, many of the recom
mendations put forth by the S-CEIT were mod
ified greatly. Unfortunately, the Doily erred by
attributing to the C-AAA report many of the
statements that actually appeared in the origi
nal report prepared by the S-CEIT.
Because the S-CEIT report has been encap
sulated and basically superceded by the C-AAA
report and because many of the S-CUT's find
ings regarding the ASSU Course Guide were
based on incorrect assumptions, we believe
[he Daily exhibited irresponsible journalism by
(1) attributing information to the wrong report
and (2) restating information that is unsubstan
tiated: first, the Course Guide is in NO WAY
supported by the University, but is wholly fi
nanced by advertising revenue and fee as
sessments (Publications Board allocation).
Secondly, the Course Guide does do the best
job possible given the constraints within the
current evaluation system.
Few people realize that the current review

process is not mandatory, and that the Course
Guide publishes reviews of all courses for
which evaluation information is received — as
long as it has been taught by the same profes
sor within the past three years.
If a professor chooses not to cooperate with
us, our hands are tied. At this point, we must
be content to increase our usefulness and ver
satility by including new sections in the Guide.
The most important addition is the recent in
clusion of the Course Abstracts. Once again,
however, we are not able to do as much as we
wish because of the constraints of the system.
We agree that the present system is rela
tively inefficient, due to a lack of understand
ing by faculty, students and administrators. A
more effective evaluation form coupled with a
mandatory requirement to use it, rather than
an entirely new system, is the key to resolving
the current problem. Indeed, the University,
in conjunction with the Course Guide, has al
ready been in the process of designing a new
form that will be less overbearing to students
and simplify the convoluted administrative
path the present forms follow. Furthermore,
contrary to what the Daily editorial stated, the
C-AAA report actually states that "the C-AAA
concluded that there should continue to be
close cooperation between the ASSU and the
University for the gathering of information."
It is our hope that the Daily will give more
thought to future editorials. It has a grave re
sponsibility to its readership to provide both
accurate information and incisive analysis. The
inability of the editorial board to distinguish
active from inactive reports and its unwilling
ness to contact informed, involved parties
have done a great disservice to the Stanford
community who turns to the Daily for informa
tion on campus affairs.
