Lowering Caen

IT HAS COME to my attention that at least five Stan
ford students have not yet written vehement letters con
cerning the Hoover controversy. Assuming that you five
are just plain lazy, please clip and mail the following
letter:
Dear President Kennedy / W. Glenn Campbell / Stan
ford Daily (circle one): I think that the Hoover Institution
is: a politically biased, unnecessary drain on Stanford
funds / an unbiased, highly important political think tank
/ a vacuum cleaner factory (circle one); and in light of
this I think that the Hoover Institution should be: nuked
/ gold-plated / reupholstered and recarpeted / sold to the
Arabs (circle one). A disgrace / jewel (circle one) such as
the Hoover Institution must / should not (circle one)
exist at a respectable school such as Stanford / Berkeley /
The University of Texas (circle one). Long live Milton
Friedman / Ted Kennedy / Sears Roebuck and Company
(circle one). • ,
Signed,
(your name)

AN UNNAMED, though highly reliable source leaked info
to me today which reveals that Ceci Hopp and |ohn Elway
are actually prototype college students manufactured by
the Hewlett-Packard Corporation in conjunction with
Casio of Japan. Word has it that the two will be mass
marketed early in 1984 or '85, and they'll be available in
most major department stores across the nation, in different
colors and in different sizes. ... I have nothing to add about
frats ... or about Steve Vineberg (why give him yet MORE
column space).

LES FIRESTEIN'S FIRST PLAN TO MAKE THE WORLD A
BETTER PLACE: Our problem with oil supply is simply
that we haven't been digging deep enough! If we were
to drill straight through the earth's core, say to Saudi
Arabian and Soviet oil reserves, we could secretly suck
up all of THEIR oil right from under their greedy little
OPEC noses — just by pumpi.ig it all out from OUR side
of the globe! (Take a minute to picture this.) THEN, we
could pump all of our sewage and political dissidents out
into Russia and the Middle East by using the very same
drilling holes! Conversely, we could vacuum out
threatening Soviet big-wigs using a super high-powered
vacuum pump (a "Hoover" tower?). And we could also
divide the earth along these SAME oil well perforations
in the event of a nuclear attack — thus creating our own
planet!. . . . MY SECOND PLAN TO MAKE THE WORLD A
BETTER PLACE: Swap Puerto Rico for Israel, and make
Puerto Rico the new Jewish homeland. We could then
join Puerto Rico with Miami via a super-bridge, creating
an ideal Jewish state. Miami could be for Jews over-60,
Puerto Rico for Jews under-60. And the climates of Israel
and Puerto Rico are remarkably similar. Most impor
tantly, there would be no more Middle East conflict.
Significant Jewish monuments could be moved the same
way the London Bridge was moved. With plate tectonics,
nothing ever stays in the same place, anyway (and you
thought that the science requirement was silly!). So take
that, George Shultz.

FORECAST: Pretty soon the econ major is going to be part
of the CORE curriculum here. By about 1990, sophomores
will most likely be asked to "declare a second major, in
addition to economics." Or maybe the ASSU Course Guide
will list average incomes for the graduates in each disci
pline .... And as we see more and more the symbiotic
relationship between wealth and happiness, my guess is that
many of the social science and humanities majors are going
to have to start offering incentives similar to those offered
by the U.S. Armed Forces. Check it out: "Linguistics majors.
The Few. The Proud. The Grammatical. Just give us one
weekend a month while you're in college, and we'll
graduate you with a linguistics master's degree AND we'll
give you $20,000 toward an advanced degree in business.
Visit your local humanities recruiter for details."

SO YOU'RE NERVOUS ABOUT FINALS?Nervous
about grades? Just plain nervous about college? Don't
sweat it. The following people never graduated from
college. Andrew Carnegie, Charles Dickens, Thomas
Edison and Mark Twain (all never completed grade
school). Henry Ford, Hitler, Jack London, William
Saroyan, Tito and the Wright brothers (never completed
high school). And Joseph Chamberlain, Grover Cleve
land, Shakespeare, Joseph Conrad, Hart Crane, Eugene
Debs, Hemingway, Kipling, Lincoln, Mencken, Roc
kefeller, G.B. Shaw, Dylan Thomas, Truman, Washing
ton and Virginia Woolf never attended college. Einstein
and Joyce were also known to perform rather poorly in
school on occasion. So tell THAT to Mom and Dad when
they give you lip about stopping out. (You may also want
to paste this list to the inside of your notebook or wallet
for instant reassurance whenever necessary.)

BORED TO TEARS? Try pasting the following list of philo
sophical questions to the other cover of your notebook. Any
one of these questions should keep you busy for at least fifty
minutes. (1) Contemplate which people presently in your
classroom you would most and least like to be stranded with
on a desert island. Write down your most and least pleasant
fantasies. (2) What percentage of reality is reality? (3) Did
Oswald really shoot Kennedy? (4) Who was "Deep
Throat"? (5) What came first, the egg or the omelette? (6)
Predict, to the nearest minute, the date of the Second Com
ing. Give reasons. (7) Is there a God? And if there is a God,
should he/she be allowed to compete in the '84 Olympics?
(8) What could you possibly buy God for Christmas? (9) If
Snoopy and Garfield went to war, who would fire the first
shot? (10) Who is Mr. Mmo Jo Rrisin and did he, in fact,
mastermind the Faiklands War? (11) If there is a god, then
how come all of the jerks I know fared so well in the housing
draw? (12) If five billion monkeys typed randomly for five
billion years and one of them accidentally typed up Troilus
and Criseyda, would that constitute an infraction of the
Honor Code? (13) Are Razzles™ a candy or a gum? (14)
Finally, if you were buried up to your neck in phlegm and
somebody spit at you, would you duck? Think on those for a
while.

NEXT:I was going to elaborate on how obnoxious and
pretentious it is to wear Stanford T-shirts, etc. especially
around poor and not-so-intelligent people. But I'm run
ning out of column space, so you'll just have to take my
word for it.
* ★ ★
IN SUMMARY AND IN CONCLUSION: This being my last
column before I graduate, please let me indulge and say that
I think that Stanford is an exceptional university, and
thanks, Mom and Dad, for the investment. Good luck, all!
