# Teller wins prestigious award
## 
### JON HORNSBY 
Edward Teller, senior fellow of the
Hoover Institution and member of
the White House Science Council,
was awarded the nation's highest
scientific honor Tuesday by Presi
dent Reagan.
Though unrelated, the selection
roughly coincided with a White
House announcement last week that
no conflict of interest was found in
Teller's holding stock in a laser
technology corporation while serv
ing as a White House science ad
visor.
Teller said he was pleased to re
ceive the National Medal of Science
but is not as happy with the lack of
attention given the results of the
White House investigations.
"The remarkable thing is that
when it's improper, it's front page
news," Teller said, referring to the
April 28 New York Times article
which prompted the investigation.

"and when it's proper, you can't find
it in the paper."
A spokesman for the White House
office that administers the science
award said it is unfortunate that the

two events occured so close to
gether. "There is no correlation be
tween the issues," said James Ling, a
senior policy analyst for the Office of
Science and Technology. Ling also
said that although some may wonder
why the renowned physicist didn't
receive this award long ago for help
ing to develop the hydrogen bomb,
the honor traditionally recognizes
life-time achievement, rather than
honoring a single accomplishment,
as does the Nobel Prize which Teller
has also won.
Teller was one of 12 scientists hon
ored. At a brief ceremony in the East
Room of the White House, Reagan
gave him a handshake and "an extra
pat on the back," Ling said.
The citation acknowledges Teller
"for his outstanding contributions to
molecular physics, understanding
the origin of stellar energy, the
theory and application of fusion

reactions, the field of nuclear safety,
and for his continued leadership in
science and technology."
Teller is the 12th scientist as
sociated with the University to win
the award. Other recent Stanford
winners were biochemist Arthur
Kornberg, and computer scientist
Donald Knuth. Both won in 1980.
"The enjoyable thing about such a
distinction," Teller said, "is the
company of others receiving the
awards, and the ones who have pre
viously received it." Teller has won
more than nine prestigious awards
and holds several honorary degrees.
He held positions at numerous uni
versities and federal laboratories be
fore coming to Hoover in 1975.
He was named to the White House
Science Council in 1974.
Teller pointed out last week that it
was under the Carter administration
that he bought, not received, 40,000
shares of stock in the Irvine-based
Helionetics Inc., a laser research

company. The New York Times re
port of these stock holdings last
month prompted an investigation,
headed by White House counsel
Fred Fielding, to determine any con
nection between Teller's conversa
tions with Reagan and the substantial
run-up of Helionetics' stock prices
shortly before Reagan's March 23
speech suggesting a space-based,
missile-defense system that would
use laser technology.
Teller, who has discussed space
based lasers with the president veh
emently denied that anything he said
or did caused the stock to rise. Presi
dential spokesman Anson Franklin
said the review by Fielding's office
turned up "no legal problems," and
"no improper action" on Teller's
part.
Franklin also said the physicist had
disclosed his holdings to the science
council as called for by White House
procedures, even though, as an out
side advisor, Teller isn't governed by
the same disclosure regulations that
apply to full-time appointees.
Teller said there will be an ad in the
May 31st Wall Street Journal in which
he will comment fully on the affair.
