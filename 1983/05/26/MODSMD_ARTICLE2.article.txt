# Teller wins prestigious award
## 
### JON HORNSBY 
Edward Teller, senior fellow of the
Hoover Institution and member of
the White House Science Council,
was awarded the nation's highest
scientific honor Tuesday by Presi
dent Reagan.
Though unrelated, the selection
roughly coincided with a White
House announcement last week that
no conflict of interest was found in
Teller's holding stock in a laser
technology corporation while serv
ing as a White House science ad
visor.
Teller said he was pleased to re
ceive the National Medal of Science
but is not as happy with the lack of
attention given the results of the
White House investigations.
"The remarkable thing is that
when it's improper, it's front page
news," Teller said, referring to the
April 28 New York Times article
which prompted the investigation.

"and when it's proper, you can't find
it in the paper."
A spokesman for the White House
office that administers the science
award said it is unfortunate that the

two events occured so close to
gether. "There is no correlation be
tween the issues," said James Ling, a
senior policy analyst for the Office of
Science and Technology. Ling also
said that although some may wonder
why the renowned physicist didn't
receive this award long ago for help
ing to develop the hydrogen bomb,
the honor traditionally recognizes
life-time achievement, rather than
honoring a single accomplishment,
as does the Nobel Prize which Teller
has also won.
Teller was one of 12 scientists hon
ored. At a brief ceremony in the East
Room of the White House, Reagan
gave him a handshake and "an extra
pat on the back," Ling said.
The citation acknowledges Teller
"for his outstanding contributions to
molecular physics, understanding
the origin of stellar energy, the
theory and application of fusion
