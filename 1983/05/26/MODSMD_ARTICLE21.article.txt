Food service at Wilbur held a Hawaiian
feast for students last night. Dinner was
held outside to take advantage of the great
weather. The dinner luau was one of many

special meals that food service arranges
throughout the year. Other dorms around
campus were similarly treated to roast
pork, fresh fruit and tropical punch.
