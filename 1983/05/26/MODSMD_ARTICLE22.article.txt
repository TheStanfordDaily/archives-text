Dan Aykroyd plays Clifford Skridlow, a
nerd who makes four prostitutes and two
pimps his best friends because they get
him drunk, stoned and laid. As Aykroyd
puts it,"the best time of my life!" Some
life. Some movie.
Skridlow becomes Dr. Detroit in his off
hours to scare away the fat Mom, head
pimpette in Chicago He runs out one
gangster in order to make it easier for the
other pimps and pushers in Chicago, his

good friends, to operate.
A silly subplot underlies it all; Skridlow
must also save his University from bank
ruptcy, and must do so by pleasingaristoc
ratic snobs who would not approve of the
Doctor. Of course, in the end, they all
clash and everyone has a party.
Doctor Detroit is practically a remake of
lerry Lewis' 1963 comedy, The Nutty Pro
fessor. Even the character names (Julius
kelp to Buddy Love, Clifford Skridlow to
Doctor Detroit) reveal similarities, lerry
Lewis was funny and original in his ver
sion. Here, Aykroyd comes off as self
indulgent. While Lewis' )eckyll/Hyde
metamorphosis was distinct and entertain
ing, Aykroyd changes only from a timid
buffoon to a noisy buffoon.
The film makes two false assumptions;
first that Dan Aykroyd can till a theater no
matter how absurd he acts, and second
that the average American is an idiot. The
advertising campaign reveals the first con
cept; all promotions state that Dan Ayk
royd is Doctor Detroit. They are selling the
star, not the picture, and for good reason;
Aykroyd is usually better than this. But
even a large sponge thrown in a pig sty
can't absorb all of the muck.
The second assumption — that America
is full of idiots — is displayed by the
moronic humor which the film spatters
about. Some of the big laughs in Doctor
Detroit: Gag 1, ludge sentences black de
fendant to prison for traffic violation. Gag
1a ( Judge is southerner. Gag 2, Dr. Detroit
walks as if having an enema. Gag 2a, He
runs. Gag 3, Caterers serve Kentucky Fried
Chicken. Gag 3a, Guests enjoy it. Doctor
Detroit could use a laugh track, since noth

ing else would.
Ihe film is certain to offend everyone
who sees it. When Richard Pryor tells
ethnic jokes, he is hysterical, when How
ard Hesseman tells his black Chauffeur
Diavalo, "My granddad owned your
granddad," he isn't funny, he is simply
racist. Additionally, fat women are not in
herently tunny. The film, however, tries to
make us laugh at Mom simply because of
her weight problem. Like the entire film,
however, Mom is just pathetic, not funny.
The most enjoyable sequence in the film
is billed as the "Doctor Detroit Dance"
performed by Aykroyd and the under
world. It isn't much, but at least it keeps
the viewer awake. It is a bit reminiscent of
the good-old Blues Brothers dance num
bers, but the rest of the film forgets that
recently Aykroyd has become an only
child.
The highpoint of Aykroyd's speaking
performance takes place when his prosti
tute friends take him on his Mr. Toad's
wild ride through Chicago. Aykroyd plays
a good drunk, accelerating his stupor ac
cording to his alcohol consumption. This
is the only time in the film that we like
Scridlow, as here he is believably pathetic.
Unfortunately, when he sobers up the
next morning he is never the same again,
he is suddenly unbelievably pathetic.
As in Neighbors, what Aykroyd does in
the film suggests great talent, but the
script doesn't bring it out. In short, Doctor
Detroit makes little sense, and when it
does, we wish it didn't. Not even the
greatest admirers of Aykroyd will find this
film funny.

The most enjoyable sequence in the film
is billed as the "Doctor Detroit Dance"
performed by Aykroyd and the under
world. It isn't much, but at least it keeps
the viewer awake. It is a bit reminiscent of
the good-old Blues Brothers dance num
bers, but the rest of the film forgets that
recently Aykroyd has become an only
child.
The highpoint of Aykroyd's speaking
performance takes place when his prosti
tute friends take him on his Mr. Toad's
wild ride through Chicago. Aykroyd plays
a good drunk, accelerating his stupor ac
cording to his alcohol consumption. This
is the only time in the film that we like
Scridlow, as here he is believably pathetic.
Unfortunately, when he sobers up the
next morning he is never the same again,
he is suddenly unbelievably pathetic.
As in Neighbors, what Aykroyd does in
the film suggests great talent, but the
script doesn't bring it out. In short, Doctor
Detroit makes little sense, and when it
does, we wish it didn't. Not even the
greatest admirers of Aykroyd will find this
film funny.
