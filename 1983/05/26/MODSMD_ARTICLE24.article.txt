# Privilege or responsibility?: 'Star Wars III' preview
## 
### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
Rank has its privileges, they say, and I came
o the brink of believing that last week when
he mail brought an invitation to a special ad
/ance screening of Star Wars: Return of the
edi. Being the senior entertainment editor
— and the person who happened to be
opening the mail at the moment — it was up
o me to go see this movie at its exclusive San
Francisco premier.
It's dirty work, but someone has to do it.
"You and a guest are cordially invited to
attend... Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,' an
nounces the cover of said press pass, and the
inside states that it is "Absolutely Not Trans
ferable." Perhaps it would be fitting to subti
tle this article 'Fall from Innocence,' for, de
spite the best the Coronet theatre and
George Lucas had to offer, there was to be
many a dream shattered that evening.
The most unfitting part of going to a Pre
mier (as in Hollywood Premier) is the fact
that you actually have to get there first. I've
seen most of the great U.S. cities, and I in
clude San Francisco amongst them, but even
The City in all its beauty cannot boast of a
class of bus travellers higher on the evolu
tionary scale than sea urchins or garden
slugs.
The Coronet, on Geary, happens to be sit
uated as comparatively distant from convie
nient mass transit (read as BART) as Newark
Airport is from Ice Station Zebra. Along with
the winner of a drawing for the other half of
the press pass conducted amongst an inner
circle of my close friends, I boarded the pre
ternaturally rickety Geary bus, my pride and
resistance diminished by the rolling hills of
The City and the rocketing prices of TheTax
icabs.
After an anthropological experience such
as would put Margaret Mead to shame, we
arrived in the vicinity of the Coronet. Much
to our amusement, we found that the theatre
was being picketed, and to enter we would
have to cross the picket line.
My companion, being of a strongly leftist
bent, was caught in a moral dilemma: soli
darity with the striking janitors of local nine,
or crossing the line to see the final chapter of
the Star Wars series.
Once inside a team of ushers worked at
stripping the incoming of their passes and
presenting them with huge production
notes folders, containing upwards of 300

separate entries, including the Assistant
Articulation engineer and the Latex Foam
lab supervisor as well as 18 Creature Cos
turners and 66 Ewoks. Obviously they in
tended to benefit from well informed
criticism.
Upon entering the interior of the theater
— and cleverly spoiling a photograph of two
individuals in Yoda masks by careful obstruc
tion of camera — I was treated to what must
be one of the few 'grand style' theatres left in
the U.S. The Coronet is huge for a place that
just shows movies, triple tiered and lushly
decorated. Perhaps Lucasfilms purposely
showed the film in such a nostalgic setting,
trying to bring out the old serial atmosphere.
Once seats were claimed— by 30 minutes
before the show most of the best seats were
taken — I set off in search of news. The truly
best seats, oddly enough, were empty, a row
along the start of the second tier guarded by
suitably stern looking ushers. Obviously, this
was where the news was being made.
Using an old reporter's trick for gathering
information, I went up to the less stern usher
and asked, him who the seats were being
saved for. Perhaps soon Lucas, Hamill, Fisher
and Ford would come trooping up- an in
terviewer's dream!
Using an old usher's trick for discouraging
reporters, he told me that the seats were
being saved for the manager of the theatre
and his friends. (Can you say letdown ?) I lat
er round out — through the time-honored
device of asking a popcorn seller — that they
had had an earlier screening, some three
weeks ago, for the people who had worked
to make the movie. Lucas and his Marin
mafia had all been there, along with Francis
Ford Coppola. Did they invite The Stanford
Daily? Nol They'll rue that.
Having thus had my illusions of celebrity
presence shattered, I turned to the lobby for
another rude awakening. It was an unusual
experience to have possession of such a hot
ticket as to this show. I had to compare the
benefit of the experience to the huge finan
cial windfall scalping such ducats would
have brought me. In the end it was the snob
appeal as much as devotion to duty that
brought me around. Here was an 'Absolutely
not transferable' ticket to a special screening
in San Francisco. How could I resist the
chance to hobnob with the VIPs?
As it turned out, after watching the doors

for some fifteen minutes, that the crowd that
turned up was less composed of the VIP than
the Very Well Connected. It was an odd
crowd that showed up for the show— defi
nitely less odd than that which would show
up for the regular showings, but odd none
theless — consisting of a cultural group no
more consistant than Chex party mix.
I was glad to see that there were very few
Star Wars groupies, aside from the pair
whose photo session I had blithely trooped
through. There was a sizeable amount of San
Francisco city people, dressed for a night on
the town and looking as vacantly stylish as
only young people out on the town can.
Aside from that group, the rest of the crowd
was heavily salted with children, presumably
because the True VIPs (or TVIPs) to whom
the passes were given passed them on to
their offspring in exchange for eating their
vegtables or some other hideous parental
bribery. 'Absolutely not transferable' in
deed!
There was one other 'type' in the crowd,
whose presence I cannot explain. The flow
of people entering the theatre (which had
been steady since the doors opened, I
should add) would every now and then be
spotted with weird groups of farmers and
hunter-gatherer types. Just how they got in
and just why they always seemed to enter in
groups of threes remains a mystery. Perhaps
they had made very attractive offers of sticks
and bits of moss to ticketholders and thus
gotten passes, but this I doubt. Surely they
would have had to throw in so many shiny,
flat rocks as to have made the deal pro
hibitively expensive.
Those of us on the inside may have lost
some of our overweening pride in such com
pany, but it was quite a boost to look through
the doors and see the furtive glances of the
not especially VIP (or NEVIP) strolling by the
theatre. Between the huge crowd gathered
in the theatre to see a movie that wouldn't
open for two days and the striking mob out
side (now cheerfully fraternizing with the
beat policeman, who stood grinning ear to
ear) we must have presented quite a picture
to the casual passerby.
A slightly pathetic note was added by the
individuals who stood outside of the theatre,
forlornly waiting for their friends with the
tickets to come by. Past them swept the con
tinual tide of entrants, many of whom

sheepishly trashed the union literature given
to them by the strikers, as if they were afraid
that the theatre management would con
sider them ungrateful and barthem from en
try. Myself being a forthright news
paperman, I kept the union manifesto, al
though circumstances forced me to wad it
up and thrust it deep into my jacket pocket.
The start of the movie was drawing near, so
I had to drop my pastime of staring vacantly
into the street and the gibbering mob in the
foyer to get some popcorn and run helter
skelter to my seat. On the line for popcorn —
which, against all rules of hospitality to
critics, they make you pay for — I had the
bright idea of just finding out exactly how
some of these people here got in.
In my best timorous, uncertain voice, I
quavered at the lad in front of me "Excuse
me, but who did you know to get these
tickets?"
He turned in my direction, the glare of his
braced teeth momentarily blinding me. "It
was a promotional deal."
"A what?" I replied dumbly. The idea that
this low-teen individual could command
some resource worthy of the Coronet or
Lucasfilms making a deal with him baffled
me.
"Yeah," he said, "a promotional deal. A
company deal. You know,"he added help
fully, "a company deal." It was all much
clearer. His father had given him the tickets,
sent to his office at MultiNatCo. I turned be
hind me, trying to get a representative sam
ple.
The rather striking young woman behind
me looked at me with the sort of bemused
tolerance usually reserved for the severely,
untreatably insane. After the usual pre
liminaries of verbally presenting my creden
tials so as not to come across as that most
heinous of perverts (those who come up to
people and ask them odd questions for no
reason at all, a mistaken identification that
happens to me quite often for some reason)
she told me that she was Patty Haze, an im
portant person at the radio station KUSF and
host of the program San Francisco Scene,
and who actually knew someone, I theorize
Annie Arbogast, involved in making the
movie to boot.
Having found the nearest thing to a coun
terpart in the college press scene that I have
ever run across, I immediately latched unto

her with the sort of cool reserve normally as
sociated with lampreys and other parasites.
However, she did me the disfavor of con
firming what I had already suspected, deep
in my heart: there was nothing really special
about this screening.
Sometimes they do go out of their way she
told me. "When they screened Where the
Buffalo Roam, all the ushers were dressed
like Bill Murray. .. Twentieth Century Fox is
usually pretty good at putting on a preview."
With my finely honed grasp of the obvious I
reminded her that this Star Wars thing was a
Twentieth Century Fox production. "Well,"
she concluded, "there are a lot of really
creative people working on promoting these
things, but they just aren't given enough
freedom."
On that note my turn at the popcorn coun
ter arrived. I requested a middlin' sized
bucket o' popcorn, and prepared to cut and
run. Little did I suspect there was a trap wait
ing. "Would you like the butter flavoring on
that, sir?" asked the attendant.
I panicked, as I usually do when someone
asks me an unusually piercing question out
of the blue. "Yeah, I guess so," I stammered.
Alarm bells went off in my head. 'The butter
flavoring'? Good Lord, what have I gotten
myself into?
"Heh, heh, as you wish, sir." The attendant
turned to the butter flavoring dispenser. It
had, oddly enough, run dry at that very mo
ment Nevertheless, the attendant kept
pumping away at the fountainhead, for what
seemed to my tortured senses a full half
hour, while the people in the line called for
my blood. Even the beauteous KUSF radio
hand, moments before an ally, had turned
on me.
"I can get that somewhere else," I said,
weakly, as visions of myself running through
the streets clutching a bucket of popcorn
hopelessly searching for a supply of 'butter
flavoring' filled my head. I snatched the
bucket back, and instead fled to my seat.
After I arrived it was a short wait until the
picture started. Quite a picture it was too.
Unfortunately I can't do it justice in the
space I have left here, so I'll tell you that the
dialogue does get a little stilted, the scene in
the forest is incredible, and virtually all the
loose ends are tied up. Two pieces of advice:
1- Go see the movie, if only to say you have,
and 2Do not mess with the Emperor.
'Butter flavoring' itself should be warning
enough.
