He's really here
For the treat of a lifetime, all Daily
staffers are invited to meet Herb
Caen at 5 p.m. today. Karen even
went to the store yesterday to buy
some special goodies to delight your
taste buds.
Anchors away?
Some groups have their parties on
yachts, but at the Daily we don't do
that kind of thing. We start our par
ties at the Daily office and move on to
a Chinese restaurant. If you forgot to
sign up for the banquet, you're lucky
because there's still time. Come to
the office to sign up for a party you'll
never forget — that is if you re
member it.
Get shirted
The Daily t-shirts are in and they
look super! Bev's worried that
they're too wintry, but Karen's

psyched about putting trim on the
bottom of hers and having a new
dress. Just think, Ms. Springen will
be the first owner of a Mark Wilson
designer dress. Stop by the office to
pick up your shirt — but don't forget
your checkbook. Jan says, "No
money, no t-shirt."
Dead Week
The last Daily of the quarter will
come out one week from today, but
we promise it will liven up your Dead
Week. Page editors, please note that
paste-up is on both Tuesday and
Wednesday nights. You know when
your deadlines are; please meet
them to make Karen's last week a
happy one. Gold stars for everyone!
Where?
All people working on fall volume
need to give Kristen their summer
address so she can write them exten
sive letters. Please drop off your ad
dress in her box.
