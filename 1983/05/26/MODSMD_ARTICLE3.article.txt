# University plans centennial

The University is already gearing up for its Centennial
celebration — an extravaganza that staff members hope
will raise more than $300 million — but setting the date
presents problems.
One task facing the planners is picking an exact date
for the celebration: the University was founded in 1885,
its cornerstone was laid in 1887 and its first class entered
in 1891.
All of these various milestones in University history
could potentially be celebrated — which means the Cen
tennial planners must decide which dates should be
emphasized.
"Should the Centennial of the founding be observed,
and if so, how could this be related to the centennial in
1991?" asked Emeritus Prof. Donald Winbigler, a
member of one of the committees investigating the vari
ous centennial alternatives.
Two committees have already studied the different
ceremonial and fundraising options for the University's
100 th birthday.
The University president, vice-president for public af-

fairs and vice-president for development, will review the
different alternatives recommended by the committees
and make specific decisions later this year.
One important aspect of the Centennial celebration
now being planned is its fundraising campaign.
Michael Oman, chairman of the Development Office
Task Force on Centennial Fundraising, said the Univer
sity has not decided exactly what fundraising strategy to
pursue.
But he said the total effort would raise considerably
more than the $300 million raised during the last major
fundraising campaign, which ended in 1977.
Members of the committee concerned with the actual
ceremonies declined to discuss the specific activities
that might be included in the celebration.
However, Winbigler said the ceremonies could be
similar to those of the University's 50th anniversary in
1941.
Stanford marked its 50th birthday with about a week of
activities, according to Ray Wilbur, president of the
Stanford Historical Society and son of former Stanford
President Ray Lyman Wilbur. These events included
symposiums, speakers and a dinner dance, Wilbur said
