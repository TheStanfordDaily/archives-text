# Investigation reveals no impropriety
## Mosher claims damaging leaks 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
As many as six faculty members
may have granted "secret inter
views" regarding the expulsion of
former anthropology Ph.D. candi
date Steven Mosher to New York
Times and other news outlets, ac
cording to a letter received by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
yesterday.
Mosher, who sent the letter from
Taiwan a week ago, claimed the al
leged leaks shattered whatever re
maining atmosphere of fairness
might have shielded his case, which
has been subject to nation-wide pub
licity since its beginning.
"It (the alleged leaks) were se
verely prejudicial to the appeal that I
filed with the University administra
tion last month, making it highly un
likely that that appeal will receive a
fair hearing," the open corre
spondence said. Mosher did not cite
specific articles or editions of the
Times and was unavailable for com
ment.
Kennedy had no substantive reac
tion, saying, "I am in the appeals
chain so I do have to maintain a cer
tain objectivity about it."
The former graduate student —
who was dismissed Feb. 24 for "il
legal and unethical conduct" while
doing field research in the People's
Republic of China by a unanimous
vote of a departmental committee —
filed an appeal of that decision last
month with Norm Wessells, dean of
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences.

This appeal has continued an
academic and journalistic debate
which has centered on the case —
with Mosher contending that the
University bowed to pressure from
China as a result of an article on abor
tion that he published in Taiwan and
the administration responding that
Mosher's conduct was reprehensi
ble.
The exact reasons for Mosher's
dismissal have never been released.
But according to Mosher's letter this
"stonewall(ing)" of the press has
been broken.
"Stung by the growing wave of
criticism that their decision has gen
erated, as many as half-a-dozen fac
ulty members decided to grant secret
interviews to reporters from The
New York Times ... the letter
stated. "In short, while publicly
claiming that release of the report
would 'harm innocent persons,' they
secretly peddle its content to the
press."
Mosher also attacked the Univer
sity for its lack of action on his case,
and asked that action be taken to
grant him a Ph.D. and financially
compensate him for the trouble he
has suffered due to the case.
Wessells appointed a three
member faculty committee last week
to review the case and present a rec
ommendation to him by the end of
June. The Office of the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences sent a letter
informing Mosher of this action as
soon as the committee was created.

This committee is the primary body
which might be affected by the bias
described by Mosher.
"I don't think there is anything that
will happen that would bias those of
us reviewing the case," said Prof.
Emeritus Ernest Hilgard, one of the
members of the reviewing commit
tee. "There are all sorts of charges
and counter-charges which are al
ready available . . . It's not our job to
react to any kind of emotionalized
statements."
In response to the accusation that
various professors were "granting
'secret' interviews," Anthropology
112 Dept. Chairman Clifford Barnett
said, "I don't know what he means by
■ 'secret,' but on the whole I have
t been the major spokesman for the
» department . . . and to my knowl
r edge, nothing has been leaked of the
/ major part of the report that he, and
t (those) on the committee, both
agreed might hurt innocent people."
- Faculty members contacted voiced
skepticism that anyone would grant
"secret" interviews, saying the
' pledge to confidentiality was still in
3 effect.
y
e "I would be really quite surprised
if anybody leaked anything substan
tial," said a source on the An
k thropology Department committee.
;- "We're trying to protect Steve and
)f we're trying to protect the people
>112 that would be hurt if it were made
;r public. We're not the kind of people
is who go around shanghaiing
J. people."
