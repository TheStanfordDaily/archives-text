The HECC was started in 1977 "to
implement energy saving programs
in student residences," and is a
non-profit organization funded by
the University, according to Richard
Hefter, student staff member of the
group. Comprised of five student
staff members and two half-time
"heads," the HECC is described by
Hefter as "the group that monitors
energy use in the residences."
In order to increase awareness of
energy conservation, the HECC of
fered 18 residences, including
fraternities, dorms and houses, a
chance to earn a cash reward for re
ducing their energy use during
March, April and May compared to
the previous year. Hefter said, "We
just chose them (the residences) to
get a good sampling of dorms and
fraternities." Also, he said that some
of the choices were made because
they are "metered similarly," citing
the Moore houses(ssB Mayfield,
Casa Italiana and American Studies)
as an example.
Most important, Hefter said, 13 of

the 18 residences reduced their en
ergy use during the project period.
"That's a much better figure than in
the non-contest houses," he added.
Casa Italians led the contest, de
creasing its energy use by 26.84 per

cent. The total combined reduction
for all participants was 25,000 KW
hours, according to Alan Comnes,
student staff member of the HECC.
To illustrate the magnitude of these


ENERGY INCENTIVE PROGRAM RESULTS: A pilot program offering
cash awards for energy conservation had good results. Most of the 18
participating residences showed a substantial decline in electricity con
sumption. The program, run by the Housing Energy Conservation Center,
may eventually be instituted throughout the University.
savings, Comnes said this is enough
to fuel nine mid-size cars from Stan
ford to New York and back.
Statistics show that of the resi
dences monitored, the houses did
best, especially the fraternities. Of
the eight fraternities in the project,
five used less energy than they did
last year. Most notably, Alpha Delta
Phi decreased its usage by 12.58 per
cent.
Because the contest was part of a
pilot program, further evaluation is
needed before it is implemented in
all the residences, according to Hef
ter. When asked when such evalua
tion will be completed, he said, "I
think that'll be a while."
Other projects of the HECC in
clude the sponsoring of "Sun Day,"
aimed at increasing awareness of
possible uses of solar energy, and
the "energy rep." program in the re
sidences. Hefter said, "We work with
energy reps, in dorms to help give
out information on conservation."
