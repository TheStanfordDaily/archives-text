# Energy center to award dorms

The Housing Energy Conservation
Center will reward the residents of
Terra, 558 Mayfield, Alpha Delta Phi,
ATO, Casa Italiana and Sigma Alpha

earlier this year.
The HECC was started in 1977 "to
implement energy saving programs
in student residences," and is a
non-profit organization funded by
the University, according to Richard
Hefter, student staff member of the
group. Comprised of five student
staff members and two half-time
"heads," the HECC is described by
Hefter as "the group that monitors
energy use in the residences."
In order to increase awareness of
energy conservation, the HECC of
fered 18 residences, including
fraternities, dorms and houses, a
chance to earn a cash reward for re
ducing their energy use during
March, April and May compared to
the previous year. Hefter said, "We
just chose them (the residences) to
get a good sampling of dorms and
fraternities." Also, he said that some
of the choices were made because
they are "metered similarly," citing
the Moore houses(ssB Mayfield,
Casa Italiana and American Studies)
as an example.
Most important, Hefter said, 13 of

the 18 residences reduced their en
ergy use during the project period.
"That's a much better figure than in
the non-contest houses," he added.
Casa Italians led the contest, de
creasing its energy use by 26.84 per

cent. The total combined reduction
for all participants was 25,000 KW
hours, according to Alan Comnes,
student staff member of the HECC.
To illustrate the magnitude of these


ENERGY INCENTIVE PROGRAM RESULTS: A pilot program offering
cash awards for energy conservation had good results. Most of the 18
participating residences showed a substantial decline in electricity con
sumption. The program, run by the Housing Energy Conservation Center,
may eventually be instituted throughout the University.
