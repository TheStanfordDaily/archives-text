# Report of possible planet intrigues scientific community
## 
### DAN NEWELL 
A report submitted by Astronomy Prof.
Douglas Lin at UC-Santa Cruz for the July
issue of Astrophysical lournal Letters has
touched off excitement and debate within
the astronomy community by proposing that
an object located in the constellation of
Taurus may be a planet in the process of
formation. If Lin is correct, this would be the
first known observation of a planetary sys
tem other than the solar system.
Arthur Walker, professor of applied
physics here, said this was an "unexpected
discovery" and that "people who are look
ing for planets wouldn't necessarily be look
ing at an object that far away."
According to Lin, the discovery was
"serendipity" and "quite by accident. He
added, "It was not as if we went out looking
for a planet."

Electrical Engineering Prof. Von Eshleman
said, "We have no direct evidence of any
planets outside our solar system." "If you
had a true example of planetary formation,"
he said, and "if the data were uncontested, it
would be the first planetary example (out
side our solar system) and that would be a
profound concept." It would tend to show
that planet formation was a common oc
currence and that thus amongst the billions
of stars there might also be billions of
planets.
If the body were indeed an unformed
planet, Lin said the implications would be
enormous.
"Basically, I think that the current model
of how our solar system was formed is that
planets were formed at the same time as the
sun, from a large nebula or gas cloud. So an
observation of the simultaneous formation

of a large planet and a star would tend to
confirm this theory, and such a theory would
imply that many stars have planetary sys
tems."
Lin continued that he and others tried to
piece together observations made in radio
wavelengths at several observatories includ
ing the Very Large Array Radio Observatory
in New Mexico and the University of
Hawaii's Mauna Kea observatory.
"What these observations are telling us is
the following. We're talking about a very
young star which we've known about for
some time. This particular star is known as a
T-Tauri star because it's in the constellation
of Taurus. What's interesting about T-Tauri
is that it's the first star known to be a very
young star in the sense that it's possibly
around a couple million years old. It's in the
neighborhood of lots of cold clouds of

molecules which can be the environment in
which stars form."
Lin noted, "What's surprising is that in the
last couple years, when radio astronomers at
NASA Ames (Research Center) went out to
look at this particular star, they found that it
was not quite in the same location as the
optical component. So people at NASA
Ames and us tried to look at it and see what it
looked like.
"What we intended to set out to do was to
resolve any discrepancy and see whether
either observer made any mistakes. What we
came up with seemed to be two sources.
One, as seen through an optical telescope,
turns out to be the central star T-Tauri itself
and the other, near it, at about 80 astronauti
cal units (each unit being the distance of the
earth to the sun), transmits primarily in in
frared and radio wavelengths.

"What we then tried to do," Lin said, "was
piece together a theory that would help
interpret this observation and data."
Current estimates of the body's mass indi
cate that it has between 10 to 30 times the
mass of lupiter. According to Lin, "An object
would have to be about 100 times the mass of
lupiter to be a star. An object of less mas
siveness wouldn't carry enough mass to sus
tain nuclear reaction." Therefore, "... you
would expect that this thing will evolve into a
protoplanet rather than a star. That's what
led us to this interpretation."
While the discovery of a new planet would
indeed have far-reaching implications, the
general consensus at present seems to be
that Lin's theory is no more than a "working
hypothesis" which only time and further ob
servations can bear out. Even Lin admits that
he purposely went "out on a limb" in
the hopes of spawning more interest
in it.
Walker said, "It would certainly be
very interesting if it turns out to be
correct . . . It's an interesting obser
vation that it might turn out to be a
planet and I think that's a reasonable
way to put it."
According to Sidney Wolff, as
sociate director of the University of
Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy, "It
could still evolve into a bona fide
star." The result would be a double
or binary star system which accord
ing to Eshleman would be nothing
new. "They (double star systems) are
quite common; more common than
single star systems."
Lin invited other astronomers to
test his hypothesis. "The question
will probably be settled in time by
further observations. It's too early to
say," he said.

around a couple million years old. It's in the
neighborhood of lots of cold clouds of

molecules which can be the environment in
which stars form."
Lin noted, "What's surprising is that in the
last couple years, when radio astronomers at
NASA Ames (Research Center) went out to
look at this particular star, they found that it
was not quite in the same location as the
optical component. So people at NASA
Ames and us tried to look at it and see what it
looked like.
"What we intended to set out to do was to
resolve any discrepancy and see whether
either observer made any mistakes. What we
came up with seemed to be two sources.
One, as seen through an optical telescope,
turns out to be the central star T-Tauri itself
and the other, near it, at about 80 astronauti
cal units (each unit being the distance of the
earth to the sun), transmits primarily in in
frared and radio wavelengths.

"What we then tried to do," Lin said, "was
piece together a theory that would help
interpret this observation and data."
Current estimates of the body's mass indi
cate that it has between 10 to 30 times the
mass of lupiter. According to Lin, "An object
would have to be about 100 times the mass of
lupiter to be a star. An object of less mas
siveness wouldn't carry enough mass to sus
tain nuclear reaction." Therefore, "... you
would expect that this thing will evolve into a
protoplanet rather than a star. That's what
led us to this interpretation."
While the discovery of a new planet would
indeed have far-reaching implications, the
general consensus at present seems to be
that Lin's theory is no more than a "working
hypothesis" which only time and further ob
servations can bear out. Even Lin admits that
he purposely went "out on a limb" in
the hopes of spawning more interest
in it.
Walker said, "It would certainly be
very interesting if it turns out to be
correct . . . It's an interesting obser
vation that it might turn out to be a
planet and I think that's a reasonable
way to put it."
According to Sidney Wolff, as
sociate director of the University of
Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy, "It
could still evolve into a bona fide
star." The result would be a double
or binary star system which accord
ing to Eshleman would be nothing
new. "They (double star systems) are
quite common; more common than
single star systems."
Lin invited other astronomers to
test his hypothesis. "The question
will probably be settled in time by
further observations. It's too early to
say," he said.
A report submitted by Astronomy Prof.
Douglas Lin at UC-Santa Cruz for the July
issue of Astrophysical lournal Letters has
touched off excitement and debate within
the astronomy community by proposing that
an object located in the constellation of
Taurus may be a planet in the process of
formation. If Lin is correct, this would be the
first known observation of a planetary sys
tem other than the solar system.
Arthur Walker, professor of applied
physics here, said this was an "unexpected
discovery" and that "people who are look
ing for planets wouldn't necessarily be look
ing at an object that far away."
According to Lin, the discovery was
"serendipity" and "quite by accident. He
added, "It was not as if we went out looking
for a planet."

Electrical Engineering Prof. Von Eshleman
said, "We have no direct evidence of any
planets outside our solar system." "If you
had a true example of planetary formation,"
he said, and "if the data were uncontested, it
would be the first planetary example (out
side our solar system) and that would be a
profound concept." It would tend to show
that planet formation was a common oc
currence and that thus amongst the billions
of stars there might also be billions of
planets.
If the body were indeed an unformed
planet, Lin said the implications would be
enormous.
"Basically, I think that the current model
of how our solar system was formed is that
planets were formed at the same time as the
sun, from a large nebula or gas cloud. So an
observation of the simultaneous formation

of a large planet and a star would tend to
confirm this theory, and such a theory would
imply that many stars have planetary sys
tems."
Lin continued that he and others tried to
piece together observations made in radio
wavelengths at several observatories includ
ing the Very Large Array Radio Observatory
in New Mexico and the University of
Hawaii's Mauna Kea observatory.
"What these observations are telling us is
the following. We're talking about a very
young star which we've known about for
some time. This particular star is known as a
T-Tauri star because it's in the constellation
of Taurus. What's interesting about T-Tauri
is that it's the first star known to be a very
young star in the sense that it's possibly
around a couple million years old. It's in the
neighborhood of lots of cold clouds of

molecules which can be the environment in
which stars form."
