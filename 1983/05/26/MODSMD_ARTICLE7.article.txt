Senate funds development of MX
Washington — The Senate voted 59-39 yesterday to
free $625 million for developing the MX, but swing
vote senators warned President Reagan that future fi
nancing of the missile would depend on progress in
arms-control negotiations.
A bipartisan group of moderates, led by Sen. Wil
liam Cohen (R-Maine) said that they were drafting a
letter to the president informing him that if he did not
move forward on serious negotiations as he prom
ised while lobbying for MX votes the Senate could
hold up future funding for the controversial MX sys
tem.
"I don't think there should be any popping of
champagne bottles today," Sen. Dan Quayle (R-lnd.)

warned the White House in a floor speech before the
vote.
Quayle said that the House's 239-186 approval of
the funds Tuesday and the Senate vote yesterday were
"not a vote for the MX alone. That would not get 35
votes in this chamber." Instead, he and other senators
said, Congress was voting for the MX as leverage for
an arms-control agreement with the Soviets.
In a conciliatory victory statement yesterday, Rea
gan praised the congressional "votes of confidence"
as "a decisive, historic contribution to our nation's se
curity."
Hailing Congress' "new bipartisan unity that can
make us both stronger and safer than before," the
president's statement concluded: "My fondest wish is
for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. In

this spirit, I urge the Soviets to join us at Geneva in tak
ing that giant first step: an equitable and verifiable
agreement that substantially reduces the number of
nuclear arsenals on both sides. The time for progress
in negotiations is now."
U.S. military trainer killed
San Salvador — Gunmen yesterday shot and killed
the security chief of U.S. military trainers in El
Salvador on the campus of a private university on the
outskirts of the city.
Navy Cmdr. Albert Schaufelberger of San Diego,
who had warned against possible guerrilla attacks on
American trainers here, died in the parking lot of the
Catholic University of Central America just before

nightfall. Schaufelberger, a stocky blond bachelor in
his early 30s, had evidently gone to the university to
pick up a friend.
He was the first American military trainer killed in El
Salvador.
It was not immediately known if the murderers
were guerrillas, who have not mounted any serious
attacks in the capital for more than a year.
Citing early and sketchy reports, U.S. Embassy
spokesman Donald Hamilton said the officer was
parked in his car waiting for a friend to arrive when a
second car pulled up alongside. He was shot four
times in the head and was dead on arrival at a military
hospital, Hamilton said.
