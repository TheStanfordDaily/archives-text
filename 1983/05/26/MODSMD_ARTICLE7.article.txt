Senate funds development of MX
Washington — The Senate voted 59-39 yesterday to
free $625 million for developing the MX, but swing
vote senators warned President Reagan that future fi
nancing of the missile would depend on progress in
arms-control negotiations.
A bipartisan group of moderates, led by Sen. Wil
liam Cohen (R-Maine) said that they were drafting a
letter to the president informing him that if he did not
move forward on serious negotiations as he prom
ised while lobbying for MX votes the Senate could
hold up future funding for the controversial MX sys
tem.
"I don't think there should be any popping of
champagne bottles today," Sen. Dan Quayle (R-lnd.)

warned the White House in a floor speech before the
vote.
Quayle said that the House's 239-186 approval of
the funds Tuesday and the Senate vote yesterday were
"not a vote for the MX alone. That would not get 35
votes in this chamber." Instead, he and other senators
said, Congress was voting for the MX as leverage for
an arms-control agreement with the Soviets.
In a conciliatory victory statement yesterday, Rea
gan praised the congressional "votes of confidence"
as "a decisive, historic contribution to our nation's se
curity."
Hailing Congress' "new bipartisan unity that can
make us both stronger and safer than before," the
president's statement concluded: "My fondest wish is
for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. In

this spirit, I urge the Soviets to join us at Geneva in tak
ing that giant first step: an equitable and verifiable
agreement that substantially reduces the number of
nuclear arsenals on both sides. The time for progress
in negotiations is now."
U.S. military trainer killed
San Salvador — Gunmen yesterday shot and killed
the security chief of U.S. military trainers in El
Salvador on the campus of a private university on the
outskirts of the city.
Navy Cmdr. Albert Schaufelberger of San Diego,
who had warned against possible guerrilla attacks on
American trainers here, died in the parking lot of the
Catholic University of Central America just before

nightfall. Schaufelberger, a stocky blond bachelor in
his early 30s, had evidently gone to the university to
pick up a friend.
He was the first American military trainer killed in El
Salvador.
It was not immediately known if the murderers
were guerrillas, who have not mounted any serious
attacks in the capital for more than a year.
Citing early and sketchy reports, U.S. Embassy
spokesman Donald Hamilton said the officer was
parked in his car waiting for a friend to arrive when a
second car pulled up alongside. He was shot four
times in the head and was dead on arrival at a military
hospital, Hamilton said.
Schaufelberger, a naval officer's son who had ar
rived in El Salvador last Aug. 1, was deputy com
mander of the 55-man U.S. military group here. He
was also chief of the naval section and security officer
for the entire group.
As recently as last Friday, Schaufelberger had ex
pressed concern that guerrillas might attack military
trainers here.
He told one American correspondent that the in
surgents "may be getting to the stage where it is no
more Mr. Nice Guy. They may now be willing to hit
American trainers. As security officer I am telling my
people if that's it, watch your ass."
Schaufelberger was on longtime assignment to El
Salvador, unlike most of his fellow trainers who are
rotated through the country on short tours of duty.
Nominees promise impartiality
Washington — President Reagan's three new nomi
nees to the Civil Rights Commission pledged their in
dependence of the White House yesterday and
sought to counter charges that they were appointed
to slow down government efforts to eliminate dis
crimination.
New York attorney Morris Abram, one of those
nominated, said that, "whatever reason the President
has for changing personnel at the commission," no
promises of specific action had been exacted from the
nominees who would reconstitute half the com
mission.
Abram, along with nominees John Bunzel, former
president of San Jose State University, and Robert
Destro, assistant law professor at Catholic University
here, are expected to undergo tough questioning at
Senate confirmation hearings. If approved by the
Senate, they would replace three Democratic mem
bers appointed by former President Jimmy Carter.
Two Democratic Senate sources who requested
anonymity said that, unlike a year ago, Reagan's ef
forts to replace half the commissioners probably
would be successful this time. Abram, Bunzel and
Destro, also Democrats but more conservative than
those they would succeed, appear to be competent
and have proven records in the civil rights field, the
sources said.
Bunzel, presently a senior research fellow at Stan
ford University's Hoover Institution, told a White
House news briefing that "my dedication to civil
rights is a very important part of my life." Destro de
clared: "I share the vision that civil rights is the top
constitutional priority for all Americans."
Bunzel said he would assume his duties "knowing

full well that the president understands and wel
comes the independent thinking of all of us."
Syria fires on Israel
Beirut — Syrian warplanes flying above Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley fired missiles at Israeli reconnaissance
jets yesterday in the first air clash between the two
countries since last summer's war, but the missiles
failed to hit their targets.
Lebanese radio stations also reported that a Syrian
ground-to-air missile had downed a pilotless Israeli
drone aircraft flying over mountains overlooking the
southern part of the valley, but an Israeli spokesman
denied that any such incident had occurred.
Israeli officials tried to minimize the incident, Los
Angeles Times correspondent Norman Kempster re
ported from Jerusalem, but did confirm that the Syr
ians had fired air-to-air missiles at the reconnaissance
jets. The military command first issued only a bland
announcement:
"This morning, Syrian aircraft attempted to in
tercept Israeli air force planes which were on a rou
tine reconnaissance mission over Lebanon. No aerial
battle developed. All our planes returned safely to
their bases. The air force is continuing our flights as
usual."
In answer to questions, however, the spokesman
said that missiles had been fired by the Syrian planes
but that they had missed. Asked about the report of
the reconnaissance drone being shot down, he said,
"We deny it."
Watt sells record drilling lease
New Orleans — Interior Secretary James Watt sold
nearly $3.5 billion worth of oil and gas drilling rights
off the Gulf Coast yesterday in the largest and poten
tially most lucrative lease offering in history.
Watt, who announced the resultsto more than 1000
cheering oilmen in New Orleans' Superdome sports
stadium, said the massive sale confirmed that industry
supports his controversial five-year program to step
up leasing of oil and mineral rights on federal lands.
"Today's offering was market-driven," said Watt,
who wore a scarlet auctioneer's jacket as he attended
his first offshore lease sale. "Tracts receiving bids
were identified by industry rather than government
specialists in Washington."
The lease offering involved nearly 40 million off
shore acres in a broad swath fromtheTexas-Louisiana
line to the Alabama-Georgia line and extending as
much as 220 miles into the Gulf of Mexico. The area
included every unclaimed tract in the central Gulf

area, from which oil companies were permitted to
pick and choose.
The previous high for a Gulf lease sale was in Sep
tember 1980, when the government accepted $2.7
billion in bids on slightly less than a million acres iden
tified for leasing by federal energy specialists. But that
offering came when oil prices were soaring and sup
plies were short. Yesterday's offering comes at a time
of oversupply and slumping oil prices.
35 nation conference planned
Washington — The United States and the Soviet
Union appear ready to participate in a new 35-nation
conference to negotiate ways to reduce the like
lihood of surprise attack in Europe by monitoring
movement of NATO and Soviet bloc forces there.
One goal of such a conference would be to open
for the first time all of Europe, including European
territory of the Soviet Union, to mandatory inspection,
of certain military exercises and maneuvers by either
side.
Establishing such a conference to negotiate so
called confidence-building measures applicable from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains in the Sovi
et Union has long been a goal of America's allies, par
ticularly France, which originally proposed it in 1978.
U.S. officials cautioned, however, that final agree
ment to hold the conference is contingent on suc
cessful negotiations at the current 35-nation con
ference in Madrid reviewing adherence to the Hel
sinki accords on human rights. They said the final de
cision may hinge on Soviet performance on such
things as Jewish emigration and Soviet treatment of
dissidents.
Some initial provisions for military confidence
building measures were included in the 1975 agree
ment on European security, cooperation and human
rights signed in Helsinki by 33 European nations, in
cluding the Soviet Union, plus the United States and
Canada.
Quake shakes Japan
Tokyo, Japan — A major earthquake hit the north
western state of Atika today, causing fires at an oil re
finery and other locations and prompting authorities
to issue a tidal wave warning, the Central
Meteorological Agency said.
Authorities said the earthquake measured 7.7 on
the Richter scale and that its epicenter was located in
the sea off Akita, a coastal state in northern Honshu
about 280 miles north of Tokyo.

Authorities immediately issued a tidal wave warn
ing. The agency said the first waves measuring 11.6 in
ches high was recorded on the coast in Aomori state,
on the northern tip of the main island of Honshu.
A second tidal wave is expected in northern Japan.
The Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHL) reported that
waves as high as six feet hit 50 students in a field trip in
northern Akita and said at least one was swept away
by the waves.
The quake sparked a fire at a crude oil storage tank
at a refinery and another fire at a thermal power plant
in Akita on the Japan Sea coast, the National Police
Agency said.
U.S. renews promise to China
Peking — In an effort to remove a major irritant in
Sino-American relations, the United States promised
yesterday to relax its controls on Chinese purchases of
some high-technology American products, a pledge
first made two years ago but not fulfilled.
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige told Pre
mier Zhao Ziyang that President Reagan had directed
him and otheradministration officials tosimplify their
departments' export-licensing prodecures. That
would allow China to buy the computers, precision
tools, scientific instruments and other sophisticated
equipment it had been offered but for which it has
had great difficulty getting licenses because of their
potential military application.
The Reagan administration apparently decided,
however, not to raise the levels of technology in the
products China may buy any higher than those set in
1981 nor to open categories of technology still closed
to China on grounds of national security.
Market approaches record again
The stock market swept ahead for the third straight
session yesterday, reaching record or near-record
highs amid spreading optimism about prospects for
the economic recovery.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed
9.97 to 1229.01, Just a few points shy of the closing
peak of 1232.59 it reached on May 5. Over the past
three sessions the average has soared 39.99 points.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows will be in the upper
40s to mid-60s, with highs ranging from the upper 50s
and 60s along the coast to the 80s and 90s over the in
terior.

western state of Atika today, causing fires at an oil re
finery and other locations and prompting authorities
to issue a tidal wave warning, the Central
Meteorological Agency said.
Authorities said the earthquake measured 7.7 on
the Richter scale and that its epicenter was located in
the sea off Akita, a coastal state in northern Honshu
about 280 miles north of Tokyo.

Authorities immediately issued a tidal wave warn
ing. The agency said the first waves measuring 11.6 in
ches high was recorded on the coast in Aomori state,
on the northern tip of the main island of Honshu.
A second tidal wave is expected in northern Japan.
The Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHL) reported that
waves as high as six feet hit 50 students in a field trip in
northern Akita and said at least one was swept away
by the waves.
The quake sparked a fire at a crude oil storage tank
at a refinery and another fire at a thermal power plant
in Akita on the Japan Sea coast, the National Police
Agency said.
U.S. renews promise to China
Peking — In an effort to remove a major irritant in
Sino-American relations, the United States promised
yesterday to relax its controls on Chinese purchases of
some high-technology American products, a pledge
first made two years ago but not fulfilled.
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige told Pre
mier Zhao Ziyang that President Reagan had directed
him and otheradministration officials tosimplify their
departments' export-licensing prodecures. That
would allow China to buy the computers, precision
tools, scientific instruments and other sophisticated
equipment it had been offered but for which it has
had great difficulty getting licenses because of their
potential military application.
The Reagan administration apparently decided,
however, not to raise the levels of technology in the
products China may buy any higher than those set in
1981 nor to open categories of technology still closed
to China on grounds of national security.
Market approaches record again
The stock market swept ahead for the third straight
session yesterday, reaching record or near-record

the economic recovery.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed
9.97 to 1229.01, Just a few points shy of the closing
peak of 1232.59 it reached on May 5. Over the past
three sessions the average has soared 39.99 points.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows will be in the upper
40s to mid-60s, with highs ranging from the upper 50s
and 60s along the coast to the 80s and 90s over the in

Senate funds development of MX
Washington — The Senate voted 59-39 yesterday to
free $625 million for developing the MX, but swing
vote senators warned President Reagan that future fi
nancing of the missile would depend on progress in
arms-control negotiations.
A bipartisan group of moderates, led by Sen. Wil
liam Cohen (R-Maine) said that they were drafting a
letter to the president informing him that if he did not
move forward on serious negotiations as he prom
ised while lobbying for MX votes the Senate could
hold up future funding for the controversial MX sys
tem.
"I don't think there should be any popping of
champagne bottles today," Sen. Dan Quayle (R-lnd.)

warned the White House in a floor speech before the
vote.
Quayle said that the House's 239-186 approval of
the funds Tuesday and the Senate vote yesterday were
"not a vote for the MX alone. That would not get 35
votes in this chamber." Instead, he and other senators
said, Congress was voting for the MX as leverage for
an arms-control agreement with the Soviets.
In a conciliatory victory statement yesterday, Rea
gan praised the congressional "votes of confidence"
as "a decisive, historic contribution to our nation's se
curity."
Hailing Congress' "new bipartisan unity that can
make us both stronger and safer than before," the
president's statement concluded: "My fondest wish is
for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. In

this spirit, I urge the Soviets to join us at Geneva in tak
ing that giant first step: an equitable and verifiable
agreement that substantially reduces the number of
nuclear arsenals on both sides. The time for progress
in negotiations is now."
U.S. military trainer killed
San Salvador — Gunmen yesterday shot and killed
the security chief of U.S. military trainers in El
Salvador on the campus of a private university on the
outskirts of the city.
Navy Cmdr. Albert Schaufelberger of San Diego,
who had warned against possible guerrilla attacks on
American trainers here, died in the parking lot of the
Catholic University of Central America just before

nightfall. Schaufelberger, a stocky blond bachelor in
his early 30s, had evidently gone to the university to
pick up a friend.
He was the first American military trainer killed in El
Salvador.
It was not immediately known if the murderers
were guerrillas, who have not mounted any serious
attacks in the capital for more than a year.
Citing early and sketchy reports, U.S. Embassy
spokesman Donald Hamilton said the officer was
parked in his car waiting for a friend to arrive when a
second car pulled up alongside. He was shot four
times in the head and was dead on arrival at a military
hospital, Hamilton said.
Schaufelberger, a naval officer's son who had ar
rived in El Salvador last Aug. 1, was deputy com
mander of the 55-man U.S. military group here. He
was also chief of the naval section and security officer
for the entire group.
As recently as last Friday, Schaufelberger had ex
pressed concern that guerrillas might attack military
trainers here.
He told one American correspondent that the in
surgents "may be getting to the stage where it is no
more Mr. Nice Guy. They may now be willing to hit
American trainers. As security officer I am telling my
people if that's it, watch your ass."
Schaufelberger was on longtime assignment to El
Salvador, unlike most of his fellow trainers who are
rotated through the country on short tours of duty.
Nominees promise impartiality
Washington — President Reagan's three new nomi
nees to the Civil Rights Commission pledged their in
dependence of the White House yesterday and
sought to counter charges that they were appointed
to slow down government efforts to eliminate dis
crimination.
New York attorney Morris Abram, one of those
nominated, said that, "whatever reason the President
has for changing personnel at the commission," no
promises of specific action had been exacted from the
nominees who would reconstitute half the com
mission.
Abram, along with nominees John Bunzel, former
president of San Jose State University, and Robert
Destro, assistant law professor at Catholic University
here, are expected to undergo tough questioning at
Senate confirmation hearings. If approved by the
Senate, they would replace three Democratic mem
bers appointed by former President Jimmy Carter.
Two Democratic Senate sources who requested
anonymity said that, unlike a year ago, Reagan's ef
forts to replace half the commissioners probably
would be successful this time. Abram, Bunzel and
Destro, also Democrats but more conservative than
those they would succeed, appear to be competent
and have proven records in the civil rights field, the
sources said.
Bunzel, presently a senior research fellow at Stan
ford University's Hoover Institution, told a White
House news briefing that "my dedication to civil
rights is a very important part of my life." Destro de
clared: "I share the vision that civil rights is the top
constitutional priority for all Americans."
Bunzel said he would assume his duties "knowing

full well that the president understands and wel
comes the independent thinking of all of us."
Syria fires on Israel
Beirut — Syrian warplanes flying above Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley fired missiles at Israeli reconnaissance
jets yesterday in the first air clash between the two
countries since last summer's war, but the missiles
failed to hit their targets.
Lebanese radio stations also reported that a Syrian
ground-to-air missile had downed a pilotless Israeli
drone aircraft flying over mountains overlooking the
southern part of the valley, but an Israeli spokesman
denied that any such incident had occurred.
Israeli officials tried to minimize the incident, Los
Angeles Times correspondent Norman Kempster re
ported from Jerusalem, but did confirm that the Syr
ians had fired air-to-air missiles at the reconnaissance
jets. The military command first issued only a bland
announcement:
"This morning, Syrian aircraft attempted to in
tercept Israeli air force planes which were on a rou
tine reconnaissance mission over Lebanon. No aerial
battle developed. All our planes returned safely to
their bases. The air force is continuing our flights as
usual."
In answer to questions, however, the spokesman
said that missiles had been fired by the Syrian planes
but that they had missed. Asked about the report of
the reconnaissance drone being shot down, he said,
"We deny it."
Watt sells record drilling lease
New Orleans — Interior Secretary James Watt sold
nearly $3.5 billion worth of oil and gas drilling rights
off the Gulf Coast yesterday in the largest and poten
tially most lucrative lease offering in history.
Watt, who announced the resultsto more than 1000
cheering oilmen in New Orleans' Superdome sports
stadium, said the massive sale confirmed that industry
supports his controversial five-year program to step
up leasing of oil and mineral rights on federal lands.
"Today's offering was market-driven," said Watt,
who wore a scarlet auctioneer's jacket as he attended
his first offshore lease sale. "Tracts receiving bids
were identified by industry rather than government
specialists in Washington."
The lease offering involved nearly 40 million off
shore acres in a broad swath fromtheTexas-Louisiana
line to the Alabama-Georgia line and extending as
much as 220 miles into the Gulf of Mexico. The area
included every unclaimed tract in the central Gulf

area, from which oil companies were permitted to
pick and choose.
The previous high for a Gulf lease sale was in Sep
tember 1980, when the government accepted $2.7
billion in bids on slightly less than a million acres iden
tified for leasing by federal energy specialists. But that
offering came when oil prices were soaring and sup
plies were short. Yesterday's offering comes at a time
of oversupply and slumping oil prices.
35 nation conference planned
Washington — The United States and the Soviet
Union appear ready to participate in a new 35-nation
conference to negotiate ways to reduce the like
lihood of surprise attack in Europe by monitoring
movement of NATO and Soviet bloc forces there.
One goal of such a conference would be to open
for the first time all of Europe, including European
territory of the Soviet Union, to mandatory inspection,
of certain military exercises and maneuvers by either
side.
Establishing such a conference to negotiate so
called confidence-building measures applicable from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains in the Sovi
et Union has long been a goal of America's allies, par
ticularly France, which originally proposed it in 1978.
U.S. officials cautioned, however, that final agree
ment to hold the conference is contingent on suc
cessful negotiations at the current 35-nation con
ference in Madrid reviewing adherence to the Hel
sinki accords on human rights. They said the final de
cision may hinge on Soviet performance on such
things as Jewish emigration and Soviet treatment of
dissidents.
Some initial provisions for military confidence
building measures were included in the 1975 agree
ment on European security, cooperation and human
rights signed in Helsinki by 33 European nations, in
cluding the Soviet Union, plus the United States and
Canada.

off the Gulf Coast yesterday in the largest and poten
tially most lucrative lease offering in history.
Watt, who announced the resultsto more than 1000
cheering oilmen in New Orleans' Superdome sports
stadium, said the massive sale confirmed that industry
supports his controversial five-year program to step
up leasing of oil and mineral rights on federal lands.
"Today's offering was market-driven," said Watt,
who wore a scarlet auctioneer's jacket as he attended
his first offshore lease sale. "Tracts receiving bids
were identified by industry rather than government
specialists in Washington."
The lease offering involved nearly 40 million off
shore acres in a broad swath fromtheTexas-Louisiana
line to the Alabama-Georgia line and extending as
much as 220 miles into the Gulf of Mexico. The area
included every unclaimed tract in the central Gulf

area, from which oil companies were permitted to
pick and choose.
The previous high for a Gulf lease sale was in Sep
tember 1980, when the government accepted $2.7
billion in bids on slightly less than a million acres iden
tified for leasing by federal energy specialists. But that
offering came when oil prices were soaring and sup
plies were short. Yesterday's offering comes at a time
of oversupply and slumping oil prices.
35 nation conference planned
Washington — The United States and the Soviet
Union appear ready to participate in a new 35-nation
conference to negotiate ways to reduce the like
lihood of surprise attack in Europe by monitoring
movement of NATO and Soviet bloc forces there.
One goal of such a conference would be to open
for the first time all of Europe, including European
territory of the Soviet Union, to mandatory inspection,
of certain military exercises and maneuvers by either
side.
Establishing such a conference to negotiate so
called confidence-building measures applicable from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains in the Sovi
et Union has long been a goal of America's allies, par
ticularly France, which originally proposed it in 1978.
U.S. officials cautioned, however, that final agree
ment to hold the conference is contingent on suc
cessful negotiations at the current 35-nation con
ference in Madrid reviewing adherence to the Hel
sinki accords on human rights. They said the final de
cision may hinge on Soviet performance on such
things as Jewish emigration and Soviet treatment of
dissidents.
Some initial provisions for military confidence
building measures were included in the 1975 agree
ment on European security, cooperation and human
rights signed in Helsinki by 33 European nations, in
cluding the Soviet Union, plus the United States and
Canada.
Quake shakes Japan
Tokyo, Japan — A major earthquake hit the north
western state of Atika today, causing fires at an oil re
finery and other locations and prompting authorities
to issue a tidal wave warning, the Central
Meteorological Agency said.
Authorities said the earthquake measured 7.7 on
the Richter scale and that its epicenter was located in
the sea off Akita, a coastal state in northern Honshu
about 280 miles north of Tokyo.

Authorities immediately issued a tidal wave warn
ing. The agency said the first waves measuring 11.6 in
ches high was recorded on the coast in Aomori state,
on the northern tip of the main island of Honshu.
A second tidal wave is expected in northern Japan.
The Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHL) reported that
waves as high as six feet hit 50 students in a field trip in
northern Akita and said at least one was swept away
by the waves.
The quake sparked a fire at a crude oil storage tank
at a refinery and another fire at a thermal power plant
in Akita on the Japan Sea coast, the National Police
Agency said.
U.S. renews promise to China
Peking — In an effort to remove a major irritant in
Sino-American relations, the United States promised
yesterday to relax its controls on Chinese purchases of
some high-technology American products, a pledge
first made two years ago but not fulfilled.
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige told Pre
mier Zhao Ziyang that President Reagan had directed
him and otheradministration officials tosimplify their
departments' export-licensing prodecures. That
would allow China to buy the computers, precision
tools, scientific instruments and other sophisticated
equipment it had been offered but for which it has
had great difficulty getting licenses because of their
potential military application.
The Reagan administration apparently decided,
however, not to raise the levels of technology in the
products China may buy any higher than those set in
1981 nor to open categories of technology still closed
to China on grounds of national security.
Market approaches record again
The stock market swept ahead for the third straight
session yesterday, reaching record or near-record
highs amid spreading optimism about prospects for
the economic recovery.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed
9.97 to 1229.01, Just a few points shy of the closing
peak of 1232.59 it reached on May 5. Over the past
three sessions the average has soared 39.99 points.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows will be in the upper
40s to mid-60s, with highs ranging from the upper 50s
and 60s along the coast to the 80s and 90s over the in

Senate funds development of MX
Washington — The Senate voted 59-39 yesterday to
free $625 million for developing the MX, but swing
vote senators warned President Reagan that future fi
nancing of the missile would depend on progress in
arms-control negotiations.
A bipartisan group of moderates, led by Sen. Wil
liam Cohen (R-Maine) said that they were drafting a
letter to the president informing him that if he did not
move forward on serious negotiations as he prom
ised while lobbying for MX votes the Senate could
hold up future funding for the controversial MX sys
tem.
"I don't think there should be any popping of
champagne bottles today," Sen. Dan Quayle (R-lnd.)

warned the White House in a floor speech before the
vote.
Quayle said that the House's 239-186 approval of
the funds Tuesday and the Senate vote yesterday were
"not a vote for the MX alone. That would not get 35
votes in this chamber." Instead, he and other senators
said, Congress was voting for the MX as leverage for
an arms-control agreement with the Soviets.
In a conciliatory victory statement yesterday, Rea
gan praised the congressional "votes of confidence"
as "a decisive, historic contribution to our nation's se
curity."
Hailing Congress' "new bipartisan unity that can
make us both stronger and safer than before," the
president's statement concluded: "My fondest wish is
for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons. In

this spirit, I urge the Soviets to join us at Geneva in tak
ing that giant first step: an equitable and verifiable
agreement that substantially reduces the number of
nuclear arsenals on both sides. The time for progress
in negotiations is now."
U.S. military trainer killed
San Salvador — Gunmen yesterday shot and killed
the security chief of U.S. military trainers in El
Salvador on the campus of a private university on the
outskirts of the city.
Navy Cmdr. Albert Schaufelberger of San Diego,
who had warned against possible guerrilla attacks on
American trainers here, died in the parking lot of the
Catholic University of Central America just before

nightfall. Schaufelberger, a stocky blond bachelor in
his early 30s, had evidently gone to the university to
pick up a friend.
He was the first American military trainer killed in El
Salvador.
It was not immediately known if the murderers
were guerrillas, who have not mounted any serious
attacks in the capital for more than a year.
Citing early and sketchy reports, U.S. Embassy
spokesman Donald Hamilton said the officer was
parked in his car waiting for a friend to arrive when a
second car pulled up alongside. He was shot four
times in the head and was dead on arrival at a military
hospital, Hamilton said.
Schaufelberger, a naval officer's son who had ar
rived in El Salvador last Aug. 1, was deputy com
mander of the 55-man U.S. military group here. He
was also chief of the naval section and security officer
for the entire group.
As recently as last Friday, Schaufelberger had ex
pressed concern that guerrillas might attack military
trainers here.
He told one American correspondent that the in
surgents "may be getting to the stage where it is no
more Mr. Nice Guy. They may now be willing to hit
American trainers. As security officer I am telling my
people if that's it, watch your ass."
Schaufelberger was on longtime assignment to El
Salvador, unlike most of his fellow trainers who are
rotated through the country on short tours of duty.
Nominees promise impartiality
Washington — President Reagan's three new nomi
nees to the Civil Rights Commission pledged their in
dependence of the White House yesterday and
sought to counter charges that they were appointed
to slow down government efforts to eliminate dis
crimination.
New York attorney Morris Abram, one of those
nominated, said that, "whatever reason the President
has for changing personnel at the commission," no
promises of specific action had been exacted from the
nominees who would reconstitute half the com
mission.
Abram, along with nominees John Bunzel, former
president of San Jose State University, and Robert
Destro, assistant law professor at Catholic University
here, are expected to undergo tough questioning at
Senate confirmation hearings. If approved by the
Senate, they would replace three Democratic mem
bers appointed by former President Jimmy Carter.
Two Democratic Senate sources who requested
anonymity said that, unlike a year ago, Reagan's ef
forts to replace half the commissioners probably
would be successful this time. Abram, Bunzel and
Destro, also Democrats but more conservative than
those they would succeed, appear to be competent
and have proven records in the civil rights field, the
sources said.
Bunzel, presently a senior research fellow at Stan
ford University's Hoover Institution, told a White
House news briefing that "my dedication to civil
rights is a very important part of my life." Destro de
clared: "I share the vision that civil rights is the top
constitutional priority for all Americans."
Bunzel said he would assume his duties "knowing

full well that the president understands and wel
comes the independent thinking of all of us."
Syria fires on Israel
Beirut — Syrian warplanes flying above Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley fired missiles at Israeli reconnaissance
jets yesterday in the first air clash between the two
countries since last summer's war, but the missiles
failed to hit their targets.
Lebanese radio stations also reported that a Syrian
ground-to-air missile had downed a pilotless Israeli
drone aircraft flying over mountains overlooking the
southern part of the valley, but an Israeli spokesman
denied that any such incident had occurred.
Israeli officials tried to minimize the incident, Los
Angeles Times correspondent Norman Kempster re
ported from Jerusalem, but did confirm that the Syr
ians had fired air-to-air missiles at the reconnaissance
jets. The military command first issued only a bland
announcement:
"This morning, Syrian aircraft attempted to in
tercept Israeli air force planes which were on a rou
tine reconnaissance mission over Lebanon. No aerial
battle developed. All our planes returned safely to
their bases. The air force is continuing our flights as
usual."
In answer to questions, however, the spokesman
said that missiles had been fired by the Syrian planes
but that they had missed. Asked about the report of
the reconnaissance drone being shot down, he said,
"We deny it."
