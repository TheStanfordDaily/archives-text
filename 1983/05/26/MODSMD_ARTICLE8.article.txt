## U.S. prepares for Summit of Industrialized Nations Leaders to concentrate on reducing world unemployment

Compiled from news reports and wire services
Reducing unemployment rather than harnes
sing inflation will be the major challenge facing
President Reagan and six other heads of gov
ernment at the ninth economic summit confer
ence this weekend in Williamsburg, Va., top
U.S. officials said Tuesday.
"Thethemesongofthesummitis jobs," Sec
retary of State George Shultz said at a news
briefing. "What the world needs now, in an
economic sense, is economic growth with low
and moderating inflation."
Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan
echoed that theme, referring to a total of 32
million unemployed persons in the seven sum
mit nations. "Our major challenge now is un
employment," he said. "We must create more
jobs and new jobs."
The United States, with an estimated 11.3 mil
lion people out of work, accounts for one-third
of the jobless total. Neither Shultz nor Regan,
however, gave any indication of what strategy
Reagan would propose to accomplish U.S. ob
jectives.
But they both said that an open world trading
system and elimination of protectionist barriers
were the keys to a global recovery from the
worst recession in more than 40 years.
"Things are not going too badly right now in
the United States,'' Shultz said of the economic
upturn that began last January and clearly
strengthened in April.
Regan said U.S. inflation, which was a major
topic at the previous two summit sessions that
Reagan attended, at Ottawa and Versailles, has
been brought down dramatically in the past
year. Interest rates, while still too high, also
have declined, he said, leaving unemployment
as the outstanding problem confronting the
United States, Great Britain, France, West Ger
many, Italy, Ganada and Japan at the summit.
French President Francois Mitterrand, how

ever, has charged that huge U.S. budget deficits
projected for the next few years would draw
overseas funds to the United States, keeping
interest rates high and threatening to torpedo
the recovery now under way.
The world economic outlook will be a major
topic when Reagan and the six other heads of
government assemble Sunday morning in his
toric Williamsburg, once the capital of Virginia,
for their first formal meeting.
The seven — along with President Gaston
Thorn of the European Economic Commission
— will meet alone, without any aides, for the
first 2Vi hours. Interpreters, stationed outside
the room but listening to the conversation, will
translate their remarks into five languages —
French, German, Italian, Japanese and English.
Foreign ministers and finance ministers will
join the presidents and prime ministers for
Sunday-afternoon and Monday-morning ses
sions, along with note-taking representatives of
each of the leaders, who will draft a final state
ment.
Reagan, Shultz said, insisted that the usual
summit practice of debating a staff-prepared
communique be abandoned at Williamsburg.
"It was felt that the communique should reflect
what was discussed rather than the other way
around," Shultz said. "It's a big innovation at
this summit."
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in
the midst of an election campaign at home, will
make a 24-hour visit to the summit, arriving in
time for Saturday-night dinner with the other
leaders and leaving before their Sunday-night
meal.
Others, including Canadian Prime Minister
Pierre Trudeau, German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone, Italian Prime Minister Amintore Fan
tani and Mitterrand, are expected to be present
for all the summit sessions.
