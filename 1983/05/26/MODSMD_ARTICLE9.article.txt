# 4000 journalists expected
## Williamsburg waits for media invasion 
### 
Compiled from news reports and wire services
The White House advance teams started
their invasion more than a month ago, oc
cupying the College of William and Mary's
Campus Center, expelling the students
and forcing the relocation of the senior
dance. Last week, the helicopters began
swooping down upon the town's restored
colonial village while caravans of black
limousines cruised its streets in dry-run
rehearsals.
"A lot of people are getting kind of tired
of all this," said Ryan Fletcher, a shop
keeper in the village who was dressed in
his usual costume of wig and breeches.
"It's sort of difficult to create an 18th cen
tury setting with all these helicopters fly
ing around."
The airborne intrusion is only one of the
irritants as planning for the ninth Summit
of Industrialized Nations reaches its cres
cendo. By the time the festivities begin
Saturday, more than 1500 diplomats and
support staff and as many as 4000 jour
nalists are expected to show up for a
three-day international extravaganza
whose cost is estimated at $7 million.
The White House, which has solicited
tax-deductible donations for the affair
from more than 100 companies, is calling it
a showcase for President Reagan's
private-sector initiative. The Colonial Wil
liamsburg Foundation — the Rockefeller
founded organization that operates the
restored Virginia colonial capital and has
received a $1 million contract to handle
the summit — is officially bullish, hoping
to profit from the worldwide publicity the
event will generate.
"This is the most complex and prestigi
ous thing to happen here since they
signed the Virginia Declaration of Rights in
1775," said Albert Louer, the foundation
spokesman.
But not everybody here is so excited
about all the commotion. The elaborate
arrangements — including the installation
of 600 telephones and 25 miles of cable —
have disrupted life in this small Tidewater
community, driven away some of its
tourists and annoyed many of its resi
dents.
"It's grandiose, it's a show," said Martin
Moorefield, a local hotel manager who
was less than impressed with the results of
last year's summit in Versailles and the
1981 gathering in Ottawa. "What benefits
have there been from the last two sum
mits?"
Most of the irritation, however, is di
rected not so much at President Reagan
and the leaders of the six additional indus
trial democracies that will gather here, but
at the hordes of journalists who are ex
pected to take over the town and share in

the summit extravagance. In fact, officials
acknowledge, a large part of the summit
budget is devoted to the care and feeding
of an international press corps that will
outnumber summit participants by better
than two to one.
At a cost of more than $1 million, Wil
liam and Mary's basketball arena has been
converted to a lavishly decorated Interna
tional Press Center that will provide free
typewriters, computer terminals, tele
phones and telex service for the jour
nalists. Gold carpeting has been laid over
the gymnasium floor, blue and white
drapes have been hung from the ceilings
and a new central air-conditioning system
has been installed, thanks to 50,000 feet of
electrical wiring.
"It's absolutely ridiculous," said Bucky
Walters, a tourist from Gloucester, Va.
"I'm sure all the hard-working students at
William and Mary can make do without
central air conditioning. I think everyone's
coddling to the media."
The air-conditioning system, however,
only begins to touch on the amenities
available to the visiting press corps. There
will be a post office, a currency exchange
desk and a travel agency inside the press
center and a 24-hour shuttle bus service to
take them to it. Outside the hall, a one
acre canvas tent stocked with exclusively
American cuisine will offer what one
summit spokesman calls "continuous"
free food service.
Encouraged by White House promises
of tax breaks and the prospect of good
public relations, more than 65 firms have
donated foods for the press tent, includ
ing 2300 pounds of chicken and 1800
pounds of Cornish game hens. Granny
Good Foods of Oakland, Calif., has
supplied 1020 bags of Hawaiian-style,
extra-thick potato chips and another firm
has shipped in 1296 bags of pretzels.
Anheuser Busch, Stroh's and Coors will
offer kegs and trucks of beer on an "as
needed basis," another spokesman says.
California wine companies have donated
120 cases of wine.
To be sure, none of this compares to the
menus of Alaska king crab, Maine lobster
and American caviar that have been de
vised for the heads of state by Craig
Claiborne, The New York Times food critic
who is serving as a consultant to the sum
mit. But the job of obtaining enough food
to feed the press corps has exasperated
summit planners nonetheless.
"It's unfortunate," says Michael
McManus, who as summit administrator
has been in charge of making arrange
ments for the journalists. "I don't think

summits were ever intended to require
this kind of role in terms of support for the
press, especially since they (the reporters)
are all on expense accounts. But somehow
it has evolved that way."
The larger question for many, however,
is exactly what the journalists are going to
have to write about. The summit is sup
posed to map out a strategy for world eco
nomic recovery. But all the plenary ses
sions — along with the evening banquets
at a nearby plantation Saturday and the
restored Royal Governor's Palace on Sun
day — will be conducted in private. The
only official event open to the media will
be President Reagan's reading of a joint
communique, to take place in the press
center from 3 to 3:10 p.m. Monday, ac
cording to the official summit schedule.
The expectation that many of the jour
nalists will be doing a lot of idle wandering
has prompted Colonial Williamsburg to
instruct its employees to show up for work
in their 18th century costumes, even
though the village itself will be closed to
the public for the first time in its 57-year
history. Meanwhile, the state of Virginia
has decided to vie for their attention by
setting up a tourism booth in the press
center.
"The state is hoping that while some of
the journalists are sitting around waiting
for briefings they will write sidebars about
Virginia Beach or other tourist attrac
tions," said George Stoddart, press secre
tary to Gov. Charles Robb.
The occupation of Williamsburg had
once instilled fear among local merchants
and innkeepers, who worried that the
closing of Colonial Williamsburg com
bined with tight security surrounding the
summit would scare off tourists. But the
Innkeepers of Williamsburg, a local trade
association, counterattacked by launching
an East Coast advertising campaign prom
oting Dick Clark's "Good Ol' Rock 'N' Roll
Show," also scheduled for this weekend at
nearby Busch Gardens.
The Busch Gardens crowd, combined
with the journalists who have taken out
rooms at most of the town's larger hotels,
appears to have alleviated much of the
early concern. But some of the smaller
motels, shunned by the journalists, are
still empty and are having trouble attract
ing tourists frightened off by the summit
publicity.
Norma Crammer, owner of the 21-room
Ironbound Inn, said last week that she was
still one-third empty for Memorial Day.
"I've been entertaining the idea of send
ing the White House a bill for the empty
rooms."
