OFF-CAMPUS STUDENTS
If you live off-campus now and will be moving
out of your place in June or September, we
need your help. The Rental Housing
Information Office want us to pass your
apartment, house, or room on to another
Stanford student. Please call us at 497-3906, ,
or stop by in Old Union, Room 315, for
information on listing your place for other
students.
And hurry, our Spring Clearinghouse is
going on NOW!
