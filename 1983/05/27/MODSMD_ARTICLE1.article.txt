# Popular professor's teaching skills don't guarantee tenure
## 
### BILL BEYDA 
Consider the following situation: an associate profes
sor is in his sixth year at Stanford. He is an associate
department chairman. The general consensus among
students is that he is one of the best teachers in the
department. The department chairman thinks very
highly of him. It would seem that his tenure would be
almost automatic.
But in the case of Electrical Engineering Prof. Charles
Williams, tenure is far from automatic. According to
Robert White, Electrical Engineering Department chair
man, "his publication record is such that he will proba
bly not be approved for a tenure appointment next
year." The decision regarding tenure is customarily
made during the seventh year.
"There are some members of our department that feel
teachers not doing research will not keep up with new
developments," White said, "and many on the (E.E. De
partment) Executive Committee feel this way."
In spite of this, White wants Williams to stav here.

"Chuck Williams is first class," White said. "He's a great
teacher, and we're trying to arrange a Professorship for
Teaching for him, which would be a non-tenured posi
tion, but would allow him to stay here and concentrate
on teaching — something he's very good at.
But the Professorships for Teaching are rare, accord
ing to White. "They are few and far between," White
said.
What is interesting about William's case is that he is
almost universally regarded among E.E. students as one
of the best teachers in the department.
His case is a perfect example of the difficult choice the
University faces in weighing research and teaching skills
in tenure decisions. His case also indicates that without
an excellent research record even the best and most
effective teachers can not expect tenure.
"Professor Williams is certainly one of the finest
teachers that I've encountered at Stanford,'' said Al
Carlson, a junior majoring in E.E. "Last summer, he led
me step-by-step through a project which applied the

concepts I had learned in his class the previous quarter. I
learned as much from that experience as I have from any
course at Stanford. His presence on the faculty of the
Electrical Engineering Department is a tremendous asset
to all students fortunate enough to take a course from
him."
"It would be a shame for Stanford to lose a professor
with the teaching abilities that professor Williams has,"
said Dori Duchow, a junior major in E.E. "I've learned an
incredible amount in the short span of a quarter. I'd hate
to think that future electrical engineering students
would not have the opportunity to take a class from Prof.
Williams."
"Prof. Williams has a knack for presenting material
right at the student's level, making it clear and easy to
understand," said Anne Friend, a junior majoring in E.E.
"He always seems to be exceptionally knowledgeable in
many different areas of electrical engineering. Of all the
E.E. professors at Stanford I've taken courses from, Prof.

Williams is certainly one of the best."
Another perspective came from |oe McCarthy, a
teaching assistant. "There are few people willing to do
more than him to help things run smoothly with T.A.'s in
the department . . . few teachers expressed the interest
that he did in his students. He's one of the department's
better teachers."
In addition to teaching, Williams has spent much time
on administrative matters as associate chairman. This
includes recent additions to the curriculum, such as the
E.E. technical writing requirement and other changes
under discussion.
Next year Williams will be working half-time, accord
ing to White, so he can spend some additional time
working for a company he owns in the South Bay. This
will provide an alternative for him, in case he doesn't
receive either tenure or the professorship of teaching,
White said.
Williams declined to be interviewed because he felt it
would be inappropriate. A source close to Williams said,
"Chuck doesn't want to start a big controversy," but that
he really would like to stay at Stanford full-time.
The tenure process is made up of many steps, accord
ing to White. "First he would have to be approved by the
executive committee of the Electrical Engineering De
partment, then by the executive committee of the

School of Engineering, then by the provost, then by the
advisory board and finally by the board of trustees,"
White said.
One student, who requested anonymity, summed it
up this way, "If they don't want to give him tenure, I
guess that's their right. But to lose a professor like Wil
liams is a crime. Maybe that professorship of teaching is
ideal for him, but if that doesn't come through, and he
has to leave, it will not do Stanford any good. The execu
tive committee will have won their theoretical battle, but
the students will have lost a very real one — an excellent
teacher will be lost."

E.E. professors at Stanford I've taken courses from, Prof.

Williams is certainly one of the best."
Another perspective came from |oe McCarthy, a
teaching assistant. "There are few people willing to do
more than him to help things run smoothly with T.A.'s in
the department . . . few teachers expressed the interest
that he did in his students. He's one of the department's
better teachers."
In addition to teaching, Williams has spent much time
on administrative matters as associate chairman. This
includes recent additions to the curriculum, such as the
E.E. technical writing requirement and other changes
under discussion.
Next year Williams will be working half-time, accord
ing to White, so he can spend some additional time
working for a company he owns in the South Bay. This
will provide an alternative for him, in case he doesn't
receive either tenure or the professorship of teaching,
White said.
Williams declined to be interviewed because he felt it
would be inappropriate. A source close to Williams said,
"Chuck doesn't want to start a big controversy," but that
he really would like to stay at Stanford full-time.
The tenure process is made up of many steps, accord
ing to White. "First he would have to be approved by the
executive committee of the Electrical Engineering De
partment, then by the executive committee of the

School of Engineering, then by the provost, then by the
advisory board and finally by the board of trustees,"
White said.
One student, who requested anonymity, summed it
up this way, "If they don't want to give him tenure, I
guess that's their right. But to lose a professor like Wil
liams is a crime. Maybe that professorship of teaching is
ideal for him, but if that doesn't come through, and he
has to leave, it will not do Stanford any good. The execu
tive committee will have won their theoretical battle, but
the students will have lost a very real one — an excellent
teacher will be lost."

Charles Williams, popular with students in the School

tenure appointment next year because of his research
and publication record.
Consider the following situation: an associate profes
sor is in his sixth year at Stanford. He is an associate
department chairman. The general consensus among
students is that he is one of the best teachers in the
department. The department chairman thinks very
highly of him. It would seem that his tenure would be
almost automatic.
But in the case of Electrical Engineering Prof. Charles
Williams, tenure is far from automatic. According to
Robert White, Electrical Engineering Department chair
man, "his publication record is such that he will proba
bly not be approved for a tenure appointment next
year." The decision regarding tenure is customarily
made during the seventh year.
"There are some members of our department that feel
teachers not doing research will not keep up with new
developments," White said, "and many on the (E.E. De
partment) Executive Committee feel this way."
In spite of this, White wants Williams to stav here.

"Chuck Williams is first class," White said. "He's a great
teacher, and we're trying to arrange a Professorship for
Teaching for him, which would be a non-tenured posi
tion, but would allow him to stay here and concentrate
on teaching — something he's very good at.
But the Professorships for Teaching are rare, accord
ing to White. "They are few and far between," White
said.
What is interesting about William's case is that he is
almost universally regarded among E.E. students as one
of the best teachers in the department.
His case is a perfect example of the difficult choice the
University faces in weighing research and teaching skills
in tenure decisions. His case also indicates that without
an excellent research record even the best and most
effective teachers can not expect tenure.
"Professor Williams is certainly one of the finest
teachers that I've encountered at Stanford,'' said Al
Carlson, a junior majoring in E.E. "Last summer, he led
me step-by-step through a project which applied the

concepts I had learned in his class the previous quarter. I
learned as much from that experience as I have from any
course at Stanford. His presence on the faculty of the
Electrical Engineering Department is a tremendous asset
to all students fortunate enough to take a course from
him."
"It would be a shame for Stanford to lose a professor
with the teaching abilities that professor Williams has,"
said Dori Duchow, a junior major in E.E. "I've learned an
incredible amount in the short span of a quarter. I'd hate
to think that future electrical engineering students
would not have the opportunity to take a class from Prof.
Williams."
"Prof. Williams has a knack for presenting material
right at the student's level, making it clear and easy to
understand," said Anne Friend, a junior majoring in E.E.
"He always seems to be exceptionally knowledgeable in
many different areas of electrical engineering. Of all the
E.E. professors at Stanford I've taken courses from, Prof.

Williams is certainly one of the best."
