## ASSU treated McCloskey unfairly 
### 
In view of the fact that University
Vice President and Provost Albert
Hastorf has called for an inquiry into
possible violations of the ASSU Guest
Professor Paul "Pete" McCloskey's
academic freedom, I would like to
make the following comments.
When I voted for McCloskey's ap
pointment I did not foresee that the
Guest Professorship Board (GPB)
could in any way interfere with the
content of the course. Although his
nomination was politically controver
sial, I was under the impression that
the Political Science Department had
approved the course proposal on the
basis of a careful review of McClos
key's qualifications and the definitive
course syllabus.
Unfortunately, it turned out other
wise. The GPB failed to sign an
adequate contract with McCloskey
and its director, Seth Linfield,sawfit to
censor the proposed reading list. Need
less to say, it is left to the University to
determine whether he violated the
Guest Professor's academic freedom
in doing so.
There is some evidence that the
principle of academic freedom is not
taken seriously in the ASSU. For one
thing, an influential graduate senator
has commented that McCloskey
doesn't deserve any academic free
dom, since he is merely an employee
of the ASSU and not a regular faculty
member. What's more, the previous
ASSU Senate recently revised the
bylaws so as to give in my view exces
sive power to the GPB; the amend
ment, written by Graduate Senator
Jim McGrath and GPB Director Lin
field, requires the GPB to have any
proposal evaluated by "scholars,"
who may be students, allows it to im
pose additional academic require
ments and gives it the power to revoke
the title of, adjust the salary of and fire
the guest professor for any violation of
contract or with "just" cause, what
ever that means.
In my view, the McGrath-Linfield
rules amount to a temptation of the
GPB to violate the guest professor's
academic freedom. One of the new di
rectors (a freshman) has already an
nounced that he intends to continue
the practice of reviewing reading lists
in order to ensure that courses will be
academically rigorous and college
level. Furthermore, the rules enable
the GPB to harass the guest professor,
since any breach of contract could
conceivably be used as a pretext to

take punitive action.
Last Tuesday I introduced a resolu
tion in the senate directing the GPB to
obtain, whenever possible, written
evaluations by faculty members of
nominees' qualifications, proposed
course outlines and reading lists. I also
urged the GPB to use its discretionary
power in case of breach of contract
with great caution, and in consulta
tion with the Council of Presidents.
Much to my amazement, the senate
refused to vote on my proposals, the
main reason being that Linfield and
the two new directors of the GPB had
left the meeting early.
Whether the GPB likes it or not, I
will propose a drastic change of the
bylaws at the first meeting of the sen
ate in Autumn Quarter, if only to
prove that McCloskey was wrong
when he called the senate the "laugh
ing stock of the Bay Area."

End use policy
The Stanford Committee on re
search, by a 7-2 vote, has decided that
the 1971 "Statement of Principles on
Research" should not be changed
(Daily, May 24). This decision means
that the Committee, or any other offi
cial University body, will not chal
lenge the current proposal to conduct
nuclear weapons research at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory (SSRL).
This decision brings out my worst
fears about my scientific colleagues.
Scientists consistently behave like
hired guns: you can pay one to do
anything. By refusing to challenge the
Stanford "no end use" policy — that
research is not to be judged on the
basis of application — the Committee
on Research and the University have
failed miserably in their responsibility
to provide political and social leader
ship in issues beyond the campus bor
ders. I cannot say enough about their
irresponsible action. It is amoral,
hypocritical, myopic and makes me
embarassed to be a scientist.
Universities have not always been
so noncommital and nonjudgmental
on quesions of end use, and have in
the past been quite willing to become
institutionally involved in national
and global politics, especially during
times of national crisis. The outstand
ing examples of such involvement are
the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos,

and the development of radar at the
MIT Radiation Laboratory. To Euro
pean physicists such as Einstein,
Fermi, Szilard and von Neumann the
Bomb was not just an advancement in
human knowledge but part of a des
perate race with the Nazi war ma
chine. To say "end use" was on the
minds of those physicists and the in
stitutions they represented is an un
derstatement.
Academic institutional contribu
tions to political issues are nothing
new. They put Stanford on the map.
Now, when the dangers of nuclear ex
change are frightening, it is time for
the scientific community and the in
stitutions of which they are a part to
make an altogether different contrib
ution, one which if anything threatens
the source of funds.
Those on the Committee on Re
search have made it amply clear that
they will not make that contribution
or provide that leadership. They have
not made "end use" go away, but have
simply given a carte blanche for outside
funding sources (in this case, the
weapons establishment) to buy into
and manipulate the ends of the Uni
versity. They have, principles intact,
led the Farm to slop at the trough of
the military.
If the Stanford administration was
truly concerned about the freedom of
its researchers, it would be better to
challenge the funding policies of the
federal government, for example the
decline in "peer review" funding as
opposed to "project" funding. It
would be better to defend Stanford
labortories against the invasion of
military-oriented research projects, if
the University community objects to
them, and get SSRL Director
Bienenstock off his current hot seat,
having to choose between irate lab
scientists and irate funding patrons.
When it comes to scientific respon
sibility, Tom Lehrer said it best in his
song about Dr. Werner von Braun, a
famous American scientist, who dur
ing World War II designed the V-2
rocket that destroyed a good deal of
London:
Don't say that he's hypocritical,
Rut rather, that he's apolitical,
"Once the rockets go up, who
cares where they come down?
"That's not my department," said
Werner von Braun.

the source of funds.
Those on the Committee on Re
search have made it amply clear that
they will not make that contribution
or provide that leadership. They have
not made "end use" go away, but have
simply given a carte blanche for outside
funding sources (in this case, the
weapons establishment) to buy into
and manipulate the ends of the Uni
versity. They have, principles intact,
led the Farm to slop at the trough of
the military.
If the Stanford administration was
truly concerned about the freedom of
its researchers, it would be better to
challenge the funding policies of the
federal government, for example the
decline in "peer review" funding as
opposed to "project" funding. It
would be better to defend Stanford
labortories against the invasion of
military-oriented research projects, if
the University community objects to
them, and get SSRL Director
Bienenstock off his current hot seat,
having to choose between irate lab
scientists and irate funding patrons.
When it comes to scientific respon

famous American scientist, who dur

Don't say that he's hypocritical,
Rut rather, that he's apolitical,
"Once the rockets go up, who
cares where they come down?

In view of the fact that University
Vice President and Provost Albert
Hastorf has called for an inquiry into
possible violations of the ASSU Guest
Professor Paul "Pete" McCloskey's
academic freedom, I would like to
make the following comments.
When I voted for McCloskey's ap
pointment I did not foresee that the
Guest Professorship Board (GPB)
could in any way interfere with the
content of the course. Although his
nomination was politically controver
sial, I was under the impression that
the Political Science Department had
approved the course proposal on the
basis of a careful review of McClos
key's qualifications and the definitive
course syllabus.
Unfortunately, it turned out other
wise. The GPB failed to sign an
adequate contract with McCloskey
and its director, Seth Linfield,sawfit to
censor the proposed reading list. Need
less to say, it is left to the University to
determine whether he violated the
Guest Professor's academic freedom
in doing so.
There is some evidence that the
principle of academic freedom is not
taken seriously in the ASSU. For one
thing, an influential graduate senator
has commented that McCloskey
doesn't deserve any academic free
dom, since he is merely an employee
of the ASSU and not a regular faculty
member. What's more, the previous
ASSU Senate recently revised the
bylaws so as to give in my view exces
sive power to the GPB; the amend
ment, written by Graduate Senator
Jim McGrath and GPB Director Lin
field, requires the GPB to have any
proposal evaluated by "scholars,"
who may be students, allows it to im
pose additional academic require
ments and gives it the power to revoke
the title of, adjust the salary of and fire
the guest professor for any violation of
contract or with "just" cause, what
ever that means.
In my view, the McGrath-Linfield
rules amount to a temptation of the
GPB to violate the guest professor's
academic freedom. One of the new di
rectors (a freshman) has already an
nounced that he intends to continue
the practice of reviewing reading lists
in order to ensure that courses will be
academically rigorous and college
level. Furthermore, the rules enable
the GPB to harass the guest professor,
since any breach of contract could
conceivably be used as a pretext to

take punitive action.
Last Tuesday I introduced a resolu
tion in the senate directing the GPB to
obtain, whenever possible, written
evaluations by faculty members of
nominees' qualifications, proposed
course outlines and reading lists. I also
urged the GPB to use its discretionary
power in case of breach of contract
with great caution, and in consulta
tion with the Council of Presidents.
Much to my amazement, the senate
refused to vote on my proposals, the
main reason being that Linfield and
the two new directors of the GPB had
left the meeting early.
Whether the GPB likes it or not, I
will propose a drastic change of the
bylaws at the first meeting of the sen
ate in Autumn Quarter, if only to
prove that McCloskey was wrong
when he called the senate the "laugh
ing stock of the Bay Area."

End use policy
The Stanford Committee on re
search, by a 7-2 vote, has decided that
the 1971 "Statement of Principles on
Research" should not be changed
(Daily, May 24). This decision means
that the Committee, or any other offi
cial University body, will not chal
lenge the current proposal to conduct
nuclear weapons research at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory (SSRL).
This decision brings out my worst
fears about my scientific colleagues.
Scientists consistently behave like
hired guns: you can pay one to do
anything. By refusing to challenge the
Stanford "no end use" policy — that
research is not to be judged on the
basis of application — the Committee
on Research and the University have
failed miserably in their responsibility
to provide political and social leader
ship in issues beyond the campus bor
ders. I cannot say enough about their
irresponsible action. It is amoral,
hypocritical, myopic and makes me
embarassed to be a scientist.
Universities have not always been
so noncommital and nonjudgmental
on quesions of end use, and have in
the past been quite willing to become
institutionally involved in national
and global politics, especially during
times of national crisis. The outstand
ing examples of such involvement are
the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos,

and the development of radar at the
MIT Radiation Laboratory. To Euro
pean physicists such as Einstein,
Fermi, Szilard and von Neumann the
Bomb was not just an advancement in
human knowledge but part of a des
perate race with the Nazi war ma
chine. To say "end use" was on the
minds of those physicists and the in
stitutions they represented is an un
derstatement.
Academic institutional contribu
tions to political issues are nothing
new. They put Stanford on the map.
Now, when the dangers of nuclear ex
change are frightening, it is time for
the scientific community and the in
stitutions of which they are a part to
make an altogether different contrib
ution, one which if anything threatens
the source of funds.
Those on the Committee on Re
