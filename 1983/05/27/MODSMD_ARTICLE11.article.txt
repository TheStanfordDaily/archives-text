# The
						Mickey Mouse mentality here

### 
The only really valuable thing that
you can get out of Stanford isasenseof
self-worth. Grades, athletics, publica
tions, shows and boyfriends or
girlfriends are all meaningless com
pared to a sense of self-esteem.
Think of it in terms of time. If you're
a guy, and you take out a girl, the date
will maybe last threeor four hours. It's
the same with a show. You work hard
for two months so you can put on a
show, but it all ends in three or four
nights. And a football game? It's over
in a couple of hours. But you have to
live with yourself forever.
What are the signs of a person with
self-esteem? He doesn't need to be
connected to anything. He doesn't
hide behind grades, clubs or people.
Since he appreciates himself, though,
he appreciates other people and so he
wants to get involved in their ac
tivities.
At Stanford it is difficut to develop
self-esteem because the school is so
seducing. The Stanford way of life is
very appealing, and it has a dominant
position on campus. It is difficult not to
make the Stanford way of life your
way of life.
How does one describe this Stan
ford way of life? Well, if the school
had a show like the Mickey Mouse
Show, the opening song would go
something like this:
S is for Stanford, where nobody is
poor,
T is for time, of which everyone says
they need more,
A is for animal, which is how you act
during your first year,
N is for nice, which is how teachers
describe students here,
F is for fun, which means football
games and the flicks,
O is for The Oasis, which is where
you go to drink with Palo Alto hicks,
R is for run, which is what you do to
stay in great shape,
D is for dominate, which is what
you're supposed to do when you
graduate.
Now I'm not saying that any of these
things are bad. I'm saying that it is easy

to let it become a part of your system
and to accept them as ways of life.
When that happens, you no longer
have full control of yourself, and you
thereby are impeding your personal
progress.
Trie key is to constantly question
and challenge yourself. When you go
to dinner, don't immediately sit with
the people that you have sat with the
whole year. First ask yourself why
you're sitting with them. Is it because
you think they are so interesting, or
because you are too afraid and lazy to
meet new people?
When you choose a class
schedule, do you ask yourself why
you're taking certain classes? Is it be
cause you really like the ones you're
taking, or because you're afraid you
won't do well in others? Even worse',
is it because if you don't take those
classes you won't be able to call
yourself pre-med or pre-law?
Before asking somebody out on a
date, ask yourself if you're attracted
to that person because of prettiness
or because that person has qualities
you respect. If you eat with the same
people every night, take pre-med
classes only because everyone else
does and only associate with beauti
ful people, that is just as good as
doing the other things listed. The
main point is that you haven't taken
yourself or your acts for granted.
You've taken the time to learn about
yourself, and you're therefore mov
ing toward greater self-respect.
That is one of the characteristics of
a person with self-esteem. He has full
cognizance of his actions. Once a
person has achieved this recogni
tion, he obviously will not do things
that he doesn't believe are right. He
is therefore on his way toward be
coming a great person.
Of course, other than the self
questioning method, there is another
way to achieve self-esteem. You can
put your neck in a guillotine so often,
and stare at that big guillotine blade so
much, that if the thing doesn't succeed
in killing you then you will have to
respect yourself.

By saying you should put your
head in a guillotine, I don't mean
doing completely foolish things. You
don't have to, for example, run across
stage at the Sunday Night Flicks, or
serenade someone you like in front of
many people. You can, however, try
things that you don't feel will bring
certain success. Applying for tough
to-get jobs, asking questions in classes
in which nobody ever asks questions,
helping a classmate when you're both
studying for the same test and you
need the time as much as he does, etc.
Some people would say that doing
these things is a sign of stupidity.
Maybe so, but I think they're also the
signs of a gutsy, intelligent, strong
willed, confident person who is not
willing to let the opinions of others
rule his or her life.
There are people like that here; I
have been lucky enough to know a
few. They seem to emit an aura of con
fidence and positive thinking that al
ways has an uplifting effect on those
around them. It is they who are going
to live the great lives, not the ones who
spend their Stanford careers chasing
after A s or glamorous activities. While
the former will spend their lives learn
ing and enriching themselves and
others with their knowledge, the latter
will spend their lives chasing after
things that they think make them im
portant.
Remember that only you have to
live with yourself. The people here or
at home who tell you what they think
is right are not always going to be
there. There will come a time when
only you will be able to tell yourself if
you're doing the right thing. The only
way you will be able to be truthful to
yourself is if you like yourself, so why
not start now? Get to know yourself
and become your own best friend. It is
at thatpoint that you will start making
true friendships with other people.
They will be friendships based on
mutual attraction and respect, and not
on insecurity, or a desire to impress
others.
