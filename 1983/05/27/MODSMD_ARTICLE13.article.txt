# Rugged Pacific Northwest: hiking, rafting, camping
## 
### JEFFREY MALTZMAN 
Within a day's journey
north of campus lies a beau
tiful land rarely explored by
Stanfordites, the great Pcific
Northwest. This mountain
ous region begins in Sis
kiyou County, 250 miles
North of San Francisco
along Interstate Highway 5.
The Siskiyous link the Cas
cade Mountains with the
mighty Sierra Nevada to
form a dazzling, rugged
wilderness area.
This area is highlighted by
Lake Shasta and by 14,161
foot high Mt. Shasta. Lake
Shasta is an out
doorsman's haven with
over 370 miles of unspoiled
shoreline, well above that of
both Tahoe and Clear Lakes
combined.
The Lake is dotted with
both public and private
camp-grounds, but for
those wishing more privacy,
campers are welcome any
where along the lake's
shore or in the surrounding
National Forest. Wilderness
and fire permits are avail
able for a nominal fee at any
ranger station or in the
nearby towns of Shasta,
Dunsmuir and Weed.
There are several State
Parks which are quite inex
pensive, offering
campground and restroom
facilities. The numerous
private campgrounds are
slightly moreexpensive, but
generally offer shower and
recreation facilities as well.
For those wishing to sam
ple the great outdoors
without sleeping in it, there
are many lodges and inns in
the lake area. Houseboating
is also an attractive alterna
tive to camping. Houseboat
rentals range from about
$125 to $200 per day for a boat
which sleeps 10 to 12 people.
The lake offers numerous
activities including hiking,
fishing, hunting, waterski
ing, and sailing. Fishing at
Shasta can be spectacular
with trophy size bass and
trout the common catch.
The Fish and Wildlife Ser
vice reports that three are
not uncommon. The lake

also offers bluegill, salmon,
crappie, catfish and stur
geon.
The shoreline of the lake
is densely wooded and
often steep. The Forestry
Service reports that hunting
is good for bear, quail and
deer. Some elk hunting is
permitted on the North
perimeter of the lake. Con
tact the Forestry Service for
permit and season require
ments.
Mt. Shasta is a dormant
volcano featuring five live
glaciers, vast timberlands,
several perpetual snow

fields, and a hot springs at
the summit.
Further Northeast toward
Bend, Oregon, lies the Inn
of the Seventh Mountain, a
fabulous resort complex at
the foot of Mt. Bachlor. The
Inn is surrounded by the
magnificent Deschutes Na
tional Forest and the sleek
ice covered cliffs of Mt.
Bachlor.
The Inn of the Seventh
Mountain offers perhaps
the best vacation buy in the
Northwest. Spring room
rates (through mid June)
start at just $38 per night,

double occupancy. We
stayed in a fireside studio
featuring full electric
kitchen (utensils fur
nished), fireplace, color TV,
phone, private balcony,
diningroom/livingroom
area and two queen sized
beds. One bed isa "murphy
bed" and folds up into the
wall during the day to pro
vide extra space. The sec
ond bed is a standard
sofabed.
A typical week's schedule
includes arts and crafts,
canoe and whitewater raft
trips on the Deschutes

River, aerobic exercise clas
ses, guided moped tours,
tennis tournaments,
softball games, horseback
riding, and windsurfing.
Most activities are free, al
though there is a moderate
charge for horses, mopeds
and river trips.
The Inn of the Seventh
Mountain has a friendly, re
laxed atmosphere, ideal for
activity filled days, restful af
ternoons by the jacuzzi, and
romantic evenings before a
fireplace. Both the activities
and the inexpensive room
rates (starting at just $13 per

person per night) make
Seventh Mountain afforda
ble. For information and
reservations call 800-547-
5668.
An hour's drive North of
Seventh Mountain lies not
just another resort, but
another culture. Kah-nee-ta
Resort is owned and oper
ated, by the Warm Springs
Indian Reservation in Cent
ral Oregon. The resort is the
centerpiece of a 600,000
acre American Indian Res
ervation, complete with
working ranch and wild
horses. The reservation is

located on a semi-arid plane
where the sun shines over
300 days a year.
The resort is proud of its
Indian heritage. The design
and architecture are mod
ern, but reflect the reserva
tion location. Wood carv
ings in the main lodge de
pict famous Indian legends
and the lounge uses tall
wooden structural support
beams to give visitors the
feeling of being in a huge
tee-pee. The entire lodge
complex is in the shape of
an arrowhead and even the
restaurant's chandelier of
lighted pine cones furthers
the natural theme.
The lodge features
modern rooms with balcony
views overlooking the vast
reservation and the Warm
Springs River. Summer
room rates start at $49 per
night, double occupancy
(slightly higher on
weekends). Off-season
rates start at only $29 per
night. The lodge features a
huge swimming pool,
heated to 85Â°F for comforta
ble day and night swim
ming. There is also a luxury
restaurant, the Juniper
Room.
The Juniper Room fea
tures entrees in the $14 to $18
range. Although slightly ex
pensive, the restaurant is
justly famous for some of its
excellent native dishes such
as game hen baked in clay
and Indian fry bread with
huckleberry jam.
Two miles South of the
lodge is Kah-nee-ta Village
which has cottages,
campsites, and tee-pees for
guests to rent. Campsites
are $6 per night; cottages
start at $30 per night. The
village has Kah-nee-ta's fa
mous natural mineral hot
springs as well as a naturally
heated Olympic-size
swimming pool. An inex
pensive restaurant and
snack bar are also available.
