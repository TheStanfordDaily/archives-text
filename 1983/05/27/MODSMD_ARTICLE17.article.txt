# Silicon Valley: haven of hazardous waste?
## Santa Clara Co. home of 63 leaks 
### CHRISITINE WALL 
Sixty-three chemical storage
tank leaks and spills — five in
Palo Alto — have been dis
covered throughout Santa
Clara County, according to the
Regional Water Quality Con
trol Board (RWQCB). Silicon
Valley residents receive more
than 50 percent of their drink
ing water from underground
water wells, several of which
have been shut down due to
contamination.
Although 20 years ago the
electronics industry was wel
comed as being "clean," the
recently discovered leakages
have proven otherwise. The
manufacture and cleaning of
electronics industry products
creates toxic waste in the form
of acids and solvents. Some of
this waste is transported to spe
cial hazardous waste disposal
sites where it is stored.
But, a recent report by Citi
zens for a Better Environment
states that many Bay Area
facilities may not operate ac
cording to updated require
ments nor do they have
groundwater monitoring pro
grams. The report also esti
mates that as many 1.4 million
tons of hazardous waste is
treated and disposed of on-site
each year.
Underground tanks are the
most common form of storage
for these wastes. The Silicon
Valley is the home of an esti
mated 1900 of these under
ground tanks. Proper mainte
nance and monitoring of these
tanks is the major environmen
tal concern with this type of
storage.
Stanford Cleaners in Palo
Alto is the site of a solvent leak
under RWQCB investigation.
Owner Fred Fujikawa says that
he doesn't know whether it is a
leak or if it was cleaning fluid

that had "dripped" on the
floor.
Solvents also comprise a
second leak at the Fairchild
Advance Research Develop
ment Labs, Palo Alto dis
covered early in 1982. Accord
ing to the RWQCB, a remedial
action plan is being developed.

Hewlett-Packard is taking
"remedial action" — cleaning
up — the three leaks dis
covered at three of its Palo Alto
facilities.
A 300-gallon leak of waste
solvents from a 1000 gallon
underground steel tank at the
Optoelectronics Division, 640
Page Mill Rd., was discovered
"right away" in July of 1981 ac
cording to Rob Bouzon, man
ager of General Press Releases
at Hewlett-Packard. The leak is
thought to have been caused
by tank "fatigue."
The leaked toxics include
isopropyl acetates, butyl ace
tates and 2-propanol (alcohol).
Highly toxic trichloroethylene
(TCE) was also present in small
amounts.
The clean-up process con
sists of pumping out ground
water and sending it through
the plant's scrubbers where
the chemicals evaporate. The
water then goes down storm
drains.
Bouzon stated that there is
no danger of drinking water
contamination due to a clay
layer separating the leakage
area from the nearest wells.
The clay layer is at 60 feet and
the wells are at 1000 feet.
The second leak occurred at
a Hewlett-Packard Corporate
Laboratory and was discovered
in October, 1980 during a
routine inspection.
Solvents had been mis
takenly placed in a 2000 gallon
fiberglass tank meant for the
disposal of acids. Apparently,
the solvents ate through the
tank. Bouzon said that 500 to
1000 gallons "at most" had
been leaked over a period of
time.
A clay formation present at
this site prevents well con
tamination, he added.
