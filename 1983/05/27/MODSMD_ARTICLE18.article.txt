# Ordinance sets precedent
## 
### VICKI MOORE 
The underground spills and leaks found in the
Silicon Valley recently have led the Santa Clara
County Fire Chiefs Hazardous Waste Storage
Committee to draft a proposed model "Hazard
ous Waste Permit Ordinance" in order to pre
vent serious environmental and public health
damage.
The ordinance was drafted in 1982 with parti
cipation from industry, labor, public health
groups, conservation organizations and all gov
ernment levels. The ordinance has been sent to
each city in the county for approval. It has been
adopted in San Jose, Campbell, Palo Alto, and
with one modification, in Santa Clara. Other
cities are currently evaluating it for adoption. To
become law the ordinance will have to be
adopted by each city council within the county.
The main provisions of the ordinance:
• require that every occupant storing hazardous
materials, flammable liquids or any of the 22
known carcinogens listed by the California Oc
cupational Safety and Health Administration
(Cal-OSHA), must file a report with the local fire
department identifying what is being stored.
The local fire department then issues a permit,
does an inspection and distributes the informa
tion about the hazardous substance to other fire
departments so that in the event of an
emergency response, all the fire departments
will know what kinds of chemicals they must be
prepared for. "Right now we don't know what's
in many of the buildings," said James McMul
len, fire chief of the City of Campbell and presi
dent of the Santa Clara County Fire Chiefs Asso
ciation.
• require individual businesses to monitor and
keep an inventory of their chemical products.
All underground tanks must be monitored in
order to get an annual permit with the city. A
hazardous materials inventory statement is re
quired of all storers as a public document pro
viding information on hazardous material stor
age to firefighters, health officials and the gen
eral public. Exempt from public disclosure are
legitimate trade secrets and security data. Trade
secrets must be claimed under the penalty of
perjury and either given to the fire department,
stored in a locked box which the fire department
has access to, or an independent outside expert
must disclose the nature and reactivity and
health effects data of the material without giving
the trade name.
•apply uniform storage and handling standards
throughout the county for most hazardous ma
terials with certain exceptions for "small quan
tity" storage. Quantities of hazardous materials
less than 55 gallons of liquids, 500 pounds of
solids and 200 cubic feet of compressed gas are
exempt from specific disclosure. This provision
originally included small quantities of carcino
gens, but carcinogens were added to the full
disclosure list by the Inter-governmental coun
cil of Santa Clara County on May 5.

• require double containment for all new under
ground storage tanks for hazardous materials
and strict monitoring of existing tanks. If
monitoring of existing tanks indicates signifi
cant leakage, double containment could be re
quired as a condition of maintaining a permit.
Double containment consists of a thick vinyl
liner placed in a hole in the ground in which the
concrete tanks storing the hazardous wastes are
placed.
McMullen called the ordinance a "pioneer
step forward" mentioning that Santa Clara
County is the first place in the country to pos
sess such an ordinance.
However, Ted Smith, chairman of the Silicon
Valley Toxics Corporation, a public interest
group composed of labor unions, environmen
tal organizations, firefighters, and public health
workers, mentioned several serious omissions
of the ordinance. According to Smith, the list of
regulated materials should be broadened. He
said that chemicals used in the county which are
included in the new Cal-OSHA Director's List of
Hazardous Substances should be included in
defining which materials are regulated by the
ordinance. Such listed chemicals should "be
regulated unless proven safe rather than not
regulated until proven harmful," Smith said.
In addition, Smith said that the 22 carcinogens
to be regulated under the ordinance was an
incomplete listing. Two substances not in
cluded under the ordinance are 1, 1, 1
Trichloroethane (TCA) and 1 , 1, 1
Trichloroethelyene (TCE), used in the elec
tronics industry as a degreaser and an all
purpose solvent. "These are the most common
substances found in the groundwater in this
area and they have been found to be car
cinogenic or cause birth defects, but they are
not regulated," Smith said.
Smith also criticized the omission of an insur
ance requirement for industries adequate to
protect communities from damages resulting
from improper storage or handling of hazardous
materials. Smith claimed that there is insuffi
cient protection in the event a business files for
bankruptcy or simply abandons a facility after a
major accident.
Dan Heiser, fire inspector for the City of Palo
Alto, said that he hopes the ordinance will act as
a preventative measure and insurance against
hazardous waste leakage. He also said that a
required insurance provision for the ordinance
would be extremely difficult to enforce.
The ordinance is also being used as the basis
for a statewide hazardous waste storage bill,
A.B. 1362, sponsored by Assemblyman Byron
Sher (D-Palo Alto). Now being considered by
the State Assembly Ways and Means Commit
tee, the bill would enact statewide chemical
storage regulations similar to the Santa Clara
County ordinance. Petroleum industries and
the California Manufacturer's Association are
currently lobbying against the bill.
