# University initiates waste materials management plan

### TOM TROMBADORE 
The University produced an
estimated 216,000 kilograms —
432,000 pounds — of chemical
waste during 1980, only
7.3 percent of which was dis
posed of properly, according
to a 1982 Office of Health and
Safety report. The report stated
that some portions of the vol
umes unaccounted for disap
peared through sewers and
vents.
But with the development of
a hazardous materials man
agement program in 1982, the
University properly disposed
of 186,340 kilograms of chemi

versity has continued to de
velop a hazardous materials
management program.
Hazardous materials regu
lated by law fall into three
categories: infectious, chemi
cal or radioactive substances,
which are handled in many
areas of the University, includ
ing the Medical Center and re
search laboratories as well as
art studios and operations and
maintenance shops. Consider
ing the nearly übiquitous pre
sence of hazardous materials
here, their mismanagement
increases the risk of exposure

cal wastes, according to the
1982 Annual Report to the
California Department of
Health and Services.
State regulations requiring
the proper disposal of hazard
ous wastes were promulgated
in the mid-'7os. In response to
these regulations the Health
Physics Department instituted
a limited hazardous waste col
lection program. At that time,
each department was individu
ally responsible for the man
agement of hazardous wastes.
In 1980 the Resources Conser
vation and Recovery Act regu
lations required more strin
gent controls of hazardous
wastes. Accordingly, the Uni
versity implemented a
campus-wide pick-up and dis
posal program, maintained by
the Department of Health and
Safety. The Health Physics de
partment is responsible for the
disposal of radioactive waste.
At present, the Health and
Safety and Health Physics of
fices have coordinated efforts
to pick up hazardous wastes
from University departments
and to transport them to an
interim facility where they are
packaged for off-site treatment
and disposal by private waste
contractors.
Because of the growing
complexity of governmental
regulations, the rising costs of
correct hazardous materials
management and the need to

to many people who work and
live in the Stanford commu
nity.
According to Dr. Alain De
cleve, director of the Health
and Safety Office, the purpose
of the hazardous materials
management program is "to
protect the health and safety of
the Stanford community, the
environment and to comply
with a myriad of regulations
from all levels of government."

The first part of the man
agement program consists of
"front end" controls on the
procurement of materials,
mostly chemicals. At present,
each University department is
responsible for obtaining their
own materials.
In the past, some depart
ments have attempted to rem
edy the problems of obtaining
chemicals by creating de
partmental stores. But Decleve
and Paul Andre, Stanford Fire
Marshal, confirmed that some
of these facilities fall short of
safety standards. A University
safety inspection team noted
that the Chemistry Department

stored flammable chemicals
with other incompatibles in the
basement store of the Old
Chemistry Building. "This,"
Decleve said, "is a safety
hazard." Other safety hazards
noted by the team included
lack of adequate spill control
systems and lack of a fire con
trol system.
Other facilities have been
cited for similar violations. For
example, Decleve said that in
dividual laboratories tend to
overstock their shelves with
chemicals because of the time
and money involved in buying
smaller amounts of chemicals
as needed. In addition, since
most laboratories lack the
necessary storage space for the
resulting quantities of chemi
cals, many chemicals are
stored unsafely in overhead
compartments and/or together
with other incompatible chem
icals, according to Decleve.
Chemicals are sometimes dis
posed of before ever having
been used in order to accomo
date new stocks of chemicals
or because they are too old to
use.
The Health and Safety Office
will propose a University-wide
stores system. In this proposal,
the University Procurement
department would buy stocks
of laboratory materials —
mostly chemicals and some
general laboratory supplies —
and store them in a central

Many obstacles delay the implementation of
a responsible waste management program
here, the most serious of which is a lack of
public understanding about the problem.

storage facility. These materi
als would be supplied to the
satellite stores as needed. The
entire system would be linked
to departments and facilities by
a central computer which
would expediate the some
times burdensome ordering
process.
A centralized stores system
has several advantages over a
departmental stores system,
according to Decleve. An effi
cient University-wide pro
curement scheme eliminates
the need to overstock facilities
with hazardous materials by
making those materials readily
available to laboratories as

needed. It also "frees up" in
house laboratory space that
could be used for other more
productive purposes and elim
inates disposal of unused
chemicals. Any chemicals not
used could easily be recycled
back through the University's
stores. Such a system also im
proves the University's ac
countability for hazardous ma
terials, an important part of
managing for public safety. In
addition, some chemical com
panies are utilizing similar on
line ordering systems. Thus, if
the University could not im
mediately supply the needs of
an individual laboratory, an
order could be placed directly
to the supplier through the
University computer system.
The supplier could then route
the order directly to the labora
tory.
The second part of the man
agement scheme consists of
controls on the use of hazard
ous materials. This program in
cludes training the people who
handle hazardous materials,
monitoring facilities and estab
lishing emergency response
procedures.
Controls on the disposal of
hazardous waste constitute the
third part of the program.
Hazardous wastes are to be
identified, segregated and
stored in the facilities where
they are generated. In some
cases, simple treatment would
permit disposal directly from
within each generating facility.
Otherwise, upon notification,
either the Health and Safety or
the Health Physics Office will
transport the hazardous wastes
to a central facility, the En
vironmental Safety Facilty
(ESF). "Special care and safety
measures are being taken to
insure safe transportation of
the materials by trained per
sons," Decleve said. Accord
ing to the Health and Safety Of
fice, the University plans to
construct this facility on the
west side of the campus near
the Medical Center and sci
ence buildings, the largest
generators of hazardous
wastes. The specific site has
not yet been selected. At the
ESF hazardous wastes will be
either detoxified below
hazardous levels and then dis
posed as non-hazardous waste
according to regulations

(through the Palo Alto munici
pal sewer system or to the
municipal landfill), or stored at
the ESF for short periods of
time before shipment to offsite
treatment and/or landfill dis
posal sites by private contrac
tors.
Many obstacles delay the
implementation of a responsi
ble hazardous waste manage
ment program here, the most
serious of which is a "lack of
general public understanding
of the problem," said lennifer

Gates, health and safety spe
cialist. Although faculty, staff
and students sometimes know
that exposure of particular
hazardous materials may cause
potentially lethal effects, most
"are reluctant to learn and
practice the correct handling
and disposal procedures that
will minimize these risks,"
Gates added.
The Health and Safety Office
has initiated some basic train
ing programs for research and
support staff. However, De

cleve said he hoped that in the
future, students, faculty and
support staff who participate in
activities involving hazardous
materials will enroll in com
prehensive training programs
which address the risks and
correct handling and disposal
techniques of hazardous mate
rials.
According to Decleve, the
final draft of the hazardous ma
terials management plan will
be presented to the Board of
Trustees this fall.
