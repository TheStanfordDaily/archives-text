# Kennedy discusses Hoover on KZSU

### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
The best possible outcome of the
Hoover Institution controversy
would be "increased understanding
and strengthening of the ties (be
tween the Institution and the Univer
sity)," University President Donald
Kennedy said yesterday during a
KZSU talk show.
Kennedy, interviewed by KZSU
and Daily reporters on Campus Con
ference, said he would be "very dis
appointed if the result (of an inquiry)
was a distancing" of the Institution
from the University. He said the
Hoover Library and Archives were an
"extraordinary asset" and that joint
appointments to the Institution and
University departments were benefi
cial to the University.
"It (the Institution) is an asset, but
like some other assets it is difficult to
manage at times," he said.
On the subject of high tenure rates
and the increasing average age of
faculty here, Kennedy said the situa
tion limited the University's "flexibil
ity," making it more difficult to ap
point young faculty members and to
increase the representation of
minority groups and women on the
faculty.
"When the average age of the fac
ulty raises three years in a decade,
you can't help but view that as an
alarming trend," he said. He also
lamented the fact that nearly 80 per
cent of the faculty in the School of
Humanities and Sciences are te
nured.
Kennedy suggested two solutions
to the problems. He said fundraising
efforts had been directed toward in
creasing the openings available to
junior faculty members. He also
suggested improving incentives for
early retirement.
Kennedy also called a recent na
tional trend toward offering merit
based scholarships to under
graduates "pernicious."
"I think it is a very bad policy
(which is) used largely by institutions
that are not quite so competitive in
other terms," he said. According to
Kennedy, there is no similarity be
tween merit-based scholarships and
non-need-based athletic schol
arships.
He said the University has often
recommended without success that
the NCAA give athletic aid on a need
basis. However, if a competitive ath
letic program is to be maintained, the
University is "stuck with the situa
tion," he said.
On financial aid in general, Ken
nedy said the aid received by an av
erage senior is roughly equivalent to
the aid which the senior received as a
freshman. However, because there
has been a "higher increase in tuition
than in family disposable income,"
he said an attempt would be made to
channel more donations into finan
cial aid funds.
Referring to fundraising succes
ses, Kennedy reaffirmed the Univer
sity's commitment to aid-blind ad
missions. "I feel comfortable about
maintaining a strong institutional
commitment to aid-blind admis
sions," he said.
Turning to University grading pol
icy, Kennedy said, "There has been
grade inflation if by that you mean
Stanford grades on average are
higher than they were 15 or 20 years
ago. (But) we are not at the peak of
that. I think the peak was reached
some time ago."
Kennedy said the problem of grade
inflation is "faced by all the institu
tions with which we are regularly
compared." He said a statistical re
port on grading in each of the Uni
versity schools was released only to
the deans of the schools because
deans "wish to work on it (grade in
flation) by persuasion," rather than
through pressure from competition
between the schools.
Kennedy referred to the planned
Center for Integrated Systems, a
multi-million dollar project jointly
sponsored by the University, indus
try and government, as a "unique in
stitutional experiment to try to get
some of the advantages of industry
university collaboration without
some of the problems."
He said that currently individual
professors' "involvement in off
campus ventures tends to pick apart
the unity between graduate training
and research."
Kennedy said collaborative ven
tures could offer a solution to the
"conflict of interest with respect to
their university roles and their entre
preneurial roles." He stressed the
fact that only 5.5 percent of the Uni
versity's research budget is covered
by industry money. The rest comes
from public funds.
The interview was recorded and
will be aired on KZSU (AM 90.1) at 7
p.m. Monday.

the NCAA give athletic aid on a need
basis. However, if a competitive ath
letic program is to be maintained, the
University is "stuck with the situa
tion," he said.
On financial aid in general, Ken
nedy said the aid received by an av
erage senior is roughly equivalent to
the aid which the senior received as a
freshman. However, because there
has been a "higher increase in tuition
than in family disposable income,"
he said an attempt would be made to
channel more donations into finan
cial aid funds.
Referring to fundraising succes
ses, Kennedy reaffirmed the Univer
sity's commitment to aid-blind ad
missions. "I feel comfortable about
maintaining a strong institutional
commitment to aid-blind admis
sions," he said.
Turning to University grading pol
icy, Kennedy said, "There has been
grade inflation if by that you mean
Stanford grades on average are
higher than they were 15 or 20 years
ago. (But) we are not at the peak of
that. I think the peak was reached
some time ago."
Kennedy said the problem of grade
inflation is "faced by all the institu
tions with which we are regularly
compared." He said a statistical re
port on grading in each of the Uni
versity schools was released only to
the deans of the schools because
deans "wish to work on it (grade in
flation) by persuasion," rather than
through pressure from competition
between the schools.
Kennedy referred to the planned
Center for Integrated Systems, a
multi-million dollar project jointly
sponsored by the University, indus
try and government, as a "unique in
stitutional experiment to try to get
some of the advantages of industry
university collaboration without
some of the problems."
He said that currently individual
professors' "involvement in off
campus ventures tends to pick apart
the unity between graduate training
and research."
Kennedy said collaborative ven
tures could offer a solution to the
"conflict of interest with respect to
their university roles and their entre
preneurial roles." He stressed the
fact that only 5.5 percent of the Uni
versity's research budget is covered
by industry money. The rest comes
from public funds.
The interview was recorded and
will be aired on KZSU (AM 90.1) at 7
p.m. Monday.
