The best possible outcome of the
Hoover Institution controversy
would be "increased understanding
and strengthening of the ties (be
tween the Institution and the Univer
sity)," University President Donald
Kennedy said yesterday during a
KZSU talk show.
Kennedy, interviewed by KZSU
and Daily reporters on Campus Con
ference, said he would be "very dis
appointed if the result (of an inquiry)
was a distancing" of the Institution
from the University. He said the
Hoover Library and Archives were an
"extraordinary asset" and that joint
appointments to the Institution and
University departments were benefi
cial to the University.
"It (the Institution) is an asset, but
like some other assets it is difficult to
manage at times," he said.
On the subject of high tenure rates
and the increasing average age of
faculty here, Kennedy said the situa
tion limited the University's "flexibil
ity," making it more difficult to ap
point young faculty members and to
increase the representation of
minority groups and women on the
faculty.
"When the average age of the fac
ulty raises three years in a decade,
you can't help but view that as an
alarming trend," he said. He also
lamented the fact that nearly 80 per
cent of the faculty in the School of
Humanities and Sciences are te
nured.
Kennedy suggested two solutions
to the problems. He said fundraising
efforts had been directed toward in
creasing the openings available to
junior faculty members. He also
suggested improving incentives for
early retirement.
Kennedy also called a recent na
tional trend toward offering merit
based scholarships to under
graduates "pernicious."
"I think it is a very bad policy
(which is) used largely by institutions
that are not quite so competitive in
other terms," he said. According to
Kennedy, there is no similarity be
tween merit-based scholarships and
non-need-based athletic schol
arships.
He said the University has often
recommended without success that
the NCAA give athletic aid on a need
basis. However, if a competitive ath
letic program is to be maintained, the
University is "stuck with the situa
tion," he said.
On financial aid in general, Ken
nedy said the aid received by an av
erage senior is roughly equivalent to
the aid which the senior received as a
