gTnose of you appreciate seafood, but care
ne about where you eat it, will probably
nd this restaurant quite agreeable. The av-
whale, for example, would love it
|§e. But most of us, I trust, do not spend
|ur time inhaling plankton whenever the
Spy strikes us, and instead dine out expect-
Hmore than fine food. To be frank, Scott's
I almost totally devoid of anything one
:oUld call "atmosphere," and it was primar-
Mfor that reason that we found it a mite
feappointing.
iA shame too, because when we arrived,
DOr expectations were quite high. For one,
Efey have aclassy ad in the Yellow Pages, but

besides that, as you pass over the Bayshore
Freeway, Scott's is quite an impressive sight
— a striking blue and white building in a
quaint New England design. It's such a size
able place, however, that the two enormous
dining rooms inside create something of a
"warehouse" effect.
When we first took our seats, I was im
mediately struck by memories of my high
school cafeteria, such an unsettling sensa
tion that I politely requested we be moved
elsewhere. Our charming, if disgruntled,
hostess then led us to a dimly lit corner,
which was a vast improvement, albeit in full
view of the service area. It was at this point
that we resigned ourselves to the fact that
there were few, if any, good seats in the
entire restaurant.
For one, the seats are, if not in full view, at
least within earshot of all the other custom
ers. The only barrier between the dining
area and work stations is a four-foot high
partition, and our table was entertained

throughout the evening by the young staff
motioning at customers and then turning to
discuss them quietly, while other patrons
were at the very least treated to the constant
clattering of plates and the soft gush of the
water dispenser.
Well, I could go on, but at this point it's
perhaps merciful to mention the food,
which compensated for what our visit to
Scott's lacked otherwise. The Bay Shrimp
Cocktail ($4.50), for instance, is a first-rate
version of what can so easily be a generic
appetizer elsewhere. We were rewarded for
our mundane choice with a profusion of
tiny, bay shrimp, nestled on a bed of lettuce
and nicely complimented by the house's
own sauce.
This was the first time that I had eaten
shrimp to the strains of Musical Youth's
"Pass the Duchie", a fair representation of
the top-40 melodies that floated out of the
public address system for the duration of the
evening. (Our main course was accom

panied by the Stray Cats, but I successfully
stifled the urge to get up and dance around
the tables.)
The Fried Calamari ($9.25) (in laymen's
terms: squid), tossed with lemon, garlic,
wine, parsley and butter, was a refreshing
change from the more-heavily breaded ver
sions I've sampled elsewhere. It was also a
colossal serving, and I may have succeeded
in finishing it off had I not been sidetracked
by the accompanying (and equally volumin
ous serving of) saffron rice.
The Seafood Saute ($13.95), like Stanford
football teams of late, looked great on paper
but didn't quite live up to the billing. Though
the crab legs, scallops and prawns were
pleasant enough, the sauce (shallots, garlic,
lemon, butter and wine) was uninspiring.
Faced with mounds of saffron rice, my com
panion also found her digestive capacity fell
short of that expected.

Not so much so, however, that we tould
resist the call of the dessert menu, and in
particular, Strawberries Romanoff, a gener
ous sampling of fruit drowned in sourcream
wickedly laced with Triple Sec and Grand
Marnier, and topped with brown sugar.
Without a doubt, this is a dish designed to
revive even the most deflated appetites.
In all, Scott's may be better suited for
lunch, when atmosphere isn't so vital and
the trappings are more commensurate with
the food (and the prices.) In my eyes, sailing
prints and captain's chairs alone do not
create ambiance. (No matter how good the
beef is, Filet Mignon at Denny's just isn't
going to impress anyone.) So come here
around midday, or better yet, collect some
of your friends from back home and head
down Embarcadero for a high school re
union, where the food may be better, but
the cafeteria lives on.
