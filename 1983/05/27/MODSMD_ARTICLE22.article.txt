proceed to the 37th College World Series
June 3-12 in Omaha, Neb
University president Donald Kennedy will
throw out the first ball at the UC-Santa Bar
bara and San Diego State opener.
In a vintage replay of pleasant memories
for Stanford and nightmares for Oregon
State, the two squads will meet in today's 4
p.m. contest. Stanford used the Beavers as a
stepping stone last year to the Western Re
gional at Fresno and eventually to the Col
lege World Series in Omaha, Neb. with 15-6
and 15-4 blowouts.
Here is a look at the teams for today's
Western Region I Tournament.

Stanford (37-15-1 overall, 20-10
6-Pac)
The mothballed cliche that baseball teams
are built up the middle had Marquess a little
wary after last year's world series appear
ance.
The Cardinal left 1982 with gaping holes at
catcher, second base, shortstop and center
field, but the only holes some young players
saw were ones that led to opportunity.
Freshman Mark Davis replaced the red
shirted Darryl Stephens in center field and
disappointed no one. Davis played in every
game this season, batted .330 and made 85
putouts without an error.
A couple of sophomores — John Verducci
and Pete Stanicek — moved up as a unit to
form the keystone combination and not only
played admirably in the field — combining
for only 20 errors — but freed the erstwhile
utility infielder Vince Sakowski to play third
base. That, in turn, freed Greg Lorenzetti to
play right field.
Rick Lundblade (.295, 39 RBI and eight
home runs) and Lyle Smith, just one error,
have alternated at the catcher position by
situation.
With the problems solved, veterans like
Hardgrave (.371, 75 RBI and 22 homers) and
Mike Aldrete (.379, 58 RBI, 12 homers) could
provide the fireworks.
Sakowski pitched in with a .341 average, 37
RBI and a team-high 15 doubles while
Stanicek batted .293 and stole 26 bases.
Brian Myers (9-4, 3.18 ERA) and Steve Cot
trell (8-2, 4.28 ERA) have been the most con
sistent starters.
Jeff Radtke (2-2, 3.09), Kevin Kunkel (6-3,
4.21 ERA) and David Harris (2-2, 7.57 ERA)
have both started and relieved this season.
Jeff Ballard has been the fireman with a 7-2
mark out of the bullpen and a conference
high six saves.
Stanford is ranked No. 7 by both major
baseball polls.
UC-Santa Barbara (42-20, 20-10
SCBA)
It has been 11 years since the Cauchos
have been involved in post-season NCAA
action and they have Cal State-Fullerton to
thank for that.
But a little bit of redemption came May 18
when they dumped that same Fullerton team
6-4 for the championship of the Southern
California Baseball Association.
Being somewhat of an anomaly in college
baseball, Santa Barbara puts their chips be
hind the pitching staff and not the hitters.
Lefty Dan Vokubaitis has been the work
horse starter with a 14-3 record and a 2.90
ERA — good enough for a spot on the first
team all-SCBA squad.

Mike Fulmer has compiled a 7-1 mark as
another left-handed starter while Brad Kin
ney, the most consistent right-handed star
ter, is 4-4.
Frank Spear (4-1, 1.77 ERA) and Barry
Dacus (2-1, 2.36 ERA) have provided the re
lief.
Dan Clark, the SCBA's co-MVP, leads the
offense with a .351 average, 11 home runs
and 44 RBI. Kent Mcßride, who hit the
three-run, game-winning double against
Fullerton, is batting .325, while Todd Good
man is right behind at .322 and Paul Smith is
at .313.
The Gauchos are ranked No. 12 by Col
legiate Baseball.
San Diego State (61-13, 21-3 WAC)
A couple of baseball polls confuse the
matter, but the Aztecs are rated no lower
than ninth best in the nation. In fact,
Baseball America rates them as the nation's
best team — their highest baseball rank ever
and certainly good enough to make them a
tournament favorite.
The Aztecs have won 45 of their last 49
games and, at one point, won a school
record 24 in a row.
Kerwin Danley, with a .402 average and 59
RBI, led the heavy-hitting Aztecs to an aver
age of 8.5 runs per game. Danley has not
been held hitless in two consecutive games
all year and was a unanimous All-WAC selec
tion.
Chris Cannizzaro, son of former major
league catcher Chris Cannizzaro, Sr., has

improved after landing a spot on the Third
Team All-America last season.
Cannizzaro is batting . 373 with 60 RBI and
has also stolen 39 bases. He tailed to reach
base only once all year.
Sophomore first baseman Terry Jones bat
ted .399 and rapped out a school record 23
doubles.
Bill Blount has led the starting rotation
with a 12-2 record and a 2.92 ERA. Freshman
Scott Kannenberg (5-0) and Dennis Smith
(6-3) have also been consistent starters.
Bill Blount is 12-2 as both a starter and
reliever while Kevin Piper (8-0) and )ason
Glover (6-0) are undefeated out of the
bullpen.
Oregon State (27-15, 17-7 Nor-Pac)
The Beavers will be aiming at the Cardinal
today after last year's debacle and Oregon
State has proven it can get what it wants. The
Beavers needed to win nine in a row for the
conference crown and they did, while Wash
ington State ended 2-6 to fall into second.
Despite their miraculous bid for a region
berth, Beaver coach lack Riley said he thinks
it "stinks" that they must face a team from
the Pac-10 in the first round, but he added,
"You have to play the best to advance any
way, so you might as well start with one of
them (Stanford) right away."
The pitching staff is led by Jeff Reece (11-2,
2.60 ERA) who will probably start today.
Centerfielder Todd Thomas (.375, 33 RBI),
leftfielder Steve Smith (.350, 12 homers, 37
RBI) and first baseman Chris Newman (.310,
11 homers, 37 RBI) have led the offense.

are built up the middle had Marquess a little
wary after last year's world series appear
ance.
The Cardinal left 1982 with gaping holes at
catcher, second base, shortstop and center
field, but the only holes some young players
saw were ones that led to opportunity.
Freshman Mark Davis replaced the red
shirted Darryl Stephens in center field and
disappointed no one. Davis played in every
game this season, batted .330 and made 85
putouts without an error.
A couple of sophomores — John Verducci
and Pete Stanicek — moved up as a unit to
form the keystone combination and not only
played admirably in the field — combining
for only 20 errors — but freed the erstwhile
utility infielder Vince Sakowski to play third
base. That, in turn, freed Greg Lorenzetti to
play right field.
Rick Lundblade (.295, 39 RBI and eight
home runs) and Lyle Smith, just one error,
have alternated at the catcher position by
situation.
With the problems solved, veterans like
Hardgrave (.371, 75 RBI and 22 homers) and
Mike Aldrete (.379, 58 RBI, 12 homers) could
provide the fireworks.
Sakowski pitched in with a .341 average, 37
RBI and a team-high 15 doubles while
Stanicek batted .293 and stole 26 bases.
Brian Myers (9-4, 3.18 ERA) and Steve Cot
trell (8-2, 4.28 ERA) have been the most con
sistent starters.
Jeff Radtke (2-2, 3.09), Kevin Kunkel (6-3,
4.21 ERA) and David Harris (2-2, 7.57 ERA)
have both started and relieved this season.
Jeff Ballard has been the fireman with a 7-2
mark out of the bullpen and a conference
high six saves.
Stanford is ranked No. 7 by both major
baseball polls.
UC-Santa Barbara (42-20, 20-10
SCBA)
It has been 11 years since the Cauchos
have been involved in post-season NCAA
action and they have Cal State-Fullerton to
thank for that.
But a little bit of redemption came May 18
when they dumped that same Fullerton team
6-4 for the championship of the Southern
California Baseball Association.
Being somewhat of an anomaly in college
baseball, Santa Barbara puts their chips be
hind the pitching staff and not the hitters.
Lefty Dan Vokubaitis has been the work
horse starter with a 14-3 record and a 2.90
ERA — good enough for a spot on the first
team all-SCBA squad.

Mike Fulmer has compiled a 7-1 mark as
another left-handed starter while Brad Kin
ney, the most consistent right-handed star
ter, is 4-4.
Frank Spear (4-1, 1.77 ERA) and Barry
Dacus (2-1, 2.36 ERA) have provided the re
lief.
Dan Clark, the SCBA's co-MVP, leads the
offense with a .351 average, 11 home runs
and 44 RBI. Kent Mcßride, who hit the
three-run, game-winning double against
Fullerton, is batting .325, while Todd Good
man is right behind at .322 and Paul Smith is
at .313.
The Gauchos are ranked No. 12 by Col
legiate Baseball.
San Diego State (61-13, 21-3 WAC)
A couple of baseball polls confuse the
matter, but the Aztecs are rated no lower
than ninth best in the nation. In fact,
Baseball America rates them as the nation's
best team — their highest baseball rank ever
and certainly good enough to make them a
tournament favorite.
The Aztecs have won 45 of their last 49
games and, at one point, won a school
record 24 in a row.
Kerwin Danley, with a .402 average and 59
RBI, led the heavy-hitting Aztecs to an aver
age of 8.5 runs per game. Danley has not
been held hitless in two consecutive games
all year and was a unanimous All-WAC selec
tion.
Chris Cannizzaro, son of former major
league catcher Chris Cannizzaro, Sr., has

improved after landing a spot on the Third
Team All-America last season.
Cannizzaro is batting . 373 with 60 RBI and
has also stolen 39 bases. He tailed to reach
base only once all year.
Sophomore first baseman Terry Jones bat
ted .399 and rapped out a school record 23
doubles.
Bill Blount has led the starting rotation
with a 12-2 record and a 2.92 ERA. Freshman
Scott Kannenberg (5-0) and Dennis Smith
(6-3) have also been consistent starters.
Bill Blount is 12-2 as both a starter and
reliever while Kevin Piper (8-0) and )ason
Glover (6-0) are undefeated out of the
bullpen.
Oregon State (27-15, 17-7 Nor-Pac)
The Beavers will be aiming at the Cardinal
today after last year's debacle and Oregon
State has proven it can get what it wants. The
Beavers needed to win nine in a row for the
conference crown and they did, while Wash
ington State ended 2-6 to fall into second.
Despite their miraculous bid for a region
berth, Beaver coach lack Riley said he thinks
it "stinks" that they must face a team from
the Pac-10 in the first round, but he added,
"You have to play the best to advance any
way, so you might as well start with one of
them (Stanford) right away."
The pitching staff is led by Jeff Reece (11-2,
2.60 ERA) who will probably start today.
Centerfielder Todd Thomas (.375, 33 RBI),
leftfielder Steve Smith (.350, 12 homers, 37
RBI) and first baseman Chris Newman (.310,
11 homers, 37 RBI) have led the offense.
