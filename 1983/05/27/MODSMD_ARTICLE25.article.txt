W6ers take 2-0 lead
s9Philadelphia — The Philadelphia
76ers, with star center Moses
Malone missing most of the fourth
quarter because of foul trouble, held
off the Los Angeles Lakers for a
103-93 victory last night and a 2-0
lead in the National Basketball As
sociation championship series.
With Malone, who led the 76ers
with 24 points, missing all but the
first two and last two minutes of the
fourth period with five fouls, the
Lakers went almost exclusively to
center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and he
scored 10 of his 23 points in the peri
od. But the strategy backfired as the
Lakers totaled only 18 points in the
quarter.
Games 3 and 4 of the best-of-sev
en series will be in Los Angeles Sun
day and Tuesday.
The Lakers, who beat the 76ers in
thefinalsin 1980and lastyearandare
seeking to become the first team to
repeat as champions in 14years, now
face a difficult task to accomplish
that feat.
Only two teams in NBA history
have rallied from a 2-0 deficit to win

a championship series. The 1969 Bos
ton Celtics, the last team to suc
cessfully defend the NBA title, came
back to beat Los Angeles after losing
the first two, while Portland pulled
off the same comeback against Phila
delphia in 1977.
The 76ers haven't won a cham
pionship since 1967, although this is
their fourth trip to the finals since
the 1977 Portland defeat.
In addition to Malone, Andrew
Toney and Maurice Cheeks each
scored 19 points and Bobby Jones
and Julius Erving 14 apiece for the
76ers.
Giants cool Dodgers
Los Angeles — Jeff Leonard
slugged two home runs and Jack
Clark added a solo shot to powerthe
San FranciscoGiantstoas-3triumph
over Los Angeles last night, snapping
the Dodgers' four-game winning
streak.
Rick Monday hit two home runs
for Los Angeles, his first homers of
the season.
Bill Laskey, 6-4, earned his sixth
straight victory, but needed relief
help in the eighth from Greg Mint
on, who posted his sixth save. Jerry
Reuss, 5-3, took the loss.
McEnroe 'bad' at Open
Paris — John McEnroe continued
both his winning ways and his tem
pestuous behavior at the French

Open yesterday, cruising past Alber
to Tous of Spain 6-3, 7-6, 6-3, and de
manding the removal of an umpire
after long arguments with both the
official and a tournament supervisor.
It was the second day of troubles
for McEnroe, who on Wednesday
had been fined for his antics during a
first round match in which he
shouted obscenities at a linesman
and kicked a photographer's cam
era.
This time, after questioning a
number of line calls, he said he
wanted the umpire changed, appeal
ing to a supervisor.
McEnroe argued at length over a
line call in the second set and French
umpire Patrick Flodstrop told him to
get on with the match.
Crenshaw beats slump
Dublin, Ohio — Ben Crenshaw,
on the way back from a long, puzzl
ing slump, and Lanny Wadkins, on
the way to the best season of his ca
reer, matched 5-under-par 67s and
tied for the first-round lead yester
day in the $400,000 Memorial Tour
nament.
"Life seems rosy again," said
Crenshaw, who ended a year of frus
tration, experimentation and a
three-season victory drought with
his triumph in Dallas early this
month.
Both the leaders noted that the
cool weather and near-perfect con

ditions on Jack Nicklaus' Muirfield
Village Golf Club course helped pro
duce relatively low scores.
Nicklaus, host, sponsor and course
designer, struggled to a 76, including
a 40 on the back nine, and must im
prove if he is to qualify for the final
two rounds Saturday and Sunday.
Indy 500 set for Sunday
Indianapolis — Teo Fabi has no
more worries about driving atthe In
dianapolis Motor Speedway. Now,
after a final show of speed yesterday,
the worries may belong to the other
drivers who will try to catch him in
Sunday's Indy 500.
The Italian road-racing veteran,
who established new one-and four
lap speed records in winning the
pole position for the 67th Indy clas
sic, again found the quickest way
around the 2V2-mile oval yesterday
during "carburetion testing," the
last opportunity for the starters to
get on the track prior to Sunday's
race.
Fabi's Cosworth-powered March
made three successive laps at more
than 201 mph, the fastest caught by
the Speedway's electric timer at
201.795.
All 33 starters made it onto the
track during the two-hour session
and all but six of them posted laps
averaging more than 190 mph.
