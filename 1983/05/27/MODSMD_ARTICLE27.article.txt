Fox, Redwood City
The high-tech chic of this
picture, directed by Jean-Jac
ques Beinixand shot by Philippe
Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles
of a movie. Beinix's chief virtue,
aside from his dexterity, is his
determination not to take
himself seriously: the witty,
freewheeling way in which he
has put the picture together,
making his camera double back
on itself with tantalizing self
consciousness, seems to be
based on the careless assump
tion that this little thriller about
stolen tapes is inconsequential.
You can't complain that Diva
doesn't mean anything, be
cause Beinix's style and the
weightless, hollow shimmer of
Hilton McConnico's interior

designs declare it in every
frame. With Frederic Andrei,
who recalls the Jean-Pierre
Leaud of the middle and late
'60s; Thuy An Luu, who has the
unflappable cool of a Godard
gamine; and the black singer
Wilhelminia Wiggins
Fernandez. Beinix and Jean Van
Hamme adapted a novel by De
lacorta, and Vladimir Cosma
supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with La Cage aux Folles 11.

Murder by Death (1976)
Kresge Auditorium
The idea sounds promising
enough: a collection of detec
tives, each a parody of a famous
fictive sleuth, gathers at the
home of a rich eccentric and, a 6
in And Then There Were None,
people are eliminated one by
one. But the screenplay is by
Neil Simon, who — to put it as
kindly as possible — has no gift
for parody, and the director,
Robert Moore, doesn't help
matters. (Neither does the
clumsy editing.) The result is
fairly stupid and certainly lack
ing in delicacy, despie the all
star cast: Peter Falk (spoofing
Sam Spade), Elsa Lanchester
(Miss Marple), Peter Sellers
(Charlie Chan), David Niven
(Nick Charles), Maggie Smith
(Nora Charles), James Coco
(Hercule Poirot), and Eileen
Brennan, Alec Guinness, Nancy
Walker, Estelle Winwood, and
Truman Capote as the eccen
tric. Falk and Smith each have a
few reasonably funny mo
ments.
Plays tomorrow evening.

Guess Who's Coming to
Dinner (1967)
Kresge Auditorium
Hole-in-the-head white lib
eral hogwash. Spencer Tracy
and Katharine Hepburn play
the parents of a young woman
(Katharine Houghton, Hep
burn's real-life niece) who re
turns home engaged to a black
man (Sidney Poitier). The point
seems to be that it's not a bad
strategy to marry a black man
providing he looks like Sidney
Poitier, is a highly successful
doctor and a humanitarian (he
works for the World Health Or
ganization), and possesses no
sexual drive. (We are told that,
at his suggestion, the couple
plans to remain celibate until
marriage.) Though the movie is
ostensibly dedicated to youth
— Tracy has an interminable
curtain speech in which he
urges the young to change the
world — most of the glimpses
we get of America's youth are
pretty dismaying: they all
grumble and listen to loud radi
os, except for Houghton, who is
a grinning ninny. (Poitier
doesn't really rank in the youth
department.) Tracy gives a thor
oughly dull, pedantic per
formance — it's a pity it was his
last — while Hepburn weeps
and weeps. (She won an
Academy Award for it.) Sidney
Poitier is a wonderful actor, but
who could survive this turkey
unscathed? At least he manages
one movingly acted scene with
his father, played by Roy E.
Glenn Sr. Stanley Kramer
(direction) and William Rose
(screenplay) share the blame
for this offense.
Plays tonight.
An Officer and a Gentleman
Memorial Auditorium
Douglas Day Stewart's
screenplay treats the
metamorphosis of a selfish
loner, Zack Mayo (Richard
Gere), in the course of a naval
officer training program in
Seattle. It's lucky for the movie
that Debra Winger plays Zack's
girl friend, David Keith his best
buddy, and Lou Gossett the drill
instructor, because they all
work hard to persuade au
diences that what they're
seeing is fresh. It isn't; what lies
beneath the film's warm, lively
surface is nothing but old mov
ies. Worth seeing chiefly for
Debra Winger's authentic per
formance, which furnishes a
striking contrast to Richard
Gere's slick actorishness.
Plays Sunday evening.

Gone with the Wind (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto *
David O. Selznick's biggest
movie, written mostly by Ben
Hecht (though Sidney Howard
got the credit and the post
humous Oscar) and directed by
Victor Fleming (though George
Cukor started it). "Big" is not
the same as "great", but this
four-hour adaptation of the
Margaret Mitchell bestseller is
hugely entertaining, especially
when Clark Gable or Butterfly
McQueen is on the screen. And
it does have one performance
that should be called great: Vi
vien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett
O'Hara. With Leslie Howard,
Olivia De Havilland, Thomas
Mitchell, Hattie McDaniel and
many others.
Plays through Wednesday.
It's a Wonderful Life (1946)
Fox, Redwood City
James Stewart plays a small
town joe who has spent years
putting other people's interests
before his own; when his life
begins to fall apart and he con
templates suidice, an angel
(Henry Travers) shows him what
life would have been like for
those closest to him had he nev
er existed. This comedy-drama
is the most eloauent expression
of the populist philosophy
Frank Capra infused his films
with. It's superbly crafted, and
two or three scenes are too
powerful to shake off — Capra
could be an amazing director,
and he knew exactly what he
was doing here. But his vision is
so fraudulent that your tears
may freeze into outrage when
you consider the effect of the
movie. Much of the film's suc
cess as a piece of manipulation
is due to Stewart, whose
earnestness has never been af
fecting in quite this way; his in
tensity is frightening — in the
scene in which he cries out to
his girl, Donna Reed (who is
very good), that he feels
trapped in the town, you can
really see the potential for ner
vous collapse and suicide. The
supporting cast includes the
unconvincing Lionel Bar
rymore, Thomas Mitchell,
Beulah Bondi, Frank Faylen,
Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame,
H.B. Warner and Frank Alber
tson. Capra worked on the
script with Frances Goodrich
and Albert Hackett, and Joseph
Walker and Joseph Biroc col
laborated on the (fine)
cinematography.
Plays Monday with Casablan

An American Werewolf in
London (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Landis' movies are so
cheerfully adolescent that one
can't take them seriously. He
lacks the inventiveness and the
technique to transform his
sophomoric jokes into comic
fantasy, but his buoyant silliness
energizes his pictures, and he
doesn't trash his actors. The two
young stars of this comedy
thriller, David Naughton and
Griffin Dunne, have pleasing
screen presence and an easy
rapport; their giddiness on
screen suggests partying rather
than acting. (They've caught
the true John Landis spirit.) An
American Werewolf is a series
of gags, some of them moronic,
a number of them clever, none
of them inspired. The best idea
in the movie is sustained the
longest: the two heroes are
nice Jewish boys from Long Is
land whose friendly bantercon
tinues even after the werewolf
attack that turns one of them
into the next werewolf gener
ation and the other into the un
dead. Unfortunately, the pic
ture is a spoof of a genre of
movies that Landis either
doesn't understand especially
well or doesn't feel com
fortable with; whenever he has
to focus on the horror film plot,
he loses his style.
Plays Monday with Wolfen
and The Howling.
The Blues Brothers (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
For some reason, John
Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
weren't as funny together on
film as they had been when
they tried this routine out on
Saturday Night Live, but there
are bright moments — like their
rendition of the theme from
Rawhide in a country and
western bar. This is a genial bad
movie — rather chintzy for the
money spent on it — with some
memorable musical highlights
provided by John Lee Hooker,
Cab Calloway, James Brown
and especially Aretha Franklin,
whose performance of "Think"
is one of the most electrifying
solos ever filmed. It's well
worth the price of admission.
Carrie Fisher has a surprisingly
funny cameo. John Landis
directed.
Plays today and tomorrow
with 148 Hours.

The Howling (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The director, Joe Dante, sus
tains the tone he wants — jokey
creepiness — and the fact that
he seems to care more about
that than about suspense lends
this werewolf picture an un
usual classiness, though some
of the conventional horror
movie values get sacrificed as a
result. However, Dante and
Rob Bottin, who prepared the
special make-up effects, offer
the audience a real treat: a
transformation scene that
should become a classic. The
script for this send-up was writ
ten by John Sayles and Terence
H. Winkless, cut from a novel by
Gary Brandner; it's a bit flat,
though a few of the last scenes
reveal gleeful parodists at work.
Sayles does the best acting, in
the bit role of a morgue atten
dant. The cast also includes
John Carradine as an old
weirdo — he brings with him
traces of the dozens of roles
he's played in junky Hollywood
horror pictures.
Plays Monday with Wolfen
and An American Werewolf in
London.
Casablanca (1943)
Fox, Redwood City
In some theaters, when this
movie is shown, audiences
bring wine to toast the "Mar
seillaise" scene and everyone
knows all the famous lines,
from"I stick my neck out for
nobody" to "Louis, this could
be the start of a beautiful
friendship." Humphrey Bogart,
at his most romantic, plays Rick,
who owns a cafe in wartime
Casablanca; Ingrid Bergman, at
her most beautiful, is llse, who
deserted him in Paris and now
walks into his club with Paul
Henreid, who plays Victor Laslo
— the Resistance leader the Na
zis can't stop. Dooley Wilson,
Peter Lorre and Sydney Green
street are in it, and so is "As
Time Goes By"; it won the
Academy Award for Best Pic
ture. Of course, nobody really
believes a word of it, but who
cares? It is one of the most won
derfully appealing bad movies
ever to come out of Hollywood.
Michael Curtiz directed; the
script is by Howard Koch.
Plays Monday with It's a
Wonderful Life.

Plays Monday with Wolfen

The Blues Brothers (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
For some reason, John
Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
weren't as funny together on
film as they had been when
they tried this routine out on
Saturday Night Live, but there
are bright moments — like their
rendition of the theme from
Rawhide in a country and
western bar. This is a genial bad
movie — rather chintzy for the
money spent on it — with some
memorable musical highlights
provided by John Lee Hooker,
Cab Calloway, James Brown
and especially Aretha Franklin,
whose performance of "Think"
is one of the most electrifying
solos ever filmed. It's well
worth the price of admission.
Carrie Fisher has a surprisingly
funny cameo. John Landis
directed.
Plays today and tomorrow
with 148 Hours.

The Howling (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The director, Joe Dante, sus
tains the tone he wants — jokey
creepiness — and the fact that
he seems to care more about
that than about suspense lends
this werewolf picture an un
usual classiness, though some
of the conventional horror
movie values get sacrificed as a
result. However, Dante and
Rob Bottin, who prepared the
special make-up effects, offer
the audience a real treat: a
transformation scene that
should become a classic. The
script for this send-up was writ
ten by John Sayles and Terence
H. Winkless, cut from a novel by
Gary Brandner; it's a bit flat,
though a few of the last scenes
reveal gleeful parodists at work.
Sayles does the best acting, in
the bit role of a morgue atten
dant. The cast also includes
John Carradine as an old
weirdo — he brings with him
traces of the dozens of roles
he's played in junky Hollywood
horror pictures.
Plays Monday with Wolfen
and An American Werewolf in
London.
Casablanca (1943)
Fox, Redwood City
In some theaters, when this
movie is shown, audiences
bring wine to toast the "Mar
seillaise" scene and everyone
knows all the famous lines,
from"I stick my neck out for
nobody" to "Louis, this could
be the start of a beautiful
friendship." Humphrey Bogart,
at his most romantic, plays Rick,
who owns a cafe in wartime
Casablanca; Ingrid Bergman, at
her most beautiful, is llse, who
deserted him in Paris and now
walks into his club with Paul
Henreid, who plays Victor Laslo
— the Resistance leader the Na
zis can't stop. Dooley Wilson,
Peter Lorre and Sydney Green
street are in it, and so is "As
Time Goes By"; it won the
Academy Award for Best Pic
ture. Of course, nobody really
believes a word of it, but who
cares? It is one of the most won
derfully appealing bad movies
ever to come out of Hollywood.
Michael Curtiz directed; the
script is by Howard Koch.

The high-tech chic of this
picture, directed by Jean-Jac
ques Beinixand shot by Philippe
Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles
of a movie. Beinix's chief virtue,
aside from his dexterity, is his
determination not to take
himself seriously: the witty,
freewheeling way in which he
has put the picture together,
making his camera double back
on itself with tantalizing self
consciousness, seems to be
based on the careless assump
tion that this little thriller about
stolen tapes is inconsequential.
You can't complain that Diva
doesn't mean anything, be
cause Beinix's style and the
weightless, hollow shimmer of
Hilton McConnico's interior

designs declare it in every
frame. With Frederic Andrei,
who recalls the Jean-Pierre
Leaud of the middle and late
'60s; Thuy An Luu, who has the
unflappable cool of a Godard
gamine; and the black singer
Wilhelminia Wiggins
Fernandez. Beinix and Jean Van
Hamme adapted a novel by De

supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday

Murder by Death (1976)

The idea sounds promising

fairly stupid and certainly lack

Hole-in-the-head white lib

and Katharine Hepburn play
the parents of a young woman
(Katharine Houghton, Hep

turns home engaged to a black
man (Sidney Poitier). The point
seems to be that it's not a bad
strategy to marry a black man
providing he looks like Sidney
Poitier, is a highly successful
doctor and a humanitarian (he
works for the World Health Or
ganization), and possesses no
sexual drive. (We are told that,
at his suggestion, the couple
plans to remain celibate until
marriage.) Though the movie is
ostensibly dedicated to youth
— Tracy has an interminable
curtain speech in which he
urges the young to change the
world — most of the glimpses
we get of America's youth are
pretty dismaying: they all
grumble and listen to loud radi
os, except for Houghton, who is
a grinning ninny. (Poitier
doesn't really rank in the youth
department.) Tracy gives a thor
oughly dull, pedantic per
formance — it's a pity it was his
last — while Hepburn weeps
and weeps. (She won an
Academy Award for it.) Sidney
Poitier is a wonderful actor, but
who could survive this turkey

Gone with the Wind (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto *
David O. Selznick's biggest
movie, written mostly by Ben
Hecht (though Sidney Howard
got the credit and the post
humous Oscar) and directed by
Victor Fleming (though George
Cukor started it). "Big" is not
the same as "great", but this
four-hour adaptation of the
Margaret Mitchell bestseller is
hugely entertaining, especially
when Clark Gable or Butterfly
McQueen is on the screen. And
it does have one performance
that should be called great: Vi
vien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett
O'Hara. With Leslie Howard,
Olivia De Havilland, Thomas
Mitchell, Hattie McDaniel and
many others.
Plays through Wednesday.
It's a Wonderful Life (1946)
Fox, Redwood City
James Stewart plays a small
town joe who has spent years
putting other people's interests
before his own; when his life
begins to fall apart and he con
templates suidice, an angel
(Henry Travers) shows him what
life would have been like for
those closest to him had he nev
er existed. This comedy-drama
is the most eloauent expression
of the populist philosophy
Frank Capra infused his films
with. It's superbly crafted, and
two or three scenes are too
powerful to shake off — Capra
could be an amazing director,
and he knew exactly what he
was doing here. But his vision is
so fraudulent that your tears
may freeze into outrage when
you consider the effect of the
movie. Much of the film's suc
cess as a piece of manipulation
is due to Stewart, whose
earnestness has never been af
fecting in quite this way; his in
tensity is frightening — in the
scene in which he cries out to
his girl, Donna Reed (who is
very good), that he feels
trapped in the town, you can
really see the potential for ner
vous collapse and suicide. The
supporting cast includes the
unconvincing Lionel Bar
rymore, Thomas Mitchell,
Beulah Bondi, Frank Faylen,
Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame,
H.B. Warner and Frank Alber
tson. Capra worked on the
script with Frances Goodrich
and Albert Hackett, and Joseph
Walker and Joseph Biroc col
laborated on the (fine)
cinematography.

An American Werewolf in
London (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Landis' movies are so
cheerfully adolescent that one
can't take them seriously. He
lacks the inventiveness and the
technique to transform his
sophomoric jokes into comic
fantasy, but his buoyant silliness
energizes his pictures, and he
doesn't trash his actors. The two
young stars of this comedy
thriller, David Naughton and
Griffin Dunne, have pleasing
screen presence and an easy
rapport; their giddiness on
screen suggests partying rather
than acting. (They've caught
the true John Landis spirit.) An
American Werewolf is a series
of gags, some of them moronic,
a number of them clever, none
of them inspired. The best idea
in the movie is sustained the
longest: the two heroes are
nice Jewish boys from Long Is
land whose friendly bantercon
tinues even after the werewolf
attack that turns one of them
into the next werewolf gener
ation and the other into the un
dead. Unfortunately, the pic
ture is a spoof of a genre of
movies that Landis either
doesn't understand especially

Plays Sunday evening.

Gone with the Wind (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto *
David O. Selznick's biggest
movie, written mostly by Ben
Hecht (though Sidney Howard
got the credit and the post
humous Oscar) and directed by
Victor Fleming (though George
Cukor started it). "Big" is not
the same as "great", but this
four-hour adaptation of the
Margaret Mitchell bestseller is
hugely entertaining, especially
when Clark Gable or Butterfly
McQueen is on the screen. And
it does have one performance
that should be called great: Vi
vien Leigh's portrayal of Scarlett
O'Hara. With Leslie Howard,
Olivia De Havilland, Thomas
Mitchell, Hattie McDaniel and
many others.
Plays through Wednesday.
It's a Wonderful Life (1946)
Fox, Redwood City
James Stewart plays a small
town joe who has spent years
putting other people's interests
before his own; when his life
begins to fall apart and he con
templates suidice, an angel
(Henry Travers) shows him what
life would have been like for
those closest to him had he nev
er existed. This comedy-drama
is the most eloauent expression
of the populist philosophy
Frank Capra infused his films
with. It's superbly crafted, and
two or three scenes are too
powerful to shake off — Capra
could be an amazing director,
and he knew exactly what he
was doing here. But his vision is
so fraudulent that your tears
may freeze into outrage when
you consider the effect of the
movie. Much of the film's suc
cess as a piece of manipulation
is due to Stewart, whose
earnestness has never been af
fecting in quite this way; his in
tensity is frightening — in the
scene in which he cries out to
his girl, Donna Reed (who is
very good), that he feels
trapped in the town, you can
really see the potential for ner
vous collapse and suicide. The
supporting cast includes the
unconvincing Lionel Bar
rymore, Thomas Mitchell,
Beulah Bondi, Frank Faylen,
Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame,
H.B. Warner and Frank Alber
tson. Capra worked on the
script with Frances Goodrich
and Albert Hackett, and Joseph
Walker and Joseph Biroc col
laborated on the (fine)
cinematography.

An American Werewolf in
London (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Landis' movies are so
cheerfully adolescent that one
can't take them seriously. He
lacks the inventiveness and the
technique to transform his
sophomoric jokes into comic
fantasy, but his buoyant silliness
energizes his pictures, and he
doesn't trash his actors. The two
young stars of this comedy
thriller, David Naughton and
Griffin Dunne, have pleasing
screen presence and an easy
rapport; their giddiness on
screen suggests partying rather
than acting. (They've caught
the true John Landis spirit.) An
American Werewolf is a series
of gags, some of them moronic,
a number of them clever, none
of them inspired. The best idea
in the movie is sustained the
longest: the two heroes are
nice Jewish boys from Long Is
land whose friendly bantercon
tinues even after the werewolf
attack that turns one of them
into the next werewolf gener
ation and the other into the un
dead. Unfortunately, the pic
ture is a spoof of a genre of
movies that Landis either
doesn't understand especially
well or doesn't feel com
fortable with; whenever he has
to focus on the horror film plot,
he loses his style.
Plays Monday with Wolfen
and The Howling.
The Blues Brothers (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
For some reason, John
Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
weren't as funny together on
film as they had been when
they tried this routine out on
Saturday Night Live, but there
are bright moments — like their
rendition of the theme from
Rawhide in a country and
western bar. This is a genial bad
movie — rather chintzy for the
money spent on it — with some
memorable musical highlights
provided by John Lee Hooker,
Cab Calloway, James Brown
and especially Aretha Franklin,
whose performance of "Think"
is one of the most electrifying
solos ever filmed. It's well
worth the price of admission.
Carrie Fisher has a surprisingly
funny cameo. John Landis
directed.
Plays today and tomorrow
with 148 Hours.

The Howling (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The director, Joe Dante, sus
tains the tone he wants — jokey
creepiness — and the fact that
he seems to care more about
that than about suspense lends
this werewolf picture an un
usual classiness, though some
of the conventional horror
movie values get sacrificed as a
result. However, Dante and
Rob Bottin, who prepared the
special make-up effects, offer
the audience a real treat: a
transformation scene that
should become a classic. The
script for this send-up was writ
ten by John Sayles and Terence
H. Winkless, cut from a novel by
Gary Brandner; it's a bit flat,
though a few of the last scenes
reveal gleeful parodists at work.
Sayles does the best acting, in
the bit role of a morgue atten
dant. The cast also includes
John Carradine as an old
weirdo — he brings with him
traces of the dozens of roles
he's played in junky Hollywood
horror pictures.
Plays Monday with Wolfen
and An American Werewolf in
London.
Casablanca (1943)
Fox, Redwood City
In some theaters, when this
movie is shown, audiences
bring wine to toast the "Mar
seillaise" scene and everyone
knows all the famous lines,
from"I stick my neck out for
nobody" to "Louis, this could
be the start of a beautiful
friendship." Humphrey Bogart,
at his most romantic, plays Rick,
who owns a cafe in wartime
Casablanca; Ingrid Bergman, at
her most beautiful, is llse, who
deserted him in Paris and now
walks into his club with Paul
Henreid, who plays Victor Laslo
— the Resistance leader the Na
zis can't stop. Dooley Wilson,
Peter Lorre and Sydney Green
street are in it, and so is "As
Time Goes By"; it won the
Academy Award for Best Pic
ture. Of course, nobody really
believes a word of it, but who
cares? It is one of the most won

Fox, Redwood City
The high-tech chic of this
picture, directed by Jean-Jac
ques Beinixand shot by Philippe
Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles
of a movie. Beinix's chief virtue,
aside from his dexterity, is his
determination not to take
himself seriously: the witty,
freewheeling way in which he
has put the picture together,
making his camera double back
on itself with tantalizing self
consciousness, seems to be
based on the careless assump
tion that this little thriller about
stolen tapes is inconsequential.
You can't complain that Diva
doesn't mean anything, be
cause Beinix's style and the
weightless, hollow shimmer of
Hilton McConnico's interior

designs declare it in every
frame. With Frederic Andrei,
who recalls the Jean-Pierre
Leaud of the middle and late
'60s; Thuy An Luu, who has the
unflappable cool of a Godard
gamine; and the black singer
Wilhelminia Wiggins
Fernandez. Beinix and Jean Van
Hamme adapted a novel by De
lacorta, and Vladimir Cosma
supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with La Cage aux Folles 11.

Murder by Death (1976)
Kresge Auditorium
The idea sounds promising
enough: a collection of detec
tives, each a parody of a famous
fictive sleuth, gathers at the
home of a rich eccentric and, a 6
in And Then There Were None,
people are eliminated one by
one. But the screenplay is by
Neil Simon, who — to put it as
kindly as possible — has no gift
for parody, and the director,
Robert Moore, doesn't help
matters. (Neither does the
clumsy editing.) The result is
fairly stupid and certainly lack
ing in delicacy, despie the all
star cast: Peter Falk (spoofing
Sam Spade), Elsa Lanchester
(Miss Marple), Peter Sellers
(Charlie Chan), David Niven
(Nick Charles), Maggie Smith
(Nora Charles), James Coco
(Hercule Poirot), and Eileen
Brennan, Alec Guinness, Nancy
Walker, Estelle Winwood, and
Truman Capote as the eccen
tric. Falk and Smith each have a
few reasonably funny mo
ments.
Plays tomorrow evening.

Guess Who's Coming to
Dinner (1967)
Kresge Auditorium
Hole-in-the-head white lib
eral hogwash. Spencer Tracy
and Katharine Hepburn play
the parents of a young woman
(Katharine Houghton, Hep
burn's real-life niece) who re
turns home engaged to a black
man (Sidney Poitier). The point
seems to be that it's not a bad
strategy to marry a black man
providing he looks like Sidney
Poitier, is a highly successful
doctor and a humanitarian (he
works for the World Health Or
ganization), and possesses no
sexual drive. (We are told that,
at his suggestion, the couple
plans to remain celibate until
marriage.) Though the movie is
ostensibly dedicated to youth
— Tracy has an interminable
curtain speech in which he
urges the young to change the
world — most of the glimpses
we get of America's youth are
pretty dismaying: they all
grumble and listen to loud radi
os, except for Houghton, who is
a grinning ninny. (Poitier
doesn't really rank in the youth
department.) Tracy gives a thor
oughly dull, pedantic per
formance — it's a pity it was his
last — while Hepburn weeps
and weeps. (She won an
Academy Award for it.) Sidney
Poitier is a wonderful actor, but
who could survive this turkey
unscathed? At least he manages
one movingly acted scene with
his father, played by Roy E.
Glenn Sr. Stanley Kramer
(direction) and William Rose
(screenplay) share the blame
for this offense.
Plays tonight.
An Officer and a Gentleman
Memorial Auditorium
Douglas Day Stewart's
screenplay treats the
metamorphosis of a selfish
loner, Zack Mayo (Richard
Gere), in the course of a naval
officer training program in
Seattle. It's lucky for the movie
that Debra Winger plays Zack's
girl friend, David Keith his best
buddy, and Lou Gossett the drill
instructor, because they all
work hard to persuade au
diences that what they're
seeing is fresh. It isn't; what lies
beneath the film's warm, lively
surface is nothing but old mov
