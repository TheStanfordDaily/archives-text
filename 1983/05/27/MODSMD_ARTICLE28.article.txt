Banquet
Don't forget the annual end-of
the-year banquet on Monday—a
"Memorial Day." Meet at the Daily at
6:30 for refreshments. We'll leave for
the charm—'ming' Chinese setting
promptly at 7:30. Pay as you go!
T-shirts
Daily staffers, be sure to bring $6
and pick up your designer T-shirts.
No longer Daily
The Daily will only make one grand
appearance next week on Thursday.
We'll see you then.


Herb Caen, the "San Francisco
Chronicle" columnist, ponders the
"Daily" during his smashing ap
pearance in the office yesterday.


Happy Birthday
