Salvador killers step forward
San Salvador — A leading leftist guerrilla group said
yesterday its commandos killed the deputy com
mander of U.S. military advisers in El Salvador as a "re
sponse to the criminal intervention of Yankee im
perialism."
In a telephone call to a local radio station, the Popu
lar Liberation Forces said urban commandos from its
organization killed Navy Lt. Cmdr. Albert
Schaufelberger Wednesday evening.
The Popular Liberation Forces is the largest of the
five rebel groups fighting El Salvador's U.S.-backed
government. Its center of operations is in northern
Chalatenango province, near the Honduran border.
The group claimed its commandos "recovered" a

pistol, a submachine gun and a radio transmitter that
belonged to the "executed" Navy officer.
Schaufelberger, 33, of San Diego, Calif., was shot
four times in the head from a car about 6:30 p.m.
Wednesday as he waited in his own car for a woman
friend at the Central American University in San
Salvador.
A Salvadoran government spokesman said yester
day that American and Salvadoran authorities will
conduct parallel investigations of the murder.

From the Associated Kress and The Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News Servicf
northern Japan and the 16- to 18-foot-high seismic
waves that followed it. Little hope was held out that
any of the missing would be found alive.
The epicenter of the earthquake, which struck at
noon with a force of 7.8 on the Richter scale, was cal
culated to be in the Sea of Japan, about 100 miles west
of the coast of Akita prefecture (state). Akita is in the
northwestern part of the main Japanese island of
Honshu.
Three hours later, seismic waves caused by the
temblor hit South Korea's eastern coast. At least one
person was reported dead and two were missing as
more than 100 Korean fishing boats were swamped
and overturned.
Rescue workers in Japan continued to search for
bodies this morning after the national police said that
32 persons had been confirmed dead and that 70 were
reported missing in the coastal area along the Sea of
Japan.
U.S. set to open Honduran base
Washington — The United States is preparing to
open a base in Honduras to train El Salvadoran sol
diers who are battling leftist insurgents, NBC News
said last night.
Quoting classified State Department documents,
NBC said the United States will open the base near
Puerto Castilla on the northern coast of Honduras and
staff it with 100 advisers.
Some of the U.S. advisers now in El Salvador will be
stationed at the new base, according to the report.
The advisers will be able to train about 2000
Salvadorans at a time at the base, the report said. The
first 60 advisers will train a unit of 1000 men, similarto
a quick-strike force. The other 40 advisers will train
smaller units.
In all, 2050 men will be made combat-ready in six
months at a cost of $7 million, NBC said.
Reagan praises MX vote
Washington — President Reagan, praising con
gressional approval of the nuclear-tipped MX missile,
says the Soviet Union and the United States should
take a "first giant step" toward reducing nuclear arms
levels when the two superpowers resume talks next
month.

Reagan's invitation to the Soviets on Wednesday
came hours after the Senate voted 59-39 to free the
Pentagon to spend $625 million to develop and test
the MX. A day earlier, the House granted similar ap
proval by a 239-186 margin.
The victory is in sharp contrast to a White House de
feat on the MX last December, when Congress re
fused to permit the Pentagon to go ahead with pro
curement of the first five of the 100 planned MX
weapons.
Diary forger discovered
Hamburg — The Hamburg Prosecutors Office said
today that Nazi artifact dealer Konrad Kujau had ad
mitted forging the Hitler diaries sold to Stern maga
zine.
The office spokesman, Peter Beck, also said Stern
reporter Gerd Heidemann, who acquired the bogus
Hitler diaries for the magazine, was arrested Thursday
night and will be charged with criminal fraud.
Heidemann, 51, was fired by the magazine after
West German authorities found portions of the
diaries had been copied from an obscure book on
Adolf Hitler.
Heidemann, at a news conference in his home May
10, said he was innocent of any wrongdoing.
He said he bought the diaries from Kujau, who
claimed he got them from an East German identified
only as Mirdorf.
Kujau, 44, was arrested May 14 after voluntarily
turning himself in to authorities.
Stocks stall, volume falls
The stock market posted some scattered losses in a

Analysts said one damper on stock prices was a rise

Salvador killers step forward
San Salvador — A leading leftist guerrilla group said
yesterday its commandos killed the deputy com
mander of U.S. military advisers in El Salvador as a "re
sponse to the criminal intervention of Yankee im
perialism."
In a telephone call to a local radio station, the Popu
lar Liberation Forces said urban commandos from its
organization killed Navy Lt. Cmdr. Albert
Schaufelberger Wednesday evening.
The Popular Liberation Forces is the largest of the
five rebel groups fighting El Salvador's U.S.-backed
government. Its center of operations is in northern
Chalatenango province, near the Honduran border.
The group claimed its commandos "recovered" a

pistol, a submachine gun and a radio transmitter that
belonged to the "executed" Navy officer.
Schaufelberger, 33, of San Diego, Calif., was shot
four times in the head from a car about 6:30 p.m.
Wednesday as he waited in his own car for a woman
friend at the Central American University in San
Salvador.
A Salvadoran government spokesman said yester
day that American and Salvadoran authorities will
conduct parallel investigations of the murder.

northern Japan and the 16- to 18-foot-high seismic
waves that followed it. Little hope was held out that
any of the missing would be found alive.
The epicenter of the earthquake, which struck at
noon with a force of 7.8 on the Richter scale, was cal
culated to be in the Sea of Japan, about 100 miles west
of the coast of Akita prefecture (state). Akita is in the
northwestern part of the main Japanese island of
Honshu.
Three hours later, seismic waves caused by the
temblor hit South Korea's eastern coast. At least one
person was reported dead and two were missing as
more than 100 Korean fishing boats were swamped
and overturned.
Rescue workers in Japan continued to search for
bodies this morning after the national police said that
32 persons had been confirmed dead and that 70 were
reported missing in the coastal area along the Sea of
Japan.
U.S. set to open Honduran base
Washington — The United States is preparing to
open a base in Honduras to train El Salvadoran sol
diers who are battling leftist insurgents, NBC News
said last night.
Quoting classified State Department documents,
NBC said the United States will open the base near
Puerto Castilla on the northern coast of Honduras and
staff it with 100 advisers.
Some of the U.S. advisers now in El Salvador will be
stationed at the new base, according to the report.
The advisers will be able to train about 2000
Salvadorans at a time at the base, the report said. The
first 60 advisers will train a unit of 1000 men, similarto
a quick-strike force. The other 40 advisers will train
smaller units.
In all, 2050 men will be made combat-ready in six
months at a cost of $7 million, NBC said.
Reagan praises MX vote
Washington — President Reagan, praising con
gressional approval of the nuclear-tipped MX missile,
says the Soviet Union and the United States should
take a "first giant step" toward reducing nuclear arms
levels when the two superpowers resume talks next
month.

Reagan's invitation to the Soviets on Wednesday
came hours after the Senate voted 59-39 to free the
Pentagon to spend $625 million to develop and test
the MX. A day earlier, the House granted similar ap
proval by a 239-186 margin.
The victory is in sharp contrast to a White House de
feat on the MX last December, when Congress re
fused to permit the Pentagon to go ahead with pro
curement of the first five of the 100 planned MX
weapons.
Diary forger discovered
Hamburg — The Hamburg Prosecutors Office said
today that Nazi artifact dealer Konrad Kujau had ad
mitted forging the Hitler diaries sold to Stern maga
zine.
The office spokesman, Peter Beck, also said Stern
reporter Gerd Heidemann, who acquired the bogus
Hitler diaries for the magazine, was arrested Thursday
night and will be charged with criminal fraud.
Heidemann, 51, was fired by the magazine after
West German authorities found portions of the
diaries had been copied from an obscure book on
Adolf Hitler.
Heidemann, at a news conference in his home May
10, said he was innocent of any wrongdoing.
He said he bought the diaries from Kujau, who
claimed he got them from an East German identified
only as Mirdorf.
Kujau, 44, was arrested May 14 after voluntarily
turning himself in to authorities.
