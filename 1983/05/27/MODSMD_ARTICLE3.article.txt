Salvador killers step forward
San Salvador — A leading leftist guerrilla group said
yesterday its commandos killed the deputy com
mander of U.S. military advisers in El Salvador as a "re
sponse to the criminal intervention of Yankee im
perialism."
In a telephone call to a local radio station, the Popu
lar Liberation Forces said urban commandos from its
organization killed Navy Lt. Cmdr. Albert
Schaufelberger Wednesday evening.
The Popular Liberation Forces is the largest of the
five rebel groups fighting El Salvador's U.S.-backed
government. Its center of operations is in northern
Chalatenango province, near the Honduran border.
The group claimed its commandos "recovered" a

pistol, a submachine gun and a radio transmitter that
belonged to the "executed" Navy officer.
Schaufelberger, 33, of San Diego, Calif., was shot
four times in the head from a car about 6:30 p.m.
Wednesday as he waited in his own car for a woman
friend at the Central American University in San
Salvador.
A Salvadoran government spokesman said yester
day that American and Salvadoran authorities will
conduct parallel investigations of the murder.
