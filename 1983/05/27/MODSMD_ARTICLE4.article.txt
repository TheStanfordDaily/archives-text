# Faculty urges Hoover study
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
The faculty senate yesterday over
whelmingly approved a resolution
urging the board of trustees to ap
point a committee to "explore and
reassess the relations between the
Hoover Institution and the Univer
sity, including governance and ap
pointment procedures, with the goal
of promoting more effective and
cooperative relations."
After two and a half hours of dis
cussion, this resolution was adopted
in place of English Prof. Ronald Re
bholz's original petition. There was
only one dissenting vote.
Because of the sensitivity of the is
sues, the wording of the final version
was heavily debated. Concerns
raised by faculty members included
how the public would perceive rec
ommending an "inquiry" versus a
more routine "study," whether the
resolution should stress "political or
structural" issues and whether the
final goal should emphasize more
"cooperative" relations between
Hoover and the University or leave
room for a possible "divorce."
The statement ultimately agreed
upon is open-ended enough to allow
the board to interpret for itself who
should compose the committee, and
more importantly, what they should
be charged to reassess.
Those senate members who
voiced dissatisfaction with the origi
nal Rebholz resolution, which called
for an "independent inquiry," said

its wording was too vague and that its
preamble charged Hoover with al
leged "partisanship" — an issue
many faculty members view as sec
ondary, or completely irrelevant, to
the governance and appointment
questions.
Kennedy said that he "would not
have supported the original ver
sion," but is "perfectly comfortable"
with the resolution as it was passed.
"I think it is an important issue —
structurally, not politically," he said.
The board meets next in June for
what is traditionally a house-cleaning
session. Kennedy said he doesn't
know "whether the board will be
persuaded to conduct a study" but
verified that he and the president of
the board William Kimball have "in
deed reached an agreement that a
study is a good idea."
In response to senate discussion
over the pending composition of the
committee, Kennedy said he did not
know "how the board would choose
to charge a committee and who it will
ask to serve."
Faculty members raised questions
about a possible conflict of interest
arising from the fact that eight trus
tees also sit on Hoover's board of
overseers.
When asked whether trustees
would take part in the study, Ken
nedy said, "I think it is inconceivable
that they would study something so
important without their own repre
sentation on it."


FACULTY SUPPORT: After more than two hours of
discussion, the faculty senate yesterday overwhelm
ingly approved a resolution urging the board of trus
tees to appoint a committee to reassess relations,

between the Hoover Institution and the University.
The name of the one dissenting voter was not dis
closed.
