# Faculty urges Hoover study
## 
### KIMBERLY BROWN Senior staff writer 
The faculty senate yesterday over
whelmingly approved a resolution
urging the board of trustees to ap
point a committee to "explore and
reassess the relations between the
Hoover Institution and the Univer
sity, including governance and ap
pointment procedures, with the goal
of promoting more effective and
cooperative relations."
After two and a half hours of dis
cussion, this resolution was adopted
in place of English Prof. Ronald Re
bholz's original petition. There was
only one dissenting vote.
Because of the sensitivity of the is
sues, the wording of the final version
was heavily debated. Concerns
raised by faculty members included
how the public would perceive rec
ommending an "inquiry" versus a
more routine "study," whether the
resolution should stress "political or
structural" issues and whether the
final goal should emphasize more
"cooperative" relations between
Hoover and the University or leave
room for a possible "divorce."
The statement ultimately agreed
upon is open-ended enough to allow
the board to interpret for itself who
should compose the committee, and
more importantly, what they should
be charged to reassess.
Those senate members who
voiced dissatisfaction with the origi
nal Rebholz resolution, which called
for an "independent inquiry," said

its wording was too vague and that its
preamble charged Hoover with al
leged "partisanship" — an issue
many faculty members view as sec
ondary, or completely irrelevant, to
the governance and appointment
questions.
Kennedy said that he "would not
have supported the original ver
sion," but is "perfectly comfortable"
with the resolution as it was passed.
"I think it is an important issue —
structurally, not politically," he said.
The board meets next in June for
what is traditionally a house-cleaning
session. Kennedy said he doesn't
know "whether the board will be
persuaded to conduct a study" but
verified that he and the president of
the board William Kimball have "in
deed reached an agreement that a
study is a good idea."
In response to senate discussion
over the pending composition of the
committee, Kennedy said he did not
know "how the board would choose
to charge a committee and who it will
ask to serve."
Faculty members raised questions
about a possible conflict of interest
arising from the fact that eight trus
tees also sit on Hoover's board of
overseers.
When asked whether trustees
would take part in the study, Ken
nedy said, "I think it is inconceivable
that they would study something so
important without their own repre
sentation on it."


FACULTY SUPPORT: After more than two hours of
discussion, the faculty senate yesterday overwhelm
ingly approved a resolution urging the board of trus
tees to appoint a committee to reassess relations,

Michael Saathoff/Daily
including governance and appointment procedures,
between the Hoover Institution and the University.
The name of the one dissenting voter was not dis
closed.
The wording of the final version adopted by the senate
seemed general enough to satisfy all concerned — ac
cording to their own interpretation.
Rebholz said the wording of the adopted resolution
was "about as much as we could have hoped for."
"It will enable people who want to discuss concerns
beyond governance and appointments a chance to dis
cuss them," he said. The resolution does not specifically
call for, but does not rule out entirely the discussion of
political or financial issues.
French and Italian Prof. Alphonse Juilland, who
single-handedly orchestrated the later counter-petition
effort, is not a member of the senate but told the Daily
after observing the session, "I am delighted the senate
has asked the president to investigate the governance
and appointments procedures — as to our aversion to
the political dimension of the debate, we were entirely
vindicated by the senate on that point."
Political Science Prof. John Manley, who co
sponsored the Hoover petition-drive with Rebholz said,
"I am delighted with the result — I think the concerns of
faculty and students who signed the original petitions
have been more than amply provided for."
While most senate members agreed that the structural
issues of governance and appointments were worthy of
a study, considerable debate centered around the rele
vance of Hoover's alleged "partisanship" to the pro
posed inquiry.
Reading from a lengthy written statement, Rebholz
charged that "no other department of the University has
'anomalies' of governance, budget, appointment and

political purpose."
Manley, reading his own statement, questioned the
influence of Hoover upon the Political Science Depart
ment, and in reference to reported instances of "recip
rocity" said, "merit is hardly the issue — politics is."
Civil Engineering Prof. James Gere disagreed, saying,
"the inquiry has become a political football." Although
the national press has played up the political ties with
Reagan, Gere said the "only real concerns are the issues
of governance and appointments."
Similarly, Biological Sciences Prof. Jonathan
Roughgard said, "I am very reluctant to support an in
vestigation of Hoover's political orientation. On the
other hand, I find the anomalies in Hoover's governance
and appointments very disturbing."
Robert Hall, a Senior Fellow at Hoover and an Econom
ics Prof, told the senate that the process of appointing
senior fellows at Hoover "is not an issue of faculty gov
ernance ... it would make no more sense to have the
faculty involved in appointing Hoover fellows than it
would to have Hoover fellows appointing faculty," he
said.
Several faculty members questioned what the
difference between senior fellows and faculty members
was.
Hall replied that "as a group they are comparable to
the faculty . . . but that fundamentally, the University is
run by the trustees, not the faculty."
Sanford Dornbusch, professor of Sociology, said, "I
believe there really has been a problem with governance
and appointments — historically. Nevertheless, I don't
know what the exact method of appointment proce
dures should be."
"I think some good things could come out of the
study, but I don't want it to delve into finances and
politics — that seems a dead end," he said.
