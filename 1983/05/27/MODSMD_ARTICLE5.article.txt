# Major black groups protest Reagan's changes
## Hoover fellow named for Civil Rights Commission 
### JON HORNSBY 
John Bunzel, a senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution, was one of three people
nominated to the Civil Rights Commission on
Tuesday by President Reagan in a move that is
drawing criticism from major civil rights
groups.
Bunzel, who has been at Hoover since step
ping down as president of San jose State Uni
versity in 1978, is described as a conservative
Democrat who shares Reagan's opposition to
racial quotas and school busing.
At a press conference Tuesday, Bunzel and
the other nominees, New York attorney Morris
Abram and Catholic University Asst. Law Prof.
Robert Destro, sought to counter charges that
they were appointed to slow down govern
ment efforts to eliminate discrimination.
"My dedication to civil rights is a very impor
tant part of my life," Bunzel told the White
House briefing. He said yesterday that he
would not comment further on his nomination
until after the senate confirmation hearings.
However, he did release a statement reiterat
ing his commitment to civil rights.
If approved by the U.S. Senate, the
nominees will replace three more liberal
members who were appointed by formerPres

ident Jimmy Carter.
One of these members, Rabbi Murray
Salzman, said he is "saddened and grieved and
even on the verge of outrage in terms of what
the administration is doing to the commis
sion."
The commission, which must be bipartisan
by law, monitors the impact of federal laws and
policies on discrimination based on race,
color, religion, sex, national origin, age or
handicap.
Bay Area and national leadersof the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP) referred to the dismissal of
Carter's appointees as "a purge," a vindictive
reaction against those who have been critical
of the administration's civil rights record.
"The action of the president was very
harsh," said Virna Canson, West Coast re
gional director of the NAACP. "We feel it was
deliberately designed to send a message to
black people."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes
countered the attacks. The nominees, he said,
"have exhibited a strong commitment to civil
rights and have outstanding credentials. They

were selected as individuals with independent
viewpoints."
Bunzel has a record of fighting for equal
opportunity, yet he has said he opposes affir
mative action programs which place minority
status above individual qualifications.
"I support compensatory actions, but the
American people draw the line according to
preferential treatment according to race," he
said.
Exactly where Bunzel draws the line in these
seemingly opposing stances is a source of dis
agreement among those familiar with his
background.
"I don't think I've ever seen anything that
shows his support of affirmative action," said
Garret Tatum, an assistant affirmative action
officer here, who has known Bunzel since
1975. "I just hope he seeks to improve his
awareness of the field before making decisions
on the commission."
Felix Garc ia, who has taught at San lose State
since 1970 when Bunzel began as president
there, said, "I don't see him as an enemy of
affirmative action. He was in favor of it, pro
vided the qualifications were there. That was
the condition he made very clear."
