# Kennedy to speak if Shultz absent
## 
### JANE McCONNELL Staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy will fill in for
Secretary of State George Shult/ as the commenrement
speaker on |une 12 if Shultz is unable to appear, accord
ing to Kennedy's assistant Marlene Wine.
Meanwhile campus groups, including the Stanford
Central American Action Network and the Stanford Co
alition Against Apartheid (SCAA), are busy organizing
protests of the Reagan administration's foreign policy in
anticipation of Shultz's speech.
"He is prepared to speak. Kennedy is convinced that
Shultz is going to be here," Wine said. "Kennedy feels it
would be unfair to have somebody prepare a speech and
be held on stand-by."
Shultz has recently been in the Middle East conduct
ing negotiations on the Arab-Israeli conflict
As part of the protest against the Reagan administra

tion foreign policy, SCAA will present a petition to
Shultz demanding the United States take actions against
apartheid in South Africa.
The petition demands that Shultz "use his office to
pressure the South African government" to free Nelson
Mandela, a leader of the African National Congress
jailed since 1%1; and to lift the ban on his wife, Winnie,
who is also active in the ANC and has been banished to a
remote area where she is only allowed the company of
one person at a time.
In addition, the petition demands that the U.S. gov
ernment grant political asylum to Dennis Brutus, a South
African poet and athlete who teaches at Northwestern
and has received deportation orders.
"It's mainly a symbolic gesture to bring the issue to the
attention of Shultz and the Stanford community, just as
the petition for a nuclear freeze on the California state
ballot was," said Ann Mueller, chairman of the Social
Education and Action Committee (SEAC) of Stanford
Memorial Church.
Members of the Coalition Against Apartheid which
authored the petition include Stanford African Students
Association, Southern Africa Liberation Solidarity
Committee, Black Student Union and Amnesty Interna
tional Stanford group, as well as SEAC.
The petition is being addressed to Shultz since he
represents the Reagan administration which has de
clared a policy of constructive engagement with South
Africa. This policy has resulted in increased collabora
tion with the white South African regime by both public
and private investors in the U.S.
"With the petition we hope to bring pressure by our
government on the government of South Africa," said
Robert Hamerton-Kelly, dean of the Chapel and
member of the coordinating committee of the coalition,
who is himself in exile from South Africa.
Opposition to apartheid has grown on campus in re
cent years, culminating with the formation of the coali
tion this year, according to Mueller. "The trend of

apathy is being reversed, and you can see by the number
of groups involved in the coalition how many students
are showing an interest," said Mueller.
One reason for this interest, according to Hamerton-
Kelly, was a recent talk given at Memorial Church by
Kenneth Carstens, executive director of the American
branch for International Defense and Aid, a firm which
raises money for legal assistance to victims of apartheid.
"His presence spurred interest and South Africa became
a priority," said Hamerton-Kelly.
The coalition hopes to get 3000 signatures on the peti
tion, with 100 copies of it circulating.
However, Hamerton-Kelly is doubtful that the petition
will prompt any direct action by the U.S. government,
especially since the ANC is believed to have been re
sponsible for the bomb set off in Pretoria last week
which killed 18 people. "Opposition to the ANC has
escalated lately, which complicates the issue of Mande
la's release," said Hamerton-Kelly.
In the case of Brutus, Hamerton-Kelly said, "the spirit
of the law should take precedence over the letter of the
law in this instance."
Although the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Of
fice has a legal case for deporting Brutus, Hamerton-
Kelly said, "the U.S. government is eager to get rid of
him because of his sports opposition to South Africa in
the Olympic Games."
