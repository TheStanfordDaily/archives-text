would be unfair to have somebody prepare a speech and
be held on stand-by."
Shultz has recently been in the Middle East conduct

Shultz demanding the United States take actions against
apartheid in South Africa.
The petition demands that Shultz "use his office to
pressure the South African government" to free Nelson

African poet and athlete who teaches at Northwestern
and has received deportation orders.

attention of Shultz and the Stanford community, just as
