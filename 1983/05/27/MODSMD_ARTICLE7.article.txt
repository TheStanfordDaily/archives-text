# McCloskey, Linfield support class inquiry
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
Guest Prof. Paul "Pete" McClos
key and Seth Linfield, director of the
Guest Professorship Board (GPB),
agree on one thing — that the Uni
versity should conduct an inquiry
into possible breaches of academic
freedom in the offering of the former
congressman's course. But both are
sure the inquiry will end in their own
favor.
The inquiry, to be conducted by
Political Science Department faculty,
will investigate whether Linfield and
the GPB violated McCloskey's
academic freedom in attempting to
change the content of the course,
"The Congressional Decision-
Making Process."
"I welcome the inquiry. It will lay
to rest some of McCloskey's ground
less charges against the Bureau," Lin
field said.
McCloskey said, "It's entirely ap
propriate ... It (changing the read
ing list) is clearly in violation of
academic freedom."
"The precedent that is set by this
case is much more important (than
the case itself)," he said, adding that
"all over the world" people look to
Stanford as a leader of academic
freedom.
If the GPB continues to "censor"
course syllabi, McCloskey said, "I
don't think you'll ever get a quality
(guest) professor to come to Stan
ford."
Linfield disagreed. "We don't
foresee any difficulty whatsoever (in
attracting future guest professors)
. . . We have asked for the syllabus."
He added, "Normally professors
welcome the opportunity to ensure
that their courses are in keeping with
the traditional rigorous academic
standards of an institution like Stan
ford."
McCloskey has claimed that Lin
field changed the reading list be
cause of "reverseanti-Semitism." He
added, "It (the anti-Semitism charge)

is absolutely bizarre . . . The one
book that the GPB would not allow
me to use was a book written by an
Israeli."
Linfield disagreed, saying the
book's author isn't an Israeli, but
rather is founder of the American Is
raeli Public Affairs Committee, a
pro-Israeli group.
Furthermore, he said the book was
not "censored," but that the GPB
asked that McCloskey switch the
book from required reading status to
reserve reading because the cost of
the books would be too high.
Linfield claimed he changed the
reading list only because it was
"poorly organized."
"The Bureau has acted according
to the highest principles of academic
freedom," Linfield said. "We don't
impose anything on the guest pro
fessor ... He (McCloskey) agreed as
to what the reading lists would be."
University Vice President and Pro
vost Albert Hastorf has called for the
inquiry earlier this week, saying,
"departmental faculties are respon
sible for who will offer courses for
credit and the subject matter of these
courses. Once that is done, teachers
at this University have the freedom to
define content."
Linfield has authored an official
statement of the GPB's position, also
signed by next year's co-directors,
freshman Ricky Lerner and sopho
more Nathan Bostrom. "It's not Lin
field against McCloskey," Linfield
said.
He called the group's statement,
which denounces McCloskey, "re
strained," explaining, "I have my
own personal things to say about my
friend Pete."
According to the GPB's statement,
"McCloskey's suggestion in the
Daily of May 23 that Seth Linfield had
reached a cabalistic agreement with
unnamed members of the Jewish
community, or with Stanford Hillel,
is typical McCloskey Jew-baiting . . "
