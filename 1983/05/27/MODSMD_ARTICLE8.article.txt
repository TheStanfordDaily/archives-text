# Vocal Prof. John Kaplan's humor endears him to students
## 
### SID ATKINS Senior Staff Writer 
John Kaplan's desk is a mess.
Scattered across it are
books, manuscripts, phone
messages, tape recorders and
other odds and ends of a pro
fessor's life.
While a press photographer
clicks pictures in his office,
Kaplan hurriedly removes his
feet from the orderless pile on
his desk and starts depositing
some of the paper into a trash
can. "I'm usually a complete
slob. I have problems filing
things. My tiling system is to
throw things out," he said.
Kaplan, a Jackson Eli
Reynolds professor of law, in
spects his matching brown tie
and pants as the photographer
continues. "Do you think I
look all right? I was hurt by the
article in the law school news
paper saying that I'm the worst
dresser on campus. I didn't
mind the comparison to
Woody Allen, but the other
stuff really got me. Oh well, no
one has ever loved me for my
looks," he said.
What the hundreds of stu
dents in his undergraduate and
law school classes have loved
him for are his humorous and
informative lectures, his caring
and open attitude, and his
lively personality in and out of
class.
Kaplan, a graduate of Har
vard in 1951 and Harvard Law
School in '54, is respected na
tionally as a leading expert in
the field of Criminal Law, and
only the largest auditoriums on
campus are reserved every
spring for his undergraduate
class on the subject.
"His class is really interesting
regardless of whether you're in
law," said junior Jim Backer,
who is taking Kaplan's Criminal
Law class.
At the law school, where
Kaplan employs the more chal
lenging Socratic method of
teaching, his classes are
equally well liked.
Third year law student Bruce
King said, "He's a good
teacher, he's sharp and enter
taining. At the law school he's
more adversarial, though. He
doesn't just lay out the facts. I

think you can appreciate his
humor more when you don't
have to worry about being
called on." King said.
Attempting to capture Kap
lan s inescapable sense of
humor, King and others de
scribed him as "irreverent."
Jack Friedenthal, a fellow law
prof., said Kaplan provided
"the sense of irreverence that
we desperately need around
the law school."

John Faulkner, a second year
law student who used to be
Kaplan's gardener, said Kap
lan's sense of humor was the
"straightforward New York"
kind and provided an example
from this fall's law school
course guide.
"There was no one available
to teach Anti-trust in the fall, so
Kaplan agreed to give it a try,"
Faulkner said.
"Apparently he spent all
summer learning the material,
but at the time the course de
scriptions were submitted a
year ago he was quite frank
about his lack of familiarity
with the subject." Faulkner
said.
When the course guide was
printed, Kaplan's conspicu
ously undersized description
read: "This course will have
something to do with anti-trust
law whatever that is."
Kaplan said his own idea of
amusement was to broadcast
his Criminal Law mid-term like
a baseball game over KZSU
radio. His show was complete
with a color commentator, a

pre-exam warm-up and inter
views with students and TA's
after the event.
While there are many other
examples of Kaplan's sense of
humor, he thinks the subject is
overplayed. "I don't think I'm
that funny. At a basic level I
don't even know how to
smile," Kaplan said.
Thp serious side of Kaplan is
represented by the numerous
books he has written, the most
recent being The Hardest
Drug: Heroin and Publicity.
The heroin book recieved a
rave review in the Wall Street
Journal last month and has
touched off a debate on that
publication's editorial page.
Kaplan said the basic thrust of
the book is the "heroin is a
complex, many sided problem
which we can't really do much
about."
Despite this mild statement,
Kaplan rarely shies from taking
a stand on issues related to the
University community or to so
ciety in general. In the recent
Hoover Institution con
troversy, for instance, Kaplan
sent in a letter to the Daily say
ing that he did not believe that
Hoover is politically unbal
anced.
Kaplan has also spoken on
the undergraduategradingsys
tem, which he thinks is badly
inflated. "I think the grading
here is a scandal. At the law
school we know what a 3.7
from Stanford means, and it
doesn't mean the same thing
that it does at Harvard or Vale,"
Kaplan said.
Kaplan claims that he doesn't
have a lot of power in the Uni
versity to affect changes on
these issues, though. "I'm not
a major mover or earth shaker
in this University. I avoid
committees when I can."
Outside the University, two
of Kaplan's most noted posi
tions are his support for the
legalization of marijuana and
his opposition to gun control.
Kaplan said he sees the issues
as identical.
"Both involve the attempted
enforcement of a law against
private activity which a very
large number of people aren't
going to obey. Both will violate

civil rights. To me they are the
same, but virtually nobody
sees them that way," Kaplan
said.
People who don't see the
world's major issues in the
same light as Kaplan are often
the ones who are offended by
his firm views and quick wits,
according to Faulkner.
"The negative comments
I've heard tend to be from
people who get outraged by
some of his controversial polit
ical and moral stands. They just
catch his abrasive side," Faulk
ner said.
Friedenthal agreed, saying,
"John (Kaplan) is sometimes
off the cuff. He makes com
ments sometimes that he
might wish he hadn't. But he's
really a very caring person."
Before entering teaching at
Northwestern in 1962, Kaplan
worked both as a federal pros
ecutor and a criminal defense
lawyer. He said he quit when
he started detecting liquor on
the breath of too many of his
adversaries. He came to Stan
ford in 1965.
Kaplan was actually trained
as a physicist, spending his first
few years out of college in a
Naval research lab. He re
turned to graduate school be
cause "that's what all my
friends were doing," and he
quickly discovered that he
liked law more than physics.
"School was fun. I guess not
everybody does, but I enjoyed
going to school," Kaplan said.
Kaplan, now a resident fel
low in Yost House, said he still
very much enjoys teaching and
being at Stanford. "It's very fun
dealing with kids of your own
kids' age who are not your own
kids. One tends to take one's
own too seriously."
Asked what he does in his
free time for relaxation, Kaplan
first replied 'white-water
canoeing and mountian
climbing," then admitted that
he didn't know.
"Ask me when I'm relaxing,"
he said. "Unfortunately, I was
left without talent (in this
area)."

Woody Allen, but the other
stuff really got me. Oh well, no
one has ever loved me for my
looks," he said.
What the hundreds of stu
dents in his undergraduate and
law school classes have loved
him for are his humorous and
informative lectures, his caring
and open attitude, and his
lively personality in and out of
class.
Kaplan, a graduate of Har
vard in 1951 and Harvard Law
School in '54, is respected na
tionally as a leading expert in
the field of Criminal Law, and
only the largest auditoriums on
campus are reserved every
spring for his undergraduate
class on the subject.
"His class is really interesting
regardless of whether you're in
law," said junior Jim Backer,
who is taking Kaplan's Criminal
Law class.
At the law school, where
Kaplan employs the more chal
lenging Socratic method of
teaching, his classes are
equally well liked.
Third year law student Bruce
King said, "He's a good
teacher, he's sharp and enter
taining. At the law school he's
more adversarial, though. He
doesn't just lay out the facts. I

think you can appreciate his
humor more when you don't
have to worry about being
called on." King said.
Attempting to capture Kap
lan s inescapable sense of
humor, King and others de
scribed him as "irreverent."
Jack Friedenthal, a fellow law
prof., said Kaplan provided
"the sense of irreverence that
we desperately need around
the law school."

John Faulkner, a second year
law student who used to be
Kaplan's gardener, said Kap
lan's sense of humor was the
"straightforward New York"
kind and provided an example
from this fall's law school
course guide.
"There was no one available
to teach Anti-trust in the fall, so
Kaplan agreed to give it a try,"
Faulkner said.
"Apparently he spent all
summer learning the material,
but at the time the course de
scriptions were submitted a
year ago he was quite frank
about his lack of familiarity
with the subject." Faulkner
said.
When the course guide was
printed, Kaplan's conspicu
ously undersized description
read: "This course will have
something to do with anti-trust
law whatever that is."
Kaplan said his own idea of
amusement was to broadcast
his Criminal Law mid-term like
a baseball game over KZSU
radio. His show was complete
with a color commentator, a

pre-exam warm-up and inter
views with students and TA's
after the event.
While there are many other
examples of Kaplan's sense of
humor, he thinks the subject is
overplayed. "I don't think I'm
that funny. At a basic level I
don't even know how to
smile," Kaplan said.
Thp serious side of Kaplan is
represented by the numerous
books he has written, the most
recent being The Hardest
Drug: Heroin and Publicity.
The heroin book recieved a
rave review in the Wall Street
Journal last month and has
touched off a debate on that
publication's editorial page.
Kaplan said the basic thrust of
the book is the "heroin is a
complex, many sided problem
which we can't really do much
about."
Despite this mild statement,
Kaplan rarely shies from taking
a stand on issues related to the
University community or to so
ciety in general. In the recent
Hoover Institution con
troversy, for instance, Kaplan
sent in a letter to the Daily say
ing that he did not believe that
Hoover is politically unbal
anced.
Kaplan has also spoken on
the undergraduategradingsys
tem, which he thinks is badly
inflated. "I think the grading
here is a scandal. At the law
school we know what a 3.7
from Stanford means, and it
doesn't mean the same thing
that it does at Harvard or Vale,"
Kaplan said.
Kaplan claims that he doesn't
have a lot of power in the Uni
versity to affect changes on
these issues, though. "I'm not
a major mover or earth shaker
in this University. I avoid
committees when I can."
Outside the University, two
of Kaplan's most noted posi
tions are his support for the
legalization of marijuana and
his opposition to gun control.
Kaplan said he sees the issues
as identical.
"Both involve the attempted
enforcement of a law against
private activity which a very
large number of people aren't
going to obey. Both will violate

civil rights. To me they are the
same, but virtually nobody
sees them that way," Kaplan
said.
People who don't see the
world's major issues in the
same light as Kaplan are often
the ones who are offended by
his firm views and quick wits,
according to Faulkner.
"The negative comments
I've heard tend to be from
people who get outraged by
some of his controversial polit
ical and moral stands. They just
catch his abrasive side," Faulk
ner said.
Friedenthal agreed, saying,
"John (Kaplan) is sometimes
off the cuff. He makes com
ments sometimes that he
might wish he hadn't. But he's
really a very caring person."
Before entering teaching at
Northwestern in 1962, Kaplan
worked both as a federal pros
ecutor and a criminal defense
lawyer. He said he quit when
he started detecting liquor on
the breath of too many of his
adversaries. He came to Stan
ford in 1965.
Kaplan was actually trained
as a physicist, spending his first
few years out of college in a
Naval research lab. He re
turned to graduate school be
cause "that's what all my
friends were doing," and he
quickly discovered that he
liked law more than physics.
"School was fun. I guess not
everybody does, but I enjoyed
going to school," Kaplan said.
Kaplan, now a resident fel
low in Yost House, said he still
very much enjoys teaching and
being at Stanford. "It's very fun
dealing with kids of your own
kids' age who are not your own
kids. One tends to take one's
own too seriously."
Asked what he does in his
free time for relaxation, Kaplan
first replied 'white-water
canoeing and mountian
climbing," then admitted that
he didn't know.
"Ask me when I'm relaxing,"
he said. "Unfortunately, I was
left without talent (in this
area)."
