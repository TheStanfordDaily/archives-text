## National strength through peace 
### 
While most students here spent this week preparing
for final exams, Congress passed President Reagan's test
of "national will" by approving $625 million to begin
testing of the MX missile. The textbook for their test was
the Scowcroft Commission report to the president rec
ommending that 100 MX missiles be deployed in existing
Minutemen silos. Take a moment from your studies to
review Congressional performance on this test of "na
tional will." In grading this test, we might first ask,
"What is our national will?" Perhaps the Scowcroft re
port will provide a clue to the correct answer.
The stated mandate of the commission was to find a
solution to the perceived vulnerability of American
ICBMs. So perhaps the vote was a test of our "will" to
make land-based systems invulnerable. Yet, the report
concludes, that there is no substantial threat to our
land-based forces. A first-strike attack is deterred, the
commission concludes, by "our other strategic forces
and. • .the range of operational uncertainties that the
Soviets would have to consider in such aggression."
Despite this dismissal of the strategic premise for new
deployments, the Scowcroft Commission recom
mended the immediate deployment of 100 MX missiles
in existing silos, along with the development of a small,
single warhead Midgetman missile by 1990.
Perhaps "national will" refers to a desire to deter war.
If so, building the MX would not demonstrate our re
solve. The MX is a first-strike capable weapon, threaten
ing the Soviet Union's ability to retaliate in a nuclear
exchange, and so increases the likelihood of a Soviet
pre-emptive attack. Placing such a threatening missile in
silos which the administration previously claimed were
vulnerable is also dangerous since a 10-warhead MX
missile is a much more attractive target than the three
warhead Minutemen currently in place. A missile which
is both threatening to Soviet forces and vulnerable to
Soviet attack will not deter war.
President Reagan and the commission argue that the
MX is a necessary "bargaining chip" in negotiations
aimed at reducing Soviet weapons arsenals. Perhaps
"national will" refers to a desire to conclude an arms
control treaty with the Soviet Union. Reviewing our his
tory lessons, however, it is clear that the Soviets have
always responded to U.S deployments by building up
their own forces. America's procurement of 100 large,
first-strike, MX missiles would be no exception.
Moreover, the Scowcroft commission concludes, if the
Soviets respond to the MX with additional weapons,
America would have to reconsider limiting the number
of MX missiles to only 100. The MX is thus another step
towards legitimizing the arms race; this time a race to
deploy large "war-fighting" weapons.
The proposed deployments of two new ICBMs also
goes against the spirit of the SALT II treaty guidelines
which limit new ICBM tests to one for each side. The
report dismisses the problem of testing both the MX and
Midgetman by noting that the treaty expires in 1985. By
preparing now to test two new missiles, the United
States would signal its will to allow the SALT process to
die out in 1985, without extension. The commission also
recommends the MX to prevent a Soviet breakout from
the 1972 treaty prohibiting ABM systems. Again, by
suggesting the placement of a new missile in prepara
tion for the abrogation of existing arms control treaties,
the report demonstrates the "national will" to under
mine, rather than to further, meaningful arms control
negotiations.
Perhaps by "national will" Reagan was testing Con
gress' ability to represent the sentiments of the majority
of Americans. If so, Congress failed the exam. The
strength and perseverence of the nuclear freeze move

ment and the continued opposition to the MX demon
strate the American public's desire to stop weapons
production rather than to endorse a new missile.
What do we envision when we hear our president
speak of "national will?" Frequently, Reagan refers to a
goal of "peace through strength". . .it sounds like a
right answer. Let's review: in light of the dangerous and
unstable U.S.-Soviet Union military balance, how might
we achieve a strong America in a peaceful world?
One step would be for the United States to deploy
weapons based on military strategic requirements,
rather than mirroring Soviet deployments. America's
geography lends itself to a sea-based emphasis, while
the Soviet Union must necessarily rely on more vulnera
ble land-based systems. The MX threatens to back the
Soviets into a strategic corner by making their land
based systems vulnerable. I wonder what missile the
Soviet's "Scowcroft commission" will recommend to
deal with the threat the MX poses to Soviet ICBMs?
Perhaps that is their test of "national will." In any case, it
will probably not bring peace or strength to America.
A second step toward a stronger United States in a
peaceful world would be for negotiations to begin on
stopping the continued development of accurate and
time-urgent first-strike weapons. Despite its limitations,
there is currently no viable alternative to reliance on
mutual hostage populations and a mutual retaliatory
capability to deter a first-strike. Both the United States
and the Soviet Union would benefit from stopping the
technological race towards usable nuclear weapons. A
ban on first-strike weapons might take the form of a
freeze, a Comprehensive Test Ban or be included in the
START process. If the MX is deployed it will become
difficult if not impossible to stop the production and use
of such weapons.
Finally, American leaders must recognize that there is
no technological solution to political problems. Political
crises are solved by political innovation. As the strongest
economic, military and political power in the world, only
the United States can lead the world towards a global
vision of the common destiny of all people on the
planet. America is unique in having the allies, the
domestic support, the economic clout and the political
prestige to propose international solutions to global
problems.
America will appear weak if its weapons deployments
are dictated by fear of the Soviet Union or led by unre
strained technological innovations. Strength is reflected
in self-confidence, political leadership and the ability to
be the first nation to make global peace and equity the
highest national priority.
Peace has never been achieved by building larger and
more sophisticated weapons and strength has never
been maintained without peace. From our current posi
tion of strength, the United States could initiate a rela
tionship of cooperation with the Soviet Union in all areas
of common interest, including weapons limitations,
economic development and ecological conservation.
In the next few weeks Congress will face another
"test"; this time they will decide whether to spend $4.2
billion to begin procurement of the MX. If we want
Congress to pass this test, we must tell them our "na
tional will." Perhaps rather than the current policy of
"peace through strength" America should pursue
"strength through peace." The Scowcroft Commission,
the administration and now Congress have determined
that there is no "window of vulnerability" but all of them
failed to see the opportunity to make America strong by
contributing to world peace. It doesn't require the MX to
pass this test; it requires the will.

deal with the threat the MX poses to Soviet ICBMs?
Perhaps that is their test of "national will." In any case, it
will probably not bring peace or strength to America.
A second step toward a stronger United States in a
peaceful world would be for negotiations to begin on
stopping the continued development of accurate and
time-urgent first-strike weapons. Despite its limitations,
there is currently no viable alternative to reliance on
mutual hostage populations and a mutual retaliatory
capability to deter a first-strike. Both the United States
and the Soviet Union would benefit from stopping the
technological race towards usable nuclear weapons. A
ban on first-strike weapons might take the form of a
freeze, a Comprehensive Test Ban or be included in the
START process. If the MX is deployed it will become
difficult if not impossible to stop the production and use
of such weapons.
Finally, American leaders must recognize that there is
no technological solution to political problems. Political
crises are solved by political innovation. As the strongest
economic, military and political power in the world, only
the United States can lead the world towards a global
vision of the common destiny of all people on the
planet. America is unique in having the allies, the
domestic support, the economic clout and the political
prestige to propose international solutions to global
problems.
America will appear weak if its weapons deployments
are dictated by fear of the Soviet Union or led by unre
strained technological innovations. Strength is reflected
in self-confidence, political leadership and the ability to
be the first nation to make global peace and equity the
highest national priority.
Peace has never been achieved by building larger and
more sophisticated weapons and strength has never
been maintained without peace. From our current posi
tion of strength, the United States could initiate a rela
tionship of cooperation with the Soviet Union in all areas
of common interest, including weapons limitations,
economic development and ecological conservation.
In the next few weeks Congress will face another
"test"; this time they will decide whether to spend $4.2
billion to begin procurement of the MX. If we want
Congress to pass this test, we must tell them our "na
tional will." Perhaps rather than the current policy of
"peace through strength" America should pursue
"strength through peace." The Scowcroft Commission,
the administration and now Congress have determined
that there is no "window of vulnerability" but all of them
failed to see the opportunity to make America strong by
contributing to world peace. It doesn't require the MX to
pass this test; it requires the will.

While most students here spent this week preparing
for final exams, Congress passed President Reagan's test
of "national will" by approving $625 million to begin
testing of the MX missile. The textbook for their test was
the Scowcroft Commission report to the president rec
ommending that 100 MX missiles be deployed in existing
Minutemen silos. Take a moment from your studies to
review Congressional performance on this test of "na
tional will." In grading this test, we might first ask,
"What is our national will?" Perhaps the Scowcroft re
port will provide a clue to the correct answer.
The stated mandate of the commission was to find a
solution to the perceived vulnerability of American
ICBMs. So perhaps the vote was a test of our "will" to
make land-based systems invulnerable. Yet, the report
concludes, that there is no substantial threat to our
land-based forces. A first-strike attack is deterred, the
commission concludes, by "our other strategic forces
and. • .the range of operational uncertainties that the
Soviets would have to consider in such aggression."
Despite this dismissal of the strategic premise for new
deployments, the Scowcroft Commission recom
mended the immediate deployment of 100 MX missiles
in existing silos, along with the development of a small,
single warhead Midgetman missile by 1990.
Perhaps "national will" refers to a desire to deter war.
If so, building the MX would not demonstrate our re
solve. The MX is a first-strike capable weapon, threaten
ing the Soviet Union's ability to retaliate in a nuclear
exchange, and so increases the likelihood of a Soviet
pre-emptive attack. Placing such a threatening missile in
silos which the administration previously claimed were
vulnerable is also dangerous since a 10-warhead MX
missile is a much more attractive target than the three
warhead Minutemen currently in place. A missile which
is both threatening to Soviet forces and vulnerable to
Soviet attack will not deter war.
President Reagan and the commission argue that the
MX is a necessary "bargaining chip" in negotiations
aimed at reducing Soviet weapons arsenals. Perhaps
"national will" refers to a desire to conclude an arms
control treaty with the Soviet Union. Reviewing our his
tory lessons, however, it is clear that the Soviets have
always responded to U.S deployments by building up
their own forces. America's procurement of 100 large,
first-strike, MX missiles would be no exception.
Moreover, the Scowcroft commission concludes, if the
Soviets respond to the MX with additional weapons,
America would have to reconsider limiting the number
of MX missiles to only 100. The MX is thus another step
towards legitimizing the arms race; this time a race to
deploy large "war-fighting" weapons.
The proposed deployments of two new ICBMs also
goes against the spirit of the SALT II treaty guidelines
which limit new ICBM tests to one for each side. The
report dismisses the problem of testing both the MX and
Midgetman by noting that the treaty expires in 1985. By
preparing now to test two new missiles, the United
States would signal its will to allow the SALT process to
die out in 1985, without extension. The commission also
recommends the MX to prevent a Soviet breakout from
the 1972 treaty prohibiting ABM systems. Again, by
suggesting the placement of a new missile in prepara
tion for the abrogation of existing arms control treaties,
the report demonstrates the "national will" to under
mine, rather than to further, meaningful arms control
negotiations.
Perhaps by "national will" Reagan was testing Con
gress' ability to represent the sentiments of the majority
of Americans. If so, Congress failed the exam. The
strength and perseverence of the nuclear freeze move

ment and the continued opposition to the MX demon
strate the American public's desire to stop weapons
production rather than to endorse a new missile.
What do we envision when we hear our president
speak of "national will?" Frequently, Reagan refers to a
goal of "peace through strength". . .it sounds like a
right answer. Let's review: in light of the dangerous and
unstable U.S.-Soviet Union military balance, how might
we achieve a strong America in a peaceful world?
One step would be for the United States to deploy
weapons based on military strategic requirements,
rather than mirroring Soviet deployments. America's
geography lends itself to a sea-based emphasis, while
the Soviet Union must necessarily rely on more vulnera
ble land-based systems. The MX threatens to back the
Soviets into a strategic corner by making their land
based systems vulnerable. I wonder what missile the
Soviet's "Scowcroft commission" will recommend to
deal with the threat the MX poses to Soviet ICBMs?
Perhaps that is their test of "national will." In any case, it
will probably not bring peace or strength to America.
