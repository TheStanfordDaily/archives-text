We've
Hatched
a New
Store!
For six years Peninsulans have
shopped at Dealin Down in Palo
Alto for fine quality goose down
comforters, garments and
sleeping bags as well as cotton
and wool clothing, rugged
footwear and gear for travel or
backpacking. Now we've opened
a store at 2136 University
Avenue in Berkeley. We know
you're part of the Peninsula
I lock, but if you ever leave the
nest for Berkeley you'll be glad
to know there's a Dealin' Down
there too.
