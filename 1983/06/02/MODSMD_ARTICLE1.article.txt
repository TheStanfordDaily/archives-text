Sally Ride will be the first American woman in space
when the seventh space shuttle mission blasts off on
June 18.
Due to the proximity of the flight, Ride was not avail
able for comment. However, Joyce Ride, her mother,
said Sally has no special concerns or worries regarding
the flight at this point and anticipates it will be "a lot of
fun."
"I imagine she's excited," said Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon who first met Ride while Dean of Admis
sions at Swarthmore, where Ride began her under
graduate education.
After two years at Swarthmore, Ride transferred to

Stanford, receiving bachelor degrees in English and
physics in 1973. She then continued her work in physics,
earning a masters in 1975 and a Ph.D. in 1978.
Ride's space career began in 1977 when she saw a
NASA ad in the Daily recruiting women for the astronaut
training program. That year, there were 8078 applicants,
including 1500 women, for 35 places.
In 1978, Ride was admitted to theastronaut-in-training
program. She is the third person from Stanford to be
admitted to the program. Others from Stanford are
Bruce McCandless, currently an electrical engineer and
navy officer, and Owen Garriott of the Radioscience
Laboratory, who spent two months aboard Skylab II in
1973.
The big break came in April 1982 when Ride received

her flight assignment aboard the seventh space shuttle.
Ride will be a mission specialist and her main duties will
be to monitor and deploy the three satellites carried in
the shuttle and to conduct experiments. The shuttle is
expected to carry a large telescope which will facilitate
the study of x-ray stars, Ride's specialty. These are stars
which give off high amounts of radiation and are difficult
to study from the earth, where they are blocked by the
atmosphere.
This assignment was probably not surprising to some
people.
Ride possesses "all the qualities good for an as
tronaut," according to Applied Physics Prof. Arthur
Walker, Ride's thesis advisor. An avid jogger and tennis
player, Ride "kept herself very fit," he said. "She was an

excellent student. She's also very self-reliant and in
charge of her own course," he added.
In addition to her academic and physical qualifica
tions, Ride's past experience as a capsule communicator
may have been another factor in favor of her selection. A
capsule communicator serves as a go-between as
tronaut, communicating with the shuttle from Mission
Control in Houston.
Ride's flight was originally scheduled for April but was
delayed. Hargadon reported that he spoke to Ride at that
time and she assessed the problems delaying the shuttle
as "like a flat tire" and "no big deal. I imagine they were
prepared in April," he said, adding that, "She's probably
anxious to get on with it."
Betore she leaves, though, Ride
will be presented with a few memen
tos of Stanford. Hargadon will travel
to Florida to give her a copy of Prof.
Robert Wagoner's book "Cosmic
Horizons' and a scroll containing
signatures and notes from people in
the Stanford community. As of Sun
day, Hargadon did not know how
many signatures had been collected.
there are some rather amusing
comments," he said, citing "Ride
on" as an example.
While Ride will not be the first
woman in space (Valentine Teresh
kova of the Soviet Union flew alone
in the Vostok 6 space capsule for 71
hours in June 1963). people seem to
view her going into space as a big
deal.
