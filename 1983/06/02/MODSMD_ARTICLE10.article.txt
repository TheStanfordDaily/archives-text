## Husband-wife University pairs: two is better than one 
### NANCY WILLIAMS 
Two associate professors in the An
thropology Department, George and
Jane Collier, have taken advantage of
their sabbatical year to research in
Spain together. Ihe couple once
taught an anthropology course to
gether here, and this past fall at Stan
ford in Florence they combined to
teach a law course.
The Colliers do not represent an
unusual situation: they provide one
of the many examples of husband
wife pairs who work for the Univer
sity. According to Robert Parker, di
rector of personnel, the large number
of married couples offer advantages
to the University in recruiting produc
tive faculty and staff. Spouses find that
their common employment produces
financial benefits and generally en
hances the quality of their marriage.
The University's current policy on
husband-wife pairs allows for full re
cruitment of valuable professors, lec
turers and staff. Parker stressed that
Stanford does not discriminate
against an applicant simply because
the applicant's spouse already works
under contract. Married couples par
ticipating in the same research project
has been happening for years. "We
need all of the talented people we can
get here," he said.
Parker noted a change within the
last decade in that a nepotism policy
used to forbid the employment of
spouses in the same department or
school. "Typically it was the woman
who was excluded under the
nepotism policy," he said, a practice
that hampered the recruitment of val
uable individuals since, "the woman
may be just as competent if not more
competent."
Currently, the University Policy of
Employment of Regular Staff states
that a husband-wife pair working
"within an organizational unit is per
mitted with approval from the head of
the unit," provided that one spouse
does not control either the salary or
promotion of the other. A similar pol
icy governs faculty members and has
encouraged the hiring of some fruitful
research and teaching combinations.
Senior Research Associate Anne
Ehrlich and Prof. Paul Ehrlich have
been working successfully in the
Biological Sciences Department for2o
years. Every summer the couple re
searches together on field trips in
Colorado.
Prof. George Spindler and Lecturer
Louise Spindler research and teach
together for the Anthropology De
partment. They view their marriage
and their relationship as enhancing
their professional work. Possessing
an "interchangeable routine" with his
wife, George Spindler noted that

"there's nothing we don't collabo
rate on." He jokinglv explained that
even at home they have a give-and
take relationship; if one begins pre
paring a roast for dinner and happens
to leave the room, the other automat
ically takes the roast out of the oven.
The Spindlers transform this
domestic routine into a productive re
search team and an enchanting mode
of teaching. They accomplish a "good
portion" of their field work together.
Louise Spindler explained that differ
ing female and male perspectives
were beneficial in their projects with a
town in southern Germany and with
the Menominee Indians.
Like the Ehrlichs, the couple does
much of their research during the
summer, combining field work and
vacation into one. The pair owns sev
eral boats. George Spindler said that,
while adrift on the water, one fishes
while the other rests. "Our leisure
time has some of this character of ex
change," he concluded.
Currently se m i - ret i r e d, the
Spindlers teach an introductory an
thropology course, American Cul
ture, and a graduate seminar
Cultural Transmissions. During con
versations the couple maintains a
steady flow of dialogue, one develop
ing and completing a thought and the
other smoothly interjecting the next
point. In the classroom they utilize a
similar style to develop ideas to
gether. Louise Spindler said, "We talk
back and forth and discuss things."
According to George Spindler, this
style of teaching offers several advan
tages. It makes teaching more relax
ingand provides a greater perspective
on the lecture's direction, for one can
step back and observe while the other
talks, he said. The two present a more
thorough lecture and develop indi
vidual points more fully. "The reper
toire from which we draw is at least
double," he said.
Besides providing the University
with valuable teaching and research
ing pairs, spouses also realize some
personal benefits. Mutual employ
ment at Stanford increases the cohe
siveness of both home and social life.
Lecturer Lyn Carlsmith and Prof. Mer
ril Carlsmith of the Psychology De
partment work in different areas of
their field. Vet, as Lyn Carlsmith jok
ingly explained, their offices on the
same floor enable them to see their
son occasionally. "Our oldest son is a
freshman now at Stanford," she said.
"He comes visiting us at work now
instead of at home."
Sarah Thomas, manager of library
coordination, who is married to Peter
Hirtle, a lecturer for the Values,
Technology and Society program,
views the proximity of her and her

husband's workplace as enriching
their marriage. "We make the point of
seeing each other a lot," she said. "I
don't think that would be possible if I
worked in San lose." Thomas also
noted a smoother quality of conversa
tion between her and her husband
since "there's less need to translate
what's going on." She concluded that
the congruence of their professional
lives "increases our sense of compan
ionship."
Elizabeth Kaplan, the administrator
of the Communication Department,
also emphasized the importance of
Stanford in the home life. "We talk
about the University all the time," she
said. Kaplan, married to Law Prof.
John Kaplan, said that her position
also enhances her and her husband's
social life. Before beginning work in
1980, she occasionally viewed herself
as on the fringes of University life. "I
feel as much as part of the community
now as he is," she said.
Virginia Mann, the program assis
tant for VTS, also concluded that her
position improves her social life by
allowing her to interact more at
alumni and University functions. "I
have some familiarity with under
graduate education because of the
students I come into contact with on
my job," she said.
Husband-wife pairs working for
Stanford also reap financial benefits
because they can share transporta
tion. Many drive together to work,
especially during the winter months.
Virginia Mann lauded the great con
venience of working for the Univer
sity. "I don't have to commute," she
said.
For Prof. Clifford Barnett, the
chairman of the Anthropology De
partment, and Zelda Barnett, a social
worker at the Stanford Hospital, a de
cision to bike to work together has
produced a fascinating hobby. Bar
nett explained that "my wife grew up
in New York City, and her father used
to say, 'No kid of mine is going to ride
a bicycle.' " Barnett's desire to bike to
work together posed a problem, since
his wife had learned later in life and
did not feel entirely comfortable on a
bicycle. "The only way I could get her
on a bike was to buy a tandem," he
concluded.
The couple has now been pedaling
to work for eight years. Beginning on
a Schwinn tandem, they have
graduated to a "fancy 15-speeder."
During the summers they tour to
gether on their tandem.
In the midst of financial and per
sonal benefits, husband-wife pairs
encounter perhaps only one signifi
cant problem: a slight loss of identity.
Prof. Kaplan lightly admitted that
"whenever I go to the Communica

tion Department, I'm a consort."
Prof. Barnett reminisced of being
labeled "Zelda's husband" at the Uni
versity hospital.
The lack of identity that stems from
too close association of married
couples can become an awkward situ
ation for those who have different last
names. Sarah Thomas explained that
when she married Peter Hirtle, "I was
29 years old, and I felt that I had been
Sarah Thomas for quite a long time."
She sensed a degree of "artificiality"
in changing her name.
Vet their differing surnames cause a
small amount of confusion. "There
are occasions when people assume
that his name is Peter Thomas instead
of Peter Hirtle," Thomas explained,
admitting that she has encountered
the same mix-up. However, she can

correct this problem easily, and
Thomas cheerfully concludes that, "I
don't feel too much of a loss of iden
tity."
Despite these occasional confu
sions and losses of identity, the
husband-wife pairs who work for
Stanford provide an impressive
number of benefits. By allowing
spouses to work in the same depart
ment, the University maintains the
opportunity to recruit some dynamic
teaching and researching pairs. The
couples themselves note the advan
tages in transportation and also a
sense of completeness in home and
social life.
The combination of one spouse in
administration and the other in faculty
not only increases the domestic con
tinuity, but also adds a bit of spice to

home life. Marlene Wine, the special
assistant to the president, is married
to Associate Prof. Jeffrey Wine of the
Psychology Department. "He's as
sociated with the faculty, and I work
for the administration," she said."lt's
a very interesting blend."
Jeffrey Wine elaborated that the
"interesting blend" occasionally re
sults in a fair amount of teasing. He
said that he frequently complains to
his wife about the administration's ac
tivities. Recently, after driving to
work, he was unable to locate a park
ing space. Upon returning home that
night he questioned his wife, "What's
the administration doing about park
ing?" Admitting that he has "a deep
and fundamental respect for the ad
ministration and for her work," Wine
said he can "carp about trivial things."

domestic routine into a productive re
search team and an enchanting mode
of teaching. They accomplish a "good
portion" of their field work together.
Louise Spindler explained that differ
ing female and male perspectives
were beneficial in their projects with a
town in southern Germany and with
the Menominee Indians.
Like the Ehrlichs, the couple does
much of their research during the
summer, combining field work and
vacation into one. The pair owns sev
eral boats. George Spindler said that,
while adrift on the water, one fishes
while the other rests. "Our leisure
time has some of this character of ex
change," he concluded.
Currently se m i - ret i r e d, the
Spindlers teach an introductory an
thropology course, American Cul
ture, and a graduate seminar
Cultural Transmissions. During con
versations the couple maintains a
steady flow of dialogue, one develop
ing and completing a thought and the
other smoothly interjecting the next
point. In the classroom they utilize a
similar style to develop ideas to
gether. Louise Spindler said, "We talk
back and forth and discuss things."
According to George Spindler, this
style of teaching offers several advan
tages. It makes teaching more relax
ingand provides a greater perspective
on the lecture's direction, for one can
step back and observe while the other
talks, he said. The two present a more
thorough lecture and develop indi
vidual points more fully. "The reper
toire from which we draw is at least
double," he said.
Besides providing the University
with valuable teaching and research
ing pairs, spouses also realize some
personal benefits. Mutual employ
ment at Stanford increases the cohe
siveness of both home and social life.
Lecturer Lyn Carlsmith and Prof. Mer
ril Carlsmith of the Psychology De
partment work in different areas of
their field. Vet, as Lyn Carlsmith jok
ingly explained, their offices on the
same floor enable them to see their
son occasionally. "Our oldest son is a
freshman now at Stanford," she said.
"He comes visiting us at work now
instead of at home."
Sarah Thomas, manager of library
coordination, who is married to Peter
Hirtle, a lecturer for the Values,
Technology and Society program,
views the proximity of her and her

husband's workplace as enriching
their marriage. "We make the point of
seeing each other a lot," she said. "I
don't think that would be possible if I
worked in San lose." Thomas also
noted a smoother quality of conversa
tion between her and her husband
since "there's less need to translate
what's going on." She concluded that
the congruence of their professional
lives "increases our sense of compan
ionship."
Elizabeth Kaplan, the administrator
of the Communication Department,
also emphasized the importance of
Stanford in the home life. "We talk
about the University all the time," she
said. Kaplan, married to Law Prof.
John Kaplan, said that her position
also enhances her and her husband's
social life. Before beginning work in
1980, she occasionally viewed herself
as on the fringes of University life. "I
feel as much as part of the community
now as he is," she said.
Virginia Mann, the program assis
tant for VTS, also concluded that her
position improves her social life by
allowing her to interact more at
alumni and University functions. "I
have some familiarity with under
graduate education because of the
students I come into contact with on
my job," she said.
Husband-wife pairs working for
Stanford also reap financial benefits
because they can share transporta
tion. Many drive together to work,
especially during the winter months.
Virginia Mann lauded the great con
venience of working for the Univer
sity. "I don't have to commute," she
said.
For Prof. Clifford Barnett, the
chairman of the Anthropology De
partment, and Zelda Barnett, a social
worker at the Stanford Hospital, a de
cision to bike to work together has
produced a fascinating hobby. Bar
nett explained that "my wife grew up
in New York City, and her father used
to say, 'No kid of mine is going to ride
a bicycle.' " Barnett's desire to bike to
work together posed a problem, since
his wife had learned later in life and
did not feel entirely comfortable on a
bicycle. "The only way I could get her
on a bike was to buy a tandem," he
concluded.
The couple has now been pedaling
to work for eight years. Beginning on
a Schwinn tandem, they have
graduated to a "fancy 15-speeder."
During the summers they tour to
gether on their tandem.
In the midst of financial and per
sonal benefits, husband-wife pairs
encounter perhaps only one signifi
cant problem: a slight loss of identity.
Prof. Kaplan lightly admitted that
"whenever I go to the Communica

tion Department, I'm a consort."
Prof. Barnett reminisced of being
labeled "Zelda's husband" at the Uni
versity hospital.
The lack of identity that stems from
too close association of married
couples can become an awkward situ
ation for those who have different last
names. Sarah Thomas explained that
when she married Peter Hirtle, "I was
29 years old, and I felt that I had been
Sarah Thomas for quite a long time."
She sensed a degree of "artificiality"
in changing her name.
Vet their differing surnames cause a
small amount of confusion. "There
are occasions when people assume
that his name is Peter Thomas instead
of Peter Hirtle," Thomas explained,
admitting that she has encountered
the same mix-up. However, she can

correct this problem easily, and
Thomas cheerfully concludes that, "I
don't feel too much of a loss of iden
tity."
Despite these occasional confu
sions and losses of identity, the
husband-wife pairs who work for
Stanford provide an impressive
number of benefits. By allowing
spouses to work in the same depart
ment, the University maintains the
opportunity to recruit some dynamic
teaching and researching pairs. The
couples themselves note the advan
tages in transportation and also a
sense of completeness in home and
social life.
The combination of one spouse in
administration and the other in faculty
not only increases the domestic con
tinuity, but also adds a bit of spice to

home life. Marlene Wine, the special
assistant to the president, is married
to Associate Prof. Jeffrey Wine of the
Psychology Department. "He's as
sociated with the faculty, and I work
for the administration," she said."lt's
a very interesting blend."
Jeffrey Wine elaborated that the
"interesting blend" occasionally re
sults in a fair amount of teasing. He
said that he frequently complains to
his wife about the administration's ac
tivities. Recently, after driving to
work, he was unable to locate a park
ing space. Upon returning home that
night he questioned his wife, "What's
the administration doing about park
ing?" Admitting that he has "a deep
and fundamental respect for the ad
ministration and for her work," Wine
said he can "carp about trivial things."

Two associate professors in the An
thropology Department, George and
Jane Collier, have taken advantage of
their sabbatical year to research in
Spain together. Ihe couple once
taught an anthropology course to
gether here, and this past fall at Stan
ford in Florence they combined to
teach a law course.
The Colliers do not represent an
unusual situation: they provide one
of the many examples of husband
wife pairs who work for the Univer
sity. According to Robert Parker, di
rector of personnel, the large number
of married couples offer advantages
to the University in recruiting produc
tive faculty and staff. Spouses find that
their common employment produces
financial benefits and generally en
hances the quality of their marriage.
The University's current policy on
husband-wife pairs allows for full re
cruitment of valuable professors, lec
turers and staff. Parker stressed that
Stanford does not discriminate
against an applicant simply because
the applicant's spouse already works
under contract. Married couples par
ticipating in the same research project
has been happening for years. "We
need all of the talented people we can
get here," he said.
Parker noted a change within the
last decade in that a nepotism policy
used to forbid the employment of
spouses in the same department or
school. "Typically it was the woman
who was excluded under the
nepotism policy," he said, a practice
that hampered the recruitment of val
uable individuals since, "the woman
may be just as competent if not more
competent."
Currently, the University Policy of
Employment of Regular Staff states
that a husband-wife pair working
"within an organizational unit is per
mitted with approval from the head of
the unit," provided that one spouse
does not control either the salary or
promotion of the other. A similar pol
icy governs faculty members and has
encouraged the hiring of some fruitful
research and teaching combinations.
Senior Research Associate Anne
Ehrlich and Prof. Paul Ehrlich have
been working successfully in the
Biological Sciences Department for2o
years. Every summer the couple re
searches together on field trips in
Colorado.
Prof. George Spindler and Lecturer
Louise Spindler research and teach
together for the Anthropology De
partment. They view their marriage
and their relationship as enhancing
their professional work. Possessing
an "interchangeable routine" with his
wife, George Spindler noted that

"there's nothing we don't collabo

ionship."
Elizabeth Kaplan, the administrator
of the Communication Department,
also emphasized the importance of
Stanford in the home life. "We talk
about the University all the time," she
said. Kaplan, married to Law Prof.
John Kaplan, said that her position
also enhances her and her husband's
social life. Before beginning work in
1980, she occasionally viewed herself
as on the fringes of University life. "I
feel as much as part of the community
now as he is," she said.
Virginia Mann, the program assis
tant for VTS, also concluded that her
position improves her social life by
allowing her to interact more at
alumni and University functions. "I
have some familiarity with under
graduate education because of the
students I come into contact with on
my job," she said.
Husband-wife pairs working for
Stanford also reap financial benefits
because they can share transporta
tion. Many drive together to work,
especially during the winter months.
Virginia Mann lauded the great con
venience of working for the Univer
sity. "I don't have to commute," she
said.
For Prof. Clifford Barnett, the
chairman of the Anthropology De
partment, and Zelda Barnett, a social
worker at the Stanford Hospital, a de
cision to bike to work together has
produced a fascinating hobby. Bar
nett explained that "my wife grew up
in New York City, and her father used
to say, 'No kid of mine is going to ride
a bicycle.' " Barnett's desire to bike to
work together posed a problem, since
his wife had learned later in life and
did not feel entirely comfortable on a
bicycle. "The only way I could get her
on a bike was to buy a tandem," he
concluded.
The couple has now been pedaling
to work for eight years. Beginning on
a Schwinn tandem, they have
graduated to a "fancy 15-speeder."
During the summers they tour to
gether on their tandem.
In the midst of financial and per
sonal benefits, husband-wife pairs
encounter perhaps only one signifi
cant problem: a slight loss of identity.
Prof. Kaplan lightly admitted that
"whenever I go to the Communica

tion Department, I'm a consort."
Prof. Barnett reminisced of being
labeled "Zelda's husband" at the Uni
versity hospital.
The lack of identity that stems from
too close association of married
couples can become an awkward situ
ation for those who have different last
names. Sarah Thomas explained that
when she married Peter Hirtle, "I was
29 years old, and I felt that I had been
Sarah Thomas for quite a long time."
She sensed a degree of "artificiality"
in changing her name.
Vet their differing surnames cause a
small amount of confusion. "There
are occasions when people assume
that his name is Peter Thomas instead
of Peter Hirtle," Thomas explained,
admitting that she has encountered
the same mix-up. However, she can

correct this problem easily, and
Thomas cheerfully concludes that, "I
don't feel too much of a loss of iden
tity."
Despite these occasional confu
sions and losses of identity, the
husband-wife pairs who work for
Stanford provide an impressive
number of benefits. By allowing
spouses to work in the same depart
ment, the University maintains the
opportunity to recruit some dynamic
teaching and researching pairs. The
couples themselves note the advan
tages in transportation and also a
sense of completeness in home and
social life.
The combination of one spouse in
administration and the other in faculty
not only increases the domestic con
tinuity, but also adds a bit of spice to

home life. Marlene Wine, the special
assistant to the president, is married
to Associate Prof. Jeffrey Wine of the
Psychology Department. "He's as
sociated with the faculty, and I work
for the administration," she said."lt's
a very interesting blend."
Jeffrey Wine elaborated that the
"interesting blend" occasionally re
sults in a fair amount of teasing. He
said that he frequently complains to
his wife about the administration's ac
tivities. Recently, after driving to
work, he was unable to locate a park
ing space. Upon returning home that
night he questioned his wife, "What's
the administration doing about park
ing?" Admitting that he has "a deep
and fundamental respect for the ad
ministration and for her work," Wine
said he can "carp about trivial things."

Two associate professors in the An
thropology Department, George and
Jane Collier, have taken advantage of
their sabbatical year to research in
Spain together. Ihe couple once
taught an anthropology course to
gether here, and this past fall at Stan
ford in Florence they combined to
teach a law course.
The Colliers do not represent an
unusual situation: they provide one
of the many examples of husband
wife pairs who work for the Univer
sity. According to Robert Parker, di
rector of personnel, the large number
of married couples offer advantages
to the University in recruiting produc
tive faculty and staff. Spouses find that
their common employment produces
financial benefits and generally en
hances the quality of their marriage.
The University's current policy on
husband-wife pairs allows for full re
cruitment of valuable professors, lec
turers and staff. Parker stressed that
Stanford does not discriminate
against an applicant simply because
the applicant's spouse already works
under contract. Married couples par
ticipating in the same research project
has been happening for years. "We
need all of the talented people we can
get here," he said.
Parker noted a change within the
last decade in that a nepotism policy
used to forbid the employment of
spouses in the same department or
school. "Typically it was the woman
who was excluded under the
nepotism policy," he said, a practice
that hampered the recruitment of val
uable individuals since, "the woman
may be just as competent if not more
competent."
Currently, the University Policy of
Employment of Regular Staff states
that a husband-wife pair working
"within an organizational unit is per
mitted with approval from the head of
the unit," provided that one spouse
does not control either the salary or
promotion of the other. A similar pol
icy governs faculty members and has
encouraged the hiring of some fruitful
research and teaching combinations.
Senior Research Associate Anne
Ehrlich and Prof. Paul Ehrlich have
been working successfully in the
Biological Sciences Department for2o
years. Every summer the couple re
searches together on field trips in
Colorado.
Prof. George Spindler and Lecturer
Louise Spindler research and teach
together for the Anthropology De
partment. They view their marriage
and their relationship as enhancing
their professional work. Possessing
an "interchangeable routine" with his
wife, George Spindler noted that

"there's nothing we don't collabo
rate on." He jokinglv explained that
even at home they have a give-and
take relationship; if one begins pre
paring a roast for dinner and happens
to leave the room, the other automat
ically takes the roast out of the oven.
The Spindlers transform this
domestic routine into a productive re
search team and an enchanting mode
of teaching. They accomplish a "good
portion" of their field work together.
Louise Spindler explained that differ
ing female and male perspectives
were beneficial in their projects with a
town in southern Germany and with
the Menominee Indians.
Like the Ehrlichs, the couple does
much of their research during the
summer, combining field work and
vacation into one. The pair owns sev
eral boats. George Spindler said that,
while adrift on the water, one fishes
while the other rests. "Our leisure
time has some of this character of ex
change," he concluded.
Currently se m i - ret i r e d, the
Spindlers teach an introductory an
thropology course, American Cul
ture, and a graduate seminar
Cultural Transmissions. During con
versations the couple maintains a
steady flow of dialogue, one develop
ing and completing a thought and the
other smoothly interjecting the next
point. In the classroom they utilize a
similar style to develop ideas to
gether. Louise Spindler said, "We talk
back and forth and discuss things."
According to George Spindler, this
style of teaching offers several advan
tages. It makes teaching more relax
ingand provides a greater perspective
on the lecture's direction, for one can
step back and observe while the other
talks, he said. The two present a more
thorough lecture and develop indi
vidual points more fully. "The reper
toire from which we draw is at least
double," he said.
Besides providing the University
with valuable teaching and research
ing pairs, spouses also realize some
personal benefits. Mutual employ
ment at Stanford increases the cohe
siveness of both home and social life.
Lecturer Lyn Carlsmith and Prof. Mer
ril Carlsmith of the Psychology De
partment work in different areas of
their field. Vet, as Lyn Carlsmith jok
ingly explained, their offices on the
same floor enable them to see their
son occasionally. "Our oldest son is a
freshman now at Stanford," she said.
"He comes visiting us at work now
instead of at home."
Sarah Thomas, manager of library
coordination, who is married to Peter
Hirtle, a lecturer for the Values,
Technology and Society program,
views the proximity of her and her

husband's workplace as enriching
their marriage. "We make the point of
seeing each other a lot," she said. "I
don't think that would be possible if I
worked in San lose." Thomas also
noted a smoother quality of conversa
tion between her and her husband
since "there's less need to translate
what's going on." She concluded that
the congruence of their professional
lives "increases our sense of compan
ionship."
Elizabeth Kaplan, the administrator
of the Communication Department,
also emphasized the importance of
Stanford in the home life. "We talk
about the University all the time," she
said. Kaplan, married to Law Prof.
John Kaplan, said that her position
also enhances her and her husband's
