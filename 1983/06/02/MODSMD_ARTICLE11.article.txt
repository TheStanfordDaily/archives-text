# OPINIONS
## The
						Stanford Daily Editor's goodbye 
### 
The Daily is a journalism laboratory.
We experiment, trying new graphic and story
ideas. Some fail miserably (I won't remind you
which ones!). But the vast majority indicate that
innovation — in the best spirit of the Silicon
Valley — pays off. New sections have included
the sports spotlight, profiles, larger photos and
the revival of Bug Me, Science and Environ
ment.
Any organization — especially the Daily — is
only as good as its staff. More than 100 students
work as a team to put out the paper. (I can't
resist a plug: everyone is welcome and it's never
too late to pick up an assignment.)
I'd like to thank my "lab partners" (i.e.,
everyone in the staff box and the countless
others who are writers, photogs, artists and
sales reps.) And special thanks to my late-night
companions — Jan, my successor Kristen "New
Wave Elf".Xhristopher, David "Late-Breaking
Story" Azrin, Julie K. (copy editor extraor
dinaire), photo, the new staffers, typesetting, K.
Halbo, Heather and Mike "Bug Me" Hale (au
thor of my favorite section and an unsung hero).
I'll never forget anyone here, but these people
have gone beyond the call of duty and have

been friends and/or Daily workaholics, putting
out the little extra that Stanford's all about.
I realize this thank you section is violating
journalisitic rules of conciseness, but. . .I have
to thank you, our "lab teachers," the 23,000
members of the Stanford community. Whether
you're one of those who have phoned in a tip or
one who has complained, "Why do you run
those 'SUBMIT' ads on the opinions page if
you're not going to print my letter?" We're al
waysgratefulforyourfeedback; itmeansyou're
reading the Daily.
The Daily provides tremendous opportunities
for writing, meeting the people who make Stan
ford tick and interacting with an energizing,
funny, dedicated group of people. It's been a
privilege.
Thank you. J
Karen Springen
Editor
P.S. Since it's been almost half a year — don't
forget to recycle the Daily!
