It is dusk, and it's getting cooler as young Steve
Skywalker sits in a candle-lit cave just beneath the "dish "
in the Stanford foothills, waiting for Obi-Don Kenobi to
return from his evening run. Young Skywalker enter
tains himself by slicing passing cows into hamburger
meat with his light-saber. Just as the last traces of light
disappear from the sky, Obi-Don Kenobi appears at the
entrance to the cave, wearing his sacred robe and his
sacred Nike running shoes.
"Ah, young Skywalker. I knew you would be here."
"Did you feel my presence?"
"No, I smelled your aftershave. Do us all a favor and
lose that stuff, okay?"
"Yes, Obi-Don."
"What's wrong, Steve? You look upset and you didn't
laugh at my joke."
"I don't know , Obi-Don. I guess I'm feeling a little
depressed."
"But why? You're graduating in a few days. You made
it! You've got a degree from one of the most prestigious
universities in the world, if I do say so myself. You're
young, healthy, reasonably intelligent, you've got a Mas
terCard — my boy, you've the world by its tail!"
"Yeah, but that's kind of an awkward position to be in
if the world decides to take a seat."
"Huh?"
"Oh, I don't know. It's just that I'm notsure whatto do
next. I mean, I've got my degree, so now what? Should I
go to law school? Should I get a job? Where should I live?
What should. . ."
"Slow down, Skywalker. Relax. Let me make you a
sandwich. You like corned beef?"
"Fine."
"You're a thinking man, my boy, and that's good. But
sometimes you think too much. You know, there's an
old Jedi saying that goes, 'Whatever will be, will be, the
future's not ours to see.'"
"I thought Doris Day said that."
"So what? She happens to be a very intelligent lady.
Anyway, there's another old Jedi saying that goes, 'You
can lead a horse to water, but you can't fit an elephant in
a bathtub.'"
"What has that got to do with anything?"
"Well, nothing, but it's kind of catchy and I like it. You
want regular mustard or the hot stuff?"
"Regular. You don't understand, Obi-Don. Everyone,
including you, told me that I should get a major that I

like, I took classes from a lot of different departments, I
studied hard . . . now, four years and $60,000 later, I
don't feel like I have any sense of direction."
"This way is north, this way is south, this. . ."
"That's not what I mean. I just feel like no matter what
I decide to do, I'll be missing out on something that
could be better. Sometimes I wish I had taken 180 units
of computer science classes. Everybody says that's the
field of the '80s."
"Who says? Time magazine? Sure, you take 50 com
puter science classes, you get yourself a nice job in
Silicon Valley. So what happens if it turns out that you
don't like computers as much as you thought you did?
You can't quit — you're not qualified to do anything
else. Even if you like your job, what do you talk about at
cocktail parties? Microchips? You don't know anything
about literature, history, current events, art, music —
good luck picking up girls, you know what I mean? Ah,
but with a liberal arts education, you're like this
sandwich: you've got your corned beef, your rye bread,
your mustard and your pickle. No part is that great by
itself — especially the mustard. Put them all together,
though, and you've got yourself a sandwich that any deli
in the nation would be proud to wrap white paper
around and sell for $3.50."
"Okay. So I've got a well-rounded liberal arts educa
tion. I still feel a little bit like Dustin Hoffman."
"Hey, wait a minute, Skywalker! You're not thinking
about putting on a dress, are you?"
"No, no, I'm not talking about Tootsie. I mean The
Graduate.. Remember? I don't know what to do with my
life."
"Then go to law school. Or get a job. Try something. If
you like it, great. If not, you try something else. Just
think of your life as a huge buffet. If the salmon's no
good, try the pickled-herring."
"But how do I know what to try first?"
"Trust your instincts, Steve. Feel the Force — let your
self go! C'mon, close your eyes and trust your feelings.
Do you feel anything?"
"Yes."
"The Force?!"
"No, I think it's the corned beef sandwich. Have you
got any Pepto-Bismol?"
