## Comp Sci: no need to cheat 
### 
The article "How to cheat in Comp
Sci" by Gordon Schmierer (Daily,
May 20) is erroneous and, if read as a
justification for plagiarism, thor
oughly shameful.
Schmierer states "the access to
copying ... is an unnecessary in
ducement to cheat." The easy access
to copying that he describes gener
ally does not exist: students in intro
ductory computer science classes
are given explicit directions to protect
their files from copying. The example
of fishing in the wastebasket for pa
pers to plagiarize is hardly unique to
classes that use a computer.
Schmierer states "students are ex
pected to need more time at the ter
minals than they are alloted." As
signments in computer science are
made with great care so that a prop
erly prepared student will have
ample time. (Usage information from
LOTS indicate that, on the average,
students use between 34 and 64 ter
minal hours in introductory courses.
An allotment of 80 hours is typical.)
Proper preparation is essential to
success in computer science and
many other disciplines. Unfortu
nately, there are students (and
others) who believe that using a
computer is a substitute forthinking.
These students arrive at the com
puter without a carefully designed
plan for solving their problems; they
flounder indefinitely. For these stu
dents no amount of time would be
sufficient. When a tiny number of
students resort to blatant plagiarism,
their failure to think and plan ex
tends beyond simple lack of ability in

computer science.
Schmierer's "hundreds of stu
dents have had to pack their bags for
a while," in reference to Honor Code
violations that result in suspensions,
is sophomoric hyperbole. Sally Cole,
assistant dean of judicial affairs, re
ports that in 1980-81 there were 11
completed Honor Code cases, none
involving computer science; in
1981-82 there were 12 such cases,
one from computer science. Figures
for 1982-83 are not yet available.
(Cases involving computer science
are pending.) Approximately 1600
students take introductory computer
science each year.
I agree with Schmiererthatas prac
ticed professionally, computer pro
gramming is a cooperative venture. It
is peculiar to see this sentiment jux
taposed with his explication of
methods to plagiarize an entire pro
gram. However, I must take issue
with Schmierer's statement "it is il
legal to use even a small procedure
from a friend's program." A limited
amount of properly attributed assist
ance is permitted.
There are faults in our computer
systems and we are working on a
variety of remedies. But systems, no
matter how perfect, cannot be and
should not be the guardians of our
honor. It is snivelling cowardice to
use "the system" to excuse the tiny
minority who fail to act as thoughtful
and ethical human beings.

The article regarding Kappa Alpha
Theta's recognition ("Kappa Alpha
Theta gets the nod: University grants
recognition,"Daily, May 19) is of
concern to me and other members of
Phi dueteron for we feel it poorly
presented Theta's conduct prior to
recognition.
Members may have been seen at
Tresidder talking about Theta's, but
it was not a direct attempt to violate
any University policies. All regular
and formal chapter meetings have
been held off-campus. Our long
standing rental of an apartment at
Oak Creek attests to this fact.
Because of our rental, we have the
privilege of using one of Oak Creek's
facilities where we conduct weekly
chapter meetings.
We apologize for having rented
the boathouse. We had assumed that
its rental was not in violation of Uni
versity policy because it was not
"owned" by the University. How
ever, we rented it under the name of
Kappa Alpha Theta, not an assumed
name.
We, of Kappa Alpha Theta, are
proud of our achievement and
thankful for the privilege of recogni
tion. We do realize that recognition
is not a privilege to be abused. We
shall continue to uphold the stan
dards of the University and we look
forward to a prosperous future as an
integral part of the Stanford commu
nity.

LOTS indicate that, on the average,
students use between 34 and 64 ter
minal hours in introductory courses.
An allotment of 80 hours is typical.)
Proper preparation is essential to
success in computer science and
many other disciplines. Unfortu
nately, there are students (and
others) who believe that using a
computer is a substitute forthinking.
These students arrive at the com
puter without a carefully designed
plan for solving their problems; they
flounder indefinitely. For these stu
dents no amount of time would be
sufficient. When a tiny number of
students resort to blatant plagiarism,
their failure to think and plan ex
tends beyond simple lack of ability in

computer science.
Schmierer's "hundreds of stu
dents have had to pack their bags for
a while," in reference to Honor Code
violations that result in suspensions,
is sophomoric hyperbole. Sally Cole,
assistant dean of judicial affairs, re
ports that in 1980-81 there were 11
completed Honor Code cases, none
involving computer science; in
1981-82 there were 12 such cases,
one from computer science. Figures
for 1982-83 are not yet available.
(Cases involving computer science
are pending.) Approximately 1600
students take introductory computer
science each year.
I agree with Schmiererthatas prac
ticed professionally, computer pro
gramming is a cooperative venture. It
is peculiar to see this sentiment jux
taposed with his explication of
methods to plagiarize an entire pro
gram. However, I must take issue
with Schmierer's statement "it is il
legal to use even a small procedure
from a friend's program." A limited
amount of properly attributed assist
ance is permitted.
There are faults in our computer
systems and we are working on a
variety of remedies. But systems, no
matter how perfect, cannot be and
should not be the guardians of our
honor. It is snivelling cowardice to
use "the system" to excuse the tiny
minority who fail to act as thoughtful
and ethical human beings.

Sorority story
The article regarding Kappa Alpha
Theta's recognition ("Kappa Alpha
Theta gets the nod: University grants
recognition,"Daily, May 19) is of
concern to me and other members of
Phi dueteron for we feel it poorly
presented Theta's conduct prior to
recognition.
Members may have been seen at
Tresidder talking about Theta's, but
it was not a direct attempt to violate
any University policies. All regular
and formal chapter meetings have
been held off-campus. Our long
standing rental of an apartment at
Oak Creek attests to this fact.
Because of our rental, we have the
privilege of using one of Oak Creek's
facilities where we conduct weekly
chapter meetings.
We apologize for having rented
the boathouse. We had assumed that
its rental was not in violation of Uni
versity policy because it was not
"owned" by the University. How
ever, we rented it under the name of
Kappa Alpha Theta, not an assumed
name.
We, of Kappa Alpha Theta, are
proud of our achievement and
thankful for the privilege of recogni
tion. We do realize that recognition
is not a privilege to be abused. We
shall continue to uphold the stan
dards of the University and we look
forward to a prosperous future as an
integral part of the Stanford commu
nity.
