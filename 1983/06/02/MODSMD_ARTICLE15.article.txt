## To prevent the arms race 
### 
Today, the nuclear arms race poses
an unprecedented threatto mankind
that has become the central political,
social and moral issue of our time.
Our means of eliminating this threat
must come quickly and surely for we
have limited time and little room for
trial and error. The advent of nuclear
weapons marked a new age in
political-military affairs for which we
were not prepared. In 1946, Bernard
Brodie wrote, "Thus far, the chief
purpose of our military establish
ment has been to win wars. From
now on, its chief purpose must be to
avert them."
In seeking to avert war, however,
our military establishment has done
little to prevent war; rather, it has
vigorously prepared for war in order
to assure the Soviets that any first
strike on their part would be met
with an unacceptable retaliatory
blow. It is the great paradox of our
age that the largest accumulation of
destructive potential ever seen on
earth has created a balance of terror
which has deterred both the United
States and the Soviet Union from
using nuclear weapons.
Many critics of deterrence find its
irony disturbing and lacking in any
sound notion of security. Others
argue that deterrence only buys time
and is not a lasting solution for
peace. Although it has kept the
peace for the last 37 yeari. -"ill it en
sure peace indefinitely? Ti cer
tainty behind this question s
that we must pursue a different ap
proach regarding the threat with
which we live.
Clearly, our ultimate goal must be
to prevent nuclear destruction rather
than simply to avert it if we wish to
live in a truly safe world. There are
two major paths to a future of secu
rity. Each path would take decades
and tremendous effort to reverse.
One option is to create a ballistic
missile defense system that, as Presi
dent Reagan envisions, will forever
render nuclear weapons "impo
tent." The other choice is to live with
deterrence as we endeavor to reduce
our armaments until they no longer
pose a threat.
The first path will require
technological might and the second
will require powerful political will. In
the history of arms control we have
had an abundance of the former and
a dire shortage of the latter. For this
reason, we may be inclined to pursue
what seems to be a more likely pos
sibility â€” that of a technological solu
tion. But this would mean a tremen
dous mistake of once again letting
our technology guide our politics in
stead of the reverse.
Reagan's recent ballistic missile
defense proposal is an example of
the belief that a technological "fix"
can and should solve a deeply politi
cal problem. However, technology
should not guide political action, and
further, in this particular proposal, it
is unlikely that technology could
achieve what Reagan envisions, be
cause a 100 percent effective ballistic
missile defense is technically unfeas
ible. Leading physicists and defense
department experts alike have cau
tioned that such a system would be
approximately only 50 percent effec
tive. Even if such a system could
prove 95 percent effective, the
megatonnage that would leak
through in an all-out attack would be
the equivalent of 9000 times the de
structive power of the bomb drop
ped on Hiroshima. We cannot live
with such risk and uncertainty.
The history of arms control is filled
with examples of technologies which
have driven politics. MIRV technol
ogy is one of the most significant
examples. Because of a lack of politi
cal will in the SALT process, we were
unable to control a technology early
on which has later caused instability
and problems for arms control.
However, there have been instances
when our political will has overcome
driving technologies, such as the
ABM Treaty of 1972.
This treaty signified a mutual ac
ceptance that the "stability" of deter
rence rested on the vulnerability of

each side to a second strike, and that
an attempt to create a defense
against nuclear weapons would de
crease this stability. When
technologies begin to weaken a
political concept, we are mistaken to
think new technologies can com
pensate for that weakness. The cure
for a political problem must begin
with political relations and percep
tions in order for human beings to
control their problems at the most
fundamental level. Otherwise,
technology becomes the master of
man and a man becomes a slave to
his technology. In the nuclear age we
have most often been slaves.
While a ballistic missile defense is
a well-intentioned response to the
disturbing concept of mutual as
sured destruction, our greatest dan
gers are nuclear weapons them
selves and not the concept of deter
rence. Until we are rid of the
weapons themselves, we cannot
realistically hope for continued sta
bility and world security. Though de
terrence is inherently counterintui
tive, it is aimed nevertheless at secu
rity and at averting war. A nuclear
defense, on the other hand, cannot
rid us of nuclear weapons. In fact,
such a defense encourages an offen
sive arms build-up as a countermea
sure against the enemy. Thus, while
deterrence aims at averting war by
making it totally irrational, a defense
agains nuclear weapons assumes nu
clear war is plausible. It takes the
MADness out of mutual assured de
struction and leads us to believe nu
clear weapons will no longer be a
threat.
If the path toward a defense does
not offer us security, are we forced to
live in an insecure world? As deter
rence is and has been ouronly means
of creating stability, we must live
with it as long as it is our only realistic
option. Despite the insuperable dif
ficulties which the road toward arms
reduction seems to pose, in it lies our
only possible hope for genuine secu
rity. Our greatest challenge is to ap
proach this ideal realistically, to
never lose the vision of our goal or to
misperceive the reality of our obsta
cles.

There are a few guidelines and ini
tial goals we might consider. The first
is to negotiate a Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty to put a lid on new
technology. This would be the first
great step toward arms reductions.
Scientists are claiming that such a
treaty is now verifiable, but many
politicians are ignoring this fact.
Secondly, verification must not be a
block to arms reduction but must
enhance it. Uncertainty is a given
with verification. By weighing how
much the Soviets would risk in cheat
ing rather than how much we risk
with our margin of uncertainty, we
will see that what to us seems not to
be adequate verification may pose
for them too great a risk that their
cheating will be detected. Thus, we
can often accept a lower standard of
"adequate" verification without sac
rificing our security. Finally, we must
work for specific arms reductions
through repeated and persistent
negotiations and in treaties that use
clear and simple language. Time effi
ciency is crucial. We must not use
Soviet actions abroad as an excuse to
slow arms control. Such an attitude is
self-defeating; it says, "Even though
it would be in my best interest, I do
not want to improve relations with
the other party because we do not
get along."
Working toward a truly secure
world may seem nearly impossible,
yet we must continually ask: what
other options do we have that
guarantee security? Working our way
out of a balance of terror is a tremen
dously complex problem, and yet the
mutual desire to survive is quite sim
ple. In our endeavor to get there
from here, we must decide primarily
that our political will must always be
stronger than our technologies. We
have 37 years of experience to draw
from. It would be tragic not to learn
from the repeated mistakes of the
past, particularly if our next mistake
were the last mistake we could af
ford.

Clearly, our ultimate goal must be
to prevent nuclear destruction rather
than simply to avert it if we wish to
live in a truly safe world. There are
two major paths to a future of secu
rity. Each path would take decades
and tremendous effort to reverse.
One option is to create a ballistic
missile defense system that, as Presi
dent Reagan envisions, will forever
render nuclear weapons "impo
tent." The other choice is to live with
deterrence as we endeavor to reduce
our armaments until they no longer
pose a threat.
The first path will require
technological might and the second
will require powerful political will. In
the history of arms control we have
had an abundance of the former and
a dire shortage of the latter. For this
reason, we may be inclined to pursue
what seems to be a more likely pos
sibility â€” that of a technological solu
tion. But this would mean a tremen
dous mistake of once again letting
our technology guide our politics in
stead of the reverse.
Reagan's recent ballistic missile
defense proposal is an example of
the belief that a technological "fix"
can and should solve a deeply politi
cal problem. However, technology
should not guide political action, and
further, in this particular proposal, it
is unlikely that technology could
achieve what Reagan envisions, be
cause a 100 percent effective ballistic
missile defense is technically unfeas
ible. Leading physicists and defense
department experts alike have cau
tioned that such a system would be
approximately only 50 percent effec
tive. Even if such a system could
prove 95 percent effective, the
megatonnage that would leak
through in an all-out attack would be
the equivalent of 9000 times the de
structive power of the bomb drop
ped on Hiroshima. We cannot live
with such risk and uncertainty.
The history of arms control is filled
with examples of technologies which
have driven politics. MIRV technol
ogy is one of the most significant
examples. Because of a lack of politi
cal will in the SALT process, we were
unable to control a technology early
on which has later caused instability
and problems for arms control.
However, there have been instances
when our political will has overcome
driving technologies, such as the
ABM Treaty of 1972.
This treaty signified a mutual ac
ceptance that the "stability" of deter
rence rested on the vulnerability of

each side to a second strike, and that
an attempt to create a defense
against nuclear weapons would de
crease this stability. When
technologies begin to weaken a
political concept, we are mistaken to
think new technologies can com
pensate for that weakness. The cure
for a political problem must begin
with political relations and percep
tions in order for human beings to
control their problems at the most
fundamental level. Otherwise,
technology becomes the master of
man and a man becomes a slave to
his technology. In the nuclear age we
have most often been slaves.
While a ballistic missile defense is
a well-intentioned response to the
disturbing concept of mutual as
sured destruction, our greatest dan
gers are nuclear weapons them
selves and not the concept of deter
rence. Until we are rid of the
weapons themselves, we cannot
realistically hope for continued sta
bility and world security. Though de
terrence is inherently counterintui
tive, it is aimed nevertheless at secu
rity and at averting war. A nuclear
defense, on the other hand, cannot
rid us of nuclear weapons. In fact,
such a defense encourages an offen
sive arms build-up as a countermea
sure against the enemy. Thus, while
deterrence aims at averting war by
making it totally irrational, a defense
agains nuclear weapons assumes nu
clear war is plausible. It takes the
MADness out of mutual assured de
struction and leads us to believe nu
clear weapons will no longer be a
threat.
If the path toward a defense does
not offer us security, are we forced to
live in an insecure world? As deter
rence is and has been ouronly means
of creating stability, we must live
with it as long as it is our only realistic
option. Despite the insuperable dif
ficulties which the road toward arms
reduction seems to pose, in it lies our
only possible hope for genuine secu
rity. Our greatest challenge is to ap
proach this ideal realistically, to
never lose the vision of our goal or to
misperceive the reality of our obsta
cles.

There are a few guidelines and ini
tial goals we might consider. The first
is to negotiate a Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty to put a lid on new
technology. This would be the first
great step toward arms reductions.
Scientists are claiming that such a
treaty is now verifiable, but many
politicians are ignoring this fact.
Secondly, verification must not be a
block to arms reduction but must
enhance it. Uncertainty is a given
with verification. By weighing how
much the Soviets would risk in cheat
ing rather than how much we risk
with our margin of uncertainty, we
will see that what to us seems not to
be adequate verification may pose
for them too great a risk that their
cheating will be detected. Thus, we
can often accept a lower standard of
"adequate" verification without sac
rificing our security. Finally, we must
work for specific arms reductions
through repeated and persistent
negotiations and in treaties that use
clear and simple language. Time effi
ciency is crucial. We must not use
Soviet actions abroad as an excuse to
slow arms control. Such an attitude is
self-defeating; it says, "Even though
it would be in my best interest, I do
not want to improve relations with
the other party because we do not
get along."
Working toward a truly secure
world may seem nearly impossible,
yet we must continually ask: what
other options do we have that
guarantee security? Working our way
out of a balance of terror is a tremen
dously complex problem, and yet the
mutual desire to survive is quite sim
ple. In our endeavor to get there
from here, we must decide primarily
that our political will must always be
stronger than our technologies. We
have 37 years of experience to draw
from. It would be tragic not to learn
from the repeated mistakes of the
past, particularly if our next mistake
were the last mistake we could af
ford.
