# Do symbolic protests represent four years on the Farm?
## Viewpoint/Alexandra Wilson Commencement is a time to reflect on one's education 
### 
During the past weeks a coalition
of campus groups and graduating
students have been meeting to de
sign an appropriate response to Sec
retary of State George Shultz's com
mencement address. The viewpoints
that were brought to these meetings
were diverse but a common concern
was expressed about the Reagan ad
ministration's foreign policies which
repress indigenous struggles for
self-determination. Several people
have questioned why we feel so
strongly against Shultz's policies and
have challenged our apparent at
tempt to "politicize" graduation. We
would like to address these con
cerns.
As Secretary of State, Shultz is an
architect and representative of cur
rent U.S. strategies in Central
America, the Middle East, Southern
Africa and in arms negotiations. In
these areas we feel that the current
policies have been pursued with a
disregard for human rights and self
determination and instead empha
size military solutions to economic
and diplomatic problems.
In Central America, the adminis
tration continues to send millions of
U.S. tax dollars to support a military
which former U.S. ambassador to El
Salvador Robert White calls "one of
the most out-of-control, violent,
bloodthirsty group of men in the
world." Thousands of Salvadorian
civilians have been killed by gov
ernment forces and the deaths will

continue as long as the U.S. con
tinues sending arms while refusing
to support unconditional negotia
tions with the opposition.
In Nicaragua and Southern Africa,
the administration's fear of com
munism has become their justifica
tion for suppressing the right to
self-determination and liberty which
they are supposedly trying to de-

Commencement is an
occasion for reflection
and thought but also a
time to decide how we
will utilize the knowl
edge we have gained
here at Stanford. For this
reason we feel it is ap
propriate to analyze the
current course of the
administration's policies.

fend. By refusing to negotiate with
the Nicaraguan government and by
failing to strongly support the rights
of the black majority of South Africa
for political representation we feel
the U.S. government has failed to
demonstrate a sincere concern for
these values.
Commencement is an occasion for
reflection and thought but also a

time to decide how we will utilize the
knowledge we have gained here at
Stanford. For this reason we feel it is
appropriate to analyze the current
course of the administration's
policies and speak out against U.S.
actions which are contributing to the
suffering and persecution of people
throughout the world. While it is im
portant to listen to different perspec
tives, a failure to express opposition
will mean a vote of support for the
current policies. While people may
be critical of any attempt to politicize
graduation perhaps it would be in
structive to remember those, who
have already suffered death or exile
for supporting human rights during
religious ceremonies. Certain issues
in El Salvador and South Africa can
not be ignored.
While we disapprove of a vocal dis
ruption, symbolizing our opposition
to Shultz's policies by wearing a sash
will bring an important message to
Shultz and the public. This symbol
can not affect change alone but
rather should serve as an impetus for
further action toward a more rational
and humane foreign policy.
