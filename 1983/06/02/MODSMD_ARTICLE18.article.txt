## Sashes a simple response to a complex situation 
### 
Part of the American myth is that people who are
handed the skin of a dead sheep at graduation time think
it will keep their minds alive forever.
-lohn Mason Brown
For many in the Class of 1983, exams are finished
forever, yet for no one are the challenges past. The
choices you will encounter in the future will make
GMATs, LSATs, and MCATs look like Sunday School. On
graduation day, as you bask in the summer sun and the
pride of accomplishment, I strongly suggest that you
consider the challenge in your midst.
Several of you will be wearing sashes. What do they
represent? "Dissatisfaction with U.S. diplomacy in Cent
ral America, in South Africa, in the Middle East or in arms
control negotiations," you respond proudly. Well, I ask,
which one is it: A,B,C,D or all of the above? Certainly,
you remember from your academic days-gone-by that
any answer as vague as yours would receive no credit!
Sashes lack specificity. What is wrong with U.S. policy/
and what should it be, given the realities of the 20th
century? If you learned nothing else in you years on the
Farm, let us hope that you have at least come to realize
the danger of generalizations and the absence of intel
lectual sophistication which they reveal.
Sash-wearers no doubt pride themselves on being
critical thinkers; critical thinking, however, involves
more than the ability to analyze and evaluate. It requires
the construction of plausible alternatives — an activity
which is far more intellectually rigorous than mere criti
cism. It is easy to condemn in a single stroke that which
has evolved over decades. It is as intellectual as spray
painting graffiti, and the stock phrases are often the
same.
Can a coherent alternative policy be expressed on a
sash or placard? The forum chosen by the protesters is
absurd. Ronald Reagan did not invent the present U.S.
foreign policy overnight. American diplomacy reflects
the realities of culture, character, geography, econom
ics and history. It is amazing how many graduates of

those disciplines are now wearing sashes. I do not wish
to be misunderstood. America has made mistakes, and
realistic, constructive criticism is the lifeblood of Ameri
can democracy. What I do resent is the affront to intel
lectualism which this blanket demonstration represents.
In their thinly-veiled attempts to legitimize their pro
test, the sash coalition has adopted the catchwords
"human rights," "self-determination," and "disarma
ment." Where's the apple pie and motherhood? More
importantly, where is the evidence of U.S. failure and
their formula for success? "Criticism," wrote Zeuxis
some 400 years before Christ, "comes easier than
craftsmanship."
If they are really sincere, then why target their protest
at George Shultz who recently spent two grueling weeks
in the Middle East hammering out a peace plan? Where
are the placards protesting Soviet treatment of Sakharov
and Solidarity or Moscow's deployment of new SS-20s in
Asia? Where are the sashes condemning the Sandinista's
murder of the Meskito Indians, the banners protesting
genocide in Kampuchea or the re-education camps in
China? The blatent lack of objectivity of the sash coali
tion should offend the intellect of every candidate for
graduation.
The test facing the Class of 1983 is clear. The demon
stration scheduled for graduation day offers the perfect
opportunity for all of you to verify your fellow graduates'
suitability to possess a Stanford diploma. Don't sit si
lently as your neighbor smiles smugly, congratulating
himself for "making a statement." Challenge him intel
lectually! Ask him to define his "statement" — to explain
his reasons for wearing a sash. Demand specifics. Make
him defend his decision with objective facts, and do not
relent until he has articulated plausible alternatives. As a
fellow Cardinal, I plead with you to defend the value of
your Stanford education and your own intellectual in
tegrity. Prove John Mason Brown wrong: USE YOUR
MIND!
