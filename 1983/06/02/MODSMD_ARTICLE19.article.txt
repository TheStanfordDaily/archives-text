## Englishspeak, or the way of the future in the humanities here 
### 
I was worried, since for some time I had
not seen my friend Wylbur Doorposter. You
will remember that he is the associate pro
fessor of English who performed so bril
liantly in the "model of a modern Major-
General" in the Savoyards' production of
The Pirates of Penzance. I had heard that he
had floppy disks, so I feared he might be in
hospital. When I saw him on the Ouad, I
said, "Wylbur, where have you been?"
He replied: "I wasn't interfacing with my
students last quarter, but this quarter I am
oh line."'Then he asked, "Where have you
been? I didn't see you at the sessions for
Humanities professors who had been given
computers."
I responded: "Sorry to say, I didn't qual
ify. The program is restricted to faculty
members who have teenage children, like
your Wylbur Jr. and Mark. You see, the ad
ministration is concerned about the ratingof

our humanities departments, and a study by
the Sociology Department showed that the
main problem is the blasted noise made by
teenage children who prevent their fathers
from producing the books that will raise the
departments' ratings. Hopefully computer
games will keep them quiet. How is your
computer working out?"
"Well, what with the kids and Jane using
the computer for her recipes, I can't get to it.
So I've decided to buy a word processor, the
best hardware you can find."
"Is that something you use in the kitchen?"
"Well, in the academic kitchen. You put
words in any old how at one end, press the
button, and the sentences come out as
smooth as Velveeta. We're going to use
word processors in Freshman English."
"Do your boys like the computers?"
"Yes, Wylbur plans to major in computer
science, and so does Mark."

I asked Wylbur what courses he was giv
ing.
"Well," he replied, "according to pro
tocol I was supposed to give my seminar on
the Lake Poets, but our majors find their
language weird and their vocabulary incom
prehensible. The enrollment dropped way
down, so the course was scrubbed."
"But you haven't given up your interest in
the Lake Poets, have you?"
"Oh no. I am writing a book on
Wordsworth. The title will be Daffodils and
Daisywheels."
"That should get you your promotion to
full professor and raise the rating of the de
partment. So what courses are you giving?"
"Well, I'm giving one on lexicon."
"That's terribly important. I have always
thought that lexicography was a neglected
subject. Because of our wretched depart
ment system, departments use different lex

icons and language teachers are incompe
tent to teach the subject."
"Oh, lexicon has nothing to do with that.
It's a gadget you insert in the word pro
cessor, and it automatically corrects the stu
dents' spelling. It will make life a lot easier
for both the faculty and the students."
"Do you have many students?"
"Only about 10 terminals. The students
complain about my courses. It's the fault of
the high schools, which don't teach kids
how to write clear, grammatical English.
They teach bilingual stuff, as though Ameri
cans spoke two languages. The Admissions
Office doesn't impose standards either. I've
tried everything. I ask students to call me by
my first name, I invite them home and make
pancakes for them, but still they turn in un
favorable reports." I could see that Wylbur
was worried about his promotion, since
promotions are largely a popularity contest.

"Oh dear!" said Wylbur, looking at his
computer watch. It's one o'clock GMT, so I
must go home-home."
I like Wylbur and wish him luck. A few
days later I stopped by the English Depart
ment to see how things were going. The
secretary, who had just taken the computer
course for the Humanities staff, said, "He's
not at his console. I think he's gone home
home."
"How is he?"
"Oh, he's terribly bucked. There has been
a sudden jump in his enrollment." She con
sulted the department data bank. "It's now
up to 25!"
"Marvellous! How do you explain that?"
"Don't you know? The Undergraduate
Studies Committee has approved his
courses as satisfying the foreign language
requirement."
