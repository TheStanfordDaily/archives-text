A record-breaking crowd of 15,000
will fill Frost Amphitheater to the
brim when Secretary of State George
Shultz delivers the featured address
at the University's 92nd commence
ment at 10 a.m. June 12.
Currently on leave as a professor at
the Business School, Shultz will face
a coalition of groups protesting
American policy toward Latin
America, the Middle East, South Af
rica and human rights policy.
The protest coalition has urged
graduates to wear sashes to sym
bolize their opposition to Reagan
administration policies.
"There won't be any disruption
during the ceremony," one spokes
woman for the coalition said.
Signs carried by demonstrators
will be permitted as long as they do
not obstruct the view of others and
are not on sticks.
About 2800 graduates are expected
to attend, an all-time University
In comparison, UC-Berkeley and
USC have likewise reported a surge
Â»n graduates attending commence
ment this year.
An estimated 4500 degrees will be
conferred by President Donald Ken
nedy, who will also address the class.
Following the Frost ceremonies, di
plomas will be handed out at 37
different campus locations.
Total attendance is estimated at
19,000, another all-time high.
Admission to Frost is by ticket
only. Participating graduates have
received three free tickets each for
use by their family and friends. Stu
dents selling extra tickets are asking
as much as $75 apiece.
The total commencement cost, ac
cording to Nan Bentley, com
mencement coordinator for Univer
sity tvents and Services, has yet to be
calculated. She stressed that this
year's ceremony will be more expen
sive due to "additional security
costs" for Shultz and others.
Some of the new security meas
ures include renting a fence to re
strict movement both in and out of
Frost, Bentley said. She noted that
efforts will be made "to discourge
people" from climbing trees in the
area around the amphitheater.
The main portion of the $85,000
commencement budget, according
to Bentley, covers the printing of
tickets and other information as well
as the cost and arranging of 18,000
chairs used in the ceremony.
Bentley added that the University
"is developing a rain plan for the first
time." In the event of inclement wea
ther, the major part of commence
ment will be moved to Maples Pavil
ion, and attendance will be further
restricted.
"We're hoping for a sunny day,"
Bentley said.
In order to expand available seat
ing, past commencement proposals
have included moving the ceremony
from Frost to the Stadium. Bentley
said that "Frost is thoueht to be more
