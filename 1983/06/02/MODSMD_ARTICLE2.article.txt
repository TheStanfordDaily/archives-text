# Big grad audience expected

### TROY EID Staff writer 
A record-breaking crowd of 15,000
will fill Frost Amphitheater to the
brim when Secretary of State George
Shultz delivers the featured address
at the University's 92nd commence
ment at 10 a.m. June 12.
Currently on leave as a professor at
the Business School, Shultz will face
a coalition of groups protesting
American policy toward Latin
America, the Middle East, South Af
rica and human rights policy.
The protest coalition has urged
graduates to wear sashes to sym
bolize their opposition to Reagan
administration policies.
"There won't be any disruption
during the ceremony," one spokes
woman for the coalition said.
Signs carried by demonstrators
will be permitted as long as they do
not obstruct the view of others and
are not on sticks.
About 2800 graduates are expected
to attend, an all-time University
In comparison, UC-Berkeley and
USC have likewise reported a surge
»n graduates attending commence
ment this year.
An estimated 4500 degrees will be
conferred by President Donald Ken
nedy, who will also address the class.
Following the Frost ceremonies, di
plomas will be handed out at 37
different campus locations.
Total attendance is estimated at
19,000, another all-time high.
Admission to Frost is by ticket
only. Participating graduates have
received three free tickets each for
use by their family and friends. Stu
dents selling extra tickets are asking
as much as $75 apiece.
The total commencement cost, ac
cording to Nan Bentley, com
mencement coordinator for Univer
sity tvents and Services, has yet to be
calculated. She stressed that this
year's ceremony will be more expen
sive due to "additional security
costs" for Shultz and others.
Some of the new security meas
ures include renting a fence to re
strict movement both in and out of
Frost, Bentley said. She noted that
efforts will be made "to discourge
people" from climbing trees in the
area around the amphitheater.
The main portion of the $85,000
commencement budget, according
to Bentley, covers the printing of
tickets and other information as well
as the cost and arranging of 18,000
chairs used in the ceremony.
Bentley added that the University
"is developing a rain plan for the first
time." In the event of inclement wea
ther, the major part of commence
ment will be moved to Maples Pavil
ion, and attendance will be further
restricted.
"We're hoping for a sunny day,"
Bentley said.
In order to expand available seat
ing, past commencement proposals
have included moving the ceremony
from Frost to the Stadium. Bentley
said that "Frost is thoueht to be more
beautiful, more fitting'' than the
stadium and noted that Frost "was
recently renovated'' mainly for
graduation purposes.
"It's quite dramatic to see the
academic processional coming down
the steps of Frost," she said.
Frost's renovation for this year's
commencement features an ironic
twist: "we can't leave things on the
new grass," Bentley said. Workers
will have "to speed up" preparation
and clean-up of the amphitheater in
order to avoid damaging the turf, she
added.
James Horgan, director of Opera

tions and Maintenance, noted that
his department does not have a
budget for commencement," adding
that the $800,000 budget each fiscal
year expands to include a wide
spectrum'' of graduation prepara
tions.
"We think we'll have it in pretty
good shape,' Horgan said, referring
to the University. "We really go
through the same routine (with
commencement) every year."
Commencement preparation
"takes a lot of effort and a lot of man
power," Horgan said. "We even
have a stand-by crew" to respond to
unforeseen needs, he added.
He noted that Operations and
Maintenance gears up for com
mencement "in the last week of
April" and continues "in a six-week

concentrated effort.
"The whole University gets con
centrated attention . . . so that every
thing on campus looks decent,"
Horgan said, adding that the area
around the president's house "gets a
good going over."

said that "Frost is thoueht to be more
beautiful, more fitting'' than the
stadium and noted that Frost "was
recently renovated'' mainly for
graduation purposes.
"It's quite dramatic to see the
academic processional coming down
the steps of Frost," she said.
Frost's renovation for this year's
commencement features an ironic
twist: "we can't leave things on the
new grass," Bentley said. Workers
will have "to speed up" preparation
and clean-up of the amphitheater in
order to avoid damaging the turf, she
added.
James Horgan, director of Opera

tions and Maintenance, noted that
his department does not have a
budget for commencement," adding
that the $800,000 budget each fiscal
year expands to include a wide
spectrum'' of graduation prepara
tions.
"We think we'll have it in pretty
good shape,' Horgan said, referring
to the University. "We really go
through the same routine (with
commencement) every year."
Commencement preparation
"takes a lot of effort and a lot of man
power," Horgan said. "We even
have a stand-by crew" to respond to
unforeseen needs, he added.
He noted that Operations and
Maintenance gears up for com
mencement "in the last week of
April" and continues "in a six-week

concentrated effort.
"The whole University gets con
centrated attention . . . so that every
thing on campus looks decent,"
Horgan said, adding that the area
around the president's house "gets a
good going over."

A record-breaking crowd of 15,000
will fill Frost Amphitheater to the
brim when Secretary of State George
Shultz delivers the featured address
at the University's 92nd commence
ment at 10 a.m. June 12.
Currently on leave as a professor at
the Business School, Shultz will face
a coalition of groups protesting
American policy toward Latin
America, the Middle East, South Af
rica and human rights policy.
The protest coalition has urged
graduates to wear sashes to sym
bolize their opposition to Reagan
administration policies.
"There won't be any disruption
during the ceremony," one spokes
woman for the coalition said.
Signs carried by demonstrators
will be permitted as long as they do
not obstruct the view of others and
are not on sticks.
About 2800 graduates are expected
to attend, an all-time University
In comparison, UC-Berkeley and
USC have likewise reported a surge
»n graduates attending commence
ment this year.
An estimated 4500 degrees will be
conferred by President Donald Ken
nedy, who will also address the class.
Following the Frost ceremonies, di
plomas will be handed out at 37
different campus locations.
Total attendance is estimated at
19,000, another all-time high.
Admission to Frost is by ticket
only. Participating graduates have
received three free tickets each for
use by their family and friends. Stu
dents selling extra tickets are asking
as much as $75 apiece.
The total commencement cost, ac
cording to Nan Bentley, com
mencement coordinator for Univer
sity tvents and Services, has yet to be
calculated. She stressed that this
year's ceremony will be more expen
sive due to "additional security
costs" for Shultz and others.
Some of the new security meas
ures include renting a fence to re
strict movement both in and out of
Frost, Bentley said. She noted that
efforts will be made "to discourge
people" from climbing trees in the
area around the amphitheater.
The main portion of the $85,000
commencement budget, according
to Bentley, covers the printing of
tickets and other information as well
as the cost and arranging of 18,000
chairs used in the ceremony.
Bentley added that the University
"is developing a rain plan for the first
time." In the event of inclement wea
ther, the major part of commence
ment will be moved to Maples Pavil
ion, and attendance will be further
restricted.
"We're hoping for a sunny day,"
Bentley said.
In order to expand available seat
ing, past commencement proposals
have included moving the ceremony
from Frost to the Stadium. Bentley
said that "Frost is thoueht to be more
beautiful, more fitting'' than the
stadium and noted that Frost "was
recently renovated'' mainly for
graduation purposes.
"It's quite dramatic to see the
