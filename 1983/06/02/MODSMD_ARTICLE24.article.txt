# The 						drug for all-nighters
## 
### JULIE HAGEN Staff writer 
As finals loom ever
nearer, Caffeina, museof all
nighters, appears more and
more frequently over the
rim of a coffee cup, Coke
can or even under the
innocent-looking wrapper
of a chocolate bar.
Although these days soft
drink companies are battl
ing to come up with the
number one decaffeinated
soda, more and more stu
dents still look to caffeine,
the most popular and
widely consumed drug in
the world, to keep them
awake through the long
Dead Week nights.
"They use it to help them
do something they would
not otherwise be able to do.
It artificially creates the abil
ity to do something in the
short-term, which may, in
the long run, be harmful,"
said Jack Martin, who
teaches the Optimal Health
and Fitness class offered
here each spring.
When ingested, caffeine
reaches every part of the
body within five minutes. It
constricts some blood ves
sels, dilates others, speeds
up the basal metabolic rate
by approximately 10 per
cent, steps up output of
stomach acid and urine and
causes the muscles of the
heart to contract more vig
orously.
Exactly how caffeine pro
vides its stimulating boost is
not completely understood.
Researchers currently be
lieve that caffeine blocks
the action of adenosine, a
chemical messenger which
has a quieting effect in
human beings, allowing
them to feel more awake
and energetic.
It is not clear, either,
whether consuming large
amounts of caffeine is actu
ally harmful. Studies have
been done which link caf
feine to birth defects, heart
disease and cancer, but re
searchers have not been
able to prove any definite
correlation.
It is certain, however, that
caffeine has the potential to
be physically addicting. And

despite the growing con
cern over the excessive use
of caffeine among Ameri
cans, people are drinking it.
In 1982, Americans spent
over $23 billion on soft
drinks; enough to provide
every man, woman and
child with 416-12 oz. cans.
Vet it is coffee that accounts
for 75 percent of the caf
feine consumed in America
today.
This trend is reflected
here. Suzanne White,
an employee at The
Store, said that while sales

of caffeine products may in
crease slightly at mid-term
and final time, they are al
ways quite high. No-Doz, a
stimulant containing 100
milligrams of caffeine, is a
popular item. "Enerjets," a
stimulant in the form of a
candy-like lozenge, adver
tized by the slogan, "Eat a
cup of coffee,"comesin two
flavors and is bought more
often as a "novelty," ac
cording to White.
Appetite suppressants, or
"diet pills" as they are
commonly known, also
contain large amounts of
caffeine. Dexatrim, for
example, contains 200 mil
ligrams of caffeine in a
single capsule.
White reported that these
products sold "less often"
at The Store. "I usually only
sell about three boxes in a
three-hour shift," White
said.
As with any addictive sub
stance, a cut-off of caffeine

to a person who is depen
dent on it will result in with
drawal. Sophomore
Michael Hood admits he
drinks a couple of cups of
coffee every weekday, and
reported that on the
weekend, when he did not
consume any coffee, "I felt
run-down and tired and
started desiringa cup of cof
fee. I guess I am addicted,"
he said.
But coffee and soft drinks
are not the only caffeine
culprits. Automatic drip cof
fee contains about 110 to
150 milligrams of caffeine
per cup, as compared to 40
to 180 milligrams in a cup of
instant coffee. Tea contains
20 to 50 milligrams of caf
feine per brewed cup, and
22 to 36 for iced tea. Milk
chocolate contains six mil
ligrams of caffeine per
ounce. Excedrin contains 65
milligrams per tablet.
Mountain Dew receives
the honors as the soft drink
with the highest caffeine
content with 54 milligrams
in 12 ounces. Dr. Pepper
and Pepsi come next with
38, followed by Coke with
33 and Tab with 32. Seven
up, Sprite, Sunkist and
Ginger Ale contain no caf
feine.
Whether or not caffeine is
proven to be damaging in
the long run, Martin feels
that there are other more
beneficial, natural ways to
stay alert during Dead
Week. "There are better
ways to renew your ener
gies and study for finals than
drinkingcaffeine. Moderate
exercise, for example. Go
for an easy run for 15 to 20
minutes, or a brisk walk,"
and you'll be surprised how
refreshed you feel, Martin
said.
In any event, research
done by two professors at
the University of Oklahoma
shows that the joke may be
on us. In a study of high and
low caffeine consuming
students, their research
shows that the higher the
caffeine intake, the lower
the grades received by the
student, both in a semester
average, and in a specific
psychology course.
