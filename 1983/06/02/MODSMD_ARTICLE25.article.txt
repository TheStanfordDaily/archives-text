Why did all the house
phone numbers change last
quarter to 853- numbersf
Are all the 32 prefixes used
up?
— Clueless
Don't feel bad, Stanford is
just as clueless. A person in
the Telecommunications of
fice told me, "What willed
them (Pacific Telephone) to
do that is beyond me." She
said Pacific Telephone
warned Stanford a month
ahead that the numbers
were going to change, so
the University could revise
its records, and then
changed all the house pay
phones within a week in
mid-March.
So I embarked on an
odyssey through Pacific Tel
ephone, from Susan in the
Palo Alto business office
(they didn't know anything
about it) to Stan, the campus
representative (he doesn't
have anything to do with
phones in the residences) to
Pacific Telephone's pay
phone headquarters, some
where at the end of an 800
number. There Nancy (no
one at Pacific Telephone has
a last name) finally gave me
an answer. It seems that the
company is beginning to in
stall pay phones with new
advanced electronic
switching equipment (i.e.,

you won't have to put your
dime in first), and these new
phones need 327 and 328
prefixes. So the antiquated
Stanford dorm phones were
switched to 853 prefixes to
free 327 sand 328s for the
wave of the future.
According to Nancy, Pa
cific Telephone sent Stan
ford letters warning them of
the change one year, six
months and three months
before it took place.

Now that that's out of the
way — my last question of
the year — I'll close by giv
ing answers for a couple of
my favorite questions no
one asked. (I apologize to all
the people who ran into me
in the Quad, at the Post Of
fice and around the Daily
and asked me fascinating
questions which I promptly
forgot.)

Ves, I too thought it was
funny when one of the fea
tured speakers at the
groundbreaking of the Cen
ter for Integrated Systems —
an experiment in industry,
as opposed to government,
support of research — was
an undersecretary of de
fense.
But then maybe it's not so

funny. United Technolo
gies, Genera! Electric,
Northrop, Honeywell, Fair
child Camera, TRW, IBM,
Texas Instruments, IT&T,
GTE, Philips, Motorola,
Xerox and Hewlett-Packard
have several things in com
mon. For one thing, they're
14 of the 19 companies that
sponsored CIS. For another,
they're all among the top
100 defense contractors in
the country (according to
1980 Dept. of Defense
(DoD) figures, the most re
cent I could obtain). In 1980
they ranked, respectively,
third, fifth, 11th, 19th, 24th,
27th, 28th, 32nd, 37th, 41st,
48th, 59th, 77th and 100 th.
United Technologies
doesn't really make much to
speak of besides fighter
bombers (F-18As and F-ss)
and parts for them (Pratt &
Whitney is one of their sub
sidiaries). Any interest they
have in microelectronics
probably relates to air com
bat systems.
Stanford is no stranger to
DoD money. While we
couldn't crack the 1980 Top
100 in total dollar volume of
contracts, we were right up
there in research, develop
ment, testing and eval
uation contracts: 65th over
all, 10th among non-profit
organizations (right behind

SRI International), and fifth
among universities (follow
ing Johns Hopkins, MIT,
UC-Berkeley and the Illinois
Institute of Technology)
with our total of $18,068,000.
We were a distant fifth,
however — Hopkins and
MIT both drew more than
Siso million.
Stanford's first recorded
cheer went: "Give 'em the
axe, the axe, the
axe/(repeat)/Give 'em the
axe, give 'em the axe, give
'em the axe —
Where?/Right in the neck,
the neck, the neck ..." It
surfaced in 1896. An actual
axe wasn't brought into it
until 1899, when a lumber
jack's axe was brought to a
pre-baseball-game bonfire,
sharpened, and used to
chop the head off of a blue
and-gold-clad effigy. The
next day Cal students spon
taneously stole the axe after
the baseball game, raced
with it through the streetsof
San Francisco (one of their
heros was the reigning West
Coast sprint champion) and
onto the ferry (no bridges in
those days). The axe stayed
in Berkeley for the next 30
years — they weren't civ
ilized enough to give it to
the winning football team
back then.

the Telecommunications of
fice told me, "What willed
them (Pacific Telephone) to
do that is beyond me." She
said Pacific Telephone
warned Stanford a month
ahead that the numbers
were going to change, so
the University could revise
its records, and then
changed all the house pay
phones within a week in
mid-March.
So I embarked on an
odyssey through Pacific Tel
ephone, from Susan in the
Palo Alto business office
(they didn't know anything
about it) to Stan, the campus
representative (he doesn't
have anything to do with
phones in the residences) to
Pacific Telephone's pay
phone headquarters, some
where at the end of an 800
number. There Nancy (no
one at Pacific Telephone has
a last name) finally gave me
an answer. It seems that the
company is beginning to in
stall pay phones with new
advanced electronic
switching equipment (i.e.,

you won't have to put your
dime in first), and these new
phones need 327 and 328
prefixes. So the antiquated
Stanford dorm phones were
switched to 853 prefixes to
free 327 sand 328s for the
wave of the future.
According to Nancy, Pa
cific Telephone sent Stan
ford letters warning them of
the change one year, six
months and three months
before it took place.

Now that that's out of the
way — my last question of
the year — I'll close by giv
ing answers for a couple of
my favorite questions no
one asked. (I apologize to all
the people who ran into me
in the Quad, at the Post Of
fice and around the Daily
and asked me fascinating
questions which I promptly
forgot.)
***
Ves, I too thought it was
funny when one of the fea
tured speakers at the
groundbreaking of the Cen
ter for Integrated Systems —
an experiment in industry,
as opposed to government,
support of research — was
an undersecretary of de
fense.
But then maybe it's not so

funny. United Technolo
gies, Genera! Electric,
Northrop, Honeywell, Fair
child Camera, TRW, IBM,
Texas Instruments, IT&T,
GTE, Philips, Motorola,
Xerox and Hewlett-Packard
have several things in com
mon. For one thing, they're
14 of the 19 companies that
sponsored CIS. For another,
they're all among the top
100 defense contractors in
the country (according to
1980 Dept. of Defense
(DoD) figures, the most re
cent I could obtain). In 1980
they ranked, respectively,
third, fifth, 11th, 19th, 24th,
27th, 28th, 32nd, 37th, 41st,
48th, 59th, 77th and 100 th.
United Technologies
doesn't really make much to
speak of besides fighter
bombers (F-18As and F-ss)
and parts for them (Pratt &
Whitney is one of their sub
sidiaries). Any interest they
have in microelectronics
probably relates to air com
bat systems.
Stanford is no stranger to
DoD money. While we
couldn't crack the 1980 Top
100 in total dollar volume of
contracts, we were right up
there in research, develop
ment, testing and eval
uation contracts: 65th over
all, 10th among non-profit
organizations (right behind

SRI International), and fifth
among universities (follow
ing Johns Hopkins, MIT,
UC-Berkeley and the Illinois
Institute of Technology)
with our total of $18,068,000.
We were a distant fifth,
however — Hopkins and
MIT both drew more than
Siso million.
Stanford's first recorded
cheer went: "Give 'em the
axe, the axe, the
axe/(repeat)/Give 'em the
axe, give 'em the axe, give
'em the axe —
Where?/Right in the neck,
the neck, the neck ..." It
surfaced in 1896. An actual
axe wasn't brought into it
until 1899, when a lumber
jack's axe was brought to a
pre-baseball-game bonfire,
sharpened, and used to
chop the head off of a blue
and-gold-clad effigy. The
next day Cal students spon
taneously stole the axe after
the baseball game, raced
with it through the streetsof
San Francisco (one of their
heros was the reigning West
Coast sprint champion) and
onto the ferry (no bridges in
those days). The axe stayed
in Berkeley for the next 30
years — they weren't civ
ilized enough to give it to
the winning football team
back then.

Why did all the house
phone numbers change last
quarter to 853- numbersf
Are all the 32 prefixes used
up?
— Clueless
Don't feel bad, Stanford is
just as clueless. A person in
the Telecommunications of
fice told me, "What willed
them (Pacific Telephone) to
do that is beyond me." She
said Pacific Telephone

ahead that the numbers
were going to change, so
