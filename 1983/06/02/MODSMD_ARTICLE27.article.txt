## The 						Mandarin-perfect for the small, 'elite' group 
### 
The Mandarin
Ghiradelli Square
San Francisco
673-8812
Well, the school year is
rapidly drawing to a close, and
soon it will be over, at least
until September. Since this is
my last review until next tall, I
wanted to do something that
would be reflective of the spirit
of graduation. It didn t take me
very much time to discover the
place — it's called The Manda
rin. The name itselt seems to
represent the imag i Stan
ford graduate, tor a Mandarin
was a member of a small elite
group in the Chinese Empire
which possessed a high degree
of education and an t \citing
flair for life.
Dinner at The Mandarin was
a unique experience — the res
taurant exudes elegance as
well as excellence.
As many of you know, I am

apprehensive about eating at
places that have been tloodee
with awards and long-stand <\c
compliments. It has been mv
experience that many ot these
restaurants trv to ride upon
their reputations rather than
maintain the high standards tor
which thev were commended
Thus, I was a little reserved
about dining at this famous ies
taurant nestled inside Ghirar
delli Square and as I entered
the dining room, I knew that
the meal would be quite spe
cial.
Having |ust spent the entire
day walking around San Fran
cisco, we were in no hurrv to
leave, so we decided to order
our dinner, one course at a
time. (This is a method of din
ing which I strongly recom
mend. It allows you to space
out the time between courses
and it is a lot more fun to
choose your main dishes after
you ve tasted the appetizers. In

addition it gives you more

We began our meal with two
e x q u is te a p p e 11 z e t s 1 h e
sp igrol >4 >0 consisted of
ground pork chicken bean
sprouts and bamboo shoots all
rolled up inside two delicate
pancakes that had been deep
tried and then i ut into fourths.
It was a taste sensation which
made common egg rolls seem
incredibly boring. The pan
cakes were wonderfully light
and enspy and the combina
tion ot the chic ken pork and a
heavy spattering of sweet and
sour sauce was trulv delightful.
Our other appetizer was
something called Chiao-Tzu.
Chiao-Tzu <>4.50' is best de
scribed as a little, crescent
shaped dumpling filled with an
interesting concoction ot pork
cabbage and exotic season

ings. The Chiao-Tzu came in a
group ot tour dumplings w hie h
were browned on just one
side. I would suggest that vou
pic k them up with \our hands
unless \oti are extremely adept
with chopsticks because
the\ re slippery little things.
Onee vou experience the
flavor ot Chiao-Tzu. you ma\
not want to continue on to the
next course In tact you might
want \our waitei to bring you
another helping: which might
ncit be such a had idea.
But when you have finally
reached your appetizer capac
ity you can then turn to the
difficult task ot choosing en
trees.
The menu offers a (reative
balance of every major style
of Chinese cooking—Canton,
Szechvvan, Mongolian Peking,
and Hunan — but let me en
courage \ ou to try things with
which you are not familiar for
it is in the more unusual dishes

that the superior quality and
creativity ot The Mandarin
shines through.
\\ e enjoyed the Bon-Bon
i hi i$ c ).7S) w hie h consisted of a
tast\ mixture of thicken,
cucumbers, red peppers and
sesame seed butter. The
chicken was served cold and
the tlavor was both tangy and
refreshing.
In order to contrast with the
chicken, we also ordered the
Mongolian Lamb ($11) which
was one ot many special dishes
listed on the tirst page of the
menu. The problem with most
versions ot Mongolian Beef or
Lamb is that the meat is often
tough and the sauce is usually
too heavy for the delicate
tlavor ot the meat. This is cer
tainly not the case at The Man
darin. The dish was served with
large, succulent pieces of lamb
covered with a wonderfully
tasty sauce and served with
scallions. My only criticism of
this entree is that I prefer it to
be more spicy.
But I suppose that if I wanted
something really hot, I should
have ordered the Beef a la
Hunan ($10.50) — beef strips
sauteed with glass noddles and
chilis — "Mao Tse Tung's
hometown dish," according to
the menu.
In addition to the normal a la
carte menu, the Mandarin of
fers several "Mandarin Spe
cialities" which require a day's
notice. These include a sup
posedly original and secret rec
ipe for Mandarin Duck; a
highly praised, clay-baked
Beggar's Chicken; and for
those with unlimited budgets,
how about the Shark's Fin
Soup ($70)!
The Mandarin also provides
an easy way out for those who
have difficulty making deci
sions. They offer three pre
planned family dinners which
serve at least two people and
offer a wide selection of dis
hes.
By now, all of you should
know that my absolute favorite
part of any meal is dessert. As a
matter of fact, it isn't uncom
mon for me to devour three or
four desserts at one sitting.
Therefore, Far Eastern cuisine
is often disappointing because
it rarely offers any noteworthy
desserts. However, even in the
dessert column, The Mandarin
displayed a marvellous flash of
creativity.

When you dine at The Man
darin, you MUST have the
Mandarin Glazed apples (S4.SO
for two). Even if you don't like
sweets, you should order this
dessert, because part of the
fun is in its creation. The waiter
will come to your table with a
bowl of ice water. Then he will
return with many slices of fruit
smothered in a piping hot corn
syrup glaze. The fruit is then
plunged into the ice water,
causing the syrup to crystallize
instantly. But that's only the
beginning.
Now comes the hard part —
trying to eat them! The crystal
lized syrup is extremely gooey
and it sticks to everything; es
pecially your teeth and the roof
of your mouth.

'Having just spent
the entire day walk
ing around San Fran
cisco, we were in no
hurry to leave, so we
decided to order our
dinner, one course at
a time ... it is a lot
more fun to choose
your main dishes
after you've tasted
the appetizers.

After just one bite, my jaw
felt as though it was wired shut
— it was like having braces all
over again. Needless to say,
the conversation at our table
came to a screeching halt. After
several minutes of silence, we
discovered the cure to our
problem — hot tea! After sev
eral gulps of tea my jaw came
unglued and I could talk.
We then changed our eating
style to include a one to two
minute soaking of our apples
in the hot tea before we tried to
eat them. This was a vast im
provement! This dessert is
worth every last tug on your
jaw. The apples are quite tasty
and I enjoyed the contrast be
tween the hot apples and the
cold outside coating. The de
ssert is worth the price just be
cause of how much fun you can
have while eating it. (If this de
ssert isn't enough, you can al
ways stroll down the steps to

t\l£
mandanm

the Ghirardelli Chocolate Fac
tory and have a sundae —
which is exactly what we did!).
The atmosphere at The
Mandarin serves as a perfect
compliment to the exquisite
cuisine that they serve. The
dining room is one large space
partitioned with carved wood
screens. Thus, we were never
aware of how many people
were actually in the restaurant.
Although the tables are close
together, the quiet accoustics
and the soft lighting prevented
me from noticing anyone else.
In addition, the individual can
dles, the Chinese prints on the
wall, and the view of the Bay
from some of the tables
created an atmosphere that
was both intimate and relaxed.
The staff was very knowledge
able and courteous. They had a
little bit of trouble understand
ing why we were taking so long
to eat, but they caught on
eventually.
I must say that I am extremely
impressed with The Mandarin.
At every turn, the visit illus
trated why so many people,
myself included, think that The
Mandarin is the finest Chinese
restaurant in the city. It is
somewhat expensive — our bill
topped $60 — but the superior
quality ot the food and the ele
gance of the surroundings jus
tified the price.
The Mandarin offers a mar
velous opportunity to sample
trulysuperiorqualitycuisine. It
is an excellent place to go to
when showing visitors
(perhaps your parents) around
the wharf, or anytime that you
want to indulge in a truly satis
fying experience.

courage \ ou to try things with
which you are not familiar for
it is in the more unusual dishes

that the superior quality and
creativity ot The Mandarin
shines through.
\\ e enjoyed the Bon-Bon
i hi i$ c ).7S) w hie h consisted of a
tast\ mixture of thicken,
cucumbers, red peppers and
sesame seed butter. The
chicken was served cold and
the tlavor was both tangy and
refreshing.
In order to contrast with the
chicken, we also ordered the
Mongolian Lamb ($11) which
was one ot many special dishes
listed on the tirst page of the
menu. The problem with most
versions ot Mongolian Beef or
Lamb is that the meat is often
tough and the sauce is usually
too heavy for the delicate
tlavor ot the meat. This is cer
tainly not the case at The Man
darin. The dish was served with
large, succulent pieces of lamb
covered with a wonderfully
tasty sauce and served with
scallions. My only criticism of
this entree is that I prefer it to
be more spicy.
But I suppose that if I wanted
something really hot, I should
have ordered the Beef a la
Hunan ($10.50) — beef strips
sauteed with glass noddles and
chilis — "Mao Tse Tung's
hometown dish," according to
the menu.
In addition to the normal a la
carte menu, the Mandarin of
fers several "Mandarin Spe
cialities" which require a day's
notice. These include a sup
posedly original and secret rec
ipe for Mandarin Duck; a
highly praised, clay-baked
Beggar's Chicken; and for
those with unlimited budgets,
how about the Shark's Fin
Soup ($70)!
The Mandarin also provides
an easy way out for those who
have difficulty making deci
sions. They offer three pre
planned family dinners which
serve at least two people and
offer a wide selection of dis
hes.
By now, all of you should
know that my absolute favorite
part of any meal is dessert. As a
matter of fact, it isn't uncom
mon for me to devour three or
four desserts at one sitting.
Therefore, Far Eastern cuisine
is often disappointing because
it rarely offers any noteworthy
desserts. However, even in the
dessert column, The Mandarin
displayed a marvellous flash of
creativity.

When you dine at The Man
darin, you MUST have the
Mandarin Glazed apples (S4.SO
for two). Even if you don't like
sweets, you should order this
dessert, because part of the
fun is in its creation. The waiter
will come to your table with a
bowl of ice water. Then he will
return with many slices of fruit
smothered in a piping hot corn
syrup glaze. The fruit is then
plunged into the ice water,
causing the syrup to crystallize
instantly. But that's only the
beginning.
Now comes the hard part —
trying to eat them! The crystal
lized syrup is extremely gooey
and it sticks to everything; es
pecially your teeth and the roof
of your mouth.

'Having just spent
the entire day walk
ing around San Fran
cisco, we were in no
hurry to leave, so we
decided to order our
dinner, one course at
a time ... it is a lot
more fun to choose
your main dishes
after you've tasted
the appetizers.

After just one bite, my jaw
felt as though it was wired shut
— it was like having braces all
over again. Needless to say,
the conversation at our table
came to a screeching halt. After
several minutes of silence, we
discovered the cure to our
problem — hot tea! After sev
eral gulps of tea my jaw came
unglued and I could talk.
We then changed our eating
style to include a one to two
minute soaking of our apples
in the hot tea before we tried to
eat them. This was a vast im
provement! This dessert is
worth every last tug on your
jaw. The apples are quite tasty
and I enjoyed the contrast be
tween the hot apples and the
cold outside coating. The de
ssert is worth the price just be
cause of how much fun you can
have while eating it. (If this de
ssert isn't enough, you can al
ways stroll down the steps to

t\l£
mandanm

the Ghirardelli Chocolate Fac
tory and have a sundae —
which is exactly what we did!).
The atmosphere at The
Mandarin serves as a perfect
compliment to the exquisite
cuisine that they serve. The
dining room is one large space
partitioned with carved wood
screens. Thus, we were never
aware of how many people
were actually in the restaurant.
Although the tables are close
together, the quiet accoustics
and the soft lighting prevented
me from noticing anyone else.
In addition, the individual can
dles, the Chinese prints on the
wall, and the view of the Bay
from some of the tables
created an atmosphere that
was both intimate and relaxed.
The staff was very knowledge
able and courteous. They had a
little bit of trouble understand
ing why we were taking so long
to eat, but they caught on
eventually.
I must say that I am extremely
impressed with The Mandarin.
At every turn, the visit illus
trated why so many people,
myself included, think that The
Mandarin is the finest Chinese
restaurant in the city. It is
somewhat expensive — our bill
topped $60 — but the superior
quality ot the food and the ele
gance of the surroundings jus
tified the price.
The Mandarin offers a mar

trulysuperiorqualitycuisine. It
is an excellent place to go to
when showing visitors

the wharf, or anytime that you
want to indulge in a truly satis

ANCIENT CHINESE SECRET: Good food!

The Mandarin
Ghiradelli Square
San Francisco

Well, the school year is
rapidly drawing to a close, and
soon it will be over, at least
until September. Since this is
my last review until next tall, I
wanted to do something that
would be reflective of the spirit
of graduation. It didn t take me
very much time to discover the
place — it's called The Manda
rin. The name itselt seems to
represent the imag i Stan
ford graduate, tor a Mandarin
was a member of a small elite
group in the Chinese Empire
which possessed a high degree
of education and an t \citing
flair for life.
Dinner at The Mandarin was
a unique experience — the res
taurant exudes elegance as
well as excellence.
As many of you know, I am

apprehensive about eating at
places that have been tloodee
with awards and long-stand <\c
compliments. It has been mv
experience that many ot these
restaurants trv to ride upon
their reputations rather than
maintain the high standards tor
which thev were commended
Thus, I was a little reserved
about dining at this famous ies
taurant nestled inside Ghirar

the dining room, I knew that
the meal would be quite spe

Having |ust spent the entire
day walking around San Fran

our dinner, one course at a

heavy spattering of sweet and

Our other appetizer was
something called Chiao-Tzu.
Chiao-Tzu <>4.50' is best de

felt as though it was wired shut
— it was like having braces all
over again. Needless to say,
the conversation at our table
came to a screeching halt. After
several minutes of silence, we
discovered the cure to our
problem — hot tea! After sev
eral gulps of tea my jaw came
unglued and I could talk.
We then changed our eating
style to include a one to two
minute soaking of our apples
in the hot tea before we tried to
eat them. This was a vast im
provement! This dessert is
worth every last tug on your
jaw. The apples are quite tasty
and I enjoyed the contrast be
tween the hot apples and the
cold outside coating. The de
ssert is worth the price just be
cause of how much fun you can
have while eating it. (If this de
ssert isn't enough, you can al
ways stroll down the steps to

t\l£
mandanm

the Ghirardelli Chocolate Fac
tory and have a sundae —
which is exactly what we did!).
The atmosphere at The
Mandarin serves as a perfect
compliment to the exquisite
cuisine that they serve. The
dining room is one large space
partitioned with carved wood
screens. Thus, we were never
aware of how many people
were actually in the restaurant.
Although the tables are close
together, the quiet accoustics
and the soft lighting prevented
me from noticing anyone else.
In addition, the individual can
dles, the Chinese prints on the
wall, and the view of the Bay
from some of the tables
created an atmosphere that
was both intimate and relaxed.
The staff was very knowledge
able and courteous. They had a
little bit of trouble understand
ing why we were taking so long
to eat, but they caught on
eventually.
I must say that I am extremely
impressed with The Mandarin.
At every turn, the visit illus
trated why so many people,
myself included, think that The
Mandarin is the finest Chinese
restaurant in the city. It is
somewhat expensive — our bill
topped $60 — but the superior
quality ot the food and the ele
gance of the surroundings jus
tified the price.
The Mandarin offers a mar
velous opportunity to sample
trulysuperiorqualitycuisine. It
is an excellent place to go to
when showing visitors
(perhaps your parents) around
the wharf, or anytime that you
want to indulge in a truly satis
fying experience.

ANCIENT CHINESE SECRET: Good food!

The Mandarin
Ghiradelli Square
San Francisco
673-8812
Well, the school year is
rapidly drawing to a close, and
soon it will be over, at least
until September. Since this is
my last review until next tall, I
wanted to do something that
would be reflective of the spirit
of graduation. It didn t take me
very much time to discover the
place — it's called The Manda
rin. The name itselt seems to
represent the imag i Stan
ford graduate, tor a Mandarin
was a member of a small elite
group in the Chinese Empire
which possessed a high degree
of education and an t \citing
flair for life.
Dinner at The Mandarin was
a unique experience — the res
taurant exudes elegance as
well as excellence.
As many of you know, I am

apprehensive about eating at
places that have been tloodee
with awards and long-stand <\c
compliments. It has been mv
experience that many ot these
restaurants trv to ride upon
their reputations rather than
maintain the high standards tor
which thev were commended
Thus, I was a little reserved
about dining at this famous ies
taurant nestled inside Ghirar
delli Square and as I entered
the dining room, I knew that
the meal would be quite spe
cial.
Having |ust spent the entire
day walking around San Fran
cisco, we were in no hurrv to
leave, so we decided to order
our dinner, one course at a
time. (This is a method of din
ing which I strongly recom
mend. It allows you to space
out the time between courses
and it is a lot more fun to
choose your main dishes after
you ve tasted the appetizers. In

addition it gives you more
1 ne to enjoy intriguing con
ve s.-,: on and to indulge in the
vp ete dining experi
oru c
We began our meal with two
e x q u is te a p p e 11 z e t s 1 h e
sp igrol >4 >0 consisted of
ground pork chicken bean
sprouts and bamboo shoots all
rolled up inside two delicate
pancakes that had been deep
tried and then i ut into fourths.
It was a taste sensation which
made common egg rolls seem
incredibly boring. The pan
cakes were wonderfully light
and enspy and the combina
tion ot the chic ken pork and a
heavy spattering of sweet and
sour sauce was trulv delightful.
Our other appetizer was
something called Chiao-Tzu.
Chiao-Tzu <>4.50' is best de
scribed as a little, crescent
shaped dumpling filled with an
interesting concoction ot pork
cabbage and exotic season

ings. The Chiao-Tzu came in a
group ot tour dumplings w hie h
were browned on just one
side. I would suggest that vou
pic k them up with \our hands
unless \oti are extremely adept
with chopsticks because
the\ re slippery little things.
Onee vou experience the
flavor ot Chiao-Tzu. you ma\
not want to continue on to the
next course In tact you might
want \our waitei to bring you
another helping: which might
ncit be such a had idea.
But when you have finally
reached your appetizer capac
ity you can then turn to the
difficult task ot choosing en
trees.
The menu offers a (reative
balance of every major style
of Chinese cooking—Canton,
Szechvvan, Mongolian Peking,
and Hunan — but let me en
courage \ ou to try things with
which you are not familiar for
it is in the more unusual dishes

that the superior quality and
creativity ot The Mandarin
shines through.
\\ e enjoyed the Bon-Bon
i hi i$ c ).7S) w hie h consisted of a
tast\ mixture of thicken,
cucumbers, red peppers and
sesame seed butter. The
chicken was served cold and
the tlavor was both tangy and
refreshing.
In order to contrast with the
chicken, we also ordered the
Mongolian Lamb ($11) which
was one ot many special dishes
listed on the tirst page of the
menu. The problem with most
versions ot Mongolian Beef or
Lamb is that the meat is often
tough and the sauce is usually
too heavy for the delicate
tlavor ot the meat. This is cer
tainly not the case at The Man
darin. The dish was served with
large, succulent pieces of lamb
covered with a wonderfully
tasty sauce and served with
scallions. My only criticism of
this entree is that I prefer it to
be more spicy.
But I suppose that if I wanted
something really hot, I should
have ordered the Beef a la
Hunan ($10.50) — beef strips
sauteed with glass noddles and
chilis — "Mao Tse Tung's
hometown dish," according to
the menu.
In addition to the normal a la
carte menu, the Mandarin of
fers several "Mandarin Spe
cialities" which require a day's
notice. These include a sup
posedly original and secret rec
ipe for Mandarin Duck; a
highly praised, clay-baked
Beggar's Chicken; and for
those with unlimited budgets,
how about the Shark's Fin
Soup ($70)!
The Mandarin also provides
an easy way out for those who
have difficulty making deci
sions. They offer three pre
planned family dinners which
serve at least two people and
offer a wide selection of dis
hes.
By now, all of you should
know that my absolute favorite
part of any meal is dessert. As a
matter of fact, it isn't uncom
mon for me to devour three or
four desserts at one sitting.
Therefore, Far Eastern cuisine
is often disappointing because
it rarely offers any noteworthy
desserts. However, even in the
dessert column, The Mandarin
displayed a marvellous flash of
creativity.

When you dine at The Man
darin, you MUST have the
Mandarin Glazed apples (S4.SO
for two). Even if you don't like
sweets, you should order this
dessert, because part of the
fun is in its creation. The waiter
will come to your table with a
bowl of ice water. Then he will
return with many slices of fruit
smothered in a piping hot corn
syrup glaze. The fruit is then
plunged into the ice water,
causing the syrup to crystallize
instantly. But that's only the
beginning.
Now comes the hard part —
trying to eat them! The crystal
lized syrup is extremely gooey
and it sticks to everything; es
pecially your teeth and the roof
of your mouth.

'Having just spent
the entire day walk
ing around San Fran
cisco, we were in no
hurry to leave, so we
decided to order our
dinner, one course at

more fun to choose
your main dishes
