fucked away among the redwoods
with a sweeping view of the forest, the
Bay and the city lights beyond, the
Skywood Restaurant lived up to its
name. But the view wasn't all it had to
offer â€” a varied menu featuring North
ern California and Italian cuisine, per
sonable service, and an open, inviting
atmosphere made Skywood a dining
treat.
Part of Skywood's attraction is its lo
cation. Perched atop the Santa Cruz
Mountains in Woodside, it's a 20-
minute drive from Stanford through
densely forested foothills along a wind
ing mountain road.
Remodeled last year from a dark,
formal atmosphere, Skywood has taken
on a whole new look. New owner
Michael Sarno created a livelier ambi
ence by expanding the bar and recon
structing the interior to form two sepa
rate dining areas.
Whitewashed pine walls and a high
beamed ceiling contribute to the light,
airy feeling. A full wall of windows
opens onto a clearing in the forest be
yond which the city lights shine. Navy
blue, beige and white overtones accent
the sharp look, while a stone fireplace
adds coziness.
A brick wall hung with copper pots
containing a cut-away window affords a
glimpse of steaming dishes and white
clad chefs in the kitchen. An adjacent
bar with its own fireplace and piano for
live entertainment, opening onto a
wooden deck, completes the set-up.
As impressive as the physical sur
roundings is the quality of food served
at Skywood. The meal started off on a
spirited note with a cluster of two-foot
long, crisp breadsticks in a glass on
each table. The extensive menu was
supplemented by a long list of daily
specials, making our decision difficult.

The salad offerings were especially
imaginative, including sliced mush
room topped with {>iion mustard and
honey dressing; beefsteak tomato top
ped with cheese, basil, oregano and
anchovy; and spinach salad with pan
cette (Italian bacon) and pint' nuts. 1
We finally opted tor walnut, gorgon- '
zola cheese and sliced apple on butter '
lettuce with vinagrette and the soup
"de giorno - a refreshing < ream of
scallion served ( hilled
For our appeti/er we chose from a
wide selection of homemade pasta a
tortellini stuffed with tresh mint and t
ricotta cheese tomato and fresh basil '
sauce. We also sampled the grilled '
Florida corn on the cob served with
whole cloves of roasted garlic. Both ap
petizers were unique combinations
which were extremely flavorful.
Next we tried the mesquite smoked
spareribs and the fresh New Fngland
scallops wrapped in pancctte and gril
led. Both dishes supplied generous
servings and were accented by savory
pureed parsnips rather than the stan
dard mashed potatoes. The ribs were
tangy, with a not-too-sweet barbeque
sauce, and the scallops were exquisite;
succulent, plump little mouthfuls as
tender as the finest filet mignon.
By the time the homemade pastry
tray arrived we were quite satisfied, but
manage d to enjoy an almond
spongecake drenched in fresh rasberry
puree and a creamy New York-style
cheesecake. The meal was an exciting
blend of unusual flavors each distinct
and delicious.
The service at Skywood was not only
efficient, but friendly. Our waiter, Dan,
brought the courses in rapid succes
sion, but not so fast that we felt rushed.
Prices range from $8 tosls for the a la
carte entrees, with salads and appetiz
ers in the $3 to range. With its
wooded location, impressive view and
delightful food, Skywood is a perfect
place to go for after graduation dinner,
or any time.
