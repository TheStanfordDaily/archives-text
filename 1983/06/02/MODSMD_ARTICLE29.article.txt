## 'Spacehunter'-one big headache 
### RICHARD KYLBERG 
Lamont Johnson's latest film,
Spacehunter shouldn't have
very far to hunt; there was
plenty of space in the theatre
where I saw it, and for good
reason — the film is horrible.
Poor 3D movies seem a dime
a dozen, but they aren't. . .a
dime, that is; Spacehunter is
$4.50 (or $12 million) for 89
minutes. However, the viewer
will indeed take something
home after the film; a pair of
paper glasses and a headache.
The reason for the headache
is clearly that the 3D hurts. In
order to get the full effect, the
viewer must sit google-eyed,
adjusting and readjusting the
awkward glasses. One could
see by the earlier McNabb sys
tem film, Comm' at Ya, that the
process was imperfect. Here it
occasionally distracts, even
obstructs, our view, but with
out the glasses, you can't see a
thing. As if to compensate for
the silliness of it all, AMC
theatres have painted racing
stripes on theirs, but no racing
stripes, not even Vuarnet on
the side, can stop the
headaches caused by the mul
tiple screen images.
On to the film. It opens with
great promise, which it never
fulfills. In the opening mo
ments, the 3D works and we
recognize that unlike Comin'
at Ya, it will not be exploited.
The credits hover nicely as tiny
stars fly out. The film proceeds
as if it weren't in 3D, drive-ins
are projecting it flat, and tries
to exist on its own merit.
But it has no merit. Spaceh
unter is the story of Wolff
(played by Peter Strauss) who is
on a self-given mission to save
three marooned women from
the forbidden zone's evil
Overdog (Michael Ironside).
Along the way, Wolff picks up
Niki (Molly Ringwald), a sec
ond spaceman who amounts to
little more than their butler.
On their perilous journey
they battle "The Mutant Chil
dren," an elementary school
dipped in facial putty who sing,
"La, la, la, la, la," and throw
molotov cocktails, "The Bat
People", billed as "a cross be
tween the Pillsbury Dough Boy
and the Michelan Tire Man,"
and"The Barracuda Women,"
a fishy group more aptly
named "The Three-quarters
NaKed Women."

The film is nothing but a
rip-off. What it lacks in original
ity, it tries to recover in 3D. The
plot comes from Star Wars, The
Road Warrior and Raiders of the
Lost Ark, and everything down

to the soundtrack has been
seen — or heard — before. The
viewer goes through every
scene thinking, "Oh yeah, I
saw that movie," and now they
have seen it again.

The characters are ridicul
ously constructed. Wolff is so
tough, casual, and distant from
emotion that the audience
never feels that he is ever in
any genuine peril. When any

thing attacks him, he merely
blasts it with his 3D ray gun,
and the conflict is over. "The
Barracuda Women" never
threaten to kill him; they want
to screw him to death. "The
Mutant Children" are absurd,
and when Wolff runs from
them, we wonder why he sim
ply doesn't call their mothers.
The Bat Men" are slow, fat,
and weak; they seemingly fall
over when Wolff breathes at
them. By the time Wolff gets to
the forbidden zone, we sense
that the Overdog has become
the underdog, and since he is a
much more vital character
anyway we practically cheer
that he will destroy Wolff.
The film rolls along without
ever trying to explain itself.
Characters enter and exit the
film randomly. There is not
reason given why anyone
would offer a 3000 megacredit
reward for saving the three
women and we never under
stand who they are. Washing
ton comes onto the scene at
first trying to run over Wolff,
but then joins him to do noth
ing but get in the way. Two
techno-rollbikers pop on the
scene to help fight the Over
dog for no reason and are in
vited toa post-Overdog squash
party on Wolff's ship, lohnson
seems privy to certain informa
tion which he withholds from
the viewer, and it kills his film.
Surely the acting is no reason
to see this film, but Michael
Ironside's performance is
worth noting.Though difficult
to gauge, since his body is in a
machine, his voice is synthe
sized, the only part we see of
him, his head, has so much
make-up that it is difficult to
tell what he is doing, and the
3D glasses often make it dif
ficult to see, he is indisputably
wicked and releases a sinister
energy, into the screen. His
"Nosferatu" make-over is not
the only quality he possesses
from the masters Lugosi and
Chaney. He is legitimately
frightening, but in the greater
context of the film, he comes
off somewhat awkward, if not
funny.
In short, if you can't get in to
see "Jedi," don't see Space
hunter. There are better things
to do, more comfortable places
to sleep and other ways to come
home with a headache.

3D glasses often make it dif
ficult to see, he is indisputably
wicked and releases a sinister
energy, into the screen. His
"Nosferatu" make-over is not
the only quality he possesses
from the masters Lugosi and
Chaney. He is legitimately
frightening, but in the greater
context of the film, he comes
off somewhat awkward, if not
funny.
In short, if you can't get in to
see "Jedi," don't see Space
hunter. There are better things
to do, more comfortable places
to sleep and other ways to come
home with a headache.

Lamont Johnson's latest film,
Spacehunter shouldn't have
very far to hunt; there was
plenty of space in the theatre
where I saw it, and for good
reason — the film is horrible.
Poor 3D movies seem a dime
a dozen, but they aren't. . .a
dime, that is; Spacehunter is
$4.50 (or $12 million) for 89
minutes. However, the viewer
will indeed take something
home after the film; a pair of
paper glasses and a headache.
The reason for the headache
is clearly that the 3D hurts. In
order to get the full effect, the
viewer must sit google-eyed,
adjusting and readjusting the
awkward glasses. One could
see by the earlier McNabb sys
tem film, Comm' at Ya, that the
process was imperfect. Here it
occasionally distracts, even
obstructs, our view, but with
out the glasses, you can't see a
thing. As if to compensate for
the silliness of it all, AMC
theatres have painted racing
stripes on theirs, but no racing
stripes, not even Vuarnet on
the side, can stop the
headaches caused by the mul
tiple screen images.
On to the film. It opens with
great promise, which it never
fulfills. In the opening mo
ments, the 3D works and we
recognize that unlike Comin'
at Ya, it will not be exploited.
The credits hover nicely as tiny
stars fly out. The film proceeds
as if it weren't in 3D, drive-ins
are projecting it flat, and tries
to exist on its own merit.
But it has no merit. Spaceh
unter is the story of Wolff
(played by Peter Strauss) who is
on a self-given mission to save
three marooned women from
the forbidden zone's evil
Overdog (Michael Ironside).
Along the way, Wolff picks up
Niki (Molly Ringwald), a sec
ond spaceman who amounts to
little more than their butler.
On their perilous journey
they battle "The Mutant Chil
dren," an elementary school
dipped in facial putty who sing,
"La, la, la, la, la," and throw
molotov cocktails, "The Bat
People", billed as "a cross be
tween the Pillsbury Dough Boy
and the Michelan Tire Man,"
and"The Barracuda Women,"
a fishy group more aptly
named "The Three-quarters
NaKed Women."

The film is nothing but a
rip-off. What it lacks in original
ity, it tries to recover in 3D. The
plot comes from Star Wars, The
Road Warrior and Raiders of the
Lost Ark, and everything down

to the soundtrack has been
seen — or heard — before. The
viewer goes through every
scene thinking, "Oh yeah, I
saw that movie," and now they
have seen it again.

The characters are ridicul
ously constructed. Wolff is so
tough, casual, and distant from
emotion that the audience
never feels that he is ever in
any genuine peril. When any

thing attacks him, he merely
blasts it with his 3D ray gun,
and the conflict is over. "The
Barracuda Women" never
threaten to kill him; they want
to screw him to death. "The
Mutant Children" are absurd,
and when Wolff runs from
them, we wonder why he sim
ply doesn't call their mothers.
The Bat Men" are slow, fat,
and weak; they seemingly fall
over when Wolff breathes at
them. By the time Wolff gets to
the forbidden zone, we sense
that the Overdog has become
the underdog, and since he is a
much more vital character
anyway we practically cheer
that he will destroy Wolff.
The film rolls along without
ever trying to explain itself.
Characters enter and exit the
film randomly. There is not
reason given why anyone
would offer a 3000 megacredit
reward for saving the three
women and we never under
stand who they are. Washing
ton comes onto the scene at
first trying to run over Wolff,
but then joins him to do noth
ing but get in the way. Two
techno-rollbikers pop on the
scene to help fight the Over
dog for no reason and are in
vited toa post-Overdog squash
party on Wolff's ship, lohnson
seems privy to certain informa
tion which he withholds from
the viewer, and it kills his film.
Surely the acting is no reason
to see this film, but Michael
Ironside's performance is
worth noting.Though difficult
to gauge, since his body is in a
machine, his voice is synthe
sized, the only part we see of
him, his head, has so much
make-up that it is difficult to
tell what he is doing, and the
3D glasses often make it dif
ficult to see, he is indisputably
wicked and releases a sinister
energy, into the screen. His
"Nosferatu" make-over is not
the only quality he possesses
