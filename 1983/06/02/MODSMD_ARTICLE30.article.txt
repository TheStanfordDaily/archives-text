# In 'Wargames', the viewer is the winner
## 
### RICHARD KYLBERG 
Finally, out of the recent
barrage of mediocre films
comes a winner, destined to
box office splendor, john
Badham's latest film re
leased just slightly after Blue
Thunder, Wargames, is a
film not only to see, but to
feel.
Unlike Bl ueTh un der,
Wargames does not expose
its viewers to wanton vio
lence. Admirably, no one
gets hurt, and the similar
action/adventure format
works much better in this
second film. The viewers
are immediately on the
edge of their seats, and are
held there throughout the
film. Sure, the plot's a bit
shaky, but as in E.T. that dis
tance from reality does not
hinder our enjoyment.
A good portion of War
games' success will surely be
credited to the accuracy
with which it targets con
temporary concerns with
nuclear annihilation and the
terrors of modern technol
ogy, here the computer.
The audience views the film
thinking, "Gee, I wish my
senator could see this," and
of course no one wants to
die in a nuclear holocaust,
nor do they wish to be en
slaved by TRS-80s, but it is
nonetheless delightful to
see these simple cries up
held on the screen.
Wargames is the story of
David (played by Matthew
Broderick), a high-schooler
who manages to link his
home computer to the
WOPR, America's nuclear
defense computer. That
might sound a little absurd,
but writers Lawrence Lasker
and Walter Parkes explain it
all very nicely, and it is sur
prisingly believable. When
David starts a game with
Goliath, WOPR, the com
puter refuses to quit, and
the Pentagon erroneously
believes that a Soviet attack
is taking place.
From there, Wargames is
a cat-and-mouse race
against the nuclear clock,
the government thinking
David is a spy while David
tries to save the world by

finding the WOPRs creator.
No violence, outstanding
suspense, popular morals,
and well-worked plotting
will undoubtedly make this
one of the summer's most
successful films.
At first glimpse, one
might shun the film as a
formula piece. It has enor
mous scope (nuclear war),
underdogs against the un
approachable establish
ment (Disney-kids against
the Pentagon), man-made
monsters of science (WOPR
and in turn, all computers),
and so on down the
money-making checklist.
But this film offers more
than a rehashing.
First, it works in part due
to an outstanding perform
ance by Badham. When he
squeezes his phone to try to
stop the WOPR from calling
him, then peeks out the
window for the FBI, he does
so with such convincing au
thority that we never for a
minute doubt that what is
happening is real.
The characters are all be
lievable. Aside from David's
occasional superheroics
(his escape from Norad is
highly improbable) and the
absurdity of WOPRs creator
(played equally absurdly by
John Wood), every charac
ter is fully developed, and
maintains his or her own
unique personality.
The film falls apart a little
when David and his
girlfriend find the WOPRs
creator. He is a bit silly,
supposedly insane but re
ally just ridiculous. His pre
sence ties things up a little
too neatly, and we feel that a
little more thought might
have provided a more satis
fying ending.
On the whole, Wargames
is entirely entertaining. The
soundtrack and special ef
fects lend themselves well
to the fevered tempo of the
suspense. Like Spielberg's
two-punch with E.T. and
Poltergeist last year,
Badham's Wargames and
Blue Thunder show that
adult themes do not neces
sarily make adult movies.
Wargames is a simple joy.

is entirely entertaining. The
soundtrack and special ef
fects lend themselves well
to the fevered tempo of the
suspense. Like Spielberg's
two-punch with E.T. and
Poltergeist last year,
Badham's Wargames and
Blue Thunder show that
adult themes do not neces
sarily make adult movies.
Wargames is a simple joy.
