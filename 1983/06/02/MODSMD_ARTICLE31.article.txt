# Campus 'humor' magazine: more of the same

### MIKE HALF 
' I should say first that review
ing each issue of the Stanford
Chaparral as it comes out makes
abou* as much sense to me as
regulariy reviewing a soap
| opera—after a while all you can
do is summarize the plot. So
think of this as a generic review
of the Chaparral, a magazine
whose ideas, format, content
and problems don't change
much from issue to issue.
| The problem as I see it with
i "La Revolucion," the Summer
,1983 Chaparral, is indeed a
familiar one: it's not very
[Sunny. This is a serious prob
lem for something labeled (al
beit in very small type) "The
Humor Magazine." Once you
decide that a humor magazine
ISsn't funny, nothing else really
[matters —all you can do is try to
decide what went wrong.
The Chaparral has main
tained through the years a con
sistent viewpoint, a fairly stan
dard one for college humor
magazines, characterized by a
hazy political radicalism, an
obsession with sexual in
nuendo and the inevitable
pseudo-intellectualism (usu
ally expressed by simulta
' neously mocking, and exhibit
ing, intellectual pretensions).
This in turn leads to a consis
tent subject matter, or to be
more precise, to the same old
subjects for satire: the conser
vative menace (Ronald Reagan,
the Hoover Institution, frater
nities), sex at Stanford or the
lack of it, conversations among

Western Culture redhots.
The Chaparral's first hand
icap, then, is that we always
know what's coming. There is
no reason why these can't be

funny subjects, but if you're
going to serve them up quarter
after quarter you'd better be
pretty good (or pretty smart). I
know some pretty smart

people who work for the
Chaparral, so that's not the
problem. And I don't think the
Chaparral's writers lack talent
(although you can strike up an

argument about that any night
here at the Daily.)
The problem, I think, isn't so
much that the Chaparral is
poorlv written as that it's writ
ten in shorthand To put it
another way: the Chaparral at
tracts bright, rather frustrated
people who have certain axes
to grind and know that they < an
grind them in public in the
pages of the Chaparral. If
you're more concerned with
scoring points off John ETway
or Mark Mancali or whatever
else is bugging you most about
Stanford life than you are with
being funny, you're not going
to be very funny. You re going
to be boring and intolerably
smug.
The first piece in the current
Chaparral is a case in point. It's
ostensibly about )ohn Elway,
but it's really (implicitly and
explicitly) about writing for the
Chaparral. Along the way, it
throws out several standard
and mildly offensive under
graduate stereotypes without
comment—almost as if they
were obligatory. And it's just
not funny.
"La Revolucion" also has it's
share of self-parodistic intel
lectual send ups: "The Com
munist Manifesto" by k-Marts,
"Ratiocination Road Trip,"
Leonid Brezhnev Goes to
Socialist Hell." The titles tell
the tale. And there are digs at
conservatism, both the violent
national variety and the bland
Stanford version: "Uncle Sam
vs. Andropov," "Psalm of
Satanford." As usual, these

take as an absolute given the
banality of middle American
experience and proceed di
rectly to put downs, without
pausing for thought.
An apparent lack of thought
is the Chaparral's overriding
problem. Everything feels like
it was d.T.hed off or thrown to
gether at the last minute. Arti
cles that try to broak away trom
the standard Chaparral
themes— like this issue >
"Bucks Hunting" and"The
Clinic'—tend, in the absence
of received notions, to take a
single idea and run it into the
ground.
In keeping with this trend,
the Chaparral's best efforts are
usually those that require the
least thought—close parodies,
like the current take-off on

Missing, that provide their
own framework and can be ex
temporized, and short, one
shot gags hke the fake USC ap
plication Chaparral talent
best when it doesn't
have to focus and fails
whenever it tries to sustain its
r,wri ideas.
You could argue that this is
the essence of college humor,
and talk about spontaneity and
unselfconsciousness. Unfor
tunately, the Chaparral lacks
both—it's predictable and
self-obsessed. The Chaparral
doesn't need new subjects or a
better sense of humor—it
needs to approach humor as a
craft (something that takes
time and thought) rather than
as an opportunity for public
therapy.
