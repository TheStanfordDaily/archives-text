Return of the ledi
Loud and explosive and edited for maximum effi
ciency, Return of the ledi would probably be a box-office
smash even if the Star Wars machinery, set in motion six
years ago, hadn't already guaranteed its success. George
Lucas, who conceived, produced and co-authored it,
and his co-writer, Lawrence Kasdan, and the director,
Richard Marquand, must have used a checklist when
they prepared this movie, and Star Wars cultists are likely
to respond positively to that aspect of it: there are two
large-scale battle scenes, a chase through the woods on
air bikes, two last-minute escapes from horrible deaths
at the hands of unspeakable monsters, a tribe of adora
ble furry creatures, a decadent court populated by
weird, slimy aliens and further developments in the rela
tionships between Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia and
Luke and his father, Darth Vader. But despite ledi's
cornucopia of audience-pleasing gimmicks, it isn't a
very good picture, and though it's undeniably exciting, I
didn't find it an enjoyable experience: I felt as if the
filmmakers were shoving lollipops down my throat.
When you say you're dissatisfied with a 24-carat hit
like ledi or Raiders of the Lost Ark, someone is always
ready to accuse you of asking too much of a movie that
aims merely to entertain — as if demanding quality
rather than quantity of thrills were effete and pretenti
ous and ungrateful. But what I resent about ledi and
Raiders isn't that they seek to give audiences a good
time, but that their strategy is impersonal, calculated,
nakedly commercial. They offer little evidence of a first
rate imagination at work, or of craftsmen in love with
their work — and they're brutal besides, because when
you don't have real beauty and wonder, the way Close
Encounters or The Empire Strikes Back did, or E.T. does,
then brutality furnishes the extra push you need to con
nect with a mass audience. Sojedi has more destruction
in it than any movie I can think of since The Road Warrior
— and Alan Hume's photography doesn't approach the
grandeur of the apocalyptic pyrotechnics Dean Semmler
brought to that noisy Australian waste orgy.
George Lucas has placed himself in the triumphant
center of the Star Wars series, so many people still don't
realize that he only directed the first installment. In fact,
the difference between ledi and The Empire Strikes Rack
has mostly to do with directors, though Lucas did his
best to keep Irvin Kershner's name in the background
during the Empire publicity, and ledi's director, Richard
Marquand, is on record as castigating Kershner (in
Time's cover story two weeks ago) for disturbing some
of the sacred qualities of the Star Wars myth. In fact,
Kershner is responsible for discovering the mythic na
ture of the series — and for setting our expectations at a
level apparently too high for Marquand to meet them.
Empire, with its eerily beautiful landscapes, its extraor
dinary fluidity and breathless pace, its nuanced per
formances, its endlessly inventive designs and hom
mages to Cocteau and Fritz Lang and Shakespeare, was a
child's dream of a movie fantasy and a tribute to the
wizardry of a master director. It was also deeply moving,
the way the best fantasies — L. Frank Baum's and C.S.
Lewis'and Tolkien's — always are: when Luke Skywalker
raised his lightsaber to challenge the evil strength of
Darth Vader and learned that his adversary was his own
father, Kershner touched a primal base and created the
substance of legend.
Return of the ledi, by contrast, is rather clunky and
ordinary, though Lucas' story fits a worthy finale to the
epic, with a number of high-gear emotional set pieces —
between Luke and his Jedi teacher, Yoda, Luke and Leia,
Luke and the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Luke and
Vader — provided. Under Marquand (who last directed
the grim, unsympathetic spy thriller Eye of the Needle),
these scenes read as long, tiresome gaps in the action —
dead spots, obligatory pauses for sentiment. Marquand
can keep his camera moving in the battle episodes, but
he doesn't know what to do when the action stops; his
tone sticks somewhere between perfunctoriness and
obeisance. He gives us far too much time to think about
the dumb dialogue (Kasdan and Lucas haven't managed
to supply a shred of wit), and he strands the actors, who
are even worse than they were in Star Wars. (There, at
least, their awkward performances enhanced the play
ful, cartoony style of the picture. No one in Star Wars was
called upon to give a real performance.)
Mark Hamill hasn't lost all the depth he brought to
Luke in Empire, but he's far from memorable; at best,
what he offers is respectable, TV-style acting. But Carrie
Fisher seems less human than ever (and she's on screen
too much for us to pretend we don't notice), and Harri
son Ford has set his dial for photogenic goofiness; he
doesn't even bother with the snarling, rebellious side of
Han Solo anymore (though it made him a star). In his first

scene, when Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) re
leases him from the carbonite frieze he was trapped in at
the end of Empire, he does such a pitiful job ot expres
sing agony that you think you're watching an amateur
demonstration ot nineteenth-century acting tech
niques And the newcomers — Sebastian Shaw as Ana
kin Skywalker, the man inside Darth Vader's mask, and,
lan McDiarmid as the Emperor — are strictly minor
league. Considering how long we've waited for the Em
peror, the personification of the Dark Side of the Force,
before whom even Darth Vader trembles, we might have
deserved better than this mincing, curled-lip villain,
who sounds like a community-stage Ebenezer Scrooge
and looks roughly like a lecherous monk with designs on
the leading man.
Despite all the noise and motion, ledi has only one
exceptional action sequence (the air bike chase) and,
weighed against this, a number of impossible dramatic
problems. The greatest imaginative effort went into the
design of the aliens — in the palace of labba the Hutt
(where Han's frozen image hangs) and elsewhere — but
Lucas and Marquand have miscalculated here: we care
so little about the human beings in this film that we feel
overrun by elaborate masks and outer costumes. And —
as in Raiders of the Lost Ark — the tension of many of the
climaxes is so easily defused that they turn out to be
non-dramatic. When )abba the Hutt plummets Luke into
the den of an enormous monster (it looks like a multi
toothed version of the mutants in Prophecy — hardly a
recommendation), Luke defeats it with such speed and
apparent ease that we wonder why Jabba's earlier vic
tims didn't use their brains. Furthermore, in what is
clearly meant to be an emotional high point, Luke, cap
tured by his tather, refuses to move and tells Vader that
he'll have to kill him in order to transport him to the
Emperor; but Vader simply skirts the issue and com
mands a couple of guards to bring Luke along. Didn't
anyone on this imperially-budgeted project bother to
think this scene out in dramatic terms?
ledi bangs and crashes on and on, while we wonder
why the filmmakers built an entire semi-comic sequence
around the most uninteresting character in the entire
Star Wars trilogy, C3PO (Anthony Daniels), but forgot to
provide a moment of recognition when Leia, chained to
labba the Hutt's gargantuan belly and clad in the de
meaning garb of a concubine, sees her sweetheart, Han,
for the first time since he's been melted out of the
carbonite. Or why they took 10 minutes to set up a
military trick — luring the guards out of a secret entrance
to an enemy ship — that looks like child's play. Return of
the ledi works on the most basic level — it keeps moving
— and it exhausts you so that you think you've been
somewhere. But taken on any other terms it's an expen
sive cheat.
The State of Things
The State of Things is German director Wim Wenders'
revenge on Francis Ford Coppola, who hired him to
make Hammett (as his premier American picture) and
then fired him in mid-project. It's a luxurious bit of
self-aggrandizement, with Wenders rendered by Patrick
Bauchau as a noble existential sufferer called Friedrich
Munro — known to his best friends as Fritz, so that we
can see the intended parallels between Wenders and
Fritz Lang, another gifted artist wrecked by Hollywood.
(Bauchau even has a director's chair with "Friedrich M."
printed on the back — an allusion to Lang's masterpiece,
M.) Coppola surfaces in the final half hour in the person
of a precious, phony slob named Gordon (amusingly
sketched by Allen Goorwitz), who buries himself in a
mobile home owned by his bodyguard and behaves like
a Mafioso. At the end, a sniper mows both Friedrich and
Gordon down, so Wenders achieves the vengeance he's
obviously been dreaming of as well as a romantic
masochistic cinematic-fantasy end for himself.
But The State of Things is so willfully obtuse and
dreary that by the time Friedrich gets out of Portugal,
where he and his cast and crew have been languishing
away waiting for Gordon to come up with fresh funds to
pick up the shooting, and into souless, neon-lit L.A.
(where Wenders turns on his specialty — urban
anomie), we're ready to shake Gordon-Coppola's hand.
Among the assorted celebrities Wenders has assembled
for this exercise in arthouse masturbation are Samuel
Fuller as Friedrich's photographer (standing in for
Joseph Biroc, the veteran who worked with Wenders on
Hammett), Paul Getty 111 as the screenwriter (read Denis
O'Flaherty, who wrote one version of Hammett), and
Roger Corman as Gordon's lawyer. It features Viva
Auder as the script girl, Isabelle Weingarten as a pixieish
actress who keeps reading from a copy of The Searchers
on the soundtrack, Jeffrey Kime as an actor who spends a
good deal of time in the bathtub, and Geoffrey Carey

(the liveliest of the bunch) as another actor with a frizzy
mop and a funny, traumatic past. Wenders and his pho
tographer, Henri Alekan, capture them in breathtaking
black-and-white compositions against the desolate sky
and sea — visually, the film is absolutely smashing — but
they muse and wander as if they'd just discovered the
puzzle picture poses Antonioni perfected two decades
ago. The State of Things defies logic — it's an avant
garde relic.
The Grey Fox
Frank Tidy's magnificent cinematography for Phillip
Borsos' The Grey Fox is almost a good enough reason to
see the movie. There are magical images: a locomotive
stretching across a mountain-laid line of track, the bil
lowing white smoke proliferating as it approaches;
another train gathering steam, seemingly borne upon its
smoke like a huge mechanical dragon on a pair of deli
cate white wings; boats drifting across a lake washed
with the mauve glow of early evening. Borsos clearly has
talent, but it's a painter's talent (at least at this stage); he

doesn't know how to pace a scene or how to direct his
actors so that dialogue sounds like something more than
dead air. This exquisitely shot, frustratingly static Cana
dian feature traces the career of stagecoach robber Bill
Miner (Richard Farnsworth), known as the "Gentleman
Bandit," after his release from San Quentin in 1901 and
his re-entry into a life of crime, this time as a train
robber. John Hunter's script promises to show us how
Miner adjusts to the changes wrought by the three dec
ades he spent behind bars and by the advent of a new
century, and it makes passes at themes of social injus
tice. But these are red herrings, like the feminist preten
sions of Miner's lover, photographer Kate Flynn (Jackie
Burroughs). Hunter and Borsos would like to justify
Miner's choice to return to thievery as the only alterna
tive for an ex-con who wishes to retain his indepen
dence and dignity, but even dressed up as it is here, this
is the same kind of dopey thinking that marred Michael
Mann's exciting pulp thriller Thief. Bill Miner doesn't
come across as much of a folk hero, despite the fact that
Farnsworth always seems to be posing for a daguer
rotype.
