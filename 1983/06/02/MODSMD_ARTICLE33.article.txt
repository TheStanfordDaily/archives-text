Children of Paradise (1945)
★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Perhaps the most beloved
"art" film of all time — at least
in this country. The setting is
Paris in the early 19th century;
the characters are actors and
mimes; the theme is the rela
tionship between life and art.
Jean-Louis Barrault plays Bap
tiste Deburau, the mime; the
incomparable beauty Arletty is
Garance, whom he adores;
Pierre Brasseur is Lemaitre,
whose mistress she is; and
Maria Casares is the actress who
worships Baptiste. They are all
splendid. Marcel Came
directed, and the poet Jacques
Prevert, Carne's frequent col
la bora to r, wrote the
screenplay.
Plays Monday with A Day in
the Country.

A Day in the Country (1936)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean Renoir filmed Guy de
Maupassant's short story about
the double seduction of a
mother and daughter on a pic
nic by the Seine, in 1936, the
same year as his Lower Depths
and a year before Grand /J
-lusion; it ushered in the
greatest creative period in the
career of the greatest of all
French filmmakers. In A Day in
the Country, he pays homage to
his father's paintings. This may
be the most exquisite 40
minutes in the history of mov
ies. With Jeanne Morken,
Gabrielle, Sylvia Bataille,
George Darnaux and Renoir
himself.
Plays Monday with Children
of Paradise.

Live and Let Die (1973)
Kresge Auditorium
Roger Moore began his
tenure in the James Bond pic
, tures with this particularly silly,
pretty enjoyable adventure
about voodoo; after Sean Con
nery, he seemed distinctly
declasse, but at least he was less
inept than George Lazenby
(who had played Bond in On
Her Majesty's Secret Service).
The plot placed Bond squarely
in the territory of the race war
movies so popular in 1972 and
1973, but the film is far from of
fensive. Guy Hamilton directed
a cast that included Yaphet Kot
to, Jane Seymour, Clifton
James, David Hedison and
Bernard Lee; the best part of
the movie is the intriguing title
sequence featuring the theme
song (performed by Paul Mc-
Cartney & Wings).
Plays Saturday evening.

The Graduate (1967) ★
Memorial Auditorium
Mike Nichols' satirical com
edy made an immediate con
nection with young audiences,
and it has never lost it, even
though the broad revue style is
dated now and the jangling ed
iting and Nichols' insistent use
of close-up were always an
aesthetic assault. The major
drawback to the Calder Will
ingham-Buck Henry screenplay
— the one-sided, unsubtle at
tack on the bourgeois values of
the older generation — is, iron
ically, probably what keeps it
popular. On the other hand,
some of the dialogue has stayed
remarkably fresh, and there are
three highly commendable
performances: a full-scale one
by Anne Bancroft as embit
tered, overpoweringly seduc
tive Mrs. Robinson, an im
aginative comic one by Dustin
Hoffman as the confused hero,
Benjamin Braddock, and a
small, generally ignored one by
Katharine Ross as Bancroft's
daughter, Elaine, whom Ben
jamin courts. Less impressive
work is done by Murray Hamil
ton as Mr. Robinson, William
Daniels as Mr. Braddock and
Elizabeth Wilson as Mrs. Brad
dock. (No wonder the older
generation gets roasted in this
picture, represented as it is by
three of the least attractive,
least believable actors in the
business.) Richard
shows up in a bit at the rooming
house (run by Norman Fell).
The songs, for anyone who has
resided in a cave for the last 15
years, are by Paul Simon and Art
Garfunkel.
Plays Sunday evening.

Phantom of the Paradise
(1974) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Brian De Palma made this
wild, hilarious spoof of horror
movies and rock singers — ap
parently with the kind of free
dom he enjoyed in his under
ground movie days. The plot is
basically modelled on The
Phantom of the Opera, with
Paul Williams (who wrote the
satirical songs, which are, sur
prisingly, wickedly clever) as
the impressario, Jessica Harper
as the promising young singer,
and William Finley as the
brilliant composer who is
turned into a monster and re
sides in the upper reaches of
the theater. In this case, the
composer's work is a "pop can
tata" version of Faust, and De
Palma (who wrote as well as
directed) plays on Faust almost
as much as on The Phantom: on
one level the composer
Winslow is Faust and the im
pressario Swan
Mephistopheles, and on anoth
er — an ingenious extension —
this Mephistopheles is also his
own Faust. The movie is replete
with visual and vocal refer
ences: there are borrowings
from The Picture of Dorian
Gray, Psycho, The Godfather,
The Manchurian Candidate
and even Bye Bye Birdie. The
unusually winning cast also in
cludes Gerrit Graham as a pop
idol and, as three different rock
trios, Harold Oblong, Jeffrey
Comanor and Archie Hahn.
Watch out for Jessica Harper's
audition number, "Special to
Me"; aside from Pennies from
Heaven, it's the best (and
toughest) thing she's ever
done.
Plays next Friday and Satur
day (June 10 & 11) with The
Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Masculine Feminine (1965)
Fox, Redwood City ★
Jean-Luc Godard calls the
young heroes of his
astonishingly funny and deli
cate political comedy "the chil
dren of Marx and Coca-Cola";
they are the youth of the mid
'6os, who are leftists and sexual
experimenters. Jean-Pierre
Leaud and Chantal Goya play
the protagonists. Godard as
sembled the movie in the eclec
tic, collage fashion he is famous
for; it works so brilliantly that
you feel high while you're
watching, and afterwards you
wonder whether Godard better
qualifies as the Joyce or the
Picasso of the cinema.
Plays Wednesday with Mon
tenegro.
No Nukes (1980)
Fox, Redwood City
This extremely uneven con
cert film suffers from too many
zoom shots and too much jazzy
editing, and the anti-nuke
documentary clips don't merge
well with the concert footage.
But there's a lot of good music,
and the Bruce Springsteen
numbers are truly amazing. (He
does "The River," "Thunder
Road" and a few snatches of

old-time rock 'n' roll.) The sec
ond best performer is James
Taylor, who has a gleam in his
eye and enough presence, one
suspects, to light up a stadium
the size of Los Angeles; hesings
"Your Smilin' Face" and, in
tandem with Carly Simon, the
memorable "Mockingbird."
Jackson Browne performs
"Running on Empty" and
"Before the Deluge," the
Doobie Brothers "Dependin'
on You" and "What a Fool Be
lieves" (Mike McDonald's
weird, fuzzy tones seem to res
onate through his beard and
moustache — and he looks a lot
like a bear in this movie),
Crosby, Stills and Nash "Suite
Judy Blue Eyes," Gil Scott-Her
on "We Almost Lost Detroit,"
etc. Five directors are listed in
the credits: Barbara Kopple,
Haskell Wexler, Danny
Goldberg, Anthony Potenz and
Julian Schlossberg.
Plays next Friday, Saturday
and Sunday (June 10-12).
The Adventures of Robin
Hood (1938) ★
Fox, Redwood City
The best way to describe the
experience of seeing this mov
ie, one of the early Technicolor
adventures, is to say that it is to
swashbucklers what The
Wizard of Oz is to musicals.
Seton I. Miller and Norman Re
illy Raine, who wrote the script,
must have been grinning for
weeks, and the pleasure that
the spirited cast takes in per
forming it is highly infectious.
Errol Flynn had his ideal role in
Robin Hood; Olivia De
Havilland, as Maid Marian, is as
beautiful as a fairy tale princess;
Alan Hale plays Little John,
Eugene Pallette is Friar Tuck,
Basil Rathbone is the villainous
Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Melville
Cooper is the Sheriff of Not
tingham, Claude Rains is evil
Prince John, lan Hunter is King
Richard, Una O'Connor and
Herbert Mundin are Bess and
Much the Miller. William
Keighley initiated the film, but
it was completed by Michael
Curtiz. There are many un
forgettable sequences, but per
haps the best is the entrance of
Robin in the midst of Prince
John's feast with a stag on his
shoulder.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with The Inspector General.
Three Women (1977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Robert Altman made this
enigmatic dream fantasy (re
portedly suggested by one of
his own dreams) between Buf
falo bill and the Indians and A
Wedding — when his reputa
tion was beginning to slip. It's
still a stunning demonstration
of technique, with some won
derful comic passages between
Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek
in the first half — before the
film starts to imitate Persona
and the two women's person
alities melt into each other. On
balance, it's a parched, unsatis
fying movie, but with enough
to look at to justify spending a

couple of hours with it.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Come Back to the 5 &
Dime, limmy Dean, Jimmy
Dean
Fast Times at Ridgemont
High
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Amy Herkerling, the debut
director, has a knack for black
out comedy, and the lightly
parodistic tone she's found is
just right for Cameron Crowe's
script, based on his own book
about kids attending a sub
urban California high school.
This movie may be slight, but
it's pleasurable and shrewdly
observed, and it features a sur
prising number of lovely small
performances (from Jennifer
Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates,
Richard Roman us, Brian
Backer, Judge Reinhold and es
pecially Sean Penn as the stoner
Spicoli).
Plays today and tomorrow
with Rock 'n' Roll High School.
The Postman Always Rings
Twice (1946) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
James M. Cain's tight,
purplish erotic thriller — a
swift, satisfying read — has
been filmed twice in this coun
try and once in Italy (as Os
sessione, Luchino Visconti's
first picture). This version,
adapted by Harry Ruskin and
Niven Busch, directed by Tay
Garnett and photographed by
Sidney Wagner, is both sleek
and (enjoyably) sleazy, and it
stars Lana Turner in her most
characteristic performance, as a
bored, horny, murderous
femme fatale (the Cain special
ty). Playing opposite her — as
the sucker enamored of her —
is one of the most vivid actors of
the period, John Garfield. With
Cecil Kellaway, Hume Cronyn,
Leon Ames, Audrey Totter and
Alan Reed.
Plays Thursday with Mildred
Pierce.
Dark Passage (1947)
Festival, Palo Alto
The most dismal of the four
Bogart-Bacall pictures, though
some of it (like Agnes
Moorehead's hysterics) isamus
ingly bad. Delmer Daves, adapt
ing a David Goodis novel and
directing it as well, makes the
laughable error of keeping
Bogart wrapped in bandages
for most of the film, so there's
almost nothing to watch. (Bacall
doesn't act; she just looks wor
ried.) Bruce Bennett is in the
supporting cast.
Plays through Wednesday
with High Sierra.
