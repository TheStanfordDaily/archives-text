# Card World Series bound after regional win
## 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Stanford found enough ways to win
last weekend that they ran, hit and
fielded their way into the College
World Series for the second straight
year.
The Cardinal opens the 37th annual
"circus" in Omaha, Neb., tomorrow
against Oklahoma State at 6:10 p.m.
PDT.
The only thing consistent about Stan
ford's march through the double
elimination West Region I Tournament
last weekend was that they did not lose.
Their methods were as varied as a good
pitcher's repertoire.
In Sunday's final, the Cardinal crept
out to a 6-1 lead against UC-Santa Bar
bara, who had surprised many by
knocking out San Diego State earlier in
the day, and ran away late for an 11-5
win.
Tournament Most Valuable Player
Vince Sakowski was responsible for the
Cardinal's first three runs. He scored
from third in the second inning when
he danced off the base, forcing pitcher
Barry Dacus to balk, and he drove in
two runs with a single to left in the
third.
The Cardinal added two runs in the
sixth and one in the seventh, but All-
Tournament first baseman Paul Smith
needed only one swing in the top of the

eighth inning — a three-run homer off
starter lohn Radtke — to bring the
Gauchos to within one run.
But the Cardinal disobeyed coach
Mark Marquess' directive and
exploded for five runs in the bottom of
the eighth.
"I told them to get one run," Mar
quess said. "With a two-run lead you
don't have to guard the line and you can
play your regular game. But I don't
think I'll yell at them."
Starter John Radtke, now 3-3, pitched
seven-plus innings for the win and
freshman Kevin Kunkel was nearly flaw
less in relief to pick up his first save.
Stanford did not blast highly-touted
San Diego State out of Sunken
Diamond in their second-round 4-3,
11th-hour and 11th-inning win. They
just used a little luck and a lot of guts.
With the score tied at 3-3, freshman
Mark Davis reached base in the top of
the 11th inning after he was hit by a
pitch for the 17th time this season.
Davis tagged first base and moved to
second when third baseman |oe Holvey
had to make a one-handed catch
against the bullpen rail on Mike Al
drete's foul pop-up.
A pitching change and one out later,
reliever Kevin Piper's pitch to Mike De-
Benon bounced in front of the plate
and skittered through the generous

foul area in Sunken Diamond and
careened along the backstop.
Davis was off to the races and Stan
ford third base coach Dean Stotz flag
ged him home ahead of the throw for a
one-run lead.
San Diego State threatened in their
half of the 11th because the Cardinal
fielding, which had been as frigid as the
blustery wind into Sunken Diamond all
afternoon, acted up again.
Catcher |ohn Carlson laid down a
bunt in front of the plate and pitcher
left Ballard and catcher Rick Lundblade
both fell down chasing it. Chris Canniz
zaro followed with another bunt and
Ballard, normally an exceptional fiel
der, booted it and both runners were
safe.
But sophomore john Verducci shut
down the Aztecs with a couple of crisp
plays at shortstop. With both runners
moving on the pitch, |oe Holvey top
ped a high-bouncer to shortstop. Ver
ducci charged the ball, scooped it on a
short hop and made a tough play look
easy for the first out.
The Cardinal then walked Flavio Al
faro to set up the double play and Bal
lard got Steve Moscaret to ground to
Verducci, who stepped on second and
fired to Aldrete for the game-ending
double play.
Ballard, B-2, pitched five innings of
shutout, two-hit relief for the win.

Friday, the Cardinal pounded Ore
gon State into submission 14-0 for their
third playoff romp over the Beavers in
two years. Brian Myers, 10-4, pitched
Stanford's first complete-game shutout
of the year.
The Cardinal jumped on OSU starter
Jeff Reece for four runs in the first in
ning on a one-run triple by Mark Davis
and a two-run double by Sakowski.
Eric Hardgrave lined one of his classic
home runs out of Sunken Diamond for
three runs in the fifth. The Cardinal also
scored two runs in the fourth and single
runs in the sixth and seventh.
Hardgrave said the long layoff before
the tournament had the Cardinal antsy
to start swinging the bat again.
"We were so anxious to play,"
Hardgrave said. "We were thinking
'I et's get this thing going.' You can only
do so much in practice so we came out
swinging the bats and tried to be ag
gressive."
Stanford's three-game frolic through
the West regional was impressive
enough to move them up to a No. 3
rating in both major polls. But Ok
lahoma State presents a formidable
first-round opponent.
Ranked No. 2 by Baseball America
and No. 4 by Collegiate Baseball, the
Cowboys waltzed through the tough
