## Tournament MVP Sakowski leads Card to World Series 
### SID SPAETH Senior sports writer 
Vince Sakowski is V. Sak to his
teammates and a Sad Sack to no one.
The senior third baseman led
Stanford to a return trip to the Col
lege World Series last weekend and
was named the Most Valuable Player
of the Western Region I Tournament
held at Stanford's Sunken Diamond.
With a seven for 15 performance
in Stanford's three wins, Sakowski
increased his batting average to .350.
Sakowski also added five RBI, in
cluding a pair in the Cardinal's 11-5
championship game win over UC-
Santa Barbara. He walked home with
Stanford's first run after his jitter
bugging off third base forced
GauJio starter Barry Dacus to stop
his motion and be called for a balk.
Sakowski's contribution cannot
be capsulized in mere statistics. He
is the man that served a three-year
apprenticeship behind such formid
able infielders as Paul Zuvella, Bob
DeCosta, Steve Buechelle and Lor
ing Davies, before not only stepping
into a starting role, but a leadership
role.
In last year's World Series, Texas'
Tracy Depheid made a running stab
of a pinch-hit Sakowski blast that
was headed toward the wall in the
11th inning. Depheid easily doubled

Bob Hausladen off second base, the
Cardinal went down to defeat and
Sakowski headed into the summer
with a .173 career batting average.
Only a small circle of people
around the baseball club saw the po
tential hidden behind Sakowski's
hard-luck career. Sakowski spent
the summer playing for the national
semi-pro champion Santa Maria In
dians and came into the season
primed for a starting role.
Sunday, nobody was smiling hear
tier about going back to the World
Series than Sakowski, who helped
turn around a struggling young team
whose hole in the middle made it
look like a bagel.
"A lot of people wrote us off
early," Sakowski said after the Car
dinal's championship game win.
"People say the strength of a
baseball team is up the middle and
we had rookies all the way up the
middle. We had (freshman Mark)
Davis in center, (sophomore john)
Verducci at short, (sophomore Pete)
Stanicek at second and Lyle (Smith)
and (Rick) Lundblade behind the
plate.
"They have been our strength.
They have really set the tone for us
defensively. Those two guys up the
middle (Verducci and Stanicek) have
been the key for us. They are playing

like seniors. They make every single
play. Even a lot of the tough ones."
Still, it was up to Mike Aldrete and
Eric Flardgrave, from whom
everyone expected great years, and
Sakowski to pull the team together
after the core of last year's team was
gone and the new club started out at
3-4.
"After we were swept — make that
manhandled — by Fullerton early in
the season," Sakowski said,
"Hardgrave, Aldrete and myself sat
down and decided we're going to
have to pick ourselves up or it was
going to be a long season.
"Everybody was saying, Hey, we
don't have (red-shirted centerfielder
Darryl) Stephens, or we don't have
Buechelle (who signed a pro con
tract), or we don't have (then injured
leftfielder Mike) Dotterer.'
"We decided Screw that.' Let's do
it ourselves and if we can get the
other guys going, all the better."
Hardgrave — .363, 23 home runs
and 80 RBI — and Aldrete — .382,12
homers and 60 RBI — held up their
ends of the deal, Sakowski did more
than expected and everyone fol
lowed.
The three fraternity brothers form
possibly the most feared 3-4-5 line
up punch in the nation.
Aldrete at No. 3 was as awesome
as ever, Hardgrave at cleanup shat
tered school marks for homers and
RBI, despite a Ute-season tendency
for pitchers to walk him. That's
where Sakowski came in — at No. 5
— and the pressure situations he
faced were plentiful.
"They (pitchers) are afraid of one
swing of the bat from Hardgrave,"
Stanford coach Mark Marquess said.
"But Sakowski has gotten a lot of big
hits. If you don't have someone be
hind him to do that, Eric is never

going to get any pitches."
Hardgrave set the tone for the
tournament in Friday's game against
Oregon State when he sent a Jeff
Reece pitch so far out to left field
they had to mail it back. Fie walked
four times during the tournament
and was hit with a pitch once.
Sakowski picked up the slack in his
MVP sort of way.
"Sakowski has really been picking
me up," Hardgrave said after Fri
day's win. "When they walked me,
Vinnie comes back and makes the
big hit that broke their backs."
But to Sakowski, who Marquess
calls "a team guy," it is only one step
closer to that one common goal — a
national championship.
"Last year, we went to Omaha
with a team that overpowered
people," Sakowski said. "We can
still overpower people, but our key
is pitching and defense and our abil
ity to get the ball in play. There were
umpteen times when someone had
two strikes on them and came back
and got the ball in play.
"I think we have a good chance
this year and having been there will
help. We know what it's like to go
through all the hoopla and then to
go out on the field and play. Last year
we had a tough loss to Texas and
came back (emotionally) down
against Maine. This year we have
come back after tough losses and
picked up wins."
Marquess said that, like Sakowski,
the 1983 season has been somewhat
of a surprise. Sakowski finally got his
chance to play after his teachers
moved on to professional baseball,
and going into tomorrow's opening
of the 37th World Series, win, lose or
draw, V. Sak ain't a Sad Sack any
more.

With a seven for 15 performance
in Stanford's three wins, Sakowski
increased his batting average to .350.
Sakowski also added five RBI, in
cluding a pair in the Cardinal's 11-5
championship game win over UC-
Santa Barbara. He walked home with
Stanford's first run after his jitter
bugging off third base forced
GauJio starter Barry Dacus to stop
his motion and be called for a balk.
Sakowski's contribution cannot
be capsulized in mere statistics. He
is the man that served a three-year
apprenticeship behind such formid
able infielders as Paul Zuvella, Bob
DeCosta, Steve Buechelle and Lor
ing Davies, before not only stepping
into a starting role, but a leadership
role.
In last year's World Series, Texas'
Tracy Depheid made a running stab
of a pinch-hit Sakowski blast that
was headed toward the wall in the
11th inning. Depheid easily doubled

Bob Hausladen off second base, the
Cardinal went down to defeat and
Sakowski headed into the summer
with a .173 career batting average.
Only a small circle of people
around the baseball club saw the po
tential hidden behind Sakowski's
hard-luck career. Sakowski spent
the summer playing for the national
semi-pro champion Santa Maria In
dians and came into the season
primed for a starting role.
Sunday, nobody was smiling hear
tier about going back to the World
Series than Sakowski, who helped
turn around a struggling young team
whose hole in the middle made it
look like a bagel.
"A lot of people wrote us off
early," Sakowski said after the Car
dinal's championship game win.
"People say the strength of a
baseball team is up the middle and
we had rookies all the way up the
middle. We had (freshman Mark)
Davis in center, (sophomore john)
Verducci at short, (sophomore Pete)
Stanicek at second and Lyle (Smith)
and (Rick) Lundblade behind the
plate.
"They have been our strength.
They have really set the tone for us
defensively. Those two guys up the
middle (Verducci and Stanicek) have
been the key for us. They are playing

like seniors. They make every single
play. Even a lot of the tough ones."
Still, it was up to Mike Aldrete and
Eric Flardgrave, from whom
everyone expected great years, and
Sakowski to pull the team together
after the core of last year's team was
gone and the new club started out at
3-4.
"After we were swept — make that
manhandled — by Fullerton early in
the season," Sakowski said,
"Hardgrave, Aldrete and myself sat
down and decided we're going to
have to pick ourselves up or it was
going to be a long season.
"Everybody was saying, Hey, we
don't have (red-shirted centerfielder
Darryl) Stephens, or we don't have
Buechelle (who signed a pro con
tract), or we don't have (then injured
leftfielder Mike) Dotterer.'
"We decided Screw that.' Let's do
it ourselves and if we can get the
other guys going, all the better."
Hardgrave — .363, 23 home runs
and 80 RBI — and Aldrete — .382,12
homers and 60 RBI — held up their
ends of the deal, Sakowski did more
than expected and everyone fol
lowed.
The three fraternity brothers form
possibly the most feared 3-4-5 line
up punch in the nation.
Aldrete at No. 3 was as awesome
as ever, Hardgrave at cleanup shat
tered school marks for homers and
RBI, despite a Ute-season tendency
for pitchers to walk him. That's
where Sakowski came in — at No. 5
— and the pressure situations he
faced were plentiful.
"They (pitchers) are afraid of one
swing of the bat from Hardgrave,"
Stanford coach Mark Marquess said.
"But Sakowski has gotten a lot of big
hits. If you don't have someone be
hind him to do that, Eric is never

going to get any pitches."
Hardgrave set the tone for the
tournament in Friday's game against
Oregon State when he sent a Jeff
Reece pitch so far out to left field
they had to mail it back. Fie walked
four times during the tournament
and was hit with a pitch once.
Sakowski picked up the slack in his
MVP sort of way.
"Sakowski has really been picking
me up," Hardgrave said after Fri
day's win. "When they walked me,
Vinnie comes back and makes the
big hit that broke their backs."
But to Sakowski, who Marquess
calls "a team guy," it is only one step
closer to that one common goal — a
national championship.
"Last year, we went to Omaha
with a team that overpowered
people," Sakowski said. "We can
still overpower people, but our key
is pitching and defense and our abil
ity to get the ball in play. There were
umpteen times when someone had
two strikes on them and came back
and got the ball in play.
"I think we have a good chance
this year and having been there will
help. We know what it's like to go
through all the hoopla and then to
go out on the field and play. Last year
we had a tough loss to Texas and
came back (emotionally) down
against Maine. This year we have
come back after tough losses and
picked up wins."
Marquess said that, like Sakowski,
the 1983 season has been somewhat
of a surprise. Sakowski finally got his
chance to play after his teachers
moved on to professional baseball,
and going into tomorrow's opening
of the 37th World Series, win, lose or
draw, V. Sak ain't a Sad Sack any
more.
