# Faculty could restrict research
## Rally protests SSRL research 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Senior staff writer 
More than 200 students walked to
University President Donald Ken
nedy's office in a "Dead Week death
march" yesterday to protest a pro
posed research project at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory (SSRL) that would aid research
on nuclear weapons.
The march followed a 45-minute
rally in White Plaza where over 300
students listened to anti-nuclear ac
tivist Daniel Ellsberg tell them that
"the way to be free is to reject the
reasoning that you're part of an in
stitution that's for sale."
Mary James, an engineering physi
cist at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, said Kennedy is tel
ling staff members at SLAC that "it's
not their responsibility" to protest
their proposal.
"It's always legitimate to stand up
on the breaks to prevent death,"
James said.
Protestors oppose the proposal
because it would involve research on
nuclear weapon-pumped x-ray las
ers, a type of space-based Anti-
Ballistic Missiles, and would alter the
nature of SSRL and SLAC, which have
never participated in nuclear
weapons research before.
In a related development, Ken
nedy met with an audience of about
20 SLAC faculty and about 12 staff
members last Thursday.
At the meeting, James asked
whether SLAC's faculty can tighten
its research restrictions to preclude
research to which the faculty is op
posed. Kennedy told the faculty such
a move is conceivable, but that it
might have repercussions among
those "3000 miles to the East" who
make decisions on research approp
riations.
James said she and other staff
members at SLAC will attempt to
convince the faculty to tighten its re

search restrictions as a next move to
prevent the proposal from being ac
cepted.
Fifteen SLAC faculty members
signed a letter in January to the
Committee on Research opposing
the proposal at SSRL. James said,
however, that although many faculty
members oppose the proposal it will
be difficult to convince them to alter
SLAC's research restrictions.
The proposal still has not been ap
proved by the director of SSRL, Ar
thur Bienenstock. As of last night
Bienenstock had not decided to ac
cept the proposal. He added that he
did not know when he will make his
decision.
More than 50 SLAC staff and faculty
carrying placards saying "Weapons
Work is for Wimps," "Hell No, We
Won't Glow" and "Welcome to SLAC
— we build nuclear weapons" pro
tested outside the meeting.
In yesterday's protest, the mar
chers walked single file into Ken
nedy's office to drop 100 signed "de
ath warrants" on the receptionist's
desk. The "death warrants," printed
by Stanford Against Nuclear
Weapons Research, were titled
"Stanford is no place for the arms
race" and protested the fact that
"Kennedy has refused our request to
hold an open meeting where he
might hear the concerns of all com
munity members and respond di
rectly to our objections."
According to Jon Adelstein, a
member of the group, the death war
rants are supposed to symbolize the
students' desire for the death of the
proposal.
On May 5, Kennedy reaffirmed his
commitment to the University policy
that rejects restrictions on research
because of its possible applications
in a statement to the more than 2500
students who have signed petitions
aeainst the controversial resparrh
proposal. Kennedy's statement also
said he would decline to attend an
"open forum" because he already
addressed the Academic Council on
the subject and met with student
groups.
Adelstein said after the rally that it
demonstrated "that there is a large
and growing group ot people who
are supportive of a change in SLAC s
policy. To protect the freedom of re
searchers, and to protect SLAC and
SSRL from the strain of weapons re
search, we will struggle to detend the
integrity of our University."

In yesterday's protest, the mar
chers walked single file into Ken
nedy's office to drop 100 signed "de
ath warrants" on the receptionist's
desk. The "death warrants," printed
by Stanford Against Nuclear
Weapons Research, were titled
"Stanford is no place for the arms
race" and protested the fact that
"Kennedy has refused our request to
hold an open meeting where he
might hear the concerns of all com
munity members and respond di
rectly to our objections."
According to Jon Adelstein, a
member of the group, the death war
rants are supposed to symbolize the
students' desire for the death of the
proposal.
On May 5, Kennedy reaffirmed his
commitment to the University policy
that rejects restrictions on research
because of its possible applications
in a statement to the more than 2500
students who have signed petitions
aeainst the controversial resparrh
proposal. Kennedy's statement also
said he would decline to attend an
"open forum" because he already
addressed the Academic Council on
the subject and met with student
groups.
Adelstein said after the rally that it
demonstrated "that there is a large
and growing group ot people who
are supportive of a change in SLAC s
policy. To protect the freedom of re
searchers, and to protect SLAC and
SSRL from the strain of weapons re
search, we will struggle to detend the
integrity of our University."
lames said, "The basic idea of pro
test marches is to voice opposition.
The fact that you do it makes it a
success."
