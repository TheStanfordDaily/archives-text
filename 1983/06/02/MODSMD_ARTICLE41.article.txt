# Sophomore given one year of eligibility
## Gompert regains amateur status as netter 
### MARK ZIEGLER 
Kate Gompert, a 1982 Ail-American on Stan
ford's NCAA championship tennis team, has re
gained her amateur tennis status in an unpre
cedented decision by the NCAA.
Gompert, who turned pro last summer, told
the Daily Tuesday night that she plans to use her
remaining year of college eligibility' next season.
The NCAA, in making Gompert its first tennis
player to be granted collegiate eligibility after
turning pro, took away two years of her eligibil
ity, leaving her with just one.
Gompert, the national juniors champion two
years ago, played in a number of pro tourna
ments before tearing cartilege and developing a
cyst in her left knee at the end of the summer.
Followingthe U.S. Open, she stopped playing
the pro circuit, had a knee operation, returned
to Stanford and requested the NCAA give back
her amateur status. And after nearly nine
months of deliberation, the NCAA and the USTA
(United States Tennis Association) ruled in
Gompert's favor.
"I didn't know what to think (during the deci
sion process)," she said, "because from every
different side I was getting different opinions.
But I'm looking forward to playing with the team
next year. I probably made too hasty a decision
to turn pro."

A graduate of Atherton's Menlo-Atherton
High School, Gompert said her knee is no
longer giving her problems on the court. "I'm
playing every day and I'm not having any pain
with it.
"I think laying off (from tennis) as much as I
did was really good for me," she said. "I think
I've lost a lot of my bad habits and I have a new
outlook now."
No one is probably happier about Compert's
reinstatement as an amateur than Cardinal wo
men's tennis coach Frank Brennan.
"She's an excellent tennis player," Brennan
said. "She has tremendous speed on the court.
She really gets to everything. It's like playing a
backboard."
Gompert, along with a fine mix of returning
veterans and incoming freshmen, should give
Stanford the inside track to the NCAA title next
year.
Stanford's top three singles players — junior
Elise Burgin, sophomore Linda Gates and
freshman Aylce Werdel — are all back. Burgin
was rated as the nation's top player for most of
the year while Gates was ranked 11th in the
pre-NCAA championships poll.
