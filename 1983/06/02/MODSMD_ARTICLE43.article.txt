## Ruggers prepare for Australian tour 
### LIBBY LEONARD 
Unless a player is seriously injured,
rugby games have no time outs. Nor does
Stanford's rugby season.
The men's rugby club had its final
league match two months ago, but the
team is not ready to stop playing.
While the seniors are graduating on
June 12, Stanford's ruggers will leave the
Farm and begin a tour of Australia.
The club's members raised an impress
ive $38,000 this year by hosting tourna
ments, selling raffle tickets and soliciting
alumni donations to finance their trip.
New uniforms, athletic bags, and sweat
suits were also given to the team by com
pany sponsors.
Why did the group decide to visit Au
stralia?
"Some of the best rugby in the world is
played there," explained junior Morgan
Morgan. "We feel we can learn from the
Australians, bring that back with us and
fuse it into the club."
Captain Dave Andrews agreed that the
summer experience will improve the
team. "We had had a frustrating season.
We're hoping the tour will be the extra
push we need to beat Cal and go the
National Championship next year," An
drews remarked.
Although the Card did not qualify for
the Nationals this year, it finished with a

respectable 16-6 record and two tourna
ment wins.
Next year looks promising for the
young Cardinal squad. Twenty-five
players are traveling "down under" and
21 will be returning to Stanford in the fall.
Since rugby is the number one sport in
Australia, the level of competition is
superior to that found in the United
States.
"We've asked the clubs over there to
pair us up with sides that are comparable
to us." noted Morgan. "We're not play
ing the best teams by any means."
Vet Morgan said his club will be no
pushover. "We've been working hard
and we have a lot of incentive. We should
do okay," he commented.
During the ruggers' 12-day stay in Au
stralia, they will play four games. The
team expects to receive much more at
tention than it is accustomed to.
"We will play in front of crowds ranging
from 2000 to 20,000 people," said An
drews. "We're even going to be tele
vised."
According to Morgan, Australians "are
very social and extremely friendly." Spe
cial activities have been scheduled to
honor the Card wherever it goes. In
C.impy, a small country town, the mayor
is holding a civic presentation and parade
for the Cardinal ruggers.
Several Australian rugby players and
their families will billet or house the Stan
ford students. Not only does this rugby
custom alleviate hotel expenses, it also
allows close interaction of different cul
tures.

"The most unique aspect of rugby is
the feeling of camaraderie between the
players," noted Andrews. "That's one
reason the opposition traditionally hosts
a party after each match," he added.
Few people realize that rugby is one of
the oldest sports at Stanford. It has been
played on the Farm since 1906. Andrews
said that rugby even replaced football as
the Big Game sport for five years in the
early 1900s. Rugby originally held varsity
status but became a club sport in 1975 due
to budget cuts and the enactment of Title
IX.
Present and past players are proud of

Stanford's long-standing success in
rugby. "We had won more National
Championships (nine) than any other
varsity sport until 1975," Andrews said.
Because rugby is such a tradition at Stan
ford, " alumni are willing to support us,"
he continued.
"If we develop ourselves as a finan
cially solvent organization through
alumni, we could regain varsity status,"
explained Andrews.
The rugby team, however, seems to
like operating as a club sport. "We're not
sure we want to go varsity," remarked
Andrews. "It would take away some of

our independence and freedom to make
decisions."
In addition, the popular practice of hav
ing parties after games might be in
jeopardy if rugby becomes a varsity sport.
"The athletic department probably
wouldn't allow (parties) because of the
beer," Andrews said.
After playing rugby in Australia, the
club plans to spend four days in Tahiti
before returning home.
"We're just going to Tahiti for some
rest and relaxation," said Morgan.
Apparently the rugby season does have
a time out after all.
