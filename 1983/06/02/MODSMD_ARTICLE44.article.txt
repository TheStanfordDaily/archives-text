The wome./s soccer team, which re
cently gaine< \,ar>itv status, claimed sec
ond place in its own invitiational tourna
ment last weekend.
Sunday's championship game looked
to be a repeat of last year. The Cardinal
had to win the 1982 title in a shootout
because the score was tied after regula
tion play. This year, however, Saratoga
sneaked in a controversial goal against
Stanford in the closing minutes of the
final to break the 0-0 tie and take home
the crown.
Stanford coach Tony Igwe said the offi
cials "had something to do with the loss."
According to Igwe, Saratoga's winning
goal should have been disqualified be
cause the Spirits were offsides.
In first round action, Mill Valley shut
out the Card 1-0. Stanford bounced back
on Saturday to beat Arizona 3-0 and
Western Washington 4-1. To earn a
championship birth, the Card defeated
the Palo Alto Selects 3-1 in the semifinals.
