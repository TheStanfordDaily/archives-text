## Campus a great monument... but with flaws 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff writer 
The campus' grand design is
an extraordinary and original
concept," but the follow-up
work leaves a little to be de
sired, according to Allan
Temko, the art editor and ar
chitecture critic for the San
Francisco Chronicle.
"Stanford's campus is a mas
terpiece in large scale educa
tional architecture . . . espe
cially the Palm Drive approach.
The overall impression is tre
mendously rich and complex,'
Temko said. Despite his op
timistic outlook, Temko said
that Stanford's "simple
minded" attempt to provide
architectural continuity has
been a failure.
Temko, currently a visiting
professor in the Art Depart
ment, is a scholar and jour
nalist as well as a teacher.
Temko has taught at UC-
Berkeley, and has lectured at
many college campuses here
and abroad. In addition to writ
ing several books, and his
weekly column for the Chroni
cle, Temko's writings have ap
peared in several major maga
zines, newspapers and a r -

hiti'ctural journals.
Stanford, according to
,"emko, is beautiful but it has
its faults, faults which some
times seem a parody.
Temko cited Meyer Library
as a prime example of a "trendy
parodv of original campus ar
chitecture. 'Meyer is a real
calamity. . . a caricature of the
historical architecture. With its
spindly columns, and con
gealed mustard-colored con
crete, it has none of the
robustness of the old build
ings," he said.
Temko also sees the Busi
ness School as a similar "exer
cise in parody," and says he
hopes that the "spirit of satire"
will be erased from the campus
in the future.
According to Temko, the
majority ot the engineering
buildings on campus are
examples ot poor architecture.
"-Mthough the buildings have
gotten larger and more expen
sive they have not gotten bet
ter," he said. "They are au
thentic dogs . . . they are cum
bersome, pompous and
heavy-handed."
In particular Temko said the
Physics Tank's cheap concept

and execution was a dis
grace.'' Conversely, he said
that Terman is one of the few
"decent engineering build
ings on campus. It is light and
elegant by comparison,' he
said.
Temko touted the Law
School as a near miss" ar
chitecturally. "The interiors
look cheap but aren t. Unfor
tunately the building has no
idea of the clarity, balance or
lucidity of the law."
With little praise tor the
Medical School, Temko joked
that it was like "a new version
of the Taj .Mahal by Mussolini."
Similarly Temko is disap
pointed with the new dorms at
Governor's Corner. I like the
village idea,' he said, "but they
got the orange color wrong."
Temko also expressed nega
tive sentiments concerning the
new clock tower. "I hate to
sound like an ingrate, but it
wasn't expensive enough. The
stucco looks cheap across from
the grand masonry of the
Quad. It is not well-aligned and
is hidden by trees." Temko
joked that such a covering
might be a blessing, and said
that the clock tower "belongs
in some shopping center."
In general Temko said that
Stanford's landscaping is not
worthy of the spendor of its
site. He considers the remodel
ing of the Oval to be "vulgar,"
and feels that Stanford has
"ruined the hills" with its in
dustrial park. "Highway 280
would have been unnecessary
if Stanford's industrial park
hadn't occurred in the hills,"
he said. Although Temko rec
ognizes the importance be
tween Stanford and high-tech
industry, he hopes that no
more industrial land will be
opened there in the future.
Paradoxically, Temko's favo
rite piece of campus architec
ture is a technological object.
"The most beautiful piece of
architecture on campus is the
radio telescope. It is a real
monument to the 20th century,
unlike something like Hoover
Tower," he said.
Praise was also given for the
"elegant mood" of the Stan
ford Museum, and for the vari
ous objectr of sculpture on
campus. "Elsen is turning the
campus into a sculpture gar
den," he said. "Although not
every piece is top level, no
program at any other university
is equal to Elsen's." Temko's
favorite piece of sculpture is
Mozart I."The idea of art in the
midst of life is a nice thing," he
said.
Perhaps Temko is so critical
of campus architecture be
cause of his high ideal that,
"Stanford should be as flawless
as possible." However, Temko
jokes that for some "Stanford
is paradise," and concluded
that, "if the whole world
should be as bad as Stanford,
we'd have a good environ
ment."

they have not necessarily gotten better. The critic said he

original Quad more closely in the future.

site. He considers the remodel
ing of the Oval to be "vulgar,"
and feels that Stanford has
"ruined the hills" with its in
dustrial park. "Highway 280
would have been unnecessary
if Stanford's industrial park
hadn't occurred in the hills,"
he said. Although Temko rec
ognizes the importance be
tween Stanford and high-tech
industry, he hopes that no
more industrial land will be
opened there in the future.
Paradoxically, Temko's favo
rite piece of campus architec
ture is a technological object.
"The most beautiful piece of
architecture on campus is the
radio telescope. It is a real
monument to the 20th century,
unlike something like Hoover
Tower," he said.
Praise was also given for the
"elegant mood" of the Stan
ford Museum, and for the vari
ous objectr of sculpture on
campus. "Elsen is turning the
campus into a sculpture gar
den," he said. "Although not
every piece is top level, no
program at any other university
is equal to Elsen's." Temko's
favorite piece of sculpture is
Mozart I."The idea of art in the
midst of life is a nice thing," he
said.
Perhaps Temko is so critical
of campus architecture be
cause of his high ideal that,
"Stanford should be as flawless
as possible." However, Temko
jokes that for some "Stanford
is paradise," and concluded
that, "if the whole world
should be as bad as Stanford,
we'd have a good environ
ment."

(bottom) a "trendy parody." According to Temko, the build
ings on campus have gotten bigger and more expensive but
they have not necessarily gotten better. The critic said he
hopes the University will follow the majestic style of the
original Quad more closely in the future.


THE RATING GAME: Architecture critic Alan Temko says he
loves Stanford's look, but with reservations. Though Mozart II

The campus' grand design is
an extraordinary and original
concept," but the follow-up
work leaves a little to be de
sired, according to Allan
Temko, the art editor and ar
chitecture critic for the San
Francisco Chronicle.
"Stanford's campus is a mas
terpiece in large scale educa
tional architecture . . . espe
cially the Palm Drive approach.
The overall impression is tre
mendously rich and complex,'
Temko said. Despite his op
timistic outlook, Temko said
that Stanford's "simple
minded" attempt to provide
architectural continuity has
been a failure.
Temko, currently a visiting
professor in the Art Depart
ment, is a scholar and jour
nalist as well as a teacher.
Temko has taught at UC-
Berkeley, and has lectured at
many college campuses here
and abroad. In addition to writ
ing several books, and his
weekly column for the Chroni
cle, Temko's writings have ap
peared in several major maga
zines, newspapers and a r -

hiti'ctural journals.
Stanford, according to
,"emko, is beautiful but it has
its faults, faults which some
times seem a parody.
Temko cited Meyer Library
as a prime example of a "trendy
parodv of original campus ar
chitecture. 'Meyer is a real
calamity. . . a caricature of the
historical architecture. With its
spindly columns, and con
gealed mustard-colored con
crete, it has none of the
robustness of the old build
ings," he said.
Temko also sees the Busi
ness School as a similar "exer
cise in parody," and says he
hopes that the "spirit of satire"
will be erased from the campus
in the future.
According to Temko, the
majority ot the engineering
buildings on campus are
examples ot poor architecture.
"-Mthough the buildings have
gotten larger and more expen
sive they have not gotten bet
ter," he said. "They are au
thentic dogs . . . they are cum
bersome, pompous and
heavy-handed."
In particular Temko said the
Physics Tank's cheap concept

and execution was a dis
grace.'' Conversely, he said
that Terman is one of the few
"decent engineering build
ings on campus. It is light and
elegant by comparison,' he
said.
Temko touted the Law
School as a near miss" ar
chitecturally. "The interiors
look cheap but aren t. Unfor
tunately the building has no
idea of the clarity, balance or
lucidity of the law."
With little praise tor the
Medical School, Temko joked
that it was like "a new version
of the Taj .Mahal by Mussolini."
Similarly Temko is disap
pointed with the new dorms at
Governor's Corner. I like the
village idea,' he said, "but they
got the orange color wrong."
Temko also expressed nega
tive sentiments concerning the
new clock tower. "I hate to
sound like an ingrate, but it
wasn't expensive enough. The
stucco looks cheap across from
the grand masonry of the
Quad. It is not well-aligned and
is hidden by trees." Temko
joked that such a covering
might be a blessing, and said
that the clock tower "belongs
in some shopping center."
In general Temko said that
Stanford's landscaping is not
worthy of the spendor of its
site. He considers the remodel
ing of the Oval to be "vulgar,"
and feels that Stanford has
