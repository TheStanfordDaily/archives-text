# Nazi diaries and other documents in Hoover Library
## 
### RANDY BROBERG Staff writer 
Hitler's diaries aren't in Hoover Library, but
Himmler's are.
The original and authentic diaries of both
Heinrich Himmler, the head of Hitler's secret
police (SS) and the concentration camps, ind
Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda chief, are
to be found in the stacks and storerooms o f
Hoover Tower.
The Tower and adjoining buildings contain
many prized and unique documents. Bes d< j s
the Nazi diaries, some of the documents that
have attracted most attention are the
Papers." These files belonged to the p-e
-communist-revolution, Russian Czarist secret
police. They contain, among other things, pho
tographs of the revolutionary, Leon Trotsky.
The archives section of the Hoover Institu
tion, administratively distinct from the Tower's
library, contains Ronald Reagan's gubernatorial
papers, as well as the papers of former con
gressmen Pete McCloskey and former senator
S.I. Hayakawa.
In contrast to the Cecil Green library, the
Hoover collections are more intensive on the
political, economic, and military history of
Europe, the Far East, Africa, Russia and Eastern
Europe, according to David Heron, head of
readers' services at the Hoover Libraries.
Courses and Degrees describes the Hoover
libraries as a "special collection dealing with the
causes and consequences of World War I . . .
The library includes one of the larges art hives in
the United States.
"Holdings include government documents,
files of newspapers and serials, manuscripts,
memoirs, diaries and personal papers of men
ana women important in world affairs, publica
tions of ephemeral societies and of resistance
and underground movements, and the publica
tions and records of national and international
bodies . . . many of them rare and irreplace
able."
David Hero claims that although, according to
official counts, there are 1.3 million volumes in
the Hoover libraries, there is actually 1.5 million
volumes if uncatalogued resources are tallied.
Forty percent of the collection is in foreign lan
guages.
The library has a "splendid collection" on the
economic, political and social history of th< -Oth
century, Heron said. "The strongest collections
are the Russian and East European, East Asian
and West European collections. Two other
smaller but good regional collections are the
African and the Latin American collections,"
Heron continued.
Stanford students and faculty may borrow
non-fragile volumes from the collection, hut
non-Stanford scholars may use the collection
but may not borrow. The stacks are "closed

except to a few "grandfather types" such as
Emeritus History Profs. Gordon Craig, Wayne
Vucinich and Gordon Wright, according to He
ron.
Heron estimated that five Stanford scholars
use the library tor every four non-Stanford re
searchers About one-third of the Stanford re
searchers are undergraduate students and the
remainder are graduate students and faculty.
Vucinich, the director of the Center for Rus
sian and East European Studies, referred to the
collection at Hoover as being "unique and one
of the world's best."
Vucinich went on to comment on the Hoover
collection's ability to attract scholars to Stan
ford: "Because of the invaluable collection
many students elect Stanford for graduate work
The tragedy has been that there is i dearth of
graduate-student scholarships and conse
quently the library collections are not utilized to
the fullest."
The tower itself has 14 floors, "a couple of
which" are the offices of Hoover Institution Di
rector W. Glenn Campbell and those of the of
fice of personnel, Heron said. There is also a
floor for the carillon which Prof, lames Angel
plays The rest of the tower consists of stacks,
which according to Heron are "pretty tull "
Although the library was founded ir< 1919, and
the tirst major shipments of documents was in
1921, the tower was not dedicated until 1941.
Before the library was located in the tower, it
was placed in the old Main I ibrary now the
Green Library.
One of the most important of the collections,
the East Asian collection, outgrew the space in
the tower and was moved to the Lou Henry
Hoover building in 1967 where it is now.
Most of the people with assigned spaces in
the tower are visiting scholars here specifically
to use the library, but they are not supported by
the Hoover Institution except for the use of of
fice space and access to the collections.
According to George Marotta, the public af
fairs coordinator of the Hoover Institution, the
Library and Archives was the reason Solzhenit
syn came here in 1975. Marotta also pointed out
that Barbara Tuchman used the library to write
The Guns of August and William Schreiber used
it to write The Third Reich. George Kennan also
comes to Stanford periodically to use the li
brary, according to Marotta.

guages.
The library has a "splendid collection" on the
economic, political and social history of th< -Oth
century, Heron said. "The strongest collections
are the Russian and East European, East Asian
and West European collections. Two other
smaller but good regional collections are the
African and the Latin American collections,"
Heron continued.
Stanford students and faculty may borrow
non-fragile volumes from the collection, hut
non-Stanford scholars may use the collection
but may not borrow. The stacks are "closed

except to a few "grandfather types" such as
Emeritus History Profs. Gordon Craig, Wayne
Vucinich and Gordon Wright, according to He
ron.
Heron estimated that five Stanford scholars
use the library tor every four non-Stanford re
searchers About one-third of the Stanford re
searchers are undergraduate students and the
remainder are graduate students and faculty.
Vucinich, the director of the Center for Rus
sian and East European Studies, referred to the
collection at Hoover as being "unique and one
of the world's best."
Vucinich went on to comment on the Hoover
collection's ability to attract scholars to Stan
ford: "Because of the invaluable collection
many students elect Stanford for graduate work
The tragedy has been that there is i dearth of
graduate-student scholarships and conse
quently the library collections are not utilized to
the fullest."
The tower itself has 14 floors, "a couple of
which" are the offices of Hoover Institution Di

was placed in the old Main I ibrary now the
Green Library.
One of the most important of the collections,
the East Asian collection, outgrew the space in
the tower and was moved to the Lou Henry
Hoover building in 1967 where it is now.

the tower are visiting scholars here specifically
to use the library, but they are not supported by

that Barbara Tuchman used the library to write

in 1921.
Hitler's diaries aren't in Hoover Library, but
Himmler's are.
The original and authentic diaries of both
Heinrich Himmler, the head of Hitler's secret
police (SS) and the concentration camps, ind
Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda chief, are
to be found in the stacks and storerooms o f
Hoover Tower.
The Tower and adjoining buildings contain
many prized and unique documents. Bes d< j s
the Nazi diaries, some of the documents that
have attracted most attention are the
Papers." These files belonged to the p-e
-communist-revolution, Russian Czarist secret
police. They contain, among other things, pho
tographs of the revolutionary, Leon Trotsky.
The archives section of the Hoover Institu
tion, administratively distinct from the Tower's
library, contains Ronald Reagan's gubernatorial
papers, as well as the papers of former con
gressmen Pete McCloskey and former senator
S.I. Hayakawa.
In contrast to the Cecil Green library, the
Hoover collections are more intensive on the
political, economic, and military history of
Europe, the Far East, Africa, Russia and Eastern
Europe, according to David Heron, head of
readers' services at the Hoover Libraries.
Courses and Degrees describes the Hoover
libraries as a "special collection dealing with the
causes and consequences of World War I . . .
The library includes one of the larges art hives in
the United States.
"Holdings include government documents,
files of newspapers and serials, manuscripts,
memoirs, diaries and personal papers of men
ana women important in world affairs, publica
tions of ephemeral societies and of resistance
and underground movements, and the publica
tions and records of national and international
bodies . . . many of them rare and irreplace
able."
David Hero claims that although, according to
official counts, there are 1.3 million volumes in
the Hoover libraries, there is actually 1.5 million
volumes if uncatalogued resources are tallied.
Forty percent of the collection is in foreign lan
guages.
