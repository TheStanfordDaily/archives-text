# Exploring the new world of individual theater

It's Called Walkman theater.
The cast list is brief â€” in fact,
the only actor on stage is you,
and you also double as a per
formance's sole audience
member.
Confused? "Living Room"
was the latest production of
The Company, and if you went
to see it expecting to sit back
and relax, you were surely sur
prised.
Equipped with Walkmans,
individual audience members
listened to the play on a tape
while walking through a maze
like set of 18 different rooms.
The audience member did ev
erything he or she heard the
main character of the play
doing and also heard every
thing the character said and
thought.
"One of the points of this
style of play is to encourage
audience members to think
about how environment af
fects the way we behave," said
Tony Kelly, a Stanford junior
majoring in American Studies,
and also script writer and set
designer for "Living Room."

"What I've done is to write a
fairly straightforward script,
take non-conventional tech
niques and build a set that to
tally surrounds you so that you
think, 'This is the place that I
am in,"' he explained.
Kelly adapted the Walkman
theater style of presentation
from "Artery," a play he saw
this spring directed by Chris
Hardman, a pioneer in the un
usual and as yet uncommon
genre.
"I loved the style of presen
tation in Artery," Kelly said,
"but I didn't like its script. I
thought it was real gimmicky,
like a 3-D movie trying to prove
what it could do to someone in
a controlled environment."
Kelly said he wanted to make
the play's plot and set to work
together, rather than put style
ahead of show. To this end, he
worked simultaneously on the
play's script and set since
March to prepare for the May
22 opening night.
"I wanted more plot to "Liv
ing Room" than a series of im
ages," he said. "I wanted to
use the rooms to help tell the
story."

The plot involves a thwarted
romance and murder mystery.
Although Kelly had been active
in theater long before "Living
Room," it is his first experience
as a writer.
Decidedly, he said, he kept
the script simple and unpre
tentious.
"I don't think of "Living
Room" as an experimental play
because it has such a
straightforward story," Kelly
said. "Everyone should under
stand the plot, if not the pre
sentation The story's just told
in a different way."
Some funding for "Living
Room" came from The Com
pany, but financing primarily
was through outside groups
such as the Stanford Engineer
ing Association, SCIRE, Resi
dential Education, Roble Hall
and personal loans.
Kelly expected "Living
Room" to just break even in
profits, he said.
So far, responses to Living
Room" have been positive, he
added.
"People overall seem to have
a pretty good time," Kelly said.
"Most people don't find the set

too contusing, although
there's been at least one per
son each night who has taken
the wrong exit. I'm fairly happy
with the play."
The play is not meant to be
esoteric or inaccessible to its
audience although it does pose
some probing questions which
he calls "throw-away state
ments," Kelly said.
An individual audience
member can appreciate "Liv
ing Room' on different levels of
understanding, kelly said.
"What I like about the show
is that if a person doesn't want
an idea to sink in or doesn't
want to ponder something, he
or she can still move on and
have a good time," he stres
sed. "But if someone wants to
think about a theme, then he
or she can. I like to think the
show stands up to whatever
happens with the audience
member."
Although Kelly said "Living
Room" includes many themes,
he explained that the main
theme of the presentation style
is to encourage people to think
more about how their envi
ronment affects them.

The major theme of the story
is dual: bad luck and a charac
ter study.
"It's about how chance
events can gain significance
because of what a character in
vests in a relationship or situa
tion," Kelly said.
"Living Room," which ran
through Sunday at the Elliott
Program Center in Governor's
Corner, probably is the most
recent example of Walkman
theater anywhere.
It's and example of a genre
that just might someday be
come widespread, especially
as more people hear about ex
perimental theater, Keily said.
"In a Peninsula Times
Tribune review, I was called a
disciple of Chris Hardman,"
Kelly added. "I thought that
was kind of funny, especially
since I've never even met Har
man. Steve Cassal, the re
viewer, is a big fan of the idea
of Walkman theater. I think he
wanted more pirates-of-the
caribbean in my show, he
wanted more gimmicks.
"I disagree. I wanted more of
a play than presented in Ar
tery."
