# Service award honors students
## 
### TINA MARIE BOSKIN 
The Dean's Award for Service
is given annually to 15 to 20
graduate and undergraduate
students. It was established
last year to provide an avenue
for institutional recognition of
the many contributions that
students make to the Stanford
community. For 1982-83, the
award for outstanding service
to the University and to its stu
dents was given to Gary Allen,
Forrest Ames, Andy Beal, De
borah Chen, Megan Chestnut,
Robin Cooper, Chris
Eberspacher, Mary Haynes,
Sharon Padilla, Doug Perkins,
Magdelena Rosales, Shelley
Saunders and Ruth Williams.
Nadine O'Leary, a secretary
in the office of the Dean of
Students, said candidates for
the award are nominated by
either faculty or members of
the student body. The reci
pients are then chosen by the
Dean of Student Affairs. The
dean and his assistants look for
diversity in the candidates and
try to award for a broad range
of services. Candidates must
be registered and be in good
academic standing. The pro
gram is "extremely successful.
Everyone is very cooperative
and the response has been
quite positive," O'Leary said.
This year's candidates were
diverse. Allen, a graduate stu
dent in Aeronautics and As
tronautics, was honored for
transforming the Stanford Stu
dent Branch of the American
Institute of Aeronautics and
Astronautics (AIAA) from a
small and rather inactive stu
dent club to one of the most
lively AIAA chapters in the
country. Brian Cantwell, as
sociate professor of Aeronau
tics and Astronautics, ex
plained, "That it was because
of Gary's leadership ability and
energy in making Stanford a
better place to be," that he
nominated Allen.
Ames, a graduate student in
Mechanical Engineering was
awarded for his work in energy
conservation, projected to
save the University $300,000
annually.
Beal, an undergraduate stu
dent in Economics, was hon
ored for his leadership of the
Inter-Fraternity Council, for his
achievements as an educator
and for his efforts to remove
real and imagined barriers be
tween the fraternities and
other student communities.
Beal has worked for the IFC for
four years. Jim Cadena, who
nominated Beal, "found it a
thrill to work with him. Andy
worked with an intense pas
sion and qualities of maturity
that are rarely seen until much
later in life. He was concerned
and worked hard at fixing the
problems he found evolving
between fraternities and the
community. Andy used the IFC
as a vehicle to exchange what
people think about the system
and he was very successful."
Asked how he felt about the
award process, Cadena said he

thought it an excellent idt
"Normally what Andy ac
complished would be largely
unsung — no one would hear
about it. Andy worked a lot of
hard hours and took on a lot of
responsibility. If there was no
service award there wouldn't
be any opportunity for him or
anyone else to be recognized
by the community for the
hours they volunteer. The way
in which the certificates are
written up is a wonderful
example of how the University
cares for its students. The
plaque brings up Andy's subtle
qualities and expresses the es
sence of what he did. I think
the award is a beautiful way to
say thank-you for what Andy
and others have done for the
Stanford community."
Chen, an undergraduate stu
dent in Mechanical Engineer
ing, was awarded for effec
tively applying her technical
skills to social needs for solar
energy, improved computer
instruction in local schools and
mechanical devices to aid the
locomotion of disabled chil
dren.
Chestnut, an undergraduate
student in Psychology, was
awarded for presenting a
model of community and cam
pus service — Cowell nursing
assistant, volunteer at the
Peninsula Children's Center,
swimming instructor at the
Community Association forthe
Retarded and student coun
selor for Miramonte Mental
Health Organization.
When asked what quality it
was that encourged her to
nominate Chestnut, Caroline
Wellbery said, "Megan is a real
giver. She's always busy — in
volved in the community, of
fering her services to people
less fortunate than herself."
"I love working with people
so my interests took me off
campus a lot," Chestnut said.
"Doing social volunteer work I
got a good perspective on life. I
realized there were people out
there who needed help. I was
honored and surprised that I
was being recognized for
something I would have done
anyway."
Wellbery said she considers
the Dean's Award for Service
an excellent idea. "There are
so many students who volun
teer their time beyond the call
of academic duty and so often
there are just academic
awards. The Dean's Award
reaches more people than an
academic award would, say a
Rhodes Scholarship which is
given to only 37 people in the
country. I think this award has
many positive benefits."
Cooper, Carrie Griffin,
Nancy Kass, Nancy Showen
and Jim Steyer were honored
for effectively combining their
many and different talents in
service to the goals of the Rape
Education Project.
Cooper also stressed "the
importance of getting in
volved, of not being passive.
Apply things you learn in class

outside the classroom. By
doing so you'll learn more
about yourself and your skills,
you'll meet faculty, staff and
help a lot of people, it is very
rewarding."
Eberspacher, a graduate stu
dent in Applied Physics, was
honored for his instrumental
role in designing and teaching
Applied Physics 010, a new un
dergraduate course in science
and technology.
When asked what inspired
him to devote so much of his
time toward undergraduate
studies, Eberspacher replied,
"I'm extremely interested in
the relation of energy to the
rest of the world and I think
that it's important for people to
realize how much science in
fluences our daily lives. For
example, when you deposit a
check at the bank a little late,
that check can be quickly pro
cessed so your checks don't
bounce but that same com
puter that takes care of your
checks can, under different
circumstances, be used to
monitor your life. As society
becomes more technologically
influenced it's imperative that
people become aware of sci
ence and its innumerable pos
sibilities. It is a part of your life
whether you choose to admit it
or not and people should be
effectively taught to make in
telligent choices in regards to
what they want."
Haynes, an undergraduate in
Communication, was recog
nized for an undergraduate
career characterized by hard
work, good cheer and leader
ship in the Black Student Men
tal Health Advisory Commit
tee, the Black Media Institute
and Black Student Union, and
as a theme associate in Ujamaa.
"I was very happy to be rec
ognized by the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs for my time and
commitment to the black
community," she said. "I hope
that when the award is given
next year that the Third World
community will continue to be
recognized."
A graduate student in Educa
tion, Padilla was honored for
her unusual talent as an or
ganizer and group leader and
her dedication to the devel
opment of high quality co
curricular programs such as El
Centro, Chicano Orientation
and OSA Leadership Training.
"I think it's great that people
as well as the University are
aware of the work that's being
done," Padilla said. "Part of the
educational process, I think, is
not simply taking classes.
There's more to it than that. To
be true to the idea of education
is to take part in extra
curricular activities — you're
just cheating yourself if you
don't get involved."
Perkins, an undergraduate in
Biological Sciences, was hon
ored for his many achieve
ments as captain of the wrestl
ing team, for time freely given
to his teammates, to children

on the nursery school playg
round, to youngsters at Sierra
Camp and to University stu
dents new to the scene of col
lege athletics.
Rosales, a graduate in Educa
tion, was honored for five
years of service to the campus
community in almost every
available role and activity.
Most recently she has been an
R.A. in Casa Zapata, been in
volved in world hunger prob
lems, traveled to Central
America and observed
different approaches to na
tional development.
Casa Zapata R.F. Arturo
Pacheco, the person who
nominated Rosales, said that,
"Magdalena has been a stu
dent who, since her freshman
year here, has been extremely
active in the community. She
has given a lot. I find it very
appropriate for the University
to recognize students who ex
cell in communal ways. It's im
portant for that kind of service
to be recognized."
Saunders, an undergraduate
in Economics and Sociology,
was awarded for her ability to
assume whatever role is most
needed — leader, manager,
group member, facilitator,
communicator, coordinator.
"I was very surprised to re
ceive an award," Saunders
said. "You know they call you
into the Dean's Office all secre
tive, I thought I was in trouble!
I would have liked to do more
with the theme house
(Ujamaa). I've been involved
with cultural diversity for four
years and the theme house still
doesn't serve ethnic meals. I
hope this will be changed in
the future. I would advise
people to get involved and
make the time. It helps you
grow and it helps the commu
nity become a better place."
A graduate student in Math
ematics, Williams was recog
nized for her many quarters of
hard work as a Teaching Fellow
in the Mathematics Depart
ment and for organizing the
highly successful 1982-83 lec
ture series for WISE, Women in
Science and Engineering. "If
you believe in something you
find ways to organize your time
and get it done," Williams said.
"In many graduate depart
ments like Physics or Mechan
ical Engineerng, for example,
there are few women faculty
members and few women stu
dents. This means that any
women who are in these de
partments can become ex
tremely isolated. I felt there
was a need for women to get
together from different de
partments and discuss their
work in an academic setting. I
organized the WISE lectures
and they were very successful.
I'm happy thatthey will be con
tinued again next year. Stan
ford is very conducive to creat
ing new programs. There is a
continual influx of new ideas
here."

members and few women stu
dents. This means that any
women who are in these de
partments can become ex
tremely isolated. I felt there
was a need for women to get
together from different de
partments and discuss their
work in an academic setting. I
organized the WISE lectures
and they were very successful.
I'm happy thatthey will be con
tinued again next year. Stan
ford is very conducive to creat
ing new programs. There is a
continual influx of new ideas
here."
The Dean's Award for Service
is given annually to 15 to 20
graduate and undergraduate
students. It was established
last year to provide an avenue
for institutional recognition of
the many contributions that
students make to the Stanford
community. For 1982-83, the
award for outstanding service
to the University and to its stu
dents was given to Gary Allen,
Forrest Ames, Andy Beal, De
borah Chen, Megan Chestnut,
Robin Cooper, Chris
Eberspacher, Mary Haynes,
Sharon Padilla, Doug Perkins,
Magdelena Rosales, Shelley
Saunders and Ruth Williams.
Nadine O'Leary, a secretary
in the office of the Dean of
Students, said candidates for
the award are nominated by
either faculty or members of
the student body. The reci
pients are then chosen by the
Dean of Student Affairs. The
dean and his assistants look for
diversity in the candidates and
try to award for a broad range
of services. Candidates must
be registered and be in good
academic standing. The pro
gram is "extremely successful.
Everyone is very cooperative
and the response has been
quite positive," O'Leary said.
This year's candidates were
diverse. Allen, a graduate stu
dent in Aeronautics and As
tronautics, was honored for
transforming the Stanford Stu
dent Branch of the American
Institute of Aeronautics and
Astronautics (AIAA) from a
small and rather inactive stu
dent club to one of the most
lively AIAA chapters in the
country. Brian Cantwell, as
sociate professor of Aeronau
tics and Astronautics, ex
plained, "That it was because
of Gary's leadership ability and
energy in making Stanford a
better place to be," that he
nominated Allen.
Ames, a graduate student in
Mechanical Engineering was
awarded for his work in energy
conservation, projected to
save the University $300,000
annually.
Beal, an undergraduate stu
dent in Economics, was hon
ored for his leadership of the
Inter-Fraternity Council, for his
achievements as an educator
and for his efforts to remove
real and imagined barriers be
tween the fraternities and
other student communities.
Beal has worked for the IFC for
four years. Jim Cadena, who
nominated Beal, "found it a
thrill to work with him. Andy
worked with an intense pas
sion and qualities of maturity
that are rarely seen until much
later in life. He was concerned
and worked hard at fixing the
problems he found evolving
between fraternities and the
community. Andy used the IFC
as a vehicle to exchange what
people think about the system
and he was very successful."
Asked how he felt about the
award process, Cadena said he

thought it an excellent idt
"Normally what Andy ac
complished would be largely
unsung — no one would hear
about it. Andy worked a lot of
hard hours and took on a lot of
responsibility. If there was no
service award there wouldn't
be any opportunity for him or
anyone else to be recognized
by the community for the
hours they volunteer. The way
in which the certificates are
written up is a wonderful
example of how the University
cares for its students. The
plaque brings up Andy's subtle
qualities and expresses the es
sence of what he did. I think
the award is a beautiful way to
say thank-you for what Andy
and others have done for the
Stanford community."
Chen, an undergraduate stu
dent in Mechanical Engineer
ing, was awarded for effec
tively applying her technical
skills to social needs for solar
energy, improved computer
instruction in local schools and
mechanical devices to aid the
locomotion of disabled chil
dren.
Chestnut, an undergraduate
student in Psychology, was
awarded for presenting a
model of community and cam
pus service — Cowell nursing
assistant, volunteer at the
Peninsula Children's Center,
swimming instructor at the
Community Association forthe
Retarded and student coun
selor for Miramonte Mental
Health Organization.
When asked what quality it
was that encourged her to
nominate Chestnut, Caroline
Wellbery said, "Megan is a real
giver. She's always busy — in
volved in the community, of
fering her services to people
less fortunate than herself."
"I love working with people
so my interests took me off
campus a lot," Chestnut said.
"Doing social volunteer work I
got a good perspective on life. I
realized there were people out
there who needed help. I was
honored and surprised that I
was being recognized for
something I would have done
anyway."
Wellbery said she considers
the Dean's Award for Service
an excellent idea. "There are
so many students who volun
teer their time beyond the call
of academic duty and so often
there are just academic
awards. The Dean's Award
reaches more people than an
academic award would, say a
Rhodes Scholarship which is
given to only 37 people in the
country. I think this award has
many positive benefits."
Cooper, Carrie Griffin,
Nancy Kass, Nancy Showen
and Jim Steyer were honored
for effectively combining their
many and different talents in
service to the goals of the Rape
Education Project.
Cooper also stressed "the
importance of getting in
volved, of not being passive.
Apply things you learn in class

outside the classroom. By
doing so you'll learn more
about yourself and your skills,
you'll meet faculty, staff and
help a lot of people, it is very
rewarding."
Eberspacher, a graduate stu
dent in Applied Physics, was
honored for his instrumental
role in designing and teaching
Applied Physics 010, a new un
dergraduate course in science
and technology.
When asked what inspired
him to devote so much of his
time toward undergraduate
studies, Eberspacher replied,
"I'm extremely interested in
the relation of energy to the
rest of the world and I think
that it's important for people to
realize how much science in
fluences our daily lives. For
example, when you deposit a
check at the bank a little late,
that check can be quickly pro
cessed so your checks don't
bounce but that same com
puter that takes care of your
checks can, under different
circumstances, be used to
monitor your life. As society
becomes more technologically
influenced it's imperative that
people become aware of sci
ence and its innumerable pos
sibilities. It is a part of your life
whether you choose to admit it
or not and people should be
effectively taught to make in
telligent choices in regards to
what they want."
Haynes, an undergraduate in
Communication, was recog
nized for an undergraduate
career characterized by hard
work, good cheer and leader
ship in the Black Student Men
tal Health Advisory Commit
tee, the Black Media Institute
and Black Student Union, and
as a theme associate in Ujamaa.
"I was very happy to be rec
ognized by the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs for my time and
commitment to the black
community," she said. "I hope
that when the award is given
next year that the Third World
community will continue to be
recognized."
A graduate student in Educa
tion, Padilla was honored for
her unusual talent as an or
ganizer and group leader and
her dedication to the devel
opment of high quality co
curricular programs such as El
Centro, Chicano Orientation
and OSA Leadership Training.
"I think it's great that people
as well as the University are
aware of the work that's being
done," Padilla said. "Part of the
educational process, I think, is
not simply taking classes.
There's more to it than that. To
be true to the idea of education
is to take part in extra
curricular activities — you're
just cheating yourself if you
don't get involved."
Perkins, an undergraduate in
Biological Sciences, was hon
ored for his many achieve
ments as captain of the wrestl
ing team, for time freely given
to his teammates, to children

on the nursery school playg
round, to youngsters at Sierra
Camp and to University stu
dents new to the scene of col
lege athletics.
Rosales, a graduate in Educa
tion, was honored for five
years of service to the campus
community in almost every
available role and activity.
Most recently she has been an
R.A. in Casa Zapata, been in
volved in world hunger prob
lems, traveled to Central
America and observed
different approaches to na
tional development.
Casa Zapata R.F. Arturo
Pacheco, the person who
nominated Rosales, said that,
"Magdalena has been a stu
dent who, since her freshman
year here, has been extremely
active in the community. She
has given a lot. I find it very
appropriate for the University
to recognize students who ex
cell in communal ways. It's im
portant for that kind of service
to be recognized."
Saunders, an undergraduate
in Economics and Sociology,
was awarded for her ability to
assume whatever role is most
needed — leader, manager,
group member, facilitator,
communicator, coordinator.
"I was very surprised to re
ceive an award," Saunders
said. "You know they call you
into the Dean's Office all secre
tive, I thought I was in trouble!
I would have liked to do more
with the theme house
(Ujamaa). I've been involved
with cultural diversity for four
years and the theme house still
doesn't serve ethnic meals. I
hope this will be changed in
the future. I would advise
people to get involved and
make the time. It helps you
grow and it helps the commu
nity become a better place."
A graduate student in Math
ematics, Williams was recog
nized for her many quarters of
hard work as a Teaching Fellow
in the Mathematics Depart
ment and for organizing the
highly successful 1982-83 lec
ture series for WISE, Women in
Science and Engineering. "If
you believe in something you
find ways to organize your time
and get it done," Williams said.
"In many graduate depart
ments like Physics or Mechan
ical Engineerng, for example,
there are few women faculty
members and few women stu
dents. This means that any
women who are in these de

A graduate student in Math
ematics, Williams was recog
nized for her many quarters of
hard work as a Teaching Fellow
in the Mathematics Depart
ment and for organizing the
highly successful 1982-83 lec
ture series for WISE, Women in
Science and Engineering. "If
you believe in something you
find ways to organize your time
and get it done," Williams said.
"In many graduate depart
ments like Physics or Mechan
ical Engineerng, for example,
there are few women faculty
members and few women stu
dents. This means that any
women who are in these de
partments can become ex
tremely isolated. I felt there
was a need for women to get
together from different de
partments and discuss their
work in an academic setting. I
organized the WISE lectures
and they were very successful.
I'm happy thatthey will be con
tinued again next year. Stan
ford is very conducive to creat
ing new programs. There is a
continual influx of new ideas
here."
The Dean's Award for Service
is given annually to 15 to 20
graduate and undergraduate
students. It was established
last year to provide an avenue
for institutional recognition of
the many contributions that
students make to the Stanford
community. For 1982-83, the
award for outstanding service
to the University and to its stu
dents was given to Gary Allen,
Forrest Ames, Andy Beal, De
borah Chen, Megan Chestnut,
Robin Cooper, Chris
Eberspacher, Mary Haynes,
Sharon Padilla, Doug Perkins,
Magdelena Rosales, Shelley
Saunders and Ruth Williams.
Nadine O'Leary, a secretary
in the office of the Dean of
Students, said candidates for
the award are nominated by
either faculty or members of
the student body. The reci
pients are then chosen by the
Dean of Student Affairs. The
dean and his assistants look for
diversity in the candidates and
try to award for a broad range
of services. Candidates must
be registered and be in good
academic standing. The pro
gram is "extremely successful.
Everyone is very cooperative
and the response has been
quite positive," O'Leary said.
This year's candidates were
diverse. Allen, a graduate stu
dent in Aeronautics and As
tronautics, was honored for
transforming the Stanford Stu
dent Branch of the American
Institute of Aeronautics and
Astronautics (AIAA) from a
small and rather inactive stu
dent club to one of the most
lively AIAA chapters in the
country. Brian Cantwell, as
sociate professor of Aeronau
tics and Astronautics, ex
plained, "That it was because
of Gary's leadership ability and
energy in making Stanford a
better place to be," that he
nominated Allen.
Ames, a graduate student in
Mechanical Engineering was
awarded for his work in energy
conservation, projected to
save the University $300,000
annually.
Beal, an undergraduate stu
dent in Economics, was hon
ored for his leadership of the
Inter-Fraternity Council, for his
achievements as an educator
and for his efforts to remove
real and imagined barriers be
tween the fraternities and
other student communities.
Beal has worked for the IFC for
four years. Jim Cadena, who
nominated Beal, "found it a
thrill to work with him. Andy
worked with an intense pas
sion and qualities of maturity
that are rarely seen until much
later in life. He was concerned
and worked hard at fixing the
problems he found evolving
between fraternities and the
community. Andy used the IFC
as a vehicle to exchange what
people think about the system
and he was very successful."
Asked how he felt about the
award process, Cadena said he

thought it an excellent idt
"Normally what Andy ac
complished would be largely
unsung — no one would hear
about it. Andy worked a lot of
hard hours and took on a lot of
responsibility. If there was no
service award there wouldn't
be any opportunity for him or
anyone else to be recognized
by the community for the
hours they volunteer. The way
in which the certificates are
written up is a wonderful
example of how the University
cares for its students. The
plaque brings up Andy's subtle
qualities and expresses the es
sence of what he did. I think
the award is a beautiful way to
say thank-you for what Andy
and others have done for the
Stanford community."
Chen, an undergraduate stu
dent in Mechanical Engineer
ing, was awarded for effec
tively applying her technical
skills to social needs for solar
energy, improved computer
instruction in local schools and
mechanical devices to aid the
locomotion of disabled chil
dren.
Chestnut, an undergraduate
student in Psychology, was
awarded for presenting a
model of community and cam
pus service — Cowell nursing
assistant, volunteer at the
Peninsula Children's Center,
swimming instructor at the
Community Association forthe
Retarded and student coun
selor for Miramonte Mental
Health Organization.
When asked what quality it
was that encourged her to
nominate Chestnut, Caroline
Wellbery said, "Megan is a real
giver. She's always busy — in
volved in the community, of
fering her services to people
less fortunate than herself."
"I love working with people
so my interests took me off
campus a lot," Chestnut said.
"Doing social volunteer work I
got a good perspective on life. I
realized there were people out
there who needed help. I was
honored and surprised that I
was being recognized for
something I would have done
anyway."
Wellbery said she considers
the Dean's Award for Service
an excellent idea. "There are
so many students who volun
teer their time beyond the call
of academic duty and so often
there are just academic
awards. The Dean's Award
reaches more people than an
academic award would, say a
Rhodes Scholarship which is
given to only 37 people in the
country. I think this award has
many positive benefits."
Cooper, Carrie Griffin,
Nancy Kass, Nancy Showen
and Jim Steyer were honored
for effectively combining their
many and different talents in
service to the goals of the Rape
Education Project.
Cooper also stressed "the
importance of getting in
volved, of not being passive.
Apply things you learn in class

outside the classroom. By
doing so you'll learn more
about yourself and your skills,
you'll meet faculty, staff and
help a lot of people, it is very
rewarding."
Eberspacher, a graduate stu
dent in Applied Physics, was
honored for his instrumental
role in designing and teaching
Applied Physics 010, a new un
dergraduate course in science
and technology.
When asked what inspired
him to devote so much of his
time toward undergraduate
studies, Eberspacher replied,
"I'm extremely interested in
the relation of energy to the
rest of the world and I think
that it's important for people to
realize how much science in
fluences our daily lives. For
example, when you deposit a
check at the bank a little late,
that check can be quickly pro
cessed so your checks don't
bounce but that same com
puter that takes care of your
checks can, under different
circumstances, be used to
monitor your life. As society
becomes more technologically
influenced it's imperative that
people become aware of sci
ence and its innumerable pos
sibilities. It is a part of your life
whether you choose to admit it
or not and people should be
effectively taught to make in
telligent choices in regards to
what they want."
Haynes, an undergraduate in
Communication, was recog
nized for an undergraduate
career characterized by hard
work, good cheer and leader
ship in the Black Student Men
tal Health Advisory Commit
tee, the Black Media Institute
and Black Student Union, and
as a theme associate in Ujamaa.
"I was very happy to be rec
ognized by the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs for my time and
commitment to the black
community," she said. "I hope
that when the award is given
next year that the Third World
community will continue to be
recognized."
A graduate student in Educa
tion, Padilla was honored for
her unusual talent as an or
ganizer and group leader and
her dedication to the devel
opment of high quality co
curricular programs such as El
Centro, Chicano Orientation
and OSA Leadership Training.
"I think it's great that people
as well as the University are
aware of the work that's being
done," Padilla said. "Part of the
educational process, I think, is
not simply taking classes.
There's more to it than that. To
be true to the idea of education
is to take part in extra
curricular activities — you're
just cheating yourself if you
don't get involved."
Perkins, an undergraduate in
Biological Sciences, was hon
ored for his many achieve
ments as captain of the wrestl
ing team, for time freely given
to his teammates, to children

on the nursery school playg
round, to youngsters at Sierra
Camp and to University stu
dents new to the scene of col
lege athletics.
Rosales, a graduate in Educa
tion, was honored for five
years of service to the campus
community in almost every
available role and activity.
Most recently she has been an
R.A. in Casa Zapata, been in
volved in world hunger prob
lems, traveled to Central
America and observed
different approaches to na
tional development.
Casa Zapata R.F. Arturo
Pacheco, the person who
nominated Rosales, said that,
"Magdalena has been a stu
dent who, since her freshman
year here, has been extremely
active in the community. She
has given a lot. I find it very
appropriate for the University
to recognize students who ex
cell in communal ways. It's im
portant for that kind of service
to be recognized."
Saunders, an undergraduate
in Economics and Sociology,
was awarded for her ability to
assume whatever role is most
needed — leader, manager,
group member, facilitator,
communicator, coordinator.
"I was very surprised to re
ceive an award," Saunders
said. "You know they call you
into the Dean's Office all secre
tive, I thought I was in trouble!
I would have liked to do more
with the theme house
(Ujamaa). I've been involved
with cultural diversity for four
years and the theme house still
doesn't serve ethnic meals. I
hope this will be changed in
the future. I would advise
people to get involved and
make the time. It helps you
grow and it helps the commu
nity become a better place."
