# Mausoleum marks graves
## 
### ANDREA OLIVAS 
On the Stanford campus stand two grave
markers which are not generally recognized
as such. They are the Stanford family
mausoleum and the statue, "Angel of
Grief."
In the late 19th century, it was customary
for prominent members of eastern society to
prepare for death well in advance. They did
so by having mausoleums built on their es
tates. In his travels across the country,
Senator Leland Stanford undoubtedly saw
some of these mausoleums and commis
sioned an architectto design the final resting
place for Stanford, his wife Jane, and his son
Leland, who had died in 1884.
The Stanford mausoleum was built on the
10 acres originally set aside for a new home
for the Stanfords, but the actual acreage is
only about four acres. At the time it was
built, it stood about half-way between the
University grounds and the original Stanford
home.
The mausoleum was to be crafted from a
combination of gray granite and the finest
white Carrara marble from Italy. The
mausoleum, is in the form of a Greek temple
and is approximately 25 feet square.
The Stanford's names are inscribed at the
top of the front of the temple.
The entrance to the mausoleum is pro
tected by a brass gate at the outside and
immediately behind the gate are heavy gra
nite doors. When the Stanfords were still
alive, the granite doors were fitted with an
alarm. Once the doors were closed, they
could not be opened without the alarm
sounding in the family residence.
Prior to the erection of the tomb, Leland

Stanford Junior died in Florence, Italy and
was entombed in a smaller mausoleum for
nine years before his remains were brought
to the Stanford mausoleum in 1893.
The mausoleum remained empty until
1893 when Leland Stanford died. The funeral
services were held under the large arch of
Memorial Court — Memorial Church had
not yet been constructed — and the men
that bore his casket to the mausoleum were
the eight oldest locomotive engineers on
the Southern Pacific Railroad (Senator Stan
ford was one of Big Four who founded the
major western railroads), and 150 employees
of The Farm lined the road as the family left
the residence, and later lined the road to the
mausoleum.
The body of the Stanford's son was later
quietly removed to the mausoleum. When
Jane Stanford died in 1905 in Hawaii, services
were held for her in the recently completed
Memorial Church. Her pallbearers were
Stanford students.
"The Angel of Grief is a statue which marks
the grave of Jane Stanford's brother Henry
Lathrop. The base of the pedestal that the
statue rests on is hollow and contains the
urn of ashes of Lathrop. In 1901, Mrs. Stan
ford erected the statue after her brother
died, she used some of the money that he
had left her. Her intent was to erect a statue
that would do honor to his memory as well
as express her feelings for him.
The statue that protects the remains of
Lathrop is not, the only one that has stood y
there. The first copy that Mrs. Stanford had
made was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake
and not replaced until 1908.
