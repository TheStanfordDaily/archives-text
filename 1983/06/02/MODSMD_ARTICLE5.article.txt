# University contracts grounds work to illegal aliens

### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Nearly 40 illegal aliens ranging in age from 16
to 20 are working nine hours a day, seven days
a week — a violation of University policy —
readying the campus for commencement )une
12, the Daily has learned.
The aliens, most of whom work in this coun
try tosupport families in Mexico, told theDaily
through an interpreter that they are employed
by Menlo Park rancher Stanley Webb, who has
contracted with the University to provide
"temporary" labor for the past four years.
More than 15 of Webb's employees inter
viewed by the Daily said they and their co
workers reside here illegally.
Bill Massy, University vice-president for
business and finance, said University policy
prohibits the hiring of foreign nationals not in
possession of valid permits. However, he said
that under the contract with Webb, the legal
status of the workers is "Webb's responsibil
ity."

lames Horgan, director of Operations and
Maintenance, said the University would dis
continue its relationship with Webb if it is
found that he is "consciously hiring illegal
aliens. But to my knowledge he's not. That's
why we deal with Webb, because he's rea
sonably up front.
"I don't check green cards. I have no idea
that there is an illegal alien on this campus," he
said.
"Webb has available people and we hire
those people through him," said University
Grounds Manager Herbert Fong. "We don't
have to fool with any benefits or paperwork
and it's easy to hire and easy to fire."
According to David llchert, regional director
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
"There's no federal statute pertaining to the
employment of illegal aliens."
He said there is no penalty for the employer
of an illegal alien, even if he knows an indi

vidual is not residing in this country legally
when he is hired. However, he said an em
ployer who employs illegals might violate
tax and safety laws by doing so.
Joe Brandon, an investigator for the Immi
gration and Naturalization Service (INS), said
the INS has never searched Webb Ranch for
illegal aliens. "This isn't anything unusual," he
said. "There are thousands of employers in the
Bay Area which employ illegal aliens."
Horgan said it was "no secret that Webb
would be hiring Mexican nationals." But he
said he believed they were here illegally.
"Webb is monitored by the state," he said.
"Certainly, the state of California knows about
him. We take that as assurance that they (the
workers) are all within the rules and regula
tions."
Webb could not be reached for comment.


EXTRA HELP: Some of the workers
sprucing up (he campus for graduation
may be illegal aliens. Although employ
ing illegal aliens is not against the law, it
seems to conflict with University pol
icy.
