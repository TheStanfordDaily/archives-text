# University contracts grounds work to illegal aliens
## 
### ALAN TRIPP Senior staff writer 
Nearly 40 illegal aliens ranging in age from 16
to 20 are working nine hours a day, seven days
a week — a violation of University policy —
readying the campus for commencement )une
12, the Daily has learned.
The aliens, most of whom work in this coun
try tosupport families in Mexico, told theDaily
through an interpreter that they are employed
by Menlo Park rancher Stanley Webb, who has
contracted with the University to provide
"temporary" labor for the past four years.
More than 15 of Webb's employees inter
viewed by the Daily said they and their co
workers reside here illegally.
Bill Massy, University vice-president for
business and finance, said University policy
prohibits the hiring of foreign nationals not in
possession of valid permits. However, he said
that under the contract with Webb, the legal
status of the workers is "Webb's responsibil
ity."

lames Horgan, director of Operations and
Maintenance, said the University would dis
continue its relationship with Webb if it is
found that he is "consciously hiring illegal
aliens. But to my knowledge he's not. That's
why we deal with Webb, because he's rea
sonably up front.
"I don't check green cards. I have no idea
that there is an illegal alien on this campus," he
said.
"Webb has available people and we hire
those people through him," said University
Grounds Manager Herbert Fong. "We don't
have to fool with any benefits or paperwork
and it's easy to hire and easy to fire."
According to David llchert, regional director
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
"There's no federal statute pertaining to the
employment of illegal aliens."
He said there is no penalty for the employer
of an illegal alien, even if he knows an indi

vidual is not residing in this country legally
when he is hired. However, he said an em
ployer who employs illegals might violate
tax and safety laws by doing so.
Joe Brandon, an investigator for the Immi
gration and Naturalization Service (INS), said
the INS has never searched Webb Ranch for
illegal aliens. "This isn't anything unusual," he
said. "There are thousands of employers in the
Bay Area which employ illegal aliens."
Horgan said it was "no secret that Webb
would be hiring Mexican nationals." But he
said he believed they were here illegally.
"Webb is monitored by the state," he said.
"Certainly, the state of California knows about
him. We take that as assurance that they (the
workers) are all within the rules and regula
tions."
Webb could not be reached for comment.


EXTRA HELP: Some of the workers
sprucing up (he campus for graduation
may be illegal aliens. Although employ
ing illegal aliens is not against the law, it
seems to conflict with University pol
icy.
The workers agreed to be inter
viewed only on the condition that
their real names not be used.
"My biggest concern is having a
job," said one worker, who admitted
to living here illegally. He said he
sends his earnings to a wife and two
children in Mexico. "Times are really
hard back home. I miss my family but
I have no choice."
Although his hourly wage is $3.35,
the legal minimum in California, this
20-year-old worker said his monthly
paycheck amounts to far less be
cause of deductions for Social Secu
rity, pension, liability insurance and
other charges, from which he will not
benefit
Another worker, who also admit
ted to being in this country illegally,
corroborated what the first had said.
"We're aware that he's (Webb) tak
ing the money (the paycheck deduc
tions) from us but what can we do —
he's giving us a job. He treats us fairly
well and it's better than back home."
The worker said it took him two
days and nights travelinp alone with
out food or water through the brush
to get to the United States. Now, he
is "very afraid of being picked up."
He said the $600-$7OO monthly
paycheck in return for working from

7 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day of the week
was "not enough for the work we
do."
A third worker, who has been in
California illegally for about a year,
said the workers were not required
to work every day. "We are making a
lot of money here, compared to
Mexico," he said. "Most of us work
as much as we can — if not at the
University, then back at the ranch
(the Webb Ranch in Menlo Park)
picking strawberries and doing other
work."
He said he sends "all of my check
except what I need to eat" back to his
parents in Mexico. Although no indi
vidual worker would admit to being a
minor, some of the workers inter
viewed said several members of their
group of 40 were 16 or 17 years old.
The workers, who spoke little or
no English, said that although they
feared losing their jobs and deporta
tion as a result of talking to the Daily,
the risk was worth it in order to make
the University community aware of
their situation.
University Labor Counsel Priscilla
Wheeler said, "I have not heard any
reports that there illegal aliens em
ployed on or about the University."
She had no further comment.
Horgan said the laborers some
times work under Webb's supervi
sion and sometimes under the
supervision of University personnel.

One of the illegal workers said he
has worked "all year" maintaining
University facilities under the direc
tion of University personnel.
Another alien said most of the
workers employed by Webb live
four-to-a-room at quarters on the
Webb ranch. He said the workers'
paychecks were docked for rent,
utilities and other expenses. Some of
the workers who work primarily on
campus live "near the school (Stan
ford)," he said.
He also said he fears deportation.
"The worst thing that could happen
to me is that I could lose my job," he
said.
Michael Baratz, executive secre
tary of United Stanford Workers
(USW), said he had been told that the
workers employed by Webb might
be illegal but had never had it con
firmed. He said the University's prac
tice of employing workers temporar
ily was "something to hold over our
(USW members) heads. They pay for
the labor and it's delivered. What do
they care if those guys are slaves or
not.
"They pit workers against work
ers," he said. "That way their meas
ureof control is increased. You'd like
to hope that they would re-evaluate
their practices but I don't have that
much faith in this University and its
management. It's just a typical Stan
ford practice."
