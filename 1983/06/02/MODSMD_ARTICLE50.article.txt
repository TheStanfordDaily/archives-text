[ Not all University classes are held here,
por are they held in a traditional setting.
Several weeks ago 16 students from Prof.
Philip Zimbardo's Psychology of Mind Con
trol class participated in an experimental
■ ' workshop on power at Pigeon Point Light
house near Pescadero Beach in Santa Clara
County.
Director Gregory White of the Palo Alto
Veteran's Administration Hospital said that
i' the workshop was formed "as a way of expe
rientially learning what kinds of dilemmas
grow up around power that might be related
i', to the group dynamics and interpersonal in
fluence processes in cults.
"The Power Laboratory starts by dividing
students up into three classes by a flip of the
'• coin — the Elites, Middles and Lowers,"
White said. "These different classes are
given different resources and privileges. For
example, the Elites get better accomoda
tions to start with. The first two-and-a-half
days of the laboratory are spent within this
minimal framework experiencing the strains
and opportunities that come with being a
member of the Elites, Middles or Lowers.
During the final day, staff and participants
collectively reconstruct the entire commu
nity experience and begin the task of at
tempting to understand the Laboratory's de
velopments from theoretical points of
view."
During the course of the experiment,
which was for White's research (not Zimbar
do's), students experienced and learned
about mind control in a totally artificial situa
tion silently monitored by eight "an
thropologists" (medical and mental health
experts). "The creation, use and abuse of
power is a very important element in the
development of 'mind control' exercised in
a variety of groups, including not only cult
groups but everyday organizations," said
. White, who had participated in Zimbardo's
prison experiment as a Stanford under
graduate.
Zimbardo said that "in some ways the
analogy to the prison experiment is a very
direct, meaningful one,"Jbut the Power Lab
was concerned with more sophisticated
techniques of influence. "Some people saw
analogies to the power of certain kinds of
dictators like Jim Jones in how leadership
evolved within the group," Zimbardo said.
Traditionally power laboratories have
been held for persons in different business
organizations in order to help them learn
how power works in industry. White's was
different in that it involved a potentially
cohesive group of students who, unlike
businessmen from different environments,
could have a series of past and future com
mitments. They were also sensitized to the
issues of mind control. The usual animosity
among the three power levels was less force

ful than it could have been in this case, and
on the second day the groups agreed to form
a collective, communist type of "coopera
tive" organization. After this, group distinc
tions remained in some people's minds and
interpersonal power tactics assumed fun
damental importance. Many members in the
group in fact noticed after the Power Lab that
one person's ideas and influence prevailed.
What was it like to be a Lower, Middle or
Elite? After the Power Lab the participants
presented their viewpoints to the class. The
Elites said that despite their expectations of
an easy life, they felt a great sense of respon
sibility and they felt guilty about imposing
distinctions. Having a consensus vote "ab
solved" them of some of their guilt, but as
Alvina O'Brien put it, "If you were a Lower
you could just revolt, but as an Elite there
was still a lot of responsibility." Another
Elite, Gil Ureno, said, "We knew we had to
keep these other groups busy, or else they
were going to be thinking about overthrow
ing us." Above all they felt hostilities emerg
ing "out of nowhere."
The Middles said they were a cohesive
group but did not want to be "crunched"
between the Elites and Lowers. They felt
powerless because the Elites and Lowers
were reluctant to stay in their positions.
Shannon Jones, a Middle, said, "Since we
were ready to play our roles and the other
folks did not seem to really want their roles a
whole lot, we ended up looking petty." They
felt a loss of autonomy because they had to
deal more with the frustrations of the Lowers
than the Elites did, yet they did not have the
authority to change the rules. When the col
lectivity did form, they still retained a strong
sense of group cohesiveness.
The Lowers said that originally they did
not know what to do. They did not want to
be adversaries of the Elites and Middles, but
immediately they were forced into negotia
tions as Lowers with fewer rights, so they felt
they had to react. But they said it felt good to
be rebellious, and it made them more cohe
sive. The Lowers also said that since things
"got so personal" a lot of intense emotional
involvement occurred. They felt that "play
ing power games" was an important part of
the experience, and once they had gotten
concessions from the Middles they wanted
to "beat up on the Elites." Some of them felt
the challenge was gone when the collectivity
formed, but others thought it was very in
teresting. Calvin Cobb, a Lower, said,
"When you really did away with the power
structure and the roles were abolished, then
the individuals' real unconstrained behavior
seemed to come out, and people who were
'naturally powerful' were able to be them
selves without actually playing a role."
The anthropologists were observed by
some of the students as having the real
power in the experiment. Bob Vallone, a

T.A. and a psychology grad student, said,
however, that "the Elites did not want to
own up to the extent to which they used the
staff as a subordinate group to enforce their
rules. What they said to the Middles and
Lowers is 'Hey, the system requires this. The
staff required that we make these distinc
tions, and you guys have to follow them.' In
that way they didn't have to be the bad guys,
and they were uncomfortable with the Mid
dles and Lowers making that observation."
In the collectivity there was a lot of frustra
tion over what to do with people who would
not comply, Vallone said. Voting by consen
sus led to many futile debates, and the re
peated indecision of the group led several
people either to leave or to compromise
their ideas and values as long as they could
decide on something to do.
What is the most important thing people
learned by participating?
"Although I was definitely totally sen
sitized to the issues of power in this class,
and I fought against having power myself or
letting anybody else use power over me,
there was power coming at me from direc
tions I didn't expect, and ail the tricks
worked," Jane Boneta said. "Knowledge
doesn't save. Even when I was totally ready
and totally primed for fighting it, it still hap
pened. I was really scared by that."
Calvin Cobb said, "Having a high degree
of emotional feeling, combined with an ap
peal to a widely shared value is almost ir
resistible (as a mind control technique) . . .
It reminded me of the tapes of Jim Jones we
listened to in class."
"In building this strength in the commu
nity that we were going for, (we told) any
individual who didn't want into that society
'you're out.' It's scary when you realize
we're that far away from the Nazis. The ends
weren't the same, but the means were al
most identical," said Joe Campbell.
"We exert and are used by power hun
dreds of times each day without even realiz
ing it, and by simply asking for a little bit
more each time a person could gain total
control," said Greg Grove. "It also became
clear to me that there is no such thing as a
powerless society — even within an 'egalita
rian' system certain natural leaders and nat
ural followers emerged."
Shannon Jones remarked about "the ease
with which I had deceived myself when my
attention was diverted. There was a point
where we had made the statement 'We need
somebody strong to rule us,' and then we
realized, my God, we already had someone
ruling us. That we had failed to recognize
that was a point of both fascination and fear
for me, because we had been oblivious to
this fact all along, and I realized I had fallen
into the 'not me' syndrome that we had dis
cussed in this class. 1 didn't think that I
would be following someone else's rules.

But it was important that this occurred when
my attention was diverted by being kept ac
tive or fragmented from others. When I had
time to sit down and reflect with others in
the same situation, the facts became clear to
me."
"People need and expect power," said Al
vina O'Brien. "People who are leaders and
people who can take power should go ahead
and do it. Egalitarianism and socialism don't
work. And I want leaders to take power. I'll
give them power."
Another student said he felt that even as
someone who had not visibly exerted a great
deal of influence he had in fact exhibited a
lot of power.
Ralph Latze said he was able to resist the
collective, and when he cJid not participate
he felt content, especially when he gained
support from others who didn't like what
was happening.
Another student said, "Power itself does
not exist — it is conferred. If you don't con
fer it you won't see it as much . . . It's only
something that you have in your mind that
gives power to someone else . . . Also I'm
glad that we all escaped."
David, perceived by many as a Jim Jones
type leader, said that he had read about
Power labs before this experience, and he
"didn't want to fall into the trap" of having
the same inter-group conflicts as the cases
he had read, so he attempted to move the
experiment in the other direction — that of
group harmony.
White said he felt students were seeking
security in using theory to describe the real
fears that they felt. There were, however,
several "mind control" techniques used by
the participants. The "door-in-the-face"
technique was used by the Lowers to gain
concessions from the Elites: they would ask
for the outrageous daily rotation of classes,
and after debating that and exhausting
everyone the Lowers were iri a better posi
tion to get the smaller concessions that they
really wanted. After the collective was
formed, David, who many perceived as its
leader, used such techniques as sitting in the
center of communication, moderating,
group identification, selective reinforce
ment of ideas through body language while
listening to others, appealing to others with
the common value of equality, saying "let's"
instead of "I think we should," and many
others that his fellow students noticed.
These were to a high degree unconscious,
according to Davis, but nevertheless they
scared him and his fellow students. One
thing all agreed upon afterwards was that
persuasion can be used for both good and
evil ends, and vigilance pays off because no
matter how much you know about mind
control, it is difficult to change situations
where it is used unless you really reflect on
what is happening.
