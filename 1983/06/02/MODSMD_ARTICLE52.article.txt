# McCloskey: from sports to Israel, he's outspoken
## PROFILE: 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
He holds office hours behind
first base at Sunken Diamond
and has a wife nearly half his
age.
Guest Prof. Paul "Pete" Mc-
Closkey, who spent the past 15
years as a Republican in the
House of Representatives, is
hardly a staid politician.
As a loyal Stanford alumnus
(Class of '50, J.D. '52) and sports
fan, he lobbied in Washington
for the University and attends
virtually every Stanford sport
ing event. "It's a real privilege
to go to Stanford," he said.
His tenure as a guest pro
fessor has been marred by con
troversy, however. He has
come under repeated attacks
for his outspoken views on Is
rael. And he has not responded
with silence.
Interviewed in the sunny
backyard of his small, un
pretentious Woodside home,
the graying 55-year-old
seemed at peace with his life
style and his loss to Pete Wilson
in the Republican Senate pri
mary last year. Wearing athletic
shorts and a T-shirt, and sip
ping a beer, the tough out
doorsman comfortably fielded
questions.
He gardens, fly-fishes,
watches sports on TV and gives
15 speeches a month.
He also runs in marathons
with his attractive, blonde 29-
year-old wife of nine months,
Helen Hooper. Reed-thin but
healthy and athletic, she could
easily pass fora student here. In
fact, she does — she has at
tended each of her husband's
20 class sessions. McCloskey
occasionally stopped speaking
to watch her garden —orto lis
ten to the Giants' game on TV
The daughter of a diplomat,
Hooper worked on Mc-
Closkey's congressional staff in
Washington. Her brother was
McCloskey's press assistant.
The Hoopers and the Mc-

Closkeys are long-time friends.
In fact, McCloskey now lives
next-door to his in-laws.
Hooper received her
bachelor's degree in environ
mental studies from UC-Santa
Cruz. This fall she will enter law
school at UC-Santa Clara,
where McCloskey will teach
the same undergraduate
course he is teaching here on
congressional decision-mak
ing. UC-Santa Clara is offering
five units for the course, which
was worth three here.
McCloskey works for the law
firm of Brobeck, Phleger and
Harrison in Palo Alto, mostly as
a trial lawyer for large Silicon
Valley companies. His first case
was to block the incorporation
of East Palo Alto, a cause which
he said he personally backs. "I
only take them (cases) if I be
lieve in them," he said.
McCloskey claims not to har
bor any future political aspira
tions. "I'm going to practice
law here for as long as I can. I
don't think I'll ever run for of
fice again," he said. "The temp
tation to challenge (President)
Reagan would be so great... I
wish some competent Re
publican would challenge
him."
He claims that losing the
Senate primary to Pete Wilson
was all for the best. "I haven't
had a moment's doubt or dis
may (about losing the prima
ry)," McCloskey said. As a
private citizen, he said, "I can
take on causes."
As proof of the fact that he
can do more as a private citizen
than he can in the Senate, he
said he gave 19 speeches in
April and 14 in May.
McCloskey comes from a
long line of native Californians
and Stanford graduates. His pa
rents were members of the
Class of '14, his sister was a
member of the Class of '40 and
his daughter was a member of
the Class of '81. He has four

children, aged 31, 30, 28and 26.
His wife is the perfect age, he
said, since she's younger than
two of his children and older
than two.
Hooper agreed that the age
difference poses no problem.
When people ask her what she
is going to do when she "grows
up," she replies, "Wheel him
around."
McCloskey particularly

praised University President
Donald Kennedy. "He could
be president of the United
States some day,"he said,
pointing out that Woodrow
Wilson was a "college presi
dent." He described heading
the Food and Drug Adminis
tration as "one of the toughest
administrative jobs."
His Stanford Law School
classmates included Supreme

Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, former Secretary of
Education Shirley Hufstedter
and Watergate figure John
Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman, who spoke in
McCloskey's class this quarter,
is a close friend. In fact, the two
law students were debate part
ners here some 35 years ago.
Watergate tested the friend
ship, however. "I made the first
big suggestion that they im
peach (then-President Rich
ard) Nixon," McCloskey said.
"It was kind of embarrassing."
Soon after graduating from
the Law School, McCloskey
founded a Palo Alto law firm —
McCloskey, Wilson and
Mosher — which dealt ex
clusively with environmental
lawsuits.
Despite his unquestioned
patriotism — he served two
years in the Marine Corps dur
ing the Korean War — Mc-
Closkey did not hesitate to
criticizeU.S. policy in Vietnam.
Nor does he hesitate to
criticize Reagan's foreign poli
cy. "I really worry that the Rea
gan administration is pursuing
a misguided course in foreign
policy . . . We ought to start
treating the Russians as human
beings."
Although he criticized Rea
gan's policy, he praised Shultz
as a "marvelous man."
But returningto hisseeming
ly favorite topic, he said,
"There's no way you can pub
licly debate what Israel is
doing."
McCloskey claims that
former Israeli Defense Minister

Ariel Sharon and Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin are
guilty of "war crimes."He
added, "At least 50 percent of
the Jewish community dis
agrees with what Begin's trying
to do."
"It isn't anti-Semitic to dis
agree with a Jewish student,"
he said. "They've been claim
inganti-Semitism for years with
anyone who disagreed with the
Jewish point of view."
McCloskey said he is "anti-
Zionist" rather than "anti-Jew
ish" or "anti-Israeli." The four
Jewish students in his class are
all anti-Zionist, he said.
"Zionism is the most danger
ous philosophy in the world to
day," he said. "Zionism has be
come a racist philosophy."
Some members of the com
munity, however, disagree
with McCloskey's belief that
Zionism is "racism."
As for his controversial
course on congressional de
cisionmaking, in which 41 stu
dents completed the mid-term
examination, McCloskey said
he wouldn't hesitate to teach it
here again.
McCloskey and third-year
law student Seth Linfield,
Guest Professorship Board
(GPB) director, have been wag
ing verbal battles during the
past three months. McCloskey
has claimed that Linfield has
tried to censor his course read
ings and "torpedo" his class.
McCloskey said of Linfield:
"I have nowaytoexplain him."
Linfield asked McCloskey to
remove readings which were
critical of Israel, McCloskey

said. Only three of the 20 les
sons involved Israel, Mc-
Closkey said. Linfield went to
only one of McCloskey's
classes (on the Yom Kippur
War).
McCloskey said Linfield told
him: "We're not about to de
bate you because you'd win
the debate." Linfield had al
leged that McCloskey's read
ings reflected his anti-Semitic
viewpoint.
The confrontational stance
of both McCloskey and Lin
field has made national head
lines. Provost Albert Hastorf
has asked that the Political Sci
ence Department conduct an
inquiry into possible violations
of academic freedom.
He was vice president of the
Phi Delta Theta fraternity —
where he gave a speech last Fri
day — and a member of the
baseball team hisfreshman and
sophomore years.
It was ironic, McCloskey
said, that a few of the senators
who voted to disassociate the
ASSU from the course were Phi
Delts, since in 1948 he had de
fended two Jewish pledges
who the national organization
wished to deny membership
because they were not
"Aryan."
McCloskey claims that while
he would teach here again,
others may be more wary, es
pecially if they fear their read
ing lists may be similarly
"censored." Reportedly the
CjPB is no longer considering
politicians; indeed, none of
next year's proposed guest
professors are political figures.
