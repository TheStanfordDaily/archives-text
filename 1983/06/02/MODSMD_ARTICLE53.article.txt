## San Bruno plan allows for butterfly, development interests 
### JOHN NEMCEK 
| San Bruno Mountain, sprawling westward from South
ban Francisco and Brisbane to Daly City and Coloma, is
the last large tract of open space remaining in private
ownership on the Peninsula. However, in March the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service granted a permit under
Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act thereby
giving the go-ahead for restricted private development
on the mountain.
The controversial issue surrounding the development
of this valuable piece of real estate has been the en
dangered species residing there. San Bruno Mountain is
an island amidst a sea of development on the peninsula
and is one of the last refuges for many species formerly
widespread in this area including the San Bruno Moun
tain Mission Blueand theCallippeSilverspot butterflies.
A habitat Conservation Plan has been developed by
Thomas Reid Associates, an environmental analysis and
consulting firm in Palo Alto. Once implemented, it will
protect from development nearly 80 percent of the
mountain and set it aside as scenic parkland in public
ownership.
The plan protects most of the critical habitats of these
two rare butterfly species. In the process, it also protects
the habitats of many other rare and threatened species
on the mountain such as the Tree Lupine Moth, the San
Francisco Garter Snake, the endangered San Bruno Elfin
butterfly and several rare plant species.
Considered by some to be "the wave of the future" in
resolving conflicts between the interests of endangered
species and those of private developers, the plan has
been coined an "environmental milestone" by some of
its proponents. Only about ten percent of the mountain
will be developed under the plan with eight percent as
yet unplanned. However, that eight percent eventually
must adhere to strict development limitations set up by
the plan. A small percentage of the mountain temporar
ily disturbed by development will be experimentally re
vegetated and returned to open space.
The plan also provides for annual funding of approxi
mately $60,000 per year, escalating with inflation, to
monitor and do research on the endangered butterflies.
Homeowners will be charged $20 per year and busi
nesses will provide $10 for each 1000 feet of commercial
space to support the plan.
Visitacion Associates, which owns most of the private
land on the mountain, is the major force behind the
recent development proposals. In 1975, they proposed a
plan to construct 8500 residential units and two million
square feet of office and commercial space on the
mountain. This plan was strongly protested but the San
Mateo County Board of Supervisors eventually agreed to
consider a plan for 2200 residential units if the level
"saddle" area of the mountain was left in open space. It
was thought by most that if the saddle area were pro
tected, the rest of the mountain would probably be
considered too steep to develop.

In the late '70s, Visitacion Associates donates and
sold large holdings on the mountain including most of
the ridge and the saddle area to San Mateo County and
the State of California. But they persisted in their bid to de
velop at least part of the mountain.
The endangered butterfly species was the strongest
argument used against development. Technically, the
Federal Endangered Species Act protected these but
terflies and their habitat from development The original
act, passed in 1973, prohibits the killing or injuring of any
licteH endangered species and a 1978 amendment gave

endangered species further protection by safeguarding
the critical habitats of these species. However, in 1982,
further amendments to the act provided for the "inci
dental taking" of endangered species under a section
10(a) permit. A permit may be granted, for example, if a
taking of endangered species serves scientific purposes
or enhances the propagation or survival of the affected
species. The permit application must be accompanied
by a conservation plan specifying impacts, mitigation
measures, and consideration of alternative plans. The
San Bruno Mountain habitat conservation plan was de

signed to satisfy these stipulati ns but not everyone
agrees as to how well «t did so. Some members of the
scientific community strongly supported the plan while
others regarded it as simplistic ' and poorly conceived.
Paul Ehrlich, Bing professor of population studies,
gave the habitat conservation plan his support. He
wrote, "It seems that the trade otf of a small fraction of
now suitable habitat for the permanent protection of the
remainder, and the habitat conservation plan's aclama
tion of now unsuitable habitat is the best plan among
realistic options."
Dr. Richard Arnold, an entomologist and research fel
low at U.C. Berkeley, disagrees. Arnold has studied the
butterfly populations on San Bruno Mountain for many
vears as part of his dissertation work, and said that the
taking of butterflies under the plan will be more than
"incidental."
Arnold pointed out that viable alternatives to the plan
suggested by him were not given appropriate considera
tion. One such alternative suggested a land trade of
publicly owned areas of the saddle (which is of poor
habitat quality for the endangered species) for areas
now proposed for development which are of much
higher habitat quality.
Craig Dremann, a California native plant seedsman and
proprietor ot the Redwood City Seed Company, labeled
the habitat conservation plan a "scam." He argued that
the seed necessary for revegetation of disturbed areas
was not available anywhere. Furthermore, he attacked
the "advancing brush'' theory proposed by Thomas Reid
Associates, which insists the European annual grasses
and shrubs were pushing out the native grass species
and lupines which are the primary food source for the
butterflies. Dremann maintained instead that the shrubs
actually shelter some of the butterfly host plants and
prevent the European annuals from crowding them out.
Although there is no consensus as to the merit of the
habitat conservation plan, it is already being called to set
a precedent for resolving other endangered species de
velopment conflicts. Ehrlich, however, strongly cau
tioned against the premature use of the approach
elsewhere. He wrote, "If the habitat swap does in fact
work on San Bruno Mountain it is only because the
endangered Mission Blue and its lupine host plants are
particularly successful in disturbed habitats." Continuing
on he warns, "We are considerably less sanguine about
similar proposals for most other buttertiy species, and
other plants and animals elsewhere."
The first development on San Bruno Mountain is
planned to begin in July. As the remaining land annexa
tions and grading permits are resolved, further devel
opments will be initiated next year. The total billion
dollar development scheme consisting of 3000 residen
tial units and 25 acres commercial land will be conducted
over more than a decade so as to phase in and out the
various habitat disturbances.

butterflies. Dremann maintained instead that the shrubs
actually shelter some of the butterfly host plants and
prevent the European annuals from crowding them out.
Although there is no consensus as to the merit of the
habitat conservation plan, it is already being called to set
a precedent for resolving other endangered species de
velopment conflicts. Ehrlich, however, strongly cau
tioned against the premature use of the approach
elsewhere. He wrote, "If the habitat swap does in fact
work on San Bruno Mountain it is only because the
endangered Mission Blue and its lupine host plants are
particularly successful in disturbed habitats." Continuing
on he warns, "We are considerably less sanguine about
similar proposals for most other buttertiy species, and
other plants and animals elsewhere."
The first development on San Bruno Mountain is
planned to begin in July. As the remaining land annexa
tions and grading permits are resolved, further devel
opments will be initiated next year. The total billion
dollar development scheme consisting of 3000 residen
tial units and 25 acres commercial land will be conducted
over more than a decade so as to phase in and out the
various habitat disturbances.

Blue butterfly, both
endangered
species, are the
prime benefactors
of a habitat conser
vation plan de
signed to enhance
their survival while
allowing for limited
development on
San Bruno Moun
tain.

| San Bruno Mountain, sprawling westward from South
ban Francisco and Brisbane to Daly City and Coloma, is
the last large tract of open space remaining in private
ownership on the Peninsula. However, in March the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service granted a permit under
Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act thereby
giving the go-ahead for restricted private development
on the mountain.
The controversial issue surrounding the development
of this valuable piece of real estate has been the en
dangered species residing there. San Bruno Mountain is
an island amidst a sea of development on the peninsula
and is one of the last refuges for many species formerly
widespread in this area including the San Bruno Moun
tain Mission Blueand theCallippeSilverspot butterflies.
A habitat Conservation Plan has been developed by
Thomas Reid Associates, an environmental analysis and
consulting firm in Palo Alto. Once implemented, it will
protect from development nearly 80 percent of the
mountain and set it aside as scenic parkland in public
ownership.
The plan protects most of the critical habitats of these
two rare butterfly species. In the process, it also protects
the habitats of many other rare and threatened species
on the mountain such as the Tree Lupine Moth, the San
Francisco Garter Snake, the endangered San Bruno Elfin
butterfly and several rare plant species.
Considered by some to be "the wave of the future" in
resolving conflicts between the interests of endangered
species and those of private developers, the plan has
been coined an "environmental milestone" by some of
its proponents. Only about ten percent of the mountain
will be developed under the plan with eight percent as
yet unplanned. However, that eight percent eventually
must adhere to strict development limitations set up by
the plan. A small percentage of the mountain temporar
ily disturbed by development will be experimentally re
vegetated and returned to open space.
The plan also provides for annual funding of approxi
mately $60,000 per year, escalating with inflation, to
monitor and do research on the endangered butterflies.
Homeowners will be charged $20 per year and busi
nesses will provide $10 for each 1000 feet of commercial
space to support the plan.
Visitacion Associates, which owns most of the private
land on the mountain, is the major force behind the
recent development proposals. In 1975, they proposed a
plan to construct 8500 residential units and two million
square feet of office and commercial space on the
mountain. This plan was strongly protested but the San
Mateo County Board of Supervisors eventually agreed to
consider a plan for 2200 residential units if the level
"saddle" area of the mountain was left in open space. It
was thought by most that if the saddle area were pro
tected, the rest of the mountain would probably be
considered too steep to develop.

In the late '70s, Visitacion Associates donates and
sold large holdings on the mountain including most of
the ridge and the saddle area to San Mateo County and
the State of California. But they persisted in their bid to de
velop at least part of the mountain.
The endangered butterfly species was the strongest
argument used against development. Technically, the
Federal Endangered Species Act protected these but
terflies and their habitat from development The original
act, passed in 1973, prohibits the killing or injuring of any
licteH endangered species and a 1978 amendment gave

endangered species further protection by safeguarding
the critical habitats of these species. However, in 1982,
further amendments to the act provided for the "inci
dental taking" of endangered species under a section
10(a) permit. A permit may be granted, for example, if a
taking of endangered species serves scientific purposes
or enhances the propagation or survival of the affected
species. The permit application must be accompanied
by a conservation plan specifying impacts, mitigation
measures, and consideration of alternative plans. The
San Bruno Mountain habitat conservation plan was de

signed to satisfy these stipulati ns but not everyone
agrees as to how well «t did so. Some members of the
scientific community strongly supported the plan while
others regarded it as simplistic ' and poorly conceived.
Paul Ehrlich, Bing professor of population studies,
gave the habitat conservation plan his support. He
wrote, "It seems that the trade otf of a small fraction of
now suitable habitat for the permanent protection of the
remainder, and the habitat conservation plan's aclama
tion of now unsuitable habitat is the best plan among
realistic options."
Dr. Richard Arnold, an entomologist and research fel
low at U.C. Berkeley, disagrees. Arnold has studied the
butterfly populations on San Bruno Mountain for many
vears as part of his dissertation work, and said that the
taking of butterflies under the plan will be more than
"incidental."
Arnold pointed out that viable alternatives to the plan
suggested by him were not given appropriate considera
tion. One such alternative suggested a land trade of
publicly owned areas of the saddle (which is of poor
habitat quality for the endangered species) for areas
now proposed for development which are of much
higher habitat quality.
Craig Dremann, a California native plant seedsman and
proprietor ot the Redwood City Seed Company, labeled
the habitat conservation plan a "scam." He argued that
the seed necessary for revegetation of disturbed areas
was not available anywhere. Furthermore, he attacked
the "advancing brush'' theory proposed by Thomas Reid
Associates, which insists the European annual grasses
and shrubs were pushing out the native grass species
and lupines which are the primary food source for the
butterflies. Dremann maintained instead that the shrubs
actually shelter some of the butterfly host plants and
prevent the European annuals from crowding them out.
