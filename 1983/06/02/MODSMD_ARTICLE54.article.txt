# State extends tax credits for solar energy systems
## 
### FAY DUFFNER 
Despite objections that the state can't af
ford it, the California Senate approved a
proposal two weeks ago to extend the
generous 55 percent tax credits for installing
solar energy systems. Under current law,
homeowners, tenants and rental property
owners installing solar energy systems are
eligible for this state income tax credit.
The current state tax credits are scheduled
to expire next January 1. Gov. Deukmejian
has called for eliminating all solar tax credits
in his proposed budget for the fiscal year
beginning July 1. But State Senator Gary Hart
(D.-Santa Barabara) and other senators said
that the credits were necessary to subsidize
the solar industry and provide incentives to
save energy. Hart said the real cost to the
state would be less than $30 million next

year, atter sales and income taxes generated
by solar industries, and that there would
eventually be a net profit in state tax reve
nues.
A federal tax credit of 40 percent for the
first $10,000 spent on material and labor as
sociated with the purchase of a solar system
must be deducted from the state tax credit.
The federal credits, however, are only avail
able for taxpayers making investments in
their primary residence, so businesses and
rental property owners are only entitled to a
15 percent energy investment tax credit for
solar energy purchases.
In addition to the solar tax credit strate
gies, the Federal Government, under the
Carter Administration, initiated some im
portant solar energy policies and programs.
The Reagan Administration, however, has

proposed to cut many of these programs.
According to Denis Hayes, former director
of the Solar Energy Research Institute, solar
research at that institute has been slowed at
the mercy of massive funding cuts. The Res
idential Conservation Service is in danger of
elimination, and the Solar Bank has been
tabled indefinitely.
The weakening federal support of solar
energy means that the transition to solar en
ergy must be carried out by state and local
efforts. California, and the Santa Clara Valley
in particular, are prime examples of solar
successes independent of federal decisions.
According to the Santa Clara County Solar
Coalition (SCVSC), California, with only 10
percent of the nation's population, pre
sently has over 25 percent of the installed
solar systems. Solar businesses have gener

ated over $50 million for the California eco
nomy since 1980, and the California State
Energy Commission has set a goal to install
1.5 million solar systems and to generate an
industry that will employ over 20,000 per
sons by 1985.
The Santa Clara County General Plan es
tablished an ordinance in 1981 that requires
a solar hot water system on all new resi
dences. All new subdivisions must contain
solar access easements so that they can be
easily retrofitted for solar equipment. The
County is also considering various regula
tions dealing with wind generators and al
cohol plants.
Palo Alto has a comprehensive city plan to
encourage conservation and solar energy
use. Palo Alto Utility provides solar energy
audits to all customers. Solar energy heats
the Rinconada Swimming Pool, the munici

pal golf clubhouse, and the Alma Street Fire
Station. According to the SCVSC, the utility
gives a ten percent discount on electricity to
customers who use solar systems that supply
more that 50 percent of their water or space
heating needs. The Palo Alto Utility also of
fers low-interest and long-term loans for
solar installations. The city has an energy
library and a course on solar energy for
homeowners taught bv Civil Engineering
Prof. Gil Masters.
The neighboring communities of Moun
tain View and Menlo Park also have similar
solar policies dictated by their planning de
partments. Persons living in those com
munities can take advantage of a free Re
source Conservation Service audit and also
have the option of acquiring a low interest
loan and solar rebate from P.G.&E, in addi
tion to the state tax credits.
