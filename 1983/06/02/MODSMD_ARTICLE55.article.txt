And the whole ot the Farm begins to
quiver; the Dish twirls wildly; Hoover Tower
noses through the stratosphere â€” and Stan
ford University ascends into Outer Space.
Well, it may not happen quite like that, but
the Cardinal has entered the Space Race. You
probably know that Sally Ride, a Stanford
graduate, will be flying on the next space
shuttle in a few weeks.
What you mav not know is that here on
Earth, a team of Stanford engineers and sci
entists have been designing a space station
for the 19905.
The space platform project, called
Pleiades, is described by project managers as
"a system of co-ordinating platforms dedi
cated to science." Electrical Engineering
Profs. Peter Banks and Bruce Lusignan and
Aeronautics/Astronautics Profs. Jean Mayers
and )ohn Breakwell are advising develop
ment of this new space system.
So what makes this space project so un
ique?
Traditionally, there have been two ways of
conducting Space Science. One way is to
have a swarm of ' tree fliers": anti-social
spacecraft that are sent into orbit to "do their
own thing."
The other space mission approach is to put
all the experiments onto one gigantic megas
tation, bursting at the seams with dozens of
laboratories.
But the Stanford team rejected these "trad
itions," replacing them with a brand new

concept: the flotilla.

To envision how the flotilla works, just
look at what's been happening lately in Sili
con Valley. Instead of working toward the
huge macrocomputer, local developers have
moved toward the semi-independent
minicomputers.
lust so, the flotilla will consist of one cent
ral flagship, the coordinating platform, and
lots of little spacecraft, the "free flyers," mov
ing about the platform doing different exper
iments. A data relay satellite and service vehi
cle would be part of the fleet.
The flotilla idea has several advantages. For
one thing, different experiments tend to
quarrel like first-graders: a cosmic ray detec
tor, for example, gives out contamination
which would interfere with an infra-red tele
scope if they were both on a megastation. But
put them separately in a flotilla, and both can
function uninterrupted.
The flotilla will facilitate human travel into
space as well: just by docking manned craft
onto the flagship.
And if one spaceship should need extra
fuel, more computer time or data-swapping
and coordination with other ships, this can
be done from the flagship.
Finally, scientists back on Earth will be able
to "talk" to their experiments in real time,
something not yet achieved in spacecraft.
So why build a space station at all? Why not
do these experiments on Earth? Says Louis
Lerman, the grad student in charge of the
science aspect, "On Earth the atmosphere
and gravity get in the way of the science. We
have to step outside our cocoon to see the
universe around us."
Besides, the program managers point to
many earthly applications of work done on
space stations. In their Space Systems En
gineering manual, which provides a detailed
description of Pleiades, developers suggest
earth resources and weather researchers, as
well as material processors, will benefit from
technological and scientific advances a space
flotilla could make.
And why design it now? According to
Banks, "Ever since Apollo, American space
research has been dominated by the Shuttle.
Now is when at last we are looking ahead to
the 19905. Also, traditionally National
Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) planning has been dominated by en
gineers rather than scientists. Our project is
intended as science-oriented."
Fine. But is this project just an academic
dream? Is anybody at NASA listening? Ac
cording to Erwin Scmerling, discipline chief
at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C.,
its influence will be "quite a fair amount."
