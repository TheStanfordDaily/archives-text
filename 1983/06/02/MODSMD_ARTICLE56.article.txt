# Doctors seek narcolepsy remedy
## 
### JENNIFER SEYMOUR 
The average person spends a third ot
their life asleep. Despite this, the mecha
nisms which cause sleep, and particularly
the deep, dream-state ot sleep called
Rapid Eye Movement sleep (REM sleep),
remain basically unknown today. And REM
sleep abnormalities, such as narcolepsy,
remain equally unexplained and uncura
ble.
But researchers here are optimistic that
a newly-acquired National Institute of
Health grant for research into narcolepsy
will enable them to discover what triggers
the sleep disorder — and perhaps sleep
itself.
"We are very hopeful that we can un
derstand what causes narcolepsy, which is
an important first step to finding a cure for
it," said Dr. Theodore Baker, the research
associate directing the new project. "We
have exciting evidence about its causes
from some pilot studies, we have state of
the art techniques accessible to us here,
and we think we're hot on the track to
finding its cause."
The research venture is a three year,
$100,000 a year effort to unravel the mys
teries of this sleep disorder, which afflicts
roughly 250,000 Americans, according to
an American Narcolepsy Association Sur
vey.
Stanford was selected for the work in
part because of its rare "breeding popula
tion" of narcoleptic dogs: "The problem
in finding a cure for narcolepsy is that it is a
rare disease, so finding examples of it to
study is not easy. We have a center of
narcolpetic dogs here, and that's one rea
son why we were selected to study the
disease," explained Dr. Craig Heller, as
sociate professor of biological sciences
who is one of the investigators on the
project.

State-of-the-art monitoring techniques
developed here provide the other key to
the research project: the narcoleptic
dogs will be "watched" bv electrodes
which can see the parts of th« brain that
are particularly active during a "sleep at
tack."
"We've developed an electrode that is
very tine, tiner than a hair, and tlexible.
They can stay with a brain cell as it func
tions, so if there's a region ot the brain
that's very busy during REM sleep or nar
colepsy, we can see what's going on in the
active cells," said Heller. "This process is
unique to Stanford; we sharpened the
electrode use to record activity from single
cells while they're still living. This is very
useful in studying narcolepsy."

" Narcolepsy probably af
fects the same part of the
brain that controls REM
sleep. This is the most excit
ing aspect of this work-the
window it presents into the
basic brain mechanisms of
arousal and rest. .

According to Heller, "It is reasonable to
think that three years will allow us to find a
cure for narcolepsy." Baker, though he
cautions that no one could say for sure
they will find a cure for something, also
expressed optimism about the results of
the group's work.
Evidence already exists, according to the
team that narcolepsy stems from an inher
ited neurochemical disorder. "When we
unravel this mechanism, we hope to find,

it not a cure, then better therapy for the
disorder, a drug correcting the chemical
deficit that we described," said Baker.
"And narcolepsy probably affects the
same part of the brain that controls REM
sleep. This is the most exciting aspect of
this work, the window it presents into
basic brain mechanisms of arousal and
rest. . . It's ironic that we spend a third of
our lives asleep and vet we have no idea
about its origins, said Heller. Sleep re
searchers are particularly anxious to pro
duce a treatment tor narcolepsy because
current remedies are so limited: the am
phetamines, or stimulants, prescribed for
narcolepsy have numerous side effects
and become ineffective as the narcoleptic
developes a tolerance for them. "In addi
tion," said Baker, "they are generalized
neurologic system drugs, rather than
case-specific, so that they aftect the whole
body."
The similarities between narcolepsy
symptoms and REM sleep have led re
searchers to link the two: "there is a hair
trigger for REM sleep in narcoleptics, so
that they go into REM sleep in five minutes
rather than the usual hour and a half,"
explained Baker. For example, a pleasura
ble experience can trigger "cataplexy",
where narcoleptics suffer the paralysis
similar to that which occurs during REM
sleep.
Another symptom, sleep paralysis
causes the body to remain in a RFM sleep
paralysis even after the mind has woken
up. "The brain awakes but the body
doesn't" says Heller. "This is the paralysis
of REM sleep." Other narcoleptics suffer
sudden, vivid dream states similar to the
REM dream state. "These sleep attacks
look a lot like REM sleep. They indicate
that narcolepsy is some sort of REM sleep
disorder," concluded Baker.

cells while they're still living. This is very

" Narcolepsy probably af
fects the same part of the
brain that controls REM
sleep. This is the most excit
ing aspect of this work-the
window it presents into the
basic brain mechanisms of
arousal and rest. .

According to Heller, "It is reasonable to
think that three years will allow us to find a
cure for narcolepsy." Baker, though he
cautions that no one could say for sure
they will find a cure for something, also
expressed optimism about the results of
the group's work.
Evidence already exists, according to the
team that narcolepsy stems from an inher
ited neurochemical disorder. "When we
unravel this mechanism, we hope to find,

it not a cure, then better therapy for the
disorder, a drug correcting the chemical
deficit that we described," said Baker.
"And narcolepsy probably affects the
same part of the brain that controls REM
sleep. This is the most exciting aspect of
this work, the window it presents into
basic brain mechanisms of arousal and
rest. . . It's ironic that we spend a third of
our lives asleep and vet we have no idea
about its origins, said Heller. Sleep re
searchers are particularly anxious to pro
duce a treatment tor narcolepsy because
current remedies are so limited: the am
phetamines, or stimulants, prescribed for
narcolepsy have numerous side effects
and become ineffective as the narcoleptic
developes a tolerance for them. "In addi
tion," said Baker, "they are generalized
neurologic system drugs, rather than
case-specific, so that they aftect the whole
body."
The similarities between narcolepsy
symptoms and REM sleep have led re
searchers to link the two: "there is a hair
trigger for REM sleep in narcoleptics, so
that they go into REM sleep in five minutes
rather than the usual hour and a half,"
explained Baker. For example, a pleasura
ble experience can trigger "cataplexy",
where narcoleptics suffer the paralysis
similar to that which occurs during REM
sleep.
Another symptom, sleep paralysis
causes the body to remain in a RFM sleep
paralysis even after the mind has woken
up. "The brain awakes but the body
doesn't" says Heller. "This is the paralysis
of REM sleep." Other narcoleptics suffer
sudden, vivid dream states similar to the
REM dream state. "These sleep attacks
look a lot like REM sleep. They indicate
that narcolepsy is some sort of REM sleep
disorder," concluded Baker.
The average person spends a third ot
their life asleep. Despite this, the mecha
nisms which cause sleep, and particularly
the deep, dream-state ot sleep called
Rapid Eye Movement sleep (REM sleep),
remain basically unknown today. And REM
sleep abnormalities, such as narcolepsy,
remain equally unexplained and uncura
ble.
But researchers here are optimistic that
a newly-acquired National Institute of
Health grant for research into narcolepsy
will enable them to discover what triggers
the sleep disorder — and perhaps sleep
itself.
"We are very hopeful that we can un
derstand what causes narcolepsy, which is
an important first step to finding a cure for
it," said Dr. Theodore Baker, the research
associate directing the new project. "We
have exciting evidence about its causes
from some pilot studies, we have state of
the art techniques accessible to us here,
and we think we're hot on the track to
finding its cause."
The research venture is a three year,
$100,000 a year effort to unravel the mys
teries of this sleep disorder, which afflicts
roughly 250,000 Americans, according to
an American Narcolepsy Association Sur
vey.
Stanford was selected for the work in
part because of its rare "breeding popula
tion" of narcoleptic dogs: "The problem
in finding a cure for narcolepsy is that it is a
rare disease, so finding examples of it to
study is not easy. We have a center of
narcolpetic dogs here, and that's one rea
son why we were selected to study the
disease," explained Dr. Craig Heller, as
sociate professor of biological sciences
who is one of the investigators on the
project.

State-of-the-art monitoring techniques
developed here provide the other key to
the research project: the narcoleptic
dogs will be "watched" bv electrodes
which can see the parts of th« brain that
are particularly active during a "sleep at
tack."
"We've developed an electrode that is
very tine, tiner than a hair, and tlexible.
They can stay with a brain cell as it func
tions, so if there's a region ot the brain
that's very busy during REM sleep or nar
colepsy, we can see what's going on in the
active cells," said Heller. "This process is
unique to Stanford; we sharpened the
electrode use to record activity from single
cells while they're still living. This is very
useful in studying narcolepsy."
