# Surviving cancer cures: does 'pot' help?

### PHYLLIS BURTON 
Tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), the active substance in
Marijuana, has been studied
here over the past several
years for use in treating the
nausea and vomiting as
sociated with cancer treat
ment. Although initially con
sidered a promising remedy,
researchers now indicate it
may not be the best way to re
lieve the painful side-effects
associated with cancer treat
ments.
THC, which is available from
the National Cancer Institute in
both pill and cigarette form,

was studied in more than 13
trials, including over 400 pa
tients in the first two years of
study, 1979-1981. Studies of
THC continue at medical cen
ters throughout the country,
and here at Stanford University
Medical Center.
The popularity of THC as a
drug to treat chemotherapy
and radiation induced nausea
and vomiting has declined
considerably over the last one
to two years.
The reasons for this are sev
eral. Lawrence Witt, Pharm.
D., a pharmacist in Oncology

at Stanford says"the paper
work alone is enough to keep
many doctors from getting
their patients into the research
protocol, especially consider
ingthatthe results of treatment
with THC are not that good."
He said that relief of nausea
and vomiting obtained with
THC has not proven to be any
better than many other drugs,
used alone, for most patients.
"The most effective treat
ment," he said, "is a combina
tion of drugs, such as Benadryl
and Droperidol."
One of the major disadvan

tages of THC, according to Witt
is the possibility of infection
with the fungus Aspergillis,
which can be life-threatening
to a cancer patient, whose im
mune system is compromised
due to anti-cancer drugs or
radiation treatments. (Asper
gillis is a common fungus,
harmless to healthy people,
which is found on many types
of vegetation.)
THC, in pill form, also can be
too slow acting to be of much
use. And THC may not be ef
fective at all for patients with a
history of frequent marijuana
use, according to Witt.
