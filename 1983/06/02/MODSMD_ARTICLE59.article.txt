# More campus bands to entertain partying students
## 
### TERRY VANN 
Dancing. Dancing is the key
word here. On any given
weekend night, somewhere on
the Stanford campus is a band
performing before a throng of
enthusiastic, dancing human
beings.
New wave is the music of
choice for nearly every party
playing band within a guitar's
throw of Stanford.
British Wire Cauge was
probably the first New Wave
ensemble to become locally
successful. According to lead
guitarist Steve Wolf, British
Wire Cauge has existed in one
form or another for about two
years.
"When we first formed, we
were about the only New Wave
band here," he said. "But since
then, a lot of interesting new
bands have come to Stanford.
It's good to see Stanford get
ting into New Wave."
The band, which plays an
even mix of originals and other
artists' songs, is composed of
Steve, rhythm guitarist Dan
Zedalles, bass guitarist Adrian
Roscher, and drummer
Sholom Acclesderg, all of
whom are grad students here.
A relatively unknown local
band, Splash, is also gaining in
notoriety. According to Nick
Dement, guitarist/pianist for
the group, Splash has taped a
video segment that will possi
bly be aired on MTV in the near
future.
"Although we'd love to play
on campus, there's a good
chance we could become na
tionally known before anyone
at Stanford even hears of us."
Dement, who together with
bassist Scott Lockhart and
drummer Steve Jenkins com
prise the band, stated that if

cornered, he'd say their
songlist calls to mind the Police
more than anything.
"We're an original, energe
tic, high-powered band that
plays a sort of ska-funk music
fusion. That's the closest cate
gory I can come up with.
A familiar band about cam
pus is Radio One. composed of
guitarist Rich Enthoven, voc
alist Lisa Christopher, drum
mer Dennis Ryan, bassist lack
Savers, and keyboardist Steve
Home, Radio One has played
the Stanford environs for the
past three years.
The band plavs a variety of
differing styles. A set com
monly includes tunes from
such disparate bands as the
Stray Cats, the Clash, Traffic,
Creedence Clearwater Revival,
and the Yardbirds, not to men
tion Radio One's own orignals.
"We have a great time play
ing," said Enthoven, "and
don't take ourselves too seri
ously. Don't get me wrong:
we're pretty casual, but we're a
great band.
kartoonz is the new band
on the block. Made up of sin
gers Annie Roskin and Sam
Neff, guitarist Mike Colley,
bassist Tom Watson, and
drummer Sarah Allen, kar
toonz is a totally under
graduate venture, so thev said
they hope to be around for
quite awhile.
With only two months of
existence under its belt, the
band has generated a surpris
ing number of gigs, due in part
to their versatile songlist that
includes adaptations from the
Talking Heads, Elvis Costello,
and the Police. Mostly,
though, their success stems
from their positive "party" at
titude.

"We like parties. We like the
feedback we get, said Roskin.
The people have a lot of spirit,
and when they get into the
music and dance, we have a lot
of tun playing it.
The Rescue, another band
comprised in part of Stanford
undergrads, presents the cam
pus with an alternative
Motown Soul R(S.B sound.
"We play classic dance music,"
said guitarist Matthew State.
Other members of The Res
cue include singers Chris Ehly,
Missy Peabody, and Adam
Cain, keyboardist left Silva,
bassist Hershel Yatovitz, and
drummer Tom Vogt. The band
has onlv been together eight
months, but during that time it
has played many campus par
ties.
It British Wire Cauge and the
kartoonz tvpity the New Wave
genre on campus, then it is the
Druids that express the '60s
psychedelic roots from that
which NewWave borrows. The
Druids, composed of bassist
|im Ferrell, keyboardist/
guitarist Lyle Zimmerman,
guitarist Chris Pilon, vocalist
Leslie Moulton, and drummer
Dan Purtell, draw heavily from
the '60s era, although they also
play '80s-vintage music.
"We play '60s and '80s tunes
at dance parties. We save our
originals for clubs."
Originally formed from the
merger of Rooftop Magic and
the Claude Monet Band in Jan
uary 1982, the Druids plan to
call it quits in June. Ferrell said
that the breakup is not due to
any conflict. "We just decided
to each go our own way."
During their existence, the
band has been a marked local
success. They released an orig
inal tape "Rock-A-Roni" in

January that has sold so well
that there are only thirty copies
left.
Logically one could assume
from the large number of
bands catering to Stanford
crowds that intense competi
tion would be the norm. Ap
parently this is not the case.
Said Radio One's Enthoven,
"Everyone's in it together.
We're all pretty much friends.
There is some competition

when a gig is offered to one of
two bands, but that doesn't
happen too often since each
band usually appeals to a
different crowd. Even then,
though, it's only friendly com
petition."
The Rescue's State took it a
bit further. "I haven't seen any
competition at all. Everyone is
super-nice to everyone else;
even equipment gets lent back
and forth between bands."
