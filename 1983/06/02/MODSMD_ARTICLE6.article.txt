Rebels deny executions
San Salvador, El Salvador —The United States and
Salvadoran guerrillas are fighting a backstage propa
ganda war over the fate of government soldiers cap
tured in combat.
Yesterday the guerrillas' senior battlefield com
mander scoffed at U.S. allegations that 42 soldiers
who surrendered after a battle last week had been
summarily executed. Captured soldiers are disarmed
and released as a matter of policy, he said.
The U.S. allegation came in a cable from the U.S.
Embassy here that was declassified and released in
Washington Tuesday. The cable said that after the sur
render of the troops guarding the Quebrada Seca
highway bridge in eastern El Salvador May 25 "a

number of soldiers were placed face down on the
ground and executed by the guerrillas.
The cable said that an 82-man force had guarded
the bridge and that 42 bodies had been recovered.
"Some 70-80 percent of the dead have head wounds
and powder burns and have suffered additional
mutilation — ears cut off, arms severed," the cable al
leged.
The fate of captives is an important part of the psy
chological war within a war here. As a rule, the guer
rillas release captured soldiers after a political scold
ing — a calculated and apparently successful assault
on army morale.
Soldiers who are released by the guerrillas are re-
•_~ii u corl fmm further militarv dutv bv the
army, which seldom reports the capture of guerrilla
prisoners. The guerrillas routinely distribute leaflets
urging soldiers to desert.
If it could be shown that the insurgents were killing
their prisoners it would damage the guerrillas' in
ternational prestige and might stiffen the resolve of
an army that has lost more than 900 men killed in bat
tle so far this year.
Eygpt, Sudan pledge unity
Cairo, Egypt —The 120-member Nile Valley Par
liament ended its first session in Khartoum, Sudan,
this week with both Egypt and Sudan pledging to
work toward continued economic integration and
political unity.
Although the six-day session that concluded Tues
day dealt largely with procedural matters, committees
were established to consider the use of a common
currency, the removal of trade barriers, the exchange
of experts in cultural and agricultural fields and the
end of laws prohibiting Sudanese men from marrying
Egyptian women and vice versa.
The parliament, composed of 60 members from
each country, has no real power but may eventually
be given some legislative authority. The two countries
have much in common, both depending on the Nile
River for their water supplies and holding similar,
pro-Western views in foreign affairs.
There are major differences, however. Egypt is an
Arab, predominantly Islamic, country. Sudan, directly
to the south, is about 40 percent Arab and 50 percent
black; 73 percent of the people are Moslems and 23
percent are reported to be pagans. The Arabs are po
litically dominant and control the Khartoum govern
ment.
Not coincidentally, the inauguration of the par
liament concided with the 14th anniversary of the mil
itary coup that brought President Jaafar Numeiri to
power in Sudan.
However, the celebrations were marred by a mili
tary mutiny in southern Sudan, which Numeiri's
forces crushed, and by the sinking of an overcrowded
Nile steamer shuttling peasants between Egypt and
Sudan. Nearly 300 persons died in the incident and
Egyptian authorities have announced that the ship's
19-member crew has been arrested on charges of
negligence.
Poles expect struggle
Warsaw, Poland — A Polish underground leader
said in an interview made available yesterday that al
though the underground has been fortified in recent
months, he expected a long struggle that could take
years to restore labor rights. He added that he ex
pected no concrete results from the much-antici
pated visit to Poland this month of Pope John Paul 11.
Zbigniew Bujak, the former Solidarity chairman in
Warsaw and perhaps the best-known of the former
union leaders in hiding since the imposition of martial
law 17 months ago, said the May Day demonstrations
were evidence of a stronger underground. The pro
tests, which drew tens of thousands in 20 Polish cities
in the face of massive police intimidation, reflected
improved cooperation between regional under
ground groups.
He said the underground leadership's general
strike call for Nov. 10, which failed, marked "a crucial
point for the union" in that it forced a change of
strategy in the direction of less demonstrative ac
tivities and a greater focus on the gradual estab
lishment of underground units.
He urged people seeking to found independent
unions to think in terms of "years, not weeks or
months."
Begin calls for national unity
Jerusalem — Against a rising tide of public impa
tience with the stalemate in Lebanon, Prime Minister
Menachem Begin appealed to Israelis for national
unity yesterday as the country approaches the first an
niversary next Monday of the invasion that set off the
war.
Begin, goaded by the acid comments of an opposi
tion Labor party member who publicly questioned
the decision to launch the war and his leadership dur
ing the conflict, made the emotional appeal during
what started as a routine parliamentary debate.

"I call on all factions that are loyal to the state to
stand together in this trial, as we have stood in other
times .... I ask that the same measure of unity which
existed at the start of the fighting should continue,"
Begin said as he called for help in finding conditions
that would bring home the estimated 20,000 Israeli
troops in Lebanon. His message came two days after
two Israeli soldiers were killed and another three
wounded in the continuing daily violence that has
boosted the number of Israeli war dead to almost 500.
Touching briefly on the recent reports of military
buildups by Israel and Syrian troops in Lebanon, the
prime minister declared that Israel has "absolutely no
intention of attacking the Syrians" and said that if Syr
ia attacked Israel, "we shall all have to defend our
lives, our existence and our future."
Chinese expelled from Mongolia
Peking — Displaying unusual restraint, China yes
terday said Chinese nationals continue to be driven
out of Soviet-controlled Mongolia despite several
protests to Mongolian authorities.
"We are closely following the developments," said
the Foreign Ministry in its first public reaction since
hundreds of Chinese passport holders reportedly
were herded onto trains, stripped of their possessions
at the border and returned to China in recent weeks.
Diplomats here said the statement was mild com
paredtothe bombast and threats usually issued by Pe
king when its citizens are mistreated abroad.
The analysts said Peking may be deliberately down
playing the issue so as not to upset its talks with Mos
cow on the proposed pullout of Russian troops in
Mongolia, a Communist nation sandwiched between
China and the Soviet Union.
"The Chinese don't want to rock any boats at this
moment," explained a European diplomat.
Large numbers of Chinese living in the Mongolian
capital of Ulan Bator have been expelled after being
given an ultimatum in March to move to remote areas
or leave the country, according to diplomats and
Western businessmen traveling from Mongolia by
train.
Travelers on the Trans-Siberian Express in recent
weeks have reported seeing several hundred Chinese
forced to give up their wristwatches, radios and other
personal items before they were dumped at railway
depots in north China.
The March edict affects about 8000 Chinese con
struction workers, remnants of the skilled labor force
sent to Ulan Bator in the 1950s when relations be
tween China and Mongolia were good.
Philippines allow U.S. bases
Manila, Philippines —The Philippines and the Unit
ed States signed a new five-year agreement yesterday
allowing U.S. use of two major military bases and five
support facilities in this country.
President Ferdinand Marcos and Michael
Armacost, the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines,
signed for their respective governments after 17 days
of informal talks by a panel of negotiators.
In exchange for use of the bases, the United States
will pay $900 million for a five years.
Marcos said that other Asian nations had en
couraged the Philippines to continue the military
bases accord because the balance of power would be
endangered without the U.S. military presence in Asia
and the Pacific.
Stocks fall in mixed trading
The stock market turned in a mixed performance in
topsy-turvy trading yesterday, interrupting a broad
slide, as interest rates stopped rising.
Nine stocks fell in price for every seven that rose on
the New York Stock Exchange. But the NYSE's com
posite index of all its listed common stocks rose .05 to
94.13.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down
29.03 points over the previous three sessions, rose 2.23
points to close at 1202.21.

chance of showers. Clearing tonight and tomorrow.
