Cowell Student Health Cen
ter (the building) has been
around on the Stanford cam
pus since 1966. James McClen
ahan, the current director of
Cowell, has been around on the
Stanford campus since 1963,
when he was hired as a physician.
Since 1967, he has been the
director of the Student Health
Center, which means that he
and the building must have
been through a lot together.
But now things are changing
a little bit. Don't worry, the
Cowell building isn't moving
it looks fairly secure right
where it is, with little chance
of wandering off in the near
future. But McClenahan has
decided to move on, to retire
after 20 years of service this
month.
McClenahan doesn't like to
think of it as retiring, though.
"I think changing is a better
word for it,"he said in an
interview with The Student
Body. "In the 50-year-old set,
we like to think of it as re
potting." McClenahan still plans
to work in the medical pro
fession, and he offered his
views on where the profession
is headed, especially in terms
of student care.
According to McClenahan,
there's been an increasingly
greater awareness of student
health concerns in the last
20 tO 30 years, evidenced by
the rise of student health
centers. "Now you have them
everywhere, unless you're a
real commuter college. Health
centers are predominant in
residential universities, because
that's where the students are."
In addition, there have been
significant changes in what
these centers do. In McClena
han's view, there have been

Dr. James McClenahan in 1967

two major transitions in student
care, and in care provided at
Cowell, since he took over
in 1967. One is in the area
of psychiatric counseling. "In
1967, we had only one psy
chologist at the health service.
There was a separate counseling
and testing service that did
vocational counseling as well
as emotional counseling. Since
then, we've expanded our
counseling services to the point
where we have CAPS (Counsel
ing and Psychological Services),
with 9 or 10 psychologists,
psychiatrists and social workers
The idea makes some sense -
the whole patient and all that
business."
Another recent emphasis in
student health care is on pre
ventative medicine and out
reach. McClenahan feels that
this is part of a larger trend
in medicine as a whole, based
on a previously overlooked set
of statistics. "If you look
nationally at who dies, you'll
find that 45 to 50 percent

die of heart disease," said
McClenahan, "which you can
do something about through
strong programs of fitness and
nutrition." There are limits to
prevention in the care of
individuals, though. "You can
try to pick your parents
wisely and not have diabetes,
but we can't do anything
about that."
Nutrition and fitness, how
ever, have become more impor
tant issues at Cowell, to the
extent that McClenahan feels
that college is the best time
to educate people about their
health. "You've just moved
away from home for probably
the first time, setting up your
own home, trying to decide
what you want to do," said
McClenahan. In response,
Cowell has set up more pro
grams of health promotion and
education, taking advantage of
what, in the director's words,
was "always an emotional
priority, but not always a
budgetary one."
In regard to more obvious

priorities in student care, Mc-
Clenahan discussed how Cowell
operates in cooperation with
the Medical Center and the
Palo Alto Clinic. Cowell and
the University have a contract
with the Palo Alto Clinic to
exchange consultation services
and use each other's services
as necessary. By contrast, said
McClenahan, "we try to avoid
emergency room care (at the
Medical Center) if we can,"
citing actual cost as well as
the • costs passed on to the
student as factors. "But when
we need it, we're glad it's
there," he adds.
McClenahan is candid when
asked about studentperceptions
of Cowell. "We live in a sophis
ticated, desirable medical com
munity,"he said, an atmosphere
that sometimes leads to mixed
feelings about Cowell as a
health service. In response to
the "horror stories" that some
times circulate about Cowell
among students, McClenahan
points out that "as students
use the service more, their

perception improves," as in
dicated on surveys and other
studies. McClenahan sees this
fact as being "tied in to in
creasingly realistic expectations
of what medicine can do."
As his retirement from
Cowell nears, McClenahan
stresses that the health center's
"primary mission is to take
care oi sick students." This
is no different from the days
before 1967. when the health
center was located in a wing of
the women's gym and members
of the Stanford Mothers' Club
took sick students home for
overnight care. But after 16
years at the Cowell Student
Health Center under James
McClenahan's direction, "we've
discovered that part of that
mission is educational, through
modeling good health practices
and explaining why those prac
tices are good." The intended
result of this expanded mission,
said McClenahan,"is to provide
health care the way we think
it should be done everywhere
here and in the real world."

that college is the best time
to educate people about their
health. "You've just moved
away from home for probably
the first time, setting up your
own home, trying to decide
what you want to do," said
McClenahan. In response,
Cowell has set up more pro
grams of health promotion and
education, taking advantage of
what, in the director's words,
was "always an emotional
priority, but not always a
budgetary one."
In regard to more obvious

priorities in student care, Mc-
Clenahan discussed how Cowell
operates in cooperation with
the Medical Center and the
Palo Alto Clinic. Cowell and
the University have a contract
with the Palo Alto Clinic to
exchange consultation services
and use each other's services
as necessary. By contrast, said
McClenahan, "we try to avoid
emergency room care (at the
Medical Center) if we can,"
citing actual cost as well as
the • costs passed on to the
student as factors. "But when
we need it, we're glad it's
there," he adds.
McClenahan is candid when
asked about studentperceptions
of Cowell. "We live in a sophis
ticated, desirable medical com
munity,"he said, an atmosphere
that sometimes leads to mixed
feelings about Cowell as a
health service. In response to
the "horror stories" that some
times circulate about Cowell
among students, McClenahan
points out that "as students
use the service more, their

perception improves," as in
dicated on surveys and other
studies. McClenahan sees this
fact as being "tied in to in
creasingly realistic expectations
of what medicine can do."
As his retirement from
Cowell nears, McClenahan
stresses that the health center's
"primary mission is to take
care oi sick students." This
is no different from the days
before 1967. when the health
center was located in a wing of
the women's gym and members
of the Stanford Mothers' Club
took sick students home for
overnight care. But after 16
years at the Cowell Student
Health Center under James
McClenahan's direction, "we've
discovered that part of that
mission is educational, through
modeling good health practices
and explaining why those prac
tices are good." The intended
result of this expanded mission,
said McClenahan,"is to provide
health care the way we think
it should be done everywhere
here and in the real world."


Cowell Student Health Cen
ter (the building) has been
around on the Stanford cam
pus since 1966. James McClen
ahan, the current director of
Cowell, has been around on the
Stanford campus since 1963,
when he was hired as a physician.
Since 1967, he has been the
director of the Student Health
Center, which means that he
and the building must have
been through a lot together.
But now things are changing
a little bit. Don't worry, the
Cowell building isn't moving
it looks fairly secure right
where it is, with little chance
of wandering off in the near
future. But McClenahan has
decided to move on, to retire
after 20 years of service this
month.
McClenahan doesn't like to
think of it as retiring, though.
"I think changing is a better
word for it,"he said in an
interview with The Student
Body. "In the 50-year-old set,
we like to think of it as re
potting." McClenahan still plans
to work in the medical pro
fession, and he offered his
views on where the profession
is headed, especially in terms
of student care.
According to McClenahan,
there's been an increasingly
greater awareness of student
health concerns in the last
20 tO 30 years, evidenced by
the rise of student health
centers. "Now you have them
everywhere, unless you're a
real commuter college. Health
centers are predominant in
residential universities, because
that's where the students are."
In addition, there have been
significant changes in what
these centers do. In McClena
han's view, there have been

Dr. James McClenahan in 1967

two major transitions in student
care, and in care provided at
Cowell, since he took over
in 1967. One is in the area
of psychiatric counseling. "In
1967, we had only one psy
chologist at the health service.
There was a separate counseling
and testing service that did
vocational counseling as well
as emotional counseling. Since
then, we've expanded our
counseling services to the point
where we have CAPS (Counsel
ing and Psychological Services),
with 9 or 10 psychologists,
psychiatrists and social workers
The idea makes some sense -
the whole patient and all that
business."
Another recent emphasis in
student health care is on pre
ventative medicine and out
reach. McClenahan feels that
this is part of a larger trend
in medicine as a whole, based
on a previously overlooked set
of statistics. "If you look
nationally at who dies, you'll
find that 45 to 50 percent

die of heart disease," said
McClenahan, "which you can
do something about through
strong programs of fitness and
nutrition." There are limits to
prevention in the care of
individuals, though. "You can
try to pick your parents
wisely and not have diabetes,
but we can't do anything
about that."
Nutrition and fitness, how
ever, have become more impor
tant issues at Cowell, to the
extent that McClenahan feels
that college is the best time
to educate people about their
health. "You've just moved
