# Procrastination: when 'tomorrow' arrives

### Douglas Doher, Ph. D Alejandro Martinez, Ph. D 
Procrastination seems to be
part of the human condition.
To one extent or another
everyone procrastinates. It
generally takes two forms;
delaying the initiation of a
necessary task or staying on
one segment of a task instead
of moving on to another and
consequently prolonging the
task, at times endlessly. Some
chronic procrastinators like jo
kingly to characterize them
selves as individuals who seem
to be in a hurry to get nowhere,
are late getting there, and
often feel overburdened by it.
Other descriptions include un
disciplined, careless, disorderly,
unorganized, and on and on.
We find that this type of
accusation or self blame as the
case might be, is not terribly
helpful in resolving the problem.
Procrastination is a compli
cated phenomenon. Individuals
cannot begin to change until
they understand the functions
it serves in their lives and
there is a recognition of the
diversions that obscure the
problem from their own aware
ness.

The functions procrastina
tion serves in our lives are
multidimensional inasmuch as
they have different meanings.
Delaying the mailing of a $5.00
rebate coupon may reflect
general indifference towards
mailing the coupon and thus
may be a simple and trivial
problem. In contrast, a pattern
of showing up late for appoint
ments, not returning calls,
delaying follow through on
committments, characteristical
ly missing deadlines, continual
ly putting off the beginning of
lab work, getting stuck re
viewing literature instead of
beginning to write, and a
growing list of incompletes
is reflective of a more complex
problem.
It may very well be a
healthy sign that a reassess
ment of life direction is in
order. It may for example
be a sign that a career or
major re-evaluation is needed.
In many cases the procrasti
nation may continue until
this healthy sign is heeded.
At other levels, procrasti
nation can signal time mis
management, or more common
ly, a way of expressing internal
conflict and protecting a vul
nerable sense of self esteem.
Understanding the causes of
procrastination cannot of itself
cure it, but insight and under

standing of it often can be a
major catalyst for effectively
dealing with the problem.
Equally important in modify
ing this self defeating behavior
is understanding the actual
process, which reveals where
delays are likely to occur.
Most individuals are aware
that the hardest part of a given
task often is just getting started.
This is because the beginning
of an activity requires more
structure and decisions than
later aspects of the task or
alternative activities. Since in
creased cognitive demands upon
us typically heighten! our
level of anxiety, it is not
surprising that individuals "slip"
into activities that, at best on
a short term basis, reduce or
postpone the anxiety. For
instance, when working on a
term paper time spent in
preparatory reading or getting
the desk ready for work
represents alternate behaviors
which are intially less stressful
than writing. This happens
because these behaviors do not
require individuals to organize,
clarify or define their thoughts
or to make decisions on how
to best express them.
Once a task is initiated
individuals are not likely to
procrastinate until a decision
point is reached again. Un
fortunately in academic work

decision points are frequent,
particularly between compo
nents of the task, and may
even occur in five to ten
minute intervals.
Other significant aspects
of the procrastination process
are decisions that are made
between direct work-related
activities and other activities.
While work related activities
are generally perceived as long
term tasks (a term paper may
be expected to take several
weeks, a dissertation at least
a year), non work activities
(cleaning one's room, watching
the news or television, reading
the newspaper) are perceived
as commitments to small seg
ments of time, thus the cost
of choosing in favor of a low
priority activity ( a half hour
of t.v. watching) instead of
a high priority activity ( a
paper that is going to take
two weeks) is not perceived
as very high. Its only a half
hour after all. It is only in
retrospect, that the total cost
of these decisions is fully
realized. To convince them
selves that these small diversions
are not serious threats to
working, they often remain in
the setting where they could
work if the procrastination
stopped.
Invitations to go to the
movies or to the beach are

forcefully turned down with
good intentioned thoughts of
spending a day or an evening
working, yet they remain in
the work environment doing
other activities which unsus
pectingly take up the allotted
time for work. The day is over
with very little accomplished.
Given the complexities of
procrastination, no wonder that
its a very difficult problem to
master. We know that develop
ing a personal understanding
of the causes of procrastina
tion and a willingness to con
front and work at resolving
the issues raised by this under
standing is an essential step. It
also helps to discontinue valuing
only the finished product of
our efforts and begin to see
that intermediate steps can
also bring a sense of accom
plishment. Some practical tips
that can also help are; the set
ting of deadlines; the use of
reminders; handling material
only once; refraining from
premature rewrites;committing
yourself only to short suc
cessive work intervals; mapping
out the steps of a work plan;
rewarding yourself for each
subgoal achieved, delegating
tasks that others do more
effectively; finding people that
you can work with and who
can be encouraging of your
efforts.
