Many students come to
Cowell for information and
help with eating disorders. To
understand the experience of
a student with an eating
disorder we have printed this
letter which appeared in the
Stanford Daily. This student
was a patient at CAPS.
Food: "I hate food," I
remember saying on the firs*
day of therapy. For eight
years I have lived in daily
fear of food: the food in my
refrigerator, in stores, in restau
rants, in other people's homes.
I had a compulsive habit of
turning to food and eating
great amounts very quickly
and secretively, hating myself
with every bite, and yet unable
to make myself stop. My
stomach would become heavy
and aching. I would feel
letharqic and guilty.
It is a grotesque act of ex
cess, and no one can be more
horrified than the "binge ea
ter." But reason aside, I could
not stop thinking about food
or eating it when alone.
My attitude about food be
came unhealthy when I was
about fourteen. My parents
came from a fairly wealthy
community, very upwardly mo
bile. They had many expec
tations for their children, all
of which I internalized. But in
any community, the standards
of beauty for women are
rigorous: very thinl but also
curvaceous, with tan and clear
complexion (models exemplify
the standards Ã¼biquitously).
All through high school, I

would go to stores, load up on
candy, donuts, and other bulk,
and eat them all at once. Other
girls were always worried about
their looks, too, but we kept
our eating excesses secret.
Some girls began to develop
anorexia nervosa and began to
starve themselves, eventually
losing more than their natural
body weight; others vomited
the food up after going on a
binge, or even after regular
meals. But vomiting seemed
too drastic for me.
I hated myself, every inch
of me, and by now I had be
come overweight, which con
firmed my sense of myself as
a horrible person. I hated
my lack of discipline but I
could not control myself,
whether happy or sad. When
I was compelled to binge,
all I could think of-despite
conversations occuring around
me-was how to get something
to eat. Once I ate, I felt I'd
blown it, so I'd return to
food again and again in the
same day.
Of course, whomever I was
with-family, friends, lovers
never saw me eating, but they
could feel the repercussions.
The guilt and self-hatred made
me mopey and depressed; the
excess food made me inactive.
I was a horror to be around; I
remember those years regret
fully for all the good times
that I ruined.
Especially my relationships
with men suffered, because of
my insecurity about my body,
feeling unworthy to be touched
or loved.

At Stanford, the pressure to
"look good" and act rationally
was magnified tremendously.
We internalize the requirements
to be attractive into a strong
conscience, intensified by our
expectations on ourselves to
excel in academics and other
areas. Those of us who respond
to food as I do, carry dictators
in our heads.
To toss off that control with
a binge becomes a perverse
pleasure. One does not think,
one just eats. It may be the one
time in a day when the body
and mind stop rushing around;
but it is a false attempt to relax.
By my fourth year here, I
had begun to vomit. It was
a way to eat everything I was
going to eat anyhow, but not
carry around the weight and
its reminder of failure. The
retching disgusted me.
Last January I called Cowell
to get help. I was desperate
with my eight years of self
punishment; I knew that I
shouldn't be vomiting. I was
tired of having my life ruled by
this outside influence. To my
great fortune, a group was just
beginning to form for people
with "eating problems."
The first day, there were
four women (more came later);
we were nervous, but the
therapists seemed to under
stand our dilemma, and at last
we each had a supportive place
to unload our secret burdens.
The stories spilled out. We
were no longer alone, and
help was possible.
The other women at that
time were not anorexic, though

one joined us later. We all
suffered from having too high
expectations of ourselves and
typical of that, we thought
we could solve the problem
quickly, now that we had sup
port.
But the path was a long one.
It got worse before it got bet
ter. The messages and patterns
for each of us built up over the
years could not be erased only
by thinking change. We had a
lot of pain around other issues,
most of all, our relations with
parents and siblings, for which
food had become a detour. We
had to understand our essen
tial selves very well before we
could change.
The members of the group
depended on and received
support, consolation and en
couragement from each other
when no one else could under
stand the embarrassing nature
of our problem. The insights of
the doctors were crucial to our
process of self-realization. Grad
ually I began to know more
what I wanted, not what
others wanted of me. We could
at last identify how we really
wanted to be, and test our
fears on each other and the
doctors. It was exciting and
scary to say "no" when I meant
it in every way.
The therapy group formed a
real turning point in my con
sciousness of myself and my
potential. Now I am wary of
food; I now I can still hurt my
self if I "forget" what I have
learned. But my new self
confidence extends fully into
my life and I can now protect
myself.
