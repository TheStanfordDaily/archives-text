# The
						night shift
## While you were asleep.... 
### Birgitta Pankenier, R. N 
My working night starts at
10:00 p.m. when I am awak
ened from a deep sleep. I take
a shower, drink two cups of
strong coffee, and during my
three minute drive from home
I listen to loud music on the
radio. By the time I sit down
for report I am quite awake.
The night shift (11:00 p.m.
- 7:00 a.m.) consists of a night
nurse and a nursing assistant.
We take care of both the in
firmary in-patients and students
who get injured or sick during
the night and cannot wait
until morning. We also answer
telephone requests. Two doc
tors are on call, should they
be needed. There really are no
typical nights; I guess that is
one of the challenges with
this job you never know what
is coming up. Real emergencies
go by ambulance directly to
Stanford Hospital;that includes
unconscious alcohol intoxica
tion patients. Otherwise, we
take care of everything from
ingrown toenails to glass slivers
in the hair.
Last night is an example:
Denise, the nursing assistant
and I started our night by going
around to see our patients. We
gave medication, blankets, or
whatever else was needed.
Around midnight three patients
came in. One patient was
asthma, the second had a
sprained ankle, and the third
had a laceration that did not
require sutures so I did not
have tcÂ» call the doctor. It
was cleaned and steri-stripped
instead, vhich I do on my own.
We, the night staff, finish

off the previous day's paper
work and prepare for the
coming day. While doing that I
answered telephone calls about
everything from food poisoning
to geographic tongue and tooth
ache. Sometimes the calls are
minor but we prefer students
calling before they come in
(497-4861) because we often
can help them over the phone
thus preventing the inconveni
ence of coming to the Infirmary
in the middle of the night.
When Denise and I sat
down for coffee break at
3:00 a.m. a patient came in
complaining of insomnia. We
talked about relaxation and
hot milk. After that the
Infirmary was quiet-our pa
tients all slept comfortably.
One of the hardest de
cisions the night staff faces
is when a student with a
medical problem comes in and
it is not clear if it is severe
enough to awaken the on-call
physician at home. Abdomi
nal pain could be a bad case
of indigestion or an acute
appendicitis. Sometimes stu
dents come in expecting to
see a doctor at 4:00 a.m.
Depending on the situation,
they may be taken care of
by a nurse, be put in bed in
the Infirmary until the doctor
comes in at 9:00 a.m. , may
warrant the doctor coming in
to treat them then, or may
return at 9:00 a.m. to be
treated during the outpatient
hours. The nurse has to make
these decisions by herself.
Hospitals are different at

night. The pace is less hectic
and we have enough time for
each patient who needs it.
Many good conversations take
place during the night. Our
minds seem to be more open
and creative in the wee hours.
That is the time to test newborn
ideas before exposing them to
the bright logic of the day.
Being a night person I enjoy
that block of time for think
ing or winding down.
The hour before dawn is
always chilly and passes, oh,
so slowly. I sit close to the
heater and become more and
more conscious of how tired
I am. It's hard to resist watch
ing the clock whose hands
seem hardly to move. About
5:30 a.m. I get myself moving
again by drinking a cup of
hot tea. If it is a perfect
morning I go outside at sun
rise to pick up the paper.
The sky is spectacular then;
on one side of Cowell I might
see the moon setting, while
on the other side the sky is
glowing red. Very often there
will be a lone jogger running
along Campus Drive.
After 6:00 a.m. time passes
quickly; the night is over. We
do not have to be so quiet
any longer. Some of our
patients are starting to wake
up. Then comes the most
welcome sound of all-the
footsteps of the dayshift as
they arrive to take over.
After reporting I go straight
home and wake my family. I
might have to search for
matching socks for my children
and help my husband send
them off to school before I
eventually climb into a still
warm bed.
