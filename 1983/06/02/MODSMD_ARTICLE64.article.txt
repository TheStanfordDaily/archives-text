# The 						general practitioner
## Treatment from the mundane to the sublime 
### John Dorman, M. D 
After a survey of my various
diplomas, a curious student will
often ask, "why would a doc
tor of your training want to
work in a student health
service?". Certainly I did not
go through my internship and
residency yearning to work
with Stanford students!
Last summer I spent a two
month sabbatical period work
ing as the only pediatrician
for critically ill children in a
mission hospital in Zaire. This
experience led me, too, to
re-examine the validity of
working at Cowell. The first
emergency call I got when I
was on-call after returning was
from a student who had had
a cold for two weeks! Here
I have never had a patient
die; in Zaire, three or four
children died each week, re
gardless of my care. I have
justified (or rationalized!) my
work here with the philosophy
that we see students as they are
in transition from adolescence
to full adulthood, a time when
they are eager to learn; we have
an opportunity to use health
education in ways not available
to private doctors, and to
really teach students how to
best "use" doctors.
But it is also fun. In medical
school we are often taught
about the esoteric diseases;
in the real world, common
illnesses occur commonly.
"When you hear hoofbeats,
think horses, not zebras." (It
is said that when Stanford
medical students hear hoof

beats, they think of cobras
in high-heeled shoes!) The vast
majority of student illnesses
are minor infections or in
juries; sometimes on long days
we think they bring us problems
they would ordinarily bring to
their mothers! It is also a chal
lenge to understand a newly
arrived international student,
who is a whiz at nuclear
physics and can read English
in that field, but is a neo
phyte at talking about how his
stomach hurts, in a strange
language. Often too students
will write down one thing as
their chief complaint, when
the real reason for their coming
is only discovered as "Oh, by
the way, doctor, while I'm
here. .

When I am working with
interesting people and pre
dominantly minor problems,
there is always the danger of
overlooking some truly more
significant illness. In the last
ax months we have seen two
students with cancer of the
large bowel and rectum, very
rare in this age group. We have
had cases of malaria, amoebic
dysentery, and occasionally
syphilis.
Notallproblems are physical.
A couple of years ago I over
heard that a student I knew
well was being brought in by
the police over the lunch
hour to see the on-call psy
chiatrist, who they were trying
to locate. Mystified, I inquired.
Her mother had just died

unexpectedly in surgery, and
she was crying uncontrollably;
someone had called the police.
I told the secretary to forget
calling the psychiatrist. Here
was a healthy person having
a healthy reaction to a deve
stating event; all she needed
was "permission" to react this
way. She stayed at Cowell for
a couple of hours, then went
home. She never saw a psy
chiatrist, or needed to.
I never know what's coming
in: whether a cold for two
weeks, a breast lump, a student
who is frightened he has
herpes, a middle-of-the-night
appendicitis, or a cut fore
head from a basketball elbow
but that's what primary care
medicine is all about.
