# A 						day with students' feelings, problems and stresses
## 
### Harvey M. Weinstein, M. D 
The telephone rings just
before 9:00 a.m. It is the
secretary of one of the Deans.
She reports that a student was
wandering around the office at
8:30 a.m. acting strangely and
frightening the staff. They have
told the student to return at
10:00 a.m. Can I help? The
Dean and I work out a plan
for him to bring the student
over to see me if the student
is willing. I will have to re
schedule an 11:00 a.m. appoint
ment.
9:00 a.m. The door to my
office closes and the young
woman sits down. Her face
contorts as she bursts into
tears. How can she stay in
school when her father is
dying? What is the point of
studying when life is so cruel?
I cannot answer her questions
about an unfair God. I can
talk with her about why she
feels that she can be a better
parent to her younger brothers
and sisters than her mother. I
can also help her sleep better
with some medication.
10:00 a.m. The law student
is so anxious that I begin to
feel restless. He crosses and
uncrosses his legs; fidgets with
his hands and tells me that he
just cannot study. He is certain
that the first set of examina
tions will prove that he does
not belong at Stanford Law
School. And then he will be
exposed for the fraud that he
is-exposed to friends, family,
faculty. He has always been at
the top, now he is somewhere
in the middle. It is not good
enough. He does not know
that 80% of his classmates feel
the same. I make a note to
myself to talk about law
students' inability to share
fears with each other when I
talk to a Law School lunch
next week.
10:55 a.m. The Dean calls.
He is bringing the student over.
10:57 a.m. An RA calls.
Can I help arrange a talk on
Eating Disorders for her dorm.
Also they are having some diffi
culties with sexism in the resi
dence and there is much anger
right now between the men
and women. Is there some
workshop that can be developed
that can allow for an explora
tion of these issues?
11:10 a.m. The Dean intro
duces the graduate student
and leaves. He is disheveled
and looks as though he has not
slept in a week. I try to talk
with him. As he tries to talk,

he keeps looking around the
room and gesturing with his
hands. I ask him what he
thinks is happening to him.
He replies that he is very afraid;
that somehow a change is going
to occur, he does not know
what it is. A poster on campus
gave him the clue. No, he has
never felt this way before. He
has been under a great deal of
stress-dissertation, girlfriend
leaving, parental divorce. No,
he does not use drugs. He can
not concentrate; his thoughts
race. He is afraid to sleep or
eat because he does not know
what will happen to him. We
talk about his entering a hospi
tal to help him collect his
thoughts and become less afraid.
He agrees. In the next half
hour, we arrange hospitaliza
tion, speak with his Dean, call
his parents. His roommate
comes to drive him to the
hospital. As he leaves, he grabs
my hand and holds tightly.
The tears in his eyes make me
feel painfully sad-"Thank
you", he whispers.
12:30 p.m. I am late for a
meeting, so I grab a sandwich
in the Medical Student Lounge.
The meeting is of the Commit
tee on Weil-Being of Medical
Students. This is a committee
that was established four years
ago to look at the learning
climate in which medical stu
dents acquire the knowledge,
skills and attitudes that will
transform them into physicians.
We discuss the stresses on the
students; the problems that
they face; issues of sexism and
racism; childcare. Today, we are
trying to examine the question
of humanism in medicine. This
is a frustrating task with strong
opinions on all sides. How can
we translate these ideas into
programs that will help medical
students retain their sense of
self?
2:00 p.m. Back in my office.
Several telephone messages-a
Daily reporter wants an inter
view to discuss anorexia ner
vosa; a faculty member is
concerned about an advisee;
the laboratory test that I or
dered on a patient is in-I will
have to call her and change
the medication dosage. The
hospital wants to more about
the student's health insurance.
2:10 p.m. I am late for my
patient and I feel rushed; my
heart is beating fast. She comes
in and sits, not saying a word.
The silence seems never-ending.
I am puzzled and try to figure
out what may be going on. I
have worked with her for more

than a year and feel that I
understand the vagaries of her
moods. Finally, I break the
silence inviting her to speak.
"I did it again", she informs
me. My heart speeds up. She
has cut her abdomen again.
She has not done this in months.
Patiently, we go over the
events-her depression, anger,
and hurt. As we continue,
the pieces fall into place, and
she leaves with an ounce more
understanding. I feel strangely
empty as she departs-exhaust
ed and exhilarated at the same
time.
3:00 p.m. I am working
with a psychiatry resident as
his supervisor. Before discussing
the patients that he wants
help with, he tells me a couple
of jokes. The laughter and fun
release me from the tension of
the previous hour-I am grate
ful.
4:00-5:30 p.m. I telephone
the editor of a journal where I
submitied a paper. I do not
understand the modifications
that they requested.
It is time for the group
therapy in which I am co
leader. The students are all in
graduate or professional school.
Successful, attractive, and tal
ented. They come because they
are also unhappy. The theme
of the day is living one's life
for the approval of others.
My co-leader and I are attacked
for not giving enough answers-
I wish I had all the answers.
6.00 p.m. Home.' Children,
school problems and fun, music
lessons, domestic chores, laugh
ter.
8:00 p.m. I am to moderate
a panel on Dual Career Couples
at the Business School. It turns
out to be very rewarding. Al
though the issues are painful,
the couples are creative in
their coping methods-we enjoy
ourselves.
10:00 p.m. Home again. No
time or energy left to read
tonight. Time for quiet talk,
making school lunches, and
comparing notes. Some days
are like today-hectic, drain
ing; others are quieter. I have
chosen a people job-surround
ed and inundated by the
thoughts and emotions of
others-I pause to take stock
of my own.

Note: The patients described
in this article are fictional
representations culled from
scores of students over many
years.

the same. I make a note to
myself to talk about law
students' inability to share
fears with each other when I
talk to a Law School lunch
next week.
10:55 a.m. The Dean calls.
He is bringing the student over.
10:57 a.m. An RA calls.
Can I help arrange a talk on
Eating Disorders for her dorm.
Also they are having some diffi
culties with sexism in the resi
dence and there is much anger
right now between the men
and women. Is there some
workshop that can be developed
that can allow for an explora
tion of these issues?
11:10 a.m. The Dean intro
duces the graduate student
and leaves. He is disheveled
and looks as though he has not
slept in a week. I try to talk
with him. As he tries to talk,

he keeps looking around the
room and gesturing with his
hands. I ask him what he
thinks is happening to him.
He replies that he is very afraid;
that somehow a change is going
to occur, he does not know
what it is. A poster on campus
gave him the clue. No, he has
never felt this way before. He
has been under a great deal of
stress-dissertation, girlfriend
leaving, parental divorce. No,
he does not use drugs. He can
not concentrate; his thoughts
race. He is afraid to sleep or
eat because he does not know
what will happen to him. We
talk about his entering a hospi
tal to help him collect his
thoughts and become less afraid.
He agrees. In the next half
hour, we arrange hospitaliza
tion, speak with his Dean, call
his parents. His roommate
comes to drive him to the
hospital. As he leaves, he grabs
my hand and holds tightly.
The tears in his eyes make me
feel painfully sad-"Thank
you", he whispers.
12:30 p.m. I am late for a
meeting, so I grab a sandwich
in the Medical Student Lounge.
The meeting is of the Commit
tee on Weil-Being of Medical
Students. This is a committee
that was established four years
ago to look at the learning
climate in which medical stu
dents acquire the knowledge,
skills and attitudes that will
transform them into physicians.
We discuss the stresses on the
students; the problems that
they face; issues of sexism and
racism; childcare. Today, we are
trying to examine the question
of humanism in medicine. This
is a frustrating task with strong
opinions on all sides. How can
we translate these ideas into
programs that will help medical
students retain their sense of
self?
2:00 p.m. Back in my office.
Several telephone messages-a
Daily reporter wants an inter
view to discuss anorexia ner
vosa; a faculty member is
concerned about an advisee;
the laboratory test that I or
dered on a patient is in-I will
have to call her and change
the medication dosage. The
hospital wants to more about
the student's health insurance.
2:10 p.m. I am late for my
patient and I feel rushed; my
heart is beating fast. She comes
in and sits, not saying a word.
The silence seems never-ending.
I am puzzled and try to figure
out what may be going on. I
have worked with her for more

than a year and feel that I
understand the vagaries of her
moods. Finally, I break the
silence inviting her to speak.
"I did it again", she informs
me. My heart speeds up. She
has cut her abdomen again.
She has not done this in months.
Patiently, we go over the
events-her depression, anger,
and hurt. As we continue,
the pieces fall into place, and
she leaves with an ounce more
understanding. I feel strangely
empty as she departs-exhaust
ed and exhilarated at the same
time.
3:00 p.m. I am working
with a psychiatry resident as
his supervisor. Before discussing
the patients that he wants
help with, he tells me a couple
of jokes. The laughter and fun
release me from the tension of
the previous hour-I am grate
ful.
4:00-5:30 p.m. I telephone
the editor of a journal where I
submitied a paper. I do not
understand the modifications
that they requested.
It is time for the group
therapy in which I am co
leader. The students are all in
graduate or professional school.
Successful, attractive, and tal
ented. They come because they
are also unhappy. The theme
of the day is living one's life
for the approval of others.
My co-leader and I are attacked
for not giving enough answers-
I wish I had all the answers.
6.00 p.m. Home.' Children,
school problems and fun, music
lessons, domestic chores, laugh
ter.
8:00 p.m. I am to moderate
a panel on Dual Career Couples
at the Business School. It turns
out to be very rewarding. Al
though the issues are painful,
the couples are creative in
their coping methods-we enjoy
ourselves.
10:00 p.m. Home again. No
time or energy left to read
tonight. Time for quiet talk,
making school lunches, and
comparing notes. Some days
are like today-hectic, drain
ing; others are quieter. I have
chosen a people job-surround
ed and inundated by the
thoughts and emotions of
others-I pause to take stock
of my own.

Note: The patients described
in this article are fictional
representations culled from
scores of students over many
years.

The telephone rings just
before 9:00 a.m. It is the
secretary of one of the Deans.
She reports that a student was
wandering around the office at
8:30 a.m. acting strangely and
frightening the staff. They have
told the student to return at
10:00 a.m. Can I help? The
Dean and I work out a plan
for him to bring the student
over to see me if the student
is willing. I will have to re
schedule an 11:00 a.m. appoint
ment.
9:00 a.m. The door to my
office closes and the young
woman sits down. Her face
contorts as she bursts into
tears. How can she stay in
school when her father is
dying? What is the point of
studying when life is so cruel?
I cannot answer her questions
about an unfair God. I can
talk with her about why she
feels that she can be a better
parent to her younger brothers
and sisters than her mother. I
can also help her sleep better
with some medication.
10:00 a.m. The law student
is so anxious that I begin to
feel restless. He crosses and
uncrosses his legs; fidgets with
his hands and tells me that he
just cannot study. He is certain
that the first set of examina
tions will prove that he does
not belong at Stanford Law
School. And then he will be
exposed for the fraud that he
is-exposed to friends, family,
faculty. He has always been at
the top, now he is somewhere
in the middle. It is not good
enough. He does not know
that 80% of his classmates feel
the same. I make a note to
myself to talk about law
students' inability to share
fears with each other when I
talk to a Law School lunch
next week.
