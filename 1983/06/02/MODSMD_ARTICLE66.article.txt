# Coming in to Cowell
## Juggling patients, problems and phones 
### Laura Arnold Carol Moore 
Monday morning, nine A.M.,
the lobby is crowded with
students whose physical com
plaints include running into a
divider on a bicycle, suspected
appendicitis, and a mole on
one's stomach which has been
there for six years. Some have
been waiting for twenty min
utes or more, some have just
walked in the door-but all
have the common intent of
receiving medical attention with

as little wait as possible.
Many prevalent student opi
nions about Cowell are gene
rated from initial impressions
which involve the front office
staff, as we are the staff
members that students en
counter first. We attempt to
expedite health care provision
while simultaneously juggling
four phones, walk-in patients,
patients with scheduled ap
pointments, and miscellaneous
messages to/from practitioners
and patients. In order to in
itiate the best overall care to
all students, we must priori
tize patients by immediate
symptoms, helping those most
urgent first. This means putting
someone who is bleeding from
a bicycle accident or is in

severe abdominal pain and
needs to lie down ahead of
everyone else, as well as
deciding which patients should
"walk-in" (ankle-sprain) and
who should wait for an appoint
ment in the future (mole for
six years). Decisions may seem
arbitrary; but, we try to use
the walk-in clinic for patients
with immediate/short term con
cerns. A condition lasting seve
ral weeks or more is not less
important than poison oak or
a sprained ankle, but it may
not require immediate inter
vention. Unfortunately, inap
propriate use of the Health
Services primarily inconveni
ences one's fellow students
more than the practitioners;
the more inappropriate walk
ins there are, the longer it

takes for appropriate ones to
be seen.
Coupled with the task of
prioritizing students' ailments
at the front desk is an attempt
to retain a sense of privacy,
especially if the matter is
personal or sensitive. We feel
that it is easier to write down
a problem than announce it
to the room at laige, thus also
saving embarrassing questions.
The results, however, are often
cryptic at best. Imagine trying
to decide who should see the
following: "Pain somewhere
around mumps" or "Flue or
else". Would "left toe was
put under the door by mistake"
precede "left ear hurts"? "I
cannot listen very well" can
strike us all occasionally, but

probably the simplest says it
all: "It came back". Other
intriguing "chief complaints"
have included: "treatment for
Athlete's Foot, now I have
same rash on hands-Athlete's
hand?" or, "just discovered I
have intestinal hitchhikers" or,
"Need tetanus shot-monkies
keep biting me" and finally
a real dilemma, "skin irrita
tion on the neck caused by
hairy caterpillar".
We take all of our patients
seriously, and do our best to
facilitate their good health.
The greatest challenge of all
is to try to interject as much
humanity as possible into a
system that must be efficient
to provide optimal medical
care.
