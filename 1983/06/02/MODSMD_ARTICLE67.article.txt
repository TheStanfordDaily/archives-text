# Hayfever
## Sneezes, sniffles and wheezing 
### 
One fifth of the population
suffers from allergies which
means that many people feel
"itchy", "wheezy", "runny",
and "stuffed", The most fre
quent form of allergy is hay
fever which is the common
term for seasonal allergic rhi
nitis. In truth, hayfever has
no connection to "hay" or
"fever".
Hayfever is a type of
seasonal upper respiratory al
lergy. In spring, late summer
or early fall, when pollens
from flowers, trees and grass
es are produced, they become
airborne and come into contact
with the respiratory tract of
certain sensitive individuals,
causing an allergic response.
Other individuals are sensitive
to molds which are more
prevalent in wet weather.
Individuals who have never
experienced hayfever before,
may develop it after living in
one geographic location for
several seasons, becoming sen
sitized to certain pollens or
spores. Sensitivity may increase
over several seasons, then stabi
lize and reoccur every season
thereafter.
Symptoms may range in
intensity from mild itching
of the eyes, ears, nose and
throat, a clear watery dis
charge from the nose, and
sneezing, to wheezing and
bronchospasm. Wheezing may
be more noticeable at night
and during or after exercise.
Headache, insomnia and fa
tigue may be noticed in some

individuals.
Hayfever may be distinguished
from the common cold by the
lack of fever, presence of
sneezing, and a course of
symptoms starting during the
hayfever season and lasting
longer than the usual 7 to 10
day cold.
Symptoms occur when parti
cular antigens (spores and
pollens) come into contact
with the mucous membranes
of sensitive individuals. Cells
in the nasal mucosa called
mast cells are affected by the
allergens. The mast cell wall
becomes more permeable and
histamine is released from
inside the mast cell. Hista
mine causes: 1) dilation of
small capillaries, 2) increased
permeability of the capillary
walls allowing leakage of fluid
and cells, and 3) increased
secretion of mucous glands
and goblet cells lining the
respiratory tract. These re
action account for nasal con
gestion and discharge. It also
accounts for watery, itchy
eyes, ears, nose and throat.
Antihistamines are most often
recommended for allergic rhin
itis. They act by blocking the
effects of histamine and pre
vent or decrease nasal discharge,
congestion and itching. They
are most effective if taken
at the beginning of the allergy
season and continued through
out the season. They have the
side effect of causing sleepiness
in some individuals and should
not be taken with other

sedatives or alcohol.
Several types of antihista
mines, often in combination
with a decongestant, are avail
able without prescription at
pharmacies.
Desensitization is a procedure
whereby an individual is tested
for allergy to pollens, spores and
grasses or other allergens by
scratch test on the skin. The
offending allergens are then
made into an antigen which
is given by injection in in
creasing doeses at regular inter
vals. This builds up an individu
al's tolerance to the allergens.
Success is variable from person
to person. Because of this and
the expense of the procedure,
it is recommended that other
medications be tried first.
