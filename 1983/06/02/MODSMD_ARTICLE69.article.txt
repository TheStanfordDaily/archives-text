# Traveler's diarrhea
## Don't spoil your vacation 
### 
People don't like to talk
about it, but traveler's diarrhea
is a common problem for first
time tourists overseas. Here's
a description of the illness and
some possible treatments:
Most cases of traveler's
diarrhea are probably caused
by "enteropathogenic E coli"-
E coli bacteria that cause dis
ease in the intestines. The most
important aspect of prevention
is remembering that the diar
rhea occurs mostly from "fecal
oral" transmission. In the Peace
Corps, volunteers are told to
"boil it, cook it, peel it, or
forget it". Fresh salads and
ice (unless made from boiled
water) should be bypassed.
Cooked food should be eaten
while still hot. Bottled drinks
are OK.
In addition several medica
tions have been used to either
prevent or treat the problem:
Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto
Bismol) is a cheap, over-the
counter preparation that seems
uniquely effective in preventing
traveler's diarrhea, as well as in
its treatment. If used preven
tively, the liquid has been
studied and found effective,
but in fairly high doses: l A
cup four times a day! This
volume would be ZV2 pints
for a weeks vacation! Others
have recommended the more
portable tablets, at one or
two a day, but the tablets
have not been studied, nor
has the lower dose.
Pepto-Bismol can also be
used only if symptoms occur;
in this case, follow instructions
on the bottle.
Antibiotics have also been
used, both preventively (pro
phylactically) and therapeutic
ally (only if symptoms). The
main argument against pre
ventative antibiotics is a public
health one: indiscriminate use
of antibiotics will promote the
emergence of antibiotic-resis
tant bacteria.
Doxycyline (Vibramycin) a
relative of tetracycline, was the

first drug used preventively.
One pill a days has been found
to be effective. The main
disadvantages are cost ($.60-
$.80/ pill or higher) and in
creased sun sensitivity in those
who take it. If taken as treat
ment only (for symptoms),
doxycycline is taken twice
daily.
Regular tetracycline is much
less expensive, but has not
been studied. It also must be
taken four times/day where
doxcyline is effective only 2
times per day. Sun sensitivity
again may be a problem.
Trimethoprim-sulfameth- j
oxazole (Septra DS, Bactrim |
DS) has been used both pre-- )
ventively (once a day) and
therapeutically (twice a day)
for treatment of the problem.
Those who are allergic to
sulfa should not use this
regimen; trimethoprim alone
(200 mg.) is also effective as |
treatment when taken twice
daily.
Less desirable treatments
Diphenoxylate HCI/Atro
pine (Lomotil) has been used
widely for diarrhea in the pasfc
Though quite effective, studies
have shown that this drug may
prolong the illness; when the
drug is stopped, diarrhea may
return.
Enterovioform is available
over-the-counter for diarrhea
in Mexico. Although somewhat
effective against amoebic dys
entery. It is not particularly
effecitve against enteropatho
genic E coli and may have
side effects.
Not all traveler's diarrhea
responds to these measurefc
Amoeba, giardia, and other
parasites are not treated by the
above antibiotics. Some bacter
ial infections (salmonella, shifV
gella, cholera) may not be
prevented. Diarrhea which per«
sists, becomes severe, or ii
associated with bleeding or.
high fever should be evaluated;
medically.
