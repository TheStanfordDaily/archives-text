# Hospital may set up AIDS clinic

A professor at the Stanford Hospital plans to open a
clinic to treat and prevent AIDS, an often fatal disease
that has occurred mostly among gay men.
The professor, Dennis McShane, said he expects
more cases of AIDS here in the future. "If the number of
cases keeps increasing at its present rate, by the end of
the 1984 there will be 50,000 cases (nationwide)."
Two cases of AIDS, including one last week, have
been reported to the San Mateo County Health Depart
ment.
According to Christopher Chow, clinical associate
professor of medicine, the Stanford Hospital has already
treated at least four victims of AIDS (acquired immune
deficiency syndrome), a mysterious disease that attacks
the body's immune system.
Beginning in July, the Stanford Blood Bank will test
every potential donor's blood for certain types of lym
phocytes found in high concentrations in AIDS victims.

The disease, which is spreading rapidly, particularly
among gay men, has afflicted about 1500 people in the
past three years, about half in the New York area and 249
in the San Francisco Bay area.
The cause of AIDS is unknown, but researchers be
lieve it is transmitted primarily by a virus through the
blood of an AIDS sufferer.
Postdoctoral scholar )oe Dylewski, Chow and Thomas
Merigan, professor of medicine for infectious diseases,
have been doing direct research on AIDS for about a
year.
"We're trying to find out what their (AIDS sufferers)
immune responses are to the cytomegalo virus (which
attacks may AIDS victims)," Chow said.
But Stanford doesn't get many AIDS patients. "Stan
ford is not one of the big time places. Most go to New
York or Los Angeles. We're somewhat out of the main
stream of the traffic. But some get referred to us."
