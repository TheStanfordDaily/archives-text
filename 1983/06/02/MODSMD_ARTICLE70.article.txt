NUTRIENTS -are chemical sub
stances derived from food dur
ing the process of digestion.
The major nutrients-proteins,
carbohydrates and fats-are
needed by the body for growth,
repair, maintenance, and ener
gy. The amount of energy
supplied by a nutrient is
measured in calories. Fat in the
diet supplies almost double
the calories per ounce than
protein or carbohydrates.
BACKACHE-To help to avoid
backache, wear comfortable
shoes when standing or walk
ing. Maintain good posture.
When lifting-squat with knees
bent and back straight rather
than bending from the waist.
Rise slowly using leg muscles
and lift-not back.
DEPRESSION -in one form or
another, knows no age group.
One of the best treatments
for depression is exercise such
as walking, jogging or swim
ming. Don't stop your daily
routine. Talk to friends and
relatives who will give you
support, and seek individual
or group counseling.

DIZZINESS-means light head
edness or giddiness, and fre
quently occurs when you sud
denly stand up after sitting or
lying down. This usually is due
to delayed adjustment of the
circulatory system and changes
in posture. Try moving more
slowly from reclining to stand
ing position.
HEADACHE-is most often due
to stress, fatigue or emotional
distress. Since emotional factors
are usually involved, talk about
these stresses with family and
close friends. Identify problems
and try to take some action.
Eat properly, exercise and get
enough rest. A hot tub bath
offers a suprisingly effective
method of quick relief.
AEROBIC EXERCISE-refers
to forms of exericise which
are designed to strengthen
your heart and lungs. Examples
are jogging, swimming, cycling,
and running. With proper con
ditioning aerobic exercises al
low your heart and lungs to
utilize oxygen more efficiently.
SWIMMERS EAR-inflamma
tion of the ear canal-is really
a skin rash resulting from over
exposure and moisture or too

vigorous cleaning. Otitis ex
terna, as it is technically called, r
is usually treated with ear drops.
IMMUNIZATION FOR TRA-J
VEL-The immunizations need
ed by a given individual will
depend on three factors: desti
nation, official government re- J
quirements, and personal im
munization history. Since some $
immunizations must be given
over a period of months, and i
since some cannot be given in
combination, planning for im-ยง
munizations should begin many I
months before actual travel.
SUNSCREENS-The best sun
screens contain PABA, para-
amino benzoic acid. For op- ,
tional effectiveness apply sun
screens one or two hours
before exposure. Generously
re-apply, particularly after
sweating or swimming.
