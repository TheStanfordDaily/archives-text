It's not like any other kind of

The abortion rate among Stanford women var
ies substantially depending on who is doing the
talking.
According to a 1981 survey by Dr. |ohn Dor
man of Cowell Health Center, about 3 percent of
the women students will have an abortion while
they are at Stanford.
But an article in the Daily last February,
quoted Sociology Prof, lerry Talley as saying the
rate was closer to one in six (16 percent) women
would have an abortion. Although Talley admits
that his extrapolations could be significantly
flawed, the point remains that the figures are
not as low as Dorman's study indicates.

7 know I did the right thing, and I
know that they're trying to help,
but they're not very successful.'

"First," said Talley, "most universities report
rates of about 5 percent (from comparable
agencies to Cowell). Second, Cowell doesn't get
everybody. Many women go to private physi
cians. They may go to their doctor at home or a
local clinic off campus. I think most of them are
afraid that going to Cowell may jeopardize their
anonymity. Thus, the figures onlv reflect those
women who go to Cowell."
Talley indicated that the actual number was at
least two or three times what the study indi
cated, and could go as high as 20 percent. How
ever, "It is not the absolute number we should
be worrying about. It is the fact that intelligent
people, who have resources (birth control)

available, are still getting pregnant.' he said.
For most Stanford women who become preg
nant. abortion is the primary option. The rea
sons may vary in explanations, but thev boil
down to necessity For most Stanford women
having a child is not something they want or can
do at this time.
Connie Starr, a nurse practitioner at Cowell
since 1970, said, "The majority of women I see
choose abortion because the\ have other goals
at this point. They are trying to build their lives
and having a child is not a realistic option for
them."
One Stanford woman explained her situation
and why she chose to have an abortion.
"After I got over the initial shock, I just wanted
to have the abortion as soon as I could and
forget about it," she said.
"I went back to the doctor to ask him where I
should go for the operation. He asked me if I
had thought over what I was going to do, if I had
considered all the options. His question slapped
me in the face."
She responded with contusion. I cried that
night. I knew that having the abortion was the
best thing for me, but I felt like I was being
selfish. I finally came to the conclusion that I
couldn t have a child and be able to form the
kind of life I wanted for myself."
I know it sounds simplistic and selfish, but it
was necessary, I didn't think that I could have a
child and be able to care for it the way a parent
should," she said.
If a student has a pregnancy test at Cowell and
the result is positive, she will automatically re
ceive some counseling from the doctor or nurse
practitioner who has attended to her.
"I trv to get them to think about all the op
tions, said Dorman. "They can have the abor
tion or carry the child to term. If they carry it to
term then there is always adoption or keeping
the child."
I encourage her to share her leelings with
someone. Whether that's their parents, a close
friend or their boyfriend, I think it makes it
easier for them," said Starr.
"I do a lot more counseling than I used to. A
few years ago we would send everyone to CAPS
(Counseling and Psychological Services). But in
the last few years the doctors and nurse prac
titioners have been doing more counseling,"
said Dorman.
Chariot Siegel, a counselor with CAPS, ex
plained, We ve been doing less (counseling)
than in years before. I think that the doctors and
nurses are well trained and able to help most of
the women who come through here. Certain
people are sent to us when they are feeling a lot
of conflict over whether to have the child or
not."
"I try to get them to go over all the positive
and negative feelings about what they want to
do. Many women need an outside, objective
individual to help them. Someone who can help
them to understand and sort out their feelings. I
don t try to impress any values on them, just try
to help them consider those values," said
Siegel.

7 know that having the abortion
was the best thing for me, bit I
felt like I was being selfish. I fi
nally came to the conclusion
that I couldn't have a child and
be able to form the kind of life I
wanted for myself/

Starr also indicated that she tries to make the
woman consider her present situation and not
what may happen later. "She must try to make
the decision for today. She can't make the deci
sion based on what may happen a year from
now. That makes the decision much harder."
One Stanford woman ended up telling her
boyfriend and some close friends, but not until
she had made her final decision.
"I just couldn't see him and keep it from him.
When I told him, he tried to be comforting and
understanding. He wasn't very successful, he
seemed to make me more nervous and almost
angry at him. When I look back I know I was a bit

unfairwith him, very few people can understand
what I was going through."
"I told a girlfriend and she helped a lot. She
talked to me and understood why I was going to
have the abortion. . . . She kept me from sliding
into a hole and being depressed. After the oper
ation she reassured me that I had made the right
decision," she said.
"I've told a couple of people since then. They
always seem to try to psychoanalyze me. They
think that helps. I know I did the right thing, and
I know that they're trying to help, but they're not
very successful," she said.
After a woman has decided to have an abor
tion, there are several places she may go to have
the operation. Cowell keeps a list of several
private physicians and clinics that perform abor
tions. A random sampling of these put the aver
age cost of an abortion at about $250.
"I went to a private doctor," explained the
student. "There were several forms I had to fill
out. After that the doctor explained what the
operation would entail. I tried to be calm and
listen to him, but I was so nervous I couldn't
remember anything he said except that it might
hurt a little bit."
"It's the scariest thing that's ever happened to
me. I didn't know what was going to hap
pen. . . . It's not like any other kind of opera
tion. People just don't talk about it."
"The procedure is basically a vacuum-like
process. It didn't hurt as much as I thought it
would but it was fairly painful. ... It didn't hurt
at all afterward," she said.
What has hurt most for her has been forget
ting. "I realize now that there is no way to forget.
I just try to put in the back of my mind and be
objective about the experience. It happened
and I'm still okay. It won't happen again." There
is a firm, almost angry, tone to her final words.
Starr noted that many women will come back
to her after a year and talk to her. "Some people
experience the same feelings a year later. Some
of the painful feelings will come back to them. I
try to act as a sounding board for these feel
ings."
"It is something that they have to live with. It is
a hard lesson that is well-learned," said Starr.

ies substantially depending on who is doing the
talking.
According to a 1981 survey by Dr. |ohn Dor
man of Cowell Health Center, about 3 percent of
the women students will have an abortion while
they are at Stanford.
But an article in the Daily last February,
quoted Sociology Prof, lerry Talley as saying the
rate was closer to one in six (16 percent) women
would have an abortion. Although Talley admits
that his extrapolations could be significantly
flawed, the point remains that the figures are
not as low as Dorman's study indicates.

7 know I did the right thing, and I
know that they're trying to help,
but they're not very successful.'

"First," said Talley, "most universities report
rates of about 5 percent (from comparable
agencies to Cowell). Second, Cowell doesn't get
everybody. Many women go to private physi
cians. They may go to their doctor at home or a
local clinic off campus. I think most of them are
afraid that going to Cowell may jeopardize their
anonymity. Thus, the figures onlv reflect those
women who go to Cowell."
Talley indicated that the actual number was at
least two or three times what the study indi
cated, and could go as high as 20 percent. How
ever, "It is not the absolute number we should
be worrying about. It is the fact that intelligent
people, who have resources (birth control)

available, are still getting pregnant.' he said.
For most Stanford women who become preg
nant. abortion is the primary option. The rea
sons may vary in explanations, but thev boil
down to necessity For most Stanford women
having a child is not something they want or can
do at this time.
Connie Starr, a nurse practitioner at Cowell
since 1970, said, "The majority of women I see
choose abortion because the\ have other goals
at this point. They are trying to build their lives
and having a child is not a realistic option for
them."
One Stanford woman explained her situation
and why she chose to have an abortion.
"After I got over the initial shock, I just wanted
to have the abortion as soon as I could and
forget about it," she said.
"I went back to the doctor to ask him where I
should go for the operation. He asked me if I
had thought over what I was going to do, if I had
considered all the options. His question slapped
me in the face."
She responded with contusion. I cried that
night. I knew that having the abortion was the
best thing for me, but I felt like I was being
selfish. I finally came to the conclusion that I
couldn t have a child and be able to form the
kind of life I wanted for myself."
I know it sounds simplistic and selfish, but it
was necessary, I didn't think that I could have a
child and be able to care for it the way a parent
should," she said.
If a student has a pregnancy test at Cowell and
the result is positive, she will automatically re
ceive some counseling from the doctor or nurse
practitioner who has attended to her.
"I trv to get them to think about all the op
tions, said Dorman. "They can have the abor
tion or carry the child to term. If they carry it to
term then there is always adoption or keeping
the child."
I encourage her to share her leelings with
someone. Whether that's their parents, a close
friend or their boyfriend, I think it makes it
easier for them," said Starr.
"I do a lot more counseling than I used to. A
few years ago we would send everyone to CAPS
(Counseling and Psychological Services). But in
the last few years the doctors and nurse prac
titioners have been doing more counseling,"
said Dorman.
Chariot Siegel, a counselor with CAPS, ex
plained, We ve been doing less (counseling)
than in years before. I think that the doctors and
nurses are well trained and able to help most of
the women who come through here. Certain
people are sent to us when they are feeling a lot
of conflict over whether to have the child or
not."
"I try to get them to go over all the positive
and negative feelings about what they want to
do. Many women need an outside, objective
individual to help them. Someone who can help
them to understand and sort out their feelings. I
don t try to impress any values on them, just try
to help them consider those values," said
Siegel.

7 know that having the abortion
was the best thing for me, bit I
felt like I was being selfish. I fi
nally came to the conclusion
that I couldn't have a child and
be able to form the kind of life I
wanted for myself/

Starr also indicated that she tries to make the
woman consider her present situation and not
what may happen later. "She must try to make
the decision for today. She can't make the deci
sion based on what may happen a year from
now. That makes the decision much harder."
One Stanford woman ended up telling her
boyfriend and some close friends, but not until
she had made her final decision.
"I just couldn't see him and keep it from him.
When I told him, he tried to be comforting and
understanding. He wasn't very successful, he
seemed to make me more nervous and almost
angry at him. When I look back I know I was a bit

unfairwith him, very few people can understand
what I was going through."
"I told a girlfriend and she helped a lot. She
talked to me and understood why I was going to
have the abortion. . . . She kept me from sliding
into a hole and being depressed. After the oper
ation she reassured me that I had made the right
decision," she said.
"I've told a couple of people since then. They
always seem to try to psychoanalyze me. They
think that helps. I know I did the right thing, and
I know that they're trying to help, but they're not
very successful," she said.
After a woman has decided to have an abor
tion, there are several places she may go to have
the operation. Cowell keeps a list of several
private physicians and clinics that perform abor
tions. A random sampling of these put the aver
age cost of an abortion at about $250.
"I went to a private doctor," explained the
student. "There were several forms I had to fill
out. After that the doctor explained what the
operation would entail. I tried to be calm and
listen to him, but I was so nervous I couldn't
remember anything he said except that it might
hurt a little bit."
"It's the scariest thing that's ever happened to
me. I didn't know what was going to hap
pen. . . . It's not like any other kind of opera
tion. People just don't talk about it."
"The procedure is basically a vacuum-like
process. It didn't hurt as much as I thought it
would but it was fairly painful. ... It didn't hurt
at all afterward," she said.
What has hurt most for her has been forget
ting. "I realize now that there is no way to forget.
I just try to put in the back of my mind and be
objective about the experience. It happened
and I'm still okay. It won't happen again." There
is a firm, almost angry, tone to her final words.
Starr noted that many women will come back
to her after a year and talk to her. "Some people
experience the same feelings a year later. Some
of the painful feelings will come back to them. I
try to act as a sounding board for these feel
ings."
"It is something that they have to live with. It is
a hard lesson that is well-learned," said Starr.
