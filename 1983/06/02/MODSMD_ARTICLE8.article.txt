## Unwanted pregnancies Why women seek abortions

'It's the scariest thing that's ever
happened to me. I didn't know
what was going to happen. . . .
It's not like any other kind of
operation. People just don't talk
about it/
- An anonymous
Stanford student

The abortion rate among Stanford women var
ies substantially depending on who is doing the
talking.
According to a 1981 survey by Dr. |ohn Dor
man of Cowell Health Center, about 3 percent of
the women students will have an abortion while
they are at Stanford.
But an article in the Daily last February,
quoted Sociology Prof, lerry Talley as saying the
rate was closer to one in six (16 percent) women
would have an abortion. Although Talley admits
that his extrapolations could be significantly
flawed, the point remains that the figures are
not as low as Dorman's study indicates.

7 know I did the right thing, and I
know that they're trying to help,
but they're not very successful.'

"First," said Talley, "most universities report
rates of about 5 percent (from comparable
agencies to Cowell). Second, Cowell doesn't get
everybody. Many women go to private physi
cians. They may go to their doctor at home or a
local clinic off campus. I think most of them are
afraid that going to Cowell may jeopardize their
anonymity. Thus, the figures onlv reflect those
women who go to Cowell."
Talley indicated that the actual number was at
least two or three times what the study indi
cated, and could go as high as 20 percent. How
ever, "It is not the absolute number we should
be worrying about. It is the fact that intelligent
people, who have resources (birth control)

available, are still getting pregnant.' he said.
For most Stanford women who become preg
nant. abortion is the primary option. The rea
sons may vary in explanations, but thev boil
down to necessity For most Stanford women
having a child is not something they want or can
do at this time.
Connie Starr, a nurse practitioner at Cowell
since 1970, said, "The majority of women I see
choose abortion because the\ have other goals
at this point. They are trying to build their lives
and having a child is not a realistic option for
them."
One Stanford woman explained her situation
and why she chose to have an abortion.
"After I got over the initial shock, I just wanted
to have the abortion as soon as I could and
forget about it," she said.
"I went back to the doctor to ask him where I
should go for the operation. He asked me if I
had thought over what I was going to do, if I had
considered all the options. His question slapped
me in the face."
She responded with contusion. I cried that
night. I knew that having the abortion was the
best thing for me, but I felt like I was being
selfish. I finally came to the conclusion that I
couldn t have a child and be able to form the
kind of life I wanted for myself."
I know it sounds simplistic and selfish, but it
was necessary, I didn't think that I could have a
child and be able to care for it the way a parent
should," she said.
If a student has a pregnancy test at Cowell and
the result is positive, she will automatically re
ceive some counseling from the doctor or nurse
practitioner who has attended to her.
"I trv to get them to think about all the op
tions, said Dorman. "They can have the abor
tion or carry the child to term. If they carry it to
term then there is always adoption or keeping
the child."
I encourage her to share her leelings with
someone. Whether that's their parents, a close
friend or their boyfriend, I think it makes it
easier for them," said Starr.
"I do a lot more counseling than I used to. A
few years ago we would send everyone to CAPS
(Counseling and Psychological Services). But in
the last few years the doctors and nurse prac
titioners have been doing more counseling,"
said Dorman.
