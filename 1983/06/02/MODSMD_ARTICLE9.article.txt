## 
### MARC PEYSER 
The first step toward determining the
fate of the inner-quad was taken last Fri
day, as the Inner-Ouad Courtyard Advi
sory Committee held its first in a series of
public hearings in the History Corner.
Continuingthrough theend of june, the
"design analysis phase" is intended to
solicit and receive comments from
everyoni ho will be usingthe inner-quad
— and that means the community," ac
cording to Project Manager Max Mazenko.
"We don't expect 100 percent satisfaction,
but we want to be open to comments," he
added.
Mazenko stressed, however, that no
decisions have been made yet. "We want
to interpret the intentions established by
the original architect in context of today's
terms. The strong media coverage this

topic received seemed to simplify the is
sue. The issues regarding this, though, are
complex and subtle."
One of three students attending the
meeting, junior |im DeLaHunt stressed
that the committee and especially
Mazenko are "going out of their way to let
people know," but that "now is the time
for action. ' DeLaHunt, whose personal
interest is lighting tor plays and waltzes,
emphasized that the committee is eagerly
soliciting community concerns and pref
erences. "I am sending off my three pages
of recommendation," he added.
After this phase — public input — is
completed, the design architects will
examine the proposals and draw up new,
more realistic schematics. A new series of
hearings will be initiated, and the final
comments will then revert back to the

committee, comprised ot a member from
various university committees, including
public affairs, art and development and
planning, and two student committee
members. The ultimate recommendation,
expected by the first of the year, must then
be approved by the board of trustees and
the administration. "We want to temper
our tinal decision with thorough attention
•iiid s itivi'. to variety of things — be
yond personal preferences," remarked
Mazenko.
In addition to the public hearings, five
schematic drawings, designed by architect
Anthony Cuzzardo of San Francisco, will
be on public display in the Old Pavilion
during the summer. The drawings depict
population movement, drainage, vegeta
tion and a view analysis.
Construction on the $1 million project is
expected to begin in the summer of 1984.


FATEFUL DECISIONS: The future of the Inner Quad has not
yet been decided, although the Inner Quad Courtyard Advi
sory Committee had its first meeting on Friday. This meeting

was intended to be an open forum for discussion and not
