This is a house ad. Do you know what a house ad is? A
house ad is what Daily editors use when they don't have
enough copy to fill a space. We don't like house ads. Do
you know why we have to use house ads sometimes? We
have to use house ads because, sometimes, we don't
have enough writers or photographers or artists. That's
where you come in. You can help us to stamp out the
house ad by dropping by the Daily (we're in the Storke
Publications Building, right across from Terman En
gineering Center) and picking up a photo, story or
graphics assignment. The summer Daily begins Monday,
June 21. Don't be left out. Together we can stamp out the
house ad.
