"By the time he entered Stanford University as a freshman. Gil Morales begun
producing cartoons for a campus humor magazine. In September the strip
DUPIE began appearing in The Stanford Daily newspaper."
"All of the characters in DUPIE were based on friends and acquaintances e\en
the bird was derived from the bold little feathered creatures who inhabit Stanford's
White Plaza and freely mingle with the students, unafraid of sharing a bench, table, or
donut. DUPIE quickly became a popular campus feature and found its way into many
other campus publications and onto T-shirt designs for campus groups."
DUPIE's adventures at STANFORD are now published nation-wide by Ballan
tinc Books, a division of Random House. Here is your opportunity to share a "touch
of Stanford" with your friends and family or perhaps keep as a souvenir for yourself.
DUPIE makes even the gloomiest day enjoyable; he loves to share his humor.
