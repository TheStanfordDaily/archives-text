# The 						truth about the Hammer and Coffin
## 
### 
Not all of you may want to do
heavy reading at a time like
this. So wait a couple of mi
nutes. Bio and econ majors, by
all means feel free to skip this
article and move onto the one
about shapely blonde entrep
reneurs at Stanford (p. 18). (I'm
not getting paid for this article,
so I won't even feel bitter.)
0.K.; now that we've elimi
nated at least three-quarters of
the undergraduate population
at Stanford, let's get down to
business, shall we?
Golly! It seems like only four
years ago that I was a just
another freshman with a bril
liant future ahead of me
and. . .(Whoops, sorry, high
school valedictory speech.)
Golly! It seems like only a year
ago that I became a member of
that most sacred of University
institutions, the Hammer &
Coffin Society, and am going
on to join the ranks of "What,
Me Worry?" International Re
lations graduates.

Perhaps some of you have
heard of the H&C in connec
tion with that quarterly publi
cation, the Chaparral. Actually,
the Chaparral is merely the
cover for, not the content of,
that wacky organization which
brings mirth and good times to
ASSU Senate meetings in par
ticular and four-fingered ro
dents to the public in general.
Until a year ago last spring, I
didn't even know this much. I
knew nothing of the H&C and
only vaguely connected the
Chaparral with obnoxious little
people harrassing passerbys in
White Plaza. (Once, I saw an
E.E. grad student mercilessly
brought to his knees by a pack
of those Chappieshysters. One
of them greedily rummaged
through the downed man's
pockets, triumphantly pulling
out a dollar bill, then shoving
the used engineer aside to
scamper on to the next victim.)
It was to avoid such callous
treatment that I first stepped

foot in the Chappie office. It
was self-defense, really, telling
the over-zealous critter that I
was a staffer whom he had
overlooked in the semi-dark
confusion of the last Chaparral
meeting. No sooner was this
horrendous and magnificently
ill-conceived lie out of my
mouth, than a heavy hand of
brotherly recognition slam
med upon my back.
—"Great! I remember you
now, uh (sincere smile, heroic
effort of memory), uh. .
—"Eleanor."
—"Whatever. See you at the

meeting on Wednesday."Oh
I had only hung around the
Chappie office for a couple of
issues (read, "quarters"), when
I learned the true secret of the
H&C. It came in the form of a
poorly spelled, kind of grimy
letter, strongly suggesting that,
for my health's sake, I be found
blindfolded and sitting on my
bed, Friday next.
Since the H&C is a secret soc
iety, I can't give you the details
of the initiation process. You
probably wouldn't be in
terested in gruesome tales of
shivering hours spent glued to
frozen blocks of ice or the
chainlink fence near the
"Citadel of Terror" anyway.
But, next time you see some
haggard initiate dragging a
sledgehammer around cam
pus, rememberto comment on
his sniveling, poor, wretched,
weak, neophyte-type de
meanor. He'll know what you
mean, and will respect you for
it.

Twelve months is almost too
long a time to put up with my
fellow H&Cers. Fortunately, as
the hand of time has swept full
circle, I too have been able to
participate in the induction, in
struction and torvous staring
down of young neophytes. As I
get ready to graduate, my only
regret is that I leave the ranks
of active members ("actives")
to join that Hell-raising group
of wiser and better-looking
members enviously known as
"Old Farts."
There has been a purpose to
these revelations. The spirit of
the H&C, like it or not, lives in
almost all Stanford students.
(Yes, Berkeley transfers
count.) We wish all of you suc
cess and good fortune com
mensurate to, but not surpas
sing, our own. Curse? Bles
sing? You decide. Hi-ho &
cheers! And so it goes.
