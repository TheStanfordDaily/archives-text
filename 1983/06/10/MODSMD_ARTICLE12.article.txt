# A 						societal black-hole... but with no regrets
## 
### 
Vawahoo! I think I'm
graduating. I'm not exactly sure
because I've had a hold on
every PTR I've ever had, even
the first one.
"How the hell can I have a
hold? I just got here. Give me a
chance to deserve a hold."
"We've heard about you. We
know who you are and what
you do and we don't like it."
My relationship with the
administration steadily de
clined from that pinnacle of
mutual respect. Fred must
have had several dangerous
controlled substances cours
ing through his veins when on
that fateful day he smiled on
my hideous mug and threw it in
the IN box when it deserved
the circular file.

My salute goes out to our
boys in beige, the Stanford
Police Deparment. I feel like
I've had a standing A.P.B. on
me for the past four years.
Maybe they just like me. I think
skateboard hijacking is the
only thing I haven't been
hauled in for (they just haven't
caught me). Sitting atop the
Dish the other night, I decided
to continue my life of crime —
going where I'm not supposed
to be, taking what I'm not sup
posed to take, what can I say,
I'm ugly and my mother dres
ses me funny.
Basically, time is irrelevant. If
I wore a watch, it would just
remind me that I'm going to be
late for the Goose. In the event
that you're rather slow (Chi or
E) I'll spell it out: I A-M A
D-E-R-E-L-l-C-T. I hurt people
and things with my ped, drink
way too much and sleep con
stantly. God, I'm in love with
my lifestyle.
I serve no purpose to the
society at large and will most
likely go right on being incred
ibly happy. There is something
fundamentally right about the
Universe. My advice to me is to
continue drinking heavily.
• Pre-meds?—99 44/100 per
cent of them should be vap
orized.

• Norm?—ith a dilemma.
• Zetes?—lmmortal.
• Heloise?—Had a crush on
her for years.
• Worst night mare?-
-Remembering the one time I
went to the library.
• Stanford women!—No
comment.
What have I done here? I
don't really remember actually
taking any classes. I climbed
the structure and then found
some good random stuff. I
saw the Hill of Africa and was
given a name by Bob himself.
Some call me Bongos, some
call me Koe-Chiess, some call
me O'Zete, you can call me on
the phone, jerry doesn't live
here anymore, Mrs. Torrance.
Vup, Happy's over here. I've
caught the infinite buzz and
dealt. I was definitely here all
right. Red P. and I specialized
in unnatural acts in the Band
and got away with it all. My
motto: Goeth for it.
Edna was my mom away from
home. She made finger jello
(easier to re-use). I told my
freshman RA I wanted a corner
room so that I could study. I
know, get serious. Somehow, I
slipped into grad school —
ninth wonder of the world. I've
got thousands of pictures and
chances are I've got negatives

of you that will keep you out of
the White House. The High
Cook says that since my name
is Pat I can't have any dinner.
I'll whip up a fungal unit
omelette. Bart O.J. and the
Circle of Drums all in one day.
I'll never be the same. Take me
to the river. I've always
wandered aimlessly. If you're
going to survive and succeed
on this whirling orb, direction
is one thing you can't afford to
have. Just remember, big buz
zes come in little bottles. This is
a good thing. If you think this
has no inherent continuity to
it, think about it — it's incredi
bly appropriate.
Science
We're the boys of Rinc Three
and we say. . .whoops, this is a
family newspaper. Young
Ones, may the buzz be with
you. I'm going to go to my
favorite place. The Legend
continues and will live forever.
Stanford has taught me one
thing:
It Just Doesn't Matter.

Circle of Drums all in one day.
I'll never be the same. Take me
to the river. I've always
wandered aimlessly. If you're
going to survive and succeed
on this whirling orb, direction
is one thing you can't afford to
have. Just remember, big buz
zes come in little bottles. This is
a good thing. If you think this
has no inherent continuity to
it, think about it — it's incredi
bly appropriate.

We're the boys of Rinc Three
and we say. . .whoops, this is a
family newspaper. Young
Ones, may the buzz be with
you. I'm going to go to my
favorite place. The Legend
continues and will live forever.
Stanford has taught me one
thing:
It Just Doesn't Matter.

a bachelor of arts degree in

Vawahoo! I think I'm
graduating. I'm not exactly sure
because I've had a hold on
every PTR I've ever had, even
the first one.
"How the hell can I have a
hold? I just got here. Give me a
chance to deserve a hold."
"We've heard about you. We
know who you are and what
you do and we don't like it."
My relationship with the
administration steadily de
clined from that pinnacle of
mutual respect. Fred must
have had several dangerous
controlled substances cours
ing through his veins when on
that fateful day he smiled on
my hideous mug and threw it in
the IN box when it deserved
the circular file.

My salute goes out to our
boys in beige, the Stanford
Police Deparment. I feel like
I've had a standing A.P.B. on
me for the past four years.
Maybe they just like me. I think
skateboard hijacking is the
only thing I haven't been
hauled in for (they just haven't
caught me). Sitting atop the
Dish the other night, I decided
to continue my life of crime —
going where I'm not supposed
to be, taking what I'm not sup
posed to take, what can I say,
I'm ugly and my mother dres
ses me funny.
Basically, time is irrelevant. If
I wore a watch, it would just
remind me that I'm going to be
late for the Goose. In the event
that you're rather slow (Chi or
E) I'll spell it out: I A-M A
D-E-R-E-L-l-C-T. I hurt people
and things with my ped, drink
way too much and sleep con
stantly. God, I'm in love with
my lifestyle.
I serve no purpose to the
society at large and will most
likely go right on being incred
ibly happy. There is something
fundamentally right about the
Universe. My advice to me is to
continue drinking heavily.
• Pre-meds?—99 44/100 per
cent of them should be vap
orized.

• Norm?—ith a dilemma.
• Zetes?—lmmortal.
• Heloise?—Had a crush on
her for years.
• Worst night mare?-
-Remembering the one time I
went to the library.
• Stanford women!—No
comment.
What have I done here? I
don't really remember actually
taking any classes. I climbed
the structure and then found
some good random stuff. I
saw the Hill of Africa and was
given a name by Bob himself.
Some call me Bongos, some
call me Koe-Chiess, some call
me O'Zete, you can call me on
the phone, jerry doesn't live
here anymore, Mrs. Torrance.
Vup, Happy's over here. I've
caught the infinite buzz and
dealt. I was definitely here all
right. Red P. and I specialized
in unnatural acts in the Band
and got away with it all. My
motto: Goeth for it.
Edna was my mom away from
home. She made finger jello
(easier to re-use). I told my
freshman RA I wanted a corner
room so that I could study. I
know, get serious. Somehow, I
slipped into grad school —
ninth wonder of the world. I've
got thousands of pictures and
chances are I've got negatives

of you that will keep you out of
the White House. The High
Cook says that since my name
is Pat I can't have any dinner.
I'll whip up a fungal unit
omelette. Bart O.J. and the
Circle of Drums all in one day.
