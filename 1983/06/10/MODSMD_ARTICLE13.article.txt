# YEAR IN RETROSPECT
## Stanford '83: Big Game and the Queen 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
It was, you might say, a big
news year for Stanford.
A strike, a salvo of campus
crimes, a bad call and broken
trombone in a questionable
Big Game, weather which
threatened to wash the campus
away, a grad student expelled,
a Queen and a Prince wel
comed, the Hoover Institution
questioned — both local
stories and issues of national
significance kept the Univer
sity community from a reclu
siveness during the 1982-83
school year.
The strike
Students arrived on campus
in late September unsure
whether school was indeed
going to start on schedule due
to a walk-out by campus work
ers.
University efforts to re
negotiate a contract with Unit
ed Stanford Workers (USW)
had failed two weeks earlier,
and campus maintenance
workers had walked out for
raises and better benefits. Due
to the two week lead time
before registration, the admin
istration was able to start
school on schedule, but with
browning lawns, accumulating
trash and curtailed food ser
vice.
The strike lingered on for
four weeks — with the union
and the University locked in a

stalemate and students' initial
concern glazing over into an
noyed indifference. The Uni
versity was accused of trying to
"starve out" the union" and
the union accused of an ill-ad
vised protest as the picket lines
degenerated into isolated acts
of tire-slashing and vandalism.
Some professors claimed that
the hard tactics used by the
University were unbecoming
to an academic community,
but attemptsat rapprochement
between the University and the
union repeatedly failed.
After a month of aggravation
and controversy — the trash
piles higher and the lawns
much browner — the two
groups began to negotiate
again. The union finally settled
for nominal gains in benefits
and the campus settled down
for business as usual.
The USW effort to organize
Stanford Hospital workers
failed the next month.
An ivory tower?
As seems to happen every
year, students return in the fall
happy to enjoy the rural at
mosphere of the Farm and
temporarily oblivious to the
fact that the University is lo
cated in a metropolitan area.
Then something brings us back
to earth.
This year it was a murder.
