# YEAR IN RETROSPECT
## Stanford '83: Big Game and the Queen 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
It was, you might say, a big
news year for Stanford.
A strike, a salvo of campus
crimes, a bad call and broken
trombone in a questionable
Big Game, weather which
threatened to wash the campus
away, a grad student expelled,
a Queen and a Prince wel
comed, the Hoover Institution
questioned — both local
stories and issues of national
significance kept the Univer
sity community from a reclu
siveness during the 1982-83
school year.
The strike
Students arrived on campus
in late September unsure
whether school was indeed
going to start on schedule due
to a walk-out by campus work
ers.
University efforts to re
negotiate a contract with Unit
ed Stanford Workers (USW)
had failed two weeks earlier,
and campus maintenance
workers had walked out for
raises and better benefits. Due
to the two week lead time
before registration, the admin
istration was able to start
school on schedule, but with
browning lawns, accumulating
trash and curtailed food ser
vice.
The strike lingered on for
four weeks — with the union
and the University locked in a

stalemate and students' initial
concern glazing over into an
noyed indifference. The Uni
versity was accused of trying to
"starve out" the union" and
the union accused of an ill-ad
vised protest as the picket lines
degenerated into isolated acts
of tire-slashing and vandalism.
Some professors claimed that
the hard tactics used by the
University were unbecoming
to an academic community,
but attemptsat rapprochement
between the University and the
union repeatedly failed.
After a month of aggravation
and controversy — the trash
piles higher and the lawns
much browner — the two
groups began to negotiate
again. The union finally settled
for nominal gains in benefits
and the campus settled down
for business as usual.
The USW effort to organize
Stanford Hospital workers
failed the next month.
An ivory tower?
As seems to happen every
year, students return in the fall
happy to enjoy the rural at
mosphere of the Farm and
temporarily oblivious to the
fact that the University is lo
cated in a metropolitan area.
Then something brings us back
to earth.
This year it was a murder.

house of Medical School Prof.
Lawrence Kedes in the "faculty
ghetto" area of Frenchman's
Hill, junior Angela Arvidson
was stabbed several times in
the chest and abdomen. She
died just as Kedes' son came
home from school to find her
sprawled in the living room.
The police traced the killing
to Donald John Amos, a San
Jose delivery man who was rec
orded to have been scheduled
to deliver garbage bags to the
Kedes' home on the afternoon
of the killing A receipt for the
bags was found in the Kedes'
driveway, and blood stained
clothes were later found in
Amos' San Jose apartment.
Amos, however, disappeared
for several weeks, frustrating
the authorities' nation-wide
search until turning himself in
saying, "Hi, I'm John Amos, I
hear you're looking for me."
Amos was later tried and
convicted for second degree

murder.
Big Game
Depending on whom you
talk to, Big Game, the annual
contest between Stanford and
the University of California at
Berkeley was either a coup or a
con-game similiar to that
pulled by O'Connor-the-cat
burglar.
In typical Stanford style, the
game was a cliff-hanger with
Stanford barely trailing until
the last quarter. The Stanford
squad brought the score to
20-19 in the last seconds of the
game and, as the players lined
up for the last kick-off with less
than ten seconds left, the Stan
ford crowd was busy rejoicing
to the strains of All Right Now
Then the unbelievable hap
pened.
Stanford kicked off and Cal
started going with the ball, a
tackle, a lateral, a tackle, a lat
eral, a tackle, a lateral until.. .

WAIT! — Cal player Kevin
Moen just rammed into a Stan
ford band trombonist to score
for Cal. 20-25?! The Cal play
was shown over and over on
sportscasts, written up in
countless columns, talked
about for weeks. This, accord
ing to Cal coach Joe Kapp, was
"60-minute football."
According to a group of
Stanford Daily staffers, it was
unfair. Three days after the
game, the Da//y distributed fac
similes of The Daily Californi
an disguised as special "extras"
saying that the NCAA had re
versed the officials' call, declar
ing the play dead before the
score and bringing the score
back to 20-19. It was a good
laugh and the prank upset
some Cal students but Stanford
didn't get the Big Game axe
back. A steel screw hangs in the
case which displays the axe
when it is at Stanford.


Donald Amos faces the judge at his preliminary hearing.
The weather
With the Big Game loss to Cal
in November, winter closed in
on the University, and it didn't
let up until late April.
Defying the usually tem
perate weather pattern, storm
system after storm system
slammed into the California
coast. As the ground became
soaked, the hills around cam
pus became streaked with mud
slides. The water in Lake Lag
rose; dorms flooded; power
went out. Winds got so strong
that trees all over campus
snapped, one falling and
smashing a car in the Tresidder
Union parking lot.
Though the weather was
cause for complaint as things
mildewed and duck shoes on a
thousand feet sloshed around
campus, the rain could be fun
at times. During particularly se
vere storms, students took row
boats outon Roble field and
once the water got so high that
residents of the new student
housing were able to play a

game of water polo on the walk
outside their dorm.
Construction
Rain or shine, the building
went on. The University is con
stantly in the process of ren
novation of the old and con
struction of the new. The '82-
'83 school year was no dif
ferent.
Work on the Braun Music
Center has been going on since
the beginning of the school
year and is still continuing. Lo
cated at the west end of White
Plaza between the Post Office
and Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
the center will house practice
rooms, offices and an
auditorium.
As work has been completed
on each stage of the new stu
dent housing on Lake Lagunita,
students have moved into the
Independent Houses and the
Suites. The last stage, Sterling
Quad, will be completed in the
summer and ready for students
by the fall.

munications Building in the

The Stephen Mosher case
His field research in an
thropology was the first to
come out of China since the
Communist Revolution, his
articles on abortion in China
were controversial, his aca
demic credentials impressive
but his ethics questionable. In
February, a committee of 12
voted toexpell Ph.D. candidate
Stephen Mosher for "illegal
and unethical behavior" while
doing research in China.
The exact reasons for
Mosher's expulsion have never
been released despite the na
tionwide controversy and press
attention inspired by the de
cision. University officials say

that release of the details
would harm innocent people,
and though Mosher has re
peatedly 1 censured the Univer
sity for distorting the details, he
has not released the details
either.
The decision sparked a na

spurred by pressu r e from

I unch with i queen
It was a very special day, a
day of British flags and bunting,
of Secret Service agents and

crowds craning to catch a
glimpse, of rarified company at
the Hoover House and antics
by the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band. It
was the day Queen Elizabeth II
of England and Prince Philip,
the Duke of Edinburgh came to
dine with University President
Donald Kennedy, Jeane Ken
nedy and 116 lucky guests.
For the royal couple it was a
welcome relaxed interlude in a
busy, rainy tour of the West
Coast but for the Stanford
community it was a major
event. In the weeks before the
invitations were sent out, stu
dents vied for places on the
guest list with ever-increasing
zaniness. Two freshman de
livered an "English" breakfast
of croissants and Earl Grey Tea
to Hoover House, the Kennedy
residence. Another student
sent a cake to the President's
office with "God Save Donald
Kennedy" written on it. Letters
poured into the President's of
fice.
The guest list that finally re-

suited was a judicious mix of
the Stanford community —
Rhodes scholars, adminis
trators, British citizens, admin
istrators, professors, staff —
and, according to those who at
tended, the lunch was a tre
mendous success.
McCloskey as teacher
Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey
I — who ran against Richard Nix
on in the 1968 primaries and is
known for his "get tough with
Israel" stance — has long been
a controversial figure known
for going out on a limb and his
tenure at Stanford continued

the tradition.
Teaching a class in Con
gressional Decision Making,
McCloskey held office hours in
the bleachers at Angell Field
during Friday afternoon
baseball games and made his
political views explicitly
known.
McCloskey also accused
ASSU Guest Professorship
Board Director Seth Linfield of
"reverse anti-Semitism" for
trying to censor his reading list,
mismanaging the publicity for
the course and failing to print
enough syllabi.
This accusation gave rise to a
heated conflict over academic
freedom, ASSU's management
of the guest professorship and
McCloskey's qualifications as a
teacher. The accusations flew

and the newsprint on the con
troversy accumulated but no
final resolution has yet been
reached. Inspired by the con
flict, an inquiry into academic
freedom has been com
missioned but the results are
not yet available.
Petitions
Stanford in the '80s is not
known for its activism, but
spring quarter brought a bar
rage of protests, petition and
counter-petitions.
The most controversial
target was the Hoover Institu
tion. A series of articles in the

Daily about Hoover's ties to the
conservative establishment in
Washington gave rise to ques
tions about tne academic inde
pendence of the Institution
and the issue of academic free
dom. A group of professors
circulated a petition calling for
an inquiry into the Institution's
relationship to the University
which spurred another group
of professors to circulate a peti
tion saying such an inquiry was
really unneccessary.
The issue inspired various
protests and received national
attention. Kennedy has com
missioned an inquiry into the

Institution's ties to the Univer
sity and to Washington.
There has also been substan
tial debate over the prospect of
Department of Defense
funded laser research at the
Stanford Synchrotron Labora
tory. Students, led by ASSU
Senator Jon Adelstein, claim
that such research would have
applications to classified de
fense research and hence
would violate the University
policy of not accepting classi
fied research projects. The
University administration says
censoring such research would
violate academic freedom.
