# SENIOR TIME CAPSULE
## Class of 1983 to bury memorabilia 
### KATHY BODOVITZ 
When the class of '83 time
capsule is covered on Saturday
by an "83" class plaque, re
minders of thisyear's Big Game
fiasco, the royal visit and popu
lar fads will be sealed away.
The time capsule, containing
approximately 60 items that
typify the senior class and the
1982-83 school year, is not
scheduled to be unearthed
until 2083.
No one knows exactly when
the idea of putting time cap
sules beneath the class plaques
began, but the class of 1896 was
the first to place a plaque in the
Quad. That year Ray Lyman
Wilbur, who later became
president of the University,
and his classmates set a plaque
with "96" on it in the walkway
in front of Memorial church.
Later the class of 1895 — the
first class to complete all four
years at Stanford — returned
and dedicated a plaque of its
own.
Accord : ng to University Ar
chivist Roxanne Nilan, the class
of '96 did not originate the idea
of burying objects under-

ground. She said Jane Stanford
liked to bury significant items
— a Bible or papers relevant to
a building's construction —
under cornerstones of campus
buildings.
Since then the buria! of
momentos has become a tradi
tion. The contents of this year's
time capsule were assembled
by the senior class presidents
and sealed in a 15x15x5-inch
steel box by the University
metal shop. Senior Class Presi
dent Katie Dore described the
contents of the capsule as "a
mix of fun little things and
things we used to try to make a
statement. It was really fun put
ting it all together. We just sat
down and talked about what
went on this year." Dore said
the presidents also took
suggestions from other seniors
at the bi-weekly senior core
meetings.
According to recent tradi
tion, the time capsule is buried
in the inner Quad on Saturday
morning after the Bac
calaureate ceremony. Dore
said that during the capsule
dedication speeches by Vice
President and Provost Al Has
torf and Senior Class President
Joe Del Hierro, seniors are in
vited to toss their Stanford
I.D.sand meal cards into the
hole. Then the capsule will be
lowered in and the plaque,
which Dore said cost $1400, set
on top.
Dore said tradition requires
the capsules to remain buried
for 100 years. However she ex
pressed understandable con
cern that not everyone will be

able to attend the class's 100-
year reunion, and said she
would like to see the capsule
opened sooner.
Among the 60 items chosen
to commemorate this year are:
a vial of rain water, a phony
issue of the Daily Cal claiming
that Stanford won the Big
Game, a plastic Pacman and a
plastic "E.T.," a photograph of
University President Donald
