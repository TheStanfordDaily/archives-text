### KAREN SPRINGEN 
About 22 percent of the
graduating seniors this year
are happy they're in the mi
nority.
These students graduated
with distinction, a Univer
sity honor which is recom
mended by a student's de
partment or program.
Self-motivated students
who voluntarily partici
pated in a departmental
program and produced
a project or paper — usually
called an "honors thesis" —
could graduate with de
partmental honors.
Registrar Sally Mahoney
stressed that "not all stu
dents who participate in a
program graduate with de
partmental honors." To be
eligible for departmental
honors, a student "has to
submit a work that the de
partment considers hon
orable," Mahoney said.
The Committee on Aca
demic Appraisal and
Achievement is formally re

sponsible for evaluating de
partmental recommenda
tions. Seven faculty mem
bers and two students are
on the committee, accord
ing to Mahoney.
"The committee does not
review individual records,"
she added.
According to University
policy, up to 25 percent of a
total class may graduate
with honors.
For the past several years,
Mahoney said, the total
number has been "hovering
about 22 percent." Some
departments, particularly
small ones, may have a
higher percentage gradu
ating with distinction than
others, Mahoney said.
Prior to 1975, however,
students could graduate
with distinction or with
great distinction. About 15
percent graduated with dis
tinction and 5 percent grad
uated with great distinction,
Mahoney said.
