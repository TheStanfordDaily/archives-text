## Chef Chu's: Treat a grad to big night banquet 
### ANGELA HORINE 
CHEF CHU'S
1067 N. San Antonio Rd.
4ns Altos
948-2696
I Occupying a corner on El
tamino Real and San Antonio
Road in Los Altos, Chef Chu's
lestaurant has thrived since its
fcpening in 1969. According to
pwner and chef de cuisine,
Larry Chu, the popular restau
rant has been enlarged five
Rimes to accommodate the
growing number of eager pa
trons.
The restaurant is usually
quite crowded, especially dur
ing weekday lunch hours and
Friday and Saturday dinner
hours. Although the waiting
area is small and sparsely fur
nished, there is a wonderful
window through which pa
trons can watch a dozen chefs
preparing woksful of wonder
ful Chinese food. The walls are
adorned with interesting pho
tographs, reviews, historical
data regarding the restaurant,
menus and a list of daily spe
cials. There are also notices of
cooking classes that Chef Chu
conducts and of special ten to
twelve course gourmet ban
quets.
The restaurant consists of
several rooms, each different
form the others and attesting
to the five stages of expansion.
Each room is somewhat clut

tered and crowded. The crowd
is noisy, and I think at ease and
enjoying the food, even
though the general atmos
phere leaves something to be
desired.
The food is varied with Szec
huan, Mandarin, Hunan and
Cantonese dishes on the
menu. Even though most of the
offerings are good, many are
not great. I have discovered,
however, some exceptional
dishes that I enthusiastically
recommend. You can't go
wrong on the appetizers. They
are not very expensive and
they are all very good. The Kuo
Teh (potstickers) are wonder
ful and the Mandarin Tidbits
plate is an excellent order if
you want to try several ap
petizers.
Recently I had dinner at Chef
Chu's with eight friends. We
had a feast for approximately
$9 per person. We ordered a la
carte with several items from
the gourmet menu and with
one item from the daily spe
cials. We started out with two
orders of kuo teh and an order
of won tons and a Mandarin
Tidbit plate. Then we were
served a crisp Chinese chicken
salad, which was thoroughly en
joyed. We also got a big bowl
of steamed white rice. Next
came Mu Shu Pork, which is
sort of a make-your-own
sandwich. First you put a

square of thin "pancake" on
your plate. Next you brush
hoisin sauce onto the "pan
cake'' with a scallion
"paintbrush." Next, putoneor
two spoonsful of the stir fried
filling on top of this, add the
scallion, roll up like a crepe,
and eat!
The next course was crispy
shrimp balls in a bird's nest.
This dish got raves and disap
peared in minutes, including
the delicate fried potato
"nest." Minced pork with let
tuce leaf cups was the next
item, and it was devoured with
equal gusto. The minced pork
had been stir fried with water
chestnuts and other vegetables
and spices, all finely minced.
The whole dish was topped
with a generous amount of
diced peanuts and served with
crisp whole lettuce leaves. The
minced pork, which was spicy,
was eaten in the lettuce cups,
like a taco, and the difference
in textures and contrast of hot
and cool was delightful.
Lover's prawns, a platter of
prawns prepared in two
different ways, is served with
each different dish side by
side, divided by slices of fresh
tomato. Half the prawns are
sauteed in a wine sauce and are
very mild. The other half is
prepared with tomato sauce,
chili paste and garlic and is
spicy. This dish, like the

minced pork in the lettuce leaf
cups, was especially good be
cause of its contrasting and
complementing characteris
tics.
For our final dish we enjoyed
the Pekingduckwith Mandarin
pancakes. This is an excellent
dish, which Chef Chu prepares
with a time-consuming and
unusual process. It isoneof his
specialties, and we concur, it is
a duck dish well done! How
ever, if I were ordering a feast
again, I might not order both
Peking duck and mu shu pork
at the same meal, because they
are served in a similar manner,
with meat on a roll or pancake
brushed with hoisin sauce.
Recommended as an addition
al dish is the mild lemon
chicken. Whole chicken
breasts are dipped in a special
batter, deep-fried until crunchy
and glazed with lemon sauce. I
also recommend kung pao
chicken, which is diced
chicken sauteed with chili
peppers, bamboo shoots, and
water chestnuts in a hot and
spicy sauce. The dish is topped
with crunchy peanuts, and is
somewhat similar to the minced
pork with lettuce cups, but
minus the lettuce. The mongo
lian beef, slices of tender beef
sauteed with scallions and
ginger, is also delicious. The
hot and sour soup and the won
ton soup are excellent, but my

favorite is fish blossom soup.
Boiling hot, steaming chicken
broth full of vegetables is
brought to the table. A platter
full of raw white fish filets is
also brought to the table and
these filets are gently put on
top of the hot soup, and they
cook before your eyes. This
soup sometimes appears as a
daily special or can be specially
ordered.
Dinners are served with tea
and a fortune cookie for de
ssert. There are a few desserts
listed on the menu, but none is
exceptional.
If you order selectively and
are unafraid to try daily spe
cials,you will findthatdiningat
Chef Chu's is a unique experi
ence. The food is of good qual
ity, the preparation done with
finesse and expertise, and the
results delicious. Chef Larry
Chu is enthusiastic and per
sonable, and he often greets
guests and gladly makes menu
recommendations. He re
cently wrote a cookbook called
Chef Chu's Distinctive Cuisine
of China. He has copies of
these on hand which he is
happy to sell and autograph for
his customers. If you enjoy
creatively prepared and gas
tronomically pleasing Chinese
cuisine, don't miss dining at
Chef Chu's.

ACAPULCO'S
2515 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
323-8403
Only a year old, but the
Acapulco's margaritas are very
good, and the food is good,
too. The restaurant offers a Fri
day afternoon happy hour with

free nachos. Open every day,
offering lunch and dinner from
the same menu. Inexpensive-
Moderate (drinks are fairly
expensive.)
CHANTILLY
530 Ramona
Palo Alto
321-4080
Chantilly is that type of res
taurant you'd like to keep a
secret. The understated ele
gence of roses and pinks give
Chantilly an exclusive atmos
phere without the pretensions

of other top-flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imag
ination; sauteed veal and
eggplant, L'escalopine de veau
a la Bolognaise for two,
Chicken Cynthia with cham
pagne.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
rather than stifle the freshness
of Chantilly's dishes. The Lis
son Salad a la Chantilly for two,
with lettuce, cucumber, olive,
bacon, feta cheese and herbs,
and the Meddalions of Spring
Lamb, sauteed with fresh tara

gon, will both delight rather
than assault your palate.
CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9988
China Lion is the venture of
Samson C h u , Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger
brother. The menu lists 109
items, many of which are
Hunan style. Prices are lower
than Chef Chu's, but the por
tions are smaller. One is ad
vised to order an extra bowl of
rice. Service is attentive.
Kung Pao Beef consists of
tender beef slices and crisp
green peppers accented with
peanuts. Prawns in hot sauce,
tnougn tasty, are a cnallenge to
eat — the prawns are not shel
led.
CHEZ JUSTINE
625 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
328-8549
Chez Justine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargots, and oysters.
Pate Maison is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. En
trees come with soup dujour
and salad.
The menu features Abalone,
Long Island Duckling, and New
York Steak with green pepper
corns among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce are extremely tender,
but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
T ruite Plemondaise (fresh trout
with wine sauce) is outstand
ing.
For dessert, Strawberries
with ice cream, nuts and Grand
Marnier is a visual as well as a

taste treat.
Although better French res
taurants than Chez Justines
exist on the Peninsula, don't
miss the Sunday Champagne
Brunch, the incredible buffet is
already a legend in the bay
area. Many students here fast
for two days beforehand.
COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN
BARBEQUE
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
568-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cookery.
Their simple diet of thin-sliced
roasted meat was introduced
in China during the 13th cen
tury. The Chinese added veg
etables and other ingredients,
the cuisine became known as
the "Mongolian Barbeque."
Take a bowl and help your
self to frozen strips of turkey,
lamb, pork and beef. Fresh
vegetables, including shred
ded carrots, onions, celery,
cabbage, bean sprouts and
cilantro, are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque
sauces. Curry, sweet and sour,
lobster, spicy, mild, medium,
hot and extra hot are offered,
and you are encouraged to
create your own combination.
The atmosphere of Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighboor
hood cafes. The services are
courteous, and made some
what more charming by the
fact that no one spoke English
very well. Col. Lee's might just
be the ticket if you are looking
for something truly unusual.
THE DUTCH GOOSE
1567 Alameda de las Pugas
Menlo park
854-3245
The Goose joins the com
pany of Zots and the O as a
place to get beer and burgers.
Saturday nights are especially
tun there, as the estab
lishment seems entirely popu
lated by Stanford students.
There are peanut shells and
sawdust on the floor. The at
mosphere is reminiscent of
Pop's Malt Shop from Archie
Comics, after a crew of loggers
has rolled through, that is.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Avenue
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere in be
a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers
and candlelight and wine. Not
that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine, that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($l2 for
two; $6.50 for one) provide a
unique dinner alternative.
Dessert was the high point of
the meal. Cheesecake, as
sorted cakes and pastries (all
$1.60), various flavors of Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream ($1.25)
and Creme Caramel ($1.50)
easily triumph over your
calorific conscience.
The Gatehouse also has a

huge wooden bar with an
equally elegant, yet quiet at
mosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for
dinner from 5:30 p.m.; for
lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m.; and for Sunday Brunch
from 10 a.m. until 2:30 p.m.
HENRY'S
482 University Avenue
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are
priced between $5 and $8, and
come with a choice of
homemade soup or house
salad.
The house salad was crisp,
refreshing and served with a
chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on
a bed of freash spinach and
covered with a light wine
sauce. Perfectly cooked veget
ables and better-than-average
rice accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Aurich-style) is another sure
bet at Henry's. The real charac
ter of the ingredients,
moreover, is not masked by
heavy sauces. Both oversalting
and oversaucing are frequent
faults ot even the best hrencn
restaurants.
LA TERASSE
3740 El Camino
Palo Alto
494-0700
La Terasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his

policy of good food at reason
able prices.
The dinner includes soup du
jour and a pleasant butter let
tuce salad with a mustardy vin
aigrette dressing.
Ris de Veau Finan
ciere,(sweetbreads in cream),
are inconsistent. Some are
marvelous, but others, not
satisfactorily dismembraned,
are chewy and rubbery with a
stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate
mousse and Floating Isles" of
meringue.
MADDALENA'S
CONTINENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Maddalena's is a must for
any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside
Scampi Bordelaise. Our meals
were excellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine, ($6.25), Fettucine
alia Romana ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.50), we chose
Linguine Von.
Maddalena's offers salads a
la carte, such as spinach ($5.50
for two), mushroom ($5),
Caesar ($5.50 for two) and But
ter Lettuce with seafood
($4.95).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($9.95) and sole
Florentine with Shrimp ($10.50)
to Chicken Al Forno Arturo
($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
lust as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind

me of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifully
painted screens and chan
deliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.
thru Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to
2:30 p.m. and 6-10 p.m.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road
East Palo Alto
856-7700
One of the better Chinese
restaurants around, Ming's is a
popular banquet spot and if
you don't go there on your
own, you'll likely end up there
with your dorm, team or club
sooner or later. The good thing
is you can either have a moder
ate, simple dinner, or an elabo
rate meal which can get fairly
expensive. Ming's Beef is one
of their best recognized spe
cialties. Moderate — Expensive
Open daily.
MONTI'S SEAFOOD
RESTAURANT
Menlo Park
321-3724
From the outside, Monti's
Seafood Restaurant in Menlo
Park looks small and intimate.
The intimate part is right, but it
is by no means small. The
building itself contains three
elegantly furnished dining
rooms and a cocktail lounge.
Off to the side of the main
building is a fresh fish market,
which is open six days a week.
Monti's specializes in East
ern seafoods, which are im
ported to ensure freshness.
These include Maine lobster,
cherry stone clams, and blue
point oysters. Everything on
the menu is available in their
fish market. The menu is not

limited to Eastern seafood,
however. It is in fact quite ex
tensive, offering Continental
dinners in addition to their
wide variety of seafood.
Most of the fish offered on
the menu is breaded, sauteed
or poached, and served in rich
sauces (which hide not only
the true flavor of the fish, but
the bones as well).
The portions are pretty good
sized and are served with salad
or vegetables, and potatoes.
Monti's is open seven days a
week. Monday through Friday
they are open for lunch and
dinner; Saturday and Sunday
they serve only dinner. For
those interested in entertain
ment, Friday and Saturday they
have what Monti calls their
"sing-along" in the cocktail
lounge.
RAMONA'S
41 Ramona
Palo Alto
326-2220
Ramona's is just in down
town Palo Alto and mere min
utes away from Stanford by
bicycle. One of its best fea
tures is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh
vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and all
types of dressing.
Ramona's pizzas are 10, 14
and 16-inches in diameter. Piz
zas here are extremely filling, a
result of too much cheese and
an overly-thick and chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ous and if one likes tomato
sauce, request an extra por
tion. Although pizza prices are
high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, stromboli is
notable for its greaslessness.

ful and the Mandarin Tidbits
plate is an excellent order if
you want to try several ap

Recently I had dinner at Chef
Chu's with eight friends. We
had a feast for approximately
$9 per person. We ordered a la
carte with several items from
the gourmet menu and with
one item from the daily spe
cials. We started out with two
orders of kuo teh and an order
of won tons and a Mandarin
Tidbit plate. Then we were
served a crisp Chinese chicken
salad, which was thoroughly en

of steamed white rice. Next
came Mu Shu Pork, which is

For our final dish we enjoyed
the Pekingduckwith Mandarin
pancakes. This is an excellent
dish, which Chef Chu prepares
with a time-consuming and
unusual process. It isoneof his
specialties, and we concur, it is
a duck dish well done! How
ever, if I were ordering a feast
again, I might not order both
Peking duck and mu shu pork
at the same meal, because they
are served in a similar manner,
with meat on a roll or pancake
brushed with hoisin sauce.
Recommended as an addition
al dish is the mild lemon
chicken. Whole chicken
breasts are dipped in a special
batter, deep-fried until crunchy
and glazed with lemon sauce. I
also recommend kung pao
chicken, which is diced
chicken sauteed with chili
peppers, bamboo shoots, and
water chestnuts in a hot and
spicy sauce. The dish is topped
with crunchy peanuts, and is
somewhat similar to the minced
pork with lettuce cups, but
minus the lettuce. The mongo
lian beef, slices of tender beef
sauteed with scallions and
ginger, is also delicious. The
hot and sour soup and the won

favorite is fish blossom soup.
Boiling hot, steaming chicken

calorific conscience.
The Gatehouse also has a

huge wooden bar with an
equally elegant, yet quiet at
mosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for
dinner from 5:30 p.m.; for
lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30

from 10 a.m. until 2:30 p.m.
HENRY'S
482 University Avenue
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are
priced between $5 and $8, and
come with a choice of
homemade soup or house
salad.
The house salad was crisp,
refreshing and served with a
chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on
a bed of freash spinach and
covered with a light wine
sauce. Perfectly cooked veget
ables and better-than-average
rice accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Aurich-style) is another sure
bet at Henry's. The real charac
ter of the ingredients,
moreover, is not masked by
heavy sauces. Both oversalting
and oversaucing are frequent
faults ot even the best hrencn
restaurants.
LA TERASSE
3740 El Camino
Palo Alto
494-0700
La Terasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his

policy of good food at reason
able prices.
The dinner includes soup du
jour and a pleasant butter let
tuce salad with a mustardy vin
aigrette dressing.
Ris de Veau Finan
ciere,(sweetbreads in cream),
are inconsistent. Some are
marvelous, but others, not
satisfactorily dismembraned,
are chewy and rubbery with a
stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate
mousse and Floating Isles" of
meringue.
MADDALENA'S
CONTINENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Maddalena's is a must for
any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside
Scampi Bordelaise. Our meals
were excellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine, ($6.25), Fettucine
alia Romana ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.50), we chose
Linguine Von.
Maddalena's offers salads a
la carte, such as spinach ($5.50
for two), mushroom ($5),
Caesar ($5.50 for two) and But
ter Lettuce with seafood
($4.95).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($9.95) and sole
Florentine with Shrimp ($10.50)
to Chicken Al Forno Arturo
($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
lust as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind

me of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifully
painted screens and chan
deliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.
thru Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to
2:30 p.m. and 6-10 p.m.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road
East Palo Alto
856-7700
One of the better Chinese
restaurants around, Ming's is a
popular banquet spot and if
you don't go there on your
own, you'll likely end up there
with your dorm, team or club
sooner or later. The good thing
is you can either have a moder
ate, simple dinner, or an elabo
rate meal which can get fairly
expensive. Ming's Beef is one
of their best recognized spe
cialties. Moderate — Expensive
Open daily.
MONTI'S SEAFOOD
RESTAURANT
Menlo Park
321-3724
From the outside, Monti's
Seafood Restaurant in Menlo
Park looks small and intimate.
The intimate part is right, but it
is by no means small. The
building itself contains three
elegantly furnished dining
rooms and a cocktail lounge.
Off to the side of the main
building is a fresh fish market,
which is open six days a week.
Monti's specializes in East
ern seafoods, which are im
ported to ensure freshness.
These include Maine lobster,
cherry stone clams, and blue
point oysters. Everything on
the menu is available in their
fish market. The menu is not

limited to Eastern seafood,
however. It is in fact quite ex
tensive, offering Continental
dinners in addition to their
wide variety of seafood.
Most of the fish offered on
the menu is breaded, sauteed
or poached, and served in rich
sauces (which hide not only
the true flavor of the fish, but
the bones as well).
The portions are pretty good
sized and are served with salad
or vegetables, and potatoes.
Monti's is open seven days a
week. Monday through Friday
they are open for lunch and
dinner; Saturday and Sunday
they serve only dinner. For
those interested in entertain
ment, Friday and Saturday they
have what Monti calls their
"sing-along" in the cocktail
lounge.
RAMONA'S
41 Ramona
Palo Alto
326-2220
Ramona's is just in down
town Palo Alto and mere min
utes away from Stanford by
bicycle. One of its best fea
tures is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh
vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and all
types of dressing.
Ramona's pizzas are 10, 14
and 16-inches in diameter. Piz
zas here are extremely filling, a
result of too much cheese and
an overly-thick and chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ous and if one likes tomato
sauce, request an extra por
tion. Although pizza prices are
high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, stromboli is
notable for its greaslessness.
CHEF CHU'S
1067 N. San Antonio Rd.
4ns Altos
948-2696
I Occupying a corner on El
tamino Real and San Antonio
Road in Los Altos, Chef Chu's
lestaurant has thrived since its
fcpening in 1969. According to
pwner and chef de cuisine,
Larry Chu, the popular restau
rant has been enlarged five
Rimes to accommodate the
growing number of eager pa
trons.
The restaurant is usually
quite crowded, especially dur
ing weekday lunch hours and
Friday and Saturday dinner
hours. Although the waiting
area is small and sparsely fur
nished, there is a wonderful
window through which pa
trons can watch a dozen chefs
preparing woksful of wonder
ful Chinese food. The walls are
adorned with interesting pho
tographs, reviews, historical
data regarding the restaurant,
menus and a list of daily spe
cials. There are also notices of
cooking classes that Chef Chu
conducts and of special ten to
twelve course gourmet ban
quets.
The restaurant consists of
several rooms, each different
form the others and attesting
to the five stages of expansion.
Each room is somewhat clut

tered and crowded. The crowd
is noisy, and I think at ease and
enjoying the food, even
though the general atmos
phere leaves something to be
desired.
The food is varied with Szec
huan, Mandarin, Hunan and
Cantonese dishes on the
menu. Even though most of the
offerings are good, many are
not great. I have discovered,
however, some exceptional
dishes that I enthusiastically
recommend. You can't go
wrong on the appetizers. They
are not very expensive and
they are all very good. The Kuo
Teh (potstickers) are wonder
ful and the Mandarin Tidbits
plate is an excellent order if
you want to try several ap
petizers.
Recently I had dinner at Chef
Chu's with eight friends. We
had a feast for approximately
$9 per person. We ordered a la
carte with several items from
the gourmet menu and with
one item from the daily spe
cials. We started out with two
orders of kuo teh and an order
of won tons and a Mandarin
Tidbit plate. Then we were
served a crisp Chinese chicken
salad, which was thoroughly en
joyed. We also got a big bowl
of steamed white rice. Next
came Mu Shu Pork, which is
sort of a make-your-own
sandwich. First you put a

square of thin "pancake" on
your plate. Next you brush
hoisin sauce onto the "pan
cake'' with a scallion
"paintbrush." Next, putoneor
two spoonsful of the stir fried
filling on top of this, add the
scallion, roll up like a crepe,
and eat!
The next course was crispy
shrimp balls in a bird's nest.
This dish got raves and disap
peared in minutes, including
the delicate fried potato
"nest." Minced pork with let
tuce leaf cups was the next
item, and it was devoured with
equal gusto. The minced pork
had been stir fried with water
chestnuts and other vegetables
and spices, all finely minced.
The whole dish was topped
with a generous amount of
diced peanuts and served with
crisp whole lettuce leaves. The
minced pork, which was spicy,
was eaten in the lettuce cups,
like a taco, and the difference
in textures and contrast of hot
and cool was delightful.
Lover's prawns, a platter of
prawns prepared in two
different ways, is served with
each different dish side by
side, divided by slices of fresh
tomato. Half the prawns are
sauteed in a wine sauce and are
very mild. The other half is
prepared with tomato sauce,
chili paste and garlic and is
spicy. This dish, like the

minced pork in the lettuce leaf
cups, was especially good be
cause of its contrasting and
complementing characteris
tics.
For our final dish we enjoyed
the Pekingduckwith Mandarin
pancakes. This is an excellent
dish, which Chef Chu prepares
with a time-consuming and
unusual process. It isoneof his
specialties, and we concur, it is
a duck dish well done! How
ever, if I were ordering a feast
again, I might not order both
Peking duck and mu shu pork
at the same meal, because they
are served in a similar manner,
with meat on a roll or pancake
brushed with hoisin sauce.
Recommended as an addition
al dish is the mild lemon
chicken. Whole chicken
breasts are dipped in a special
batter, deep-fried until crunchy
and glazed with lemon sauce. I
also recommend kung pao
chicken, which is diced
chicken sauteed with chili
peppers, bamboo shoots, and
water chestnuts in a hot and
spicy sauce. The dish is topped
with crunchy peanuts, and is
somewhat similar to the minced
pork with lettuce cups, but
minus the lettuce. The mongo
lian beef, slices of tender beef
sauteed with scallions and
ginger, is also delicious. The
hot and sour soup and the won
ton soup are excellent, but my

favorite is fish blossom soup.
Boiling hot, steaming chicken
broth full of vegetables is
brought to the table. A platter
full of raw white fish filets is
also brought to the table and
these filets are gently put on
top of the hot soup, and they
cook before your eyes. This
soup sometimes appears as a
daily special or can be specially
ordered.
Dinners are served with tea
and a fortune cookie for de
ssert. There are a few desserts
listed on the menu, but none is
exceptional.
If you order selectively and
are unafraid to try daily spe
cials,you will findthatdiningat
Chef Chu's is a unique experi
ence. The food is of good qual
ity, the preparation done with
finesse and expertise, and the
results delicious. Chef Larry
Chu is enthusiastic and per
sonable, and he often greets
guests and gladly makes menu
recommendations. He re
cently wrote a cookbook called
Chef Chu's Distinctive Cuisine
of China. He has copies of
these on hand which he is
happy to sell and autograph for
his customers. If you enjoy
creatively prepared and gas
tronomically pleasing Chinese
cuisine, don't miss dining at
Chef Chu's.

ACAPULCO'S

Only a year old, but the
Acapulco's margaritas are very
good, and the food is good,
too. The restaurant offers a Fri
day afternoon happy hour with

free nachos. Open every day,
offering lunch and dinner from
the same menu. Inexpensive-
Moderate (drinks are fairly
expensive.)
CHANTILLY
530 Ramona
Palo Alto
321-4080
Chantilly is that type of res
taurant you'd like to keep a
secret. The understated ele
gence of roses and pinks give
Chantilly an exclusive atmos
phere without the pretensions

of other top-flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imag
ination; sauteed veal and
eggplant, L'escalopine de veau
a la Bolognaise for two,
Chicken Cynthia with cham
pagne.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
rather than stifle the freshness
of Chantilly's dishes. The Lis
son Salad a la Chantilly for two,
with lettuce, cucumber, olive,
bacon, feta cheese and herbs,
and the Meddalions of Spring
Lamb, sauteed with fresh tara

gon, will both delight rather
than assault your palate.
CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9988
China Lion is the venture of
Samson C h u , Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger
brother. The menu lists 109
items, many of which are
Hunan style. Prices are lower
than Chef Chu's, but the por
tions are smaller. One is ad
vised to order an extra bowl of
rice. Service is attentive.
Kung Pao Beef consists of
tender beef slices and crisp
green peppers accented with
peanuts. Prawns in hot sauce,
tnougn tasty, are a cnallenge to
eat — the prawns are not shel
led.
CHEZ JUSTINE
625 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
328-8549
Chez Justine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargots, and oysters.
Pate Maison is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. En
trees come with soup dujour
and salad.
The menu features Abalone,
Long Island Duckling, and New
York Steak with green pepper
corns among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce are extremely tender,
but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
T ruite Plemondaise (fresh trout
with wine sauce) is outstand
ing.
For dessert, Strawberries
with ice cream, nuts and Grand
Marnier is a visual as well as a

taste treat.
Although better French res
taurants than Chez Justines
exist on the Peninsula, don't
miss the Sunday Champagne
Brunch, the incredible buffet is
already a legend in the bay
area. Many students here fast
for two days beforehand.
COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN
BARBEQUE
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
568-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cookery.
Their simple diet of thin-sliced
roasted meat was introduced
in China during the 13th cen
tury. The Chinese added veg
etables and other ingredients,
the cuisine became known as
the "Mongolian Barbeque."
Take a bowl and help your
self to frozen strips of turkey,
lamb, pork and beef. Fresh
vegetables, including shred
ded carrots, onions, celery,
cabbage, bean sprouts and
cilantro, are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque
sauces. Curry, sweet and sour,
lobster, spicy, mild, medium,
hot and extra hot are offered,
and you are encouraged to
create your own combination.
The atmosphere of Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighboor
hood cafes. The services are
courteous, and made some
what more charming by the
fact that no one spoke English
very well. Col. Lee's might just
be the ticket if you are looking
for something truly unusual.
THE DUTCH GOOSE
1567 Alameda de las Pugas

The Goose joins the com
pany of Zots and the O as a
place to get beer and burgers.
Saturday nights are especially
tun there, as the estab
lishment seems entirely popu
lated by Stanford students.
There are peanut shells and
sawdust on the floor. The at
mosphere is reminiscent of
Pop's Malt Shop from Archie
Comics, after a crew of loggers
has rolled through, that is.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Avenue
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere in be
a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers
and candlelight and wine. Not
that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine, that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($l2 for
two; $6.50 for one) provide a
unique dinner alternative.
Dessert was the high point of
the meal. Cheesecake, as
sorted cakes and pastries (all
$1.60), various flavors of Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream ($1.25)
and Creme Caramel ($1.50)
easily triumph over your
calorific conscience.
The Gatehouse also has a

huge wooden bar with an
equally elegant, yet quiet at
mosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for
dinner from 5:30 p.m.; for
lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m.; and for Sunday Brunch
from 10 a.m. until 2:30 p.m.

had a feast for approximately
$9 per person. We ordered a la

a duck dish well done! How
ever, if I were ordering a feast
again, I might not order both
Peking duck and mu shu pork
at the same meal, because they
are served in a similar manner,
with meat on a roll or pancake
brushed with hoisin sauce.
Recommended as an addition
al dish is the mild lemon
chicken. Whole chicken
breasts are dipped in a special
batter, deep-fried until crunchy
and glazed with lemon sauce. I
also recommend kung pao
chicken, which is diced
chicken sauteed with chili
peppers, bamboo shoots, and

with crunchy peanuts, and is
somewhat similar to the minced
pork with lettuce cups, but

guests and gladly makes menu
recommendations. He re
cently wrote a cookbook called
Chef Chu's Distinctive Cuisine

happy to sell and autograph for
his customers. If you enjoy

ACAPULCO'S
2515 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
323-8403
Only a year old, but the
Acapulco's margaritas are very
good, and the food is good,
too. The restaurant offers a Fri
day afternoon happy hour with

free nachos. Open every day,
offering lunch and dinner from
the same menu. Inexpensive-
Moderate (drinks are fairly
expensive.)
CHANTILLY
530 Ramona
Palo Alto
321-4080
Chantilly is that type of res
taurant you'd like to keep a
secret. The understated ele
gence of roses and pinks give
Chantilly an exclusive atmos
phere without the pretensions

of other top-flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imag
ination; sauteed veal and
eggplant, L'escalopine de veau
a la Bolognaise for two,
Chicken Cynthia with cham
pagne.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
rather than stifle the freshness
of Chantilly's dishes. The Lis
son Salad a la Chantilly for two,
with lettuce, cucumber, olive,
bacon, feta cheese and herbs,
and the Meddalions of Spring
Lamb, sauteed with fresh tara

gon, will both delight rather
than assault your palate.
CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9988
China Lion is the venture of
Samson C h u , Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger
brother. The menu lists 109
items, many of which are
Hunan style. Prices are lower
than Chef Chu's, but the por
tions are smaller. One is ad
vised to order an extra bowl of
rice. Service is attentive.
Kung Pao Beef consists of
tender beef slices and crisp
green peppers accented with
peanuts. Prawns in hot sauce,
tnougn tasty, are a cnallenge to
eat — the prawns are not shel
led.
CHEZ JUSTINE
625 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
328-8549
Chez Justine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargots, and oysters.
Pate Maison is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. En
trees come with soup dujour
and salad.
The menu features Abalone,
Long Island Duckling, and New
York Steak with green pepper
corns among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce are extremely tender,
but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
T ruite Plemondaise (fresh trout
with wine sauce) is outstand
ing.
For dessert, Strawberries
with ice cream, nuts and Grand
Marnier is a visual as well as a

taste treat.
Although better French res
taurants than Chez Justines
exist on the Peninsula, don't
miss the Sunday Champagne
Brunch, the incredible buffet is
already a legend in the bay
area. Many students here fast
for two days beforehand.
COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN
BARBEQUE
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
568-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cookery.
Their simple diet of thin-sliced
roasted meat was introduced
in China during the 13th cen
tury. The Chinese added veg
etables and other ingredients,
the cuisine became known as
the "Mongolian Barbeque."
Take a bowl and help your
self to frozen strips of turkey,
lamb, pork and beef. Fresh
vegetables, including shred
ded carrots, onions, celery,
cabbage, bean sprouts and
cilantro, are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque
sauces. Curry, sweet and sour,
lobster, spicy, mild, medium,
hot and extra hot are offered,
and you are encouraged to
create your own combination.
The atmosphere of Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighboor
hood cafes. The services are
courteous, and made some
what more charming by the
fact that no one spoke English
very well. Col. Lee's might just
be the ticket if you are looking
for something truly unusual.
THE DUTCH GOOSE
1567 Alameda de las Pugas
Menlo park
854-3245
The Goose joins the com
pany of Zots and the O as a
place to get beer and burgers.
Saturday nights are especially
tun there, as the estab
lishment seems entirely popu
lated by Stanford students.
There are peanut shells and
sawdust on the floor. The at
mosphere is reminiscent of
Pop's Malt Shop from Archie
Comics, after a crew of loggers
has rolled through, that is.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Avenue
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere in be
a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers
and candlelight and wine. Not
that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine, that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($l2 for
two; $6.50 for one) provide a
unique dinner alternative.
Dessert was the high point of
the meal. Cheesecake, as
sorted cakes and pastries (all
$1.60), various flavors of Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream ($1.25)
and Creme Caramel ($1.50)
easily triumph over your
calorific conscience.
The Gatehouse also has a

huge wooden bar with an
equally elegant, yet quiet at
mosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for
dinner from 5:30 p.m.; for
lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m.; and for Sunday Brunch
from 10 a.m. until 2:30 p.m.
HENRY'S
482 University Avenue
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are
priced between $5 and $8, and
come with a choice of
homemade soup or house
salad.
The house salad was crisp,
refreshing and served with a
chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on
a bed of freash spinach and
covered with a light wine
sauce. Perfectly cooked veget
ables and better-than-average
rice accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Aurich-style) is another sure
bet at Henry's. The real charac
ter of the ingredients,
moreover, is not masked by
heavy sauces. Both oversalting
and oversaucing are frequent
faults ot even the best hrencn
restaurants.
LA TERASSE
3740 El Camino
Palo Alto
494-0700
La Terasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his

policy of good food at reason
able prices.
The dinner includes soup du
jour and a pleasant butter let
tuce salad with a mustardy vin
aigrette dressing.
Ris de Veau Finan
ciere,(sweetbreads in cream),
are inconsistent. Some are
marvelous, but others, not
satisfactorily dismembraned,
are chewy and rubbery with a
stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate
mousse and Floating Isles" of
meringue.
MADDALENA'S
CONTINENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Maddalena's is a must for
any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside
Scampi Bordelaise. Our meals
were excellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine, ($6.25), Fettucine
alia Romana ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.50), we chose
Linguine Von.
Maddalena's offers salads a
la carte, such as spinach ($5.50
for two), mushroom ($5),
Caesar ($5.50 for two) and But
ter Lettuce with seafood
($4.95).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($9.95) and sole
Florentine with Shrimp ($10.50)
to Chicken Al Forno Arturo
($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
lust as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind

me of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifully
painted screens and chan
deliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.
thru Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to
2:30 p.m. and 6-10 p.m.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road
East Palo Alto
856-7700
One of the better Chinese
restaurants around, Ming's is a
popular banquet spot and if
you don't go there on your
own, you'll likely end up there
with your dorm, team or club
sooner or later. The good thing
is you can either have a moder
ate, simple dinner, or an elabo
rate meal which can get fairly
expensive. Ming's Beef is one
of their best recognized spe
cialties. Moderate — Expensive
Open daily.
MONTI'S SEAFOOD
RESTAURANT
Menlo Park
321-3724
From the outside, Monti's
Seafood Restaurant in Menlo
Park looks small and intimate.
The intimate part is right, but it
is by no means small. The
building itself contains three
elegantly furnished dining
rooms and a cocktail lounge.
Off to the side of the main
building is a fresh fish market,
which is open six days a week.
Monti's specializes in East
ern seafoods, which are im
ported to ensure freshness.
These include Maine lobster,
cherry stone clams, and blue
point oysters. Everything on
the menu is available in their
fish market. The menu is not

limited to Eastern seafood,
however. It is in fact quite ex
tensive, offering Continental
dinners in addition to their
wide variety of seafood.
Most of the fish offered on
the menu is breaded, sauteed
or poached, and served in rich
sauces (which hide not only
the true flavor of the fish, but
the bones as well).
The portions are pretty good
sized and are served with salad
or vegetables, and potatoes.
Monti's is open seven days a
week. Monday through Friday
they are open for lunch and
dinner; Saturday and Sunday
they serve only dinner. For
those interested in entertain
ment, Friday and Saturday they
have what Monti calls their
"sing-along" in the cocktail
lounge.
RAMONA'S
41 Ramona
Palo Alto
326-2220
Ramona's is just in down
town Palo Alto and mere min
utes away from Stanford by
bicycle. One of its best fea
tures is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh
vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and all
types of dressing.
Ramona's pizzas are 10, 14
and 16-inches in diameter. Piz
zas here are extremely filling, a
result of too much cheese and
an overly-thick and chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ous and if one likes tomato
sauce, request an extra por
tion. Although pizza prices are
high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, stromboli is
notable for its greaslessness.
CHEF CHU'S
1067 N. San Antonio Rd.
4ns Altos
948-2696
I Occupying a corner on El
tamino Real and San Antonio
Road in Los Altos, Chef Chu's
lestaurant has thrived since its
fcpening in 1969. According to
pwner and chef de cuisine,
Larry Chu, the popular restau
rant has been enlarged five
Rimes to accommodate the
growing number of eager pa
trons.
The restaurant is usually
quite crowded, especially dur
ing weekday lunch hours and
Friday and Saturday dinner
hours. Although the waiting
area is small and sparsely fur
nished, there is a wonderful
window through which pa
trons can watch a dozen chefs
preparing woksful of wonder
ful Chinese food. The walls are
adorned with interesting pho
tographs, reviews, historical
data regarding the restaurant,
menus and a list of daily spe
cials. There are also notices of
cooking classes that Chef Chu
conducts and of special ten to
twelve course gourmet ban
quets.
The restaurant consists of
several rooms, each different
form the others and attesting
to the five stages of expansion.
Each room is somewhat clut

tered and crowded. The crowd
is noisy, and I think at ease and
enjoying the food, even
though the general atmos
phere leaves something to be
desired.
The food is varied with Szec
huan, Mandarin, Hunan and
Cantonese dishes on the
menu. Even though most of the
offerings are good, many are
not great. I have discovered,
however, some exceptional
dishes that I enthusiastically
recommend. You can't go
wrong on the appetizers. They
are not very expensive and
they are all very good. The Kuo
Teh (potstickers) are wonder
ful and the Mandarin Tidbits
plate is an excellent order if
you want to try several ap
petizers.
Recently I had dinner at Chef
Chu's with eight friends. We
had a feast for approximately
$9 per person. We ordered a la
carte with several items from
the gourmet menu and with
one item from the daily spe
cials. We started out with two
orders of kuo teh and an order
of won tons and a Mandarin
Tidbit plate. Then we were
served a crisp Chinese chicken
salad, which was thoroughly en
joyed. We also got a big bowl
of steamed white rice. Next
came Mu Shu Pork, which is
sort of a make-your-own
sandwich. First you put a

square of thin "pancake" on
your plate. Next you brush
hoisin sauce onto the "pan
cake'' with a scallion
"paintbrush." Next, putoneor
two spoonsful of the stir fried
filling on top of this, add the
scallion, roll up like a crepe,
and eat!
The next course was crispy
shrimp balls in a bird's nest.
This dish got raves and disap
peared in minutes, including
the delicate fried potato
"nest." Minced pork with let
tuce leaf cups was the next
item, and it was devoured with
equal gusto. The minced pork
had been stir fried with water
chestnuts and other vegetables
and spices, all finely minced.
The whole dish was topped
with a generous amount of
diced peanuts and served with
crisp whole lettuce leaves. The
minced pork, which was spicy,
was eaten in the lettuce cups,
like a taco, and the difference
in textures and contrast of hot
and cool was delightful.
Lover's prawns, a platter of
prawns prepared in two
different ways, is served with
each different dish side by
side, divided by slices of fresh
tomato. Half the prawns are
sauteed in a wine sauce and are
very mild. The other half is
prepared with tomato sauce,
chili paste and garlic and is
spicy. This dish, like the

minced pork in the lettuce leaf
cups, was especially good be
cause of its contrasting and
complementing characteris
tics.
For our final dish we enjoyed
the Pekingduckwith Mandarin
pancakes. This is an excellent
dish, which Chef Chu prepares
with a time-consuming and
unusual process. It isoneof his
specialties, and we concur, it is
a duck dish well done! How
ever, if I were ordering a feast
again, I might not order both
Peking duck and mu shu pork
at the same meal, because they
are served in a similar manner,
with meat on a roll or pancake
brushed with hoisin sauce.
Recommended as an addition
al dish is the mild lemon
chicken. Whole chicken
breasts are dipped in a special
batter, deep-fried until crunchy
and glazed with lemon sauce. I
also recommend kung pao
chicken, which is diced
chicken sauteed with chili
peppers, bamboo shoots, and
water chestnuts in a hot and
spicy sauce. The dish is topped
with crunchy peanuts, and is
somewhat similar to the minced
pork with lettuce cups, but
minus the lettuce. The mongo
lian beef, slices of tender beef
sauteed with scallions and
ginger, is also delicious. The
hot and sour soup and the won
ton soup are excellent, but my

favorite is fish blossom soup.
Boiling hot, steaming chicken
broth full of vegetables is
brought to the table. A platter
full of raw white fish filets is
also brought to the table and
these filets are gently put on
top of the hot soup, and they
cook before your eyes. This
soup sometimes appears as a
daily special or can be specially
ordered.
Dinners are served with tea
and a fortune cookie for de
ssert. There are a few desserts
listed on the menu, but none is
exceptional.
If you order selectively and
are unafraid to try daily spe
cials,you will findthatdiningat
Chef Chu's is a unique experi
ence. The food is of good qual
ity, the preparation done with
finesse and expertise, and the
results delicious. Chef Larry
Chu is enthusiastic and per
sonable, and he often greets
guests and gladly makes menu

tures is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh
vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and all
types of dressing.
Ramona's pizzas are 10, 14
and 16-inches in diameter. Piz
zas here are extremely filling, a
result of too much cheese and
an overly-thick and chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ous and if one likes tomato
sauce, request an extra por
tion. Although pizza prices are
high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, stromboli is
notable for its greaslessness.
CHEF CHU'S
1067 N. San Antonio Rd.
4ns Altos
948-2696
I Occupying a corner on El
tamino Real and San Antonio
Road in Los Altos, Chef Chu's
lestaurant has thrived since its
fcpening in 1969. According to
pwner and chef de cuisine,
Larry Chu, the popular restau
rant has been enlarged five
Rimes to accommodate the
growing number of eager pa
trons.
The restaurant is usually
quite crowded, especially dur
ing weekday lunch hours and
Friday and Saturday dinner
hours. Although the waiting
area is small and sparsely fur
nished, there is a wonderful
window through which pa
trons can watch a dozen chefs
preparing woksful of wonder
ful Chinese food. The walls are
adorned with interesting pho
tographs, reviews, historical
data regarding the restaurant,
menus and a list of daily spe
cials. There are also notices of
cooking classes that Chef Chu
conducts and of special ten to
twelve course gourmet ban
quets.
The restaurant consists of
several rooms, each different
form the others and attesting
to the five stages of expansion.
Each room is somewhat clut

tered and crowded. The crowd
is noisy, and I think at ease and
enjoying the food, even
though the general atmos
phere leaves something to be
desired.
The food is varied with Szec
huan, Mandarin, Hunan and
Cantonese dishes on the
menu. Even though most of the
offerings are good, many are
not great. I have discovered,
however, some exceptional
dishes that I enthusiastically
recommend. You can't go
wrong on the appetizers. They
are not very expensive and
they are all very good. The Kuo
Teh (potstickers) are wonder
ful and the Mandarin Tidbits
plate is an excellent order if
you want to try several ap
petizers.
Recently I had dinner at Chef
Chu's with eight friends. We
had a feast for approximately
$9 per person. We ordered a la
carte with several items from
the gourmet menu and with
one item from the daily spe
cials. We started out with two
orders of kuo teh and an order
of won tons and a Mandarin
Tidbit plate. Then we were
served a crisp Chinese chicken
salad, which was thoroughly en
joyed. We also got a big bowl
of steamed white rice. Next
came Mu Shu Pork, which is
sort of a make-your-own
sandwich. First you put a

square of thin "pancake" on
your plate. Next you brush
hoisin sauce onto the "pan
cake'' with a scallion
"paintbrush." Next, putoneor
two spoonsful of the stir fried
filling on top of this, add the
scallion, roll up like a crepe,
and eat!
The next course was crispy
shrimp balls in a bird's nest.
This dish got raves and disap
peared in minutes, including
the delicate fried potato
"nest." Minced pork with let
tuce leaf cups was the next
item, and it was devoured with
equal gusto. The minced pork
had been stir fried with water
chestnuts and other vegetables
and spices, all finely minced.
The whole dish was topped
with a generous amount of
diced peanuts and served with
crisp whole lettuce leaves. The
minced pork, which was spicy,
was eaten in the lettuce cups,
like a taco, and the difference
in textures and contrast of hot
and cool was delightful.
Lover's prawns, a platter of
prawns prepared in two
different ways, is served with
each different dish side by
side, divided by slices of fresh
tomato. Half the prawns are
sauteed in a wine sauce and are
very mild. The other half is
prepared with tomato sauce,
chili paste and garlic and is
spicy. This dish, like the

minced pork in the lettuce leaf
cups, was especially good be
cause of its contrasting and
complementing characteris
tics.
For our final dish we enjoyed
the Pekingduckwith Mandarin
pancakes. This is an excellent
dish, which Chef Chu prepares
with a time-consuming and
unusual process. It isoneof his
specialties, and we concur, it is
a duck dish well done! How
ever, if I were ordering a feast
again, I might not order both
Peking duck and mu shu pork
at the same meal, because they
are served in a similar manner,
with meat on a roll or pancake
brushed with hoisin sauce.
Recommended as an addition
al dish is the mild lemon
chicken. Whole chicken
breasts are dipped in a special
batter, deep-fried until crunchy
and glazed with lemon sauce. I
also recommend kung pao
chicken, which is diced
chicken sauteed with chili
peppers, bamboo shoots, and
water chestnuts in a hot and
spicy sauce. The dish is topped
with crunchy peanuts, and is
somewhat similar to the minced
pork with lettuce cups, but
minus the lettuce. The mongo
lian beef, slices of tender beef
sauteed with scallions and
ginger, is also delicious. The
hot and sour soup and the won
ton soup are excellent, but my

favorite is fish blossom soup.
Boiling hot, steaming chicken
broth full of vegetables is
brought to the table. A platter
full of raw white fish filets is
also brought to the table and
these filets are gently put on
top of the hot soup, and they
cook before your eyes. This
soup sometimes appears as a
daily special or can be specially
ordered.
Dinners are served with tea
and a fortune cookie for de
ssert. There are a few desserts
listed on the menu, but none is
exceptional.
If you order selectively and
are unafraid to try daily spe
cials,you will findthatdiningat
Chef Chu's is a unique experi
ence. The food is of good qual
ity, the preparation done with
finesse and expertise, and the
results delicious. Chef Larry
Chu is enthusiastic and per
sonable, and he often greets
guests and gladly makes menu
recommendations. He re
cently wrote a cookbook called
Chef Chu's Distinctive Cuisine
of China. He has copies of
these on hand which he is
happy to sell and autograph for
his customers. If you enjoy
creatively prepared and gas
tronomically pleasing Chinese
cuisine, don't miss dining at
Chef Chu's.

ACAPULCO'S
2515 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
323-8403
Only a year old, but the
Acapulco's margaritas are very
good, and the food is good,
too. The restaurant offers a Fri
day afternoon happy hour with

free nachos. Open every day,
offering lunch and dinner from
the same menu. Inexpensive-
Moderate (drinks are fairly
expensive.)
CHANTILLY
530 Ramona
Palo Alto
321-4080
Chantilly is that type of res
taurant you'd like to keep a
secret. The understated ele
gence of roses and pinks give
Chantilly an exclusive atmos
phere without the pretensions

of other top-flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imag
ination; sauteed veal and
eggplant, L'escalopine de veau
a la Bolognaise for two,
Chicken Cynthia with cham
pagne.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
rather than stifle the freshness
of Chantilly's dishes. The Lis
son Salad a la Chantilly for two,
with lettuce, cucumber, olive,
bacon, feta cheese and herbs,
and the Meddalions of Spring
Lamb, sauteed with fresh tara

gon, will both delight rather
than assault your palate.
CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9988
China Lion is the venture of
Samson C h u , Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger
brother. The menu lists 109
items, many of which are
Hunan style. Prices are lower
than Chef Chu's, but the por
tions are smaller. One is ad
vised to order an extra bowl of
rice. Service is attentive.
Kung Pao Beef consists of
tender beef slices and crisp
green peppers accented with
peanuts. Prawns in hot sauce,
tnougn tasty, are a cnallenge to
eat — the prawns are not shel
led.
CHEZ JUSTINE
625 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
328-8549
Chez Justine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargots, and oysters.
Pate Maison is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. En
trees come with soup dujour
and salad.
The menu features Abalone,
Long Island Duckling, and New
York Steak with green pepper
corns among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce are extremely tender,
but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
T ruite Plemondaise (fresh trout
with wine sauce) is outstand
ing.
For dessert, Strawberries
with ice cream, nuts and Grand
Marnier is a visual as well as a

taste treat.
Although better French res
taurants than Chez Justines
exist on the Peninsula, don't
miss the Sunday Champagne
Brunch, the incredible buffet is
already a legend in the bay
area. Many students here fast
for two days beforehand.
COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN
BARBEQUE
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
568-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cookery.
Their simple diet of thin-sliced
roasted meat was introduced
in China during the 13th cen
tury. The Chinese added veg
etables and other ingredients,
the cuisine became known as
the "Mongolian Barbeque."
Take a bowl and help your
self to frozen strips of turkey,
lamb, pork and beef. Fresh
vegetables, including shred
ded carrots, onions, celery,
cabbage, bean sprouts and
cilantro, are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque
sauces. Curry, sweet and sour,
lobster, spicy, mild, medium,
hot and extra hot are offered,
and you are encouraged to
create your own combination.
The atmosphere of Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighboor
hood cafes. The services are
courteous, and made some
what more charming by the
fact that no one spoke English
very well. Col. Lee's might just
be the ticket if you are looking
for something truly unusual.
THE DUTCH GOOSE
1567 Alameda de las Pugas
Menlo park
854-3245
The Goose joins the com
pany of Zots and the O as a
place to get beer and burgers.
Saturday nights are especially
tun there, as the estab
lishment seems entirely popu
lated by Stanford students.
There are peanut shells and
sawdust on the floor. The at
mosphere is reminiscent of
Pop's Malt Shop from Archie
Comics, after a crew of loggers
has rolled through, that is.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Avenue
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere in be
a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers
and candlelight and wine. Not
that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine, that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($l2 for
two; $6.50 for one) provide a
unique dinner alternative.
Dessert was the high point of
the meal. Cheesecake, as
sorted cakes and pastries (all
$1.60), various flavors of Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream ($1.25)
and Creme Caramel ($1.50)
easily triumph over your
calorific conscience.
The Gatehouse also has a

huge wooden bar with an
equally elegant, yet quiet at
mosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for
dinner from 5:30 p.m.; for
lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m.; and for Sunday Brunch
from 10 a.m. until 2:30 p.m.
HENRY'S
482 University Avenue
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are
priced between $5 and $8, and
come with a choice of
homemade soup or house
salad.
The house salad was crisp,
refreshing and served with a
chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on
a bed of freash spinach and
covered with a light wine
sauce. Perfectly cooked veget
ables and better-than-average
rice accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Aurich-style) is another sure
bet at Henry's. The real charac
ter of the ingredients,
moreover, is not masked by
heavy sauces. Both oversalting
and oversaucing are frequent
faults ot even the best hrencn
restaurants.
LA TERASSE
3740 El Camino
Palo Alto
494-0700
La Terasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his

policy of good food at reason
able prices.
The dinner includes soup du
jour and a pleasant butter let
tuce salad with a mustardy vin
aigrette dressing.
Ris de Veau Finan
ciere,(sweetbreads in cream),
are inconsistent. Some are
marvelous, but others, not
satisfactorily dismembraned,
are chewy and rubbery with a
stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate
mousse and Floating Isles" of
meringue.
MADDALENA'S
CONTINENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Maddalena's is a must for
any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside
Scampi Bordelaise. Our meals
were excellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine, ($6.25), Fettucine
alia Romana ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.50), we chose
Linguine Von.
Maddalena's offers salads a
la carte, such as spinach ($5.50
for two), mushroom ($5),
Caesar ($5.50 for two) and But
ter Lettuce with seafood
($4.95).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($9.95) and sole
Florentine with Shrimp ($10.50)
to Chicken Al Forno Arturo
($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
lust as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind

me of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifully
painted screens and chan
deliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.
thru Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to
2:30 p.m. and 6-10 p.m.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road
East Palo Alto
856-7700
One of the better Chinese
restaurants around, Ming's is a
popular banquet spot and if
you don't go there on your
own, you'll likely end up there
with your dorm, team or club
sooner or later. The good thing
is you can either have a moder
ate, simple dinner, or an elabo
rate meal which can get fairly
expensive. Ming's Beef is one
of their best recognized spe
cialties. Moderate — Expensive
Open daily.
MONTI'S SEAFOOD
RESTAURANT
Menlo Park
321-3724
From the outside, Monti's
Seafood Restaurant in Menlo
Park looks small and intimate.
The intimate part is right, but it
is by no means small. The
building itself contains three
elegantly furnished dining
rooms and a cocktail lounge.
Off to the side of the main
building is a fresh fish market,
which is open six days a week.
Monti's specializes in East
ern seafoods, which are im
ported to ensure freshness.
These include Maine lobster,
cherry stone clams, and blue
point oysters. Everything on
the menu is available in their
fish market. The menu is not

limited to Eastern seafood,
however. It is in fact quite ex
tensive, offering Continental
dinners in addition to their
wide variety of seafood.
Most of the fish offered on
the menu is breaded, sauteed
or poached, and served in rich
sauces (which hide not only
the true flavor of the fish, but
the bones as well).
The portions are pretty good
sized and are served with salad
or vegetables, and potatoes.
Monti's is open seven days a
week. Monday through Friday
they are open for lunch and
dinner; Saturday and Sunday
they serve only dinner. For
those interested in entertain
ment, Friday and Saturday they
have what Monti calls their
"sing-along" in the cocktail
lounge.
RAMONA'S

tures is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh
vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and all
types of dressing.
Ramona's pizzas are 10, 14
and 16-inches in diameter. Piz
zas here are extremely filling, a
result of too much cheese and
an overly-thick and chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ous and if one likes tomato

had a feast for approximately
$9 per person. We ordered a la

a duck dish well done! How
ever, if I were ordering a feast
again, I might not order both
Peking duck and mu shu pork
at the same meal, because they
are served in a similar manner,
with meat on a roll or pancake
brushed with hoisin sauce.
Recommended as an addition
al dish is the mild lemon
chicken. Whole chicken
breasts are dipped in a special
batter, deep-fried until crunchy
and glazed with lemon sauce. I
also recommend kung pao
chicken, which is diced
chicken sauteed with chili

somewhat similar to the minced
pork with lettuce cups, but

choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($l2 for
two; $6.50 for one) provide a
unique dinner alternative.
Dessert was the high point of
the meal. Cheesecake, as
sorted cakes and pastries (all
$1.60), various flavors of Rick's
Rather Rich Ice Cream ($1.25)
and Creme Caramel ($1.50)
easily triumph over your
calorific conscience.
The Gatehouse also has a

huge wooden bar with an
equally elegant, yet quiet at
mosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for
dinner from 5:30 p.m.; for
lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m.; and for Sunday Brunch
from 10 a.m. until 2:30 p.m.
HENRY'S
482 University Avenue
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the gener
ous portions, fair prices and
great atmosphere more than
compensate. Entrees are
priced between $5 and $8, and
come with a choice of
homemade soup or house
salad.
The house salad was crisp,
refreshing and served with a
chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on
a bed of freash spinach and
covered with a light wine
sauce. Perfectly cooked veget
ables and better-than-average
rice accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Aurich-style) is another sure
bet at Henry's. The real charac
ter of the ingredients,
moreover, is not masked by
heavy sauces. Both oversalting
and oversaucing are frequent
faults ot even the best hrencn
restaurants.
LA TERASSE
3740 El Camino
Palo Alto
494-0700
La Terasse is Leon Sidella's
third French restaurant in the
Bay Area and it continues his

policy of good food at reason
able prices.
The dinner includes soup du
jour and a pleasant butter let
tuce salad with a mustardy vin
aigrette dressing.
Ris de Veau Finan
ciere,(sweetbreads in cream),
are inconsistent. Some are
marvelous, but others, not
satisfactorily dismembraned,
are chewy and rubbery with a
stale taste.
Dessert includes chocolate
mousse and Floating Isles" of
meringue.
MADDALENA'S
CONTINENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Maddalena's is a must for
any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served
unblushingly alongside
Scampi Bordelaise. Our meals
were excellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers.
From such a list as Cannelloni
Florentine, ($6.25), Fettucine
alia Romana ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.50), we chose
Linguine Von.
Maddalena's offers salads a
la carte, such as spinach ($5.50
for two), mushroom ($5),
Caesar ($5.50 for two) and But
ter Lettuce with seafood
($4.95).
The entree list most clearly
reveals Maddalena's continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($9.95) and sole
Florentine with Shrimp ($10.50)
to Chicken Al Forno Arturo
($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
lust as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind

me of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold
framed pictures, beautifully
painted screens and chan
deliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.
thru Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to
2:30 p.m. and 6-10 p.m.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road
East Palo Alto
856-7700
One of the better Chinese
restaurants around, Ming's is a
popular banquet spot and if
you don't go there on your
own, you'll likely end up there
with your dorm, team or club
sooner or later. The good thing
is you can either have a moder
ate, simple dinner, or an elabo
rate meal which can get fairly
expensive. Ming's Beef is one
of their best recognized spe
cialties. Moderate — Expensive
Open daily.
MONTI'S SEAFOOD
RESTAURANT
Menlo Park
321-3724
From the outside, Monti's
Seafood Restaurant in Menlo
Park looks small and intimate.
The intimate part is right, but it
is by no means small. The
building itself contains three
elegantly furnished dining
rooms and a cocktail lounge.
Off to the side of the main
building is a fresh fish market,
which is open six days a week.
Monti's specializes in East
ern seafoods, which are im
ported to ensure freshness.
These include Maine lobster,
cherry stone clams, and blue
point oysters. Everything on
the menu is available in their
fish market. The menu is not

limited to Eastern seafood,
however. It is in fact quite ex
tensive, offering Continental
dinners in addition to their
wide variety of seafood.
Most of the fish offered on
the menu is breaded, sauteed
or poached, and served in rich
sauces (which hide not only
the true flavor of the fish, but
the bones as well).
The portions are pretty good
sized and are served with salad
or vegetables, and potatoes.
Monti's is open seven days a
week. Monday through Friday
they are open for lunch and
dinner; Saturday and Sunday
they serve only dinner. For
those interested in entertain
ment, Friday and Saturday they
have what Monti calls their
"sing-along" in the cocktail
lounge.
RAMONA'S
41 Ramona
Palo Alto
326-2220
Ramona's is just in down
town Palo Alto and mere min
utes away from Stanford by
bicycle. One of its best fea
tures is the salad buffet, an
amazing assortment of fresh
vegetables such as cherry to
matoes and bell peppers, plus
mozzarella cheese, sprouts,
mushrooms, beans and all
types of dressing.
Ramona's pizzas are 10, 14
and 16-inches in diameter. Piz
zas here are extremely filling, a
result of too much cheese and
an overly-thick and chewy
crust. Toppings are not gener
ous and if one likes tomato
sauce, request an extra por
tion. Although pizza prices are
high, especially in relation to
the meat portions, stromboli is
notable for its greaslessness.
CHEF CHU'S
1067 N. San Antonio Rd.
4ns Altos
948-2696
I Occupying a corner on El
tamino Real and San Antonio
Road in Los Altos, Chef Chu's
lestaurant has thrived since its
fcpening in 1969. According to
pwner and chef de cuisine,
Larry Chu, the popular restau
rant has been enlarged five
Rimes to accommodate the
growing number of eager pa
trons.
The restaurant is usually
quite crowded, especially dur
ing weekday lunch hours and
Friday and Saturday dinner
hours. Although the waiting
area is small and sparsely fur
nished, there is a wonderful
window through which pa
trons can watch a dozen chefs
preparing woksful of wonder
ful Chinese food. The walls are
adorned with interesting pho
tographs, reviews, historical
data regarding the restaurant,
menus and a list of daily spe
cials. There are also notices of
cooking classes that Chef Chu
conducts and of special ten to
twelve course gourmet ban
quets.
The restaurant consists of
several rooms, each different
form the others and attesting
to the five stages of expansion.
Each room is somewhat clut

tered and crowded. The crowd
is noisy, and I think at ease and
enjoying the food, even
though the general atmos
phere leaves something to be
desired.
The food is varied with Szec
huan, Mandarin, Hunan and
Cantonese dishes on the
menu. Even though most of the
offerings are good, many are
not great. I have discovered,
however, some exceptional
dishes that I enthusiastically
recommend. You can't go
wrong on the appetizers. They
are not very expensive and
they are all very good. The Kuo
Teh (potstickers) are wonder
ful and the Mandarin Tidbits
plate is an excellent order if
you want to try several ap
petizers.
Recently I had dinner at Chef
Chu's with eight friends. We
had a feast for approximately
$9 per person. We ordered a la
carte with several items from
the gourmet menu and with
one item from the daily spe
cials. We started out with two
orders of kuo teh and an order
of won tons and a Mandarin
Tidbit plate. Then we were
served a crisp Chinese chicken
salad, which was thoroughly en
joyed. We also got a big bowl
of steamed white rice. Next
came Mu Shu Pork, which is
sort of a make-your-own
sandwich. First you put a

square of thin "pancake" on
your plate. Next you brush
hoisin sauce onto the "pan
cake'' with a scallion
"paintbrush." Next, putoneor
two spoonsful of the stir fried
filling on top of this, add the
scallion, roll up like a crepe,
and eat!
The next course was crispy
shrimp balls in a bird's nest.
This dish got raves and disap
peared in minutes, including
the delicate fried potato
"nest." Minced pork with let
tuce leaf cups was the next
item, and it was devoured with
equal gusto. The minced pork
had been stir fried with water
chestnuts and other vegetables
and spices, all finely minced.
The whole dish was topped
with a generous amount of
diced peanuts and served with
crisp whole lettuce leaves. The
minced pork, which was spicy,
was eaten in the lettuce cups,
like a taco, and the difference
in textures and contrast of hot
and cool was delightful.
Lover's prawns, a platter of
prawns prepared in two
different ways, is served with
each different dish side by
side, divided by slices of fresh
tomato. Half the prawns are
sauteed in a wine sauce and are
very mild. The other half is
prepared with tomato sauce,
chili paste and garlic and is
spicy. This dish, like the

minced pork in the lettuce leaf
cups, was especially good be
cause of its contrasting and
complementing characteris
tics.
For our final dish we enjoyed
the Pekingduckwith Mandarin
pancakes. This is an excellent
dish, which Chef Chu prepares
with a time-consuming and
unusual process. It isoneof his
specialties, and we concur, it is
a duck dish well done! How
ever, if I were ordering a feast
again, I might not order both
Peking duck and mu shu pork
at the same meal, because they
are served in a similar manner,
with meat on a roll or pancake
brushed with hoisin sauce.
Recommended as an addition
al dish is the mild lemon
chicken. Whole chicken
breasts are dipped in a special
batter, deep-fried until crunchy
and glazed with lemon sauce. I
also recommend kung pao
chicken, which is diced
chicken sauteed with chili
peppers, bamboo shoots, and
water chestnuts in a hot and
spicy sauce. The dish is topped
with crunchy peanuts, and is
somewhat similar to the minced
pork with lettuce cups, but
minus the lettuce. The mongo
lian beef, slices of tender beef
sauteed with scallions and
ginger, is also delicious. The
hot and sour soup and the won
ton soup are excellent, but my

favorite is fish blossom soup.
Boiling hot, steaming chicken
broth full of vegetables is
brought to the table. A platter
full of raw white fish filets is
also brought to the table and
these filets are gently put on
top of the hot soup, and they
cook before your eyes. This
soup sometimes appears as a
daily special or can be specially
ordered.
Dinners are served with tea
and a fortune cookie for de
ssert. There are a few desserts
listed on the menu, but none is
exceptional.
If you order selectively and
are unafraid to try daily spe
cials,you will findthatdiningat
Chef Chu's is a unique experi
ence. The food is of good qual
ity, the preparation done with
finesse and expertise, and the
results delicious. Chef Larry
Chu is enthusiastic and per
sonable, and he often greets
guests and gladly makes menu
recommendations. He re
cently wrote a cookbook called
Chef Chu's Distinctive Cuisine
of China. He has copies of
these on hand which he is
happy to sell and autograph for
his customers. If you enjoy
creatively prepared and gas
tronomically pleasing Chinese
cuisine, don't miss dining at
Chef Chu's.

ACAPULCO'S
2515 El Camino Real
Palo Alto

Only a year old, but the
Acapulco's margaritas are very
good, and the food is good,
too. The restaurant offers a Fri
day afternoon happy hour with

free nachos. Open every day,
offering lunch and dinner from
the same menu. Inexpensive-
Moderate (drinks are fairly
expensive.)
CHANTILLY
530 Ramona
Palo Alto
321-4080
Chantilly is that type of res
taurant you'd like to keep a
secret. The understated ele
gence of roses and pinks give
Chantilly an exclusive atmos
phere without the pretensions

of other top-flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imag
ination; sauteed veal and
eggplant, L'escalopine de veau
a la Bolognaise for two,
Chicken Cynthia with cham
pagne.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
rather than stifle the freshness
of Chantilly's dishes. The Lis
son Salad a la Chantilly for two,
with lettuce, cucumber, olive,
bacon, feta cheese and herbs,
and the Meddalions of Spring
Lamb, sauteed with fresh tara

gon, will both delight rather
than assault your palate.
CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9988
China Lion is the venture of
Samson C h u , Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger
brother. The menu lists 109
items, many of which are
Hunan style. Prices are lower
than Chef Chu's, but the por
tions are smaller. One is ad
vised to order an extra bowl of
rice. Service is attentive.
Kung Pao Beef consists of
tender beef slices and crisp
green peppers accented with
peanuts. Prawns in hot sauce,
tnougn tasty, are a cnallenge to
eat — the prawns are not shel
led.
CHEZ JUSTINE
625 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
328-8549
Chez Justine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargots, and oysters.
Pate Maison is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. En
trees come with soup dujour
and salad.
The menu features Abalone,
Long Island Duckling, and New
York Steak with green pepper
corns among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce are extremely tender,
but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
T ruite Plemondaise (fresh trout
with wine sauce) is outstand
ing.
For dessert, Strawberries
with ice cream, nuts and Grand
Marnier is a visual as well as a

taste treat.
Although better French res
taurants than Chez Justines
exist on the Peninsula, don't
miss the Sunday Champagne
Brunch, the incredible buffet is
already a legend in the bay
area. Many students here fast
for two days beforehand.
COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN
BARBEQUE
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
568-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cookery.
Their simple diet of thin-sliced
roasted meat was introduced
in China during the 13th cen
tury. The Chinese added veg
etables and other ingredients,
the cuisine became known as
the "Mongolian Barbeque."
Take a bowl and help your
self to frozen strips of turkey,
lamb, pork and beef. Fresh
vegetables, including shred
ded carrots, onions, celery,
cabbage, bean sprouts and
cilantro, are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque
sauces. Curry, sweet and sour,
lobster, spicy, mild, medium,
hot and extra hot are offered,
and you are encouraged to
create your own combination.
The atmosphere of Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighboor
hood cafes. The services are
courteous, and made some
what more charming by the
fact that no one spoke English
very well. Col. Lee's might just
be the ticket if you are looking
for something truly unusual.
THE DUTCH GOOSE
1567 Alameda de las Pugas
Menlo park
854-3245
The Goose joins the com
pany of Zots and the O as a
place to get beer and burgers.
Saturday nights are especially
tun there, as the estab
lishment seems entirely popu
lated by Stanford students.
There are peanut shells and
sawdust on the floor. The at
mosphere is reminiscent of
Pop's Malt Shop from Archie
Comics, after a crew of loggers
has rolled through, that is.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Avenue
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant — somewhere in be
a French country inn and
an exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered world
of starched linen, fresh flowers
and candlelight and wine. Not
that the food isn't good — it is,
but it's the ambiance, not the
cuisine, that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such as
Beef Wellington ($11) and Stuf
fed Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of as
sorted fruits, cheeses, meats,
seafood and bread ($l2 for
two; $6.50 for one) provide a

easily triumph over your

The Gatehouse is open for
