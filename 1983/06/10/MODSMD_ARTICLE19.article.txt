I Occupying a corner on El
tamino Real and San Antonio
Road in Los Altos, Chef Chu's
lestaurant has thrived since its
fcpening in 1969. According to
pwner and chef de cuisine,
Larry Chu, the popular restau
rant has been enlarged five
Rimes to accommodate the
growing number of eager pa
trons.
The restaurant is usually
quite crowded, especially dur
ing weekday lunch hours and
Friday and Saturday dinner
hours. Although the waiting
area is small and sparsely fur
nished, there is a wonderful
window through which pa
trons can watch a dozen chefs
preparing woksful of wonder
ful Chinese food. The walls are
adorned with interesting pho
tographs, reviews, historical
data regarding the restaurant,
menus and a list of daily spe
cials. There are also notices of
cooking classes that Chef Chu
conducts and of special ten to
twelve course gourmet ban
quets.
The restaurant consists of
several rooms, each different
form the others and attesting
to the five stages of expansion.
Each room is somewhat clut

tered and crowded. The crowd
is noisy, and I think at ease and
enjoying the food, even
though the general atmos
phere leaves something to be
desired.
The food is varied with Szec
huan, Mandarin, Hunan and
Cantonese dishes on the
menu. Even though most of the
offerings are good, many are
not great. I have discovered,
however, some exceptional
dishes that I enthusiastically
recommend. You can't go
wrong on the appetizers. They
are not very expensive and
they are all very good. The Kuo
Teh (potstickers) are wonder
ful and the Mandarin Tidbits
plate is an excellent order if
you want to try several ap
petizers.
Recently I had dinner at Chef
Chu's with eight friends. We
had a feast for approximately
$9 per person. We ordered a la
carte with several items from
the gourmet menu and with
one item from the daily spe
cials. We started out with two
orders of kuo teh and an order
of won tons and a Mandarin
Tidbit plate. Then we were
served a crisp Chinese chicken
salad, which was thoroughly en
joyed. We also got a big bowl
of steamed white rice. Next
came Mu Shu Pork, which is
sort of a make-your-own
sandwich. First you put a

square of thin "pancake" on
your plate. Next you brush
hoisin sauce onto the "pan
cake'' with a scallion
"paintbrush." Next, putoneor
two spoonsful of the stir fried
filling on top of this, add the
scallion, roll up like a crepe,
and eat!
The next course was crispy
shrimp balls in a bird's nest.
This dish got raves and disap
peared in minutes, including
the delicate fried potato
"nest." Minced pork with let
tuce leaf cups was the next
item, and it was devoured with
equal gusto. The minced pork
had been stir fried with water
chestnuts and other vegetables
and spices, all finely minced.
The whole dish was topped
with a generous amount of
diced peanuts and served with
crisp whole lettuce leaves. The
minced pork, which was spicy,
was eaten in the lettuce cups,
like a taco, and the difference
in textures and contrast of hot
and cool was delightful.
Lover's prawns, a platter of
prawns prepared in two
different ways, is served with
each different dish side by
side, divided by slices of fresh
tomato. Half the prawns are
sauteed in a wine sauce and are
very mild. The other half is
prepared with tomato sauce,
chili paste and garlic and is
spicy. This dish, like the

minced pork in the lettuce leaf
cups, was especially good be
cause of its contrasting and
complementing characteris
tics.
For our final dish we enjoyed
the Pekingduckwith Mandarin
pancakes. This is an excellent
dish, which Chef Chu prepares
with a time-consuming and
unusual process. It isoneof his
specialties, and we concur, it is
a duck dish well done! How
ever, if I were ordering a feast
again, I might not order both
Peking duck and mu shu pork
at the same meal, because they
are served in a similar manner,
with meat on a roll or pancake
brushed with hoisin sauce.
Recommended as an addition
al dish is the mild lemon
chicken. Whole chicken
breasts are dipped in a special
batter, deep-fried until crunchy
and glazed with lemon sauce. I
also recommend kung pao
chicken, which is diced
chicken sauteed with chili
peppers, bamboo shoots, and
water chestnuts in a hot and
spicy sauce. The dish is topped
with crunchy peanuts, and is
somewhat similar to the minced
pork with lettuce cups, but
minus the lettuce. The mongo
lian beef, slices of tender beef
sauteed with scallions and
ginger, is also delicious. The
hot and sour soup and the won
ton soup are excellent, but my

favorite is fish blossom soup.
Boiling hot, steaming chicken
broth full of vegetables is
brought to the table. A platter
full of raw white fish filets is
also brought to the table and
these filets are gently put on
top of the hot soup, and they
cook before your eyes. This
soup sometimes appears as a
daily special or can be specially
ordered.
Dinners are served with tea
and a fortune cookie for de
ssert. There are a few desserts
listed on the menu, but none is
exceptional.
If you order selectively and
are unafraid to try daily spe
cials,you will findthatdiningat
Chef Chu's is a unique experi
ence. The food is of good qual
ity, the preparation done with
finesse and expertise, and the
results delicious. Chef Larry
Chu is enthusiastic and per
sonable, and he often greets
guests and gladly makes menu
recommendations. He re
cently wrote a cookbook called
Chef Chu's Distinctive Cuisine
of China. He has copies of
these on hand which he is
happy to sell and autograph for
his customers. If you enjoy
creatively prepared and gas
tronomically pleasing Chinese
cuisine, don't miss dining at
Chef Chu's.
