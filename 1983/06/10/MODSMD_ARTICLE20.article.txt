It's easy to forget, while eat
ing at Sundance Mine Com
pany, that you're in Palo Alto.
Sundance is a solid, dark,
slightly corporate-feeling res
taurant of a type common
farther up the peninsula, in
Menlo Park and Burlingame. It
makes certain concessions to
Palo Alto's trendy/counter
culture ambiance: it's smal
ler than a Velvet Turtle or a
Borel's (or a Ming's, for that
matter), and it's big on wood —
bare wood everywhere you
| look, the hard look rather than
the plush.
It doesn't compromise its
menu, though. You have three

choices at Sundance — beef,
seafood and chicken. The two
chicken entrees (piccata, $7.75
and teriyaki, $7.95) are only
there for the occasional cus
tomer not willing to own up to
the fact that he's in as teak and
seafood house in Palo Alto. But
if you're looking for this res
taurant's priorities, the sign
outside says it all: "Prime Rib
— Seafood — Cocktails."
Our meal began with a fried
calamari appetizer, served with
an excellent homemade
cocktail sauce ($3.25). The
squid was a bit rubbery, but the
batter — the most important
part — was fine, light and crisp
and without the fishy taste you
get at most restaurants (like
this one) that don't specialize
in seafood.

(The selection of appetizers
and salads is limited — it's not
really what the restaurant is
about — and runs toward stan
dard "California" items: an ar
tichoke, fried zucchini, potato
skins; among the salads are
hearts of palm, "hearts of
romaine," and a spinach,
bacon and egg. Appetizers are
$2.45 to $4.25, salads $2.95 to
$5.95.)
The menu seafood items in
clude red snapper and rainbow
trout (both charcoal broiled),
sauteed calamari steak "»nd
calamari cutlets, and the stan
dard shellfish ($7.95 to $11.95).
Sundance can cook fish — the
fresh salmon we tried had all
the flavor it should have. It did
seem a bit dry, though, which
may have something to do with

Sundance's use of plain old
charcoal for broiling. Mesquite
may be the latest cliche, but it
does seem to make a
difference; if seafood is your
primary interest, you'll be bet
ter off at the Fish Market.
(That's not to take away from
Sundance; the Fish Market just
happens to be one of the best
restaurants around.)
Finally, the beef. I'm from
lowa, where every little farm
town has it's own good steak
house, so maybe my standards
are high. I usually don't order
prime rib out here, because
hardly anyone knows how to
cook it. Sundance serves a
good prime rib — I couldn't say
for sure, but it may be, as they
claim, the best around. All you
really need to know is that it

was fork-tender and got cola
fast (prime rib isn't something
you can linger over). Prime rib
is easier to cook than steak,
which I never order in Califor
nia, but I've sworn I'll try the
sirloin next time I go to Sun
dance. (Prime rib $9.95 to
$13.95, sirloin $7.95 to $9.95,
filet $12.95, New York strip
$12.75.)
Service at Sundance has
been outstanding every time
I've eaten there (although
there's a tendency for waiters
to hover when they're not
busy).
It's a very pleasant place to
eat, not too dark and not too
noisy, even though the re
modeling led to the removal of
most of the plants that used to
split up the sections.
