# Satsuma: A taste of Japan in Los Altos
## 
### MARIA VELLANI LISA LYNCH 
SATSUMA RESTAURANT
367 State Street
Los Altos
941-5374
Hidden amidst the cluster of
boutiques in downtown Los Al
tos, Satsuma appears to be one
of the best-kept secrets in local
Japanese cuisine. Though the
facade is hardly overpowering
(hardly noticeable, in fact) and
the interior amenities are
sometimes questionable, the
food more than makes up for
the flaws.
Visiting the restaurant early
on a Friday night, we found it to
be almost empty, but tables
filled gradually as we ate. We
were escorted into a booth
which could best be described
as an above-ground pit; all of
the booths at Satsuma give di

ners complete privacy. We
were then given "Japan Air
Lines" menus and a pot of de
licious green tea. The menu,
like the restaurant itself, had a
deceptive facade — the selec
tions offered were hardly
airplane fare.
Japanese dining always
brings to mind an appetizer of
sushi — the traditional
Japanese dish of raw seafood
draped over balls of cold rice.
Though many consider raw fish
to be an unnecessarily exotic
addition to their diet, Satsuma
provides an excellent and de
lectable selection. An order of
the Nigiri plate (about nine dol
lars) provides a fairly complete
selection, and enough sushi
for a minimum of four people.
Individual portions of sushi

can be ordered for a higher
unit cost.
After gorging on Satsuma's
appetizers, we somewhat less
hungrily awaited the three
courses of the meal. All of the
entrees at Satsuma come with a
soup and salad course. The
menu selections feature sun
dry tempura-sukiyaki and
tempura-teriyaki combinations
as well as more exotic dishes
such as eel teriyaki (comes in a
covered tureen). We ordered
the shrimp tempura-chicken
sukiyaki combination and the
shrimp tempura-salmon
teriyaki combo; both were
about eleven dollars.
The soup is served in
covered bowls and with no
soup spoon — it has a delici
ous, rich beef-spice taste and

several non-threatening
chunks of tofu thrown in for
luck. The salad is neither ex
ceptional nor mediocre — it
had an interesting spicy,
gelatinous dressing and crisp
lettuce. Speaking of lettuce,
you get a little pickled scrap of
that rabbit-pleaser along with
some pickled radishes.
The main courses were ex
cellent. The tempura batter
isn't the best I've had but the
shrimp and vegetables hidden
inside are fresh, sweet and
light. The sukiyaki is a Sunday
brunch in itself — a sizable and
sensual tureen of chicken
chunks, more vegetables and a
lot more tofu (this time it
seems to know what it's doing
there.) The salmon teriyaki was
the one disappointment; the

portion was considerably
smaller than the sukiyaki por
tion (all teriyaki portions are
smaller) and the salmon just
didn't seem like being treated
like a teriyaki steak. It wasn't
bad, but was a little on the
heavy side and would have
been better appreciated if we
were famished.
Several hours and several
teapots after we had begun the
meal, we were stuffed, happy
and dreading the now-tight
squeeze out of our dining
booth. For those who fast sev
eral weeks prior to dining, yes,
Virginia, there is a dessert
menu — limited to glass bowls
of fruit in a sugary syrup and
moderate portions of green tea
ice cream. „
