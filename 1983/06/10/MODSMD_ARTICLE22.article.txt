## In search of suburban dining at Golden Spike 
### WILL O'CONNELL 
GOLDEN SPIKE
RESTAURANT
700 Welch Road
Palo Alto
321-8304
Housed in an appropriately
stable-like addition to the Stan
ford Barn, the Golden Spike
restaurant is ideally situated to
contribute to the local
shopping center culture. All
the amenities are here that lure
one to such a locale in the firs',
place: for a slightly inflated
price one is guaranteed unob
trusive professionalism, easy
going eclecticism, and a few
touches of distinguishing
character to seperate it trom
the competing mall mill of din
ing establishments.
The restaurant apparently
caters to experienced, eagle
eyed shoppers familiar with
the ins and outs of parking lot
navigation, for the place is not
readily visible unless one is al
ready in the parking lot. Of
course, the Barn itself is an ob
vious landmark to even the
most befuddled of drivers.
Once one has found one's
way to the entrance — we had
to step through a small hedge
— one will have realized that

the restaurant inhabits a rather
inauthenic looking addition
tacked on to the Barn proper. It
is hard to figure out, at this
point, just what sort of image
the restaurant is trying to pro
ject. The few tables set up al
fresco look a little out of place
crouched next to a rough
darkly stained, rustic exterior
— this with French doors, yet.
The eclecticism continued
with the pleasantly cool inte
rior. With its lofty ceiling and
large, unpartitioned expanse
of tables, the dining area was
rather barn-like. The spacious
ness was, however, broken up
by a rather incongruous lattice
of exposed pipes, painted the
requisite dark brown. There
was a sprinkling of philoden
drons, and — for that historical
touch—a few old railroading
photographs grace the walls. A
large-gauge toy train made a
rather desultory circuit of the
dining area, either amusing or
annoying the diners at unpre
dictable intervals.
The menu offered a truly in
teresting array; there are
multi-garnished hamburgers, a
selection of hot sandwiches,
an assortment of ribs and
steaks, and sophisticated sea

food ranging from frogs legs to
barbecued shark, Fven the ap
petizers, which ranged in price
from 53.25 to $5.75, allowed for
a range in tastes. The Escargots
were beautifully done, piping
hot but not overcooked,
bathed in the traditional garlic
sauce, the spiciness of which
forshadowed what was to be
the dominant motif of the
evening's fare.
A more proletarian selection
from the appetizer list showed
just how far one can take
Potato Skins if one really tries.
For just over $5 we received
enough cheese-and-bacon
slathered skins for four
people, and enough chili spice
in the otherwise tasty skins for
about six diners.
My salad — included in the
price of my entree — also
showed signs of much care in
preparation; it was pleasing to
the eye if unremarkable to the
palate, served with a strangely
thin, but nicely tangy, bleu
cheese dressing. Had I opted
for soup instead, I could have
plowed through split pea so
thick that the spoon left a
semi-permanent wake, with a
pleasant, standard pea-soup
taste.

By the time we were ready
for the main course, my com
panion and I were consid
erably less hungry than when
we had arrived. On an oppres
sively hot evening, with a con
siderable quantity of spicy
food already stowed away, I
was hoping for something light
and delicate. The waiter had
especially recommended the
sauteed prawns ($9.95), and I
took him up on his suggestion
since nowhere will you get an
order of prawns sufficiently
large to fill you up Still think
ing light and fluffy, ! chose a
bed ol rice for my littl< prawns
in lieu of a baked potato.
Alas, the nicely sauteed
prawns, although only
medium sized, proved to be
more numerous than I could
handle under the circum
stances. The plentiful bed of
rice, although superbly tex
tured, was again too spicy. The
plate was interestingly gar
nished with cantaloupe slices;
someone had added a few
broccoli spears, seemingly as
an afterthought.
After conquering our en
trees — my companion found

•he stuffed sole to be a c
weighty arid overwhelming as
my choice — we split a slice of
half-frozen, but soothing, mud
pie. The house blend was nice
but unremarkable.
1 hroughout the evening, the
service had been smooth and
almost intimidalinglv compe
tent; the waiter had so much
professional reserve that fie
seemed almost an apparition in
the nearly empty restaurant.
indeed, my overall impres
sion of the Golden Spike is that
there is a touch of overkill
about the place. The people
there are so competent that
one wishes they had more to
work with; perhaps a smaller
quantity of a wider variety of
spices, or a clientelle drawn
from elsewhere than a shop
ping center. As it is, the Golden
Spike is better than a lunch
place with delusions of grand
eur, but its intentions are too
vague to classify it as an above
the-fold evening dining estab
lishment: the spirit of subur
ban shoppers, unfortunately,
predominates.

but unremarkable.
1 hroughout the evening, the
service had been smooth and

tent; the waiter had so much
professional reserve that fie
seemed almost an apparition in

indeed, my overall impres
sion of the Golden Spike is that
there is a touch of overkill
about the place. The people
there are so competent that
one wishes they had more to
work with; perhaps a smaller
quantity of a wider variety of
spices, or a clientelle drawn
from elsewhere than a shop
ping center. As it is, the Golden
Spike is better than a lunch

GOLDEN SPIKE
RESTAURANT
700 Welch Road
Palo Alto
321-8304
Housed in an appropriately
stable-like addition to the Stan
ford Barn, the Golden Spike
restaurant is ideally situated to
contribute to the local
shopping center culture. All
the amenities are here that lure
one to such a locale in the firs',
place: for a slightly inflated
price one is guaranteed unob
trusive professionalism, easy
going eclecticism, and a few
touches of distinguishing
character to seperate it trom
the competing mall mill of din
ing establishments.
The restaurant apparently
caters to experienced, eagle
eyed shoppers familiar with
the ins and outs of parking lot
navigation, for the place is not
readily visible unless one is al
ready in the parking lot. Of
course, the Barn itself is an ob
vious landmark to even the
most befuddled of drivers.
Once one has found one's
way to the entrance — we had
to step through a small hedge
— one will have realized that

the restaurant inhabits a rather
inauthenic looking addition
tacked on to the Barn proper. It
is hard to figure out, at this
point, just what sort of image
the restaurant is trying to pro
ject. The few tables set up al
fresco look a little out of place
crouched next to a rough
darkly stained, rustic exterior
— this with French doors, yet.
The eclecticism continued
with the pleasantly cool inte
rior. With its lofty ceiling and
large, unpartitioned expanse
of tables, the dining area was
rather barn-like. The spacious
ness was, however, broken up
by a rather incongruous lattice
of exposed pipes, painted the
requisite dark brown. There
was a sprinkling of philoden
drons, and — for that historical
touch—a few old railroading
photographs grace the walls. A
large-gauge toy train made a
rather desultory circuit of the
dining area, either amusing or
annoying the diners at unpre
dictable intervals.
The menu offered a truly in
teresting array; there are
multi-garnished hamburgers, a
selection of hot sandwiches,
an assortment of ribs and
steaks, and sophisticated sea

food ranging from frogs legs to
barbecued shark, Fven the ap
petizers, which ranged in price
from 53.25 to $5.75, allowed for
a range in tastes. The Escargots
were beautifully done, piping
hot but not overcooked,
bathed in the traditional garlic
sauce, the spiciness of which
forshadowed what was to be
the dominant motif of the
evening's fare.
A more proletarian selection
from the appetizer list showed
just how far one can take
Potato Skins if one really tries.
For just over $5 we received
enough cheese-and-bacon
slathered skins for four
people, and enough chili spice
in the otherwise tasty skins for
about six diners.
My salad — included in the
price of my entree — also
showed signs of much care in
preparation; it was pleasing to
the eye if unremarkable to the
palate, served with a strangely
thin, but nicely tangy, bleu
cheese dressing. Had I opted
for soup instead, I could have
plowed through split pea so
thick that the spoon left a
semi-permanent wake, with a
pleasant, standard pea-soup
taste.

By the time we were ready
for the main course, my com
panion and I were consid
erably less hungry than when
we had arrived. On an oppres
sively hot evening, with a con
siderable quantity of spicy
food already stowed away, I
was hoping for something light
and delicate. The waiter had
especially recommended the
sauteed prawns ($9.95), and I
took him up on his suggestion
since nowhere will you get an
order of prawns sufficiently
large to fill you up Still think
ing light and fluffy, ! chose a
bed ol rice for my littl< prawns
in lieu of a baked potato.
Alas, the nicely sauteed
prawns, although only
medium sized, proved to be
more numerous than I could
handle under the circum
stances. The plentiful bed of
rice, although superbly tex
tured, was again too spicy. The
plate was interestingly gar
nished with cantaloupe slices;
someone had added a few
broccoli spears, seemingly as
an afterthought.
After conquering our en
trees — my companion found

•he stuffed sole to be a c
weighty arid overwhelming as
my choice — we split a slice of
half-frozen, but soothing, mud
pie. The house blend was nice
but unremarkable.
