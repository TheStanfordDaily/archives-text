Ninotchka (1939) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
This wonderful comedy has
some of the most memorable
moments in any film of its
epoch: the scene in which the
amorous Parisian (dashing
Melvvn Douglas) tells the Rus
sian visitor, Ninotchka (Greta
Garbo), that he has an ir
resistible desire to flirt with her
and she replies, "Suppress it";
the scene in which he gives her
champagne for the first time;
the scene in which he gets her
to laugh. Garbo gives a warm,
deeply felt performance as the
young woman sent by the Sovi
et government to reclaim
jewels currently in the
possession of an imperial
emigre (played with ex
traordinary finesse by Ina
Claire) — after the original em
issaries (Sig Rumann, Alexander
Granach and Felix Bressart)
have succumbed to the tempta
tions of heady Parisian
bourgeois living. The
screenplay by Charles Brackett,
Billy Wilder and Walter Reisch
(from a Melchior Lengyel story)
manages to sustain a tone that is
at once mocking and romantic,
and the director, Ernst Lubitsch,
has never seemed so complete
ly, humanly, in control — ex
cept, perhaps, in the following
year's The Shop Around the
Corner. With Bela Lugosi.
Plays with Intermezzo.
Return of the Jedi
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
It certainly comes equipped
with a cornucopia of audience
pleasing gimmicks, but you may
feel as if the director, Richard
Marquand, and the writers,
George Lucas (who also con
ceived and produced it) and
Lawrence Kasdan, were shov
ing lollipops down your throat.
Lucas' story fits a worthy finale
to the Star Wars epic, with a
number of high-gearemotional
set pieces provided, but under
Marquand's direction these
scenes read as long, tiresome
gaps in the action Marquand
can keep his camera moving in
the battle episodes, but he
doesn't know what to do when
the action stops; his tone sticks
somewhere between per
functoriness and obeisance. He
gives us far too much time to
think aboutthedumbdialogue,
and he strands the actors, who
are even worse than they were
in Star Wars. And despite all the
noise and motion, ledi has only
one exceptional action se
quence — an air bike chase
through the woods. The cast
features Mark Hamill, Harrison
Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee
Williams, Sebastian Shaw as
Anakin Skywalker and lan
McDiarmid as the evil Emperor.
Local Hero *
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Utterly charming. That clever
minimalist comic actor, Peter
Riegert, plays an oil company
executive who flies to Scotland
to buy up a village so that his
firm can set up a refinery on the
land — and the village turns out
to be almost as magical as Briga
doon. Living in a breathtaking
landscape, under a showplace
sky where meteor showers
erupt and the aurora borealis
makes guest appearances, the
citizens have established an en
tirely peaceful, laissez-faire so
ciety where a very strange mix
of people co-exist harmo
niously. The Scottish writer-di
rector, Bill Forsyth, keeps his
camera at a discreet distance, so
that what happens upon screen
seems peculiarly self-con
tained, and the unrushed
scenes snap back at you with a
delayed comic spring. The cast
is impeccable; among its gems
are Denis Lawson, Peter
Capaldi, and especially Burt
Lancaster. He's only in a few
scenes (he plays the oil com
pany chief) but he embodies
the quirkily benevolent spirit of
the movie.

Say Amen, Somebody
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Watching the two ir
repressible oldsters at the cen
ter of this documentary —
Thomas A Dorsey, the "father
of gospel music," and his prize
pupil, Willie Mae Ford Smith —
you get the feeling that George
T. Nierenberg, the producer
director, caught the last ves
tiges of first-generation gospel.
One of the many pleasures of
this movie is that if you are un
familiar with old-time gospel,
you find out how amazing the
best of it is, and you see the
links to jazz, blues and show
music. Nierenberg, a smart
documentarian with a sense of
irony, has captured seme love
ly, unpredictable moments as
well as some overpowering mu
sical performances. With Delois
Barrett Campbell and the Bar
rett Sisters, Zella Jackson Price,
and the O'Neal Twins.
Max Dugan Returns
Stanford, Palo Alto
Not torture, but you feel af
terwards as if you'd killed a cou
ple of brain cells. Jason Robards
lends his welcome presence to
the role of a dying renegade
who forces his estranged
daughter (Marsha Mason), a
widow schoolteacher, and her
teenage son (Matthew
Broderick), to adopt him and
then wins their hearts. Mason is
worse than usual (and she's
usually pretty uninspired), and
Donald Sutherland, miscast as
an L.A. cop, looks like he can't
figure out why the director,
Herbert Ross, cast them op
posite each other. He's not
alone. The screenwriter, as if
you needed to be told, is Neil
Simon.
Plays with The Man from
Snowy River.
Oas Boot
Fox, Redwood City
A solidly crafted movie by
German director Wolfgang Pe
terson, distinguished from oth
er World War II U-boat pictures
by its perspective: almost the
entire film is shot within the
submarine, so we experience
the attacks of the the British
vessels as the crew of the boat
does. The picture is also a small,
funny essay on the horrors of
intimate communal living, but
when it veers off into character
detail or observations of con
flict between humanitarian and
political ideals, it becomes a lit
tle pretentious. The downer of
an ending is a cheat.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Eye of (he Needle.

Phantom of the Paradise
(1974) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Brian De Palma made this
wild, hilarious spoof of horror
movies and rock singers — ap
parently with the kind of free
dom he enjoyed in his under
ground movie days. The plot is
basically modelled on The
Phantom of the Opera, with
Paul Williams (who wrote the
satirical songs, which are, sur
prisingly, wickedly clever) as
the impressario, Jessica Harper
as the promising young singer,
and William Finley as the
brilliant composer who is
turned into a monster and re
sides in the upper reaches of
the theater. In this case, the
composer's work is a "pop can
tata" version of Faust, and De
Palma (who wrote as well as
directed) plays on Faust almost
as much as on The Phantom: on
one level the composer
Winslow is Faust and the im
pressario Swan
Mephistopheles, and on anoth
er — an ingenious extension —
this Mephistopheles is also his
own Faust. The movie is replete
with visual and vocal refer
ences: there are borrowings
from The Picture of Dorian
Cray, Psycho, The Godfather,
The Manchurian Candidate
and even Bye Bye Birdie. The
unusually winning cast also in
cludes Gerrit Graham as a pop
idol and, as three different rock
trios, Harold Oblong, Jeffrey
Comanor and Archie Hahn.
Watch out for Jessica Harper's
audition number, "Special to
Me"; aside from Pennies from
Heaven, it's the best (and
toughest) thing she's ever
done.
Plays today with The Rockyi
Horror Picture Show.

Blue Thunder
Old Mill 6, Mountain View
The title refers to a super
equipped helicopter being
tested by LAPD aerial cops
Murphy (Roy Scheider) and
Lymangood (Daniel Stern), and
from the moment it is in
troduced against a red sun, like
a huge, other-worldly, metallic
tarantula, and the music soars,
we understand where the emo
tional focus of the movie is.
That helicopter upstages all of
the actors except the late
Warren Oates, who plays
Murphy and Lymangood's
chief as the closest human
equivalent to a bulldog. John
Badham's film isn't terrible, but
it's terribly mediocre. The ac
tion sequences are assembled
in an efficient, workmanlike
manner, like visual instruction
manuals, but the plotting (Dan
O'Bannon and Don Jakoby
wrote the script) is crimped and
confusing. With Malcolm
McDowell, giving a certified
bad performance as a huffy Brit
ish villain associated with a
fascist organization working
through the LAPD.

La Traviata
Guild, Menlo Park
It may be a long time before
you'll hear a Traviata so well
sung (by Teresa Stratas, Placido
Domingo, Cornell MacNeil and
others) and conducted (by the
Met's James Levine), but you
have to contend with director
Franco Zeffirelli's imagination,
which is 19th-century in the
worst way: he turns everything
into confectionery. When this
Violetta tells Germont she's
been happy with his son
Alfredo, she gazes at a cage of
doves; when she tries to decide
between a life of heedless
pleasure and true love, images
of Alfredo confront her in every
doorway. Since Zeffirelli has
ensured that the decor will up
stage the singers in every scene,
it's not surprising that we keep
forgetting about the drama and
getting caught up in other
questions, like who in Paris has
enough money to keep Violetta
in a mansion the size of Ver
sailles, and why doesn't she
have more than one servant?
Teresa Stratas certainly looks
the role of the consumptive
dame aux camelias, and she can
act it, too (though Zeffirelli lets
her overact), but Domingo just
pulls with overemphatic virility
at his coat lapels and screws his
face up to express despair. (He
also looks about 10 years
younger than his "father," Cor
nell MacNeil.) Yes, yes, the Ver
dimusic is divine, but you have
to go to this movie in a mood of
real romantic abandon in order
to survive it without giggling.
The Dark Crystal
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jim Henson's plot (dramat
ized by David Odell) concerns
the efforts of Jim, a "gelfling,"
to recover the lost shard of an
indigo-colored crystal that de
termines the power of whoever
possesses it, and thus free the
land from the tyranny of the
dreaded Skeksis. Despite all the
steals from Norse mythology by
way of Tolkien, and from The
Wizard of Oz and even The Pic
ture of Dorian Gray, this Mup
pet-populated movie lacks the
requisite magical dimension.
Some of the creatures Brian
Froud has designed are won
derful to watch, but the good
guys have been constructed
much less imaginatively than
the monsters; the action se
quences are claustrophobic;
' and the major set pieces are vis
ually insubstantial. Muppet
i masters Henson and Frank Oz
co-directed.
Plays tomorrow with The
Lord of the Rings.
