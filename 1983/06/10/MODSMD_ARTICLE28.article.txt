Welcome to Stanford and welcome to the Summer Vis
itor's Guide.
Whether you're a visiting scholar here for research or a
visiting valley girl here for the, Oh My Cod, annual cheer
leader camp, we hope the Summer Visitor's Guide will help
you to enjoy your stay.
What is the Summer Visitor's Guide? It's a special publi
cation of The Stanford Daily designed to help you, the
summer visitor, to get the most out of your visit to the Farm.
In the next 20 or so pages you'll find, in addition to a lot of
ads, everything from the history of Stanford and a listing of
summer concerts in the area to some of our favorite restau
rants and an English-Stanford dictionary to help you keep
your Mem Chu's straight from your Hoo Tow's.
If all this seems confusing at first, relax. It should. Stan
ford is a big contusing place that takes some getting used
to. (After a year here, I'm still lost most of the time.) Take
one of the tours offered daily by the Guide and Visitor -,
service (see page 3) to get your bearings straight and in no
time at all you'll know where you are at least half of the
time.
And once you know where you are, you should know
where we are. The Daily awaits you at the corner of Lorruta
Drive and Santa Teresa Street in the Storke Publications
building. Drop by and pick up a story assignment for the
summer Daily (published on Tuesdays and Fridays begin
ning June 21) or just drop by and say hi. We'd love to see
you.
Especially if you're a visiting valley girl here for a cheer
leader camp.
