# STANFORD
## No need for breadcrumbs A
						campus tour will help you find your way through the Farm and back home again 
### 
For newcomers to the Farm, Stanford
can be a maze of sandstone buildings
with no way out. But don't despair; a
campus tour will help you get your
bearings straight. And the best news
is. . . the tours are all free.
The Guide and Visitor's service offers
the best general campus tour. You'll
see the Quadrangle, Memorial Church,
the Physics Tank, Terman Engineering
Center and just about everything else

on the main part of the campus.
Unfortunately, however, the tour will
not take you up inside Hoover lower.
The Tower is temporarily closed for re
pairs and the addition of a fire sprinkler
system. It will not re-open until this fall
at the earliest.
The C jide and Visitor's service tours
are led by Stanford students who aren't
afraid to "tell it like it is," so you'll get to

see Stanford from the student perspec
tive.
The tours begin at the front of the
Quadrangle at the information booth
Monday through Saturday at 11:00 a.m.
and2:lsp.m.; Sundays 2:15 p.m.
Once you know your way around
campus, you may want to take a more
specialized tour.
You may, for example, tour the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)

where research goes on in the scientific
vein Call 32H-2204 for tour times and
reservations.
You may also tour the Stanford Medi
cal Center. Call 497-5028 for more in
formation there.
Finally, the Leland Stanford |r.
Museum and the Stanford Art Gallery
both offer tours. See pages eight and
nine for more information.
