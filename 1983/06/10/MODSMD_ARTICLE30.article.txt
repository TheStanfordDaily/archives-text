# From Farm to University

When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the sum
mer of 1891 to be the Universi
ty's first president, he found
the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of
San Francisco Bay. Bounding it
on the southwest rises. . .the
Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously'. . .
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its

cloak of redwood, oak and
madrono diversified by thic
kets of chemisal. . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30
miles south of San Francisco,
its favorable climate assured by
its situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.

The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek
and subsequent purchases ran
the total of 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the Univer
sity in the 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation
that it should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stan
ford brought Francis Walker,
president of Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology and the
prominent landscape ar
chitect, Frederick Law Olm
sted, in the summer of 1886.

Grainfield site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the
foothills of the ranch, so as to
take advantage of the magnifi
cent view of the Bay, but they
finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below,
at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quad
rangle. The senator felt that the
flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the
general concept for the
grounds and the buildings, but
it remained for the young Bos
ton architect, Charles Allerton

Collidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent
architect of his time.
The style is called Richard
sonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanes
que, which is characterized by
rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half
circle arches supported by
short columns with decorated
capitals.
