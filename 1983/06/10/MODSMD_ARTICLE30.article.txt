# From Farm to University
## ..any place that was good for raising race horses ought to be good for students.' 
### 
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the sum
mer of 1891 to be the Universi
ty's first president, he found
the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of
San Francisco Bay. Bounding it
on the southwest rises. . .the
Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously'. . .
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its

cloak of redwood, oak and
madrono diversified by thic
kets of chemisal. . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30
miles south of San Francisco,
its favorable climate assured by
its situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.

The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek
and subsequent purchases ran
the total of 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the Univer
sity in the 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation
that it should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stan
ford brought Francis Walker,
president of Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology and the
prominent landscape ar
chitect, Frederick Law Olm
sted, in the summer of 1886.

Grainfield site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the
foothills of the ranch, so as to
take advantage of the magnifi
cent view of the Bay, but they
finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below,
at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quad
rangle. The senator felt that the
flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the
general concept for the
grounds and the buildings, but
it remained for the young Bos
ton architect, Charles Allerton

Collidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent
architect of his time.
The style is called Richard
sonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanes
que, which is characterized by
rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half
circle arches supported by
short columns with decorated
capitals.
The inner quad of 12 class
room buildings — with the


Greg Webb/Daily
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church —
and three engineering build
ings, Encinca Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were
ready for the University's
opening on October 1, 1891.
" These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew White of
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beauti
ful college architecture in
America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the
morning of April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's
new buildings shook for 45
seconds. The great earthquake
killed two men on campus and
caused millions of dollars of
damage.
The ponderous church
tower, with its clocks, chimes

and spire, crashed into the
chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out
the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the
inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad —
100 feet high and decorated
with a frieze depicting the
march of civilization — was
damaged beyond repair. So
were a library and gymnasium
that were just short of comple
tion. None of these was re
placed.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known
as "the Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pur
suing a construction project
that was begun in 1886 and that
has been intermittently con

tinued up to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the
Stanford land, comprised for
the most part of the central
portion running from El
Camino Real to the back boun
dary in the foothills.
The areas designated for
light use lie in open land, in
cluding the arboretum, golf
course and the foothill lands
used for space-probing anten
nae and research in nuclear
physics and biological sci
ences.
The inner and outer quads
occupy 17 acres at the heart of
the academic area. The inner
quad's 12 classroom buildings,
two of which are now used by
the president and his staff, date
form the time the University
opened in 1891, while the
outer quad was completed in
1903, the same year that

Memorial Church was dedi
cated.
Buildings in the outer quad
are being brought up •>
earthquake-proof standard- by
an "inside-out" process of
construction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of
no particular denomination. In
the Founding Grant, they di
rected the trustees "to have
taught in the University the
immortality of the soul, the
existence of an all wise and be
nevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the
highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and
the University were to be non
sectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
In the orginal plans, the
central site now occupied by
the church was reserved for it,
though construction was de
terred. When Senator Stanford

died in 1893, his widow deter
mined that the church would
be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permis
sion to copy the Roselli fresco
of the "Last supper" in the Sis
tine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depict
ing the history of redemption.
The largest mosaic, however,
occupies most of the facade of
the church and, with 47 fig
ures, depicts the Sermon on
the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around
a steel framework. Another set
of mosaics was brought from
Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes,
was never rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower

and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace — millions of items
that include books, docu
ments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters,
maps and photos. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building,
completed in 1978, honors the
former president's humanita
rian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World
War I when he headed the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him
in a position to document the
war, Hoover shipped crates of
mater.al to the library at Stan
ford, his alma mater, and laid
the literary foundation of the
Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony,
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a
challenge to those who pro-
mote war. They should attract
those who search for peace."
The Institution has more ma
terial on communism than can
be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Be
nito Mussolini than can be
found in Italy. It also probably
has the most complete record
on Adolf Hitler and the Nazi
movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research
on problems of social, political
and economic change in the
20th century.
World War I memorial
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (au
ditorium), dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memeorial
to Stanford students and fac
ulty slain in World War I, the

auditorium also contains in the
toyer plaques honoring the
Stanford dead of World War 11.
The main auditorium seats 1700
and the Little Theatre seats 200.
Just south of the quad is
White Memorial Plaza, a
200,000 square foot landscaped
area donated to the University
by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond
White in memory of their sons.
The focal point of the plaza is a
tall, free-form fountain e<e
cuted in bronze by San Fran
cisco sculptor Aristides De
metrios.
Tresidder, named in mem
ory of Donald Bertrand Tresid
der, alumnus and fourth presi
dent of the University, con
tains the usual student union
facilities of food service, small
store, lounge and student gov
ernment offices.
The Stanford School of
Medicine moved from San

Francisco into its quarters in
1959. The $21 million structure
consists of three sections —
the hospital, the outpatient
clinics and the teaching labora
tories and classrooms.
New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerald Ford
dedicated the $11.9 million
facility. The school resides in
four buildings: the Robert
Crown library, which can seat
the entire law student body at
the same time; Frederick I.
Richman Hall, which contains


Nancy Raff/Daily
the classrooms and moot
court; the lames Irvine Gallery,
which contains the faculty and
student meeting rooms and
lounges; and 600-person
kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus,
the Unversity operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve. Rising
steeply from Searsville Lake,
the 735-acre preserve contains
a unique association of rock
ledges and outcroppings,
oak-dotted savannahs, chapar
ral, redwoods, streams and
pools.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm
one of the most productive and
varied programs of
ionoshperic and interplanetary
radio investigations. Its scien
tists made the first radar con
tact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the
antennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum

"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary
gases by means of a radar
beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along
Sand Hill Road. The $114 mil
lion machine, financed by the
Atomic Energy Commission
and completed in 1966, fires
the electron down a straight,
slender tube rather than whirl
ing protons in circles, as most
atom smashers do.
Stone age crumbles
As the '70s ended, the Un
versity drew to a close its so
called "Second Great Stone
Age," a building boom
launched in the early '60s in
which the University has at
tempted to meet the needs en
gendered by its big post-war
expansion in students and fac
ulty.
Now, however, as the Un
versity stabilizes its popula

tion, it plans fewer major build
ing projects for the next 10
years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least.
However, construction is
nearing completion on a new
music building behind Din
kelspiel Auditorium in White
Plaza. The building will give the
music department more space
than its current home on the
Knoll can offer.

Construction is also underway
on Sterling Quad, the new un
dergraduate dormitories near
Lake Lagunita.
Bui construction projects
such as the new music center
and dormitory do depend
largely on the beneficience of
University donors (including
the federal government), and
in this inflationary age, the
University may have difficulty
raising the necessary funds.
If Stanford does attract the
required support, it might con

tinue to build right through the
100 th anniversary of that day in
188(> when Senator Stanford
decided to locate his new uni
versity on the site of his horse
farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding
horses ought to be good
enough lor teaching students.

tion. None of these was re
placed.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known
as "the Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pur
suing a construction project
that was begun in 1886 and that
has been intermittently con

tinued up to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the
Stanford land, comprised for
the most part of the central
portion running from El
Camino Real to the back boun
dary in the foothills.
The areas designated for
light use lie in open land, in
cluding the arboretum, golf
course and the foothill lands
used for space-probing anten
nae and research in nuclear
physics and biological sci
ences.
The inner and outer quads
occupy 17 acres at the heart of
the academic area. The inner
quad's 12 classroom buildings,
two of which are now used by
the president and his staff, date
form the time the University
opened in 1891, while the
outer quad was completed in
1903, the same year that

Memorial Church was dedi
cated.
Buildings in the outer quad
are being brought up •>
earthquake-proof standard- by
an "inside-out" process of
construction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of
no particular denomination. In
the Founding Grant, they di
rected the trustees "to have
taught in the University the
immortality of the soul, the
existence of an all wise and be
nevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the
highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and
the University were to be non
sectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
In the orginal plans, the
central site now occupied by
the church was reserved for it,
though construction was de
terred. When Senator Stanford

died in 1893, his widow deter
mined that the church would
be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permis
sion to copy the Roselli fresco
of the "Last supper" in the Sis
tine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depict
ing the history of redemption.
The largest mosaic, however,
occupies most of the facade of
the church and, with 47 fig
ures, depicts the Sermon on
the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around
a steel framework. Another set
of mosaics was brought from
Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes,
was never rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower

and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace — millions of items
that include books, docu
ments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters,
maps and photos. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building,
completed in 1978, honors the
former president's humanita
rian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World
War I when he headed the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him
in a position to document the
war, Hoover shipped crates of
mater.al to the library at Stan
ford, his alma mater, and laid
the literary foundation of the
Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony,
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a
challenge to those who pro-
mote war. They should attract
those who search for peace."
The Institution has more ma
terial on communism than can
be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Be
nito Mussolini than can be
found in Italy. It also probably
has the most complete record
on Adolf Hitler and the Nazi
movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research
on problems of social, political
and economic change in the
20th century.
World War I memorial
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (au
ditorium), dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memeorial
to Stanford students and fac
ulty slain in World War I, the

auditorium also contains in the
toyer plaques honoring the
Stanford dead of World War 11.
The main auditorium seats 1700
and the Little Theatre seats 200.
Just south of the quad is
White Memorial Plaza, a
200,000 square foot landscaped
area donated to the University
by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond
White in memory of their sons.
The focal point of the plaza is a
tall, free-form fountain e<e
cuted in bronze by San Fran
cisco sculptor Aristides De
metrios.
Tresidder, named in mem
ory of Donald Bertrand Tresid
der, alumnus and fourth presi
dent of the University, con
tains the usual student union
facilities of food service, small
store, lounge and student gov
ernment offices.
The Stanford School of
Medicine moved from San

Francisco into its quarters in
1959. The $21 million structure
consists of three sections —
the hospital, the outpatient
clinics and the teaching labora
tories and classrooms.
New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerald Ford
dedicated the $11.9 million
facility. The school resides in
four buildings: the Robert
Crown library, which can seat
the entire law student body at
the same time; Frederick I.
Richman Hall, which contains


Nancy Raff/Daily
the classrooms and moot
court; the lames Irvine Gallery,
which contains the faculty and
student meeting rooms and
lounges; and 600-person
kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus,
the Unversity operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve. Rising
steeply from Searsville Lake,
the 735-acre preserve contains
a unique association of rock
ledges and outcroppings,
oak-dotted savannahs, chapar
ral, redwoods, streams and
pools.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm
one of the most productive and
varied programs of
ionoshperic and interplanetary
radio investigations. Its scien
tists made the first radar con
tact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the
antennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum

"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary
gases by means of a radar
beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along
Sand Hill Road. The $114 mil
lion machine, financed by the
Atomic Energy Commission
and completed in 1966, fires
the electron down a straight,
slender tube rather than whirl
ing protons in circles, as most
atom smashers do.
Stone age crumbles
As the '70s ended, the Un
versity drew to a close its so
called "Second Great Stone
Age," a building boom
launched in the early '60s in
which the University has at
tempted to meet the needs en
gendered by its big post-war
expansion in students and fac
ulty.
Now, however, as the Un
versity stabilizes its popula

tion, it plans fewer major build
ing projects for the next 10
years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least.
However, construction is
nearing completion on a new
music building behind Din
kelspiel Auditorium in White
Plaza. The building will give the
music department more space
than its current home on the
Knoll can offer.

Construction is also underway
on Sterling Quad, the new un
dergraduate dormitories near
Lake Lagunita.
Bui construction projects
such as the new music center
and dormitory do depend
largely on the beneficience of
University donors (including
the federal government), and
in this inflationary age, the
University may have difficulty
raising the necessary funds.
If Stanford does attract the
required support, it might con

tinue to build right through the
100 th anniversary of that day in
188(> when Senator Stanford
decided to locate his new uni
versity on the site of his horse
farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding
horses ought to be good
enough lor teaching students.

Scott Chan/Daily
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the sum
mer of 1891 to be the Universi
ty's first president, he found
the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of
San Francisco Bay. Bounding it
on the southwest rises. . .the
Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously'. . .
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its

cloak of redwood, oak and
madrono diversified by thic
kets of chemisal. . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30
miles south of San Francisco,
its favorable climate assured by
its situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.

The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek
and subsequent purchases ran
the total of 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the Univer
sity in the 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation
that it should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stan
ford brought Francis Walker,
president of Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology and the
prominent landscape ar
chitect, Frederick Law Olm
sted, in the summer of 1886.

Grainfield site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the
foothills of the ranch, so as to
take advantage of the magnifi
cent view of the Bay, but they
finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below,
at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quad
rangle. The senator felt that the
flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the
general concept for the
grounds and the buildings, but
it remained for the young Bos
ton architect, Charles Allerton

Collidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent
architect of his time.
The style is called Richard
sonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanes
que, which is characterized by
rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half
circle arches supported by
short columns with decorated
capitals.
The inner quad of 12 class
room buildings — with the


Greg Webb/Daily
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church —
and three engineering build
ings, Encinca Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were
ready for the University's
opening on October 1, 1891.
" These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew White of
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beauti
ful college architecture in
America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the
morning of April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's
new buildings shook for 45
seconds. The great earthquake
killed two men on campus and
caused millions of dollars of
damage.
The ponderous church
tower, with its clocks, chimes

and spire, crashed into the
chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out
the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the
inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad —
100 feet high and decorated
with a frieze depicting the
march of civilization — was
damaged beyond repair. So
were a library and gymnasium
that were just short of comple
tion. None of these was re
placed.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known

mote war. They should attract
those who search for peace."
The Institution has more ma
terial on communism than can
be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Be
nito Mussolini than can be
found in Italy. It also probably
has the most complete record
on Adolf Hitler and the Nazi
movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research
on problems of social, political
and economic change in the
20th century.
World War I memorial
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (au
ditorium), dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memeorial
to Stanford students and fac
ulty slain in World War I, the

auditorium also contains in the
toyer plaques honoring the
Stanford dead of World War 11.
The main auditorium seats 1700
and the Little Theatre seats 200.
Just south of the quad is
White Memorial Plaza, a
200,000 square foot landscaped
area donated to the University
by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond
White in memory of their sons.
The focal point of the plaza is a
tall, free-form fountain e<e
cuted in bronze by San Fran
cisco sculptor Aristides De
metrios.
Tresidder, named in mem
ory of Donald Bertrand Tresid
der, alumnus and fourth presi
dent of the University, con
tains the usual student union
facilities of food service, small
store, lounge and student gov
ernment offices.
The Stanford School of
Medicine moved from San

Francisco into its quarters in
1959. The $21 million structure
consists of three sections —
the hospital, the outpatient
clinics and the teaching labora
tories and classrooms.
New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerald Ford
dedicated the $11.9 million
facility. The school resides in
four buildings: the Robert
Crown library, which can seat
the entire law student body at
the same time; Frederick I.
Richman Hall, which contains


Nancy Raff/Daily
the classrooms and moot
court; the lames Irvine Gallery,
which contains the faculty and
student meeting rooms and
lounges; and 600-person
kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus,
the Unversity operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve. Rising
steeply from Searsville Lake,
the 735-acre preserve contains
a unique association of rock
ledges and outcroppings,
oak-dotted savannahs, chapar
ral, redwoods, streams and
pools.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm
one of the most productive and
varied programs of
ionoshperic and interplanetary
radio investigations. Its scien
tists made the first radar con
tact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the
antennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum

"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary
gases by means of a radar
beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along
Sand Hill Road. The $114 mil
lion machine, financed by the
Atomic Energy Commission
and completed in 1966, fires
the electron down a straight,
slender tube rather than whirl
ing protons in circles, as most
atom smashers do.
Stone age crumbles
As the '70s ended, the Un
versity drew to a close its so
called "Second Great Stone
Age," a building boom
launched in the early '60s in
which the University has at
tempted to meet the needs en
gendered by its big post-war
expansion in students and fac
ulty.
Now, however, as the Un
versity stabilizes its popula

tion, it plans fewer major build
ing projects for the next 10
years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least.
However, construction is
nearing completion on a new
music building behind Din
kelspiel Auditorium in White
Plaza. The building will give the
music department more space
than its current home on the
Knoll can offer.

Construction is also underway
on Sterling Quad, the new un
dergraduate dormitories near
Lake Lagunita.
Bui construction projects
such as the new music center
and dormitory do depend
largely on the beneficience of
University donors (including
the federal government), and
in this inflationary age, the
University may have difficulty
raising the necessary funds.
If Stanford does attract the
required support, it might con

tinue to build right through the
100 th anniversary of that day in
188(> when Senator Stanford
decided to locate his new uni
versity on the site of his horse
farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding
horses ought to be good
enough lor teaching students.

Scott Chan/Daily
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the sum
mer of 1891 to be the Universi
ty's first president, he found
the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of
San Francisco Bay. Bounding it
on the southwest rises. . .the
Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously'. . .
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its

cloak of redwood, oak and
madrono diversified by thic
kets of chemisal. . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30
miles south of San Francisco,
its favorable climate assured by
its situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.

The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek
and subsequent purchases ran
the total of 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the Univer
sity in the 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation
that it should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stan
ford brought Francis Walker,
president of Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology and the
prominent landscape ar
chitect, Frederick Law Olm
sted, in the summer of 1886.

Grainfield site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the
foothills of the ranch, so as to
take advantage of the magnifi
cent view of the Bay, but they
finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below,
at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quad
rangle. The senator felt that the
flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the
general concept for the
grounds and the buildings, but
it remained for the young Bos
ton architect, Charles Allerton

Collidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent
architect of his time.
The style is called Richard
sonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanes
que, which is characterized by
rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half
circle arches supported by
short columns with decorated
capitals.
The inner quad of 12 class
room buildings — with the


Greg Webb/Daily
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church —
and three engineering build
ings, Encinca Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were
ready for the University's
opening on October 1, 1891.
" These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew White of
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beauti
ful college architecture in
America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the
morning of April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's
new buildings shook for 45
seconds. The great earthquake
killed two men on campus and
caused millions of dollars of
damage.
The ponderous church
tower, with its clocks, chimes

and spire, crashed into the
chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out
the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the
inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad —
100 feet high and decorated
with a frieze depicting the
march of civilization — was
damaged beyond repair. So
were a library and gymnasium
that were just short of comple
tion. None of these was re
placed.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known
as "the Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pur
suing a construction project
that was begun in 1886 and that
has been intermittently con

tinued up to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the
Stanford land, comprised for
the most part of the central
portion running from El
Camino Real to the back boun
dary in the foothills.
The areas designated for
light use lie in open land, in
cluding the arboretum, golf
course and the foothill lands
used for space-probing anten
nae and research in nuclear
physics and biological sci
ences.
The inner and outer quads
occupy 17 acres at the heart of
the academic area. The inner
quad's 12 classroom buildings,
two of which are now used by
the president and his staff, date
form the time the University
opened in 1891, while the
outer quad was completed in
1903, the same year that

Memorial Church was dedi
cated.
Buildings in the outer quad
are being brought up •>
earthquake-proof standard- by
an "inside-out" process of
construction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of
no particular denomination. In
the Founding Grant, they di
rected the trustees "to have
taught in the University the
immortality of the soul, the
existence of an all wise and be
nevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the
highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and
the University were to be non
sectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
In the orginal plans, the
central site now occupied by
the church was reserved for it,
though construction was de
terred. When Senator Stanford

died in 1893, his widow deter
mined that the church would
be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permis
sion to copy the Roselli fresco
of the "Last supper" in the Sis
tine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depict
ing the history of redemption.
The largest mosaic, however,
occupies most of the facade of
the church and, with 47 fig
ures, depicts the Sermon on
the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around
a steel framework. Another set
of mosaics was brought from
Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes,
was never rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower

and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace — millions of items
that include books, docu
ments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters,
maps and photos. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building,
completed in 1978, honors the
former president's humanita
rian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World
War I when he headed the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him
in a position to document the
war, Hoover shipped crates of
mater.al to the library at Stan
ford, his alma mater, and laid
the literary foundation of the
Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony,
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a
challenge to those who pro-
mote war. They should attract
those who search for peace."
The Institution has more ma
terial on communism than can
be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Be
nito Mussolini than can be
found in Italy. It also probably
has the most complete record
on Adolf Hitler and the Nazi
movement extant.
With these resources, the in

and economic change in the
20th century.

music building behind Din
kelspiel Auditorium in White
Plaza. The building will give the
music department more space
than its current home on the
Knoll can offer.

Construction is also underway
on Sterling Quad, the new un
dergraduate dormitories near
Lake Lagunita.
Bui construction projects
such as the new music center
and dormitory do depend
largely on the beneficience of
University donors (including
the federal government), and
in this inflationary age, the
University may have difficulty
raising the necessary funds.
If Stanford does attract the
required support, it might con

tinue to build right through the
100 th anniversary of that day in
188(> when Senator Stanford
decided to locate his new uni
versity on the site of his horse
farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding
horses ought to be good
enough lor teaching students.

When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the sum
mer of 1891 to be the Universi
ty's first president, he found
the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of
San Francisco Bay. Bounding it
on the southwest rises. . .the
Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously'. . .
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its

cloak of redwood, oak and
madrono diversified by thic
kets of chemisal. . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30
miles south of San Francisco,
its favorable climate assured by
its situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Senator and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,
Palo Alto.

The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek
and subsequent purchases ran
the total of 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the Univer
sity in the 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation
that it should never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stan
ford brought Francis Walker,
president of Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology and the
prominent landscape ar
chitect, Frederick Law Olm
sted, in the summer of 1886.

Grainfield site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the
foothills of the ranch, so as to
take advantage of the magnifi
cent view of the Bay, but they
finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below,
at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quad
rangle. The senator felt that the
flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the
general concept for the
grounds and the buildings, but
it remained for the young Bos
ton architect, Charles Allerton

Collidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent
architect of his time.
The style is called Richard
sonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanes
que, which is characterized by
rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half
circle arches supported by
short columns with decorated
capitals.
The inner quad of 12 class
room buildings — with the


Greg Webb/Daily
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church —
and three engineering build
ings, Encinca Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were
ready for the University's
opening on October 1, 1891.
" These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew White of
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beauti
ful college architecture in
America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the
morning of April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's
new buildings shook for 45
seconds. The great earthquake
killed two men on campus and
caused millions of dollars of
damage.
The ponderous church
tower, with its clocks, chimes

and spire, crashed into the
chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out
the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the
inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad —
100 feet high and decorated
with a frieze depicting the
march of civilization — was
damaged beyond repair. So
were a library and gymnasium
that were just short of comple
tion. None of these was re
placed.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known
as "the Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pur
suing a construction project
that was begun in 1886 and that
has been intermittently con

tinued up to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the
Stanford land, comprised for
the most part of the central
portion running from El
Camino Real to the back boun
dary in the foothills.
The areas designated for
light use lie in open land, in
cluding the arboretum, golf
course and the foothill lands
used for space-probing anten
nae and research in nuclear
physics and biological sci
ences.
The inner and outer quads
occupy 17 acres at the heart of
the academic area. The inner
quad's 12 classroom buildings,
two of which are now used by
the president and his staff, date
form the time the University
opened in 1891, while the
outer quad was completed in
1903, the same year that

Memorial Church was dedi
cated.
Buildings in the outer quad
are being brought up •>
earthquake-proof standard- by
an "inside-out" process of
construction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of
no particular denomination. In
the Founding Grant, they di
rected the trustees "to have
taught in the University the
immortality of the soul, the
existence of an all wise and be
nevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the
highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and
the University were to be non
sectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
In the orginal plans, the
central site now occupied by
the church was reserved for it,
though construction was de
terred. When Senator Stanford

died in 1893, his widow deter
mined that the church would
be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permis
sion to copy the Roselli fresco
of the "Last supper" in the Sis
tine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depict
ing the history of redemption.
The largest mosaic, however,
occupies most of the facade of
the church and, with 47 fig
ures, depicts the Sermon on
the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around
a steel framework. Another set
of mosaics was brought from
Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes,
was never rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower

and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace — millions of items
that include books, docu
ments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters,
maps and photos. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building,
completed in 1978, honors the
former president's humanita
rian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World
War I when he headed the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him
in a position to document the
war, Hoover shipped crates of
mater.al to the library at Stan
ford, his alma mater, and laid
the literary foundation of the
Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony,
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a
challenge to those who pro-
mote war. They should attract
those who search for peace."
The Institution has more ma
terial on communism than can
be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Be
nito Mussolini than can be
found in Italy. It also probably
has the most complete record
on Adolf Hitler and the Nazi
movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research
on problems of social, political
and economic change in the
20th century.
World War I memorial
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (au
ditorium), dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memeorial
to Stanford students and fac
ulty slain in World War I, the

auditorium also contains in the
toyer plaques honoring the
Stanford dead of World War 11.
The main auditorium seats 1700
and the Little Theatre seats 200.
Just south of the quad is
White Memorial Plaza, a
200,000 square foot landscaped
area donated to the University
by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond
White in memory of their sons.
The focal point of the plaza is a
tall, free-form fountain e<e
cuted in bronze by San Fran
cisco sculptor Aristides De
metrios.
Tresidder, named in mem
ory of Donald Bertrand Tresid
der, alumnus and fourth presi
dent of the University, con
tains the usual student union
facilities of food service, small
store, lounge and student gov
ernment offices.
The Stanford School of
Medicine moved from San

Francisco into its quarters in
1959. The $21 million structure
consists of three sections —
the hospital, the outpatient
clinics and the teaching labora
tories and classrooms.
New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerald Ford
dedicated the $11.9 million
facility. The school resides in
four buildings: the Robert
Crown library, which can seat
the entire law student body at
the same time; Frederick I.
Richman Hall, which contains


Nancy Raff/Daily
the classrooms and moot
court; the lames Irvine Gallery,
which contains the faculty and
student meeting rooms and
lounges; and 600-person
kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus,
the Unversity operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve. Rising
steeply from Searsville Lake,
the 735-acre preserve contains
a unique association of rock
ledges and outcroppings,
oak-dotted savannahs, chapar
ral, redwoods, streams and
pools.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm
one of the most productive and
varied programs of
ionoshperic and interplanetary
radio investigations. Its scien
tists made the first radar con
tact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the
antennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum

"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary
gases by means of a radar
beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along
Sand Hill Road. The $114 mil
lion machine, financed by the
Atomic Energy Commission
and completed in 1966, fires
the electron down a straight,
slender tube rather than whirl
ing protons in circles, as most
atom smashers do.
Stone age crumbles
As the '70s ended, the Un
versity drew to a close its so
called "Second Great Stone
Age," a building boom
launched in the early '60s in
which the University has at
tempted to meet the needs en
gendered by its big post-war
expansion in students and fac
ulty.
Now, however, as the Un
versity stabilizes its popula

tion, it plans fewer major build
ing projects for the next 10
years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least.
However, construction is
nearing completion on a new
music building behind Din
kelspiel Auditorium in White
Plaza. The building will give the
music department more space
than its current home on the
Knoll can offer.

Construction is also underway
on Sterling Quad, the new un
dergraduate dormitories near
Lake Lagunita.
Bui construction projects
such as the new music center
and dormitory do depend
largely on the beneficience of
University donors (including
the federal government), and
in this inflationary age, the
University may have difficulty
raising the necessary funds.
If Stanford does attract the
required support, it might con

tinue to build right through the
100 th anniversary of that day in
188(> when Senator Stanford

versity on the site of his horse
farm.
The Senator felt that any land
