The Leland Stanford junior
Museum stands majestically at
the end of Museum Way.
Like any museum, it is full of
the paintings, sculpture and
pottery of the past â€” priceless
testimony of lost civilizations
or examples of more contem
porary artists.
But the Stanford museum
claims a unique legacy: an en
tire room devoted to the his
tory of the family who founded
the University.
Leland and Jane Lathrop
Stanford built the museum and
the University as memorials to
their son Leland )r., who died
at 16.
The museum, built in stages
from 1894, was modeled after a
building in Athens. It was orig
inally much larger than it is
now, extending into what is
now the anatomy building. But
the 1906 earthquake destroyed
the back section; the remain
ing front section survived be
cause it was built of reinforced
concrete. Much of the pottery
and sculpture were destroyed.
Were it not for the quake,
the museum would have been
the largest private museum in
the world. Today, the Histori
cal Association of American
Public Works considers it one
of the most significant build
ings west of the Mississippi for
its structure and historical con
tent.
The Stanford room, and
other parts of the museum, de
tail much of the history of the
family, from its early business
ventures to little Leland's play
things.
Married in 1850, the couple
moved to Sacramento from the
upper Midwest, where Stan
ford purchased his brother's
store.
He later helped build, and
was president of, the Southern
Pacific Railroad. At first seen as

a risky financial venture, it later
proved to be a most lucrative
investment and helped to sup
port the University.
As a tribute to Stanford's
venture, the museum has a
safe displaying a gold and silver
spike, symbols of the joining of
the Central and Union Pacific
in Promontory, Utah, which
formed the first transcontinen
tal line. Stanford was present at
the ceremony.
Among Stanford's other
interests was the fledgling art
of motion picture photogra
phy. Stanford hired the ser
vices of San Francisco photo
grapher Edward Muybridge to
prove that when a horse is in
motion, all its hoofs can be off
the ground at once.
Muybridge placed, under a
layer of dirt, a wire connected
to a camera; when the horse
ran over the wire, a photo
graph was taken. A series of
photographs was placed on a
disc, which when rotated,
looked like a horse in motion.
A sequence of photos, on dis
play in the Stanford room show
that Stanford was correct.
During the Civil War, Stan
ford kept California on the
Union side and organized the
Republican party for Lincoln.
He was governor of California
at the time; after that, in 1885,
he was elected Senator. His
blue Civil War uniform with
gold buttons and epaulets is
preserved under glass in the
room.
'Precious jewel'
The Stanfords had been mar
ried 18 years before their only
child, Leland Ir., was born in
1868, in Sacramento. Mrs.
Stanford was 40 at the time of
his birth, and according to
museum do cent Clenda
Northway, her son was her
"precious jewel."
