# Rodin exhibit: simple drama
## 
### 
The marble pillars, the col
onnades and staircases, the
sense of timelessness, and the
cool stillness that fills the foyer
of the Stanford University
Museum of Art are impressive.
But the step beyond the over
elaborate entryway and into
the small room at the end of
the hall — the Auguste Rodin
exhibit — is overwhelming.
At first one is struck by the
contrast of bronze against stark
white bases and stark white
walls. However, this sense of
dark upon light lasts only a few
moments before it is swept
away by the figures them
selves.
Every piece seems to be in
motion. A quick glance around
the room, and one feels sur
rounded by a crowd of reach

ing, reclining and entwining
figures which embody the
magic of Rodin in every ges
ture.
The gallery is named after
B.G. Cantor, who donated 90
pieces to the museum in 1974.
Stanford was one of three reci
pients of Cantor's efforts to in
sure the placement of the
world's largest private collec
tion (127 pieces) in museums
that would use it for teaching
and research.
Stanford's exhibit includes
textual and photographic ma
terial, providing background
to Rodin's life, context to his
art, and giving emphasis to the
diversity of his work.
In many ways Rodin was a
traditionalist, working within
his 19th century classical heri

tage. Yet he is often called the
father of modern sculpture.
Museum docent Lynn Gib
bons, said, "he single
handedly revitalized the
sculpture tradition of his
time."
With incredible anatomical
accuracy, Rodin used straining
muscles, often of only parital
figures, to capture vigorous
motion. Rodin celebrated the
creation of a work of art itself,
often leaving signs of modeling
or remnants of the casting pro
cess as integral parts of the
piece.
According to Albert Elsen, art
professor at Stanford, "Rodin
made the naked human form
respond to a host of feelings
through gesture and move
