# Stanford speak
## This Stanford-English dictionary will help you tell your Fro Yo from your Flo Mo 
### 
With Hoo Tow, ASSU, Flo Mo, Dink, The Claw
and Mem—everything part of the standard Stanford
vocabulary, the visitor needs a dictionary just to
keep up with the conversation.
This list of the various parts of Stanford-speak,
along with appropriate English translations, should
provide some help.

ASSU—Associated Students
of Stanford University, the stu
dent government. Headed by
the Council of Presidents, the
ASSU sponsors, among other
things the Sunday Flicks, a re
frigerator rental service, the
Coffee House, the ASSU
T-shirt shop and the Guest Pro
fessor Board.
AXE — The symbol of the
rivalry between Stanford and
Cal (UC-Berkeley). The Axe is
awarded to the winner of the
Big Game (see below), but not
to the winner of The Big Game
(also see below). Periodically, a
group from the dispossessed
school attempts to steal the
Axe trom the current owner
during Big Game week; the last
successful attempt was made
by a Stanford contingent in
197 5. When Stanford owns the
Axe, it is displayed in a
specially-constructed protec
tive case inTresidder Memorial
Union. A screw hangs in that
case today.
BIG GAME—The annual
football contest between Stan
ford and Cal. Stanford won the
very first Big Game in 1892
under the leadership of a team

captain named Herbert
Hoover. Overall, Stanford
leads the rivalry 40-34 with 10
ties and one very big argument
(see below). Stanford will host
this year's Big Game on
November 19.
THE BIG GAME—Not to be
confused with the Big Game.
The Big Game can only mean
the recent chapter in the
Stanford-Cal rivalry. In the final
seconds of the 1982 Big Game,
Stanford went ahead 20-19.
That's when things went astray.
With Stanford fans dancing to
the Band's All Right Now, the
two teams lined up for the
kick-off. A Cal player started
running with the ball, then a
lateral, then a tackle, a lateral, a
tackle, a lateral until Cal player
Kevin Moen rammed into a
Stanford trombonist and
scored for Cal. Or did he? At
least one photograph showed
an official blowing the play
dead after one of the first tack
les. Hours of instant replay and
a take Daily Cal proclaiming a
Stanford victory later, the Gol
den Bear still owned the Axe.
THE CLAW — Not a man
eater, just the, ahem, inde

scribable sculpture which,
ahem, graces White Plaza.
DlNK—Short for Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, home of many
concerts and a course or two.
DOLLIE—Any one of the
pom-pom girls who accom
pany the Band at sporting
events and parties.
DOMINO'S — Often a
mainstay of the Stanford stu
dent's diet. Domino's free de
livery pizza is only a phone call
away from your doorstep.
When Food Service meals are
not-so tolerable, many stu
dents spell relief D -
O-M-I-N-O's.
FACE—Used interchangably
with Face and Facciamento,
"Face!" is Stanford-speak for
"burned," "roasted," "re
jecteo," "rebutted," or simply
put in one's place.
FACULTY SENATE—A group
of about 50 professors, elected
by their colleagues, who meet
a least 10 times per year to
make decisions regarding the
faculty.
THE FARM—A nickname for
Stanford which dates back to
the days when the University
was—you guessed it—a farm.
FLO MO—The abbreviated
name for the dormitory others
call Florence Moore.
FRO YO—A soft serve ice
cream-like substance available
in two flavors each day at the
Corner Pocket in Tresidder
Memorial Union. Called Fro
zen yogurt, by staunch trad
itionalists, the substance
has been rumored to form the
staple of at least one past Daily

editor's diet.
FROST—The amphitheater
behind Mem Aud (see below)
which is used for graduation,
picnics, and a seemingly end
less string of Grateful Dead
concerts.
GRIFFINS—One of the many
names suggested as a replace
ment for the Cardinal. Another
suggestion, perhaps more ap
propriate, is the Lemmings. A
Lemming is a hamster-like
animal that, for no apparent
reason, runs en masse into the
ocean and drowns.
HOO TOW—Hoover Tower,
Herbert Hoover's institute on
"War, Revolution and Peace."
A campus-wide controversy
has raged for most of the year
over whether Hoover is a
right-wing think tank or a
non-partisan research insti
tute. Also called Hoover's Last
Erection.
INDIANS—The former name
of the Cardinal. In 1972, then-

University President Richard
Lyman changed the name be
cause certain groups claimed
the name had racist connota
tions.
KZSU—Stanford's student
run radio station can be found
at 90.1 on your FM dial. Tune
in; there's no telling what
you'll hear.
LAG—Another name for
Lake Lagunita, the man-made
lake on campus. It's filled each
rainy season and usually dries
up in late May. But because of
the heavy rain this year, Lag
was still full in mid-June. For
those of you who speak
Spanish, we don't need to
point out that "Lake Lagunita''
translates to "Lake Lake." Lag
also refers to Lagunita Court, a
student dormitory near "Lake
Lake."
LSJUMB —The incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity (pause) Marching Band.
The Band doesn't march. The
Band doesn't play music by
John Phillip Souza. The Band
doesn't tackle ail that well
either.
MEM AUD—Abbreviation
for Memorial Auditorium, the
campus' largest auditorium
(only Memorial Church, or
"Mem Chu," seats more).
THE QUAD—The Quad
rangle, or central classroom
area of the University. If you're
looking for a room number
that has no building name,
you'll probably find here. The
Quad is also the name of the
Stanford yearbook.
RAMONA'S—The other kind
of free delivery pizza. More
expensive and considerably
slower than Domino's (see
above), Ramona's pizza is
much tastier.
THE ROW—An area on cam
pus where the original frater
nity and sorority row existed. A
few fraternities now share the
Row with other independent
houses.
UGLY—Undergraduate li
brary, also known as the J.
Henry Meyer Memorial Li
brary.
