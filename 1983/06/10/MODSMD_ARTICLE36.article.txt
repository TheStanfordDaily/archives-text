While you're too late to see
|ohn Flway lead the Stanford
( arrlinal, you still c an see some
exciting sports action here in
the Bay Area.
The Bay Area is home for
both the San Franc isco Giants
and the Oaklnad A sand a day
at either San Francisco's
< andlestick Park or the Oak
land Coliseum may be the per
tect cure for the stuck-at-
Stanford blues.
Although they never seem to
"go all the way," by late sum
mer the Giants are usually right
there near the top of the Na
tional League's Western Divi
sion.
And the Los Angeles Dod
gers are always there with
them. For baseball excitement,
you can't beat the Giants-
Dodgers rivalry. Dating back to
the days when both teams
played in Brooklyn, the rivalry
means a rowdy Candlestick
crowd whenever the Dodgers
are in town. The demons from
the south visit San Francisco
tor a three-game series in late
July.
The Giants also have home
games this summer with Hous
ton, Atlanta, Cincinatti, San
Diego, Chicago, Pittsburgh
and St. Louis.
Although you may be the
only person in the stadium, a
trip to see the COakland A s bat
tle their American I eague foes
is always fun. 1 here's no way to
predict how the amazingly er
ratic A's will be playing at any
one time, so check the sports
pages to see if they're conten
ders or cellar-keepers this
week.
This summer the A s host the
Rangers, the Tigers, the
Orioles, the Red Sox, the
Mariners, the I wins, the
Angels and the Brewers.
Believe it or not, the Bay Area
can also boast of football in
|une. That's right, the USFI s
Oakland Invaders take on Bos
ion in the Oakland Coliseum
on lune 2Sth.

It soccer is your thing, the
San lose [ arthquakes are worth
a trip to Spartan Stadium. The
team takes on the best of the
NASI through early August, in
cluding the New York Cosmos
and the Tampa Bay Rowdies.
For specific game times and
tiikets for these and other Bay
Area sporting events, call the
BASS ticket information line in
San Francisco at T-E-L-E-T-l-X.
You may charge tickets by
phone (BLS-4J42) or purchase
them in person at the Tresidder
Box Oftice on the second floor
of Tresidder Memorial Union.
