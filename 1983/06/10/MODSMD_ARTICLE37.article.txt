# BAY AREA
## Getting around 101 or 280? Freeways fill the Peninsula, but the carless needn't be clueless 
### 
Taking the wrong path and
getting lost in the forest cer
tainly ranks among mankind's
most enduring fears. In the Bay
Area, the paths may take the
form of 12 lane highways, the
wolves tandem trailer trucks
and the swamps stretches of in
terminably red traffic lights,
but the troubles of getting
around are no less bothersome
here than they are in the Ama
zon basis and the Siberian
steppes.
Maps, of course, were in
vented to take the guesswork
out of traveling from A to B. But
if A happens to be the Stanford
campus and B happens to be

anywhere farther afield than
downtown Palo Alto, a map
does almost more harm than
good to the unexperienced
traveler. Should he follow that
heavy red line which looks as it
it ought to be a major thor
oughfare? Or is it in fact a
traffic-snarled thicket of stop
lights, stop signs and left hand
turners? Or, foregoing the use
of his car, should he ride the
bus which follows the route
marked out in blue, or maybe
see if he could take a train?
The first thing to bear in
mind is that local topography
plays a large part in determin
ing the direction and nature of

the lines of transportation. The
Bay to the east and the hills to
the west accentuate the penin
sularity of San Francisco and
environs. 1 he towns and cities
between San Francisco and San
lose can be thought of as pearls
(or more aptly, beans) on a
multi-stranded necklace. The
two main strands are the
Bayshore Freeway (highway
101), which can be considered
the eastern border of Penin
sula civilization, and interstate
280 which is the western bor
der. In between run several
minor strands for greater or
lesser stretches between the
two ends. The most important

of these are El Camino Real
(highway 82), with w hi c h
everyone soon becomes famil
iar, although few realize how
remarkably uniform it is over
its entire 50 mile length, and
Alameda de las Pulgas (known
to the south as Foothill Ex
pressway) which ranges from
residential to rural and conse
quently is much easier and tas
ter going than El Camino.
VVhich north-south route to
take is best determined accord
ing to the length of the trip. If
the destination is not a great
distance, Fl Camino is satisfac
tory; if it is several miles, the
Alameda starts to become

more worthwhile; and if it is
further, one of the freeways is
the only reasonable choice.
Carless
For the carless, the Sari
Mateo County Iransit District
operates bus service between
various points in Palo Alto, in
cluding a pair on or near cam
pus, and destinations along El
Camino to the north all the way
to San Francisco.
Which of the two freeways to
take to San Francisco is the sub
je c t of an on-g o in g con
troversy. Long-time local resi
dents tend to line up behind
101. Thev c laim it is faster than
