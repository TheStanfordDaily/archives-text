## Getting around 101 or 280? Freeways fill the Peninsula, but the carless needn't be clueless 
### 
Taking the wrong path and
getting lost in the forest cer
tainly ranks among mankind's
most enduring fears. In the Bay
Area, the paths may take the
form of 12 lane highways, the
wolves tandem trailer trucks
and the swamps stretches of in
terminably red traffic lights,
but the troubles of getting
around are no less bothersome
here than they are in the Ama
zon basis and the Siberian
steppes.
Maps, of course, were in
vented to take the guesswork
out of traveling from A to B. But
if A happens to be the Stanford
campus and B happens to be

anywhere farther afield than
downtown Palo Alto, a map
does almost more harm than
good to the unexperienced
traveler. Should he follow that
heavy red line which looks as it
it ought to be a major thor
oughfare? Or is it in fact a
traffic-snarled thicket of stop
lights, stop signs and left hand
turners? Or, foregoing the use
of his car, should he ride the
bus which follows the route
marked out in blue, or maybe
see if he could take a train?
The first thing to bear in
mind is that local topography
plays a large part in determin
ing the direction and nature of

the lines of transportation. The
Bay to the east and the hills to
the west accentuate the penin
sularity of San Francisco and
environs. 1 he towns and cities
between San Francisco and San
lose can be thought of as pearls
(or more aptly, beans) on a
multi-stranded necklace. The
two main strands are the
Bayshore Freeway (highway
101), which can be considered
the eastern border of Penin
sula civilization, and interstate
280 which is the western bor
der. In between run several
minor strands for greater or
lesser stretches between the
two ends. The most important

of these are El Camino Real
(highway 82), with w hi c h
everyone soon becomes famil
iar, although few realize how
remarkably uniform it is over
its entire 50 mile length, and
Alameda de las Pulgas (known
to the south as Foothill Ex
pressway) which ranges from
residential to rural and conse
quently is much easier and tas
ter going than El Camino.
VVhich north-south route to
take is best determined accord
ing to the length of the trip. If
the destination is not a great
distance, Fl Camino is satisfac
tory; if it is several miles, the
Alameda starts to become

more worthwhile; and if it is
further, one of the freeways is
the only reasonable choice.
Carless
For the carless, the Sari
Mateo County Iransit District
operates bus service between
various points in Palo Alto, in
cluding a pair on or near cam
pus, and destinations along El
Camino to the north all the way
to San Francisco.
Which of the two freeways to
take to San Francisco is the sub
je c t of an on-g o in g con
troversy. Long-time local resi
dents tend to line up behind
101. Thev c laim it is faster than
280. On the other hand, 280
(officially named the Junipero
Serra Freeway, after the
Spanish monk who first ex
plored this part of California) is
designated "the world's most
beautiful freeway." Whether
this title is deserved or not is a
matter of personal taste, but
280 is indisputably the pleas
anter of the two roads; it is
newer, wider, smoother, and
much more rural than its
bayside counterpart. It is also
easier to reach from campus: it
has access ramps off Page Mill,
Alpine and Sand Hill Roads.
The Bayshore, in contrast, is
separated from the University
by a forbidding sequence of
traffic hindrances regardless of
which approach is attempted.
It is not, however, necessary
to have a car to get to the City.
The Southern Pacific Railroad
runs daily from Palo Alto to San
Francisco. The ride is comfort
able and the depot is located
just off campus near the El
Camino-University Avenue
overpass.
BART
One ingenious and a little
known alternative route is to
take the Peerless Stage bus
service from the Palo Alto
Greyhound Terminal (on Alma
Street) over the Dumbarton
Bridge to Fremont and take
BART (acronymic for Bay Area
Rapid Transit). The route is
partly above ground, partly
subterranean, and goes
through Oakland, most of the
popular destinations in San
Francisco and winds up in Daly
City.

The problem with going car
less is getting aroung the City.
But as it turns out, this is more
easily done than said. In addi
tion to BART, San Francisco has
a full complement of public
buses. While not recom
mended forscantily cladyoung
beautiesof eithersex, this pub
lic transportation is fairly safe
and quick and not really all that
unbearable.
The possiblities for east-west
travel are more limited. High
way 84 crosses the Dumbarton
Bridge from the East Bay and
runs all the way to the Pacific
coast via Redwood City,
Woodside and La Honda.
Highway 92 crosses the San
Mateo Bridge and passes
through San Mateo on its way
to Half Moon Bay. Both these
roads become narrow country
lanes when they climb into the
hills to the west.
To escape this area al
together, there are five main
routes. To the north, the best
choice is Highway 101, which is
also the preferred route south,
(the exception to this rule is
when the destination is Santa
Cruz and vicinity, in which case
Highway 17, the major north
south route of the East Bay
which intersects 280 in San
lose, is regrettably but unav
oidably the way to go.) To Sac
ramento and points north or
east, the Bay Bridge and Inter
state 80 is the accepted route.
Points south or west can best
be reached by the improbable
highway 152. This branches off
101 in Cilroy about 25 miles
south of San lose.
