# Going to 'The City'
## San Francisco captures an international energy, but coast towns will let you relax 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
"I'm going to San Fran
cisco," visitors to this
area often say, yet since
the mood of San Fran
cisco and its environs
have become in
tertwined the meaning is
usually "I'm going to the
Bay Area."
San Francisco
Of course, "The City" — un
questionably the most eastern
of Californian, and probably of
west coast, cities — is the place
to start. San 112 ranicsco blends a
frantic urban tempo set by the
pinstripe-suited businessmen
that zip back and forth be
tween buildings on Montgom
ery Street in the heart of the
financial district with land
marks such as Chinatown, Vic
torian houses, fisherman's
Wharf, and Coit Tower, that in
spired Albert I inney to remark
in the movie Shoo/ the Moon
I hi s town c r u Id d ie of
quaint."
No trip to San I rancisco
would !>•■ < omplele without
visits to these temples of
tourism 'hat have incited some
local newspaper columnists to
< harge thai san 112 ranicsco is
opting lor an amusement park
over a healthy urban commu
nity. Yet once the novelty of
the tourist shops and wax
museums and casual street
vendors (institutionalized by
city licensing laws) h, : s waned,
the visitor would do well to
seek out the back allies of ihe

standard tourist districts.
All most visitors usually see
of Chinatown is Grant Avenue,
the crowded honky-tonk strip.
While some genuinely good
Chinese restaurants and stores
face this thoroughfare, the real
Chinatown lies in the back al
lies radiating from Grant Av
enue where lives the largest
Chinese population outside of
Asia. There, the independent
tourist will encounter small but
excellent restaurants and mar
kets, even an herbal pharmacy
or two. Grandmothers sit on
front stoops, sewing and keep
ing an eye on children who
play kickball in the allies and
explode caps with spoons.
Housewives bargain for the
treshest spring beans and bok
choy and husbands trade
community gossip and play
checkers in the park across
from the Chinatown Holiday
Inn.
I hough it seems hard to be
lieve now, what with the tourist
traps and (lashing neon,
Fisherman's Wharf once existed
to support Ihe City's fishing in
dustry. I hat old flavor can be
rec a put red by buying a loaf of
Parisian sourdough French
bread and a fresh crab, and
walking the piers of the small
marina behind Alioto's Restau
ranl. Toward Ghirardelli
Square, a stroll out the pier of
Aquatic Park at sunset affords a
breathtaking view of the bay
and graphically explains the
choice of the name: Golden
Gate. Old men tish off the pier,
and members of the "Dolphin"

Athletic Club swim in the freez
ing hay water.
While the Financial district
may not normally make the top
of the ' places not to miss" list,
the area boasts some of the
best restaurants in San Fran
cisco. Both Tadich's and Sam's
grills perpetuate the old,
Boston-like San Francisco of
rude, linen-approned and
bow-tied waiters, superlative
food, long lines, and "Old
Boys' Club" tete-a-tetes. The
Carnelian Room at the top of
the Bank of America building
prepares excellent meals with a
view of the Bay and, in sum
mer, of the fog drifting by.

Marin County
The Colden Gate Bridge
links San Francisco with Marin,
portrayed in the book and
movie The Serial as the home
of "mellowed-out" Northern
Californians who eat alfalfa
sprouts and tofu, drink Perrier
water, drive Mercedes sedans
and have orgies in their red
wood hot-tubs. To the extent
that these seterotypes are ac
curate, Marin is also one of the
most beautiful areas in Califor
nia graced with mellowness,
good restaurants and redwood
forests.
At 'hp turn of the century,
uhen Marin was truly in the

country, residents dubbed
what is now called Sausalito
"FHurrican Gulch." The reason
for the name choice will be
come clear should the tourist
visit Sausalito on one of the
numerous foggy summer days.
On a clear day in Sausalito,
however, you can see forever
from Bridgeway, the main
drag.
In the The Serial, Mill Valley
and places like the Mill Valley
Book Depot are center-stage.
On Miller Avenue in down
town Mill Valley, the Book
Depot offers a reading selec
tion from The Wall Street
