# Must-see City spots
## There's a handful of places you can't afford to miss 
### 
San Francisco probably has
more to commend it than any
other city in the United States.
It has so much geographical,
cultural and ideological diver
sity, so many unique aspects,
so many positive attractions,
that it is difficult to think of a
city which rivals it.
Many students have made
the City their favorite Friday or
Saturday night destination.
Some go up to drink, some go
up to dance, but the majority
go up just to "cruise around."
Everyone has his favorite street
or square but the following are
among the most frequently vis
ited attractions:
Chinatown An area best
traveled on foot, located on a
section of Grant Avenue, near
Union Square, it includes
many gift shops, groceries and
herb dealers, and a fortune
cookie factory.
Coil Tower: At the top of
Telegraph Hill, this is one of
the city's best lookout spots,
with a panoramic view of the
Bay. Get there by following
Lombard Street up the hill.

boats, seafood, museums,
1 shirt shops, amusement ar
cades, the Ripley's "Believe It
or Not" establishment, street
artists, street music <ans and lot
