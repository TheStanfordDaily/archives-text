There will always be days and
weekends when you'll want to
get out from under the shadow
of Hoover Tower. There will
also be moments when you will
want to get away but will only
have the time or means to go a
few miles.
Whatever the case, you can
get away from it all at a count
less number of fun, beautiful
and interesting places in
Northern California. Some are
just down the street, while
others are across the state, but
almost all have such enjoyable
features that after a visit to one
or more, you will probably re
turn thinking that life at Stan
ford only begins on the Farm.
For the birds
At the foot of Embarcadero
Road, no more than a 30-
minute bike ride away, lie the
Palo Alto Baylands, a favorite
stop-over for birds traveling on
the Pacific Flyway. These birds,
including egrets, willets, ducks
and more ducks, feed closest
to the shore at the ebb of a very
high tide. An interpretive cen
ter at the Baylands (329-2506)
schedules films and lectures
about Bay ecology, and all vis
itors are welcome to take their
own tour over the marshlands
on miles of inter-connecting
wooden walkways.
The Stanford foothills be
hind Lake Lagunita offer good
views of the Bay, a place to go
on a mini-hike and many lovely
spots for picnicking. A number
of stairways over the fence ad
jacent to lunipero Serra Blvd.
enable you to pick your own
trail.

Foothills Park, up Page Mill
Road, is only open to Palo Alto
residents, but if you can find a
phone bill, or something else
bearing a Palo Alto address,
you can get in to enjoy the
open spaces. Dusk is the time
to watch the small groups of
deer that feed on the watered
green grass.
Rock climbers meet at Castle
Rock State Park on Skyline
Boulevard for bouldering, and
botanists, bird watchers, and
hikers enjoy its wandering
trails.
For those who enjoy
amusement parks, Marine
World-Africa USA is a 60-acre
park that features performing
jungle and sea animals. It is lo
cated north of Stanford on
Highway 101, in Redwood City
(356-7446).
Santa Clara thrills
South of campus, near Santa
Clara, the Marriott Corpora
tion has its five-year-old,
mammoth Great America
theme park which sports many
wild "thrill" rides for the
strong of stomach and brave at
heart.
Huddart Park, located on
Kings Mountain Road in
Woodside, is only 30 minutes
away from campus by car.
Drivers and bicyclists who
want to take a scenic route to
the park should drive out Sand
Hill to Portola Road, turn right
and then continue on Old
Country Road to Woodside
Road. Turn right there, and
then left on Kings Mountain.
The park offers nature trails,
volleyball courts, picnic areas

and other recreational
facilities.
In California, of course, one
naturally thinks of beaches,
but in this area, they are mainly
for surfing and sunning; even
the best of swimmers should
be wary of the cold waters and
strong undertow.
Before you head for the
ocean, check the weather re
port. The beaches are often
foggy, even when Stanford is
roasting. In mid-winter, how
ever, you can often enjoy a
sunny day on an uncrowded
stretch of sand.
Highway 1 between Half
Moon Bay and Santa Cruz is
dotted with spectacular, cliff
bordered beaches; some of
the favorites inlcude San Gr>e
gorio and Pomponio. (For

those who prefer to sun with
out a suit, there's the public
beach at Bonny Doone, 10
miles north of Santa Cruz, and
the private beach one mile
north of the state beach at San
Gregorio.)
In the winter, you can also
usually see magnificent
elephant seals at Ano Nuevo
beach, to which they migrate
during the mating season. And
if you simply must go ocean
swimming, the beaches in the
Santa Cruz area and south are
relatively safe — but still cold.
Hiking nearby
For day trips or longer, Big
Basin, home of fine stands of
California Redwoods and
wildlife, is just an hour and a
half away by car, or four to five
hours by bike. Head up Page
Mill Road to Skyline Boulevard,

then turn left, keeping your
eyes open for signs to Big Basin
and breathtaking views of
mountains and the sea. It's a
right turn on Highway 9 and
then down Highway 236 to the
park headquarters. From
there, hundreds of miles of
trails can lead you to mountain
peaks or down to the ocean.
Or, take four hours by car to
drive down to Point Lobos Pre
serve, a beautiful seascape
area complete wilh sea otters,
ocean spray, and hiking trails.
Point Lobos is approximately
seven miles past Carmel, itself
a charming place to visit if you
like to shop. In addition, the
nearby town of Monterey is full
of California history, dating
from the days of Spanish mis
sions and later, )ohn Stein
beck's novels.

There will always be days and
weekends when you'll want to
get out from under the shadow
of Hoover Tower. There will
also be moments when you will
want to get away but will only
have the time or means to go a
few miles.
Whatever the case, you can
get away from it all at a count
less number of fun, beautiful
and interesting places in
Northern California. Some are
just down the street, while
others are across the state, but
almost all have such enjoyable
features that after a visit to one
or more, you will probably re
turn thinking that life at Stan
ford only begins on the Farm.
For the birds
At the foot of Embarcadero
Road, no more than a 30-
minute bike ride away, lie the
Palo Alto Baylands, a favorite
stop-over for birds traveling on
the Pacific Flyway. These birds,
including egrets, willets, ducks
and more ducks, feed closest
to the shore at the ebb of a very
high tide. An interpretive cen
ter at the Baylands (329-2506)
schedules films and lectures
about Bay ecology, and all vis
itors are welcome to take their
own tour over the marshlands
on miles of inter-connecting
wooden walkways.
The Stanford foothills be
hind Lake Lagunita offer good
views of the Bay, a place to go
on a mini-hike and many lovely
spots for picnicking. A number
of stairways over the fence ad
jacent to lunipero Serra Blvd.
enable you to pick your own
trail.

Foothills Park, up Page Mill
Road, is only open to Palo Alto
residents, but if you can find a
phone bill, or something else
bearing a Palo Alto address,
you can get in to enjoy the
open spaces. Dusk is the time
to watch the small groups of
deer that feed on the watered
green grass.
Rock climbers meet at Castle
Rock State Park on Skyline
Boulevard for bouldering, and
botanists, bird watchers, and
hikers enjoy its wandering
trails.
For those who enjoy
amusement parks, Marine
World-Africa USA is a 60-acre
park that features performing
jungle and sea animals. It is lo
cated north of Stanford on
Highway 101, in Redwood City
(356-7446).
Santa Clara thrills
South of campus, near Santa
Clara, the Marriott Corpora
tion has its five-year-old,
mammoth Great America
theme park which sports many
wild "thrill" rides for the
strong of stomach and brave at
heart.
Huddart Park, located on
Kings Mountain Road in
Woodside, is only 30 minutes
away from campus by car.
Drivers and bicyclists who
want to take a scenic route to
the park should drive out Sand
Hill to Portola Road, turn right
and then continue on Old
Country Road to Woodside
Road. Turn right there, and
then left on Kings Mountain.
The park offers nature trails,
volleyball courts, picnic areas

and other recreational
facilities.
In California, of course, one
naturally thinks of beaches,
but in this area, they are mainly
for surfing and sunning; even
the best of swimmers should
be wary of the cold waters and
strong undertow.
Before you head for the
ocean, check the weather re
port. The beaches are often
foggy, even when Stanford is
roasting. In mid-winter, how
ever, you can often enjoy a
sunny day on an uncrowded
stretch of sand.
Highway 1 between Half
Moon Bay and Santa Cruz is
dotted with spectacular, cliff
bordered beaches; some of
the favorites inlcude San Gr>e
gorio and Pomponio. (For

those who prefer to sun with
out a suit, there's the public
beach at Bonny Doone, 10
miles north of Santa Cruz, and
the private beach one mile
north of the state beach at San
Gregorio.)
In the winter, you can also
usually see magnificent
elephant seals at Ano Nuevo
beach, to which they migrate
during the mating season. And
if you simply must go ocean
swimming, the beaches in the
Santa Cruz area and south are
relatively safe — but still cold.
Hiking nearby
For day trips or longer, Big
Basin, home of fine stands of
California Redwoods and
wildlife, is just an hour and a
half away by car, or four to five
hours by bike. Head up Page
Mill Road to Skyline Boulevard,

then turn left, keeping your
eyes open for signs to Big Basin
and breathtaking views of
mountains and the sea. It's a
right turn on Highway 9 and
then down Highway 236 to the
park headquarters. From
there, hundreds of miles of
trails can lead you to mountain
peaks or down to the ocean.
Or, take four hours by car to
drive down to Point Lobos Pre
serve, a beautiful seascape
area complete wilh sea otters,
ocean spray, and hiking trails.
Point Lobos is approximately
seven miles past Carmel, itself
a charming place to visit if you
like to shop. In addition, the
nearby town of Monterey is full
of California history, dating
