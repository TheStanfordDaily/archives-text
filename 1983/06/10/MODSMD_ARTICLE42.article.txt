Whether you're looking for
Peter, Paul and Mary or Men at
Work, the Bay Area is the place
to be if live music is what you
want.
With dozens of venues avail
able in the area — from Palo
Alto's Keystone club to the
60,000 seat Oakland Coliseum
— it's possible to catch just
about any type of popular mus
ical act around.
What follows is a partial list
of some of the more popular
Bay Area music halls and some
of the acts that will be visiting
them this summer. For a more
current and complete listing of
shows check the Sunday
Chronicle's "Pinkie" enter
tainment section or call the
BASS ticket information line in
San Francisco at T-E-L-E-T-l-X.
You can purchase tickets for
most Bay Area events at Tre
sidder Box Office, located on
the second floor of Tresidder
Memorial Union.
• The Oakland Coliseum is the
home of the ever popular —
and over-crowded — Days on
the Green shows. Every sum
mer promoter Bill Graham
packs close to 70,000 rock fans
into the Coliseum to see shows
by top-name rock acts. Past
Day on the Green bands in
clude Loverboy, Aerosmith,
Boston and Foreigner. Jour
ney, Triumph and Eddie
Money will kick off this year's
Day on the Green series on July
30th. More shows should be
announced soon.
•the Greek Theatre, an 8000-
seat open air stadium on the

UC Berkeley campus, also
hosts a summer concert series,
but usually not of the thud
rock variety of Day on the
Green. Headlining this year's
series are A Flock of Seagulls,
Peter Gabriel, George Benson,
lames Taylor, Pat Metheney,
Kenny Loggins and Men at
Work. Plan to combine a day in
Berkeley and an evening con
cert at "the Greek" and you'll
have the makings for a great
one-day outing.
• The Concord pavilion will fea
ture everything from the New
York Philharmonic to Donna
Summer and Hall and Oates
this summer. Other acts to
catch there include Pete
Seeger and Arlo Guthrie; Pe
ter, Paul and Mary; the Kings
ton Trio; Rick Springfield;
Marshall Tucker and the Os
monds.
• The Keystone clubs are three
smaller Bay Area night clubs:
the Keystone Palo Alto, the
Keystone Berkeley, and The
Stone in San Francisco. You
can find local bands and not
so-well known national talent
playing most any night of the
week at one of the Keystone
clubs. Highlighting this sum
mer are Bonnie Hayes, the Paul
Collins' Beat, Martha and the
Muffins, and US Festival artists
the Divinyls.
And although nothing defi
nite had been announced at
press time, rumor has it that
the Police and David Bowie
may also be appearing some
where in the Bay Area this
summer. Watch the "Pinkie"
for details.
