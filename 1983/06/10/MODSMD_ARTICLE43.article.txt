The capsule reviews in this
section are condensed ver
sions of reviews which were
included in past issues of the
Daily. Prices listed are only ap
proximations.
ACAPULCO'S
2515 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
323-8403
Only a year old, but the
Acapulco's margaritas are very
good, and the food is good,
too. The restaurant offers a Fri
day afternoon happy hour with
free nachos. Open every day,
offering lunch and dinner from
the same menu. Inexpensive-
Moderate (drinks are fairly
expensive.)
CHANTILLY
530 Ramona
Palo Alto
321-4080
Chantilly is that type of res
taurant you'd like to keep a
secret. The understated ele

gence of roses and pinks give
Chantilly an exclusive atmos
phere without the pretensions
of other top-flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile and
the diverse menu shows imag
ination; sauteed veal and
eggplant, L'escalopine de veau
a la Bolognaise for two,
Chicken Cynthia with cham
pagne.
The chef's subtle sauces and
refined seasonings enhance
rather than stifle the freshness
of Chantilly's dishes. The Lis
son Salad a la Chantilly for two,
with lettuce, cucumber, olive,
bacon, feta cheese and herbs,
and the Meddalions of Spring
Lamb, sauteed with fresh tara
gon, will both delight rather
than assault your palate.
CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9988
China Lion is the venture of
Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger

brother. The menu lists 109
items, many of which are
Hunan style. Prices are lower
than Chef Chu's, but the por
tions are smaller. One is ad
vised to order an extra bowl of
rice. Service is attentive.
Kung Pao Beef consists of
tender beef slices and crisp
green peppers accented with
peanuts. Prawns in hot sauce,
though tasty, are a cnaiienge to
eat â€” the prawns are not shel
led.
CHEZ JUSTINE
625 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
328-8549
Chez lustine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargots, and oysters.
Pate Maison is of the pureed
liver variety, but too dry. En
trees come with soup dujour
and salad.
The menu features Abalone,
Long Island Duckling, and New
York Steak with green pepper

corns among its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in Cream
Sauce are extremely tender,
but the veal is too thick for
classic escalopes. Rather, they
resembled veal medallions.
Truite Plemondaise (fresh trout
with wine sauce) is outstand
ing.
For dessert, Strawberries
with ice cream, nuts and Grand
Marnier is a visual as well as a
taste treat.
Although better French res
taurants than Chez lustines
exist on the Peninsula, don't
miss the Sunday Champagne
Brunch, the incredible buffet is
already a legend in the bay
area. Many students here fast
for two days beforehand.
COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN
BARBEQUE
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
568-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not

known for their fancy cookery.
Their simple diet of thin-sliced
roasted meat was introduced
in China during the 13th cen
tury. The Chinese added veg
etables and other ingredients,
the cuisine became known as
the "Mongolian Barbeque."
Take a bowl and help your
self to frozen strips of turkey,
lamb, pork and beef. Fresh
vegetables, including shred
ded carrots, onions, celery,
cabbage, bean sprouts and
cilantro, are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque
sauces. Curry, sweet and sour,
lobster, spicy, mild, medium,
hot and extra hot are offered,
and you are encouraged to
create your own combination.
The atmosphere of Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighboor
hood cafes. The services are
courteous, and made some
what more charming by the
fact that no one spoke English
very well. Col. Lee's might just
be the ticket if you are looking
