# GRADUATION SPEAKERS
## Shultz to speak Sunday Secretary of State will deliver commencement address 
### My BILL AINSWORTH 
Eleven months after taking
office, Secretary of State
George Shultz, a campus resi
dent for seven years, will return
to Stanford to deliver the fea
tured speech at the 92nd an
nual commencement ceremo
nies Sunday. His speech will
deal with U.S. foreign policy.
University officials estimated
that a record crowd of 15,000
will be on hand in Frost Am
phitheater to watch the com
mencement ceremonies.
About 2800 graduates and 500
faculty are expected to attend
the ceremony in the am
phitheater — recently renovat
ed to expand its capacity.
A coalition of student groups
plans to protest but not disrupt
Shultz's speech and the Reagan
administration's human right's
policy and its policies in Latin
America, South Africa and the
Middle East.
Shultz's press office refused
to release any details about the
content of the speech, the se
curity precautions or the secre
tary of state's travel plans. The
Secretary was unavailable for
comment.
However, in his letter accept
ing the invitation to speak at
commencement last February
Shultz said he would be, "hon
ored to speak at Stanford."
Shultz was chosen to speak at
commencement by a commit
tee consisting of two senior
class presidents and faculty and
staff members. He is the fifth
important U.S. government of
ficial to speak at graduation ex
cercises in the last six years.
Last year Supreme Court Jus

tice Sandra Day O'Connor
spoke; in 1981 Deputy Secre
tary of State Warren Christ
opher gave the address; U.N.
Ambassador Andrew Young
talked in 1979; and then Food
and Drug Commissioner
Donald Kennedy delivered the
speech in 1978. Kennedy, now
the University President was
chosen as the alternative
speaker in the event that Shultz
could not attend the ceremo
ny.
Shultz's appointment
Last July Shultz left his job as
president of the Bechtel Cor
poration, a huge international
engineering and construction
firm, to assume the office of
secretary of state. His appoint
ment — announced simultane
ously with the resignation of
then Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig — came as no sur
prise. Shultz was one of the
leading candidates for the post
before Reagan took office, but
lost out to Haig in the last stages
of the transition.
In addition to the Bechtel
job, Shultz also had to give up
his position as a part-time pro
fessor in the Business School.
During his Senate confirmation
hearings last July, Shultz
quipped that he could only ac
cept the position "if the Stan
ford board of trustees grants
me a leave of absence."
Since he joined the faculty of
the Business School in 1974,
Shultz has taught one course a
year on public management.
His association with the tjnl
versity began in 1968 when he
served a year as a fellow at the

Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences.
Shultz continues to maintain
a home on campus and he oc
casionally entertains world
leaders there. Recently former
West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt — a close
friend of Shuitz's — was a guest
at his campus residence. Last
summer Shultz hosted Schmidt
and former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger during their
brief visits.
Shultz has compiled an il
lustrious career in education,
government and business,
moving back and forth among
the three areas with ease. His
career in government began in
1955 when he served on the
Council of Economic Advisors,
while he was a professor at the
University of Chicago. Under
the Nixon administration he
held a variety of cabinet posi
tions including secretary of the
treasury, commerce and labor
and director of the office of
management and budget.
In education, Shuitz's career
began in 1948 when he joined
the faculty of the Massachu
setts Institution of Technology
as an associate professor. Later,
he moved to the University of
Chicago and became a dean of
the Graduate School of Busi
ness there in 1962.
First year In office
The most important effects
that Shultz has had on U.S. for
eign policy since taking office
relate more to His style than his
ideology. Although his ideol
