# GRADUATION SPEAKERS
## Shultz to speak Sunday Secretary of State will deliver commencement address 
### My BILL AINSWORTH 
Eleven months after taking
office, Secretary of State
George Shultz, a campus resi
dent for seven years, will return
to Stanford to deliver the fea
tured speech at the 92nd an
nual commencement ceremo
nies Sunday. His speech will
deal with U.S. foreign policy.
University officials estimated
that a record crowd of 15,000
will be on hand in Frost Am
phitheater to watch the com
mencement ceremonies.
About 2800 graduates and 500
faculty are expected to attend
the ceremony in the am
phitheater — recently renovat
ed to expand its capacity.
A coalition of student groups
plans to protest but not disrupt
Shultz's speech and the Reagan
administration's human right's
policy and its policies in Latin
America, South Africa and the
Middle East.
Shultz's press office refused
to release any details about the
content of the speech, the se
curity precautions or the secre
tary of state's travel plans. The
Secretary was unavailable for
comment.
However, in his letter accept
ing the invitation to speak at
commencement last February
Shultz said he would be, "hon
ored to speak at Stanford."
Shultz was chosen to speak at
commencement by a commit
tee consisting of two senior
class presidents and faculty and
staff members. He is the fifth
important U.S. government of
ficial to speak at graduation ex
cercises in the last six years.
Last year Supreme Court Jus

tice Sandra Day O'Connor
spoke; in 1981 Deputy Secre
tary of State Warren Christ
opher gave the address; U.N.
Ambassador Andrew Young
talked in 1979; and then Food
and Drug Commissioner
Donald Kennedy delivered the
speech in 1978. Kennedy, now
the University President was
chosen as the alternative
speaker in the event that Shultz
could not attend the ceremo
ny.
Shultz's appointment
Last July Shultz left his job as
president of the Bechtel Cor
poration, a huge international
engineering and construction
firm, to assume the office of
secretary of state. His appoint
ment — announced simultane
ously with the resignation of
then Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig — came as no sur
prise. Shultz was one of the
leading candidates for the post
before Reagan took office, but
lost out to Haig in the last stages
of the transition.
In addition to the Bechtel
job, Shultz also had to give up
his position as a part-time pro
fessor in the Business School.
During his Senate confirmation
hearings last July, Shultz
quipped that he could only ac
cept the position "if the Stan
ford board of trustees grants
me a leave of absence."
Since he joined the faculty of
the Business School in 1974,
Shultz has taught one course a
year on public management.
His association with the tjnl
versity began in 1968 when he
served a year as a fellow at the

Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences.
Shultz continues to maintain
a home on campus and he oc
casionally entertains world
leaders there. Recently former
West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt — a close
friend of Shuitz's — was a guest
at his campus residence. Last
summer Shultz hosted Schmidt
and former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger during their
brief visits.
Shultz has compiled an il
lustrious career in education,
government and business,
moving back and forth among
the three areas with ease. His
career in government began in
1955 when he served on the
Council of Economic Advisors,
while he was a professor at the
University of Chicago. Under
the Nixon administration he
held a variety of cabinet posi
tions including secretary of the
treasury, commerce and labor
and director of the office of
management and budget.
In education, Shuitz's career
began in 1948 when he joined
the faculty of the Massachu
setts Institution of Technology
as an associate professor. Later,
he moved to the University of
Chicago and became a dean of
the Graduate School of Busi
ness there in 1962.
First year In office
The most important effects
that Shultz has had on U.S. for
eign policy since taking office
relate more to His style than his
ideology. Although his ideol


George Shultz
ogical perspective isquitesimi
lar to that of his predecessor
and other Reagan adminis
tration hardliners, Shultz's
cool, pragmatic style has
enabled him to smooth over
many of the controversies
plaguing Haig's rocky term.
Political Science Prof. Alex
ander George said the secre
tary of state's biggest c ontribu
tion has been the stabilizing in
fluence he has had on U.S. for
eign policy. "He's given the
public a basis for confidence.
He's a thoughtful man who
takes advice and has a calming
influence on foreign policy."

His abilities as a conciliator
have also aided mediating ef
forts such as the troop with
drawal negotiations he helped
work out among the govern
ments of Lebanon, Israel and
Syria. In addition, his con
siderable skills at behind-the
scenes manuevering helped
him to achieve his first major
success: relaxing the tensions
between the United States and
its West European allies over
the natural gas pipeline from
the Soviet Union to Europe
When Shultz took office the
rift over the pipeline was put
ting a great strain on relations
within the NATO alliance.
France and West Germany sup
ported the pipeline and the


George Shultz '»nd British Foreign Minister George Pym met informally at Shuit/'s home.
Reagan administration was ac
tively opposing it by penalizing
U.S. corporations which sold
technology that contributed to
the project.
Several months after assum
ing his post, Shultz engineered
a deal that ended with the
United States softening sanc

tions against the corporations
that fulfilled theirpipelinecon
tracts.
George said the way Shultz
operated on the issue "was typ
ical of his style, he works quiet
ly behind the scenes."
However, some analysts,
such as History Prof. Barton
Bernstein question whether
Shultz represents any substan
tive difference from Haig. "It's
not clear that his policies are

different," Bernstein said.
"The salient difference is
that Shultz has the president's
trust — he's not running for
president." As a result of the
greater confidence he has
earned from Reagan, Bernstein
said, Shultz is able to exert
greater power.
Failures in office
Ironically, Shultz's careful,
but low-key approach to issues
— which has led to his impor
tant accomplishments — has
also resulted in failures.
George considered Shultz's
major shortcoming to be in the
area of arms control, where the
U. S. has failed to make
progress in negotiations with
the Soviet Union — especially
in the controversial area of
middle range European mis
siles. He said Shultz has failed
to take control of U.S. policy,
instead delegating authority
for that area to the deputy sec
retary of state.
"The converse to his careful
approach is that he is unable to
take initiative on many issues,"
he said.
Bernstein agreed, saying "If
one is concerned about the
arms race there's no evidence
that he has taken any leader
ship in negotiations."
Bernstein was also highly
critical of Shultz for not effect
ing any changes in the Reagan
administration policy in Cen
tral America. He believes that
aid officially given to guerrillas
in Nicaragua to halt the alleged

arms movement between that
nation and El Salvador looks
like a disguised attempt to ov
erthrow the government of
Nicaragua. "I think that one
could ask real questions about
whether Reagan and Shultz are
sliding along the veneer of le
gality and acting in extralegal
ways," Bernstein said.
In regards to U.S. aid to El
Salvador, he said Shultz and
Reagan would be limited in in
creased interventionism there
by the American public. "The
greatest thing that happened
to Shultz and Reagan is Viet
nam," Bernstein said.
George criticized the Rea
gan administration's policy on
Central America on other
grounds — its lack of
coherence. He said, "they have
yet to work out a well-designed
policy."
In the coming year Shultz's
ability — or inability — to solve
problems and formulate and
carry out appropriate policies
should become even more ap
parent as issues such as the
Lebanon civil war, the Central
American conflict and the im
pending deployment of medi
um range missiles in Europe
become even more pressing.
