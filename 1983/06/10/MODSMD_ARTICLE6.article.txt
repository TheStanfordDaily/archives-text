# Student sashes symbolize dissatisfaction
## 
### MIKE HALE 
Campus visitors — and Sec
retary of State George Shultz in
particular — will be the au
dience this weekend for an ar
ray of protests directed against
the foreign policies of the Rea
gan administration.
A loose coalition of campus
groups, formed in response to
Shultz's selection as commen
cement speaker, will distribute
flyers, present petitions, hold a
press conference and memori
al service and provide orange
sashes reading "Respect Hu
man Rights" for graduating
students to wear during Sun
day's ceremony.
Protest organizers, mindful
of the disruption earlier this
year at UC-Berkeley of a
speech by U.N. Ambassador
jeanne Kirkpatrick, have em
phasized that they do not plan
to interfere with Shultz's ad
dress.
The protest will be most vis
ible when it culminates Sunday
during the commencement
ceremony. Graduating stu
dents will be encouraged to
wear sashes and carry placards,
and large banners may appear
during Shultz's speech. Stu
dents will be offered sashes by
the protestors when they
gather at Maples Pavilion,
before proceeding in a group
to Frost Amphitheater. Coali

tion members also hope to
have armbands to distribute to
commencement guests.
A straw poll taken by coali
tion members earlier this week
indicated that 60 percent of
graduating seniors would not
wear a sash, with another 20
percent undecided at that
time. The coalition plans to
have 900 sashes available to dis
tribute among the 2000 stu
dents expected to attend.
Protest activity will begin Sat
urday with the distribution of
flyers before and after the bac
calaureate service and during
Class Day events. Faculty, stu
dent and community petitions
protesting various aspects of
U.S. foreign policy will be pre
sented at an 8 a.m. press con
ference Sunday outside Frost.
The conference will be fol
lowed by a memorial service
"tor the victims of violence and
human rights violations result
ing from U.S. foreign policy,"
which will immediately pre
cede the commencement cer
emony.
Among those speaking at the
service will be theologian and
former Stanford faculty mem
ber Robert McAfee Brown,
Dean of the Chapel Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, and Rev.
Gene Boyle of the Stanford
Newman Center.
The coalition has brought to

gether, under the banner of
human rights, groups protest
ing specific aspects of U.S. poli
cy. Four primary issues appear
to underlie the protest: U.S.
military aid to Central America,
arms control, tensions in the
Middle East and U.S. economic
involvement in, and coopera
tion with, South Africa.
The petitions to be present
ed tomorrow include one call
ing on Shultz to put pressure
on South Africa to release polit
ical prisoners, while others re
late directly to Central America
and the Middle East. A petition
being distributed among Stan

ford faculty and staff calls for
specific actions in all four areas,
under a general expression of
"opposition to the Reagan Ad
ministration's apparent dis
regard for human rights in its
foreign policies."
Paul Hodgdon, a protest or
ganizer and graduating senior,
said the coordinated protests
"hopefully will show that the
issues are interrelated .. . you
can't understand disarmament
without understanding"
events in the Middle East and
Central America.
Hodgdon said political pro
tests during commencement

are justified because it was a
"political move" on the Uni
versity's part to invite Shultz to
speak. "Not protesting would
be political itself," he said.
Protest organizers agree that
the focus of the protest is on
U.S. policy, and not Shultz
himself. "It doesn't matter
who's there," Hodgdon said,
citing the recent removals of
Thomas Endersand Deane Hin
ton from diplomatic posts in
Latin America as evidence that
State Department represent
atives of U.S. foreign policy
have little say in determining
that policy.
