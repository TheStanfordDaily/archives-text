# Rev. Read to deliver sermon
## 
### SHELLY WENTKER 
On Saturday, June 11, the Reverend David
Read, minister of the Madison Avenue Presbyte
rian Church in New York City, will deliver the
baccalaureate sermon for Stanford's 92nd an
nual commencement.
Born and educated in Scotland, Read earned
degrees at Daniel Stewart's College, the Uni
veristy of Edinburgh and New College. He has
been awarded honorary degrees from ten other
institutitons, including Yale, Trinity and the
Japan International Christian University.
Read was ordained in Scotland in 193 band
servea in the ministry there until 1956, when he
came to his present position.
A noted author, Read has published articles in
numerous magazines, including The Atlantic
Montly, The British Weekly, The Christian
Herald, and Christianity Today, among others. In
addition, he has written 25 books since 1939, his
most recent, The Faith is Still There, being pub
lished in 1980.
Read is also a prominent speaker. Having de
livered baccalaureate speeches at Duke, Prince
ton Theological Seminary and Stanford (in 1966),
Read is "the sort of person who's a natural for
this kind of assignment," according to Robert
Hamerton-Kelly, dean of the chapel.
Hamerton-Kelly said that the baccalaureate
speaker is chosen partly on the basis of his re
ligious affiliation. "We've tried to invite Protes
tants, Catholics and Jews in rotation," he added.

This year's speaker being designated as Protes
tant, it was no surprise that Read was chosen.
"When one thinks of Protestant preac hers, Read
is the one you think of," Hamerton-Kelly said.
Not knowing Read personally but by his repu
tation, Hamerton-Kelly invited him to speak at
Stanford after hearing him at Harvard. Usually,
this decision is made in conjunction with the
same committee that elects the commencement
speaker, Hamerton-Kelly explained. "However,
this year, as things worked out, I invited the
baccalaureate speaker without specific consul
tation," he said. Feeling that too much time
would be involved in contacting the committee
and then getting back to Read, Hamerton-Kelly
said that when he saw Read at Harvard, "I
thought I'd better do it then."
The committee seems pleased with
Hamerton-Kelly's decision. He added, "I'm
happy to say I've heard no objections from the
committee yet."
The baccalaureate service will be held at 9:30
a.m. in front of Memorial Church in the Inner
Quad. Hamerton-Kelly estimated that based on
previous years' attendance, about 2000 people
will be present.
In addition to Read, others who will partici
pate in the service will include President
Donald Kennedy, Rabbi Cartun, Father Boyle,
and the Senior Class presidents, Hamerton-
Kelly said.
