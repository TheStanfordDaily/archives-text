# COMMENCEMENTS PAST
## 92 years of commencement: a trivia primer 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
The history of the Universi
ty's commencement exercises
may serve no real purpose
other than being great material
for a Stanford trivia bowl. But
what's the difference? Co
ahead — read on and bone up
on the University's com
mencement history. . . .
Okay, where were most
commencements held prior to
1938? Clue: Its small size be
came a problem as enrollment
grew.
'Memorial Church. After 1938
the University has held com
mencement exercises in Frost
Amphitheater.
Where was the first com
mencement held?
Roble Gym. According to
Fred Glover, Class of '33 and
former executive assistant to
the University president,
evergreens and flowers deco
rated what was then a tempor
ary frame building.

According to Eric Hutchinson, a chemistry
professor here for 36 years, the ceremony
became cumbersome. 'We all fried in Frost
Amphitheater/ he said. 'The present ar
rangement is much better. It no longer looks
like an assembly line. . . . We have more in
timate ceremonies/

Who was the speaker the one
time commencement was held
in the Stadium? Clue: He was a
member of the tirst class that
graduated from Stanford, and
his wife - also a Stanford
graduate - was named Lou
Henry. While a student here,
this speaker forgot to bring the
football to the first Big Came.
Former U.S. President Her
bert Hoover.
Former Prof. Harold Bacon,
Class of '28, 50-year resident of
the white house with the roses
next to the Betas, and com
mencement marshall from
1914-72, estimated that more
than 15,000 attended the
Hoover speech in the 90,000
capacity arena. "A lot left," he
said, after Hoover gave his
speech.
According to Donald Win
bigler, former registrar,
academic secretary and dean

of students for 17years, "It was
a very good talk. It was brief
and to the point." Incidentally,
Winbigler attended every
commencement from 1940-
1975.
With all the fuss about a shor
tage of commencement tic
kets, why hasn't the University
continued to hold com
mencement exercises in the
Stadium?
Bacon said the Stadium's at
mosphere was wrong for
commencement. "It (the
Stadium) was too big a place."
By contrast, Laurence Frost
Amphitheater, home of each
commencement since 1938, "is
an ideal place."
Has it always been difficult to
obtain commencement tic
kets?
Bacon said it has. He added,
"The number of tickets has de
creased steadily."
Has commencement ever
been rained out?

Amazingly, it never has.
Have students always re
ceived their diplomas at de
partment ceremonies?
No. Up until about 10 years
ago — during Dick Lyman's
presidency — the University
president awarded the dip
lomas at Frost. But the cere
mony grew too long.
Historical Society President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Jr., Class of
'33 and son of third University
President Wilbur (1916-43),
said his father spoke at every
commencement and person
ally gave every graduating stu
dent their diploma.
According to trie Hutchison,
a chemistry professor here for
36 years, the ceremony be
came cumbersome. "We all
fried in Frost Amphitheater,"
he said. "The present ar
rangement is much better. It
no longer looks like an assem-

bly line. . . . We have more in
timate ceremonies."
He added, "there were many
mistakes in the old days." For
example, students occasion
ally received the wrong dip
lomas. "People were swapping
them around," Hutchison said.
The registrar and the
academic secretary gave the
diplomas to the University
president. For many years stu
dents told their names — or
sometimes fictitious names —
to "readers." As a result, the
name of Warren G. Wonka, a
fictitious campus mischief
maker similar to World War ll's
Kilroy, was called one com
mencement.
Has the University ever en
forced a strict time limit on
speeches?
No. But someone once gave
an hour-long speech. Former
marshall Bacon — whose
father was a member of the
Class of '02 — said, "I won't say
who."
Did professors and students
always wear robes at com
mencement?
No. According to Glover, the
entire class did not wear caps
and gowns until 1906. Students
apparently considered the cus
tom "medieval." In 1899 a
female student started the cap
and gown movement, ordering
herself and other women caps
and gowns.
Where was commencement
held 1906-14, when the ear
thquake damaged Mem Chu?
Birge Clark, Class of '14, said
his commencement was held
in the Auditorium (also called
the Assembly Hall) which cur
rently houses the communica
tions department and formerly
housed the Business School. A
class picture was taken in the
Inner Quad, however, which
has led some to think com
mencement was held in the
Quad.
Glover added that in 1906 the
University deferred com
mencement until September
15.
Has a live band always pro
vided the music for the cere
mony?
No. Prior to 1966, organ
music was used Before the late
'40s, organ music was piped
into the Amphitheater from
Memorial Church. Then after
Music Prof. Herber Nanney

came here as University or
ganist in 1947, he played a re
nted electric organ in the Am
phitheater. "they decided it
was easier if I had eyeball con
tact," he said.
How did the Daily treat
commencement?
Well, in 1941 — back when a
year's tuition was $345 — the
Daily printed the names of
everyone who graduated with
distinction. That same year
class orators — along with Uni
versity president John Branner
— gave speeches at com
mencement.
Back then the Daily printed
the full text of the main speech,
apparently always given by a
top University official, in the
commencement issues.
Who designed the com
mencement flags?
Eric Hutchison, a chemistry
professor here for 36years, de
signed them.
Have most commencement

Political speakers have included Watergate
Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox in 1974
(three months before then President Nixon
resigned) 112 U.N. Ambassador Daniel Patrick
Moynihan in 1975, U.N. Ambassador An
drew Young in 1979, Deputy Secretary of
State Warren Christopher in 1981 and
Sandra Day O'Connor last year.

speakers been political figures?
Contrary to recent popular
belief, the majority of com
mencement speakers are not
political figures. University
presidents (both of Stanford
and of other universities), par
ticularly Wilbur, have been the
most "prolific" speakers.
Other speakers have included
a secretary of Housing and
Urban Development, a former
secretary of Labor and a UC-
Berkeley chancellor.
If Kennedy speaks today, it
will not be the first time— he
spoke in 1978, while head of the
Food and Drug Administration.
Political speakers have in
cluded Watergate Special Pro
secutor Archilbald Cox ir 1974
(three months before then
President Richard Nixon res
igned), U.N. Ambassador
Daniel Patrick Moynihin in
1975, U.N. Ambassador An-

drew Young in 1979, Deputy
Secretary of State Warren
Christopher in 1981 and Sandra
Day O'Connor last year.
And the speeches have not
always been serious. In 1967
John Fischer, editor-in-chief of
Harper's magazine, included in
his "four choices" for graduat
ing students "dropping out"
and "trying to change the
world gradually."
Are disruptions common?
The silent protestors this
year are not the first to "dis
rupt" the generally sedate —
except for the champagne —
commencement exercises.
Bacon said minor distractions
are the rule: "There usually
was a dog in Frost Amphithea
ter that would dash across the
stage."
When the conservative
Moynihan spoke in 1975, many
walked out to protest his selec
tion as U.N. ambassador.
Has the commencement

speaker selection process
changed?
According to Glover, who
should know, yes. Student in
volvement did not really begin
until the late '60s. "This long
selection process is in the last
15 years," he said. Student
committees are relatively new.
Has the Band always rushed
up on stage after the cere
mony?
No. It remains to be seen if
this event — which has only
happened twice, according to
Music Prof. Art Barnes, will be
come yet another in a long line
of Stanford commencement
traditions.
For anyone who is truly in
terested in more information
on the subject, look for Stan
ford University: The First 25
Years, a hard-to-come-by book
by former University Registrar
Eron Elliott.



In 1935, graduation was held in Stanford Stadium, and the commencement speaker was Herbert Hoover. Last year, in Frost, the ceremonies were more relaxed.
