# Shultz addresses graduating students
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
Popping champagne corks
and drifting balloons provided
an exuberant background to
Secretary of State George
Shultz's reaffirmation of current
Reagan administration foreign
policies at the University's 92nd
Commencement June 12.
The more than 15,000 sun
baked guests and graduates at
the ceremonies in Frost Am
phitheater celebrated enthusias
tically while alternately politely
cheering and emphatically bo
oing Shultz's plea for Western
unity and military strength.
Claiming that the "old divi
sions within the Alliance are nar
rowing," Shultz stressed the im
portance of NATO defense
capabilities.
"If the values and interests we
have in common are truly preci
ous to us," he said, "then we
have a duty to defend them."
Shultz, who is on leave from
his position as a professor in the
Graduate School of Business,
drew his biggest applause from
the polite but divided crowd
when he spoke against nuclear
war.
"A nuclear war cannot be
won, and must never be
fought," he said.
But, after waiting for the sus
tained and enthusiastic applause
to die down, Shultz added.
"That's a quote from Ronald Re
agan." Many graduates booed
what student protesters later
called a "sneaky" political ploy.
Shultz departed slightly from
his prepared text to respond to
the sashes bearing the slogan
"respect human rights" worn by

900 graduates and faculty mem
bers as part of the protest against
his speech.
After listing several things the
NATO allies have in common,
Shultz added, "And I may say re
spect for human rights!"
However, Shultz never
touched on the topic of U.S.
policies in Central America —
one of the major issues of the
protest — during his speech.
Shultz reiterated the Reagan
administration position that
strength must be a precondition
for arms control negotiations.
"We are willing to negotiate
differences — but we cannot do
so effectively if we are weak," he
said, "or if the Soviet Union be
lieves it can achieve its objec
tives without any compromise.
"Therefore, both these tracks
— strength and diplomacy — are
essential."
If current negotiations on
intermediate-range missiles in
Europe do not succeed, Shultz
said, the United States must be
prepared to deploy missiles in
Europe at the end of the year.
"The Soviet Union has no
higher priority goal at the mo
ment than to intimidate NATO
into cancelling its deployments
unilaterally," he said, "thereby
leaving the Soviet Union with its
massive monopoly of new mis
siles and warheads already in
place."
Shultz said the expansion of
Soviet power has necessitated a
strong and unyielding American
response.
"Any president, any adminis
tration, would be forced to re
spond," he said.

Throughout history, the im
balance of power has served as
an invitation to conflict, Shultz
said. Therefore, the Reagan ad
ministration is committed to
maintaining the "military bal
ance."
"Surely the burden of proof is
on those who would undo the
- present military balance, or alter
it, or conduct risky experiments
with unilateral concessions
without genuinely reducing the
levels of armaments on both
sides."
Throughout the ceremonies,
the jubilant graduates unloosed
scores of flying champagne
corks.
"Missed me!" Shultz declared
after one errant cork came par
ticularly close to the podium.
After Shultz's address and the
conferral of degrees, University
President Donald Kennedy en
tertained the approximately 2800
graduates with a lively and witty
speech about "life after Stan
ford."
Kennedy apologized for the
necessarily "avuncular, not to
say preachy" tone of his speech.
But "that's the inevitable part of
this ritual," he said. "It just
wouldn't be complete without
farewell advice, so relax and try
to enjoy it."
Kennedy urged the graduates
to "put some of the talent, en
ergy and training you possess
into public service."
A former commissioner of the
Food and Drug Administration
during the Carter administra
tion, Kennedy said public ser
vice jobs have become less ap
pealing because of the state of

the economy, the comfort and
financial advantage of private
life, and the "national rediscov
ery of entrepreneurship."
But "our passion for the en
trepreneurial chase should not
blind us to some fundamentals,"
Kennedy added.
"Despite what we are told by
the best-selling Corporate
Futurists, we cannot live in some
Mandevillian beehive run en
tirely on smokeless informa
tion," he said, "in which half the
inhabitants are venture

capitalists and the other half
software designers."
The commencement cere
monies also provided an oppor
tunity for the University to pre
sent its highest service and
teaching award*.
The Walter J. Gores awards for
excellence in teaching were pre
sented to English Prof. Albert
Guerard, Asst. Anthropology
Prof. William Durham and Politi
cal Science Teaching Assistant
James Steyer.
