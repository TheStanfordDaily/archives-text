## Stanford Blood Bank screens donors for AIDS signs 
### ALEX TARG 
In an effort to ensure that Ac
quired Immune Deficiency Syn
drome (AIDS) is not spread
through blood transfusion*. the
Stanford Blood Bank will begin
July 1 to screen all blood donors
for an abnormality trequentlv
associated with the syndrome.
A new disease which was un
known to medicine only three
years ago, AIDS has gained
notoriety in medical circles re
cently because of its high mortal
ity rate and the increasing rate at
which new cases are being
found.
New AIDS cases have gradu
ally increased in frequency from
an average rate of one per day in
1981 to almost four per day by
early this year.
Of the 1200 people diagnosed
world-wide since 1981, 95 per
cent of the cases are male and 75
percent are gay. Almost 75 per
cent of the cases reported so far
in the United States are in
California and New York.
Although the cause of the dis
ease is unknown, a leading hy
pothesis implicates common gay
sexual practices and large num
bers of sexual partners in the
AIDS spread However, accord

ing to the Centers for Disease
Control, "airborne spread and
interpersonal spread through
casual contact are not likely, and
is presently no evidence of
AIDS transmission to hospital
personnel from contact with af
fected patients or clinical speci
mens."
According to Thomas Meri
gan, professor of medicine and
infectious diseases, the hysteria
surrounding the possible link
between AIDS and the gay popu
lation may help to slow the
spread of the disease.
"Since the number of sexual
contacts is crucial, I expect thp
rate of occurence of AIDS to
drop due to changing behavior
patterns before the disease is
clinically understood," Merigan
said.
AIDS is also prevalent among
intravenous injectors of illicit
drugs who share needles, Hai
tian immigrants and
hemophiliacs.
AIDS is a disease complex
which destroys the victim's
normal immune system, render
ing the body's principal line of
defense against disease useless.
As a consequence, normally
harmless organisms can become

lethal to those afflicted with
AIDS.
Normally, these same or
ganisms are seldom fatal and are
found only in people with severe
underlying illnesses such as
leukemia or in patients receiving
intensive therapy with drugs
known to suppress the immune
system (such as in kidney trans
plant patients to prevent organ
rejection).
However, for AIDS sufferers,
those diseases can prove deadly.
According to Merigan, "what
provokes concern when dealing
with AIDS is the quickening
tempo of the disease's spread.
The transmission mode of the
disease seems similar to that of
hepatitis, a common disease in
the United States afflicting
300,000 annually.
"The big difference between
the two is that AIDS kills at least
60 percent of those diagnosed,
whereas 99 percent of hepatitis
sufferers recover," Merigan
said. "Investigators do not yet
know of any AIDS patients who
have regained lost immunity, so
survivors continue to be at spe
cial risk of opportunistic infec
tion."
Current treatments for the

disease at Stanford focus on re
ducing the impact of infections
using the naturally occuring pro
tein and the experimental drug,
interferon.
"Interferon previously has
been used with success in other
immunosuppressed patients, so
it is a logical treatment to try with
AIDS patients," Merigan said.
According to Merigan, vac
cines against AIDS probably wiM

not appear in the immediate fu
ture because scientists have not
yet identified the organism or
organisms responsible for the
disease.
In order to make a vaccine
scientists need to purify an or
ganism's coat protein or grow it
in a laboratory culture, some
thing that has not been done for
AIDS, Merigan said.
