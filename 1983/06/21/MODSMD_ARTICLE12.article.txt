sented with flowers at Class Day festivities in Bowman Grove;
many students displayed their excitement by wearing outrageous
attire; Secretary of State George Shultz gave the commencement
address to a near record crowd in Frost Amphitheater; students
demonstrated against Shultz's role in the formulation of Ameri
can foreign policy, many wearing sashes bearing the slogan
"Respect Human Rights"; the day before graduation included
the sealing of the time capsule in the Quad, where students were
invited to throw their IDs and meal cards into the capsule.
