Angeles, W. Glenn
Campbell, director of the
Hoover Institution and 16-
year member of the board,

in t%!f. rhe vote may suggest
the existence of a political
struggle between the conser
vative and liberal members of
Board of Regents.
According to the Peninsula
itmv s Tribune , Wada's
nomination on May 21 may
have been mad< possible by
the tact that Lt Gov. Leo
McCarthy cast a vote in place
of the absent Gov. George
Deukmejian.
Campbell could not be
reached for comment.

In Friday's vote, Wada re
ceived 16 votes, one more
than the 15 necessary for

rector of the Hoover Institu
tion, which he has occupied
since 1960, is unaffected by
this decision.

his position as chairman of
the White House Intelligence
Oveisight Board and as a
member of the president's
