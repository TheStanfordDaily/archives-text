Basketball
Stanford splits its first two
tests in the Kiran World Basket
ball Tournament, a four-team in
ternational event in Japan from
June 18-26.
With six Cardinal players scor
ing in double figures Sunday,
Stanford beat Japan 94-74 in the
second of six exhibition games
to even its tournament record at
1-1.

Coach Tom Davis' Cardinal
was stunned in Saturday's
opener by New Zealand 89-88
despite a 29-point effort by
guard Keith (ones. Stanford next
plays the fourth team in the
tournament, Great Britain.

In other basketball news, as
sistant coach Cory Russell left
Stanford two weeks ago for a
similar position at UC-Santa
Barabara. Russell will join
recently-acquired Jerry Pimm,
who coached Utah to a Cin
derella showing in the NCAA
tournament this spring.
Baseball
Stanford waded three games
deep into the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb., for the
second straight year before
being knocked out of the eight
team double elimination tour
nament by Michigan 11-4 Wed
nesday, June 8.
The Cardinal was on the short
end of a 3-1 decision against
Oklahoma State in the opener,
but rebounded two days later to
beat James Madison by the same
score. Michigan, however,
broke open a close game Wed
nesday night with a late-inning
grand slam to send the Cardinal
home on an early flight.
With its second trip to Omaha
in as many years, Stanford has
established itself as a collegiate
baseball power.
Designated hitter Eric
Hardgrave was named to the
Ail-American first team while
first baseman Mike Aldrete re
aped third-team honors. Both
Hardgrave, the Pacific-10 South
ern Division Player of the Year,
and Aldrete were named to the
NCAA District-8 first team.
Stanford advanced to the Col
lege World Series by capturing
the NCAA West Regional I
championship, a four-team
double elimination tournament
it hosted.
The Cardinal qualified for the

regional by winning the Pac-10
Southern Division, its first
league title since 1967. Coach
Mark Marquess, the Pac-10
Southern Division Coach of the
Year, directed Stanford to a
20-10 league and a4l-17-1 overall
record.
Track
The Stanford women's track
team placed sixth with 60 points
at the NCAA Championships in
Houston, Texas, in early June.
But what makes the sixth-place
showing so respectable is that
the Cardinal did it with only six
qualifiers.
Two Cardinal women —
freshman Alison Wiley and
junior Carol Cady—won indi
vidual titles. Wiley shattered an
NCAA record in the 3,000 meters
with a 9:03.51 clocking, while
teammate PattiSue Plumer
finished second in 9:10.22.
Cady took first in the shot put
and second in the discus, al
though she was given a better
chance to win the latter event.
Her throw of 56 feet in the shot
was good enough to beat out
Long Beach State's Peggy Pol
lock by more than a foot.
In the javelin, Mary Osborne
finished 11th with a throw of
155-5. Regina lacobs placed 12th
in the 1500 meters after setting a
meet and school record in the
qualifying heat.
Only two members of the
men's team competed in Hous
ton and only one was able to
score for Stanford. Sophomore
Shawn Pickering placed 12th in
the hammer with a toss of 201-3
to account for the Cardinal's
only point.

Crew
The Stanford women's crew
team rowed to a fourth place
finish at the National Collegiate
Women's Rowing Champion
ships in Madison, Wl.
While Pacific-10 rival Wash

ington rowed away with the title,
covering the 1500 meter course
in 4:57.50, Stanford was not far
behind a pair of national crew
powers in second and third
place. Dartmouth finished sec
ond in 5:03.02 and Wisconsin
fourth in 5:03.06. Stanford, the
smallest crew in the final, was
fourth at 5:05.72.

Baseball
Stanford waded three games
deep into the College World
Series in Omaha, Neb., for the
second straight year before
being knocked out of the eight
team double elimination tour
nament by Michigan 11-4 Wed
nesday, June 8.
The Cardinal was on the short
end of a 3-1 decision against
Oklahoma State in the opener,
but rebounded two days later to
beat James Madison by the same
score. Michigan, however,
broke open a close game Wed
nesday night with a late-inning
grand slam to send the Cardinal
home on an early flight.
With its second trip to Omaha
in as many years, Stanford has
established itself as a collegiate
baseball power.
Designated hitter Eric
Hardgrave was named to the
Ail-American first team while
first baseman Mike Aldrete re
aped third-team honors. Both
Hardgrave, the Pacific-10 South
ern Division Player of the Year,
and Aldrete were named to the
NCAA District-8 first team.
Stanford advanced to the Col
lege World Series by capturing
the NCAA West Regional I
championship, a four-team
double elimination tournament
it hosted.
The Cardinal qualified for the

regional by winning the Pac-10
Southern Division, its first
league title since 1967. Coach
Mark Marquess, the Pac-10
Southern Division Coach of the
Year, directed Stanford to a
20-10 league and a4l-17-1 overall
record.
Track
The Stanford women's track
team placed sixth with 60 points
at the NCAA Championships in
Houston, Texas, in early June.
But what makes the sixth-place
showing so respectable is that
the Cardinal did it with only six
qualifiers.
Two Cardinal women —
freshman Alison Wiley and
junior Carol Cady—won indi
vidual titles. Wiley shattered an
NCAA record in the 3,000 meters
with a 9:03.51 clocking, while
teammate PattiSue Plumer
finished second in 9:10.22.
Cady took first in the shot put
and second in the discus, al
though she was given a better
chance to win the latter event.
Her throw of 56 feet in the shot
was good enough to beat out
Long Beach State's Peggy Pol
lock by more than a foot.
In the javelin, Mary Osborne
finished 11th with a throw of
155-5. Regina lacobs placed 12th
in the 1500 meters after setting a
meet and school record in the
qualifying heat.
Only two members of the
men's team competed in Hous
ton and only one was able to
score for Stanford. Sophomore
Shawn Pickering placed 12th in
the hammer with a toss of 201-3
to account for the Cardinal's
only point.

Crew
The Stanford women's crew
team rowed to a fourth place
finish at the National Collegiate
Women's Rowing Champion
ships in Madison, Wl.
While Pacific-10 rival Wash

ington rowed away with the title,
covering the 1500 meter course
in 4:57.50, Stanford was not far
behind a pair of national crew
powers in second and third
place. Dartmouth finished sec
ond in 5:03.02 and Wisconsin
fourth in 5:03.06. Stanford, the
smallest crew in the final, was
fourth at 5:05.72.
