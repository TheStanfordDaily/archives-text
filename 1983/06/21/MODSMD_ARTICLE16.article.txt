# Scott Davis loses at Wimbledon

Wimbledon — A ghost out of
Stanford's past haunted Stan
ford's newest tennis profes
sional as Sandy Mayer defeated
Scott Davis 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 yesterday
in the first round of the Wimble
don Tennis Championship.
It was a tough draw for Davis.
Mayer, who left Stanford in 1973
after winning the NCAA singles
title, was ranked 16th nationally
last year and was in top form for
the match.
Mayer was in control from the
start. He dominated the match
on Wimbledon's grass courts
with his devastating serve that
Davis had difficulty returning.
"I never got into it mentally,"
Davis said following the contest.
"Physically, he just outplayed
me."
Davis won the toss and
elected to serve. After taking a
2-1 lead in the first set, Davis lost
four straight games.
Mayer immediately broke
Davis in the second set, and that
was all he needed as the younger
Davis had difficulty with Mayer's
serve all afternoon.
The key game in the final set

was the third. With the score
tied at 1-1 and Davis serving at
40-15, Mayer racked up four
straight points — the first two on
line calls disputed by Davis — to
capture the game.
Davis had an up-and-down
season at Stanford this past year.
Plagued by mononucleosis, he
had to sit out part of the season
and never fully recovered; how
ever, he played well enough to
lead Stanford to the NCAA
championships last May.
Now recovered from his ill
ness, Davis feels that he still isn't
in top form physically. "I'm not
in the best shape right now," he
said. "With time, I'll get in better
shape, but it will take a couple of
months."
Stanford tennis coach Dick
Could, who was at Wimbledon,
had a rough time trying to catch
all his Stanford proteges. In all,
nine ex-Stanford players are in
the tournament. Tim Mayotte,
who won the NCAA singles title
as an undergraduate in 1981 and
reached the quarterfinals and
semifinals of Wimbledon the last
two years, defeated American
Mark Dickson 7-5, 6-3, 6-3.
