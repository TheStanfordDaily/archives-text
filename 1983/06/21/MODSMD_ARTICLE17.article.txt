# Faculty debate on weapons research continues
## 
### MIKE HALE 
In March the Faculty Senate
asked a University committee to
"study the volume and character
of weapons-related research at
Stanford.''
On June 9 the senate, after a
sometimes heated discussion,
"receive(d) with thanks" the
committee's report and put off
action on the issue until this fall,
when the same committee will
probably be asked more or less
the same question.

News Analysis

This episode—part of the
furor surrounding a controver
sial research proposal at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL) —epitomized
the currently tentative nature of
the debate over weapons re
search on campus, a debate
likely to grow louder, wider and
more acrimonious in the future.

Faculty Senate discussion of
weapons research has a neurotic
quality to it, because there are
usually two different issues
being discussed simultaneously,
one in the open and one just
below the surface:
• Does the University's 1971
"Statement of Principles Con
cerning Research" adequately
protect researchers' academic
freedom now that plural
research—research involving
the efforts of more than one re
search team or laboratory—is
becoming more common?
• Should Stanford be engaged in
"weapons research" at all, and if
so, to what degree?
The first issue— whether or
not Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center researchers, whose work
provides essential support for
research at SSRL, will be forced
into "involuntary servitude" if a
project of which they do not ap
prove is carried out at SSRL—is

the focus of discussion.
But the second issue, which is
always threatening to break out
in to the open, generates much
greater emotions, and it is the
faculty's unwillingness thus far
toaddress it openly that has frus
trated debate.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Meindl, chairman of the
University's Committee on Re
search (C-Res), reported at the
June 9 senate meeting that C-Res
had been unable to define
"weapons-related research"
and had "concluded that virtu
ally all research done at Stanford
could conceivably have some
military application."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
replied that while his own re
search into Shakespeare's his
tory plays could conceivably
have a military application, he
felt it must be possible to place
research projects on a "spec
trum" according to their degree

of weapons-relatedness. He
called the committee's assertion
"ridiculous" and an attempt to
evade the issues.
History Prof. Paul Robinson
agreed, saying that while the dis
tinction between weapons
related and non-weapons
related research is not easy to
draw, "this report hasn't even
addressed the problem of draw
ing the distinction."
The C-Res report reflected a
reluctance, held by many faculty
members, to judge research
projects according to their ap
plications as long as the projects
contribute to basic knowledge
and conform to existing Univer
sity research policies. Other
professors are frustrated with
this reluctance. But to resolve
this difference, the problem that
faced C-Res must be solved:
How do you decide whether a
project is "weapons-related"?
Several methods have been

proposed. Most faculty mem
bers seem to agree that the
levels of funding received from
certain government agencies—
the Department of Defense
(DOD) and the Deprtment of
Energy (DOE) —are significant
indicators of the level of
weapons-related research being
done. This raises separate issues
of departmental reliance on
single government agencies and
the effect of this on graduate
students, but it doesn't help in
deciding whether individual
projects are weapons-related.
A more promising method,
and one which will probably be
taken up by the senate this fall, is
judging by the declared intent of
the research sponsor. Opinions
of this "end-use" criterion vary;
on the one hand, SLAC Prof.
Robert Mozley said SLAC re
searchers "know when they are
doing weapons research"; on
the other, Sociology Prof. Sandy
Dornbusch called this criterion "
a very weak one" because a lot
of basic research gets done in
the name of military applica
tions.
No matter how weapons
related research is defined,
however—and no one would
deny that some research proj
ects are more weapons-related
than others—the underlying
issue remains whether the Uni
versity should regulate it. This
will remain the issue regardless
of how the current SLAC/SSRL
controversy is settled, and could
lead this fall to proposals for
change in University research
policies.
So far, no one in the senate
has interrupted the discussion
of how to judge weapons
relatedness to say that he is op
posed to weapons research in
principle. But there are indica
tions.
Rebholz went so far as to say,
"Some of us detest weapons
related research, but that's not
the issue—we just want more in
formation." To which Radiology
Prof. William Northway was
probably replying when he
claimed, "There are groups try
ing to change University re
search policy. More study won't
give us more information."

weapons research has a neurotic
quality to it, because there are
usually two different issues
being discussed simultaneously,
one in the open and one just
below the surface:
• Does the University's 1971
"Statement of Principles Con
cerning Research" adequately
protect researchers' academic
freedom now that plural
research—research involving
the efforts of more than one re
search team or laboratory—is
becoming more common?
• Should Stanford be engaged in
"weapons research" at all, and if
so, to what degree?
The first issue— whether or
not Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center researchers, whose work
provides essential support for
research at SSRL, will be forced
into "involuntary servitude" if a
project of which they do not ap
prove is carried out at SSRL—is

the focus of discussion.
But the second issue, which is
always threatening to break out
in to the open, generates much
greater emotions, and it is the
faculty's unwillingness thus far
toaddress it openly that has frus
trated debate.
Electrical Engineering Prof.
James Meindl, chairman of the
University's Committee on Re
search (C-Res), reported at the
June 9 senate meeting that C-Res
had been unable to define
"weapons-related research"
and had "concluded that virtu
ally all research done at Stanford
could conceivably have some
military application."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
replied that while his own re
search into Shakespeare's his
tory plays could conceivably
have a military application, he
felt it must be possible to place
research projects on a "spec
trum" according to their degree

of weapons-relatedness. He
called the committee's assertion
"ridiculous" and an attempt to
evade the issues.
History Prof. Paul Robinson
agreed, saying that while the dis
tinction between weapons
related and non-weapons
related research is not easy to
draw, "this report hasn't even
addressed the problem of draw
ing the distinction."
The C-Res report reflected a
reluctance, held by many faculty
members, to judge research
projects according to their ap
plications as long as the projects
contribute to basic knowledge
and conform to existing Univer
sity research policies. Other
professors are frustrated with
this reluctance. But to resolve
this difference, the problem that
faced C-Res must be solved:
How do you decide whether a
project is "weapons-related"?
Several methods have been

proposed. Most faculty mem
bers seem to agree that the
levels of funding received from
certain government agencies—
the Department of Defense
(DOD) and the Deprtment of
Energy (DOE) —are significant
indicators of the level of
weapons-related research being
done. This raises separate issues
of departmental reliance on
single government agencies and
the effect of this on graduate
students, but it doesn't help in
deciding whether individual
projects are weapons-related.
A more promising method,
and one which will probably be
taken up by the senate this fall, is
judging by the declared intent of
the research sponsor. Opinions
of this "end-use" criterion vary;
on the one hand, SLAC Prof.
Robert Mozley said SLAC re
searchers "know when they are
doing weapons research"; on
the other, Sociology Prof. Sandy
Dornbusch called this criterion "
a very weak one" because a lot
of basic research gets done in
the name of military applica
tions.
No matter how weapons
related research is defined,
however—and no one would
deny that some research proj
ects are more weapons-related
than others—the underlying
issue remains whether the Uni
versity should regulate it. This
will remain the issue regardless
of how the current SLAC/SSRL
controversy is settled, and could
lead this fall to proposals for
change in University research
policies.
So far, no one in the senate
has interrupted the discussion
of how to judge weapons
relatedness to say that he is op
posed to weapons research in
principle. But there are indica
tions.
Rebholz went so far as to say,
"Some of us detest weapons
related research, but that's not
the issue—we just want more in
formation." To which Radiology
Prof. William Northway was
probably replying when he
claimed, "There are groups try
ing to change University re
search policy. More study won't
give us more information."
In March the Faculty Senate
asked a University committee to
"study the volume and character
of weapons-related research at
Stanford.''
On June 9 the senate, after a
sometimes heated discussion,
"receive(d) with thanks" the
committee's report and put off
action on the issue until this fall,
when the same committee will
probably be asked more or less
the same question.

News Analysis

This episode—part of the
furor surrounding a controver
sial research proposal at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL) —epitomized
the currently tentative nature of
the debate over weapons re
search on campus, a debate
likely to grow louder, wider and
more acrimonious in the future.
