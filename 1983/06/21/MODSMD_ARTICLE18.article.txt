## Screwball farce or screwed-up filmmaking? 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Superman III

Richard Lester has conceived
the opening titles sequence of
Superman 111 as a slapstick bal
let: on the streets ot Metropolis
(the name assigned to New York
City in the Superman mythol
ogy), all the commonplace
perils—fuses placed to ward off
pedestrians at the mouths of
manholes, lightweight plastic
phone booths, walking wind-up
toys peddled by curbside ven
dors, the mating instincts of pet
dogs—run amok and converge,
and the result is somewhere be
tween the climax of a Preston
Sturges comedy and the vir
tuoso dance-brawl number in
1941. This scene, though some
what uneven and a little ex
tended, is also ihventive and ex
tremely funny; as the credits cut
across the center of the screen,
colliding with these frazzled,
comically victimized city dwel

lers, it seems as it Metropolis
were caught in a cockeyed vise.
What Lester offers us here is a
way of reading the rest of the
film. Superman 111 is a huge Rube
Goldberg contraption, in which
the narrative, rather than con
sisting of strands neatly woven
together, is cut into blocks that
crash into one another, some
times flipping or leapfrogging
over each other and constantly
rearranging the overall pattern.
While you are watching it, you
wonder how the filmmakers—
Lester and the screenwriters,
David and Leslie Newman —
thought it out, and your first im
pulse when you run it through in
you head afterwards is to comp
lain that all the loose ends ha
ven't been tied up. But actually,
you are told all you need to
know about every incident, and
then the movie slams you
aboard a new one; the New
mans don't bother to provide
bridges or rhyme the subplots
because they are trying for an

out-of-control tall tale effect.
There are so many surprises in
the picture that there are bound
to be disappointments, too, as
characters and chunks of plot
reverse themselves and the bits
you grew fond of in the first half

stalwartly refuse to recur in the
second. Many people are sure to
hate it, because of its unpredic
tability and unconventional
shape, and it really does feel like
the work of people who are try
ing to work something out of
their systems: the imagery is so
enormous and explosive—
practically apocalyptic—that you
don't see how there could pos
sibly be a Superman IV. But if
you learn to relax (or better, to
abandon) your expectations as
the movie bursts and rumbles
along, it can be a wildly enter
taining experience.
Most movies, especially funny
movies, play it safe; there's a
widely held belief that comedies
are supposed to be modest, so
when a gifted director searches
for a new visual style for a
comedy—as Steven Spielberg
did in 1941, and Robert Zemec
kis in Used Cars—he's invariably
shot down, accused of self
indulgence or simply ignored.
Lester and his photographer,
Robert Paynter, decided that a

cosmic parody like Superman III
needed an overscaled look, and
so most of the picture, which is
in Panavision and Dolby Stereo,
is shot extremely close up, so
that it begins to distort (like pho
tographic realism). Predictably,
there are some unfortunate con
sequences to two hours of this
visual overkill—you come out
feeling exhausted, and it takes a
while to readjust to the much
tinier world outside the
theater—but along the way Les
ter and Paynter achieve some
startling compositions. One
