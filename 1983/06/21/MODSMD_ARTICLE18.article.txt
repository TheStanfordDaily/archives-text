## Screwball farce or screwed-up filmmaking? 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Superman III

Richard Lester has conceived
the opening titles sequence of
Superman 111 as a slapstick bal
let: on the streets ot Metropolis
(the name assigned to New York
City in the Superman mythol
ogy), all the commonplace
perils—fuses placed to ward off
pedestrians at the mouths of
manholes, lightweight plastic
phone booths, walking wind-up
toys peddled by curbside ven
dors, the mating instincts of pet
dogs—run amok and converge,
and the result is somewhere be
tween the climax of a Preston
Sturges comedy and the vir
tuoso dance-brawl number in
1941. This scene, though some
what uneven and a little ex
tended, is also ihventive and ex
tremely funny; as the credits cut
across the center of the screen,
colliding with these frazzled,
comically victimized city dwel

lers, it seems as it Metropolis
were caught in a cockeyed vise.
What Lester offers us here is a
way of reading the rest of the
film. Superman 111 is a huge Rube
Goldberg contraption, in which
the narrative, rather than con
sisting of strands neatly woven
together, is cut into blocks that
crash into one another, some
times flipping or leapfrogging
over each other and constantly
rearranging the overall pattern.
While you are watching it, you
wonder how the filmmakers—
Lester and the screenwriters,
David and Leslie Newman —
thought it out, and your first im
pulse when you run it through in
you head afterwards is to comp
lain that all the loose ends ha
ven't been tied up. But actually,
you are told all you need to
know about every incident, and
then the movie slams you
aboard a new one; the New
mans don't bother to provide
bridges or rhyme the subplots
because they are trying for an

out-of-control tall tale effect.
There are so many surprises in
the picture that there are bound
to be disappointments, too, as
characters and chunks of plot
reverse themselves and the bits
you grew fond of in the first half

stalwartly refuse to recur in the
second. Many people are sure to
hate it, because of its unpredic
tability and unconventional
shape, and it really does feel like
the work of people who are try
ing to work something out of
their systems: the imagery is so
enormous and explosive—
practically apocalyptic—that you
don't see how there could pos
sibly be a Superman IV. But if
you learn to relax (or better, to
abandon) your expectations as
the movie bursts and rumbles
along, it can be a wildly enter
taining experience.
Most movies, especially funny
movies, play it safe; there's a
widely held belief that comedies
are supposed to be modest, so
when a gifted director searches
for a new visual style for a
comedy—as Steven Spielberg
did in 1941, and Robert Zemec
kis in Used Cars—he's invariably
shot down, accused of self
indulgence or simply ignored.
Lester and his photographer,
Robert Paynter, decided that a

cosmic parody like Superman III
needed an overscaled look, and
so most of the picture, which is
in Panavision and Dolby Stereo,
is shot extremely close up, so
that it begins to distort (like pho
tographic realism). Predictably,
there are some unfortunate con
sequences to two hours of this
visual overkill—you come out
feeling exhausted, and it takes a
while to readjust to the much
tinier world outside the
theater—but along the way Les
ter and Paynter achieve some
startling compositions. One

Reeve) flying through the sky

with the frozen surface of an en
tire lake held at arm's length
hints at the comic book potential
of the wide screen process, and
other scenes, like one in which
Superman rescues a little boy
from combines advancing on
him in a Smallville wheat field,
have an unusual beauty, by vir
tue of their clarity and their huge
expanse. The best images
suggest serenely uncluttered
murals. In the 60s, when Lester
was making his first pictures, his
fast-editing arty-jumble style
often killed the ideas in the
script (A Funny Thing Happened
on the Way to the Forum fur
nishes the best example), but
here his style not only suits the
material, it completes it, even
defines it.

The Newmans' witty
screenplay is built on a terrific
jokey premise—that life in
America is so nutty and chaotic,
and Americans are so blase and
inured to the lunacy, that disas
ters don't surprise them and
even Superman's last-minute
rescues are taken for granted.
When Superman lands behind a
firefighter at a monumental in
dustrial conflagration and asks
what he can do, the fireman, un
aware of who is speaking, tells
him to get some help to lift a
piece of equipment; glancing
over his shoulder, he sees
Superman and without taking
time for a double take, says,
"Oh, it's you. Forget the help."
Set ingeniously upon this prem
ise are a series of reversals, so
that while the citizens up on
screen remain relatively unruf
fled, we receive one jolt after
another. The villain, multi
millionaire Ross Webster

(Robert Vaughn, in perhaps his
first memorable performance),
blackmails one of his employ
ees, a computer wizard named
Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) he
caught stealing from the com
pany, to mastermind a scheme
for garnering the world
monopoly on coffee by electron
ically inducing torrential rains to
destroy the Colombian crop.
When Superman interferes, Gus
creates a synthetic version of
kryptonite that Webster hopes
will kill Superman. But instead of
physically injuring our hero, it
cripples him morally, turning
him perverse and mean. He
straightens the Leaning Tower of
Pisa, blows out the Olympic
torch, and in hilarious (and
scary) parodies of melodramatic
cliches, gets drunk and destruc
tive at a bar and beds down with
Webster's mistress, Lorelei Am
brosia (Pamela Stephenson).
The other significant reversal
in the movie is Clark Kent's ro
mance with Lana Lang (Annette
O'Toole), whom he sees, after
many years, at his high school

reunion. Whereas Lois Lane
(Margot Kidder appears in a
cameo) worshipped Superman
but never appreciated Clark,
Lana finds Clark's gangly, out
of-step vulnerability more en
dearing than Superman's awe
some strength. Reeve's bigger
than-life ail-American good
looks and O'Toole's small-town,
unaffected radiance — she's a
knockout, the kind of rural
maiden who wins beauty con
tests — are an inspired match.
(In her first, and best, movie
role, in the 1975 Smile, O'Toole
did enter a small-town beauty
contest.) Reeve and O'Toole
have a chemistry he and Margot
Kidder never had, and their
scenes together ground the film
emotionally in the pre
kryptonite section; they also
lend Clark's return to Smallville
heart and humor, which were
notably lacking in the home
town scenes in the first Super
man. One of the liabilities of the
crazy, off-kilter, collision-course
structure of this film is that once
Superman turns nasty, l ana be

comes a minor character and the
movie goes emotionally hay
wire.
Christopher Reeve gets better
with each Superman sequel (and
he was the one saving grace of
the first installment). Vou can
just imagine the filmmakers'
thrill when they saw how much
he brought to the role; he meets
each of the new challenges
they've rigged for him — some
of them, like Superman's bouts
of lechery and dissolute depres
sion, stultifyingly difficult — and
increases his stature scene by
scene. Whereas the movie
keeps shifting, Reeve doesn't —
he just adds dimensions to his
performance, so that somehow
we believe that all these new
wrinkles belong on the same
Man of Steel. That requires not
only crack timing and an as
tonishing balancing act (how
does Reeve manage to seem like
a cartoon creation and a human
being at the same time?) but also
a kind of comic inclusiveness —
an aptitude for comprehending
the whole scheme of the movie
in his performance — that
Richard Pryor, on his end, fails to
achieve. Pryor is tremendously
funny, and in his early scenes he
overlays a terrified caught-out
did-l-screw-up-again expression
on Gus Gorman's gleeful, little
kid mischievousness, and the
result is comic perfection. But
though Pryor shows more sides
than he has in any of his other
non-concert movies, they ap
pear alternately; he hasn't
worked out a way to make total
sense of Gus. However, a pic
ture constructed as peculiarly as
this one presents formidable act

ing problems, so perhaps we
shouldn't castigate Pryor too
harshly just because he can't
match up to the overwhelmingly
successful work of his opposite
number. In fact, most of our dis
satisfaction with Pryor's per
formance is an after-effect of the
film; while it is going on, he
gives us nothing but pleasure.
Inevitably, Lester and the
Newmans work reversals on a
number of old movies. Lorelei
Ambrosia, the dumb blonde
who reads Kant when she's
alone, revamps Judy Holliday's
Billie Dawn in Born Yesterday,
and Webster's sister Vera (Annie
Ross) is costumed to look like
Rosa Klebb, the lesbian villai
ness of From Russia with Love.
(Neither of these variations
works particularly well.) Those

with very sharp TV memories
will recognize the nod to an I
Love Lucy segment in which
George Reeves, video's Super
man, made a guest appearance,
and the Frankenstein pictures
are evoked in the most elaborate
(and least satisfying) sequence.
Lester does a twist on the grapef
ruit scene from Public Enemy,
too, and in a very strange, am
bitious episode that recalls Gene
Kelly's great, sinister "Alter Ego"
number in the 1944 Cover Girl,
the good and evil parts of
Superman battle for supremacy.
Vou can see that the filmmakers
were committed to moving this
last Superman in as many direc
tions as they could, without re
peating anything that the previ
ous Superman movies had al
ready done. Though at moments

you may feel that they've gone
mad, this kind of risk taking is
admirable even when it falls flat,
and you have to admit that the
picture has visual and structural
integrity. And if you respond to
it fully, you may suspect, as I do,
that it's a screwball classic.
'Man With Two Brains'
The latest Carl Reiner-Steve
Martin collaboration, The Man
with Two Brains, is so paralyz
ingly funny that one doesn't
have time to worry about the
running gags that never click or
the visual punch lines that Re
iner doesn't have the requisite
skills to carry off (even with
Michael Chapman serving as his

photographer). The script by Re
iner, Martin and George Gipe —
a mishmash of ideas from Re
becca, Magnificent Obsession
and Blithe Spirit — casts Martin
as a brain surgeon who ends his
period of mourning over the
death of his first wife by marry
ing one of his patients (Kathleen
Turner), whose life he saved
after his car hit her. When she
turns out to be a maddening
tease, he deceives her with a
brain in the laboratory of the
unhinged scientist Dr. Necessi
ter (David Warner). The movie is
full of absurdities to cherish -
particularly Martin's recitation
of a poem called "Pointy Birds"
and a scene in which a whore
with an unbearable, high
pitched voice sings "Duke of
Earl."
