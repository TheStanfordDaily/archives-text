Court rules on pregnancy benefits
Washington — The Supreme Court, in a decision that could
cost businesses billions of dollars, ruled yesterday that male
workers are cheated if their family medical plans don't match
up to those available to women employees.
As a practical effect, the 7-2 ruling likely will move some
employers to extend the same pregnancy benefits to em
ployees' wives as it does to the women directly on their pay
rolls.
But the court left open the possibility that employers could
still limit the benefits for employees' wives if, at the same
time, they imposed the same overall value limits on the cov
erage extended women employees and their husbands.
The court said that under the 1978 federal Pregnancy Dis
crimination Act it is illegal for a company medical plan to
give "married male employees a benefit package for their
dependents that is less inclusive than the dependency cov
erage provided to married female employees."
In other matters, the court:
—Agreed to decide whether private citizens can file law
suits prodding the federal government into denying or re
scinding tax breaks for racially discriminatory schools. The
court said it will use cases from Memphis, Tenn., and
elsewherg to follow up its decision last month that the In
ternal Revenue Service may withhold tax exemptions for
private schools that practice discrimination.
—Refused to reinstate a $14 million libel award against
Penthouse magazine for a satirical article that described the
sexual exploits of a mythical Miss Wyoming beauty queen.
The court left intact a ruling that said since the article was
"complete fantasy" a real-life former Miss Wyoming was not
defamed.
Congressional budget unacceptable
Washington — House-Senate budget conferees tentatively
agreed yesterday on the main elements of a tax and spending
blueprint for next fiscal year that the White House already
has labeled unacceptable in all its major parts.
But they were still struggling to iron out a few crucial de
tails late yesterday and conference leaders, faced with a mid
night deadline for sending a compromise back to the House
and Senate, warned that disagreemem over any one of the
last items could unravel the whole deal.

"I think we all know where we want to end up," said
House Budget Committee Chairman James Jones (D-Okla.),
but "there's always the risk it might fall apart."
Jones' assessment came after a weekend of behind-the
scenes talks among the principal negotiators and a brief pub
lic session to begin sorting out the remaining issues, which
had been largely whittled down to Medicare and food
stamps.
NRC members violated rules
Washington — Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff mem
bers violated agency rules by giving draft safety inspection
reports to utility companies, commission chairman Nunzio
Palladino told a congressional subcommittee yesterday, but
he defended their intentions.
"If we don't tell people what is wrong with their building
or operation, we would not be doing our job," he testified.
However, Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the
oversight subcommittee of the House Interior Committee,
said it was disturbing that the NRC had never disciplined
those who distributed the reports to utility companies.
NRC policy prohibits dissemination ofdraft reports to per
sons outside the agency, but the policy has been violated fre
quently, as the Los Angeles Times reported yesterday.
Although an official NRC order against such disclosures
had been in effect since July 1982, James Cummings, head of
the NRC's internal investigative staff, said NRC policy "is
confused" and that it was hard to discipline someone for
leaking reports "when we don't know what the rules are."
Cummings admitted that a review sent to Markey dealing
with incidents of leaked reports had been "less than forth
right" and promised to supply a more complete survey.
The draft reports are prepared by field inspectors who visit
nuclear power plants in search of potential health and safety
problems. They are used by the NRC in determining whether
rules have been violated and whether utilities should be
punished with fines or other penalties.
If utility companies are given inspectors' draft reports
before the NRC decides on enforcement action, the com
panies "can put the fire out," Markey said. "There is no black
eye and no public controversy."
