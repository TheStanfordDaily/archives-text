# Students protest Shultz's foreign policy positions
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
A well-organized coalition of
student groups conducted a de
termined but peaceful protest at
commencement June 12 to ex
press it opposition to the Rea
gan administration's foreign
policies.
Calling commencement
speaker Secretary of State
George Shultz "a principal ar
chitect of Reagan's interven
tionist policies in Central
America and a strong voice be
hind the administration's escala
tion of the arms race," the pro
test coalition urged Shultz to
re-direct U.S. foreign and
human rights policies.
Despite all of the protesters'
efforts, however, Shultz did not

mention U.S. policy in Central
America — a major issue of the
protest — in his prepared
speech.
Representatives from several
campus progressive groups —
including the Stanford Central
American Action Network
(SCAAN) and the Committee on
Justice in the Middle East —
spent weeks planning the pro
test that included a press con
ference, a memorial service for
the victims of human rights
abuses, petitions, banners,
helium balloons, armbands and
sashes.
Nine hundred graduates and
faculty members wore orange
sashes adorned with the slogan
"Respect Human Rights" into

Frost Amphitheater, where the
ceremonies were held.
According to protest litera
ture, the sashes signified that
"enlightened pursuit of Ameri
can national interests is compat
ible with open and whole
hearted support for the human
rights of political and academic
freedom, self-determination
and social justice."
At the press conference be
fore the commencement cere
monies, History Prof. Paul Sea
ver presented a petition signed
by more than 80 faculty and staff
members expressing opposition
to "the Reagan administration's
apparent disregard for human
rights in its foreign policies."
The petition, similar to one

signed by more than 1900 stu
dents, urged Shultz to work to
ward peaceful political solutions
in Central America, engage in
serious arms control negotia
tions with the Soviet Union, end
tacit U.S. support for apartheid
in South Africa and seek a solu
tion to the Palestinian problem.
Graduating senior Andrew
Bennett presented both peti
tions to one of Shultz's aides
shortly before commencement
began.
The various groups involved
in the protest had wide-ranging
grievances against the Reagan
administration's foreign policy.
John Rosenblum, representa
tive of the Committee on Justice
in the Middle East, said U.S.
foreign policy "ignores the
Palestinian people and their rep
resentatives."
"The plight of the Palestinians
and their right to self
determination must be resolved
for any semblance of peace to
exist in the Middle East,"
Rosenblum said.
Emil Martinec, representative
of the Stanford Disarmament
Lobby, called for a nuclear
weapons freeze "in the spirit of
the one proposed by the House
and endorsed by the Catholic
bishops."
Bennett, who represented
SCAAN, criticized the adminis
tration's "ineffective" Central
American policies.
"Instead of opening up politi
cal dialogues aimed at peaceful
resolutions of the problems of
Central America,"he said, "the
Reagan administration has at

tempted to solve political prob
lems by military means."
Before the commencement
ceremonies, the coalition con
ducted a memorial service for
the victims of human rights vio
lations. Among the speakers
were Robert Hamerton-Kelly,
dean of the Stanford Chapel,
and theologian Robert McAfee
Brown.
Brown deplored the slaughter
of Salvadoran citizens by right
wing death squads, saying that
government forces in El Salvador
have murdered over 42,000 of
their own citizens.
"You would think that our
government would be in the
forefront of protesting such
policies . . . You would think
that our government would be
welcoming refugees from such
indiscriminate slaughter," he
said, "but you would be wrong."
In addition to sorrow for the
victims and sorrow for the U.S.
government's role in their vic
timization, American citizens
must also feel sorrow for them
selves, Brown said, because
Americans share the blame.
"It would be too easy to say
that the blood of the human
rights violations stains only the
hands of the president or the
secretary of state," he said. "No,
it stains our hands as well."
Shultz's speech was not dis
rupted by the protesters. But
banners expressing opposition
to Reagan's Central American
policies were displayed both at
the edge of the amphitheater
and above the graduates, carried
aloft by helium balloons.
