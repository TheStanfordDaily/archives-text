# Pope continues balancing act
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
CZESTOCHOWA, Polandâ€”A
government protest Sunday
about the politicization of his
trip is bound to increase ten
sions during what was already
shaping up as the most critical
phase of Pope John Paul ll's re
turn pilgrimage to Poland.
The pope has surprised many
here by the directness with
which he has from the first con
fronted the divisive issues crip
pling his homeland. At the same
time, he has avoided any action
that might back Poland's Com
munist government into a
corner where it might feel ob
liged to somehow retaliate.
Even Sunday's government
protest that the church was fail
ing to live up to its agreement to
curb political demonstrations
during or after events on the
pope's agenda was just a warn
ing. But its timing nonetheless
underlines the sensitivity of the
second half of the papal trip.
The pope this week visits
former Solidarity strongholds in
the industrial centers of Poznan,
Katowice, Wroclaw, and Nowa
Huta, a suburb of Krakow. And
the question is whether the pon
tiff will be able to continue the
difficult balancing act which al
most everyone here agrees he
has accomplished so skillfully so
far.
"The pope is the only author
ity in the country," commented

a Communist media official
matter-of-factly.
John Paul has been an artist
during the first half of his return
papal visit to Poland. A born ac
tor, the pontiff's enormous
charisma and ability to move a
crowd has turned what are actu
ally very moderate remarks into
ringing endorsements of human
rights.
He has returned frequently,
and with increasing directness,
to the themes of human rights,
Polish sovereignty, the need for
dialogue and reform.
He has done so by masterfully
mixing religious and historical
metaphor with straightforward
political messages.
Contrary to the widespread
opinion before his arrival that he
could only bring a message of
consolation to his countrymen,
he has instead talked repeatedly
of victory.
"The kingdom of God surpas
ses the earthly dimension of
things," he told 1 million faithful
in Warsaw Friday. But Christ is
not a figure for the hereafter, the
pope noted, he is "yesterday
and today, and here he meets
the men and women of every
generation, here he meets the
nation. .
The talk after the first four
days of his pilgrimage is not
about whether the pope has
pressed the regime far enough
but whether he has gone too far.
