## Poles give pontiff rapturous welcome 
### Los Angeles Times 
CZESTOCHOWA, Poland-
Pope John Paul ll's visit to his
troubled homeland has demon
strated the Polish people's de
termination to regain reforms
their government has suppres
sed.
This was evident in some of
the banners displayed at the
Masses and other gatherings the
pope has attended so far and in
the chants of some of the mil
lions who have come to see and
hear him.
Many of the banners and
other placards bore the name of
the Solidarity independent trade
union, which has been outlawed
with a ban placed on the public
display of the name. Security
forces, however, have made no
attempt to confiscate or to
otherwise suppress the display
of the banners bearing the
union's name.
One of the boldest banners
was displayed at a meeting the
pope held with a huge crowd of
young people here Saturday. It
bore both the name of Solidarity
and that of the late Soviet Presi
dent Leonid I Brezhnev in a two
line Polish rhyme that said:
"Brezniew Gnije Solidarnosc
Zyje"—Brezhnev is dead. Sol
idarity lives.
The security forces and espe
cially the hated anti-riot police
known by the acronym ZOMO,
who have been active in combat
ting pro-Solidarity demonstra
tions, havecomeinforashareof
both Polish humor and anger.
A group of demonstrators
leaving the Warsaw stadium
where the pope celebrated his
first open air Mass after arriving
in Poland, chanted "Come with

us. . .they are not beating us to
day."
Another anti-ZOMO chant
was, "The pope is with us. . .the
priests are with us. . .the army
back to the barracks. . .ZOMOs
to work."
A banner with the signature
"Internees" declared "Wel
come Holy Father. We love you
and are grateful to you."
Another banner said "Best
wishes from prisons and the un
derground." It was signed "Sol
idarity." Still another said "Bless
those who suffer persecution for
justice and who work for jus
tice." It too was signed "Solidar
ity."
In reference to the govern
ment's claim that opposition to
its policies comes only from a
relatively small group of anti
state extremists, another slogan
declared, "Independence, this
is what we want in Poland. We
are Poles not extremists."
Many of the banners support
ing solidarity were carried by
groups from the Baltic port of
Bdansk, birthplace of the Sol
idarity movement and home of
its leader, Lech Walesa. At some
demonstrations the people
chanted Walesa's name and
shouted, "No democracy with
out Solidarity."
Other banned organizations
have also made their presence
felt during papal events. At
Niepokalanow, site of a monas
tary the pope visited Saturday,
which lies in the agricultural area
south of Warsaw, there were
banners for rural Solidarity, the
now-outlawed farmer's coun
terpart of the banned labor
movement.
