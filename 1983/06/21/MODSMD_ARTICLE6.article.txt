## Responsibility for weapons begins here 
### 
(An open letter to University President Donald Kennedy.)

! am writing to mv
concern about the poss b ' '
weapons research at SSI
have said that end-use i ic
tions which may seem benign
now could prove oppressive in
the future. You must see that
this is a special case. First, be
cause the humanistic ethics you
speak from signify nothing if
they do not serve humanity, that
being their raison d'etre. Sec
ond, because ethics assume that
we have a future. Nuclear war
would put an end to conse
quences. Never in history have
weapons been stock-piled on a
large scale without being used.
To allow weapons research at
Stanford is clearly to participate

n building the bombs.
Please re-examine your con
science and truly represent the
'ommunity that you head.
Fund-raising, as I see it, com
prises only part of your job,
which is representation. In this
case the money comes at too
high a risk. I don't know how to
stop nuclear war from happen
ing, but I am sure that no neutral
move is available to you. You can
either add to the danger of an
nihilation, or you can join those
of us who believe that the least
we must do is not allow it to
begin in our own backyard.
