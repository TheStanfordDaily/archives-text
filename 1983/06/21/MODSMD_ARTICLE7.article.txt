## Hoover question disregards social justice 
### 
The debate about the role of Hoover at Stanford is the
latest example of the difficulty we have dealing with
ethical issues. Earlier examples were the service em
ployee strike and questions of weapons research at
SSRL. In each case the moral issue has been reduced to
some ethical principle such as sound management,
academic freedom or the researcher's right to follow
conscience. These are not empty concepts, but they
tend to keep us from considering issues of justice and
public safety.
The Hoover Institution has been charged with parti
sanship and ideological personnel practices. It has been
defended on the basis of its financial independence, the
presence of both Democrats and Republicans on its staff
and the history of its relationship with Stanford. These
defenses are not only disquieting in some cases, they
aUq have nothing to do with the issues of \ustice and
public safety.
Except in the most narrow and prejudiced sense, par
tisanship is not a problem for which we should indict
Hoover. The one remaining area of concern is money,
and it is close to the heart of the issue. But what the
university cares about has little to do with the ethical
issue in money. The university wants to know how many
of its donors are giving to Hoover in the belief that it is
the same as Stanford. How much lessare we gettingthan
we would without Hoover? That is the question.
Before looking at the question as it ought to be, let's
look at how academic freedom fits into the question of
money by asking why anyone other than faculty and
those aspiring to be faculty should care about it. There is
a clear connection between the freedom of the scholar,
the sanctity of the academy, and the preservation of

political freedom leading to political and social justice.
The vision of free scholars serving a free people
changes when it is unaccountable research in the service
of those who can pay for it. Private or public, it is disin
genuous to pretend that there is not an economic elite
whose class interests pervert laws, the enforcement of
laws and the truth. Reaganomics, Sewergate, the
"covert" war in Nicaragua and James Watt are not subtle
indications of what one can get away with if one is on the
side of money.
The essential contradiction in the liberal commitment
to freedom is symbolized in the use, as it is at Hoover, of
academic freedom to defend apartheid in South Africa
and "counterinsurgency" against the oppressed peas
ants of Central America and Southwest Africa. Here the
issue is not merely partisanship, but whose partisans
one can be and tell the truth.
We all think, speak and act from some perspective.
None of us are unbiased, though some are better at
listening to and integrating the experiences of others.
Some know where to look for the right information and
how to test it for reliability. For that same reason, many
of us reject the ideological nonsense in defense of the
indefensible that comes far too regularly from Hoover.
Intellectual intergrity demands that we recognize that
ideas which serve the established order are always more
suspect than those which would change it. There are
two reasons for this: One, the wealthyand powerful have
control of public information, can publish and distri
bute, and can use their information to win elections and
sway votes. The poor do not have these means. Second,
the researcher's self-interest is easily served by the

promise of rewards, position, and influence in the halls
of power. There may be glory, but no gold, for those
who speak prophetically about injustice and the perver
sion of the truth.
The Hoover Institution has a large component of schol
ars from Eastern Europe who have had terrible times
with the Russians. I would not argue that their experi
ences were not terrible, but I think it has been difficult if
not impossible for them to see the world from other that
an anti-Russian and anti-communist perspective. Those
who have feared a public discussion of Marx, socialism
and the issues of social justice at home and in the world
have used this anti-communist bias to support their
interests. Since they have the ability to pay well and offer
other rewards, this perspective on the world has gained
an unwarranted prominence.
Like the critical research equipment needed for ad
vanced weapons research, it is no accident that Hoover
is at Stanford. We have an uncanny ability to find money
to support research. I have never in my years as a stu
dent, as an alumnus and more recently on the staff heard
a serious discussion of what Stanford ought to be other
than "successful." I think we ought to be a community
where truth is honored and where the relationship be
tween truth, justice and freedom helps us all become
more responsible citizens and lovers of justice. I would
love to see Hoover gone, but only after we deserved it.
Until then we should single out Hoover to remind us
what is wrong with academic freedom without academic
responsibility.

The debate about the role of Hoover at Stanford is the
latest example of the difficulty we have dealing with
ethical issues. Earlier examples were the service em
ployee strike and questions of weapons research at
SSRL. In each case the moral issue has been reduced to
some ethical principle such as sound management,
academic freedom or the researcher's right to follow
conscience. These are not empty concepts, but they
tend to keep us from considering issues of justice and
public safety.
The Hoover Institution has been charged with parti
sanship and ideological personnel practices. It has been
defended on the basis of its financial independence, the
presence of both Democrats and Republicans on its staff
and the history of its relationship with Stanford. These
defenses are not only disquieting in some cases, they
aUq have nothing to do with the issues of \ustice and
public safety.
Except in the most narrow and prejudiced sense, par
tisanship is not a problem for which we should indict
Hoover. The one remaining area of concern is money,
and it is close to the heart of the issue. But what the
university cares about has little to do with the ethical
issue in money. The university wants to know how many
of its donors are giving to Hoover in the belief that it is
the same as Stanford. How much lessare we gettingthan
we would without Hoover? That is the question.
Before looking at the question as it ought to be, let's
look at how academic freedom fits into the question of
money by asking why anyone other than faculty and
those aspiring to be faculty should care about it. There is
a clear connection between the freedom of the scholar,
the sanctity of the academy, and the preservation of

political freedom leading to political and social justice.
The vision of free scholars serving a free people
changes when it is unaccountable research in the service
of those who can pay for it. Private or public, it is disin
genuous to pretend that there is not an economic elite
whose class interests pervert laws, the enforcement of
laws and the truth. Reaganomics, Sewergate, the
"covert" war in Nicaragua and James Watt are not subtle
indications of what one can get away with if one is on the
side of money.
The essential contradiction in the liberal commitment
to freedom is symbolized in the use, as it is at Hoover, of
academic freedom to defend apartheid in South Africa
and "counterinsurgency" against the oppressed peas
ants of Central America and Southwest Africa. Here the
issue is not merely partisanship, but whose partisans
one can be and tell the truth.
We all think, speak and act from some perspective.
None of us are unbiased, though some are better at
listening to and integrating the experiences of others.
Some know where to look for the right information and
how to test it for reliability. For that same reason, many
of us reject the ideological nonsense in defense of the
indefensible that comes far too regularly from Hoover.
Intellectual intergrity demands that we recognize that
ideas which serve the established order are always more
suspect than those which would change it. There are
two reasons for this: One, the wealthyand powerful have
control of public information, can publish and distri
bute, and can use their information to win elections and
sway votes. The poor do not have these means. Second,
the researcher's self-interest is easily served by the

promise of rewards, position, and influence in the halls
of power. There may be glory, but no gold, for those
who speak prophetically about injustice and the perver
sion of the truth.
The Hoover Institution has a large component of schol
ars from Eastern Europe who have had terrible times
with the Russians. I would not argue that their experi
ences were not terrible, but I think it has been difficult if
not impossible for them to see the world from other that
an anti-Russian and anti-communist perspective. Those
who have feared a public discussion of Marx, socialism
and the issues of social justice at home and in the world
have used this anti-communist bias to support their
interests. Since they have the ability to pay well and offer
other rewards, this perspective on the world has gained
an unwarranted prominence.
Like the critical research equipment needed for ad
vanced weapons research, it is no accident that Hoover
is at Stanford. We have an uncanny ability to find money
to support research. I have never in my years as a stu
dent, as an alumnus and more recently on the staff heard
a serious discussion of what Stanford ought to be other
than "successful." I think we ought to be a community
where truth is honored and where the relationship be
tween truth, justice and freedom helps us all become
more responsible citizens and lovers of justice. I would
love to see Hoover gone, but only after we deserved it.
Until then we should single out Hoover to remind us
what is wrong with academic freedom without academic
responsibility.
