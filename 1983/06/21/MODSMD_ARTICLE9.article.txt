## Stanford grad Sally Ride blasts off on shuttle trip 
### JANE BAILIE 
Stanford alumnae and
flight engineer Sally Ride
blasted off with the space
shuttle Challenger at 4:30
a.m. PST on June 18, becom
ing the first American woman
to travel into space.
Ride, who holds four de
grees from Stanford, will
spend an estimated six days
orbiting the planet. She will
share the responsibilities of
operating the Remote Man
ipulator System (the "arm"),
placing and retrieving satel
lites, controlling unmanned
spacecraft and monitoring
on-board experiments.
Ride's friend University
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon was at the shuttle
launch site. Hargadon had
recently flown to Florida to
present Ride with a scroll en
titled "From the foothills to
Outfer Space, Stanford is with
you, Sally Ride" signed by a
number of Stanford friends
and well-wishers.
Two Stanford banners were
also taken by Hargadon, one
of which was actually on
board when the Challenger
lifted off.
Hargadon was the dean of
admissions at Swarthmore
College when Ride entered
there as a freshman. Soon af
terwards he became dean of
admissions at Stanford, ad
mitting Ride as a transfer stu
dent in 1970. She went on to
receive two bachelor's de
grees in English and physics.
In 1975, Ride returned to
Stanford to earn both mas
ter's and doctoral degrees in
astrophysics.
Ride applied for admission
to the space program after
reading a 1977 NASA ad in
The Daily. Out of more than
8000 applicants (more than
1000 of them were women),
Ride and five other women

were among the 35 applicants
chosen to enter the 1978
NASA astronaut class.
According to reports from
the Challenger, all operations
on board the shuttle are
going smoothly. Ride seems
to be having little problem ad
justing to life in space. When
Mission Control asked how
she felt after her first hour on
board, she responded, "It
sure is fun."
The focus of this voyage,
more so than on any other of
the previous space expedi
tions, is to turn the shuttle
into an orbiting laboratory.
The Challenger is carrying
two communication satel
lites, one Canadian and one
Indonesian, which will be
deployed first.
Having thus lightened the
cargo of the ship, the crew
will turn its attention to 21
"getaway specials," experi
ments programmed to oper
ate almost automatically.
Sponsor companies of the
specials paid $3000 to $10,000
in "rent" for the payload
space.
At 32 Ride is the youngest
active astronaut. Some have
charged that Ride's selection

was symbolic, as was appar
ently the case with her Soviet
counterpart Valentina
Tereshkova, who was the first
woman in space. (Due to in
sufficient training and prepa
ration, Tereshkova was re
portedly sick almost to the
point of hysteria during her
three-day 1963 journey.)
However, NASA spokes
men are quick to dispel such
doubts, emphasizing the fact
that Sally was chosen for her
merits as an astronaut and
specialist with the mechan
ical arm, rather than on the
novelty of her gender. Ride
and fellow crew member
John Fabian helped to design
the mechanical arm and the
pair are considered NASA's
most skilled operators of the
precision mechanism.
The crew for the shuttle
flight was assigned to the
mission in April 1982. Since
that time, the astronauts have
been spending most of their
time preparing for the flight.
Although Ride is a fully
trained astrophysicist and a
scientist in her own right, she
will not be doing any of her
own experiments while on
board the Challenger. Objec
tives and experiments are de
termined long before the
flight crew is chosen.
When asked at a recent
press conference how she
felt about her role as the first
woman astronaut, Ride re
plied, "I honestly don't have
time to think about it." She
adamantly sees herself one
way and one way only: as an
astronaut.
"I came into this (the space
program) because I wanted to
fly in space. My intention
after the flight is to come back
to the office and get back in
line and try and fly again. I'd
like to do it as many times as
NASA will let me."
