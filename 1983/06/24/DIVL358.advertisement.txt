Welcome to the Stanford
Summer Program! For those
interested in Learning to Fly, we
have an accelerated Solo-Pilot
License course. Most of our club
members obtain a Solo License
with only 9 to 18 hours of flight
time Many pilots completed a
Solo License for less than $482
For those of you who are already
pilots, we offer rapid check-outs
in 12 modem airplanes
(including C-150/152, C-172,
C-172RG, C-182 and T-210
aircraft).
Come flying with us — you've
put it off long enough.
