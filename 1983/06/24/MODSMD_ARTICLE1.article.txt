# Labor relations improving nine months after USW strike
## 
### KRISHNA WEST 
Eight months after the longest strike in Stanford
history, relations between labor and management
have definitely improved, according to United
Stanford Workers President Patrick Smith.
When the University signed a three-year con
tract with service, maintenance and technical per
sonnel i n early October last year, it ended a 30-day
USW strike that had left the University with only
skeleton food service and maintenance opera
tions.
But the USW was disappointed with the settle
ment.
The union had asked for a 10.75 percent wage
increase and a 0.75 percent benefit increase. The
final three-year settlement provided workers with
a 9.5 percent wage increase and a 3 percent step
increase with an additional $5 per month medical

coverage for the first year. Contract terms for the
second and third years were also less than original
USW demands.
The compromise agreement left feelings of
animosity between management and labor, but,
according to Smith, relations between the two
sides are now impioving.
"There have been some problems between
workers and line managers, but everyone seems
more willing to work together now," Smith said.
Calling University labor practices "archaic" and
"feudal," Smith nevertheless acknowledged Stan
ford's "top level managements's positive attempts
to improve workers' conditions."
University management agrees that, although
relations are improving, they remain less than per
fect.


STRIKE OUT: A police officer watches United Stanford Workers (USW) block a delivery truck
during the USW's strike last year. Nine months after strike, relations between management and
labor are strained but improving.
"There was initially some animosity between the
workers and the University, but that has since dis
sipated," said Felix Barthelemy, manager of em
ployment relations.
"The day-to-day working relationship between
the University and union leadership is still some
what strained, but it's better than before and we're
very cooperative on some issues now," Barth
elemy said.
Douglas Dupen, personnel director at the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center, said that relations
between labor and management are fairly normal.
"It appears that all problems have been worked
out well, and the misunderstandings which do

occur are over the interpretations of contracts be
tween employer, supervisor and union. The rela
tions will improve slowly over the years, but have
been slightly better during the past year," Dupen
explained.
There are fewer cases of worker grievances
now, Smith said, and at the same time the Univer
sity now knows that USW will stand up for what it
wants. A committee on union-University concerns
meets biweekly to deal with any difficulties that
may exist.
Barthelemy said that, although the University is
by no means neutral on the subject of unioniza
tion, it recognizes every employee's right to join a
union.
However, Smith claims that the University used
its extensive resources to foil the USW's member
ship campaign at Stanford Hospital last year.
