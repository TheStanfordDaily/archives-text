# Labor relations improving nine months after USW strike
## 
### KRISHNA WEST 
Eight months after the longest strike in Stanford
history, relations between labor and management
have definitely improved, according to United
Stanford Workers President Patrick Smith.
When the University signed a three-year con
tract with service, maintenance and technical per
sonnel i n early October last year, it ended a 30-day
USW strike that had left the University with only
skeleton food service and maintenance opera
tions.
But the USW was disappointed with the settle
ment.
The union had asked for a 10.75 percent wage
increase and a 0.75 percent benefit increase. The
final three-year settlement provided workers with
a 9.5 percent wage increase and a 3 percent step
increase with an additional $5 per month medical

coverage for the first year. Contract terms for the
second and third years were also less than original
USW demands.
The compromise agreement left feelings of
animosity between management and labor, but,
according to Smith, relations between the two
sides are now impioving.
"There have been some problems between
workers and line managers, but everyone seems
more willing to work together now," Smith said.
Calling University labor practices "archaic" and
"feudal," Smith nevertheless acknowledged Stan
ford's "top level managements's positive attempts
to improve workers' conditions."
University management agrees that, although
relations are improving, they remain less than per
fect.
