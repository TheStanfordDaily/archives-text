## Edwin Harwood When is academic freedom responsible? 
### 
In his recent contribution to the Hoover controversy
(Daily, June 21), Dean Caughey argues that academic
freedom should be exercised in a responsible manner.
He suggests that this condition is met when academic
freedom serves "truth" which in turn should serve "so
cial justice". The issue, he states, "is not merely parti
sanship, but whose partisans one can be and tell the
truth."
I take it that what he means is that when you are
partisan on behalf of the right causes (would these be
causes Dean Caughey favors, or the ones I happen to
support?), then you are speaking the"truth." If not, you
are not practicing academic freedom in a responsible
way.
Although "none of us are unbiased", Caughey writes,
some know how to get the right information and test it
for reliability. Next come the predictable verdict:
Hoover scholars produce "idealogical nonsense in the
defense of the indefensible."
I would not normally go to the bother with this essay.
However, the author's position as a religious leader in
the Stanford community creates the hazard that his ar
gument may not be perceived for what it is: namely, a
none too subtle defense of intellectual intolerance.
First, there are items that aren't explained. I'm at a loss
to know what he means when he refers to issues of
"public safety." Public safety was a problem on campus
back in 1971 when extremists engaged in "trashings."
(They were incited by a faculty member who was judged
by his peers to be exercising academic freedom in a very
irresponsible way.) But what has "public safety" got to
do with the current controversy? Conceptual and
semantic confusion grows in rich profusion in this un
tended garden of prose.
Neither "sound management" or "academic free
dom" are ethical principles. Sound management is a
good rule to follow for staying in business but no more
ethically mandatory than a preference for UFO over
FIFO inventory accounting. In most universities,
academic freedom is a normative and contractual expec
tation, often backed up with legal safeguards; it is also

an important part of the complex of democratic values
but it is not a principle of ethics although it can assuredly
be defended in terms of some ethical principle.
How can Dean Caughey assert that "intellectual integ
rity" necessarily demands that ideas serving the estab
lished order are always more suspect than ideas that
would change the social order? Was the intellectual de
fense of the Weimar republic more to be suspected than
the ideas advanced by the National Socialists who
sought its destruction.' Are justifications for America's
constitutional democracy more to be suspected than a
Maoist's advocacy of an "armed struggle" that would
substitute a dictatorship of the proletariat and abolish
"bourgeois" liberties?
If the wealthy and powerful control public informa
tion and use this control to reinforce their power, as
Caughey asserts, how does one account for the boomlet
in radical Marxist critiques of American society, Ameri
can "imperialism" etc. that establishment publishing
houses marketed in the late 60s to mid-70s—not to men
tion the many sociology potboilers that damned Ameri
can society under the guise of "scientific" analysis?
Why should there be a "contradiction in the liberal
commitment to freedom" in defending counterin
surgency efforts against a Marxist state in Central
America when this state is on its way to becoming a
dictatorship far more oppressive of peasants than the
regime that preceded it? Are the peasants of Afghanistan
being "oppressed" by America because we are con
tributing aid to their counterinsurgency? Moreover, if
we had aided counterinsurgency efforts against the Pol
Pot regime after it came to power in Cambodia, would
that have been an act of oppression against the peasan
try on our part?
Incidentally, a scholar who might oppose the take
over of South Africa by Soviet-backed guerillas is not
necessarily a supporter of the terrorists.
Dean Caughey implies that Hoover scholars have
somehow lent intellectual support to those who "fear a
public discussion of Marxism, socialism and issues of
social justice at home and in the world." To the contrary,

my reading of this controversy suggests that the fear is all
in the Dean's camp. It is the critical appraisals by some
Hoover scholars of all the voguish left-of-center doc
trines that have become entrenched around theOuad
that has gotten the other camp's adrenalin going. At
root, the fear is that the fashionable new orthodoxy will
be effectively challenged.
And well it should be! For the freedom of many
around the world has been put in severe jeopardy be
cause our political leaders have become exceedingly
timid about committing American military power and
resources to help free states defend themselves against
the Soviet Union and its surrogates. The Soviet Union,
by contrast, has no hesitancy whatsoever about arming
guerrillas and then helping them establish a police state
apparatus after they come to power.
Our leaders are hesitant in no small measure because
the Left on our campuses succeeded in persuading so
many that it wasn't communism that posed a threat to
freedom but America's efforts to combat it. The Left,
moreover, was given free reign to malign our nation in
the most obscene ways—by comparing us to Nazi Ger
many among other scandals against reason. This was the
"idealogical nonsense" on campus!
But while I believe that this advocacy was most un
wise, in addition to being perilous for other peoples'
freedom, I would never follow Dean Caughey in saying
that there must be something "wrong with academic
freedom" simply because it has been used to support
ideas I consider foolish. Nor would I ever imply that
"truth is honored" only when others come to accept my
concept of "social justice" or "oppression."
For conceivably I might be wrong. It is for the other
side to try to persuade me. They will have much better
luck if they attempt to persuade me and my colleagues
with fair and reasoned arguments instead of simply
labeling what we write or advocate as "nonsense"—
especially when they are visibly scuttling their own ar
guments in a torrent of non sequiturs.
