## Commercials: just why do they exist? 
### 
Summer is undeniably here,
and its arrival has again been ac
companied by a plethora of Hol
lywood screen productions.
These screen releases seem to
be growing in geometric propor
tions, and the United States may
soon be renowned for releasing,
among other things, the most
movies annually.
This world record is currently
held by India, whose film indus
try is as prolific as its population.
The quality of most Indian
movies, though, is extremely
poor—99 percent of them are
like the American "B" movies of
the '50s and the cheap glossies
churned out by Hollywood to
day. But India's masses couldn't
care less about quality criteria.
Indian movies not only offer ex
citement and escapism to illiter
ate millions, they are the only
form of superficial entertain
ment available in a nation whose
"home entertainment" media
hasn't overcome its birth pangs
yet.
Most of you would probably
find Indian television pretty hard
to take. Programs are broadcast
only in a few major cities.
There's only one channel to
choose from. Most telecasts and
sets are still in black and white.
The language barrier isn't so
much of a problem as lousy pro
gramming. So the absence of
frequent commercial breaks af
fords little solace.
One thing I've never been
able to understand is why com
mercials are shown on American
television at all. It's expensive
business! I guess you've heard
that advertisers paid $350,000 a
minute for spots during "Winds
of War" and $450,000 a minute
during the final episode of
"MASH."
Commercial television in
America seems to work on the
premise that:
• Advertisers offset shows' pro
duction costs by buying air
time.

• The sale of advertised products
is related to audience ratings.
Well, they got the first part of
that right.
Way back in the Dark Ages,
when television was still in its
infancy, some smart salesman
suckered company executives
into believing that the tube was
the best peddler ever invented.
"The door can never be slam
med on the Fuller Brush man
ever again," he might have said.
Nobody has since thought to
question this con game.
How many people today
watch the shows as well as the
commercials? According to
Neilsen and Arbitron, quite a
few. How many of you have
been surveyed by Neilsen or Ar
bitorn lately? For every one of
you who says yes, there are at
least five other people saying
no. The rising popularity of
cable and pay TV may be proof
that commercial television is
crumbling at its foundations.
How many of you subscribe to
cablevision ? For everyone of you
saying no, there are at least five
others saying yes.
It's hard to believe that TV
commercials actually have much
selling power. Most of the com
petitors cancel each other out.
("60 Minutes" recently reported
a survey of 5000 people who
"watched" the commercials dur
ing "Winds of War." None of the
products they named had been
advertised at that time.) Rising
air time costs drastically cut into
profits. And there's no conclu
sive evidence that shows par
ticular consumerism booms to
be the result of television adver
tising alone.
Personally, I'd hate to see
commercials go. Apart from the
fact that I've developed a special
liking for Mr. Whipple over the
years, I can't afford cable or pay
TV. So I'm content to let Big
Business foot my entertainment
bill. It's good to laugh at their
expense for a change.
