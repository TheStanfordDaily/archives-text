## $850 million and growing fast Strategy, luck pay off for endowment funds 
### JANE BAILIE 
Due to the combination of
shrewdness and luck on the part
of the University Investment
Management Organization, the
University might well experi
ence more than a 25 percent in
crease in its endowment values
during funding for the current
1983 fiscal year.
University Treasurer Rodney
Adams attributes the increase in
part to "a significant commit
ment to equity investment, the
result of our long range financial
planning and strategy which an
ticipates the long-term growth
of the equity markets."
Adams also credits the in
crease in the endowment, which
presently stands at $850 million,
to the recent improvement of
the stock market picture.
"We invest in a variety of
different types of equity assets
such as stock, real estate and
venture capital. This (the recent
gains in the stock market) is not a
major surprise for us," Adams
said.
"What we do here is not to
predict (the magnitude of mar
ket fluxuations) but acknowl
edge them,"said Adams. "We
try to dampen the volatility of
these cyclesâ€”to smooth them
out over time through diversifi
cation over different types of in
vestments.
"What we strive to do with the
University's endowment is try to
maintain a constant and increas
ing flow of revenue from the en
dowment. We have what we call

a pay-out formula or rule; our
formula takes into account the
probable run-ups and the de
clines of the market," Adams
said.
"But we also factor in what we
paid out last year, and pay out at
least that if the market is down,
while stepping-up the figure if
the market value has increased.
"We've been both shrewd and
lucky," Adams explained, "as a
variety of our investment hold
ings in this run-up have done
handsomely."
Adams observed that there is a
"different perspective" be
tween institutional and indi
vidual investors. "We can't go
out and have a big party and
spend our gains just because the

University endowment in
creases. On the institutional
level the gain is a much more
anticipated and controlled
event. It sounds less glamorous
than on the individual
level. . .but for the treasurer's
office it is as exciting to see the
success of youi efforts."
Adams is quick to recognize
the inevitable change in market
conditions, and emphasizes that
"the fact that there was a run-up
this year does not say there will
be a major run-up again next
year. These increases in prices
and market values cannot be
sustained for a definite period of
time. We attempt to take full ad
vantage of them, while at the
same time dampening their im

pact on us."
Despite the increase in the
value of the University endow
ment, the pay-out rate for the
University is not likely to change
that much. "The rate we earn is
not the rate we pay out. Our
(pay-out rate) is a percentage
which is based upon the long
term expected returns from the
capital market. It has a definite
relationship to our earnings, but
it isn't an immediate reflection
of it."
The endowment pay-out rate
to the University is determined
by two principal factors: the in
crease in market value and the
pay-out rate for the previous
year. Current inflation estimates
are also taken into account.

"The setting of the pay-out rate
is neither arbitrary nor perfect,"
explained Adams.
"It's not a complete science,
but is is more quantitative than
qualitative," Adams said.
Adams describes Stanford en
dowment investment goals as
"one of the more aggressive
strategies for a university in the
country. The more conventional
institutional investment' trategy
usually invests only in known
large stock names or the bond
market in general."
Whatever Stanford's strategy
is, one thing is for certain; it
works. A recent study puts Stan
ford third in the nation for Uni
versity endowments, behind
Harvard and Vale.
Future investments for the
University endowment include a
further increase in the venture
capital sector, a doubling of the
existing commitment to the in
ternational market and more
real estate investments, accord
ing to Adams. "We hope and ex
pect to add significant increases
in incremental returns by mov
ing more money into the less
conventional assets, such as the
international market. This in
vestment strategy still has to be
totally proven, as we're still in
the midst of implementing it.
The bottom line is that we are
trying to maintain the 'real value'
of the endowment support," he
said.
"Whatever we can do in one
area relieves the pressure in
other areas."

'We invest in a variety of different types of
equity assets such as stocks, real estate and
venture capital. This (the recent gains in the
stock market) is not a major surprise for us.
What we do here is not to predict (the mag
nitude of market flucuations) but acknowl
edge them. We try to dampen the volatility
of these cycles-to smooth them out over
time through diversification over different
types of investments/
