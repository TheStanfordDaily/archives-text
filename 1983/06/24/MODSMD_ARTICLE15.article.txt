# ASSU requests cable TV panel
## 
### ALAN TRIPP 
The ASSU Senate passed
unanimously Tuesday a resolu
tion calling for the formation of a
University level policy commit
tee to represent students, fac
ulty and staff as planning for a
local cable television service
area goes forward.
Resolution author graduate
senator jim McGrath told the
senate that it was appropriate for
them to have a voice in the de
velopment of cable service be
cause more than 90 percent of all
Stanford students would be af
fected by a move to bring cable
TV into the area.
Another resolution opposing
"the disparity between the
method of selecting" student

and faculty members of the Stan
ford Judicial Council (SJC) was
also passed by the senate. The
SJC, which oversees various as
pects of student conduct, is cur
rently composed of faculty
members appointed at the dis
cretion of the Faculty Senate and
student members chosen by the
ASSU Senate from a small ran
dom list of students supplied by
the University.
At the same time, the senate
approved five students for spots
on the SJC. The new members
are Cathy Anterasian, Angela
Lamotte, Ronald Daiz, Thom
Daniels and Eric Gilbert.
Graduate Senator Roland van
Gaalen submitted for notifcation
a controversial resolution

"against ceremonial prayers at
Stanford" which will be intro
duced for approval fall quarter.
The resolution requests that
University President Donald
Kennedy "abolish the use of
prayers at graduation cere
monies and similar official Uni
versity events."
Council of Presidents member
Vinnie Freda said new efforts
were being made to improve
services and cut losses at the
Coffee House. One hindrance in
this attempt is the fact that Cof
fee House board meetings have
been poorly attended in the past
month, he said. Two board posi
tions are open at present, one to
a member of the faculty and
another to a local restaurant
operator.
