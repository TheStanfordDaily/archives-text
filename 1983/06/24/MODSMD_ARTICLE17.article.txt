# Challenger shuttle lands today
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Cape Canaveral, Fla.—Space officials yesterday
ordered the Challenger space shuttle to return to
Earth this morning rather than stay in space an
extra day to wait for the weather to improve in
Florida.
But foul weather in Florida left mission control
undecided last night as to Challenger's landing
site. The decision not to extend the mission raised
the possibility of a landing at Edwards Air Force
Base, near Los angeles, at 6:56 this morning. How
ever, the spaceship would still have two opportu
nities to set down at Cape Canaveral before then if
the weather were acceptable.
Earlier it had been expected that the flight would
be extended by a day, or perhaps two, if thun
derstorms and clouds over centra! Florida made it
impossible to land on schedule.
But early yesterday, as the astronauts began
preparations for landing, Challenger experienced
a momentary malfunction of one of its auxiliary
power units, which power the spacecraft's control
surfaces on its wings and tail.
Although the unit, one of three, later began to
perform normally, officials in Houston decided
not to extend the flight beyond this morning.
Early yesterday Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, the
shuttle program director for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, said flatly
that there would be no shuttle landing in Florida
today.
But he withdrew the statement later as the wea
ther outlook took a turn for the better.
Challenger's six-day mission was officially
scheduled to end at the completion of its 96th
orbit, bringing it to its first landing at the Kennedy
Space Center at 3:53 a.m.
If the weather was unacceptable then, Chal
lenger Commander Robert Crippen and his crew

of four would have had one more chance at Florida—
at 5:29 a.m., on the next orbit.
As officials in Houston, Cape Canaveral and Ed
wards Air Force Base prepared for an early morn
ing touchdown, Crippen, along with pilot Freder
ick Hauck, and mission specialists Sally Ride, John
Fabian and Norman Thagard made landing prepa
rations aboard the spacecraft.
When challenger flew over the Indian Ocean
yesterday morning, astronaut John Blaha in Mis
sion Control told the crew, "We have some good
news."
"APU (auxiliary power unit) three is looking
good. The weather forecast at the cape has im
proved some, and we are pressing ahead with
nominal end of mission planning."
"Not knowing what you guys were going to do,
we have been getting the cabin tidied up a bit and
getting ready to come home tomorrow," Crippen
replied.
Air Force Maj. Donald Greene said that although
Florida was expected to get more thunderstorms
late yesterday, the moisture levels in the lower
atmosphere were decreasing, giving hope that a
cloud cover would not develop over the landing
area with sunrise this morning.
If the weather in Florida does force the landing
at Edwards, the astronauts are expected to touch
down on Runway 15 on the dry lake bed, where
three previous shuttle landings have occurred.
The urgency for landing in Florida was gener
ated in large part because NASA has scheduled
Challenger to fly again in 50 days.
Eight work days would be lost in moving the
shuttle back to Florida from Edwards.
A landing crew capable of taking necessary
safety precautions in helping the crew out of the
spacecraft has been at Edwards since Challenger
was launched last Saturday.
