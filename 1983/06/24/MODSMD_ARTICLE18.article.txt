# More arrests at Livermore protest
## 
### Associated Press 
Livermore—Another 33 de
monstrators were arrested
Wednesday for allegedly block
ing roads leading to a nuclear
weapons laboratory while al
most 1000 people arrested ear
lier refused arraignment on simi
lar charges.
The latest protest drew only
about 100 participants, a small
number compared to the 3300
protestors who formed human
blockades outside the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory on Mon
day. Authorities arrested 1,029
people at Monday's protest and
another five on Tuesday.
Alameda County is paying
$2900 per day just to rent tents
for the demonstrators at the
crowded Santa Rita jail, but most
protestors have chosen to stay
there rather than face arraign
ment before Municipal Court
Judge John Lewis.
Only 64 protestors had been
arraigned by Wednesday, jail of
ficials reported.
"People are holding out on
going to arraignments because
there hasn't been sufficient
negotiation between the district
attorney and our legal team,"
said Tamara Thompson of the
Livermore Action Group, which
is sponsoring the demonstra
tions.
An attorney on the legal team,
who asked not to be identified,
said the group has asked Lewis
to disqualify himself. The lawyer
said Lewis belongs to a civic
group founded by lab officials
and has held improper discus

sions with the district attorneys
office on the case.
The judge said he would re
view the request at a hearing on
Monday.
Lewis has offered to sentence
guilty protestors to their choice
of a $250 fine or 11 days in jail.
However, he also planned to
place them on probation for two
years, a move that would pro
hibit participation in future lab
demonstrations.
"People consistently, as a
principle, do not accept proba
tion because they think it's a vio
lation of their First Amendment
right," said Thompson, referring
to the right to assembly.
"People are going to hold out
until they feel that there's suffi
cient negotiations with the legal
team and there's an offer that is
fair and just in relation to the
action they took" she said.
Although life in the "tent city"
jail set up by Alameda County
has been somewhat rugged—
with nighttime temperatures
dippingintothe4os—the morale
of the prisoners is high.
"We're having a lot of fun,"
said a prisoner who identified
herself as Jane C. Doe. "We have
a singing group called the nu
clear beauty parlor where you
come if you want to curl up and
die."
A "hands-around-the-lab"
demonstration is scheduled for
tomorrow, although organizers
admit they probably will not
draw the thousands of partici
pants it would take to encircle
the sprawling lab 30 miles east of
San Francisco.
