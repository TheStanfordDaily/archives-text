# Stanford prof. questions age of 'Sunnyvale Girl'
## 
### JANE BAILIE 
Recent advances in the field of ar
cheological date determination through
the use of a cyclotron may serve to qualify
the age of the "Sunnyvale Girl," a skele
ton unearthed along Calabazas Creek in
the spring of 1972, as postulated by
Emeritus Anthropology Prof. Bert Gerow.
Gerow and a team of archeologists
from the United States Geological Survey
(USGS) have determined the age of the
Sunnyvale Girl to be between 3500 and
5000 years old, whereas Jeffrey Bada, a
geochemist at the University of Califor
nia's Scripps Institution of Oceanography
in La Jolla, initially estimated the skeleton
to be approximately 70,000 years old.
"I feel that it's in the vicinity of 50 to
60,000 years old." Bada said, "but it's not
easy to determine the age of this sample.
"The problem that we're facing is one
of instrumentation," explained Bada.
"We're using new instruments —a parti
cle accelerator at Oxford University and it
just isn't behaving right. So we've been
put on hold for the moment."

Bada, employing the amino acid trans
tormation test to date the samples, attri
butes the discrepency in the age deter
mination to possible contamination of
the skeletal samples that he was sent
shortly after the discovery of the Sun
nyvale Girl and a difference in the im
plementation of the age determination
processes used by Gerow and himself.
"He (Gerow) is of the opinion that the
C-14 is the absolute technique, " Bada
said. "On the other hand, I look at those
dates with great skepticism.
"There are a lot of problems in dealing,
with the C-14 (a method of age determi
nation which measure the amount of
Carbon 14 in a particular fossil), and we're
going to see if we can circumvent them
and arrive at a substantial answer," Bada
said.
However, Gerow feels that the
"geological evidence is very clear that it
(the Sunnyvale Girl) couldn't be any older
than 10,000 years."
"It could possibly be as young as 4460,"
Gerow said.

This theory has been substantiated by
the fact that a small group of snail shells
which were discovered only a short dis
tance from the intrusive shaft in which
the skeleton was found were dated at
10,000 years. Further evidence confirm
ing the more recent age of the skeleton
exists from the discovery of an antler
wedge buried in a similar intrusion found
400 meters down stream. The tool was
immersed in a pool of charcoal whose age
was positively determined by carbon dat
ing to be 4460 (plus or minus 95) years old.
"From the archeology and from other
sites, we know the settlement patterns of
that area," explained Gerow. "The loca
tion of the site corresponds to a common
local prehistoric settlement pattern in
that it is situated on a flood plane near the
zero contour of the water table irrespec
tive of its distance from the open water of
the bay."
The ground level of her burial site was
discovered to be well above the nearby
bone fragments of prehistoric horses,
mammoths and camels which were

known to have inhabited the area in addi
tion to the La Brea Tar Pits of Los Angeles
several thousand years earlier.
The skull, Gerow insists, is in many
ways identical to that of modern hu
mans and therefore indicates a lineage
that began long before traces of the exis
tence of Neanderthal man was dis
covered in Europe.
"If it were true that she was 70,000,"
continued Gerow, "it would mean that
man had entered the new world long be
fore the previously confirmed date
(12,000-14,000 years ago), making the new
world the site of the Garden of Eden. All
the evidence points to the fact that man
evolved from apes in the old world. The
new world is only 15,000-20,000 years old.
There is certainly no evidence that man
was here 40, 50, 70,000 years ago."
"People say that we're disputing the
established age (of the Sunnyvale Girl)
but it's an age which was established.
We're merely adding additional informa
tion which estimates the skeleton to be
around 4972 years old."

nia's Scripps Institution of Oceanography
in La Jolla, initially estimated the skeleton
to be approximately 70,000 years old.
"I feel that it's in the vicinity of 50 to
60,000 years old." Bada said, "but it's not
easy to determine the age of this sample.
"The problem that we're facing is one
of instrumentation," explained Bada.
"We're using new instruments —a parti
cle accelerator at Oxford University and it
just isn't behaving right. So we've been
put on hold for the moment."

Bada, employing the amino acid trans
tormation test to date the samples, attri
butes the discrepency in the age deter
mination to possible contamination of
the skeletal samples that he was sent
shortly after the discovery of the Sun
nyvale Girl and a difference in the im
plementation of the age determination
processes used by Gerow and himself.
"He (Gerow) is of the opinion that the
C-14 is the absolute technique, " Bada
said. "On the other hand, I look at those
dates with great skepticism.
"There are a lot of problems in dealing,
with the C-14 (a method of age determi
nation which measure the amount of
Carbon 14 in a particular fossil), and we're
going to see if we can circumvent them
and arrive at a substantial answer," Bada
said.
However, Gerow feels that the
"geological evidence is very clear that it
(the Sunnyvale Girl) couldn't be any older
than 10,000 years."
"It could possibly be as young as 4460,"
Gerow said.

This theory has been substantiated by
the fact that a small group of snail shells
which were discovered only a short dis
tance from the intrusive shaft in which
the skeleton was found were dated at
10,000 years. Further evidence confirm
ing the more recent age of the skeleton
exists from the discovery of an antler
wedge buried in a similar intrusion found
400 meters down stream. The tool was
immersed in a pool of charcoal whose age
was positively determined by carbon dat
ing to be 4460 (plus or minus 95) years old.
"From the archeology and from other
sites, we know the settlement patterns of
that area," explained Gerow. "The loca
tion of the site corresponds to a common
local prehistoric settlement pattern in
that it is situated on a flood plane near the
zero contour of the water table irrespec
tive of its distance from the open water of
the bay."
The ground level of her burial site was
discovered to be well above the nearby
bone fragments of prehistoric horses,
mammoths and camels which were

known to have inhabited the area in addi
tion to the La Brea Tar Pits of Los Angeles
several thousand years earlier.
The skull, Gerow insists, is in many
ways identical to that of modern hu
mans and therefore indicates a lineage
that began long before traces of the exis
tence of Neanderthal man was dis
covered in Europe.
"If it were true that she was 70,000,"
continued Gerow, "it would mean that
man had entered the new world long be
fore the previously confirmed date
(12,000-14,000 years ago), making the new
world the site of the Garden of Eden. All
the evidence points to the fact that man
evolved from apes in the old world. The
new world is only 15,000-20,000 years old.
There is certainly no evidence that man
was here 40, 50, 70,000 years ago."
"People say that we're disputing the
established age (of the Sunnyvale Girl)
but it's an age which was established.
We're merely adding additional informa
tion which estimates the skeleton to be
around 4972 years old."
