# Incorporation starts for East Palo Alto
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
After a decade-long struggle
and a razor-thin pro-incor
poration vote this month,
East Palo Alto is well on its way to
city hood.
The California Supreme Court
declined to hear a challenge to
the election's legality and lifted a
court order that had stopped the
implementation of the pro
incorporation vote last week,
clearing the way for the city's in
auguration and the election of
it's first mayor. Both events will
take place at East Palo Alto's first
city council meeting next Friday
night.
Former U.S. Rep. Paul "Pete"
McCloskey had represented a
number of East Palo Alto resi
dents who wished to challenge
the election results, but accord
ing to Bob Allen, East Palo Alto's
interim city manager, "the in
corporation is going to proceed
as planned."
Allen is trying to "put in
proper working order" the
necessary machinery for East
Palo Alto's incorporation, while
a San Mateo County task force is
working feverishly to insure all
the county's paperwork is ready
for East Palo Alto to become San
Mateo County's 20th city next
Friday.

The incorporation will bring
"significant changes" and a de
gree of self-rule to the poverty
stricken community, Allen said.
"They will, for example, in
time have their own planning
commission, doing their own
planning and zoning, rather
than having to rely on others,
I'm only here on an interim
basis, but soon they'll have their
own full-time city manager, with
his own staff. The recreation dis
trict, which is an existing body,
will become absorbed on July
2," he explained.
Allen said he is not concerned
with charges from opponents to
East Palo Alto's incorporation
that the area does not have a suf
ficient tax base to support a city.
"An independent Sacramento
firm in a 1981 report and again in
1982, evaluated the revenues and
expenditures, and as a result of
those studies we have the incor
poration," he said.
The new city council includes,
ironically, Gertrude Wilks, a
long-time opponent of East Palo
Alto's incorporation.
Wilks will, nevertheless, serve
on the council. She told the
Peninsula Times Tribune that,
since she has worked with the
other new council members be
fore, she doesn't anticipate any
problems.
