# Rodin sculptures grace Quad, wait for home

### 
Adding to the already exten
sive outdoor campus art collec
tion, four major bronze
sculptures by Auguste Rodin,
representing four Burghers of
Calais, have been installed in
courtyards of the Stanford
Quadrangle.
The sculptures are on loan
from the B. Gerald Cantor col
lections and will remain on view
in the courtyards for the next
two years. They eventually will
become part of the B. Gerald
Cantor sculpture garden, being
built immediately south of the
Stanford Art Museum. It is
scheduled for completion by
June 198 I }.
According to Stanford Art
Prof. Albert Elsen, one of the

world's foremost authorities on
Rodin, Cantor felt these great
sculptures should be placed out
on campus where they could be
seen and enjoyed rather than
placed in long-term storage.
The statue of Eustache de St.
Pierre, elderly leader of the Bur
ghers, has been installed in His
tory Corner Courtyard; Jean de
Eiennes and Pierre de Wissant in
Memorial Courtyard; and Jean
d'Aire who carried the key to
Calais, on the terrace on the
western Lomita Mall side of the
Quad between Mathematics and
Values, Technology and Society.
In 1347, after a siege of 11
months, Calais fell to king Ed
ward 111 of England. Six burghers
of the city offered their lives as
hostages if the king would lift

the siege. The burghers were
spared when Edward's queen,
Philippa, interceded. Rodin was
commissioned by the city of
Calais in 1884 to conceive a
monument in memory of the
burghers.
Each of the Burghers was con
ceived separately and ultimately
joined into a single final monu
ment. During Rodin's lifetime,
statues of the individual Bur
ghers, notably those of Eustache
de St. Pierre and Jean d'Aire,
were exhibited, purchased and
publicly installed in various
European cities.
According to Elsen, "Rodin's
conception of the Burghers sur
prised and dismayed many in
Calais because he did not show
them stoically and happily ac
cepting their fate. Rodin's view
of heroism credited his public
with greater sophistication than
it had at the time.
"He saw true coverage as the
overcoming of fear, and each of
his Burghers is revealed in terms
of how he came to terms with his
own death. Such displays of feel
ing were considered at the time
unbecoming secular martyrs,
but ultimately Rodin imposed
his vision on the public.
"Rodin has shown the Bur
ghers stripped of their armor or
normal attire, wearing shifts and
ropes around their necks as
symbols of surrender. Each fig
ure is a powerful recreation of an
individual Burgher, a marvelous
confluence of artistic imagina
tion and realism," Elsen con
tinued.
Elsen said that Rodin had to
rely upon his imagination and
custom or working from live
models, in the absence of any
contemporary description of the
hostages.
Rodin sought to show men
who had been hardy of physique
before the siege, but who had
suffered from starvation before
their surrender, Elsen said.
"He made these figures with
what from close up seem very
large hands and feet, but which
he knew was necesary for their
gestures to visually carry from
the great distance when seen
out-of-doors," Elsen said. "Their
movements are almost dance

like as Rodin choreographed the
way their spirits resisted but
their bodies complied with the
demands of duty. All the bur
ghers were made of the same
height to signify the equality of
their sacrifice."
According to Elsen, the bur
ghers remind viewers of the
great tradition of western art "in
which public monuments were
made to celebrate the dead and
dying, heroes for causes in
which they believe, and men
who despite the injustice of their
fate met it bravely."
"Such sculpture was frankly
intended to arouse the spirit of
nationalism in all who saw it,"
Elsen said. "Rodin's monument
was to heroes in defeat, and a
reminder to his countrymen

who had suffered a humiliating
defeat at the hands of the Prus
sians in 1870, that Frenchmen
could act nobly under the worst
of circumstances.
"Each Burgher as interpreted
by Rodin is a drama within an
overall play. Just as each
sculpture is expressive when
seen from every prospect, so too
do successive views help to re
veal unfolding aspects of the in
dividual dramas. Each figure is a
summation of successive physi
cal movements," Elsen said.
"Rodin believed that the artist
should learn from nature, but
not be inhibited from exaggerat
ing what he found —to lie in
order to tell the truth, as he put
it, in ordertocreatecredibleand
important art."

ghers stripped of their armor or
normal attire, wearing shifts and
ropes around their necks as
symbols of surrender. Each fig
ure is a powerful recreation of an
individual Burgher, a marvelous
confluence of artistic imagina
tion and realism," Elsen con
tinued.
Elsen said that Rodin had to
rely upon his imagination and
custom or working from live
models, in the absence of any
contemporary description of the
hostages.
Rodin sought to show men
who had been hardy of physique
before the siege, but who had
suffered from starvation before
their surrender, Elsen said.
"He made these figures with
what from close up seem very
large hands and feet, but which
he knew was necesary for their
gestures to visually carry from
the great distance when seen
out-of-doors," Elsen said. "Their
movements are almost dance

like as Rodin choreographed the
way their spirits resisted but
their bodies complied with the
demands of duty. All the bur
ghers were made of the same
height to signify the equality of
their sacrifice."
According to Elsen, the bur
ghers remind viewers of the
great tradition of western art "in
which public monuments were
made to celebrate the dead and
dying, heroes for causes in
which they believe, and men
who despite the injustice of their
fate met it bravely."
"Such sculpture was frankly
intended to arouse the spirit of
nationalism in all who saw it,"
Elsen said. "Rodin's monument
was to heroes in defeat, and a
reminder to his countrymen

who had suffered a humiliating
defeat at the hands of the Prus
sians in 1870, that Frenchmen
could act nobly under the worst
of circumstances.
"Each Burgher as interpreted
by Rodin is a drama within an
overall play. Just as each
sculpture is expressive when
seen from every prospect, so too
do successive views help to re
veal unfolding aspects of the in
dividual dramas. Each figure is a
summation of successive physi
cal movements," Elsen said.
"Rodin believed that the artist
should learn from nature, but
not be inhibited from exaggerat
ing what he found —to lie in
order to tell the truth, as he put
it, in ordertocreatecredibleand
important art."

Adding to the already exten
sive outdoor campus art collec
tion, four major bronze
sculptures by Auguste Rodin,
representing four Burghers of
Calais, have been installed in
courtyards of the Stanford
Quadrangle.
The sculptures are on loan
from the B. Gerald Cantor col
lections and will remain on view
in the courtyards for the next
two years. They eventually will
become part of the B. Gerald
Cantor sculpture garden, being
built immediately south of the
Stanford Art Museum. It is
scheduled for completion by
June 198 I }.
According to Stanford Art
Prof. Albert Elsen, one of the

world's foremost authorities on
Rodin, Cantor felt these great
sculptures should be placed out
on campus where they could be
seen and enjoyed rather than
placed in long-term storage.
The statue of Eustache de St.
Pierre, elderly leader of the Bur
ghers, has been installed in His
tory Corner Courtyard; Jean de
Eiennes and Pierre de Wissant in
Memorial Courtyard; and Jean
d'Aire who carried the key to
Calais, on the terrace on the
western Lomita Mall side of the
Quad between Mathematics and
Values, Technology and Society.
In 1347, after a siege of 11
months, Calais fell to king Ed
ward 111 of England. Six burghers
of the city offered their lives as
hostages if the king would lift

the siege. The burghers were
spared when Edward's queen,
Philippa, interceded. Rodin was
commissioned by the city of
Calais in 1884 to conceive a
monument in memory of the
burghers.
Each of the Burghers was con
ceived separately and ultimately
joined into a single final monu
ment. During Rodin's lifetime,
statues of the individual Bur
ghers, notably those of Eustache
de St. Pierre and Jean d'Aire,
were exhibited, purchased and
publicly installed in various
European cities.
According to Elsen, "Rodin's
conception of the Burghers sur
prised and dismayed many in
Calais because he did not show
them stoically and happily ac
cepting their fate. Rodin's view
of heroism credited his public
with greater sophistication than
it had at the time.
"He saw true coverage as the
overcoming of fear, and each of
his Burghers is revealed in terms
of how he came to terms with his
own death. Such displays of feel
ing were considered at the time
unbecoming secular martyrs,
but ultimately Rodin imposed
his vision on the public.
"Rodin has shown the Bur
ghers stripped of their armor or
normal attire, wearing shifts and
ropes around their necks as
symbols of surrender. Each fig
ure is a powerful recreation of an
individual Burgher, a marvelous
confluence of artistic imagina
tion and realism," Elsen con
tinued.
