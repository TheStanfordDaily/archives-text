# Spyro Gyra shadows their former selves

### MARK ZEIGLER 
The seven members of Spyro
Gyra could have just as well used
shovels in place of their instru
ments last Friday at the Old Wal
dorf. Saxophones, drums and
guitars or just shovels, the group
was doing the same thing — dig
ging its own grave.
And when Spyro Gyra "dies,"
which should be sometime in
the near future, the septet will
be able to place the entire blame
on one party. Itself.
It wasn't that the popular in
strumental, jazz/fusion group
played poorly last Friday.
Granted, they've sounded bet
ter, but musical talent is not a
problem here. Rather, it was
what Spyro Gyra played that is
cause for alarm.
Of the group's 10 concert
songs, eight were either from
Incognito, a 1982 LP, or a soon
to-be-released album. New
music, plastic and phony and,
above all, a departure from

Spyro Gyra's original sound.
Gone is the fluid, flowing,
almost Latin sound that Spyro
Gyra once knew. In its place is an
overly funky bassline and
melodies that lash out at the lis
tener's ears. Spyro Gyra's music
no longer soothes, but now
scolds.
Spyro Gyra's major problem is
that while it copied and com
bined a number of sounds when
just starting out, it kept the
Xerox machine running a bit too
long. Once the group had in
deed established its own
"sound" by meshing other
bands' "sounds," it didn't stop.
The latest trends in the jazz/
fusion world lean towards funk
rather than rock or jazz. Spyro
Gyra is following that trend
blindly alongwith ahostof other
instrumental bands.
The new Spyro Gyra music in
cludes funky, crisp basslines
that after a few measures be
come tiresome with repetition.

These basslines, as well as the
drum beat, are infinitely less
complex than on previous Spyro
Gyra albums. The soloing talent
is still there, but it is the founda
tion backing the solos that has
collapsed.
The group's next album is due
to hit the record stores some
time next month. While Spyro
Gyra certainly parted from past
styles with Incognito, it still had
a chance to rebound from the
poor effort and bounce back
into old Spyro Gyra form. But
the septet played plenty of the
new album in concert, enough
at least to dispel any hopes that
they were indeed on the mend.
It's sad to see a band of Spyro
Gyra's caliber fall by the
wayside. Sure, the jazz/fusion
industry is hurting. But the "big
gies" like Grover Washington,
)r. and Earl Klugh are still selling
enough albums to keep them
out of the unemployment line.
Grover Washington, Jr. and Earl

Mugh, however, are doing the
same thing they have been for
the past 10 years except for a few
minor changes.
Spyro Gyra had that same type
of sound — one that people en
joyed listening to enough to buy
albums. But Spyro Gyra made
too many changes and lost that
sound.
Now they're going to pay for
it.
