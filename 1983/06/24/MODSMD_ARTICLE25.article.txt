# Nightclubbing the Bay: a first-timers' cache of clues
## 
### ERIC POSTEL 
Summer may well be for summer school, but sum
mer is also for listening to music. The tradition was
started centuries ago (so don't bother asking hows or
whys), and rock and roll has proved to be no excep
tion to the practice. Its rebellious spirit, danceable
rhythms and sonorous volume make rock and roll the
obvious choice for summer good times. Fortunately,
Stanford is nicely located for those of us who enjoy
live music. This is an introduction to the musical
possibilities of the Bay Area.
The San Francisco area has always enjoyed a
plethora of good music. During the '60s the concept
of rock concerts was considerably expanded by vari
ous San Francisco promoters. One of the promoters
quickly developed a reputation as being the most
professional. Eventually, Bill Graham came to pro
mote concerts in such famous locations as Fillmore
West and Winterland. Today, he has a virtual
monopoly on the S.F. rock music scene. From the
time a group first visits the city to play in the small Old
Waldorf nightclub until the day the group plays in
front of 60,000 screaming fans at the Oakland Col
iseum, Bill Graham will be making the arrangements.
While many people rightfully resent the infamous
body searches at concerts and a somewhat conserva

tive booking policy, most area residents enjoy many
benefits from Bill Graham's presence. As a result of
his prestige, power within the music business, and
rapport with many musicians, San Francisco has en
joyed such special concerts as the The Band's final
concert and a joint Grateful Dead-Who concert.
Your first order of business in concert-going
should be to buy tickets. Buy your tickets from the
Bay Area Seating Service (BASS) computer terminal at
the-Tresidder Ticket Office (closed on weekends) or
at Bullock's in the Stanford Shopping Center. For
optimal seats, I would strongly encourage you to
purchase tickets the same day the ad appears. For
those of you like me who need to be up close and
personal, the most "intimate" concert halls are the
Kabuki Theater (1500 seats) and the outdoor Greek
Theater at Berkeley (about 5000 seats).
Clubs obviously offer much more intimacy, and the
area is full of them. The so-called "Keystone Family"
consists of three clubs, the closest of which is on
California Avenue in Palo Alto. The clubs feature a
potpurri of musical sounds. The great thing is that the
club is only eight blocks away and admits all of us
under-21ers. Watch out for the drinks though —
they're expensive. The l-Beam is in the hlaight-Asbury
district and features live music on Monday nights.

The bands are predominately local new wave bands.
This is the best club in San Francisco: videos, lights,
fresh air, good djs, lots of dancing room, and cheap
drinks. Go Tuesday thru Thursday for dancing, and
be sure to show your student ID to save $1. If you are
not 21, don't bother, because they card virtually
everyone.
The Old Waldorf will be moving to a new location
next month, but will continue to book relatively new
national artists all summer. The club takes under-21s,
and has an especially good heavy metal night on
Mondays. For you hardcore punk fans, check out On
Broadway and its downstairs cousin, the Mabuhay
Gardens ("Fab Mab"), or the Sound of Music in the
Tenderloin district. There are also several other good
dance clubs in the city. Unfortunately, those Stanford
students who are under 21 with the overpowering
urge to dance are going to have to do so at dorm
parties, Fargo's in the Old Mill, or at live perform
ances; all the dance clubs card every entrant.
If none of this sounds appealing to you, go see
some jazz at Keystone Korner (unfortunately not ad
vertised very often), visit the wonderful San Francisco
Opera, or have your ears examined.
