## Confucius say: good Chinese food is near 
### DIANE JOHNSON KAREN SPRINGEN 
King Chuan
Town and Country Village
323-6550
If you rein a state of "Confu
cian" about which Chinese res
taurant to go to, stay close to
home. King Chuan, conven
iently located in Town and
Country Village, serves up qual
ity meals at a sensible price.
Featuring luncheon specials
as low as 53.25, King Chuan of
fers a variety of Peking and
Szechuan entrees, appetizers,
soups and desserts. In addition,
King Chuan extends to the diner
a choice of wine, sake and four
beers to complement the en

trees and provide relief from the
hot and spicy dishes.
While the restaurant seats up
to 80, it still maintains a cozy at
mosphere. Customary Chinese
lanterns drape from the ceiling
and soft lighting provides a
homey, quaint ambience.
The restaurant accommodates
large parties as well, with tables
for up to 12. It might be wise to
call ahead, especially if you want
to go on peak nights —
Wednesday and Friday.
Our attentive waiter patiently
and willingly explained each
dish's ingredients and meaning
in Chinese culture.
We began with rice soup and

seaweed soup. Sizzling rice
soup (53.25) is highly recom
mended, and the seaweed soup
($3.25) is good for the adventur
ous. Both were served as healthy
portions—luckily we conserved
on the soup so we would have
room for the evenings' high
lights.
The highlights were numer
ous! We sampled — and
devoured—six dishes, all of
which were chosen by the chef
to give us a taste of each of the
many categories of entrees (sea
foods, pork, fowl, beef, vegeta
bles, chow mein and soup noo
dles).
