## Confucius say: good Chinese food is near 
### DIANE JOHNSON KAREN SPRINGEN 
King Chuan
Town and Country Village
323-6550
If you rein a state of "Confu
cian" about which Chinese res
taurant to go to, stay close to
home. King Chuan, conven
iently located in Town and
Country Village, serves up qual
ity meals at a sensible price.
Featuring luncheon specials
as low as 53.25, King Chuan of
fers a variety of Peking and
Szechuan entrees, appetizers,
soups and desserts. In addition,
King Chuan extends to the diner
a choice of wine, sake and four
beers to complement the en

trees and provide relief from the
hot and spicy dishes.
While the restaurant seats up
to 80, it still maintains a cozy at
mosphere. Customary Chinese
lanterns drape from the ceiling
and soft lighting provides a
homey, quaint ambience.
The restaurant accommodates
large parties as well, with tables
for up to 12. It might be wise to
call ahead, especially if you want
to go on peak nights —
Wednesday and Friday.
Our attentive waiter patiently
and willingly explained each
dish's ingredients and meaning
in Chinese culture.
We began with rice soup and

seaweed soup. Sizzling rice
soup (53.25) is highly recom
mended, and the seaweed soup
($3.25) is good for the adventur
ous. Both were served as healthy
portions—luckily we conserved
on the soup so we would have
room for the evenings' high
lights.
The highlights were numer
ous! We sampled — and
devoured—six dishes, all of
which were chosen by the chef
to give us a taste of each of the
many categories of entrees (sea
foods, pork, fowl, beef, vegeta
bles, chow mein and soup noo
dles).

For vegetarians we recom
mend eggplant with garlic sauce
($4.25), our favorite entree. The
sauce was a bit spicy for our
American taste buds but it was a
unique dish and one everyone
should try once. Another favo
rite was the sliced scallops with
garlic sauce ($6.25).
For appetizers we sampled
spring rolls ($2.50) and won tons
($2.50) served with a red sauce, a
specialty of the house. Our wai
ter explained the unique shape
of the won tons, carefully
fashioned after a flower.
The spring rolls—good for all
seasons! —were served piping

hot and fully stuffed with shred
ded meat and veggies.
Other a la carte entrees in
clude bean curd with black
mushrooms, various chow mein
dishes, cherry pork. Peking
duck and beef with Hunan
sauce.
King Chuan thoughtfully
marks particularly spicy dishes
with a red diamond—helpful for
the weak of tongue with sensi
tive taste buds.
As a grand finale, King Chuan
offers three desserts—glazed
bananas, lychees and apples, all
$4. Unfortunately, we were so
stuffed that we couldn't eat
another "chopstick"-full of
anything—even dessert.

King Chuan boasts a bottom
less cup of tea and tree seconds,
thirds, fourths ... on rice.
After only six years of exis
tence, King Chuan has captured
a substantial part of the Chinese
food market. Apparently on
Wednesday and Friday even
ings, there is a short wait to be
seated. Friday lunches are also a
busy time, so it is suggested that
you try the restaurant during the
week if you're in the mood for a
quiet, relaxing dinner.
For a home-cooked Chinese
meal at an economical price,
King Chuan is "fortune"-ately
only a jaunt away!
