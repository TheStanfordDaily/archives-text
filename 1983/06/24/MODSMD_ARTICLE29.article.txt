## STARTS offers it all, from dance to mechanics

Do you have an area you've
always wanted to study, a skill
you've always wanted to learn,
or a class you've always wanted
to take—but didn't have the
time, money, or desire to com
pete for a grade; 1 This summer
might be your chance.

Most of these classes teach skills that you may
have always wanted to learn, but never had
the chance. There aren't many outlets on
campus for that-and as a student union we

Student Arts at Stanford
(STARTS) offers almost 20 rela
tively inexpensive summer clas
ses, ranging from Japanese
flower arranging to auto me
chanics, that do not require a
Stanford registration or, more
importantly, Stanford tuition.
Most of these classes teach
skills that you may have always
wanted to learn, but never had
the chance," explained Jennifer
Watson, information coor
dinator for STARTS. "There
aren't many outlets on campus
for that—and as a student union,
we feel it's one of our duties to
provide one."
STARTS has grown consid-

erably since its conception ten
years ago, when Craig Saunders,
a graduate student, taught a
disco-dance class. This summer
STARTS will offer 19 courses.
Organizers say that one of the
keys to the program's success
has been the relatively low cost
of the classes.

Prices range from $10 for a
crochet class, to $18 for callig
raphy and "assessingyour think
ing style," to $24 for recorder
and modern dance, to $48 for
ballet.
For the thrifty at heart, a one
day chocolate workshop is only
five bucks, and, for the more ex
travagant, a two-day seminar on
creating your own professional
image goes for $30.
The mix of students, staff
members and community
people in STARTS classes is
another key to the program's
success.
"It's nice to have classes that
don't have grade pressure or
credit,' Watson added. "It's sort

of like learning something for
one's self, not for grades or
other people."
The program attracts a
number of well-known instruc
tors, many who teach other clas
ses outside of the STARTS pro
gram.
STARTS ballroom dancing in
structors Colin and Yvonne Hes
ter are internationally known
performers and teachers. The
pair teaches ballroom dance five
days a week at Stanford, Bel
mont, Foothill College and San
Mateo. This is their first year
with STARTS, but they've taught
in the area for 11 years.
Billie Odell, calligraphy in
structor, also teaches painting
and drawing at the Palo Alto Art
Club. She has conducted tarot
card reading for STARTS in the
past, and has taught calligraphy
there for four years.
Her class emphasized devel
oping a beautiful, individualized
italic style— "a skill," she said,
"which is immediately valuable
at Stanford, with posters and in
vitations."
The instructor for natural
weight control, Mary Leigh
Burke, conducted the same class
for STARTS during spring quar
ter and at the Bridge winterquar
ter.
The focus," Burke explained,
"is not on diets but is on your
feelings and what's in your
mind. We do a lot of self
awareness and visualization
exercises, keep a food journal,
and do some yoga."
She plans to expand her pro
gram at Stanford and possibly
into the community as well.
