# Board approves Hoover panel
## 
### MARC JEFFERSON 
The board of trustees ap
proved June 10 the request of
the Senate of the Academic
Council to appoint an ad hoc
committee to "explore and reas
sess the relations between the
Hoover Institution and the Uni
versity."
The mission of the committee,
according to Assistant to the
President Robert Hamrdla, will
be to "advise the board at its
next meeting on the nature and
direction that the examination
should take." The board meets
again in early September.
Although the individual
members of the committee have
not yet been chosen, William
Kimball, president of the board
of trustees, will serve as chair
man.
Kimball is now in the process
of choosing the members, but
the appointments will probably
not take place until the first
week of July.
In an effort to "clear the air,"
Kimball said that there will be a
great deal of informal discussion
during the summer over the In
stitution's relationship with the
University. Kimball himself will
meet with the institution's over
seers while Kennedy will meet
with W. Glenn Campbell,
Hoover's director.
The controversy over the
Hoover Institution began in
April with a petition drive spon
sored by Political Science Prof.
John Manley and English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz.
The petition protested the In
stitution's alleged partisanship
and the corresponding threats
to the academic freedom of

those professors at Stanford
who have joint appointments as
fellows ot the Institution.
The professors' concern was
sparked by the Institution's an
nual report which trumpeted the
institution's close relations with
the Reagan administration.
A student petition soon fol
lowed, gathering some 1400 sig
natures. Later, French Prof. Al
phonse Julliand began a

counter-petition which
gathered 131 faculty signatures.
The original petitioners ques
tion what they see as an ambigu
ous relationship between the In
stitution and the University.
The Institution receives ap
proximately half of its operating
funds, $4.2 million, from the
University, but at the same time
maintains a great deal of inde
pendence in matters of hiring
and firing.
