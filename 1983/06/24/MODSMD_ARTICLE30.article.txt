# CINEMASCOPE
## CINEMA SCOPE 
### 
A Place in the Sun (1951) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
George Stevens made this sec
ond film version of Theodore
Dreiser's An American Tragedy;
the first, by Josef von Sternberg
in 1931, was picketed by Dreiser
because he claimed it distorted
the vision of his novel, and
chances are he wouldn't have
been too happy with this one,
either. It's difficult to figure out
the point of view in the Maurice
Wilson-Harry Brown script.
When the social climbing hero
(Montgomery Clift), in love with
a beautiful rich girl (Elizabeth
Taylor), takes his pregnant fian
cee out for a row on the lake, he
intends to drown her, but the
boat capsizes and she drowns
without his help; in court, he is
judged guilty because he didn't
try to save her life. Puzzling or
not, however, it's a very powerful
film, and if you saw it as a teen
ager you'll probably remember
the love scenes between Clift and
Taylor for the rest of your life.
Taylor looks beautiful enough to
drive any man to murder his fian
cee, and she has never given a
more touching performance;
and Clift's portrayal of the trou
bled hero is one of the signal
moments in movies of this era —
it goes a long way toward explain
ing why people went wild over
method acting. Shelley Winters
plays the doomed girl, Raymond

Burr is the D.A., and the startling
black and white photography is
by William C. Mellor.
Plays Thursday with The
Razor's Edge.
Kagemusha the Shadow War
rior (1980) ★
Fox, Redwood City
At 70, Akira Kurosawa pro
duced this epic of Shakespearean
scope about a thief in 16th
century Japan who must act as
the double of a warlord. (Tatsuya
Nakadai plays both roles.)
Kurosawa draws on all the styles
he has embraced in 37 years of
filmmaking: in subject matter,
the movie takes him back to his
samurai pictures, but the battle
scenes, magnificent as they are,
are enriched with the humanism
that has emerged in his work
since the mid-'6os. They seem
like immense and tragic canvas
ses that David or Delacroix might
have painted.
Plays Wednesday.
Little Women (1933) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
George Cukor filmed Louisa
May Alcott's story the same year
he made Dinner at Eight, and
though it has been given pther
productions on film and televi
sion, this is easily the best. It is a
terrific example of how good the

Hollywood studio system could
be: what used to be called the
"production values" (i.e., art
direction and costumes) are exe
cuted with great care, the narra
tive is reassuringly strong, and
the cast (except for insipid lean
Parker as Beth) works together
beautifully. Joan Bennett is Amy,
Frances Dee is Meg, Spring
Byington is Marmee, Edna May
Oliver is Aunt March, Douglass
Montgomery is Laurie, Paul
Lukas is Professor Baer, Henry
Stephenson is Mr. Laurence,
and, in only her second year in
movies, Katharine Hepburn plays
Jo. Vou feel that Alcott must have
created Jo fully believingthat one
day an actress just like Hepburn
would come along to play her.
No one else could have brought
such heartbreaking intensity to
the scene in which Jo bemoans
Meg's begin drawn away from

Reviews by Sieve Vineberg

the family into a romance, or
another in which she rejects
Laurie's proposal and then tells
Marmee, "I feel as if I'd stabbed
my best friend." It's a great per
formance, and one of the few
that truly shows a character's as
cension to maturity.
Plays through Wednesday with
Pride and Prejudice.
Arthur (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
Steve Cordon's uneven com
edy, cast in the mold of the
long-extinct Depression comedy
about an improbably rich hero
who falls in love with a pleb. One
may be puzzled by Gordon's

time-warp sensibility, and as the
poor girl, Liza Minelli is an anac
hronism within an anachronism;
she's also too emphatic for such a
small movie. But the scenes be
tween Dudley Moore (in the title
role) and John Cielgud (as his
valet) are worth the price of ad
mission.

George Stevens made this sec
ond film version of Theodore
Dreiser's An American Tragedy;
the first, by Josef von Sternberg
in 1931, was picketed by Dreiser
because he claimed it distorted
the vision of his novel, and
chances are he wouldn't have
been too happy with this one,
either. It's difficult to figure out
the point of view in the Maurice
Wilson-Harry Brown script.
When the social climbing hero
(Montgomery Clift), in love with
a beautiful rich girl (Elizabeth
Taylor), takes his pregnant fian
cee out for a row on the lake, he
intends to drown her, but the
boat capsizes and she drowns
without his help; in court, he is
judged guilty because he didn't
try to save her life. Puzzling or
not, however, it's a very powerful
film, and if you saw it as a teen
ager you'll probably remember
the love scenes between Clift and
Taylor for the rest of your life.
Taylor looks beautiful enough to
drive any man to murder his fian
cee, and she has never given a
more touching performance;
and Clift's portrayal of the trou
bled hero is one of the signal
moments in movies of this era —
it goes a long way toward explain
ing why people went wild over
method acting. Shelley Winters
plays the doomed girl, Raymond

Burr is the D.A., and the startling
black and white photography is
by William C. Mellor.
Plays Thursday with The
Razor's Edge.
Kagemusha the Shadow War
rior (1980) ★
Fox, Redwood City
At 70, Akira Kurosawa pro
duced this epic of Shakespearean
scope about a thief in 16th
century Japan who must act as
the double of a warlord. (Tatsuya
Nakadai plays both roles.)
Kurosawa draws on all the styles
he has embraced in 37 years of
filmmaking: in subject matter,
the movie takes him back to his
samurai pictures, but the battle
scenes, magnificent as they are,
are enriched with the humanism
that has emerged in his work
since the mid-'6os. They seem
like immense and tragic canvas
ses that David or Delacroix might
have painted.
Plays Wednesday.
Little Women (1933) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
George Cukor filmed Louisa
May Alcott's story the same year
he made Dinner at Eight, and
though it has been given pther
productions on film and televi
sion, this is easily the best. It is a
terrific example of how good the

Hollywood studio system could
be: what used to be called the
"production values" (i.e., art
direction and costumes) are exe
cuted with great care, the narra
tive is reassuringly strong, and
the cast (except for insipid lean
Parker as Beth) works together
beautifully. Joan Bennett is Amy,
Frances Dee is Meg, Spring
Byington is Marmee, Edna May
Oliver is Aunt March, Douglass
Montgomery is Laurie, Paul
Lukas is Professor Baer, Henry
Stephenson is Mr. Laurence,
and, in only her second year in
movies, Katharine Hepburn plays
Jo. Vou feel that Alcott must have
created Jo fully believingthat one
day an actress just like Hepburn
would come along to play her.
No one else could have brought
such heartbreaking intensity to
the scene in which Jo bemoans
Meg's begin drawn away from

the family into a romance, or
another in which she rejects
Laurie's proposal and then tells
Marmee, "I feel as if I'd stabbed
my best friend." It's a great per
formance, and one of the few
that truly shows a character's as
cension to maturity.
Plays through Wednesday with
Pride and Prejudice.
Arthur (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
Steve Cordon's uneven com
edy, cast in the mold of the
long-extinct Depression comedy
about an improbably rich hero
who falls in love with a pleb. One
may be puzzled by Gordon's

time-warp sensibility, and as the
poor girl, Liza Minelli is an anac
hronism within an anachronism;
she's also too emphatic for such a
small movie. But the scenes be
tween Dudley Moore (in the title
role) and John Cielgud (as his
valet) are worth the price of ad
mission.
