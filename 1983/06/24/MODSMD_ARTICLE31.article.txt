Court strikes down legislative veto
Washington —The Supreme Court, in a decision
bound to change the way congress does business,
struck down on yesterday the "legislative veto" long
used by lawmakers to rein in regulatory agencies and
override the executive branch's control of billions in
taxpayer dollars.
By a 6-3 vote, the court said the veto device is
unconstitutional.
At least temporarily, the decision signals a
momentous shift of clout from the Congress to the
presidency. Deputy press secretary Larry Speakes
said President Reagan was "pleased" at the ruling;
the president's counselor, Edwin Meese 111, agreed
that "it sounds good."
Congress has demanded its own "veto" power, as a
leash attached to some 200 laws, in exchange for
giving executive agencies broad authority over policy
matters. Now, that leash is gone — and Congress is
sure to scramble to reassert some check of executive
rulemaking and decisions which suddenly are not
subject to reversal on Capitol Hill.
Moreover, Congress will have to rewrite all laws
containing legislative veto provisions and likely will
have to be more specific and less generous in doling
out agency authority.
One law that may need a major revamping is the
1973 War Powers Act, which authorizes Congress by a
concurrent resolution to end the use of U.S. armed
forces in hostilities.
At the Justice Department, Attorney General Wil
liam French Smith said he was "most by the Supreme
Court's decision. The long-term effect of this deci
sion will be a better and more effective Congress as
well as a more effective presidency." Smith called the
opinion "strong and compelling" and said it reaf
firmed the constitutional principle of separation of
powers.
Experts say it may take Congress decades before it
fully recovers from the court's ruling.
Congress approves budget
Washington, D.C. —In a stunning rebuff of Presi
dent Reagan's economic policy, the Republican
controlled Senate and the Democratic-run House
yesterday approved a compromise budget plan
strongly denounced by Reagan as too low on military
spending and too high on taxes and domestic spend
ing.
The back-to-back actions, by votes of 239-186 in the
House and 51-43 in the Senate, drewthe battle line for
what is likely to be a long string of veto fights with
Reagan over tax and spending bills needed to imple
ment the budget blueprint.
Reagan's signature is not required on the congres
sional budget resolution itself.
Sen. Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.), senior Democrat on
the Senate Budget Committee, predicted that adop
tion of the budget would strengthen the hand of
those in Congress who seek to override Reagan vet
oes.
"If you don't have budget guidelines to point to,
there is no rationale for opposing a veto. You're just
opposing the president," Chiles said.
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.), who steered the budget resolu
tion around numerous political sharks and shoals,
noted that Reagan retains his veto powers and that
many members of Congress who voted for the
budget may vote differently on individual tax and

appropriations bills.
But, he said, passage of the budget prevented
"chaos . . . larger deficits" because the resolution,
among other things, requires $16 billion in spending
cuts that might not have been made otherwise.
The House adopted the budget — a compromise
resulting from two weeks of Senate-House negotia
tions — on a heavily partisan vote. Only 10 Republi
cans supported the resolution. And only 33 Democ
rats voted against it.
The vote in the Senate was much more bipartisan
and, in fact, the budget might have gone down if
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.)
had not decided at the last minute to go against the
wishes of the Republican occupant of the White
House.
Pope meets with Walesa
Krakow, Poland — Pope )ohn Paul II wound up an
emotional eight-day pilgrimage to his native Poland
yesterday with a private meeting with Lech Walesa,
leader of the outlawed Solidarity trade union, and a
conciliatory gesture to the country's Communist au
thorities.
The long-awaited meeting with Walesa took place
late yesterday morning near the holiday resort town
of Zakopane in the foothills of the high Tatra Moun
tains, where the pope like to hike and climb as a
youth. Vatican spokesman Romeo Panciroli told re
porters that Walesa had been accompanied by his
wife, Danuta, and four of their seven children.
The only previous meeting between the two men
took place in Rome in January 1981, when the pontiff
granted an audience to a Solidarity delegation 11
months before the imposition of martial law in Po
land. During a speech earlier this week, the pope
pointedly referred to this encounter, saying that the
Solidarity delegation had been accompanied by a
Polish diplomat. He also made clear that he supports
the ideals of the labor movement that Walesa led.
At the farewell ceremony at the Krakow airport, the
pope appeared eager to lessen the friction his visit
has created with Poland's military authorities. He
chatted amicably with Poland's titular head of state,
Henryk Jablonski, and used soothing, non
controversial language in his final address.
Another welcome gesture, from the government's
point of view, was the unscheduled meeting last
night between the pope and Poland's military leader,
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, in Krakow's royal Wavel
Castle. At a press conference in Warsaw yesterday,
government spokesman Jerzy Urban said that the
meeting, which lasted an hour and 37 minutes, could
be regarded as "an indirect response to various
speculations" and "evidence of the interest of these
two leaders in pursuing a direct dialogue."
Reagan urges Polish gov't restraint
Chicago— President Reagan called on Polish leader
Wojciech Jaruzelski yesterday to translate the gov
ernment restraint shown during the visit of Pope John
Paul 11 "into a willingness to move toward reconcilia
tion" with the Polish people.
"As I've said before, if the Polish government will
honor the (previous) commitments it has made to
basic human rights, we in America will gladly do our
share to help the shattered Polish economy just as we
helped the countries of Europe after both world
wars," Reagan said during an appearance outside a
Polish National Alliance Hall.

Kennedy tapes made public
Boston —During the bloody integration crisis at the
University of Mississippi 21 years ago, President John
F. Kennedy discussed arresting both Gov. Ross Bar
nett and Edwin Walker, a retired Army general turned
segregation leader.
These were among the new disclosures about the
Kennedy years made public here yesterday with the
release of a fragment of secret White House tape
recordings the thirty-fifth president had ordered dur
ing the last 16 months of his term. The president
himself decided when to make the recordings by
activating a switch at his desk.
The Kennedy tapes, the first presidential re
cordings ever put on sale to the public, were eagerly
awaited by a horde of reporters and cameramen who
gathered outside the Kennedy Library at Columbia
Point overlooking the Atlantic early yesterday morn
ing.
Heightened expectations notwithstanding, the un
expurgated tapes contain no great revelations. But
they do provide a fascinating glimpse of major Ken
nedy administration figures grappling with the prob
lems of a generation ago.
The John Kennedy that emerges from them is a
figure strongly in command, assured, at times pro
fane, given to flashes of whimsy, concerned about
political appearances and press play, and surrounded
by advisers who continually break moments of ten
sion by telling political and personal jokes. The tapes
may not add significant information to the Kennedy
presidential record, but they are certain to provide
scholars with greater insight into his performance.
The question of making arrest during the struggle
over admitting James Meredth, a black student, to
the University of Mississippi first came from Ken
nedy's brother Robert, then attorney general.
"Gen. Walker's been out there downtown getting
them, uh, people, stirred up," Robert Kennedy said
to key administration leaders, including the presi
dent, gathered in the White House command center
during the riots in Oxford, Miss., that left two dead
and hundreds wounded. "Can we get, arrange to get
him arrested?"
When President Kennedy asked, "What's his
crime?," his brother replied: "Uh, he's been stirring
up people."
Later President Kennedy brought up the question
of arrests in a phone conversation with Archibald
Cox, the U.S. Solicitor General who was to be fired as
special prosecutor during the Nixon Watergate crisis.
"For example we wanna arrest Gen. Walker," the
president told Cox, "and I don't know whether we
just arrest him under disturbing the peace or whether
we arrest him for more than that."
He also asked Cox: "I wonder if we can get, uh,
more precise information on where we are legally on
arresting people, including the governor if necessary
and others?"
This material was among four volumes of trans
cripts and 11 cassettes made from the original White
House tapes. Three of the volumes deal with a subject
still in the news — the 1962-63 tax cut that is often
cited by President Reagan as an inspiration for his
own tax cut plans to spur the economy. The fourth
volume, by far the richest historically, deals with the
integration struggle at Oxford, Miss., in late Septem
ber and early October 1962.
