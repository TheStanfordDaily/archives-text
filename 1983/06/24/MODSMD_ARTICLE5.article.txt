# Robin receives $900,000 grant
## 
### LILLIAN SOOHOO 
The National Institute of
Health had awarded a training
grant renewal of approximately
$900,000 to Dr. Eugene Robin,
Firofessor of medicine and phi
osophy at the School of
Medicine.
The grant, to be used over a
five-year period, will allow an
expansion of the medical
school's pulmonary training
program which Robin has over
seen for several years.
Robin attributes the grant re

newal to the program's previous
training and its promise for in
creasing the number of physi
cians entering academia and
biomedical reasearch.
"The progressive decline of
M.D. academicians is a widely
recognized, national problem,"
Robin said. "By getting medical
students into the pulmonary
training program at an early
stage and exposing them to the
rewards in research and schol
arly life, perhaps more will
choose research for their

careers."
Robin suggests some possible
reasons for the decline in the
number of young physicians
pursuing careers in research.
"There are changing values
which view the independence of
a clinician's life as happier than
the stresses of academic life," he
said. "A career in research is
very demanding. Economic fac
tors probably play a role, too."
Revisions in the program, now
made possible by the grant, in-
volve the development of a new
form of training for medical stu
dents which combines research
with students' clinical training.
Robins claims that this sort of
training is "particularly perti
nent at a place like Stanford
which—with its remarkable
academic resources —is
equipped to be in the forefront
of research and teaching."

Since there is a decline in the
need for for Stanford to train
pulmonary clinical specialists, of
whom there is already an abun
dance, the goal of the pulmo
nary training program is to have
100 percent of the trainees enter
academic life, Robin said.
"The idea is to use our new
training program as a model for
responding to a national prob
lem," Robin added. "It may rep
resent the type of innovative
role that academic medical cen
ters can assume in training the
scientists of the future."
