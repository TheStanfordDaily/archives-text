## Reagan claims rapid economic growth 
### Associated Press 
Washington—The govern
ment said Tuesday that eco
nomic growth is spurting at an
annual pace of 6.6 percent in
the current quarter, the fastest
clip since the pre-recession
peak two years ago. President
Reagan declared "our. . .game
plan is working. All economic
signs point to a strong re
covery."
Commerce Secretary Mal
colm Baldrige agreed that his
department's interim "flash es
timate" of the gross national
product for the April-June
period "vividly demonstrates
the economy is rebounding
strongly."
But Reagan's chief
economist, Martin Feldstein,
cautioned that there is "about
one chance in three" that huge
federal deficits could keep
interest rates high or even
nudgethem higher, prompting
the recovery " to falter next
year or decline to an unaccept
ably slow pace."
Baldrige said a major con
tributor to the department's
projection are businesses
which, after sharply reducing
inventories late in the reces
sion, are expected to post only
a "small net liquidation" this
quarter.
Other preliminary figures
point to "the consumer as a
star performer" in the recover,
he said in testimony before the
Joint Economic Committee. He
noted that consumers have
been buying more as their in
come rises and unemployemnt
,f»as edged downward, it ever

so slightly.
Jerry Jasinowski, chief
economist of the National As
sociation of Manufacturers,
agreed, saying the report
shows "we are entering a
period of rapid economic
growth based on inventory re
building and a strong pickup in
consumer spending."
The administration has offi
cially predicted real CNP
growth of 4.7 percent from the
fourth quarter of last year to
the fourth quarter of this year.
That would be less than the
average of 6 percent to 7 per
cent in the first year following
other recessions in the past
several decades.
But Feldstein, who is to
compile the mid-year revision
due out next month, said "it
wouldn't be surprising" if the
year's growth is greater than
4.7 percent.
Baldrige said it may exceed 5
percent. And Beryl Sprinkel,
Treasury undersecretary for
monetary affairs, said it "may
come closer to 6 percent than
to 4.7 percent."
Administration officials said
at the time that that big gain
was not realistic and that worse
times were coming.
Real, or inflation adjusted,
CNP declined 0.4 percent in
1980, which was another reces
sion year, then rose 1.9 percent
in 1981 and declined 1.7 per
cent last year.
