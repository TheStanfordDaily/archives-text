Tegucigalpa, Honduras—A
leader of the anti-Sandinista re
bels, whose campaign has in
flamed the Honduran-
Nicaraguan border, predicts the
Nicaraguan economy will be de
stroyed and the Managua gov
ernment forced into negotia
tions by the end of the year.
"Our guerrilla war has been
very effective," Edgar Chamorro
Coronel said in a recent inter
view in this mountain capital. "If
things go well, the insurrection
will be in full swing by Decem
ber."
Chamorro, a graying 52-year
old former university professor,
is one of seven directors of the
Nicaraguan Democratic Force,
known by its Spanish initials as
the FDN. He said the FDN has

7000 fighters in northern
Nicaragua while Misura, an or
ganization of Miskito, Sumo and
Rama Indians, has 3000 to 4000
guerrillas fighting in the Carib
bean coast region.
Nicaraguan government ac
cuses Honduras and the United
States of aiding the FDN, which
it says uses Honduran territory
to stage raids across the border.
Both Nicaragua and Honduras
have increased their military
strength along the border.
Two American journalists—
Dial Togerson of the Los Angeles
Times and free-lance photo
grapher Richard Cross—died
Tuesday in an artillery attack
near Cifuentes, Honduras, 75
miles east of the capital. Hon
, duras blamed the attack on the
Nicaraguan army.

The Sandinista government
has not disclosed how much
money it is spending to fight the
rebels, although the cost has
been high.
The only military man among
the seven FDN leaders is Enrique
Bermudez, a former national
guard colonel who is leading the
guerilla campaign inside
Nicaragua.
He acknowledges the partici
pation of fewer than 300 former
members of Somoza's National
Guard among the FDN and ad
mits most are in command posi
tions.
But he denies the Sandinista
charge that the group is con
trolled by right-wing former
guard members seeking to re
store a Somoza-style dictator
ship.
