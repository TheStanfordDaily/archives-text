## British conservatives outline programs 
### Washington Post 
London — Britain's newly
elected Conservative govern
ment unveiled its legislative
agenda Wednesday, pledging
stringent curbs on the authority
of trade unions and municipal
governments that have long
provided powerful support for
the opposition Labor Party.
In the traditional state open
ing of Parliament, Queen
Elizabeth read an address pre
pared by Prime Minister Mar
garet Thatcher. With its over
whelming majority in the new
House of Commons, the gov
ernment is assured of getting
most, if not all, of its program
adopted.
The speech reaffirmed the To
ries' intention to continue sell
ing nationalized industries and
maintain an economic strategy
designed to keep inflation low
while beginning to tackle the
country's high unemployment.
These measures are a continua
tion of Thatcher's first-term
policies, and she said Wednes
day that no radical departures
should be expected in the years
ahead.
The queen's speech reflected
Thatcher's increased determina
tion to reduce the sway of
unions and eliminate the met
ropolitan councils, which are
controlled by Labor.
These are moves ostensibly to
increase members' influence on
union leadership and to save
public funds by abolishing a
layer of government. Nonethe
less, they would deal another
major blow to Labor's national

influence.
The union proposals would
give members the right to insist
on one-man-one-vote secret bal
lots in leadership contests. They
would remove legal protection
from unions that strike without
"fair" soundingsof rank-and-file
sentiment and they would pro
vide for regular reviews of the
mandatory contributions for
political funds, which provide a
major portion of Labor's operat
ing and campaign budgets.
The measures were de -
nounced by union spokesmen.
Miners' leader Arthur Scargill
threatened that "extrapar
liamentary action" would be
taken if the legislation is
adopted—meaning strikes and
other protests. However, the re
sults of this month's national
elections and recent votes in
many unions, including the
miners, indicate there is consid
erable public backing for re
forms along Thatcher's lines.
The abolition of metropolitan
councils may be more difficult.
These include the Greater Lon
don Council and six others in
Britain's larger cities. Although
controlled by Labor, the coun
cils also have members who are
Conservatives or from the cen
trist alliance of Liberals and So
cial Democrats.
The Conservative leader of the
Greater London Council has
criticized his party's proposals,
warning of the consequences of
putting 26,000 municipal em
ployees out of work. Anticipat
ing such reaction, the govern

ment said in Wednesday's
speech that a London transport
authority would be created to
pick up many of the council's
functions.
For the most part, the legisla
tion unveiled Wednesday had

been tipped in advance. Plans
for selling such major enter
prises as British Telecom, the
country's telecommunications
company, were under way when
Thatcher dissolved Parliament in
May and called an election.

On foreign policy, the speech
underscored Conservative sup
port for Reagan administration
nuclear arms proposals and
pledged to go ahead with plans
to buy U.S.-made submarine
launched Trident missiles.
