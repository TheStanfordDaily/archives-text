# Alumnus held after threats to Kennedy
## 
### ALAN TRIPP 
A Stanford graduate wanted
for making "veiled threats"
against University President
Donald Kennedy was ap
prehended late Friday afternoon
at the offices of The Stanford
Daily.
Kevin King, 36, had been living
on campus in his car since early
June, and was working on his
first story for the summer Daily
when three police officers en
tered the office, identified
themselves to Daily editors,
handcuffed King and took him to
Valley Medical Center.
Sergeant Kristen Simpson,
one of the apprehending offic
ers, said the apprehension was
not an arrest but a civil process
under the California Welfare
and Institution Code. She said
that under this code, "a person
deemed a threat to himself or
others" can be put under 72-
hour psychiatric observation
without an arrest being made.
Authorities decided yesterday
that King would be held for an
additional 14-day evaluation
period. "If at the end of 72 hours
they need to look at him some
more, they can," Niemeyersaid.
"And that's what they're going
to do."
Two years ago in New York,
King was convicted of harrassing
Caroline Kennedy with obscene
marriage proposals. "He's appa
rently pretty disturbed and he's
got these fixations on celeb
rities," Stanford Police Captain

Raoul Niemeyer said.
"He seems pretty docile but a
lot people — (John) Hinckley,
Sarah Jane Moore — never
exhibit any overt violent ten
dencies and then they just blow
up one day," Niemeyer said.
King was unarmed.
Campus police first learned of
King's recent activities in a re
port from the president's office
June 13, Simpson said. The re
port said King had exhibited
"strange behavior" and made
unusual demands.
"He wanted to get together
with Donald Kennedy to meet
with him cm moine-world issues.
And he wanted to have access to
Caroline Kennedy's telephone
number," Niemeyer said.
"We get letters from all over
the world from people who are
apparently unstable. I get re
ports of from 20 to 30 letters a
month. But when you go into the
background of the individual
and find that he has already been
convicted for doing things then

you have to take note," he said.
It wasn't until acquaintances
of King warned the police that he
had made "veiled threats" to
harm Kennedy that an all points
bulletin was issued Friday morn
ing. Police found King in the
Daily offices where he was work
ing on his first assignment, an
article about a new theater in
Palo Alto.
In a previous issue of the
paper found in the Daily office,
King had written the words Les
culprits (The Culprits) next to a
picture of Kennedy and com
mencement speaker Secretary
of State George Shultz. On
another picture, King had cir
cled in red a name tag Kennedy
was wearing and altered the pic
ture's caption to include
obscenities.
King, a graduate of Hastings
College of Law, had also circled,
underlined and numbered sev
eral Daily advertisements an
nouncing openings for summer
reporters.
