## Vitamin A used in new cancer therapy at Med Center 
### PHYLLIS BURTON 
New research on the treat
ment of cancer—this time using
a vitamin A derivative to fight an
early stage of leukemia—is now
underway at the Stanford Uni
versity Medical Center.
The study involves the use of
isotretinoin, a vitamin A deriva
tive, as a treatment for "pre
leukemia." More a set of
symptoms than an actual dis
ease, "pre-leukemia" is charac
terized by the abnormal forma
tion of blood cells in the bone
marrow, which results in ab
normal blood cells in the blood.
The condition is dangerous
because of both the increased
risk of serious infections due to a
decreased number of white

blood cells and bleeding due to
a decreased numberof platelets.
Because of a smaller number of
red blood cells, anemia is also
present.
In addition, the disease may
evolve into leukemia in some pa
tients. At present, there is usu
ally no effective therapy for this
disease except supportive
blood transfusions.
According to Peter Green
berg, associate professor of
medicine and hematology, the
biggest benefit of isotretinoin is
that it is a natural substance with
few known side effects.
"This has been an easy pro
tocol to work with," Greenberg
said. "There is very mild toxicity
and the risk to benefit ratio is

good. Potential patients accept it
well."
The protocol, or research
plan, specifies an eight week
period during which the "pre
leukemia" patient takes isotreti
noin in pill form. Throughout
the eight weeks, doctors check
the patient's blood weekly and
finally, at the end of the period,
examine the bone marrow.
If the patient does not re
spond to the isotretinoin
treatment —Treatment A—he is
given Treatment B, which con
sists of 28 days of the drug
cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C).
ARA-C, a well-known anti
leukemia drug is given in much
smaller doses that those give for
acute leukemia and therefore has

minimal side effects.
Greenberg and his associates
in the study, Vince Picozzi and
Grant Swanson, both fellows in
hematology at Stanford, feel that
their study has particular merit
because medical science pre
sently has nothing else to offer
patients with the pre-leukemic
syndrome, which they call
"smoldering myeloid leukemic
states" (SMLS).
Because SMLS progresses to
acute myelogenous leukemia in
as many as 40 percent of patients
who have it, Picozzi said it is dif
ficult to tell these patients that
there is currently no treatment.
"It is discouraging to tell them
there is no treatment. At least

now we can tell them that there
is a possiblity of hope," he said
at a recent hematology confer
ence at the Medical Center.
Both isotretinoin and ARA-C
have been shown to be able to
induce the maturity of the imma
ture leukemic cells and to keep
them from proliferating further
in their abnormal state.
The study at Stanford is a pilot
study in the nation. A similar ef
fort is underway at the Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Research
Center in New York.
Greenberg said that this part
of the study should last approx
imately two years and involve
about 35 to 40 patients. Ten pa
tients are now participating in
the three-month-old study.
