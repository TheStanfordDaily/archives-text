# Bill prohibits use of pound animals for experimentation in laboratory
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
Despite heavy lobbying by ftie Stanford Univer
sity Medical Center and other research institu
tions, the state Senate Wednesday approved a bill
that would prohibit the use of pound animals in
biomedical research.
The legislation—Senate Bill 883, sponsored by
Senate President David Roberti (D-Los
Angeles)—now goes to the Assembly. It passed
the Senate by a vote of 21-11.
The measure does not completely prohibit the
use of animals in research. It merely forbids
pounds and shelters to release unclaimed animals
to medical researchers.
If the bill passes the Assembly, scientists would
be forced to procure animals bred especially for
experimentation.
Proponents of the bill claim the legislation
means that former pets will not have to suffer the
horrors of laboratory experimentation.
Opponents say, however, that the bill will actu
ally result in the death of more animals. Pounds

will continue to euthanize unwanted animals
needlessly, while researchers will breed other
animals solely for experimentation.
Roberti sponsored a similar bill last year. It too
was passed by the Senate, but it failed to pass in
the Assembly on the final date of the legislative
session.
The Medical Center plans to continue lobbying
against the bill.
"Certainly Stanford is against this bill srongly,"
said James Dewson, director of laboratory animal
medicine. The measure has "effects way beyond
the per-unit cost of animals," Dewson said.
While the Medical Center is opposing the
Roberti bill, it is supporting alternative legislation.
This measure—the Pet Identification and Protec
tion Act—would give individuals turning in an
animal the option of refusing to permit the pound
to sell the animal to researchers. It would also set
standards of humane treatment for research in
stitutions and establish a statewide identification
system to help owners locate their lost animals.
