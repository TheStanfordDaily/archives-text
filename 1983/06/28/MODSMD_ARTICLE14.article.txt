# Coffee House management seeks increase in use
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
As contract renewal talks between Tre
sidder and the Coffee House conclude
this week, all involved agree that the top
priorities are to decrease the deficit and
to increase customer accounts.
With new manager Gary Verzani, the
contractor (Tresidder), the Coffee House
Board and the actual employees will be
implementing slow but steady changes in
order to eventually pay off the debt and to
get more people to use the Coffee
House.
"Paying off our debts and increasing
customer accounts are what we have to
do," Vinnie Freda, acting president of the
board of directors, said. "Our goals are to
make the Coffee House a unique eating
place, and we would like to keep it low
cost."
The negotiations with Tresidder pro
vide an opportunity to review general go
als, said Nanci Howe, assistant director of
Tresidder Union. The Coffee House pays
rent to Tresidder in the form of a percen
tage of gross sales. As a contractor, then,
Tresidder does not run the Coffee House.
"We can identify the problems or suc
cess. The Coffee House management
uses us as (a) resource, although we can
alter the expense side," Howe said.
According to Howe, all Tresidder food
services lose money because there are
restrictions on price, and the space is not

simply a dining area but also serves for
lounging. Tresidder provides utilities,
custodians, remodelling, capital equip
ment, programming and general market
ing support. While their concern is par
tially with service and providing quality,
Howe said the financial losses of the Cof
fee House and a 15 percent decline in
customers is a substantial cause for
worry.
In February a survey showed that the
Coffee House was the second most popu
lar Tresidder facility. "There was still that
decline. . . do people still like the Coffee
House and still come, but not everyday?
Do they just buy less? I don't know," she
said.
To tackle the organizational situation,
Freda made up a chart which outlines the
management structure and wrote up
explicit job descriptions for everyone
from board members to bookkeepers.
The new manager, formerly of
Stockton, comes to the Coffee House
with much experience in food service,
including some time at UC-Berkeley.
There is now a formalized meeting
schedule which brings all members into
contact regularly. In the first of his regular
staff meetings, Verzani said he would
"listen to everything and try a lot." He
hopes to nominate an assistant manager
this week, and to bring back a newsletter
to employees which was previously in

eluded with their paychecks.
Despite the deficit, the Coffee House
has actually been making a profit the past
four months. Verzani attributes the im
provement to a new, more efficient pric
ing system, as well as to a reduction of the
staff. "But we have to make up that
money (debt) in the next two years," he
said. There are two more years of renewal
to the lease before the contract must be
renegotiated.
On a more long term basis, Verzani
wants to streamline the menu. He intends
to return to the old Coffee House system
of ordering an a la carte sandwich and
watching it be made on one side of the
counter.

On the other side, he wants to sell ex
press, pre-made sandwiches so that the
Coffee House will appeal to those who
wish to sit and eat slowly, as well as those
who like the food but must eat on the run.
These changes are likely to be im
plemented in August, a slow month, so
that the new programs can be im
plemented smoothly. For now, getting
more customers is the primary goal. Staff
member Doug Spalding, who has worked
part-time at the Coffee House for two and
a half is wary of more changes.
With the transient nature of the
employee pool, he said, there need to be
"some sort of stability and working things
out through time."
