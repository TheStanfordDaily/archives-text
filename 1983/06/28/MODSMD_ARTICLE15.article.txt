## Sting and Synchronicity: a message without hype 
### TIM GRIEVE 
Don't be fooled by the title.
When the Police chose lung's
term "Synchronicity" for the
title of the band's latest album,
the band did not succumb to the
pretension that most bands
with-a-message usually adopt.
Rather, the Police continue to
put out meaningful, but catchy,
tunes without the oh-God-this
is-so-deep mentality in which
bands like Rush and Yes wallow

or the hey-look-at-us-we're
being-political attitude of the
Clash.
Synchronicity isn't an effort to
find God, stop nuclear weapons,
get the United States out of El
Salvador, end world hunger or
overthrow Reagan. Sting, the
band's bassist snd primary
songwriter and vocalist, has said
in the past that the world's prob
lems are too complex to solve in
the two-minute-and-58-second

pop song.
What the Police do in those
two minutes and 58 seconds,
though, is pack a head-on blast
of painful emotions. Political,
no. Personal, yes.
Sting has latched on to the
sadness that hurts all of us: the
loneliness of being on the out
side looking in, the pain of an
unrequited love.
The deceptively simple single

"Every Breath You Take" is a perfect example. In even
more haunting lyrics than those of Ghost in the
Machine's "Every Little Thing She Does is Magic," Sting
captures all the pain of the unrequited love. "Every
breath you take, every move you make, every bond you
break, every step you take, I'll be watching you."
But Sting's sly humor shows through, too. On Syn
chronicity we have "a blind man looking for a shadow of
doubt" and children having "to shout above the din of
our rice crispies."
While the lyrics throughout Synchronicity are pure
Police, the music is not. Gone for the most part is
Stewart Copeland's frenetic slap-back reggae influ
enced drumming. Instead, on cuts like "Every Breath
You Take," we find Copeland beating it out on the two
and four beats, nothing that every heavy metal garage
band doesn't do.
But that's the problem with all the music (as opposed
to the lyrics) on this album. It's fine work, but I'm not so
sure it took a band with the incredible musical talent of
the Police to make it.
Sting, Copeland and guitarist Andy Summers say that
Synchronicity is a "back to basics" album for the band.
But we've come to expect more than "the basics" from
this band, and even the Police's "basics" — "So Lonely,
"Roxanne" — less basic than "Every Breath You Take."
This isn't to say that Synchronicity isn't a fine album —
it's certainly one of the best this year. It's just not a great
album for the Police.
