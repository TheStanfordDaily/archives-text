# Stanford at the Magic: ridiculous 'Sling'
## 
### MIKE HALE 
(Editors note: Due to a printing
error, the review of Singapore
Sling at the Magic Theatre that
ran in last Friday's Daily was illeg
ible in most issues of the paper.
Here is the review, reprinted in
full.)

The American premiere of
Wolfgang Bauer's Singapore
Sling at the Magic Theatre in San
Francisco looks like a Stanford
Drama Department summer
workshop: the translation is by
Prof. Martin Esslin, the produc
tion is directed by fellow faculty
member Geoffrey Reeves, and
the cast includes Stanford actors
Anthony Haney and Maurice
Rehm. That's a formidable
gathering of talent—Haney and
Rehm have given some of the
best performances seen on
campus recent years—but it's
not enough to rescue a play that
never should have left its native

Austria.
In a program note, Esslin calls
Singapore Sling a "post
modern, post-absurdist play."
It's hard to say, though, what's
new and different about the
play. It has a gimmick—three
couples coexist in the same
room of Singapore's Raffles
Hotel, each unaware of the
others' presence but aware that
something funny is going on.
After a day and a night and a day
in the room (the entire play is set
there) during which the couples
gradually become more fright
ened (of what, I'm not sure) and
more certain that they're not
alone, Vincent (Van Gogh) and
Paul (Gauguin) walk in with
easels and a model. Vincent
does away with "linear time"
and suddenly everyone can see
everyone else. Then the lights
go out and there's a grand,
apocalyptic finish (the play's
best moment) involving God
and a giant marabou bird.

It's even harder to say what
the point of all this is. The play
raises Big Issues—dreams vs. re
ality, art vs. life, America vs. the
rest of the world—but treats
them in an offhand, elliptical,
manner without building up to
anything; the play's frenetic
finish suggests that Bauer, after
trifling with his ideas for two
hours, realized he needed a
boffo finish to disguise the fact
that the play isn't really about
anything.
This wouldn't matter if the
play were consistantly funny
(which it isn't) or if it put before
us, as Esslin claims it does,
"haunting, poetic, grotesquely
comic" images. There are some
moments that qualify as grotes
quely comic, but (in this transla
tion and production, at least) not
much poetry. What we mostly
get are nudity and sex—at one
point, all three couples copulate
on the same bed at the same
time—presumably because, as

everyone knows, Americans are
obsessed with these things. We
also get a lot of maundering, un
dergraduate philosophy (at its
worst in an embarrassing soli
loquy delivered late in the play
by Van Gogh) and crude
American-bashing (which might
have been Euro-bashing before
translation). It's impossible to
tell to what degree the play's in
tent is satirical—when you most
hope that something isn't seri
ous, it turns out to be dreadfully
so.
Geoffrey Reeves has done ev
erything he can for this play—l
was constantly diverted by the
production at the same time as I
was maddened by what was
being said and done. He makes
the most of those things that will
seem funny to an American audi
ence, and manages the choreog
raphy of the three blind couples
well. The actors have a harder
time of it—l don't think any of
them had much of an idea of

what Bauer was getting at,
either, and their performances
are based on poses and running
gags. Haney, who was wonder
ful as Silenus, the satyr-in-chief,
in the campus production of
Rehm's Cyclops last winter, has
the hardest time of it. He plays
Tristan, a young American writer
visiting Singapore with his
girlfriend; in theoriginal,Tristan
is Austrian, and in translation the
character has become a howling
cliche, a "beat" who hops out of
bed during sex to write down his
inspirations. His Isolde
(Isabella), Nancy Kemp, has
great presence but not much to
dootherthan takeoff and put on
her clothes. Most of the rest of
the cast is ridiculous in ridicul
ous roles; Gerald Ambinder, as
an aging American tourist of the
worst kind, brings an impressive
gruffness to his role but is forced
to spend most of the second half
of the play complaining of
diarrhea.

the most of those things that will
seem funny to an American audi
ence, and manages the choreog
raphy of the three blind couples
well. The actors have a harder
time of it—l don't think any of
them had much of an idea of

what Bauer was getting at,
either, and their performances
are based on poses and running
gags. Haney, who was wonder
ful as Silenus, the satyr-in-chief,
in the campus production of
Rehm's Cyclops last winter, has
the hardest time of it. He plays
Tristan, a young American writer
visiting Singapore with his
girlfriend; in theoriginal,Tristan
is Austrian, and in translation the
character has become a howling
cliche, a "beat" who hops out of
bed during sex to write down his
inspirations. His Isolde
(Isabella), Nancy Kemp, has
great presence but not much to
dootherthan takeoff and put on
her clothes. Most of the rest of
the cast is ridiculous in ridicul
ous roles; Gerald Ambinder, as
an aging American tourist of the
worst kind, brings an impressive
gruffness to his role but is forced
to spend most of the second half
of the play complaining of
diarrhea.

Here is the review, reprinted in
full.)

The American premiere of
Wolfgang Bauer's Singapore
Sling at the Magic Theatre in San
Francisco looks like a Stanford
Drama Department summer
workshop: the translation is by
Prof. Martin Esslin, the produc
tion is directed by fellow faculty
member Geoffrey Reeves, and
the cast includes Stanford actors
Anthony Haney and Maurice
Rehm. That's a formidable
gathering of talent—Haney and
Rehm have given some of the
best performances seen on
campus recent years—but it's
not enough to rescue a play that
never should have left its native

Austria.
In a program note, Esslin calls
Singapore Sling a "post
modern, post-absurdist play."
It's hard to say, though, what's
new and different about the
play. It has a gimmick—three
couples coexist in the same
room of Singapore's Raffles
Hotel, each unaware of the
others' presence but aware that
something funny is going on.
After a day and a night and a day
in the room (the entire play is set
there) during which the couples
gradually become more fright
ened (of what, I'm not sure) and
more certain that they're not
alone, Vincent (Van Gogh) and
Paul (Gauguin) walk in with
easels and a model. Vincent
does away with "linear time"
and suddenly everyone can see
everyone else. Then the lights
go out and there's a grand,
apocalyptic finish (the play's
best moment) involving God
and a giant marabou bird.

It's even harder to say what
the point of all this is. The play
raises Big Issues—dreams vs. re
ality, art vs. life, America vs. the
rest of the world—but treats
them in an offhand, elliptical,
manner without building up to
anything; the play's frenetic
finish suggests that Bauer, after
trifling with his ideas for two
hours, realized he needed a
boffo finish to disguise the fact
that the play isn't really about
anything.
This wouldn't matter if the
play were consistantly funny
(which it isn't) or if it put before
us, as Esslin claims it does,
"haunting, poetic, grotesquely
comic" images. There are some
moments that qualify as grotes
quely comic, but (in this transla
tion and production, at least) not
much poetry. What we mostly
get are nudity and sex—at one
point, all three couples copulate
on the same bed at the same
time—presumably because, as

everyone knows, Americans are
obsessed with these things. We
also get a lot of maundering, un
dergraduate philosophy (at its
worst in an embarrassing soli
loquy delivered late in the play
by Van Gogh) and crude
American-bashing (which might
have been Euro-bashing before
translation). It's impossible to
tell to what degree the play's in
tent is satirical—when you most
hope that something isn't seri
ous, it turns out to be dreadfully
so.
Geoffrey Reeves has done ev
erything he can for this play—l
was constantly diverted by the
production at the same time as I
was maddened by what was
being said and done. He makes
the most of those things that will
seem funny to an American audi
ence, and manages the choreog
raphy of the three blind couples
well. The actors have a harder
time of it—l don't think any of
them had much of an idea of

what Bauer was getting at,
either, and their performances
are based on poses and running
gags. Haney, who was wonder
ful as Silenus, the satyr-in-chief,
