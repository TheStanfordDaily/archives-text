# Eddy and Cooder, or Cooder and Eddy
## 
### DANIEL LERNER 
I went to see Ry Cooder intricately pick his guitar on
Thursday night and left convinced that rock and roll will
never die. The man who persuaded me was a 45-year-old
pedal steel guitar player named Duane Eddy. Who is
Duane Eddy?
Ry Cooder is certainly a more familiar rock personage.
His intricate, yet restrained, electric guitar work has
established him as a fine solo performer, but more im
portantly as an uncompromising session musician. He

has recorded with bands from al! wavelengths on the
rock spectrum: Maria Muldaur, Eric Clapton and as the
magical link on the Rolling Stones' two greatest works,
Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers. So when Ry slides into
town, people listen. But who the hell is Duane Eddy and
why is Ry playing in his band. Ry can play for anybody.
Duane Eddy is an elder statesman of early rock and
roll. His heyday was from 1957-61 when he had hits like
"Forty Miles of Bad Road" and put out albums like
Twang's the Thang." "Twangin' " is a country-rock
guitar style that people like Carl Perkins, Robert Bur
nette and Buddy Holly used to fuse country music and
blues to create something called "rock and roll." Chuck
Berry then borrowed much of this picking style and
combined it with the searing licks of Elmore lames and
his own flair to produce the rock sounds that are still
heard today â€” over and again in different packages.
That was 25 years ago. Comebacks are hard; success
ful ones are rare and as the show drew near my expecta
tions shifted to Cooder's precision fingerwork.
Cooder's solo career is often labelled eclectic; he has
borrowed from Hawaiian, Spanish, gospel and folk
styles and then infused them with a knife-like electric
soul. He is a musician's musician, releasing what he
likes, always to critical but rarely commercial success. I
approached the show thinking that Ry had taken pity on
a has-been from 20 years ago and was paying a charitable
homage to his rock heritage. My youthful skepticism
betrayed me because Thursday's concert was a barn
burner. I have seen many shows at the Keystone, but few
cooked like Thursday's.
Besides Cooder, Eddy is surrounded by a sax player, a
keyboardist and a drummer who were all pre-war babies
. . . World War 11, not Vietnam. Never mind age. Steve
Davis, normally a session sax man and a member of Ry's
recent touring band, is astounding. He chops and chews
out a complement to Cooder's lead guitar work that
makes the Blasters barely look cute. The keyboard
player hops and skips with the drummer and bassist to
nail down a solid twangin' sound that Dave Edmunds has
never honestly achieved.
And Duane Eddy . . . can he play? He sure as hell can.
He is no Ry Cooder antique. He plays his Duane Eddy
autograph model guitar as if he has been playing it
straight through since 1956 without going out for a meal.
He is clear, precise, sincere and hot. His solid guitar lays
the groundwork for the exclusively instrumental show.
Once the beat has been established, he and Cooder go
to town. Taking turns, the new man on the souped up
Takamine and the old man on the pedal steel let loose.

Thursday night they played for each other, not the
capacity crowd, and so the music sounded real, from the
heart, not a recreation of recordings.
Cooder played with the intensity that is his trademark.
With a Moslem skullcap on and the usual tropical shirt
he saw only the band and his guitar. He let go as he rarely
does and played the rock and roll that could make him a
commercial success if he ever decides to record that
way.
I asked Eddy after the show why Cooder was playing
with him on this mini-tour. His eyes sparkled and his soft
voice tendered, "He's a friend of a friend. Isn't he
great?"
