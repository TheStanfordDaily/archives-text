# John Badham's 'War Games': great premise, good movie, lousy ending
## 
### 
'War Games'
War Games starts with a terrific
premise: the potential for global
nuclear war resides in the do
main of computers, which are
gigantic toys, so in effect World
War 111 is an international game.
The hero is a Seattle teenager —
David Lightman (played by the
immensely charming Matthew
Broderick), who is flunking
biology out of a general lack of
interest in academics but is a
whiz at the local arcade and on
his home computer. To curry
favor with the prettiest girl in his
class, Jennifer (Ally Sheedy, the
preppiest of young actresses —
much better cast here than in
Bad Boys), he taps into the
school computerand raises both
their biology grades; she is in
trigued with his talents and
sticks around while he tries to

get the jump on next Christmas'
crop of video games. By an
elaborate (and cleverly worked
out) system, he winds up enter
ing a private computer designed
by a genius named Falken, re
portedly now dead. When the
computer, which he calls Joshua
(the password that allowed him
to enter), invites him to play a
game, David responds gleefully,
and selects a game called Global
Thermonuclear War, choosing
the Soviet Union side and desig
nating Seattle and Las Vegas as
initial missile targets. What
David doesn't know is that
Joshua is housed at NORAD,
where it goes under the name of
the WOPR (War Operations Plan
Research); when David and Jen
nifer set the war game in motion,
the giant screens in the NORAD
war room register missiles ap
proaching the two cities David
has picked to obliterate. And the

administration at NORAD —
General Beringer (Barry Corbin)
and computer expert McKittrick
(Dabney Coleman) — don't
know that the missiles aren't
real.
For more than half the movie
the filmmakers clearly know
exactly what they're doing. The
writers, Lawrence Lasker and
Walter F. Parkes, keep the
dialogue bright, and the script
has a American
edge-of-the-abyss humor that
may remind you of The Manchu
rian Candidate or Blow Out. Wil
liam A. Fraker has shot the pic
ture in an appropriately metallic
mode — the NORAD scenes
seem subterranean, so if you
watch the film in the afternoon
you come out squinting, as if
you'd just been released from
solitary. John Badham, the di
rector, has never been so fleet
footed or in such easy control,

and Tom Rolf's witty editing is
tapered gracefully to the de
mands of the well-structured
narrative. The comic ironies of a
plot that parallels a teenager's
passion for computer games
with the gamesmanship of the
bigwigs at NORAD — such as the
fondness the programmer, Rich
ter (Irving Metzman), has for his
pet, the WOPR — get their
laughs, and Matthew Broderick
gets his, too: he displays the
freshest double takes since
Robert MacNaughton in E.T. The
first half — nearly two-thirds —
of WarCames provides almost
uninterrupted pleasure. Though
one may balk at the way in which
Badham and the screenwriters
pander to the kids in the audi
ence by portraying adults as in
flated boobs whose veneer of
civilization scratches off at the
earliest signs of crisis — Barry
