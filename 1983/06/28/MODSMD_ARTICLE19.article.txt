# John Badham's 'War Games': great premise, good movie, lousy ending
## 
### 
'War Games'
War Games starts with a terrific
premise: the potential for global
nuclear war resides in the do
main of computers, which are
gigantic toys, so in effect World
War 111 is an international game.
The hero is a Seattle teenager —
David Lightman (played by the
immensely charming Matthew
Broderick), who is flunking
biology out of a general lack of
interest in academics but is a
whiz at the local arcade and on
his home computer. To curry
favor with the prettiest girl in his
class, Jennifer (Ally Sheedy, the
preppiest of young actresses —
much better cast here than in
Bad Boys), he taps into the
school computerand raises both
their biology grades; she is in
trigued with his talents and
sticks around while he tries to

get the jump on next Christmas'
crop of video games. By an
elaborate (and cleverly worked
out) system, he winds up enter
ing a private computer designed
by a genius named Falken, re
portedly now dead. When the
computer, which he calls Joshua
(the password that allowed him
to enter), invites him to play a
game, David responds gleefully,
and selects a game called Global
Thermonuclear War, choosing
the Soviet Union side and desig
nating Seattle and Las Vegas as
initial missile targets. What
David doesn't know is that
Joshua is housed at NORAD,
where it goes under the name of
the WOPR (War Operations Plan
Research); when David and Jen
nifer set the war game in motion,
the giant screens in the NORAD
war room register missiles ap
proaching the two cities David
has picked to obliterate. And the

administration at NORAD —
General Beringer (Barry Corbin)
and computer expert McKittrick
(Dabney Coleman) — don't
know that the missiles aren't
real.
For more than half the movie
the filmmakers clearly know
exactly what they're doing. The
writers, Lawrence Lasker and
Walter F. Parkes, keep the
dialogue bright, and the script
has a American
edge-of-the-abyss humor that
may remind you of The Manchu
rian Candidate or Blow Out. Wil
liam A. Fraker has shot the pic
ture in an appropriately metallic
mode — the NORAD scenes
seem subterranean, so if you
watch the film in the afternoon
you come out squinting, as if
you'd just been released from
solitary. John Badham, the di
rector, has never been so fleet
footed or in such easy control,

and Tom Rolf's witty editing is
tapered gracefully to the de
mands of the well-structured
narrative. The comic ironies of a
plot that parallels a teenager's
passion for computer games
with the gamesmanship of the
bigwigs at NORAD — such as the
fondness the programmer, Rich
ter (Irving Metzman), has for his
pet, the WOPR — get their
laughs, and Matthew Broderick
gets his, too: he displays the
freshest double takes since
Robert MacNaughton in E.T. The
first half — nearly two-thirds —
of WarCames provides almost
uninterrupted pleasure. Though
one may balk at the way in which
Badham and the screenwriters
pander to the kids in the audi
ence by portraying adults as in
flated boobs whose veneer of
civilization scratches off at the
earliest signs of crisis — Barry
Corbin's bullnecked fathead
general, a deep south right-wing
parody, is very tiresome — still
the adolescent anarchic pull of
the movie gives it much of its
sneaky appeal.
It's in the second half of the
film that something goes wrong
— not disastrously wrong,
exactly, and not commercially
wrong, either, so perhaps we
shouldn't assume that the
change is accidental. David and
Jennifer, escaping from the FBI,
who assume he is working in
league with foreign agents, track
down Joshua's inventor, Falken
(John Wood) — now retired and
living under a new name — and
the movie deteriorates into fairly
mushheaded pedantry. Falken
has grown so disenchanted with
the world that he refuses at first
to accompany the kids back to
NORAD and make an attempt to
stop Beringer and McKittrick
from beginning a real nuclear
war, so David and Jennifer have
to persuade him that saving hu
manity would be a worthwhile
endeavor. But the major thrust
of these late scenes is Joshua's
insistence on playing the Global
Thermonuclear War game to its
conclusion; in order to arrest
the game, David and Falken
must teach Joshua that it is futile.
At the end of the movie, the
message — Joshua's lesson,
NORAD's lesson, and ours too
— is printed across the war room
screen: "Strange game. The
only winning move is not to
play." But the first half of the
picture offered the same theme
in a far more entertaining man
ner. War Games is disappointing
beyond the midway mark be
cause it slows down to preach at
us at the very moment when its
velocity should double, and be

cause just as it seems pitched at
the point of satire the filmmak
ers slip in a computer-age civics
class. There are still occasional
flashes of wit, the final scene re
versals spring the plot mecha
nism back into operation, and
Badham and Fraker do give us
something else to watch besides
the sage twinkle in John Wood's
eyes.
'Octopussy'
With a remarkably clear story
(by George Macdonald Fraser,
Richard Maibaum and Michael
G. Wilson), a highly varied series
of action sequences — the first
of which draws happv applause
from a first-night audience —
and a grab bag of smiling refer
ences to other adventure movies
and famous literary adventures
as well, Octopussy, directed by
John Glen, is the best James
Bond film since The Spy Who
Loved Me. It never attains The
Spy's luscious self-parodying vi
sual style, though there are a few
ripe kitsch specials, like a galley
rowed entirely by women. As
well as this send-up of Ben-Hur,
you see nods to Kipling and
Dumas and to The Most Danger
ous Came, The African Queen,
Around the World in 80 Days,
North by Northwest, etc. The
plot links a sophisticated jewel
smuggling outfit with the
scheme of a bellicose Soviet
general (playwright-director
Steven Berkoff) to disrupt dis
armament talks by setting off a
bomb. Among the pleasures of
this 13th 007 thriller are Louis
Jourdan as the suave Kamal, the
entirely mercenary villain of the
piece; Vijay Armitraj as Bond's
Indian associate, who gets an in

fectious kick out of his job; Kris
tina Wayborn, who looks like a
high-class Susan Sarandon; and
— unexpectedly — a more
human James Bond from Roger
Moore. Moore still isn't much of
an actor, but he's learned to
communicate the strain of a man
under constant pressure. Glen
and the screenwriters have de
signed the second half of Oc
topussy as more of a Hitchcoc
kian suspense picture than a
standard high-tech Bond — at
one point Bond must hitchhike
to the bomb target and figure
out a way to convince Octopussy
(drab Maud Adams) and others
that there really is a bomb and
that he must be permitted to
dismantle it. This effort to bring
Bond down to earth stirs us to
respond to Moore as we would
to a caught-in-the-middle Hitch
cock hero; it's a very satisfying
shift.

Bad Boys), he taps into the
school computerand raises both
their biology grades; she is in
trigued with his talents and
sticks around while he tries to

get the jump on next Christmas'
crop of video games. By an
elaborate (and cleverly worked
out) system, he winds up enter
ing a private computer designed
by a genius named Falken, re
portedly now dead. When the
computer, which he calls Joshua
(the password that allowed him
to enter), invites him to play a
game, David responds gleefully,
and selects a game called Global
Thermonuclear War, choosing
the Soviet Union side and desig
nating Seattle and Las Vegas as
initial missile targets. What
David doesn't know is that
Joshua is housed at NORAD,
where it goes under the name of
the WOPR (War Operations Plan
Research); when David and Jen
nifer set the war game in motion,
the giant screens in the NORAD
war room register missiles ap
proaching the two cities David
has picked to obliterate. And the

administration at NORAD —
General Beringer (Barry Corbin)
and computer expert McKittrick
(Dabney Coleman) — don't
know that the missiles aren't
real.
For more than half the movie
the filmmakers clearly know
exactly what they're doing. The
writers, Lawrence Lasker and
Walter F. Parkes, keep the
dialogue bright, and the script
has a American
edge-of-the-abyss humor that
may remind you of The Manchu
rian Candidate or Blow Out. Wil
liam A. Fraker has shot the pic
ture in an appropriately metallic
mode — the NORAD scenes
seem subterranean, so if you
watch the film in the afternoon
you come out squinting, as if
you'd just been released from
solitary. John Badham, the di
rector, has never been so fleet
footed or in such easy control,

and Tom Rolf's witty editing is
tapered gracefully to the de
mands of the well-structured
narrative. The comic ironies of a
plot that parallels a teenager's
passion for computer games
with the gamesmanship of the
bigwigs at NORAD — such as the
fondness the programmer, Rich
ter (Irving Metzman), has for his
pet, the WOPR — get their
laughs, and Matthew Broderick
gets his, too: he displays the
freshest double takes since
Robert MacNaughton in E.T. The
first half — nearly two-thirds —
of WarCames provides almost
uninterrupted pleasure. Though
one may balk at the way in which
Badham and the screenwriters
pander to the kids in the audi
ence by portraying adults as in
flated boobs whose veneer of
civilization scratches off at the
earliest signs of crisis — Barry
Corbin's bullnecked fathead
general, a deep south right-wing
parody, is very tiresome — still
the adolescent anarchic pull of
the movie gives it much of its
sneaky appeal.
It's in the second half of the
film that something goes wrong
— not disastrously wrong,
exactly, and not commercially
wrong, either, so perhaps we
shouldn't assume that the
change is accidental. David and
Jennifer, escaping from the FBI,
who assume he is working in
league with foreign agents, track
down Joshua's inventor, Falken
(John Wood) — now retired and
living under a new name — and
the movie deteriorates into fairly
mushheaded pedantry. Falken
has grown so disenchanted with
the world that he refuses at first
to accompany the kids back to
NORAD and make an attempt to
stop Beringer and McKittrick
from beginning a real nuclear
war, so David and Jennifer have
to persuade him that saving hu
manity would be a worthwhile
endeavor. But the major thrust
of these late scenes is Joshua's
insistence on playing the Global
Thermonuclear War game to its
conclusion; in order to arrest
the game, David and Falken
must teach Joshua that it is futile.
At the end of the movie, the
message — Joshua's lesson,
NORAD's lesson, and ours too
— is printed across the war room
screen: "Strange game. The
only winning move is not to
play." But the first half of the
picture offered the same theme
in a far more entertaining man
ner. War Games is disappointing
beyond the midway mark be
cause it slows down to preach at
us at the very moment when its
velocity should double, and be

cause just as it seems pitched at
the point of satire the filmmak
ers slip in a computer-age civics
class. There are still occasional
flashes of wit, the final scene re
versals spring the plot mecha
nism back into operation, and
Badham and Fraker do give us
something else to watch besides
the sage twinkle in John Wood's
eyes.
'Octopussy'
With a remarkably clear story
(by George Macdonald Fraser,

G. Wilson), a highly varied series
of action sequences — the first
of which draws happv applause
from a first-night audience —
and a grab bag of smiling refer
ences to other adventure movies
and famous literary adventures
as well, Octopussy, directed by
John Glen, is the best James
Bond film since The Spy Who
Loved Me. It never attains The
Spy's luscious self-parodying vi
sual style, though there are a few
ripe kitsch specials, like a galley
rowed entirely by women. As
well as this send-up of Ben-Hur,
you see nods to Kipling and
Dumas and to The Most Danger
ous Came, The African Queen,
Around the World in 80 Days,
North by Northwest, etc. The
plot links a sophisticated jewel
smuggling outfit with the
scheme of a bellicose Soviet
general (playwright-director
Steven Berkoff) to disrupt dis
armament talks by setting off a
bomb. Among the pleasures of
this 13th 007 thriller are Louis
Jourdan as the suave Kamal, the
entirely mercenary villain of the
piece; Vijay Armitraj as Bond's
Indian associate, who gets an in

fectious kick out of his job; Kris
tina Wayborn, who looks like a
high-class Susan Sarandon; and
— unexpectedly — a more
human James Bond from Roger
Moore. Moore still isn't much of
an actor, but he's learned to
communicate the strain of a man
under constant pressure. Glen
and the screenwriters have de
signed the second half of Oc
topussy as more of a Hitchcoc
kian suspense picture than a
standard high-tech Bond — at
one point Bond must hitchhike
to the bomb target and figure
out a way to convince Octopussy
(drab Maud Adams) and others
that there really is a bomb and
that he must be permitted to
dismantle it. This effort to bring
Bond down to earth stirs us to
respond to Moore as we would
to a caught-in-the-middle Hitch
cock hero; it's a very satisfying
shift.

'War Games'
War Games starts with a terrific
premise: the potential for global
nuclear war resides in the do
main of computers, which are
gigantic toys, so in effect World
War 111 is an international game.
The hero is a Seattle teenager —
David Lightman (played by the
immensely charming Matthew
Broderick), who is flunking
biology out of a general lack of
interest in academics but is a
whiz at the local arcade and on
his home computer. To curry
favor with the prettiest girl in his
class, Jennifer (Ally Sheedy, the
preppiest of young actresses —
much better cast here than in
Bad Boys), he taps into the
school computerand raises both
their biology grades; she is in
trigued with his talents and
sticks around while he tries to

get the jump on next Christmas'
crop of video games. By an
