# Stanford West proposal cut
## 
### MIKE HALE 
Stanford has agreed to cut 175
units from Stanford West as part
of a compromise designed to
gain initial Palo Alto City Council
approval of the housing project.
The new proposal, worked
out between University and city
staff members, will be presented
to the citv council July 7. It places
no more than 1100 units on the
46-acre site between Willow
Road and San Francisquito
Creek, instead of the originally
proposed 1275. It also calls for
Stanford to spend $2.1 million
on road improvements needed
to handle the additional traffic
the project would generate.
The compromise reduces the
total size of the development
from 1469 units to 1294. The
smaller parcel of land at the
corner of Willow Road and Pas
teur Drive is still slated for 194
units.
The reduction in units will
allow Stanford to decrease the
height and size of some of the
project's buildings. Andrew
Doty, University director of
community relations, said city
officials felt the proposed four
and five-story buildings along
Willow Koad were "too big for
Palo Alto."
Doty said it is likely the city
council will vote for "full and
complete certification" of the
Stanford West environmental
impact report, including the
proposed mitigations, at its July
7 meeting. The report has been
under consideration by Palo Al
to's Planning Commission and
Architectural Review Board

(ARB) since last November, and
the proposed compromise is
largely a response to those
agencies' criticisms.
If the project's overall design
is approved July 7, Stanford will
go back before the Planning
Commission and ARB with
specific project plans. Further
city council review would not be
necessary unless further prob
lems arose.
While compromising on the
issues of project size and traffic
mitigations, the University re
fused to go along with several
other planning .commission re
commendations.
Palo Alto has proposed all
along that Stanford give perma
nent open space guarantees on
other University land (presuma
bly in the Palo Alto foothills) in
return for city approval of Stan
ford West. As in the past, the
University refused to make any
open space commitments. "We
don't want the precedent of
trading open space for city ap
proval," Doty said.
The planning commission had
also asked that additional units
be made affordable to low- and
middle-income families,
through inclusion in Palo Alto's
Below Market Rate (BMR) hous
ing program or other means.
The University refused to in
crease its BMR commitment of
15 percent of the units on the
46-acre site. Because of the re
duction in the project's overall
size, the proposed number of
BMR units has dropped from 192
to 180.
