U.S. Salvadoran embassy hit
San Salvador, El Salvador— The U.S. Embassy was
hit by a burst of machine gun fire from assailants in
two passing cars last night, moments after an exp
losion across the street from the building, the
State Department said.
Witnesses said guards at the embassy appa
rently returned fire.
State Department spokeswoman Carolyn
lohnson, contacted in Washington, said bullet
holes were found in the southwest corner of the
building, but she said there were no reports of
injuries.
She said San Salvador police were investigating
the attack, which occurred at 7:25 p.m. PST.
The embassy is located in a residential district
but is surrounded by fortress-like walls and is
heavily guarded.
Soviets grant exit visas
Moscow — The Soviet government disclosed
Sunday that it has granted exit visas to one of the
two Siberian Pentecostal families who lived nearly
five years in the American Embassy as religious
refugees.
The official Tass news agency, in an unusual
announcement, said Pyotr Vashchenko and his
wife and 13 children have left their home in
Siberia s Krasnoyarsk territory "in accordance
with the established procedure for departure from
the U.S.S.R. for residence abroad."
The brief announcement said that they were
leaving at the invitation of Lydia Vashchenko, who
was allowed to leave in April, but it gave no further
details. A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Mos
cow said the news was a "positive step" but re
fused further comment on how it came about or
precisely where the Vashchenkos were. It was be
lieved, however, that they were already in Mos
cow Sunday and had left yesterday for Vienna and
Israel, culminating more than 20 years of prayer
and struggle to leave the Soviet Union in search of
religious freedom.
Five years ago yesterday, seven Siberian pen
tecostalists sprinted past Soviet guards outside the
U.S. Embassy and took refuge inside in the hopes

ot winning American help in emigrating. They
were the Vashchenko parents, three of their adult
daughters— Lydia, Lyuba, and Lilia—and two
friends Maria Chmykhalov and her son, Timofei,
now 20.
For nearly five years, the "Siberian Seven," as
the two families came to be known, lived in a
single cramped room on the embassy's ground
floor that looked out through iron grillwork at the
leather-booted feet of Soviet guards and beyond
to the grinding traffic of a main thoroughfare. In
their small room, measuring no more than about
12 by 20 feet, they spent much of their time in
prayer and in writing appeals to the Soviet
government—more than 500, by the Vashchen
kos' count—along with pleas for support from
governments and religious groups in the west.
South Africa considers quotas
Johannesburg, South Africa — Under a measure
beingconsidered by South Africa's Parliament, the
nation's white universities would be required to
limit the admission of black students.
The quota system would also be applied to
technical colleges, even though economists and
industrialists have made it clear that more skilled
technicians are needed than the white population
can provide.
Submission of the Universities Amendment Act,
along with a companion bill to cover the trade
schools, comes at a time when Prime Minister
Pieter Botha is trying to modify some aspects of
apartheid, South Africa's legalized system of racial
separation.
Botha's prime minister of national education,
Gerrit Viljoen, said the other day in parliamentary
debate that the quotas, which will be set for each
university after consultation with that school's of
ficials, will be an improvement on the present
system, which requires non-white applicants to
get government permission to enroll.
But even with this requirement, the number of
black students entering white universities has in
creased in recent years. The government, which
has been trying to project a better image on racial
matters, now apparently wants to put the onus for

limiting black enrollment on the universities.
The projected quota system has been de
nounced by administrators at most of the English
language universities. Officials at other white uni
versities, where instruction is mainly in Afrikaans,
the language of most of the nation's hard-line
whites, find it acceptable. Afrikaner universities
admit relatively few black students under any ar
rangement.
Communists show gains in Italy
Rome-Italy's dominant Christian Democratic
Party suffers its biggest electoral setback in more
than three decades yesterday, barely running
ahead of the communists in incomplete returns.
Abstentions and an apparent protest vote be
nefitted the neofacists and the extreme right and
the smaller parties in the outgoing center-left coal
ition. The communists, the largest Marxist Party in
the west, gained slightly over their showing in the
last national elections in 1979 in the voting for the
Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of parlia
ment.
Despite the heavy Christian Democratic losses,
the election result will almost certainly lead to
another coalition government of the type that has
been ruling Italy for nearly four decades. But polit
ical commentators said there could be protracted
negotiations on forming a new administration, Ita
ly's 44th since World War 11, with the minor parties
demanding a larger share of cabinet seats and a
bigger Say in policy-making.
Part of the reason for the upset could lie in the
votes of the 3.7 million young people who were
taking part in their first election.
Representing more than eight percent of their
electorate, they appear to have broken with the
political habits built up over generations by either
abstaining or voting for the fringe parties.
The Red Brigades claimed responsibility for
Sunday night's assassination of a leading public
prosecutor in the northern city of Turin, Bruno
Caccia, who was gunned down by masked men in
a passing car. But police were also investigating
the possibility that Caccia could have been killed
by criminals.
