# Toxic waste center plans to go forward
## 
### STEFI WEISBURD 
Faced with stringent en
vironmental laws and the in
creasing difficulty and cost of
safely disposing of the million
pounds of hazardous wastes
generated at Stanford each
year, the University may build a
facility to centralize the man
agement and treatment of
wastes on campus.
At its June 10 meeting, the
board of trustees was pre
sented with a plan to construct
a permanent Environmental
Safety Facility (EFS) near the
Medical Center.
The offices, laboratories and
training facilities currently
used for the procurement, dis
posal and monitoring of
hazardous materials are
housed in temporary struc
tures all over campus. If ap
proved, the ESF would con
solidate and improve these
facilities at a cost of about $5
million.
According to Lynda Weis
berg, assistant provost for
facilities planning, while the
University may not build the
ESF per se, it must respond in
some way to the increasingly
strict government regulations.

An added incentive for a re
sponse is the fact that Stan
ford's permit for its temporary
chemical waste storage and
handling facility will expire in
two years.
"The business of Stanford is
using materials of this sort,"
she said. "It's the tools of the
trade, if you will, to use biolog
ical materials and chemicals for
treatment and research."
Coupled with escalating dis
posal costs and an increased
concern for public safety, the
stricter environmental laws
create a pressing need for a
centralized facility dedicated
to the treatment and control of
hazardous wastes.
Existing legislation as well as
laws recently proposed at all
government levels spell out
the exact handling procedures
for the chemical, radioactive
and biological (including infec
tious) wastes produced by the
University hospital, medical
and science research labs as
well as art studios, mainte
nance and service facilities.
"The regulations are very
strict, as they should be," said
Alain DeCleve, director of
health and safety.
