# Toxic waste center plans to go forward
## 
### STEFI WEISBURD 
Faced with stringent en
vironmental laws and the in
creasing difficulty and cost of
safely disposing of the million
pounds of hazardous wastes
generated at Stanford each
year, the University may build a
facility to centralize the man
agement and treatment of
wastes on campus.
At its June 10 meeting, the
board of trustees was pre
sented with a plan to construct
a permanent Environmental
Safety Facility (EFS) near the
Medical Center.
The offices, laboratories and
training facilities currently
used for the procurement, dis
posal and monitoring of
hazardous materials are
housed in temporary struc
tures all over campus. If ap
proved, the ESF would con
solidate and improve these
facilities at a cost of about $5
million.
According to Lynda Weis
berg, assistant provost for
facilities planning, while the
University may not build the
ESF per se, it must respond in
some way to the increasingly
strict government regulations.

An added incentive for a re
sponse is the fact that Stan
ford's permit for its temporary
chemical waste storage and
handling facility will expire in
two years.
"The business of Stanford is
using materials of this sort,"
she said. "It's the tools of the
trade, if you will, to use biolog
ical materials and chemicals for
treatment and research."
Coupled with escalating dis
posal costs and an increased
concern for public safety, the
stricter environmental laws
create a pressing need for a
centralized facility dedicated
to the treatment and control of
hazardous wastes.
Existing legislation as well as
laws recently proposed at all
government levels spell out
the exact handling procedures
for the chemical, radioactive
and biological (including infec
tious) wastes produced by the
University hospital, medical
and science research labs as
well as art studios, mainte
nance and service facilities.
"The regulations are very
strict, as they should be," said
Alain DeCleve, director of
health and safety.
"Most of the regulations are
really reasonable. It's time that
we do something. We have got
to dispose of waste properly and
take our responsibilities along
with the city, county and state. It
is hard to make people realize
that everyone at every level will
have to participate and forget
the 'Not-in-my-backyard' at
titude."
The problem of safely manag
ing wastes is compounded by a
shortage of landfill sites. Accord
ing to DeCleve, the Washington
state site currently used by Stan
ford for radioactive materials
will close in three years. As land
fills become scarce, the disposal
costs skyrocket. By 1968 the cost
of disposing radioactive wastes
will have increased by 300 per
cent, DeCleve said.
Weisberg also notes that since
California has closed its toxic
waste receiving sites until it finds
new ones, "it is incumbent on us
to reduce the volume of waste
that we send to landfills."
The ESF would minimize the
amount of materials destined for
landfills by expanding the pro
gram for treating wastes before

they leave the campus. Where it
is safe and appropriate to do so,
wastes would be incinerated,
detoxified, neutralized, stored
or used as fuel. No waste would
be dumped on campus.
The ESF would also improve
the efficiency and safety of waste
management by reducing the
handling of materials. Under the
present management scheme,
the Health and Safety and Health
Physics departments pick up
hazardous wastes from the labo
ratories and Medical Center.
The wastes are then taken to
interim facilities where they are
stored or prepared for private
contractors who treat and dis
pose of them off campus.
DeCleve said that the present
system, which costs over
$300,000 a year for disposal
alone, is inefficient because
packaging, storage and treat
ment areas are scattered
throughout the campus.
The control of hazardous ma
terials could also be improved
by centralizing the University's
chemical procurement system.
"There are about 15 methods to
order a chemical," said De-
Cleve. "It's become very dif

ficult to know how and what
people buy."
A computer-linked stores sys
tem would discourage labs from
overstocking chemicals, a prac
tice that tends to be not only
dangerous and costly but gener
ates waste when the useful life of
the excess chemicals expires.

A centralized procurement
system would also facilitate re
cycling of chemicals, thereby

reducing costs as well as the vol
ume of landfill materials. De-
Cleve noted that the cost of dis
posal for some chemicals has al
ready droped 10 percent as a re
sult of recycling these materials
to companies that use their by
products.
A centralized management
program would enable Health
and Safety workers to more
closely monitor and correct the
useof hazardous materials in the
individual laboratories. This
would increase public safety and
ensure, through safety commit
tees and training programs, that
environmental regulations were
being followed consistently.
"Stanford is really responsible
for the management of waste,'
DeCleve stressed, "so we can't
let anyone do what they want
anymore." Improper use of
hazardous materials is unsafe,
costly, and consititutes a liability
for Stanford, he said. DeCleve
noted that the fine for a chemical
violation is $20,000 a day. In
fringements of regulations
could also lead to lawsuits, loss
of accreditation or even closure
of the University.
As one example of careless or

uneducated handling of hazard
ous materials, DeCleve noted
the recent replacement of a
"sump" pump from the plumb
ing of one of the engineering
buildings that should have
lasted for 10 years. But due to
incorrect handling of acids and
corrosive chemicals the heavy
cast iron was corroded and de
caying after only eight months.
"People can no longer deal
with materials in a hazardous
way," DeCleve said, and the ESF
would be a positive "first con
scious step to improve the
treatment of hazardous materi
als."
The facility would be built and
operated according to stringent
government standards, with
safeguards for the separation,
storage and neutralization of
wastes. "By demonstrating that
the Health and Safety and Health
Physics offices live there," De-
Cleve said, "people will know
that we aren't dumping any
thing."
If approved, construction of
the ESF would begin next year at
a site between Campus Drive
and Willow Road, south of the
Medical Center.

As one example of careless or

uneducated handling of hazard
ous materials, DeCleve noted
the recent replacement of a
"sump" pump from the plumb
ing of one of the engineering
buildings that should have
lasted for 10 years. But due to
incorrect handling of acids and
corrosive chemicals the heavy
cast iron was corroded and de
caying after only eight months.
"People can no longer deal
with materials in a hazardous
way," DeCleve said, and the ESF
would be a positive "first con
scious step to improve the
treatment of hazardous materi
als."
The facility would be built and
operated according to stringent
government standards, with
safeguards for the separation,
storage and neutralization of
wastes. "By demonstrating that
the Health and Safety and Health
Physics offices live there," De-
Cleve said, "people will know
that we aren't dumping any
thing."
If approved, construction of
the ESF would begin next year at
a site between Campus Drive
and Willow Road, south of the
Medical Center.

Faced with stringent en
vironmental laws and the in
creasing difficulty and cost of
safely disposing of the million
pounds of hazardous wastes
generated at Stanford each
year, the University may build a
facility to centralize the man
agement and treatment of
wastes on campus.
At its June 10 meeting, the
board of trustees was pre
sented with a plan to construct
a permanent Environmental
Safety Facility (EFS) near the
Medical Center.
The offices, laboratories and
training facilities currently
used for the procurement, dis
posal and monitoring of
hazardous materials are
housed in temporary struc
tures all over campus. If ap
proved, the ESF would con
solidate and improve these
facilities at a cost of about $5
million.
According to Lynda Weis
berg, assistant provost for
facilities planning, while the
University may not build the
ESF per se, it must respond in
some way to the increasingly
strict government regulations.

An added incentive for a re
sponse is the fact that Stan
ford's permit for its temporary
chemical waste storage and
handling facility will expire in
two years.
"The business of Stanford is
using materials of this sort,"
she said. "It's the tools of the
trade, if you will, to use biolog
ical materials and chemicals for
treatment and research."
Coupled with escalating dis
posal costs and an increased
concern for public safety, the
stricter environmental laws
create a pressing need for a
centralized facility dedicated
to the treatment and control of
hazardous wastes.
Existing legislation as well as
laws recently proposed at all
government levels spell out
the exact handling procedures
for the chemical, radioactive
and biological (including infec
tious) wastes produced by the
University hospital, medical
and science research labs as
well as art studios, mainte
nance and service facilities.
"The regulations are very
strict, as they should be," said
Alain DeCleve, director of
health and safety.
"Most of the regulations are
really reasonable. It's time that
we do something. We have got
to dispose of waste properly and
take our responsibilities along
with the city, county and state. It
is hard to make people realize
that everyone at every level will
have to participate and forget
the 'Not-in-my-backyard' at
titude."
The problem of safely manag
ing wastes is compounded by a
shortage of landfill sites. Accord
ing to DeCleve, the Washington
state site currently used by Stan
ford for radioactive materials
will close in three years. As land
fills become scarce, the disposal
costs skyrocket. By 1968 the cost
of disposing radioactive wastes
will have increased by 300 per
cent, DeCleve said.
Weisberg also notes that since
California has closed its toxic
waste receiving sites until it finds
new ones, "it is incumbent on us
to reduce the volume of waste
that we send to landfills."
The ESF would minimize the
amount of materials destined for
landfills by expanding the pro
gram for treating wastes before

they leave the campus. Where it
is safe and appropriate to do so,
wastes would be incinerated,
detoxified, neutralized, stored
or used as fuel. No waste would
be dumped on campus.
The ESF would also improve
the efficiency and safety of waste
management by reducing the
handling of materials. Under the
present management scheme,
the Health and Safety and Health
Physics departments pick up
hazardous wastes from the labo
ratories and Medical Center.
The wastes are then taken to
interim facilities where they are
stored or prepared for private
contractors who treat and dis
pose of them off campus.
DeCleve said that the present
system, which costs over
$300,000 a year for disposal
alone, is inefficient because
packaging, storage and treat
ment areas are scattered
throughout the campus.
The control of hazardous ma
terials could also be improved
by centralizing the University's
chemical procurement system.
"There are about 15 methods to
order a chemical," said De-
Cleve. "It's become very dif

ficult to know how and what
people buy."
A computer-linked stores sys
tem would discourage labs from
overstocking chemicals, a prac
tice that tends to be not only
dangerous and costly but gener
ates waste when the useful life of
the excess chemicals expires.

A centralized procurement
system would also facilitate re
cycling of chemicals, thereby

reducing costs as well as the vol
ume of landfill materials. De-
Cleve noted that the cost of dis
posal for some chemicals has al
ready droped 10 percent as a re
sult of recycling these materials
to companies that use their by
products.
A centralized management
program would enable Health
and Safety workers to more
closely monitor and correct the
useof hazardous materials in the
individual laboratories. This
would increase public safety and
ensure, through safety commit
tees and training programs, that
environmental regulations were
being followed consistently.
"Stanford is really responsible
for the management of waste,'
DeCleve stressed, "so we can't
let anyone do what they want
anymore." Improper use of
hazardous materials is unsafe,
costly, and consititutes a liability
for Stanford, he said. DeCleve
noted that the fine for a chemical
violation is $20,000 a day. In
fringements of regulations
could also lead to lawsuits, loss
of accreditation or even closure
of the University.
