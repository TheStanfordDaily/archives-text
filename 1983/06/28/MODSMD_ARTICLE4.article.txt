"Be they Jew or Arab, the
majority of people in the Middle
East want peace," Saudi Arabian
Prince Talal bin Abdul Aziz Al
Saud said yesterday morning fol
lowing a discussion session with
Hoover Institution fellows.
"Before there can be lasting
peace, the disparity between the
rich and poor countries must be
balanced," he said. Because of
this belief, Talal has spent most
of his life working for the de
velopment of poorer nations.
Talal, who raised more than
$40 million for UNICEF last year,
is currently touring the United
States as special envoy for UN
ICEF in an effort to make the
plight of developing countries
known and to raise additional
funds.
Though Talal insisted that the
reason for his tour was the
promotion of UNICEF and AC
FUND, an Arab organization
which channels money to U.N.
and other humanitarian prog
rams, he did not hesitate to
comment on the state of U.S.-
Saudi relations, especially in
terms of the Mideast conflict.
"Consider Saudi Arabia as
yourfriend and we will hearyour
advice. You have to assist us be
cause we play the key role in the
Middle East. But all you do is at
tack, attack, attack. Without
your support for our policies, we
can do nothing."
Talal said that Syria is a "very

important element" in the
search for a final settlement of
the Mideast conflict. He implied
that Saudi influence over Syria
should be matched with U.S. ef
forts to sway Israel. "We don't
have influence with Begin but
you do," he said.
Talal, the brother of Saudi
King Fahd, noted that commer
cial relations between the Un
ited States and Saudi Arabia
were increasing. "You people
do not understand the question
of oil here. We are not the only
ones who profit from oil prices.
It is your major companies
which make the most profit from
oil."
He said Saudi oil money was
returned to the United States in

the form of Saudi payments for
U.S. products. These totaled $35
billion last year, according to
Talal.
Talal is touring the country in a
private 727 jet. He arrived on
campus yesterday with an en
tourage of six aides and body
guards in a fleet of four chauf
feured limousines.
He addressed members of the
World Affairs Council of Los
Angeles yesterday and was
scheduled to speak in San Fran
cisco yesterday afternoon. On
Sunday, he visited the
Exploratorium in San Francisco
and spoke with high school stu
dents there about nuclear
weapons and disarmament.
