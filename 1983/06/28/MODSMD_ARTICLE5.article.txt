# Lech Walesa claims he won't run away
## 
### 
Warsaw, Polandâ€”Lech Walesa
on Sunday denied reports that
he might quit as leader of the
outlawed Solidarity labor
movement and urged Poles to
force the Communist govern
ment to revive free trade unions.
"I won't run away, I'can't run
away," Walesa said. "It is not
pleasant to do this work, but I
will not quit."
He was interviewed in Gdansk
by ABC News, which distributed
the text of his remarks to West
ern correspondents in Warsaw.
The 39-year-old Gdansk ship
yard electrician, who helped
form Solidarity in August 1980,
also said he "felt stronger" after
his meeting with Pope John Paul
II on Thursday, the last day of an
emotional eight-day papal pil
grimage to Poland. Walesa de
clined to disclose further details
of the papal audience.
A front-page editorial Friday
in the Vatican newspaper JL'Os
servatore Romano suggested
that by meeting Walesa pri
vately, the pontiff may have
been attempting to ease him out
of his role as leader of the union,
which was banned under martial
law. The editorial said "Walesa
has lost his battle."
The Vatican disowned the
editorial, and its writer, deputy
editor Virgilio Levi, resigned
Saturday, saying the article re
flected his personal views. But
the Vatican's position on Walesa
remains unclear.
The pope, an outspoken Sol
idarity supporter, has not spo
ken publicly about the Walesa
meeting, and the Vatican has
withheld publication of a photo
of the meeting.
Some observers suggested
the pope may have agreed to ask
Walesa to step aside in return for

the lifting of martial law in Po
land. Walesa himself fueled the
speculation by saying in an NBC
television interview last week:
"If there are better people to do
that (solve Poland's probelms),
then okay, let them go ahead."
Though the Polish govern
ment says it considers Walesa a
private citizen, he is still consi
dered head of Solidarity by sup
porters of the banned union,
who shout his name at illegal ral
lies and marches.
Walesa meets regularly with
Solidarity backers and in recent
months the union's under
ground. Healso isdenounced in
the state-run media.
Premier Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski's government has said
it will not negotiate with Walesa,
and claims it is honoring the Au
gust 1980 accords by allowing
new unions to form.
"I think that in August, the
people should ask those who
signed the agreements to sit
down once more and check
those agreements," Walesa
said.
"We will ask, beg, and force
them," Walesa said. Asked if he
was calling for protests, he said,
"I don't exclude anything. But
let it happen without protests.
We must return to the August
agreements."
Supporters of Solidarity are
boycotting the government
sanctioned unions, which have
limited powers and must pledge
allegiance to the communist
Party. The unions have fewer
than 3 million members.
Solidarity claimed 9.5 million
members before it was sus
pended with Dec. 13, 1981,
military crackdown and formally
outlawed last Oct. 8.
