## Wage gap narrows for U.S. and world 
### 
Many Americans complain
that aggressive unions that
have won significant wage
gains for their members in re
cent years are in large part re
sponsible for U.S. corpora
tions' current difficulties in
competing with their foreign
counterparts for customers
both here and abroad.
How can American com
panies compete with foreign
companies when U.S work
ers make so much more
money than their counter
parts overseas?
Those complaints are
answered, at ieast in part, by
figures from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics and from a re
cent study made by Daniel
Mitchell, director of Institute
of Industrial Relations at the
University of California, Los
Angeles, that show the
once-huge gap between the
wages of American workers
and their chief foreign com
petitors has narrowed
dramatically.
To be sure, the wage gap,
where it still exists, is cer
tainly a factor in the ability of
many foreign companies to
sell their products for less
than those produced by
Americans.
But the once-tremendous
labor cost advantage that
foreign nations had enjoyed
over the United States is smal
ler than ever. Labor costs are
no longer the crucial factor
they once were in determin
ing this country's competitive
international position.
And, on the basi& of his
study, Mitchell concluded, 'It
is likely that there is a long
run trend which will eventu
ally take wages out of com
petition, at least among de
veloped countries."

In 1960, you could have
hired 10 Japanese workers or
three German workers for the
money you would have paid
to employ just one American.
Today, you can hire only two
Japanese workers or 1.1
Germans for the price of one
American.
Indeed, factors other than
labor costs seem to be more
responsible for the competi
tive advantage enjoyed by
foreign companies, among
them the strong role of
foreign governments and
even workers in business
planning, cooperative
labor-management relations,
innovative marketing prac
tices, a willingness of corpo
rate managers to try for long
range instead of short-term
profits and often greater capi
tal investment than American
companies make.
Patricia Capdevielle, a
Bureau of Labor Statistics
economist who specializes in
foreign economic statistics,
agreed with Mitchell, noting
that the strengthening of the
dollar in the last two years has
offset some of the foreign
labor cost increases.
In 1978,f0r example,
Japanese labor costs reached
their peak in relation to
American labor costs. Then
you could have hired only 1.5
Japanese workers for the
price of one American.
But, because of the shifting
value of the yen against the
dollar, it now costs about
twice as much to hire an
American worker as a
Japaneseâ€”still a lot less than
in 1960, however.
