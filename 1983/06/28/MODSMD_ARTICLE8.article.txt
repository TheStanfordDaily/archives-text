# Congress pressures Reagan on his Central American policy
## 
### 
Washingtonâ€” President Reagan
is under increasing congres
sional pressure to spell out his
wants and hopes for Central
America in a low-key manner,
especially from supporters who
worry that Congress' slow and
unsteady movement in his direc
tion may soon halt.
Critics also want Reagan to be
more specific, claiming that the
policies' internal contradictions
then will be more obvious to the
watching world.
In the wake of the president's
much-praised April 27 speech on
Central America, Congress has
given him most of the aid fund
ing he has requested, albeit with
much foot-dragging.
Two monthes ago, for exam
ple, debate on foreign aid re
quests included demands for
proof that Nicaragua was supply
ing arms to leftist guerrillas in El
Salvador. This month, there was
no dissent when the House
Foreign Affairs Committee de
nounced Nicaragua for export
ing revolution.
Similarly, for the first time
since military aid became an is
sue, no member of Congress
suggested a total cutoff of aid to
El Salvador. Vet the constant
hesitation over aid levels has oc
casionally stalled supplies in the
pipeline and has contributed to
Salvadoran uncertainty on the
depth of the U.S. commitment,
according to administration and
congressional officials.
The U.S. public is also uncer
tain, according to recent polls,
which generally show wide
spread ignorance about Central
America and deep mistrust of
Reagan's push for more U.S. in
volvement there, the officials
said. Republicans want the pres
ident to lead an educational ef
fort but cool his rhetoric.
"No one in the House or Se
nate wants to be tagged as losing

El Salvador because we haven't
gone to the full amount" of aid
requested, said Sen. Nancy
Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan.,
whose moderate views are inf
luential on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. "But we
ought to have it fully explained
why and to what use the aid goes
and what makes it so important,
why they would lose without it.
The public has to understand it."
She and others cautioned that
more rhetoric will not do the
trick. Telling congressmen, as
the president did Friday, that fai
lure to grant his current $80 mill
ion request will mean the loss of

El Salvador to communism "just
makes it all seem too simple. It's
misleading," Kassebaum said.
A key Republican Senate staff
aide, self-described as a "critical
friend" to Reagan's policies, said
such dramatic appeals "remind
people of Vietnam. It's saying
every time, 'Just give us this, and
it'll all be okay.' But it's never
just that, it's always another
step."
A State Department official
deeply involved in implement
ing Reagan's policy in the region
agreed that the sales pitch needs
reworking. "There's no doubt
