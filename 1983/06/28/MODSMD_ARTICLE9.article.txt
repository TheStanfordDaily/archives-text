## Henry Organ Employee relations: an evaluation is needed 
### 
The University's Administrative Council is currently
considering a set of recommendations formulated by a
Task Force that surveyed 1300 staff members last year on
"Personnel Policies and Administration." The survey
covered nine topics, one of which was "Problem-
Solving and Grievance Mechanisms." The topic on
mechanisms covered five areas: Staff grievance proce
dures, Affirmative Action offices, the Stanford Help
Center, Employee Relations section of Personnel, and
the Ombudsman's Office.
The significance of this topic is that, if it had been
properly addressed by the Task Force's survey instru
ment, very insightful data about the other eight areas of
the survey would have been generated. For example,

The Affirmative Action Office consid
ers its primary function to be camouf
laging data and satisfying regulatory
agencies; and Employee Relations on
campus considers its primary mission
to be protecting managers.

what employees think about Stanford as an employer,
supervision, etc., usually can be reflected in what is
occurring in problem-solving and grievance activities, if
those offices perform as they should. Therefore, it is a
grave indictment of those offices that only a small per
centage of staff is aware of them, and that a majority of
the employees using those offices did not find them
useful. Such a report begs for additional information,
e.g., why those offices weren't found useful.
Although the Task Force has not seen fit to publish the
raw data on the survey, I would suspect, with great
confidence, that much of the criticism leveled by the
employees surveyed was directed toward the Universi
ty's Affirmative Action Office and the Employee Rela
tions Office on campus. My confidence is bolstered by
the fact that I have had frequent "experiences" with
those offices.
For example, 10 months ago I filed a grievance that, at
this moment, will not be heard, even though the griev
ance procedures require that Employee Relations ap
point a hearing officer within five working days. Another
example is the manager of Employee Relations (incor
rectly) advising me—with an expression of smug
satisfaction—that the University had no policy or stan
dard requiring managers' evaluations of employees to
be fair or consistent.
The University's Affirmative Action Office's perform
ance is so pathetic that the Office is too embarrassed to
disseminate to the University community a thorough
annual report on the status of the program. These two
offices have either abdicated their responsibilities or
abused their authority. The Ombudsman's Office and
the Help Center are certainly distinguishable in that they
are advisory and voluntary.
The significance of the Affirmative Action and Em
ployee Relations offices is that they are offices of trust,
but they are obviously not in practice at Stanford. The
individuals in those offices should feel a fiduciary obliga
tion to all University employees, irrespective of their
position or department, but they are obviously not. In-

stead, the Affirmative Action Office considers its pri
mary function to be camouflaging data and satisfying
regulatory agencies; and Employee Relations on campus
considers its primary mission to be protecting mana
gers, regardless of what management does.
Even with the best personnel policies that may flow
from the Administrative Council, the University cannot
be any better than the character of the individuals to
whom those policies are entrusted, and I have two ob
servations here. It is ironical, but by no means comical,
that these two offices on campus are headed by racial
minorities, which cculd lead to the conclusion that racial
minorities on campus are largely responsible for their
own plight. Second, the writer has found in his own
experiences improprieties and violations of University
personnel policy at the highest echelons of the vice
presidency responsible for grievance procedures.
I believe there is a very, very serious cloud on the
horizon that appears in a report from another task force.
This Task Force was one established by the President in
1981 on organization and management, and a full report
was published in the December 1982 issue of the Cam
pus Report. Deep in the bowels of this softly worded
report is a very threatening paragraph on "Organization
Structure and Size," which is as follows:
"Larger organizations, it is argued, generate more
mistakes because there is more to be wrong about and
more chances for misunderstanding.
They also generate more self-justifying activity such as
protective memoranda, the pursuit of personalized ar
guments and the like. The result is a more costly and less
efficient organization." (Emphasis added.)
This is a quiet but thunderous statement, however it
has raised very little if any attention from the University
community. Combined with the ultimate actions of the
Administrative Council on personnel policies and ad
ministration, and the state of economy, this statement

Students, staff and faculty are the trin
ity of a university. Only two of them,
however, have the benefits of a se
nate. Staff members of the University,
who are outside of bargaining units,
do not have a body that can speak for
them with the administration.

could very well harbinger greater abuse of employees as
others are eliminated under the rubric of economizing
and increasing efficiency. One can only hope that this is
not the administration's intent.
I maintain that the working environment, and a real
ncrease in productivity and efficiency, will not occur at
Stanford until such time as these offices require that all
managers treat employees fairly and consistently,
whether through centralized or de-centralized person
nel policies. I am not too optimistic that this will take
place, however.
What are the alternatives? What suggestions are rea
sonable? I have three. First, I do not believe much would
be lost if the University dissolved the Affirmative Action,

and terminated the Employee Relation offices' involve
ment in affairs pertaining to non-bargaining unit em
ployees. No one knows what the impact of the Affirma
tive Action Office is anyhow, and those who know won't
say. It is clear that the Employee Relation's Office is a
tool of management, and with managers conducting
themselves as arbitrarily as they are now, they really do
not need any further ratifications of their actions by
Employee Relations. In addition, in case some employ
ees may feel some comfort from the existence of per
sonnel policies, a local court informed the writer a few
years ago that the University is not obligated to follow its
own policies, as arbitrary, ambiguous, and lacking as
they are.

I maintain that the working environ
ment, and a real increase in productiv
ity and efficiency, will not occur at
Stanford until such time as these of
fices require that all managers treat
employees fairly.

Second, students, faculty and staff are the trinity of a
university. Only two of them, however, have the be
nefits of a senate. Staff members of the University, who
are outside of bargaining units, do not have a body that
can speak for them with the administration. Communi
cation, therefore, is only one-way, with surveys every
century being the only opportunity for the administra
tion to ascertain staff views, and then only very superfi
cially. A staff senate is certainly not inconsistent with
University policy and institutional wisdom.
Third, I believe that hearing officers should be mem
bers of the faculty. Some may disagree arduously with
this recommendation, but the writer finds it difficult to
believe that faculty members would accept and imple
ment many of the unethical practices the writer has
experienced or observed with staff as hearing officers.
By using faculty members, the small band of individuals
frequently called upon year after year to serve essen
tially as executioners would be relieved of these chores,
which they perform with obvious delight. The conflict
imposed upon these poor souls a$ hearing officers, i.e.,
if they have a trace of integrity, is quite clear: If he or she
wishes to advance in the university, he or she must
accept and sanction violations of the spirit and letter of
personnel policies. I do concede, however, that there
can be no conflict where there is no integrity.
The fourth, and last suggestion: Because the activities
of the Employee Relations Offices are one of the best
signs of the health of University employees, I believe the
Administrative Council should call for a more thorough
and independent reivew of that office and its activities
over the last five years or so. Such a review would in
clude at least the following data collection: profile on
grievants and those seeking assistance of that office; the
nature of grievances and concerns submitted; and,
analyses of the cases presented and the decisions ren
dered for due process.
A great University would do no less.

signs of the health of University employees, I believe the
Administrative Council should call for a more thorough
and independent reivew of that office and its activities
over the last five years or so. Such a review would in
clude at least the following data collection: profile on
grievants and those seeking assistance of that office; the
nature of grievances and concerns submitted; and,
analyses of the cases presented and the decisions ren
dered for due process.
A great University would do no less.
(Henry Organ is the associate Director of foundation
relations.)
The University's Administrative Council is currently
considering a set of recommendations formulated by a
Task Force that surveyed 1300 staff members last year on
"Personnel Policies and Administration." The survey
covered nine topics, one of which was "Problem-
Solving and Grievance Mechanisms." The topic on
mechanisms covered five areas: Staff grievance proce
dures, Affirmative Action offices, the Stanford Help
Center, Employee Relations section of Personnel, and
the Ombudsman's Office.
The significance of this topic is that, if it had been
properly addressed by the Task Force's survey instru
ment, very insightful data about the other eight areas of
the survey would have been generated. For example,

The Affirmative Action Office consid
ers its primary function to be camouf
laging data and satisfying regulatory
agencies; and Employee Relations on
campus considers its primary mission
to be protecting managers.

what employees think about Stanford as an employer,
supervision, etc., usually can be reflected in what is
occurring in problem-solving and grievance activities, if
those offices perform as they should. Therefore, it is a
grave indictment of those offices that only a small per
centage of staff is aware of them, and that a majority of
the employees using those offices did not find them
useful. Such a report begs for additional information,
e.g., why those offices weren't found useful.
Although the Task Force has not seen fit to publish the
raw data on the survey, I would suspect, with great
confidence, that much of the criticism leveled by the
employees surveyed was directed toward the Universi
ty's Affirmative Action Office and the Employee Rela
tions Office on campus. My confidence is bolstered by
the fact that I have had frequent "experiences" with
those offices.
For example, 10 months ago I filed a grievance that, at
this moment, will not be heard, even though the griev
ance procedures require that Employee Relations ap
point a hearing officer within five working days. Another
example is the manager of Employee Relations (incor
rectly) advising me—with an expression of smug
satisfaction—that the University had no policy or stan
dard requiring managers' evaluations of employees to
be fair or consistent.
The University's Affirmative Action Office's perform
ance is so pathetic that the Office is too embarrassed to
disseminate to the University community a thorough
annual report on the status of the program. These two
offices have either abdicated their responsibilities or
abused their authority. The Ombudsman's Office and
the Help Center are certainly distinguishable in that they
are advisory and voluntary.
The significance of the Affirmative Action and Em
ployee Relations offices is that they are offices of trust,
but they are obviously not in practice at Stanford. The
individuals in those offices should feel a fiduciary obliga
tion to all University employees, irrespective of their
position or department, but they are obviously not. In-

stead, the Affirmative Action Office considers its pri
mary function to be camouflaging data and satisfying
regulatory agencies; and Employee Relations on campus
considers its primary mission to be protecting mana
gers, regardless of what management does.
Even with the best personnel policies that may flow
from the Administrative Council, the University cannot
be any better than the character of the individuals to
whom those policies are entrusted, and I have two ob
servations here. It is ironical, but by no means comical,
that these two offices on campus are headed by racial
minorities, which cculd lead to the conclusion that racial
minorities on campus are largely responsible for their
own plight. Second, the writer has found in his own
experiences improprieties and violations of University
personnel policy at the highest echelons of the vice
presidency responsible for grievance procedures.
I believe there is a very, very serious cloud on the
horizon that appears in a report from another task force.
This Task Force was one established by the President in
1981 on organization and management, and a full report
was published in the December 1982 issue of the Cam
pus Report. Deep in the bowels of this softly worded
report is a very threatening paragraph on "Organization
Structure and Size," which is as follows:
"Larger organizations, it is argued, generate more
mistakes because there is more to be wrong about and
more chances for misunderstanding.
They also generate more self-justifying activity such as
protective memoranda, the pursuit of personalized ar
guments and the like. The result is a more costly and less
efficient organization." (Emphasis added.)
This is a quiet but thunderous statement, however it
has raised very little if any attention from the University
community. Combined with the ultimate actions of the
Administrative Council on personnel policies and ad
ministration, and the state of economy, this statement

Students, staff and faculty are the trin
ity of a university. Only two of them,
however, have the benefits of a se
nate. Staff members of the University,
who are outside of bargaining units,
do not have a body that can speak for
them with the administration.

could very well harbinger greater abuse of employees as
others are eliminated under the rubric of economizing
and increasing efficiency. One can only hope that this is
not the administration's intent.
I maintain that the working environment, and a real
ncrease in productivity and efficiency, will not occur at
Stanford until such time as these offices require that all
managers treat employees fairly and consistently,
whether through centralized or de-centralized person
nel policies. I am not too optimistic that this will take
place, however.
What are the alternatives? What suggestions are rea
sonable? I have three. First, I do not believe much would
be lost if the University dissolved the Affirmative Action,

and terminated the Employee Relation offices' involve
ment in affairs pertaining to non-bargaining unit em
ployees. No one knows what the impact of the Affirma
tive Action Office is anyhow, and those who know won't
say. It is clear that the Employee Relation's Office is a
tool of management, and with managers conducting
themselves as arbitrarily as they are now, they really do
not need any further ratifications of their actions by
Employee Relations. In addition, in case some employ
ees may feel some comfort from the existence of per
sonnel policies, a local court informed the writer a few
years ago that the University is not obligated to follow its
own policies, as arbitrary, ambiguous, and lacking as
they are.

I maintain that the working environ
ment, and a real increase in productiv
ity and efficiency, will not occur at
Stanford until such time as these of
fices require that all managers treat
employees fairly.

Second, students, faculty and staff are the trinity of a
university. Only two of them, however, have the be
nefits of a senate. Staff members of the University, who
are outside of bargaining units, do not have a body that
can speak for them with the administration. Communi
cation, therefore, is only one-way, with surveys every
century being the only opportunity for the administra
tion to ascertain staff views, and then only very superfi
cially. A staff senate is certainly not inconsistent with
University policy and institutional wisdom.
Third, I believe that hearing officers should be mem
bers of the faculty. Some may disagree arduously with
this recommendation, but the writer finds it difficult to
believe that faculty members would accept and imple
ment many of the unethical practices the writer has
experienced or observed with staff as hearing officers.
By using faculty members, the small band of individuals
frequently called upon year after year to serve essen
tially as executioners would be relieved of these chores,
which they perform with obvious delight. The conflict
imposed upon these poor souls a$ hearing officers, i.e.,
if they have a trace of integrity, is quite clear: If he or she
wishes to advance in the university, he or she must
accept and sanction violations of the spirit and letter of
personnel policies. I do concede, however, that there
can be no conflict where there is no integrity.
The fourth, and last suggestion: Because the activities
of the Employee Relations Offices are one of the best

tially as executioners would be relieved of these chores,
which they perform with obvious delight. The conflict
imposed upon these poor souls a$ hearing officers, i.e.,
if they have a trace of integrity, is quite clear: If he or she
wishes to advance in the university, he or she must
accept and sanction violations of the spirit and letter of
personnel policies. I do concede, however, that there
can be no conflict where there is no integrity.
The fourth, and last suggestion: Because the activities
of the Employee Relations Offices are one of the best
signs of the health of University employees, I believe the
Administrative Council should call for a more thorough
and independent reivew of that office and its activities
over the last five years or so. Such a review would in
clude at least the following data collection: profile on
grievants and those seeking assistance of that office; the
nature of grievances and concerns submitted; and,
analyses of the cases presented and the decisions ren
dered for due process.
A great University would do no less.
