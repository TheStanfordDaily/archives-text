# OPINIONS
## Linda Crouse USW's struggles are not over 
### 
Here's a question: which representative of Stan
ford management is telling the truth? a. President
Donald Kennedy, when he says that we at
Stanford—labor, management and everyone
else—are like a big family . . . b. Plant Services
Manager Herb Fong, when he says that he uses
non-union labor, hired through an outside con
tractor, because that way "we don't have to fool
with any benefits or paperwork and it's easy to hire
and easy to fire." (Daily, June 2) If you chose "b",
congratulations. You're probably either a United
Stanford Workers union member and know what's
going on firsthand, or you're a smart person.
What's amazing is that Fong is so upfront about
an outrageous but growing practice of Stanford
management: they're taking our Union's bargain
ing unit work (technical, maintenance and service
work) and giving it to non-union workers. This
means that workers who have contract rights are
replaced by workers with no rights. This practice
both hurts the union workers and exploits the
non-union workers. It also threatens to weaken
our Union's strength as a growing percentage of
Stanford's work is done by non-union labor.
Management's contract negotiator, Priscilla
Wheeler, has absolutely refused to negotiate any
protection against this abuse. Management wants
to keep it "legal." Every day we hear about corpo
rations trying to replace union with non-union
labor. Stanford hasn't made the news because it's
a lot sneakier about what it's trying to do than say,
Quantas, Atari or CM. Let's look at the round
about way it takes work away from our
craftspeople at Plant Services and contracts it out.
• Manipulating Shop Rates
First, management raises the craft shop rates to
campus users. Although skilled craftspeople aver
age about $12 an hour, the shop rates are raised to
$30 and $40 an hour. Second, management then
tells campus users to get bids from outside con
tractors. These contractors are usually non-union.
That means they may pay a lot lower wages and
give no benefits or steady employemnt to their
workers. This almost guarantees that our craft
shops will bo under-bid. And this, of course, jus
tifies contracting out. But wait. There's more! By
contractingout, management justifies keepingthe
shop crews small. Because the crews are small,
they can't handle the growing load of work re
quests fast enough, so this justifies more contract
ing out. Now that's "roundabout!"
•Phoney Promotions
At the Medical Center, management tries to ac
complish the same thing in different ways. In one
approach they "promote" union life science tech
nicians to a non-union classification (research as
sistant) by claiming to change their job. In reality
the assistants often keep on doing the same tech
nician work. The only difference is they're not in
the union. What's worse, when the budget axe has
fallen, management has tried to lay-off union
technicians instead of non-union assistants doing
the same work. Sneaky.
•Phoney Use of Temporaries
Herb Fong has a long history of using non-union
labor. While the grounds crew has grown smaller
over the years through attrition, Fong has given
the grounds work to outside contractors like his
friend Rossi, or Webb, or temporary agencies. The
labor shop at grounds used to have around 12
union laborers. Now it's down to six or seven,
while cheaper non-union "temporaries" work
side by side with them, continuously.
The same thing is going on at SLAC. "Temporary
job shoppers" are hired for years, union techni
cians are "promoted" into the non-union classifi
cation of "associate", although they keep on
doing the same work, and new technical jobs are
posted as non-union associate jobs instead of

union technician jobs.
What's happening here is that Stanford man
agement is trying to do to us what Reagan did to
PATCO. They are trying to suppress our union
"legally" by exploiting weaknesses in contract
language and labor laws. By doing this and by
holding the threat of non-union competition over
our heads, they hope to get a "docile" work force.
Well, we've got news for Kennedy and Wheeler
and the rest: we aren't going to be docile around
here. Our contract is the best tool we have for
fighting unfair treatment. We see this everyday
when we compare ourselves with Stanford clerical
and hospital workers who have no contract rights.
But when our contract is not good enough—and it
is not good enough when it comes to protecting
our bargaining unit work—then we will still fight
back. How, you ask? With everything we've got:
publicity, shop meetings, public pressure, visits to
Kennedy or the Trustees—whatever it takes.
We have won many battles in our Union's his
tory at Stanford, even without the protection of
contract language. We formed one of the nation's
first university unions, against all odds. With a
boycott we stopped mass layoffs at Tresidder be
fore our Union was even officially recognized.
With public pressure we stopped the layoff of a
worker (Julia Harvey) just before her retirement.
And we did that before we even had a contract. We
won these and other battles because we had the
guts and spirit to take action. And we still do.

Stanford management is trying to
do to us what Reagan did to
PATCO. They are trying to sup
press our union 'legally' by
exploiting weaknesses in contract
language and labor laws. By doing
this and by holding the threat of
non-union competition over our
heads, they hope to get a 'docile'
work force.

Because we had to fight back in these ways when
we didn't have a contract language to protect us,
Kennedy and others have complained that our
union is too "uncooperative." The whole point of
negotiating contract protection is to enable work
ers to protect themselves by going through legal
channels instead of resorting to other actions. But
Kennedy and Wheeler can't have it both ways.
They can't refuse to negotiate any protection of
our union work, proceed to take that work away
from us, and still expect us to sit around and twid
dle our thumbs. They are, in fact, guaranteeing
that we will take action.
Stanford management is going to get the oppo
site of what they want. By threatening our union
they make us more determined to take whatever
steps are necessary to strengthen it. That's because
our union is the only tool we have now to fight for
decent pay, and to fight against discrimination and
injustice.
We hope that other parts of the Stanford com
munity will see that our struggle to be treated
decently by the Stanford administration is their
struggle too. We hope they will join us as they
have in the past in whatever steps we have to take
in the future.

back. How, you ask? With everything we've got:
publicity, shop meetings, public pressure, visits to
Kennedy or the Trustees—whatever it takes.
We have won many battles in our Union's his
tory at Stanford, even without the protection of
contract language. We formed one of the nation's
first university unions, against all odds. With a
boycott we stopped mass layoffs at Tresidder be
fore our Union was even officially recognized.
With public pressure we stopped the layoff of a
worker (Julia Harvey) just before her retirement.
And we did that before we even had a contract. We
won these and other battles because we had the
guts and spirit to take action. And we still do.

Stanford management is trying to
do to us what Reagan did to
PATCO. They are trying to sup
press our union 'legally' by
exploiting weaknesses in contract
language and labor laws. By doing
this and by holding the threat of
non-union competition over our
heads, they hope to get a 'docile'
work force.

Because we had to fight back in these ways when
we didn't have a contract language to protect us,
Kennedy and others have complained that our
union is too "uncooperative." The whole point of
negotiating contract protection is to enable work
ers to protect themselves by going through legal
channels instead of resorting to other actions. But
Kennedy and Wheeler can't have it both ways.
They can't refuse to negotiate any protection of
our union work, proceed to take that work away
from us, and still expect us to sit around and twid
dle our thumbs. They are, in fact, guaranteeing
that we will take action.
Stanford management is going to get the oppo
site of what they want. By threatening our union
they make us more determined to take whatever
steps are necessary to strengthen it. That's because
our union is the only tool we have now to fight for
decent pay, and to fight against discrimination and
injustice.
We hope that other parts of the Stanford com
munity will see that our struggle to be treated
decently by the Stanford administration is their
struggle too. We hope they will join us as they
have in the past in whatever steps we have to take
in the future.

Here's a question: which representative of Stan
ford management is telling the truth? a. President
Donald Kennedy, when he says that we at
Stanford—labor, management and everyone
else—are like a big family . . . b. Plant Services
Manager Herb Fong, when he says that he uses
non-union labor, hired through an outside con
tractor, because that way "we don't have to fool
with any benefits or paperwork and it's easy to hire
and easy to fire." (Daily, June 2) If you chose "b",
congratulations. You're probably either a United
Stanford Workers union member and know what's
going on firsthand, or you're a smart person.
What's amazing is that Fong is so upfront about
an outrageous but growing practice of Stanford
management: they're taking our Union's bargain
ing unit work (technical, maintenance and service
work) and giving it to non-union workers. This
means that workers who have contract rights are
replaced by workers with no rights. This practice
both hurts the union workers and exploits the
non-union workers. It also threatens to weaken
our Union's strength as a growing percentage of
Stanford's work is done by non-union labor.
Management's contract negotiator, Priscilla
Wheeler, has absolutely refused to negotiate any
protection against this abuse. Management wants
to keep it "legal." Every day we hear about corpo
rations trying to replace union with non-union
labor. Stanford hasn't made the news because it's
a lot sneakier about what it's trying to do than say,
Quantas, Atari or CM. Let's look at the round
about way it takes work away from our
craftspeople at Plant Services and contracts it out.
• Manipulating Shop Rates
First, management raises the craft shop rates to
campus users. Although skilled craftspeople aver
age about $12 an hour, the shop rates are raised to
$30 and $40 an hour. Second, management then
tells campus users to get bids from outside con
tractors. These contractors are usually non-union.
That means they may pay a lot lower wages and
give no benefits or steady employemnt to their
workers. This almost guarantees that our craft
shops will bo under-bid. And this, of course, jus
tifies contracting out. But wait. There's more! By
contractingout, management justifies keepingthe
shop crews small. Because the crews are small,
they can't handle the growing load of work re
quests fast enough, so this justifies more contract
ing out. Now that's "roundabout!"
•Phoney Promotions
At the Medical Center, management tries to ac
complish the same thing in different ways. In one
approach they "promote" union life science tech
nicians to a non-union classification (research as
sistant) by claiming to change their job. In reality
the assistants often keep on doing the same tech
nician work. The only difference is they're not in
the union. What's worse, when the budget axe has
fallen, management has tried to lay-off union
technicians instead of non-union assistants doing
the same work. Sneaky.
•Phoney Use of Temporaries
Herb Fong has a long history of using non-union
labor. While the grounds crew has grown smaller
over the years through attrition, Fong has given
the grounds work to outside contractors like his
friend Rossi, or Webb, or temporary agencies. The
labor shop at grounds used to have around 12
union laborers. Now it's down to six or seven,
while cheaper non-union "temporaries" work
side by side with them, continuously.
The same thing is going on at SLAC. "Temporary
job shoppers" are hired for years, union techni
cians are "promoted" into the non-union classifi
cation of "associate", although they keep on
doing the same work, and new technical jobs are
posted as non-union associate jobs instead of

union technician jobs.
What's happening here is that Stanford man
agement is trying to do to us what Reagan did to
PATCO. They are trying to suppress our union
"legally" by exploiting weaknesses in contract
language and labor laws. By doing this and by
holding the threat of non-union competition over
our heads, they hope to get a "docile" work force.
Well, we've got news for Kennedy and Wheeler
and the rest: we aren't going to be docile around
here. Our contract is the best tool we have for
fighting unfair treatment. We see this everyday
when we compare ourselves with Stanford clerical
and hospital workers who have no contract rights.
But when our contract is not good enough—and it
is not good enough when it comes to protecting
our bargaining unit work—then we will still fight
back. How, you ask? With everything we've got:
publicity, shop meetings, public pressure, visits to
Kennedy or the Trustees—whatever it takes.
