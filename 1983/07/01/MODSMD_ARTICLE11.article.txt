As a woefully uninformed
Roman Catholic, I have an in
choate feeling that it is my duty
to believe some things that any
group of sane and reasonably in
telligent people would agree are
either impossible or else border
so nearly on impossibility as to
make the difference totally prob
lematic.
For instance, I'm fairly sure my
people believe in papal infallibil
ity.
History says that there have
been some popes who were not
only fallible, but also downright
criminal. This seems trouble
some, but there is a great wealth
of interpretation and the whole
category of works done in mys
terious ways, leading to the
point that Catholicism can take
care of itself.
There is another religion,
however, which cannot. I hap
pen to also be a member of this
creed, and there are some in
consistancies that I simply can
not explain away or accept.
I am speaking, naturally, of
the amazingly widespread relig
ion I call 'Nonsectarian
Americanized General Christ
ianity.' Other churches have
their heroes, such as Moses,
Jesus and Mohammed, but this
church doesn't really have a
founder, unless you want to get
sociological and say it was Walt
Disney.
NAGC is familiar to all of us,
from the merry philanthropy of
Santa Claus to the fleecy clouds
of heaven. I spent a few years
under the impression that Santa
was Jesus' dad, and it took a
good long time for Father Ryan
to convince me otherwise. This
heaven thing, however, hasn't
yet gone away.
Heaven, if it's anything like it's
generally pictured, must be
peopled by a lot of extremely
disgruntled people whose main
satisfaction must come from
having a good hearty laugh at
our expense.
Let's get a few things out of the
way first of ail. There are plenty
of cheap shots one could take at
Heaven, like the old cliche of
harps. Just like the man on the
desert isle, the group of people
sitting around playing harps and
looking bored is a cartoon
standby.

There are some things that
people do believe actually are
the case in Heaven, the main
thing being that once you die,
before the car that hit you gets
even 50 yards down the street,
you get into heaven. Traditional
theology—mine—requires you
to sit around and decompose a
heck of a long time before some
Judgment Day, but the NACC
way involves no wait: boom!
and you're up there with Mark
Twain.
There you are, reunited with
your loved ones, obligated to re
tell the nasty details of your
death several hundred thousand
times, and being scorned by all
the people who died rescuing 40
people from a burning building.
What are you going to do
now? You walk around on
clouds until the novelty wears
off, talk to the girl who sat be
hindyou injuniorhigh,andthen
you go to town to see if there's
anything doing in there.
There probably isn't anything
very exciting, as you have to
keep in mind that most of the
fun people you knew are now
being immersed in boiling pitch
by yowling fiends. Still, thereare
the famous people here. All the
great scientists, working away.
Maybe go join a sports league?
Well, not only is there still a
good 70 percent of the people
you knew up there, but the same
amount of everybody ever, and a
lot of them found out they're
very good at sports of which they
never heard. Achilles still holds
the record for pitching victories,
career—and he's still going
strong.
Remember that sickly kid in
your third grade class, who was
never good at sports, and who
died that summer of T. 8.? Well,
he's been practicing<or67years,
and he can whip you at every
thing. Plus, he laughs at you af
terward. Very depressing.
That's the whole of it really. It
used to be a good place,
Heaven, but lately most folks
feel out of touch, and just sit at
home and watch TV to see
what's going on on earth. They
find most of it pretty funny, and
laugh bitter little laughs.
