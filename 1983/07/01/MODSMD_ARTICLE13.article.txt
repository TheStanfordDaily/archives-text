## Bookstore rebates due in September 
### SAM FARMER RAJEEV GAJEN DRAN 
Early summer traditionally
means Stanford Bookstore re
bate checks. But not this year.
As a non-profit business, for
the past two years the bookstore
has returned its profits to cus
tomers and employees in the
form of rebates and bonuses.
Seventy-five percent of the
store's excess revenue is re
turned to customers. Customers
save their receipts and return
them to the bookstore in special
rebate envelopes in early spring.
For the average student who
spends about $300 a year on
books, the rebates, which have
hovered around the 15 percent
mark, can mean an extra $40 with
which to start the summer.
Because of increased business
during commencement this year
and the annual end-of-the
fiscal-year bookkeeping chores,
the bookstore will not be able to
issue the rebate checks until at

least September or October, ac
cording to bookstore General
Manager Eldon Speed.
Speed said that it has become
progessively more difficult for
the store's staff to meet the June
deadline for rebates, and that
this year it finally proved impos
sible.
Only book purchases qualify
for the rebate. But according to
Speed, little of the store's profit
comes from the sale of books.
Rather, the bookstore makes its
profit on the other items—
souvenirs, clothing—it sells
which are non-essentials for
students.
Speed said he believes that
the rebates are a valuable public
relations tool for the bookstore,
in that they show the public that
the store is making an effort to
serve the best interests of the
community.
But there's another benefit,
he said. "It also saves us the
trouble of picking up discarded
receipts off the floor."
