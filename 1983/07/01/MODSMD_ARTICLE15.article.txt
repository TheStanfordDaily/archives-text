# Revised guide answers group funding questions
## 
### RICKY SPEAR 
Although many sources of
funding are available for student
organizations, these sources are
not always easily found, easily ar
ranged, or easily coordinated.
The Student Center for Inno
vation in Research and Educa
tion (SCIRE) is working to
change that.
SCIRE, a major coordinating
center for fund raising and itself
responsible for a $4000 budget,
is attempting to alert student or
ganizations to possible funding
sources by publishing an up
dated version of the Guide to
Campus Funding.
According to Jane Adams,
co-director of SCIRE, the guide
"has comprehensive sections in
planning funding proposals and
campus funding sources, with
new sections in other resources,
including off-campus money."
Many campus organizations,
including the ASSU, the Office
of Student Activities (OSA),
Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues (SWOPSI), a
number of University offices,
and SCIRE itself, offer funding
for student projects.
But the funds aren't available
to just anyone. All the sources
listed in the guide specify that, in
order for a project to receive
funds, it must benefit the com
munity in a lasting manner.
How can an existing or poten
tial group get funding?
Those who plan in advance
and have a lasting project with a
broad impact have the best
chance of finding money.
Some student fund-raisers

also suggest looking for money
off campus, perhaps in the Palo
Alto community.
Others suggest writing to
alumni or other private sources
if those sources in SCIRE's fund
ing guide prove unattainable, al
though the Office of Develop
ment warns that such outside
fund raising may take away
funds from the entire Stanford
community.
Of the five major sources for
undergraduate organizations
and events funding, SCIRE wants
to be considered "the primary
resource for special innovative
funds and resources for funding
for undergraduate research."
OSA, on the other hand, is the
student's primary resource for
funding information for events
and publications.
For the group that is both
highly motivated and highly
disciplined, these organizations
can be a gold mine.
Last October, a group of stu
dents started planning a spring
quarter special undergraduate
class entitled "The Energy Con
troversy: Soft Path vs. Hard
Path." The students aimed
for—and got —$12,000 by spring.
They were able to pay for an
instructor and teaching assis
tants and invite experts in the
field to serve as guest lecturers
in "one of the biggest" student
initiated classes that the Under
graduate Special Program (UGS)
has ever dealt with, according to
USG Director Laura Selznick.
The Okada House Ex
travaganza, a week of cultural
activities sponsored by the Asian

theme house, is another event
that has benefited from campus
funding. According to event or
ganizer Ann Schaefer, funding
"requires a lot of writing and
early plans. Usual allotments are
made in $50 increments. With
$50 here and $50 there, a $1200
budget is hard to meet."
Other organizations start with
SCIRE money but eventually
earn financial independence.
The Savoyards; for example,
sell tickets to their performances
and re-use sets and costumes in
order to meet their expenses.
Originally funded by SCIRE's
the Savoyards are once again
starting to look for external in
come sources because their sets
and costumes are in need of re
placement.
According to SCIRE's Adams,
The Company was in a similar
situation and went to SCIRE for
help. Originally funded by
SCIRE, the theater group went
on to establish its independence
but hit hard times when costs
grew too high for a production
of Jesus Christ Superstar.
SCIRE decided that the group
was deserving of renewed aid
because they felt that the long
term project had simply faltered
momentarily.
Other groups indicated they
are grateful for SCIRE financial
help.
According to Sushma Govin
darajulu of Stanford Against
Conscription, "Stanford has a
really good deal for student
groups. We start out every quar
ter with $600 from the program
fee (provided by the ASSU).

With that and the (Publications)
Board, we can put out really
classy publications. And we
don't even have a full fee as
sessment."
In addition to the ASSU
money, SAC has raised funds in
the past by holding parties and
soliciting donations from faculty
members who identify with its
cause.
The Glee Club, on the other
hand, has a tougher time. Ac
cording to Martin Beene, his
group has to scramble for funds
because of cuts by OSA. Al
though the Glee Club has a
four-year-old fee assessment,
this assessment is only good for
traveling expenses. The club has
little else to draw upon.
Throughout the Glee Club's
search for funds, it has never
come in contact with the SCIRE

funding guide, Beene said.
More than student groups can
benefit from SCIRE funds. SCIRE
also offers funds for individual
students' honors theses.
While Meg Donovan, previ
ous student co-director of
SCI RE, said few students applied
for the funds last year, Adams
said she feels that many students
need such funding and that a
lack of money for such projects
will be a problem if University
sources do not increase in the
future.
This year, SCIRE gave about
$200 each to an oral history pro
ject and a project that required a
survey of congressmen.
Academic departments do ad
minister funds, but usually at the
discretion of professors, and
then only to a small number of
people.

order to meet their expenses.
Originally funded by SCIRE's
the Savoyards are once again
starting to look for external in
come sources because their sets
and costumes are in need of re
placement.
According to SCIRE's Adams,
The Company was in a similar
situation and went to SCIRE for
help. Originally funded by
SCIRE, the theater group went
on to establish its independence
but hit hard times when costs
grew too high for a production
of Jesus Christ Superstar.
SCIRE decided that the group
was deserving of renewed aid
because they felt that the long
term project had simply faltered
momentarily.
Other groups indicated they
are grateful for SCIRE financial
help.
According to Sushma Govin
darajulu of Stanford Against
Conscription, "Stanford has a
really good deal for student
groups. We start out every quar
ter with $600 from the program
fee (provided by the ASSU).

With that and the (Publications)
Board, we can put out really
classy publications. And we
don't even have a full fee as
sessment."
In addition to the ASSU
money, SAC has raised funds in
the past by holding parties and
soliciting donations from faculty
members who identify with its
cause.
The Glee Club, on the other
hand, has a tougher time. Ac
cording to Martin Beene, his
group has to scramble for funds
because of cuts by OSA. Al
though the Glee Club has a
four-year-old fee assessment,
this assessment is only good for
traveling expenses. The club has
little else to draw upon.
Throughout the Glee Club's
search for funds, it has never
come in contact with the SCIRE

funding guide, Beene said.
More than student groups can
benefit from SCIRE funds. SCIRE
also offers funds for individual
students' honors theses.
While Meg Donovan, previ
ous student co-director of
SCI RE, said few students applied
for the funds last year, Adams
said she feels that many students
need such funding and that a
lack of money for such projects
will be a problem if University
sources do not increase in the
future.
This year, SCIRE gave about
$200 each to an oral history pro
ject and a project that required a
survey of congressmen.
Academic departments do ad
minister funds, but usually at the
discretion of professors, and
then only to a small number of
people.

Although many sources of
funding are available for student
organizations, these sources are
not always easily found, easily ar
ranged, or easily coordinated.
The Student Center for Inno
vation in Research and Educa
tion (SCIRE) is working to
change that.
SCIRE, a major coordinating
center for fund raising and itself
responsible for a $4000 budget,
is attempting to alert student or
ganizations to possible funding
sources by publishing an up
dated version of the Guide to
Campus Funding.
According to Jane Adams,
co-director of SCIRE, the guide
"has comprehensive sections in
planning funding proposals and
campus funding sources, with
new sections in other resources,
including off-campus money."
Many campus organizations,
including the ASSU, the Office
of Student Activities (OSA),
Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues (SWOPSI), a
number of University offices,
and SCIRE itself, offer funding
for student projects.
But the funds aren't available
to just anyone. All the sources
listed in the guide specify that, in
order for a project to receive
funds, it must benefit the com
munity in a lasting manner.
How can an existing or poten
tial group get funding?
Those who plan in advance
and have a lasting project with a
broad impact have the best
chance of finding money.
Some student fund-raisers

also suggest looking for money
off campus, perhaps in the Palo
Alto community.
Others suggest writing to
alumni or other private sources
if those sources in SCIRE's fund
ing guide prove unattainable, al
though the Office of Develop
ment warns that such outside
fund raising may take away
funds from the entire Stanford
community.
Of the five major sources for
undergraduate organizations
and events funding, SCIRE wants
to be considered "the primary
resource for special innovative
funds and resources for funding
for undergraduate research."
OSA, on the other hand, is the
student's primary resource for
funding information for events
and publications.
For the group that is both
highly motivated and highly
disciplined, these organizations
can be a gold mine.
Last October, a group of stu
dents started planning a spring
quarter special undergraduate
class entitled "The Energy Con
troversy: Soft Path vs. Hard
Path." The students aimed
for—and got —$12,000 by spring.
They were able to pay for an
instructor and teaching assis
tants and invite experts in the
field to serve as guest lecturers
in "one of the biggest" student
initiated classes that the Under
graduate Special Program (UGS)
has ever dealt with, according to
USG Director Laura Selznick.
The Okada House Ex
travaganza, a week of cultural
activities sponsored by the Asian

theme house, is another event
that has benefited from campus
funding. According to event or
ganizer Ann Schaefer, funding
"requires a lot of writing and
early plans. Usual allotments are
made in $50 increments. With
$50 here and $50 there, a $1200
budget is hard to meet."
Other organizations start with
SCIRE money but eventually
earn financial independence.
The Savoyards; for example,
sell tickets to their performances
and re-use sets and costumes in
order to meet their expenses.
Originally funded by SCIRE's
the Savoyards are once again
starting to look for external in
come sources because their sets
and costumes are in need of re
placement.
