# Women join men in Stanford weight rooms
## 
### BETH COHEN 
In increasing numbers,
women are lifting weights right
along with men in Stanford's
weight rooms.
Although there is usually
about an 8-1 ratio of men to
women "pumping iron" at any
one time here, the number of
women lifters is on the rise.
"Women's interest in lifting
goes along with the general up
surge of interest in health and
fitness," said Mark Reimen, a
weight training teacher here.
Although some varsity sports
coaches require that their team
members lift weights during the
off-season, Reimen said most
women who use the weight
rooms at Encina and Roble gym
do so completely on their own.
"About three-quarters of the
women who lift at Stanford do so
as recreation, to shape up for its
own sake, or as a supplement to
other sports such as running and
swimming," Reimen said.
According to Maggie Prieto, a
woman who lifts to "firm up my
muscles and to gain endur
ance," many women lift simply
"to be strong and toned."
No other form of exercise, the
women sav, will do as much for
them.
Weightlifter Diann Richards
said that, although she also jogs
to stay in shape, "jogging will
never do for your thighs what
squats will."
After trying a number of other
fitness programs, Bonnie Hahn
has decided that weightlifting is
the only fitness program that
works for her.
"This really works for me. I
have been training with weights
for the last six months and I love
it," she said.
These women agree that, al
though it can be painful at first,
weightlifting eventually be
comes addictive.
"Like any conditioning, at first
it is painful and not fun," Prieto
explained. "It takes discipline
and nobody is going to tell you
that you must lift a certain
number of pounds. But after a
while, like running or swim
ming, it starts feeling good as a
workout and it becomes enjoy
able in itself."
Surprisingly, many of the
women are more interested in
gaining tone than in losing
weight.
According to Joe Weider, the
man who trained Arnold
Schwartzenegger and The In
credible Hulk, "even if you don't
lose weight you will look and

feel slimmer because your body
will become more dense, more
compact."
One of the female lifters said
that she wants to make her body
like a "sculpture. I want to see if I
can make my body do that."
Catherine Quoyeser, a super
visor at Encina, said that she be
came interested in weightlifting
after her brother, who had been
lifting since he was 12, encour
aged her.
"Men who lift don't have any
excess on their bodies. They are
much broader in the shoulders
than the waist and I'd like to be
built that way too," she said.
Because, as one of the women
said, in our society "muscles are
not feminine," the women said
that friends are sometimes less
than enthusiastic about their
weightlifting.
"When I tell people what I'm
doing the response is 'Oh, far
out I' But that's because I don't
have any of the muscles yet,"
one woman said. "I've heard a

lot of people, women as well as
men, look at pictures of com
petitive women body builders
and say, 'That's really gross.'"
Richards said, however, that
the men in the Stanford
weightrooms have been suppor
tive. "It's actually a real credit to
the men at Stanford that I never
feel uncomfortable in the train
ing room," Richards said.
Prieto said that her initial self
consciousness has disappeared.
She said that when she began
at Encina she "was a bit self
conscious, although I admit that
it came from within myself." But
she said she soon realized that
"people really don't pay that
much attention to one another
because it is such an individual
sport."
In fact, Reimen said, men are
often more self-conscious in the
weight rooms than women.
When one male lifter sees
another watching, Reimen said,
"sometimes they tend to per
form, while women tend to

train."
He also noted that men often
try to lift more weight than is safe
for them, while women stick to
repetitions of smaller weights.
Quoyeser said that male
weightlifters at Stanford have
treated her better than their
counterparts in other parts of
the country.
"I've lifted in gyms in Houston
where men were actually hostile
to me. They would cut in front of
me or would patronize me, but
at Stanford I've never had to put
up with any of that," Quoyeser
said. "I don't feel self-conscious
here becaue I know what I'm
doing and I'm strong."
However, Quoyeser admitted
that the first trip to the weight
room can be an intimidating ex
perience for a woman.
As a weight room supervisor,
though, Quoyeser said she
hopes she can make the weight !
lifting experience less scary.
Many women take that first
step into the weight room as part

of a weight training class.
Stanford has offered general
weight training classes for many
years, but, Reimen said, few
women entered the classes,
perhaps because they were af
raid to join a class full of men.
"So we began an experimental
class specifically for women. It is
geared to take into account spe
cial considerations for women
who want to lift weights and to
help women avoid any of the
self-consciousness they might
feel when first going into the
training room," Reimen
explained.
Offered at Stanford for a year
now, the women's weight train
ing classes cover all the topics
the men's classes cover, but also
discuss the effects of weight lift
ing on menstrual cycles, pre
gnancy and weight control.
"Already," Reimen said, "the
classes have been a huge suc
cess. Enrollment is limited to 40
and we still have (waiting) lists
form."

along with men in Stanford's
weight rooms.
Although there is usually
about an 8-1 ratio of men to
women "pumping iron" at any
one time here, the number of
women lifters is on the rise.
"Women's interest in lifting
goes along with the general up
surge of interest in health and
fitness," said Mark Reimen, a
weight training teacher here.
Although some varsity sports
coaches require that their team
members lift weights during the
off-season, Reimen said most
women who use the weight
rooms at Encina and Roble gym
do so completely on their own.
"About three-quarters of the
women who lift at Stanford do so
as recreation, to shape up for its
own sake, or as a supplement to
other sports such as running and
swimming," Reimen said.
According to Maggie Prieto, a
woman who lifts to "firm up my
muscles and to gain endur
ance," many women lift simply
"to be strong and toned."
No other form of exercise, the
women sav, will do as much for
them.
Weightlifter Diann Richards
said that, although she also jogs
to stay in shape, "jogging will
never do for your thighs what
squats will."
After trying a number of other
fitness programs, Bonnie Hahn
has decided that weightlifting is
the only fitness program that
works for her.
"This really works for me. I
have been training with weights
for the last six months and I love
it," she said.
These women agree that, al
though it can be painful at first,
weightlifting eventually be
comes addictive.
"Like any conditioning, at first
it is painful and not fun," Prieto
explained. "It takes discipline
and nobody is going to tell you
that you must lift a certain
number of pounds. But after a
while, like running or swim
ming, it starts feeling good as a
workout and it becomes enjoy
able in itself."
Surprisingly, many of the
women are more interested in
gaining tone than in losing
weight.
According to Joe Weider, the
man who trained Arnold
Schwartzenegger and The In
credible Hulk, "even if you don't
lose weight you will look and

feel slimmer because your body
will become more dense, more
compact."
One of the female lifters said
that she wants to make her body
like a "sculpture. I want to see if I
can make my body do that."
Catherine Quoyeser, a super
visor at Encina, said that she be
came interested in weightlifting
after her brother, who had been
lifting since he was 12, encour
aged her.
"Men who lift don't have any
excess on their bodies. They are
much broader in the shoulders
than the waist and I'd like to be
built that way too," she said.
Because, as one of the women
said, in our society "muscles are
not feminine," the women said
that friends are sometimes less
than enthusiastic about their
weightlifting.
"When I tell people what I'm
doing the response is 'Oh, far
out I' But that's because I don't
have any of the muscles yet,"
one woman said. "I've heard a

lot of people, women as well as
men, look at pictures of com
petitive women body builders
and say, 'That's really gross.'"
Richards said, however, that
the men in the Stanford
weightrooms have been suppor
tive. "It's actually a real credit to
the men at Stanford that I never
feel uncomfortable in the train
ing room," Richards said.
Prieto said that her initial self
consciousness has disappeared.
She said that when she began
at Encina she "was a bit self
conscious, although I admit that
it came from within myself." But
she said she soon realized that
"people really don't pay that
much attention to one another
because it is such an individual
sport."
In fact, Reimen said, men are
often more self-conscious in the
weight rooms than women.
When one male lifter sees
another watching, Reimen said,
"sometimes they tend to per
form, while women tend to

train."
He also noted that men often
try to lift more weight than is safe
for them, while women stick to
repetitions of smaller weights.
Quoyeser said that male
weightlifters at Stanford have
treated her better than their
counterparts in other parts of
the country.
"I've lifted in gyms in Houston
where men were actually hostile
to me. They would cut in front of
me or would patronize me, but
at Stanford I've never had to put
up with any of that," Quoyeser
said. "I don't feel self-conscious
here becaue I know what I'm
doing and I'm strong."
However, Quoyeser admitted
that the first trip to the weight
room can be an intimidating ex
perience for a woman.
As a weight room supervisor,
though, Quoyeser said she
hopes she can make the weight !
lifting experience less scary.
Many women take that first
step into the weight room as part

of a weight training class.
Stanford has offered general
weight training classes for many
years, but, Reimen said, few
women entered the classes,
perhaps because they were af
raid to join a class full of men.
"So we began an experimental
class specifically for women. It is
geared to take into account spe
cial considerations for women
who want to lift weights and to
help women avoid any of the
self-consciousness they might
feel when first going into the
training room," Reimen
explained.
Offered at Stanford for a year
now, the women's weight train
ing classes cover all the topics
the men's classes cover, but also
discuss the effects of weight lift
ing on menstrual cycles, pre
gnancy and weight control.
"Already," Reimen said, "the
classes have been a huge suc
cess. Enrollment is limited to 40
and we still have (waiting) lists
form."
