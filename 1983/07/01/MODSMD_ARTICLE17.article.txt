# The 						Store: capitalism and corncob pipes
## 
### BERNARD ANDERSON 
Whether it's the New York
Times or High Times, a tin of
soup or a styptic pencil, a coke, a
condom, beef jerky or a bagel,
Stanford's living museum of
contemporary consumable will
give you satisfaction.
There are parts of your child
hood on sale. Memories. Cul
tural icons. All this in addition to
the exotic and esoteric.
You can buy the traditional
two ounce box of Animal Crac
kers with the string holder for 49
cents. Old friends await you:
Hershev bars, Nabisco Fig New
tons and Oreos, Mad Magazine
(directly under the Picasso print
to the right as you enter), pop
corn, Hostess Twinkies. Fresh
squeezed orange juice and a
Frisbee.
This bazaar of choices re
minds us of our own priorities
and pr e - o c c up a t i on s .
Thousands of tastes, smells, ex
periences and ideas are com
pacted into five aisles and a few
hundred square feet. An Ameri
can flag hangs prominently over
the dairy case. Here is a life-style
on display. Capitalism. Free en
terprise. Decadence. In
dulgence. Sensory delight. But
most of all, the shelves can be
read as a statement about our
incredible wealth and freedom.
Do you want tweezers? Slant
tip, square tip or splinter tip?
Between the mothballs and
the shaving equipment just
above the light bulbs and shoe
polish, there are three metal
baskets of No Nonsense Regal
Panty Hose, Sheer-to-Waist
Panty Hose, and No Nonsense
Wide Bank Knee-Highs.
Keep an eye out for the fettu
cini, Finnish jelly drops, the
toothpicks along side the liquid
plant food, the "Genuine

Rawhide Outdoor Bootlaces,"
and the odor-destroying com
fort sole inserts.
Specialty items are not cheap.
Seven ounces of Hand-Made
Famous Amos Chocolate Chip
Cookies With Macadamia Nuts
in the "Cute Litt'l Bag" will set
you back $2.89. Pediculicide
which "kills head, crab and body
lice and their eees on contact" is

priced at $4.95 for two ounces.
Five-eighths of an ounce of Bar
bara's Unsulphered Dried Apple
is 45 cents.
There are 17 kinds of deodor
ants on sale, 14 choices for
toothpaste, and 13 brands of
shampoo. I counted 11 types of
anti-bacterial soap or acne
treatments. There are nine var
ieties of razors and eight kinds of
feminine pads in stock. Twelve
small shelves are devoted to im
ported cigars and pipe tobacco.

Who will buy the 18 large bottles
of Cutex Nail Polish Remover?
The Store caters to the per
sonal hygiene needs of a large,
young, cosmopolitan and very
finicky clientele. The distinction
between a luxury and a necessity
is totally blurred.
Athletes or "jocks" buy most
of the Hostess confections. Fruit

pies are the most popular.
Everyone loves the cold soda.
On a busy day, The Store will go
through more than 35 cartons.
Other big items are Vivarin
and No-Doz during exams. Viva
rin is the more popular. It gives
you 16 tablets of 200 mg. of caf
feine for $2.19 as compared to
No-Doz stimulants of 100 mg. in
a 36 tablet box for $3.29. The

Store can't keep up with the de
mand at the end of the quarter.
The best selling magazines are
Clamour, Vogue, Mademoiselle
and Bazaar.
A quick browse through some
of the 95 titles on display will
give you information on "How
to Capture a Honey Bee
Swarm," Ingmar Bergman's new
film Franny and Alexander, or
socialism in Africa. Ms. features

a lead article on "Teen Sex."
Macho Guns & Ammo con
trasts nicely with Dance
Magazine. If you want to know
how "Mary Tyler Moore under
went an unexpected conversion
in taste during the collaboration
process," you've got to spend
$4.50 for the latest edition of Ar
chitectural Digest.
Clamour magazine advertises
"Instant Swimsuit Makeovers
for Bulges, Jiggles, Droops and

Sags." G.Q. features Australian
Mel Cibson, football Australian
style, and "down-under won
ders."
The Store has six shelves of
vitamins and all contact lens ac
coutrements. You can buy 36
styrofoam cups for $1.49 or a
Missouri Meerschaum Genuine
American corn cob pipe for
$1.95.
Hand-written notes posted
around The Store remind you
about the frozen Mars Bars, that
no personal checks are ac
cepted, and the Oui, Penthouse,
Playboy and Playgirl are behind
the counter â€” along with a full
range of cigarettes, a flashlight, a
whistle, colored leg bands and
Kodak film.
Vou can buy ear wax remover
or ear plugs, a sun reflector or
sun screen lotion, high
cholesterol refined sugar Pep
peridge Farm cookies (nine
shelves of them) or a one pound
package of Famous Food of Vir
ginia Wholesome Fig Bars for
$1.99.
Whet your appetite with
cheddar, bonbel, gruyere, pro
cessed, bleu, cream, parmesan
or one of three kinds of
mozarella chesses. Alterna
tively, buy 16 time-release cap
sules for $4.69 to suppress appe
tites.
In addition to the brand name
sweets, meats and drinks,
American society can be evoked
by an enumeration of head-ache
pills and gastric remedies. For
example: Bufferin, Anacin, Ex
cedrin, Tylenol, Alka-Seltzer,
Milk of Magnesia, Pepto-Bismol,
Ex-Lax, Kaopectate and
Preparation-H.
The Store has lozenges to
anesthetize your throat or wake
it up. There is the humble

three-cent Tootsie Roll and the
three-foot-long licorice whip for
only 30 cents. You can pig your
self on candy corn, liver saus
age, granola bars or chocolate
kisses ($1.30 for six ounces).
There is no admission to The

Store. It is a gallery you guide
yourself through. There are nine
chill boxes to explore. It took me
a long time to find the Cracker
Jacks. I never located any eye
wash. There is at least an alterna
tive to Skippy Peanut Butter. But
can we really tolerate only one
kind of mustard (French's) and
only two kinds of pickles (sweet
and Kosher dill)?
