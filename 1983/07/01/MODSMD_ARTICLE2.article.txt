# University unclear on draft-loan link

### TIM GRIEVE 
Financial aid officials here are uncertain
how they will respond to the Supreme
Court's decision to allow the government to
require colleges to check students' draft re
gistration compliance in order to qualify for
federal loans.
"We're not sure what we're going to have
to do," said Vincent DeAnda, associate di
rector of financial aid. "We have to wait until
we hear from the Office of Education, but it
looks like we may have to go out and collect
the paperwork. We just don't know what it's
going to come down to yet."
But the University will continue its policy
of meeting all undergraduates' de
monstrated financial aid, regardless of com-

pliance with the registration laws, DeAnda
said.
In Wednesday's decision, the justices ex
tended a stay granted week on a Min
nesota federal court's decision to stop im
plementation of the Solomon Amendment.
This amendment, passed in September,
linked federal student loan money to com
pliance with registration with the Selective
Service.
DeAnda said that the Court's decision is
distressing but not surprising.
"It's not really surprising. We're dis
traught that they moved on it one day and we
have to move on it the next."
DeAnda said the situation is confusing be

cause of the on-again, off-again status of the
amendment.
"With the court ruling in Minnesota, we
stopped (plans to collect the compliance in
formation). But then it came back. It sounds
like now we'll have to do a mailing and ask
for the (Selective Service) numbers."
It is difficult to say how many students will
be affected by the Court's temporal / stay.
"We're not sure how many students fit in
that category (of having not registered). We
could speculate how many are eligible for
the draft, but we don't know what percen
tage have not registered" or how many oi
those have applied forfederal loans, he said.
DeAnda said his office may
have to contact all males who re
ceive financial aid this summer.
"We only have to collect the
information on people who are
receiving federal aid, but some
times it's easier to collect the in
formation from everyone. We
don't always know who will re
ceice federal aid," he explained.
He said he does not think the
loss of federal aid for non
registrants will present too large
of a drain on the University's fi
nancial aid funds.
