# Pros learn more at publishing course

### CAROL PUTNAM 
By the time the sixth annual
Stanford Publishing Course
ends today, participants will
have had the chance to talk with
experts in publishing, discuss
their careers and design their
own publications.
Sponsored by the Stanford
Alumni Association, the course
has attracted participants from
27 states and 12 countries who
want to learn more about pub
lishing.
But this is not a course for
amateurs.
"We don't want to duplicate
the Radcliffe course which is de
signed specifically for recent
(college) graduates," explained
Delia VanHeyst, the course's di
rector. "Ours is for the middle
management rank. The average
age of the participants is 34 and
most have six to eight years of
experience in the publishing
world."
Through a combination of lec
tures, workshops and special
projects, the participants—
editors, publishers, reporters,
free lance writers, poets, photo
graphers, consultants and
designers—learn more about
their own fields of expertise as
well as others, establish con
tacts, learn problem-solving
techniques and exchange ideas

and experiences with other pro
fessionals in the publishing in
dustry.
The course is divided into
three parts: editing, design and
production, and finance and
marketing. In addition, each
participant must create his own
mock publicationsby the end of
the course.
"The participants are really
competitive and secretive about
their projects. It's exciting to see
what they come up with. Last
year, one group came up with a
magazine called Let's Eat Food.
The publication would be about
the size of TV Guide and sold at
the check-out stand, containing
articles pertaining to supermar
ket products," VanHeyst said.
With a faculty to student ratio
near one-to-one, participants in
the 12-day program have the
chance to discuss their interests
informally with the experts.
According to one student, the
teachers "leave trails of ideas for
the students to pick up and fol
low."
The program opened last
week with a reception and din
ner featuring Esquire editor
Harold Hayes. But the big names
in publishing didn't stop there.
Pulitzer-prize winning jour
nalist Harrison Salisbury, Stan
ford faculty member and Con

ceptual Blockbusting author
James Adams, GEO's Art Direc
tor Mary Bauman and One Day
in the Life of Australia publisher
Rick Smolan are all among the
program's core faculty and
speakers.
Once outside of their lec
tures, the professionals took
time out to talk about their own
publications, the frustrations of
the publisher-writer relation
ship and the future of the pub
lishing industry.
Formerly an associate art di
rector for Life magazine, CEO's
Bauman sees her new home as a
combination of National Geog
raphic and Life.
"In GEO, pictures and stories
work together so that each com

plements the other," she
explained.
Smolan discussed the frustra
tion of the publisher
photographer relationship.
He told of an assignment he
had for GEO magazine to photo
graph Amerasians, the offspring
of American Gls and Asian wo
men, in Korea.
Because GEO editors were
concerned at the time about the
negative impact controversial ar
ticles could have on the
magazine's circulation, they re
fused to run Smolan's "most
provocative" photographs—
those of American Gls with
Asian prostitutes.
"I was so angry, I wanted to
withdraw the story completely.

They were missing the whole
point," Smolan said
"Here was a story that could
have had an effect on its readers
and they wanted to cut the part
that would have the greatest im
pact."
Smolan eventually agreed to
have the article appear in
CEO—but without his name.
As for the future of publish
ing, the experts said they believe
that computers will play a
major—but not detrimental—
role.
Smolan, who carries a three
pound word processor in his
shoulder bag, said that comput
ers will fill a need for quick, cur
rent information but will not
eliminate the print media.
