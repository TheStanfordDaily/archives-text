Talking Heads are Speaking in
Tongues on their brand-new
album and we are all the better
for it. By now most of the band's
stalwart fans have become used
to the ever-changing nature of
the Talking Head's music.
Nevertheless, David Byrne's
lyrics in "Pull Up the Roots" pro
ceed to declare his band's inten
tions about this new record to
new and old fans alike: "Wilder
than the place we live in, I'll take
you there" because "I don't
mind some slight disorder,"
"Baby like to keep on playing,"
and"I hear beautiful sounds
coming outa the ground." This
new collection of songs is in
deed beautiful music and fresh
at that.
The band's musical tongues
are both diverse and fun. The
band had clearly been listening
to musics created around the en
tire world. Included in the
album is new wave from New
York, funk from America,
sythesizers from Europe, Juju
music from Nigeria's King Sunny
Ade, violin from India and re
ggae from the Carribbean. Part
of the credit must be attributed
to band members Tina
Weymouth (bass) and Chris
Frantz (drums). Tina's musician
ship, in particular, has dramati
cally improved since the days
before the Tom Tom Club. Their
playful musical ideas, first
created on the Tom Tom Club
album, are wonderfully incorpo
rated into this album by the en
tire band. The result is a pure

symphony of musical rhythms
and sounds.
The orchestral nature of the
music is definitely one of the
reasons why this album con
tinues to sound great after
countless hours of play: there is
always something new to listen
to. The album opens with "Burn
ing Down the House" (also the
band's single) which contains an
effective combination of synth
esizers, acoustic guitars and in
cessant, driving drums. My favo
rite party tune, "Making Flippy
Floppy," features a very funky
bass line and an energetic
synthesizer ending to each
verse. The song also contains a
wonderful violin solo by the
famous Indian violinist L. Shan
kar. The song and its follow-up,
"Better Than That," are two
wonderful songs to dance to.
Both songs also employ one of
my favorite Heads' techniques,
whereby the lyrics and music in
teract in ways such as Byrne's
saying "open up" prior to the
violin solo or "there she goes"
prior to some synthesizer wan
derings. It all adds to the live,
interactive, party feel of the
music. Nona Hendryx and
Dolette Mac Donald help Talking
Heads explore the possibilities
of combining rock and roll with
gospel on "Slippery People."
Our musical odyssey then
spirits us off to the islands for
some reggae in the best tradi
tions of Black Uhuru on "I Get
Wild (or) Wild Gravity" while
Byrne suggests "Let's not be

ourselves today." "Swamp" is
very reminiscent of early blues
singers and The Suburbs from
Minneapolis. David Byrne's de
vilish sounding, growling vocals
meld perfectly with the music
and lyrics of this song. "Moon
rocks," with some of Byrne's
traditionally zany lyrics, most re
semble Heads songs on earlier
albums. Nevertheless, this song
also shows the evolutionary na
ture of the band's music by in
corporating synthesizer-created
steel drums and some funky
bass work into the Talking
Heads' New York-New Wave
sound. It also contains a tiny, de
light fully fun, Michael
Jacksonish "Woo!" and an
ultra-hip "Vo! I could do that."
The album closes with a beautiful
love song entitled "This Could
Be the Place." The song's subti
tle accurately describes its
music, "Naive Melody." There

latively spare instrumentation
and prominent, well-sung vocal,
reminds me of the Police's re
cent releases. It may be a naive
melody, but it also provides a
stark contrast to some of the
musical strains heard earlier.
While David Byrne has stated
that his lyrics are subordinate to
the music of the band, the
song's lyrical tongues neverthe
less offer some telling glimpses
at the problems of surviving in
this modern world. In "Making
Flippy Floppy," he warns us
"Our President's crazy
. . . Don't believe what you
read, there are no big secrets,"
and in "Burning Down the
House," "I don't know whatyou
expect, staring into the TV set."
Finally, while it may be uninten
tional, given Byrne's stated proc
livity for simply singing phrases
that sound right, the lyrics of the
final song, "This Must Be the
Place," sound like some sort of
personal conclusion to me:
"Never for money, Always for
love . . Home is where I want to

be." The lyrics on Speaking In
Tongues certainly are not classic
literature, but they do contain
some accurate metaphors about
modern life. As such, they add to
the overall artistic effort.
This album was finished six
months ago, but was delayed
because of the band's attempts
to include an innovative cover
with the record. They commis
sioned the artist Robert Raus
chenberg to create a unique
cover, but the result proved so
expensive that it is only available
on special editions of the album.
As a result, extra time was re
quired for David Byrne to paint
the cover that is seen on the reg
ular priced albums. And since
you cassette-users won't get all
of Byrne's art work or the lyric
sheet, the cassette version of the
album contains extended ver
sions of some other songs.
While Speaking In Tongues may
have been delayed in delighting
our ears, don't you delay in get
ting it.

derings. It all adds to the live,
interactive, party feel of the
music. Nona Hendryx and
Dolette Mac Donald help Talking
Heads explore the possibilities
of combining rock and roll with
gospel on "Slippery People."
Our musical odyssey then
spirits us off to the islands for
some reggae in the best tradi
tions of Black Uhuru on "I Get
Wild (or) Wild Gravity" while
Byrne suggests "Let's not be

ourselves today." "Swamp" is
very reminiscent of early blues
singers and The Suburbs from
Minneapolis. David Byrne's de
vilish sounding, growling vocals
meld perfectly with the music
and lyrics of this song. "Moon
rocks," with some of Byrne's
traditionally zany lyrics, most re
semble Heads songs on earlier
albums. Nevertheless, this song
also shows the evolutionary na
ture of the band's music by in
corporating synthesizer-created
steel drums and some funky
bass work into the Talking
Heads' New York-New Wave
sound. It also contains a tiny, de
light fully fun, Michael
Jacksonish "Woo!" and an
ultra-hip "Vo! I could do that."
The album closes with a beautiful
love song entitled "This Could
Be the Place." The song's subti
tle accurately describes its
music, "Naive Melody." There

latively spare instrumentation
and prominent, well-sung vocal,
reminds me of the Police's re
cent releases. It may be a naive
melody, but it also provides a
stark contrast to some of the
musical strains heard earlier.
While David Byrne has stated
that his lyrics are subordinate to
the music of the band, the
song's lyrical tongues neverthe
less offer some telling glimpses
at the problems of surviving in
this modern world. In "Making
Flippy Floppy," he warns us
"Our President's crazy
. . . Don't believe what you
read, there are no big secrets,"
and in "Burning Down the
House," "I don't know whatyou
expect, staring into the TV set."
Finally, while it may be uninten
tional, given Byrne's stated proc
livity for simply singing phrases
that sound right, the lyrics of the
final song, "This Must Be the
Place," sound like some sort of
personal conclusion to me:
"Never for money, Always for
love . . Home is where I want to

be." The lyrics on Speaking In
Tongues certainly are not classic
literature, but they do contain
some accurate metaphors about
modern life. As such, they add to
the overall artistic effort.
This album was finished six
months ago, but was delayed
because of the band's attempts
to include an innovative cover
with the record. They commis
sioned the artist Robert Raus
chenberg to create a unique
cover, but the result proved so
expensive that it is only available
on special editions of the album.
As a result, extra time was re
quired for David Byrne to paint
the cover that is seen on the reg
ular priced albums. And since
you cassette-users won't get all
of Byrne's art work or the lyric
sheet, the cassette version of the
album contains extended ver
sions of some other songs.
While Speaking In Tongues may
have been delayed in delighting
our ears, don't you delay in get
ting it.
Talking Heads are Speaking in
Tongues on their brand-new
album and we are all the better
for it. By now most of the band's
stalwart fans have become used
to the ever-changing nature of
the Talking Head's music.
Nevertheless, David Byrne's
lyrics in "Pull Up the Roots" pro
ceed to declare his band's inten
tions about this new record to
new and old fans alike: "Wilder
than the place we live in, I'll take
you there" because "I don't
mind some slight disorder,"
"Baby like to keep on playing,"
and"I hear beautiful sounds
coming outa the ground." This
new collection of songs is in
deed beautiful music and fresh
at that.
The band's musical tongues
are both diverse and fun. The
band had clearly been listening
to musics created around the en
tire world. Included in the
album is new wave from New
York, funk from America,
sythesizers from Europe, Juju
music from Nigeria's King Sunny
Ade, violin from India and re
ggae from the Carribbean. Part
of the credit must be attributed
to band members Tina
Weymouth (bass) and Chris
Frantz (drums). Tina's musician
ship, in particular, has dramati
cally improved since the days
before the Tom Tom Club. Their
playful musical ideas, first
created on the Tom Tom Club
album, are wonderfully incorpo
rated into this album by the en
tire band. The result is a pure

symphony of musical rhythms
and sounds.
The orchestral nature of the
music is definitely one of the
reasons why this album con
tinues to sound great after
countless hours of play: there is
always something new to listen
to. The album opens with "Burn
ing Down the House" (also the
band's single) which contains an
effective combination of synth
esizers, acoustic guitars and in
cessant, driving drums. My favo
rite party tune, "Making Flippy
Floppy," features a very funky
bass line and an energetic
synthesizer ending to each
verse. The song also contains a
wonderful violin solo by the
famous Indian violinist L. Shan
kar. The song and its follow-up,
"Better Than That," are two
wonderful songs to dance to.
Both songs also employ one of
my favorite Heads' techniques,
whereby the lyrics and music in
teract in ways such as Byrne's
saying "open up" prior to the
violin solo or "there she goes"
prior to some synthesizer wan
derings. It all adds to the live,
interactive, party feel of the
music. Nona Hendryx and
Dolette Mac Donald help Talking
Heads explore the possibilities
of combining rock and roll with
gospel on "Slippery People."
