Talking Heads are Speaking in
Tongues on their brand-new
album and we are all the better
for it. By now most of the band's
stalwart fans have become used
to the ever-changing nature of
the Talking Head's music.
Nevertheless, David Byrne's
lyrics in "Pull Up the Roots" pro
ceed to declare his band's inten
tions about this new record to
new and old fans alike: "Wilder
than the place we live in, I'll take
you there" because "I don't
mind some slight disorder,"
"Baby like to keep on playing,"
and"I hear beautiful sounds
coming outa the ground." This
new collection of songs is in
deed beautiful music and fresh
at that.
The band's musical tongues
are both diverse and fun. The
band had clearly been listening
to musics created around the en
tire world. Included in the
album is new wave from New
York, funk from America,
sythesizers from Europe, Juju
music from Nigeria's King Sunny
Ade, violin from India and re
ggae from the Carribbean. Part
of the credit must be attributed
to band members Tina
Weymouth (bass) and Chris
Frantz (drums). Tina's musician
ship, in particular, has dramati
cally improved since the days
before the Tom Tom Club. Their
playful musical ideas, first
created on the Tom Tom Club
album, are wonderfully incorpo
rated into this album by the en
tire band. The result is a pure

symphony of musical rhythms
and sounds.
The orchestral nature of the
music is definitely one of the
reasons why this album con
tinues to sound great after
countless hours of play: there is
always something new to listen
to. The album opens with "Burn
ing Down the House" (also the
band's single) which contains an
effective combination of synth
esizers, acoustic guitars and in
cessant, driving drums. My favo
rite party tune, "Making Flippy
Floppy," features a very funky
bass line and an energetic
synthesizer ending to each
verse. The song also contains a
wonderful violin solo by the
famous Indian violinist L. Shan
kar. The song and its follow-up,
"Better Than That," are two
wonderful songs to dance to.
Both songs also employ one of
my favorite Heads' techniques,
whereby the lyrics and music in
teract in ways such as Byrne's
saying "open up" prior to the
violin solo or "there she goes"
prior to some synthesizer wan
derings. It all adds to the live,
interactive, party feel of the
music. Nona Hendryx and
Dolette Mac Donald help Talking
Heads explore the possibilities
of combining rock and roll with
gospel on "Slippery People."
Our musical odyssey then
spirits us off to the islands for
some reggae in the best tradi
tions of Black Uhuru on "I Get
Wild (or) Wild Gravity" while
Byrne suggests "Let's not be
