# Morse beats odds, leaves Waldorf in the dust
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Last Saturday night at San
Francisco's Old Waldorf marked
both a beginning and an end.
Guitarist Steve Morse, the
mastermind behind the instru
mental group the Dregs, drum
mer Rod Morganstein, also from
the Dregs, and bassist Jerry
Peaks, a newcomer to the scene,
played before an audience for
the first time as the Steve Morse
Group.
Saturday night was also the

last Saturday night show at the
Old Waldorf, which closes this
week. In place of the venerable
night club, owner Bill Graham
will move to a new home called
Wolfgang's (formerly known as
the Boarding House) located at
901 Columbus in North Beach.
Needless to say, both occurr
ences were for the better. It is
nice to see Steve Morse finally
exhibit his unequaled talent and
it is even nicer to see the
Waldorf—haven of cramped and

uncomfortable evenings—shut
its doors forever.
Morse will be sorry to see the
Waldorf crowd go. The packed
house gave the guitarist and his
drummer/bassist combo stand
ing ovation after standing ova
tion while Morse returned the
favor with "thank you" after
"thank you." And the roaring
ovations were all earned.
What made Morse's gracious
reception at the Waldorf even
more amazing was that all odds

were against him. Since Morse ,
was an integral part of the Dregs, i
the sold-out house couldn't help I
but compare his trio to that
five-piece band with a violin.
However, near the end of the
show, one especially vocal per
son yelled out the verdict:
"Steve, you don't need no vio
lin."
The character of the Dregs is
certainly gone, but the music by
any stretch of the imagination
isn't. Morse and Company

adapted old Dregs songs, usu
ally performecMby a band of five,
to their trio brilliantly. Morse,
with his lightening-fast but at the
same time melodic guitar riffs,
played both the lead and rhythm
parts to perfection while Mor
ganstein's drums sounded like a
drummer and percussionist in
one.
Few groups have made it in
the rock world in the 1980s as
just a trio; for every Police, there


Mark Zeigler/Daily
are a dozen Journey's or Styx's.
While the Steve Morse Band
probably won't reach the popu
larity of the Police, it certainly
won't flounder like the mul
titudes who've tried.
Even less in Morse and Co.'s
favor was the plain, simple fact
that they had to play in the Wal
dorf. To win a crowd over like
the Steve Morse Band did in
such primitive seating and ser
vice conditions was a small mira
cle.
Those in the crowd won't miss
the sardine can of a nigthclub
one bit. But where else can you
pay $10-plus to sit in uncomfort
able wooden chairs two miles
from stage and next to a pair of
stoners on the left, two drunks
to the right and a couple pas
sionately necking across the ta
ble?

The real talk of the town
Saturday night wasn't that the
Dregs, formerly the Dixie Dregs,
appear to have broken up. It
wasn't that Morse had put to
gether a three-man band with
Dregs drummer Morganstein.
And it wasn't that Saturday night
was the last Saturday night show
at the Old Waldorf.
The talk of the town was that
Steve Morse had talked. Morse
actually said words through a
microphone on stage during
a concert to a Bay Area crowd,
an unprecedented event.
In past Dregs concerts, only
bassist Andy West spoke during
the show, and even that was li
mited to short spurts every four
songs or so. Morse, however,
spoke and spoke and spoke. He
was funny, he was serious. In
fact, the fact that he spoke liter
ally stole the show.
But Morse can play an instru
ment called the electric guitar
pretty well too.
