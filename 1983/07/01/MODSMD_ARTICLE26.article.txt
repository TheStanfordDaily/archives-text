City Lights (1931) *
Festival, Palo Alto
The structure of this beloved
Chaplin picture, his penultimate
silent, is basic Victorian melod
rama: theTramp falls in love with
a blind girl (Virginia Cherrill) who
sells flowers on the street, gets
money to pay her rent so that she
won't be evicted, pays for an op
eration to restore her sight, goes
to jail for stealing the money even
though he obtained it honestly,
etc. This is a very erratic movie —
some of the more elaborately set
up gags don't soar, much of it is
drenched in sentimentality, yet
some of the comedy is inspired
and the last five minutes, when
the girl learns the identity of her
benefactor, is almost as great as
the best scenes in D.W. Griffith.
As a whole, City Lights is an
exemplary blend of Chaplin's vir
tues and faults. (Reading the
piece "A Feeling of Sad Dignity"
in Robert Warshow's The Im
mediate Experience enhances
the experience of watching the
movie.)
Plays through Wednesday with
Modern Times.
Ugetsu (1954) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Kenji Mizoguchi pitched his
exquisitely stylized fable right on
the boundary between fairy tale
and nightmare. The hauntingly
beautiful Machiko Kyo (the
woman in Rashomon) plays Lady
Wakasa, a ghost who tempts a
peasant (Masayuki Mori) away
from his wife (Kinuyo Tanaka).
The acting is often extraordinary,
especially from the two women.
Mizoguchi was a painter before
he became a filmmaker, but even
more astonishing than the com
positions in this strange, erotic
movie is the often shocking edit
ing-
Plays Monday and Tuesday
with Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo.

Modern Times (1936) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
By 1936, no Hollywood studio
had made a silent picture in eight
years, but Charles Chaplin had
still not released a talkie when he j
wrote, directed and starred in
this proletarian comedy, though
he did add a musical soundtrack,
composed by Chaplin, of course,
and featuring the sentimental
popular ballad "Smile (Though
Your Heart Is Breaking)." (His
first talkie, The Great Dictator,
didn't come out until 1940.) This
obstinacy may seem perverse —
until you see the movie. Chaplin
was clearly inspired by Rene
Clair's 1931 A Nous la Liberie

(particularly in the factory sequ
ence). Paulette Goddard, one of
his few decent leading ladies and
one of his several wives, plays the
Gamine, and the fair-sized sup
porting cast includes Chester
Conklin and Henry Bergman.
Plays through Wednesday with
City Lights.

The Gold Rush (1925) ★
Fox, Redwood City
Charles Chaplin's justly fam
ous comedy, in which he plays a
prospector who seeks his fortune
in Alaska, with Mack Swain as the
villain and Georgia Hale as the
dance hall girl, as well as Tom
Murray, Henry Bergman, Mal
colm Waite and Betty Morrissey.
The scene in which Chaplin boils
and eats his shoe is one of the
most remarkable (and delicate)
examples of physical comedy
ever photographed.
Plays Wednesday with Tillie's
Punctured Romance.

The Deer Hunter (1979) ★
Memorial Auditorium
Michael Cimino's astonish
ingly powerful (and extremely
controversial) movie about the
effects of a Vietnamese P.O.W.
camp on three buddies from a
Pennsylvania steel town gives off
both left-wing and right-wing
vibrations. Politically it's a mess,
and it is fuelled by a particularly
inscrutable brand of Machismo,
but Cimino and Deric Washburn
(who collaborated with him on the
script) make an honest attempt to
grapple with the Vietnam experi
ence. The film flounders out of
an understandable inability to as
similate a far too recent night
mare; it isn't a hard sell (as many
outraged critics have claimed).
As the survivor, Michael, Robert
De Niro gives a supremely intelli
gent reading of a tough, closed
off role, but the most memorable
performances are by Christopher
Walken as his best friend and
Meryl Streep as the woman they
share. With John Savage and the
late John Cazale. Vilmos Zsig
mond's meticulous cinematog
raphy helps to keep you in
terested through the overlong
opening stateside section.
Plays Sunday evening.

Come and Get It (1936)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This expensive Samuel
Goldwyn movie, out of an Edna
Ferber novel, came very early in
Frances Farmer's brief career,
and you can see why so many
people were so confident she
would have a glittering future:
she is clear-headed and unaf
fected here — an actress in the

Barbara Stanwyck-Jean Arthur
mold. Playing a dual role — a sa
loon entertainer in the Wisconsin
timberlands in the 1880 sand her
ambitious daughter — she gives a
solid, authentic performance.
And the film, scripted by Jules
Furthman and Jane Murfin, is
very amiable entertainment.
Howard Hawks directed it, and
though William Wyler came in to
finish it when Hawks and
Goldwyn fought, it has Hawks'
sense of humor — and a lively
supporting cast, including Cecil
Cunningham, Mary Nash, Mady
Christians and long-jawed Walter
Brennan, in a cheerfully fraudu
lent Swedish accent. A rollicking,
ebullient bad movie.
Plays Thursday with San Fran
cisco.
Rocky (1976),*
Fox, Redwood City
Sylvester Stallone became a
star in this Oscar-winning Cin
derella story, which he also
wrote. He plays a second-rate
boxer who gets a chance to battle
a Muhammad Ali-type champ
named Apollo Creed (Carl
Weathers). The script, an amal
gam of On the Waterfront and
Marty and Requiem for a
Heavyweight, is the sheerest
hokum: in the romantic scenes
between Rocky and Adrienne
(Talia Shire), it dredges up bits
from 42nd Street and The Rain
maker, too. Stallone has a very
appealing sense of humor, but
his serious acting parallels the
melange in the screenplay — he
does Brando mixed with Ernest
Borgnine and Anthony Quinn.
John G. Avildsen's direction is
barely serviceable (though he ral
lies in the fight scene), the
photography and art direction
are ugly, and the theme song may
be the worst ever heard in a
major movie. Vet miraculously,
through energy and an affirma
tive spirit and a very able support
' ing cast — Shire, Weathers, Burt
Young as Adrienne's brother,
and especially Burgess Meredith
as Rocky's trainer (he crawls right
inside his role) — the movie
comes together; it's a marvelous
popular entertainment.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Rocky II and Rocky 111.

Pennsylvania steel town gives off
both left-wing and right-wing
vibrations. Politically it's a mess,
and it is fuelled by a particularly
inscrutable brand of Machismo,
but Cimino and Deric Washburn
(who collaborated with him on the
script) make an honest attempt to
grapple with the Vietnam experi
ence. The film flounders out of
an understandable inability to as
similate a far too recent night
mare; it isn't a hard sell (as many
outraged critics have claimed).
As the survivor, Michael, Robert
De Niro gives a supremely intelli
gent reading of a tough, closed
off role, but the most memorable
performances are by Christopher
Walken as his best friend and
Meryl Streep as the woman they
share. With John Savage and the
late John Cazale. Vilmos Zsig
mond's meticulous cinematog
raphy helps to keep you in
terested through the overlong
opening stateside section.
Plays Sunday evening.

Come and Get It (1936)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This expensive Samuel
Goldwyn movie, out of an Edna
Ferber novel, came very early in
Frances Farmer's brief career,
and you can see why so many
people were so confident she
would have a glittering future:
she is clear-headed and unaf
fected here — an actress in the

Barbara Stanwyck-Jean Arthur
mold. Playing a dual role — a sa
loon entertainer in the Wisconsin
timberlands in the 1880 sand her
ambitious daughter — she gives a
solid, authentic performance.
And the film, scripted by Jules
Furthman and Jane Murfin, is
very amiable entertainment.
Howard Hawks directed it, and
though William Wyler came in to
finish it when Hawks and
Goldwyn fought, it has Hawks'
sense of humor — and a lively
supporting cast, including Cecil
Cunningham, Mary Nash, Mady
Christians and long-jawed Walter
Brennan, in a cheerfully fraudu
lent Swedish accent. A rollicking,
ebullient bad movie.
Plays Thursday with San Fran
cisco.
Rocky (1976),*
Fox, Redwood City
Sylvester Stallone became a
star in this Oscar-winning Cin
derella story, which he also
wrote. He plays a second-rate
boxer who gets a chance to battle
a Muhammad Ali-type champ
named Apollo Creed (Carl
Weathers). The script, an amal
gam of On the Waterfront and
Marty and Requiem for a
Heavyweight, is the sheerest
hokum: in the romantic scenes
between Rocky and Adrienne
(Talia Shire), it dredges up bits
from 42nd Street and The Rain
maker, too. Stallone has a very
appealing sense of humor, but
his serious acting parallels the
melange in the screenplay — he
does Brando mixed with Ernest
Borgnine and Anthony Quinn.
John G. Avildsen's direction is
barely serviceable (though he ral
lies in the fight scene), the
photography and art direction
are ugly, and the theme song may
be the worst ever heard in a
major movie. Vet miraculously,
through energy and an affirma
tive spirit and a very able support
' ing cast — Shire, Weathers, Burt
Young as Adrienne's brother,
and especially Burgess Meredith
as Rocky's trainer (he crawls right
inside his role) — the movie
comes together; it's a marvelous
popular entertainment.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Rocky II and Rocky 111.

City Lights (1931) *
Festival, Palo Alto
The structure of this beloved
Chaplin picture, his penultimate
silent, is basic Victorian melod
rama: theTramp falls in love with
a blind girl (Virginia Cherrill) who
sells flowers on the street, gets
money to pay her rent so that she
won't be evicted, pays for an op
eration to restore her sight, goes
to jail for stealing the money even
though he obtained it honestly,
etc. This is a very erratic movie —
some of the more elaborately set
up gags don't soar, much of it is
drenched in sentimentality, yet
some of the comedy is inspired
and the last five minutes, when
the girl learns the identity of her
benefactor, is almost as great as
the best scenes in D.W. Griffith.
As a whole, City Lights is an
exemplary blend of Chaplin's vir
tues and faults. (Reading the
piece "A Feeling of Sad Dignity"
in Robert Warshow's The Im
mediate Experience enhances
the experience of watching the
movie.)
Plays through Wednesday with
Modern Times.
Ugetsu (1954) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Kenji Mizoguchi pitched his
exquisitely stylized fable right on
the boundary between fairy tale
and nightmare. The hauntingly
beautiful Machiko Kyo (the
woman in Rashomon) plays Lady
Wakasa, a ghost who tempts a
peasant (Masayuki Mori) away
from his wife (Kinuyo Tanaka).
The acting is often extraordinary,
especially from the two women.
Mizoguchi was a painter before
he became a filmmaker, but even
more astonishing than the com
positions in this strange, erotic
movie is the often shocking edit
ing-
Plays Monday and Tuesday
with Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo.

Modern Times (1936) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
By 1936, no Hollywood studio
had made a silent picture in eight
years, but Charles Chaplin had
still not released a talkie when he j
wrote, directed and starred in
this proletarian comedy, though
he did add a musical soundtrack,
composed by Chaplin, of course,
and featuring the sentimental
popular ballad "Smile (Though
Your Heart Is Breaking)." (His
first talkie, The Great Dictator,
didn't come out until 1940.) This
obstinacy may seem perverse —
until you see the movie. Chaplin
was clearly inspired by Rene
Clair's 1931 A Nous la Liberie

(particularly in the factory sequ
ence). Paulette Goddard, one of
his few decent leading ladies and
one of his several wives, plays the
Gamine, and the fair-sized sup
porting cast includes Chester
Conklin and Henry Bergman.
Plays through Wednesday with
City Lights.

The Gold Rush (1925) ★
Fox, Redwood City
Charles Chaplin's justly fam
ous comedy, in which he plays a
prospector who seeks his fortune
in Alaska, with Mack Swain as the
villain and Georgia Hale as the
dance hall girl, as well as Tom
Murray, Henry Bergman, Mal
colm Waite and Betty Morrissey.
The scene in which Chaplin boils
and eats his shoe is one of the
most remarkable (and delicate)
examples of physical comedy
ever photographed.
Plays Wednesday with Tillie's
Punctured Romance.

The Deer Hunter (1979) ★
Memorial Auditorium
Michael Cimino's astonish
ingly powerful (and extremely
