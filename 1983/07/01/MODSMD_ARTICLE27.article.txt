Reagan debate prep scrutinized
Washington— The Justice Department said yes
terday it has instructed the FBI to conduct a full
investigation of how President Reagan's 1980 cam
paign staff obtained briefing papers prepared for
then-President Carter's use in his debate with
Reagan.
Former Carter aides have been pressing for a
broader inquiry and the announcement from the
lustice Department came shortly after one of them
suggested an expanded investigation could lead to
disclosure of more tar-rearhing Reagan access to
Carter secrets.
"We may have found the tail of the donkey and
not the donkey here," said Patrick Caddell, Car
ter's former pollster. "What if the primary issue
here was not the debate?"
Meanwhile, reporters with Reagan in Whittier,
Calif., asked him whether he should apologize to
Carter.
"I haven't done anything to apologize for," said
Reagan.
Reagan noted that he had asked for the Justice
Department investigation. "We don't know how
any of that happened, and I never knew there was
such a thing, so we will wait and find out," Reagan
said.
Pressed on whether a man-to-man apology to
Carter might be a good idea, Reagan said, "Let me
find out how that happened and who was respon
sible."
Prior to yesterday's announcement, Justice De
partment spokesperson Tom De Cair would say
only that the briefing book matter was under "ac
tive review''—without defining what that meant.
However, sources in the department, who
asked not to be identified by name, said it meant
criminal division attorneys were studying material
forwarded by the White House and in published
accounts, but that no investigation or interviews
had been authorized.
DeCair would not comment on the reasons for
changing the Justice Department characterization
from "active review" to "investigation" or on the
timing of the decision, which he said was made
Wednesday night.
FBI spokesperson Lane Bonner said, "Details of
what we are going to be doing are yet to be worked
out." Normally, however, the Justice Department
uses the FBI when an investigation calls for exten
sive interviews.
Caddell, in a telephone interview a few hours
before DeCair's announcement, said release of
hundreds of pages of documents by the White
House on Tuesday had the effect of widening, not
dampening, the controversy.
The documents show Reagan's campaign aides
had access to material intended to help Carter
prepare for the Oct. 28, 1980 debate in Cleveland.
But Caddell and David Rubenstein, Carter's de
puty assistant for domestic affairs and policy, both

raised the possibility that the Reagan campaign
had access to Carter documents other than those
prepared for the debate.
Chiefs' halfback dies a hero
Monroe, La. Joe Delaney, the Kansas City
Chiefs'starting halfback, died a hero while trying
to save three boys in a Louisiana pond.
Delaney, 24, drowned Wednesday after jump
ing into water where the boys were floundering,
according to police and eyewitnesses.
One of the boys drowned, another was in criti
cal condition at the St. Francis Medical Center and
the third, a 6-year-old, scrambled to safety.
Police said family members identified the last
body to be recovered as that of Delaney, the
Chiefs' No. 2 draft choice in 1981 who went on to
become the National Football Leagues' offensive
rookie of the year.
Assistant Police Chief E.W. Smith said the other
victim was Harry Holland Jr., 11, of Monroe.
Lancer Perkins, also 11, remained in St. Francis'
intensive care unit until he died early yesterday
morning.
The drownings occurred in publicly-owned
Chenault Park. His mother said Delaney, who fre
quently visited friends in Monroe, just happened
to be among the hundreds of people attracted by a
big free admission promotion for a privately oper
ated waterslide.
PLO rebels fight Arafat
Beirut, Lebanon—PLO mutineers have routed
Yasser Arafat's forces from most of their positions
in the central Bekaa Valley, according to reports
from eastern Lebanon, and the loyalists say Syria is
trying to drive them farther north.
Reports from the Bekaa said Palestine Liberation
Organization guerrillas rebelling against Arafat
exchanged heavy artillery fire with the PLO's chief
loyalists last night in the towns of Taanayel
and Taalabay.
There was no report of casualties in the ex
change, which lasted at least two hours.
The rebels, who began their mutiny seven
weeks ago, say Arafat has become to moderate in
his stance toward Middle East diplomatic initia
tives.
Arafat's Al Fatah supporters, from their head
quarters in the north Lebanese port of Tripoli, said
in a communique yesterday that Syrian officers
warned them to immediately clear out of Bar Elias,
on the Beirut-Damascus Highway, and Taanayel,
to the north. The communique said they refused.
However, Associated Press reporter Terry An
derson reported that Arafat's loyalists had been
ousted from Bar Elias and most of their other posi

tions in the central Bekaa during fighting the night
before.
Arafat's guerrillas still held the town of Chtaura,
but his supporters had lost all other positions
along the highway, residents said.
Al Fatah's permanent representative in Saudi
Arabia, Rafik al-Natsheh, said he asked King Fahd
to arrange a meeting between Arafat and Syrian
President Hafez Assad, who kicked the PLO chief
out of Syria last week. Arafat had accused Syria of
escalating the mutiny.
Observers have speculated that Assad wants to
control all the Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon so
they cannot drag him into another war with Israel.
In Beirut yesterday, U.S. presidential envoy
Philip Habib met Lebanese leaders to try to find a
way to convince Syria to accept the Lebanese-
Israeli withdrawal agreement. Israel insists it won't
withdraw its 28,000 soldiers from Lebanon unless
Syria removes its 50,000-person force and the
Palestinian guerrillas, estimated at 10,000 to
15,000, pull out at the same time.
Meanwhile, a Syrian Foreign Ministry spokes
man said there were no plans to receive an Ameri
can representative.
Israel invaded Lebanon a year ago, saying it
wanted to rid areas on its borders of Palestinian
guerrillas.
McEnroe advances to semifinals
Wimbledon, England—John McEnroe, struggling
to hold his temper, had no trouble disposing of
unseeded Sandy Mayer 6-3, 7-5, 6-0 to move into
the semifinals of the Wimbledon Tennis Champ
ionships.
In the other quarterfinal match, Kevin Curren
edged Tim Mayotte 4-6, 7-6, 6-2, 7-6 after a fourth
set tiebreaker and became the first South African
to reach the men's semifinals since Cliff Drysdale
in 1966. Curren will face Chris Lewis, while McEn
roe will take on Ivan Lendl.

Low clouds and fog along the coast spreading

PLO rebels fight Arafat
Beirut, Lebanon—PLO mutineers have routed
Yasser Arafat's forces from most of their positions
in the central Bekaa Valley, according to reports
from eastern Lebanon, and the loyalists say Syria is
trying to drive them farther north.
Reports from the Bekaa said Palestine Liberation
Organization guerrillas rebelling against Arafat
exchanged heavy artillery fire with the PLO's chief
loyalists last night in the towns of Taanayel
and Taalabay.
There was no report of casualties in the ex
change, which lasted at least two hours.
The rebels, who began their mutiny seven
weeks ago, say Arafat has become to moderate in
his stance toward Middle East diplomatic initia
tives.
Arafat's Al Fatah supporters, from their head
quarters in the north Lebanese port of Tripoli, said
in a communique yesterday that Syrian officers
warned them to immediately clear out of Bar Elias,
on the Beirut-Damascus Highway, and Taanayel,
to the north. The communique said they refused.
However, Associated Press reporter Terry An
derson reported that Arafat's loyalists had been
ousted from Bar Elias and most of their other posi

tions in the central Bekaa during fighting the night
before.
Arafat's guerrillas still held the town of Chtaura,
but his supporters had lost all other positions
along the highway, residents said.
Al Fatah's permanent representative in Saudi
Arabia, Rafik al-Natsheh, said he asked King Fahd
to arrange a meeting between Arafat and Syrian
President Hafez Assad, who kicked the PLO chief
out of Syria last week. Arafat had accused Syria of
escalating the mutiny.
Observers have speculated that Assad wants to
control all the Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon so
they cannot drag him into another war with Israel.
In Beirut yesterday, U.S. presidential envoy
Philip Habib met Lebanese leaders to try to find a
way to convince Syria to accept the Lebanese-
Israeli withdrawal agreement. Israel insists it won't
withdraw its 28,000 soldiers from Lebanon unless
Syria removes its 50,000-person force and the
Palestinian guerrillas, estimated at 10,000 to
15,000, pull out at the same time.
Meanwhile, a Syrian Foreign Ministry spokes
man said there were no plans to receive an Ameri
can representative.
Israel invaded Lebanon a year ago, saying it
wanted to rid areas on its borders of Palestinian
guerrillas.

Reagan debate prep scrutinized
Washington— The Justice Department said yes
terday it has instructed the FBI to conduct a full
investigation of how President Reagan's 1980 cam
paign staff obtained briefing papers prepared for
then-President Carter's use in his debate with
Reagan.
Former Carter aides have been pressing for a
broader inquiry and the announcement from the
lustice Department came shortly after one of them
suggested an expanded investigation could lead to
disclosure of more tar-rearhing Reagan access to
Carter secrets.
"We may have found the tail of the donkey and
not the donkey here," said Patrick Caddell, Car
ter's former pollster. "What if the primary issue
here was not the debate?"
Meanwhile, reporters with Reagan in Whittier,
Calif., asked him whether he should apologize to
Carter.
"I haven't done anything to apologize for," said
Reagan.
Reagan noted that he had asked for the Justice
Department investigation. "We don't know how
any of that happened, and I never knew there was
such a thing, so we will wait and find out," Reagan
said.
Pressed on whether a man-to-man apology to
Carter might be a good idea, Reagan said, "Let me
find out how that happened and who was respon
sible."
Prior to yesterday's announcement, Justice De
partment spokesperson Tom De Cair would say
only that the briefing book matter was under "ac
tive review''—without defining what that meant.
However, sources in the department, who
asked not to be identified by name, said it meant
criminal division attorneys were studying material
forwarded by the White House and in published
accounts, but that no investigation or interviews
had been authorized.
DeCair would not comment on the reasons for
changing the Justice Department characterization
from "active review" to "investigation" or on the
timing of the decision, which he said was made
Wednesday night.
FBI spokesperson Lane Bonner said, "Details of
what we are going to be doing are yet to be worked
out." Normally, however, the Justice Department
uses the FBI when an investigation calls for exten
sive interviews.
Caddell, in a telephone interview a few hours
before DeCair's announcement, said release of
hundreds of pages of documents by the White
House on Tuesday had the effect of widening, not
dampening, the controversy.
The documents show Reagan's campaign aides
had access to material intended to help Carter
prepare for the Oct. 28, 1980 debate in Cleveland.
But Caddell and David Rubenstein, Carter's de
puty assistant for domestic affairs and policy, both

raised the possibility that the Reagan campaign
had access to Carter documents other than those
prepared for the debate.
Chiefs' halfback dies a hero
Monroe, La. Joe Delaney, the Kansas City
Chiefs'starting halfback, died a hero while trying
to save three boys in a Louisiana pond.
Delaney, 24, drowned Wednesday after jump
ing into water where the boys were floundering,
according to police and eyewitnesses.
One of the boys drowned, another was in criti
cal condition at the St. Francis Medical Center and
the third, a 6-year-old, scrambled to safety.
Police said family members identified the last
body to be recovered as that of Delaney, the
Chiefs' No. 2 draft choice in 1981 who went on to
become the National Football Leagues' offensive
rookie of the year.
Assistant Police Chief E.W. Smith said the other
victim was Harry Holland Jr., 11, of Monroe.
Lancer Perkins, also 11, remained in St. Francis'
intensive care unit until he died early yesterday
morning.
The drownings occurred in publicly-owned
Chenault Park. His mother said Delaney, who fre
quently visited friends in Monroe, just happened
to be among the hundreds of people attracted by a
big free admission promotion for a privately oper
ated waterslide.
