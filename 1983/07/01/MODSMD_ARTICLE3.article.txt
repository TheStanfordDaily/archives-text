# Bookstore to open Angell field sport store
## 
### JASON COLE 
The athletic department
will close its Encina Gym store
at the end of July and hand
over that operation to the
Stanford Bookstore.
The bookstore will then
move the athletic shop and
re-open it in the Sam Mac-
Donald House on Angell
Field in September.
The decision to have the
athletic department close the
store was made almost a year
ago for a number of reasons,
according to Alan Cummings,
associate director of athle
tics.
"First, it was not a viable
financial option—we were
barely breaking even. It
seemed that the alternative
was to do a better job,"
Cummings said. "But be
cause we're an athletic de
partment and not a merchan
diser, we opted to give up the
store."
Cummings added that the
athletic department also
needed the store's space.
Some coaches and sections
of the department will move

into the area that the Encina
Gym store now occupies.
In addition, closing the
store will give the University
the opportunity to renovate
the location of the new
store—the Sam Mac Donald
House.
"Basically the building is in
rundown condition and we
didn't have the money to up
grade it," Cummings said.
Sam Mac Donald House
was formerly the office of the
track team when Angell Field
was still used for track meets.
Last year, a student lived in
the house as a caretaker.

The bookstore has signed a
30-year lease with the Univer
sity for the use of the Mac-
Donald House. The lease in
cludes what Cummings
termed "general oversight."
"We can periodically make
advice. We just want to make
sure it remains a student, staff
and faculty oriented store,"
he said.
Presently, the MacDonald
House, located at the corner
of Campus Drive and Galvez
Street, is being renovated.

RAISING THE RAFTERS: The exposed roof of the Sam
McDonald Trackhouse awaits completion. Once renovation
is completed, the old building will house a new sport shop run
by the bookstore.
vation is moving steadily
along, according to
bookstore General Manager
Eldon Speed.
Speed said he hopes the
new store will open by Sept.
10, in time for Stanford's
opening football game
against Oklahoma.
The new store will be larger
than the gym store and pro
vide a wider range of athletic
wear and equipment than is
available now, Speed said.
"The new store will be
more self-service oriented.

We will also have other ser
vices like racket stringing,"
Speed said. "We're trying to
make it a sports shop."
The campus bookstore will
continue to carry the same
souvenir materials. However,
athletic shoes will now be
sold at the new store, Speed
said.
Reaction from people
around the bookstore has
been very positive. But Speed
emphasized that the takeover
"is not a good investment
from a business standpoint.
But we're a non-profit or
ganization. We feel it's in our
interest to take the store."
