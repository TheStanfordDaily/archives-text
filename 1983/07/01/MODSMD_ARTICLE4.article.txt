# Recycling gets $16,000 to cover loss
## 
### KRISHNA WEST 
ASSU Recycling will get more
than old newspapers and empty
soft drink cans next year.
Provost Al Hastorf and William
Massy, vice president for busi
ness and finance, have allocated
$16,000 from the University's
general funds to a newly created
1983-84 ASSU recycling budget.
The allocation means that the
project will become part of the
University's annual budget and
will get more money—adjusted
for inflation—in the coming
years, Massy said.
Since its 1977 conception with
fee assessment money, the
ASSU-subsidized recycling op
eration has suffered severe fi
nancial losses, although it has
experienced a 15 percent annual
growth in volume.
ASSU Recycling lost more
than $18,000 in 1981-82 and an
ticipates a deficit of at least
$13,000 this year. By the end of
spring quarter, losses for this
year amounted to $10,480.
ASSU Student Financial Man
ager Mindy Basham said that
ASSU Recycling's financial trou
bles are not unique in the recycl
ing industry.
"It's hard to make money on
recycled goods in a sensitive
market where prices fluctuate so
much," she explained. "It's a
losingventure in a lot of places."
ASSU Senator Eric Berg ag
reed.
"The project may have run on
a break-even or profit basis for a
while in the beginning, but it
was not economically possible
for that to continue," Berg said.
"The prices of recycled materials
are extremelv sensitive to busi
ness cycles. The recession
forced these prices further
down."
In addition, labor costs eat
away a large portion of ASSU Re
cycling's money, according to
Wade Cray, one of the project's
three program managers.
"A large proportion of our
money is spent on wages and
salaries, and half the labor time
is spent sorting through the stuff

thrown in our (recycling) bins,"
Gray said.
Faced with the prospect of
dropping the recycling program
altogether because of its de
ficits, the ASSU requested finan
cial assistance from the Univer
sity.
"Recycling is an extremely
beneficial program, and we
wanted to see it continue,"
Basham said. "However, we
couldn't keep supporting the
project if it kept losing so much
money. We asked the University
for enough money to cover next
year's projected loss."

Massy agreed that it was a
"good long-term investment for
the University. The immediate
savings are theoretical, barely
noticeable. But there is a long
run potential for cost
displacement."
The ASSU appealed for finan
cial support from the University
because "we were, in effect,
hauling their trash away for
free," Gray said. "Trash hauling
and dumping is getting expen
sive, and we handle 7 percent of
all garbage dumped at the Uni
versity each year."
