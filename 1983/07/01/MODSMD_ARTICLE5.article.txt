# McCloskey praises anti-veto decision
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
The Supreme Court's decision
against the congressional veto is
"a fine decision" that will stop a
congress that "has gone way out
of line," according to Paul
"Pete" McCloskey, a former
congressman and guest profes
sor here last quarter.
"Congress is now faced with
the fact that it must carry out its
duty, which is to pass laws. And
it must realize that it can't carry
out the supervision of those
laws. Congress must accept the
rules its agencies hand down.
This decision is way overdue."
The Supreme Court ruled last
week that the so-called "legisla
tive veto" was unconstitutional
in that it violated the series of
checks and balances established
in the constitution. Congress
had written the legislative veto
into some 200 acts.
According to Political Science
Prof. Hubert Marshall, the veto
allowed congress to intervene in
decisions made by the various
regulatory agencies it had estab
lished.
That intervention, McCloskey
explained, came as a reaction to
the abuse of presidential power
by Presidents Nixon and
Johnson.

Although the decision pre
vents Congress from interven
ing further, Congress still has
the ultimate power to pass new
bills that prevent the implemen
tation of the agencies' decisions,
to limit the agencies' power or to
disband the agencies entirely,
Marshall said.
McCloskey said that Congress
may do just that in the case of the
Federal Trade Commission. Be
cause of a number of disagree


Pete McCloskey
ments with the commission over
funeral and used car advertising,
Congress is frustrated with the
agency.
"Congress may abolish the
trade commission. When the
Congress is frustrated by an
agency now, it may abolish that
agency. I don't know if that
would happen, but if Reagan
made a pitch to abolish an
agency, Congress might go
along with it," McCloskey
explained.
Marshall agreed.
"Right now Congress is down
on the Federal Trade Commis
sion so Congress will probably
say in that area that 'if we don't
have the legislative veto we're
going to take away some of your
power.' If Congress can't veto, it
will have to give more power to

those agencies it trusts," Mar
shall said.
McCloskey said that the deci
sion will force Congress to stop
passing "sloppy laws" when
creating new regulatory agen
cies because it will now have to
live with the decisions of those
agencies.
Congress will also keep some
control over presidential powers
as well, McCloskey said.
Although the Court's ruling
will eliminate Congress's power
to stop presidential arms sales,
Congress could still pass a new
law which would prevent any
arms sales.
Marshall said that he had "no
good predictions" for how Con
gress will react to the Court's
decision.
"It's a terribly complex affair.
Even the big Washington D.C.
law firms don't know what the
solution is going to be. This de
cision does mean a horrendous
change in the way things are
going to be done."
