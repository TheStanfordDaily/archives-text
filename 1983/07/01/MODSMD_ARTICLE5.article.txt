# McCloskey praises anti-veto decision

### TIM GRIEVE 
The Supreme Court's decision
against the congressional veto is
"a fine decision" that will stop a
congress that "has gone way out
of line," according to Paul
"Pete" McCloskey, a former
congressman and guest profes
sor here last quarter.
"Congress is now faced with
the fact that it must carry out its
duty, which is to pass laws. And
it must realize that it can't carry
out the supervision of those
laws. Congress must accept the
rules its agencies hand down.
This decision is way overdue."
The Supreme Court ruled last
week that the so-called "legisla
tive veto" was unconstitutional
in that it violated the series of
checks and balances established
in the constitution. Congress
had written the legislative veto
into some 200 acts.
According to Political Science
Prof. Hubert Marshall, the veto
allowed congress to intervene in
decisions made by the various
regulatory agencies it had estab
lished.
That intervention, McCloskey
explained, came as a reaction to
the abuse of presidential power
by Presidents Nixon and
Johnson.

Although the decision pre
vents Congress from interven
ing further, Congress still has
the ultimate power to pass new
bills that prevent the implemen
tation of the agencies' decisions,
to limit the agencies' power or to
disband the agencies entirely,
Marshall said.
McCloskey said that Congress
may do just that in the case of the
Federal Trade Commission. Be
cause of a number of disagree
