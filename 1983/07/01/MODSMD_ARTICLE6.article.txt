## PLO mutineers try to displace Arafat 
### 
Beirut, Lebanon—Rebels
trying to displace Yasser
Arafat as leader of the Pales
tine Liberation Organization
attacked positions held by his
men before dawn Tuesday
and overran at least two
strongholds. Fighting con
tinued through the day along
the Beirut-Damascus high
way.
The attack was described
by the PLO news agency
WAFA as a Syrian-aided effort
to wipe out Arafat's suppor
ters in the Bekaa Valley.
Tuesday's fighting was the
most serious so far between
PLO guerillas who support
Arafat and rebels who con
tend that he has become too
moderate and has turned his
back on the policy of armed
struggle to regain a Palesti
nian homeland.
Arafat aides charged again
Tuesday that Syria and Libya
are aiding the rebels, who are
commanded by Said Moussa,
better known as Col. Abu
Moussa. A former deputy
chief of operations for Fatah,
Moussa has long been a critic
of Arafat's policies, which he
and his supporters consider

too moderate.
A PLO communique ac
cused the Syrians of sur
rounding and pinning down
the Arafat loyalists, then
sending in the rebel forces
along with members of Li
byan- and Syrian-backed
guerrillas units.
The communique said Nasr
Yousef, the commander of
the PLO's Yarmouk Brigade,
was captured in the fighting
Tuesday.
By midafternoon, the re
bels had also taken the village
of El Marj, and the fighting
has shifted to the village of
Taanayel, about a mile from
the strategic town of Chtoura
on the highway about 30
miles from Beirut.
The PLO news agency also
reported that the road to the
ancient city of Baalbek had
been cut. If that is true, the
pro-Arafat forces are virtually
surrounded—by the moun
tains to the west, the Israelis
to the south and the Syrians
to the north and east. Syrian
forces are also in Chtoura,
but so far there has been no
fighting there.
