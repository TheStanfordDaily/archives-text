# East Bloc endorses Soviet missile plan
## 
### 
Moscow—The Soviet Union won a guarded en
dorsement by its six Warsaw Pact allies Tuesday for
its planned response to the scheduled deploy
ment of new U.S. nuclear missiles in Western
Europe.
A joint statement issued at the end of a one-day
meeting of the top officials of the seven Warsaw
Pact countries endorsed Moscow's view that "the
arms race is acquiring an unprecedented scope"
and that the United States is developing new
strategic weapons and seeking to deploy its new
medium-range missiles in Europe in an effort to
"attain military superiority."
The tone of the joint statement, distributed by
the official news agency Tass, was unusually mod
erate and positive. The statement repeated Mos
cow's call for an East-West nuclear weapons freeze
and restated a series of proposals advanced by a
Warsaw Pact summit meeting held in Prague in
January, including a nonaggression pact between
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and War
saw Pact and a freeze on military spending on both
sides starting in January 1984.
The statement said that "proceeding from the
interest of peace and their security the states par
ticipating in the meeting declare that they will in
no cause allow military superiority to be achieved
over them. They resolutely favor the ensuring of
the balance of forces at the lowest level. In this
connection they draw attention to the proclaimed
position of their supreme state bodies on this is
sue."
Diplomatic observers said the reference to the
proclaimed position involved the Soviet statement
of May 28 warning that the Soviets might deploy
nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe if the West
deploys 572 Pershing II and cruise missiles in five
Western European countries. Czechoslovakia and

East Germany have publicly endorsed the Soviet
statement.
The fact that there was no specific reference to
the May 28 statement was interpreted by the ob
servers as an indication that Romania and possibly
Hungary had insisted on a more conciliatory
stand.
The Warsaw Pact nations said that particular im
portance must be attached to efforts to eliminate
"the danger of nuclear confrontation on the Euro
pean continent." They expressed "full support"
for the Soviet proposals at the Geneva talks on
medium-range weapons, adding:
"The participants in the meeting consider it
necessary to achieve at least such an accord that
would rule out the deployment of new American
missiles in Western European countries and pro
vide for a corresponding reduction of the existing
medium-range weapons systems in Europe with
the aim of ensuring balance on the lowest level.
The attainment of such an accord is possible if
both sides, displaying mutual understanding and
political will, proceed from the broad considera
tions of peace and security."
The meeting, kept secret until its communique
was reported by Moscow television evening news
Tuesday, was attended by the Communist Party
leaders, premiers and defense and foreign minis
ters of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, East Germany, Romania and Bulgaria.
On the eve of the summit, Soviet Defense Minis
ter Dmitri Ustinov hinted at the main theme of the
gathering by asserting in a speech that the
scheduled deployment of new U.S. missiles posed
"a special danger" and that it would "seriously
change the military-political situation," not only in
Europe but in the whole world.
