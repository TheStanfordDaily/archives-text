San Salvador, El Salvadorâ€”The
civil war dealt El Salvador three
fresh blows within a 12-hour
span, includinga rocket attack, a
kidnap attempt and the assassi
nation of a ultra-rightist politi
cian.
But the top U.S. military ad
viser here insisted that govern
ment forces, with enough aid,
can defeat leftist guerrillas in
two years.
Col. ]ohn Waghelstein, who
was to leave El Salvador today
after directing the 55 U.S. advis
ers for 15 months, said Salvado
ran forces have considerably
improved their ability to adapt to
guerrilla warfare.
Gunmen opened fire with
submachine guns Tuesday on
the automobile of Rene Barrios
Amaya, 50, an assoicate of ultra
rightist leader Roberto d'Au
buisson and a member of the
Constituent Assembly. He died
instantly, a colleague said.
A justice of the peace said the
body had eight bullets in the
chest.
Barrios served on the execu
tive committee of d'Aubuisson's
Republican Nationalist Alliance,
which with four other parties
forms a rightist majority in the
60 -member legislature.
D'Aubuisson is speaker of the
assembly.
Other deputies have been at
tacked since the assembly was
elected in March 1982, but Bar
rios was the first to be killed.
On Monday night, 10 gunmen
tried to kidnap Col. Jose Angel
Avedano near the U.S. Embassy,
wounding him in the leg and the
chest, sources at the military
hospital where he was taken re

ported. The colonel fired back,
the sources reported, wounding
several of his assailants who
then fled in a pickup truck.
Avedano was director of crim
inal investigation for the na
tional police, in charge of track
ing down leftist subversives,
from 1977 to 1979, in the conser
vative military government of
Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero.
Also Monday night, someone
fired a rocket at the U.S. Em
bassy, and several minutes later
the building was sprayed by gun
fire from two passing cars. Some
second-floor windows were
shattered, but no one was hurt.
The Popular Liberation
Forces, one of five leftist guerilla
groupsfightingthe government,
said in a clandestine radio
broadcast that it carried out the
embassy attack.
Waghelstein, 45, who was
leaving for an assignment at the
National War College in
Washington, told a news con
ference that Congress has been
giving half or less of the re
quested funds for Salvadoran
military aid.
"If we don't get what we ask
for it's going to take a little
longer, but we can still do it,"he
said of his projected govern
ment victory.
"We have advocated for a long
time that small unit operations
be conducted and that troops
. . . saturate the countryside
with patrols and night am
bushes, and they're doing that
now."
Today, 60 members of the
Arce Batallion were to leave for
Puerto Castillo, Honduras, for
eight weeks training by Green
Berets. The Associated Press
