Los Angeles—"lf I'm right. . .
Seymour Hersh, Pulitzer Prize-winning in
vestigative journalist, the Peck's Bad Boy of the
Washington literary set, the reporter who re
vealed the My Lai massacre, the secret bombing
of Cambodia, CIA domestic spying, is talking
about his new book.
He's not the only one.
"The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon
White House" is nearing the top of the best
seller lists this week. It is a dark tale questioning
the morals and motives of former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger and the ballyhooed ac
complishments of his term as White House na
tional security adviser. It is a catalogue of what
Hersh calls "horrific stories"—the "madman"
strategy in the Vietnam War, the secret B-52
bombing of Cambodia, Bangladesh massacres,
White House racism and, "less bloodily,
equally serious, the deceptions on SALT. . .ter
rifying."

The book set off this season's upper-drawer
uproar, as famous people have quickly taken
up sides in a battle of scenarios. There is the
version that portrays Kissinger as a wise,
reasoned statesman calmly steering the ship ot
state. And there is the Hersh version that de
picts an evil first officer ot a ship of fools.
The sparring points include not merely the
factual accuracy ol Hersh s book but also the
role of news media in watch dogging
government —and of the objectivity of a jour
nalist who comes at this story with a view point
and an anger.
Reviews generally have admired the depth
and scope of information in his book, while
questioning Hersh's tunnel vision, unnamed
sources and a refusal to allow Kissinger any
due. Kissinger, whose own version ot events
was recounted in a 1979 book, "The White
House Years," has denounced Hersh's book as
"slime." The Los Aneeles Times
