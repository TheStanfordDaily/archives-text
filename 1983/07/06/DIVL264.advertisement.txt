There are at least a half-dozen whitewater rivers in
California's Sierra Nevada foothillis, all within a three to four
hour drive of the campus, that range from easy to moderately
difficult to difficult. All of them are safe and are floated by
enough river people so you're never alone (unless you want
to be). We can rent you a raft suitable for six to nine paddlers,
life vests, paddles, bailing buckets and lifelines for only
$100 per day. You won't find rivers like these in Delaware or
lowa or Florida.
