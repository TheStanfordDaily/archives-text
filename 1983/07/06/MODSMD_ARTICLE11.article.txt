### PAT FREYTAG 
The success of the Space
Shuttle Challenger has de
monstrated many possible
.uses of future shuttle mis
sions, ranging from commer
cial enterprises to experi
ments in medical research.
However, for Aeronautics
and Astronautics Prof. Daniel
Bershader, the space shuttle
is primarily a stepping-stone
to a greater technological
achievement: a permanent
space station presently being
proposed by the National
Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration (NASA).
According to Bershader,
the shuttle is merely a "tool
and adjunct to the space sta
tion," a cargo truck that will
haul the space station up for
piece-by-piece assembly.
As one of the co-directors
of the Stanford-NASA-ASEE
(American Society of En
gineering Education) Sum
mer Faculty Program, which
sponsors several conferences
every year on aerospace
technology, Bershader is
partly in charge of this sum
mer's conference, entitled
"Autonomy and the Human
Element in Space."

The conference consists of
a series of ongoing work
shops and lectures by NASA
experts, aerospace com
panies and University faculty,
with subjects ranging from
computer automation and
robotics to behavioral
psychology and structural
aesthetics.
The objective of such a
conference, according to
Bershader, is to integrate and
study all the elements that
might make the space station
a successful experiment. To
gether with the aerospace
experts, the 20 participants,
faculty members and
graduate students from the
United States, study and dis
cuss such questions as
human behavior in a long
term space environment, the
structural and aesthetic con
struction of the space station
and possible consequences
of body mechanics in microg
ravity situations.
Oneotthe main subjects of
study in the conference is
that of "autonomy," as the
title of the conference
suggests. Bershader
explained that "autonomy,"
in this case, is a matter of who

or what should make specific
judgements. In a crisis situa
tion, should the human
operator make a specific
judgement or should the
computer? Should important
decisions be determined on
the Earth base or should the
space station have compelte
autonomy over its actions?
At present, it takes approx
imately 100 men on Earth to
keep one man up in space.
Bershader explained that if
those 100 men are replaced
by some sort of artificial intel
ligence, it would bring "au
tonomy" to the eventual
space station as well as re
duce the cost of such an ex
periment considerably.
Ted Sheskin, an associate
professor in industrial en
gineering from Cleveland
State University in Ohio,
came to the Stanford-NASA
ASEE conference to see what
specific technology in sys
tems analysis is available for
the creation of space stations.
He wants to learn about
state-of-the-art technology in
expert systems, as well as in
software and hardware.
From this conference he
hopes to learn to what extent
the United States can allocate
its resources to remain
technologically supreme in
aerospace technology.
"We must reinvigorate our
technological supremacy,"
he said. He believes that a
project such as the proposed
space station can achieve
that.
Bershader is confident that
most of the funding for the
space station will eventually
come from the government,
especially after the recent
commercial success of the
space shuttle. He also be
lieves that the private sector
will get more involved, as
soon as such investments are
shown to be profitable.
