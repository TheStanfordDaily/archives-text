## Kimball names members of Hoover committee 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
The president of the board of
trustees has named the mem
bers of the ad hoc committee
designed to explore and reas
sess the relations between the
Hoover Institution and the Uni
versity.
The committee members, all
members of the board of trus
tees, are William Kimball, board
of trustees president; Warren
Christopher, former deputy sec
retary of state; Frank Tatum, a
San Francisco lawyer; and Nancy
Barry Munger, a member of the
Hoover Board of Overseers.
The board was charged by the
faculty senate in May to examine
the ties between the University
and Hoover.
According to Kimball, the
committee intends to "study the
whole situation," to draw up a
slate of nominations of potential
members of a larger committee
to study the issue, and to make a
charge to that committee.
Kimball said he hopes the
larger committee will reflect a
"broad representation of Stan
ford:" possibly students, fa
culty, alumni, administration,
Hoover researchers and indi
viduals from outside the Univer
sity.
Kimball said he picked the ad
hoc committee members be
cause of their depth of interest
in the issue, their background
and their seniority on the board.

"I felt it was a balanced
group," he said.
In addition, Kimball said he
wanted a small, Western group
that could meet more easily dur
ing the summer.
Ideally, the committee will try
to "wrap up" its duties during
the summer, but it may not be
able to, Kimball said.
"We need quite a few meet
ings," he said. "We're not taking
it lightly at all."
The controversy over the
Hoover Institution began in
April when a faculty petition pro
tested the Institution's alleged
partisanship. A student petition
drive soon followed.
After a counter-petition and
much press coverage, the fa
culty senate at its May 26 meet
ing requested that the board
closely examine the University-
Hoover relationship.
