# Stanford libraries: services and branches abound
## 
### DAVID LIPPEATT 
When most Stanford students
are asked about the library sys
tem on campus, they tend to
think of only Meyer and Green,
and these only as places to study
or check out books. They are but
a small part of the complex of
libraries at Stanford and reveal
just a glimpse of the services
they offer.
The Stanford library system
contains more than 4,770,000
volumes, ranking it as the
seventh largest academic library
in the United States, behind
Harvard, with more than
10,260,000 volumes, Yale with
7,580,000, Illinois and UC-
Berkeley with 6,000,000 each,
and Michigan and Columbia
with more than 5,000,000 each.
At Stanford, these volumes
can be found in one of two ad
ministrative arms, which the lib
rary system has been divided.
The first division is the Univer
sity Library System, which is
under control of the Provost's
Office and consists of Meyer
Library, Green Library, 10 re
search branches (of which seven
are in the sciences) and several
smaller branches such as the
Heffner Memorial Library in the
Applied Physics Building.
The other library division is
the Coordinate Library System,
which comprises the Food Re
search Institute, the Hoover In

stitution, Lane Medical Library,
Crown Law Library and the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
Library. These branches are run
individually by the institution of
which they are a part.
Although these two systems
contain within them fewer indi
vidual libaries than Harvard (35),
or Yale (28), or Berkeley (27), to
gether the Coordinate and Uni
versity Library systems offer an
incredibly diverse array of ser
vices and facilities to the Stan
ford community, many of which
are relatively unknown.
The interlibrary loan program,
for example, allows faculty
members and students access to
information from other univer
sities which is unobtainable
here. This is possible because
Stanford is a member of the Re
search Libraries Group (RLG),
Inc., composed of more than 25
major research libraries which
have a regular exchange policy
for unrestricted (i.e., not valu
able or fragile) materials.
Receipt of this material may
take from a few days to two or
three months, depending on the
distance of the library sending
the material. Requests to use
this service may be made in
Room 151 on the first floor of
Green Library.
A more restricted but similar
program is the UC-Berkeley/
Stanford Research Library

Cooperative Program. This al
lows faculty, academic staff and
graduate students from both in
stitutions to either send for
materials from the other univer
sity's library or make use of the
intercampus shuttle service to
pick up the materials in person.
Borrower's cards for the prog
ram can be obtained from the
Privileges Desk on the first floor
of Green Library.
Another important but less
well known benefit of the library
system is the Computer Search
Service, which aids researchers
by examining more than 125
databases, or collections of in
formation, for source material.
These databases, which contain
factual, bibliographic and
numeric information, are pro
duced by scholastic organiza
tions, government agencies, or
other groups and made accessi
ble to Stanford Library staff
members by several information
vending services under contract
to Stanford.
Information obtainable
through the search is national or
international in origin and con
sists of a unique list of refer
ences which may refer to either
one topic or the overlap of two
or more topics.
For example, one search
might produce only material
about "Yugoslavia", if that was
the only subject requested,

while another search might take
two requested topics, "federal
government" and "shipping"
and come up with listings of in
formation on federal shipping
regulations.
In addition to these major ser
vices, the Stanford library sys
tem offers a number of smaller
services and facilities to both
students and faculty. The Term
Paper Advisory Service in Meyer
Library helps students narrow
down topics and find informa
tion.
RLG provides an information
access service similar to the
Computer Search Service, but
on a more limited basis. The
General Reference Service of

Green Library answers requests
for quick information from all
over the country.
Green also sponsors a book
sale on the first Wednesday of
each month in the Gift and Ex
change Division to dispose of
duplicated or unneccessary
materials. Prices are very
reasonable.
Upstairs in Green, disserta
tion and faculty research rooms
have been provided for uninter
rupted writing. Small services
like these, along with the more
well-known ones, create in the
Stanford Library System an al
most unlimited cache of re
sources upon which all resear
chers in the Stanford community
can draw.

here. This is possible because
Stanford is a member of the Re
search Libraries Group (RLG),
Inc., composed of more than 25
major research libraries which
have a regular exchange policy
for unrestricted (i.e., not valu
able or fragile) materials.
Receipt of this material may
take from a few days to two or
three months, depending on the
distance of the library sending
the material. Requests to use
this service may be made in
Room 151 on the first floor of
Green Library.
A more restricted but similar
program is the UC-Berkeley/
Stanford Research Library

Cooperative Program. This al
lows faculty, academic staff and
graduate students from both in
stitutions to either send for
materials from the other univer
sity's library or make use of the
intercampus shuttle service to
pick up the materials in person.
Borrower's cards for the prog
ram can be obtained from the
Privileges Desk on the first floor
of Green Library.
Another important but less
well known benefit of the library
system is the Computer Search
Service, which aids researchers
by examining more than 125
databases, or collections of in
formation, for source material.
These databases, which contain
factual, bibliographic and
numeric information, are pro
duced by scholastic organiza
tions, government agencies, or
other groups and made accessi
ble to Stanford Library staff
members by several information
vending services under contract
to Stanford.
Information obtainable
through the search is national or
international in origin and con
sists of a unique list of refer
ences which may refer to either
one topic or the overlap of two
or more topics.
For example, one search
might produce only material
about "Yugoslavia", if that was
the only subject requested,

while another search might take
two requested topics, "federal
government" and "shipping"
and come up with listings of in
formation on federal shipping
regulations.
In addition to these major ser
vices, the Stanford library sys
tem offers a number of smaller
services and facilities to both
students and faculty. The Term
Paper Advisory Service in Meyer
Library helps students narrow
down topics and find informa
tion.
RLG provides an information
access service similar to the
Computer Search Service, but
on a more limited basis. The
General Reference Service of

Green Library answers requests
for quick information from all
over the country.
Green also sponsors a book
sale on the first Wednesday of
each month in the Gift and Ex
change Division to dispose of
duplicated or unneccessary
materials. Prices are very
reasonable.
Upstairs in Green, disserta
tion and faculty research rooms
have been provided for uninter
rupted writing. Small services
like these, along with the more
well-known ones, create in the
Stanford Library System an al
most unlimited cache of re
sources upon which all resear
chers in the Stanford community
can draw.
