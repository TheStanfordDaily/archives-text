# New use for hypnosis in ulcer treatment explored at Med Center
## 
### LISA TSENG 
A pilot study is presently underway at the Stanford
Medical Center to research the possibility of hypnotiz
ing away stomach ulcers.
Kenneth Klein, a clinical instructor of medicine and a
specialist in diseases of the stomach and intestines here,
is working jointly with Assoc. Psychiatry Prof. David
Spiegel to substitute drugs normally prescribed in ulcer
treatment with doses of hypnotic treatment instead.
"The main factor involved in this research is cutting
down the amount of gastric acid that the stomach sec
retes, therefore minimizing the increased deterioration
of an ulcer," Spiegel said.
"We're a long way from having any definite answers,
but we have at least an indication that hypnosis might
lower stomach acidity for some people," Klein added.
Klein stresses that not everyone suffering from an
ulcer would be aided by this technique. Only subjects
very susceptible to hypnosis—about 25 to 50 percent of
the population—could benefit. Klein added that the
present studies being conducted do not prove, but
merely indicate, that hypnosis is useful in ulcer treat
ment.
Volunteers for the current study should be healthy
adults who will be tested to determine whether or not
they are good hypnosis candidates. Stomach acidity will
then be measured by using a tube inserted into the
stomach through the nose after a local anesthetic is
applied.

Immediately afterward, a hormone, pentagastrin, will
be administered to stimulate acid production, and
stomach acidity will be compared with the first test.
A week later, the volunteers will return to the Medical
Center for a re-analyzation of their stomach acidity. At
this stage, half of the volunteers (about five people) will
be hypnotized and given instructions intended to lower
their stomach acidity. Meanwhile, five other volunteers
will repeat the process without hypnosis as a control
unit.
According to Spiegel, preliminary data has de
monstrated that people seem to have a great deal of
control and flexibility where stomach acidity levels are
concerned.
This particular type of hypnosis, Spiegel said, involves
putting highly hypnotizable subjects in a trance, then
coaching them to think about something other than
food.
"What do you do when you're hungry and can't eat?"
or "What do you like about the beach in Mexico?" were
two examples Spiegal gave.
"All hypnosis is basically self-hypnosis," Spiegal said.
"It's like socratic learning where you don't really teach
but just help them find what they already know,"he
added.
Hypnosis gives a structured experience for the subject
to enter. Then, through a verbal interaction, a series of
experiences and mental images continue to coach the
subject along.

In one instance, a highly hypnotizable subject was
told to think about food. Observers noted a great in
crease in stomach acid.
Spiegal, who has studied other medical uses of hyp
nosis, said that hypnotic pain control in breast cancer
has been proven. In the case of women who have had a
primary tumor removed but experience a recurrence, a
dramatic increase in pain control can be achieved
through hypnosis.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo agrees that hypnosis
can influence bodily and biological functioning. Zim
bardo claims that he himself has seen the change in skin
temperature of the hand through hypnosis.
"Hypnosis is valuable in treating any medical problem
with a psychological component. Wherever anxiety,
stress, negative images or expectations play a role, hyp
nosis has been shown to be an effective adjunct to medi
cal treatment for people who are hypnotizable," Zim
bardo said.
As for curing ulcers, Klein said, "If a person can con
trol acid production through the mental concentration
or the trancelike state which hypnosis brings, we might
be able to learn more about how acid production is
triggered.
"If we can prove that hypnosis—which presumably
acts primarily through the nervous system—can moder
ate acid production, we can begin to explore the inter
vening pathways."
