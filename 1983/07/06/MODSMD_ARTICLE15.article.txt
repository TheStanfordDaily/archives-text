# SUMMER
## Students escape to life in the 'great outdoors' 
### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
Like so many things that bal
loon hideously out of propor
tion and end up taking a huge
toll in human lives and re
sources, the high Sierras trip
started off as a good idea. "I
have a good idea," Tim said, as
we sat aside a pile of dirt in
jasper Ridge, attending Anthro
91 one Saturday morning in early
May. "Why don't we go on a hik
ing trip through the Sierras after
school lets out? It'll be fun."
If I had known then what lay
before us in those mountains,
the tiring trails which seemed to
spiral away into the infinite sky,
the extremely inhospitable in
sect life, the hazardous, often
icy, terrain, and all the other
woes that would befall me due
to my encyclopedic ignorance of
all facets of camping and
backpacking—if I had seen all
that was ahead of me, if I had
known, I think we would have
left a week sooner and spent a
month longer.
Simply put, I had the best time
of my life blundering witlessly
through the mountain range of
Inyo Park. The rugged scenery,
the ocean air, the healthy
plantlife and the occasional
sightings of wild animals all

made this renunciation of civili
zation worth all the discomforts.
Beyond those basic pleasures,
there was something deeper and
more basic that made the trip as
enjoyable as it was: the com
radeship that developed between
the three of us—some sort of
atavistic throwback to caveman
days, a group bound together by
the requirements of survival.
And, as mightily as we struggled
against common sense in the
heroic spirit of life-threatening
risks for no reason whatsoever,
we all survived.
From the first day of the trip
that prospect seemed highly un
likely. When spring quarter en
ded, I was in the tail end of one
of the World Health Organiza
tion's coveted Gold Microbe
award cases of mononucleosis,
the virulent attack of which had
rendered me useless for two
weeks, making finals week
compress itself into a hellish
blur of cramming and make-up
work. The day we left for Inyo I
had that morning finished my
final paper for French History
and sent it express mail back to
Stanford, so I have only a hazy
recollection of the trip down.
I remember flat country roads
and even flatter country music

on the radio. Central California
seemed to be working towards
secession from the rest of the
state and unification with Kansas
or Nebraska, as perhaps in reac
tion to urbanization and trendi
ness in San Francisco and Los
Angeles. The interior of the state
is becoming one vast farm,
peopled by cowhands with little
affection for their "citified" fel
lows. After some eight-plus
hours of this culture shock, we
arrived in Lone Pine a few mi
nutes past midnight.
The part of Inyo National
Forest we were to spend our
time in is called the Golden
Trout Wilderness, because (I as
sume) the California state fish
hangs out there in substantial
numbers. It is a drainage basin
/vailed with high, rugged moun
tains. From the Backpacker's
Sourcebook, I am also informed
that "although the terrain varies,
n general the area offers a gen
tle topography suitable for be
ginning backpackers." Tim and
?ob, in planning our trip, had
chosen what must be the most
various terrain known to man.
After spending the night
sprawled over Rob's pickup
truck in various uncomfortable
positions, we woke ready to face

the first day of our vacation, and
an initial hike described as "chal
lenging." We were ready,
though, having prepared exten
sively, myself having caught the
already noted mono, and Rob
and Tim went out and walked
around the local reservoir. As we
hoisted our packs, we breathed
a silent thanks that we had had
the foresight to be sure we were
physically prepared for the
ordeal.
A word about the packs is in
order here. I happen to be nor
mally constructed, my parents
having been thankfully free of
mutant genes or nasty heredit
ary eccentricities. Rob and Tim,
however, were not so fortunate,
and due to some sad twist of
fate, had to suffer through a
hideously prolonged growth
period, which did not end until
they had been forced to grow to
unnatural heights of over six feet
tall. Worsening the situation,
Tim happens to descend from a
race of acromegalic giants,
whose camping gear we were us
ing. Our packs, then, were made
to accomodate their misshapen
frames.
Rob, likewise afflicted, had lit
tle trouble with the outsized
gear, but I, due to my normal
stature, was forced to use a pack
that, apparently, Tim had worn
shortly after birth, and even then
I would have felt more comfort
able inside of it rather than sup
porting it.
We were operating entirely
out of our packs, meaning that
everything we were to use at any
point in thetripwould be with us
the whole time—this despite my
intense lobbying for a system of
carefully planned airlifts of
supplies and materials during
the day, as well as night-time air
lifts to selected Sheraton and
Holiday Inns. This was—pardon
the expression—shot down, as
even the most liberal assess
ment of the cost would have
made us indentured servants
through the third generation. In
my paranoid way, I felt that some
of the things I had to carry in
were unnecessary, but Tim said
that we couldn't be sure we'd
find a large flat cooking rock of
that size in the camp, and Rob
insisted that his engine block
was far too valuable to be left in
the truck all week.
The first day with those packs
was a tribute, or at least tes
timony, to our skills and resolve
as hikers. Tim's route presented
us with a seven-mile hike, with
the initial five miles covering a
rise of over one mile. To put it
bluntly, we were going up.
We started jauntily, perhaps

feeling that some sort of dapper
style in the trek would make up
for what we lacked in endur
ance. Afterselectingourwalking
sticks (a bit of nonsense, I
thought at the time, but as they
were later to save our lives, I
have come to change my opin
ion) we se\off,singing. I have no
idea what we thought we were
heading into.
About 20 minutes into the hike
we stopped to taste the cool
mountain water. It was cold and
clean, thoroughly delicious. So
good, in fact, that we stopped
again not too much later for
another taste, and then again, a
few minutes later, and again.

We weren't fooling anyone.
We could go on taking these lit
tle breaks at the drop of a hat, or
we could be men, and hike de
terminedly, .cover the ground
we had to cover in strong, force
ful strides, despite the arcing
bolts of pain that shot through
our bodies, reducing once func
tional ganglia to so much dan
delion fluff.
We stopped for lunch.
Food was to be a major issue
throughout the trip. Generally,
we were forced to eat "sub
stances." It seems that there are
a number of companies that
provide backpackers with ob
jects to eat, and they have

found, through market research
I imagine, that backpackers
wish, since they are symbolically
withdrawing from civilization, to
also dispense with all the trap
pings of civilization, i.e., recog
nizable edible food. Ingenious
freeze dried lumps provided us
with many pleasant hours of

fireside conversation, chortling
merrily as we imagine what sort
of object we were ingesting.
One unusually vibrant meal was
estimated to be 35 percent old
shoelaces, 40 percent peat
moss, 20 percent candle wax,
and 5 percent unidentifiable

trace elements.
We also had bags of "gorp,"
or some similarly fanciful name.
What it consisted of was basi
cally candy, such as lemon drops
and M&Ms, and peanuts and
raisins. Naturally, the salted
peanuts and the sugar coated
lemon drops did not get along at
all well. The idea behind this
substance was that it could be
eaten for "fast energy," which,
of course, does not take into ac
count the fact of the im
mediately following drop in the
blood sugar level after that "fast
energy" burst. The gorp, in
deed, did make us hike farther
and longer, as after the gorp had
settled for a day or two none of
us could bear to take a break and
look into the bag to see what
new form it had taken.
After our lunch, which was a
"light lunch," of peanut butter
and jelly squeezed from tubes,
we continued our trek. The

slope of the hill was beginning to
tell on us. Where once we had
been singing, for God's sake,
now we were reduced to lifting
each other's spirits and bolster
ing endurance by gasping loudly
and the infrequent rasping
obscenity.
We had come to such a state.
Blistered, battered, be-bugged,
and sunburnt, we only kept
going by the feeble rallies of
strength caused by Tim's claims
that he saw the top, that we were
almost there. He, needless to
say, lied.
Late that afternoon the slope
evened out to no more than the
angle of a set of stairs—a relief
from the mockingly cliff-like
angle we had been negotia
ting—and we saw an odd
sight; or rather a common sight,
which was merely out of place.
Off to our right, across the river,
was a distant strip of black,
which looked like asphalt, which
was a road, which led to a

campground. Tim's ancient to
pographical maps didn't have
that road on them.
"This'll be great," he said.
"We'll go here," he pointed on
the map, "and the first day'll be
tough, but then we'll be in a re
ally beautiful place all alone, it's
so inaccessible."
Rob and I stared at the road,
and watched as carloads of
carefree adventurers sped by.
We looked back down the trail
we had come, every step tortur
ous, winding a path into the sky.
For no reason. Tim said "Sorry.
They must have put this road in
recently."
We were very nice about it,
and we just let the matter drop.
Rob was of the opinion that we
should also let Tim drop, but we
put that matter aside until we
had achieved more elevation.
"Well, Tim, I hope you've
learned your lesson about hik
ing with outdated maps." I
chuckled wryly. "Certainly

makes us look like fools to waste
a day hiking up here when we
could have just driven up."
Tim made no reply, either out
of shame for having made such
and error or because it would
have been virtually impossible
to talk with me kneeling on his
throat like that. We set off in si
lence.
As it darkened we looked for a
campsight, and, after learning

(once again, the hard way) how
nearly impossible it is to locate
oneself with a topographical
map unless you are one of the
lucky few born equipped with
built-in altimeter, we made
camp on a sandy stretch by a
river some 200 yards distant from
the parking lot. There we were, a
few feet from civilization, nearly
alone and sort of on our own,
roughing it.
