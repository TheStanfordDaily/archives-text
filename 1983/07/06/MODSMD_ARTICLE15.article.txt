# SUMMER
## Students escape to life in the 'great outdoors' 
### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
Like so many things that bal
loon hideously out of propor
tion and end up taking a huge
toll in human lives and re
sources, the high Sierras trip
started off as a good idea. "I
have a good idea," Tim said, as
we sat aside a pile of dirt in
jasper Ridge, attending Anthro
91 one Saturday morning in early
May. "Why don't we go on a hik
ing trip through the Sierras after
school lets out? It'll be fun."
If I had known then what lay
before us in those mountains,
the tiring trails which seemed to
spiral away into the infinite sky,
the extremely inhospitable in
sect life, the hazardous, often
icy, terrain, and all the other
woes that would befall me due
to my encyclopedic ignorance of
all facets of camping and
backpacking—if I had seen all
that was ahead of me, if I had
known, I think we would have
left a week sooner and spent a
month longer.
Simply put, I had the best time
of my life blundering witlessly
through the mountain range of
Inyo Park. The rugged scenery,
the ocean air, the healthy
plantlife and the occasional
sightings of wild animals all

made this renunciation of civili
zation worth all the discomforts.
Beyond those basic pleasures,
there was something deeper and
more basic that made the trip as
enjoyable as it was: the com
radeship that developed between
the three of us—some sort of
atavistic throwback to caveman
days, a group bound together by
the requirements of survival.
And, as mightily as we struggled
against common sense in the
heroic spirit of life-threatening
risks for no reason whatsoever,
we all survived.
From the first day of the trip
that prospect seemed highly un
likely. When spring quarter en
ded, I was in the tail end of one
of the World Health Organiza
tion's coveted Gold Microbe
award cases of mononucleosis,
the virulent attack of which had
rendered me useless for two
weeks, making finals week
compress itself into a hellish
blur of cramming and make-up
work. The day we left for Inyo I
had that morning finished my
final paper for French History
and sent it express mail back to
Stanford, so I have only a hazy
recollection of the trip down.
I remember flat country roads
and even flatter country music

on the radio. Central California
seemed to be working towards
secession from the rest of the
state and unification with Kansas
or Nebraska, as perhaps in reac
tion to urbanization and trendi
ness in San Francisco and Los
Angeles. The interior of the state
is becoming one vast farm,
peopled by cowhands with little
affection for their "citified" fel
lows. After some eight-plus
hours of this culture shock, we
arrived in Lone Pine a few mi
nutes past midnight.
The part of Inyo National
Forest we were to spend our
time in is called the Golden
Trout Wilderness, because (I as
sume) the California state fish
hangs out there in substantial
numbers. It is a drainage basin
/vailed with high, rugged moun
tains. From the Backpacker's
Sourcebook, I am also informed
that "although the terrain varies,
n general the area offers a gen
tle topography suitable for be
ginning backpackers." Tim and
?ob, in planning our trip, had
chosen what must be the most
various terrain known to man.
After spending the night
sprawled over Rob's pickup
truck in various uncomfortable
positions, we woke ready to face

the first day of our vacation, and
an initial hike described as "chal
lenging." We were ready,
though, having prepared exten
sively, myself having caught the
already noted mono, and Rob
and Tim went out and walked
around the local reservoir. As we
hoisted our packs, we breathed
a silent thanks that we had had
the foresight to be sure we were
physically prepared for the
ordeal.
A word about the packs is in
order here. I happen to be nor
mally constructed, my parents
having been thankfully free of
mutant genes or nasty heredit
ary eccentricities. Rob and Tim,
however, were not so fortunate,
and due to some sad twist of
fate, had to suffer through a
hideously prolonged growth
period, which did not end until
they had been forced to grow to
unnatural heights of over six feet
tall. Worsening the situation,
Tim happens to descend from a
race of acromegalic giants,
whose camping gear we were us
ing. Our packs, then, were made
to accomodate their misshapen
frames.
Rob, likewise afflicted, had lit
tle trouble with the outsized
