# Faculty Senate press policy challenged by PA Weekly
## 
### ANN ELLIS 
While the Faculty Senate was
debating the Hoover Institu
tion's relationship with the Uni
versity this spring, a secondary
controversy was brewing out
side. Holding to senate policy,
press coverage of the senate
proceedings was limited to the
University News Service, cam
pus radio station KZSU and The
Stanford Daily, while local and
national press were denied di
rect access to the debate.
The press policy, established
early in the senate's 15-year his
tory, was not intended to be
exclusionary, according to

Academic Secretary Clara Bush.
Bush said that while some is
sues may be of "momentary in
terest to the press," standard in
vitations to cover-senate meet
ings have only been issued to
news services that have showed
an ongoing interest in the pro
ceedings. Requests by off
campus press to cover a single
feature of the meetings have
been denied.
The policy was called into
question this spring, however,
when debates regarding the na
ture of Stanford's relationship to
the Hoover Institution attracted
national attention. Reporters

from The New York Times and
The Washington Post, as well as
representatives of local media,
were denied admittance to the
senate meeting.
In response to the Hoover de
bate episode, Palo Alto Weekly
Editor Tim Clark has submitted a
formal request to the senate ask
ing for reconsideration of its
press policy, one that he be
iieves is inconsistent.
"The current policy of the
Academic Senate guarantees
that these reporters must rely on
second-hand information about
decisions made by the Senate.
This is not a healthy situation;

(it) damages informed and ba
lanced coverage of campus
events and issues."
Clark contends that the Fa
culty Senate deals with issues of
both interest and impact beyond
the Stanford community. Ques
tions regarding research policy,
tenure guidelines and
University-industry relations
have specific interest to the Uni
versity, but also general interest
to the general public.
Bob Beyers, director of News
and Publications and Faculty Se
nate information officer, said he
was originally only permitted to
work from the texts of resolu

tions and later began using
quotes with permission. Cur
rently, Beyers uses "normal
news judgment in covering the
proceedings."
While space constraints have
been cited as a reason to restrict
pr-ess access to senate meetings,
Beyers speculates there may be
faculty reluctance to open media
coverage. Their interest lies in
exchanging academic informa
tion with their peers, rather than
providing external publicity, he;
said.
Beyers would like to see a
more liberal press policy,
though.
