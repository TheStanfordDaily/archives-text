## Theatre Works stumbles with 'Night Music' 
### MARC FAJER 
| Theatre Works opened their summer season Friday
night with a production of the Stephen Sondheim musi
cal A Little Night Music at the Lucie Stern Community
[Center in Palo Alto. Despite a wonderful set by Tom
[Richardson and some intermittently fine singing, it was
basically a sloppy show that did not do justice either to
Sondheim's enchanting music or to Hugh Wheeler's
Iwitty and stylish book.
The plot, based loosely on the Bergman movie Smiles
of a Summer Night, concerns a middle-aged lawyer
(Keith Bentley) who has recently married an 18-year-old
(Jennifer Adams). Frustrated after 11 months of uncon
summated matrimony, he turns to an old flame, Desiree,
an actress (Susan Dorsey), who is currently involved
with a very jealous dragoon (Steven Carlitz), who has an
embittered wife (Carol Bunker). They all end up spend
inga weekend at the country house of Desiree's mother
(Pat Weaver) and, under the endless sun of the Scan
dinavian summer night, various madnesses ensue.
Bentley and Dorsey are adequate as the old lovers,
though each has some problems. He has occasional
problems finding the right note, while she has a few
totally unbelieveable moments, notably a flustered exit
early in the second act when she is left alone with both
the lawyer and the dragoon. Dorsey also commits the
nearly unforgivable sin of flubbing an entrance during
the poignant "Send in the Clowns."
Steven Carlitz as the blustering soldier gives the best
performance of the evening. Though he doesn't quite
look the professional soldier, his fine voice more than
makes up for his appearance. His two songs, "It Would
Have Been Wonderful" (a duet with Bentley) and espe
cially "In Praise of Women" are the cleanest and best
numbers in the production. Carol Bunker as his clever,
bitchy wife is fine when she is being shrewish, but
comes up short in her difficult emotional scenes. "Every
Day a Little Death," her song about the horror that
marriage can be for a woman, and one of Sondheim's
most powerful songs, lacks focus, and therefore impact.
Director Robert Kelley has chosen to play Anne, the
young wife, much less innocently than she is often por
trayed. She often seems to be deliberately sexually teas
ing her 19-year-old stepson, Henrik (Brent Davis). In
addition, despite the fact that the closest she has come
to sex is that she doesn't "mind it too much" when her
husband kisses her brow, she rubs his body and leg
while singing to him when he is asleep. Jennifer Adams

does fairly well with these decisions, and she has a pretty
voice, but it is hard to believe that she is either 18 or a
virgin, and that strains the story as a whole. Davis, as the
self-righteous seminarian, the lawyer's son, is quite
good most of the time, both acting and singing, and it is a
pleasure to see someone in the role who actually plays
the cello. Ev Shiro, as the lusty maid, Petra, is the most
engaging member of the cast beside Carlitz, and adds
energy to a number of slow scenes. Her song, "The
Miller's Son" (my favorite), is beautifully sung, but suf
fers from problems with the staging and the orchestra.
Pat Weaver, as the actress' mother, who was once one
of the leading courtesans in Europe, manages to deliver
her hilarious lines passably, but totally misses both the
style and the senility of the old woman. "Liaisons," her
song recalling the way affairs were conducted in her
heyday, fails both because Kelley has chosen to leave
her in her wheelchair for the entire number and because
she doesn't bring across the distinctions that define her
life. Though miles separate an "amiable hock" from a
"rare champagne," she does not make us believe in the
difference or in how much it matters to her. She is
altogether too bourgeois to be what she claims to be.
Sarah Flicker, age 11, is adorable as Desiree's daugh
ter. Unfortunately, the part was written for a 14-year-old,
and many of the lines seem very strange delivered to, or
popping out of, a pre-pubescent girl.
One of the unique things about A Little Night Music is
the five-person chorus who drift through the show
commenting on the action. While the five singers in this
production all have fine voices, they do not always blend
well together, and only William Marshall has the style
and mannerisms that are appropriate to an upper class
European. Gerald Ingalls is often difficult to understand,
and the three women, Nancy Kendzierski, Diana El
lington and Ann DePangher are nearly indistinguishable
and often not very interesting. Like the old woman, the
quintet often lacks elegance and their mannerisms seem
to approach those of Petra, the maid, rather than those
of the more refined characters whom they are supposed
to represent in many songs.
The direction in the show in general suffers from a lack
of attention to detail that marked Kelley's last two pro
ductions, The Woolgatherer and The Great White Hope.
Most of the dialogue seems rushed and without nuance;
I don't recall one pause during the entire spoken part of

the show. The subtle class distinctions which are a part
of this world are bypassed for the most part, and there
are a variety of clumsy details — for example, a Sears
catalogue croquet set which Desiree and her daughter
mime playing, as there are no croquet balls. The staging
of the musical numbers is often weak as well. The large
group number's are .full of nondescript wandering, and
there is a lot of very cutesy pantomime, especially by the
quintet. There seems to have been a deliberate choice to
slow down the music to make the difficult lyrics com
prehensible. This is admirable, and it works well in gen
eral, but leaves some songs dragging, and destroys the
meaning of "The Glamorous rife" which is about the
hectic pace of a touring theatre company.
Tom Richardson's set is marvelous — trees full of
sensual turn-of-the-century imagery float in and out
chasing similarly decorated pieces of rooms and the
front of the Armfeldt mansion. John p. Fisher's lighting,
however, does not do it justice. The stage is often
splotchy, and actors are left in the dark on many occa
sions. There also seemed to be problems with the follow
spots; one focused annoyingly on the ceiling through
much of "Send in the Clowns." Nancy Hahn's costumes,
while properly elegant, do not do enough to distinguish
between the various female characters; the women in
the quintet could have used more differentiation, and it
is strange to see the bitter Charlotte dressed nearly iden
tically to the innocent Anne.
The music under the direction of Keith Atwater and
Dawn Horst (vocals) had real problems in places. The
cast and orchestra were often not together; in "A
Weekend in the Country" some beautiful and difficult
transitions were botched badly. The orchestra was very
tentative, and made a number of noticable mistakes.
This was especially clear in "A Miller's Son" and "A
Weekend in the Country" where powerful accompani
ments were nearly non-existent.
Overall, considering the quality of shows that Theat
re Works has presented in the past nine months, this is
an especially disappointing production of a fine play. "A
Little Night Music" will show through July 24 at the Lucie
Stern Community Center. If you have never seen the '
musical, it may be worth it just to hear the music and
laugh at the wit. On the other hand, this may not be the
best production to acquaint you with the show.

while singing to him when he is asleep. Jennifer Adams

does fairly well with these decisions, and she has a pretty
voice, but it is hard to believe that she is either 18 or a
virgin, and that strains the story as a whole. Davis, as the
self-righteous seminarian, the lawyer's son, is quite
good most of the time, both acting and singing, and it is a
pleasure to see someone in the role who actually plays
the cello. Ev Shiro, as the lusty maid, Petra, is the most
engaging member of the cast beside Carlitz, and adds
energy to a number of slow scenes. Her song, "The
Miller's Son" (my favorite), is beautifully sung, but suf
fers from problems with the staging and the orchestra.
Pat Weaver, as the actress' mother, who was once one
of the leading courtesans in Europe, manages to deliver
her hilarious lines passably, but totally misses both the
style and the senility of the old woman. "Liaisons," her
song recalling the way affairs were conducted in her
heyday, fails both because Kelley has chosen to leave
her in her wheelchair for the entire number and because
she doesn't bring across the distinctions that define her
life. Though miles separate an "amiable hock" from a
"rare champagne," she does not make us believe in the
difference or in how much it matters to her. She is
altogether too bourgeois to be what she claims to be.
Sarah Flicker, age 11, is adorable as Desiree's daugh
ter. Unfortunately, the part was written for a 14-year-old,
and many of the lines seem very strange delivered to, or
popping out of, a pre-pubescent girl.
One of the unique things about A Little Night Music is
the five-person chorus who drift through the show
commenting on the action. While the five singers in this
production all have fine voices, they do not always blend
well together, and only William Marshall has the style
and mannerisms that are appropriate to an upper class
European. Gerald Ingalls is often difficult to understand,
and the three women, Nancy Kendzierski, Diana El
lington and Ann DePangher are nearly indistinguishable
and often not very interesting. Like the old woman, the
quintet often lacks elegance and their mannerisms seem
to approach those of Petra, the maid, rather than those
of the more refined characters whom they are supposed
to represent in many songs.
The direction in the show in general suffers from a lack
of attention to detail that marked Kelley's last two pro
ductions, The Woolgatherer and The Great White Hope.
Most of the dialogue seems rushed and without nuance;
I don't recall one pause during the entire spoken part of

the show. The subtle class distinctions which are a part
of this world are bypassed for the most part, and there
are a variety of clumsy details — for example, a Sears
catalogue croquet set which Desiree and her daughter
mime playing, as there are no croquet balls. The staging
of the musical numbers is often weak as well. The large
group number's are .full of nondescript wandering, and
there is a lot of very cutesy pantomime, especially by the
quintet. There seems to have been a deliberate choice to
slow down the music to make the difficult lyrics com
prehensible. This is admirable, and it works well in gen
eral, but leaves some songs dragging, and destroys the
meaning of "The Glamorous rife" which is about the
hectic pace of a touring theatre company.
Tom Richardson's set is marvelous — trees full of
sensual turn-of-the-century imagery float in and out
chasing similarly decorated pieces of rooms and the
front of the Armfeldt mansion. John p. Fisher's lighting,
however, does not do it justice. The stage is often
splotchy, and actors are left in the dark on many occa
sions. There also seemed to be problems with the follow
spots; one focused annoyingly on the ceiling through
much of "Send in the Clowns." Nancy Hahn's costumes,
while properly elegant, do not do enough to distinguish
between the various female characters; the women in
the quintet could have used more differentiation, and it
is strange to see the bitter Charlotte dressed nearly iden
tically to the innocent Anne.
The music under the direction of Keith Atwater and
Dawn Horst (vocals) had real problems in places. The
cast and orchestra were often not together; in "A
Weekend in the Country" some beautiful and difficult
transitions were botched badly. The orchestra was very
tentative, and made a number of noticable mistakes.
This was especially clear in "A Miller's Son" and "A
Weekend in the Country" where powerful accompani
ments were nearly non-existent.
Overall, considering the quality of shows that Theat
re Works has presented in the past nine months, this is
an especially disappointing production of a fine play. "A
Little Night Music" will show through July 24 at the Lucie
Stern Community Center. If you have never seen the '
musical, it may be worth it just to hear the music and
laugh at the wit. On the other hand, this may not be the
best production to acquaint you with the show.
| Theatre Works opened their summer season Friday
night with a production of the Stephen Sondheim musi
cal A Little Night Music at the Lucie Stern Community
[Center in Palo Alto. Despite a wonderful set by Tom
[Richardson and some intermittently fine singing, it was
basically a sloppy show that did not do justice either to
Sondheim's enchanting music or to Hugh Wheeler's
Iwitty and stylish book.
The plot, based loosely on the Bergman movie Smiles
of a Summer Night, concerns a middle-aged lawyer
(Keith Bentley) who has recently married an 18-year-old
(Jennifer Adams). Frustrated after 11 months of uncon
summated matrimony, he turns to an old flame, Desiree,
an actress (Susan Dorsey), who is currently involved
with a very jealous dragoon (Steven Carlitz), who has an
embittered wife (Carol Bunker). They all end up spend
inga weekend at the country house of Desiree's mother
(Pat Weaver) and, under the endless sun of the Scan
dinavian summer night, various madnesses ensue.
Bentley and Dorsey are adequate as the old lovers,
though each has some problems. He has occasional
problems finding the right note, while she has a few
totally unbelieveable moments, notably a flustered exit
early in the second act when she is left alone with both
the lawyer and the dragoon. Dorsey also commits the
nearly unforgivable sin of flubbing an entrance during
the poignant "Send in the Clowns."
Steven Carlitz as the blustering soldier gives the best
performance of the evening. Though he doesn't quite
look the professional soldier, his fine voice more than
makes up for his appearance. His two songs, "It Would
Have Been Wonderful" (a duet with Bentley) and espe
cially "In Praise of Women" are the cleanest and best
numbers in the production. Carol Bunker as his clever,
bitchy wife is fine when she is being shrewish, but
comes up short in her difficult emotional scenes. "Every
Day a Little Death," her song about the horror that
marriage can be for a woman, and one of Sondheim's
most powerful songs, lacks focus, and therefore impact.
Director Robert Kelley has chosen to play Anne, the
young wife, much less innocently than she is often por
trayed. She often seems to be deliberately sexually teas
ing her 19-year-old stepson, Henrik (Brent Davis). In
addition, despite the fact that the closest she has come
to sex is that she doesn't "mind it too much" when her
husband kisses her brow, she rubs his body and leg
while singing to him when he is asleep. Jennifer Adams
