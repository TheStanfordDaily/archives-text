# High-tech imaging facility construction plans announced

### ALEX TARG 
The Medical Center Thursday
approved plans for a new nuc
lear magnetic resonance (NMR)
research center here.
The proposed $3.3 million
structure will be erected on
Governor's Lane, just to the west
of the medical school. The
center should start operation by
1985.
Although new to medical sci
ence, NMR has long been famil
iar to physicists and chemists as
one of their most powerful tools
for biochemical analysis.
NMR relies on the ability of
chemical elements and
molecules to respond to intense
magnetic fields and bursts of
radio energy by emitting signals
that indicate the structure of
molecules or the state of health
in human organs.
The new field of NMR imaging
uses harmless magnetic fields
and radio-waves in place of
X-rays to make three dimen
sional images of any portion of
the human body.

NMR needs no injections, no
drugs and no surgery to perform
its detective work. In medical
terms, it is non-invasive and
therefore safe. In 10 minutes or
less, NMR imagers can produce
computer-generated images of

cross sections of a patient's
whole body, or of a single organ,
more completely than compet
ing imaging techniques, accord
ing to Medical School Dean
Dominick Purpura.

"The technique has enormous
potential as a tool for diagnosis
and for evaluating biochemical
changes in the body during
treatment," Purpura said. "It will
have a particularly dramatic im
pact on the analysis and treat
ment of a variety of neurological
and psychiatric disorders be
cause of its ability to image
metabolism in different brain
areas non-invasively."
NMR, which was co-invented
by Stanford's Nobel laureate
Felix Bloch in the mid-'4os, has
evolved into one of the most ex
traordinary body-imaging tools
of the future, according to Pur
pura.
"It's therefore fitting for Stan
ford to establish a center dedi
cated to the continuing de
velopment of NMR," said Pur
pura.
The proposed NMR center,
whose use will not be limited to
biomedical researchers but will
be available to all university de
partments, will governed by a


Oleg Jardetzky
policy board. A three-member
directorate with one member
designated as the director will
guide the day-to-day operations.
"The purpose of this building
is to collect all work connected
with the NMR technology and
provide a common intellectual
focus for our researchers.
People who do this kind of work
can learn from each other,"
Oleg Jardetzky, director of the
Stanford Magnetic Resonance
Laboratory and chairman of the

dean's committee for the estab
lishment of a center for NMR re
search. "We also need a suitable
physical environment for our
NMR instrumentation."
The NMR equipment to be
housed in the center is very sen
sitive to its environment. The
center's tools will include
million-dollar imagers and spec
trometers built around massive
superconducting electromag
nets cooled to 450 degrees
below zero. These magnets
generate extraordinarily intense
magnetic fields up to 41,000
times more powerful than the
Earth's.

Because these magnetic fields
stretch far beyond the machines'
physical boundries, if they are
not contained in special build
ings such as the Stanford NMR
Center, they can be distorted,
rendering the machines tem
porarily inoperable.
Such commonly found struc
tural features as steel beams and
elevators will be carefully en
gineered so as not to interfere
with the machines' operation,
according to Jardetzky.
The center is unique in the
country in that it is not dedicated
to a specialized field. Virtually
every department in the medical

school has a use for data ob
tained using this technology. In
addition to the center's mul
tidisciplinary approach to re
search, it will also serve as home
for some of the world's most
powerful magnets and high re
solution NMR spectrometers.
The center will house about 60
people, including new faculty
members and NMR technical
experts. The center will incorpo
rate the most advanced imaging
technology, and will be equip
ped with built-in potential for
both hardware and software
modification to incorporate new
developments.
