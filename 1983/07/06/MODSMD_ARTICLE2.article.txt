The Medical Center Thursday
approved plans for a new nuc
lear magnetic resonance (NMR)
research center here.
The proposed $3.3 million
structure will be erected on
Governor's Lane, just to the west
of the medical school. The
center should start operation by
1985.
Although new to medical sci
ence, NMR has long been famil
iar to physicists and chemists as
one of their most powerful tools
for biochemical analysis.
NMR relies on the ability of
chemical elements and
molecules to respond to intense
magnetic fields and bursts of
radio energy by emitting signals
that indicate the structure of
molecules or the state of health
in human organs.
The new field of NMR imaging
uses harmless magnetic fields
and radio-waves in place of
X-rays to make three dimen
sional images of any portion of
the human body.

NMR needs no injections, no
drugs and no surgery to perform
its detective work. In medical
terms, it is non-invasive and
therefore safe. In 10 minutes or
less, NMR imagers can produce
computer-generated images of

cross sections of a patient's
whole body, or of a single organ,
more completely than compet
ing imaging techniques, accord
ing to Medical School Dean
Dominick Purpura.

"The technique has enormous
potential as a tool for diagnosis
and for evaluating biochemical
changes in the body during
treatment," Purpura said. "It will
have a particularly dramatic im
pact on the analysis and treat
ment of a variety of neurological
and psychiatric disorders be
cause of its ability to image
metabolism in different brain
areas non-invasively."
NMR, which was co-invented
by Stanford's Nobel laureate
Felix Bloch in the mid-'4os, has
evolved into one of the most ex
traordinary body-imaging tools
of the future, according to Pur
pura.
"It's therefore fitting for Stan
ford to establish a center dedi
cated to the continuing de
velopment of NMR," said Pur
pura.
The proposed NMR center,
whose use will not be limited to
biomedical researchers but will
be available to all university de
partments, will governed by a
