# 'Twilight Zone': taking liberties with TV style
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Many people who watched
The Twilight Zone as kids con
sider it a fond part of their child
hood, and the regularity with
which reruns of the show turn
up on afternoon and late-night
TV indicates that viewers still de
rive pleasure from it. In the late
'50s and early '60s, when it first
aired, it provided audiences
with the only source of black
comedy available on television
apart from Alfred Hitchcock Pre
sents (which had begun in 1955,
four years earlier). In nifty half
hour packages, it presented a
consistently high-caliber series
of science fiction and fantasy
stories — many of which con

tained such thrilling O. Henry
twists that many of us recall
them in detail 20 years later. And
though they represented the
work of dozens of writers and
directors, the style of the show's
host and coordinator, Rod Serl
ing, was so distinctive — like the
facetious, razor-clip voice that
has given a livelihood to so many
impersonators — that most of us
probably assumed all the stories
came out of his head. (He did in
fact write some of the most fam
ous ones.)
The Twilight Zone: The Movie
begins with an acknowledge
ment of the way in which Serling
and the TV show captured our

imaginations two decades ago.
In a prologue directed by John
Landis, a couple of friends (Al
bert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd)
driving a badly lit road late at
night move from an informal
trivia game — Guess the TV
Theme Music — to an energetic
exchange of favorite bits from
The Twilight Zone. This intro
ductory passage shows off all of
Landis's best qualities: it's
casual yet spunky, with an un
disguised sophomoric appeal
and it slides into a perfectly
timed punch line. What follows
— when the laughter has died
down — is an arrangement of
four short story films, each one
more or less the length of an old
Twilight Zone episode. (The
precise will remember that dur
ing its fourth season, the show
expanded to an hour — only to
return to its original format the
next year.) Landis wrote and di
rected the infamous first
episode; the others — directed
(in chronological order) by Ste
ven Spielberg, Joe Dante (of The
Howling) and George Miller (of
the Mad Max pictures) — are all
derived from stories presented
by Serling on his TV show.
Our nostalgia for the popular
entertainments we were ad
dicted to in childhood often
causes us to love even their
worst qualities, so the clunky,
overemphatic acting and staging
of many of the Zones, as well as
their shameless pedantry, don't
make us cringe when we watch
them in syndication. But be
cause we demand more of our
movies, the two episodes that
are really closest in spirit to the
TV show — the Landis and Spiel
berg — are much less successful
than the third and fourth seg
ments, each of which has its own
distinctive style. In the Landis
story, the late Vic Morrow plays
a misanthrope whose anger at
being passed over for promo
tion in favor of a Jew gives rise to
an ugly display of bigotry in a
bar; when he steps into the
street, he finds himself in Nazi
occupied Paris, where he is
taken for a Jew — and then in the
American South, where he is

chased by the KKK, and in jung
les in Vietnam, where he is shot
at by American soldiers. The
material is not only preachy, but
dramatically self-defeating,
since it makes its point very early
and has nothing to do afterwards
but repeat itself — while we
watch Morrow being chased
down over and over. (It is im
possible, of course, to avoid
thinking about his real death in
the course of the shooting.)
Landis seems stuck — even in
the bar scene, he replays every
moment, as if he were trying to
find a way to make the damn
thing work. Consequently, the
episode never establishes any
kind of rhythm, even once the
fantasy sequences take over.
Though the second part was
assembled by experts — Spiel
berg, photographer Allen
Daviau (who worked with him
on E.T.) and the king of editors,
Michael Kahn — it suffers from
problems in rhythm, too,
though for different reasons. Its
source, "Kick the Can," was an
original teleplay by George
Clayton Johnson, directed by
Lamont Johnson and featuring
Ernest Truex, Russell Collins and
John Marley; in it, an unhappy
old man in a rest home managed
to turn himself and some of his
fellow golden agers into chil
dren. You can see what drew
Spielberg, the most gifted young
heart in American movies, to this
particular story, but he forgot to
bring his wit with him, and the
results are earnest and dawdling
— more silly than charming, and
more sentimental than touch
ing. Daviau has made the mis
take of bathing the parlor of the
rest home in a sunset glow, and
Spielberg goes in for too many
close-ups — especially of Scat
man Crothers, whom he (un
wisely) cast in a variation on the
Ernest Truex part. Crothers
looks great on camera, but he
talks with lethal slowness, as if
he were lecturing a crew of
naughty four-year-olds. I never
saw the original episode, but
I've read a synopsis of it, and it
seems to methatallofthealtera
tions Spielberg and Richard
Matheson and Josh Regan made
in it — changing the Truex
character into a sort of shaman
and then having the old folks
discover that they'd rather have

their old bodies back again —
tame it and thin it out into a
homilectic soup by the end.
The Dante and Miller seg
ments have also taken consider
able liberties with their sources.
Richard Matheson adapted both
— in the first case a Jerome Bixby
story called "It's a Good Life,"
which had a Serling script on TV
(and a cast that included Cloris
Leachman), in the second one of
his own pieces, "Nightmare at
20,000 Feet," which Richard
Donner had directed for the
show with William Shatner and,
in a gremlin's costume, the
celebrated acrobat Nick Cravat.
And they are both small gems.
(Spielberg and Landis, who pro
duced the entire anthology,
were smart to place these
episodes in the penultimate and
final slots.) Bixby's 1953 story,
which is creepily effective but
leaves an unpleasant aftertaste,
concerns a little boy who,
through his power to turn his
thoughts into realities, has en
slaved not only his own family
but the entire town he lives in.
Matheson and Dante have
added a character from an ear
lier Zone, Helen Foley, a school
teacher (Serling claimed he took
the name of his own favorite
teacher), softened the ending,
and made it funny. They've also
found a way to incorporate a
completely consistent and very
imaginative visual style, which
Dante implemented with the aid
of production designer Jim Bis
sel and photographer John Hara.
When Anthony (Jeremy Licht)
brings Helen (Kathleen Quinlan)
home to supper, she finds that
he lives in a house with a TV set
blaring a different cartoon in
each room, and a decor that
might have been designed by
Tex Avery or Chuck Jones. An
thony thinks in cartoons — the
monsters he produces are ber
serk animated creatures, and the
cartoons he conjures up on the
set are Max Fleischer-like
nightmares. (At the most horrify
ing moment, the deft young
actor Jeremy Licht does a hoarse
imitation of Bugs Bunny.) But
the wild, outre look of the
episode keeps us laughing even
at the scariest parts — as does
the caricaturing of TV veterans
William Schallert and Kevin
McCarthy as two of Anthony's

prisoners. The last five minutes
are a letdown, unfortunately,
not only because the tone be
comes benign but also because
Dante and the designers appear
to have used up all their best
ideas by then — and the final
image, which needs to be glori
ously inventive to offset the
switch in tone, turns out to be a
bit drab.
Matheson's published tale
"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,"
about an airline passenger who
sees a gremlin on the wing of his
plane, is nondescript, but each
time he dramatizes it he makes it
a little better by improving on
the central character. When Wil
liam Shatner played him, he was
a salesman who had recently had
a nervous breakdown; in the
movie, he has metamorphosed
into a computer expert whose
fear of flying leaves him hysteri
cal, irrational and at least partly
incoherent as the plane barrels
through fiercer and fiercer
weather. Because Matheson and
Miller have given the passenger
Valentine such an extreme case
of fear of flying, the fact that he is
the only person on board to see
the monster becomes an hilari
ous, jangly device. And John
Lithgow gives a virtuoso perfor
mance, improvising splendidly
in a rhythm all hisown (he seems
desperately, uproariously
locked in) and playing off the
other actors — bouncing or col
liding might be a better word —
in constantly surprising ways.
George Miller has built the en
tire episode around Lithgow,
and his craftsmanship is seam
less; only afterwards do you
realize how ingeniously he set
up the tension between oppos
ing points of view, how expertly
he balanced comedy and sus

pense, and how cleverly he cast
the other roles. If TV shows like
The Twilight Zone were cus
tomarily directed by directors of
George Miller's rank, or Joe
Dante's, it would be difficult to
tear oneself away from the set
and go to the movies.
Many people who watched

episode; the others — directed
(in chronological order) by Ste
ven Spielberg, Joe Dante (of The
Howling) and George Miller (of
the Mad Max pictures) — are all
derived from stories presented
by Serling on his TV show.
Our nostalgia for the popular
entertainments we were ad
dicted to in childhood often
causes us to love even their
worst qualities, so the clunky,
overemphatic acting and staging
of many of the Zones, as well as
their shameless pedantry, don't
make us cringe when we watch
them in syndication. But be
cause we demand more of our
movies, the two episodes that
are really closest in spirit to the
TV show — the Landis and Spiel
berg — are much less successful
than the third and fourth seg
ments, each of which has its own
distinctive style. In the Landis
story, the late Vic Morrow plays
a misanthrope whose anger at
being passed over for promo
tion in favor of a Jew gives rise to
an ugly display of bigotry in a
bar; when he steps into the
street, he finds himself in Nazi
occupied Paris, where he is
taken for a Jew — and then in the
American South, where he is

chased by the KKK, and in jung
les in Vietnam, where he is shot
at by American soldiers. The
material is not only preachy, but
dramatically self-defeating,
since it makes its point very early
and has nothing to do afterwards
but repeat itself — while we
watch Morrow being chased
down over and over. (It is im
possible, of course, to avoid
thinking about his real death in
the course of the shooting.)
Landis seems stuck — even in
the bar scene, he replays every
moment, as if he were trying to
find a way to make the damn
thing work. Consequently, the
episode never establishes any
kind of rhythm, even once the
fantasy sequences take over.
Though the second part was
assembled by experts — Spiel
berg, photographer Allen
Daviau (who worked with him
on E.T.) and the king of editors,
Michael Kahn — it suffers from
problems in rhythm, too,
though for different reasons. Its
source, "Kick the Can," was an
original teleplay by George
Clayton Johnson, directed by
Lamont Johnson and featuring
Ernest Truex, Russell Collins and
John Marley; in it, an unhappy
old man in a rest home managed
to turn himself and some of his
fellow golden agers into chil
dren. You can see what drew
Spielberg, the most gifted young
heart in American movies, to this
particular story, but he forgot to
bring his wit with him, and the
results are earnest and dawdling
— more silly than charming, and
more sentimental than touch
ing. Daviau has made the mis
take of bathing the parlor of the
rest home in a sunset glow, and
Spielberg goes in for too many
close-ups — especially of Scat
man Crothers, whom he (un
wisely) cast in a variation on the
Ernest Truex part. Crothers
looks great on camera, but he
talks with lethal slowness, as if
he were lecturing a crew of
naughty four-year-olds. I never
saw the original episode, but
I've read a synopsis of it, and it
seems to methatallofthealtera
tions Spielberg and Richard
Matheson and Josh Regan made
in it — changing the Truex
character into a sort of shaman
and then having the old folks
discover that they'd rather have

their old bodies back again —
tame it and thin it out into a
homilectic soup by the end.
The Dante and Miller seg
ments have also taken consider
able liberties with their sources.
Richard Matheson adapted both
— in the first case a Jerome Bixby
story called "It's a Good Life,"
which had a Serling script on TV
(and a cast that included Cloris
Leachman), in the second one of
his own pieces, "Nightmare at
20,000 Feet," which Richard
Donner had directed for the
show with William Shatner and,
in a gremlin's costume, the
celebrated acrobat Nick Cravat.
And they are both small gems.
(Spielberg and Landis, who pro
duced the entire anthology,
were smart to place these
episodes in the penultimate and
final slots.) Bixby's 1953 story,
which is creepily effective but
leaves an unpleasant aftertaste,
concerns a little boy who,
through his power to turn his
thoughts into realities, has en
slaved not only his own family
but the entire town he lives in.
Matheson and Dante have
added a character from an ear
lier Zone, Helen Foley, a school
teacher (Serling claimed he took
the name of his own favorite
teacher), softened the ending,
and made it funny. They've also
found a way to incorporate a
completely consistent and very
imaginative visual style, which
Dante implemented with the aid
of production designer Jim Bis
sel and photographer John Hara.
When Anthony (Jeremy Licht)
brings Helen (Kathleen Quinlan)
home to supper, she finds that
he lives in a house with a TV set
blaring a different cartoon in
each room, and a decor that
might have been designed by
Tex Avery or Chuck Jones. An
thony thinks in cartoons — the
monsters he produces are ber
serk animated creatures, and the
cartoons he conjures up on the
set are Max Fleischer-like
nightmares. (At the most horrify
ing moment, the deft young
actor Jeremy Licht does a hoarse
imitation of Bugs Bunny.) But
the wild, outre look of the
episode keeps us laughing even
at the scariest parts — as does
the caricaturing of TV veterans
William Schallert and Kevin
McCarthy as two of Anthony's

prisoners. The last five minutes
are a letdown, unfortunately,
not only because the tone be
comes benign but also because
Dante and the designers appear
to have used up all their best
ideas by then — and the final
image, which needs to be glori
ously inventive to offset the
switch in tone, turns out to be a
bit drab.
Matheson's published tale
"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,"
about an airline passenger who
sees a gremlin on the wing of his
plane, is nondescript, but each
time he dramatizes it he makes it
a little better by improving on
the central character. When Wil
liam Shatner played him, he was
a salesman who had recently had
a nervous breakdown; in the
movie, he has metamorphosed
into a computer expert whose
fear of flying leaves him hysteri
cal, irrational and at least partly
incoherent as the plane barrels
through fiercer and fiercer
weather. Because Matheson and
Miller have given the passenger
Valentine such an extreme case
of fear of flying, the fact that he is
the only person on board to see
the monster becomes an hilari
ous, jangly device. And John
Lithgow gives a virtuoso perfor
mance, improvising splendidly
in a rhythm all hisown (he seems
desperately, uproariously
locked in) and playing off the
other actors — bouncing or col
liding might be a better word —
in constantly surprising ways.
George Miller has built the en
tire episode around Lithgow,
and his craftsmanship is seam
less; only afterwards do you
realize how ingeniously he set
up the tension between oppos
ing points of view, how expertly
he balanced comedy and sus

pense, and how cleverly he cast
the other roles. If TV shows like
The Twilight Zone were cus
tomarily directed by directors of
George Miller's rank, or Joe
Dante's, it would be difficult to
tear oneself away from the set
and go to the movies.
Many people who watched
The Twilight Zone as kids con
sider it a fond part of their child
hood, and the regularity with
which reruns of the show turn
up on afternoon and late-night
TV indicates that viewers still de
rive pleasure from it. In the late
'50s and early '60s, when it first
aired, it provided audiences
with the only source of black
comedy available on television
apart from Alfred Hitchcock Pre
sents (which had begun in 1955,
four years earlier). In nifty half
hour packages, it presented a
consistently high-caliber series
of science fiction and fantasy
stories — many of which con

tained such thrilling O. Henry
twists that many of us recall
them in detail 20 years later. And
though they represented the
work of dozens of writers and
directors, the style of the show's
host and coordinator, Rod Serl
ing, was so distinctive — like the
facetious, razor-clip voice that
has given a livelihood to so many
impersonators — that most of us
probably assumed all the stories
came out of his head. (He did in
fact write some of the most fam
ous ones.)
The Twilight Zone: The Movie
begins with an acknowledge
ment of the way in which Serling
and the TV show captured our

imaginations two decades ago.
In a prologue directed by John
Landis, a couple of friends (Al
bert Brooks and Dan Aykroyd)
driving a badly lit road late at
night move from an informal
trivia game — Guess the TV
Theme Music — to an energetic
exchange of favorite bits from
The Twilight Zone. This intro
ductory passage shows off all of
Landis's best qualities: it's
casual yet spunky, with an un
disguised sophomoric appeal
and it slides into a perfectly
timed punch line. What follows
— when the laughter has died
down — is an arrangement of
four short story films, each one
more or less the length of an old
Twilight Zone episode. (The
precise will remember that dur
ing its fourth season, the show
expanded to an hour — only to
return to its original format the
next year.) Landis wrote and di
rected the infamous first
episode; the others — directed
(in chronological order) by Ste
ven Spielberg, Joe Dante (of The
Howling) and George Miller (of
the Mad Max pictures) — are all

Clayton Johnson, directed by
Lamont Johnson and featuring
Ernest Truex, Russell Collins and
John Marley; in it, an unhappy
old man in a rest home managed
to turn himself and some of his
fellow golden agers into chil
dren. You can see what drew
Spielberg, the most gifted young
heart in American movies, to this
particular story, but he forgot to
bring his wit with him, and the
results are earnest and dawdling
— more silly than charming, and
more sentimental than touch
ing. Daviau has made the mis
take of bathing the parlor of the
rest home in a sunset glow, and
Spielberg goes in for too many
close-ups — especially of Scat
man Crothers, whom he (un
wisely) cast in a variation on the
Ernest Truex part. Crothers
looks great on camera, but he
talks with lethal slowness, as if
he were lecturing a crew of
naughty four-year-olds. I never
saw the original episode, but
I've read a synopsis of it, and it
seems to methatallofthealtera
tions Spielberg and Richard
Matheson and Josh Regan made
in it — changing the Truex
character into a sort of shaman
and then having the old folks
discover that they'd rather have

their old bodies back again —
tame it and thin it out into a
homilectic soup by the end.
The Dante and Miller seg
ments have also taken consider
able liberties with their sources.
Richard Matheson adapted both
— in the first case a Jerome Bixby
story called "It's a Good Life,"
which had a Serling script on TV
(and a cast that included Cloris
Leachman), in the second one of
his own pieces, "Nightmare at
20,000 Feet," which Richard
Donner had directed for the
show with William Shatner and,
in a gremlin's costume, the
celebrated acrobat Nick Cravat.
And they are both small gems.
(Spielberg and Landis, who pro
duced the entire anthology,
were smart to place these
episodes in the penultimate and
final slots.) Bixby's 1953 story,
which is creepily effective but
leaves an unpleasant aftertaste,
concerns a little boy who,
through his power to turn his
thoughts into realities, has en
slaved not only his own family
but the entire town he lives in.
Matheson and Dante have
added a character from an ear
lier Zone, Helen Foley, a school
teacher (Serling claimed he took
the name of his own favorite
teacher), softened the ending,
and made it funny. They've also
found a way to incorporate a
completely consistent and very
imaginative visual style, which
Dante implemented with the aid
of production designer Jim Bis
sel and photographer John Hara.
When Anthony (Jeremy Licht)
brings Helen (Kathleen Quinlan)
home to supper, she finds that
he lives in a house with a TV set
blaring a different cartoon in
each room, and a decor that
might have been designed by
Tex Avery or Chuck Jones. An
thony thinks in cartoons — the
monsters he produces are ber
serk animated creatures, and the
cartoons he conjures up on the
set are Max Fleischer-like
nightmares. (At the most horrify
ing moment, the deft young
actor Jeremy Licht does a hoarse
imitation of Bugs Bunny.) But
the wild, outre look of the
episode keeps us laughing even
at the scariest parts — as does
the caricaturing of TV veterans
William Schallert and Kevin
McCarthy as two of Anthony's

prisoners. The last five minutes
are a letdown, unfortunately,
not only because the tone be
comes benign but also because
Dante and the designers appear
to have used up all their best
ideas by then — and the final
image, which needs to be glori
ously inventive to offset the
switch in tone, turns out to be a
bit drab.
Matheson's published tale
"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,"
about an airline passenger who
sees a gremlin on the wing of his
plane, is nondescript, but each
time he dramatizes it he makes it
a little better by improving on
the central character. When Wil
liam Shatner played him, he was
a salesman who had recently had
a nervous breakdown; in the
movie, he has metamorphosed
into a computer expert whose
fear of flying leaves him hysteri
cal, irrational and at least partly
incoherent as the plane barrels
through fiercer and fiercer
weather. Because Matheson and
Miller have given the passenger
Valentine such an extreme case
of fear of flying, the fact that he is
the only person on board to see
the monster becomes an hilari
ous, jangly device. And John
Lithgow gives a virtuoso perfor
mance, improvising splendidly
in a rhythm all hisown (he seems
desperately, uproariously
locked in) and playing off the
other actors — bouncing or col
liding might be a better word —
in constantly surprising ways.
George Miller has built the en
tire episode around Lithgow,
and his craftsmanship is seam
less; only afterwards do you
realize how ingeniously he set
up the tension between oppos
ing points of view, how expertly
he balanced comedy and sus

pense, and how cleverly he cast
the other roles. If TV shows like
The Twilight Zone were cus
tomarily directed by directors of
George Miller's rank, or Joe
Dante's, it would be difficult to
tear oneself away from the set
and go to the movies.
