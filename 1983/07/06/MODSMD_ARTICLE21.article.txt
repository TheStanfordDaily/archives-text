On the other hand, there is
little pleasure to be had at Trad
ing Places, in which two revolt
ing old men, stock broker
brothers played by Ralph Bel
lamy and Don Ameche, betting
over the relative influences of
genetics and environment,
humiliate and fire a young white
executive (Dan Aykroyd) and re
place him with a wily black con
man (Eddie Murphy). In the
charming 1954 English comedy
Man with a Million, another pair
of frivolous old codgers make a
similarly elaborate wager (over
whether a man with no other
funds can live comfortably on a
million pounds for a set period
without actually spending a
penny of it), but the director of
Trading Places, )ohn Landis,
doesn't possess the delicacy of
the makers of that earlier, low
key film, and he can't make the
premise of the Timothy Harris-
Herschel Weingrod script plaus
ible on any level. Besides, the
sportsmen in Man with a Million
didn't ruin anyone's life. Despite
the prodigiously gifted Eddie
Murphy, Trading Places is a sour,
infuriating picture — infuriating
both because the machinations
of the brothers outrage rather
than amuse us and because
Landis has the nerve to recycle
ideas from Arthur
