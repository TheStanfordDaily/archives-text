USSR warns Kohl on missiles
Moscow — Soviet President Yuri Andropov
warned West Germany yesterday that it faces an
increased military threat from Moscow and a
downturn in relations with the Soviet Bloc if it per
mits the deployment of U.S. cruise and Pershing 2
missiles on its territory.
Arguing that existing Soviet missiles are only a
counterbalance to the nuclear forces of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, Andropov told West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl that "if American
missiles are deployed on West German soil, the
situation will change."
After more than three hours of talks yesterday,
Kohl described the Soviet leader as a "man bril
liantly aware of all political problems." He told
reporters that the talks had taken place in a "com
petitive climate" but he nonetheless expressed
satisfaction.
To all appearances, neither side minced words
or backed away from well-established positions.
The focus of the conversations was the planned
deployment of 572 U.S. cruise and Pershing 2 mis
siles, which Kohl said would begin on schedule
late this year in West Germany, followed by instal
lations in Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium and
Italy, unless U.S. and Soviet negotiators in Geneva
reach an agreement limiting intermediate-range
missiles in Europe.
Echoing Tikhonov's remarks at the Kremlin ban
quet Monday, Andropov warned that Moscow
would interpret the deployment of missiles in
West Germany, which has agreed to accept all 108

of the advanced Pershing 2 weapons, as "the revi
val of the threat of a war against the U.S.S.R. being
unleashed from German soil."
Reagan speaks to educators
Los Angeles — President Reagan told members
of the American Federation of Teachers yesterday
that he wants them to be partners in his fight to
revive public schools, and took frequent, pointed
slaps at their rival union, the National Education
Association, which he accused of "frightening and
brainwashing American schoolchildren."
About 150 of the 3000 AFT delegates here walked
out as Reagan began his speech, and there was
frequent hissing and snickering during his re
marks.
Reagan called for stricter school discipline and
higher academic standards, and set a goal of rais
ing verbal and math scores in the College Board
tests by 50 points to compensate for the decline of
the last 20 years.
"The AFT wants to upgrade standards, including
emphasis on testing both students and beginning
teachers, changing curriculum to strengthen
academic requirements and increasing homework
assignments. So do I. The AFT believes in stricter
discipline codes in school, including provisions to
remove students who have histories of repeated
disruptive behavior. So do I."
Court approves state prayers
Washington — While leaving unscathed its ban

of organized prayer in the public schools, the Sup
reme Court ruled yesterday that Congress and
legislatures do not violate the Constitution's sep
aration of church and stat&even when chaplains
are paid with taxes to lead daily devotionals.
"From colonial times through the founding of
the Republic and ever since, the practice of legisla
tive prayer has co-existed with the principles of
. . . religious freedom," Chief Justice Warren
Burger wrote.
Burger's opinion did not even mention the 1962
decision that barred organized prayer in the public
schools.
Shultz negotiates in Damascus
Damascus, Syria — Secretary of State George
Shultz spent last night in Damascus to find out if
there is a possibility of getting Syria to negotiate
withdrawal of its troops from Lebanon. His visit
appeared to offer no hope of movement toward a
pullout.
Shultz in advance ruled out the Syrian's key de
mand that Israel withdraw its 28,000 troops in cent
ral and southern Lebanon unconditionally and un
ilaterally before the Syrian's remove their 50,000-
man army from the eastern and northern part of
the country.
Today's weather

ing. Lows in the mid-50s, highs in the 60s and 70s.
