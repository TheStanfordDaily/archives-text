Not just a job . ..
Learn to work in an editor's
world! Our on-the-job training
program starts this week. Learn the
ins and outs of journalism from our
corps of experienced and friendly
journalists. And if novels are more
your speed, how can you go
wrong following in the footsteps of
Hemingway, Twain and Whitman?
Also, new reporters should
check with Alan to make sure that
their W-2 forms are in order for
upcoming payroll. No W-2, no
$$$$$. Sorry.
