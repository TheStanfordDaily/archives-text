# Campus group signs Grateful Dead for concert at Frost
## 
### JENNIFER ROSEN 
Despite recent negotiation
conflicts, The Grateful Dead will
appear at Frost Amphitheater on
August 20 and 21.
In addition, The San Francisco
Chronicle reported Sunday that
the Tubes and the Beach Boys
will perform on campus in the
fall. However, Vicky Holt, direc
tor of the Committee for Con
temporary Entertainment
(COCE), said she would not re
lease any information until to
day.
Members of the Concert Net
work, the student group re
sponsible for sponsoring the
Grateful Dead concert, voiced
dissatisfaction over the final ar
rangements with the Dead's
promoter, Bill Graham.
"We are not particularly
pleased with the arrangement. It
was less than we had hoped,"
said Concert Network Director
Scott Davis. "We got higher than
we would have, but not what I
consider fair for Frost."
Aiming to bring rental costs
for Frost in line with other local
facilities, Davis said he "set a
harder bottom line than typical"
with Graham.
According to Bill Graham Pre
sents' Vice President Danny
Scher, although negotiations
were difficult, an acceptable
final contract was reached.
"The outcome is OK, but I
don't feel we were treated fairly
in the process of negotiations,"
he said.
Scher said it is difficult to
compare Frost to other local
facilities, such as San Francisco's
Cow Palace or Berkeley's Greek
Theater, because they are like
"apples and oranges" in an
overall cost picture.
"It's a lot more work to do a
show at Frost because it doesn't
have a dressing room or loading
access, among other things," he
said.
While Davis agreed that Frost
is mainly "a big bowl with grass
and a stage," he said it is com

parable to other local facilities in
terms of draw and aesthetics.
Although Davis said that Bill
Graham handles shows "very
productively," he would like to
see more student involvement.
"In my opinion students
should be more actively in
volved with providing shows.
From the viewpoint of Frost and
Maples (Pavilion) concerts, Bill
Graham Presents has been the
only one to do the major shows
â€” they will handle the entire
show if you let them."
Concert Network began in
late October and has handled
one Pat Benatar concert since
then. For the Benatar show, the
Concert network provided cam
pus security, clean-up facilities,
portable toilets and stagehands.
The Concert Network current
members include the Chaparral,
the ASSU, and the Band. The
Network extends membership
to any student group experi
enced in providing student en
tertainment.
Scher said that Bill Graham
Presents plans to recruit Stan
ford students in the fall. "Stu
dents should have the opportun
ity to learn," he said, "but if they
aren't experienced they could
be jeapordizing the safety of
concert-goers."
Similarly, COCE Chairman
Paul Szczesiul said that student
participation in concerts is a val
uable learning experience.
"It is very important for stu
dent organizations to be in
volved in production," he said.
"Learning is one of the reasons
why concerts happen at univer
sities."
According to Szczesiul, the
Concert Network is one of many
groups who have submitted
concert proposals to COCE.
During the past year Yost House
sponsored a Keith Jarret con
cert, Hillel sponsored Chava Al
berstein, and the Stanford Chris
tian Fellowship sponsored Paul
Stookey.
