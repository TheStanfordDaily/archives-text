# Judge's gavel will determine fate of stolen property
## 
### KRISHNA WEST 
A judge's gavel—rather than an auctioneer's—will de
cide the fate of $50,000 to $75,000 in unclaimed stolen
property that was to be auctioned off at the Stanford
Police Department parking lot later this week.
The stolen property, recovered from the possession
of convicted burglar Robert Lee O'Connor, was to have
been auctioned off on July 8 and 9. According to Stan
ford Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer, the police had
exhausted all means to locate the burglary victims.
But O'Connor and his girlfriend, Nancy Burt, now
claim the leftover property belongs to them.
"The police seized a houseload of property. . .they
took everything in her (Burt's) house," said Rich Rogia,
Burt's attorney. "There exists a group of personal prop
erty that nobody has identified as stolen. We're only
asking for what is rightfully Nancy's."
O'Connor pleaded guilty to 21 counts of burglary in
the area after his arrest in November 1982 at his resi
dence in La Honda. Police obtained search warrants
after seeing a stolen Stanford vehicle parked outside his
house and found goods worth over $2 million there, in
Burt's Montara home and in several storage lockers.
Burt pleaded guilty to one count of receiving stolen
property, and has been sentenced to a year in the county
jail. O'Connors estranged wife, Maureen Martinez, also
found guilty of receiving stolen property, is serving time
at the California Institution for Women in Frontera.
Martinez correctly identified and reclaimed her per
sonal property through her parents. Only Burt and

O'Connor are trying to quash the police department's
efforts to dispose of the property in the manner origi
nally specified by Superior Court Judge Robert Foley,
Niemeyer said.
"Nancy Burt admitted that O'Connor, a notorious
burglar, had given her some of the property. She
pleaded guilty to a felony charge," said Tom Hanford,
the prosecuting attorney in the O'Connor case, "and
our position is that she can't positively identify the un
claimed property. She has no bills of sale or proofs of
purchase."
O'Connor began to say that all the unclaimed prop
erty was his only recently, Niemeyer said.
Foley said he ordered the auction to be postponed
because "they (the co-defendents) have a right to be
heard. From what I understand, some of the confiscated
property may legally and legitimately be theirs."
Both Rogia and Hanford agree that the final decision
will be up to the judge. "The judge will have to deter
mine who gets the property," Hanford said, and
whether there will still be an auction.
Stanford was one of the many areas affected during
O'Connors 1978-82 burglary spree. The so-called "jog
ging burglar" would reconnoiter prospective victim's
homes while jogging through affluent neighborhoods.
He may have been involved in as many as 181 burglaries
in the area and in a number of others across the nation.
O'Connor is now serving a 19-year jail sentence at the
Folsom State Prison.
Niemeyer said the police department had expended

"in excess of $1000" in storage costs, and more than half
of the goods confiscated still have not been claimed.
People who believe their belongings are in the storage
trailer can still claim them, provided they can positively
identify their possessions, he said.
