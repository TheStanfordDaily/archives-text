## Shultz seeks mideast progress 
### 
Jidda, Saudi Arabia — Secretary of State George
Shultz began his search for renewed diplomatic
momentum in the Middle East here Monday in a
strategy session with U.S. emissaries and a mid
night meeting with Saudi King Fahd.
An aide to Shultz said it would take "a miracle"
to produce an immediate breakthrough in the
light of the prospects at hand.
Shultz arrived by U.S. Air Force plane Monday
afternoon from Pakistan, the final stop on a tourof
East and South Asia, and was met by Saudi Foreign
Minister Saud Faisal and other officials.
With Shultz at his elbow, Saud told reporters
that the visit indicates "the United States is doing
everything possible in order to achieve peace in
the Middle East in general and in Lebanon in par
ticular, which could lead to the withdrawal of Is
raeli troops from that country."
Saud later conferred privately with Shultz be
fore a planned late-night meeting with Fahd, who
was reported to be at prayer in nearby Mecca
when Shultz arrived. Saudi Arabia and the rest of
the Islamic world are observing the prayer and fast
days of Ramadan.
Shultz conferred for about two hours on the
17th floor of a hotel-like royal guest house Monday
with his travelling Middle East policy team, au
gmented by U.S. emissaries in the area. These
include special envoys Philip Habib, Morris
Draper and Richard Fairbanks.
Also participating was U.S. Ambassador to Saudi
Arabia Richard Murphy, who is an expert on the
Arab world and a former U.S. ambassadorto Syria.
The Habib team has been probing for diplomatic
flexibility in visits to Jerusalem, Beirut and Jeddah
while Shultz was traveling through Asia the past 10
days. A participant in the meeting said the team
believes a serious prospect exists for various man
euvers in those three capitals that could increase
the pressures on Syria to withdraw its forces from
Lebanon.
That prospect, however, was said to have been
reduced by the recent Washington leak of a U.S.
proposal that Israel set a "date certain" for with
drawal of its troops from Lebanon. U.S. sources

here called the leak damaging and professed to be
puzzled about why and by whom the disclosure
had been made, in what they said was a distorted
form.
Shultz's game plan, according to his aides, calls
for assessment of the Saudi factor in his confer
ence with Fahd, followed by a visit to Beirut during
daylight hours yesterday to see President Amin
Cemayel and other officials.
The main message there, officials said, will be
one of continued U.S. support and reassurance
for the Lebanese government.
Late yesterday Shultz was to fly to Damascus, the
crucial stop, for meetings with President Hafez
Assad and his senior aides. The key question is
whether the Syrian government, despite its hard
line public stance, is ready to approach negotia
tions with Lebanon on the withdrawal of its troops
from that country.
Washington Post correspondent Herbert De
nton reported from Beirut that an editorial Mon
day morning in Al Baath, the newspaper of Syria's
ruling Baath Party, asked, "Why is Shultz coming
back to the Middle East?" The editorial added that
if Shultz has returned to get Syria to accept the
Lebanese-Israeli troop-withdrawal agreement,
"then this is an impossible mission."
State-run Damascus Radio suggested that
Shultz's efforts were intended to improve Presi
dent Reagan's image for the presidential cam
paign. But it said, "Shultz will not resurrect the
stillborn American-Israeli agreement which they
are trying to impose on Lebanon, but he will try to
render a new service to expansionist, aggressive Is
raeli strategy."
The assessment of the Habib team, sources said,
is that recent Syrian action to split and dominate
the Palestine Liberation Organization has in
creased the intransigence in Damascus by seem
ing to illustrate that tough action pays off.
The U.S. officials have not given up hope, how
ever, that Syria will see withdrawal of its troops
from Lebanon is in its interest, because only such
action will bring about parallel Israeli withdrawal.
