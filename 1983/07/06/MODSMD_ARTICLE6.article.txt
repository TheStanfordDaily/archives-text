# Malawi pays price for its one-man rule
## 
### 
Blantyre, Malawi—Malawi, a
tiny capitalist nation known
for its stability in the midst of
wars, chaos and socialist
malaise in southern Africa, is
finally beginning to pay the
price for years of one-man
rule.
The country is literally the
creation and life work of its
octogenarian president, Hast
ings Kamuzu Banda, an
American and British-licensed
physician. Ever since he
brought Malawi to indepen
dence from Britain in 1964, be
has run it as his personal fief
dom with his 6 million people
acceding to his unquestioned
authority.
By the standards of their
neighbors, however, Mala
wians have prospered. The
country, the size of Pennsyl
vania, feeds itself, a rarity in
Africa, and generally has been
spared internal strife.
Banda is president for life,
but as that life begins to ebb
there are signs that the rot of
age is beginning to gnaw away
at his heretofore iron grip on
the nation.
So, despite government
denials, the fight for the suc
cession is under way with a
vengeance, highlighted by the
deaths in mysterious cir
cumstances of four senior of
ficials six weeks ago.
The drama, which involves
few verifiable facts but count
less rumors, has all the qual
ities of a peculiarly African
version of "King Lear". His Ex

cellency the Life President
Ngwazi Dr. Kamuzu Banda, as
he is formally known, is the
protagonist.
He is the ngwazi, the re
vered tribal leader, the
champion in Malawi's
Chichewa language. One of
the sayings of his Malawi Con
gress Party, the country's only
political organization, is
"Kamuzu knows best."
"The Malawi style is what
Kamuzu says; it's just that, and
then it's finished," he told his
people 19 years ago.
"Whether anyone likes it or
not, that is how it is going to
be here. No nonsense, no
nonsense. You can't have
everybody deciding what to
do."
Banda's official age is 77, but
most longtime observers here
think he is 85 or older. Even
though he looks robust and
healthy in his public appear
ances, there is growing belief
that he has good and bad days
and that the bad days are in
creasing.
A diminuative man who
brandishes an ivory chieftain's
stick and a fly whisk, he is an
outspoken foe of communism
and the only public black
friend of white-ruled South
Africa. An avid reader of
Roman history, he has told
underlings, "The reason the
Russians are such barbarians
is that they were never con
quered by the Romans."
