Beirut, Lebanon — Yasser
Arafat has apparently assented
to rebel demands for sharp re
strictions on his powers as
chairman of the Palestine Libera
tion Organization, according to
reports Monday from Tunis and
Damascus.
The concessions, in trade for
saving his position, surfaced as a
six-member mediation delega
tion of the PLO Executive Com
mittee met with Syrian officials
in an effort to quell the two
month-old rebellion within
Fatah, the PLO's largest faction
and previously Arafat's main
base of support.
According to the reports,
Arafat has agreed to share lead
ership of the organization pend
ing a congress of all members.
That is a rebel demand that
Arafat loyalists had said he
would never accept.
The PLO chairman has also ag
reed to formally renounce Pres
ident Reagan's Middle East
peace initiative and thereby ex
tinguish any flickering hope that
Arafat would give Jordan's King
Hussein the mandate he says he
needs to negotiate on behalf of
Palestinians.
Arafat's acquiesccnce to the
rebels would appear to move the
PLO away from his more moder
ate position and toward the re
bel's hard-line stance, adding to
the complexity of Secretary of
State George Shultz's quest for
the withdrawal of PLO, Syrian
and Israeli forces from Lebanon.
Col. Said Mousa, the rebel
leader better known as Abu
Mousa, said in an interview pub
lished in The Guardian of Lon
don Monday that the rebels are
committed to a policy of "no re
conciliation, no recognition and

no negotiation" with Israel.
"We know that Arafat wants to
leave Lebanon," Abu Mousa
said, suggesting that the PLO
chairman is prepared to agree to
dispersing fighters in Arab coun
tries as he did last summer in the
evacuation of Beirut.
"There can be no armed
struggle from Algeria or
Yemen," Abu Mousa said. "If
Arafat continued to send out
fighters, from where could we
say 'no' to him? No one would
listen to us."
Speaking at his headquarters
in the Bekaa Valley, Abu Mousa
said he does not believe in a

Palestinian state on the West
Bank, except as a halfway stage
to a united Palestine.
He said he is opposed to
negotiations with Israel or rec
ognition of Israel.
Asked if he envisaged expel
ling Jews from an eventual Pales
tinian state, he said: "No, why
should we? Not the Jews who
were present in Palestine, but
those who emigrated to Pales
tine with the rise of Israel are not
Palestinians . . . They must go
back to the countries they came
from. They are nationals of
lurope — of France, of Britain."
