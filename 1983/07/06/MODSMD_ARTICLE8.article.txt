## Steve Zansberg How the Freeze helped the MX 
### 
Not often do you find in a newspaper column a
suggestion to read a magazine article, but that is
precisely the purpose of this particular column. I
urge you, if you are concerned about the arms
race, to read Elizabeth Drew's article in the June
20th New Yorker, entitled, "A Political Journal."
Drew masterfully depicts the political jockeying in
Congress that led to the recent approval of the MX
missile. I believe that if you read this article you
will not be able to avoid being repulsed by the lack
of rationality and particularly the concern for fu
ture consequences will pervade the weapons
acquisition process in this country. I hope that
after you read her article, you will be inspired to
take action to do everything in your power, and
you are more powerful in this matter than you
probably think, to stop this ludicrous weapon
from going any further.
Perhaps I react so strongly to Drew's article be
cause it confirms one of my previously uncon
firmed beliefs: that politics takes precedence over

reason to build this missile other

tuency it has developed over the
years through vested interest.

sanity even in the field of nuclear weapons policy.
I have studied the evolution of the MX missile and
debate surrounding it, for several years now, and I
have failed to discover a rational reason to build
this missile other than the fact that we are capable
of doing so, that many weapons designers have
spent time and money preparing to do so, and that
building it will benefit a powerful constituency it
has developed over the years through vested in
terest. The Scowcroft Commission report, which
supported deployment of 100 MX missiles in vul
nerable Minuteman silos, gave little military jus
tification for the weapon (and no convincing milit
ary rationale), but relied heavily on the symbolic
value of deployment: we need this system to sig
nal to the Soviets our resolve and commitment to
national security objectives with or without arms
control agreements.
Now it seems to me, as it does to the Con
gressmen who voted for the MX, that this
symbolic value does not justify such a costly and
dangerously destabilizing weapon. Drew's article
identifies the actual motivation of the Democratic
MX supporters as being completely independent
of the MX's military or symbolic value; these men,
functioning as political animals, are concerned
with positioning themselves appropriately so as
not to be accused in the next election of being
"soft" on defense.
Here we see the first unexpected side effects of
the popular freeze proposal, also an object of
manipulation by these men; in order to maintain a
politically safe, middle-of-the-road position, these
men planned to cast their vote for the MX after
they had voted to cut defense in the overall
budget, after they had voted against Kenneth
Adelman, and after they had voted for the freeze
initiative.
Thus, they can at once support a freeze on
further production or deployment of nuclear

weapons and give their approval for the produc
tion and deployment of 1000 new nuclear
warheads. They worked closely with the Scowcroft
Commission and the Administration to help them
justify their support of the MX to their more liberal
democratic supporters. They tried to convince this
constituency (and perhaps they've convinced
themselves) that by "giving" Reagan the MX they
would put pressure on him to produce an arms
control treaty to their liking. They argued that if
Reagan does not make progress in arms control (it is
not clear how they will judge this) they will cancel the
MX in the next round of appropriations. Of course it is
not likely that they will be able to do so now that they
have given the missile the OK for development and
flight testing.
Certainly Reagan will argue that he is pursuing
serious arms control and that he needs the con
tinuing MX program to reach an agreement. Hav
ing set the precedent for accepting such a line of
reasoning, the Congressmen will be hard-pressed
to turn their backs on their earlier decisions and
cancel the MX.
If you find it hard to believe that politics is the
driving force behind the arms race or the MX deci
sion, please, read the Drew article. You should be
concerned that the most destabilizing strategic
nuclear weapon to date, one which makes
launch-on warning and thus nuclear war more
likely, is being railroaded through Congress, be
fore an unsuspecting public, all for the sake of
powerful vested interests and the blind political
ambitions of the Congressional "positioners."
The Drew article should make it clear to freeze
supporters that while Congressmen are paying lip
service to (and casting votes for) the amorphous,
non-binding freeze initiative; tangible, costly and
dangerously destabilizing weapons systems are

In order to maintain a politically
safe, middle-of-the-road position,
these men planned to cast their
vote for the MX after they had
voted to cut defense in the overall
budget, after they had voted
against Kenneth Adelman, and

initiative.

serving to counterbalance their support for the
freeze.
The most effective thing freeze supporters can
do now is to remind those Congressmen who
supported the MX last round that they will be held
accountable at the polls if they allow this debacle
to continue any further. While a freeze is attractive
in theory, and would be attractive in practice, it
will be immeasurably more difficult, if not impos
sible, to get a freeze after our government has
officially decided to deploy any of the MX, Trident
11, B-1, Cruise or Pershings it plans for moderniza
tion. It seems the bumper stickers are wrong; the
crucial first step should not be "Freeze," it should
be "Stop the MX." Without this first step, there
will be no second step taken towards a freeze.
Please, read the Drew article; see for yourself.
Then write your Congressman.
