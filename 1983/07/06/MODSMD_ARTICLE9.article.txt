## Pollution: we can no longer ignore it 
### 
Don't look now, but there's an
omnipotent evil gaining on us.
Deadlier than the bomb and
with consequences far more
fearsome than nuclear annihila
tion, it has been with us since
time immemorial. But we be
came aware of the menaceonly a
few short years ago.
With all of its billions of parts,
this creature spans the oceans
and continents of Earth; its vici
ous tentacles have even reached
outer space. It can exist in any
kind of environment. Gum
wrappers lining our streets,
abandoned metallic junk orbit
ing our planet and toxic waste
dumps contaminating our life
support systems constitute just a
few of the animal's numerous
body cells. Its threat to our
well-being is compounded by
the fact that each and every one
of us is guilty of aiding and abet
ting its cancerous growth.
The monster is called artificial
waste.
The world's industrially de
veloped nations are perhaps the
greatest generators of such
waste. . .they suffer the natural
results of affluence. Whether
the cause is overproduced un
derconsumption becomes a
negligible economic discussion,
because the culprit—and
victim —is invariably human.
The United States is an obvi
ous and immediate example.
Statistics have shown that a
single American in any one day
consumes enough to support a
Third World family of three for an
entire month. These same statis
tics explain why the phrase
"Keep America Beautiful" is
nearly extinct.
Right here in the Bay Area, the

relatively harmless electronics
industry produces stifling high
tech smog. San Jose Mercury
columnist Steve Lopez, calling
the Santa Clara Valley air
"deadly," has compared its
color to powdered cocoa (a de
scription especially befitting our
tap water). According to last
Tuesday's Daily, Stanford Uni
versity alone generates a million
pounds of toxic waste every
year; the University must now
use landfills in the state of
Washington because all the dis
posal sites in California have
been closed until new ones can
be found.
I hope they don't decide to
"discover" one in my backyard.
Public antipathy has, thus far,
been focused against hazardous
wastes directly affecting man
kind. I submit that waste in any
form, unless recycled complete
ly or rendered totally harmless
is detrimental to, and often por
tends an ominous future for all
life.
Waste mismanagement, ig
norantly serving diverse, selfish
interests, has ruled over our wel
fare for too long. Succumbing to
the old "like it or lump it"
philosophy, we have ignored
personal responsibility and
procrastinated preventive ac
tion. The criminals who have
been identified are being
punished far too leniently: our
governmental watchdogs have
been snoozing on the job.
We cannot live in a landfill
graveyard. Our attitudes to
wards the impact of institutional
and individual waste must there
fore be reassessed and restruc
tured. The dragon must be trap
ped and tamed, or slain. Global
survival depends on it.
