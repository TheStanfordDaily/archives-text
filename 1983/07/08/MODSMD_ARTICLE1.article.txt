# Dean follows suggestion, rejects Mosher's appeal
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
The dean of the school of
humanities and sciences an
nounced yesterday that he
has denied a grievance filed
by a student who claimed the
termination of his doctoral
candidacy by the anthropol
ogy department was unjust.
Dean Norman Wessells
based his decision to deny
Steven Mosher's grievance
on the recommendations of a
panel he appointed to inves
tigate the grievance.
The grievance committee's
report—released to the press
yesterday—stated that the an
thropology department was
justified in terminating
Mosher's doctoral candidacy.
Mosher's candidacy was
ended Feb. 24 when the an
thropology faculty unanim
ously agreed with an inves

tigative committee report
that found that Mosher's al
legedly unethical conduct in
the People's Republic of
China had endangered his re
search subjects.
The precise reasons for
Mosher's termination —
contained in a confidential
report of the investigative
committee—have not been
made public. However,
Mosher has claimed that the
anthropology department
was acting on the basis of his
publication of an article in the
Taiwan press about forced
abortions in China and on the
basis of slanderous accusa
tions by his ex-wife.
But the grievance
committee—composed of
Emeritus Profs. Ernest Hilgard
and Gordon Wright and Uni
versity of Pennsylvania Prof.

Ward Goodenough— found
"no evidence of unfairness
or impropriety in the Inves
tigative Committee's handl
ing of the case." The panel
concluded that there was no
reason for reversing the
committee's recommenda
tion and decision.
"The Investigative Com
mittee's findings, taken all
together, do not reveal
