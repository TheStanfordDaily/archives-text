# Dean follows suggestion, rejects Mosher's appeal
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
The dean of the school of
humanities and sciences an
nounced yesterday that he
has denied a grievance filed
by a student who claimed the
termination of his doctoral
candidacy by the anthropol
ogy department was unjust.
Dean Norman Wessells
based his decision to deny
Steven Mosher's grievance
on the recommendations of a
panel he appointed to inves
tigate the grievance.
The grievance committee's
report—released to the press
yesterday—stated that the an
thropology department was
justified in terminating
Mosher's doctoral candidacy.
Mosher's candidacy was
ended Feb. 24 when the an
thropology faculty unanim
ously agreed with an inves

tigative committee report
that found that Mosher's al
legedly unethical conduct in
the People's Republic of
China had endangered his re
search subjects.
The precise reasons for
Mosher's termination —
contained in a confidential
report of the investigative
committee—have not been
made public. However,
Mosher has claimed that the
anthropology department
was acting on the basis of his
publication of an article in the
Taiwan press about forced
abortions in China and on the
basis of slanderous accusa
tions by his ex-wife.
But the grievance
committee—composed of
Emeritus Profs. Ernest Hilgard
and Gordon Wright and Uni
versity of Pennsylvania Prof.

Ward Goodenough— found
"no evidence of unfairness
or impropriety in the Inves
tigative Committee's handl
ing of the case." The panel
concluded that there was no
reason for reversing the
committee's recommenda
tion and decision.
"The Investigative Com
mittee's findings, taken all
together, do not reveal


Norman Wessells
merely honest mistakes or
ill-considered actions," the
report said. "Rather, they re
veal a pattern of dealings that
involved deliberate disregard
for the law of the host coun
try. . .a deliberate disregard
of the requests of the funding
agency. . .a manipulative ap
proach toward the people
with whom he was living and
working (and) a serious lack
of candor. .
In a july 1 letter to Mosher

explaining the grievance de
nial, Wessells told Mosher
that "the pattern of your be
havior over a lengthy period
of time, involving diverse ac
tions and separate incidents,
is inconsistent with standards
of ethical conduct approp
riate for a person entering the
profession of anthropology."
Furthermore, Wessells said
that Mosher had abused "the
student-professor relation
ship in Such an egregious
manner that it was fully
reasonable for faculty per
sons in Stanford's anthropol
ogy department to decline to

serve as your major professor
or as members for your thesis
committee."
The grievance committee
had asked Mosher to return
from Taiwan at University ex
pense to "clarify certain as
pects of the case and to justify
his grievance in person."
Mosher declined this invita
tion.
Mosher may now appeal
the denial of the grievance to
Gerald Lieberman, dean of
graduate studies.
Both Mosher and Wessells
were unavailable for com
ment.
