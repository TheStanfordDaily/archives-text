# Supreme Court decision will eliminate sex bias in pensions
## 
### 
Washington—Congressional leaders, praising a
Supreme Court ruling that may improve pension
benefits for millions of women, say the decision is
only a first step in eliminating sex bias from the
nation's insurance practices.
"It is now up to the Congress to make non
discrimination on the basis of sex the standard in
all insurance, for all people" said Sen. Bob
Packwood (R-Ore.) who is pushing for federal
legislation to accomplish that goal. Sen. Robert
Dole (R-Kan) agreed.
The court, concluding its 1982-83 term, ruled on
Wednesday that retirement plans in the future
cannot pay smaller monthly benefits to women
just because they generally live longer than men.
In other major actions, the court:
—Gave federal appeals courts a freer hand to
speed up executions of death row inmates
nationwide. The decision is expected to shorten
the life expectancy of some 1200 condemned
murderers.
—Left intact a ruling that gives states and
municipalities an advantage over private utilities
when they compete for licenses to run hydroelec
tric power plants.
—Expanded the powers of police officers to
search for weapons when stopping criminal sus
pects in automobiles. The court said police offic
ers in such circumstances may search anywhere
within a car's passenger compartment where a

weapon might be concealed.
The impact of the pension benefits decision is
expected to be far reaching. But its exact effects
are unclear. It is likely to mean bigger pension
checks for millions of women, but also could
mean that many workers of both sexes will pay
higher premiums to get the addition benefits.
Many insurance plans base pension payments
on the expectation that women, as a group, live
longer than men. For those born in this decade,
life expectancy is estimated at just over 78 years for
women and just under 71 years for men.
But the court, in its 5-4 ruling, said it violates a
section of the 1964 Civil Rights act outlawing sex
discrimination in employment to single out gen
der as the basis for insurance benefits. Smoking
habits, alcohol comsumption, weight and medical
and family history may have more to do with
longevity than one's sex, the court said.
Women's groups had argued that using life ex
pectancy figures to calculate pension benefits is
unfair because some women die earlier.
They hailed the decision Wednesday. Karen
Nusbaum, head of the National Association of
Working Women, said it is "a great victory." But,
she added, while the decision "may make a dent in
such practices, women will never be compensated
for the price already paid for decades of discrimi
nation."
