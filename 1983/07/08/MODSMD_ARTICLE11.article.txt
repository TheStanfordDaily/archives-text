## Chris Butchko Scientific community is leashing our dogma 
### 
It's good to be iiving in a new age.
These days knowledge and common
sense have entered into a new,
harmonious—although definitely not
cooperative—relationship. A great stride
has been made in the last quarter cen
tury, one that I'm sure will bring great
relief to everyone everywhere.
Simply put, the commonly held view of
the scientific community towards the
perceptive ability of us, common masses,
has changed. No longer is it true that ev
erything we believe is wrong, now it is
just that everything we hold true is use
less, and potentially harmful if taken to
extremes.

The illusion that a steel bar dropped in water will sink is
caused by a curious interaction between the bar and the
water. The bar, as we have said, actually floats, but the
water floats harder!

Those of you who are blessed enough
not to have to go high up into the West
Stack of Green Library for any library
material you may need may not re
member the old days of scientific con
tempt. In my casual (and highly time
consuming) scanning of the old
magazines in said recess of Green I have
come across countless examples of this
sort of enlightened chauvanism.
The popular quasi-literary magazines
of the '20s through the '50s would have
considered an issue a failure unless it ran
at least one article of the "Did You
Know?" or "Scientists Say" stripe. I have
no idea who compiled these things, as no
scientist could have had time to compile
all the ridiculous minutae necessary to fill
page after page with this sort of uncon
nected revelations.
"DID YOU KNOW,"it would begin,
"that steel actually floats?" (Sometimes
they'd allow themselves the satisfying in
dulgence of a "! ?!!") Then they'd hit you
with the explanation, usually logical,
once you'd taken the great leap of faith to
suspend your common sense. "Scientists
have proven that steel, once thought to
sink, actually floats in water. Despite the
evidence of the naked eye, laboratory
testing has proven that STEEL ACTUALLY
FLOATS!" (That last all uppercase in case
your faith in science was slipping and in
need of reassurance.)
"The illusion that a steel bardropped in
water will sink is caused by a curious in
teraction between the bar and the water.
The bar, as we have said, actually floats,
but the water FLOATS HARDER!"
This sort of thing was all the rage back

then. Science was roaring along, chang
ing the world, improving our lives, ruin
ing our environment, and making people
more lost and confused than they had
ever been before. After all that jolly good
fun, it sort of ran out of steam.
Once the fifties hit, a sort of depression
hit the scientific community. The depres
sion, I should clear up, was not
economic, nor was there any shortage of
ideas. The scientific community was de
pressed. All the really great discoveries
had been done.
Sure, there was a brief bit of hilarity
with the space shots, but even that didn't
look too good, because we had to scurry

around to catch up after the Russians put
a dog up there. Plus, the scientists—and
their publicists, I should add—were look
ing pretty foolish after all this talk of tele
vision telephones and the ludicrous con
cept of 3-D movies.
Not only wasn't there really anything
great to be done (I know there are scien
tists saying that I'm making a typical
layman's assumption, and, typically, am
mistaken. I'm sorry to get personal, but if
we laymen have been saying that for the
last 20 years, we've been right. Neither
teflon nor Tang have had huge impacts on
my life—except that Tang goes really well
with vodka) but all the things that are
going down can't be written about in the
weeklies.
"DID VOU KNOW that an SNS4LS63 or
SN74LS63 hex current sensing interface
gate with totem pole output translates
low-level input current to low level ouput
voltage and interfaces to PLA's or other
logic elements that source current but do
not sink current?!? Hard to believe, I
know, but laboratory testing has proven
this to be the case. The common delusion
that this is better performed by a coupling
of three or more basal interfacing. .
Obviously this is not a golden age of
scientific dilletantism. As science has
turned away from the shocking and
earth-shaking discoveries it has turned to
honing its discipline and finding more ef
ficacious methods. This prissiness has
been reflected in our public access to sci
ence. Where is there a newspaper that
does not daily feature two stories of sci
entists refuting some public belief? "Salt
not harmful in diet," the headline says.

"The common misconception that salt is
harmful is innaccurate, says Dr. Doug Ac
kerman, a Cal State researcher.
"While it isn't as healthy as, say, a good
cheeseburger, salt is vital to life. This cur
rent vendetta against salt is unfortunate,
but it could be downright harmful if some
impressionable fool were to cut it out of
his or her diet entirely."
One of my main grudges against this
new scientific reactionism is that they
have hit upon a grand old tradition, an
inoffensive and highly vulnerable target,
the grand old man of psuedo
superstitions: the Law of Averages. In a
world dominated by laws that are rules
(hard'n'fast, no exceptions) and by laws
that simply cannot be understood unless
they absolutely have to (Any chemical or
physical principle, except entropy), the
Law of Averages was both easy-going and
simple.
Although I have never seen it written
out—in fact, the only mention of it has
been in sneering derision: "There is no
Law of Averages," statistics texts say
without giving any explanation of what it
might be. Where are we, Soviet Russia?
What harm is done by explaining it, in
having a free and open exchange of
ideas? No, the craven foes of the Law of
Averages would not allow that—l think
we all have a pretty good idea how it goes.
Simply put, "unless there is something
really wrong, weird things don't keep
happening—don't depend on it or it'll
break your heart." The Law is, as I have

'The common misconception that salt is harmful is inaccu
rate' 112 says Dr. Doug Ackerman, a Cal State researcher.
'While it isn't as healthy as, say, a good cheeseburger, salt
is vital to life. This current vendetta against salt is unfortu
nate, but could be downright harmful if some impression
able fool were to cut it out of his or her diet entirely/

said, easygoing. Do whatever you want:
say, roll twelves on two dice fifty times in
a row. The Law of Averages, when pre
sented with this feat, will say "Nice job."
Really calm, no loss of temper, It'll reflect
a while then say, "You know, though, it'll
be about 6.5 X 10 to the 70th power rolls
before you see that again."
And it will. Nobody can tell me that the
Law doesn't hold. You set up a scaffold
ing, and start hanging people. Suddenly
things start going awry. Ropes untwine,
nooses fail to knot, the trap doesn't open.
Ihe mechanism is checked and re

checked, and found perfectly sound.
"Go ahead," says some fool who scoffs at
the Law of Averages. "These chance hap
penings are not connected in any way,
and the likelihood of another such mira
cle is in no way diminished. Go stick your
neck in the noose, you're just as likely to
escape a certain, painful death as ever
before."
No way, Jack.
Vou, scoffer at the Law, can go stick
your neck in the noose. I know that it's
going to be a long time before another
miracle escape happens. I'll wait a while
until the odds even out, thank you. I have
common sense, I keep both feet on the
ground— you, sir, can go dance on the
air.
Do you gamble? Sure you do, even if
just for fun. Say you're playing 21, out of
an eight deck shoe. You've got, say, 15.
Almost no aces have been seen yet, and
you hit five times, and each time you get
an ace, which brings the proportion of
aces in relation to the rest of the cards in
the deck exactly even. (I will let it pass
almost unvoiced that this, too, is another
confirmation of the Law of Averages) Do
you now take another hit on your 20?
After all, the odds of getting an ace are as
good as you could expect, and the fact
that you've just seen a veritable parade of
aces has no effect on the identity of your
next card—unless the law of averages
holds.
Do you hit, unbeliever? If you do—
wham! Big ten—Busto!—l pick up my

chips and leave the table. I can't stand to
play with fools. Ruins my luck.
Still, the Law of Averages is only a
guide. Plus, like I have said, it is very
amenable to being bent. I wouldn't place
all my faith into the Law, or depend
wholly upon it for some important deci
sion. After all, it is a psuedo-superstition,
and everybody knows how—knock
wood!—superstitions can turn on you.
It's been proven.

said, easygoing. Do whatever you want:
say, roll twelves on two dice fifty times in
a row. The Law of Averages, when pre
sented with this feat, will say "Nice job."
Really calm, no loss of temper, It'll reflect
a while then say, "You know, though, it'll
be about 6.5 X 10 to the 70th power rolls
before you see that again."
And it will. Nobody can tell me that the
Law doesn't hold. You set up a scaffold
ing, and start hanging people. Suddenly
things start going awry. Ropes untwine,
nooses fail to knot, the trap doesn't open.
Ihe mechanism is checked and re

"Go ahead," says some fool who scoffs at
the Law of Averages. "These chance hap
penings are not connected in any way,
and the likelihood of another such mira

neck in the noose, you're just as likely to
escape a certain, painful death as ever
before."
No way, Jack.
Vou, scoffer at the Law, can go stick
your neck in the noose. I know that it's
going to be a long time before another
miracle escape happens. I'll wait a while
until the odds even out, thank you. I have
common sense, I keep both feet on the
ground— you, sir, can go dance on the
air.
Do you gamble? Sure you do, even if
just for fun. Say you're playing 21, out of
an eight deck shoe. You've got, say, 15.
Almost no aces have been seen yet, and
you hit five times, and each time you get
an ace, which brings the proportion of
aces in relation to the rest of the cards in
the deck exactly even. (I will let it pass
almost unvoiced that this, too, is another
confirmation of the Law of Averages) Do
you now take another hit on your 20?
After all, the odds of getting an ace are as
good as you could expect, and the fact
that you've just seen a veritable parade of
aces has no effect on the identity of your
next card—unless the law of averages
holds.
Do you hit, unbeliever? If you do—
wham! Big ten—Busto!—l pick up my

chips and leave the table. I can't stand to
play with fools. Ruins my luck.
Still, the Law of Averages is only a
guide. Plus, like I have said, it is very
amenable to being bent. I wouldn't place
all my faith into the Law, or depend
wholly upon it for some important deci
sion. After all, it is a psuedo-superstition,
and everybody knows how—knock
wood!—superstitions can turn on you.
It's been proven.
(Chris Butchko is a senior majoring in
philosophy and history.)
It's good to be iiving in a new age.
These days knowledge and common
sense have entered into a new,
harmonious—although definitely not
cooperative—relationship. A great stride
has been made in the last quarter cen
tury, one that I'm sure will bring great
relief to everyone everywhere.
Simply put, the commonly held view of
the scientific community towards the
perceptive ability of us, common masses,
has changed. No longer is it true that ev
erything we believe is wrong, now it is
just that everything we hold true is use
less, and potentially harmful if taken to
extremes.

The illusion that a steel bar dropped in water will sink is
caused by a curious interaction between the bar and the
water. The bar, as we have said, actually floats, but the
water floats harder!

Those of you who are blessed enough
not to have to go high up into the West
Stack of Green Library for any library
material you may need may not re
member the old days of scientific con
tempt. In my casual (and highly time
consuming) scanning of the old
magazines in said recess of Green I have
come across countless examples of this
sort of enlightened chauvanism.
The popular quasi-literary magazines
of the '20s through the '50s would have
considered an issue a failure unless it ran
at least one article of the "Did You
Know?" or "Scientists Say" stripe. I have
no idea who compiled these things, as no
scientist could have had time to compile
all the ridiculous minutae necessary to fill
page after page with this sort of uncon
nected revelations.
"DID YOU KNOW,"it would begin,
"that steel actually floats?" (Sometimes
they'd allow themselves the satisfying in
dulgence of a "! ?!!") Then they'd hit you
with the explanation, usually logical,
once you'd taken the great leap of faith to
suspend your common sense. "Scientists
have proven that steel, once thought to
sink, actually floats in water. Despite the
evidence of the naked eye, laboratory
testing has proven that STEEL ACTUALLY
FLOATS!" (That last all uppercase in case
your faith in science was slipping and in
need of reassurance.)
"The illusion that a steel bardropped in
water will sink is caused by a curious in
teraction between the bar and the water.
The bar, as we have said, actually floats,
but the water FLOATS HARDER!"
This sort of thing was all the rage back

then. Science was roaring along, chang
ing the world, improving our lives, ruin
ing our environment, and making people
more lost and confused than they had
ever been before. After all that jolly good
fun, it sort of ran out of steam.
Once the fifties hit, a sort of depression
hit the scientific community. The depres
sion, I should clear up, was not
economic, nor was there any shortage of
ideas. The scientific community was de
pressed. All the really great discoveries
had been done.
Sure, there was a brief bit of hilarity
with the space shots, but even that didn't
look too good, because we had to scurry

around to catch up after the Russians put
a dog up there. Plus, the scientists—and
their publicists, I should add—were look

'While it isn't as healthy as, say, a good cheeseburger, salt
is vital to life. This current vendetta against salt is unfortu
nate, but could be downright harmful if some impression
able fool were to cut it out of his or her diet entirely/

said, easygoing. Do whatever you want:
say, roll twelves on two dice fifty times in
a row. The Law of Averages, when pre
sented with this feat, will say "Nice job."
Really calm, no loss of temper, It'll reflect
a while then say, "You know, though, it'll
be about 6.5 X 10 to the 70th power rolls
before you see that again."
And it will. Nobody can tell me that the
Law doesn't hold. You set up a scaffold
ing, and start hanging people. Suddenly
things start going awry. Ropes untwine,
nooses fail to knot, the trap doesn't open.
Ihe mechanism is checked and re

checked, and found perfectly sound.
"Go ahead," says some fool who scoffs at
the Law of Averages. "These chance hap
penings are not connected in any way,
and the likelihood of another such mira
cle is in no way diminished. Go stick your
neck in the noose, you're just as likely to
escape a certain, painful death as ever
before."
No way, Jack.
Vou, scoffer at the Law, can go stick
your neck in the noose. I know that it's
going to be a long time before another
miracle escape happens. I'll wait a while
until the odds even out, thank you. I have
common sense, I keep both feet on the
ground— you, sir, can go dance on the
air.
Do you gamble? Sure you do, even if
just for fun. Say you're playing 21, out of
an eight deck shoe. You've got, say, 15.
Almost no aces have been seen yet, and
you hit five times, and each time you get
an ace, which brings the proportion of
aces in relation to the rest of the cards in
the deck exactly even. (I will let it pass
almost unvoiced that this, too, is another
confirmation of the Law of Averages) Do
you now take another hit on your 20?
After all, the odds of getting an ace are as
good as you could expect, and the fact
that you've just seen a veritable parade of
aces has no effect on the identity of your
next card—unless the law of averages
holds.
Do you hit, unbeliever? If you do—
wham! Big ten—Busto!—l pick up my

chips and leave the table. I can't stand to
play with fools. Ruins my luck.
Still, the Law of Averages is only a
guide. Plus, like I have said, it is very
amenable to being bent. I wouldn't place
all my faith into the Law, or depend
wholly upon it for some important deci
sion. After all, it is a psuedo-superstition,
and everybody knows how—knock
wood!—superstitions can turn on you.
It's been proven.
