## Kids tutor teachers at computer institute 
### DANA NORMAN 
Students are teachers and
teachers are students at the In
stitute on Microcomputers in
Education being held here at
Stanford.
More than 100 elementary and
high school teachers are giving
up their summer vacations to
learn more about computers
from "peer tutors," students
who teach other students at
their schools all the details of
computers.
Justin Florian, a peer tutor
from Jordon junior High School
said that although "most
teachers here do catch on
quickly," they are still "just like
all students. Some do and some
don't."
The teachers have responded
well to the role-reversal.
"Kids are ahead of the
teachers" when it comes to
computers, Debra Brink, one of
the learning teachers, said.

Jacques Pierre-Louis, a physi
cal science teacher from south
ern California, agreed. "Com
puters are the future and a good
teacher will find a kid to help
him learn," he said.
The five-week institute, sup
ported by funds from IBM, Ap
ple, Atari and various educa
tional foundations, teaches
teachers both how to use com
puters and how to integrate
them into their schools.
The integration of computers
into schools has been a problem
due mostly to a lack of money.
In Pierre-Louis's high school
in southern California, funding
has been a stumbling block for
the computer revolution.
Because attendance is low in
his school, federal funds tied to
attendance levels never reach
the school. Therefore, the
school cannot afford to purch
ase computers or train teachers
