# Student challenges Hallmark with computer greeting cards
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
Stanford senior john Halamka
apparently didn't "care enough
to send the very best" when
three friends got married all on
one day.
So instead of resigning him
self to "go with Hallmark and get
something that they'd use as
kindling," Halamka decided to
create something special for his
friends.
What Halamka created may
just be the next big thing in the
computer world: floppy disc
greeting cards.
"I was sitting in front of my
IBM and I had to prepare some
thing for three weddings I had to
go to that day. Each of the wed
dings were with people fairly in
volved in technology and I
thought, 'Do I want to go to
Hallmark and get something that
they'd use for kindling?' So I
thought, 'Why not program
Bach's "Minuet in D" on the
(computer's) tone generator.'
Then I added a personal note (on
the computer screen)," he said.
The end product, Halamka
said, was something both "au

ditorially and visually very
memorable."
So much so, he said, that he's
decided to market his product.
His first 1000 floppy discs will
be available today, he said. Ma
cy's has expressed an interest in
carrying the cards and Halamka
is relying on word-of-mouth and
a mass-mailing of samples to at
tract Silicon Valley card and
computer stores.
With a choice of 10 different
musical selections — including
everything from the theme from
Chariots of Fire to John Denver's
"Sunshine on My Shoulder" —
now available, he says he has no
cards for the rock and roll types.
But he isn't worried.
"This doesn't appeal to the
hard rock type. But let's face it,
the hard rock crowd probably
doesn't send greeting cards.
Hard rock is impossible to prog
ram on a tone generator; Led
Zeppelin doesn't program well,
believe me, I tried."
The discs come inside a paper
card that features an art noveau
design with a woman wrapped in
computer paper spewing from

an IBM Personal Computer.
If Halamka's computer greet
ings are a hit, the success will be
nothing new to the 21-year-old
senior studying medical mic
robiology, political science and
economics. His firm, Collosus
Computers, grossed $100,000
last year with Halamka's
hardware productions. Now as
he branches out into the lucra
tive field of computer software,
he predicts this year he'll gross
half a million dollars more.
But Collosus isn't an end-all
for Halamka. He plans to go on
to medical school after graduat
ing next year and eventually use
the capital that Collosus pro
vides to start his own biomedical
engineering firm, where
Halamka hopes he will be able to
combine his interests in com
puters and medicine.
How does Halamka combine
his studies with running a
$100,000-a-year computer firm?
It isn't easy, he says.
"Sleep is something I haven't
done in a long time. There's just
a balance that needs to be
struck."
