### BRYCE LEE 
Nearly nine months after his
arrest, Stanford student Neil
MacAvoy has pleaded guilty to
two felony charges related to
possession of cocaine and
marijuana.
MacAvoy was arrested last fall
at his Stanford fraternity house
when federal authorities and
police discovered a package of
cocaine and hashish addressed
to him from the People's Repub
lic of China.
Shortly after his arrest
MacAvoy pleaded innocent to
three seperate drug-related
charges, but since then his at
torney has entered a plea bar
gain in which MacAvoy changed

his plea to guilty for possession
for sale of marijuana and
cocaine.
In exchange for the guilty
plea, prosecutors dropped a
felony charge of importation of
marijuana for sale.
MacAvoy now awaits sentenc
ing, scheduled for August 4. He
faces a maximum sentence of
seven years in prison.
The MacAvoy case was one of
the first West Coast cases in
which narcotics were imported
from the People's Republic of
China through the postal sys
tem.
MacAvoy was arrested on Oc
tober 6 when police officers
kicked in his door at Alpha Delta

Phi fraternity. His arrest fol
lowed a two-week investigation
by U.S. Customs officials, the
U.S. Postal Service and Stanford
police.
After Customs agents were
alerted to the small brick-sized
package, postmarked from the
Peoples Republic of China to
MacAvoy, a search warrant was
issued to search MacAvoy's
room. After kicking down the
door when MacAvoy refused to
respond, police officers found a
half-ounce of cocaine and sev
eral bags of marijuana.
Police said they also found
scales and other drug-related
paraphenalia in MacAvoy's
room.
