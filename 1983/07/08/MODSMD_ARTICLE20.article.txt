## Modern rock: politics amid moans and sighs 
### ERIC POSTEL 
Don't you get tired of love
songs? A random check of 10 of
my albums showed that better
than 60 percent of the songs
dealt with love and sex. Not that
I have any problem with eitherof
those two subjects, but some
times it seems as though
songwriters are "beating a dead
horse" so to speak. I feel
strongly about this subject be
cause there are so many other
subjects worthy of discussion in
songs. This is especially true in
rock and roll—a genre of music
historically well known for its
rebellious spirit. One topic that
certainly needs discussing in our
apathetic era is the state of the
world and whatweas individuals
should do about that state. For
tunately, several records re
leased over the past year prove
that not all rock and roll musi
cians are attuned only to the

sounds of love.
Leading the pack are the Red
Rockers. A New Orleans based
band, the Red Rockers recently
released their second album,
Good As Gold, on San Francis
co's own 415 Records. The
album opens with the band's ex
cellent single, "China." Purists
may claim that this song repre
sents a sell-out by a band whose
first album bordered on punk,
but that misses the point. The
song has a wonderful melody,
and any group that can get a
song about China played by re
strictive Top 40 stations in
America has accomplished quite
a lot. The other songs on the
album are consistently high
quality, enjoyable rock and roll.
The Red Rockers have success
fully managed to combine solid
musicianship with some radical
discussions about the state of
America. In "Good as Gold" and

"Dreams Fade Away," the band
discusses the many unreachable
dreams existent in a capitalist
society where people are judged
by their incomes. In the Red
Rockers' vision, such a society is
inevitably doomed, and they
sing about that in "Till it all Falls
Down." The lyrics and the music
fit together well, making this a
thoroughly enjoyable and intel
lectually stimulating record al
bum.
In a piece of fitting irony, the
Red Rockers were picked to
open Bill Graham's newest San
Francisco nightclub, Wolfgang's
on Monday night, July 4. Their
headlining performance proved
that the album is no fluke—this
band is hot. The club was
packed, and the band had the
entire crowd standing and danc
ing during the entire perfor
mance. The band played most of
the songs from the new album as

well as several older songs. The
biggest surprise is that James
Singletary, the lead guitarist,
and Jim Reilly, the drummer, are
even better musicians than the
album would indicate. The live
performance enabled them to
stretch out a bit more, and the
audience was better for it. I only
hope that the Red Rockers be
come more successful so that
more people are stimulated by
the band's lyrics, so that James
Singletary can play his wonder
ful guitar work through bigger
amps, and so bassist Darren Hill
has more room to run around on
stage. In the meantime, we can
all take heed of the Red Rockers,
and do our own bit to "Change
the World Around" instead of
passively sitting back and listen
ing to the same Top 40 love
songs.
Also attempting to combine
good rock and roll with mean

ingful lyrics is The Alarm. Last
month, the four r nembers of the
band stepped off their plane
from Wales directly onto the
large San Francisco Civic Au
ditorium stage as the opening
act for U2 and Romeo Void. Ini
tially, their acoustic guitars and
U2-ish sound merely provoked
cynicism. But as their short 30
minute set wore on, they won
the crowd over as few opening
acts do.
The Alarm sing anthems; sev
eral are featured on their re
cently released EP, The Alarm
(IRS Records). The best is the
opening song, "The Stand,"
with its chorus "Come on down
and meet your maker, Come on
down and make the stand." All
of the songs are very lively and
invariably encourage the lis
tener to sing along. Like U2, The
Alarm is concerned with the
