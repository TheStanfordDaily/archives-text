# Pacific Fresh brings fish to Sunnyvale

Pacific Fresh
1130 N. Mathilda, Sunnyvale
(408) 745-1710
Pacific Fresh is a big, beautiful
new seafood restaurant in Sun
nyvale, across the street from
Lockheed and the U.S.A.F. It's
an obvious attempt to give the
lower Silicon Valley the same
thing Scott's Seafood already
gives Palo Alto — expensive sur
roundings in which several
hundred people can eat
mesquite-grilled fish. The
redwood-and-brass interior, the
bar and the shaded patio are at
tractive and comfortable, the
epitome of California seafood
ambiance. I'd like to tell you
about the fish as well, but I'm
afraid I didn't eat any — I was
asked to review Pacific Fresh's
Sunday brunch.
I hope that a fish restaurant
serving Sunday brunch is some

thing that only happens in the
Bay Area (where there are more
croissants than people). Still, if it
were good Sunday brunch, I
wouldn't mind. Pacific Fresh's
brunch promised great things,
but didn't deliver when the main
course came around.
Fresh offers nine brunch en
trees: four egg dishes ($6.95-
$7.95), three seafood and egg/
cheese combos ($4.95-$6.95),
French toast ($5.50), and steak
and eggs ($8.25).
I sampled both sides of the
brunch spectrum: eggs Floren
tine — an English muffin under
bacon, poached eggs, creamed
spinach and hollandaise sauce
— and a crab and shrimp
omelette. Both were the sort of
thing that live and die by their
hollandaise sauce, and both of
these had expired in the sauce
pan. The hollandaise was corn

pletely tasteless — it seems im
possible, but I suspect someone
may have forgotten to put in
lemon juice. The eggs, etc.,
were well prepared and attrac
tively presented (although the
servings were on the small side),
the creamed spinach was delici
ous, but both entrees were
spoiled by the yellow plastic
they came wrapped in.
The brunch had promise —
the danish was a particularly
good idea — and the problem
with the sauce can be easily
fixed. The service was excellent,
and Pacific Fresh is undoubtedly
one of the most pleasant places
in the area to have a meal (if you
go, pay attention to the care
taken with the decor and the
color scheme). So I'm not about
to write it off. The most frustrat
ing thing is, I'm sure I would
have loved the fish.
