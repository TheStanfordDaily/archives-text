Terman Auditorium
"One starts with the environ-"
ment to arrive at the self," wrote
lean Renoir. "I remain a man of
the 19th century, and I need ob
servation as a point of depar
ture." Having chronicled the
death throes of the European
aristocracy in Grand Illusion, Re
noir set this film, made two years
later, among the new aristocracy
in France: the nouveaux riches,
for whom love is a game with a
fixed set of rules, and to break
them—as the anachronistic,
romantic aviator lurieu (Roland
Toutain) does—is in bad taste
and therefore not to be tolerated.
Renoir's strategy for approaching
his subject triumphs: Rules of the
Came is both a social and a
psychological drama, and one of
the three or four greatest movies
ever made. And it's one that was
almost lost to us forever—the
original negative was destroyed by
the Nazis and the film was
reassembled from bits and pieces
in the '50s. Renoir worked with
Carl Koch on the screenplay (based
loosely on Alfred de Musset's Les
Caprices de Marianne); Claude

Renoir shot it; Coco Chanel
designed the costumes. The
superlative cast includes Marcel
Dalio (he played the Jew,
Rosenthal, in Grand Illusion), Nora
Gregor, Mila Parely, Odette
Talazac, julien Carette, Paulette
Dußost and Renoir himself.
Plays tonight.
Caddyshack
Memorial Auditorium
Bill Murray does a funny take
off on Apocalypse Now, and
Chevy Chase has one briefly
amusing routine about a golfer
whose prowess results from his
inner peace. The rest of the
movie is perhaps best left undis
cussed. Harold Ramis directed
and worked on the script with
Brian Doyle-Murray (Bill Mur
ray's brother, who is in the cast)
and Douglas Kenny (who
produced); Kenny Loggins wrote
the songs. With Rodney
Dangerfield, Michael O'Keefe and
Ted Knight.
Play Sunday evening.
The Crimson Pirate ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Roland Kibbee wrote this ir
resistible spoof of swashbuckler
pictures, and the woefully under
rated director Robert Siodmak
made it. (Isn't it time someone
ran a retrospective of his
movies?) Burt Lancaster and his
one-time circus partner Nick
Cravat (they were acrobats) are a
fabulous Mutt-and-jeff pair of
rapscallions: Lancaster uses the
full-smile blarney, the a 11 -
American salesmanship that dis
tinguishes many of his best per

formances, but in a self
parodying way; and Cravat, who
comes up to his chin, has a funny,
lively face that suggests the Ita
lian comic Toto. He's the most
charming mime since Harpo. The
film is pictorial in the best sense:
Siodmak and the photogrpaher,
Otto Heller, gave it a pleasing
panoramic quality, and Siodmak
filled the sets with colorfully cos
tumed, shrewdly staged crowds.
The chase-fights have the resili
ence, the balance and the loony
inevitability of animated
sequences—and even the music
(by William Allwyn) is witty, send
ing up the scores Erich korngold
wrote for the Errol Flynn adven
tures in the '30s. lames Hayter,
Eva Bartok, Torin Thatcher and
Margot Grahame co-star.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Play It as It Lays
New Varsity, Palo Alto
loan Didion's book about Hol
lywood was awful but
forgivable—the futility of the
lifestyle she described seemed to
have saturated her own life so
you felt you were ploughing
through one of those fascinat
ingly bad grand literary confes
sions. Besides, it showed talent.
Frank Perry's film version, from
an adaptation by Didion and her
husband |ohn Gregory Dunne,
appears to exist for the sole and
highly dubious purpose of illus
trating her words. Perry's clut
tered artsiness can certainly
jangle the nerves. Tuesday Weld
plays the heroine, Maria, but by
this time she was already a pale
version of the vibrant young ac
tress who, four short years ear
lier, had starred opposite An
thony Perkins in Pretty Poison.
Perkins is in this picture, too, and
he saves as much of it as he can.
With Tammy Grimes and Adam
Roarke.
Plays Wednesday with Frances.
Zardoz
Fox, Redwood City
It looks great, all right—a whirl
ing, studded, sensuous science
fiction fantasy directed by )ohn
Boorman and shot by Geoffrey
Unsworth—but the script (by
Boorman) is a howling, 24-carat
atrocity. Charlotte Rampling
plays one of a race of immortals
who possess all knowledge and
long to die; Sean Connery plays
their find, the subject of their
experiments—a mortal. This
movie might have been a camp

classic if anyone had paid atten
tion to it when it came out.
Plays today with A Boy and His
Dog.
North by Northwest ★
Festival, Palo Alto
One of Alfred Hitchcock's last
first-rate thrillers—a gloriously
entertaining, wittily sustained
variation on his old theme of the
innocent trapped intrigue. Cary
Grant, Eva Marie Saint, Jessie
Royce Landis, Martin Landau and
Mount Rushmore are among the
featured players. Ernest Lehman
wrote the script which contains
one of the most famous lines in
any suspense film: "That's
funny—that duster's dustin'
crops where there ain't no
crops." The title, by the way, is
both a reference to Hamlet ("I am
but mad north-northwest. . .")
and a clue to the geography of
the movie.
Plays through Wednesday with
The Man Who Knew Too Much.)

The Man Who Knew Too Much
Festival, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock filmed this
story twice: in 1934 with Leslie
Banks and Edna Best, and again in
1956 with )ames Stewart and
Doris Day. The American version
is longer and livelier; this earlier
British picture is a bit stiff, with
some rigged pictorial effects. But
the ballroom murder and the Al
bert Hall sequence are cleverly
shot, and Banks has a peculiar
charm—robust (he looks a little
like Robert Morley) yet reserved.
Peter Lorre and Pierre Fresnay
show up.
Plays though Wednesday with
North by Northwest.

Being There (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This movie, adapted by )erzy
kosinski from his own novel and
directed by Hal Ashby, is like one
of those British comedies from
the 1950s that expanded on one
particularly clever joke. Peter Sel
lers gives a wonderful perfor
mance as Chance, a mentally de
ficient middle-aged man who has
never learned to read or write
and is taken as a genius by practi
cally everybody. At times the pic
ture seems too reserved — al
most somber — and the hand
some production (shot by Caleb
Deschanel) is a little overblown
and drawn out; but the cast un
derplays skillfully, and the film is
very entertaining. With Shirley
MacLaine, Melvyn Douglas, Jack
Warden, Richard Basehart and
Pave Clennon.
Plays today with The World Ac
cording to Carp.

The Crimson Pirate ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Roland Kibbee wrote this ir
resistible spoof of swashbuckler
pictures, and the woefully under
rated director Robert Siodmak
made it. (Isn't it time someone
ran a retrospective of his
movies?) Burt Lancaster and his
one-time circus partner Nick
Cravat (they were acrobats) are a
fabulous Mutt-and-jeff pair of
rapscallions: Lancaster uses the
full-smile blarney, the a 11 -
American salesmanship that dis
tinguishes many of his best per

formances, but in a self
parodying way; and Cravat, who
comes up to his chin, has a funny,
lively face that suggests the Ita
lian comic Toto. He's the most
charming mime since Harpo. The
film is pictorial in the best sense:
Siodmak and the photogrpaher,
Otto Heller, gave it a pleasing
panoramic quality, and Siodmak
filled the sets with colorfully cos
tumed, shrewdly staged crowds.
The chase-fights have the resili
ence, the balance and the loony
inevitability of animated
sequences—and even the music
(by William Allwyn) is witty, send
ing up the scores Erich korngold
wrote for the Errol Flynn adven
tures in the '30s. lames Hayter,
Eva Bartok, Torin Thatcher and
Margot Grahame co-star.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday

New Varsity, Palo Alto
loan Didion's book about Hol
lywood was awful but
forgivable—the futility of the
lifestyle she described seemed to
have saturated her own life so
you felt you were ploughing
through one of those fascinat
ingly bad grand literary confes
sions. Besides, it showed talent.
Frank Perry's film version, from
an adaptation by Didion and her
husband |ohn Gregory Dunne,
appears to exist for the sole and
highly dubious purpose of illus
trating her words. Perry's clut
tered artsiness can certainly
jangle the nerves. Tuesday Weld
plays the heroine, Maria, but by
this time she was already a pale
version of the vibrant young ac
tress who, four short years ear
lier, had starred opposite An
thony Perkins in Pretty Poison.
Perkins is in this picture, too, and
he saves as much of it as he can.
With Tammy Grimes and Adam
Roarke.
Plays Wednesday with Frances.
Zardoz
Fox, Redwood City
It looks great, all right—a whirl
ing, studded, sensuous science
fiction fantasy directed by )ohn
Boorman and shot by Geoffrey
Unsworth—but the script (by
Boorman) is a howling, 24-carat
atrocity. Charlotte Rampling
plays one of a race of immortals
who possess all knowledge and
long to die; Sean Connery plays
their find, the subject of their
experiments—a mortal. This
movie might have been a camp

classic if anyone had paid atten
tion to it when it came out.
Plays today with A Boy and His
Dog.
North by Northwest ★
Festival, Palo Alto
One of Alfred Hitchcock's last
first-rate thrillers—a gloriously
entertaining, wittily sustained
variation on his old theme of the
innocent trapped intrigue. Cary
Grant, Eva Marie Saint, Jessie
Royce Landis, Martin Landau and
Mount Rushmore are among the
featured players. Ernest Lehman
wrote the script which contains
one of the most famous lines in
any suspense film: "That's
funny—that duster's dustin'
crops where there ain't no
crops." The title, by the way, is
both a reference to Hamlet ("I am
but mad north-northwest. . .")
and a clue to the geography of
the movie.
Plays through Wednesday with
The Man Who Knew Too Much.)

The Man Who Knew Too Much
Festival, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock filmed this
story twice: in 1934 with Leslie
Banks and Edna Best, and again in
1956 with )ames Stewart and
Doris Day. The American version
is longer and livelier; this earlier
British picture is a bit stiff, with
some rigged pictorial effects. But
the ballroom murder and the Al
bert Hall sequence are cleverly
shot, and Banks has a peculiar
charm—robust (he looks a little
like Robert Morley) yet reserved.
Peter Lorre and Pierre Fresnay
show up.
Plays though Wednesday with
North by Northwest.

Being There (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This movie, adapted by )erzy
kosinski from his own novel and
directed by Hal Ashby, is like one
of those British comedies from
the 1950s that expanded on one
particularly clever joke. Peter Sel
lers gives a wonderful perfor
mance as Chance, a mentally de
ficient middle-aged man who has
never learned to read or write
and is taken as a genius by practi
cally everybody. At times the pic
ture seems too reserved — al
most somber — and the hand
some production (shot by Caleb
Deschanel) is a little overblown
and drawn out; but the cast un
derplays skillfully, and the film is
very entertaining. With Shirley
MacLaine, Melvyn Douglas, Jack
Warden, Richard Basehart and
Pave Clennon.
Plays today with The World Ac
cording to Carp.

The Rules of the Game ★
Terman Auditorium
"One starts with the environ-"
ment to arrive at the self," wrote
lean Renoir. "I remain a man of
the 19th century, and I need ob
servation as a point of depar
ture." Having chronicled the
death throes of the European
aristocracy in Grand Illusion, Re
noir set this film, made two years
later, among the new aristocracy
in France: the nouveaux riches,
for whom love is a game with a
fixed set of rules, and to break
them—as the anachronistic,
romantic aviator lurieu (Roland
Toutain) does—is in bad taste
and therefore not to be tolerated.
Renoir's strategy for approaching
his subject triumphs: Rules of the
Came is both a social and a
psychological drama, and one of
the three or four greatest movies
ever made. And it's one that was
almost lost to us forever—the
original negative was destroyed by
the Nazis and the film was
reassembled from bits and pieces
in the '50s. Renoir worked with
Carl Koch on the screenplay (based
loosely on Alfred de Musset's Les
Caprices de Marianne); Claude

Renoir shot it; Coco Chanel
designed the costumes. The
superlative cast includes Marcel
Dalio (he played the Jew,
Rosenthal, in Grand Illusion), Nora
Gregor, Mila Parely, Odette
Talazac, julien Carette, Paulette
Dußost and Renoir himself.
