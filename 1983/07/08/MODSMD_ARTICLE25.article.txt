Iranian hijackers surrender
Paris — The six hijackers of an Iran Air Boeing
747 surrendered to French police at Orly Airport
here yesterday after an overnight ordeal that
ended in the release of the 179 passengers.
The passengers were released after negotiations
between the hijackers and Massoud Rajavi, the
exiled leader of Iran's Peoptes' Mujahideen guer
rilla movement, the chief opposition tothe regime
of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
The hijackers, who said they were Mujahideen
members, had taken control of the plane during a
domestic flight in Iran Wednesday and forced it to
fly to Kuwait, where they released about half the
passengers aboard after refueling and then took
off again for Europe.

The hijackers ordered the plane's pilot to fly to
Orly yesterday morning despite an official ban by
the French government. After landing, they de
manded that Rajavi be brought to the airport for
face-to-face negotiations.
"Open the door, free the passengers," Rajavi
ordered the hijackers. "Remain in the plane and I
will come and speak to you."
Lebanese leader escapes death
Beirut, Lebanon — Lebanese Premier Shafik
Wazzan narrowly escaped assassination yesterday
when explosives loaded into a parked car blew up
at an intersection here only seconds after his
motorcade passed through it.
The incident marked the first time a high
ranking Lebanese government official has been
the target of an attack since President Amin
Gemayel took office last year. However, Western
diplomats in Beirut have been predicting assassi
nation attempts on officials of the Gemayel ad
ministration ever since the signing of the
Lebanese-Israeli troop-withdrawal agreement
May 17.
The agreement has been bitterly opposed by
Syria and by some Lebanese factions.
Wazzan, who was instrumental in arranging for
the evacuation of Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion guerrillas from Beirut last year, was on his way
to the Foreign Ministry when the car bomb deto
nated. The car, a white Honda Civic, exploded
about 30 seconds after Wazzan's motorcade — his
own bullet-proof Mercedes and a two-car police
escort — drove past.
However, police said that only part of the bomb,
which was made of 11 land mines manufactured in
several different countries, actually exploded.
"We estimate that only five kilos (11 pounds) of
explosives went off," a Beirut police official said.
Abscam defendants go to jail
The first batch of major Abscam defendants,
including three former congressmen, reported to
federal prisons yesterday, but a fourth ex
congressman gained a delay in his sentence with a
new appeal.
Among those who began serving prison terms,

more than three years after the first indictments in
the case, were former Reps. Raymond Lederer
(D-Pa.), Michael "Ozzie" Myers (D-Pa.) and Frank
Thompson Jr. (D-N.J.).
"Abscam is a disgrace to the justice system of
this country," said Myers just before he entered
the federal facility at Allenwood, Pa. Other defen
dants reported to prisons in Lexington, Ky., and
Danbury, Conn.
Former Rep. John Murphy (D-N.Y.), sentenced
to three years in prison, remained free after filinga
request to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Mar
shall for a stay pending an appeal for a new trial.
Officials at the U.S. marshal's office in Brooklyn,
N.Y., which processed the surrenders, said yes
terday they granted Murphy an "indefinite stay"
from reporting to Danbury pending Marshall's de
cision on granting a stay.
The surrenders brought to eight the number of
Abscam defendants behind bars. The previous
two werea former Immigration and Naturalization
Service employee and his codefendant.
The 11 others convicted of Abscam bribery
related offenses — including Murphy, two other
former congressmen and former Sen. Harrison
Williams Jr. (D-N.J.) — are free pending appeals or
due to surrender later this month.

domestic flight in Iran Wednesday and forced it to
fly to Kuwait, where they released about half the
passengers aboard after refueling and then took
off again for Europe.

The hijackers ordered the plane's pilot to fly to
Orly yesterday morning despite an official ban by
the French government. After landing, they de
manded that Rajavi be brought to the airport for
face-to-face negotiations.
"Open the door, free the passengers," Rajavi
ordered the hijackers. "Remain in the plane and I
will come and speak to you."
Lebanese leader escapes death
Beirut, Lebanon — Lebanese Premier Shafik
Wazzan narrowly escaped assassination yesterday
when explosives loaded into a parked car blew up
at an intersection here only seconds after his
motorcade passed through it.
The incident marked the first time a high
ranking Lebanese government official has been
the target of an attack since President Amin
Gemayel took office last year. However, Western
diplomats in Beirut have been predicting assassi
nation attempts on officials of the Gemayel ad
ministration ever since the signing of the
Lebanese-Israeli troop-withdrawal agreement
May 17.
The agreement has been bitterly opposed by
Syria and by some Lebanese factions.
Wazzan, who was instrumental in arranging for
the evacuation of Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion guerrillas from Beirut last year, was on his way
to the Foreign Ministry when the car bomb deto
nated. The car, a white Honda Civic, exploded
about 30 seconds after Wazzan's motorcade — his
own bullet-proof Mercedes and a two-car police
escort — drove past.
However, police said that only part of the bomb,
which was made of 11 land mines manufactured in
several different countries, actually exploded.
"We estimate that only five kilos (11 pounds) of
explosives went off," a Beirut police official said.
Abscam defendants go to jail
The first batch of major Abscam defendants,
including three former congressmen, reported to
federal prisons yesterday, but a fourth ex
congressman gained a delay in his sentence with a
new appeal.
Among those who began serving prison terms,

more than three years after the first indictments in
the case, were former Reps. Raymond Lederer
(D-Pa.), Michael "Ozzie" Myers (D-Pa.) and Frank
Thompson Jr. (D-N.J.).
"Abscam is a disgrace to the justice system of
this country," said Myers just before he entered
the federal facility at Allenwood, Pa. Other defen
dants reported to prisons in Lexington, Ky., and
Danbury, Conn.
Former Rep. John Murphy (D-N.Y.), sentenced
to three years in prison, remained free after filinga
request to Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Mar
shall for a stay pending an appeal for a new trial.
Officials at the U.S. marshal's office in Brooklyn,
N.Y., which processed the surrenders, said yes
terday they granted Murphy an "indefinite stay"
from reporting to Danbury pending Marshall's de
cision on granting a stay.
The surrenders brought to eight the number of
Abscam defendants behind bars. The previous
two werea former Immigration and Naturalization
Service employee and his codefendant.
The 11 others convicted of Abscam bribery
related offenses — including Murphy, two other
former congressmen and former Sen. Harrison
Williams Jr. (D-N.J.) — are free pending appeals or
due to surrender later this month.
