# Carter aide calls for Hoover file inquiry
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED TIM GRIEVE 
An aide to former President
Jimmy Carter suggested yester
day that the FBI seal off papers at
the Hoover Institution that
could contain information on
the purloined Carter campaign
papers.
The suggestion stemmed from
the controversy surrounding a
Carter briefing book that Reagan
staffers used to prepare the pres
ident for his debate with Carter.
Former Deputy Domestic Pol
icy Advisor David Rubenstein
said that since Reagan's cam
paign papers are housed at
Hoover, it would not be surpris
ing to find information on the
pilfered Carter papers there.
"There are some campaign
materials at the Hoover Institu
tion and I am hopeful that those
would be looked at. I'm sure
they're (the FBI) going to get to
it, but because there's so much
material there it could be de
stroyed, they'd better get to it
soon," Rubenstein said from his
law office in Washington D.C.
A spokesperson for the FBI in
Washington would say only that
"the investigation is continuing"
into the origin of Carter briefing
materials.
Frank Daniel, spokesman for
the FBI in San Francisco, said
that Rubenstein's suggestions
"were news to me." He said he
did not know if the FBI was act
ing or would act on the sugges
tion.
"I suppose a former Carter
aide can suggest anything he
wants," he said.
Although officials at the
Hoover Institution are looking
into the Reagan papers housed
there, they said that they have

heard nothing about an FBI in
vestigation there.
Charles Palm, deputy archivist
at Hoover, said that "there has
been no discussion about seal
ing off anything." However,
Palm did say that a "search for
documents (relating to the Car
ter case) is proceeding."
Molly Tuthill, a Hoover re
searcher in charge of Reagan's
papers, said she began looking
over Reagan's campaign papers
shortly after she received calls
from the press.
But Tuthill would not disclose
whether any incriminating pap
ers have been uncovered or
which governmental agencies
she has contacted. She said if
she discovers any unusual pap
ers, she will turn them over to
the lustice Department.
The sudden interest in the
president's campaign papers
began with Laurence Barrett's
recently published book,
Gambling With History.
Reagan's budget director David
Stockman has admitted to telling
the Time magazine correspon
dent that he used the briefing
book to prepare Reagan for the
debates.
Reagan himself denies any
knowledge of the pilfered pap
ers. "No one on our side ever
mentioned to me anything of
this kind," he said last week. Re
porters asked Reagan last week
in southern California if he
would apologize to Carter. "I
haven't done anything to
apologize for," he replied.
David Gergen, White House
communications director, first
denied that he had ever seen
material from the Carter camp.
But later last week, on the
suggestion of a former secret
ary, Gergen checked a file in his
office and found about 1000
pages of documents on foreign

policy and national security from
the Carter administration.
Rubenstein points to Cergen's
findings at the White House as a
reason to search Reagan's
Hoover papers. "I would ask
that they (FBI) look at what's
there. After all, look what they
found in their own files in the

White House," he said.
The Hoover Institution houses
Reagan's papers from his pre
gubernatorial, gubernatorial, in
terim, campaign and transition
years. The University is currently
examining the possibility of
housing Reagan's presidential
papers here as well.
