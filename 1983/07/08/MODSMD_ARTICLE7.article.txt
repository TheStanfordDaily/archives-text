## Fed to impose new tight money policy 
### 
Washington â€” Fearing the
quick pace of economic recov
ery could produce inflation by
next year, the Federal Reserve
Board will soon move to tighten
credit, according to a report
published today.
The Washington Post, quoting
unnamed Federal Reserve
sources, said the board will
likely raise the Fed's discount
rate from its current level of 8.4
percent to 9 percent.
The discount rate is what the
Fed charges member banks to
borrow from it. It heavily influ
ences other interest rates, which
have been rising recently. Rates
were 9.2 percent on six-month

Treasury bills auctioned Tues
day, up from 9.14 percent the
week before and the highest
since 10.125 percent last August.
Several Wall Street analysts
have said they expect the Fed to
increase the discount rate.
Other tools at the Fed's dis
posal include changes in the
level of funds member banks are
required to keep on deposit at
Federal Reserve banks, and
purchases and sales of govern
ment bonds in the open market.
The Fed's Open Market
Committee, which instructs the
Fed traders in the bond market,
has a scheduled meeting next
Tuesday and Wednesday.
