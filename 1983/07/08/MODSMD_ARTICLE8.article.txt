# Kohl hints arms deadlock break

Moscow — West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl hinted Wednesday that he had heard
some "new" ideas from Soviet President Yuri
Andropov on ways to break the deadlock at
Soviet-American negotiations on limiting
medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
"My opinion is that there is still a chance to
get somewhere in Geneva," Kohl told a news
conference marking the end of three days of
summit meetings here. "The Soviet leadership
made clear that it does not exclude the possibil
ity of progress being made. This of course, is a
more reserved attitude," he added.
The chancellor did not disclose what the
"new" points were that the Soviets brought
forward during private talks but said, "those
things that seem to us to be new will be relayed
promptly to our allies."
The chancellor's guarded remarks followed
harsh public exchanges with Andropov and
Premier Nikolai Tikhonov that indicated no sign
of flexibility by East or West on the scheduled
deploymentof Pershing II and cruisemissiles in
Western Europe starting in December.
Ignoring attempts to intimidate him, Kohl
bluntly told his hosts that the new missiles will
be deployed unless they make concessions in
Geneva.
During his press conference, Kohl frankly re
lated his discussions with Andropov and other

Soviet leaders. Kohl's remarks made it clear that
his country should not be expected to shrink
from its NATO commitments or its reinvigo
rated friendship with the United States.
Kohl said he rejected Andropov's broad hint
that Moscow would put new nuclear missiles in
East Germany to counter the American de
ployment and that there " would be a fence of
missiles along the inter-German border."
Kohl also appeared unperturbed when Ad
ropov on Monday cancelled a private meeting
with Kohl citing health reasons. Kohl readily
accepted the explanation, but some Soviet offi
cials seemed just as eager to fan rumors of a
diplomatic snub. They indicated that Kohl's
remarks on the eve of his departure for Mos
cow that blamed Soviet intransigence for lack
of progress in arms control talks were highly
impolite and warranted a mild reprimand.
Kohl's press conference in itself was an ex
traordinary event because he directly addres
sed several subjects that his predecessors had
avoided for fear of offending the Russians.
Baited by Soviet journalists who asked about
"revanchist nationalistic trends" in West Ger
many, Kohl did not retreat into the shadows of
German guilt over the Nazi era but spoke as a
leader of a new generation that feels it was too
young to bear responsibility for the horrors of
World War 11.
