# Shultz fails to get Syrian withdrawal

### 
Jerusalem â€”Secretary of
State George Shultz failed
Wednesday to persuade Syria
to consider withdrawing its
troops from Lebanon. But he
and President Hafez Assad
agreed to set up a working
group to continue discus
sions between their govern
ments.
"It remains to be seen what
happens next, but there is ac
tivity in the diplomacy," said
Shultz.
He said he argued for hours
with Assad and Foreign
Minister Abdul-Halim Khad
dam about the Israeli-
Lebanese troop withdrawal
accord, but "we had no ag
reement about that agree
ment at all."
He told reporters on the
flight from Damascus to
Jerusalem that the discussion
was "not rancorous," but
they flatly disagreed. He said
Syria's main objection was
that the agreement poses a
danger to Lebanon's

sovereignty.
"We, on the other hand,
think Lebanon has emerged
with its sovereignty intact,"
said Shultz.
In Damascus, the Syrian
goverment said Assad told
Shultz Syria's rejection of the
Israeli-Lebanese agreement
is "final and irrevocable." Is
rael refuses to withdraw
completely from Lebanon
until the Syrians do, and
Shultz said, "I don't see any
prospect of any immediate,
mutual withdrawal as one
might have hoped for."
But he said the United
States would not give up its
goal of all Syrian, Israeli and
Palestinian forces leaving
Lebanon to enable the
Lebanese government to re
gain control of its territory.
Shultz said as a result of his
meeting with Assad, a U.S.-
Syrian working group would
be set up to maintain a
dialogue.
