### BRYCE LEE 
The Palo Alto City Council cer
tified unanimously last night the
Environmental Impact Report
(EIR) for Stanford West, an
1100-unit development planned
by the University to house fa
culty, staff and others employed
on Stanford lands.
Approval of the EIR marks the
passage of a major milestone be
fore the University goes back to
the city Planning Commission
and the Architectural Review
Board with specific project
plans. The council stipulated last
night that final approval of all
phases of the development be
brought before it.
Prior to the council's certifica
tion of the report, several mitiga
tions were added, including a
provision for recreational
facilities, limitations on con
struction near Willow Road, au
tomobile access to the project,
and specific requirements re
garding purchasing rights.
While council member Fred
Eyerly said he considered the
development to be a "good pro
ject" and "a benefit to both the
city and Stanford," he added
that he felt the mitigations of
fered by the University were
minimal.

Aside from the EI R , an
amendment was also made
ensure that below market rate
(BMR) housing would be availa
hie to families with incomes that
fall within 80 to 120 percent of
the county median income. The
University has a commitment to
provide 180 units of BMR hous
ing under this city program. Ac
cording to council member Gary
Fazzino, affordable housing
should be the "primary goal" of
the council.
Council member Emily Re
nzel, who stressed the impor
tance of the project's esthetic
appeal, said open space near
San Francisquito Creek should
be maintained if the University
wants to "tempt new faculty
from their halt-acre lots in Con
necticut."
Following ratification of the
EIR, the council passed an
amendment stating that the de
velopment's design is in
adequate and should be im
proved. At one point, Fazzino
remarked off-handedly, "the ar
chitect (of Stanford West)
should be fired."
Fazzino later said "the project
must be designed well" because
of its immense size.
