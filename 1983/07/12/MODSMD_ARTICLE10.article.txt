### RICHARD ESQUIBEL 
"The most important issue I
am working on is the reduction
of danger of nuclear war," Rep.
Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) said
at an East Palo Alto town meeting
Saturday.
Addressing approximately 60
people, Lantos said, "My
number one priority in my
foreign policy is the balance and
reduction of nuclear weapons.
All other issues fade into
mediocrity."
Lantos said he and an over
whelming numberof Democrats
voted against the MX missile be
cause it "represents an un
needed, unnecessary, enorm
ously expensive weapons sys
tem."
In one of several attacks on
the Reagan administration, Lan
tos expressed concern that the
Reagan Supreme Court ap
pointments will remain "long
after this administration is
gone."
Lantos called Supreme Court

with Lantos when he said that
many women who were initially

pointed to the Supreme Court

conservative views.
In addition Lantos said that he
is "deeply concerned that Con

unconstitutional.
Turning to economic issues,
Lantos said 10 percent of our
population is currently un

that more than 18 million people
"are outside the mainstream of
the American economy." He
said his number one domestic
priority is to restore economic
stability.

Lantos said he finds it "uncon

the nation's schools and com

"During the last 15 years, in
industry after industry, we have

Lantos said. "The core problem

said that as a member of Con

Lantos said he believes "it is
