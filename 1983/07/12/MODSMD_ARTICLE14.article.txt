# Sierra trek saga continues as bears and ice threaten

### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
This is the second installment
of a series which began in last
luesday's Daily. As this part be
gins, the threesome have just
pitched camp after an arduous
hike which they could have av
oided by taking a new access
road to the park. Tempers, after
the long and futile hike, are
short.
It's hard to say who first had
the idea to poison the food and
thus do away with the rest of the
party, but it's safe to say that we
all did, eventually, consider the
idea, and, if I saw what I thought
I saw that third night, perhaps
someone even began im
plementation.
We spent the first night
peaceably enough, and we even
had the unexpected joy of fresh
hamburger for dinner, which
Tim had secretly packed in. Rob
and I were greatly pleased by
this, and by degrees the mood of
the camp thawed to open hostil
ity, and by next morning hit
mere open dissension. This
polarization was not helped by
the sleeping arrangements,
which divided three people
among two tents.
Curiously, it seemed to be
mere chance that I ended up
alone in the one-man tent every
night of the trip. (Of course, this
was obviously done so they
could scheme against my life.)
This suited us very well, as post
trip discussion revealed the fact
that Rob and Tim were sure that
any bear would go for the lone
— and therefore weaker — prey,
while I placed my faith in the be
lief that a ton or so of enraged,
half-starved grizzly would not be
in any way deterred by the pros
pect of facing two totally
panicked college students and
would go for the tent with more
meat.
There were no grizzly attacks
that trip, I am thankful to say, as
an old Navajo Indian trick of
cowering awake all night in my
tent listening for the slightest
sound kept them away quite
nicely. Alive, then, we awoke
the next morning, grimy and
bleary eyed, but perversely
eager for the day's voyage.
Our first serious, trip-ending
challenge hit us about five mi
nutes after we set out. Hiking as
we did early in the season, we
were faced with the normal

spring thaw and runoff. Last year
was an unusually precipitous
time, and the runoff was unusu
ally strong. So strong, in fact,
that the outdated and fiendishly
vague maps we had staked our
lives upon inidicated a trickle of
water to be crossed where in fact
there was a rather quaint torrent
in the act of washing out the
trail.
This incredibly cold water (I
had that morning in an attempt
to "wash my hair" stuck my head
in that water, resulting in a wash
ing trauma that had to be dealt
with immediately upon my re
turn to civilization) seemed to
signal the end of our trip, and a
return to the feather-soft beds
and properly cooked food of
civilization. We looked up and
down the river, and for 50 feet in
either direction we could see no
place to cross. However, just
when things were looking
brightest, I had an idea.
There were these rocks in the
middle of the river, fairly
medium-sized boulders, and it
was not an impossible jump
either to them from the bank,
nor to the far bank from that
point. Having the shortest stride
and thus the least chance of
either making or surviving the
jump, I chose to try the gap.
Being natively brilliant, I put
down my heavy walking stick,
and took a trotting leap at the
rock. Astoundingly, I made it,
slamming against the rock on all
fours, clutching its algae
smeared surface like a lover of
algae-smeared surfaces.
Of course, being mentally de
ficient, I had neglected to cast
off my 50-pound pack when I
dropped my stick. The pack,
being a much more ambitious
creature than \ — and perhaps
being ashamed at having to be
carried all this way; who can tell?
— chose to try to make the
whole jump at once, and, of
course, neglected to cast me off
first. When the momentum of
the pack hit I spun crazily over
the crown of the rock, and tee
tered precariously close to the
water.
The godsend of an adrenaline
burst saved me there (whoever
constructed the human body did
a really great thing with those
adrenal glands, only they should
be accessible when you can
enjoy them more, rather than

only when hanging by your toes
from an algae-coated rock) and I
clamhorod up and off. "Nothing
to it," I shouted. "Give it a
whirl!" Rob and Tim, being less
than a third the fool I am, total,
hurled their packs across to me,
thereby expediting their passage
and snapping several of my les
ser bones.
The day's trudging began in
earnest. We hiked through the
sandy plain, then up a rather
barren mountain, then through
a forested valley. I remember
thinking, "Say, you certainly can
travel far just by walking! Look at
that scenery unwind! What a
lovely place!" Which I admit is
not very profound, but put a

pack on you, trudge for two
days, and we'll see how Prous
tian you arp aftprwards.
We lunched again, peanut
butter from tubes and lemonade
made from wet river bacteria,
and concluded another day of
hiking and sightseeing with no
great problem. The best, as they
say, was yet to come.
That night we camped out
near a marshy bog, so as to bet
ter test out the advertising
claims of Cutter's insect repel
lant. (I should add, for those of
you who have never been and
are thinking of going, the most
vital piece of equipment you can
take on a camping trip is a five
or 10-gallon drum of Cutter's.

Insect repellant is the only thing
that will keep you alive in the
woods, and if you run out of
food, you can splash some on
one of the mosquitoes and feed
a family of five.)
Rob had, at this camp, a mysti
cal experience. Last night, he
claimed, Daniel Boone had
come to him in a dream, saying
that he was to receive an inheri
tance at the next campsight. Rob
spent the greater part of the next
day in a trance, something so
common we wouldn't have rec
ognized but for the fact he kept
repeating the words "forked
sticks," and although it sounded
familiar enough to our vocabul
