# Sierra trek saga continues as bears and ice threaten
## 
### CHRIS BUTCHKO 
This is the second installment
of a series which began in last
luesday's Daily. As this part be
gins, the threesome have just
pitched camp after an arduous
hike which they could have av
oided by taking a new access
road to the park. Tempers, after
the long and futile hike, are
short.
It's hard to say who first had
the idea to poison the food and
thus do away with the rest of the
party, but it's safe to say that we
all did, eventually, consider the
idea, and, if I saw what I thought
I saw that third night, perhaps
someone even began im
plementation.
We spent the first night
peaceably enough, and we even
had the unexpected joy of fresh
hamburger for dinner, which
Tim had secretly packed in. Rob
and I were greatly pleased by
this, and by degrees the mood of
the camp thawed to open hostil
ity, and by next morning hit
mere open dissension. This
polarization was not helped by
the sleeping arrangements,
which divided three people
among two tents.
Curiously, it seemed to be
mere chance that I ended up
alone in the one-man tent every
night of the trip. (Of course, this
was obviously done so they
could scheme against my life.)
This suited us very well, as post
trip discussion revealed the fact
that Rob and Tim were sure that
any bear would go for the lone
— and therefore weaker — prey,
while I placed my faith in the be
lief that a ton or so of enraged,
half-starved grizzly would not be
in any way deterred by the pros
pect of facing two totally
panicked college students and
would go for the tent with more
meat.
There were no grizzly attacks
that trip, I am thankful to say, as
an old Navajo Indian trick of
cowering awake all night in my
tent listening for the slightest
sound kept them away quite
nicely. Alive, then, we awoke
the next morning, grimy and
bleary eyed, but perversely
eager for the day's voyage.
Our first serious, trip-ending
challenge hit us about five mi
nutes after we set out. Hiking as
we did early in the season, we
were faced with the normal

spring thaw and runoff. Last year
was an unusually precipitous
time, and the runoff was unusu
ally strong. So strong, in fact,
that the outdated and fiendishly
vague maps we had staked our
lives upon inidicated a trickle of
water to be crossed where in fact
there was a rather quaint torrent
in the act of washing out the
trail.
This incredibly cold water (I
had that morning in an attempt
to "wash my hair" stuck my head
in that water, resulting in a wash
ing trauma that had to be dealt
with immediately upon my re
turn to civilization) seemed to
signal the end of our trip, and a
return to the feather-soft beds
and properly cooked food of
civilization. We looked up and
down the river, and for 50 feet in
either direction we could see no
place to cross. However, just
when things were looking
brightest, I had an idea.
There were these rocks in the
middle of the river, fairly
medium-sized boulders, and it
was not an impossible jump
either to them from the bank,
nor to the far bank from that
point. Having the shortest stride
and thus the least chance of
either making or surviving the
jump, I chose to try the gap.
Being natively brilliant, I put
down my heavy walking stick,
and took a trotting leap at the
rock. Astoundingly, I made it,
slamming against the rock on all
fours, clutching its algae
smeared surface like a lover of
algae-smeared surfaces.
Of course, being mentally de
ficient, I had neglected to cast
off my 50-pound pack when I
dropped my stick. The pack,
being a much more ambitious
creature than \ — and perhaps
being ashamed at having to be
carried all this way; who can tell?
— chose to try to make the
whole jump at once, and, of
course, neglected to cast me off
first. When the momentum of
the pack hit I spun crazily over
the crown of the rock, and tee
tered precariously close to the
water.
The godsend of an adrenaline
burst saved me there (whoever
constructed the human body did
a really great thing with those
adrenal glands, only they should
be accessible when you can
enjoy them more, rather than

only when hanging by your toes
from an algae-coated rock) and I
clamhorod up and off. "Nothing
to it," I shouted. "Give it a
whirl!" Rob and Tim, being less
than a third the fool I am, total,
hurled their packs across to me,
thereby expediting their passage
and snapping several of my les
ser bones.
The day's trudging began in
earnest. We hiked through the
sandy plain, then up a rather
barren mountain, then through
a forested valley. I remember
thinking, "Say, you certainly can
travel far just by walking! Look at
that scenery unwind! What a
lovely place!" Which I admit is
not very profound, but put a

pack on you, trudge for two
days, and we'll see how Prous
tian you arp aftprwards.
We lunched again, peanut
butter from tubes and lemonade
made from wet river bacteria,
and concluded another day of
hiking and sightseeing with no
great problem. The best, as they
say, was yet to come.
That night we camped out
near a marshy bog, so as to bet
ter test out the advertising
claims of Cutter's insect repel
lant. (I should add, for those of
you who have never been and
are thinking of going, the most
vital piece of equipment you can
take on a camping trip is a five
or 10-gallon drum of Cutter's.

Insect repellant is the only thing
that will keep you alive in the
woods, and if you run out of
food, you can splash some on
one of the mosquitoes and feed
a family of five.)
Rob had, at this camp, a mysti
cal experience. Last night, he
claimed, Daniel Boone had
come to him in a dream, saying
that he was to receive an inheri
tance at the next campsight. Rob
spent the greater part of the next
day in a trance, something so
common we wouldn't have rec
ognized but for the fact he kept
repeating the words "forked
sticks," and although it sounded
familiar enough to our vocabul

ary, it was distinct enough to
notice.
Sure enough, after we
camped, he walked into the
woods only to return with a pair
of matched forked sticks, per
fect for creating a spit across the
fire to support our pots for din
ner. Rob went, frankly, berserk
from that point on, insisting he
was the son of the woods and
the "true heir to the forest," and
insisted on hiking naked the rest
of the way, but for a leather jer
kin, which, thankfully, he had
happened to have with him. The
excitement passed, we had an
execrable dinner and went to
sleep.
The next day's hike was like
the one previous, but added an
interesting touch of something
Tim called a "downhill slope,"
which I couldn't handle, falling
several times over the surface of
the planet, unaccustomed as I
was to this "downhill." Lunch
was, as ever, uninspired, but
dinner was exceptional.
For the first time in recorded
history, three men, starving
from little food and hard exer
tion, refused dinner. The dinner
was a freeze-dried lump of chic
ken and rice, which refused to
cook, merely sopping up all the
water in the pot and becoming
surlierand surlier. Ourtempers,
understandably, were short , and
when our badly needed dinner
chose to attain sentience instead
of edibility, we were a little curt.
Needless to say, some words
were exchanged, feelings were
hurt, and the chicken and rice
stalked off in a huff.
That night we lay about that
campsight by the dying fire and
indulged in some of that soul
stirring camaraderie.
"The stars are really bright out
here." "Yup. Really bright."
"Yup. See that?" "No. Shooting
star?" "Yup. Big one." "Hmm,
Stars are really bright."
The next day we were up and

about it again, and ran into our
first "other person." He told us
that the trail we had originally
planned to take was clogged
with ice, and we could "mebbe"
get by with an ice axe, some
rope, and, presumably, a team
of Marines with flamethrowers.
We reached summit that day,
slogging through ice and snow
in a strangely surreal trek. It
wasn't cold, but the ice wasn't
melting and the snow didn't
seem to mind. After we posed at
the summit for some tourist

snapshots, we faced the trail
again, happy, confident that the
worst was over, and heading for
a big fall.
We left the sun-drenched side
of the mountain to lose sight of
the trail in a seeminly endless
expanse of snow. Here things
got a little icy. Far down and far
left, we saw the dim vestiges of a
trail. We were going to have to
cross this sheet of ice to go on. I
looked out at that floe, then
down at my sneakers, then over
at my companions, seasoned
mountain men that they were.

Simply put, we were doomed.
Once again, wishing to be the
first to die so that I wouldn't
have to feel the crushing sense
of loss that befalls those left be
hind without food or shelter, I
set off first. Rapidly improvising
a Perfect Act of Contrition, I
scuttled my way across. Three
fourths of the way over, I turned
to spur my fellows on. They,
naturally letting me take the
brunt of any avalance or hidden
cavern, had held back. "Come
on," I shouted. "This is "

Thereupon I began my sleighride
I don't know exactly what the
best thing to do is when you are
hurtling down towards your
death on a sheet of ice, but
going by results, I would say
panicking is definitely viable.
Flailing about madly, I jammed
my stick, my hand, and the
frame of my backpack into the
snow and stopped. It was a true
struggle to look nonchalant as I
regained my feet.
Having no choice, Tim and

Rob followed, and Tim pro
ceeded to do an even more im
pressive slide, winning him the
respect and admiration of his fel
lows. The rest of the hike, while
scenically gorgeous, failed to
match the thrilis of that morn
ing. That night we made it back
to the spot we had camped at the
first night.
As if to signal the end of hard
ship, we had spaghetti for din
ner that night, the first meal
since the first day that I could
eat. I set about it ravenously, and

Rob and Tim, out of either kind
ness for my starvation or fear of
losing a limb, did not interfere.
(The package indicated that a
longer boiling time was needed
at higher elevations, ludging by
the length of cooking time and
the subsequent ropy condition
of the spaghetti, water at our
elevation starts boiling shortly
after being putted from the
river.)
The next day was a simple re
verse of our first day, a long
downhill trek. We finished it be

fore lunch, and got into Rob's
truck to drive to the nearest out
post of civilization. Our trip was
over, but despite the fact I felt
we had retreated from Moscow
and my companions looked as
though they had been having an
extended vacation at Maze
prison, I was sorry it was over.
As I took my first shower in a
week back at Tim's house ...
Lafayette, I reflected upon the
events of the trip: the time Rob
slipped off a log bridge over a
river and nearly lost his shoes,

Tim finding a horse's skull and
carrying it 10 miles back to the
truck and the time I sat under the
shade of a tree by a bend of the
kern River and just stopped
thinking entirely to just fee/, i
don't think I can remember a
time that seemed more alive, re
laxed or fun. After all the pains
and the bad food and the bicker
ing, there were still the funny
times, the talk and the thrill of
following a path that showed me
so many different things and
never disappointed me despite
the fact it promised so much.

This is the second installment
of a series which began in last
luesday's Daily. As this part be

Rob had, at this camp, a mysti
cal experience. Last night, he
claimed, Daniel Boone had
come to him in a dream, saying
that he was to receive an inheri
tance at the next campsight. Rob
spent the greater part of the next
day in a trance, something so
common we wouldn't have rec
ognized but for the fact he kept
repeating the words "forked
sticks," and although it sounded
familiar enough to our vocabul

ary, it was distinct enough to
notice.
Sure enough, after we
camped, he walked into the
woods only to return with a pair
of matched forked sticks, per
fect for creating a spit across the
fire to support our pots for din
ner. Rob went, frankly, berserk
from that point on, insisting he
was the son of the woods and
the "true heir to the forest," and
insisted on hiking naked the rest
of the way, but for a leather jer
kin, which, thankfully, he had
happened to have with him. The
excitement passed, we had an
execrable dinner and went to
sleep.
The next day's hike was like
the one previous, but added an
interesting touch of something
Tim called a "downhill slope,"
which I couldn't handle, falling
several times over the surface of
the planet, unaccustomed as I
was to this "downhill." Lunch
was, as ever, uninspired, but
dinner was exceptional.
For the first time in recorded
history, three men, starving
from little food and hard exer
tion, refused dinner. The dinner
was a freeze-dried lump of chic
ken and rice, which refused to
cook, merely sopping up all the
water in the pot and becoming
surlierand surlier. Ourtempers,
understandably, were short , and
when our badly needed dinner
chose to attain sentience instead
of edibility, we were a little curt.
Needless to say, some words
were exchanged, feelings were
hurt, and the chicken and rice
stalked off in a huff.
That night we lay about that
campsight by the dying fire and
indulged in some of that soul
stirring camaraderie.
"The stars are really bright out
here." "Yup. Really bright."
"Yup. See that?" "No. Shooting
star?" "Yup. Big one." "Hmm,
Stars are really bright."
The next day we were up and

about it again, and ran into our
first "other person." He told us
that the trail we had originally
planned to take was clogged
with ice, and we could "mebbe"
get by with an ice axe, some
rope, and, presumably, a team
of Marines with flamethrowers.
We reached summit that day,
slogging through ice and snow
in a strangely surreal trek. It
wasn't cold, but the ice wasn't
melting and the snow didn't
seem to mind. After we posed at
the summit for some tourist

snapshots, we faced the trail
again, happy, confident that the
worst was over, and heading for
a big fall.
We left the sun-drenched side
of the mountain to lose sight of
the trail in a seeminly endless
expanse of snow. Here things
got a little icy. Far down and far
left, we saw the dim vestiges of a
trail. We were going to have to
cross this sheet of ice to go on. I
looked out at that floe, then
down at my sneakers, then over
at my companions, seasoned
mountain men that they were.

Simply put, we were doomed.
Once again, wishing to be the
first to die so that I wouldn't
have to feel the crushing sense
of loss that befalls those left be
hind without food or shelter, I
set off first. Rapidly improvising
a Perfect Act of Contrition, I
scuttled my way across. Three
fourths of the way over, I turned
to spur my fellows on. They,
naturally letting me take the
brunt of any avalance or hidden
cavern, had held back. "Come
on," I shouted. "This is "

Thereupon I began my sleighride
I don't know exactly what the
best thing to do is when you are
hurtling down towards your
death on a sheet of ice, but
going by results, I would say
panicking is definitely viable.
Flailing about madly, I jammed
my stick, my hand, and the
frame of my backpack into the
snow and stopped. It was a true
struggle to look nonchalant as I
regained my feet.
Having no choice, Tim and

Rob followed, and Tim pro
ceeded to do an even more im
pressive slide, winning him the
respect and admiration of his fel
lows. The rest of the hike, while
scenically gorgeous, failed to
match the thrilis of that morn
ing. That night we made it back
to the spot we had camped at the
first night.
As if to signal the end of hard
ship, we had spaghetti for din
ner that night, the first meal
since the first day that I could
eat. I set about it ravenously, and

Rob and Tim, out of either kind
ness for my starvation or fear of
losing a limb, did not interfere.
(The package indicated that a
longer boiling time was needed
at higher elevations, ludging by
the length of cooking time and
the subsequent ropy condition
of the spaghetti, water at our
elevation starts boiling shortly
after being putted from the
river.)
The next day was a simple re
verse of our first day, a long
downhill trek. We finished it be

fore lunch, and got into Rob's
truck to drive to the nearest out
post of civilization. Our trip was
over, but despite the fact I felt
we had retreated from Moscow
and my companions looked as
though they had been having an
extended vacation at Maze
prison, I was sorry it was over.
As I took my first shower in a
week back at Tim's house ...
Lafayette, I reflected upon the
events of the trip: the time Rob
slipped off a log bridge over a
river and nearly lost his shoes,

Tim finding a horse's skull and
carrying it 10 miles back to the
truck and the time I sat under the
shade of a tree by a bend of the
kern River and just stopped
thinking entirely to just fee/, i
don't think I can remember a
time that seemed more alive, re
laxed or fun. After all the pains
and the bad food and the bicker
ing, there were still the funny
times, the talk and the thrill of
following a path that showed me
so many different things and
never disappointed me despite
the fact it promised so much.

This is the second installment
of a series which began in last
luesday's Daily. As this part be
gins, the threesome have just
pitched camp after an arduous
hike which they could have av
oided by taking a new access
road to the park. Tempers, after
the long and futile hike, are
short.
It's hard to say who first had
the idea to poison the food and
thus do away with the rest of the
party, but it's safe to say that we
all did, eventually, consider the
idea, and, if I saw what I thought
I saw that third night, perhaps
someone even began im
plementation.
We spent the first night
peaceably enough, and we even
had the unexpected joy of fresh
hamburger for dinner, which
Tim had secretly packed in. Rob
and I were greatly pleased by
this, and by degrees the mood of
the camp thawed to open hostil
ity, and by next morning hit
mere open dissension. This
polarization was not helped by
the sleeping arrangements,
which divided three people
among two tents.
Curiously, it seemed to be
mere chance that I ended up
alone in the one-man tent every
night of the trip. (Of course, this
was obviously done so they
could scheme against my life.)
This suited us very well, as post
trip discussion revealed the fact
that Rob and Tim were sure that
any bear would go for the lone
— and therefore weaker — prey,
while I placed my faith in the be
lief that a ton or so of enraged,
half-starved grizzly would not be
in any way deterred by the pros
pect of facing two totally
panicked college students and
would go for the tent with more
meat.
There were no grizzly attacks
that trip, I am thankful to say, as
an old Navajo Indian trick of
cowering awake all night in my
tent listening for the slightest
sound kept them away quite
nicely. Alive, then, we awoke
the next morning, grimy and
bleary eyed, but perversely
eager for the day's voyage.
Our first serious, trip-ending
challenge hit us about five mi
nutes after we set out. Hiking as
we did early in the season, we
were faced with the normal

spring thaw and runoff. Last year
was an unusually precipitous
time, and the runoff was unusu
ally strong. So strong, in fact,
that the outdated and fiendishly
vague maps we had staked our
lives upon inidicated a trickle of
water to be crossed where in fact
there was a rather quaint torrent
in the act of washing out the
trail.
This incredibly cold water (I
had that morning in an attempt
to "wash my hair" stuck my head
in that water, resulting in a wash
ing trauma that had to be dealt
with immediately upon my re
turn to civilization) seemed to
signal the end of our trip, and a
return to the feather-soft beds
and properly cooked food of
civilization. We looked up and
down the river, and for 50 feet in
either direction we could see no
place to cross. However, just
when things were looking
brightest, I had an idea.
There were these rocks in the
middle of the river, fairly
medium-sized boulders, and it
was not an impossible jump
either to them from the bank,
nor to the far bank from that
point. Having the shortest stride
and thus the least chance of
either making or surviving the
jump, I chose to try the gap.
Being natively brilliant, I put
down my heavy walking stick,
and took a trotting leap at the
rock. Astoundingly, I made it,
slamming against the rock on all
fours, clutching its algae
smeared surface like a lover of
algae-smeared surfaces.
Of course, being mentally de
ficient, I had neglected to cast
off my 50-pound pack when I
dropped my stick. The pack,
being a much more ambitious
creature than \ — and perhaps
being ashamed at having to be
carried all this way; who can tell?
— chose to try to make the
whole jump at once, and, of
course, neglected to cast me off
first. When the momentum of
the pack hit I spun crazily over
the crown of the rock, and tee
tered precariously close to the
water.
The godsend of an adrenaline
burst saved me there (whoever
constructed the human body did
a really great thing with those
adrenal glands, only they should
be accessible when you can
enjoy them more, rather than

only when hanging by your toes
from an algae-coated rock) and I
clamhorod up and off. "Nothing
to it," I shouted. "Give it a
whirl!" Rob and Tim, being less
than a third the fool I am, total,
hurled their packs across to me,
thereby expediting their passage
and snapping several of my les
ser bones.
The day's trudging began in
earnest. We hiked through the
sandy plain, then up a rather
barren mountain, then through
a forested valley. I remember
thinking, "Say, you certainly can
travel far just by walking! Look at
that scenery unwind! What a
lovely place!" Which I admit is
not very profound, but put a

pack on you, trudge for two
days, and we'll see how Prous
tian you arp aftprwards.
We lunched again, peanut
butter from tubes and lemonade
made from wet river bacteria,
and concluded another day of
hiking and sightseeing with no
great problem. The best, as they
say, was yet to come.
That night we camped out
near a marshy bog, so as to bet
ter test out the advertising
claims of Cutter's insect repel
lant. (I should add, for those of
you who have never been and
are thinking of going, the most
vital piece of equipment you can
take on a camping trip is a five
or 10-gallon drum of Cutter's.

Insect repellant is the only thing
that will keep you alive in the
woods, and if you run out of
food, you can splash some on
one of the mosquitoes and feed
a family of five.)
Rob had, at this camp, a mysti

claimed, Daniel Boone had

shade of a tree by a bend of the
kern River and just stopped
thinking entirely to just fee/, i
don't think I can remember a
time that seemed more alive, re
laxed or fun. After all the pains
and the bad food and the bicker
ing, there were still the funny
times, the talk and the thrill of
following a path that showed me
so many different things and
never disappointed me despite
the fact it promised so much.

This is the second installment
of a series which began in last
luesday's Daily. As this part be
gins, the threesome have just
pitched camp after an arduous
hike which they could have av
oided by taking a new access
road to the park. Tempers, after
the long and futile hike, are
short.
It's hard to say who first had
the idea to poison the food and
thus do away with the rest of the
party, but it's safe to say that we
all did, eventually, consider the
idea, and, if I saw what I thought
I saw that third night, perhaps
someone even began im
plementation.
We spent the first night
peaceably enough, and we even
had the unexpected joy of fresh
hamburger for dinner, which
Tim had secretly packed in. Rob
and I were greatly pleased by
this, and by degrees the mood of
the camp thawed to open hostil
ity, and by next morning hit
mere open dissension. This
polarization was not helped by
the sleeping arrangements,
which divided three people
among two tents.
Curiously, it seemed to be
mere chance that I ended up
alone in the one-man tent every
night of the trip. (Of course, this
was obviously done so they
could scheme against my life.)
This suited us very well, as post
trip discussion revealed the fact
that Rob and Tim were sure that
any bear would go for the lone
— and therefore weaker — prey,
while I placed my faith in the be
lief that a ton or so of enraged,
half-starved grizzly would not be
in any way deterred by the pros
pect of facing two totally
panicked college students and
would go for the tent with more
meat.
There were no grizzly attacks
that trip, I am thankful to say, as
an old Navajo Indian trick of
cowering awake all night in my
tent listening for the slightest
sound kept them away quite
nicely. Alive, then, we awoke
the next morning, grimy and
bleary eyed, but perversely
eager for the day's voyage.
Our first serious, trip-ending
challenge hit us about five mi
nutes after we set out. Hiking as
we did early in the season, we
were faced with the normal

spring thaw and runoff. Last year
was an unusually precipitous
time, and the runoff was unusu
ally strong. So strong, in fact,
that the outdated and fiendishly
vague maps we had staked our
lives upon inidicated a trickle of
water to be crossed where in fact
there was a rather quaint torrent
in the act of washing out the
trail.
This incredibly cold water (I
had that morning in an attempt
to "wash my hair" stuck my head
in that water, resulting in a wash
ing trauma that had to be dealt
with immediately upon my re
turn to civilization) seemed to
signal the end of our trip, and a
return to the feather-soft beds
and properly cooked food of
civilization. We looked up and
down the river, and for 50 feet in
either direction we could see no
place to cross. However, just
when things were looking
brightest, I had an idea.
There were these rocks in the
middle of the river, fairly
medium-sized boulders, and it
was not an impossible jump
either to them from the bank,
nor to the far bank from that
point. Having the shortest stride
and thus the least chance of
either making or surviving the
jump, I chose to try the gap.
Being natively brilliant, I put
down my heavy walking stick,
and took a trotting leap at the
rock. Astoundingly, I made it,
slamming against the rock on all
fours, clutching its algae
smeared surface like a lover of
algae-smeared surfaces.
Of course, being mentally de
ficient, I had neglected to cast
off my 50-pound pack when I
dropped my stick. The pack,
being a much more ambitious
creature than \ — and perhaps
being ashamed at having to be
carried all this way; who can tell?
— chose to try to make the
whole jump at once, and, of
course, neglected to cast me off
first. When the momentum of
the pack hit I spun crazily over
the crown of the rock, and tee
tered precariously close to the
water.
The godsend of an adrenaline
burst saved me there (whoever
constructed the human body did
a really great thing with those
adrenal glands, only they should
be accessible when you can
enjoy them more, rather than

only when hanging by your toes
from an algae-coated rock) and I
clamhorod up and off. "Nothing
to it," I shouted. "Give it a
whirl!" Rob and Tim, being less
than a third the fool I am, total,
hurled their packs across to me,
thereby expediting their passage
and snapping several of my les
ser bones.
The day's trudging began in
earnest. We hiked through the
sandy plain, then up a rather
barren mountain, then through
a forested valley. I remember
thinking, "Say, you certainly can
travel far just by walking! Look at
that scenery unwind! What a
lovely place!" Which I admit is
not very profound, but put a

pack on you, trudge for two
days, and we'll see how Prous
tian you arp aftprwards.
We lunched again, peanut
butter from tubes and lemonade
made from wet river bacteria,
and concluded another day of
hiking and sightseeing with no
great problem. The best, as they
say, was yet to come.
That night we camped out
near a marshy bog, so as to bet
ter test out the advertising
claims of Cutter's insect repel
lant. (I should add, for those of
you who have never been and
are thinking of going, the most
vital piece of equipment you can
take on a camping trip is a five
or 10-gallon drum of Cutter's.

Insect repellant is the only thing
that will keep you alive in the
woods, and if you run out of
food, you can splash some on
one of the mosquitoes and feed
a family of five.)
Rob had, at this camp, a mysti
cal experience. Last night, he
claimed, Daniel Boone had
come to him in a dream, saying
that he was to receive an inheri
tance at the next campsight. Rob
spent the greater part of the next
day in a trance, something so
common we wouldn't have rec
ognized but for the fact he kept
repeating the words "forked
sticks," and although it sounded
familiar enough to our vocabul

ary, it was distinct enough to
notice.
Sure enough, after we
camped, he walked into the
woods only to return with a pair
of matched forked sticks, per
fect for creating a spit across the
fire to support our pots for din
ner. Rob went, frankly, berserk
from that point on, insisting he
was the son of the woods and
the "true heir to the forest," and
insisted on hiking naked the rest
of the way, but for a leather jer
kin, which, thankfully, he had
happened to have with him. The
excitement passed, we had an
execrable dinner and went to
sleep.
The next day's hike was like
the one previous, but added an
interesting touch of something
Tim called a "downhill slope,"
which I couldn't handle, falling
several times over the surface of
the planet, unaccustomed as I
was to this "downhill." Lunch
was, as ever, uninspired, but
dinner was exceptional.
For the first time in recorded
history, three men, starving
from little food and hard exer
tion, refused dinner. The dinner
was a freeze-dried lump of chic
ken and rice, which refused to
cook, merely sopping up all the
water in the pot and becoming
surlierand surlier. Ourtempers,
understandably, were short , and
when our badly needed dinner
chose to attain sentience instead
of edibility, we were a little curt.
Needless to say, some words
were exchanged, feelings were
hurt, and the chicken and rice
stalked off in a huff.
That night we lay about that
campsight by the dying fire and
indulged in some of that soul
stirring camaraderie.
"The stars are really bright out
here." "Yup. Really bright."
"Yup. See that?" "No. Shooting
star?" "Yup. Big one." "Hmm,
Stars are really bright."
The next day we were up and

about it again, and ran into our
first "other person." He told us
that the trail we had originally
planned to take was clogged
with ice, and we could "mebbe"
get by with an ice axe, some
rope, and, presumably, a team
of Marines with flamethrowers.
We reached summit that day,
slogging through ice and snow
in a strangely surreal trek. It
wasn't cold, but the ice wasn't
melting and the snow didn't
seem to mind. After we posed at
the summit for some tourist

snapshots, we faced the trail
again, happy, confident that the
worst was over, and heading for
a big fall.
We left the sun-drenched side
of the mountain to lose sight of
the trail in a seeminly endless
expanse of snow. Here things
got a little icy. Far down and far
left, we saw the dim vestiges of a
trail. We were going to have to
cross this sheet of ice to go on. I
looked out at that floe, then
down at my sneakers, then over
at my companions, seasoned
mountain men that they were.

Simply put, we were doomed.
Once again, wishing to be the
first to die so that I wouldn't
have to feel the crushing sense
of loss that befalls those left be
hind without food or shelter, I
set off first. Rapidly improvising
a Perfect Act of Contrition, I
scuttled my way across. Three
fourths of the way over, I turned
to spur my fellows on. They,
naturally letting me take the
brunt of any avalance or hidden
cavern, had held back. "Come
on," I shouted. "This is "

Thereupon I began my sleighride
I don't know exactly what the
best thing to do is when you are
hurtling down towards your
death on a sheet of ice, but
going by results, I would say
panicking is definitely viable.
Flailing about madly, I jammed
my stick, my hand, and the
frame of my backpack into the
snow and stopped. It was a true
struggle to look nonchalant as I
regained my feet.
Having no choice, Tim and

Rob followed, and Tim pro
ceeded to do an even more im
pressive slide, winning him the
respect and admiration of his fel
lows. The rest of the hike, while
scenically gorgeous, failed to
match the thrilis of that morn
ing. That night we made it back
to the spot we had camped at the
first night.
As if to signal the end of hard
ship, we had spaghetti for din
ner that night, the first meal
since the first day that I could
eat. I set about it ravenously, and

Rob and Tim, out of either kind
ness for my starvation or fear of
losing a limb, did not interfere.
(The package indicated that a
longer boiling time was needed
at higher elevations, ludging by
the length of cooking time and
the subsequent ropy condition
of the spaghetti, water at our
elevation starts boiling shortly
after being putted from the
river.)
The next day was a simple re
verse of our first day, a long
downhill trek. We finished it be

fore lunch, and got into Rob's
truck to drive to the nearest out
post of civilization. Our trip was
over, but despite the fact I felt
we had retreated from Moscow
and my companions looked as
though they had been having an
extended vacation at Maze
prison, I was sorry it was over.
As I took my first shower in a
week back at Tim's house ...
Lafayette, I reflected upon the
events of the trip: the time Rob
slipped off a log bridge over a
river and nearly lost his shoes,

Tim finding a horse's skull and
carrying it 10 miles back to the
truck and the time I sat under the
shade of a tree by a bend of the
kern River and just stopped
thinking entirely to just fee/, i
don't think I can remember a
time that seemed more alive, re
laxed or fun. After all the pains
and the bad food and the bicker
ing, there were still the funny
times, the talk and the thrill of
following a path that showed me
so many different things and
never disappointed me despite
the fact it promised so much.

lant. (I should add, for those of
you who have never been and
are thinking of going, the most
vital piece of equipment you can
take on a camping trip is a five
or 10-gallon drum of Cutter's.

Insect repellant is the only thing
that will keep you alive in the
woods, and if you run out of
food, you can splash some on
one of the mosquitoes and feed
a family of five.)
Rob had, at this camp, a mysti
cal experience. Last night, he
claimed, Daniel Boone had
come to him in a dream, saying
that he was to receive an inheri
tance at the next campsight. Rob
spent the greater part of the next
day in a trance, something so
common we wouldn't have rec
ognized but for the fact he kept
repeating the words "forked
sticks," and although it sounded
familiar enough to our vocabul

ary, it was distinct enough to
notice.
Sure enough, after we
camped, he walked into the
woods only to return with a pair
of matched forked sticks, per
fect for creating a spit across the
fire to support our pots for din
ner. Rob went, frankly, berserk
from that point on, insisting he
was the son of the woods and
the "true heir to the forest," and
insisted on hiking naked the rest
of the way, but for a leather jer
kin, which, thankfully, he had
happened to have with him. The
excitement passed, we had an
execrable dinner and went to
sleep.
The next day's hike was like
the one previous, but added an
interesting touch of something
Tim called a "downhill slope,"
which I couldn't handle, falling
several times over the surface of
the planet, unaccustomed as I
was to this "downhill." Lunch
was, as ever, uninspired, but
dinner was exceptional.
For the first time in recorded
history, three men, starving
from little food and hard exer
tion, refused dinner. The dinner
was a freeze-dried lump of chic
ken and rice, which refused to
cook, merely sopping up all the
water in the pot and becoming
surlierand surlier. Ourtempers,
understandably, were short , and
when our badly needed dinner
chose to attain sentience instead
of edibility, we were a little curt.
Needless to say, some words
were exchanged, feelings were
hurt, and the chicken and rice
stalked off in a huff.
That night we lay about that
campsight by the dying fire and
indulged in some of that soul
stirring camaraderie.
"The stars are really bright out
here." "Yup. Really bright."
"Yup. See that?" "No. Shooting
star?" "Yup. Big one." "Hmm,
Stars are really bright."
The next day we were up and

about it again, and ran into our
first "other person." He told us
that the trail we had originally
planned to take was clogged
with ice, and we could "mebbe"
get by with an ice axe, some
rope, and, presumably, a team
of Marines with flamethrowers.
We reached summit that day,
slogging through ice and snow
in a strangely surreal trek. It
wasn't cold, but the ice wasn't
melting and the snow didn't
seem to mind. After we posed at
the summit for some tourist

snapshots, we faced the trail
again, happy, confident that the
worst was over, and heading for
a big fall.
We left the sun-drenched side
of the mountain to lose sight of
the trail in a seeminly endless
expanse of snow. Here things
got a little icy. Far down and far
left, we saw the dim vestiges of a
trail. We were going to have to
cross this sheet of ice to go on. I
looked out at that floe, then
down at my sneakers, then over
at my companions, seasoned
mountain men that they were.

Simply put, we were doomed.
Once again, wishing to be the
first to die so that I wouldn't
have to feel the crushing sense
of loss that befalls those left be
hind without food or shelter, I
set off first. Rapidly improvising
a Perfect Act of Contrition, I
scuttled my way across. Three
fourths of the way over, I turned
to spur my fellows on. They,
naturally letting me take the
brunt of any avalance or hidden
cavern, had held back. "Come
on," I shouted. "This is "

Thereupon I began my sleighride
I don't know exactly what the
best thing to do is when you are
hurtling down towards your
death on a sheet of ice, but
going by results, I would say
panicking is definitely viable.
Flailing about madly, I jammed
my stick, my hand, and the
frame of my backpack into the
snow and stopped. It was a true
struggle to look nonchalant as I
regained my feet.
Having no choice, Tim and

Rob followed, and Tim pro
ceeded to do an even more im
pressive slide, winning him the
respect and admiration of his fel
lows. The rest of the hike, while
scenically gorgeous, failed to
match the thrilis of that morn
ing. That night we made it back
to the spot we had camped at the
first night.
As if to signal the end of hard
ship, we had spaghetti for din
ner that night, the first meal
since the first day that I could
eat. I set about it ravenously, and

Rob and Tim, out of either kind
ness for my starvation or fear of
losing a limb, did not interfere.
(The package indicated that a
longer boiling time was needed
at higher elevations, ludging by
the length of cooking time and
the subsequent ropy condition
of the spaghetti, water at our
elevation starts boiling shortly
after being putted from the
river.)
The next day was a simple re
verse of our first day, a long
downhill trek. We finished it be

fore lunch, and got into Rob's
truck to drive to the nearest out
post of civilization. Our trip was
over, but despite the fact I felt
we had retreated from Moscow
and my companions looked as
though they had been having an
extended vacation at Maze
prison, I was sorry it was over.
As I took my first shower in a
week back at Tim's house ...
Lafayette, I reflected upon the
events of the trip: the time Rob
slipped off a log bridge over a
river and nearly lost his shoes,

Tim finding a horse's skull and
carrying it 10 miles back to the
truck and the time I sat under the
shade of a tree by a bend of the
kern River and just stopped
thinking entirely to just fee/, i
don't think I can remember a
time that seemed more alive, re
laxed or fun. After all the pains
and the bad food and the bicker
ing, there were still the funny
times, the talk and the thrill of
following a path that showed me
so many different things and
never disappointed me despite
the fact it promised so much.
