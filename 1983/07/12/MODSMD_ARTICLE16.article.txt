# Romeo Void looks to make national music scene
## 
### ANDREW LISAC ALLAIRE PATTERSON 
Jaunty Debora lyall, lead singer
and lyricist for Romeo Void, re
flects that she has some good
reasons for ebullience, as we
cruise down Van Ness Street in
San Francisco.
She has just finished a practice
session at Pie in the Sky Studios
in the Mission District, she's ex
cited about the Void's new
drummer, Aaron Smith, who
debuts with the band at their two
piay dates this week to help
open Wolfgang's.The weather is
sunny and spectacular, she's
being noticed now on the streets
of the city, and she has just re
turned from her honeymoon in
Mexico with husband Paul. And
she adds, "You just saved me 60
cents bus fare."
lyall is disarmingly guileless
about the fervid, sensual lyrics in
Romeo Void's music and the
galvanic effect of that music on
dance floors across the country.
"We're not rich rock stars, you
know. I write a lot of lousy lyrics
until I write good ones. I'll come
in one day, then I'll go home and
say, gawd this is embarrassing,
and I'll rewrite until I get a song
where I want it. I always wrote
poetry, but I didn't necessarily
want to adapt it to music: I just
always wanted to sing.
"Once I complete a lyric, I
don't change it: I don't free as
sociate on stage. That comes
from maturity I think. We're not
teenagers, you know. When we

started we weren't a bunch of
kids somebody had to lead by
the hand and say 'Wear
jumpsuits! Spandex!' We had
our human knowledge already
there, so we learned fast, and
kept on learning."

'We're not rich rock stars, you know. I
write lousy lyrics until I write good ones.
111 come in one day, then I'll go home
and say, gawd this is embarrassing, and
111 rewrite until I get a song where I
want it/
-Deborah lyall

How does lyall, easily the
most noticeable of Void's musi
cians with her black leotards,
sparkling face, Cowlitz Indian
features and rotund stature, deal
with the pressure of being a pub
lic persona now? "Most times
people get my name wrong
(pronounced De-BOR-a), so I
can get away."
With a spate of articles on her
lyrics and stage performances,
does she resent critics compar
ing her to Chrissie Hynde and
other female rockers?
' Naw. People need some
thing to peg you. When you're
describing the color red, you
need to say it is like crimson or
something. It doesn't bother
me; I like Chrissie Hynde."
Earlier at the studios, near the
spot where the band's video was
shot, bassist Frank Zincavage

talks about the origins of the
band.
"We had no plans, no expec
tations. Debora was in perfor
mance video at the San Fran
cisco Art Institute, I was studying
sculpture, we joined up with

Peter Woods, a guitarist, and we
had a few drummers. We just
fluctuated for most of 1980 until
we found Ben Bossi (Void's
saxophonist)."
"I met Benjamin at the New
York City Deli," lyall adds teas
ingly, "where he was making
sandwiches. He had a great face.
I just sat and stared at him
forever. Finally somebody I
knew who worked there said
they would introduce me to him.
That's how we met."
"All we wanted was a certain
amount of quality and self
direction," says Zincavage, "who
seems to shoulder a lot of the
worries associated with support
ing various accountants, mana
gers, and crew members. "It was
never just one-two-three
-IHRASH: we wanted something
musically. You are always aware

of outside forces, but our desire
was never, for instance, to play a
Day on the Green."
Ben Bossi continues: "I think
risk has to be taken in music, as it
should be in all art forms.
There's a certain amount of not
knowing how something is
going to come off. But the band
is at a place, in performance,
where we've seen it all happen
except somebody collapse on
stage. Having Aaron with us for
the next two shows, since he has
never played with us, will be an
added excitement element.
We'll be wondering, you know,
will we get this song started
right?"
Romeo Void's members are
keeping current in other ways
which indicate the luxury to
which they are now accustomed
as musicians: by farming out

Void's sound, with its unique blend of
pulsating rhythmics, serpentine
saxophome lines and bottlerocket guitar
work, has won over most critics and es
tablished musicians in the Bay Area
music industry.

their talent to other, perhaps
less marketable bands. Bossi re
cently played at the l-Beam with
the Contractions, Zincavage
plays with Big Race and lyall sang
with the Red Rockers at the
openning of Wolfgang's.

"I've found that Romeo Void
has achieved a certain amount of
expectation," says Zincavage al
luding to universally positive
press reviews, "and that has
been phenomenal. But it limits
us also: when you play the
Kabuki, headline Old Waldorf's,
then play with U2 at the Civic,
you reach a point with San Fran
cisco promoters where you can't
just run down to Mabuhay for a
few spontaneous shows. So to
keep ourselves in there, we play
with other groups where expec
tations are not rules, and our
own sense of responsibility is
perhaps not so limiting. It's a
feeling of freedom."
"You have to be able to grow
and bring things back to the
band," declared lyall, "and I re
spect myself more because it
takes some determinization on

my part to involve more people
in my life and not keep Romeo
Void as a separate thing that is
my bnly identity. Hook at myself
as a singer, and as somebody's
daughter, and as somebody's
