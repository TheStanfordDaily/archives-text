# Columnist Will's role in "Debategate" questioned
## 
### 
Washington—The New York
Daily News is dropping his col
umn. Ronald Reagan is calling to
commiserate. And journalists all
over Washington are raising
their eyebrows at the actions of
George Will, one of their best
known colleagues, because he
helped rehearse then-candidate
Ronald Reagan for the debate
with Jimmy Carter, then went on
television to praise his man's
performance.
Like the debate over the pur
loined Carter briefing book, the

argument concerns events 30
months oid, known at the time
and reported since. But as the
story of the briefing book and
the arguments around it esca
lated, it generated an unex
pected spinoff: arguments over
the propriety of columnist Will's
participation in Reagan's rehear
sal for the debate.
In the process, some of this
town's leading journalists, who
professionally sit in judgement
on the ethics and actions of
politicians, have been put in the

uncomfortable position of judg
ing one of their own.
In October 1980, Ronald
Reagan's aides and allies—like
then-Rep. David Stockman —
were preparing dress rehearsals
of the upcoming Cleveland de
bate with Carter. They invited
several journalists to play the
role of mock interrogators. Will
agreed. At least one other con
servative columnist, William Sa
fire of The New York Times, de
clined.
The night of the debate, Will
appeared as a conservative
commentator on ABC-TV news,
describing Reagan's per
formance as that of a "tho
roughbred." Neither Will
nor the network made a direct
reference to his role in rehears
ing the event.
Now Will, whose bow tie and
professorial mien have become
standard fare on television and
whose starchy, clipped observa
tions have become a staple in
the country's ideological larder,
is on the receiving end of the
questions. Sunday, the Daily
News—one of 400 newspapers
that carry Wills' column (syndi
cated by The Washington Post
Writers Group)—announced in
an editorial it would drop the
column because his actions con
stituted "a violation of journalis
tic ethics."
Veteran Washington re
porters and columnists —
curmudgeonly conservative
lames Kilpatrick, relentlessly
liberal Carl Rowan, along with
bureau chiefs lack Nelson of the
Los Angeles Times, Paul Duke of
Public Broadcasting Corp. and
political editor John Mashek of
U.S. News and World Report—
all say Will crossed over the in
visible but indispensable boun
dary between observing an
event and participating in it.
Reagan apparently doesn't
think so. After Saturday night's
airing of "Agronsky & Co./' the

roundtable discussion program,
in which Will was grilled by three
fellow participants, the phone
rang in the 42-year-old Will's
suburban Maryland home.
Here is Will's recollection of
the conversation, as told Sunday
to the viewers of ABC's "This
Week with David Brinkley:"
Reagan: George, there are
two very peculiar ideas going
around. One is your nutty idea
that we are, as a nation, under
taxed. The second is that I need
people like you to tell me how to
go out in public and debate the
basic issues of our day.
Will: Well, I take your point.
And I want you to know that I'm
not saying that I'm necessary to
you.
That is the core of Will's de
fense: his role in the campaign
was negligible—they didn't
need him—and the whole de
bate is, as he said in a telephone
interview Sunday night, "over
wrought."
"If anyone was writing or
Commenting in public and in
volved in a systematic, ongoing,
day-to-day way with a political
campaign, that would be clearly
across the line," he said.
"There's the old analogy:
whether Strasbourg's in France.
Paris clearly is. Is Strasbourg?"
So this case is Strasbourg, not
Paris?
"Exactly."
He added he would not play
the dual role again, largely be
cause his role at ABC has
changed—then he was an out
sider occasionally invited to air
his conservative views, now he is
a regular panelist interviewing
guests on the Brinkley show.
Also, Will said, there is what he
calls "the Caesar's wife ques
tion: there are certain
facts about the sociology of
Washington that are hard for
people who don't live here to
understand. We meet one
another in a variety of contexts."

This particular combirfation of
contexts makes most of Will's
colleagues queasy. Roone Ar
ledge, ABC news president—
who said he asked Brinkley to
raise the issue Sunday—said he
is not entirely at ease with the
situation.
"At the time, George did not
have the role with us he has
how. . . ' he said Sunday. "We
had no control over whether or
what he did. The ethics involved
were his own and were not sub
ject to our policy toward our
own staff people. . .
"Yes, I would still have had
him on (ABC's 'Nightline' prog
ram the night of the debate). But
we would have asked him to dis
close more about what he did
and what his role was. Second, I
would have been interested
from a reportorial standpoint
how they prepared, did ques
tions they expect come out.
"I draw a very clear distinc
tion: if it were (ABC White
House correspondent) Sam
Donaldson and Jimmy Carter, it
would clearly be against the pol
icy we have. Working reporters,
editors, producers, can't be in
volved in politics in any way ex
cept to go vote.. . .On the other
hand, a columnist and commen
tator is in the business of giving
opinions. . . There is a gray area
there. . . With George's rela
tionship with us now, we would
not allow him to do that."
Meg Greenfield, editorial
page editor of The Washington
Post, said Sunday that Will's long
opinion piece appearing in Sun
day's editions was an admission
of error by Will. "To me, the
piece said he shouldn't have
done it, that it was a mistake,"
Greenfield said. "I agree he
shouldn't have done it. But we
have no intention of dropping
the column. We think it's a good
column."
