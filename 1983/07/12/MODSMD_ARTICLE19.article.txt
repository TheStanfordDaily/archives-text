# This time it's computers
## â€˜Whole Earth' Catalog creator Brand is at it again 
### CAROL PUTNAM 
Stewart Brand is tall, balding
ind well-built. He's handsome
n a ruddy sort of way, as if he's
jeen weathered by life in some
way. If you know anythingabout
Stewart Brand, you know that he
has in fact been weathered by
ife as much as he has done some
[of the weathering himself.
His speaking voice is deep,
but he has a funny high laugh
that speaks more to itself and its
owner that to anyone else. He's
an easy person to interview. His
comments and ramblings are
just the words great quotes are
made of. It's as though the Stan
ford graduate who produced the
Whole Earth Catalog talks with
the idea of being quoted.
"I came to Stanford because
of John Steinbeck. I was looking
for Cannery Row."
Stanford itself definitely
wasn't Cannery Row. "To com
mit suicide, get pregnant, or
dropout. . . orchangeschools"
all were considered sins.
Brand wishes he'd transfered
to Cal after two years at Stan
ford. Instead, he met Fred
Spiegelberg, professor of relig
ion. Spiegelberg read poetry
from the North Beach area to his
class, including pieces by Allen
Ginsberg.
Brand decided North Beach
was the place for him. Another
professor, Peter King, who
taught Western Civilization,
lived in North Beach, and "was a
Brit and a Bohemian to boot,"
Brand laughs.
After he graduated from Stan
ford, Brand lived at King's home.
"That cured me of four years at
Stanford and prepared me for
two years in the army with a
beatnik perspective." After
ward, he went from beatnik to
hippie to drug researcher in Ken
Kesey's acid tests. Then, drug
research was made illegal in
1966, so he became an "outlaw."
When lerry Brown was elected
governor, Brand became a paid
member of his personal staff for
two years. Brand decided work
ing in the government is "excit
ing, educational and exhaust
ing." He says his major attrac
tion was Brown, but that the
"Sacramento process needs an
asbestos personality."
He means that he doesn't have
the patience for the consensus
type of decision making that

goes on in government. He says
his business is "trying stuff, and
that is hard to do by consensus."
Brand worked with Brown on
producing the Water Atlas of
California and in forming the
California Conservation Corps.
Brand doesn't have much con
tact with Stanford now. He reads
the Observer that is sent to all
alumni. The first statement he
makes with regard to Stanford is
that he has the "feeling of having
been born too soon" because he
missed co-ed dorms.
He says one "grim mistake"
that lots of students make is
going to graduate school. "No
one has ever been improved by
going to grad school."
He also sees recent graduates
as having the problem of feeling
finished after they graduate.
"I don't understand the per
sistence of classes," he says.
"There are probably only about
two dozen teachers at Stanford
I'd be willing to listen to. The
others should be shot for the
criminal act of boring people."
Brand loves to make such
sweeping generalizations, espe
cially ones which are slightly out
of the ordinary or have the
chance of provoking an oppos
ing reaction. It is his way of set
ting a scene in motion and see
ing where it goes.
Brand thinks young people
should be and are more arrogant
than they were in the '60s.
"Arrogance is what it takes to
take a different path. . . As Ken
Kesey said once, 'if you don't
boil rocks and drink it, how do
you know it won't make you
drunk?' "
Brand sees this generation of
youth as different from his own
in that they are "more frag
mented, less sentimen
tal. . . they are marching to dif
ferent drummers rather than the
same different drummer."
Brand was a biology major at
Stanford and is glad that the de
partment is finally " integrated
with the rest of the universe"
through University President
Donald Kennedy's creation of
the Human Biology Department.
"We were a purposeful bunch
too," he says smiling. He thinks
that the career-mindedness of
this generation reflects the
times. "Our generation grew up
knowing we would be more
prosperous than our parents,

but this generation isn't sure.
"One is better off trying to
learn how to live with affluence
rather than how to achieve it,"
Brand advises. "Don't worry
about holding down a good job.
In fact, be a bad job holder. Go
through half a dozen jobs to try
things out. Don't try to be young
and successful. It's better to fail.
young. You don't have to decide
what you want to do with your
life until you're 30 anyway.
"Being intelligent isn't that
important at first. If you're too
intelligent, you'll try something
and it will work and you will
never learn anything. Be an op
portunist. . . nab it, use it, then
move on to the next one. Ac
quire as many skills as you can."
Brand's desk is predominantly
occupied by a personal compu
ter made by Kapro, a tiny com
pany in San Diego. He says com
puters are the "rejuvenators"
for his generation.
During a recent conversation
with Milton Friedman, Brand
commented that Friedman's re
cent receipt of the Nobel prize
might lead to the demise of his
career.
Friedman replied that the
reason for that trend is that re
ceiving a Nobel prize encour
ages people to keep doing what
they are already doing. By the
time you are old enough to get a
Nobel prize, you should be
doing something different,
Friedman said.
Brand hasn't received a Nobel
prize, but he has taken Fried
man's advice. He plays with his
eight-month-old personal com
puter and is working on his next
publication, The Whole Earth
Software Book. Computers are
similar to drugs, he says, "they
are both a kind of mental
technology." The difference is
that drugs can get old and pre
dictable.
"There are more surprises
with computers. They don't
punish you as bad either. Bur
they are more expensive."
Are computers are addictive
the way some drugs are? "Sure,"
answers Brands, "but the addic
tions are more benign."
I had heard from a friend of
Brand's that he was becoming
active in local politics and
wanted to know if this was a
move to political office. He
smiles and replies negatively.

He's active because the
Sausalito City Council wants to
develop the waterfront area, "to
sanitize it, make it known and
convenient. The reason I live
here is because it's scruffy." So,
Brand is doing his part in the
"eternal vigil" to keep the work
ing waterfront in Sausalito the
way it is.
As we leave the Co-Evolution
Quarterly building in Sausalito
where Brand has his office,

Brand asks if there are many stu
dents who get the magazine. I
reply that I don't know of any
and haven't seen them sold
around campus. He is not
pleased by this. I'm glad I just
bought a subscription for my sis
ter's birthday.
I drove around the waterfront

class, including pieces by Allen
Ginsberg.
Brand decided North Beach
was the place for him. Another
professor, Peter King, who
taught Western Civilization,
lived in North Beach, and "was a
Brit and a Bohemian to boot,"
Brand laughs.
After he graduated from Stan
ford, Brand lived at King's home.
"That cured me of four years at
Stanford and prepared me for
two years in the army with a
beatnik perspective." After
ward, he went from beatnik to
hippie to drug researcher in Ken
Kesey's acid tests. Then, drug
research was made illegal in
1966, so he became an "outlaw."
When lerry Brown was elected
governor, Brand became a paid
member of his personal staff for
two years. Brand decided work
ing in the government is "excit
ing, educational and exhaust
ing." He says his major attrac
tion was Brown, but that the
"Sacramento process needs an
asbestos personality."
He means that he doesn't have
the patience for the consensus
type of decision making that

goes on in government. He says
his business is "trying stuff, and
that is hard to do by consensus."
Brand worked with Brown on
producing the Water Atlas of
California and in forming the
California Conservation Corps.
Brand doesn't have much con
tact with Stanford now. He reads
the Observer that is sent to all
alumni. The first statement he
makes with regard to Stanford is
that he has the "feeling of having
been born too soon" because he
missed co-ed dorms.
He says one "grim mistake"
that lots of students make is
going to graduate school. "No
one has ever been improved by
going to grad school."
He also sees recent graduates
as having the problem of feeling
finished after they graduate.
"I don't understand the per
sistence of classes," he says.
"There are probably only about
two dozen teachers at Stanford
I'd be willing to listen to. The
others should be shot for the
criminal act of boring people."
Brand loves to make such
sweeping generalizations, espe
cially ones which are slightly out
of the ordinary or have the
chance of provoking an oppos
ing reaction. It is his way of set
ting a scene in motion and see
ing where it goes.
Brand thinks young people
should be and are more arrogant
than they were in the '60s.
"Arrogance is what it takes to
take a different path. . . As Ken
Kesey said once, 'if you don't
boil rocks and drink it, how do
you know it won't make you
drunk?' "
Brand sees this generation of
youth as different from his own
in that they are "more frag
mented, less sentimen
tal. . . they are marching to dif
ferent drummers rather than the
same different drummer."
Brand was a biology major at
Stanford and is glad that the de
partment is finally " integrated
with the rest of the universe"
through University President
Donald Kennedy's creation of
the Human Biology Department.
"We were a purposeful bunch
too," he says smiling. He thinks
that the career-mindedness of
this generation reflects the
times. "Our generation grew up
knowing we would be more
prosperous than our parents,

but this generation isn't sure.
"One is better off trying to
learn how to live with affluence
rather than how to achieve it,"
Brand advises. "Don't worry
about holding down a good job.
In fact, be a bad job holder. Go
through half a dozen jobs to try
things out. Don't try to be young
and successful. It's better to fail.

what you want to do with your
life until you're 30 anyway.
"Being intelligent isn't that

quire as many skills as you can."
Brand's desk is predominantly
occupied by a personal compu
ter made by Kapro, a tiny com
pany in San Diego. He says com
puters are the "rejuvenators"
for his generation.
During a recent conversation
with Milton Friedman, Brand
commented that Friedman's re
cent receipt of the Nobel prize
might lead to the demise of his
career.
Friedman replied that the
reason for that trend is that re
ceiving a Nobel prize encour
ages people to keep doing what
they are already doing. By the
time you are old enough to get a
Nobel prize, you should be
doing something different,
Friedman said.
Brand hasn't received a Nobel
prize, but he has taken Fried
man's advice. He plays with his
eight-month-old personal com
puter and is working on his next
publication, The Whole Earth
Software Book. Computers are
similar to drugs, he says, "they
are both a kind of mental
technology." The difference is
that drugs can get old and pre
dictable.
"There are more surprises
with computers. They don't
punish you as bad either. Bur
they are more expensive."
Are computers are addictive
the way some drugs are? "Sure,"
answers Brands, "but the addic
tions are more benign."
I had heard from a friend of
Brand's that he was becoming
active in local politics and
wanted to know if this was a
move to political office. He
smiles and replies negatively.

He's active because the
Sausalito City Council wants to
develop the waterfront area, "to
sanitize it, make it known and
convenient. The reason I live
here is because it's scruffy." So,
Brand is doing his part in the
"eternal vigil" to keep the work
ing waterfront in Sausalito the
way it is.
As we leave the Co-Evolution
Quarterly building in Sausalito
where Brand has his office,

Brand asks if there are many stu
dents who get the magazine. I
reply that I don't know of any
and haven't seen them sold
around campus. He is not
pleased by this. I'm glad I just
bought a subscription for my sis
ter's birthday.
I drove around the waterfront
area before leaving and thought
that this is the perfect place for
Stewart Brand.
Stewart Brand is tall, balding
ind well-built. He's handsome
n a ruddy sort of way, as if he's
jeen weathered by life in some
way. If you know anythingabout
Stewart Brand, you know that he
has in fact been weathered by
ife as much as he has done some
[of the weathering himself.
His speaking voice is deep,
but he has a funny high laugh
that speaks more to itself and its
owner that to anyone else. He's
an easy person to interview. His
comments and ramblings are
just the words great quotes are
made of. It's as though the Stan
ford graduate who produced the
Whole Earth Catalog talks with
the idea of being quoted.
"I came to Stanford because
of John Steinbeck. I was looking
for Cannery Row."
Stanford itself definitely
wasn't Cannery Row. "To com
mit suicide, get pregnant, or
dropout. . . orchangeschools"
all were considered sins.
