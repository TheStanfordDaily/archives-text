Lanford Wilson has been turn
ing out scripts with astonishing
regularity for nearly 20 years, but
his best writing can probably be
found in his 1979 Pulitzer Prize
winner Talley's Folly and its 1981
follow-up, A Tale Told. These
plays form the second and third
parts of a trilogy that began with
The Fifth of luly—though the lat
ter should more properly be cal
led the third part, since it takes
place two decades later. The
story goes that Trish Hawkins,
who has appeared in more of
Wilson's pieces than anyone
else, begged him to write her a
play about the younger days of
the eccentric widow, Sally
Friedman, who has a supporting
role in The Fifth of July. The re
sult was Talley's Folly.
A 97-minute two-character
one-act, Talley's Folly is a beauti
ful little romantic comedy,
nearly perfectly crafted. The set
ting is an extravagant ruin of a
boathouse on the property of
the wealthy Talleys of Lebanon,
Missouri, in the summer of 1944.
A year ago, on a week's vacation
to Lebanon, a Jewish immigrant
accountant residing in St. Louis,
Matt Freidman, fell in love with
Sally Talley, who—as he puts
it—"sees the world exactly as I
see it." Both are resolute left
wingers in a jingoistic wartime
America, and both are non
conformists, too, in another sig
nificant way—each is single and
long past the acceptable age for

marriage at this time. (Sally is 31,
Matt is 42.) Sally has been alter
nately encouraging Matt and
staving off his advances; he has
returned to Lebanon to ask her
to marry him.
The play is constructed as a
series of advances and retreats,
in which the two characters de
vise defense tactics to protect
themselves, and strategies to
penetrate each other's long es
tablished guard. Eventually Matt
and Sally allow themselves—
with considerable difficulty—to
confess the reasons for their re
spective unattached states. But
because the play is so deftly put
together and so funny, with two
unusually sympathetic charac
ters, it neatly avoids falling into
the cliches of eleventh-hour re
velation drama. In fact, Talley's
Folly is one of the few recent
Pulitzer Prize winners that
doesn't read like a reworking of
ideas from O'Neill or Tennessee
Williams or Arthur Miller. Wil
liams' influence is suggested,
along with Thornton Wilder's, in
the style of Matt's opening
monologue, but the content of
the play is distinctly Lanford Wil
son's.
The current production of Tal
ley's Folly at the Stanford Thea
ter, directed by John Weeks and
featuring Jordan Charney as
Matt, is a reasonable facsimile of
the production I saw at the
Theatre in the Square in San
Francisco last summer, except
that Caroline Smith has replace

Greg Webb/Daily
Trish Hawkins as Sally. Charney,
who followed Judd Hirsch in the
part on Broadway, is certainly
skillful at rendering Matt's rich
store of schtick—he gets all his
laughs. But the last time I saw
Charney as Matt, his charm
didn't seem as practiced, and he
wasn't pushing as hard. It might
have been a case of opening
night in a new house, and in
deed Charney seemed to loosen
up in the second half.
Largely because of Jordan
Charney's somewhat heavy
handed approach to Matt on Fri
day evening, the play seemed a
little slower and more emphatic
than it ought to—it took on
some of the qualities of a
matinee drama. When Matt
takes too much time over his
pauses—as, for example, when
he remembers ice skating in his
too-brief childhood in Europe
and murmurs, "Some memories
linger"—the play threatens to
become maudlin, which is un
just to Lanford Wilson. Matt's
gift for keeping serious matters
afloat on a stream of comic
banter is the play's lifeline, and it
also explains why Sally can be
terribly attracted to him and yet
baffled by him at the same time.
When he uncovers his history
for her, the horror story he tells
her is cloaked in stand-up com
edy, so that she doesn't know
how to read it and finally—when
he inadvertently touchesa sensi

tive chord in her own past—
rejects it as a shrewdly con
ceived fiction. Charney delivers
this crucial passage with so little
emotional restraint that when
Sally accuses him of lying, you
wonder how she could be so in
sensitive.
That is, you would wonder if
another actress were playing
Sally, but Caroline Smith hand
les this transition so well—she
makes you feel the sharpness of
the thorns inside Sally—that she

steers the production out of
these dangerous waters. In the
first few minutes of the show,
Smith seemed nervous, and she
missed a few beats important for
establishing Sally's feelings for
Matt and for her bigoted, over
bearing family. (The initial
dialogue is very difficult tor any
actress playing Sally; we already
know and love Matt before she
enters, as a consequence of ihe
lengthy opening monologue.)
But once she began to communi
cate her love for rural Missouri
and the renegade grandfather
who built the boathouse (the
"folly" of the title), it was clear
that she had tapped into the
center of the character.

Smith is a far warmer Sally
than Trish Hawkins was (in San
Francisco, at any rate), and
though she isn't consistently
excellent —she ought to find
more ways of reacting to Matt's
advances than the pained, con
fused smile she keeps relying
on—she carries off all the key
moments in the role. If lordan
Charney can rediscover the ease
he had last summer, and if he
begins to play to Smith rather
than at her in the climactic
scenes, this Talley's Folly might
end up satisfying the demands
Matt sets up for it in his opening
speech: . . .this should be a
waltz, one-two-three, one-two
three. . . "
