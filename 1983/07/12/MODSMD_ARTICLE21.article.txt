'The Survivors'
The idea of casting Robin Wil
liams as a man whose new-found
machismo leads him to enroll in
a survival camp is terribly funny,
and for the first half of this
Michael Ritchie comedy the
freshness of Williams' timing
and line readings keeps it from
sinking. He mixes mushheaded
hip posturing with the rowdy,
profane confidence of a would
be tough guy, retaining that un
assailable innocence through
out that throws a parodistic
perspective on both the hip and
the macho routines. No comic
has ever been wild in quite this
way before—he's like a baby on

an acid trip. But the picture is a
dud, and it gets worse and worse
as it winds its interminable way
through a nonsensical story
about the struggle of two victims
(Williams and Walter Matthau)
to defeat a crook (Jerry Reed).
Matthau's sour-faced resigna
tion is a familiar joy in the early
scenes, but he's stuck with most
of the sentimental moments in
Michael Leeson's script, and
with much of the dialogue
Ritchie hasn't found a tone for.
He's also been given a
daughter—a non-role that
Ritchie and Leeson are appa
rently fond of, since she's in the
entire second half of the film
even though she has no bearing
on any of the action. (She's also

played Kristen Vigard, a young
woman with no visible signs of
talent.) James Wainwright plays
the director of the survival
camp—a role that sounds prom
ising (like Bert Convy's take-off
on EST counsellors in Rithchie's
Semi-Tough) but is thrown
away—as if the filmmakers
thought that all they had to do to
get laughs was to suggest the
character.
'The Return of Martin
Guerre'
This resonant tale of the man
who left his home in mid-16th
century France to fight in the
wars, returned to general rejoic

ing eight years later, and then
was accused of impersonating
the real prodigal, was originally
set down by Jean de Coras, one
of the justices in the case (and
later a victim of the St. Barth
olomew Massacre). Since then,
it has been turned into fiction,
drama and opera. Daniel Vigne's
new film version, with a script by
Vigne and )ean-Claude Carriere,
concentrateson making the man
claiming to be Martin Guerre as
attractive as possible: this sym
pathetic context springs the nar
rative mechanism. And by cast
ing Gerard Depardieu, the most
appealing (and the most sensu
ous and instinctual) of French
actors in the title role, Vigne has
insured that the mechanism will

indeed work

It's a very ordinary movie,
though, full of noisy, boisterous
peasants who laugh lewdly and
burst into tarantellas at the
slightest provocation—the bane
of historical pictures. Depar
dieu's work here is far from his
best (you have to see Going
Places or The Last Woman or Get
Out Your Handkerchiefs to see
what he can really do), and as his
wife, Bertrande, Nathalie Baye
has a touchingly sweet smile but
demonstrates a restricted
range—she always seems to be
walking under a cloud. Janet
Lewis's ironic 1941 novella, The
Wife of Martin Guerre, would

have made a more intriguing
drama, although it would have
required someone like Isabelle
Adjani to carry off the complex
part of Bertrande as Lewis con
ceived it.
'Angelo My Love'
I found Robert Duvall's last
performance, in Tender Mercies
infuriatingly fraudulent, and all
the acting in this movie, which
he wrote and directed, is of the
same ilk. The gypsies in the film
are played by gypsies with the
same names as the characters,
who improvise long, undramatic

arguments so that we can pre
tend we're watchinga documen
tary. We're not, however—and
drab, shapeless documentary
"style" pictures like this one
give real documentaries a bad
name. Angelo My Love is about
nothing, just as Tender Mercies
was about nothing. Duvall is ob
viously charmed by 10-year-old
Angelo Evans and his family and
friends, but he forgets to show
us why; I've rarely encountered
so many ear-splittingly loud,
tiresome, unappetizing
characters in a single film. The
only exception is a bizarre little
girl named Cathy Kitchen who
performs adult country and
western songs professionally.
She's in the wrong movie,
though—she belongs with
Robert Altman.
