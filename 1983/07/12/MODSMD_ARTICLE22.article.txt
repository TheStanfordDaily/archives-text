# The 						B-52's fight implosion
## 
### TONY KELLY 
For a band that comes across
as innocuously as last week's —
or last month's — spaghetti, the
B-52's have some of the most
curiously self-destructive ten
dencies of any group in rock
music. Which is a nice way of
saying that when the B-52's are
good, they are very, very good,
and when they're bad, they
tread ontheouter edges of aural

dogmeat.
But it's the way in which they
tread that is so interesting. For
the most part, the B-52's are so
disarmingly, blatantly, appal
lingly simple that it's very easy to
like them, and easy to feel like a
jerk if you hate them. That's Sec
ret Number One behind party
bands of history, from the
Motown axis of the late '50s to
the Go-Go's, and the B-52's have

mastered the art of the one
chord groove to the point that
when they throw in some
chintzy musical touches from
the days of Spike )ones (such as
the xylophone on "Give Me
Back My Man" and the entirety
of "Rock Lobster"), it seems
downright sophisticated.
At the same time, one cannot
imagine the B-52's without those
bargain-basement production

values, and that's where the
self-destruction part comes in.
These folks are the rock equiva
lent of Steve Martin; they joke
about so many things that they
can't help joking about them
selves, and the audience some
times isn't sure whether to laugh
or throw things. F'rinstance,
tcike a song like "Give Me Back
My Man," which has a legitimate
claim to being the '52's most

durable song of quality, espe
cially when seen in the context
of Cindy Wilson's Billie
Holliday-ish fling with it at the
group's concert a short while
back at the Creek Theatre in
Berkeley. There's a lot to like in
this ditty — a (one-chord) guitar
hook you can hang cattle on, a
stunning job of singing, the
usual outstanding drumming
from Keith Strickland (the only
real musician in the band —
c'mon, admit it), etc. But there's
also that damn xylophone, as
well as your prototypical B-52's
chorus: "I'll give you fish, I'll
give you candy, I'll give you any
thing . . . just give me back my
man." Remember, this is a dura
ble song we're talking about.
No other band is quite as fas
cinatingly awful as when the
B-52's go through Flopsweat Al
ley. With other bands, unin
spired shows are missteps,
minor obstacles in a business fil
led with fits and starts. With this
band, common mistakes lead
one to question their chances of
surviving till the next Georgia
peach crop. And the mistakes
have come — a lackluster sec
ond album, the deadly Party Mix
EP, the aborted album with
David Byrne of Talking Heads
that eventually resulted in
Mesopotamia (which, despite
the pressure of more good
songs than any other record by
the band, was a commercial —
uh — stiff), et al.
I've seen this group four times
now (once opening for Talking
Heads in one of the more impre
ssionable concert experiences
of my young life), and found
them puzzling and — worse —
boring each time until now. A
bad '52's performance is more
than an uninspired show — it's
an implosion, where the col
lected (intentional) vacuities of

the bandmembers collapse
upon themselves and finally just
sit there, void and empty of even
the fun that is the band's highest
ambition. People dance anyway,
but people are like that.

At their Creek Theatre show,
the roles were reversed. The au
dience danced (sometimes
frighteningly so, dragging a un
iformed cop into the throng
from the stage at the end of the
show), and the B's were confi
dent, showy and happy — not at
all like before, and finally living
up to expectations. They
shouldn't stop looking over

their shoulders just yet — "But
terbeans" off Whammy! is the
worst song I've heard from this
bunch ever — but if the B-52's
keep this up, they just might
earn the title that has always
been just out of their grasp: the
most genuinely (and happily)
stoopid rock group this side of
Van Halen. And that's meant as a
compliment.
