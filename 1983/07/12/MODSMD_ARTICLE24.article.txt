Ecuador plane crash kills 119
Quito, Ecuador — A jetliner plowed into a mountain
and exploded in flames while attempting to land in
the Andes city of Cuenca yesterday, killing all 119
people aboard in Ecuador's worst aviation disaster.
The Boeing 737 was on a scheduled 40-minute flight
from Quito to Cuenca, 250 miles south of the Ecuado
ran capital. It carried 112 passengers, including a
haby. and a crew of seven, the aviation authority said.
Most were believed to be Ecuadorean civilians. Al
though the plane belonged to a military airline, it
carried both civilians and military personnel and
cargo.
The civil aviation director, Gen. Eduardo Duran,
said an investigation into possible sabotage had been
ordered after a Cuenca radio station reported witnes
ses saw the plane explode before crashing.
He said he could not confirm the explosion report
by the radio station, the Voice of Tomebamba of
Cuenca, but that he could not rule out sabotage.
The general said an investigation had been ordered
but did not elaborate.
Judge orders checks freed
A federal judge yesterday ordered California to pay
unemployment benefits blocked by a state budget'
'mpasse, while Pennsylvanians hoped gubernatorial
action before midnight would free state aid and salary
checks frozen by a budget stalemate.
In Sacramento, U.S. District Judge Milton Schwartz
ordered that overdue checks for i46,61S jobless resi
dents be paid immediately. He also freed an addi
tional 234,000 checks due later this week, but left
frozen checks for 84,000 recipients of state disability
benefits.
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian and the *
Democratic-controlled state Legislature have been
unable to resolve their dispute over a tax increase,
leaving the state without authority to pay benefits
since the fiscal year ended June 30.

Cera Curry, spokeswoman for the state Employ
ment Development Department, said the checks
should be in the mail within 48 hours. "I don't think it
will take that long," she added. "We were expecting
the order today, and we're geared up."
Schwartz ruled that federal law requires the state to
pay the unemployment benefits and that the federal
law supersedes any state law or lack of a state law.
Therefore, only the unemployment checks, which
are federal funds held by the state, were affected, and
not state disability benefits.
A separate suit was pending before the California
Supreme Court yesterday seeking to free the disabil
ity benefits and state health-care funds withheld be
cause of the budget.
In addition, about 1000 state university and college
professors have not been paid salary checks, and 5400
highway maintenance workers are due paychecks
this week.
The budget fight centers around new taxes.
Deukmejian wants to veto $1.2 billion from the unba
lanced $27.2 billion proposed budget, but Democrats
want to cover the deficit with tax increases, saying the
budget has already been trimmed enough.
Central American aid proposed
Washington — A longstanding idea to launch a sort
of Marshall Plan to aid Central America suddenly has
become the newest bandwagon on Capitol Hill.
It's latest form is a proposal, introduced 3Vi weeks
ago by Senators Henry Jackson (D-Wash.) and
Charles Mathias |r. (R-Md.), for a blue-ribbon study
commission to decide overall U.S. policies in the
region.
The Reagan administration has not endorsed the
plan publicly but has left little doubt privately that a
bipartisan congressional call for a study commission
would be welcomed warmly at the White House.
National security affairs adviser William Clark told
Mathias the idea "was exactly the response they were
looking for," according to a Mathias aide.

Under the proposal, the president woald appoint a
bipartisan national commission of distinguished bus
iness, Hispanic, labor, government, education and
religious leaders. They would consult with Central
American leaders and political figures about long
term problems of poverty, democratic development
and human rights in the region.
The commission would report in six months, mak
ing recommendations on military and economic aid,
trade, political and social policies the United States
should pursue to help deal with the problems over
the next 50 years.
Reagan's current Central America policy faces
widespread skepticism and ignorance among the
public and in Congress as election year approaches,
but no coherent counterproposals for the entire reg
ion have emerged. The result has been bickering and
stalemate over an issue that all sides agree is crucial to
the United States role in the world.
Stock market rallies
New York — The stock market rallied in quiet trade
yesterday with a boost from some better-than
expected news on the money supply.
But trading set its slowest pace in more than three
months on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.31 to
1215.54 by 2 p.m.
Gainers held a 3-2 lead over losers among New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
After the close on Friday, the Federal Reserve re
ported a S3 billion decline in the basic measure of the
money supply. The drop substantially exceeded ad
vance estimates on Wall Street.
The Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee
meets privately today and Wednesday. Analysts still
expect the Committee to give serious consideration
to tightening credit somewhat.
Today's weather
Sunny and hot today. Overnight lows in the 50s;
highs in the 90s.'
