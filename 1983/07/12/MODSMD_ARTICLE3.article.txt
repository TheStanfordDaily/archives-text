# Reagan archives search continues
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
A congressional committee
moved Sunday to attain orig
inal copies of all Carter cam
paign documents found in
the Reagan archives at the
Hoover Institution.
Rep. Donald Albosta (D-
Mich.), the chairman of the
House committee investigat
ing how Carter campaign
papers ended up in the hands
of Reagan staffers, requested
that Hoover archivists send
Carter documents directly to
the committee rather than to
the Justice Department or the
White House.
However, archivists at
Hoover said that they had
notified Albosta that they
cannot provide the commit
tee with access to the papers
without proper authorization
from President Reagan.
Charles Palm, deputy ar
chivist, said he had passed
the committee's request on
to White House.
The committee acted after
former Carter aides
suggested that the docu

ments might be tampered
with. However, there is still
no plan to send FBI agents to
Hoover to oversee the search
for Carter papers.
Palm said the search is con
tinuing under his supervision
as Hoover archivists search
through every box of mate
rials.
Carter aides became con
cerned about the vulnerabil
ity of possible Carter docu
ments at Hoover when press
reports indicated that addi
tional papers had been found
at Hoover.
However, Palm refused to
confirm those reports.
"I will neither confirm nor
deny the truth of that," he
said. "We do not intend to
make a statement."
United Press International
reported that Hoover ar
chivists discovered a copy of
a campaign memo addressed
to David Gergen, then a
Reagan campaign staffer and
now White House communi
cations director, entitled
"Proposed Carter tactics for

debate and campaign adver
tising."
A handwritten note from
Reagan campaign staffer
Wayne Vails was attached to
the memo, saying that the
debate briefing information
came from a "source inti
mately connected to a Carter
debate staff member."
The note also said that a
copy of the memo was sent to
lames Baker, then a senior
campaign staffer and now
White House chief of slai'f. Al
though the original memo
was previously released,
Baker's copy of the memo
was not found at the White
House.
But the missing copy was
discovered among Baker's
papers at Hoover, according
to UPI, in a file labeled "Ed
Meese."
The Hoover Institution
holds Reagan's papers from
his 1976 and 1980 presidential
campaigns, as well as from his
pre-gubernatorial, guber
natorial, interim and transi
tion years.
