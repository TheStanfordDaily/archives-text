## Italian politics shows some change, some continuity 
### 
Rome—The slump in support for the
Christian Democrats in last month's gen
eral election illustrates how far Italy has
come since the early postwar era when
politics here was dominated by primal in
fluences like the fear of communism and
the powerof the Roman Catholic Church.
At the same time, the country's failure
to develop a stable two-party system—
with power alternating between left and
right—points to the gulf that still sepa
rates Italy from the rest of Western
Europe. The country seems condemned
to a succession of weak center-left coali
tions during a period when it is most in
need of a strong government to tackle its
deepening economic crisis.
Negotiations on forming a new ad
ministration, Italy's 44th since World War
11, are expected to pick up momentum
when parliament reconvenes Tuesday.
Encouraged by the Christian Democratic
losses, both the Socialists and the minor
lay parties in the center have been de
manding a bigger say in policy making
and a larger share of ministerial seats.
The political maneuvering has been

complicated by the fact that, while the
election was certainly "lost" by the Chris
tian Democrats, it is hard to say who
"won."
The Christian Democrats' share of the
vote for the Chamber of Deputies fell to
its lowest level ever: 32.9 percent, down
from a steady plateau of around 38 per
cent for the past two decades and well
over 40 percent in the 19505.
The relative ranking of the other major
parties remained the same. The Com
munists won 29.9 percent of the vote, the
Socialists 11.4 percent, and the neofascist
Italian Social Movement 6.8 percent. The
number of Italians who deliberately
spoiled their ballots or cast blank ballots
rose by nearly one third compared to the
last elections in 1979.
Many analysts attributed the Christian
Democrats' losses to social and
psychological changes in the Italian
electorate—and the party's failure to
modernize its appeal.
"For years, a vote for Christian democ
racy was a negative vote," political scien
tist Norberto Bobbio wrote in the Turin

newspaper La Stampa. "The
people. . .didn't want communism.
Today the fear of communism is less and
so is the vote for the Christian Democ
rats."
In 1948, when the Christian Democratic
vote reached a peak of 48.5 percent, Italy
was still a poor and predominantly ag
ricultural country. Memories of the de
vastation wrought by World War II and
Benito Mussolini's fascist dictatorship
were vivid. The Cold War was just begin
ning and the overwhelming majority of
Italians wanted to remain part of the
West.
Thirty-five years later, Italy has become
industrialized, thanks to the "economic
miracle" of the early 19605. There has
been a massive migration from south to
north and from the countryside to the
cities. The Communist Party has broken
with Moscow and the Christian Democ
rats no longer enjoy such close ties with
the Vatican as they once did. But political
power is still wielded in the old, tradi
tional way—through local patronage and
personal friendships.

The election result was interpreted as a
personal defeat for Christian Democratic
Secretary Ciriaco de Mita, who had
sought to project a new image of effi
ciency and dynamism for his party after a
string of corruption scandals and a record
of economic mismanagement. His goal
was to transform the Christian Democrats
into a modern conservative party on the
West German or British pattern.
Key elements in De Mita's strategy
were the forging of an alliance with the
business community rather than the
church and strengthening of the party in
the great cities rather than the coun
tryside.
As it turned out, the Christian Democ
rats performed disastrously in the
cities—running second to the Com
munists virtually everywhere except in
their traditional strongholds in the south
like Bari and Palermo. In the northern
industrial centers of Milan and Turin,
they lost ground to the small Republican
Party, which has been rather more consis
tent in its advocacy of rigorous economic
policies. The Washington Post
