# Supreme Court uses full power
## 
### 
Washington—ln a display of awesome and
singular power, the Supreme Court capped its
1982-83 term by shackling Congress, buttres
sing abortion rights, outlawing federal tax
breaks for racially discriminatory schools, and
banning pensions that shortchange women.
The court appeared to drift further from the
philosophy of narrow interpretation that had
been its hallmark throughout the 1970s and
showed in key decisions a greater penchant for
aiming at the most sweeping impact.
In one of the most important constitutional
rulings in its history, the court struck down the
"legislative veto" long used by Congress to rein
in regulatory agencies and presidential power.
The decision, written far more broadly than
necessary to resolve the particular issue before
the court, will force fundamental changes in
the relationship between the federal govern
ment's legislative and executive branches.
The justices also spoke in broad phrases
when they reaffirmed and strengthened their
1973 decision that legalized abortion. Their re
cent decision struck down Akron, Ohio, ordi
nances that would have made abortions more
difficult to obtain.
The court invoked "fundamental public pol
icy" in ruling that the Internal Revenue Service
was right to prohibit federal tax breaks for pri
vate schools that discriminate against blacks.
The justices paid little attention in that ruling
to Reagan administration arguments that the
IRS policy used against Bob Jones University in
South Carolina and the Goldsboro Christian
Schools in North Carolina, along with other
schools, never was authorized by Congress.
And on the final day of its nine-month ses
sion, the court ruled that federal law bans
employer pension plans providing smaller
monthly retirement checks for women. As in
validated Arizona pension plan did just that be
cause women, as a group, live longer than men
and collect pension pay for a longer time.
Politically, the court's strength still lies at its
core—the centrist justices whose minds, hearts
and votes are fought for by the liberal and con
servative factions. But those "swing voters"
now appear more willing to let the court flex its
muscles.
Chief Justice Warren Burger, as in recent

years, exercised his opinion-writing assign
ment power to assure he spoke for the court in
some of its most important rulings—including
the legislative veto and IRS policy cases.
That power was made more evident by the
fact that Burger dissented from only 13 of the
court's 152 full decisions.
Often, however, the crucial votes were cast
by the court's majority makers of the center —
Justices Byron White, Lewis Powell, Harry
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
In most matters, Justices Sandra Day O'Con
nor and William Rehnquist can be found with
fellow conservative Burger.
Justice Thurgood Marshall most often voted
with Brennan as he has for more than a decade.
In the most pronounced voting trend, the
court provided several significant victories for
law enforcement forces over dissenters' pro
tests that individual rights were being sac
rificed.
In four of those decisions, Mrs. O'Connor
led the court with support from Burger, Powell,
Rehnquist and White.
