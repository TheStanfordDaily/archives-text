# Interest rates will rise, remain high

Washingtonâ€”The best time to
borrow money is apparently
past.
For the most part,, consumer
interest rates have gone as low
as they are likely to go, and, in
many cases, have begun to
climb. Few analysts see them
coming down again soon.
The median fixed mortgage in
terest rate in New England,
for instance, was 12.5 percent in
May, assuming a 30-year term
and 20 percent down payment.
Last month, it edged up to 13
percent, and Ann Eggleston, as
sistant vice president of the Fed
eral Home Loan Bank of Boston,
predicted a 13.25 percent to 13.5
percent figure by the end of this
month and 13.75 percent by the
end of August.
Whether it is for homes, cars,
or or some money to fix up the
den, wherever one turns for
lendable funds these days, the
prospects are strikingly similar.
"Rates will continue to go
up," said Kenneth Goldstein, as
sociate economist at the New
York-based Conference Board,
an economic research group. "I
don't see them coming back
down until the start of next
year."
There are two major reasons
for the coming crunch.
One is fear of inflation. As the
economy continues to recover,
the Federal Reserve Board is be
coming increasingly concerned
that the cost of living will soar
anew.
As Otto Eckstein, chairman
and chief economist at the
Lexington, Mass.-based Data
Resources Inc., put it, "Fed
Chairman Paul Volcker's great
historical accomplishment is the
successful disinflation of the U.S
economy.
"He is hardly likely to give
back this costly victory by ac
commodating accelerating infla
tion."

Inflation is running at an an
nual rate of only about 3 percent
and there are few fears it will re
ignite anywhere close to
double-digit levels this year.
But some believe it will gain
momentum next year or in 1985,
since a healthy economy means
more people with more money.
Reportedly, many Reagan ad
ministration officials believe if
steps can be taken to ever-so
slightly slow the recovery, it may
help discourage prices from spi
raling.
Officially, the administration
is opposed to such a move,
however, lust last Thursday,
President Reagan's spokesman,
Larry Speakes, commenting on
news stories, said flatly, "We
don't want the discount rate
raised." He was refering to the
interest the Fed charges its own
borrowers, mostly member
banks of the Federal Reserve
System.
Despite Speakes' statement, it
is expected that when the Fed's
policy-making Open Market
Committee meets in Wash
ington this week, it will
take steps to nudge up interest
rates slightly, with the hope of
cooling off the economy
slightly.
A second deterrent to lower
interest rates is the federal de
ficit. Now pegged to hit a record
$208 billion before fiscal 1983
ends Sept. 30, it becomes more
of a nagging problem as the re
covery speeds up.
Simply put, as more and more
private interests get healthy and
seek to borrow money, they
must compete for the funds with
the government, which has its
own obligations to pay.
To the consumer, all this is
likely to mean he will pay more
for the money he borrows, at
least through the summer.
