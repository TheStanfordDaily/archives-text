## Don Caughey Academic freedom: wealth, power and responsibility 
### 
It was my hope to inspire some discussion with my
effort on Hoover, (Daily, June 21) and I welcome Edwin
Harwood's response (Daily, June 24) despite the hostility
he displays, and I am willing to let those who can
evaluate choose between us. I have little illusion that I
will persuade Harwood or anyone who sees himself
holding the fort against "my camp"and our "fashiona
ble orthodoxies." I would like to correct his reading of
what I wrote on several items and to respond to some of
his arguments. I will apologize for not making myself
clearer, but I find it difficult to recognize myself as Har
wood paints me nonetheless.
In the first place, my point was that the discussion of
Hoovpr and the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL) had not raised the really important
ethical issues. Therefore I would agree neither "sound
management" nor "academic freedom" are the proper
places to explore the important issues. I do believe that
management involves a consideration of ethics integral
to theory. I also believe that "academic freedom" is
more than the equivalent of the key to the executive
washroom or a sinecure—l believe that it has a social
purpose to safeguard public access to the truth.
Truth is not merely a matter of curiosity; it has real
political and ethical importance, particularly in ademoc
racy. The charge I made against discussions of academic
freedom which made no reference to truth and social
justice was just that: without accountability and respon
sibility, academic freedom has little to do with what
matters.
Harwood seems unable to distinguish between my
desire that ethics be given its due in these discussions
and his allegation that I regard only those who agree
with me about the content of ethics as responsible. I see
no need to prejudice the case in this way. The only
orthodoxy I have any investment in is old enough to take
care of itself, and while I have a certain faith in the
reliability of traditional teachings on peace and justice, it
is a faith that invites the tests of history and intellectual
inquiry. My claim that we all come to the discussion with
bias and that some of us (or them) are good at teaching
and learning was intended to emphasize the point that
we share a human difficulty in separating our interests
from our views. I don't find any of this controversial.
I will stand most firmly behind my claim that we
should be more suspicious of ideas which serve wealth
and power (and which can hardly hurt our careers) than
with those which challenge our interests and cozy fu
tures. There is little analogous between the Reagan ad
ministration and the Weimar republic, but since it is the
case with which Harwood proposes to challenge me, I
will respond to it.
First, Weimar was weak because it did not represent
the German establishment of wealth a,id power. That
class would become the essential support for Hitler in
the belief that they could use his nationalism to their
benefit and to deal a blow to communism in Germany.
Second, a scholar should have suspicions that official
versions of events are slanted to serve political ends, and
that would have been true in Weimar. Third, the rejec
tion of what I hope even Harwood can recognize as
"idealogical nonsense" in Naziism is not difficult to any
one who does not want to believe it. Like the "domestic
Ku Klux Klan, the early Hitler represented a sociological
reality worth understanding; but unless American
wealth and power were to support the KKK it would

remain irrelevant to American politics. The point is sim
ply this: such ideas are only important when they gain
financial backing, and even then the ideas are less im
portant than how or why they are used politically.
To read Harwood, one would imagine that we were
awash with trenchant socialist critiques. I account for
the "boomlet in radical Marxist critiques of American
society," as exactly that: a minor increase for a short
time in attention to social problems and non
establishment perspectives. It was hard not to admit that
some things were wrong with racism and imperialism
during the '60s, but without the war and Martin Luther
King it has been easy to ignore questions which resist
easy answers. I am sure Harwood sees the press and
media as being to his left, and I will admit that there are
much less liberal elements of the establishment. Still,
can anyone name an avowed or demonstrable Marxist
spokesperson, columnist, commentator or media ex
pert? Outside of Mother Jones and the New York Re
view, hardly mass circulation publications, the public
would never know that the "boomlet" in Marxism had
occurred.

The problem with confining our
consideration of academic
ethics to academic freedom is
that it ignores the way ideas are
used; it also ignores the way in
which foolishness which pays
and flatters attains respectabil
ity.

To the contrary, the heated up Cold War has brought
its renewed "red scare." I am glad Harwood will defend
the right of Marxists to engage in free but polite discus
sion, but others in his camp have a stonger allegiance to
(heir versions of national security than h«. lust as Lou
Grant was canceled because Ed Asner spoke out on El
Salvador, our society is plagued by an anti-communism
which is more than intellectually intolerant. One need
not be a pro-communist to regret and be angry about the
poisoned intellectual environment due to well-financed
anti-communism. One need not even be a Marxist
radical —as many priests in countries such as Guatemala
have learned—to find that seeking justice for the victims
of oppression in very modest ways can prove lethal.
Harwood's version of history and the present situation
speaks for itself. He agrees with Reagan that the USSR is
the evil empire and that the world needs our righteous
military power to defend itself against that evil. He be
lieves that "our leaders are hesitant" to commit Ameri
can military power and resources "because the Left on
our campuses succeeded in persuading so many that it
wasn't communism that posed a threat to freedom but

America's effort to combat it." He is certain that
Nicaragua is on the way to being "more repressive than
the regime that preceded it"and, by implication, that
those wonderful repression moderates, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and
other "friends," will soon follow.
To be absolutely clear, I support the aspirations for
freedom of the Afghani and Polish peoples (and others
whose Cold War oppressors are not us). I oppose (out of
love of country as well as loyalty to justice) our subver
sion ofand denial of those aspirations where we do the
same things of which we accuse the Russians. To sup
port the Poles and Afghanis, it makes sense to me that
reducing Cold War tensions through arms control and
the renewal of detente would make their strategic value
to the Soviet Union less. Since I believe that the Russians
will do what they think they must to defend their interest
as they see it, I have reservations about supplying armed
struggles where we will not do more. It seems so obvi
ous that we should not go to war over either Poland or
Afghanistan that I hardly think it necessary to add that by
more, I mean something more than supporting more of
the Cold War which has put Poland and Afghanistan in
the shape they are in.
Our support for the government of South Africa and
for the brutal and often genocidal oligarchies of Central
America (and for Marcos in the Philippines) has jeopar
dized not only the freedom, but the lives of at least as
many as Harwood believes could be saved from the
Russians by increased U.S. interventionism. Those who
label every popular movement to overthrow oppressive
regimes of the right as "communist" and who subsume
issues of justice and freedom to an EastAVest globalism
have some gall in accusing these movements of being
Soviet-backed. Nor will I fail to credit the consistency
shown by Cuba and Nicaragua in supporting others
whose history parallels their own. It would be nice if our
military and economic aid were going to regimes which
were giving capitalism a good name. It might even make
some anti-communist sense to compete for revolutio
nary clients with the Russians in places like South Africa.
Finally, the problem with academic freedom is not that
it allows ideas as foolish as those stated by Harwood to
enter the public debate. The problem with the ideas is
not that they are foolish, but that such foolishness is
useful to people who are very clever about keeping their
power and wealth. The problem with confining our con
sideration of academic ethics to academic freedom is
that it ignores the way the ideas are used; it also ignores
the way in which foolishness which pays and flatters
attains respectability.
I really wish there were some critical appraisals from
the Right and that Hoover's intellectual challenge could
get my adrenalin going the way its politics do. I wish to
let truth and justice judge me as well as my opponents,
and I protest the academic relativism which allows fund
able ideologies equal time with critical thought. I am
sorry Harwood is offended because I think he espouses
nonsense, but now that he has written his response I see
no reason to alter that opinion. If he wishes, I would be
willing to continue the conversation to persuade him he
is wrong in private, and I thank him for demonstrating in
these pages the kind of ideological nonsense which I
believe is typical of Hoover. Now the readers can judge
for themselves rather than take my word for it.

Okay, so ive were bluffing; this time. Who knows if
you'll be as lucky next time around. Unless you start
submitting to us, your deepest and darkest fears
may suddenly become a brutally stark reality. Can
you afford to take that chance? Write for the

that it ignores the way ideas are
used; it also ignores the way in
which foolishness which pays
and flatters attains respectabil
ity.

To the contrary, the heated up Cold War has brought
its renewed "red scare." I am glad Harwood will defend
the right of Marxists to engage in free but polite discus
sion, but others in his camp have a stonger allegiance to
(heir versions of national security than h«. lust as Lou
Grant was canceled because Ed Asner spoke out on El
Salvador, our society is plagued by an anti-communism
which is more than intellectually intolerant. One need
not be a pro-communist to regret and be angry about the
poisoned intellectual environment due to well-financed
anti-communism. One need not even be a Marxist
radical —as many priests in countries such as Guatemala
have learned—to find that seeking justice for the victims
of oppression in very modest ways can prove lethal.
Harwood's version of history and the present situation
speaks for itself. He agrees with Reagan that the USSR is
the evil empire and that the world needs our righteous
military power to defend itself against that evil. He be
lieves that "our leaders are hesitant" to commit Ameri
can military power and resources "because the Left on
our campuses succeeded in persuading so many that it
wasn't communism that posed a threat to freedom but

America's effort to combat it." He is certain that
Nicaragua is on the way to being "more repressive than
the regime that preceded it"and, by implication, that
those wonderful repression moderates, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and
other "friends," will soon follow.
To be absolutely clear, I support the aspirations for
freedom of the Afghani and Polish peoples (and others
whose Cold War oppressors are not us). I oppose (out of
love of country as well as loyalty to justice) our subver
sion ofand denial of those aspirations where we do the
same things of which we accuse the Russians. To sup
port the Poles and Afghanis, it makes sense to me that
reducing Cold War tensions through arms control and
the renewal of detente would make their strategic value
to the Soviet Union less. Since I believe that the Russians
will do what they think they must to defend their interest
as they see it, I have reservations about supplying armed
struggles where we will not do more. It seems so obvi
ous that we should not go to war over either Poland or
Afghanistan that I hardly think it necessary to add that by
more, I mean something more than supporting more of
the Cold War which has put Poland and Afghanistan in
the shape they are in.
Our support for the government of South Africa and
for the brutal and often genocidal oligarchies of Central
America (and for Marcos in the Philippines) has jeopar
dized not only the freedom, but the lives of at least as
many as Harwood believes could be saved from the
Russians by increased U.S. interventionism. Those who
label every popular movement to overthrow oppressive
regimes of the right as "communist" and who subsume
issues of justice and freedom to an EastAVest globalism
have some gall in accusing these movements of being
Soviet-backed. Nor will I fail to credit the consistency
shown by Cuba and Nicaragua in supporting others
whose history parallels their own. It would be nice if our
military and economic aid were going to regimes which
were giving capitalism a good name. It might even make
some anti-communist sense to compete for revolutio
nary clients with the Russians in places like South Africa.
Finally, the problem with academic freedom is not that
it allows ideas as foolish as those stated by Harwood to
enter the public debate. The problem with the ideas is
not that they are foolish, but that such foolishness is
useful to people who are very clever about keeping their
power and wealth. The problem with confining our con
sideration of academic ethics to academic freedom is
that it ignores the way the ideas are used; it also ignores
the way in which foolishness which pays and flatters
attains respectability.
I really wish there were some critical appraisals from
the Right and that Hoover's intellectual challenge could
get my adrenalin going the way its politics do. I wish to
let truth and justice judge me as well as my opponents,
and I protest the academic relativism which allows fund
able ideologies equal time with critical thought. I am
sorry Harwood is offended because I think he espouses
nonsense, but now that he has written his response I see
no reason to alter that opinion. If he wishes, I would be
willing to continue the conversation to persuade him he
is wrong in private, and I thank him for demonstrating in
these pages the kind of ideological nonsense which I
believe is typical of Hoover. Now the readers can judge
for themselves rather than take my word for it.

Okay, so ive were bluffing; this time. Who knows if
you'll be as lucky next time around. Unless you start
submitting to us, your deepest and darkest fears
may suddenly become a brutally stark reality. Can
you afford to take that chance? Write for the
opinions page; before it's too late.
It was my hope to inspire some discussion with my
effort on Hoover, (Daily, June 21) and I welcome Edwin
Harwood's response (Daily, June 24) despite the hostility
he displays, and I am willing to let those who can
evaluate choose between us. I have little illusion that I
will persuade Harwood or anyone who sees himself
holding the fort against "my camp"and our "fashiona
ble orthodoxies." I would like to correct his reading of
what I wrote on several items and to respond to some of
his arguments. I will apologize for not making myself
clearer, but I find it difficult to recognize myself as Har
wood paints me nonetheless.
In the first place, my point was that the discussion of
Hoovpr and the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL) had not raised the really important
ethical issues. Therefore I would agree neither "sound
management" nor "academic freedom" are the proper
places to explore the important issues. I do believe that
management involves a consideration of ethics integral
to theory. I also believe that "academic freedom" is
more than the equivalent of the key to the executive
washroom or a sinecure—l believe that it has a social
purpose to safeguard public access to the truth.
Truth is not merely a matter of curiosity; it has real
political and ethical importance, particularly in ademoc
racy. The charge I made against discussions of academic
freedom which made no reference to truth and social
justice was just that: without accountability and respon
sibility, academic freedom has little to do with what
matters.
Harwood seems unable to distinguish between my
desire that ethics be given its due in these discussions
and his allegation that I regard only those who agree
with me about the content of ethics as responsible. I see
no need to prejudice the case in this way. The only
orthodoxy I have any investment in is old enough to take
care of itself, and while I have a certain faith in the
reliability of traditional teachings on peace and justice, it
is a faith that invites the tests of history and intellectual
inquiry. My claim that we all come to the discussion with
bias and that some of us (or them) are good at teaching
and learning was intended to emphasize the point that
we share a human difficulty in separating our interests
from our views. I don't find any of this controversial.
I will stand most firmly behind my claim that we
should be more suspicious of ideas which serve wealth
and power (and which can hardly hurt our careers) than
with those which challenge our interests and cozy fu
tures. There is little analogous between the Reagan ad
ministration and the Weimar republic, but since it is the
case with which Harwood proposes to challenge me, I
will respond to it.
First, Weimar was weak because it did not represent
the German establishment of wealth a,id power. That
class would become the essential support for Hitler in
the belief that they could use his nationalism to their
benefit and to deal a blow to communism in Germany.
Second, a scholar should have suspicions that official
versions of events are slanted to serve political ends, and
that would have been true in Weimar. Third, the rejec
tion of what I hope even Harwood can recognize as
"idealogical nonsense" in Naziism is not difficult to any
one who does not want to believe it. Like the "domestic
Ku Klux Klan, the early Hitler represented a sociological
reality worth understanding; but unless American
wealth and power were to support the KKK it would

remain irrelevant to American politics. The point is sim
ply this: such ideas are only important when they gain
financial backing, and even then the ideas are less im
portant than how or why they are used politically.
To read Harwood, one would imagine that we were
awash with trenchant socialist critiques. I account for
the "boomlet in radical Marxist critiques of American
society," as exactly that: a minor increase for a short
time in attention to social problems and non
establishment perspectives. It was hard not to admit that
some things were wrong with racism and imperialism
during the '60s, but without the war and Martin Luther
King it has been easy to ignore questions which resist
easy answers. I am sure Harwood sees the press and
media as being to his left, and I will admit that there are
much less liberal elements of the establishment. Still,
can anyone name an avowed or demonstrable Marxist
spokesperson, columnist, commentator or media ex
pert? Outside of Mother Jones and the New York Re
view, hardly mass circulation publications, the public
would never know that the "boomlet" in Marxism had
occurred.

The problem with confining our
consideration of academic
ethics to academic freedom is
that it ignores the way ideas are
used; it also ignores the way in
which foolishness which pays
and flatters attains respectabil
ity.

Okay, so ive were bluffing; this time. Who knows if
you'll be as lucky next time around. Unless you start
submitting to us, your deepest and darkest fears
may suddenly become a brutally stark reality. Can
you afford to take that chance? Write for the
opinions page; before it's too late.
It was my hope to inspire some discussion with my
effort on Hoover, (Daily, June 21) and I welcome Edwin
Harwood's response (Daily, June 24) despite the hostility
he displays, and I am willing to let those who can
evaluate choose between us. I have little illusion that I
will persuade Harwood or anyone who sees himself
holding the fort against "my camp"and our "fashiona
ble orthodoxies." I would like to correct his reading of
what I wrote on several items and to respond to some of
his arguments. I will apologize for not making myself
clearer, but I find it difficult to recognize myself as Har
wood paints me nonetheless.
In the first place, my point was that the discussion of
Hoovpr and the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL) had not raised the really important
ethical issues. Therefore I would agree neither "sound
management" nor "academic freedom" are the proper
places to explore the important issues. I do believe that
management involves a consideration of ethics integral
to theory. I also believe that "academic freedom" is
more than the equivalent of the key to the executive
washroom or a sinecure—l believe that it has a social
purpose to safeguard public access to the truth.
Truth is not merely a matter of curiosity; it has real
political and ethical importance, particularly in ademoc
racy. The charge I made against discussions of academic
freedom which made no reference to truth and social
justice was just that: without accountability and respon
sibility, academic freedom has little to do with what
matters.
Harwood seems unable to distinguish between my
desire that ethics be given its due in these discussions
and his allegation that I regard only those who agree
with me about the content of ethics as responsible. I see
no need to prejudice the case in this way. The only
orthodoxy I have any investment in is old enough to take
care of itself, and while I have a certain faith in the
reliability of traditional teachings on peace and justice, it
is a faith that invites the tests of history and intellectual
inquiry. My claim that we all come to the discussion with
bias and that some of us (or them) are good at teaching
and learning was intended to emphasize the point that
we share a human difficulty in separating our interests
from our views. I don't find any of this controversial.
I will stand most firmly behind my claim that we
should be more suspicious of ideas which serve wealth
and power (and which can hardly hurt our careers) than
with those which challenge our interests and cozy fu
tures. There is little analogous between the Reagan ad
ministration and the Weimar republic, but since it is the
case with which Harwood proposes to challenge me, I
will respond to it.
First, Weimar was weak because it did not represent
the German establishment of wealth a,id power. That
class would become the essential support for Hitler in
the belief that they could use his nationalism to their
benefit and to deal a blow to communism in Germany.
Second, a scholar should have suspicions that official
versions of events are slanted to serve political ends, and
that would have been true in Weimar. Third, the rejec
tion of what I hope even Harwood can recognize as
"idealogical nonsense" in Naziism is not difficult to any
one who does not want to believe it. Like the "domestic
Ku Klux Klan, the early Hitler represented a sociological
reality worth understanding; but unless American
wealth and power were to support the KKK it would

remain irrelevant to American politics. The point is sim
ply this: such ideas are only important when they gain
financial backing, and even then the ideas are less im
portant than how or why they are used politically.
To read Harwood, one would imagine that we were
awash with trenchant socialist critiques. I account for
the "boomlet in radical Marxist critiques of American
society," as exactly that: a minor increase for a short
time in attention to social problems and non
establishment perspectives. It was hard not to admit that
some things were wrong with racism and imperialism
during the '60s, but without the war and Martin Luther
King it has been easy to ignore questions which resist
easy answers. I am sure Harwood sees the press and
media as being to his left, and I will admit that there are
much less liberal elements of the establishment. Still,
can anyone name an avowed or demonstrable Marxist
spokesperson, columnist, commentator or media ex
pert? Outside of Mother Jones and the New York Re
view, hardly mass circulation publications, the public
would never know that the "boomlet" in Marxism had
occurred.

The problem with confining our
consideration of academic
ethics to academic freedom is
that it ignores the way ideas are
used; it also ignores the way in
which foolishness which pays
and flatters attains respectabil
ity.

To the contrary, the heated up Cold War has brought
its renewed "red scare." I am glad Harwood will defend
the right of Marxists to engage in free but polite discus
sion, but others in his camp have a stonger allegiance to
(heir versions of national security than h«. lust as Lou
Grant was canceled because Ed Asner spoke out on El
Salvador, our society is plagued by an anti-communism
which is more than intellectually intolerant. One need
not be a pro-communist to regret and be angry about the
poisoned intellectual environment due to well-financed
anti-communism. One need not even be a Marxist
radical —as many priests in countries such as Guatemala
have learned—to find that seeking justice for the victims
of oppression in very modest ways can prove lethal.
Harwood's version of history and the present situation
speaks for itself. He agrees with Reagan that the USSR is
the evil empire and that the world needs our righteous
military power to defend itself against that evil. He be
lieves that "our leaders are hesitant" to commit Ameri
can military power and resources "because the Left on
our campuses succeeded in persuading so many that it
wasn't communism that posed a threat to freedom but

America's effort to combat it." He is certain that
Nicaragua is on the way to being "more repressive than
the regime that preceded it"and, by implication, that
those wonderful repression moderates, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and
other "friends," will soon follow.
To be absolutely clear, I support the aspirations for
freedom of the Afghani and Polish peoples (and others
whose Cold War oppressors are not us). I oppose (out of
love of country as well as loyalty to justice) our subver
sion ofand denial of those aspirations where we do the
same things of which we accuse the Russians. To sup
port the Poles and Afghanis, it makes sense to me that
reducing Cold War tensions through arms control and
the renewal of detente would make their strategic value
to the Soviet Union less. Since I believe that the Russians
will do what they think they must to defend their interest
as they see it, I have reservations about supplying armed
struggles where we will not do more. It seems so obvi
ous that we should not go to war over either Poland or
Afghanistan that I hardly think it necessary to add that by
more, I mean something more than supporting more of
the Cold War which has put Poland and Afghanistan in
the shape they are in.
Our support for the government of South Africa and
for the brutal and often genocidal oligarchies of Central
America (and for Marcos in the Philippines) has jeopar
dized not only the freedom, but the lives of at least as
many as Harwood believes could be saved from the
Russians by increased U.S. interventionism. Those who
label every popular movement to overthrow oppressive
regimes of the right as "communist" and who subsume
issues of justice and freedom to an EastAVest globalism
have some gall in accusing these movements of being
Soviet-backed. Nor will I fail to credit the consistency
shown by Cuba and Nicaragua in supporting others
whose history parallels their own. It would be nice if our
military and economic aid were going to regimes which
were giving capitalism a good name. It might even make
some anti-communist sense to compete for revolutio
nary clients with the Russians in places like South Africa.
Finally, the problem with academic freedom is not that
it allows ideas as foolish as those stated by Harwood to
enter the public debate. The problem with the ideas is
not that they are foolish, but that such foolishness is
useful to people who are very clever about keeping their
power and wealth. The problem with confining our con
sideration of academic ethics to academic freedom is
that it ignores the way the ideas are used; it also ignores
the way in which foolishness which pays and flatters
attains respectability.
I really wish there were some critical appraisals from
the Right and that Hoover's intellectual challenge could
get my adrenalin going the way its politics do. I wish to
let truth and justice judge me as well as my opponents,
and I protest the academic relativism which allows fund
able ideologies equal time with critical thought. I am
sorry Harwood is offended because I think he espouses
nonsense, but now that he has written his response I see
no reason to alter that opinion. If he wishes, I would be
willing to continue the conversation to persuade him he
is wrong in private, and I thank him for demonstrating in
these pages the kind of ideological nonsense which I
believe is typical of Hoover. Now the readers can judge
for themselves rather than take my word for it.
