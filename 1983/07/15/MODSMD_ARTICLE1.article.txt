### TIM GRIEVE CHRIS SPRINGER 
The FBI has taken over the
search at Hoover Institution for
clues about how a briefing book
from Jimmy Carter's 1980 presi
dential campaign found its way
into the Reagan camp.
Hoover archivists had been
conducting their own search of
the 550 linear feet of Reagan
campaign materials at Hoover,
but terminated their search
when the FBI arrived Wednes
day morning.
Charles Palm, Hoover's acting
archivist, said that Hoover .per
sonnel have "withdrawn en
tirely" from the search but are
standing by to assist the FBI
agents as needed.
"We've turned the search
over to them. We've withdrawn

completely. We're not doing
anything because there's no
point in our getting involved,"
Palm said.
Palm would not comment on
an earlier United Press Interna
tional report that a memo from
Reagan campaign volunteer
Wayne Vallis to White House Di
rector of Communications
David Gergen discussing pur
loined campaign materials had
been found at Hoover.
Palm also refused to comment
on the FBl's search or security
methods at Hoover.
The FBl's involvement comes
after Hoover officials received a
letter earlier this week from
presidential advisor Edwin
Meese authorizing them to open
the archives to the FBI and allow
