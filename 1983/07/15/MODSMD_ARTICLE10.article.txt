# Chrysler vows to repay debt on tax guaranteed loans early
## 
### 
Washington—Chrysler Corp., the nation's re
vived N0.3 automaker, has recovered enough
from its financial woes to pay off the last $800
million of $1.2 billion in federally guaranteed
loans seven years early, company chairman Lee
lacocca said today.
The loans, which are owed to private lenders
but guaranteed by the government, were not
due to be paid off until 1990. When they were
granted in 1980 and 1981, many observers
doubted aloud whether they would be paid at
all.
The guarantee plan had been approved by
Congress and then-President Carter in late 1979
and early 1980 as a way of saving Chrysler,
which was widely seen as being on the brink of
bankruptcy.
lacocca, in his speech at the National Press
Club, said, "Today is such a great occasion, my
inclination is to just stop now and hold a party."
But he went on to celebrate the cooperation of
the government, the company and its
employees in bringing Chrysler back.
"In a way, maybe it was social democracy at
its best," lacocca said. "We had help from all
levels of government—Capitol Hill, the White
House, the state house and city hall. And my
question is simply this: What is so wrong with
that?"
Earlier in the day, he met with President
Reagan, apparently to tell him of the company's
plans.
After approval by Congress and Carter, the
plan was put into effect by a Chrysler Loan
Guarantee Board made up of Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker, Treasury Secretary Wil
liam Miller and the U.S. comptroller general.
When current Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan became Reagan's representative on the
board after the new president's election, he
went along with the $400 million third install
ment of the loans in early 1981. But he also
warned the company he would not be so quick
to say yes if it came back for the remaining $300
million in the original $1.5 billion in guarantees
approved by Congress.

Chrysler paid off the third installment of the
loans last month, paying it first because it had
the highest interest rates.
Since the first loans in 1980, Chrysler has
managed a financial recovery, earning $172.1
million in the first quarter this year.
Wall Street analysts say Chrysler is expected
to post second-quarter earnings of $290 mill
ion, which would set a quarterly earnings re
cord for the company.
And officials said in Detroit today that com
pany car sales in early July were up 51 percent
from the same period of last year. Chrysler's
decision last month to repay part of the loans
early sparked criticism by union officials who
complained that the automaker's workers were
being paid far less than their counterparts at
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., the
nation's No. 1 and No. 2 automakers, respec
tively.
The workers had given up millions of dollars
in benefits and pay increases as their share of
keeping their employer afloat.
lacocca said today, "The United Auto Work
ers and its members want to share in our suc
cess, and we expect to sit down with them
shortly and talk it out."
He also mentioned but did not resolve
another issue concerning options to buy 14.4
million shares of Chrysler stock at $13 each—
stock "warrants" that the company gave the
government as part of the loan-guarantee deal.
The stock's price has risen along with the au
tomaker's fortunes, and it was selling today for
$31 a share—a potential windfall for the gov
ernment.
Earlier, this year the company asked the gov
ernment to give the warrants back, but the re
quest was dropped after it brought criticism
from Congress and elsewhere.
The loan board said in a statement that it has
approved a request from the Chrysler Corpora
tion to repay the remaining $800 million in U.S.
government-guaranteed debt. The repayment
of these notes, originally scheduled to mature
in 1990, is expected to occur by Sept. 30, 1983.

million in the first quarter this year.
Wall Street analysts say Chrysler is expected
to post second-quarter earnings of $290 mill
ion, which would set a quarterly earnings re
cord for the company.
And officials said in Detroit today that com
pany car sales in early July were up 51 percent
from the same period of last year. Chrysler's
decision last month to repay part of the loans
early sparked criticism by union officials who
complained that the automaker's workers were
being paid far less than their counterparts at
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., the
nation's No. 1 and No. 2 automakers, respec
tively.
The workers had given up millions of dollars
in benefits and pay increases as their share of
keeping their employer afloat.
lacocca said today, "The United Auto Work
ers and its members want to share in our suc
cess, and we expect to sit down with them
shortly and talk it out."
He also mentioned but did not resolve
another issue concerning options to buy 14.4
million shares of Chrysler stock at $13 each—
stock "warrants" that the company gave the
government as part of the loan-guarantee deal.
The stock's price has risen along with the au
tomaker's fortunes, and it was selling today for
$31 a share—a potential windfall for the gov
ernment.
Earlier, this year the company asked the gov
ernment to give the warrants back, but the re
quest was dropped after it brought criticism
from Congress and elsewhere.
The loan board said in a statement that it has
approved a request from the Chrysler Corpora
tion to repay the remaining $800 million in U.S.
government-guaranteed debt. The repayment
of these notes, originally scheduled to mature
in 1990, is expected to occur by Sept. 30, 1983.
