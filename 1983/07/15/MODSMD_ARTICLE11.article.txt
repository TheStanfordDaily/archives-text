## Ignorance is sophistication 
### 
Chris Butchko's opinion piece of July 8 is one of
the most reactionary, anti-intellectual articles I
have seen in the Daily in quite some time. He is
guilty of the very thing he accuses the scientific
community of—obstinately and dogmatically
clinging to that which is wrong.
First of all, throughout his article, he uses the
term "science' when he seems to mean "technol
ogy." He says that from the '20s through the '50s,
"Science was roaring along, changing the world,
improving our lives, ruining the environ
ment,. . . " Science ("knowledge, as of general
truths or particular facts, obtained and shown to
be correct by accurate observation," according to
the Scnbner-Bantam English Dictionary' itself was
neither responsible for "improving our lives" nor
ruining the environment." If was the application
of scientific knowledge, generally by non
scientists, that brought these changes about, in
as much as thev occured.

It seems very fashionable these
days to brag about one's ignor
ance,, but I think Chris Butchko
has taken this trend a bit too far.

On a similar note. Butchko states that as of the
1930s nothing really great remained to be done in
science. But bv his examples of not-so-great
achievements (Tang and teflon), he demonstrates
that yyhen he savs "science." he clearly means
"technology." and that a "great" discovery is one
that has a significant effect of Chris Butchko's life.
E\en working within his use of the term "science. "
though, it is plain sillv to sav that nothing signifi
cant has happened in the past 20 years. (I won't
even mention microprocessor technologN satel
lite communications, or videocassette
recorders—well, mavbe I'll just mention them.)
\ good deal ot Butchko's impression of the sci
entific community s attitude seems to be based on
what he has read in the popular press. This, I
suppose, is responsible for his belief in the pri
ssiness" and conceit of science. One this matter
like to make two points.
First, it is generally considered socially unac
ceptable by the scientific community for a scientist
to present his research results via the popular
press rather than via the scholarly journals. For this
reason, what vou read in the newspaper about
science does not. in general, reflect the attitudes
of the scientific mainstream.
Second, the goal of a newspaper's owners is to
sell papers, which they are not going to do by
publishing articles that say, "Yes. everything vou
always kney* is still correct. They are going to sell
paper> bv saving You were wrong! Salt in the diet
is not harmtul," to quote Butchko's example It's
analogous to the National Enquirer running a
headline such as Cher Married Irish Setter"
rather than "Valerie Bertinelli kisses Husband
Butchko claims that the world today is domi
nated bv "laws that simpK cannot be understood
unless the\ absolutely have to {Any chemical or
physical principle except entropy). . . This
statement either reflects Butchko's extreme ob
tuseness or his utter unwillingess to learn. I sus
pect it's the latter. though. because he was after all
admitted to Stanford University, the cutting edge
of undergraduate education.

Is the principle that heat flows spontaneously
from hot to cold objects so hard to understand?
Does it require that large a leap of faith to believe
that bodies in motion tend to remain in motion in a
straight line unless acted upon by an external
force? Does it strain credulity all that much to
believe that the acceleration of a body is propor
tional to the force applied? It seems very fashiona
ble these days to brag about one's ignorance, but I
think Chris Butchko has taken this trend a bit too
far.
Regarding the "Law of Averages" and Butchko's
glorification of common sense, what Butchko calls
the "Law of Averages" is completely wrong. To use
his example of a 21 game, when you have 20 after
having received five consecutive aces, the Law of
Averages (as Butchko defines it) says, "Don't take
another card because you just got five aces in a
row and weird things' like that don't keep hap
pening." On the other hand, anyone who under
stood high school algebra would see that the cor
rect interpretation of the situation is: "Don't take
another card. It doesn't matter that you just got
five aces in a row. All that matters are the cards
remaining in the deck, and the chances are only
about 1 in 13 that the next one is an ace." In this
situation, the "Law" of Averages comes up with
the right decision, but for the wrong reason.
To take another example, suppose you are tos
sing an unbiased coin and it lands heads 50 times
in a row. You toss it once more. What will the
outcome be? "Probably tails," says the simpleton
who believes in the Law of Averages.
"Wrong. It's just as likely to be heads or tails,"
the knowledgeable observer says, knowing that if
the Law of Averages were true, the coin would
have to somehow "Know"and be biased by the
fact that it came up heads in the 50 previous
throws, which of course is absurd.

I can just imagine Galileo coming
before Pope Butchko with his
discovery that a small stone,
when dropped, falls every bit as
fast as a large one.'BahV Butchko
would say. 'This is obviously
wrong, for Common Sense tells
us that the large stone must fall
faster. Put this fool on the rack
until he repentsV

Butchko presents no evidence for the beliefs
espoused in his article. He just "knows" that
they're true and in accord with common sense.
This attitude is somewhat similar to that of the
medieval Catholic Church. I can just picture
Galileo coming before Pope Butchko with his dis
covers that a small stone, when dropped, falls
every bit as fast as a large one.
"Bah!" Butchko would sav. "this is obviouslv
wrong, for Common Sense tells us that the large
stone must fall faster. Put this fool on the rack until
he repents !"
In conclusion, I think Butchko should take heed
of one of mv favorites of Murphy's Laws: "Com
mon sense isn't."

It seems very fashionable these
days to brag about one's ignor
ance,, but I think Chris Butchko
has taken this trend a bit too far.

On a similar note. Butchko states that as of the
1930s nothing really great remained to be done in
science. But bv his examples of not-so-great
achievements (Tang and teflon), he demonstrates
that yyhen he savs "science." he clearly means
"technology." and that a "great" discovery is one
that has a significant effect of Chris Butchko's life.
E\en working within his use of the term "science. "

\ good deal ot Butchko's impression of the sci

like to make two points.
First, it is generally considered socially unac
ceptable by the scientific community for a scientist
to present his research results via the popular
press rather than via the scholarly journals. For this
reason, what vou read in the newspaper about
science does not. in general, reflect the attitudes
of the scientific mainstream.
Second, the goal of a newspaper's owners is to
sell papers, which they are not going to do by
publishing articles that say, "Yes. everything vou
always kney* is still correct. They are going to sell
paper> bv saving You were wrong! Salt in the diet
is not harmtul," to quote Butchko's example It's

rather than "Valerie Bertinelli kisses Husband

Is the principle that heat flows spontaneously
from hot to cold objects so hard to understand?
Does it require that large a leap of faith to believe
that bodies in motion tend to remain in motion in a
straight line unless acted upon by an external
force? Does it strain credulity all that much to
believe that the acceleration of a body is propor
tional to the force applied? It seems very fashiona
ble these days to brag about one's ignorance, but I
think Chris Butchko has taken this trend a bit too
far.
Regarding the "Law of Averages" and Butchko's
glorification of common sense, what Butchko calls
the "Law of Averages" is completely wrong. To use
his example of a 21 game, when you have 20 after
having received five consecutive aces, the Law of
Averages (as Butchko defines it) says, "Don't take
another card because you just got five aces in a
row and weird things' like that don't keep hap
pening." On the other hand, anyone who under
stood high school algebra would see that the cor
rect interpretation of the situation is: "Don't take
another card. It doesn't matter that you just got
five aces in a row. All that matters are the cards
remaining in the deck, and the chances are only
about 1 in 13 that the next one is an ace." In this
situation, the "Law" of Averages comes up with
the right decision, but for the wrong reason.
To take another example, suppose you are tos
sing an unbiased coin and it lands heads 50 times
in a row. You toss it once more. What will the
outcome be? "Probably tails," says the simpleton
who believes in the Law of Averages.
"Wrong. It's just as likely to be heads or tails,"
the knowledgeable observer says, knowing that if
the Law of Averages were true, the coin would
have to somehow "Know"and be biased by the
fact that it came up heads in the 50 previous
throws, which of course is absurd.

I can just imagine Galileo coming
before Pope Butchko with his
discovery that a small stone,
when dropped, falls every bit as
fast as a large one.'BahV Butchko

faster. Put this fool on the rack
until he repentsV

Butchko presents no evidence for the beliefs
espoused in his article. He just "knows" that
they're true and in accord with common sense.
This attitude is somewhat similar to that of the
medieval Catholic Church. I can just picture
Galileo coming before Pope Butchko with his dis
covers that a small stone, when dropped, falls
every bit as fast as a large one.
"Bah!" Butchko would sav. "this is obviouslv
wrong, for Common Sense tells us that the large
stone must fall faster. Put this fool on the rack until
he repents !"
In conclusion, I think Butchko should take heed
of one of mv favorites of Murphy's Laws: "Com
mon sense isn't."

Chris Butchko's opinion piece of July 8 is one of
the most reactionary, anti-intellectual articles I
have seen in the Daily in quite some time. He is
guilty of the very thing he accuses the scientific
community of—obstinately and dogmatically
clinging to that which is wrong.
First of all, throughout his article, he uses the
term "science' when he seems to mean "technol
ogy." He says that from the '20s through the '50s,
"Science was roaring along, changing the world,
improving our lives, ruining the environ
ment,. . . " Science ("knowledge, as of general
