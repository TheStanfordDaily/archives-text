I could go on with this debate
with Dean Caughey, (Daily, July
12) but would it be sporting?
What marksman hones his skill
by taking aim at a tangled thicket
that has no moving game on
which to draw a bead? Try as I
might, I just can't get a fix on the
Dean's meaning in most of what
he writes.
Consider this sentence, one
of many examples I could
choose from: "Third, the rejec
tion of what I hope even Har
wood can recognize as idealog
ical nonsense' in Naziism is not
difficult to anyone who does not
want to believe it."
There's no connection what
soever between this sentence
and what I wrote in my June 24th
Daily essay. The "ideological
nonsense" I was referring to was
the claim made by the extreme
Left, which many liberals found
plausible, that America was not
much different from Nazi Ger
many. While I agree that Naziism
is nonsense, that isn't what I
said. But aside from that, Dean
Caughey's sentence doesn't
make any sense as it's con
structed.
What does the Dean mean
when he writes in the last para
graph that he wants "truth and
justice" to be his judge, and not
just his opponent? How is this
' truth and justice'' to
materialize? Who will fetch it for
us so that the validity of the
Dean's arguments can be cer
tified?
He states that he "protests"
the "academic relativism which
allows fundable ideologies
equal time with critical
thought." I hope he doesn't
mean by this that it was wrong of
the Daily to give me space to
answer his criticisms of Hoover.
But then what does he mean?
Does he mean that publishing
houses should print more radi
cal critiques of our society de
spite the exhaustion of that fash
ion over the past decade? Or
more of those guiltist homilies
written by aggrieved
sociologists, philosophers who
have lost interest in their
academic portfolios and theolo
gians trying to revive a flagging
market for traditional religion by

borrowing the vestments of the
Marxist faith to curry favor with
young people whose devotions
might otherwise become the
exclusive property of the
secular Left?
I greet with incredulity his
claim that the predicament Po
land and Afghanistan now find
themselves in is due to Cold War
tension' that we haven't been
doing enough to reduce and I
doubt very much that this is the
way the Afghani and Polish
peoples want their aspirations
for freedom to be supported b\
Dean Caughey or others in the
West.
By way of rebuttal, I would
argue that the predicament that
Afghanistan and some other
countries, including El Sal
vador, finds themselves in is
due in large measure to a grow
ing Soviet adventurism that has
been nourished by the one
sided and deceptive detente of
the 19705. This allowed the USSR
to steal the march on the west
ern democracies in terms of
military expenditures. But even
more crucial, the USSR was en
couraged to exploit this "de
tente" because of the failure of
nerve among the political and
other leadership elites of the
West. This failure of nerve, in
turn, was occasioned by the loss
of faith among our educated
strata in their own political sys
tems and societies. And sadly,
the American university proved
to be an exceptionally good host
to this malignant self-flagellation
which metasasized to large
segments of the press, to the re
ligious orders and now to
numerous other precincts.
Debate is clearly needed at
Stanford and other universities
where many on the left have be
come so convinced that they
have a monopoly on the well
spring of "truth and justice" that
they've failed to observe how
the buckets that transport the
sacral waters of their doctrine to
the faithful have rusted out at
the bottom. Dean Caughey's
commentary convinced me
more than ever that there's a job
to be done.
