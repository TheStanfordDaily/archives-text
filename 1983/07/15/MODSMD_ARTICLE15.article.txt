## South African progressive blasts Reagan's apartheid stance 
### ALAN TRIPP 
"The Reagan policy of con
structive engagement is the
worst choice the American gov
ernment can make," said a visit
ing white leader of the South Af
rican Progressive Federal Party
(PFP) yesterday in a Daily inter
view.
Jan Van Eck, editor of the PFP
journal Deurbrak (Break
through), said Reagan's policy is
driving South African blacks to
communism because they see
"no hope from the West."
"The reality is the percep
tion," he said, "and the percep
tion is that Reagan is a man who
is soft on apartheid."
While Van Eck also criticized
former President Jimmy Carter
for his "constant and ineffective
verbal attacks," he said Reagan's
policy is seen as tacit approval of
apartheid by South African
whites, resulting in a virtual
elimination of what was pres
sure for change.
Van Eck said the current gov
ernment underthe leadership of
Prime Minister Peter Botha and
the pro-apartheid National Party

has succeeded in fooling many
Americans into thinking that
progressive change is taking
place. "I've been astonished
that so many people I've met be
lieve that there's actual reform
taking place in South Africa."
Van Eck referred to "so-called
constitutional reform" which he
said further legitimizes apar
theid. "This is not liberalization
at all," he said.

According to Van Eck, the
constitutional changes create
two relatively powerless legisla
tive bodies in addition to the par
liament, one for South Africans
of Indian descent, the other for
those of mixed race.
No blacks are considered citi
zens of South Africa but are as
signed to various "homelands"
according to tribal identity. The
homelands are governed by
puppet governments, recog
nized only by South Africa.
"At the moment we can ques
tion the policies of apartheid —
geographical separation, segre
gated areas and the like," he
said. "But with these constitu
tional reforms, apartheid has to
be maintained or the constitu
tion will be unworkable. It's a
devious ploy to appease the
West while constitutionalizing
the Nats' (National Party mem
bers') policies."
Van Eck's own party, the PFP,
which holds 27 of the 170 seats in
Parliament, proposes an entirely
new constitution, similar to the
American constitution, with


Jan Van Eck
provisions for majoritarian gov
ernment, "plenty of checks and
balances, and a bill of rights."
"There is only one way to pre
vent disaster — create a new
constitution which is a product
of the people —all people who
call themselves South Africans,"
he said.

Van Eck said the role of the PFP
was that of a "pressure force,"
for the moment. "Although it's
hard to imagine, things would
be much worse for the blacks if
there wasn't an opposition party
in parliament.
"Before we can progress,
we've got to get rid of the gov
ernment," Van Eck said.
But this is no small task, he
said. The PFP is virtually pre
cluded from the state-owned

television network and selec
tively quoted in the press. More
than 50 percent of left-leaning
college newspapers have been
"banned," or shut down.
"Educating the voters is the
key," he said. "That way the
government has to move along
or lose the voters."
Van Eck said he would not give
up on his work for peaceful
, change. "I will continue to oper

ate in the present structure for as
long as they allow us to do so
freely," he said.
"I don't think that we as a
party will have a chance of get
ting in power in the time availa
ble to us," he said.
To the question of what he
would do when the "time avail

able to the party" runs out, Van
Eck replied, "If you were totally
logical about it, you would get
out. But I won't. Ithinkthatwhat
is right will eventually triumph.
"What keeps you in South Af
rica is hope that sanity will pre
vail but one can only hope," he
said.

provisions for majoritarian gov
ernment, "plenty of checks and
balances, and a bill of rights."
"There is only one way to pre
vent disaster — create a new
constitution which is a product
of the people —all people who
call themselves South Africans,"
he said.

Van Eck said the role of the PFP
was that of a "pressure force,"
for the moment. "Although it's
hard to imagine, things would
be much worse for the blacks if
there wasn't an opposition party
in parliament.
"Before we can progress,
we've got to get rid of the gov
ernment," Van Eck said.
But this is no small task, he
said. The PFP is virtually pre
cluded from the state-owned

television network and selec
tively quoted in the press. More
than 50 percent of left-leaning
college newspapers have been
"banned," or shut down.
"Educating the voters is the
key," he said. "That way the
government has to move along
or lose the voters."
Van Eck said he would not give
up on his work for peaceful
, change. "I will continue to oper

ate in the present structure for as
long as they allow us to do so
freely," he said.
"I don't think that we as a
party will have a chance of get
ting in power in the time availa
ble to us," he said.
To the question of what he
would do when the "time avail

able to the party" runs out, Van
Eck replied, "If you were totally
logical about it, you would get
out. But I won't. Ithinkthatwhat
is right will eventually triumph.
"What keeps you in South Af
rica is hope that sanity will pre
vail but one can only hope," he
said.
