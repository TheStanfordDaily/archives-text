# Research here dispels Titan ocean theory

Stanford researchers studying atmos
pheric conditions on Titan have disco
vered surging waves of gas called internal
gravity waves in the upper atmosphere
but no evidence to support the theory
that vast methane oceans exist on the
Saturnian satellite.
A research team at the Space, Tele
communications and Radioscience
Laboratory at Stanford was chosen by
NASA to receive the funding and oppor
tunity to analyze the data collected by
Voyager I in its encounter with Saturn and
Titan in November 1980. This data was
acquired through radio occultation ex
periments in which Voyager flew behind
Titan so that radio waves sent to Earth
passed through its atmosphere before
being blocked out.
The ensuing signal fluctuations in the
radio waves received on Earth allowed
researchers to measure variations in
temperature and atmospheric pressure
and to gather information on the compo
nents of Titan's atmosphere.
Scientists were especially eager to
study Titan as it is the only moon in the
solar system with an atmosphere. It is
Saturn's largest satellite.
One such study, published in the May
issue of Icarus and dealing with Titan's
atmospheric structure, originated from a
doctoral dissertation by graduate student

David Hinson and work by his advisor, G.
Leonard Tyler, research professor of elec
trical engineering at the lab.
Prior observation had shown Titan's
atmosphere to be very uniform and un
structured. However, irregularities in
radio reception from Voyager indicated
that an internal structure in the atmos
phere did exist above 25 kilometers, or
82,000 feet.
According to Hinson, "The signal fluc
tuations were surprising as no one had
predicted them. But the big question was
what we could learn from them about the
atmosphere."
Data from Voyager revealed that inter
nal gravity waves similar to ocean waves
had caused the fluctuations. Hinson's
colleague Von Eshleman, professor of
electrical engineering at the lab, who is
studying Titan's atmospheric con
stituents, described the waves as "cur
rents of air slowly undulating in the at
mosphere oscillating about 100 meters in
ten minutes."
The waves are analagous to ocean
waves in that they have either a local or
distant source.
If you are in a boat on the water in a
storm, the wind tosses the boat and you
around so the source of the turbulence is
local" Eshleman explained. "Now sup
pose on a calm day at sea, the ocean
waves still toss you about. The source of

the waves is distant, not local."
Voyager was not able to provide infor
mation as to the source of the gravity
waves, but Hinson and Tyler speculate
that they originate locally near the
moon's surface. They suggest the upward
momentum of the gravity waves main
tains the layering of the upper atmos
phere. Further research is necessary to
determine the exact effects of the gravity
waves on the Titanian environment.
In another study currently appearing in
Science, Professors Eshleman, Tyler and
Gunnar Lindal at Jet Propulsion
Laboratories in Pasadena analyzed Titan's
atmospheric components with data from
the radio occultation experiments.
Titan's atmosphere, like Earth's, con
sists mainly of nitrogen, although Titan's
is more dense. They both differ funda
mentally from most other planets, which
have carbon dioxide based atmospheres.
Titan and Earth are thus considered in
an "oddball group" according to Eshle
man. "They are two bodies with similar
characteristics, the temperature being
the major difference."
What Voyager data revealed to the re
searchers was that the methane humidity
level in the atmosphere was lower than
expected, less than 1.3 percent, according
to Eshleman.
Scientists had speculated that the nit
rogen clouds covering Titan took on the

characteristics of water clouds on Earth
by producing methane rain and eventu
ally forming methane oceans. However
insufficient amounts of methane, a hyd
rocarbon formed by the combination of
carbon and nitrogen, eliminated the pos
sibility of oceans existing.
Furthermore, had there been oceans on
Titan, evaporation of methane would
have resulted in cumulus clouds forming
over the surface. This convection would
have produced temperature changes but
as Eshleman explained, "Titan's tempera
ture varies less than two tenths of a de
gree. There has never been any direct
evidence that there were any oceans, and
now we know the possiblity of sailing
Titanic oceans doesn't exist." Titan's sur
face consists mainly of water ice.
Titan is intriguing to scientists because
of the parallels between the chemical
constituents of its atmosphere and
earth's. In addition to methane, Voyager
also detected traces of more complex or
ganic molecules in Titan's atmosphere
formed by solar radiation.
Since methane is one of the family of
hydrocarbons believed to be necessary
for the origin of life on Earth, scientists
believe Titan possesses a similar
evolutionary pattern which has been ar
rested by the freezing temperatures of
the outer solar system.
