## Local firm's synthetic growth hormone could make the difference 
### PHYLLIS BURTON 
The science of bioengineering
has produced yet another ad
vance in treating medical prob
lems with the introduction of a
synthetic human growth hor
mone produced by Genentech
Inc. of South San Francisco.
The hormone is now being
used in studies in 10 medical
centers around the country, in
cluding Stanford, to treat a con
dition known as hypopituitary
dwarfism. This condition affects
an estimated 10,000 to 15,000
children in this country, and is
caused by a failure of the pituit
ary gland, at the base of the
brain, to produce the hormone
that triggers growth and sexual
maturity.
Genentech's new synthetic
growth hormone is produced by
the recombinant, or "gene
splicing" method. Elliot
Grossbard, associate director of
clinical research at Genentech
and a clinical assistant professor
of medicine in the department
of hematology at Stanford Hos
pital, explained that the hor
mone is manufactured by taking
the part of the gene that is desir
able and fusing it to bacteria,
who then reproduce, creating
large amounts of the desired
substance.
"This process can be used for
many purposes," he said. "It has
been used to create a recombin
ant version of insulin, which is
already on the market. This new
growth hormone, now still in the
testing stages, should be ap
proved by the Food and Drug
Administration for general use
after this year."
The original clinical trials of
the growth hormone were done
here at Stanford beginning two
years ago. The trials used 10
normal adult volunteers to as
certain the safety and metabolic

effects of the hormone, before
giving it to children, according
to Ron Rosenfeld assistant pro
fessor of pediatrics, one of the
two physicians who carried out
the study.
"In this initial trial," Rosenfeld
said, "Half of the patients were
given the synthetic growth hor
mone, and half were given
natural human growth hor
mone, in a double-blind, cross
over study. The two proved to be
identical in effects and equally
safe."
Natural human growth hor
mone has been available since
1958. It is extracted from the
pituitary glands of cadavers. It is
quite scarce, and if not supplied
to the patient by the National
Hormone and Pituitary Program,
must be obtained from the only
other source, two European
Pharmaceutical companies, at a
cost of $10,000 to $20,000 per
year.
Clinical trials using children
with hypopituitary dwarfism
began about 18 months ago. The
study at Stanford includes six
children. Dr. Rosenfeld said that
the hormone has proved to be
"highly efficacious and safe."
Oneofthechildren participat
ing in the study here is nine
year-old Gerald Flaggs of Palo
Alto, Gerald has grown seven in
ches and gained 10 pounds since
he began receiving the hormone
in December of 1981.
"It has affected our lives tre
mendously," said Marsha
Flaggs, Gerald's mother.
"Gerald is like a totally new kid.
He has much more confidence
in himself and even his motor
skills have noticeably im
proved."
"It has been like watching a
flower bloom."
Mrs. Flaggs said that Gerald
had the mental development,

but not the physical develop
ment to live appropriately for his
age until he started growing.
"He couldn't even reach door
bells," she said, "so he always
had to take his older brother
with him to ring the bell when he
wanted to see if his friends could
come out to play."
Gerald's chore around the
house is to unload the dish
washer, according to Mrs.
Flaggs.
"He used to just sort of drop
the silverware into the drawer,
in approximately the right place,
because he couldn't see into it.
Now that he sees where the sil
verware is going, he is very par
ticular that everyone keeps it in
order."
Mrs. Flaggs, said that it was
hard not to treat Gerald like a
baby, due to his size, and that

the family had always tried to
make things "age-appropriate,
rather than size-appropriate."
The psychological effects of
dwarfism can take a heavy emo
tional toll.

"People generally have three
kinds of reactions to a condition
such as this," according to H.

Cordon Blount, an assistant pro
fessor of psychology at Chap
man College, who also treats
children and adults for the
County of San Mateo. "People
either attack the handicap, they

ignore it, or they patronize it."
"They use euphemisms such
as 'special' or 'exceptional,'" he
said, "but the child usually
doesn't feel special, and would
much rather just be anonymous
and blend in."
While alleviating physical and
emotional problems, there are
worries that social and ethical
ones will surface in their place.
Rosenfeld sees the potential for
pressure by certain groups
within society to demand the
hormone be given for purposes
other than those intended,such
as to children who are not

dwarfs, but are of short stature,
or normal children whose pa
rents want them to be taller.
"It is not clear who will set the
criteria for the use of synthetic
human growth hormone," he
said. "National medical commit
tees have been set up to make
recommendations to deal with
the anticipated problems."
There appears to be a full fu
ture for Genentech in this area
of research. This summer re
searchers will begin testing the
drug on normal short children,
and in the fall will test it for use
with burn victims, arthritis pa
tients, and cachexia, a wasting
disease.
