# Stanford salaries: still among nation's highest
## 
### KRISHNA WEST 
Stanford faculty salaries rank
amongst the highest paid in any
academic institution in the na
tion, according to surveys by the
American Association of Univer
sity Professors (AAUP) and the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT).
According to the AAUP's an
nual report on the economic
status of the profession for
1982-83, Stanford faculty of all
ranks average $52,000 a year in
total compensation (salary plus
fringe benefits).
Professors here earn an aver
age salary of $51,200; associate
professors average $35,800; and
assistant professors average
$29,700, the AAUP report stated.
Fringe benefits amount to ap
proximately 22 percent of the
salaries.
In the AAUP report, these fi
gures place Stanford second
only to the California Institute of

Technology (Cal Tech). Average
total compensation for all ranks
was listed at $53,300 for the
southern California university.
Harvard and MIT placed third
with an all-rank average total
compensation of $49,900 a year.
In the overall ranking by uni
versity section of MlT's 1982-83
Faculty Salary Survey, Stanford
full professors, earning the an
nual mean salary of $50,562, and
associate professors without te
nure ($37,064) and assistant pro
fessors ($28,102) ranked second
in their categories nationwide.
The AAUP report, published
in the july-August 1983 issue of
Academe, included statistics on
40 doctoral-level institutions.
According to that report, Har
vard professors earned $2300
more than those at Stanford, Cal
Tech's associate professors
earned $1100 more than Stan
ford's. However, Stanford's as
sistant professors earned the

most in the nation within their
category in terms of average
total faculty compensation.
The MIT survey also ranked
faculty salaries according to dif
ferent schools within the institu
tions. In the school of engineer
ing, Stanford salaries again
ranked first and second, ranging
from $31,663 for assistant pro
fessors to $50,976 for professors.
Salaries in the school of science
ranked second and third, rang
ing from $26,494 for assistant
professors to $50,126f0r full pro
fessors. Under the Humanities
and Social Sciences section,
salaries ranked second and
fourth and ranged from $25,427
to $48,725. For the school of
management, Stanford salaries
ranked first and second once
more, ranging from $34,621 to
$59,590.
Members of Stanford's faculty
said that these figures are accu
rate.
Anthropology Prof. Clifford
Barnett, president of the AAUP
Stanford Chapter, said that Stan
ford is "top-rated for compensa
tion." Prof. David Danelski, the
chapter's vice president, agreed
that "Stanford salaries are
somewhat higher than compar
able schools'."

Prof. Daniel Bershader, as
sociate chairman of Aeronautics
and Astronautics, declared Stan
ford to be in the "top group as
far as salaries are concerned."
According to Stanford Asst.
Provost Noel Kolak, compari
sons such as MlT's and the
AAUP's play an important role in
determining salaries.
"Ranking with other schools
and universities is one of the
primary factors determining the
rate of increase in faculty
salaries," Kolak said. "Stanford
schools do very well compared
to others, but it's hard to speak
for the University as a whole."
Medical Microbiology Prof.
Leon Rosenberg, a member of
the AAUP's executive commit
tee, said that Stanford's high
salaries are a tool to attract top
professors in a competitive
academic marketplace.
"Market considerations do
determine our salaries," Rosen
berg said. "One would find it
difficult to attract (people with)
Ph.Ds to medical school if the
salary were only equivalent to
humanities and social sciences
positions."
Earnings from consulting jobs
and summer programs are often
significant supplements to an

nual salary, Bershader said.
Barnett pointed out that, al
though faculty salaries have not
been properly adjusted for infla
tion, "over that last couple of
years, they've made up for a lot
of lost ground." Danelski
blamed this discrepancy on
California's high cost of living.
Starting salaries for new assis
tant professsors are also lower
than those offered in industrial
occupations, "causing some
problems in getting people at
the lower levels," Bershader
said.
"Historically, management
positions are more lucrative
than scientific ones in indus
tries. Young persons, scientifi
cally trained, can easily take
such jobs," Rosenberg said.
The opportunities for re
search and experimentation,
teaching and interacting with
students, job security and the
freedom of the academic at
mosphere are the ties that bind
many faculty members to the
University.
"I like keeping in touch with
enthused, interested young
people, getting their feedback
and learningfrom them" Barnett
said.

Stanford faculty salaries rank
amongst the highest paid in any
academic institution in the na
tion, according to surveys by the
American Association of Univer
sity Professors (AAUP) and the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT).
According to the AAUP's an
nual report on the economic
status of the profession for
1982-83, Stanford faculty of all
ranks average $52,000 a year in
total compensation (salary plus
fringe benefits).
Professors here earn an aver
age salary of $51,200; associate
professors average $35,800; and
assistant professors average
$29,700, the AAUP report stated.
Fringe benefits amount to ap
proximately 22 percent of the
salaries.
In the AAUP report, these fi
gures place Stanford second
only to the California Institute of

Technology (Cal Tech). Average
total compensation for all ranks
was listed at $53,300 for the
southern California university.
Harvard and MIT placed third
with an all-rank average total
compensation of $49,900 a year.
In the overall ranking by uni
versity section of MlT's 1982-83
Faculty Salary Survey, Stanford
full professors, earning the an
nual mean salary of $50,562, and
associate professors without te
nure ($37,064) and assistant pro
fessors ($28,102) ranked second
in their categories nationwide.
The AAUP report, published
in the july-August 1983 issue of
Academe, included statistics on
40 doctoral-level institutions.
According to that report, Har
vard professors earned $2300
more than those at Stanford, Cal
Tech's associate professors
earned $1100 more than Stan
ford's. However, Stanford's as
sistant professors earned the

most in the nation within their
category in terms of average
total faculty compensation.
The MIT survey also ranked
faculty salaries according to dif
ferent schools within the institu
tions. In the school of engineer
ing, Stanford salaries again
ranked first and second, ranging
from $31,663 for assistant pro
fessors to $50,976 for professors.
Salaries in the school of science
ranked second and third, rang
ing from $26,494 for assistant
professors to $50,126f0r full pro
fessors. Under the Humanities
and Social Sciences section,
salaries ranked second and
fourth and ranged from $25,427
to $48,725. For the school of
management, Stanford salaries
ranked first and second once
more, ranging from $34,621 to
$59,590.
Members of Stanford's faculty
said that these figures are accu
rate.
Anthropology Prof. Clifford
Barnett, president of the AAUP
Stanford Chapter, said that Stan
ford is "top-rated for compensa
tion." Prof. David Danelski, the
chapter's vice president, agreed
that "Stanford salaries are
somewhat higher than compar
able schools'."

Prof. Daniel Bershader, as
sociate chairman of Aeronautics
and Astronautics, declared Stan
ford to be in the "top group as
far as salaries are concerned."
According to Stanford Asst.
Provost Noel Kolak, compari
sons such as MlT's and the
AAUP's play an important role in
determining salaries.
"Ranking with other schools
and universities is one of the
primary factors determining the
rate of increase in faculty
salaries," Kolak said. "Stanford
schools do very well compared
to others, but it's hard to speak
for the University as a whole."
Medical Microbiology Prof.
Leon Rosenberg, a member of
the AAUP's executive commit
tee, said that Stanford's high
salaries are a tool to attract top
professors in a competitive
academic marketplace.
"Market considerations do
determine our salaries," Rosen
berg said. "One would find it
difficult to attract (people with)
Ph.Ds to medical school if the
salary were only equivalent to
humanities and social sciences
positions."
Earnings from consulting jobs
and summer programs are often
significant supplements to an

nual salary, Bershader said.
Barnett pointed out that, al
though faculty salaries have not
been properly adjusted for infla
tion, "over that last couple of
years, they've made up for a lot
of lost ground." Danelski
blamed this discrepancy on
California's high cost of living.
Starting salaries for new assis
tant professsors are also lower
than those offered in industrial
occupations, "causing some
problems in getting people at
the lower levels," Bershader
said.
"Historically, management
positions are more lucrative
than scientific ones in indus
tries. Young persons, scientifi
cally trained, can easily take
such jobs," Rosenberg said.
The opportunities for re
search and experimentation,
teaching and interacting with
students, job security and the
freedom of the academic at
mosphere are the ties that bind
many faculty members to the
University.
"I like keeping in touch with
enthused, interested young
people, getting their feedback
and learningfrom them" Barnett
said.
