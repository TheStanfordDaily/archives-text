# University may give up on Stanford West project
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
University officials say that additional restric
tions placed on the Stanford West housing project
by the Palo Alto City Council have caused them to
consider dropping the project.
Even though the University has already $'1.7 mill
ion on Stanford West, administrators here are un
happy with what they call the "extra
jurisdictional" attempts by the council to regulate
Stanford lands.
Although Monday night the council passed the
Environmental Impact Report for the 1100-unit de
velopment that the University wants to build on
Willow Road, the council added mitigations that
the University could find unacceptable.
University administrators will formally reply to
the council in a few weeks. According to Andy
Doty, director of community relations, the Uni
versity could accept the council's mitigations, or
accept some and reject others, or even withdraw

the project "in view of the principle involved."
Doty said the University disputes the council's
right to regulate lands outside its jurisdiction.
"It's not that we're being uptight over a minor
point," Doty said. "The city wants to set up some
concrete regulations on county lands outside the
city."
This action is a "precedent that we don't want to
set," Doty said.
Among the mitigations that the council added
are that the University:
• leave a buffer averaging 150 ft. wide along the
southeast side of Willow Road.
• prohibit automobile access from Pasteur Road
to San Francisquito Creek to the southeast side of
Willow Road.
• use lands bounded by Pasteur Road, Campus
Drive, the golf course and Willow Road only for
academic and support services.
• establish a playing field on the site.
Doty said the University recognizes that the
council was under pressure from residents from
Menlo Park and Palo Alto who protested the pro
ject's size, potential traffic problems and destruc
tion of open space.
"We all appreciate that the city council tried to
strike a middle ground," he said.
But still Doty said the council seems to be in
volved in a "test of wills" with the University.

"The city knew in advance that we could not
accept the conditions," yet they adopted those
conditions anyway, Doty said.
Doty emphasized that Stanford does not have to
accept the council's mitigations.
Stanford is not a temporary developer — here
today and gone tomorrow," he said. The Univer
sity can "put the blueprints on the shelf" for a few
years.
Doty insisted that the University's threat to end
the project is not a bluff to win concessions from
the council.
"We can't waste our credibility in that fashion,"
he said.
