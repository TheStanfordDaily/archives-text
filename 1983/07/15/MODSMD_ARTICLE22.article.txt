# Heat Wave

Where did the Stanford Community go to cool off from this week's
heat wave? They naturally went to Lake Lag, but finding the water a
little shallow (left), they moved to Mem Hoop (far left) where there
was water, but not much deeper. Next they went to Roble Pool
(above), lots of water if you like to swim laps. Finally, DeGuerre Pool
(right) provided cool relief with proper entertainment as well.
