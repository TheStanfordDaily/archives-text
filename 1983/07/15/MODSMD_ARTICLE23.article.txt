## A
						'Torch Song' that's worth an ovation 
### MARC FAJER 
Normally when I am present in the midst of a standing
ovation, I am afraid to say I am one of the last to rise,
often looking nervously about to make sure absolutely
everyone else is up. Especially since I started reviewing,
there is a level that I expect from a standing ovation show
that is a bit higher, I guess, than many people's. Last
Wednesday at the Theatre on the Square, at the opening
of the latest Tony award winner for best play, Torch Song
Trilogy, I stood without reservations. The play was not
perfect, but so much was so good and witty and sensitive
that for once I did not feel that I was being forced to
worship someone else's God.
Torch Song is about a drag queen named Arnold Bec
koff who is sensitive, witty, though, as he complains,
"aging like a beach party movie," The play consists of
three acts, different in style and substance, that trace
Arnold (Donald Corren) and his relationship with a
good-looking, contused bisexual named Ed (Brian Ker
win).
Part 1, called "The International Stud," consists of
four stylized vignettes in which the two men are never
near each other, intertwined with blues numbers (sung
richly by Meg Mackay) and capped off with a confronta
tion between the two men. First we see Arnold
backstage at his nightclub, preparing to go on stage as
Virginia Hamm.
Corren is charming and funny as he explains the good
and bad points of his existence. He is, of course, as
campy as the role demands, but brings a lot of depth to
the part. The second scene is the night Ed picks up
Arnold. We only see Ed. At first, the lines were so typical,
and Eu so good looking, that I assumed the scene was
taking place in Arnold's mind, yet as later scenes reveal,
it was intended as a real part of the plot. It is very funny
(singles bars are basically the same regardless of clien
tele) to see standard lines being directed from the pret
tier of the couple to the other, but it works pretty well.
Next we see Arnold and Ed on the phone. They have
been lovers for a while, and Arnold is in love. Ed is at
home, waiting for a woman to arrive. Arnold is becom
ing a possessive nudge. Again, the scene is somewhat

familiar, but well-written and acted, even though the
gender is not quite what it usually is.
The relationship breaks off, and Arnold follows a
friend into the back room of a bar for easy faceless sex.
This is a hysterical sequence. We only see Arnold as he
attempts to have a conversation and get to know the man
who is screwing him in the dark. His desperate tries to
get affection from a purely physical situation are both
humorous a poignant. Finally, after time passes, Ed
comes looking for Arnold again. Coincidentally, his pa
rents have just left New York for the winter. Arnold
fights with himself, knowing it will be trouble, but in the
end goes off with him.

Torch Song is about a drag queen
named Arnold Beckhoff who is sensa
tive, witty, though, as he complains,
'aging like a beach party movie/ The
play consists of three acts, different in
style and substance, that trace Arnold
and his relationship with a good
looking, confused bisexual named Ed.

For part two, Bill Stabile's neat high-tech set disappears
and is replaced by a mattress taking up tht whole stage.
"Fugue in a Nursery" is a brilliant piece of writing. Au
thor Harvey Fierstein has created a carefully interwoven
fabric of the shared tenderness and exposed nerves that
make up relationships. Ed is now living with the girl he
was dating before, Laurel (Meg MacKay). He decides to
invite Arnold up to their farm to sort things out. Arnold
brings his new lover, Alan, (Marc Poppel), who is a
model doing ail-American boy roles in commercials.
What we see are a series of two-person conversations, in
which the same lines are used by different people over
and over. It becomes clear that each relationship, and
each person, is made up of parts of each of the others.

The acting is superb in this scene. Poppel as Alan is
especially charming and lovable, alternating between
boyishness, and the cynicism of someone who has seen
most everything. MacKay is charming as the girl who
continually finds herself involved with bisexual men and
tries very hard to be philosophical about it.
Kerwin as Ed is at his best in this scene, whether
bossing Laurel, being comforted by Arnold or making a
pass at Alan. He has a few weak moments here, as
elsewhere in the showâ€”he is never quite interesting
enough for us to believe that Arnold loves him, yet on
occasion and especially in this act, there is something
strangely appealing about him in a puppy dog sort of
way, and so the show holds together.
Part 3, "Widows and Children First," concerns the
dual problems Arnold faces in his soon to be adopted
son David, and his visiting mother. If this sounds sus
piciously sit-com, that is the way much of it plays. This is
the weakest part of the show, as Sylvia Kauders whips
out every old stereotype in the book playing the Jewish
mother. Christopher Collett as 15-year-old David is
good, though hampered by some typically bad l
am-a-street-kid-living-with-middle-class-people lines.
(Does anyone really know how street kids sound?) Ed is
back again, separated from Laurel (whom he has mar
ried), and thinking of giving Arnold another go.
The reason the scenes ultimately hold together, de
spite the sit-com, is that the characters refuse to slip into
one-dimensionality despite their flurries of one-liners.
Arnold is in a lot of pain; after several years with him
Alan has been killed. He and his widowed mother are
fighting over Arnold's sexuality, the right way to bring up
a child, and the relative importance of Alan and Arnold's
father. The pain and bitterness that they both display is
clearly a product of similarities between them, and the
play's ending, bringingthisout, is painful and touching.
Overall, the writing and Corren's superb performance
make this a terrific production. The entirety reveals a
complex character caught in traps made both by himself
and society who manages to cope. The great strength
and sensitivity of Arnold and of Harvey Fierstein pull the
show beyond its weaknesses to a performance worth its
ovation.
