# Not quite what it should be
## 
### MARC FAJER 
Last December, I was lucky
enough to see Tommy Tune's
off-Broadway production of
Caryl Churchill's play, Cloud 9.
The play is a startling examina
tion of sexuality and imperialism
that features men playing wo
men, women playing men,
adults playing children, a white
man playing a black man, and a
bewildering assortment of sex
ual connections, both straight
and gay. The New York produc
tion was magical; one of those
rare moments in the theater
when script, cast, direction and
audience all come together to
create a moving, memorable
event. It was therefore with
somewhat raised expectations
that I attended the re-opening of
the Sjn Francisco production of
Cloud 9 at the Marines Memorial
Theatre on Tuesday night. Make
no mistake, the new production
is funny, interesting, and well
worth seeing, but it never at
tained the magic that I had re
membered. Examining the dif
ferences between the two pro
ductions, I not only was able to
get a feel for where the San Fran
cisco show had made its small
errors, but I came to some in
teresting realizations about what
it is, for me at least, that enables
a production of a good show to
reach its own Cloud 9.
The first act of Cloud 9 is set in
Africa in 1883. A British family

keeps an eye on this outpost of
the Empire buttressed by rifles
and Victorian morality. Here a
boy must love his father, not be
cause he deserves it, but be
cause "through our fathers, we
love our queen, and our God."
The family consists of Clive, the
father (Drew Eshelman), uphol
der of the great English pre
judices, both sexual and racial;
Betty, his wife (Chuck Lafont),
played by a man (to show that
she is what men have made her),
son Edward (Lorri Holt) played
by a girl (to show that he is not
quite all a man ought to be), and
little daughter Victoria, played
by a doll (to show just how the
family thinks of her). They are
watched over by the native
"boy" Joshua (Luis Oropeza),
played by a white man (to show
he is what white men have made
him), Betty's mother (Jenny Ster
ling keeper of the morals, and
governess Ellen (Sigrid

Wurschmidt), who hates chil
dren, but is in love with Betty.
Enter Harry Bagley (Errol Ross)
dashing explorer, and Mrs.
Saunders (Sigrid Wurschmidt
again), a feisty widow, and the
fun begins. Clive is chasing Mrs.
Saunders, while Betty chases
Harry, who unbeknownst to all
but Joshua and little Edward, is
gay. Edward is, like his mother,
desperately in love with Harry,
who, not entirely unwillingly,
gives in to the boy.
The act does not have a lot of
depth to it. It depends for its
success entirely on the continu
ing humor of the sex role rever
sals and of the shock of the con
stant sexual revelations. In the
New York production, it was
lightning-fast, and yet managed
to maintain a level of subtlety to
it so that each strange new situa
tion really was new.

Director Richard Seyd does
not garner the same effect from
his San Francisco cast because
he allows them to give away too
much too early. The continual
jolts are lessened considerably,

and the act seems repetitious in
many places as characters do
what it has become clear from
the beginning they will do.
In addition, there are some
clumsy transitions and two very
special moments I remember
from the Tommy Tune produc
tion which broke up the first act
are not present. In the first, Ed
ward relates a dream he has had

to Harry while sitting in the
explorer's lap. As the boy begins
toactoutthedream, he bounces
around, exciting Harry while
remaining totally unaware of the
sexuality of what is happening.
Seyd attempts a bit of this, but it
doesn't make a lot of sense as
staged, since Edward is not on
top of Harry. The second mo
ment is a story that Joshua tells

to Edward. It is a bad story, a
native creation myth. In the San
Francisco production, it is an in
teresting story, without much
physicalization, used to set up a
punch line. In New York, it was a
ritual dance interwoven with
words. The difference is not just
that physical movement is more
interesting and more compel
ling. That is the only point in the
show we ever get a feel for the
richness of the culture that the
British are trying so desperately
to destroy. Imperialism is clearly
not as potent an issue in San
Francisco as sexuality, but it is a
vital of what is happening in
Cloud 9, and to ignore it, as Seyd
does both here and in the sec
ond act, is to undercut the play.
The cast was not bad in the
first act, aside from the universal
overplaying. Sigrid Wurschmidt,
alternating between the gover
ness and Mrs. Saunders with
frightening speed, was impres
sive in the switching, though the
character of the governess, and
especially the attempt at what I
took to be an Irish accent, was
weak. As a whole, this first part
of the show was funny, and
made its points about Victorian

thought. For example, when
Harry finally lets on to Clive that
he is gay, the disgusted rep
resentative of English thought
shouts, "Rome fell, Harry." And
when Betty complains that Clive
has hurt Edward's feelings, he
retorts, "A boy has no business
having feelings." Unfortunately,
the pace is not right, and what in
New York was a quick, clever
and often captivating first act,
drags here, and serves as little
more than a prelude to the latter
half of the show.
In Act 11, we are suddenly in
London, 1983, though the
characters have only aged 25
years. Those that remain from
the first act are played by diffe
rent actors, and part of the clev
erness of the show is seeing how
thoughtfully the same people
repeat or totally contradict ear
lier situations as they take on dif
ferent persona.
Victoria (played by Holt, who
had been Edward) is now an
educated mother and wife fac
ing the difficult decisions that
liberation has thrust on many
women. Her husband, Martin
(played by Ross, who had been
Harry) is a modern thinking

man, who has read the Hite Re
port and is liberated enough in
his own mind to be writing a
novel about women "trom the
women's point of view." He is
objecting abittohertalkingdur
ing sex, though, which he feels
makes it too much like a driving
lesson. Victoria meets up with a
divorced woman in the park
(Wurschmidt), Lin, who turns
out to be a lesbian with a young
daughter Cathy (Oropeza, who
had been )oshua). In her frustra
tion with her husband and her
difficult choices, Victoria finds
affection and release with Lin.
Meanwhile, Edward (Eshelman,
who had been his father) is a gay
gardner living with a leather jac
keted young man, Gerry (LaF
ont, who had been Betty, the
mother). They are fighting, be
cause Jerry feels Edward is be
coming too much of a wife. Fi
nally, enter Betty, now middle

aged and newly separated from
her husband. She is very lost
alone in the modern world.
Jenny Sterlin, who was the
grandmother in the first act, is
very good at bringing out the
vulnerability and inner strength
of the newly free woman.
The cast in San Francisco is
much better in this much more
naturalistic second act. The di
rection is better here, and Chur
chill's clever, sensitive script
shines through. LaFont, as
Gerry, occasionally has prob
lems physicalizing the young
tough, and his movements seem
to be echoes of stereotypes
rather than his own. He is also a
much less appealing person
than the actor I remember in
New York, and you wonder
quite what Edward sees in him.
Eshelman, as Edward, is also
somewhat unappealing, and this
hurts many of the sensitive mo
ments in the act. Holt and Ross
are very good as Victoria and
Martin, and Wurschmidt is out
standing as the brash, loving Lin.

There is one scene that is flawed
badly in the act: Lin's brother
who has been killed in Ireland
reappears to her in the park. This
is again a commentary on im
perialism, and both the message
and the moment are obscured
by uncertainty â€” the director
seemed to have no idea why it
was there, and it seems out of
place. There are many beautiful,
sensitive moments in the act
which survive, however: nota
bly, when Edward tells his sister
he would like to touch her
breasts, and a strange meeting
where Betty tries to pick up
Gerry in the park. He is not quite
sensitive enough to make this
perfect, but the lines rise above
the acting. Similarly, in Betty's
final speech, as she rediscovers
her own sexuality and love for
herself, Seyd lets the sexuality of
the moment show through her
gentleness a bit too strongly for
my taste, but Churchill's lovely
lines carry if off.
All in all, this is quite a good
production, especially in the

second act; it is very funny and
well worth your time. What then
is missing? It seems to me that
the mistakes about imperialism
are the key. Somehow, Chur
chill isgettingat the idea that the
sexual mores, like the British
soldiers, are engaged in stamp
ing out much of what is vital, in
teresting and important in
people. To make arbitrary deci
sions about the correctness of
sexual attitudes is as debilitating
as arbitrary decisions about cor
rect cultures, and the two types
of repression are closely linked.
The San Francisco production
leaves us with the message that
sexuality in all forms is good and
healthy and necessary. Needless
to say, the show preaches to the
already converted. The ability to
get at the subtler and more in
teresting message, and to
physicalize and present it so that
it takes hold of the entire play is
what gave the magic to Tommy
Tune's production, and truly
brought a clever play to the level
of Cloud 9.
