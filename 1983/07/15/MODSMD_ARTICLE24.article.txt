# Not quite what it should be
## 
### MARC FAJER 
Last December, I was lucky
enough to see Tommy Tune's
off-Broadway production of
Caryl Churchill's play, Cloud 9.
The play is a startling examina
tion of sexuality and imperialism
that features men playing wo
men, women playing men,
adults playing children, a white
man playing a black man, and a
bewildering assortment of sex
ual connections, both straight
and gay. The New York produc
tion was magical; one of those
rare moments in the theater
when script, cast, direction and
audience all come together to
create a moving, memorable
event. It was therefore with
somewhat raised expectations
that I attended the re-opening of
the Sjn Francisco production of
Cloud 9 at the Marines Memorial
Theatre on Tuesday night. Make
no mistake, the new production
is funny, interesting, and well
worth seeing, but it never at
tained the magic that I had re
membered. Examining the dif
ferences between the two pro
ductions, I not only was able to
get a feel for where the San Fran
cisco show had made its small
errors, but I came to some in
teresting realizations about what
it is, for me at least, that enables
a production of a good show to
reach its own Cloud 9.
The first act of Cloud 9 is set in
Africa in 1883. A British family

keeps an eye on this outpost of
the Empire buttressed by rifles
and Victorian morality. Here a
boy must love his father, not be
cause he deserves it, but be
cause "through our fathers, we
love our queen, and our God."
The family consists of Clive, the
father (Drew Eshelman), uphol
der of the great English pre
judices, both sexual and racial;
Betty, his wife (Chuck Lafont),
played by a man (to show that
she is what men have made her),
son Edward (Lorri Holt) played
by a girl (to show that he is not
quite all a man ought to be), and
little daughter Victoria, played
by a doll (to show just how the
family thinks of her). They are
watched over by the native
"boy" Joshua (Luis Oropeza),
played by a white man (to show
he is what white men have made
him), Betty's mother (Jenny Ster
ling keeper of the morals, and
governess Ellen (Sigrid

Wurschmidt), who hates chil
dren, but is in love with Betty.
Enter Harry Bagley (Errol Ross)
dashing explorer, and Mrs.
Saunders (Sigrid Wurschmidt
again), a feisty widow, and the
fun begins. Clive is chasing Mrs.
Saunders, while Betty chases
Harry, who unbeknownst to all
but Joshua and little Edward, is
gay. Edward is, like his mother,
desperately in love with Harry,
who, not entirely unwillingly,
gives in to the boy.
The act does not have a lot of
depth to it. It depends for its
success entirely on the continu
ing humor of the sex role rever
sals and of the shock of the con
stant sexual revelations. In the
New York production, it was
lightning-fast, and yet managed
to maintain a level of subtlety to
it so that each strange new situa
tion really was new.
