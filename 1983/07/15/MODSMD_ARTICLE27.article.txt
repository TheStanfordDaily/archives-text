The Rose (1979) ★
Fox, Redwood City
Within the first five minutes of
the picture, Bette Midler, in her
screen debut, has already de
monstrated more range than
most actressesget to show in a
dozen movies. Her portrayal of
the child-like, groping, self
destructive Rose — a rock singer
clearly patterned after Janis Jop
lin — is sheerly intuitive; un
trained, emotionally crude, she
puts over scenes that might baffle
more skilled actresses. The direc
tion by Mark Rydell is unusually
sensitive; the photography is
superb (Vilmos Zsigmond was at
the helm, but half a dozen other
first-rate cameramen worked on
it); and Frederic Forrest, as
Rose's lover, is a fine match for
Midler — their scenes together
have a sweet, almost wistful qual
ity. Bill Kerby and Bo Goldman
wrote the screenplay, which has
some high moments but suffers
from the inevitability of its
show-biz heartbreak structure.
With Alan Bates (in an ill
conceived role), Harry Dean
Stanton and Barry Primus.
Plays today and Monday with
Divine Madness.
Divine Madness (1980) ★
Fox, Redwood City
A filmed record of Bette Mi
dler's second Broadway revue,
lovingly shot by William Fraker
and Bobby Byrne and directed by
Michael Ritchie with a keen sense
of stage dynamics. It shows us
..spects of Midler that we didn't
see in The Rose: a wild, impro
vised hilarity that straddles the
line between burlesque and
camp, a taste for send-ups of old
swing and early rock tunes and
for ballads, most of them awful,
which she endows with such
emotional range that they seem
reborn. There are sentimental
moments and overblown num
bers,but mostofwhatshedoesis
terrific, especially her renditions
of three songs from The Rose
(which differ greatly from the
original performances).
Plays today and Monday with
The Rose.
Julia (1977)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alvin Sargent adapted Lillian
Hellman's haunting memoir (in
Pentimento) about her friend
ship with an extraordinary
woman who involves her in
pre-war anti-Nazi activities in
Europe. Fred Zinneman directed,
in a carefully preserved, glossy
style that solves none of the prob
lems inherent in the construction
of Sargent's script: in the begin
ning, there are so many short
scenes that you don't have a
chance to get used to the rela
tionships or to understand the
milieux. And the depiction of
Hellman's life in New York, with
Hal Holbrook and Rosemary
Murphy in ludicrous caricatures
of Alan Campbell and Dorothy
Parker, is preposterous. (We're
supposed to feel that the New
York theater world is decadent

and worthless, while Julia lives in
the real wor'd.) But lane Fonda
gives as good a performance as
possible in the Lillian part —
she'd be better with a better
script. As Dashiell Hammett,
lason Robards shows up every
half hour to pass judgement on
Lillian's writing. (When he finally
tells her that the final draft of The
Children's Hour is one of the best
things ever done, this Hammett
quickly loses his credibility as a
critic.) As Julia, Vanessa Redgrave
looms over the movie — even
when she's not on screen; it's a
truly great performance, and her
final scene with Fonda, in a cafe
in Berlin, is so beautifully acted,
directed and written that it damn
near saves the picture.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Sophie's Choice.

The Shining (1980)
Memorial Auditorium
Numbing. Stephen King's
bestseller, a hack piece of writing
but cleverly plotted and undeni
ably frightening, was about an
unemployed writer-teacher, his
wife and their young son (who
has second sight), who spend the
winter in an otherwise empty
hotel in Colorado where the wri

ter is employed as off-season
caretaker. The hotel, The Over
look, has a scandalous past, and
in the course of the story it be
comes increasingly apparent that
its ghosts wish to claim the fam
ily. Stanley Kubrick directed the
movie version, but he isn't low
minded enough for this sort of
thriller, and the results are long,
ponderous, outsize and deliber
ately ambiguous. (The story ele
ments have been inexplicably al
tered and truncated, so that the
movie doesn't make sense.) As
the writer, Jack Nicholson plays
against his terrible lines for the
first half, but becomes more and
more ludicrous as the movie con
tinues; as his wife, on the other
hand, Shelley Duval! gets better
and better — her performance
accumulates power.
Plays Sunday evening.

From Here to Eternity (1953) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
One of the two or three best
American movies of the early
'50s. Daniel Taradash adapted
James Jones' bestseller about
soldiers stationed at Pearl Harbor
just before the Japanese attack in
1941, and Fred Zinneman di
rected, beautifully. The extraor
dinary cast includes Montgomery

Clift (giving his greatest perfor
mance) as the sensitive bugler
Pruitt; Burt Lancaster as the
sergeant in love with his captain's
wife, played by Deborah Kerr;
Frank Sinatra as mouthy, appeal
ing Maggio; Donna Reed as the
nightclub "hostess" (a Hays
Code euphemism) in love with
Pruitt; and Ernest Borgnine as the
evil bully in charge of the stoc
kade. Among the scenes movie
lovers have cherished for years
are Lancaster's first advance to
Kerr; the love scene on the beach
(memorably spoofed by Sid
Caesar and Imogene Coca on
TV); the communal drunk scene
that climaxes in Maggio's death;
and — most moving of all —
Pruitt's bugle tribute to his dead
buddy. The haunting melody in
the drunk scene is "Re
enlistment Blues."
Plays in special showings
Thursday with Race to Oblivion.
Open City (1945) ★
Terman Auditorium
Anna Magnani's fatigue seems
bone-deep, like Garbo's in Grand
Hotel, but she is so vivifying as
the working class heroine of
Robert Rossellini's celebrated
neo-realist picture that she lights
up the screen when she appears,
and when she is killed in the
middle of the movie, its fiercest
life force seems to go out of it.
Magnani is the most extraordi
nary of the screen's earth
mothers, its great transcendent
naturalist; she is witty, but her
wit is strongly earthbound. Open
City, about the activities of the
Italian Resistance, is a terrific
political melodrama; seen today,
its division of characters into
good and evil mav be more glar
ing (Nazism is dubiously equated
with homosexuality, sadism and
narcotics), but it has retained its
sense of immediacy. Among the
many fine sequences is one in
which a flock of schoolboys, set
ting bombs for the Under
ground, appear out of the smoke
and bound over the rooftops —
it's almost a fusion of Tom Sawyer
and )ean Vido's Zero de Con
duite. Aldo Fabrizi gives a won
derful performance as a political
priest; Federico Fellini worked
on the screenplay with Sergio
Amidei.
Plays tonight.
The Black Stallion (1979) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Carroll Ballard has turned Wal
ter Farley's entertaining chil
dren's book about a boy and a
horse into a work of poetry. In
the first half of the movie, in
which these two central figures
survive a shipwreck and live and
play on an island of which they
are the sole inhabitants, their re
lationship has an intensity that is
almost mystical; the second half
is structured like a conventional
horse race story — say, National
Velvet — but Ballard continues to
see the events through the boy's
wide eyes, and so the imagery is
perhaps more vivid than in al
most any other recent American

movie. The indescribably sump
tuous photography is by Caleb
Deschanel, and Carmine Cop
pola wrote a lovely score. Kelly
Reno plays the boy, and in a
comeback performance of as
tonishing grace and charm, Mic
key Rooney plays the one-time
jockey who teaches him how to
race. With Teri Garr and folk
singer Hoyt Axton as the parents,
Michael Higgins and the mysteri
ously gentle black actor Clarence
Muse, in his farewell appear
ance. Melissa Matheson, jeanne
Rosenberg and W.D. Witliff
wrote the screenplay.
Plays Sunday with The Black
Stallion Returns.
Beauty and the Beast (1946) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
lean Cocteau directs what is
perhaps the greatest of all fairy
tale films. Josette Day, approp
riately, is Beauty, and Jean Marais
is her superb Beast. His castle,
with live heads in bas-relief on
thewallsand hands that grow out
of tables to pour wine for his
guests, is a cross between Gus
tave Dore and Salvador Dali.
Plays Monday with Orpheus.
Orpheus (1949) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
lean Cocteau s magical mod
ern setting of the Orpheus and
Eurydice myth stars lean Marais
as Orpheus — a poet rather than
a musician here (though jazz
plays on the soundtrack) — and
Maria Casares as Death, who
heads a motorcycle brigade.
Messages from the underworld
sound on car radios; Orpheus
enters it through a mirror. A
one-of-a-kind movie
Plays Monday with Beauty and
the Beast.
Richard Prvor Live on the Sun
set Strip ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Richard Pryor s 25-minute
freebase routine may represent
the farthest leap any comic has
taken since Lenny Bruce: simul
taneously hilarious and harrow
ing, it plays so many disparate
emotional chords that one
doesn't know exactly how to re
spond to it. The rest of this filmed
nightclub show (directed by |oe
Layton and shot by Haskell
Wexler) isn't up to Richard Pryor
Live in Concert — there are a few
serious moments that come ac
ross as sentimental — but most of
it is marvelous, and liberating.
Plays today with Up in Smoke
and Still Smokin'.
