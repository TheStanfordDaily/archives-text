Poland may end martial law
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's national assembly
moved yesterday to strengthen the country's
police apparatus and write into the constitution
broad powers for declaring a state of emergency,
anticipating government motions next week pos
sibly abolishing the 1981 martial-law decree that
crushed the Solidarity independent labor union
movement.
Informed sources said the chief effect of lifting
martial law would be removal of military commis
sars sent to factories to maintain discipline and a
selective amnesty for people imprisoned for polit
ical offenses.
Meanwhile, the leadership of the Solidarity un
derground belittled the expected lifting of martial
law as "only a gesture without any substantial sig
nificance," noting that the government has no in
tention of canceling legislation enacted "under
the cover" of military rule that "restructured soci
ety and granted broad police powers."
