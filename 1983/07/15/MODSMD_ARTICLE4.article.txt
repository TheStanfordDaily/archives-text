## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
Former President Jimmy Carter will visit the Hoover Institu
tion today after his meeting with University President Donald
Kennedy and faculty from the school of engineering. During
Carter's presidency Kennedy served as head of the Food and
Drug Administration.
Carter and the President of Emory University, who is traveling
with the former president, will meet with Hoover Director W.
Glenn Campbell at 5:15 p.m.
According to George Marotta, public affairs coordinator at
Hoover, the Carter visit has nothing to do with the search for
possible purloined Carter documents in the Reagan archives at
the Institution. Instead, the visit was set up to acquaint Carter
with the details of "how a public policy research center is run."
"Campbell has been advising the Carter people on that sub
ject." Marotta said.
Carter is establishing a public policy institute at Emory Uni
versity.
The main purpose of the Carter visit is to educate the former
president on the high technology engineering activity at Stan
ford and to acquaint him with the issues facing major research
institutions in the U.S. Carter is stopping at Stanford on his way
to Japan.
