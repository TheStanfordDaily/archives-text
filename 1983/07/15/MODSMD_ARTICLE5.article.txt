# Atkin: current political furor will eventually help education
## 
### CHRIS SPRINGER 
The current political attention
being given to public schools
will strengthen the educa
tional system, the dean of the
School of Education told an au
dience of 50 in Terman Au
ditorium Wednesday night.
"It doesn't happen very often
in American history that politi
cians choose to focus so much
attention on the schools," J.
Myron Atkin said. "I don't think
(Gov. George) Deukmejian can
go on for very long saying that
education is the top priority of
the state without (increasing) al
locations to the schools."
However, President Reagan's
policy toward education is a
major obstacle to increasing
school funds, Atkin said. He cal
led Reagan's proposal of tuition
tax credits "a giant step toward
weakening the public schools."
Atkin said that in spite of de
clining teacher quality and polit
ical rhetoric, the public schools
continue to serve "an ever
broader segment of the popula
tion."
According to Atkin, the issue
of women's rights has created a
vicious circle in education.
"Probably the most significant

factor in the drop in quality of
people going into teaching was
the women's movement. Now
women see their job oppor
tunities to be much broader be
cause their educational oppor
tunities have expanded."
An influx of younger teachers
with a "laid-back appearance"
has also "caused people to look
a little differently at the
schools," Atkin said.
"(Their presence) emphasized
that the schools were not the
seemingly unchanging institu
tions perpetuating long
cherished values. I think we'd
better watch them if we want
that."
Atkin said that high school
seniors who intend to enter the
teaching field score lowest on
the SAT out of all those declaring
their future career field.
"In verbal ability their average
is something like 392. Even
worse, if something could be
worse, those teachers now leav
ing the profession are those with
the highest scores."
Atkin, himself a former high
school science teacher, discus
sed the problems with past
methods of teaching science,
including using the subject to

develop memorization skills or
to glorify Cod.
"The teaching of science has
rarely been the objective of
teaching science in this coun
try," Atkin said, noting that this
attitude was changing.
"We're freshly concerned
about the impact of science in
our lives, the impact of en
vironmental issues, genetics re
search and nuclear energy."
Atkin's concerns also in
cluded the increasingly power
ful role federal and state funding
plays in the school system. The
typical source of school funds,
Atkin said, has gone from an
equal share between state and
local taxes to the current situa
tion in which states pay 80 per
cent of the cost of education.
Reiterating his optimism,
Atkin praised the "constructive
climate" afforded by newfound
attention to education.
"The quality of the educa
tional system is something we
care very much about," he said.
Atkin reminded his audience
that "public education affects
Stanford—even the most selec
tive institutions are part of a
larger educational fabric."
