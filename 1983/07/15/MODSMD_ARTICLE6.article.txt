## CIA's Nicaraguan costs overrun 
### 
Washington—The CIA, surprised hv the
number of Nicaraguans joiningthe tight against
the leftist Sandinista government, has encoun
tered cost overruns in its not-so-secret support
of the counter-revolutionary forces, intelli
gence sources said Wednesday.
The sources, who spoke on condition they
not be identified, said the cost to feed, train and
arm the estimated 10.000 Nicaraguans who are
now part of the insurgency has driven the
budget above the planned $19 million a year.
The sources declined to give the new figure for
the operation.
"When you have twice as many people as you
expected, it's going to cost more," said one
source. "You have to feed and arm the ralliers,
and since they are not as well trained, they fire
off more ammunition."
Sources said that even though the number of
fighters is double the expected total, the cost
for the operation has not increased by that
magnitude because the newer fighters who
have joined the anti-Sandinista cause are not
receiving as much training as the earlier insur
gents did.

Besides the cost, the newcomers also present
other problems, the sources said. The larger
numbers enable the Sandinistas to locate the
"contra"—or counter-revolutionary—forces
more easily and some of the new recruits are
suspected to be Sandinista agents.
"The Sandinistas know where everything
is,"said one source. "It's easy (for agents) to
penetrate a movement like this. It's amazing
that (rebel leader Eden) Pastora has stayed alive
this long."
Asked about the reported higher costs, CIA
spokeswoman Kathryn Riedel said, "we do not
comment on allegations of covert activities."
The sources said that despite the rebel suc
cess in attracting fighters, the contras are still
too weak to topple the four-year-old Sandanista
government, backed by a 25,000-man regular
army and a 50,000-man militia force.
Much of the congressional debate about the
covert action has focused on whether it is vio
lating a 1982 law barring the CIA from support
ing the rebels "for the purpose" of overthrow
ing the Sandinista government.
