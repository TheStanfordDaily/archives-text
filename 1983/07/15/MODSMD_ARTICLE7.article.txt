San Salvador, El Salvadorâ€”
Ambassador Deane Hinton said
Wednesday there are situations
that could call for direct inter
vention of U.S. troops to Central
America, but indicated he did
not think it likely.
In a farewell speech to a busi
ness group, Hinton also expres
sed outrage at what he called
"the failure" of the Salvadoran
judicial system to bring to justice
the slayers of four American
churchwomen and two Ameri
can labor adviser-*.
Hinton, 60, is leaving El Sal

vador on Friday and will be re
placed by Thomas Pickering, a
career diplomat whose last post
was in Nigeria.
"There are situations in which
one can imagine a direct inter
vention by the United States, but
hopefully we won't see more
conflict. Hopefully we are on the
road to peace," Hinton said dur
ing a question-and-answer
period after his speech at the
American Chamber of Com
merce luncheon.
"In my opinion, most of you
do not want a direct intervention

by the gringos here, and there is
no necessity," he said. "In the
case of a generalized conflict
breaking out in the region, it
would all depend on who started
it."
Hinton, ambassador here
since May 1981, said he had been
"frustrated by the failure to date
to see justice done to the killers
of my fellow citizens.
"I think Americans share a
sense of outrage over this fai
lure. I refuse to believe justice in
the end will not be done," he
said.
