# U.S. public ignorant of Central America
## 
### 
There are times when the
parallels between Vietnam and
El Salvador are overdrawn. But
occasionally the comparison is
apt. For example, the American
public's apparent ignorance
about the issues at stake in Cent
ral America is reminiscent of its
lack of knowledge before 1965
about the conflicts in Indochina.
A recent New York Times-CBS
News poll found that despite
more than two years of con
troversy over U.S. policies in El
Salvador, Nicaragua and other
countries of that volatile region,
only an incredibly small propor
tion of the American public has
any inkling of what is going on
there.
Only 25 percent of the 1365
adults surveyed in the poll knew
that the Reagan administration is
supporting the government, not
the opposition guerrillas, in the
civil war in El Salvador. Only 13
percent knew that in Nicaragua
the United States is siding with
insurgents against the re
volutionary Sandinista govern
ment. And only 8 percent came
up with the correct answers to
both questions.
President Reagan must take
little comfort from the fact that
both the better-informed and
the uninformed respondents
were unenthusiastic about his
policies in Central America. Of
the former, 48 percent said that
they favored increased military
aid for the region, compared
with 49 percent of the latter.
Only 43 percent of the unin

formed respondents agreed
with Reagan's recent decision to
send more U.S. military advisers
there, compared with 40 percent
of the well-informed.
A significant majority in both
groups, 64 percent among the
well-informed and 56 percent
among the uninformed, said
that they were against sending
U.S. combat troops to Central
America.
Vet the many critics of
Reagan's policies in Central
America cannot be reassured by
the poll results, either. Such
widespread apathy and ignor
ance make it easy for a skilled
and determined politician to
manipulate public opinion.
George Reedy, press secretary
to President Johnson, made this
point a few months ago during
a University of Southern
California-sponsored sym
posium on the Vietnam War. In
contrast to some of the other
speakers, who recalled the divi
sive passions of that period and
blamed the outcome of the war
on one faction or another,
Reedy said that the fault lay with
the American public.
Before the United States be
came entangled in Indochina,
he argued, most Americans
didn't even know where it was.
And they knew next to nothing
about Vietnam's history and its
people. They were ignorant but
patriotic. So they followed a
strong-willed president into a
tragic, terrible quagmire.
