# Reagan's hardline claimed effective

Washington—The Pentagon's
top arms control specialist said
Wednesday that the administra
tion's continuing toughness in
talks with Moscow was one
reason the Soviets have prop
osed missile cuts below the
levels of previous arms limita
tion agreements.
"It's time for some people to
reconsider some hasty judge
ments about how effective the
president's approach is in deal
ing with the Soviet Union," As
sistant Secretary of Defense
Richard Perle Wednesday told
reporters at a breakfast meeting.
"The Soviets are talking to us
about levels lower than SALT II,"
he said, referring to the U.S.-
Soviet strategic arms limitation
agreement signed in 1979 but
never ratified by the Senate. The
new levels, he said, "are not a lot
lower, but they are lower."
That, he added, "is movement
in the right direction," even
though we've got a long way to
go" before the talks get to the
question that most concerns the
United States, which is the strik
ing power rather than just the
size of the Soviet missile force.
Perle, who is in charge of in
ternational security policy at the
Pentagon, said whatever move
ment there has been in the
Soviet position "has not been
significant" because it has not
dealt with the Soviet's large
SS-18and SS-19 missiles—some
640 in all—that U.S. planners say
threaten the American land
based missile force and that the
United States wants sharply cut
back.
Perle's remarks were made as
he was questioned about a re
port that the Soviets last week
modified their position at the
strategic arms reduction talks
(START) in Geneva. That
Washington Post report said
Moscow has now proposed re
ductions in long-range,
multiple-warhead, interconti
nental ballistics missiles and
bombers below the levels of
SALT 11. But the new proposal
reportedly would let the Soviets
keep all their big missiles while
reducing others in their forces.
White House and State De
partment spokesmen Wednes
day acknowledged that "during
this round (of SALT) the Soviets
have provided additional infor
mation elaborating (on) their
proposal. We hope that the
further information. . .indicates

a Soviet intention to show simi
lar flexibility to ours and to move
the negotiations forward."
Perle's comments Wednesday
on several aspects of the U.S.-
Soviet battle over nuclear arms
control reflect the unusual stage
that this struggle appears to have
reached.
For example, the view is wide
spread in the administration that
the Soviet shifts at Geneva thus
far, as Perle said, have not been
significant in that they have not
dealt specifically with the most
threatening Soviet forces. Yet
officials want to take credit for
whatever progress has been
made, which they attribute to
President Reagan's toughness in
seeking big cutbacks in arms
while proceeding with a defense
buildup.
Several officials said the ad
ministration is "more receptive
than ever," as one put it, to any
serious Soviet offer to limit
numbers of warheads and the
largest missiles, as the U.S. has
proposed. Still, there is no sign
yet that such a move will occur
because the U.S. proposal calls
for vastly greater shifts in Soviet
rather than in U.S forces, in part
because the Soviet missile
forces are larger.
"The Soviets have some
straightforward calculations to
make," Perle said, noting that
the United States has an array of
new weapons under develop
ment, including the MX and Tri
dent II missiles, new bombers
and new cruise missiles.
"If I were the Soviets, I'd be
inclined to conclude that this is
the right time to agree on the
kinds of ceilings we are propos
ing because they'll be better off
and the world will be more sta
ble."
Another paradox is that while
Wahington is publicly stressing
its flexibility at the arms talks it
also has under way a study of
alleged Soviet violations of pre
vious arms agreements.
While Reagan has been reluc
tant to accuse the Soviets pub
licly of specific violations, there
is widespread agreement in the
administration, as Perle also
hinted, that new Soviet missile
tests and the encoding of data
transmitted to the ground dur
ing those tests are violations of
the spirit and possibly the letter
of previous pacts.
