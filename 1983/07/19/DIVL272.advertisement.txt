CIRCLE THE WORLD

studying in
KYOTO, BALI, SINGAPORE,
BENARES, NAIROBI, CAIRO,
JERUSALEM and LONDON.
Accompanied by internationally known senior
professors, the selected students will carry a full course

themselves to themselves and outsiders.

motivated candidates who are prepared for a fulfilling
academic experience. For further information and an
