## Stanford community greets Carter with cheers 
### 
Continued from front page
list. Hoover spokesmen said the
debategate scandal was not dis
cussed.
Earlier in the afternoon, Carter
met privately with Kennedy,
commissioner of the Food and
Drug administration during his
administration. Carter was then
briefed on high technology en
gineering activity at Stanford by
Engineering dean William Kays,
Assistant Dean Anthony Macias,
and engineering Profs. Wa.ren
Hausman, Charles Kruger and
lames Meindl
Robert Freelen, University
vice president for public affairs,
who was also at the meeting,
said the professors fielded ques
tions from Carter about the rela
tionship between industry and
education and the workings of
the newly established Center for
Integrated Systems, a joint ven
ture of the University and 17
electronics corporations.
Carter's motorcade arrived at
the Quad at 3:30 p.m. where it
was greeted by a small crowd of
150 onlookers and a dozen
members of the press. As Carter
stepped from his car, he told
Kennedy and the crowd that it

was "nice to be back," referring
to a presidential election cam
paign appearance he made here
in 1976.
Although there was no cam
paigning to be done this time, it
might have looked that way to an
uninformed observer as Carter
stooped to pick up little Laura
Clarke, daughter of a graduate
student, and posed fora picture.
Later, at the close of the meet
ing in Kennedy's office, Kruger
presented Carter with a set of
fishing tlies, hand-tied by a stu
dent.
Later, as he walked from Ken
nedy's office to the Hoover In
stitution, Carter told reporters
he had nothing to say about the
debategate incident or the
Reagan archive search going on
at Hoover.
As they walked, Kennedy told
Carter that he felt Emory was a
"good university and getting
better all the time. I'm sure your
association with it is going to
help."
After the Hoover meeting,
Carter ducked reporters and
sightseers by sneaking out a
back door to a waiting car.

press (left) which followed Carter closely wherever he went. To avoid this problem, Carter cleverly
