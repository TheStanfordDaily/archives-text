## The 						Beach Boys play Candlestick The 						Band's grown up, but so have the fans. And they don't seem to mind

The Beach Boys played in San
Francisco in the early 60s. The
Beach Men played there Satur
day.
They may still sing about the
adolescent dream world full of
surf, sand and sweethearts, but
the Beach Boys aren't teenagers
anymore.
But neither are their fans.
And that's what saved Satur
day's show.
Sure there were a lot of tenta
tive starting notes. Sure the Boys

wandered off key occassionally.
Sure the band was 100 yards
from even the closest members
of the audience.
The crowd loved it.
Auer three hours of beer
drinking and bad baseball (the
Giants lost 9-3), 40,000 mostly
middle aged Candlestick tan*
were ready to jump in their
'Vette and cruise down memory
lane.
As the stadium speakers


blasted an electronic version of
Fanfare for the Common Man,
the Beach Boys circled fhe field
in their T-Birds, 'Vettes and
Woodies. Some drove with their
wives and kids, but the women
in the audience screamed just
the same.
After what seemed like an
hour of this somewhat pathetic
hero worship, the band finally
took the stage, pumping out a
medley of hits and quasi-hits,
starting off with, of course,
California Girls, then I Can Hear
Music and Sloop John B.
Maybe because Beach Boys
songs are all fundamentally the
same, the band played little but
medleys all afternoon. The
crowd went wild when Mike
Love announced the band
would play their version of

"music on wheels," a medley of
what seemed like just about
every Beach Boys song even
mentioning the automobile.
Fun, Fun, Fun, Little Deuce
Coup and 409 had the crowd
singing, clapping and even
bunny-hopping on the second
deck.
The crowd's excitement actu
ally covered for the band most of
the day. With 40,000 fans singing
backing vocals, it's hard not to
sound good.
The band performed two
cover tunes—Del Shannon's
Runaway and lohn Lennon's Im
agine. The boys sang Runaway
with a man who may or may not
have been Del Shannon—the
crowd drowned out the intro
duction. Once again, with4o,ooo
fans helping them out, it didn't
really matter that the Boys
couldn't come close to the
falsetto of the original.
But Imagine was a different
story. The song bored the crowd

and come off like a Wayne New
ton version of My Generation.
Perhaps the most puzzling
part of the show was the pre
sence of 75 of the ugliest teen
age girls I've ever seen sitting on
a giant painted canvas wave in
front of the stage. The girls—
dressed in tacky KVUU jerseys
and even tackie mini-skirts—
arrived at the center of the field
after some complicated and
pointless maneuvering of a few
thousand feet of rope. Once
there, they held the canvas wave
down in the 30 mile an hour
Candlestick winds and variously
danced chorus-line style and
swayed back and torth, arms in
air, in the bt?st of the front-of
the-crowd-at-a-lourney-concert
style. Where these girls came
from or how they got so ugly, I'll
never know.
Perhaps KVUU had hoped that
75 hideous teens near the stage
would make up for the lack of
any other fans within a hundred
yards. After the game, a tractor

pulled the stage and a circle ot
speakers to second base. Sec
urity guards kept fans in their
seats, seemingly miles away
from the stage. Only two drun
ken tans attempted to cross the
security barrier: both were tack
led, handcuffed and taken away.
Maybe by placing the band at
midfield the promoters thought
they could give everyone a good
view of the band. Or maybe they
had a better reason. From 100
yards its hard to tell that beneath
his Giants cap Mike Love is grow
ing bald and that all (he band
members could drop 15 or 20
pounds.
But again, so could most of the
audience. The audience didn't
care because most of them were
in the same shape. If the Beach
Boys sang a little off key or mis
sed a beat here or there, that
could be forgiven. The crowd
knew how the songs should
have sounded and how the band
used to look, and, singing along,
that was good enough for them.

members could drop 15 or 20
pounds.
But again, so could most of the
audience. The audience didn't
care because most of them were
in the same shape. If the Beach
Boys sang a little off key or mis
sed a beat here or there, that
could be forgiven. The crowd
knew how the songs should
have sounded and how the band
used to look, and, singing along,
that was good enough for them.

The Beach Boys played in San
Francisco in the early 60s. The
Beach Men played there Satur
day.
They may still sing about the
adolescent dream world full of
surf, sand and sweethearts, but
the Beach Boys aren't teenagers
anymore.
But neither are their fans.
And that's what saved Satur
day's show.
Sure there were a lot of tenta
tive starting notes. Sure the Boys

wandered off key occassionally.
Sure the band was 100 yards
from even the closest members
of the audience.
The crowd loved it.
Auer three hours of beer
drinking and bad baseball (the
Giants lost 9-3), 40,000 mostly
middle aged Candlestick tan*
were ready to jump in their
'Vette and cruise down memory
lane.
