## A
						Star is Born: a rebirth of Cukor's version 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
One of the favorite topics ot
conversation among movie
buffs in my undergraduate film
society days was the possibility
of rediscovering legendary
'"lost" footage—scenes that had
been cut from all copies of cer
tain movies before or im
mediately after their release like
most of Creed and the "litter
bug" number from The Wizard
of Oz and the two songs trom
the 1954 A Star /s Born, "Here's
What I'm Here For" and "Lose
That Long Face," that appear on
the soundtrack recording but
not on the widely shown 154-
minute print of the picture. We
used to joke that someday all the
footage we'd ever longed to see
would turn up in lack Warner's
home vault, where the Borrow
ers had stored it.
That wishtul joke is becoming
more and more a reality, now
that Kevin Brownlow has recon
structed most of Napoleon and
assembled a treasure trove of
Chaplin outtakes and rehearsal
scenes in a new documentary
compilation—and now that,
under the auspices ot the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences Foundation, Ron
Haver, film department chief at
the L A. County Museum has
dug up ! ( > r>; the 27 minutes
pared from A Star Is Born. Last
Saturday night, at Oakland's
Paramount Theater (itself a
flamboyant tribute to a glittering
pop cultural past), Haver and
Academy president Fay Kanin
presented an almost fully re
stored Star, with vanished
scenes approximated hv the in
tercutting of production stills
and live action remnants, lifted
to the original soundtrack.
(Sound and picture were pro
jected on separate reels, as they
had been at the 1954 premiere;
presumably a complete sound
track has always been available.)
Among the found footage are
full alternate takes of "Here's
What I'm Here For" and "Lose

112 hat Long Face. Furthermore,
Haver unearthed the original cut
release print, in Cinemascope,
Stereophonic Sound and dye
transfer three-strip Technicolor,
and wove the deleted sequences
and stills into it, so that today's
viewers can more nearly ap
proach the experience of the
opening night audience in Sep
tember of 1954 than anyone has
in the intervening 29 years.

A Star Is Born is a strange ani
mal. The story, of an alcoholic
actor who discovers a talented
young actress, launches her,
falls in love with her, and then
watches his own career eclipse
as hers skyrockets, has so much
visceral gossip-column appeal
that Hollywood has churned it
out four times. The first, unoffi
cial version, What Price Hol
lywood, based on a story by re

porter Adela Rogers St. John,
was directed by George Cukor in
1932, and featured Lowell Sher
man as the falling star and Con
stance Bennett as the rising one.
Dorothy Parker and her husband
Alan Campbell worked on the
rehash in 1937—the first edition
to be titled A Star Is Born; Wil
liam Wellman directed it in
Technicolor as a comeback veh
icle for Janet Gaynor, and Fred
ric March played the drunken
Norman Maine.
Cukor returned to the mate
rial in the '50s, when Warners,
employing a Moss Hart script
and a score by Harold Arlen and
Ira Gershwin, rebuilt it around
the talents of Judy Garland, and
James Mason, just beginning a
career in Hollywood, took the
role of Maine. Again, the picture

was a comeback of sorts for its
leading actress—due to health
and temperament problems,
Garland had lost three projects
in a row at M-G-M (Annie Get
Your Cun opposite Howard
Keel, The Barkleys of Broadway
and Royal Wedding opposite
Fred Astaire) and when the
movie was finally completed in
1954, after more than two years
of shooting and editing and a
great deal of adverse publicity,
she had been off the screen for
four years. In the most recent
version (Frank Pierson, 1976),
the setting was changed from
the film to the rock world, and
Barbra Streisand and Kris Kris
tofferson starred.
In each case, the actress cast
as the bright young star, Esther,
has been an established celeb
rity well beyond the age of
debut —in 1937 and 1954, a
celebrity staging a comeback.
Moss Hart's screenplay attempts
to justify Garland's age by giving
Esther a speech about the years
spent waitressing and touring
with bands, and the long "Born
in a Trunk" montage number
from Esther's first film for the
Oliver Niles Studio parallels it.
(Leonard Gershe's lyric makes
the point: "So I'm not what you'd
call 'overnight sensation'/For it
happened many years ago. . .")
But the material is shaped to
contrast blooming youth and
decaying, self-destructive mid
dle age, and Garland, whose pri
vate struggles were far closer to
Norman's than to Esther's, looks
puffy and wasted, the creases in
her face sharp and shiny,her hair
cut short so that she has a
weirdly mannish appearance in
some scenes—like a slightly
woozy Peter Pan. It hardly seems
possible that this run-through
t he-mi 11 ]udy Garland could have
grown out of the auburn-haired
ingenue of Meet Me in St. Louis
and The Clock and The Harvey
Girls. Her voice has changed,
too: it has already acquired the
