## A 						Star is Born: a rebirth of Cukor's version 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
One of the favorite topics ot
conversation among movie
buffs in my undergraduate film
society days was the possibility
of rediscovering legendary
'"lost" footage—scenes that had
been cut from all copies of cer
tain movies before or im
mediately after their release like
most of Creed and the "litter
bug" number from The Wizard
of Oz and the two songs trom
the 1954 A Star /s Born, "Here's
What I'm Here For" and "Lose
That Long Face," that appear on
the soundtrack recording but
not on the widely shown 154-
minute print of the picture. We
used to joke that someday all the
footage we'd ever longed to see
would turn up in lack Warner's
home vault, where the Borrow
ers had stored it.
That wishtul joke is becoming
more and more a reality, now
that Kevin Brownlow has recon
structed most of Napoleon and
assembled a treasure trove of
Chaplin outtakes and rehearsal
scenes in a new documentary
compilation—and now that,
under the auspices ot the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences Foundation, Ron
Haver, film department chief at
the L A. County Museum has
dug up ! ( > r>; the 27 minutes
pared from A Star Is Born. Last
Saturday night, at Oakland's
Paramount Theater (itself a
flamboyant tribute to a glittering
pop cultural past), Haver and
Academy president Fay Kanin
presented an almost fully re
stored Star, with vanished
scenes approximated hv the in
tercutting of production stills
and live action remnants, lifted
to the original soundtrack.
(Sound and picture were pro
jected on separate reels, as they
had been at the 1954 premiere;
presumably a complete sound
track has always been available.)
Among the found footage are
full alternate takes of "Here's
What I'm Here For" and "Lose

112 hat Long Face. Furthermore,
Haver unearthed the original cut
release print, in Cinemascope,
Stereophonic Sound and dye
transfer three-strip Technicolor,
and wove the deleted sequences
and stills into it, so that today's
viewers can more nearly ap
proach the experience of the
opening night audience in Sep
tember of 1954 than anyone has
in the intervening 29 years.

A Star Is Born is a strange ani
mal. The story, of an alcoholic
actor who discovers a talented
young actress, launches her,
falls in love with her, and then
watches his own career eclipse
as hers skyrockets, has so much
visceral gossip-column appeal
that Hollywood has churned it
out four times. The first, unoffi
cial version, What Price Hol
lywood, based on a story by re

porter Adela Rogers St. John,
was directed by George Cukor in
1932, and featured Lowell Sher
man as the falling star and Con
stance Bennett as the rising one.
Dorothy Parker and her husband
Alan Campbell worked on the
rehash in 1937—the first edition
to be titled A Star Is Born; Wil
liam Wellman directed it in
Technicolor as a comeback veh
icle for Janet Gaynor, and Fred
ric March played the drunken
Norman Maine.
Cukor returned to the mate
rial in the '50s, when Warners,
employing a Moss Hart script
and a score by Harold Arlen and
Ira Gershwin, rebuilt it around
the talents of Judy Garland, and
James Mason, just beginning a
career in Hollywood, took the
role of Maine. Again, the picture

was a comeback of sorts for its
leading actress—due to health
and temperament problems,
Garland had lost three projects
in a row at M-G-M (Annie Get
Your Cun opposite Howard
Keel, The Barkleys of Broadway
and Royal Wedding opposite
Fred Astaire) and when the
movie was finally completed in
1954, after more than two years
of shooting and editing and a
great deal of adverse publicity,
she had been off the screen for
four years. In the most recent
version (Frank Pierson, 1976),
the setting was changed from
the film to the rock world, and
Barbra Streisand and Kris Kris
tofferson starred.
In each case, the actress cast
as the bright young star, Esther,
has been an established celeb
rity well beyond the age of
debut —in 1937 and 1954, a
celebrity staging a comeback.
Moss Hart's screenplay attempts
to justify Garland's age by giving
Esther a speech about the years
spent waitressing and touring
with bands, and the long "Born
in a Trunk" montage number
from Esther's first film for the
Oliver Niles Studio parallels it.
(Leonard Gershe's lyric makes
the point: "So I'm not what you'd
call 'overnight sensation'/For it
happened many years ago. . .")
But the material is shaped to
contrast blooming youth and
decaying, self-destructive mid
dle age, and Garland, whose pri
vate struggles were far closer to
Norman's than to Esther's, looks
puffy and wasted, the creases in
her face sharp and shiny,her hair
cut short so that she has a
weirdly mannish appearance in
some scenes—like a slightly
woozy Peter Pan. It hardly seems
possible that this run-through
t he-mi 11 ]udy Garland could have
grown out of the auburn-haired
ingenue of Meet Me in St. Louis
and The Clock and The Harvey
Girls. Her voice has changed,
too: it has already acquired the

ragged, sobbing tremolo at the
end of held notes that will be her
trademark when she plays to
worshipping crowds at Carnegie
Hall and The Palace in the early
'60s. Once once, briefly, in A Star
Is Born does her singing resem
ble the warm, sure vocals of her
M-G-M years—in "Melancholy
Baby," part of the ungainly, un
wieldy "Born In A Trunk" sequ
ence. (Cukor hated this medley,
which was not part of the com
missioned Arlen-Gershwin
score, and fought against its in
clusion. It's easy to see why, but
the number does have a hypno
tic fascination.) And she has
begun to put over her songs in
what would come to be called
the Garland style: intense, heav
ily weighted, a disturbing com
bination of no-holds-barred
masochistic torch singing and a
nakedly eager play for the ap
proval of her audience. Ibis ap
proach is particularly evident in
"The Man That Got Away,
which Esther sings with a small
band at a |azz club on Sunset
Strip after business hours. When
she reaches the crescendo at the
end of the penultimate verse—
"But fools will be fools And
where's he gone to?"—she steps
into close-up, gazing past the
musicians into a non-existent
crowd of admiring fans, and her
face is scarred yet smiling hope
fully, as if she were presenting
her own heartbreak for our de
lectation And that's in the first
half hour of the movie.

You may not care to watch this
kind of emotional striptease, but
you can't turn away. Technically,
her acting is terrible in almost all
of the film—she weeps through
every one of her dramatic
scenes, and she's rarely in con
trol of her performance. (Her
best moments are her funniest
ones—the take-off on Piaf in
"Someone at Last," and her
dry-eyed, wry response to Nor
man's proposal on the sound
stage, in the charming, long
buried "Here's What I'm Here
For" sequence.) But she's mes
merizing, in a way that lanet
Gaynor certainly wasn't—she
looked drab, with a tired twinkle
in her eyes — and Barbra
Streisand wasn t either, though
she sweated blood trying to be
and even gave herself a seven
minute close-up number at the
end in a doomed effort to recap
ture the magic of "My Man" at
the end of 112 unny Girl. And the
visual style of the production
underscores Garland's orgiastic
exhibitionism. Sam Leavitt shot
it in dark, reddish tones, and in
Cinemascope some of it is
startling—the crackling of the
searchlights outside the benefit
in the opening scene, Mason
alone on an elevator in the dimly
lit police precinct after he has
been picked up for drunk and
disorderly conduct, and the
famous suicide scene, which has
been evoked in a number of
more recent movies (notably
Play It Again, Sam and Robert
Altman's The Long Goodbye).
Cukor— who dieci last fall—did
some of his best work in these
film noir mood piece segments.
The central irony in the Star Is
Born saga is that, in each of the
three versions under that title,
the actor in the has-been role
has given a more impressive per
formance than the actress to
whose gifts the monumental pic
ture was ostensiblv erected. Ex
cept tor the well-directed fun
eral crowd scene (which comes
unsettlingly close to Nathanael
West), the only element of the
1937 Star worth remembering is
Fredric March, and Kris Kristof
ferson takes some real acting
risks in the 1976 version. In the
Cukor picture, lames Mason
shows us, in his first moments (a
drunken exhibition backstage at
the benefit), Norman Maine's
adolescent glee in destruction
and self-destruction, his wit, his
charm, his capacity for anger,
and his irreverent contempt for
the regulations of the industry
that supports him.
Mason's acting throughout
has precision, variation and in
vention; he takes the drenched,
gaudy set pieces—Norman at
the Academy Awards banquet,
Norman in the sanitarium, Nor

man in night court—as far as
they can go, and then finds
novel, inverted ways of getting
at the lines so that they sound
like nothing we've ever heard
before. When he sits down on
the steps of the Academy
Awards stage and tells the as
sembled princes and princesses
of Hollywood that he needs a
job, you don t giggle at the hok
mess of the melodrama, you
gasp at his audacity.
In a later scene, the cynical,
vengeful studio publicitv direc
tor Libby (jack Carson, in a role
played by Lionel Stander in the
Wellman version but expanded
by Moss Hart so that it makes
some dramatic sense) knocks a
reformed Norman down in a
racetrack bar, and the humilia
tion sends Norman on a fresh
bender; Mason gulps down a
glass of scotch and then presses
a clenched fist against his cheek
as if the force ot his hand might
propel the liquor into his system
with greater speed. It's an in
spired choice, ludy Garland's cult
performance has always had un
deniable power, but this mas
terly reconstruction job on
George Cukor's brooding, rivet
ing bad movie reminds us that it
was really lames Mason's star
that rose.

1937 Star worth remembering is
Fredric March, and Kris Kristof
ferson takes some real acting
risks in the 1976 version. In the
Cukor picture, lames Mason
shows us, in his first moments (a
drunken exhibition backstage at
the benefit), Norman Maine's
adolescent glee in destruction
and self-destruction, his wit, his
charm, his capacity for anger,
and his irreverent contempt for
the regulations of the industry
that supports him.
Mason's acting throughout
has precision, variation and in
vention; he takes the drenched,
gaudy set pieces—Norman at
the Academy Awards banquet,
Norman in the sanitarium, Nor

man in night court—as far as
they can go, and then finds
novel, inverted ways of getting
at the lines so that they sound
like nothing we've ever heard
before. When he sits down on
the steps of the Academy
Awards stage and tells the as
sembled princes and princesses
of Hollywood that he needs a
job, you don t giggle at the hok
mess of the melodrama, you
gasp at his audacity.
In a later scene, the cynical,
vengeful studio publicitv direc
tor Libby (jack Carson, in a role
played by Lionel Stander in the
Wellman version but expanded
by Moss Hart so that it makes
some dramatic sense) knocks a
reformed Norman down in a
racetrack bar, and the humilia
tion sends Norman on a fresh
bender; Mason gulps down a
glass of scotch and then presses
a clenched fist against his cheek
as if the force ot his hand might
propel the liquor into his system
with greater speed. It's an in
spired choice, ludy Garland's cult
performance has always had un
deniable power, but this mas
terly reconstruction job on
George Cukor's brooding, rivet

was really lames Mason's star

One of the favorite topics ot
conversation among movie
buffs in my undergraduate film
society days was the possibility
of rediscovering legendary
'"lost" footage—scenes that had
been cut from all copies of cer
tain movies before or im
mediately after their release like
most of Creed and the "litter
bug" number from The Wizard
of Oz and the two songs trom
the 1954 A Star /s Born, "Here's
What I'm Here For" and "Lose
That Long Face," that appear on
the soundtrack recording but
not on the widely shown 154-
minute print of the picture. We
used to joke that someday all the
footage we'd ever longed to see
would turn up in lack Warner's
home vault, where the Borrow
ers had stored it.
That wishtul joke is becoming
more and more a reality, now
that Kevin Brownlow has recon
structed most of Napoleon and
assembled a treasure trove of
Chaplin outtakes and rehearsal
scenes in a new documentary
compilation—and now that,
under the auspices ot the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences Foundation, Ron
Haver, film department chief at
the L A. County Museum has
dug up ! ( > r>; the 27 minutes
pared from A Star Is Born. Last
Saturday night, at Oakland's
Paramount Theater (itself a
flamboyant tribute to a glittering
pop cultural past), Haver and
Academy president Fay Kanin
presented an almost fully re
stored Star, with vanished
scenes approximated hv the in
tercutting of production stills
and live action remnants, lifted
to the original soundtrack.
(Sound and picture were pro
jected on separate reels, as they
had been at the 1954 premiere;
presumably a complete sound
track has always been available.)
Among the found footage are
full alternate takes of "Here's
What I'm Here For" and "Lose

112 hat Long Face. Furthermore,
Haver unearthed the original cut
release print, in Cinemascope,
Stereophonic Sound and dye
transfer three-strip Technicolor,
and wove the deleted sequences
and stills into it, so that today's
viewers can more nearly ap
proach the experience of the
opening night audience in Sep
tember of 1954 than anyone has
in the intervening 29 years.

A Star Is Born is a strange ani
mal. The story, of an alcoholic
actor who discovers a talented
young actress, launches her,
falls in love with her, and then
watches his own career eclipse
as hers skyrockets, has so much
visceral gossip-column appeal
that Hollywood has churned it
out four times. The first, unoffi
cial version, What Price Hol
lywood, based on a story by re

porter Adela Rogers St. John,
was directed by George Cukor in
1932, and featured Lowell Sher
man as the falling star and Con
stance Bennett as the rising one.
Dorothy Parker and her husband
Alan Campbell worked on the
rehash in 1937—the first edition
to be titled A Star Is Born; Wil
liam Wellman directed it in
Technicolor as a comeback veh
icle for Janet Gaynor, and Fred
ric March played the drunken
Norman Maine.
Cukor returned to the mate
rial in the '50s, when Warners,
employing a Moss Hart script
and a score by Harold Arlen and
Ira Gershwin, rebuilt it around
the talents of Judy Garland, and
James Mason, just beginning a
career in Hollywood, took the
role of Maine. Again, the picture

was a comeback of sorts for its
leading actress—due to health
and temperament problems,
Garland had lost three projects
in a row at M-G-M (Annie Get
Your Cun opposite Howard
Keel, The Barkleys of Broadway
and Royal Wedding opposite
Fred Astaire) and when the
movie was finally completed in
1954, after more than two years
of shooting and editing and a
great deal of adverse publicity,
she had been off the screen for
four years. In the most recent
version (Frank Pierson, 1976),
the setting was changed from
the film to the rock world, and
Barbra Streisand and Kris Kris
tofferson starred.
In each case, the actress cast
as the bright young star, Esther,
has been an established celeb
rity well beyond the age of
debut —in 1937 and 1954, a
celebrity staging a comeback.
Moss Hart's screenplay attempts
to justify Garland's age by giving
Esther a speech about the years
spent waitressing and touring
with bands, and the long "Born
in a Trunk" montage number
from Esther's first film for the
Oliver Niles Studio parallels it.
(Leonard Gershe's lyric makes
the point: "So I'm not what you'd
call 'overnight sensation'/For it
happened many years ago. . .")
But the material is shaped to
contrast blooming youth and
decaying, self-destructive mid
dle age, and Garland, whose pri
vate struggles were far closer to
Norman's than to Esther's, looks
puffy and wasted, the creases in
her face sharp and shiny,her hair
cut short so that she has a
weirdly mannish appearance in
some scenes—like a slightly
woozy Peter Pan. It hardly seems
possible that this run-through
t he-mi 11 ]udy Garland could have
grown out of the auburn-haired
ingenue of Meet Me in St. Louis
and The Clock and The Harvey
Girls. Her voice has changed,
too: it has already acquired the

ragged, sobbing tremolo at the
end of held notes that will be her
trademark when she plays to
worshipping crowds at Carnegie
Hall and The Palace in the early
'60s. Once once, briefly, in A Star
Is Born does her singing resem
ble the warm, sure vocals of her
M-G-M years—in "Melancholy
Baby," part of the ungainly, un
wieldy "Born In A Trunk" sequ
ence. (Cukor hated this medley,
which was not part of the com
missioned Arlen-Gershwin
score, and fought against its in
clusion. It's easy to see why, but
the number does have a hypno
tic fascination.) And she has
begun to put over her songs in
what would come to be called
the Garland style: intense, heav
ily weighted, a disturbing com
bination of no-holds-barred
masochistic torch singing and a
nakedly eager play for the ap
proval of her audience. Ibis ap
proach is particularly evident in
"The Man That Got Away,
which Esther sings with a small
band at a |azz club on Sunset
Strip after business hours. When
she reaches the crescendo at the
end of the penultimate verse—
"But fools will be fools And
where's he gone to?"—she steps
into close-up, gazing past the
musicians into a non-existent
crowd of admiring fans, and her
face is scarred yet smiling hope
fully, as if she were presenting
her own heartbreak for our de
lectation And that's in the first
half hour of the movie.

You may not care to watch this
kind of emotional striptease, but
you can't turn away. Technically,
her acting is terrible in almost all
of the film—she weeps through
every one of her dramatic
scenes, and she's rarely in con
trol of her performance. (Her
best moments are her funniest
ones—the take-off on Piaf in
"Someone at Last," and her
dry-eyed, wry response to Nor
man's proposal on the sound
stage, in the charming, long
buried "Here's What I'm Here
For" sequence.) But she's mes
merizing, in a way that lanet
Gaynor certainly wasn't—she
looked drab, with a tired twinkle
in her eyes — and Barbra
Streisand wasn t either, though
she sweated blood trying to be
and even gave herself a seven
minute close-up number at the
end in a doomed effort to recap
ture the magic of "My Man" at
the end of 112 unny Girl. And the
visual style of the production
underscores Garland's orgiastic
exhibitionism. Sam Leavitt shot
it in dark, reddish tones, and in
Cinemascope some of it is
startling—the crackling of the
searchlights outside the benefit
in the opening scene, Mason
alone on an elevator in the dimly
lit police precinct after he has
been picked up for drunk and
disorderly conduct, and the
famous suicide scene, which has
been evoked in a number of
more recent movies (notably
Play It Again, Sam and Robert
Altman's The Long Goodbye).
Cukor— who dieci last fall—did
some of his best work in these
film noir mood piece segments.
The central irony in the Star Is
Born saga is that, in each of the
three versions under that title,
the actor in the has-been role
has given a more impressive per
formance than the actress to
whose gifts the monumental pic
ture was ostensiblv erected. Ex
cept tor the well-directed fun
eral crowd scene (which comes
unsettlingly close to Nathanael
West), the only element of the
1937 Star worth remembering is
Fredric March, and Kris Kristof

trol of her performance. (Her
best moments are her funniest
ones—the take-off on Piaf in
"Someone at Last," and her
dry-eyed, wry response to Nor
man's proposal on the sound
stage, in the charming, long
buried "Here's What I'm Here
For" sequence.) But she's mes
merizing, in a way that lanet
Gaynor certainly wasn't—she
looked drab, with a tired twinkle
in her eyes — and Barbra
Streisand wasn t either, though
she sweated blood trying to be
and even gave herself a seven
minute close-up number at the
end in a doomed effort to recap
ture the magic of "My Man" at
the end of 112 unny Girl. And the
visual style of the production
underscores Garland's orgiastic
exhibitionism. Sam Leavitt shot
it in dark, reddish tones, and in
Cinemascope some of it is
startling—the crackling of the
searchlights outside the benefit
in the opening scene, Mason
alone on an elevator in the dimly
lit police precinct after he has
been picked up for drunk and
disorderly conduct, and the
famous suicide scene, which has
been evoked in a number of
more recent movies (notably
Play It Again, Sam and Robert
Altman's The Long Goodbye).
Cukor— who dieci last fall—did
some of his best work in these
film noir mood piece segments.
The central irony in the Star Is
Born saga is that, in each of the
three versions under that title,
the actor in the has-been role
has given a more impressive per
formance than the actress to
whose gifts the monumental pic
ture was ostensiblv erected. Ex
cept tor the well-directed fun
eral crowd scene (which comes
unsettlingly close to Nathanael
West), the only element of the
1937 Star worth remembering is
Fredric March, and Kris Kristof
ferson takes some real acting
risks in the 1976 version. In the
Cukor picture, lames Mason
shows us, in his first moments (a
drunken exhibition backstage at
the benefit), Norman Maine's
adolescent glee in destruction
and self-destruction, his wit, his
charm, his capacity for anger,
and his irreverent contempt for
the regulations of the industry
that supports him.
Mason's acting throughout
has precision, variation and in
vention; he takes the drenched,
gaudy set pieces—Norman at
the Academy Awards banquet,
Norman in the sanitarium, Nor

man in night court—as far as
they can go, and then finds
novel, inverted ways of getting
at the lines so that they sound
like nothing we've ever heard
before. When he sits down on
the steps of the Academy
Awards stage and tells the as
sembled princes and princesses
of Hollywood that he needs a
job, you don t giggle at the hok
mess of the melodrama, you
gasp at his audacity.
In a later scene, the cynical,
vengeful studio publicitv direc
tor Libby (jack Carson, in a role
played by Lionel Stander in the
Wellman version but expanded
by Moss Hart so that it makes
some dramatic sense) knocks a
reformed Norman down in a
racetrack bar, and the humilia
tion sends Norman on a fresh
bender; Mason gulps down a
glass of scotch and then presses
a clenched fist against his cheek
as if the force ot his hand might
propel the liquor into his system
with greater speed. It's an in
spired choice, ludy Garland's cult
performance has always had un
deniable power, but this mas
terly reconstruction job on
George Cukor's brooding, rivet
ing bad movie reminds us that it
was really lames Mason's star
that rose.
One of the favorite topics ot
conversation among movie
buffs in my undergraduate film
society days was the possibility
of rediscovering legendary
'"lost" footage—scenes that had
been cut from all copies of cer
tain movies before or im
mediately after their release like
most of Creed and the "litter
bug" number from The Wizard
of Oz and the two songs trom
the 1954 A Star /s Born, "Here's
What I'm Here For" and "Lose
That Long Face," that appear on
the soundtrack recording but
not on the widely shown 154-
minute print of the picture. We
used to joke that someday all the
footage we'd ever longed to see
would turn up in lack Warner's
home vault, where the Borrow
ers had stored it.
That wishtul joke is becoming
more and more a reality, now
that Kevin Brownlow has recon
structed most of Napoleon and
assembled a treasure trove of
Chaplin outtakes and rehearsal
scenes in a new documentary
compilation—and now that,
under the auspices ot the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences Foundation, Ron
Haver, film department chief at
the L A. County Museum has
dug up ! ( > r>; the 27 minutes
pared from A Star Is Born. Last
Saturday night, at Oakland's
Paramount Theater (itself a
flamboyant tribute to a glittering
pop cultural past), Haver and
Academy president Fay Kanin
presented an almost fully re
stored Star, with vanished
scenes approximated hv the in
tercutting of production stills
and live action remnants, lifted
to the original soundtrack.
(Sound and picture were pro
jected on separate reels, as they
had been at the 1954 premiere;
presumably a complete sound
track has always been available.)
Among the found footage are
full alternate takes of "Here's
What I'm Here For" and "Lose

112 hat Long Face. Furthermore,
Haver unearthed the original cut
release print, in Cinemascope,
Stereophonic Sound and dye
transfer three-strip Technicolor,
and wove the deleted sequences
and stills into it, so that today's
viewers can more nearly ap
proach the experience of the
opening night audience in Sep
tember of 1954 than anyone has
in the intervening 29 years.

A Star Is Born is a strange ani
mal. The story, of an alcoholic
actor who discovers a talented
young actress, launches her,
falls in love with her, and then
watches his own career eclipse
as hers skyrockets, has so much
visceral gossip-column appeal
that Hollywood has churned it
out four times. The first, unoffi
cial version, What Price Hol
lywood, based on a story by re

porter Adela Rogers St. John,
was directed by George Cukor in
1932, and featured Lowell Sher
man as the falling star and Con
stance Bennett as the rising one.
Dorothy Parker and her husband
Alan Campbell worked on the
rehash in 1937—the first edition
to be titled A Star Is Born; Wil
liam Wellman directed it in
Technicolor as a comeback veh
icle for Janet Gaynor, and Fred
ric March played the drunken
Norman Maine.
Cukor returned to the mate
rial in the '50s, when Warners,
employing a Moss Hart script
and a score by Harold Arlen and
Ira Gershwin, rebuilt it around
the talents of Judy Garland, and
James Mason, just beginning a
career in Hollywood, took the
role of Maine. Again, the picture

was a comeback of sorts for its
leading actress—due to health
and temperament problems,
Garland had lost three projects
in a row at M-G-M (Annie Get
Your Cun opposite Howard
Keel, The Barkleys of Broadway
and Royal Wedding opposite
Fred Astaire) and when the
movie was finally completed in
1954, after more than two years
of shooting and editing and a
great deal of adverse publicity,
she had been off the screen for
four years. In the most recent
version (Frank Pierson, 1976),
the setting was changed from
the film to the rock world, and
Barbra Streisand and Kris Kris
tofferson starred.
In each case, the actress cast
as the bright young star, Esther,
has been an established celeb
rity well beyond the age of
debut —in 1937 and 1954, a
celebrity staging a comeback.
Moss Hart's screenplay attempts
to justify Garland's age by giving
Esther a speech about the years
spent waitressing and touring
with bands, and the long "Born
in a Trunk" montage number
from Esther's first film for the
Oliver Niles Studio parallels it.
(Leonard Gershe's lyric makes
the point: "So I'm not what you'd
call 'overnight sensation'/For it
happened many years ago. . .")
But the material is shaped to
contrast blooming youth and
decaying, self-destructive mid
dle age, and Garland, whose pri
vate struggles were far closer to
Norman's than to Esther's, looks
puffy and wasted, the creases in
her face sharp and shiny,her hair
cut short so that she has a
weirdly mannish appearance in
some scenes—like a slightly
woozy Peter Pan. It hardly seems
possible that this run-through
t he-mi 11 ]udy Garland could have
grown out of the auburn-haired
ingenue of Meet Me in St. Louis
and The Clock and The Harvey
Girls. Her voice has changed,
too: it has already acquired the

ragged, sobbing tremolo at the
end of held notes that will be her
trademark when she plays to
worshipping crowds at Carnegie
Hall and The Palace in the early
'60s. Once once, briefly, in A Star
Is Born does her singing resem
ble the warm, sure vocals of her
M-G-M years—in "Melancholy
Baby," part of the ungainly, un
wieldy "Born In A Trunk" sequ
ence. (Cukor hated this medley,
which was not part of the com
missioned Arlen-Gershwin
score, and fought against its in
clusion. It's easy to see why, but
the number does have a hypno
tic fascination.) And she has
begun to put over her songs in
what would come to be called
the Garland style: intense, heav
ily weighted, a disturbing com
bination of no-holds-barred
masochistic torch singing and a
nakedly eager play for the ap
proval of her audience. Ibis ap
proach is particularly evident in
"The Man That Got Away,
which Esther sings with a small
band at a |azz club on Sunset
Strip after business hours. When
she reaches the crescendo at the
end of the penultimate verse—
"But fools will be fools And
where's he gone to?"—she steps
into close-up, gazing past the
musicians into a non-existent
crowd of admiring fans, and her
face is scarred yet smiling hope
fully, as if she were presenting
her own heartbreak for our de
lectation And that's in the first
half hour of the movie.

You may not care to watch this
kind of emotional striptease, but
you can't turn away. Technically,
her acting is terrible in almost all
of the film—she weeps through
every one of her dramatic
scenes, and she's rarely in con
trol of her performance. (Her
best moments are her funniest
ones—the take-off on Piaf in
"Someone at Last," and her
dry-eyed, wry response to Nor
man's proposal on the sound
stage, in the charming, long
buried "Here's What I'm Here
For" sequence.) But she's mes
