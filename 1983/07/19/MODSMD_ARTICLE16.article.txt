# Romeo Void, RX open the Wolfgang
## 
### ANDY LISAC 
Backstage at Wolfgang's Fri
day night, amidst the catered
cold cuts, imported beers, and
broken down furniture,
saxophonist Ben Bossi of Romeo
Void wandered the stark hall
ways in a state of dazzlement. In
a similar condition, lead singer
Debora lyall lay slumped on a
couch, visibly exhausted. Out
side in the clear North Beach air,
music fans and car hops alike sat
on the sidewalk to cool down
and draw a few breaths before
proceeding to wind down the
evening.
For everyone concerned, it
had been a night best described
in superlatives: charismatic, bril
liant, hypnotic. And regardless
of what Bill Graham had billed as
the opening of his new club sev
eral weeks earlier, this night was
the musical event which could in
retrospect be called the opening
of Wolfgang's. From the absorb
ing reverberations of the Dream
Syndicate (reviewed elsewhere)
to the ecstatic riffs of RX, avant
garde musit fans got what they
came for: a heady blend of
none-too-serious but very origi
nal post-punk dance music.
It was Romeo Void's show,
however, and the adrenalin was
there from the beginning. Void

opened with the tight rocker
"Shake the Hands of Time,"
which left no doubt in my mind
that the Void and its audience
were joined in an alliance of sen
sual motion. For the next hour
and a half, we were treated to
athletic sax solos, driving bass
lines, mutated disco drum work,
and the trademark poetic lyrics,
half sung and half chanted, by
lead singer Debora lyall.
There were no problems in
pacing this night. Saxophonist
Bossi had reported before the
show that the band had felt
hemmed-in by the deliberate
sit-down-and-listen atmosphere
of the previous night's concert,
and had tried to arrange the
material differently for the Fri
day show. The result was a stun
ning mixture of pure dance
music, meditative think pieces,
songs highlighting lyall's voice,
or Bossi's sax, or Peter Woods
guitar work, some well
practiced variations on their
own musical themes, and quite a
few new pieces
What Romeo Void ac
complished was a textbook les
son in pacing live music for a
dance hall. In the big band era of
the 1940s and 19505, musical
greats like Tommy Dorsey and
BennyGoodman knew the value

ot creating a special stylistic
sound and then adapting it to
songs of varying moods and
emotional ranges. Later, con
certs such as Woodstock re
placed the notion of audience
participation through dancing
with the idea that concert par
ticipation came through listen
ing, and greats such as Ji mi Hen
drix and Santana put their im
provisational mark on modern
live music.
With bands like Romeo Void,
the Talking Heads and the
Motels, however, we see in
1980s live music a return to the
big band days of yesteryear. The
focus during concerts has re
turned to how well the audience
is moving, rather than how well
the musicians are creating. What
the Void achieved was a pace
which came across as one very
talented band doing a live ver
sion of all the dam e numbers at
the l-Beam or the Oasis. There
were no breaks, only changes in
moods and postures. Songs
blended into each other. There
was minimal conversation bet
ween band and audience be
cause in the Void' 1 - case, com
munication happens through
I he fragmented lyrics.
During this 90-minute sweaty
workout, saxoohomst Bossi kent

up tiis infectious good humor
and energy. Singer lyall was a bit
more subdued than I have seen
her, but her voice has never
been tmer, and her repertoire of
expressions both vocally and
visually was always fresh.
Guitarists Woods and Zincavage
obviously enjoyed working with
their new drummer, Aaron
Smith, and Woods in particular
seems to be right on top of
things these days and quite
self-assured in his musicianship.
I suspect that those of you
who have heard Romeo Void be
fore have caught them on
album-oriented stations such as
KFOG, the Quake, on a college
station or in one of the many San
Francisco dance clubs. Based on
the strength and sheer sustained
energy of Friday's Wolfgang's
show, however, be prepared to
see them make it big.
Opening for Romeo Void and
the Dream Syndicate was the
saxophone-dominated band RX.
I had heard them described be
forehand as something like Flip
per before they take Quaaludes,
which seemed to me a reasona
ble evaluation of their style. This
is a sophisticated jazz-rock
band, however, and guitarist
lerry Antonious told me after
wards that he and bassist Chris

Cunningham, who also play with
James White and the Blacks, had
just finished some studio work
with other bands in I os Angeles
before coming on tour. With the
staccato vocals, punk de
meanors and slinky guitar riffs,
KX sounded like chaos at times,
and funky-punk at other times,
but they somehow pulled it off
with good variations and profes
sional ease.
The real star of course is
Daniel Lauter, who plays various
saxophones and flutes. I get
used to hearing pretty lousy
opening acts at the clubs, but I
was impressed almost im
mediately by group leader Lau
ter's control beneath the manic
sax lines, screaming self-parody
and explosive energy. Sure this
stuff is frenetic, but that is un
derstandable when you see Lau
ter both sing and solo on several
instruments all in the same song,
and seemingly, all at the same
time. Even the slower songs, and
these are pitched at the tempo of
a fast rock and roll song, have a
lot of layered texture. This was
good foot stomping music to
start a great evening, and RX
succeeded in capturing the at
tention of another band's fans,
and getting them on their feet to
dance.
