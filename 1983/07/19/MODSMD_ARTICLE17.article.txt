# Return to the man and his guitar: John Denver live
## 
### REBECCA ZEIGLER 
"I would like to make this
as intimate as possible with
8500 people." These were the
words of John Denver last
Tuesday to a crowd frying in
the 100-plus degree heat. And
before long, Denver had ac
complished this goal: The
Concord Pavillion became
one large campfire circle,
aglow with song and senti
ment.
Tuesday's crowd did not fit
the stereotypical concert
goers mold, nor the antici
pated pot-smoking "left-over
'60s" group. Instead, one
might describe it as Walt Dis
ney's dream: a polite audi
ence spanning the ages of
eight to 80 from all walks of
life united by a common de
sire to listen to and be re
freshingly entertained by an
evening with lohn Denver.
And they did not go home
disappointed.
For three hours, Denver fil
led the stage alone, without
any back-up, without his"
trademark wire frame glas
ses. His decision in this
seven-week U.S. tour to re
turn to the honest "me and
my guitar" approach is wise;
Denver's music is simply not
geared for additional accom

paniments which might dis
tract from, rather than com
plement, his clear voice.
Strumming on his six and
12 string guitars, he alter
nated between sing-along,
we 11-known favorites and
debut tunes on his forthcom
ing album It's About Time.
Included in this new material
is a recently released duet
with Emmy Lou Harris titled
"The Wild Montana Skies,"
more upbeat than usual De
nver, but still in Rocky Moun
tain style. Despite shouted
requests as the evening prog
ressed, one selection was ob
viously missing—the knee
slappin' "Thank Cod I'm a
Country Boy."
After a well-deserved in
termission, Denver opened
with "Country Roads," and I
was expecting more of the
same. But then the concert
took a subtly different turn.
Denver began introducing
his songs with simultane
ously humorous and grave
anecdotes and poems, stres
sing the prevention of al
cohol abuse, hunger and war.
He preceded a new song,
"I Want To Live," by sharing
his experience serving on the
commission for the Hunger
Project. He made his public

piano debut on a concert
grand which ruled the stage
after relating an embarrassing
piano tale. This transforma
tion from performer to con
fidante culminated in "An
nie's Song," a memory of his
ex-wife that proved difficult
for )ohn. Halfway through,
the lone figure fell to his
knees pleading, "Please . . .
sing this one with me."
Eighty-five-hundred
people sang along.
After a lengthy ovation,
(even those reclining on the
lawn got up) Denver returned
with the title song of his new
album, "It's About Time," a
tune which shows a shift in
content of his songs from
themes of nature and love to
those of peace and humanity.
I hen John Denver shared a
poem that he wrote this
spring for a Colorado peace
convention which he had
helped organize.
Somehow, that evening's
combination of a starry sum
mer night, relaxing on the
grass, and swaying and sing
ing to the sweet sounds of
"Sunshine on my Shoul
ders," "Follow Me," or
"Rocky Mountain High" had
the same mesmerizing effects
as the flames of a campfire.
