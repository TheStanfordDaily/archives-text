# New bands provide party in Berkeley
## 
### ERIC POSTEL 
Were you there? I know some
of you were because I saw some
of those red Stanford sweat
shirts out in the crowd. Last Fri
day night, Bill Graham pre
sented a dance party under the
stars at the Creek Theater in
Berkeley with The Fixx, Berlin
and A Flock of Seagulls, and
dance we did.
The Fixx opened the show and
was greeted by a very enthusias
tic, generally teen-aged crowd.
The band proved very adept at
translating its studio sounds into
a live performance. Over the
course of their short set, the
band ran through solid rendi
tions of their better known
songs. The crowd liked what
they heard, and brought the
band out for what was clearly an
unplanned encore.
Then came Berlin. The band
played to a very small crowd at
the Kabuki Theater this spring,
but based on the ovation that
greeted their entrance, Berlin
has certainly gained a lot more
fans since then. The loudest
cheer was saved for the lead
vocalist and sex symbol, Terri
Nunn.
It was clear that the audience
had quite a few expectations
about the show to follow, prin
cipally based on the lyrics of the
band's biggest single, "Sex (I'm
a . . Berlin's synthesizer
based music, primarily written
by synthesizer player )ohn Craw
ford, also the oldest member of
the group (26), is not terribly in
novative. In fact, several of Fri
day night's songs sounded alike.
Nevertheless, the repetitious
rhythms were easy to dance to,
and quite a few members of the

audience (mainly the female
members) did so.
The loudest ovations were gi
ven, not for the music however,
but for the waif-like Terri Nunn
and her theatrics. The first ova
tion was given for her banging
the heck out of a cymbal on the
drum kit, and the second for her
sexually explicit poses during
"Sex." The poses were clearly
expected by everyone at the
Creek, and on the surface would
seem to be just teen-aged fan
tasies (though she is 22 years
old). In the past, Terri Nunn has
attempted to downplay the sex
ual significance of "Sex" by say
ing that the song is really trying
to talk about the many roles
women play. However, Friday
night she clearly filled only the
role of sex object (her singing is
not too hot).
Onstage, she said she was
surprised at the band's degree of
success, but I hope that Nunn
knows the truth. Her band's
success is based on her being a
sexual object and their sexually
explicit lyrics, as opposed to
being a wonderfully musical
band. I hope they all enjoy being

stars and save their money be
cause novelty acts never last too
long.
Quite a few members of the
audience were entertained, so
in that sense, Berlin's appear
ance was successful; let's just
hope all those teenagers under
stand that most women fill other
roles as well (a point echoed by
Romeo Void's Debora lyall in
Tuesday's Daily). Berlin's per
formance was a prime example
of pop culture providing es
capism in response to apathy
and alienation in the most
exploitive of ways.
If The Fixx and Berlin got a few
people dancing, it was the music
played during the final set
change that really got people
moving. Watching the Greek
Theater sway to The Police, David
Bowie, Ultravox, and finally
Prince, one could not help but
realize that the successful pop
music of the last two years is al
most excusively dance music.
A Flock of Seagulls came on
with the swirl of "dry-ice fog"
and some nice light work. Now,
everyone was up and dancing,
and we never stopped. One year
ago this summer, the band
played the relatively small Keys
toneclubs in the Bay Area. Head
lining the Greek proves how far

they have come and how ac
ceptable new music has become
(see the cover stories in this
week's Time).
Of all the current
synthesizer-based bands playing
these days, the Seagulls have
made the most consistently
danceable tunes. Their songs do
sound different. On stage, the
Liverpool-based band maintains
a high energy level, and clearly
like to be playing to a lively,
dancing crowd. Paul Reynolds
was the star musician ot the
evening with his hot guitar work.
Lead vocalist Mike Score sang
well and was clearly the teen
fave with his hair and cloths
styles. However. I did wonder
how much of the band is a studio
creation since they were obvi
ously playing to pre-recorded
tapes at several points during
the show.
Nevertheless, everyone had a
great time dancing during the
almost 90-minute show. Maybe
these three bands aren't in
novators, but not every group
can be. This was a night of enter
taining "new music" which is
just a new version of old pop and
old disco. But who cares about
labels and categories on a Friday
night in the middle of the sum
mer.

vocalist and sex symbol, Terri
Nunn.
It was clear that the audience
had quite a few expectations
about the show to follow, prin
cipally based on the lyrics of the
band's biggest single, "Sex (I'm
a . . Berlin's synthesizer
based music, primarily written
by synthesizer player )ohn Craw
ford, also the oldest member of
the group (26), is not terribly in
novative. In fact, several of Fri
day night's songs sounded alike.
Nevertheless, the repetitious
rhythms were easy to dance to,
and quite a few members of the

audience (mainly the female
members) did so.
The loudest ovations were gi
ven, not for the music however,
but for the waif-like Terri Nunn
and her theatrics. The first ova
tion was given for her banging
the heck out of a cymbal on the
drum kit, and the second for her
sexually explicit poses during
"Sex." The poses were clearly
expected by everyone at the
Creek, and on the surface would
seem to be just teen-aged fan
tasies (though she is 22 years
old). In the past, Terri Nunn has
attempted to downplay the sex
ual significance of "Sex" by say
ing that the song is really trying
to talk about the many roles
women play. However, Friday
night she clearly filled only the
role of sex object (her singing is
not too hot).
Onstage, she said she was
surprised at the band's degree of
success, but I hope that Nunn
knows the truth. Her band's
success is based on her being a
sexual object and their sexually
explicit lyrics, as opposed to
being a wonderfully musical
band. I hope they all enjoy being

stars and save their money be
cause novelty acts never last too
long.
Quite a few members of the
audience were entertained, so
in that sense, Berlin's appear
ance was successful; let's just
hope all those teenagers under
stand that most women fill other
roles as well (a point echoed by
Romeo Void's Debora lyall in
Tuesday's Daily). Berlin's per
formance was a prime example
of pop culture providing es
capism in response to apathy
and alienation in the most
exploitive of ways.
If The Fixx and Berlin got a few
people dancing, it was the music
played during the final set
change that really got people
moving. Watching the Greek
Theater sway to The Police, David
Bowie, Ultravox, and finally
Prince, one could not help but
realize that the successful pop
music of the last two years is al
most excusively dance music.
A Flock of Seagulls came on
with the swirl of "dry-ice fog"
and some nice light work. Now,
everyone was up and dancing,
and we never stopped. One year
ago this summer, the band
played the relatively small Keys
toneclubs in the Bay Area. Head
lining the Greek proves how far

they have come and how ac
ceptable new music has become
(see the cover stories in this
week's Time).
Of all the current
synthesizer-based bands playing
these days, the Seagulls have
made the most consistently
danceable tunes. Their songs do
sound different. On stage, the
Liverpool-based band maintains
a high energy level, and clearly
like to be playing to a lively,
dancing crowd. Paul Reynolds
was the star musician ot the
evening with his hot guitar work.
Lead vocalist Mike Score sang
well and was clearly the teen
fave with his hair and cloths
styles. However. I did wonder
how much of the band is a studio
creation since they were obvi
ously playing to pre-recorded
tapes at several points during
the show.
Nevertheless, everyone had a
great time dancing during the
almost 90-minute show. Maybe
these three bands aren't in
novators, but not every group
can be. This was a night of enter
taining "new music" which is
just a new version of old pop and
old disco. But who cares about
labels and categories on a Friday
night in the middle of the sum
mer.
