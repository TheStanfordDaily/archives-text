# Tuition credit plan in jeopardy
## 
### RICKY SPEAR 
In light of the Supreme
Court's recent Mueller vs.
Allen decision, President
Reagan's tuition tax plan — if
passed — is likely to be de
clared unconstitutional, ac
cording to a research as
sociate at Stanford's Institute
for Research on Educational
Finance and Government.
According to Donald Jen
sen, the recent Supreme
Court decision in favor of
Minnesota's tax law — which
allows parents to reduce
taxes by up to $700 for ex
penses related to education
— paints legal warning signs
for Reagan's controversial
proposal.
lensen states that if these
warning signs are heeded,
the Reagan administration
will restructure its tuition tax
proposal.
"What will probably hap
pen is that Reagan will now
step back and modify the plan
in order to avoid all the legal
problems to begin with," he
said.
If passed as presently writ
ten, Reagan's plan would
provide credits up to $300 for
qualified families.
Implications of the passing
of such a bill are unclear. In
theory, the $300 (starting in
1985, that would be the
maximum grant) available to
parents whose children at
tend private schools would
increase such schools' en
rollment.
Because of the social
homogeneity in Minnesota
communities and schools,
the impact on enrollment was
small. Jensen reasons this
might not be the case in city
environments such as San

Francisco, New York and Los
Angeles.
Given a socially, racially or
ethnically diverse school dis
trict, the tuition tax credit
may provide parents with the
incentive to enroll their chil
dren in private schools.
Jensen points out that if the
Minnesota case is used as
legal precedence, Reagan's
tax credit plan will probably
be found by the majority of
the court as violating the first
amendment's freedom of re
ligion clause.

The Minnesota tax law be
nefits both parents of public
and private school students.
Reagan's plan provides tax
credits only for parents of
private schoolchildren.
Because most private
schools are sectarian, lensen
reasons that "a bill (such as
Reagan's) channeling credits
only to private schools would
not be considered to have a
secular purpose. This violates
the legal test used in Mueller
vs. Allen."
Thurgood Marshall, a dis

senting justice in Mueller vs.
Allen, called the Minnesota
double benefit a "distinction
without a difference" be
cause in effect, says Jensen,
"most of the private schools
in Minnesota are religiously
affiliated."
Also, the Reagan plan's call
for a tax credit and not a tax
deduction may be important.
The Minnesota plan provided
tax deductions. Jensen
reasons that this difference is
significant because the Sup
reme Court in the past has
made a "semantic distinction
between direct grants and tax
deductions."
Yet he also acknowledges
that the plan may never face
any legal battle if it cannot
win the legal battle facing it in
Congress.
When asked whether a re
elected Reagan might pack
the Supreme Court with jus
tices that favored his ideolog
ical leanings, Jensen re
sponded that the"court
rarely overturns precedent"
and that "if Reagan appoints a
philosophically akin judge,
he may not use education but
rather an issue such as abor
tion as a test case."
The Mueller decision was
decided 5 to 4, with justices
from what is often called the
liberal side voting against the
ruling. Jensen cautions a
gainst overusing the li
beral/conservative dicho
tomy.
"It can at times be over
simplified, as other patterns
may be seen in the decisions
of the court. The issue in
volved may be more closely
related to federalism versus
states rights in the minds of
the justices."
