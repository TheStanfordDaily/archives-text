# 'Bands' depicts '80s conflict
## 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
What's left of the lifestyle of
the rebellious youth of the '60s
clashes with thevaluesofthe re
bellious youth of the '80s in the
Magic Theatre's production of
Nancy Garrett's Playing in Local
Bands. The main problem with
director Nancy Gabor's produc
tion is that occasionally this
theme is emphasized so much
that the dialogue becomes a
forced social discussion: the
two main characters lose their
own identities and become
merely representations of their
respective eras.
However, the production re
bounds from these occasional
lapses midway through the sec
ond half. By the time the drama
tic climax is reached, the charac
ters regain their personal iden
tities, allowing the audience to
sympathize with the lead, lames
Donne, as he goes through a
brief catharsis.
James — a 39-year-old poet
trying to hold on to the loose,
casual values he adopted as a
youth of the '60s — is played
masterfully by Cab Covay. The
play opens with Donne celebrat
ing his 39th birthday with some
equally mellow and laidback
contemporaries. However, one
of the friends — Monique, who
James is trying to maintain a rela
tionship with — turns out to be
not so casual.
She demands that lames be
more monogamous than he is
willing to be or has ever been.
Without that type of commit
ment from him, she wants to

break up the affair. However,
James wants to continue the re
lationship on casual, non
binding terms that will allow him
to develop and maintain other
relationships at the same time.
At the party he tries to renew his
old affair with Shanti, the pretty
blonde married to Roger, with
whom he has also had an affair.
This causes Monique to leave his
apartment.
It is against this background
that Kendra Wilson, the 15-
year-old punk rocker with a blue
Mohawk, arrives at his apart
ment drunk and stoned and in
sisting that James is her father.
Her evidence is a poem that he
read to her high school English
class that afternoon about mak
ing love to a woman at
Woodstock in 1965 who, like her
mother, had a butterfly tattooed
to her leg.
The rest of the play allows
both Kendra and James to tell
their stories, while Kendra pre
sents more and more convincing
evidence that James is her
father.
Kendra, played by Tracy Cro
nin, is full of the hostility and
anger of the punk generations of
the '80s. Although the role of
Kendra is a demanding one to
play, at times Cronin gives a less
than adequate performance.
Her insistence upon constantly
being in motion — either run
ning around the stage or moving
her legs — and her overacting
reduce the character to much
less than it could be.

terior, in addition to her appa
rent vulnerability, provide a nice
set of the contrasting emotions
common to adolescents. Rut the
kind of values she embodies
represents a small minority ol
the angry youth of the '80s, while
the ideals lames clings to were
much more pervasive in his
youth in the '60s.
Still, the play does a fine job of
portraying the aging of what was
once a hip, alternative lifestyle
and of posing a conflict between
that way ot life and the modern
version of an alternative lifes
tyle. At the same time it eventu
ally accomplishes the task of de
picting the characters as people
and not just symbols.
