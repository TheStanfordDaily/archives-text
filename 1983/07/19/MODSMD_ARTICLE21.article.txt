Kissinger to head panel
Washington — Henry Kissinger will be
named by President Reagan to head the
administration's new blue-ribbon, bipar
tisan commission that will study a wide
range of economic and military options
tor the United States in Central America,
administration officials said Sunday
night.
Kissinger met with high administration
officials at the White House late last
week. A formal proposal recommending
his appointment was drawn up by Na
tional Security Adviser William Clark on
Saturday and approved by the president
over the weekend, administration
sources said.
Kissinger, former secretary of state and
national security adviser to presidents
Nixon and Ford, has been used by the
Reagan administration as an unofficial
adviser on several occasions. But his ap
pointment to head the Central America
commission would be his first formal ap
pointment from Reagan.
During the 1976 Republican presiden
tial primary, Reagan was a bitter critic of
Kissinger, whom he accused of master
minding the "giveaway" of the Panama
Canal. Some conservative Reagan sup
porters still view Kissinger with marked
distrust.
However, Kissinger increasingly has
gained stature among administration
foreign policy advisers, including Clark
and Secretary of State George Shultz. Kis
singer has been consulted on issues such
as the Middle East and the MX missile
deployment.
Carter speaks on papers
Tokyo — Former President Carter said
yesterday that he did not believe that the
theft of his briefing papers for a 1980 tele
vision debate with President Reagan
"would be the kind of issue that will pre
vent his (Reagan's) running for re
election, nor should it be."
However, Carter, who arrived in Tokyo
to seek lapanese funds for a Carter library
at Emory University in Atlanta, called the
theft of his papers "a very serious mat
ter."
Carter was asked in a television inter
view if he thought that Reagan should
assume "ethical responsibility" for the
theft and therefore not seek re-election.
"I don't think this would be the kind of
issue that will prevent his running for re
election, nor should it be," the former
president said. "The American people, I
think, are interested in knowing to what
degree they were misled by the debate.
Was it fair? Was itan honest debate?. .

"I think that President Reagan has now,
with the focus of attention on it, directed
his people to carry out that investigation
adequately. At first, he said it was of no
consequence but I think that now he sees
it's a very serious matter."
Police hold terrorist suspects
Paris — French police detained 51 sus
pected Armenian activists yesterday and
confiscated weapons and explosives fol
lowing Friday's terrorist bombing at Orly
Airport that killed six people, including
one American, and injured 55.
An Interior Ministry spokesman said
the Armenians were detained because
they could have information about the
Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation
of Armenia, which has claimed responsi
bility for Friday's blast and a string of
other terrorist acts in Europe and North
America. .
The Orly Airport bombing has focused
attention here on one of the most intract
able of Middle East problems. The Secret
Army was founded in 1975 to avenge what
it describes as the massacre of about 1.5
million Armenians in Turkey during
World War I, an event TurkisFi officials
describe as an invention of Armenian
propagandists.
The Orly Airport bombing was
promptly condemned by leading Arme
nian emigre organizations. A spokesman
for the right-wing Tashnak Party de
scribed the bombing as an "act of blind
terrorism" and charged that the Secret
Army had become "an instrument of the
Soviet Union" from its base in Syria.
The Tashnak spokesman said that the
use of France as a site for terrorist attacks
could either mean that negotiations for
an accomodation between the French
government and the Secret Army had
failed or that the terrorists were being
used by "other governments" to de
stabilize France.
Psychic may have sex tapes
Los Angeles — A man who says he's a
psychic claimed yesterday that model
Vicki Morgan gave him a videotape of
politicians at a sex party, and said the
politicians conspired to "have her si
lenced."
Ernesto Montgomery failed to produce
the tape, however, saying he had mailed
it to Clifford Linedecker, a reporter for
the National Examiner tabloid in Florida.
Linedecker said yesterday from West
Palm Beach, Fla., that he had not received
the purported tape.

Montgomery said at a news conference
he had been advising Morgan, who was
considering dropping her attempts at a
modeling or acting career.
"Based on what my client (Morgan)
said, and my dreams ... I am of the opin
ion there are more copies of the tape/'
said Montgomery, 56, who leads the Uni
versal Metaphysical Church.
Montgomery said Morgan's statements
and his "God-given insight" convinced
him the tape could touch off a scandal.
Attorneys Robert Steinberg and Marvin
Mitchelson also have claimed the exis
tence of tapes of Morgan and other
women cavorting with government offi
cials, prominent businessmen and Alfred
Bloomingdale, a department store heir
and member of President Reagan's
"kitchen cabinet" of advisers.
No evidence of the tapes' existence has
been produced.
China pledges equality
Peking — Communist China's top
leader has pledged to give Taiwan au
thorities an "equal footing" in rimrrThg
the nation once they agree to reincorpo
rate the breakaway island, the state-run
news agency reported last night.
The pledge by Deng Xiaoping appears
to amplify Peking's two-year-old offer to
assign nationalist Chinese officials on
Taiwan an unspecified leadership role in
a reunified country and to guarantee their
right to retain the island's capitalist
economy and armed forces.
Nationalist leaders who fled the main
land after the communist takeover in 1949
have rejected the offer as a trick to lull
them into a deal that would at best render
them powerless provincial officials.
Deng, who heads China's powerful
military and controls the politburo's elite
standing committee, said Peking is so an
xious to achieve national unity it is willing
to "give full consideration to terms that
Taiwan can accept."
Deng's urgent tone reflects the fears of
China's aged communist hierarchy that
the prospects for reunification greatly
dim as they and their nationalist contem
poraries in Taipei give way to a younger
generation that may have less personal
commi f ment to a unified country.
The overture is unlikely to attract sup
port among nationalist authorities who
have called on Peking to renounce com
munism as a condition for reunification.

China pledges equality
Peking — Communist China's top
leader has pledged to give Taiwan au
thorities an "equal footing" in rimrrThg
the nation once they agree to reincorpo
rate the breakaway island, the state-run
news agency reported last night.
The pledge by Deng Xiaoping appears
to amplify Peking's two-year-old offer to
assign nationalist Chinese officials on
Taiwan an unspecified leadership role in
a reunified country and to guarantee their
right to retain the island's capitalist
economy and armed forces.
Nationalist leaders who fled the main
land after the communist takeover in 1949
have rejected the offer as a trick to lull
them into a deal that would at best render
them powerless provincial officials.
Deng, who heads China's powerful
military and controls the politburo's elite
standing committee, said Peking is so an
xious to achieve national unity it is willing
to "give full consideration to terms that
Taiwan can accept."
Deng's urgent tone reflects the fears of
China's aged communist hierarchy that
the prospects for reunification greatly
dim as they and their nationalist contem
poraries in Taipei give way to a younger
generation that may have less personal
commi f ment to a unified country.
The overture is unlikely to attract sup
port among nationalist authorities who
have called on Peking to renounce com
munism as a condition for reunification.

Kissinger to head panel
Washington — Henry Kissinger will be
named by President Reagan to head the
administration's new blue-ribbon, bipar
tisan commission that will study a wide
range of economic and military options
tor the United States in Central America,
administration officials said Sunday
night.
Kissinger met with high administration
officials at the White House late last
week. A formal proposal recommending
his appointment was drawn up by Na
tional Security Adviser William Clark on
Saturday and approved by the president
over the weekend, administration
sources said.
Kissinger, former secretary of state and
national security adviser to presidents
Nixon and Ford, has been used by the
Reagan administration as an unofficial
adviser on several occasions. But his ap
pointment to head the Central America
commission would be his first formal ap
pointment from Reagan.
During the 1976 Republican presiden
tial primary, Reagan was a bitter critic of
Kissinger, whom he accused of master
minding the "giveaway" of the Panama
Canal. Some conservative Reagan sup
porters still view Kissinger with marked
distrust.
However, Kissinger increasingly has
gained stature among administration
foreign policy advisers, including Clark
and Secretary of State George Shultz. Kis
singer has been consulted on issues such
as the Middle East and the MX missile
deployment.
Carter speaks on papers
Tokyo — Former President Carter said
yesterday that he did not believe that the
theft of his briefing papers for a 1980 tele
vision debate with President Reagan
"would be the kind of issue that will pre
vent his (Reagan's) running for re
election, nor should it be."
However, Carter, who arrived in Tokyo
to seek lapanese funds for a Carter library
at Emory University in Atlanta, called the
theft of his papers "a very serious mat
ter."
Carter was asked in a television inter
view if he thought that Reagan should
assume "ethical responsibility" for the
theft and therefore not seek re-election.
"I don't think this would be the kind of
issue that will prevent his running for re
election, nor should it be," the former
president said. "The American people, I
think, are interested in knowing to what
degree they were misled by the debate.
Was it fair? Was itan honest debate?. .

"I think that President Reagan has now,
with the focus of attention on it, directed
his people to carry out that investigation
adequately. At first, he said it was of no
consequence but I think that now he sees
it's a very serious matter."
Police hold terrorist suspects
Paris — French police detained 51 sus
pected Armenian activists yesterday and
confiscated weapons and explosives fol
lowing Friday's terrorist bombing at Orly
Airport that killed six people, including
one American, and injured 55.
An Interior Ministry spokesman said
the Armenians were detained because
they could have information about the
Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation
of Armenia, which has claimed responsi
bility for Friday's blast and a string of
other terrorist acts in Europe and North
America. .
The Orly Airport bombing has focused
attention here on one of the most intract
able of Middle East problems. The Secret
Army was founded in 1975 to avenge what
it describes as the massacre of about 1.5
million Armenians in Turkey during
World War I, an event TurkisFi officials
describe as an invention of Armenian
propagandists.
The Orly Airport bombing was
promptly condemned by leading Arme
nian emigre organizations. A spokesman
for the right-wing Tashnak Party de
scribed the bombing as an "act of blind
terrorism" and charged that the Secret
Army had become "an instrument of the
Soviet Union" from its base in Syria.
The Tashnak spokesman said that the
use of France as a site for terrorist attacks
could either mean that negotiations for
an accomodation between the French
government and the Secret Army had
failed or that the terrorists were being
used by "other governments" to de
stabilize France.
Psychic may have sex tapes
Los Angeles — A man who says he's a
psychic claimed yesterday that model
Vicki Morgan gave him a videotape of
politicians at a sex party, and said the
politicians conspired to "have her si
lenced."
Ernesto Montgomery failed to produce
the tape, however, saying he had mailed
it to Clifford Linedecker, a reporter for
the National Examiner tabloid in Florida.
Linedecker said yesterday from West
Palm Beach, Fla., that he had not received
the purported tape.

Montgomery said at a news conference
he had been advising Morgan, who was
considering dropping her attempts at a
modeling or acting career.
"Based on what my client (Morgan)
said, and my dreams ... I am of the opin
ion there are more copies of the tape/'
said Montgomery, 56, who leads the Uni
versal Metaphysical Church.
Montgomery said Morgan's statements
and his "God-given insight" convinced
him the tape could touch off a scandal.
