### TIM GRIEVE 
Stanford Against Conscrip
tion (SAC) will announce this
morning that it opposes the
University's mailing of finan
cial aid packages and registra
tion compliance forms with
out accompanying informa
tion on the University's deci
sion to offer private aid to
non-registrants.
The Solomom Amendment
prevents non-registrants
from receiving any federal fi
nancial aid. But, in a state
ment earlier this year, Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy said that Stanford
will use its own resources to
make up for the federal funds
that non-registrants will not
receive.
However, Director of Fi
nancial Aids Robert Huff said
he believes students are
aware of Stanford's policy
and will contact his office in
dividually if they have any
questions.
However, in keeping with
the amendment, the Univer
sity is mailing this week,
along with financial aid of
fers, a form which requires
students to reveal whether or
not they have registered.
By not including the infor
mation that the University
will make up for any lost aid,
members of SAC believe that
students will either feel
forced to register or not at
tend Stanford.
