## Fighting viewed as Lebanese challenge 
### 
Beirut, Lebanon — The
stepped-up fighting among fac
tions around Beirut may be a de
liberate test of the Lebanese ar
my's ability to assert control
once Israel's troops leave the
area, Israeli officials say.
The latest clashes came Sun
day, when Christian and Druse
militiamen battled fiercely in the
central mountains and poured
artillery fire on crowded
beaches north of Beirut that sent
bathers running for safety.
Beirut radio stations said the
fighting tapered off at night after
more than five hours of artillery
duels in the Israeli-occupied
Chouf and Aley mountains east
and southeast of Beirut.
There was no immediate re
port of casualties Sunday, al
though battles between Christ
ians and Druse have claimed
several hundred lives since
November.
Israel has considered with
drawing from the mountains and
regrouping behind more defen
sible lines in south Lebanon to
reduce casualties.
In Jerusalem, Israeli officials
said Sunday that Prime Minister
Menachem Begin may summon
his top advisers to set the
| pullback in motion.
The officials, who spoke on
condition they not be identified,
said the decision on the rede
. ployment may be made before
I Begin leaves for a luly 27 meet
ing with President Reagan in
I Washington.
I The officials said they believe
1 the renewed fighting among the
I Lebanese factions in and near
| Beirut was a test to see whether
| Lebanon's army can take control

once the Israelis leave.
Israel has been consulting
with the Lebanese and U.S. gov
ernments to ensure that the void
left by its troops is not filled by
hostile Syrian or Palestinian
forces, the officials said. But one
official said the decision to re
deploy "is independent of who
will fill the gap."
Israeli Chief of Staff Lt. Gen.
Moshe Levy has said the most
likelv redeployment line would
be the Awali River, about 20
miles south of the current line in
Beirut's southern outskirts.
Israeli troops have been in
Lebanon since invading last
summer to drive the Palestine
Liberation Organization out of
Beirut. A Lebanese-Israeli ag
reement for withdrawal of all
foreign troops is contingent
upon Syria's signature, but
Syria—whose troops have been
in Lebanon since they were sent
in to monitor the civil war
cease-fire in 1976—has rejected
the agreement.
Although the Lebanese gov
ernment plans to move its army
into areas vacated by the Israelis,
Druse leaders have warned
against deploying the army at
their strongholds before a truce
is reached with the Christians.
The Druse sect is an offshoot
of Islam and its followers consti
tute 10 percent of Lebanon's
population of 4 million.
The deterioration of the sec
urity situation around Beirut
came as President Amin
Gemayel prepared for a trip to
Washington this week to discuss
the withdrawal of foreign forces
from Lebanon.
