# Encouraging signs in U.S.-Soviet diplomatic relations
## 
### 
Washington—After 2!6 years of virtually
non-stop mutual hositility between the
Reagan administration and rulers of the
Soviet Union, a series of small but "mildly
encouraging" developments, as one
senior U.S. official put it, have' rather
suddenly sprouted in the relationship be
tween the nuclear giants.
Specialists throughout the administra
tion stress that these developments are
on the fringe of that relationship and that
central hostilities and differences remain.
But there is a feeling that the new de
velopments may amount to at least " a
clearing away of the underbrush" from a
road that could lead to better relations.
"I don't want to make too big a thing
out of it," one high-ranking and normally
hard-line official said of arms-control de
velopments. "But both sides have lifted
their skirts a little and are showing more
ankle. What we don't know on the Rus
sian side (is) if it is really a signal that they
want to talk, if it's a tit-for-tat response to
our efforts or if it is something they would
have done anyway."
In the past month or so, here is what
happened.

—In Washington June 8, President
Reagan announced slight changes in the
U.S. position at the Strategic Arms Reduc
tion Talks (START) in Geneva that would
in effect move the U.S. stand closer to the
Soviet one at least on the number of
long-range missiles allowed each side.
Many officials also suggest that other
areas of flexibility in the U.S. proposal
have not been made public.
— In Geneva three weeks ago, the
Soviets dropped some of their more ex
treme START demands, which they knew
to be totally unacceptable to this country.
Two weeks ago, the Soviets made a
more serious proposal, which leaves in
tact their biggest missiles that most con
cern the United States but which
nevertheless indicates that Moscow is
willing to move to lower overall
multiple-warhead missile levels than it
was in earlier arms agreements.
—In Vienna late last month, the War
saw Pact put forward a new proposal at
the long-stalled East-West talks on troop
cuts in Europe.
As in the START negotiations, the
Soviet move did not deal with the central

issue threatening the West—the Western
contention that there are far more
Soviet-bloc troops in Eastern Europe than
Moscow admits. But the new proposal at
least had "some positive elements," the
White House said, in appearing to allow
greater on-site inspection rights.
—In Warsaw, Polish authorities have
absorbed last month's visit of Pope John
Paul II and appear to be preparing to lift at
least some of the remaining martial-law
restrictions this month.
Administration officials believe that the
papal visit went extrememly well, and
Reagan has stated publicly that if Polish
authorities take actual rather than cosme
tic reforms, the United States and its allies
will consider lifting some or all of the
economic sanctions imposed late in 1981.
Undersecretary of State Lawrence Eag
leburger conveyed this message person
ally to a senior Polish diplomat here re
cently in a private meetingthat was repor
tedly the most substantive held with
Polish authorities in a long time.
—In Madrid, both countries have just
signed a compromise agreement that
ends nearly three years of talks at the

35-nation conference to review progress
on the 1975 Helsinki accords on security
and human rights in Europe.
The compromise is also expected to
commit the Soviets to a follow-up confer
ence on human rights and a new confer
ence on disarmament in Europe meant to
restrict the kind the military activities that
make opposing blocs worry about sur
prise attacks. It also will lead to a meeting
this fall between Secretary of State
George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minis
ter Andrei Gromyko.
—In Moscow |une 26, the Soviets al
lowed 15 members of a Pentecostal family
that had taken regufe in the U.S. Embassy
for almost five years to emigrate to Israel.
Another Pentecostal family that took re
fuge in the embassy has been told it will
be able to leave the Soviet Union, the
State Department said.
More recently, there have been reports
that other dissidents will be allowed to
emigrate this year. Whether this is part of
a secret deal with the United States can
not be ascertained, although some U.S.
analysts believe it is.

tion Talks (START) in Geneva that would
in effect move the U.S. stand closer to the
Soviet one at least on the number of
long-range missiles allowed each side.
Many officials also suggest that other
areas of flexibility in the U.S. proposal
have not been made public.
— In Geneva three weeks ago, the
Soviets dropped some of their more ex
treme START demands, which they knew
to be totally unacceptable to this country.
Two weeks ago, the Soviets made a
more serious proposal, which leaves in
tact their biggest missiles that most con
cern the United States but which
nevertheless indicates that Moscow is
willing to move to lower overall
multiple-warhead missile levels than it
was in earlier arms agreements.
—In Vienna late last month, the War
saw Pact put forward a new proposal at
the long-stalled East-West talks on troop
cuts in Europe.
As in the START negotiations, the
Soviet move did not deal with the central

issue threatening the West—the Western
contention that there are far more
Soviet-bloc troops in Eastern Europe than
Moscow admits. But the new proposal at
least had "some positive elements," the
White House said, in appearing to allow
greater on-site inspection rights.
—In Warsaw, Polish authorities have
absorbed last month's visit of Pope John
Paul II and appear to be preparing to lift at
least some of the remaining martial-law
restrictions this month.
Administration officials believe that the
papal visit went extrememly well, and
Reagan has stated publicly that if Polish
authorities take actual rather than cosme
tic reforms, the United States and its allies
will consider lifting some or all of the
economic sanctions imposed late in 1981.
Undersecretary of State Lawrence Eag
leburger conveyed this message person
ally to a senior Polish diplomat here re
cently in a private meetingthat was repor
tedly the most substantive held with
Polish authorities in a long time.
—In Madrid, both countries have just
signed a compromise agreement that
ends nearly three years of talks at the

35-nation conference to review progress
on the 1975 Helsinki accords on security
and human rights in Europe.
The compromise is also expected to
commit the Soviets to a follow-up confer
ence on human rights and a new confer
ence on disarmament in Europe meant to
restrict the kind the military activities that
make opposing blocs worry about sur
prise attacks. It also will lead to a meeting
this fall between Secretary of State
George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minis
ter Andrei Gromyko.
—In Moscow |une 26, the Soviets al
lowed 15 members of a Pentecostal family
that had taken regufe in the U.S. Embassy
for almost five years to emigrate to Israel.
Another Pentecostal family that took re
fuge in the embassy has been told it will
be able to leave the Soviet Union, the
State Department said.
More recently, there have been reports
that other dissidents will be allowed to
emigrate this year. Whether this is part of
a secret deal with the United States can
not be ascertained, although some U.S.
analysts believe it is.
