# Latin Americans appeal for assistance to prevent war
## 
### 
Cancun, Mexico—Latin American presidents have
issued an urgent appeal to Ronald Reagan and Cuban
President Fidel Castro to help avert war in Central
America.
In a communique issued Sunday after a weekend
summit meeting, the president of the so-called Con
tadora countries proposed the immediate demilitari
zation of Central America, an end to arms smuggling
and foreign intervention, and a ban on the establish
ment of foreign bases.
The focus of their concern was the growing conflict
between Nicaragua and Honduras, in which both
Cuba and the United States are involved.
"This very day we the presidents of the Contadora
Group will direct ourselves to the presidents of the
Central American governments—involved directly in
the problem—but also to President Reagan. . .and to
Commander Fidel Castro, inviting them to join in this
effort with good faith and decision," the com
munique said.

The communique was signed by president Miguel
de la Madrid of Mexico, Belisario Betancur of Colom
bia, Luis Herrera Campins of Venezuela and Ricardo
de la Espriella of Panama. Those four countries have
been trying to defuse the violence in Central America
since jan. 5, when their representatives first met on
the Panamanian resort island of Contadora.
"The conflicts in Central America confront the in
ternational community with a choice of supporting
and strengthening the path to political understand
ing. . .or passively accepting factors that could lead
to armed confrontations of greater danger," the
statement said.
The Contadora presidents indirectly blamed the
United States and Cuba for the tense situation that
has developed in the region.
The communique also proposed demilitarized
zones along Nicaragua's borders with Honduras and
Costa Rica. Attacks by Nicaraguan rebels based in
those two neighboring nations have intensified in an
effort to overthrow the Nicaraguan leftist junta.

Honduras and Nicaragua have been massing
troops along their common border, where the
Nicaraguan exiles are based. Other exiles, mostly
disenchanted Sandinistas, are based in Costa Rica
and have been mounting attacks against the Nicara
guan government from the south.
The Contadora communique proposed a ban on
the use by one nation "of the territory of another to
mount acts of aggression against a third state."
This seemed to refer to the help the Central Intelli
gence Agency has been providing the Honduras
based rebels and to the establishment of a U.S. Army
base in Honduras to train 2400 Salvadoran soldiers in
counterinsurgency tactics over the next six months.
The communique's condemnation of arms smuggl
ing apparently referred to accusations that the San
dinistas have been secretly supplying weapons to
leftist rebels fighting for power in El Salvador.
The communique proposed the withdrawal of all
foreign military advisers from the region.
