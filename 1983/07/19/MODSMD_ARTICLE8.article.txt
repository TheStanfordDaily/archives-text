## Increased citizen awareness needed in arms debate 
### 
In the last article I wrote
{Daily, ]uly 6) I recommended
that everyone read Elizabeth
Drew's latest article in New
Yorker magazine. Now I'd like to
suggest another piece of re
commended reading for those
concerned with our nation's
strategic defense policies. The
Report of the President's Com
mission on Strategic Forces
(commonly referred to as the
Scowcroft commission report)
was released in April 1983 and is
available free of charge from the
Government Printing Office in
Washington, D.C.
This document, morethanany
other publication or decision, is
this administration's most sig
nificant contribution to, and
rationale for, our nation's
strategic defense policy. I re
commend reading this report
not because of its questionable
defense-related content—it
suggests placing 100 MX missiles
in vulnerable Minuteman silos;
it argues against heavily MIRVed
missiles like the MX; it suggests
that first-strike capable missiles
like MX are required to deter a
conventional attack on
Europe—but because of the
statements it makes about the
conduct of the defense debate
in this country.
On page 2 of the report, the
commission suggests, "What we
have most to fear is that confu
sion and internal divisions—
sometimes by-products of the
vigorous play of our free

politics—will lead us to lose
purpose, hope, and resolve."
This explicit premium placed
upon thevalueof consensus was
implicit in the deliberately bi
partisan composition of the
Scowcroft commission; a bit of
political manipulation to win
support for the MX from Repub
licans and Democrats alike.
While such chicanery certainly
deserves criticism, much more
dangerous and repugnant is the
notion that our nation as a
whole, the "common citizens"
like you and me, must not allow
ourselves to be confused and di
vided in our concern about the

arms race and nuclear war.
In other words, we should not
question the commission's find
ings. Afterall, the only way not to
be confused and divided by the
report's internal contradictions
is to accept it blindly, without
questioning. While blind obedi
ence to authority and placing
trust in "experts" may be the
way to get the MX missile de
ployed, it is not the way to make
rational defense policy, and it is
certainly no way to run a demo
cracy.
There is a certain danger in

free and open discussion of de
fense strategy, or of any other
policy issue. I was disturbed to
see SALT II withdrawn from Se
nate consideration by President
Carter (using Afghanistan as an
excuse) because he knew the
treaty would not have passed if
brought to a vote. What
bothered me was not that SALT II
would have been rejected', but
that it's opponents were attack
ing the SALT process overall,
and not judging the treaty on its
own merits. So there is a danger
that defense policy may fall prey
to other political agendas in the
course of a free and open debate

However, the public can and
must play a major role in deter
mining the types of goals which
should be pursued in negotia
tions and in evaluating the
negotiated agreements in terms
of these goals. It is actually pat
riotic, in a land which professes
itself to be a democracy, for a
citizen to question his leader's
policies, be they in regard to tax
ation, foreign policy, or na
tional security.
President Reagan has more
than once insinuated that the
nuclear Freeze movement is
being manipulated, if not or
chestrated, by Soviet agents. He

I believe what we have most to fear is the type of mentality which
says that national unity, obedience to authority, and trusting the
experts is required for national security.

(as is now the case with the MX).
Nevertheless, I would prefer to
see a discussion and debate re
sult in a decision contrary to my
own wishes than I would a deci
sion that was "left to the ex
perts" to decide.
History shows that the most
productive and successful
negotiations with the Soviets are
those conducted in private, out
of the headlines of international
political rivalry. The public can
not, and should not, have an ac
tive role in the negotiation of
complex, detailed agreements.

has argued that the Freeze
movement itself, and not the
Freeze initiative it advocates, is a
threat to our national security.
The administration has further
argued that we are at a disadvan
tage in negotiating with the
Soviets because their leaders are
not responsible to a divided
public opinion. The Scowcroft
repor.t warns that our internal
divisions are what we have most
to fear. I disagree.
I believe what we have most to
fear is the type of mentality

which says that national unity,
obedience to authority, and
trusting the experts is required
for national security. While it
may be ludicrous and dangerous
to mimic Soviet weapons de
ployments as we do, it is far
more dangerous to mimic their
political system as well, in the
hope of wringing bargains at the
negotiating table. If we sacrifice
the right and duty of our citizens
to question their leaders'
policies, we will have nothing
left worth defending.
Democracy places upon us a
responsibility which Soviet citi
zens are not fortunate enough to
share: a responsibility to keep
informed of our leaders'
policies, their goals, and the
means they use to pursue these
goals. Our nation's strength lies
not in the number of weapons or
cars we produce, but in the
number and quality of informed,
articulate citizens shaping our
domestic and foreign policies.
Don't abuse your right and re
sponsibility to keep informed
and to question your leaders;
read the Scowcroft report and
find out what the "experts" and
our president feel is vital to our
national security. You may agree
or disagree. Either way, your
right to know and to question is
more than just a privilege to be
taken lightly; it is your duty as a
citizen.
