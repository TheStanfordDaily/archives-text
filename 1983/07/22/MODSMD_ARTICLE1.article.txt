# Provost approves tenure for Freedman
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
After a year-long tenure battle
charged with allegations of sex
discrimination, Asst. History
Prof. Estelle Freedman has been
recommended for tenure by
Provost Albert Hastorf.
"I'm very relieved that the
waiting is over," Freedman, a

pioneer in the Feminist Studies
Program here, said yesterday.
"I'm very grateful for the sup
port I've received."
The dean and associate deans
of the School of Humanities and
Sciences had recommended
against Freedman's tenure in
March of 1982, following a
unanimous recommendation of
the school's appointments ana
promotions committee.
But the case attracted nation
wide press coverage when
Freedman supporters claimed
that she had been denied tenure
by male faculty members be
cause they did not recognize
feminist studies as a serious
academic discipline.
Hastorf stressed in his an
nouncement of the decision yes
terday that he had found no evi
dence of sex-based discrimina
tion. But he said that he had
given recognition, where ap
propriate, to programs such as
the Center for Research on
Women and the Feminist
Studies Program.

Protests by students and fa
culty following the initial re
commendation against Freed
man's tenure led to a second
hearing and yet a second denial
by the Committee on Appoint
ments and Promotions and the
deans of Humanities and Sci
ences last December.
Freedman initially filed a grie
vance with Wessells in March.
After it was denied, the grie
vance was forwarded to the pro
vost. The upholding of such
grievances by the provost is rare.
Hastorf acted on the recom
mendation of Vice Provost Herant
Katchadourian, the appeal officer
in Freedman's grievance.
Freedman supporters were
ecstatic over the news yester
day.
Law Prof. Barbara Babcock,
who coordinated Freedman's
support, said she had always
been optimistic that when
"someone took a close look at it,
they'd realize there was a mis
take and they'd do the right
thing."
Babcock said Hastorf had up

held the grievance not because
of the publicity surrounding the
case but because of the "tre
mendous and unprecedented
support that came from within
the University."
The people who recom
mended against Freedman's te
nure did not act in "bad faith,"
Babcock said, but merely "mis
evaluated" her academic con
tributions.
But Babcock did say that the
original committee may have
"discounted the importance of
the field" of feminist studies,
though "not necessarily con
sciously."
By upholding Freedman's
grievance and forwarding her
promotion papers, Hastorf has
returned Freedman's case to
regular status. Her case will now
be considered by the Advisory
Board of the Academic Council
this tall. The board, composed
of seven faculty members, must
recommend all faculty appoint
ments to the president.

Freedman graduated from
Barnard College in 1%9 and re
ceived her Ph.D. from Columbia
in 1976. She received a dean's
award for distinguished teach
ing in 1978 and the Dinkelspiel
Award — the highest honor tor
contributions to undergraduate
education — in 1981.
