## Academic freedom of inquiry is at stake with SSRL 
### 
An open letter to Loren Rusk,
Department of English.
Your letter to me of )une 8,
published in Campus Report,
urges me to prevent the possibil
ity of "weapons research" at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radia
tion Laboratory (SSRL), and asks
me in conclusion to "re-examine
your conscience and truly repre
sent the community that you
head."
First, I want to dispel some
confusion about my job. It is not
to "represent the community."
The University is a complex en
tity. On some matters —for
example, the stewardship of the
University's assets and
property—l have a good deal of
authority. I do not, and should
not, exercise it in a representa
tional fashion. We are a public
trust, and I am therefore ac
countable to trustees—who
don't believe, for example, that
real estate transactions should
be evaluated by campus re
ferendum. On other matters,
particular constituencies of the
University hold the authority.
For example, by powerful and
longstanding academic tradi
tion, the faculty is responsible
for university policies relating to
academic inquiry.
This principle exists for the
best of reasons. Academic free
dom really means freedom of in
quiry. To be able to probe ac
cording to one's own interest,
knowledge, and conscience is

the most important freedom the
scholar has, and an undissoci
abie part of that process is to
state its results openly. The rules
of universities are carefully
structured to protect freedom of
inquiry, and accordingly they
have always turned aside from
regulating faculty inquiry, even
when strong political forces
were in favor of it. It is these very
same rules that insist, as a com
plementary defense of freedom
of inquiry, that the work be done
and published openly.
Thus the academic commun
ity has surrounded research with
the same kinds of protections
that a democratic society has
more generally given to speech.
That is because the two are really
very much alike. When the
theoretical social scientist,
working alone and without be
nefit of any equipment beyond a
library, generates a radical idea
we seldom argue about the need
to accord every protection to the
author's right to produce and to
publish that idea. That is be
cause in such cases the identity
between research and speech is
so obvious.
It might be argued that re
search in the physical sciences is
different because it depends
upon complex hardware, in
volves the development of
"technologies" and not just
ideas, and frequently is sup
ported by outside entities. All

that is true; yet I do not believe
that the size of a project, the
specificity of the products, or
the source of the funding pro
vides a valid basis for casting
aside the principle that faculty
members should be free to in
quire according to the dictates
of their own professional in
terests and conscience. What
possible principle could be used
to differentiate some forms of
"hard science" from the rest of
scholarly work, for the purpose
of regulating it differently?
At Stanford, the Committee
on Research, the faculty's agent
for establishing and monitoring
research policies, has frequently
been called upon to make re
strictions on research that are
based on prospective end-use or
on the source of funding. The
Committee has consistently
reaffirmed its belief, most re
cently in the case of the SSRL
project, that such restriction
should not be made. Although I
have stated my own personal ag
reement with that view, I have
tried to remind everyone—and I
do so again now—that this is
clearly an area in which the fa
culty has the responsibility.
Were the President of the Uni
versity able to set aside that pol
icy so as to prevent a faculty
member from doing a particular
piece of research—with or with
out the claim to "represent"
some community or other—we

would have sacrificed a central
eiement in our tradition of
academic freedom. But let me
comment, for myself, on the ar
guments you and others have
raised.
Some have contended that the
SSRL project is different because
it involves outside institutions
and a large capital investment.
As a matter of fact, the proposed
capital investment will make
possible a variety of different
kinds of work, most of them hav
ing nothing whatever to do with
nuclear weapons or testing.
However, as Stanford's rules re
quire, a Stanford faculty
member (one who, by the way,
deserves respect for his consci
ence as well as for his scientific
distinction) will be the principal
investigator on the project, and
will be responsible for it. It is
thus clearly in the same category
as other investigator-initiated
research projects.
Others, like yourself, believe
that his case is different for
another reason. Because, it is
argued, the research is related to
nuclear weapons, and because
nuclear weapons have the po
tential for great human destruc
tion, the entire matter passes to
a different ethical zone. That
kind of argument is regularly ad
vanced whenever a good set of
principles produces a result with
which many disagree, or which
seems threatening. It is fre

quently used, for example, in
favor of martial law in times of
civil unrest. It is a tempting ar
gument, but it is one we should
resist.
Your letter ends with a chal
lenge very familiar to those of us
who agonized our way through
the late 19605: "No neutral move
is available to you. . .you can
either add to the danger of an
nihilation, or you can join those
of us who believe that the least
we must do is not allow it to
begin in our own backyard." I
find that a disappointingly famil
iar specimen of rhetorical right
eousness, but at least the first
part of it is correct: I can indeed
make no "neutral move." That
neither surprises me nor leaves
me particularly uncomfortable,
because I've learned that the
more difficult decisions I make
nearly all have to do with colli
sions between competing val
ues, each of which has great
merit. In the present case, I can
not begin to predict whether or
how much this research (or any
of a number of other kinds of
rr search) will add to the danger
of annihilation; but the nuclear
imperative you offer does not
persuade me that we should
suspend a central principle of
academic freedom because
there is some chance that it
might.

find that a disappointingly famil

nearly all have to do with colli

merit. In the present case, I can
not begin to predict whether or
how much this research (or any
of a number of other kinds of

suspend a central principle of
academic freedom because
there is some chance that it

An open letter to Loren Rusk,
Department of English.
Your letter to me of )une 8,
published in Campus Report,
urges me to prevent the possibil
ity of "weapons research" at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radia
tion Laboratory (SSRL), and asks
me in conclusion to "re-examine
your conscience and truly repre
sent the community that you
head."
First, I want to dispel some
confusion about my job. It is not
to "represent the community."
The University is a complex en
tity. On some matters —for
example, the stewardship of the
University's assets and
property—l have a good deal of
authority. I do not, and should
not, exercise it in a representa
tional fashion. We are a public
trust, and I am therefore ac
countable to trustees—who
don't believe, for example, that
real estate transactions should
be evaluated by campus re
ferendum. On other matters,
particular constituencies of the
University hold the authority.
For example, by powerful and
longstanding academic tradi
tion, the faculty is responsible
for university policies relating to
academic inquiry.
This principle exists for the
best of reasons. Academic free
dom really means freedom of in
quiry. To be able to probe ac
cording to one's own interest,
knowledge, and conscience is

the most important freedom the
scholar has, and an undissoci
abie part of that process is to
state its results openly. The rules
of universities are carefully
structured to protect freedom of
inquiry, and accordingly they
have always turned aside from
regulating faculty inquiry, even
when strong political forces
were in favor of it. It is these very
same rules that insist, as a com
plementary defense of freedom
of inquiry, that the work be done
and published openly.
Thus the academic commun
ity has surrounded research with
the same kinds of protections
that a democratic society has
more generally given to speech.
That is because the two are really
very much alike. When the
theoretical social scientist,
working alone and without be
nefit of any equipment beyond a
library, generates a radical idea
we seldom argue about the need
to accord every protection to the
author's right to produce and to
publish that idea. That is be
cause in such cases the identity
between research and speech is
so obvious.
It might be argued that re
search in the physical sciences is
different because it depends
upon complex hardware, in
volves the development of
"technologies" and not just
ideas, and frequently is sup
ported by outside entities. All

that is true; yet I do not believe
that the size of a project, the
specificity of the products, or
the source of the funding pro
vides a valid basis for casting
aside the principle that faculty
members should be free to in
quire according to the dictates
of their own professional in
terests and conscience. What
possible principle could be used
to differentiate some forms of
"hard science" from the rest of
scholarly work, for the purpose
of regulating it differently?
At Stanford, the Committee
on Research, the faculty's agent
for establishing and monitoring
research policies, has frequently
been called upon to make re
strictions on research that are
based on prospective end-use or
on the source of funding. The
Committee has consistently
reaffirmed its belief, most re
cently in the case of the SSRL
project, that such restriction
should not be made. Although I
have stated my own personal ag
reement with that view, I have
tried to remind everyone—and I
do so again now—that this is
clearly an area in which the fa
culty has the responsibility.
Were the President of the Uni
versity able to set aside that pol
icy so as to prevent a faculty
member from doing a particular
piece of research—with or with
out the claim to "represent"
some community or other—we

would have sacrificed a central
eiement in our tradition of
academic freedom. But let me
comment, for myself, on the ar
guments you and others have
raised.
Some have contended that the
SSRL project is different because
it involves outside institutions
and a large capital investment.
As a matter of fact, the proposed
capital investment will make
possible a variety of different
kinds of work, most of them hav
ing nothing whatever to do with
nuclear weapons or testing.
However, as Stanford's rules re
quire, a Stanford faculty
member (one who, by the way,
deserves respect for his consci
ence as well as for his scientific
distinction) will be the principal
investigator on the project, and
will be responsible for it. It is
thus clearly in the same category
as other investigator-initiated
research projects.
Others, like yourself, believe
that his case is different for
another reason. Because, it is
argued, the research is related to
nuclear weapons, and because
nuclear weapons have the po
tential for great human destruc
tion, the entire matter passes to
a different ethical zone. That
kind of argument is regularly ad
vanced whenever a good set of
principles produces a result with
which many disagree, or which
seems threatening. It is fre

quently used, for example, in
favor of martial law in times of
civil unrest. It is a tempting ar
gument, but it is one we should
resist.
Your letter ends with a chal
lenge very familiar to those of us
who agonized our way through
the late 19605: "No neutral move
is available to you. . .you can
either add to the danger of an
nihilation, or you can join those
of us who believe that the least
we must do is not allow it to
begin in our own backyard." I
find that a disappointingly famil
iar specimen of rhetorical right
eousness, but at least the first
