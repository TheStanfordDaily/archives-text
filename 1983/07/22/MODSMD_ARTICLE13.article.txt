## George gets MacArthur prize 
### TIM GRIEVE 
Stanford Political Science
Prof. Alexander George has
been named one of the 14

Mac Arthur Prize fellows, an
honor that will give him $295,200
over the next five years with which
to do whatever he pleases.
But George and his wife Julie
won't be buying a new car or a
summer home in Florida with
the money.
"We're thrifty people, my wife
and I, and we have a long-range
perspective on matters,"
George said. "We don't have
any flighty ideas about how to
spend it. It's something one has
to think about very carefully."
The 63-year-old professor said
he will use the money to help his
wife continue their collaborative
research on former President
Woodrow Wilson, work that
made the pair's 1956 publication
on the former President what
George calls a "first rate, classic
study of the role of personality in
politics."
George's wife will continue to
work on a project with Assoc.
Surgery Prof. Michael Marmor
investigating the relationship
between Wilson's health and
political actions.
George will continue to mix

his own research on U.S.-Soviet
relations with teaching this fall,
teaching a seminar on manag
ing American-Soviet relations
and working with Political Sci
ence Prof. John Lewis at the
Center for International Security
and Arms Control.
The John D. and Catherine T.
Mac Arthur Foundation of
Chicago announced the award
Wednesday.
Although George is no
stranger to academic awards—
he won the 1975 Bancroft prize
for his book on Deterrence in
Foreign Policy —he said the
Mac Arthur prize is "stunning."
"My head is still full of bub
bles and it's not from cham
pagne, either," he said. "It just
makes you feel, I don't know,
one just has to get used to it."
George said that it is "hard to
say why they picked me over
many others, both here at Stan
ford and elsewhere. The ele
ment of luck is very important.
There are many people who are
more deserving and I hope
others can experience this kind
of thing."
