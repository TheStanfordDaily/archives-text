# The 						Bridge: a caring voice a phone call away
## 
### KRISHNA WEST 
The Bridge is Stanford's only
community center for peer
counseling services. Staffed by
student volunteers who have
completed intensive training
procedures and evaluations in
peer counseling, they are there
to "listen, to explore feelings, or
to discuss problems and frustra
tions concerning school, sex,
drugs, relationships and life."
Co-founded by Assoc.
Psychiatry Prof. Vincent
D'Andrea and a group of stu
dents in 1970, The Bridge be
came a functional alternative to
Cowell Student Health Center's
services in 1972, helping people
find solutions to their own prob
lems.
According to the manual
which the program uses as its
guide, peer counselors "don't
tell people what they 'should'
do. We don't give advice. . . We
are not professionals and we do
not assume that we can know
what a person is thinking or feel
ing better than that person
him/herself."
The types of problems people
need help with, according to
The Bridge's records, range
from requests for legal assis
tance and gay housing informa
tion to coping with paranoid de
lusions and attempts at suicide.
Others include depression, eat
ing disorders, job-related con
flicts, anger, frustration, di
vorce, incest and academic
troubles.
"Problems with relationships
are the most common ones I've
come across," Amy Mar, a live-in
counselor, said.
Allaire Patterson, a psychol
ogy major who has been a live-in
counselor since last spring, said
thatthe most common problems
encountered are "relationship
break-ups and academic
woes—increased calls during fi
nals week."
Calls about possible suicide
are not frequent, but "the words
may stumble out while the dis
turbed person is talking about
their problem. They may con
template it, but they don't in
tend to follow through."
According to Stanford Police
Captain Raoul Niemeyer, last
year there was one suicide and
two "bona fide" attempts on
campus, but none of either so
far this year.
The Bridge offers gay peer
couseling under a related but
separate arrangement, through
counselors who have received

special orientation to this area,
and may themselves be
homosexual. Mar said that this
form of counseling is "slightly
different from general peer
counseling because the coun
selors are more sharing of their
experiences and information, if
necessary."
The Bridge also refers callers
to professionals or other hot
lines, she said, especially in the
case of people with chronic
problems, "depending on how
comfortable our counselors feel
with the talker."
The Bay Area has "a great net
work of hotlines (for particular
problems) and referral is done
frequently," Patterson explains.
"We don't pretend to be profes
sionals. . . The objective of The
Bridge is to be there and be ob
jective in helping our peers
solve their own problems." Stu
dent peer counseling groups are
rare nationwide, she added.
People who seek help from
the program are welcome either
to visit the center or to phone.
For winter quarter of this year,
The Bridge received 359 phone
calls (152 more than the fall quar
ter) and 53 drop-ins (29 more
than in the fall quarter.) Of
these, 166 calls were for counsel

ing (59 more than the previous
quarter).
Patterson said a lot of people
may not visit The Bridge because
of the stigma attached to the
idea of seeking help.
Mar said the duration of the
phone calls could be anywhere
between a half hour to two
hours. Counselors do experi
ence some stress, she said, "but
you're helping somebody. The
bad effects are getting involved
in other people's problems and
internalizing them."
A counseling class offered by
the Learning Assistance Center,
Peer Counseling: Bridge (LAC
172), is a mandatory prerequisite
for all peer counselors at The
Bridge.
The other seven LAC counsel
ing courses are offshoots of the
original Bridge concept, con
centrating on basic attending
skills and counseling for
Chicanos, Asian Americans,
career development and con
traception. Students passing
from the latter courses may train
in real-life situations, but only
under the supervision of instruc
tors.
Although not all students who
take LAC 172 actually end up
working at The Bridge they do

have the option of doing so im
mediately after earning their two
units. The Bridge staff, number
ing 24 during the regular school
year and about half that during
the summer quarter, is com
prised of a cross-section of un
dergraduate students majoring
in a variety of fields.
Mar, an electrical engineering
major, has been at The Bridge
for four years and has taught the
workshop section of LAC 172 for
the past year. She is now one of
the four live-in counselors who
are provided with free rent in
exchange for time they devote to
the program. The four man the
phones during the graveyard
shift (10 p.m. to 8 a.m.) and par
ticipate in several Bridge ac
tivities, such as weekly live-in
dinners and community meet
ings.
In his winter 1981 report to
The Bridge Advisory Board meet
ing, Craig Goldman, then
operations coordinator, called
the live-in counselors the "nuc
leus of the day-to-day function
ing of The Bridge. They provide
staffer support, perform ad
ministrative tasks, work with
coordintaors, answer phones.
The job will take as much time as
the live-in is willing to give and

there will still be more to do."
"Anybody can learn peer
counseling skills, and the idea is
to help people in need with
these skills," Mar said. "Peer
counseling is non-judgmental,
and people do need help some
times."
Patterson agreed that the
work is "rewarding and tiring.
The real concern is a kind of
frustration. A lot of people's
problems are not easily solved,
and sometimes you have to
realize the solution must come
from within; you have to say to
the caller, 'it's all up to you
now.' "
"Time-orientation transfer,"
Patterson said, "is another prob
lem. You have to become more
of a flexible person, bridging
Stanford's world of academia
with the real world. And it's not
easy taking care of your own
problems as well as others'."
The Bridge is financially self
sufficient: it receives ap
proximately $10,000 in funding
from its annual arts and crafts
fair, and $1000 from the ASSU
Program Board. Mar said the
program usually breaks even. Its
major expenditures are publicity
costs and tele ph one service
charges.

rare nationwide, she added.
People who seek help from
the program are welcome either
to visit the center or to phone.
For winter quarter of this year,
The Bridge received 359 phone
calls (152 more than the fall quar
ter) and 53 drop-ins (29 more
than in the fall quarter.) Of
these, 166 calls were for counsel

ing (59 more than the previous
quarter).
Patterson said a lot of people
may not visit The Bridge because
of the stigma attached to the
idea of seeking help.
Mar said the duration of the
phone calls could be anywhere
between a half hour to two
hours. Counselors do experi
ence some stress, she said, "but
you're helping somebody. The
bad effects are getting involved
in other people's problems and
internalizing them."
A counseling class offered by
the Learning Assistance Center,
Peer Counseling: Bridge (LAC
172), is a mandatory prerequisite
for all peer counselors at The
Bridge.
The other seven LAC counsel
ing courses are offshoots of the
original Bridge concept, con
centrating on basic attending
skills and counseling for
Chicanos, Asian Americans,
career development and con
traception. Students passing
from the latter courses may train
in real-life situations, but only
under the supervision of instruc
tors.
Although not all students who
take LAC 172 actually end up
working at The Bridge they do

have the option of doing so im
mediately after earning their two
units. The Bridge staff, number
ing 24 during the regular school
year and about half that during
the summer quarter, is com
prised of a cross-section of un
dergraduate students majoring
in a variety of fields.
Mar, an electrical engineering
major, has been at The Bridge
for four years and has taught the
workshop section of LAC 172 for
the past year. She is now one of
the four live-in counselors who
are provided with free rent in
exchange for time they devote to
the program. The four man the
phones during the graveyard
shift (10 p.m. to 8 a.m.) and par
ticipate in several Bridge ac
tivities, such as weekly live-in
dinners and community meet
ings.
In his winter 1981 report to
The Bridge Advisory Board meet
ing, Craig Goldman, then
operations coordinator, called
the live-in counselors the "nuc
leus of the day-to-day function
ing of The Bridge. They provide
staffer support, perform ad
ministrative tasks, work with
coordintaors, answer phones.
The job will take as much time as
the live-in is willing to give and

there will still be more to do."
"Anybody can learn peer
counseling skills, and the idea is
to help people in need with
these skills," Mar said. "Peer
counseling is non-judgmental,
and people do need help some
times."
Patterson agreed that the
work is "rewarding and tiring.
The real concern is a kind of
frustration. A lot of people's
problems are not easily solved,
and sometimes you have to
realize the solution must come
from within; you have to say to
the caller, 'it's all up to you
now.' "
"Time-orientation transfer,"
Patterson said, "is another prob
lem. You have to become more
of a flexible person, bridging
Stanford's world of academia
with the real world. And it's not
easy taking care of your own
problems as well as others'."
The Bridge is financially self
sufficient: it receives ap
proximately $10,000 in funding
from its annual arts and crafts
fair, and $1000 from the ASSU
Program Board. Mar said the
program usually breaks even. Its
major expenditures are publicity
costs and tele ph one service
charges.

WAITING TO HELP: Live-in Bridge staffer Allaire Paterson pro
vides a warm voice at the other end of the telephone line when
people call in for information, advice or just conversation. The
The Bridge is Stanford's only
community center for peer
counseling services. Staffed by
student volunteers who have
completed intensive training
procedures and evaluations in
peer counseling, they are there
to "listen, to explore feelings, or
to discuss problems and frustra
tions concerning school, sex,
drugs, relationships and life."
Co-founded by Assoc.
Psychiatry Prof. Vincent
D'Andrea and a group of stu
dents in 1970, The Bridge be
came a functional alternative to
Cowell Student Health Center's
services in 1972, helping people
find solutions to their own prob
lems.
According to the manual
which the program uses as its
guide, peer counselors "don't
tell people what they 'should'
do. We don't give advice. . . We
are not professionals and we do
not assume that we can know
what a person is thinking or feel
ing better than that person
him/herself."
The types of problems people
need help with, according to
The Bridge's records, range
from requests for legal assis
tance and gay housing informa
tion to coping with paranoid de
lusions and attempts at suicide.
Others include depression, eat
ing disorders, job-related con
flicts, anger, frustration, di
vorce, incest and academic
troubles.
"Problems with relationships
are the most common ones I've
come across," Amy Mar, a live-in
counselor, said.
Allaire Patterson, a psychol
ogy major who has been a live-in
counselor since last spring, said
thatthe most common problems
encountered are "relationship
break-ups and academic
woes—increased calls during fi
nals week."
Calls about possible suicide
are not frequent, but "the words
may stumble out while the dis
turbed person is talking about
their problem. They may con
template it, but they don't in
tend to follow through."
According to Stanford Police
Captain Raoul Niemeyer, last
year there was one suicide and
two "bona fide" attempts on
campus, but none of either so
far this year.
The Bridge offers gay peer
couseling under a related but
separate arrangement, through
counselors who have received

special orientation to this area,
and may themselves be
homosexual. Mar said that this
form of counseling is "slightly
different from general peer
counseling because the coun
selors are more sharing of their
experiences and information, if
necessary."
The Bridge also refers callers
to professionals or other hot
lines, she said, especially in the
case of people with chronic
problems, "depending on how
comfortable our counselors feel
with the talker."
The Bay Area has "a great net
work of hotlines (for particular
problems) and referral is done
frequently," Patterson explains.
"We don't pretend to be profes
sionals. . . The objective of The
Bridge is to be there and be ob
jective in helping our peers
solve their own problems." Stu
dent peer counseling groups are
rare nationwide, she added.
