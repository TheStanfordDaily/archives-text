# Pidgin study is not for the birds
## 
### ELLI VEIDEMAN 
For more than a few people,
the thoughts that may arise
about a pidgin or Creole lan
guage are often digested with
the last few bites of chicken
gumbo that brought them on.
Though the topic has not re
ceived wide attention in the
past, there is an increasing
amount of interest developing in
the area of pidgin and Creole
languages at Stanford.
Linguistics Prof. John Rickford
explained that pidgin is really
nobody's native language.
Rather it is the result of "two or
more groups essentially trying to
communicate through a third
language."
Situations involving trade,
plantation life, colonialism and
military operations provide the
"classic hallmark of a pidgin cre
ation situation," Rickford said.
When individuals find it ineffi
cient to learn each others' lan
guage, they develop a sub
sequent mixed language that
will serve basic communication
needs.
Often when speakers of sev
eral mutually unintelligible lan
guages comr> together and find
themselves to be social subordi
nates to a socially dominant
minority with its own language,
it is this "prestige language" that
becomes pidginized and pro
vides much of the vocabulary of
the mixed language.
Should the catalysts that spur
red the development of the pid
gin disappear, often the lan
guage will also dissipate. On the
other hand, if there is pressure
for the pidgin to become more
complex, it may develop into a
Creole. This often occurs when
children begin to use pidgin as
their primary language.
|im Fox, professor of linguis
tics and anthropology here said
the University is in a "unique
situation" in regard to Creole
and pidgin language studies.

There are at least five faculty
members who work in this area.
In addition, some professors
hired for other reasons also have
interests in pidgin and Creole
languages.
As a result, Fox said, the Uni
versity has "one of the strongest
faculties in the world in
number."
The diversified areas of study
of faculty members insure re
search information from a wide
spectrum: pidgin and Creoles of
West Africa, Russia and the
Philippines.
Thus an increasing number of
students and scholars are being
attracted to the University as a
result of its strong faculty, its
growing library collection,
numerous classes and the
amount of student direction that
is available.
One of the factors that has
helped Stanford gain attention
as the center for Creole and pid
gin studies is the newsletter the
Carrier Pidgin.
The Cairier is an international
newsletter with SCO foreign and
domestic subscribers that came
to Stanford a year ago when
Rickford became editor and Fox
became associate editor. It car
ries information about world
wide pidgin and Creole confer
ences, lectures, publications,
books, scholars and other hap
penings in the field.
Fox said the Carrier is "having
an impact on places where
Creole and pidgin is spoken."
One of the distinctive qualities
of the Carrier is that it allows the
faculty to be in contact with
scholars around the world. The
Carrier also makes Stanford the
news receiving center for inter
national happenings in the field.
Last spring Stanford libraries
had a display of pidgin and
Creole articles. Now they are in
volved in acquiring an increas
ing number of Creole and pidgin
materials. As a result of upping

the acquisition priority of these
sorts of materials, the library will
now order anything that is pub
lished on the subject. Fox said that
in a few years Stanford will have
one of the largest library acquisi
tions of Creole and pidgin litera
ture.
Rickford explained that there
are three theories to explain the
sudden popularity of pidgin.
The first is the process of lan
guage contact and change. Pid
gin and Creole involve the ex
tremes of this sort of change and
"challenge our conceptions,"
thus providing good material for
model and theory building. This
is of interest to people involved
in the study of language and so
cial issues.

Second, specific socio
economic factors can create a
situation where some sort of
societal breakdown is the reason
for linguistic change. These
changes offer a challenge to try
ing to describe the reasons for
variation in language. Thus pid
gin and Creole offer themselves

as "nice test cases" for the
theories.
Finally, entering into the
realm of human cognition,
Creole offers those studying the
theories of language acquisition
and origin an opportunity to see
what genetic traits are responsi
ble for the "linguistic universals
that all human beings are born
with."
Another practical reason for
studying Creole and pidgin is
that very often the societies that
speak them involve people in
countries that are developing
and are in the process of creat
ing educational programs. Re
searchers are interested in the
manner in which pidgin and
Creole languages are incorpo
rated or deleted from these
programs and the subsequent
effects on student learning.
Rickford, a native speaker of
Guyanese Creole, became in
terested in linguistics after he
read an article that discussed the
problems in using English to
teach students whose primary
language was Creole.
It seems that pidgins and
Creoles have often been stig
matized and negatively labeled,
resulting in pressure for the
speaker to conform to the stan
dard language. But pidgin and

Creole languages have also been
viewed "as a sign of solidarity
and as symbols of truth and real
ity."
Fox was first intrigued by pid
gin 10 years ago while searching
for a term paper subject for a
language and culture class.
When his instructor mentioned
"Russenorsk" as an example of a
northeastern European pidgin,
Fox discovered a topic for his
paper as well as a long-term in
terest in the theory of such lan
guages.
When Fox arrived at Stanford,
he offered the first course in
Creoles and pidgins, a course
which he now teaches alter
nately with Rickford and others.
He attributes the growing in
terest in the field to the
realization of anthropological
and linguistic groups that the
process of language acquisition
is very interesting to theory ap
plications.
In addition, the numerous var
iations are "simply fun to look
at" in themselves, he said.
"Creoles are in the best of
livelihoods in some pla
ces . . . and pidgins are a tribute
to the people who formed them
â€” they are a significant inven
tion."
