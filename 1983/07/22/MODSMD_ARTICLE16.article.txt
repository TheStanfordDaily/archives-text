# 'Socrates' could answer library questions
## 
### CAROL PUTNAM 
"Welcome to SOCRATES,"
reads the screen in front of you
at Green or Meyer Library. You
are looking for a book by
Charles Dickens, but can't re
member the name. You have
also never used a computer be
fore and are a little unsure of
how to look for your book. But
you notice that at the bottom of
the screen, it says, "For intro
ductory information, type HELP
and then press the RETURN
key." You decide to be brave
and follow these instructions. In
a moment, the screen displays
an explanation of the two modes
(LOOKUP and COMMAND),
and simply stated information
about the basic use of the Stan
ford libraries public on-line
catalog.
After reading all the informa
tion, you decide that LOOKUP
mode sounds like what you want
to use. This mode is "menu
driven," which, as you have
learned, means that a menu or
list of options appears on the
screen. You choose the option
which allows you to see all the
books written by Charles Dic
kens in the file. A moment later,
the screen gives you an explana
tion of how the search is being
done and displays the books by
Charles Dickens. You look
through and immediately rec
ognize the one you sought:
Oliver Twist.
You also find out where the
book is located in the library and
what the book is about. Proud
that you can now use a compu
ter, you type "END" as in
structed, and go off to find your
book.
As one of several librarians
writing the welcome screen and
other texts, David Langenberg,
Data Services Specialist at Green
library, has been "trying to put
(himself) in the place of some
one who knows nothing about
computers. The idea is for the
system to be self-explanatory

and require only a minimum of
staff involvement."
SOCRATES is currently being
tested by library staff members
and a few others. By the end of
the evaluation period, Aug. 12,
Langenberg hopes that any
problems will be found.
There will be four public loca
tions of terminals: five in Meyer,
three in Green Library, one in
Terman Engineering Library, and
one in Falconer Biology Library:
"The biggest misconception
will be that (the catalog) doesn't
include all records in the card
catalog," Langenberg said. As
the welcome screen states,
"SOCRATES includes informa
tion about all material in Meyer
Undergraduate Library and
about materials in other libraries
at Stanford catalogued or ac
quired from 1973 on. By using
this online catalog, you have ac
cess to over 900,000 citations to
books, journals and material in
other media."
There are approximately 4.5
million records in all the Stan
ford libraries, so this is a consid
erable portion, Langenberg
said.
"Maybe in 50 years the com
puter will replace the card
catalog, but we'll probably al
ways have to live with old re
cords in the card catalog."
Besides LOOKUP, there isalso
a COMMAND mode which re
quires some knowledge of com
puter language. Langenberg
hopes that there will be a
"minimum of documentation"
but will probably provide a
Users Guide to this mode. The
user will also be able to type
HELP at any time in COMMAND
mode for a self-tutorial. HELP is
also available at any time in the
LOOKUP mode. Each mode has
a vast variety of services and will
dramatically reduce the amount
of time required to do any re
search.
You are now back at the com
puter in Meyer looking for a

book for which you can't re
member the title or the author's
name, but you know it has the
word, "excellence" in the title.
You have become well versed in
using SOCRATES and are able to
find your book, In Search of Ex
cellence by Thomas Peters and
Robert Waterman.
Unfortunately, after searching
for the book, the librarian tells
you that it is lost and cannot be
found. You need this book for
some urgent research, you tell
the librarian. He/she informs
you that by taking advantage of
Stanford's access to the Re
search Libraries Information

Network (RLIN), it will be possi
ble to find out who has the book,
and have it sent to Stanford as a
special lending favor in about 24
hours, at no charge.
RLIN is a complex data base
used by members of the Re
search Libraries Group (RLG) for
inter-library loan and searching
for bibliographic records. Hallie
Perry, of Inter-Library Services,
explains that despite the high
cost of such a network, the
members of RLG have agreed to
operate on a cooperative basis,
each absorbing any costs incur
red with the assumption that it
comes out even in the long run.
RLG is a "member-owned
consortium of universities and a
few other members," explained
Karen Wittenborg, curator of
the Social Science Collections at
Green Library. "Each member
contributes records of its hold
ings to the data base (RLIN) and

the libraries use it for catalogu
ing and reference work."
RLG, however, does
things as well, said,
such as saving materials that are
in danger of extinction, out
reach programs for library ser
vices, lending dissertations, and
other resource sharing ac
tivities.
As you are contemplating this
prospect, a yellow flyer catches
your eye. It reads, "SAVE VALU
ABLE RESEARCH TIME." The
flyer informs you that through
the Computer Search Services of
the Stanford libraries, a library
staff member can retrieve refer
ences to such information for
you in a short time with the help
of over 125 data bases. Refer
ences of books, conference
proceedings, dissertations,
government documents, statis
tics and patent information and
journal articles, often accom
panied by summaries and tai
lored to specific, individual
needs are all available through
this service.
Funding is not currently avail
able to provide this service free
to library users, so Stanford is
forced to pass some of the cost
on to the customer. These costs
generally range from $10 to $30,
depending on the time required
to perform the search, the data
bases used, and the printout
time.
Langenberg says that while
the pricing structures of each
data base may change and the
cost may decline relative to
other services, these will not be
significant enough to decrease
the fees of the service.
The data bases are highly
complex and contain a wide
range of information. Some
works of reference are already
on data bases, as are the full
texts of some journals (for
example, The Harvard Business
Review.)
"It is possible/' Langenberg
said, "to read a whole article on
the computer, but not many
people like to do that. It's tedi
ous and tiring."
He added that these comput
ers and data bases will not re
place books or magazines.
"Both will exist for different
purposes."
