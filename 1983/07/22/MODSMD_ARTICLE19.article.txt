# The 						Beat fills in the pieces

### TIM GRIEVE 
Every once in a while — a great
while — a true record bargain
comes along. Prince's two
record 7999 album at $7.99 was
one. The two Exposed two
record collections at $1.49 each
were others.
Now comes a new collection
by the English Beat, What Is
Beat?. At about 10 bucks for this
two-record greatest hits pac
kage, this one's a real bargain.
But wait a minute? The English
Beat? Greatest Hits? Haven't
they only had three albums?
That's right, but who cares?
For about 10 bucks you get ev
erything you need by the English
Beat, plus an album full of tunes
that are just fun to have.
Everyone should have some
English Beat, and What Is Beat?
offers the chance to get the Beat
without paying too much for it.
Beat music is party music, and
the first of the two records of
What Is Beat? go a long way to
prove that. There's nothing on

the record that wouldn't be right
at home on any party tape.
"Tears of a Clown," "Hand's Off
. . . She's Mine," "Mirror In the
Bathroom," "Twist and Crawl,"
"Can't Get Used to Losing You"
and "Rankin' Full Stop" are just
great party tunes. All those on
one record? Vipes!
Also on the same record,
"Stand Down Margaret," which
originally appeared on the end
of "Whine and Grind" on the
band's first album, gets the full
treatment. While on The English
Beat the song was pretty much
an afterthought, here it stands
out as it should, with a spacey
echoing saxophone and equally
extra-terrestrial sounding voc
als.
Unfortunately, there's just not
much to say about this record.
None of the songs are new;
they're just great.
The second of the two records
contains previously
unreleased-on-any-album ver
sions of Beat songs. "Twist and

Crawl" receives a nice extended
treatment here and"I Confess"
gets an interesting, although not
inspired, dub job.
Some of the tunes on thi part
of What Is Beat? are major suc
cesses, some are jus' interest
ing. All are quintessential Beat
and all make the album worth
buying.
What Is Beat? also provides an
interesting study in the short his
tory of the band. In just three
albums the group has changed
its sound dramatically, from the
ska-reggae sound on the cuts off
The English Beat to the
smoother, slicker and popper
numbers from Special Boat Ser
vice.
While die-hard early Beat fans
complain that the band has sold
out ("We don't like them since
they gave up ska"), the rest of us
can sit back and enjoy — or more
likely, get up and dance to —all
the sounds of the Beat.
What Is Beat? This album pro
vides the answer.
