# Big collider project gets the go-ahead

After recent approval by Pres
ident Reagan, plans are now un
derway to begin construction of
a new $112 million machine to
study subatomic particles at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC).
The new machine, named SLC
(for SLAC linear Collider), was
recently approved by Reagan as
part of an appropriations bill that
provides $32 million for the first
year of construction.
The new machine, operated
by the University under contract
with the Department of Energy,
will be located at the present site
of SLAC's two-mile-long linear
accelerator.
The appropriations for SLC
followed after more than two
years of governmental and sci
entific review in a time when
budgeting for fundamental par
ticle research has steadily de
creased.
SLAC Director Wolfgang
Panof ky said that the new pro
ject is the only new major con
struction project in science au
thorized this year.
Panofsky added that "the
budget was always tight" and
that total money allotted to fun
damental scientific research has
"been going down."
In the SLC, two powerful
beams — one containing elec
trons, the opposing one posit
rons — are accelerated from the
two-mile-long electron ac
celerator where they are bent
around, via magnets, and fo
cused on a microscopic spot.
When the two opposite
charges collide, they are de
stroyed in a burst of energy,
creating new combinations of
subatomic particles.
With SLC, the traditional
method for colliding particles
has been bypassed, and a rela
tively new method incorpo
rated.
Traditionally, the method
used for electron-positron col
liders has been storage rings,

whce mapnels keep 'he parti
cles moving, at near light speed,
around a racetrack. The two op
posing beams pass each other
more than 10 million times a mi
nute.
With the new linear collider,
the "one shot" collisions are
1000 times less frequent, but will
be compensated for by a greatly
reduced collision spot.
At high energies, the storage
ring method for colliding beams
becomes much more expensive.
Thus the colliding beam
technology incorporated in SLC
becomes much more economi
cally feasible.
At the energy output that SLC
is expected to operate, a similar
storage ring facility would cost
more than $500 million and be
more than 15 miles long. The
new machine fits well within the
present site.
With this new machine, new
plateaus in high energy physics
can be achieved. The SLC will
produce the recently discovered
carrier of the "weak force" cal
led Zl, the dominant force at
high energies. With SLC, a de
tailed study and research of the
weak force at can be done.
The information obtained
from the new machine contains
no real applications besides
basic science.
According to Panofsky, the
project serves a dual role. First,
scientists will be able to observe
new phenomena and reactions
using SLC as the "tool."
Second, the project will help
researchers to gain more know
ledge and to pioneer research
using the new more economical
"single pass linear collider"
technology incorporated in the
new accelerator.
Panofsky concluded that the
United States is at the "cutting
edge of technology."
"The benefit of particle re
search is fundamental . . he
said. "Both the Democrats and
Republicans have supported re
search."
Much of SLC involves modifi
cation of SLAC's existing linear
accelerator. The latter's energy
output is expected to be in
creased over 60 percent and new

computers will steer the beam to
its exact location.
The biggest new piece of
machinery will be underground
magnets that will guide the elec
tron and positron beams to its
final location. Much of the actual
construction will be done by
local industry.
|ohn Rees, SLC project direc
tor, said he expects the con
struction to begin in October.
