# 'Bourbon Street' on a riverboat
## 
### MARC FAJER 
Farce is an exceedingly dif
ficult form of entertainment. If
the pace andtimingarenot close
to perfect, it has all the allure
and charm of flat champagne.
Fortunately, in Theatre Works
new production, The Belle of
Bourbon Street, which opened
Friday night at the Lucie Stern
Community Center in Palo Alto,
director Steven Young has care
fully crafted the necessary ele
ments to produce a very enter
taining production.
The show is based on La Dame
de Chez Maxim by Georges
Feydeau, and has been freely
adapted by Young and Theat
re Works artistic director Robert
Kelley and reset in 1895 New Or
leans. The result is replete with
the plot twists, narrow escapes
and amorous escapades that
make for good farce, and, de
spite a few small flaws, makes for
a very funny evening of theater.
The play concerns a rather in
effectual doctor named Petypon
(Jeff Schwamberger) who has
the misfortune to bring home a
Bourbon Street chanteuse
(Susanna Woods) when drunk
