# 'Bourbon Street' on a riverboat
## 
### MARC FAJER 
Farce is an exceedingly dif
ficult form of entertainment. If
the pace andtimingarenot close
to perfect, it has all the allure
and charm of flat champagne.
Fortunately, in Theatre Works
new production, The Belle of
Bourbon Street, which opened
Friday night at the Lucie Stern
Community Center in Palo Alto,
director Steven Young has care
fully crafted the necessary ele
ments to produce a very enter
taining production.
The show is based on La Dame
de Chez Maxim by Georges
Feydeau, and has been freely
adapted by Young and Theat
re Works artistic director Robert
Kelley and reset in 1895 New Or
leans. The result is replete with
the plot twists, narrow escapes
and amorous escapades that
make for good farce, and, de
spite a few small flaws, makes for
a very funny evening of theater.
The play concerns a rather in
effectual doctor named Petypon
(Jeff Schwamberger) who has
the misfortune to bring home a
Bourbon Street chanteuse
(Susanna Woods) when drunk

Shrimp's, Lieutenant Rhett Dup
ree (Paul Roder), who is thrilled
neither about his nuptials nor
about the Shrimp's affair with
the doctor. Naturally, they all
end up aboard the uncle's river
boat together, and all hell breaks
loose.
The undoubted stars of the
evening are the two leading
ladies. Woods has enough
charm and sparkle onstage to
carry a show by herself, and is a
pleasure to watch throughout
the evening, whether wrapped
in a sheet with a shower ring as
halo portraying the martyred St.
Violetta, or teaching the upriver
women New Orleans dance hall
language as though it were the
height of fashion. Burch, on the
other hand, is all bluster and
bombast as she dominates every
scene in which she appears. She

one evening. His wife Gabrielle,
who is very religious, is narrowly
averted from discovering the
girl's presence when the quick
thinking singer (whose name is
Shrimp Creole) stages a religi
ous visitation by St. Violetta.
When Gabrielle, convinced she
has been blessed, rushes off, the
doctor's uncle (Richard Edgar)
arrives. He has come to bring the
doctor to the marriage of his
niece, Clementine (Jody Corwin
Babbington), mistakes Shrimp
for Mrs.,Petypon, and insists that
she come along.
It turns out that Clementine is
marrying an old flame of the

has a magical face that runs the
whole range of expressions and
a voice that could probably shat
ter granite in her moments of
righteous rage or religious rap
ture. The two women are on
stage for almost the whole even
ing, and they make the show
memorable in many places.

Burch has a magical face that runs the whole
range of expressions and a voice that could
probably shatter granite in her moments of
righteous rage or religious rapture.

The supporting cast is gener
ally quite good. Andrew Harris
has some very good moments as
the doctor's colleague, Roscoe
Monroe. Schwamberger, as the
embattled doctor himself, over-

plays a little bit at the beginning,
but is more than competent for
the rest of the play. Richard
Edgar is very tunny as the uncle,
as is Babbington as his niece (she
has found a laugh that defies de
scription). Gordon Shephard is a
stitch as an oversized son of a
Vanderbilt who is none to

bright, but captivates the Shrimp
anyway. Dee Hawkins does her
usual fine turn as the Vanderbilt
mother who prowls about the
stage with her earhorn in hand,
trying to keep up with the action

that she can't hear. Paul Roder is
also good as the blustering
lieutenant.
Special praise goes to director
Young for the careful handling
of the timing. The show never
drags, but never reaches surh a
frenetic pace that you lose 'â€¢ ack
of lines or action. The c rones in
which Gabrielle is being "vis
ited" by saints are particularly
well done. There is also a run
ning (sitting?) gag with a chair
that manages to be funny every
time it recurs.
The Belle of Bourbon Street
plays in repertory through Aug.
14. It is a very funny show, and
the performances of Susanna
Woods and Kathy Burch are
small treasures that Should not
be missed. It is a | 'Vasure to
watch a farce that d( \ ot de
generate into, well, a .
