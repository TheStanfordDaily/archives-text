## Chic dining...Chic's on the water 
### 
Chic's Place
Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf
San Francisco
(415) 421-2442
It's almost a given that you'll
be fed like royalty at an expen
sive seafood restaurant over
looking the Bay. But what makes
Chic's (pronounced Chick's)
Place different is that you're
treated like royalty as well.

Don't let the Pier 39/
Fisherman's Wharf address
scare you — Chic's is not a
tourist trap. It is a family-run,
lovingly cared-for restaurant. Al
though most San Franciscans are
far more familiar with the Water
front, Scoma's and other nearby
seafood eateries, Chic's has in
fact been in operation for five
years, under the direction of the
Martinez and Watt families.

(Co-owner George Martinez ran
the Tia Maria Mexican chain be
fore opening Chic's Place.)
We accidentally — and fortu
nately, view-wise — arrived at
sunset. The view through Chic's
large windows facing the Bay is
simply tremendous. And every
table can enjoy it.
From the minute we set foot in
the spacious, art noveau
decorated restaurant, we knew
we were in for a sumptuous
celebration of the senses: an
unsurpassed look out at Alcat
raz, the Golden Gate and the
Marina, and an enticing whiff of
broiling seafood. The rather
noisy kitchen background was
notannoying; it merely added to
the convivial spirit.
Our black-tuxedoed waiter
graciously answered a barrage of
questions throughout the meal.
Thewaitersand busboyswereall
quite attentive to every diner.
Water — in goblets, of course
— and San Francisco sourdough
bread quickly appeared on our
linen-clothed table.
Chic himself showed every
diner an impressive cold platter
exhibiting the night's seafood

selection. He candidly made re
commendations as we surveyed
the selections which were dis
played on a large bed of crushed
ice. Some seasonal fish, such as
the sand dabs, are frozen, and
when broiled tend to grow dry,
he explained.
While sorting out the large
menu, it's nice to sample one of
the many Californian or French
wines available. The house wine
was found particularly delight
ful, and cost only $2 a glass.
The first sample of the even
ing: escargots! The snails could
have been slightly plumper, but
the flavorful garlic/butter sauce
more than compensated for any
deficiencies in size.
