## Chic dining...Chic's on the water 
### 
Chic's Place
Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf
San Francisco
(415) 421-2442
It's almost a given that you'll
be fed like royalty at an expen
sive seafood restaurant over
looking the Bay. But what makes
Chic's (pronounced Chick's)
Place different is that you're
treated like royalty as well.

Don't let the Pier 39/
Fisherman's Wharf address
scare you — Chic's is not a
tourist trap. It is a family-run,
lovingly cared-for restaurant. Al
though most San Franciscans are
far more familiar with the Water
front, Scoma's and other nearby
seafood eateries, Chic's has in
fact been in operation for five
years, under the direction of the
Martinez and Watt families.

(Co-owner George Martinez ran
the Tia Maria Mexican chain be
fore opening Chic's Place.)
We accidentally — and fortu
nately, view-wise — arrived at
sunset. The view through Chic's
large windows facing the Bay is
simply tremendous. And every
table can enjoy it.
From the minute we set foot in
the spacious, art noveau
decorated restaurant, we knew
we were in for a sumptuous
celebration of the senses: an
unsurpassed look out at Alcat
raz, the Golden Gate and the
Marina, and an enticing whiff of
broiling seafood. The rather
noisy kitchen background was
notannoying; it merely added to
the convivial spirit.
Our black-tuxedoed waiter
graciously answered a barrage of
questions throughout the meal.
Thewaitersand busboyswereall
quite attentive to every diner.
Water — in goblets, of course
— and San Francisco sourdough
bread quickly appeared on our
linen-clothed table.
Chic himself showed every
diner an impressive cold platter
exhibiting the night's seafood

selection. He candidly made re
commendations as we surveyed
the selections which were dis
played on a large bed of crushed
ice. Some seasonal fish, such as
the sand dabs, are frozen, and
when broiled tend to grow dry,
he explained.
While sorting out the large
menu, it's nice to sample one of
the many Californian or French
wines available. The house wine
was found particularly delight
ful, and cost only $2 a glass.
The first sample of the even
ing: escargots! The snails could
have been slightly plumper, but
the flavorful garlic/butter sauce
more than compensated for any
deficiencies in size.


Even the standard butter let
tuce was not standard, largely
due to its wonderful vinaigrette
dressing. (We found sauces to
be a specialty of Chic's Place.)
Finely chopped egg added to the
fresh salad.
Faced with the difficult task of
choosing an entree, we decided
on the chef's special dinner
($14.25) and the linguini al pesto
($5.95), just to try a non-seafood
alternative.

The linguini, thin-cut pasta in
a basil, olive oil and garlic sauce,
with a side dish of parmesan,
was just right and not too rich.
However, Weight Watchers
would undoubtedly ban it from
its acceptable foods menu!
The Chef's Special dinner
began with a bowl of clam
chowder followed by fresh gril
led salmon, sauteed prawns,
fresh scallops, sole and Oysters
Rockefeller. It is ideal for the in
decisive seafood buyer. But for
those concerned with the ut
most freshness and best-cooked
meal, it is wise to stick with a
single-seafood offering. A nib
ble of everything, though, was
fine for us.

The dishes were attractively
arranged; one could easily pic
ture them on the cover of Gour
met magazine.
Not ones to turn down de
ssert, we even sampled the sin
fully rich, densely packed
chocolate mousse torte. It fea
tured a chocolate crumb crust
and was topped with a dollop of
whipped cream. (It was probably
not fresh cream, however.) De
sserts are prepared both by
Chic's chef and local fine
bakeries.
The verdict:
The food is superb. But the
warm, friendly, relaxing am
biance of Chic's is what makes
diningthere truly enjoyable. The
restaurant was almost filled on
the Tuesday night of our visit, so
we suggest reservations al
though they are not required.
Seating is available for 172 di

ners. Banquet facilities, perfect
for wedding receptions, pre
dance dinners and the like, are
also available in small (24-
person) alcoves. (The restaurant
is divided into three sections,
which are all part on one large
room.) Chic's Place — consider
ing the overall food and service
treatment — is not overpriced. A
couple could eat well tor $50.
So next time you're about to
go to an old standby seafood re
staurant, think twice. Chic's is
nearby, and the atmosphere is
simply the best. Enjoy!

celebration of the senses: an
unsurpassed look out at Alcat
raz, the Golden Gate and the
Marina, and an enticing whiff of
broiling seafood. The rather
noisy kitchen background was
notannoying; it merely added to
the convivial spirit.
Our black-tuxedoed waiter
graciously answered a barrage of
questions throughout the meal.
Thewaitersand busboyswereall
quite attentive to every diner.
Water — in goblets, of course
— and San Francisco sourdough
bread quickly appeared on our
linen-clothed table.
Chic himself showed every
diner an impressive cold platter
exhibiting the night's seafood

selection. He candidly made re
commendations as we surveyed
the selections which were dis
played on a large bed of crushed
ice. Some seasonal fish, such as
the sand dabs, are frozen, and
when broiled tend to grow dry,
he explained.
While sorting out the large
menu, it's nice to sample one of
the many Californian or French
wines available. The house wine
was found particularly delight
ful, and cost only $2 a glass.
The first sample of the even
ing: escargots! The snails could
have been slightly plumper, but
the flavorful garlic/butter sauce
more than compensated for any
deficiencies in size.


Even the standard butter let
tuce was not standard, largely
due to its wonderful vinaigrette
dressing. (We found sauces to
be a specialty of Chic's Place.)
Finely chopped egg added to the
fresh salad.
Faced with the difficult task of
choosing an entree, we decided
on the chef's special dinner
($14.25) and the linguini al pesto
($5.95), just to try a non-seafood
alternative.

The linguini, thin-cut pasta in
a basil, olive oil and garlic sauce,
with a side dish of parmesan,
was just right and not too rich.
However, Weight Watchers
would undoubtedly ban it from
its acceptable foods menu!
The Chef's Special dinner
began with a bowl of clam
chowder followed by fresh gril
led salmon, sauteed prawns,
fresh scallops, sole and Oysters
Rockefeller. It is ideal for the in
decisive seafood buyer. But for
those concerned with the ut
most freshness and best-cooked
meal, it is wise to stick with a
single-seafood offering. A nib
ble of everything, though, was
fine for us.

The dishes were attractively
arranged; one could easily pic
ture them on the cover of Gour
met magazine.
Not ones to turn down de
ssert, we even sampled the sin
fully rich, densely packed
chocolate mousse torte. It fea
tured a chocolate crumb crust
and was topped with a dollop of
whipped cream. (It was probably
not fresh cream, however.) De
sserts are prepared both by
Chic's chef and local fine
bakeries.
The verdict:
The food is superb. But the
warm, friendly, relaxing am
biance of Chic's is what makes
diningthere truly enjoyable. The
restaurant was almost filled on
the Tuesday night of our visit, so
we suggest reservations al
though they are not required.
Seating is available for 172 di

ners. Banquet facilities, perfect
for wedding receptions, pre
dance dinners and the like, are
also available in small (24-
person) alcoves. (The restaurant
is divided into three sections,
which are all part on one large
room.) Chic's Place — consider
ing the overall food and service
treatment — is not overpriced. A
couple could eat well tor $50.
So next time you're about to
go to an old standby seafood re
staurant, think twice. Chic's is
nearby, and the atmosphere is
simply the best. Enjoy!
