The Cat and the Canary (1927)
★
Fox, Redwood City
Delightful. In this late-silent
adaptation of a stage play by lohn
Willard, an eccentric old man
who feels like a canary
threatened by vicious, greedy
feline relatives dies, leavingawill
that may not be opened for 20
years. The heiress, it turns out, is
his niece Annabelle (Laura La
Plante), but there is an alternative
heir (whose name resides in a
sealed envelope in the lawyer's
possession) in case Annabelle
should be proven non compos
mentis. So the metaphor of the
title shifts to Annabelle and all of
her relatives, who are staying in
her uncle's house with her. To
further complicate matters, a
murderer is loose who tears his
victims topieces with acat'sclaw.
The German emigre director,
Paul Leni, employed Expres
sionist techniques on this witty
parody-thriller, so it's extremely
imaginative — the mansion looks
like an art deco version of a
medieval castle, and even the in

tertitles are deigned with unusual
flourishes. The cast includes Ger
trude Astor, Lucien Littlefield, Ar
thur Edward Carew, Tully Mar
shall and Creighton Hale, who is
dressed to look like Harold
Lloyd. The original prints were in
single-strip (red-orange)
Technicolor, which gave the ef
fect of bathing every frame in an
orange-brown wash.
Plays Wednesday with Flesh
and Blood.

Ivan the Terrible, Part I (1944)
★
Terman Auditorium
In the first half of Sergei Eisens
tein's epic, Ivan (Nikolai Cher
kassov) attains the crown and
loses it. The movie is both
baroque and Expressionistic,
with physically and psychologi
cally deformed figures behind
every door and around every
corner, spying and whispering —
the entire palace seems to have
been usurped by some creepy
sub-species of human life. It's
certainly a brilliant, an overpow
ering work, not to be missed, but
it's also frozen and repellent.
Shot by Edouard Tisse, with a
famous musical score by Pro
kofieff.
Plays tonight.
10 (1979)
Memorial Auditorium
The writer-director, Blake Ed
wards, attempts both a satire on
the erotic fantasies of a post-40-
year-old male and a serious
examination of male menopause
— with mixed results. Dudley
Moore, the pixieish Britis comic,
is practically a genius at compli
cated physical comedy, and the
, monomania of his character's
★ Highly recommended

search tor his sexual dream (Bo
Derek, perfect as hilariously,
blissfully vacuous Jennifer) pro
vides Edwards with all the excuse
he needs to spin out a wonderful
string of slapstick routines. How
ever, the movie sermonizes in
terminably and inexplicably
about how misguided Moore is
because he prefers Derek to lulie
Andrews (acting in her crisp WAC
style). With a surprisingly moving
performance bv Robert Webber
as Moore's homosexual triend.
Plays Sunday evening.
The Pirate (1948)
Fox, Redwood City
This Vincente Minnelli musical
is low on invention (even the
Cole Porter score totters: he
must have expended all his
energy that vear on his Broadway
hit, Kiss Me, Kate) yet high
spirited and amiable, 112 he source
is a play by S.N. Behrman about
the romance of a young woman
in the Caribbean and an actor
who plays the role of the pirate
she fantasizes about, Mack the
Black, l uckily, ludv Garland and
Gene Kellv are the principals, and
though the supporting cast (Wal
ter Slezak, Reginald Owen,
Gladys Cooper) is a bit stiff, the
amazingly athletic dancers, The
Nicholas Brothers, make an ap
pearance. The hit song (and best
number), "Be a Clown," bears a
strong musical resemblance to
the great "Make 'Em Laugh"
number in Singin' in the Rain
(which came four years later).
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Pirates of Penzance.
Midnight Express (1978)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The tale of Billy Hayes, who
was put in a Turkish jail for at
tempting to smuggle hash out of
the country, has been turned into
a lurid piece of audience manipu
lation by director Alan Parker.
(Oliver Stone did the adapta

tion.) Parker has no compunc
tions about interpolating the
sound ot a racing heartbeat into
the soundtrack to rev up the sus
pense, or employing a glossy tab
loid style tor the prison scenes.
When it was released, this
shameful movie pretended to be
a plea for reform: a postscript
proclaimed that it had opened
the door for negotiations bet
ween the United States and Tur
key about the release of Ameri
can prisoners. Vou got the idea
that the purveyors of this most
crass slice of Hollywood com
mercialism were actually bucking
lor a Nobel Peace Prize. With
Brad Davis as Billy, John Hurt,
Randy Quaid, Bo Hopkins, Mike
Kellin and Paul Smith.
Plays Wednesday with Yol.
Network (1976)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is the movie in which Peter
Finch, giving his tinal perfor
mance, as a rabble-rousing TV
show host (a kind of hot-line
Elmer Gantry), tells his viewers to
scream out the nearest window,
"I'm mad as hell and I'm not
going to take this anymore!"
That's virtually the extent of
screenwriter Paddy Chayefskv s
invention. Chayefsky thinks he's
satirizing IV, but he has a TV wri
ter's mentality. One long purple
tirade follows another, almost
without a break. Except for one
sketch in which a black woman
Communist, the leader of the
Ecumenical Liberation Army (a
take-off on the SLA) and their
kidnapped celebrity (read Patty
Hearst, of course) meet with
executives to discuss the budget
for a projected TV series, the
trying-to-be-wild satirical scenes
flounder, and the straight narra
tive scenes a deux are even worse
— dreadful to act and dreadfully
acted.
Plays today with King of Com
edy.

The Cat and the Canary (1927)
★
Fox, Redwood City
Delightful. In this late-silent
adaptation of a stage play by lohn
Willard, an eccentric old man
who feels like a canary
threatened by vicious, greedy
feline relatives dies, leavingawill
that may not be opened for 20
years. The heiress, it turns out, is
his niece Annabelle (Laura La
Plante), but there is an alternative
heir (whose name resides in a
sealed envelope in the lawyer's
possession) in case Annabelle
should be proven non compos
mentis. So the metaphor of the
title shifts to Annabelle and all of
her relatives, who are staying in
her uncle's house with her. To
further complicate matters, a
murderer is loose who tears his
victims topieces with acat'sclaw.
The German emigre director,
Paul Leni, employed Expres
sionist techniques on this witty
parody-thriller, so it's extremely
imaginative — the mansion looks
like an art deco version of a
medieval castle, and even the in

tertitles are deigned with unusual
flourishes. The cast includes Ger
trude Astor, Lucien Littlefield, Ar
thur Edward Carew, Tully Mar
shall and Creighton Hale, who is
dressed to look like Harold
Lloyd. The original prints were in
single-strip (red-orange)
Technicolor, which gave the ef
fect of bathing every frame in an
orange-brown wash.
Plays Wednesday with Flesh
and Blood.

Ivan the Terrible, Part I (1944)
★
Terman Auditorium
In the first half of Sergei Eisens
tein's epic, Ivan (Nikolai Cher
kassov) attains the crown and
loses it. The movie is both
baroque and Expressionistic,
with physically and psychologi
cally deformed figures behind
every door and around every
corner, spying and whispering —
the entire palace seems to have
been usurped by some creepy
sub-species of human life. It's
certainly a brilliant, an overpow
ering work, not to be missed, but
it's also frozen and repellent.
Shot by Edouard Tisse, with a
famous musical score by Pro
kofieff.
Plays tonight.
10 (1979)
Memorial Auditorium
The writer-director, Blake Ed
wards, attempts both a satire on
the erotic fantasies of a post-40-
year-old male and a serious
examination of male menopause
— with mixed results. Dudley
Moore, the pixieish Britis comic,
is practically a genius at compli
cated physical comedy, and the
, monomania of his character's

search tor his sexual dream (Bo
Derek, perfect as hilariously,
blissfully vacuous Jennifer) pro
vides Edwards with all the excuse
he needs to spin out a wonderful
string of slapstick routines. How
ever, the movie sermonizes in
terminably and inexplicably
about how misguided Moore is
because he prefers Derek to lulie
Andrews (acting in her crisp WAC
style). With a surprisingly moving
performance bv Robert Webber
as Moore's homosexual triend.
Plays Sunday evening.
The Pirate (1948)
Fox, Redwood City
This Vincente Minnelli musical
is low on invention (even the
Cole Porter score totters: he
must have expended all his
energy that vear on his Broadway
hit, Kiss Me, Kate) yet high
spirited and amiable, 112 he source
is a play by S.N. Behrman about
the romance of a young woman
in the Caribbean and an actor
who plays the role of the pirate
she fantasizes about, Mack the
Black, l uckily, ludv Garland and
Gene Kellv are the principals, and
though the supporting cast (Wal
ter Slezak, Reginald Owen,
Gladys Cooper) is a bit stiff, the
amazingly athletic dancers, The
Nicholas Brothers, make an ap
pearance. The hit song (and best
number), "Be a Clown," bears a
strong musical resemblance to
the great "Make 'Em Laugh"
number in Singin' in the Rain
(which came four years later).
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with The Pirates of Penzance.
Midnight Express (1978)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The tale of Billy Hayes, who
was put in a Turkish jail for at
tempting to smuggle hash out of
the country, has been turned into
a lurid piece of audience manipu
lation by director Alan Parker.
(Oliver Stone did the adapta

tion.) Parker has no compunc
tions about interpolating the
sound ot a racing heartbeat into
the soundtrack to rev up the sus
pense, or employing a glossy tab
loid style tor the prison scenes.
When it was released, this
shameful movie pretended to be
a plea for reform: a postscript
proclaimed that it had opened
the door for negotiations bet
ween the United States and Tur
key about the release of Ameri
can prisoners. Vou got the idea
that the purveyors of this most
crass slice of Hollywood com
mercialism were actually bucking
lor a Nobel Peace Prize. With
Brad Davis as Billy, John Hurt,
Randy Quaid, Bo Hopkins, Mike
Kellin and Paul Smith.
Plays Wednesday with Yol.
Network (1976)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is the movie in which Peter
Finch, giving his tinal perfor
mance, as a rabble-rousing TV
show host (a kind of hot-line
Elmer Gantry), tells his viewers to
scream out the nearest window,
"I'm mad as hell and I'm not
going to take this anymore!"
That's virtually the extent of
screenwriter Paddy Chayefskv s
invention. Chayefsky thinks he's
satirizing IV, but he has a TV wri
ter's mentality. One long purple
tirade follows another, almost
without a break. Except for one
sketch in which a black woman
Communist, the leader of the
Ecumenical Liberation Army (a
take-off on the SLA) and their
kidnapped celebrity (read Patty
Hearst, of course) meet with
executives to discuss the budget
for a projected TV series, the
trying-to-be-wild satirical scenes
flounder, and the straight narra
tive scenes a deux are even worse
— dreadful to act and dreadfully
acted.
Plays today with King of Com
