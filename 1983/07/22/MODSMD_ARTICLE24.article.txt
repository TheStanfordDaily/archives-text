Deukmejian signs budget
Sacramento—Saying he was avoiding a "gen
eral tax increase, Gov. George Deukmejian
signed a $26 billion budget yesterday with $1.6
billion in cuts that hit hard at higher education,
environmental programs and legal aid for the
poor.
His action restored the state's legal spending
authority after a record 21-day lapse caused by
disputes between the Republican governor and
the Legislature's Democratic majority over taxes,
spending and reapportionment.
He said he was "delighted'' to have achieved all
the goals he set in January—to balance the budget,
pay off the state deficit, avoid a tax increase and
"hold the line on spending."
But Democratic leaders saw it differently, as did
the targets of some of the deepest budget cuts.
Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los
Angeles), said Deukmejian had balanced the
budget "by squeezing more than a billion dollars
out of the state's most helpless people."
"()nlv a sadist could be delighted in closing the
door to community colleges, the poor and the
environment," said Assemblyman John Vascon
cellos (D-Santa Glara), chairman of the Assembly
Ways and Means Gommittee.
State Community Colleges Chancellor Gerald
Hayward called a $2.54 million cut "outrageous"
and said he would oppose the first-ever, $100-a
-year tuition proposed by Deukmejian to restore
$109 million of the money.
The governor also wants fee increases of $150 at
the University of California and $230 at the Califor
nia State University to offset part of his budget
cuts.
State Public Defender Quin Denvir, who staff
was rut in half, called the action "an ideological hit
job that will hurl legal representation of poor
people appealing their criminal convictions.
()ther targets of cuts include the state farm labor
board, Coastal Commission, Energy Commission
and worker safety programs. The California Public
Broadcasting Commission is being abolished.
The budget includes four percent increases for
more than two million welfare recipients and
enough money for five percent raises for 220,000
state employees. Meril pay increases were elimi
nated.
House supports MX plans
Washington—The MX missile, a weapon embat
tled bv a decade of debate over how to base it, has

narrowly cleared another hurdle on its way to join
ing the nation's strategic nuclear arsenal in 1986.
After a blitz of telephone lobbying by President
Reagan, the House kept the program alive Wed
nesday night when it turned back, 220-207, an ef
fort to strip from a 1984 defense authorization bill
all $2.56 billion to build the first 27 of a planned 100
MX "Peacekeepers."
I he vote marked a significant narrowing of the
239-186 approval margin that the House had given
May 24 in releasing $625 million to flight-test the
10-warhead, 192,000-pound weapon.
Opponents will have another chance to kill pro
duction plans when the House considers an ap
propriation bill to provide the actual dollars for the
weapon, probably in September.
Several opponents said the closeness of the vote
led them to believe they will succeed then unless
there is dramatic progress at the arms-reduction
talks with the Soviet Union in the coming weeks.
While the House planned to act yesterday on
other MX matters, the Senate headed for a vote on
a motion to limit further debate on its own version
of the defense bill and force Sen. Gary Hart (D-
Colorado), to bring up his package of anti-MX
amendments.
The history of the MX has been marked by a
examination and rejection of nearly three dozen
basing plans since the weapon wtnt on the draw
ing boards in the early 19705.
The latest plans—suggested by a bipartisan pres
idential commission in April and quickly em
braced by Reagan—revives a once-discarded
proposal to place the MXs in underground silos in
Wyoming and Nebraska now home to Minuteman
111 missiles.
Fighting continues in Beirut
Beirut. Lebanon—Three terrorists shot their way
into Beirut's most luxurious hotel and exploded a
bomb-laden car, killing six people and wounding
18, including an Italian peacekeeping soldier,
police said yesterday.
I hey said two bodies were dug out of the rubble
yesterday morning, raising the death toll to six in
Wednesday night's attack on the Summerland
Hotel, packed with guests who had fled sectarian
violence in the nearby mountains.
In southern Lebanon, guerrillas shelled settle
ments in northern Israel Wednesday for the first
time in the l.i-month-old war, but no injuries were
reported.
Police said that in the hotel terrists machine
gunned two guards to death and detonated a car

packed with explosives, killing two parking lot at
tendees, starting a raging fire and shattering
hotel's windows. The killers fled, and police said
they had no clue as to their identities.
Among the 18 wounded by the blast were an
Italian soldier in Beirut's multinational peacekeep
ing force and an undetermined number of other
people were missing.
Firefighters struggled for three hours to control
the blaze, which came only hours after Druse
gunners in Lebanon's central mountains shelled
Christian east Beirut, killing three people includ
ing a young girl, wrecking five cars and shattering
chandeliers at a Greek Orthadox church.
Embryo transfer successful
The first successful transfer of an embryo from
one woman directly to another has been achieved
by doctors in California.
According to their report in the British medical
journal, Lancet, the doctors have achieved two
pregnancies by the technique. One of the babies
is due in four months, the other in seven months.
The technique of taking an egg grom one female
and transplanting it in another has been studied
for years, and a few years ago was successful in
animals to become a relatively widespread
method used on farm animals.
The technique may become very important to
the estimated 2 million women in this country who
have eggs but cannot become pregnant.
