# SAC protest halts aid offer mailings
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
The Financial Aids Office
will temporarily delay mail
ings of aid offers in order to
review information in the of
fers on the draft registration
link to federal student aid.
The decision to delay the
mailings came after a press
conference Tuesday morning
at which members of Stan
ford Against Conscription
(SAC) criticized the Universi
ty's decision to send out re
gistration compliance forms
without stating in the mail
ings that Stanford's policy is
to meet the financial needs of
all students, regardless of
their compliance and sub
sequent eligibility for federal
loans.

The University is required
by the Solomon Amendment
to request registration com
pliance information from
students in order to deter
mine their eligibility for fed
eral financial aid.
Robert Huff, director of fi
nancial aids, said that he will
try to meet early next week to
review the information with
Staff Counsel Iris Brest, Act
ing Dean of Students Norm
Robinson and Vice Provost
Raymond Bacchetti.
Huff would not predict
what the four will decide.
"We're going to look at the
issue and decide what ap
propriate action will be ta
ken," he said. "Beyond that I
don't want to comment."

Huff said that although he
has no exact numbers, less
than half of the 1983-84 finan
cial aid offers had been sent
out by the time the decision
was made Tuesday.

He said that "probably the
majority are still to go out."
That may cause problems for
his office and for students
and parents waiting to get
their financial aid offers.
"I'm anxious for students
to get their financial aid .of
fers," he said. "It (the delay)
may cause some problems for
students."
Members of SAC said they
see the University's decision
as a partial victory.
"This is the first part of
what we wanted," SAC
member Matt Nicodemus
said. "We want them to in
clude the information, so part

of what we wanted has hap
pened."
Nicodemus delivered a
memo outlining his organiza
tion's concerns to Huff Mon
day, but said Monday night
that Huff had turned down
his request that the Univ r
sity provide the additional in
formation in the mailings.
SAC members also gave
Huff a sample of the type of
letter explaining fhe Universi
ty's policy that they would
like to see included in the of
fers.
Nicodemus said that SAC
members also would like fi
nancial aids officers here to
have telephone numbers av
ailable for draft counseling
and other students who have
not registered for non
registrants that may call for
information.
