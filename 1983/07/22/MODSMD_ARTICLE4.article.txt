# Casino Night scam
## Judge gives Economon 15 days 
### ERIC CORNELL 
Stanford senior Aristotle Economon was sen
tenced Tuesday to 15 days in jail for making and
selling counterfeit tickets to Senior Casino Night.
However, Santa Clara Municipal Court Justice
Edward Scoyen allowed Economon two days off
for time already served. In addition, Scoyen al
lowed the jail term to run concurrently with an
identical sentence Economon has already received
for illegally obtaining $1000 worth of telephone
equipment.
Economon originally pleaded not guilty to
felony charges of forgery and conspiracy to com
mit forgery. In a later plea-bargaining session,
however, he agreed to plead guilty to one count of
misdemeanor forgery. In exchange, the more
serious felony charge was dropped, according to
)ohn Virga, Economon's attorney.
The phony ticket incident was discovered on
Eeb.4 when 20 students appeared at the Senior
Casino Night with counterfeit tickets. The stu
dents had paid $10 each for the passes to attend
the sold-out fund-raising event.
The students reported they had bought the tic
kets from a man who told them he had originally
planned to go to Casino Night but had changed his
plans.
A police investigation culminated in the arrest in
April of Economon and one of his friends, Jorgen

Kuick, a student at California State University at
Sacramento. Economan was arrested while he was
taking the Graduate Management Aptitude Test in
Kuick's name.
Kuick was also convicted of misdemeanor
forgery and ordered to provide restitution to the
victims.
At the courthouse Tuesday Economan said that
he had "no comment at this time."
The Office of the Dean of Student Affairs also
looked into the incident, but Dean of Students
Sarah Cole would not divulge the results of any
proceedings.
The Casino Night incident was not the biology
major's first run-in with police. Last summer he
was arrested for illegally obtaining about $1000 in
new telephone equ ; pment from Pacific Tele
phone.
He was convicted of two counts of felony grand
theft and sentenced to 15 days in jail for that inci
dent, a term he will serve concurrently with the
Casino Night sentence when he reports to jail Aug.
1. After he has served this term, the charges will be
reduced for the record to misdemeanors, accord
ing to Court Clerk Christy Rhodes.
In addition, in January Economan pleaded guilty
to charges of mail fraud against the Sacramento
Bee for altering the dates on entries in the news
paper's football prediction contest.
