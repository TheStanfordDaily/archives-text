Both M.tterrand and Kohl remain strongly
committed to supporting the deployment of
American missiles in Europe if those negotia
tions 'ail. For verv dinerent reasons, however,
ooth eaders seem to have a common political
nterest in promoting a compromise at Geneva.
The Bonn government faces d revival of de
monstrations against the planned deployment
ot 108 Pershing II and 96 cruise missiles in West
German\ beginning at the end of this year. The
opposition Social Democratic Party and the
trade unions have decided that they may par
•icipate m some of the protests against the mis-
Hlesandthereisalwavsa possibility of violence
erupting in the streets.
Mitterrand's motivations are rather more
complex. The peace movement is negligible in
France, which boasts its own independent nuc
lear deterrent. No U.S. missiles are scheduled
to be deployed on French territory so there is
no need to worry about demonstrations. The
problem is economic rather than political.
Predictions of a "hot autumn" in France fol
lowing the summer vacations are based on the
fact that, for the first time in many years, the
purchasing power of ordinary Frenchmen is fal
ling. At a time when the rest of Europe and
North America are coming out of economic
recession, the French government is attempt
ing to impose a package of long-delayed auster
ity measures that will lead to higher un
employment and lower economic growth.
To reduce social tensions to a minimum dur
ing this potentially difficult period, Mitterrand
needs economic help from West Germany. He
also needs the continued good will of the
Communist Party, the junior partner in his
Socialist-led coalition, which holds the key to
industrial peace through its control over the
country's largest trade union.
