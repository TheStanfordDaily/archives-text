Washington — The nation's

this spring, with business activ

more than two years, govern

timate today for growth in the
April-June quarter. And
economists said the figure could
be triple that of the first quarter,
when revival from the recession
was just getting under way.
"Obviously, it was a very
strong quarter," David Wyss of
Data Resources Inc. said in ad
vance of today's report.
"We're having quite a recov
ery," Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan said earlier in the week.

sued an unofficial estimate, put
ting activity as measured by the
gross national product at 6.6
percent higher than the first
quarter.
That was the highest since the
pre-recession first quarter of
1981, and Regan said Tuesday
that today's figure "will be
higher" still.
Economists said the growth fi
gure could be a full percentage
point higher. Their projections
ranged from 7 percent to 8 per
cent.
"It's going to be a strong
number—the economy has de
finitely been booming," said
David Ernst of Evans Economics.
Today's report on real, or
inflation-adjusted, CNP covers

the entire economy. attempting
to measure the nation's total
second-quarter output of goods
and services and comparing it to
the first quarter.
Other, narrower reports ha\e
also been encouraging in recent
weeks, showing improvements
throughout the econorm in
June.
Commerce announced Wed
nesday that personal income
grew 0.5 percent last month as
personal consumption spending
rose 1 percent.
It said last week that industrial
production in June increased 1.1
percent, its seventh straight
monthly pickup.
The Federal Reserve Board
said Monday that industry oper
ated at 74.5 percent of capaciu
in June, the highest level since
February 1982.
And the Fed said consumers
took on 52.7 billion more in in
stallment credits during June
than thev paid off. It was the
largest amount since September
1981, and economists said it was
a sign of consumers' growing
confidence in the economy.
Economists generally say
growth will slow later in the year
as the recovery matures. The
Reagan administration is pre
dicting that real GNP growth for
the year will be 5.5 percent.
