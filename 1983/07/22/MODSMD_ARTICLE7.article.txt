# Poland formally lifts martial law, approves amnesty
## 
### 
Warsaw, Polandâ€”Polish au
thorities formally lifted martial
law at midnight yesterday, dis
solving the Military Council of
National Salvation and offering
amnesty to several hundred
political prisoners.
The move came shortly after
Parliament prolonged extraor
dinary legal restrictions on citi
zens' freedom for a 2'/2-year
transition period leading to "full
normalization."
Timed to coincide with today's
Polish national day, the action
closed an unprecedented chap
ter in Soviet Bloc history and
marked the beginning of a new
and uncertain phase of a social
and political drama that has ri

veted world attention on Poland
for much of the past three years.
On Wednesday, the 450-
member Parliament granted
broad powers to Poland's lead
ers and continued work on
"special regulations" that would
extend many martial law restric
tions for 18 months.
The new powers, contained in
a constitutional amendment,
were proposed by the Com
munist leadership and were de
signed to allow the government
to impose a state of emergency,
swiftly re-imprison dissidents
and keep key leaders of the out
lawed independent union Sol
idarity interned.

When martial law was de
clared Dec. 13, 1981, Parliament
endorsed it after the fact.
Informed sources said Parlia
ment would convene next week
to discuss permanent legal
changes that would toughen
penalties for "anti-state" crime
and make participation in a ban
ned organization such as Sol
idarity punishable by three years
in prison.
The amnesty measure covers
all women, all people under 21
and anyone sentenced to three
years or less. Those with longer
sentences would have their

terms cut at least in half and pos
sibly revoked.
However, government offi
cials have said that the amnesty
will not apply to seven fugitive
Solidarity leaders.
Deputy Minister of justice
Tadeusz Skora, speaking at a
three-hour news conference
Wednesday night, said the am
nesty would apply to a total of
796 people imprisoned since
martial law or under "temporary
arrest" pending trial.
He said he could not say
exactly how many people would

be released because some had
been sentenced to terms longer
than three years.
"The authorities never iully
used their possibilities resulting
from the martial law decree,"
Skora said, underscoring what
the government views as its le
niency.
The amnesty also would allow
the case against the pardoned
person to be reopened if the
"crime" is repeated before Dec
31, 1985.
