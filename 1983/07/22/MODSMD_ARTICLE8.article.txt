Managua, Nicaragua—The Sandinista gov
ernment's agreement to conduct negotiations
with other Central American nations offers the
chance of a breakthrough in stalled efforts to
avert a general war.
But the six-point plan for immediate negotia
tions announced Tuesday by the leftist gov
ernment's leaders shows that a wide gap per
sists between its views and those of the Reagan
administration.
The peace plan contains many of the points
Managua previously mentioned in its calls for
negotiations with the United States alone—
such as the removal of all foreign military advis
ers and a halt to arms shipments.
Managua has been willing to discuss those
questions before, but still does not acknow
ledge U.S. claims that it serves as a conduit for
arms shipments to leftist insurgents in El Sal
vador.
That point is basic to President Reagan's
stance toward Nicaragua and the administra
tion's rejection of formal talks with the San
dinista government.
Speaking before a crowd of about 100,000
people celebrating the fourth anniversary of
the Sandinista Revolution in the colonial city of

Leon, junta coordinator Daniel Ortega avoided
the scathing rhetoric that has marked de
teriorating relations between the United States
and Nicaragua since the revolution.
Ortega said the ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front continues to believe that
one-on-one talks are more suitable to defuse
the major tensions in the area. But for the first
time, he said Nicaragua will participate in mul
tilateral talks with other Central American
countries.
Such talks, urged by the four-nation Contad
ora group, have produced no concrete results
in the past.
The Comadora group takes its name for the
Panamanian island where the foreign ministers
of Panama, Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela
first met in january. A presidential summit was
held last weekend because of fear of war bet
ween Nicaragua and Honduras.
Ortega said the Sandinista front "considers it
an unavoidable moral obligation on the part of
all the governments of Central America and of
the political leaders of the United States to keep
our peoples away from the tragedy of a
generalized war."
