# No decision yet on final fate of burglar's loot
## 
### KRISHNA WEST 
Claims made by the "jog
ging burglar" and his
girlfriend on the loot reco
vered following his arrest
have prompted a superior
court judge to delay a deci
sion as to the fate of the
goods in order to permit the
two to identify property they
claim is rightfully theirs.
San jose Superior Court
Judge Robert Foley ruled yes
terday that the case brought
by Nancy Burt and Robert
O'Connor will be held over
until Monday, during which
time Burt and O'Connor will
have an opportunity to in
spect all the goods in ques
tion.
O'Connor pleaded guilty
to 21 counts of burglary in the
area after his arrest in
November 1982 by Stanford
police at Burt's Montara
home.
Police obtained search
warrants after seeing a stolen
Stanford vehicle parked out
side O'Connor's La Honda
residence. They found stolen
Roods worth $1.5 million
there, at Burt's home and in
several storage lockers.
Having "exhausted all
means to locate the burglary
victims," police planned to
auction off the remainder of
the confiscated property on
July 8 and 9. But Burt and

O'Connor claimed that the
leftover property belongs to
them.
Foley ordered the auction
to be postponed because
"they (Burt and O'Connor)
have a right to be heard. From
what I understand, some of
the confiscated property may
legally and legitimately be
theirs."
Sgt. Nick Brunot, the de
tective in charge of the case,
and Stanford Police Captain
Raoul Niemeyer admit that
they may have confiscated
some property that was not
stolen.
"There was no way of de
termining what was and was
not stolen," Niemeyer said.
"The first time we went there
(Burt's house), we left some
stuff behind that we didn't
realize was stolen. So we had
to go back a second time with
another search warrant to
clear the whole house."
"The police took a house
load of property . . . they
took everything in her
house," said Rich Rogia,
Burt's attornov "Th«r«
a group of personal property
that nobody has identified as
stolen. We're only asking for
what is rightfully Nancy's."
Stanford police will take
special custody of O'Connor
when he visits the trailer to
morrow.
