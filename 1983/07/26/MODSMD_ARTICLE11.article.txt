## Dying rural Chinatown intrigues summer visitors 
### GLEN ALLERHAND 
Cruising north on Sacramento
County Road El 3, you can pass
through Locke and never know
it. Chances are you'll miss the
Chinese characters on the
boathouse, the sagging clap
board buildings, and the faded
store fronts. You'll also miss Al's
Place, a former speakeasy where
ranchers and state legislators
guzzle beer, gnaw on steaks,
and shoot craps at the bar.
Locke straddles a triangle of
fertile low-lying land in the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
Pear orchards bloom to the
north; a slough stagnates to the
east; and the Sacramento River,
mocha-brown and sluggish,
gurgles to the west. In an earlier
time, coolies from the Pearl
River delta in southern China
harvested pears, asparagus and
tomatoes here from dawn till
dusk, and spent their free time
playing pai gow, a domino-like
game. A handful of those men,
now wizened, sit silently on
weathered wooden benches,
waiting to die. With them will
pass America's last rural
Chinatown.
In 1912, Tin San Chan, a labor
contractor, founded the town
on land owned by three

brothers, George, Clay and
Lloyd Locke. Three years later,
the Chinatown in nearby Walnut
Grove burned to the ground,
and the residents moved a
half-mile upriver to Locke. De
scendants of Chinese who had
flocked to California during the
Gold Rush, they built the only
type of community they
knew—a mining town with two
story wood-frame buildings and

hitching posts. The new settlers,
forbidden by state law to own
land, rented the buildings from
George Locke, a rancher.
Locke was transformed into a
pleasure palace. Flouting Pro
hibition, bootleggers opened
speakeasies that catered to the
Chinese, Filipino, and Mexican
field hands who sweated in the
sun-drenched orchards.
Brothels offered erotic diver

sions. Gambling halls, sounding
with the clatter of mah jongg
tiles, rounded out the enter
tainment.
As Locke flourished, the per
manent population grew to 400,
with the field workers swelling
the number to no more than 1000
during harvest season. At one
point, the town had a theater,
school, church, post office,
poolroom, fish market, bakery,

lodge, five hotels and rooming
houses, six restaurants and nine
grocery stores. Paddlewheel
steamers docked near a 1000-
foot-long vegetable packing
shed along the river to load up
with produce for cities in the
East.
Today, the brothels and bet
ting halls are gone. Al's stands
on Main Street as the lone

monument to the days of illegal
booze. A Chinese curio shop,
restaurant, market and museum
are the only other businesses.
Of the fewer than 40 Chinese
who remain in Locke, most are
more than 65. A halt-dozen sons
have stayed to manage family
businesses, but nearly all the
younger Chinese have left for
the universities and found pro
fessional positions in Sac
ramento or San Francisco. As the
older Chinese have died, white
artists and craftsmen in their 20s
and 30s have moved in. Cur
rently, they number about 15.
Although the two groups
rarely socialize, the Chinese
have accepted the influx of
whites. "I have no problems
with them,'' says Ping Lee,
whose father helped build the
town. He says relations between
the Chinese and whites are
"friendly."
"I love the Chinese," says

Russell Ooms, a cabinetmaker
who moved to Locke nearly 10
years ago. "They always com
plete the circle," he adds, de
scribing their fastidious atten
tion to recycling scraps of food,
metal and other material. As a
result, Ooms says,"I tread
lightly on the earth."
The earth, however, nearly
gave way to bulldozers and
steam shovels. In 1977, a Hong
Kong developer, Ng Tortai,
bought the entire Locke estate,
hoping to transform the 100
acres of orchards north of town
into a subdivision that included
fountains, pavilions, apart
ments, and a seven-story
hotel—a Chinese "Disneyland."
The county's environmental
protection office, however, said
the development would disturb
the town and marshland.
Though rejected, the project
remains a "very tender area"
with townspeople, according to
Laura Ulewicz, a Locke resident

and clerk-typist for the county.
Ng broke his promise to keep a
lid on the land rents charged to
residents, who own (he build
ings. A group of Chinese sued
Ng's firm, Asian City Develop

ment, Inc., and won a
reinstatement of lower rents.
Today, whites pay more than the
Chinese, but their rents still only
amount to $20 or $30 a month.
Ng's purchase, and sub

sequent refusal to sell, have
added to the thicket of public
and private interests that today
obscures Locke's future. As
early as 1975, rumors of an im
pending sale attracted the in
terest of the Sacramento Hous
ing and Redevelopment Agency
(SHRA). The new owner, it was
thought, would knock down the
clapboard buildings. SHRA
would then be obliged to relo
cate the town's residents, ac
cording to Leo Goto, director of
the agency's community de
velopment division. The rumors
of demolition proved un
founded, but by then the county
was involved.
With benevolent intentions,
SHRA drafted a "plan and action
program" in 1977 to preserve
Locke as an enclave of
Chinese-American history.
Some residents were irked that
the agency wasted money on a
study before taking action.
Others complained that SHRA


Ping Lee
failed to consult them. Despite
the objections, the plan went
into effect. The agency sprayed
the wooden buildings with fire
retardant, repaired foundations
and roofs, replaced the existing
butane tanks with an electrical
system, insulated attics, and,
most recently, installed a water
system.
For its part, the state tried, but
failed, to preserve the town as a
park. In 1980, the California
Legislature appropriated $1.2
million to the state's Parks and
Recreation Department to buy
the town and two buildings.
After two years of arduous
negotiations, Ng Tortai still re
fused to sell. Asian City, which
had paid about $650,000 for 400
acres in 1977, demanded
$800,000 for the 14-acre town.
On the basis of a property ap
praisal, the state offered less
than $500,000. The appropria
tion was returned to the de
partment's general fund in 1982
for disbursement elsewhere.
Prospects for future state fund
ing are dim, state and county of
ficials say. The brighest hope for
Locke may still lie with the Rede
velopment Agency, comments
Jack Chatfield, project manager
of the Parks Department's ac
quisitions division.

In the early days, Locke's de
velopment was untrammeled by
bureaucratic goodwill. After the
Walnut Grove fire, the Chinese
made a verbal agreement with
George Locke to build up the
fledgling town, which then con
sisted of a saloon, gambling hall
and boarding house.
One of the town patriarchs
was Bing Lee. "He had busines-

Locke's future is uncertain„ but one point is
clear: the town will never again be the bustl
ing Chinatown of the 1920s and '30s. 'We
never figured out how to bring back the
Chinese/ says Goto.'What do you do? Arti
fically try to stimulate them to come backV

ses from here to Oregon," brags
his son, Ping, former owner of
Big Store grocery in Walnut
Grove. Ping wears gold-framed
glasses, and his smudged white
smock covers a caramel and
red-flecked sweater vest. He
leans back in his swivel chair,
and spits words like bullets from
a machine gun as he talks about
his father.
In 1893, Bing Lee, 20, left
home in Kwangtung Province to
work in a Chinese exhibit at the
Chicago Exposition. After the
boat landed in San Francisco,
Lee caught a train to Chicago,

but remained only a few days be
fore returning to the West
Coast. He turned to field work
outside Walnut Grove, but grew
dissatisfied with farm labor La
ter, Lee landed a job as a dish
washer, then a chef, at a Walnut
Grove Hotel.
A born entrepreneur, he
saved and invested in a restaur-

ant. Ping Lee ventures that his
father received financial help
from Alex Brown, then the
"king" of Walnut Grove. Bing
Lee bought six businesses, in
cluding a gambling hall, but his
fortune went up in smoke in the
1915 fire. He led the vanguard
that moved to Locke, where his
son was born in 1917.
"My father built the town,"
boasts Ping Lee. The elder Lee
owned several buildings in
Locke, including the structure
that now houses Al's Place. In
the 19205, Al Adami, a bootleg
ger, rented the place and turned

it into a speakeasy. Residents
used to gamble in "Al the
Wop's" back room while dining
on steak, which is still the main
item on the menu.
When Adami died 14 years
ago, Ralph Santos, a
Portuguese-American, took over
the bar. "He's a good guy," Ping
Lee comments. "When Al ran it,
it was dirty."
Al's Place is where the locals
from surrounding towns come
to drink and get in trouble. In
variably, they do plenty of both.
Ooms sat in the bat on Saturday
afternoon and told how Al's
erupted in chaos. A short, feisty
farmer was pestering a fiery
tempered rancher. The rancher
paid no attention until the
farmer took a wild swing at him
and slugged his wife. In the
midst of the punching and yel
ling, Ooms says, one of the wait
resses started "dukin' the little
guy."
Today, broad-shouldered
farmers stand at the bar drink
ing, like cows at a trough. Above
the tarnished mirror behind the
bar and next to an electric clock
emblazoned with "Al the
Wop's" hang a yard-long
wooden fork and spoon. A stuf
fed ostrich perches above the
entrance to the women's rest
room. Ms. Pac Man and Donkev

Kong video games glow by the
wall. A colony of dollar bills
seems to grow on the ceiling.
Patrons stick tacks through the
greenbacks, wad Eisenhower
silver dollars into the bills, and
heave the packets skyward. The
bills rivet to the ceiling, open up
like flowers, and the coins jangle
to the floor.
In recent years, Delta farmers
have swarmed to Locke to
carouse at Al's. Yachters from
San Francisco travel upriver to
sample the steaks and Golden
Lager. State legislators, who
travel the 30 miles south from
Sacramento, can get drunk in
anonymity. And one day every
summer, the Hell's Angels rum
ble into town, causing the resi
dents to bar their doors. "We're
the other side of the river,"
Ooms says. "They come here to
let down and party, then go back
home." Locke's residents, he
says, keep their distance.
Some townspeople are hop
ping mad about the invasion,
jeanie Schmiedel, who manages
The Boathouse with her
husband, Frank, says yachters
who tie up at the dock party at
Al's until it closes at 2:00 a.m.
They return, beer in hand, and
fall down the stairs near the
wharf. Some urinate on the front
of the boathouse. Occasionally,
someone fires a pistol, spooking
the guard dogs. "Al's owner has
never done one thing for our
town," Schmiedel complains.
"He counts his money and goes
home."
One of the town's greatest
fears is fire. Several times, Locke
has faced premature extinction
when careless drunks have tos
sed lighted cigarettes onto the
wooden sidewalks. So far, alert
residents have extinguised the
flames in time. The Delta locals,
angry that the county funnels
federal tax dollars toward the
town's preservation, say "let it
burn," according to Ooms.
Locke's Chinese turn a blind
eye to the troubles. "They tend
to recede," observes Laura
Ulewicz. "There's more resent
ment than out-and-out con
flict."
"They especially don't like
people coming into Al the Wop's
and tearing up the place, but
they won't tell you that," says
Leo Goto of SHRA. The Chinese,
Goto adds, resent tourists
streamingthrough town, trampl
ing the gardens.
Lee Jang, 86, white-haired and
withered, hunches on a bench in
front of the Dai Loy Museum,
quietly watching the tourists
stroll by. The weathered

museum, which once housed
Bing Lee's gambling hall, faces
sunlit Main Street, a narrow
paved road no longer than a
football field. Down the street, a
young Delta couple strides into
Al's to load up on sirloin and
brew.
Jang came from Kwangtung
Province to work in the Delta or
chards more than 60 years ago.
In China, "times were bad and
there was no work," he explains
in Cantonese. Jang spent his
working life harvesting pears
and asparagus. He has never
married. He has never returned
home. He still corresponds with
his sister, 84, and brother, 74,
who stayed in China.
In the early days, Jang says,
the orchard foremen, who were
Chinese, hired only their coun
trymen. Nearly all the field
hands came from Chungshan
county near Canton. Now, Jang
says, only white field hands
pluck pears from the rows of
shiny-leafed trees.
He wears a stained white
fisherman's cap, sapphire rayon
sweater, and ivy trousers. His
hands, leathered from the sun,
are folded over his right knee. A
gray film covers his deepset
eyes.
Jang says the whites are good
to the Chinese. "There are
people who get drunk," he

acknowledges, "and they (Al's)
are open very late." He lives
above the church just behind
the tavern, but says he is not
bothered. Jang says there are
"very few fights."
Since he retired 20 years ago,
he's been living on Social Sec
urity. "I do nothing but chitchat
with my four friends," Jang
comments. "Now even if you
want to play mah jongg, there's
no one here to play."
When asked about the future
of the town, Jang responds, "I
don't think ahead. I have no
thoughts about the future. What
can I think about? I'm almost
ninety."

Locke's future is uncertain,
but one point is clear: the town
will never again be the bustling
Chinatown of the 1920s and '30s.
"We never figured out how to
bring back the Chinese," says
Goto. "What do you do? Artifi
cially try to stimulate them to
come back?"
Goto says his agency consi
dered bringing peasants from
China to work in the orchards
and repopulate the town, or
transforming Locke into an im
migration station for Chinese.
They would live in Locke for two
or three years to grow accus
tomed to the United States, then
move to other towns and cities.

Yet, Locke'selderly"justwanted
to be left alone," Goto adds. He
says SHRA decided to "let the
old Chinese die in peace."
Nonetheless, the agency con
tinues to poke and probe. A re
cently completed study pegged
the cost of rehabilitating Locke
at $3.7 million. The proposal
calls for drainage of low-lying
ground, added fire protection,
and structural refurbishing. But
because the county has already
spent about $1 million on the
town, Goto says, the state is re
luctant to appropriate more
money. He says Community De
velopment Block Grants, federal
funds distributed to SHRA, are
insufficient. "We just don't
know what to do," Goto admits.
Locke's residents carry on
Neighbors gather outside their
drooping wooden homes to
catch up on gossip. An elderly
husband and wife, cackling Can
tonese, eat dinner in their clut
tered kitchen, which looks onto
the county road.
On Main Street, Kee Jang and
his friends are perched on their
benches. The young Delta
couple, reeking of money and
Al's beer, strut by, arm in arm.
The wrinkled old men hardly
give them a glance.

in history acted as interpreter for

who stayed in China.
In the early days, Jang says,
the orchard foremen, who were
Chinese, hired only their coun
trymen. Nearly all the field
hands came from Chungshan
county near Canton. Now, Jang
says, only white field hands
pluck pears from the rows of
shiny-leafed trees.
He wears a stained white
fisherman's cap, sapphire rayon
sweater, and ivy trousers. His
hands, leathered from the sun,
are folded over his right knee. A
gray film covers his deepset
eyes.
Jang says the whites are good
to the Chinese. "There are
people who get drunk," he

acknowledges, "and they (Al's)
are open very late." He lives
above the church just behind
the tavern, but says he is not
bothered. Jang says there are
"very few fights."
Since he retired 20 years ago,
he's been living on Social Sec
urity. "I do nothing but chitchat
with my four friends," Jang
comments. "Now even if you
want to play mah jongg, there's
no one here to play."
When asked about the future
of the town, Jang responds, "I
don't think ahead. I have no
thoughts about the future. What
can I think about? I'm almost
ninety."

Locke's future is uncertain,
but one point is clear: the town
will never again be the bustling
Chinatown of the 1920s and '30s.
"We never figured out how to
bring back the Chinese," says
Goto. "What do you do? Artifi
cially try to stimulate them to
come back?"
Goto says his agency consi
dered bringing peasants from
China to work in the orchards
and repopulate the town, or
transforming Locke into an im
migration station for Chinese.
They would live in Locke for two
or three years to grow accus
tomed to the United States, then
move to other towns and cities.

Yet, Locke'selderly"justwanted
to be left alone," Goto adds. He
says SHRA decided to "let the
old Chinese die in peace."
Nonetheless, the agency con
tinues to poke and probe. A re
cently completed study pegged
the cost of rehabilitating Locke
at $3.7 million. The proposal
calls for drainage of low-lying
ground, added fire protection,
and structural refurbishing. But
because the county has already
spent about $1 million on the
town, Goto says, the state is re
luctant to appropriate more
money. He says Community De
velopment Block Grants, federal
funds distributed to SHRA, are
insufficient. "We just don't
know what to do," Goto admits.
Locke's residents carry on
Neighbors gather outside their
drooping wooden homes to
catch up on gossip. An elderly
husband and wife, cackling Can
tonese, eat dinner in their clut
tered kitchen, which looks onto
the county road.
On Main Street, Kee Jang and
his friends are perched on their
benches. The young Delta
couple, reeking of money and
Al's beer, strut by, arm in arm.
The wrinkled old men hardly
give them a glance.

Cruising north on Sacramento
County Road El 3, you can pass
through Locke and never know
it. Chances are you'll miss the
Chinese characters on the
boathouse, the sagging clap
board buildings, and the faded
store fronts. You'll also miss Al's
Place, a former speakeasy where
ranchers and state legislators
guzzle beer, gnaw on steaks,
and shoot craps at the bar.
Locke straddles a triangle of
fertile low-lying land in the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
Pear orchards bloom to the
north; a slough stagnates to the
east; and the Sacramento River,
mocha-brown and sluggish,
gurgles to the west. In an earlier
time, coolies from the Pearl
River delta in southern China
harvested pears, asparagus and
tomatoes here from dawn till
dusk, and spent their free time
playing pai gow, a domino-like
game. A handful of those men,
now wizened, sit silently on
weathered wooden benches,
waiting to die. With them will
pass America's last rural
Chinatown.
In 1912, Tin San Chan, a labor
contractor, founded the town
on land owned by three

brothers, George, Clay and
Lloyd Locke. Three years later,
the Chinatown in nearby Walnut
Grove burned to the ground,
and the residents moved a
half-mile upriver to Locke. De
scendants of Chinese who had
flocked to California during the
Gold Rush, they built the only
type of community they
knew—a mining town with two
story wood-frame buildings and

hitching posts. The new settlers,
forbidden by state law to own
land, rented the buildings from
George Locke, a rancher.
Locke was transformed into a
pleasure palace. Flouting Pro
hibition, bootleggers opened
speakeasies that catered to the
Chinese, Filipino, and Mexican
field hands who sweated in the
sun-drenched orchards.
Brothels offered erotic diver

sions. Gambling halls, sounding
with the clatter of mah jongg
tiles, rounded out the enter
tainment.
As Locke flourished, the per
manent population grew to 400,
with the field workers swelling
the number to no more than 1000
during harvest season. At one
point, the town had a theater,
school, church, post office,
poolroom, fish market, bakery,

lodge, five hotels and rooming
houses, six restaurants and nine
grocery stores. Paddlewheel
steamers docked near a 1000-
foot-long vegetable packing
shed along the river to load up
with produce for cities in the
East.
Today, the brothels and bet
ting halls are gone. Al's stands
on Main Street as the lone


Photos courtesy Glen Allerhand
monument to the days of illegal
booze. A Chinese curio shop,
restaurant, market and museum
are the only other businesses.
Of the fewer than 40 Chinese
who remain in Locke, most are
more than 65. A halt-dozen sons
have stayed to manage family
businesses, but nearly all the
younger Chinese have left for
the universities and found pro
fessional positions in Sac
ramento or San Francisco. As the
older Chinese have died, white
artists and craftsmen in their 20s
and 30s have moved in. Cur
rently, they number about 15.
Although the two groups
rarely socialize, the Chinese
have accepted the influx of
whites. "I have no problems
with them,'' says Ping Lee,
whose father helped build the
town. He says relations between
the Chinese and whites are
"friendly."
"I love the Chinese," says

Russell Ooms, a cabinetmaker
who moved to Locke nearly 10
years ago. "They always com
plete the circle," he adds, de
scribing their fastidious atten
tion to recycling scraps of food,
metal and other material. As a
result, Ooms says,"I tread
lightly on the earth."
The earth, however, nearly
gave way to bulldozers and
steam shovels. In 1977, a Hong
Kong developer, Ng Tortai,
bought the entire Locke estate,
hoping to transform the 100
acres of orchards north of town
into a subdivision that included
fountains, pavilions, apart
ments, and a seven-story
hotel—a Chinese "Disneyland."
The county's environmental
protection office, however, said
the development would disturb
the town and marshland.
Though rejected, the project
remains a "very tender area"
with townspeople, according to
Laura Ulewicz, a Locke resident

and clerk-typist for the county.
Ng broke his promise to keep a
lid on the land rents charged to
residents, who own (he build
ings. A group of Chinese sued
Ng's firm, Asian City Develop

ment, Inc., and won a
reinstatement of lower rents.
Today, whites pay more than the
Chinese, but their rents still only
amount to $20 or $30 a month.
Ng's purchase, and sub

sequent refusal to sell, have
added to the thicket of public
and private interests that today
obscures Locke's future. As
early as 1975, rumors of an im
pending sale attracted the in
terest of the Sacramento Hous
ing and Redevelopment Agency
(SHRA). The new owner, it was
thought, would knock down the
clapboard buildings. SHRA
would then be obliged to relo
cate the town's residents, ac
cording to Leo Goto, director of
the agency's community de
velopment division. The rumors
of demolition proved un
founded, but by then the county
was involved.
With benevolent intentions,
SHRA drafted a "plan and action
program" in 1977 to preserve
Locke as an enclave of
Chinese-American history.
Some residents were irked that
the agency wasted money on a
study before taking action.
Others complained that SHRA


Ping Lee
failed to consult them. Despite
the objections, the plan went
into effect. The agency sprayed
the wooden buildings with fire
retardant, repaired foundations
and roofs, replaced the existing
butane tanks with an electrical
system, insulated attics, and,
most recently, installed a water
system.
For its part, the state tried, but
failed, to preserve the town as a
park. In 1980, the California
Legislature appropriated $1.2
million to the state's Parks and
Recreation Department to buy
the town and two buildings.
After two years of arduous
negotiations, Ng Tortai still re
fused to sell. Asian City, which
had paid about $650,000 for 400
acres in 1977, demanded
$800,000 for the 14-acre town.
On the basis of a property ap
praisal, the state offered less
than $500,000. The appropria
tion was returned to the de
partment's general fund in 1982
for disbursement elsewhere.
Prospects for future state fund
ing are dim, state and county of
ficials say. The brighest hope for
Locke may still lie with the Rede
velopment Agency, comments
Jack Chatfield, project manager
of the Parks Department's ac
quisitions division.

In the early days, Locke's de
velopment was untrammeled by
bureaucratic goodwill. After the
Walnut Grove fire, the Chinese
made a verbal agreement with
George Locke to build up the
fledgling town, which then con
sisted of a saloon, gambling hall
and boarding house.
One of the town patriarchs
was Bing Lee. "He had busines-

Locke's future is uncertain„ but one point is
clear: the town will never again be the bustl
ing Chinatown of the 1920s and '30s. 'We
never figured out how to bring back the
Chinese/ says Goto.'What do you do? Arti
fically try to stimulate them to come backV

ses from here to Oregon," brags
his son, Ping, former owner of
Big Store grocery in Walnut
Grove. Ping wears gold-framed
glasses, and his smudged white
smock covers a caramel and
red-flecked sweater vest. He
leans back in his swivel chair,
and spits words like bullets from
a machine gun as he talks about
his father.
In 1893, Bing Lee, 20, left
home in Kwangtung Province to
work in a Chinese exhibit at the
Chicago Exposition. After the
boat landed in San Francisco,
Lee caught a train to Chicago,

but remained only a few days be
fore returning to the West
Coast. He turned to field work
outside Walnut Grove, but grew
dissatisfied with farm labor La
ter, Lee landed a job as a dish
washer, then a chef, at a Walnut
Grove Hotel.
A born entrepreneur, he
saved and invested in a restaur-

ant. Ping Lee ventures that his
father received financial help
from Alex Brown, then the
"king" of Walnut Grove. Bing
Lee bought six businesses, in
cluding a gambling hall, but his
fortune went up in smoke in the
1915 fire. He led the vanguard
that moved to Locke, where his
son was born in 1917.
"My father built the town,"
boasts Ping Lee. The elder Lee
owned several buildings in
Locke, including the structure
that now houses Al's Place. In
the 19205, Al Adami, a bootleg
ger, rented the place and turned

it into a speakeasy. Residents
used to gamble in "Al the
Wop's" back room while dining
on steak, which is still the main
item on the menu.
When Adami died 14 years
ago, Ralph Santos, a
Portuguese-American, took over
the bar. "He's a good guy," Ping
Lee comments. "When Al ran it,
it was dirty."
Al's Place is where the locals
from surrounding towns come
to drink and get in trouble. In
variably, they do plenty of both.
Ooms sat in the bat on Saturday
afternoon and told how Al's
erupted in chaos. A short, feisty
farmer was pestering a fiery
tempered rancher. The rancher
paid no attention until the
farmer took a wild swing at him
and slugged his wife. In the
midst of the punching and yel
ling, Ooms says, one of the wait
resses started "dukin' the little
guy."
Today, broad-shouldered
farmers stand at the bar drink
ing, like cows at a trough. Above
the tarnished mirror behind the
bar and next to an electric clock
emblazoned with "Al the
Wop's" hang a yard-long
wooden fork and spoon. A stuf
fed ostrich perches above the
entrance to the women's rest
room. Ms. Pac Man and Donkev

Kong video games glow by the
wall. A colony of dollar bills
seems to grow on the ceiling.
Patrons stick tacks through the
greenbacks, wad Eisenhower
silver dollars into the bills, and
heave the packets skyward. The
bills rivet to the ceiling, open up
like flowers, and the coins jangle
to the floor.
In recent years, Delta farmers
have swarmed to Locke to
carouse at Al's. Yachters from
San Francisco travel upriver to
sample the steaks and Golden
Lager. State legislators, who
travel the 30 miles south from
Sacramento, can get drunk in
anonymity. And one day every
summer, the Hell's Angels rum
ble into town, causing the resi
dents to bar their doors. "We're
the other side of the river,"
Ooms says. "They come here to
let down and party, then go back
home." Locke's residents, he
says, keep their distance.
Some townspeople are hop
ping mad about the invasion,
jeanie Schmiedel, who manages
The Boathouse with her
husband, Frank, says yachters
who tie up at the dock party at
Al's until it closes at 2:00 a.m.
They return, beer in hand, and
fall down the stairs near the
wharf. Some urinate on the front
of the boathouse. Occasionally,
someone fires a pistol, spooking
the guard dogs. "Al's owner has
never done one thing for our
town," Schmiedel complains.
"He counts his money and goes
home."
One of the town's greatest
fears is fire. Several times, Locke
has faced premature extinction
when careless drunks have tos
sed lighted cigarettes onto the
wooden sidewalks. So far, alert
residents have extinguised the
flames in time. The Delta locals,
angry that the county funnels
federal tax dollars toward the
town's preservation, say "let it
burn," according to Ooms.
Locke's Chinese turn a blind
eye to the troubles. "They tend
to recede," observes Laura
Ulewicz. "There's more resent
ment than out-and-out con
flict."
"They especially don't like
people coming into Al the Wop's
and tearing up the place, but
they won't tell you that," says
Leo Goto of SHRA. The Chinese,
Goto adds, resent tourists
streamingthrough town, trampl
ing the gardens.
Lee Jang, 86, white-haired and
withered, hunches on a bench in
front of the Dai Loy Museum,
quietly watching the tourists
stroll by. The weathered

museum, which once housed
Bing Lee's gambling hall, faces
sunlit Main Street, a narrow
paved road no longer than a
football field. Down the street, a
young Delta couple strides into
Al's to load up on sirloin and
brew.
Jang came from Kwangtung
Province to work in the Delta or
chards more than 60 years ago.
In China, "times were bad and
there was no work," he explains
in Cantonese. Jang spent his
working life harvesting pears
and asparagus. He has never
married. He has never returned
home. He still corresponds with
his sister, 84, and brother, 74,
who stayed in China.
In the early days, Jang says,
the orchard foremen, who were
Chinese, hired only their coun
trymen. Nearly all the field
hands came from Chungshan
county near Canton. Now, Jang
says, only white field hands
pluck pears from the rows of
shiny-leafed trees.
He wears a stained white
fisherman's cap, sapphire rayon
sweater, and ivy trousers. His
hands, leathered from the sun,
are folded over his right knee. A
gray film covers his deepset
eyes.
Jang says the whites are good
to the Chinese. "There are
people who get drunk," he

acknowledges, "and they (Al's)
are open very late." He lives
above the church just behind
the tavern, but says he is not
bothered. Jang says there are
"very few fights."

he's been living on Social Sec
urity. "I do nothing but chitchat
with my four friends," Jang
comments. "Now even if you
want to play mah jongg, there's

of the town, Jang responds, "I

Kong video games glow by the
wall. A colony of dollar bills
seems to grow on the ceiling.
Patrons stick tacks through the
greenbacks, wad Eisenhower
silver dollars into the bills, and
heave the packets skyward. The
bills rivet to the ceiling, open up
like flowers, and the coins jangle
to the floor.
In recent years, Delta farmers
have swarmed to Locke to
carouse at Al's. Yachters from
San Francisco travel upriver to
sample the steaks and Golden
Lager. State legislators, who
travel the 30 miles south from
Sacramento, can get drunk in
anonymity. And one day every
summer, the Hell's Angels rum
ble into town, causing the resi
dents to bar their doors. "We're
the other side of the river,"
Ooms says. "They come here to
let down and party, then go back
home." Locke's residents, he
says, keep their distance.
Some townspeople are hop
ping mad about the invasion,
jeanie Schmiedel, who manages
The Boathouse with her
husband, Frank, says yachters
who tie up at the dock party at
Al's until it closes at 2:00 a.m.
They return, beer in hand, and
fall down the stairs near the
wharf. Some urinate on the front
of the boathouse. Occasionally,
someone fires a pistol, spooking
the guard dogs. "Al's owner has
never done one thing for our
town," Schmiedel complains.
"He counts his money and goes
home."
One of the town's greatest
fears is fire. Several times, Locke
has faced premature extinction
when careless drunks have tos
sed lighted cigarettes onto the
wooden sidewalks. So far, alert
residents have extinguised the
flames in time. The Delta locals,
angry that the county funnels
federal tax dollars toward the
town's preservation, say "let it
burn," according to Ooms.
Locke's Chinese turn a blind
eye to the troubles. "They tend
to recede," observes Laura
Ulewicz. "There's more resent
ment than out-and-out con
flict."
"They especially don't like
people coming into Al the Wop's
and tearing up the place, but
they won't tell you that," says
Leo Goto of SHRA. The Chinese,
Goto adds, resent tourists
streamingthrough town, trampl
ing the gardens.
Lee Jang, 86, white-haired and
withered, hunches on a bench in
front of the Dai Loy Museum,
quietly watching the tourists
stroll by. The weathered

museum, which once housed
Bing Lee's gambling hall, faces
sunlit Main Street, a narrow
paved road no longer than a
football field. Down the street, a
young Delta couple strides into
Al's to load up on sirloin and
brew.
Jang came from Kwangtung
Province to work in the Delta or
chards more than 60 years ago.
In China, "times were bad and
there was no work," he explains
in Cantonese. Jang spent his
working life harvesting pears
and asparagus. He has never
married. He has never returned
home. He still corresponds with
his sister, 84, and brother, 74,
who stayed in China.
In the early days, Jang says,
the orchard foremen, who were
Chinese, hired only their coun
trymen. Nearly all the field
hands came from Chungshan
county near Canton. Now, Jang
says, only white field hands
pluck pears from the rows of
shiny-leafed trees.
He wears a stained white
fisherman's cap, sapphire rayon
sweater, and ivy trousers. His
hands, leathered from the sun,
are folded over his right knee. A
gray film covers his deepset
eyes.
Jang says the whites are good
to the Chinese. "There are
people who get drunk," he

acknowledges, "and they (Al's)
are open very late." He lives
above the church just behind
the tavern, but says he is not
bothered. Jang says there are
"very few fights."
Since he retired 20 years ago,
he's been living on Social Sec
urity. "I do nothing but chitchat
with my four friends," Jang
comments. "Now even if you
want to play mah jongg, there's
no one here to play."
When asked about the future
of the town, Jang responds, "I
don't think ahead. I have no
thoughts about the future. What
can I think about? I'm almost
ninety."

Locke's future is uncertain,
but one point is clear: the town
will never again be the bustling
Chinatown of the 1920s and '30s.
"We never figured out how to
bring back the Chinese," says
Goto. "What do you do? Artifi
cially try to stimulate them to
come back?"
Goto says his agency consi
dered bringing peasants from
China to work in the orchards
and repopulate the town, or
transforming Locke into an im
migration station for Chinese.
They would live in Locke for two
or three years to grow accus
tomed to the United States, then
move to other towns and cities.

Yet, Locke'selderly"justwanted
to be left alone," Goto adds. He
says SHRA decided to "let the
old Chinese die in peace."
Nonetheless, the agency con
tinues to poke and probe. A re
cently completed study pegged
the cost of rehabilitating Locke
at $3.7 million. The proposal
calls for drainage of low-lying
ground, added fire protection,
and structural refurbishing. But
because the county has already
spent about $1 million on the
town, Goto says, the state is re
luctant to appropriate more
money. He says Community De
velopment Block Grants, federal
funds distributed to SHRA, are
insufficient. "We just don't
know what to do," Goto admits.
Locke's residents carry on
Neighbors gather outside their
drooping wooden homes to
catch up on gossip. An elderly
husband and wife, cackling Can
tonese, eat dinner in their clut
tered kitchen, which looks onto
the county road.
On Main Street, Kee Jang and
his friends are perched on their
benches. The young Delta
couple, reeking of money and
Al's beer, strut by, arm in arm.
The wrinkled old men hardly
give them a glance.

Cruising north on Sacramento
County Road El 3, you can pass
through Locke and never know
it. Chances are you'll miss the
Chinese characters on the
boathouse, the sagging clap
board buildings, and the faded
store fronts. You'll also miss Al's
Place, a former speakeasy where
ranchers and state legislators
guzzle beer, gnaw on steaks,
and shoot craps at the bar.
Locke straddles a triangle of
fertile low-lying land in the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
Pear orchards bloom to the
north; a slough stagnates to the
east; and the Sacramento River,
mocha-brown and sluggish,
gurgles to the west. In an earlier
time, coolies from the Pearl
River delta in southern China
harvested pears, asparagus and
tomatoes here from dawn till
dusk, and spent their free time
playing pai gow, a domino-like
game. A handful of those men,
now wizened, sit silently on
weathered wooden benches,
waiting to die. With them will
pass America's last rural
Chinatown.
In 1912, Tin San Chan, a labor
contractor, founded the town
on land owned by three

brothers, George, Clay and
Lloyd Locke. Three years later,
the Chinatown in nearby Walnut
Grove burned to the ground,
and the residents moved a
half-mile upriver to Locke. De
scendants of Chinese who had
flocked to California during the
Gold Rush, they built the only
type of community they
knew—a mining town with two
story wood-frame buildings and

hitching posts. The new settlers,
forbidden by state law to own
land, rented the buildings from
George Locke, a rancher.
Locke was transformed into a
pleasure palace. Flouting Pro
hibition, bootleggers opened
speakeasies that catered to the
Chinese, Filipino, and Mexican
field hands who sweated in the
sun-drenched orchards.
Brothels offered erotic diver

sions. Gambling halls, sounding
with the clatter of mah jongg
tiles, rounded out the enter
tainment.
As Locke flourished, the per
manent population grew to 400,
with the field workers swelling
the number to no more than 1000
during harvest season. At one
point, the town had a theater,
school, church, post office,
poolroom, fish market, bakery,

lodge, five hotels and rooming
houses, six restaurants and nine
grocery stores. Paddlewheel
steamers docked near a 1000-
foot-long vegetable packing
shed along the river to load up
with produce for cities in the
East.
Today, the brothels and bet
ting halls are gone. Al's stands
on Main Street as the lone


Photos courtesy Glen Allerhand
monument to the days of illegal
booze. A Chinese curio shop,
restaurant, market and museum
are the only other businesses.
Of the fewer than 40 Chinese
who remain in Locke, most are
more than 65. A halt-dozen sons
have stayed to manage family
businesses, but nearly all the
younger Chinese have left for
the universities and found pro
fessional positions in Sac
ramento or San Francisco. As the
older Chinese have died, white
artists and craftsmen in their 20s
and 30s have moved in. Cur
rently, they number about 15.
Although the two groups
rarely socialize, the Chinese
have accepted the influx of
whites. "I have no problems
with them,'' says Ping Lee,
whose father helped build the
town. He says relations between
the Chinese and whites are
"friendly."
"I love the Chinese," says

Russell Ooms, a cabinetmaker
who moved to Locke nearly 10
years ago. "They always com
plete the circle," he adds, de
scribing their fastidious atten
tion to recycling scraps of food,
metal and other material. As a
result, Ooms says,"I tread
lightly on the earth."
The earth, however, nearly
gave way to bulldozers and
steam shovels. In 1977, a Hong
Kong developer, Ng Tortai,
bought the entire Locke estate,
hoping to transform the 100
acres of orchards north of town
into a subdivision that included
fountains, pavilions, apart
ments, and a seven-story
hotel—a Chinese "Disneyland."
The county's environmental
protection office, however, said
the development would disturb
the town and marshland.
Though rejected, the project
remains a "very tender area"
with townspeople, according to
Laura Ulewicz, a Locke resident

and clerk-typist for the county.
Ng broke his promise to keep a
lid on the land rents charged to
residents, who own (he build
ings. A group of Chinese sued
Ng's firm, Asian City Develop

ment, Inc., and won a
reinstatement of lower rents.
Today, whites pay more than the
Chinese, but their rents still only
amount to $20 or $30 a month.
Ng's purchase, and sub

sequent refusal to sell, have
added to the thicket of public
and private interests that today
obscures Locke's future. As
early as 1975, rumors of an im
pending sale attracted the in
terest of the Sacramento Hous
ing and Redevelopment Agency
(SHRA). The new owner, it was
thought, would knock down the
clapboard buildings. SHRA
would then be obliged to relo
cate the town's residents, ac
cording to Leo Goto, director of
the agency's community de
velopment division. The rumors
of demolition proved un
founded, but by then the county
was involved.
With benevolent intentions,
SHRA drafted a "plan and action
program" in 1977 to preserve
Locke as an enclave of
Chinese-American history.
Some residents were irked that
the agency wasted money on a
study before taking action.
Others complained that SHRA


Ping Lee
failed to consult them. Despite
the objections, the plan went
into effect. The agency sprayed
the wooden buildings with fire
retardant, repaired foundations
and roofs, replaced the existing
butane tanks with an electrical
system, insulated attics, and,
most recently, installed a water
system.
For its part, the state tried, but
failed, to preserve the town as a
park. In 1980, the California
Legislature appropriated $1.2
million to the state's Parks and
Recreation Department to buy
the town and two buildings.
After two years of arduous
negotiations, Ng Tortai still re
fused to sell. Asian City, which
had paid about $650,000 for 400
acres in 1977, demanded
$800,000 for the 14-acre town.
On the basis of a property ap
praisal, the state offered less
than $500,000. The appropria
tion was returned to the de
partment's general fund in 1982
for disbursement elsewhere.
Prospects for future state fund
ing are dim, state and county of
ficials say. The brighest hope for
Locke may still lie with the Rede
velopment Agency, comments
Jack Chatfield, project manager
of the Parks Department's ac
quisitions division.

In the early days, Locke's de
velopment was untrammeled by
bureaucratic goodwill. After the
Walnut Grove fire, the Chinese
made a verbal agreement with
George Locke to build up the
fledgling town, which then con
sisted of a saloon, gambling hall
and boarding house.
One of the town patriarchs
was Bing Lee. "He had busines-

Locke's future is uncertain„ but one point is
clear: the town will never again be the bustl
ing Chinatown of the 1920s and '30s. 'We
never figured out how to bring back the
Chinese/ says Goto.'What do you do? Arti
fically try to stimulate them to come backV

ses from here to Oregon," brags
his son, Ping, former owner of
Big Store grocery in Walnut
Grove. Ping wears gold-framed
glasses, and his smudged white
smock covers a caramel and
red-flecked sweater vest. He
leans back in his swivel chair,
and spits words like bullets from
a machine gun as he talks about
his father.
In 1893, Bing Lee, 20, left
home in Kwangtung Province to
work in a Chinese exhibit at the
Chicago Exposition. After the
boat landed in San Francisco,
Lee caught a train to Chicago,

but remained only a few days be
fore returning to the West
Coast. He turned to field work
outside Walnut Grove, but grew
dissatisfied with farm labor La
ter, Lee landed a job as a dish
washer, then a chef, at a Walnut
Grove Hotel.
A born entrepreneur, he
saved and invested in a restaur-

ant. Ping Lee ventures that his
father received financial help
from Alex Brown, then the
"king" of Walnut Grove. Bing
Lee bought six businesses, in
cluding a gambling hall, but his
fortune went up in smoke in the
1915 fire. He led the vanguard
that moved to Locke, where his
son was born in 1917.
"My father built the town,"
boasts Ping Lee. The elder Lee
owned several buildings in
Locke, including the structure
that now houses Al's Place. In
the 19205, Al Adami, a bootleg
ger, rented the place and turned

it into a speakeasy. Residents
used to gamble in "Al the
Wop's" back room while dining
on steak, which is still the main
item on the menu.
When Adami died 14 years
ago, Ralph Santos, a
Portuguese-American, took over
the bar. "He's a good guy," Ping
Lee comments. "When Al ran it,
it was dirty."
Al's Place is where the locals
from surrounding towns come
to drink and get in trouble. In
variably, they do plenty of both.
Ooms sat in the bat on Saturday
afternoon and told how Al's
erupted in chaos. A short, feisty
farmer was pestering a fiery
tempered rancher. The rancher
paid no attention until the
farmer took a wild swing at him
and slugged his wife. In the
midst of the punching and yel
ling, Ooms says, one of the wait
resses started "dukin' the little
guy."
Today, broad-shouldered
farmers stand at the bar drink
ing, like cows at a trough. Above
the tarnished mirror behind the
bar and next to an electric clock
emblazoned with "Al the
Wop's" hang a yard-long
wooden fork and spoon. A stuf
fed ostrich perches above the
entrance to the women's rest
room. Ms. Pac Man and Donkev

Kong video games glow by the
wall. A colony of dollar bills
seems to grow on the ceiling.
Patrons stick tacks through the
greenbacks, wad Eisenhower
silver dollars into the bills, and
heave the packets skyward. The
bills rivet to the ceiling, open up
like flowers, and the coins jangle
to the floor.

have swarmed to Locke to

was Bing Lee. "He had busines-

Locke's future is uncertain„ but one point is
clear: the town will never again be the bustl
ing Chinatown of the 1920s and '30s. 'We
never figured out how to bring back the
Chinese/ says Goto.'What do you do? Arti
fically try to stimulate them to come backV

ses from here to Oregon," brags
his son, Ping, former owner of
Big Store grocery in Walnut
Grove. Ping wears gold-framed
glasses, and his smudged white
smock covers a caramel and
red-flecked sweater vest. He
leans back in his swivel chair,
and spits words like bullets from
a machine gun as he talks about
his father.
In 1893, Bing Lee, 20, left
home in Kwangtung Province to
work in a Chinese exhibit at the
Chicago Exposition. After the
boat landed in San Francisco,
Lee caught a train to Chicago,

but remained only a few days be
fore returning to the West
Coast. He turned to field work
outside Walnut Grove, but grew
dissatisfied with farm labor La
ter, Lee landed a job as a dish
washer, then a chef, at a Walnut
Grove Hotel.
A born entrepreneur, he
saved and invested in a restaur-

ant. Ping Lee ventures that his
father received financial help
from Alex Brown, then the
"king" of Walnut Grove. Bing
Lee bought six businesses, in
cluding a gambling hall, but his
fortune went up in smoke in the
1915 fire. He led the vanguard
that moved to Locke, where his
son was born in 1917.
"My father built the town,"
boasts Ping Lee. The elder Lee
owned several buildings in
Locke, including the structure
that now houses Al's Place. In
the 19205, Al Adami, a bootleg
ger, rented the place and turned

it into a speakeasy. Residents
used to gamble in "Al the
Wop's" back room while dining
on steak, which is still the main
item on the menu.
When Adami died 14 years
ago, Ralph Santos, a
Portuguese-American, took over
the bar. "He's a good guy," Ping
Lee comments. "When Al ran it,
it was dirty."
Al's Place is where the locals
from surrounding towns come
to drink and get in trouble. In
variably, they do plenty of both.
Ooms sat in the bat on Saturday
afternoon and told how Al's
erupted in chaos. A short, feisty
farmer was pestering a fiery
tempered rancher. The rancher
paid no attention until the
farmer took a wild swing at him
and slugged his wife. In the
midst of the punching and yel
ling, Ooms says, one of the wait
resses started "dukin' the little
guy."
Today, broad-shouldered
farmers stand at the bar drink
ing, like cows at a trough. Above
the tarnished mirror behind the
bar and next to an electric clock
emblazoned with "Al the
Wop's" hang a yard-long
wooden fork and spoon. A stuf
fed ostrich perches above the
entrance to the women's rest
room. Ms. Pac Man and Donkev

Kong video games glow by the
wall. A colony of dollar bills
seems to grow on the ceiling.
Patrons stick tacks through the
greenbacks, wad Eisenhower
silver dollars into the bills, and
heave the packets skyward. The
bills rivet to the ceiling, open up
like flowers, and the coins jangle
to the floor.
In recent years, Delta farmers
have swarmed to Locke to
carouse at Al's. Yachters from
San Francisco travel upriver to
sample the steaks and Golden
Lager. State legislators, who
travel the 30 miles south from
Sacramento, can get drunk in
anonymity. And one day every
summer, the Hell's Angels rum
ble into town, causing the resi
dents to bar their doors. "We're
the other side of the river,"
Ooms says. "They come here to
let down and party, then go back
home." Locke's residents, he
says, keep their distance.
Some townspeople are hop
ping mad about the invasion,
jeanie Schmiedel, who manages
The Boathouse with her
husband, Frank, says yachters
who tie up at the dock party at
Al's until it closes at 2:00 a.m.
They return, beer in hand, and
fall down the stairs near the
wharf. Some urinate on the front
of the boathouse. Occasionally,
someone fires a pistol, spooking
the guard dogs. "Al's owner has
never done one thing for our
town," Schmiedel complains.
"He counts his money and goes
home."
One of the town's greatest
fears is fire. Several times, Locke
has faced premature extinction
when careless drunks have tos
sed lighted cigarettes onto the
wooden sidewalks. So far, alert
residents have extinguised the
flames in time. The Delta locals,
angry that the county funnels
federal tax dollars toward the
town's preservation, say "let it
burn," according to Ooms.
Locke's Chinese turn a blind
eye to the troubles. "They tend
to recede," observes Laura
Ulewicz. "There's more resent
ment than out-and-out con
flict."
"They especially don't like
people coming into Al the Wop's
and tearing up the place, but
they won't tell you that," says
Leo Goto of SHRA. The Chinese,
Goto adds, resent tourists
streamingthrough town, trampl
ing the gardens.
Lee Jang, 86, white-haired and
withered, hunches on a bench in
front of the Dai Loy Museum,
quietly watching the tourists
stroll by. The weathered

museum, which once housed
Bing Lee's gambling hall, faces
sunlit Main Street, a narrow
paved road no longer than a
football field. Down the street, a
young Delta couple strides into
Al's to load up on sirloin and
brew.
Jang came from Kwangtung
Province to work in the Delta or
chards more than 60 years ago.
In China, "times were bad and
there was no work," he explains
in Cantonese. Jang spent his
working life harvesting pears
and asparagus. He has never
married. He has never returned
home. He still corresponds with
his sister, 84, and brother, 74,
who stayed in China.
In the early days, Jang says,
the orchard foremen, who were
Chinese, hired only their coun
trymen. Nearly all the field
hands came from Chungshan
county near Canton. Now, Jang
says, only white field hands
pluck pears from the rows of
shiny-leafed trees.
He wears a stained white
fisherman's cap, sapphire rayon
sweater, and ivy trousers. His
hands, leathered from the sun,
are folded over his right knee. A
gray film covers his deepset
eyes.
Jang says the whites are good
to the Chinese. "There are
people who get drunk," he

acknowledges, "and they (Al's)
are open very late." He lives
above the church just behind
the tavern, but says he is not
bothered. Jang says there are
"very few fights."
Since he retired 20 years ago,
he's been living on Social Sec
urity. "I do nothing but chitchat
with my four friends," Jang
comments. "Now even if you
want to play mah jongg, there's
no one here to play."
When asked about the future
of the town, Jang responds, "I
don't think ahead. I have no
thoughts about the future. What
can I think about? I'm almost
ninety."

Locke's future is uncertain,
but one point is clear: the town
will never again be the bustling
Chinatown of the 1920s and '30s.
"We never figured out how to
bring back the Chinese," says
Goto. "What do you do? Artifi
cially try to stimulate them to
come back?"
Goto says his agency consi
dered bringing peasants from
China to work in the orchards
and repopulate the town, or
transforming Locke into an im
migration station for Chinese.
They would live in Locke for two
or three years to grow accus
tomed to the United States, then
move to other towns and cities.

Yet, Locke'selderly"justwanted
to be left alone," Goto adds. He
says SHRA decided to "let the
old Chinese die in peace."
Nonetheless, the agency con
tinues to poke and probe. A re
cently completed study pegged
the cost of rehabilitating Locke
at $3.7 million. The proposal
calls for drainage of low-lying
ground, added fire protection,
and structural refurbishing. But
because the county has already
spent about $1 million on the
town, Goto says, the state is re
luctant to appropriate more
money. He says Community De
velopment Block Grants, federal
funds distributed to SHRA, are
insufficient. "We just don't
know what to do," Goto admits.
Locke's residents carry on
Neighbors gather outside their
drooping wooden homes to
catch up on gossip. An elderly
husband and wife, cackling Can
tonese, eat dinner in their clut
tered kitchen, which looks onto
the county road.
On Main Street, Kee Jang and
his friends are perched on their
benches. The young Delta
couple, reeking of money and
Al's beer, strut by, arm in arm.
The wrinkled old men hardly
give them a glance.

Cruising north on Sacramento
County Road El 3, you can pass
through Locke and never know
it. Chances are you'll miss the
Chinese characters on the
boathouse, the sagging clap
board buildings, and the faded
store fronts. You'll also miss Al's
Place, a former speakeasy where
ranchers and state legislators
guzzle beer, gnaw on steaks,
and shoot craps at the bar.
Locke straddles a triangle of
fertile low-lying land in the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
Pear orchards bloom to the
north; a slough stagnates to the
east; and the Sacramento River,
mocha-brown and sluggish,
gurgles to the west. In an earlier
time, coolies from the Pearl
River delta in southern China
harvested pears, asparagus and
tomatoes here from dawn till
dusk, and spent their free time
playing pai gow, a domino-like
game. A handful of those men,
now wizened, sit silently on
weathered wooden benches,
waiting to die. With them will
pass America's last rural
Chinatown.
In 1912, Tin San Chan, a labor
contractor, founded the town
on land owned by three

brothers, George, Clay and
Lloyd Locke. Three years later,
the Chinatown in nearby Walnut
Grove burned to the ground,
and the residents moved a
half-mile upriver to Locke. De
scendants of Chinese who had
flocked to California during the
Gold Rush, they built the only
type of community they
knew—a mining town with two
story wood-frame buildings and

hitching posts. The new settlers,
forbidden by state law to own
land, rented the buildings from
George Locke, a rancher.
Locke was transformed into a
pleasure palace. Flouting Pro
hibition, bootleggers opened
speakeasies that catered to the
Chinese, Filipino, and Mexican
field hands who sweated in the
sun-drenched orchards.
Brothels offered erotic diver

sions. Gambling halls, sounding
with the clatter of mah jongg
tiles, rounded out the enter
tainment.
As Locke flourished, the per
manent population grew to 400,
with the field workers swelling
the number to no more than 1000
during harvest season. At one
point, the town had a theater,
school, church, post office,
poolroom, fish market, bakery,

lodge, five hotels and rooming
houses, six restaurants and nine
grocery stores. Paddlewheel
steamers docked near a 1000-
foot-long vegetable packing
shed along the river to load up
with produce for cities in the
East.
Today, the brothels and bet
ting halls are gone. Al's stands
on Main Street as the lone


Photos courtesy Glen Allerhand
monument to the days of illegal
booze. A Chinese curio shop,
restaurant, market and museum
are the only other businesses.
Of the fewer than 40 Chinese
who remain in Locke, most are
more than 65. A halt-dozen sons
have stayed to manage family
businesses, but nearly all the
younger Chinese have left for
the universities and found pro
fessional positions in Sac
ramento or San Francisco. As the
older Chinese have died, white
artists and craftsmen in their 20s
and 30s have moved in. Cur
rently, they number about 15.
Although the two groups
rarely socialize, the Chinese
have accepted the influx of
whites. "I have no problems
with them,'' says Ping Lee,
whose father helped build the
town. He says relations between
the Chinese and whites are
"friendly."
"I love the Chinese," says

Russell Ooms, a cabinetmaker
who moved to Locke nearly 10
years ago. "They always com
plete the circle," he adds, de
scribing their fastidious atten
tion to recycling scraps of food,
metal and other material. As a
result, Ooms says,"I tread
lightly on the earth."
The earth, however, nearly
gave way to bulldozers and
steam shovels. In 1977, a Hong
Kong developer, Ng Tortai,
bought the entire Locke estate,
hoping to transform the 100
acres of orchards north of town
into a subdivision that included
fountains, pavilions, apart
ments, and a seven-story
hotel—a Chinese "Disneyland."
The county's environmental
protection office, however, said
the development would disturb
the town and marshland.
Though rejected, the project
remains a "very tender area"
with townspeople, according to
Laura Ulewicz, a Locke resident

and clerk-typist for the county.
Ng broke his promise to keep a
lid on the land rents charged to
residents, who own (he build
ings. A group of Chinese sued
Ng's firm, Asian City Develop

ment, Inc., and won a
reinstatement of lower rents.
Today, whites pay more than the
Chinese, but their rents still only
amount to $20 or $30 a month.
Ng's purchase, and sub

sequent refusal to sell, have
added to the thicket of public
and private interests that today
obscures Locke's future. As
early as 1975, rumors of an im
pending sale attracted the in
terest of the Sacramento Hous
ing and Redevelopment Agency
(SHRA). The new owner, it was
thought, would knock down the
clapboard buildings. SHRA
would then be obliged to relo
cate the town's residents, ac
cording to Leo Goto, director of
the agency's community de
velopment division. The rumors
of demolition proved un
founded, but by then the county
was involved.
With benevolent intentions,
SHRA drafted a "plan and action
program" in 1977 to preserve
Locke as an enclave of
Chinese-American history.
Some residents were irked that
the agency wasted money on a
study before taking action.
Others complained that SHRA


Ping Lee
failed to consult them. Despite
the objections, the plan went
into effect. The agency sprayed
the wooden buildings with fire
retardant, repaired foundations
and roofs, replaced the existing
butane tanks with an electrical
system, insulated attics, and,
most recently, installed a water
system.
For its part, the state tried, but
failed, to preserve the town as a
park. In 1980, the California
Legislature appropriated $1.2
million to the state's Parks and
Recreation Department to buy
the town and two buildings.
After two years of arduous
negotiations, Ng Tortai still re
fused to sell. Asian City, which
had paid about $650,000 for 400
acres in 1977, demanded
$800,000 for the 14-acre town.
On the basis of a property ap
praisal, the state offered less
than $500,000. The appropria
tion was returned to the de
partment's general fund in 1982
for disbursement elsewhere.
Prospects for future state fund
ing are dim, state and county of
ficials say. The brighest hope for
Locke may still lie with the Rede
velopment Agency, comments
Jack Chatfield, project manager
of the Parks Department's ac
quisitions division.

In the early days, Locke's de
velopment was untrammeled by
bureaucratic goodwill. After the
Walnut Grove fire, the Chinese
made a verbal agreement with
George Locke to build up the
fledgling town, which then con
sisted of a saloon, gambling hall
and boarding house.
One of the town patriarchs
was Bing Lee. "He had busines-
