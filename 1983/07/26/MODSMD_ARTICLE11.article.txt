## Dying rural Chinatown intrigues summer visitors 
### GLEN ALLERHAND 
Cruising north on Sacramento
County Road El 3, you can pass
through Locke and never know
it. Chances are you'll miss the
Chinese characters on the
boathouse, the sagging clap
board buildings, and the faded
store fronts. You'll also miss Al's
Place, a former speakeasy where
ranchers and state legislators
guzzle beer, gnaw on steaks,
and shoot craps at the bar.
Locke straddles a triangle of
fertile low-lying land in the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.
Pear orchards bloom to the
north; a slough stagnates to the
east; and the Sacramento River,
mocha-brown and sluggish,
gurgles to the west. In an earlier
time, coolies from the Pearl
River delta in southern China
harvested pears, asparagus and
tomatoes here from dawn till
dusk, and spent their free time
playing pai gow, a domino-like
game. A handful of those men,
now wizened, sit silently on
weathered wooden benches,
waiting to die. With them will
pass America's last rural
Chinatown.
In 1912, Tin San Chan, a labor
contractor, founded the town
on land owned by three

brothers, George, Clay and
Lloyd Locke. Three years later,
the Chinatown in nearby Walnut
Grove burned to the ground,
and the residents moved a
half-mile upriver to Locke. De
scendants of Chinese who had
flocked to California during the
Gold Rush, they built the only
type of community they
knewâ€”a mining town with two
story wood-frame buildings and

hitching posts. The new settlers,
forbidden by state law to own
land, rented the buildings from
George Locke, a rancher.
Locke was transformed into a
pleasure palace. Flouting Pro
hibition, bootleggers opened
speakeasies that catered to the
Chinese, Filipino, and Mexican
field hands who sweated in the
sun-drenched orchards.
Brothels offered erotic diver

sions. Gambling halls, sounding
with the clatter of mah jongg
tiles, rounded out the enter
tainment.
As Locke flourished, the per
manent population grew to 400,
with the field workers swelling
the number to no more than 1000
during harvest season. At one
point, the town had a theater,
school, church, post office,
poolroom, fish market, bakery,

lodge, five hotels and rooming
houses, six restaurants and nine
grocery stores. Paddlewheel
steamers docked near a 1000-
foot-long vegetable packing
shed along the river to load up
with produce for cities in the
East.
Today, the brothels and bet
ting halls are gone. Al's stands
on Main Street as the lone
