I Love's Labour's Lost is not one
pfjpf the more often performed
of Shakespeare. Unlike
the rest of the early comedies, it
d :>es not really have a happy en
ding, and the humor in it is
Hiuch more verbal and less ob-
in someof theothers.
H|he Valley Shakespeare Festival
; production, directed by Sabin
tries to handle the dif
ficulties of the play by setting in
the 1920sâ€”a sort of Brideshead
R?visited/Great Catsby world of
social posing and failing inno-
The result is an intellec
tually interesting production
lacks heart; the characters
rarely touch you enough to
you care what happens to
them. Because of this, the end
ing of the play, instead of being
bittersweet, is just strange. In
general, the performances are

pretty good, but the choices
made leave them a singularly
unappealing cast of characters.
The play concerns four men
who decide to cloister them
selves without women, drink, or
too much food for three years in
order to study. The princess of
France (Janice Cole) arrives with
her train to speak to one of these
men, the King of Navarre, on
political matters. When he is
forced to speak with her, he falls
in love, and the three other men
follow suit with the women in
her train. Each tries to hide his
love from the others, but when
they find each other out, the
four young men decide to help
each other attain their respec
tive ladies. The women do not
take them particularly seriously,
and the men are therefore not
particularly successful.
The four young men, rather

dashing in their '20s outfits, are
played as very young and naive.
Dick Butterfield has some very
good moments as the somewhat
pompous king, especially when
he's totally at a loss after being
put down by the princess, but
does not quite match her inten
sity on stage, and so seems
overwhelmed at times. Brian
Cousins as the witty Berowne is
the person who comes closest to
engaging our attentions and our
sympathy in his soliloquies on
love. He can be very appealing
on stage. Unfortunately, when
he is involved in witty banter
with his lady (Rosaline, played
by Lynn McCormick), he is
hard to follow, and I often got
lost trying to understand what
the jests were about. Scott Wil
liams as Longaville and |ohn Ter
lesky as Dumaine were fine for
what they were doing, though

there was so much standing
around in clever poses in gen
eral that it is hard to think of
them as more than clever period
background. Terlesky did have
one memorable sequence in
which he mocked theaccent and
mannerisms of the princess' at
tendant, Boyet (Richard Barner).
lanice Cole as the princess
was clearly the most appealing
presence in the show. She came
closer to consistently revealing
real emotions than anyone else
on and one brief burst ol
fury at the conclusion of the
story was the play's best mo
ment. She also delivers the verse
beautifully, and it is a pleasure to
listen to her. Lynn McCormick,
as the acid-tongued Rosaline, is
very technically competent, and
easy to understand. The charac
ter she plays however, is so cold
it is impossible to understand

how anyone could fall in love
with her, despite the fact that
she is the best-looking of the
four girls in the period cos
tumes.
There is a major problem with
either the script or the produc
tion in the way that the women
deal with the men. When they
first arrive at Navarre, they de
scribe their respective gentle
men with so much fervor that
the princess accuses them of
being in love, later, when they
receive poems and favors, they
seem delighted, though they
mock their lovers a bit. How
ever, when the men finally ap
pear, they are so consistently
nasty to them, and the cruelty
seems so without inner warmth,
it is impossible to understand
what is going on. At least as por
trayed here, the wit is not the
