# 'The Three Musketeers' and a lot of swords
## 
### MARC FAJER 
From the moment D'Artagnan
walks on stage brandishing a
sword in practice against his
father, the Valley Shakespeare
Festival production of The Three
Musketeers is dominated by the
flash and clang of fine fencing.
While Peter Raby's adaptation of
Alexandre Dumas' novel tries to
do too much too quickly, the di
rection and superb combat
choreography by J. Steven
White make the production ex
citing, interesting, and a lot of
fun.
Anyone who has read the
novel, or seen the two Richard
I Lester movies, knows how much
story there is to The Three Mus
keteers. Trying to stuff it into a
two-hour performance inevita
bly lea> o some shallow

dialogue and very sudden transi
tions. The Festival cast rises
above these problems with the
script and creates a series of in
teresting portrayals that give life
to the story.
John Terlesky leads the cast
with a superb rendition of D'Ar
tagnan. He is good-looking and
talented, both speaking and
fighting, but behind his techni
cal competence is an incredibly
appealing and charming stage
presence that captivates the au
dience from the moment it
sees him. The ease with which he
allows himself to be challenged
to three duels at the very outset
of the play, and the poise with
which he handles the situation
are captivating, and we are wil
ling to forgive him every incon
sistency and foible that he has at

the sight of his smile.
The musketeers themselves
are also very good. David Booth
is superb as Athos, especially in
the second half of the show
when he deals with his own past
life and with Milady de Winter
(Lynn McCormick). The story of
his first marriage that he tells to
D'Artagnan is esppcially good.
Dennis Martin's Porthos is
properly vain and charming,
especially in the scenes with a
wealthy married lady whom he
has charmed (Kay Martin). Brian
Cousins is also good as Aramis,
notably in the scene in which
D'Artagnan woos him back from
the church.
Mitch Sutton does a very
funny turn as a foppish effemi
nate Louis XIII, and Al Blair is
very good as the scheming Car

dinal Richelieu. Dianne Man
ning, as Anne of Austria, the
queen, seems a bit too cold to
have won the love of the Duke of
Buckingham, and she has been
saddled with a German accent
which makes her difficult to un
derstand in places. However,
these problems are to be forgi
ven on the strength of one mar
velous moment. When she en
ters the ball in her honor, wear
ing the full set of diamonds that
her husband and the cardinal be
lieve to be missing, there is a
smile on her face that perfectly
conveys the triumph of the mo
ment and explains why she
seems so cold elsewhere. I he
dance that follows, as Louis tries
vainly to count the diamonds as
she goes through her steps with
complete aplomb, is hysterical,

in part on the strength of the
wonderful smile.
Lynn McCormick as Milady,
the villainess of the piece, is un
even. She has the initial disabil
ity of competing against my
memories of Faye Dunaway
from the movies, but she does
not seem either strong or com
pelling enough in the early part
of the play to carry off the tasks
she is performing. As the play
progresses, she gets better and
her scenes with Athos late in the
show are quite good. She is at
her best in two moments of de
speration. The sequence in
which she convinces the English
puritan Felton (Phil Weinstock)
to kill Buckingham is very well
done; her duplicity as she feigns
religion to appeal to his austere
piety is so good it sets your teeth
on edge. She is equally good in
the final scene as she begs D'Ar
tagnan for mercy.
Stanford grad Dick Butterfield
is wonderfully despicable as the
not-too-competent villain
Rochefort. Janice Cole as the in
nocent Constance and Sandra
Sutton as Kitty are both good as
well. Tristan Smith, as de
Wardes, an arrogant young no
ble, does an amazing job in a
particularly exciting fencing
sequence with D'Artagnan. Phil
Weinstock is good both as the
puritan and as D'Artagnan's
man, Planchet. The only really
noticeable weakness in the cast
is Bill Peck's Buckingham, and
the actor is less at fault than the
casting. It is simply impossible to
believe that this ineffectual
young man, however charming,
is Chancellor of England.

There are occasional prob
lems with the direction. The ball
issaddled with a longand boring
dance sequence. The dancers,
while not awful, are not so
talented that they can make a
minuet interesting for any
length of time. There is also a
great deal of music in the
background that does not be
long to the period, and seems to
get in the way rather than add
anything. The fight sequences
are fascinating enough without
Romantic or modern music to
aid them, and the result is
somewhat melodramatic in
places. However, there are a
number of clever creative
touches that more than make up
for the flaws.
The Three Musketeers plays
through this weekend at the Paul
Masson Vienyards in Saratoga,
and then goes on tour. If you
enjoy the excitement of good
sword fighting, the show should
not be missed, and it is a great
deal of fun for anyone.
