# Playing for fools in Satan's Alley
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
In Comden and Green's first
rate satiric musical, The Band
Wagon, a pair of writers prepare
j big comeback show for a
middle-aged song and dance
nan (Fred Astaire), only to have
t transformed into a musical
updating of Faust by a director
»vith delusions of grandeur. Of
:ourse, the show bombs out of
town, and the star has to take it
n hand and turn it back into an
unpretentious musical comedy
aefore it can succeed. In Staying
Mive, Sylvester Stallone's sequel
to Saturday Night Fever, Tony
Manero (John Travolta) lands a
role in an all-dance show called
Satan's Alley, which appears to
be a musical version of Dante's
Inferno, though with plot and
characters omitted. From what
we see of the production, it's
largely incomprehensible, and
the Broadway audience that
cheers for a show like Dream
girls would likely storm out at
intermission. But unlike Com-
Iden and Green, Stallone and his
co-writer, Normar. Wexler, have
no sense of irony. Satan's Alley is
an immediate sensation, bring
ing the opening night theater
goers to their feet.
Musicals do not demand
iron-clad plausibility, God
knows, but you have to establish
some kind of conventions when
make a movie, and Staying
Alive plays us all for fools. We
can't believe in the chorus
dancer-to-star cliche from 42nd
Street in the context of a pop
tontemp romance in which
everyone talks like an EST
graduate or a soap opera heavy.
(Those characters who don't
spout the latest platitudes about
"energy" and "potential" drop
ton-weight gems like "Every
body uses everybody, right?") If
a picture keeps reminding us

how bleak the times are, we balk
when a show closes one night
and the very next day its creators
hold auditions for a new one, as
if we were still in the '20s, when
two or three musicals opened on
Broadway every week, and as if
no one had to be found to put up
the money for a highly dubious
commercial venture like a
choreographer's vision of hell.
When the bearded, tough-dude
director, Jesse (for Fosse?), lec
tures Tony continually for put
ting his pride ahead of the show,
we might be skeptical about a
finale in which Tony changes the
choreography to suit his own
ego and receives not a word of
censure for it. (Even in Funny
Girl, when Fanny Brice
brightened a glamor number
into a comic turn on opening
night of the Follies, Ziegfeld had
to think twice about whether to
fire her.)
Staying Alive abounds with re
ferences to Saturday Night
Fever, which isn't a smart move,
because any comparison bet
ween the two films necessarily
makes Staying Alive look even
worse. Saturday Night Fever
wasn't exactly art, but the danc
ing and the Bee Gees songs and
the performances of Travolta
and Karen Gorney energized
even the dreariest patches of the
screenplay. In Staying Alive the
energy comes pre-packaged,
like the backstage love-triangle

plot; the songs (some by the Bee
Gees, others by Stallone's
brother Frank, who does a bit on
screen as a guitarist) are
second-rate; and the choreog
raphy is so silly that you can't tell
if it's well executed or not. In the
Satan's Alley opening a lift low
ers Travolta past rows upon rows
of cages—"Jailhouse Rock"
gone berserk—and past a huge
metallic breast, into a fog of
half-naked bodies writhing amid
pots and pots of smoke. (At the
dress rehearsal of the Faust mus
ical in The Band Wagon, the
smoke made Astaire and Cyd

Charisse gasp and cough, and
impeded their pas de deux.)
Amazed, we watch four num
bers on this incredible set—the
most monumentally foolish
decor since All That Jazz. (Only
we're meant to take this set seri
ously.)
As Laura, the star of Satan's
Alley, Finola Hughes doesn't
play a woman or a dancer, she
plays an attitude—seductive
snobbishness. Though wrapped
in the trendiest casual show-off
fashions, she's too dreadful an
actress to be much of a come
on—her incompetence works
against her looks, as it has for Ali
McGraw and Lois Chiles. She
shrugs her shoudlers and smirks
when she's trying to be sexy or
furious or aloof—quite a range.

(At times she seems intent on
challenging Ali McCraw's status
as the worst actress in Holly
wood. We wait for Travolta to
give up on Laura and return to
his loyal girl friend, Jacki, be
cause Cynthia Rhodes is far
more appealing than Finola
Hughes.
As for Travolta, he's terrifically
charming, of course, and at
moments his boyish self
assurance or ragged, blurry in
jured glances have such inten
sity and sharpness that they jolt
you out of the movie. But it's
basically the performance of a
gifted adolescent—and if you've
watched Travolta grow up in
Blow Out, his return to Tony
Manero looks depressingly like
regression.
