# How to avoid lousy records
## 
### ERIC POSTEL 
I suppose we all read what the
music critics write for different
reasons. My principal reason is
to try to avoid buying lousy re
cords. Given the plethora of new
releases every year, it is very
easy for the avid listener to go
broke. Good reviewers help all
of us separate the wheat from
the chaff.
Unfortunately, heeding re
viewers is also fraught with dif
ficulties. Listening to hundreds
of records and going to concerts
every night understandably
leads to a desire for fresh ideas
often to the point of denigrating
wonderful established artists or
ignoring the musics of the mas
ses. Having recently wasted
bucks on some critically over
rated albums, it was with some
trepidation that I plunked down
$13 to check out two new groups
that have been on top of all the
critics' lists for the past six
months. For once, I was not
shortchanged.
King Sunny Ade and His Afri
can Beats have been playing for
more than 10 years, but Ade has
only recently received exposure
in the United States. That is be
cause he and his band are from
Nigeria. Sunny Ade became so
popular in Africa that he came to
be known as the King. The Afri
can Beats usually number bet
ween 20 and 25 musicians, but
lately the band has been slim
med down to 18. The band fea
tures five vocalists, four electric
guitarists, a drummer, two talk
ing drummers, an electric bas
sist and four percussionists all
led by the King, who sings and
plays lead guitar. The result is a
wonderful blend of Western
funk, African pop and traditional
Yoruban music.
The release of their first

American album, JuJu Music,
and their subsequent U.S. con
cert tour led to unanimous rave
reviews and surprisingly large
ticket sales. Robert Palmer, a
New York Times music critic and
Chris Blackwell, president of Is
land Records for whom Bob Mar
ley recorded, both think that
King Sunny will be the next great
third world music star.
King Sunny Ade's second
album Synchro System was re
leased last month, and I like it
more than its predecessors. This
band is really tight! All of the
percussionists and guitarists are
playing slightly different
rhythms, and yet they are seam
lessly fit together. Don't expect
the strong punch of American
funk or rock though — this
music has a more relaxed flow to
it. But it is energetic just the
same.
The vocals on this album are
less pronounced than on JuJu
Music, and I think that is why I
like Synchro System more. Not
knowing the Yoruban dialect, I

was unable to appreciate the
lyrics of the former, and the voi
ces gave a kind of syrupy pop
feel to the music. The producer
features the music more on the
new album, and the result is
highly successful.
One consumer note: the im
port version has a great cover
showing the entire band,
whereas the domestic version
has only a poor close-up photo
of the King himself. More impor
tant, don't miss the upcoming
performance by Ade and His Af
rican Beats at Berkeley's Greek
Theater because their music is
reportedly best heard live.
My other gamble was de
cidedly different from Ade's
graceful rhythms. The Violent
Femme's hail from Milwaukee
and have already collected quite
a set of anecdotes about them
selves. The best concerns their
big break. It seems that the trio

was playing an acoustic guitar,
Mariachi bass and a single snare
drum on the street near the site
of a Pretenders concert one
night. While the kids on the
street paid no attention to the
Femmes, passing Pretenders
guitarist lames Honeyman-Scott
liked what he saw and offered
the band a spot on that evening's
bill!
In Milwaukee high schools,
"femme" is slang for "wimp,"
and this band is very aptly
named. This is music made by
and about three intense wimps.
And it is wonderful. In my record
collection, the Violent Femmes'
debut is located right after my
Velvet Underground records,
and that is also very fitting.
Guitarist, vocalist and songwri
ter Gordon Gano sings very
much like Lou Reed. Gano's
lyrics cover many of the frustra
tions of all of us who are not
"beautiful people." In "Add It
Up," he sings lyrics sure to give
radio stations fits: "Why can't I
get just one kiss? Why can't I get
just one screw? Believe me, I'd

know what to do." Frustrated,
he says, "I'm so lonely, I don't
think I can take it anymore," in
"Confessions."
Gano's singing melds per
fectly with his lyrics. His imita
tion of his sniveling teacher say
ing, "I hope you know this will
go down on your permanent re
cord" in "Kiss Off" is wonderful,
and "Hack, Hack, Hack" in
"Confessions" shows us all how
three femmes can be violent.
Brian Ritchie's acoustic bass is
often the featured instrument
on the band's self-titled debut
and it tends to give the music a
'50s-era rockabilly feel. Re
semblances to the Velvet Un
derground and rockabilly not
withstanding, Femme music is
totally original. Listen to the in
terplay of the lyrics, xylophone,
guitar, acoustic bass and snare
drum in "Gone Daddy Gone"
and you'll see what I mean. This
is a very promising debut and I
recommend it to any one whose
listening tastes extend beyond
the current mainstream.

cidedly different from Ade's
graceful rhythms. The Violent
Femme's hail from Milwaukee
and have already collected quite
a set of anecdotes about them
selves. The best concerns their
big break. It seems that the trio

was playing an acoustic guitar,
Mariachi bass and a single snare
drum on the street near the site
of a Pretenders concert one
night. While the kids on the
street paid no attention to the
Femmes, passing Pretenders
guitarist lames Honeyman-Scott
liked what he saw and offered
the band a spot on that evening's
bill!
In Milwaukee high schools,
"femme" is slang for "wimp,"
and this band is very aptly
named. This is music made by
and about three intense wimps.
And it is wonderful. In my record
collection, the Violent Femmes'
debut is located right after my
Velvet Underground records,
and that is also very fitting.
Guitarist, vocalist and songwri
ter Gordon Gano sings very
much like Lou Reed. Gano's
lyrics cover many of the frustra
tions of all of us who are not
"beautiful people." In "Add It
Up," he sings lyrics sure to give
radio stations fits: "Why can't I
get just one kiss? Why can't I get
just one screw? Believe me, I'd

know what to do." Frustrated,
he says, "I'm so lonely, I don't
think I can take it anymore," in
"Confessions."
Gano's singing melds per
fectly with his lyrics. His imita
tion of his sniveling teacher say
ing, "I hope you know this will
go down on your permanent re
cord" in "Kiss Off" is wonderful,
and "Hack, Hack, Hack" in
"Confessions" shows us all how
three femmes can be violent.
Brian Ritchie's acoustic bass is
often the featured instrument
on the band's self-titled debut
and it tends to give the music a
'50s-era rockabilly feel. Re
semblances to the Velvet Un
derground and rockabilly not
withstanding, Femme music is
totally original. Listen to the in
terplay of the lyrics, xylophone,
guitar, acoustic bass and snare
drum in "Gone Daddy Gone"
and you'll see what I mean. This
is a very promising debut and I
recommend it to any one whose
listening tastes extend beyond
the current mainstream.


I suppose we all read what the
music critics write for different
reasons. My principal reason is
to try to avoid buying lousy re
cords. Given the plethora of new
releases every year, it is very
easy for the avid listener to go
broke. Good reviewers help all
of us separate the wheat from
the chaff.
Unfortunately, heeding re
viewers is also fraught with dif
ficulties. Listening to hundreds
of records and going to concerts
every night understandably
leads to a desire for fresh ideas
often to the point of denigrating
wonderful established artists or
ignoring the musics of the mas
ses. Having recently wasted
bucks on some critically over
rated albums, it was with some
trepidation that I plunked down
$13 to check out two new groups
that have been on top of all the
critics' lists for the past six
months. For once, I was not
shortchanged.
King Sunny Ade and His Afri
can Beats have been playing for
more than 10 years, but Ade has
only recently received exposure
in the United States. That is be
cause he and his band are from
Nigeria. Sunny Ade became so
popular in Africa that he came to
be known as the King. The Afri
can Beats usually number bet
ween 20 and 25 musicians, but
lately the band has been slim
med down to 18. The band fea
tures five vocalists, four electric
guitarists, a drummer, two talk
ing drummers, an electric bas
sist and four percussionists all
led by the King, who sings and
plays lead guitar. The result is a
wonderful blend of Western
funk, African pop and traditional
Yoruban music.
The release of their first

American album, JuJu Music,
and their subsequent U.S. con
cert tour led to unanimous rave
reviews and surprisingly large
ticket sales. Robert Palmer, a
New York Times music critic and
Chris Blackwell, president of Is
land Records for whom Bob Mar
ley recorded, both think that
King Sunny will be the next great
third world music star.
King Sunny Ade's second
album Synchro System was re
leased last month, and I like it
more than its predecessors. This
band is really tight! All of the
percussionists and guitarists are
playing slightly different
rhythms, and yet they are seam
lessly fit together. Don't expect
the strong punch of American
funk or rock though — this
music has a more relaxed flow to
it. But it is energetic just the
same.
The vocals on this album are
less pronounced than on JuJu
Music, and I think that is why I
like Synchro System more. Not
knowing the Yoruban dialect, I

was unable to appreciate the
lyrics of the former, and the voi
ces gave a kind of syrupy pop
feel to the music. The producer
features the music more on the
new album, and the result is
highly successful.
One consumer note: the im
port version has a great cover
showing the entire band,
whereas the domestic version
has only a poor close-up photo
of the King himself. More impor
tant, don't miss the upcoming
performance by Ade and His Af
rican Beats at Berkeley's Greek
Theater because their music is
reportedly best heard live.
