# How to avoid lousy records
## 
### ERIC POSTEL 
I suppose we all read what the
music critics write for different
reasons. My principal reason is
to try to avoid buying lousy re
cords. Given the plethora of new
releases every year, it is very
easy for the avid listener to go
broke. Good reviewers help all
of us separate the wheat from
the chaff.
Unfortunately, heeding re
viewers is also fraught with dif
ficulties. Listening to hundreds
of records and going to concerts
every night understandably
leads to a desire for fresh ideas
often to the point of denigrating
wonderful established artists or
ignoring the musics of the mas
ses. Having recently wasted
bucks on some critically over
rated albums, it was with some
trepidation that I plunked down
$13 to check out two new groups
that have been on top of all the
critics' lists for the past six
months. For once, I was not
shortchanged.
King Sunny Ade and His Afri
can Beats have been playing for
more than 10 years, but Ade has
only recently received exposure
in the United States. That is be
cause he and his band are from
Nigeria. Sunny Ade became so
popular in Africa that he came to
be known as the King. The Afri
can Beats usually number bet
ween 20 and 25 musicians, but
lately the band has been slim
med down to 18. The band fea
tures five vocalists, four electric
guitarists, a drummer, two talk
ing drummers, an electric bas
sist and four percussionists all
led by the King, who sings and
plays lead guitar. The result is a
wonderful blend of Western
funk, African pop and traditional
Yoruban music.
The release of their first

American album, JuJu Music,
and their subsequent U.S. con
cert tour led to unanimous rave
reviews and surprisingly large
ticket sales. Robert Palmer, a
New York Times music critic and
Chris Blackwell, president of Is
land Records for whom Bob Mar
ley recorded, both think that
King Sunny will be the next great
third world music star.
King Sunny Ade's second
album Synchro System was re
leased last month, and I like it
more than its predecessors. This
band is really tight! All of the
percussionists and guitarists are
playing slightly different
rhythms, and yet they are seam
lessly fit together. Don't expect
the strong punch of American
funk or rock though â€” this
music has a more relaxed flow to
it. But it is energetic just the
same.
The vocals on this album are
less pronounced than on JuJu
Music, and I think that is why I
like Synchro System more. Not
knowing the Yoruban dialect, I
