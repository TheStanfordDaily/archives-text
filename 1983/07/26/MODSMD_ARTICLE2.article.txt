# Doctors, patients, stress need of research animals

### BILL AINSWORTH 
San Francisco — Physicians
and patients from Stanford and
the University of California at
San Francisco yesterday said that
legislation prohibiting pound
animals from being used in
laboratories seriously threatens
the future of medical innova
tions.
Norman Shumway, Stanford's
renowned cardiac surgeon and a
pioneer in heart and lung trans
plants, severely criticized the
bill, Senate Bill 883, in a press
conference held at UC-San
Francisco.
"Rationally it makes very little
sense to most of us engaged in
research activity," he said.
"These animals are going to be
lost anyway and they will there
fore serve no useful purpose."
Under SB 883, all laboratories
would have to purchase animals
from special breeders who
raised the animals for that pur
pose. This would result in more
animals being killed every year,
Shumway said.
He said SB 883 has gained
momentum for reasons that are
difficult to understand even
though "95 out of a 100 people
off the street would oppose the
bill." He cited political tradeoffs
and the support of the bill by
"pleas of Hollywood persons
wMo know nuililng aOout re-
Search," as the reasons for its
success.
In addition, SB 883 has gained
strong support from a group or
ganized by the bill's sponsor,
Sen. David Roberti (D-
Hollywood), called Respect Our
Animals' Rights. So far the legis-

lation has passed the State Se
nate and is before the Assembly,
where it is scheduled to be
heard in the Government Or
ganizations Committee on Aug.
17.

Julius Krevans, the chancellor
of UCSF, said the present
$900,000 spent on cats and dogs
at all health science schools in
the state would rise to $20 mill
ion in the first year for UC alone:
$12 million would be capital
costs spent on constructing a
breeding facility and $8 million
for upkeep each year.
Both Krevans and Shumway
indicated their willingness to
Clinport loßUUtinn tKat would
greatly reauie ihe chances
pets ending up as lab animals.
Among the plans they support
are ones that would prohibit the
use of animals with collars or
animals marked by their owners
from being used in labs. In addi
tion they favor increasing the
length of time animals spend at

the pound, allowing owners
more time to reclaim lost pets.
"If the concern is that animals
are being used capriciously,
then the legislation should deal
with that," Krevans said.
Countering claims that ani
mals are treated cruelly in
laboratories, Krevans said, "We
and other institutions follow the
rules and regulations and
guidelines for humane treat
ment in laboratory animals."
Bill Boxberger, a patient at
Stanford who has had two heart
transplant operations, said,
"Through animal research I have
hope for the future, my wife has
a husband and my three children
have a father."
Another patient of Shum
way's, Cynthia Jelkman, who re
ceived a heart transplant in 1977,
said the bill "was an atrocious
mistake. I don't think the public
understands the value of animal
research."
Outside the well-attended
press conference, a proponent
of SB 883 carried a sign showing
caged animals that were being
used in laboratories.
Virginia Hundley, of the Fund
for Animals, claimed that the
higher cost of buying animals for
research would force resear
chers to look for alternatives to
pxopriments she claimed were
in many r,
Although Hundley agreed that
SB 883 would result in more
animals being killed, she said
that animals bred for use in the
laboratory would be psycholog
ically better able to withstand
being caged and experimented
upon.
