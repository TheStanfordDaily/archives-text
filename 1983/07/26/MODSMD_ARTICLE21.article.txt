Kissinger reports for duty
Washington — Henry Kissinger checked in with
President Reagan yesterday in his new role as head of
a special commission on Central America, and said he
may soon visit the region, including Nicaragua. Pen
tagon sources, meanwhile, disclosed that the battle
ship New jersey soon will join the growing U.S. ar
mada off Nicaraguan shores.
The 20-minute Oval Office meeting reflected a
flurry of activity in recent days regarding the volatile
region:
— Pentagon sources said the battleship New Jersey
cut short a far-Eastern cruise and headed across the
Pacific Ocean to join the aircraft carrier Ranger and
seven other vessels which took up stations yesterday
off the west coast of Central America "to underscore
U.S. support of friendly countries."
— Sources reported Pentagon suggestions that the
number of U.S. military advisers in El Salvador — now
55 — be doubled, and officials have said the administ
ration is contemplating joint U.S.-Honduran ground
exercises.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the
Ranger maneuvers could help contribute to reduced
tensions. He did not say how this would take place.
Speakes said that if the ships in the Ranger battle
group encountered hostile fire, they were under
standing orders to defend themselves.

Reagan to meet with Israelis
Washington — President Reagan, facing a de
teriorating situation in Lebanon, will meet with two
top Israeli officials to discuss Israel's planned pull
back from embattled areas of the country, while he
sends his new Mideast envoy to Damascus to press
again for Syria's cooperation.
U.S. sources said yesterday that the Reagan ad
ministration will try to persuade Israel to delay the
pull-back to allow for more time to work out new
security arrangements for the areas Israel will
evacuate, particularly in the Chouf region east of
Beirut.
Reagan asked for the visit by Foreign Minister Yit
zhak Shamir and Defense Minister Moshe Arens after
President Menachem Begin cancelled a trip he had
planned this week.
However, Israel already has announced plans to
begin withdrawing its troops from some areas of
central Lebanon, among them the Chouf region east
of Beirut where there has been heavy fighting bet
ween the right-wing Christian militia and fighters
from the Druse Moslem sect.
The heavy fighting has occurred even with Israelis
in the area, and both Lebanese and American officials
are now warning that a full-fledged civil war between
Moslems and Christians could break out if the Israelis
withdraw.
Underscoring concern was the formation over the
weekend of a Syrian-backed opposition front headed
by Druse leader Walid Jumblatt, the avowed purpose

of which is to oust the government of President Amin
Gemayel.
Poland grants amnesty
Warsaw, Poland — About 180 political prisoners and
ordinary criminals were released yesterday under an
amnesty linked to last week's lifting of martial law in
Poland.
Late yesterday, the official Polish news agency PAP
said amnesty had been granted to 182 people. Ac
cording to the news agency, those freed included 26
convicted of political offenses, 28 sentenced for
common crimes and 73 who were under investiga
tion.
In all, about 765 persons are expected to be re
leased. They will not include about 70 top leaders of
the banned Solidarity independent trade union
movement and other major activists that the govern
ment views as a continuing threat to the Communist
regime.
A number of persons being released were shown
on television as their identity cards were returned to
them. The commentator said all had signed pledges
promising not to violate "the legal order," as re
quired under the amnesty provisions.
Today's weather
Mostly sunny today. Highs in the 60s and 70s. Lows
in the mid-50s, with light westerly winds this after
noon.
