# Corporate power struggle enters the athletic arena
## 
### DONALD NAGLE 
What some saw as a somewhat
unique version of an immense
corporate power struggle raged
Saturday and Sunday at Stanford
Stadium where 92 corporate
teams and more than 1000 run
ners from across the country
vied for the track championships
of the Corporate Cup Associa
tion.
Corporate Cup spokesmen
said the field was the strongest
in the five-year history of the
event as eight national Corpo
rate Cup records fell in the two
days of competition.
Defending team champ
American Telephone & Tele
graph (AT&T) came to Stanford
with an even stronger squad
than last year, but so did chal
lengers General Electric (GE), In
ternational Business Machines
(IBM) and Texas Instruments
(Tl). Nonetheless, AT&T man
aged to garner the title a second
time with 133 points, two more
than GE's 131 points.
GE nearly took the Cup in the
last race of the day — the sprint
relay. For GE to overtake AT&T's
lead, it needed runners in the
top spot and in the eighth place
or higher. But GE's chips were
down, and AT&T's were blue as
the last runner crossed the finish
line.
IBM finished third with 93
points and Texas Instruments
fourth with 88. Ford, Bank of
America, Hewlett-Packard, De
lta, Exxon and Rockwell Interna
tional rounded out the top 10
class AA teams.

IBM's Lloyd Johnson proved
to be the most exciting runner at
the meet. A stellar performer last
year, Johnson once again led his
team to victory in several races.
The first of these races — the
pyramid relay — appeared to be
a two-team race between Exxon
and Chevron. After the first
three legs (440, 880 and 1320
yards respectively), IBM was a
distant third.
Johnson took the baton 75
yards behind the Chevron and
Exxon runners. When he
handed it off, he had scorched
the track with a 1:48 half-mile
split and made up 65 yards of the
differential. IBM's anchorman
easily finished off the lead run
ner, passing him on the
backstretch enroute to a new
Corporate Cup national record
of 9:00.3 for the nine-lap race.
In the three-lap sprint final
three hours later, Johnson ran
the lead leg, a 440 that got the
entire crowd on its feet. When
he passed the stick less than 50
seconds later, the IBM team was
out tront to stay with a com
manding 30-yard lead. IBM won
the three-lap race at a national
record pace of 2:26.4.
On Saturday, Johnson also
won his heat of the mile team
race, coming from behind on
the last lap with a great kick and
speeding past the leaders to a
4:22 clocking.
The Stanford Daily also par
ticipated in the running this
weekend. The team of Sue
Mathison, Donald Nagle, Jen
nifer Rosen, Greg Webb and
Mark Zeigler ran in the invita

tional media pyramid relay, plac
ing fourth behind NBC, Run
ners' World and the Los Angeles
Times.

In the media sprint relay 90
minutes later, the Daily was fifth
behind Group W Cable, KBLX
Radio, the Los Angeles Times

and Runners' World. The Daily
finished fourth in the overall
media standings, tallying 15
team points in the two races.
