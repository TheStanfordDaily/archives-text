## Arms cost figure heavy in economy 
### 
Washington—ln 1947, when
scientists at Bell Telephone Labs
perfected the tiny miracle of
germanium and wire known as
the transistor, they helped
catapult the world into the age of
high technology. But the first
commercial models of the re
volutionary electronic amplify
ing device were prohibitively
expensive: One early transistor
radio cost $119.
Enter the Pentagon, with its
bottomless pocketbook and a
voracious appetite for just such a
device to replace the old
fashioned, energy-gobbling
vacuum tube in military com
munications equipment. Spur
red by the military demand, in
dustry improved design and
production processes. Costs
plummeted. Soon the world was
awash in low-cost hearing aids,
hi-fi sets and other products,' in
cluding a $3.50 version of that
$119 radio.
The history of the transistor
has often been cited to prove
that huge defense budgets are a
boon to the U.S. economy, a,
flood tide that lifts all boats. To
day, however, as the United
States faces tougher and
tougher economic competition
from abroad, there are increas
ing doubts about the impact of
massive military spending.
A growing number of
economists, defense analysts,
businessmen and even some
Pentagon officials are question
ing whether more defense
spending does, in fact, lead to
more civilian growth and pros

perity. Instead of nourishing the
economy, many suggest, milit
ary spending siphons off money
and manpower that could be in
vested more productively out
side the defense establish
for new plants and equipment,
for research on better products
and processes, and for worker
training and education.
"The real problem in the build
up, from the point of view of
the civilian economy, is that
we're having this military build
up and our political allies and
economic competitors are not,"
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology economist Lester
Thurow said. "We just can't af
ford to siphon off 8 percent to 9
percent ofourGNPforthemilit
ary, while Germany siphons off
3.5 percent and Japan less than 1
percent.
"If the brightest engineers in
Japan are designing video re
corders and the brightest en
gineers in the United States are
designing MX missiles, then we
shouldn't find it surprising that
they conquer the video
recorder market."
The upshot of all this, critics
say, is that soaring Pentagon
budgets are becoming a threat
to the long-term health of the
total economy, /the very
economy from which defense
draws its sustenance.
Proponents of increased de
fense spending argue that the
United States is nowhere near
that danger point, and a number
of respected economists agree.
Military spending creates jobs,

especially for skilled
technologists, and it under
writes research and develop
ment programs that have spinoff
benefits for the whole economy.
"We shouldn't spend a nickel
more for defense than national
security demands," Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger
said in defense of the administ
ration's military expansion prog
ram at a Senate Budget Commit
tee hearing earlier this year.
"But it is equally wrong to
equate defense spending with
something that damages the

economy.
Critics acknowledge that
military spending can stimulate
the economy, just as other kinds
of spending do, but they think
Weinberger may underestimate
the negative effects of the
Reagan buildup in the short
term. And in the longer term,
they argue, serious problems
exist that conventional mac
roeconomic analysis may over
look.
Specifically, these critics say:
— In the short term, the
spending envisioned by the

Reagan administration's record
peacetime military buildup will
mean more large-scale federal
borrowing unless Congress cuts
back on other government
spending or Reagan accedes to a
tax increase, with neither step
considered likely, government
borrowing threatens to crowd
out private investors and send
interest rates soaring again.
The first casualty of higher in
terest rates would be chances
for a sustained economic recov
ery.
