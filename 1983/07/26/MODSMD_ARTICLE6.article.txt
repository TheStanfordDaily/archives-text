# Central Americans confused about U.S. policy

Tegucigalpa, Honduras—Facing a rapid
succession of U.S. diplomatic and milit
ary measures designed to pressure
Nicaragua's Sandinista government,
some of Washington's closest allies in
Central America are expressing confu
sion about the direction of American pol
icy in the area and a growing fear that
crossed signals could lead to serious mis
calculations and widening war.
Honduran Foreign Minister Edgardo
Paz Barnica said in an interview Sunday
"the military attitude of the United
States" toward neighboring Nicaragua is
"a unilateral attitude" even though Hon
duras will participate in many of the milit
ary exercises announced over the last few
days.
By sending aircraft carriers and escort
ships to Central America's shores,
Washington "could serve to provide
pressure" for more fruitful negotiations
between Nicaragua and its neighbors "or
it could worsen tension," Paz Barnica
said.
"That's why we have to have faith in the
initiatives of C.ontadora," Paz Barnica
concluded, referring to diplomatic ef
forts by Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia
and Panama to promote talks among the
five Central American republics without
any direct involvement by the United
States.
Officials of three of the Contadora
countries who met in Caracas, Ven

ezuela, last week, joined the presidents
of three other Latin American countries
Sunday in issuing a statement in Caracas
calling for an end to foreign interference
in Central America, one of the goals of
the Contadora effort.

While the Reagan administ
ration's demands on the
Sandinistas once focused
mainly on ending their sup
port for leftist insurgents in El
Salvador / the current em
phasis is on fundamentally
changing the character of
the revolutionary Nicara
guan government, which has
taken a hard line in restrict
ing political opposition.

Cuban president Fidel Castro has also
publicly expressed support for the Con
tadora initiative. The Mexican govern
ment newspaper El National published a
letter from Castro to the presidents of the
Contadora countries saying, "We are sin
cere supporters of the fact that confronta
tion should be substituted by dialogue."

At least one of the Contadora presi
dents, Belisario Betancur of Colombia,
will be visiting Central America this week
in preparation for a meeting of the Con
tadora and Central American foreign
ministers in Panama beginning Thursday.
The Nicaraguans, meanwhile, issued
their most flexible negotiating agenda yet
last Tuesday, even as some Sandinista of
ficials warned that Washington and its
Navy may be trying "to turn the Gulf of
Fonseca into the Gulf of Tonkin" by forc
ing an incident or military confrontation
that could prompt direct U.S. interven
tion.
Vet for all the movement toward the
bargaining table there is still worry
among many Central Americans that the
most powerful player, the United States,
is unsure of exactly what it wants and how
to get it, what it will accept and what it will
not.
"There is a sensation of confusion, of
surprise," said a senior Honduran official
reviewing the Reagan administration's
recent moves toward peace and war.
"An American fleet, support for Con
tadora and at the same time for the con
tras and then saying 'Nicaragua's
negotiating proposal' is 'positive;' it
seems no one voice is authoritative in
policy," the official said. Central Ameri
cans call the U.S.-backed anti-Sandinista
guerrillas contras, or counter
revolutionaries.

The clearest trend that has emerged
from Washington appears to be toward
confrontation with the revolutionary
government in Managua.
While the Reagan administration's de
mands on the Sandinistas once focused
mainly on ending their support for leftist
insurgents in El Salvador, the current em
phasis is on fundamentally changing the
character of the revolutionary Nicaraguan
government, which has taken a hard line
in restricting political opposition.
A senior U.S. diplomat in the region
suggested that other points of interest
probably cannot be negotiated success
fully with the Sandinistas until they
change their approach to government.
"It is now considered that the only way
they can be trusted to keep an agreement
is to have the type of government which
would force them to do so or make it a
public issue," he said.
Asked why the lack of democracy in
right-wing countries of the region does
not provoke the same reaction from
Washington, the diplomat said, "We
have more influence over the others. Vou
can trust them not to go against vital U.S.
interests."
Despite their confusion about
Washington's negotiating stance, Central
American allies of the United States also
say the Sandinistas must return to their
original promises of conventional,
pluralistic democracy.
