# OPINIONS
## Don Caughey Debate continues... 
### 
Hoover Fellow Edwin Har
wood has finally exposed his
true beliefs about academic
freedom. In his earlier effort
(Daily, June 24) he sounded al
most reasonable. While he
missed my point that academic
freedom by itself was not suffi
cient to guarantee the ethical
health of the university, he
wrote: "I would never follow
Dean Caughey in saying that
there must be something 'wrong
with academic freedom' simply
because it has been used to sup
port ideas I consider foolish.
Nor would I ever imply that
'truth is honored' only when
others come to accept my con
cept of 'social justice' or 'op
pression.' For conceivably I
might be wrong. It is for the
other side to try to persuade
me."
But, on July 15, his reply to me
is littered with references to
"guiltist homilies written by ag
grieved sociologists,
philosophers who have lost in
terest in their academic
portfolios and theologians try
ing to revive a flagging market
for traditional religion by bor
rowing the vestments of the
Marxist faith to curry favor with
young people whose devotions
might otherwise become the
exclusive property of the secular
left."
Further, he refers to those
who do not share his views on
the Cold War as a cancer. He
writes: ". . .the USSR was en
couraged to exploit this 'de
tente' because of the failure of
nerve among the political and
r Â«.>t IYIC
West. This failure of nerve, in
turn, was occasioned by the loss of
faith among our educated strata
in their own political systems
and societies. And sadly, the
American university proved to
be an exceptionally good host to
this malignant self-flagellation
which metastasized to large
segments of the press, to the re
ligious orders and now to
numerous other precincts." (I
have emphasized the references
to faith.)
Wearing his ideological blind
ers, it is no wonder that Har
wood has not been able to find
persuasive or even credible the
idea that those nations whose in
ternal politics have been sub
verted by the globalist struggle
between the superpowers
would benefit from the relaxa
tion of that struggle. Nor does it
surprise me that Harwood has
been unable to understand the
meaning of what he regards as
heresy and does not seek to in
vestigate.
The sentence he quotes as
having nothing to do with what
he wrote on June 24 was a direct
response to his question, "was
the intellectual defense of the
Weimar Republic more to be
suspected than the ideas ad
vanced by the National Socialists
who sought its destruction?" I
replied that it was always impor
tant to suspect self-serving
statements, that in the analogy
with Weimar it is crucial to re
member that establishment
wealth and power deserted the
republic to support Hitler and
defeat communism and that
apart from its political useful
ness to the Right, Nazi ideology
cou'd not stand the light of
reason. It is hard to debate with
someone who cannot re
member his own questions.
I have no illusions about per
suading an idealogue like Har
wood, and I would not bother
responding to his insults were

this issue merely personal. Were
it not that his "ideas" are being
used, I would spare the readers
of the Daily Harwood's visceral
fulminations and my responses.
The value of this exchange is that
his articles are on the public re
cord. Nothing I could say about
Hoover could make my case bet
ter.
What is most disturbing about
Harwood's claims about acad
emic freedom is the religious
hatred he displays against those
of us who have "lost faith" in the
sanctity of our political and so
cial institutions. Far from insist
ing that I or those who agree
with me have a "monopoly on
the wellspring of truth and jus
tice," I have dared to question
Harwood's "civil religion." I
have refused to accept this Cold
War theology of the forces of
light and darkness, and have re
jected the justification of U.S.
adventurism as the use of right
eous violence. I am even willing
to allow Russians and com
munists to have legitimate polit
ical interests while I stand firm in
criticizing Russian violence in
Afghanistan and Poland. This
loss of "faith" is enough to dis
qualify me from Harwood's
world of theological debate. I
hope Daily readers would find
Harwood's sectarianism enough
to disqualify him from the world
of serious intellectual inquiry.
One wonders what kind of
Stanford Harwood would have
in order to prevent the heresy
that has led to the "loss of
nerve." Surely he would not tol
erate me or others who asked
challenging questions about our
political economic and social in
stitutions. Gone would be the
"aggrieved social scientists and
humanists from the liberal arts."
No representative of "the Mar
xist faith" would be given intel
lectual credentials. Pacifists and
others who lacked "nerve" or
manliness would have to be
treated as intellectual carcino
gens.
Harwood asks what I mean
when I say that I want truth and
justice to be the standards by
which I am judged: "How is this
'truth and justice' to materialize?
Who will fetch it for us so that
the validity of the Dean's argu
ments can be certified?" Con
trary to Harwood, I do not be
lieve that truth and justice come
in nice ideological packages.
There is room for conscientious
disagreement, and given that
disagreement, at some point our
ideas must be expressed in acts
of faith. No one may be the lord
of another's conscience.
My point throughout has been
that anti-communism as rep
resented in Harwood and too
many others at Hoover renders
moot questions of truth and jus
tice. Relativism does not render
us incapable of knowing some
thing important about these ide
als. I first aroused Harwood's ire
with the astounding assertion
that apartheid in South Africa
was unjust as was the policy of
genocide practiced by several
political/economic elites in Cen
tral America against peasants and
Indians. Would Harwood justify
our support for the perpetrators
of these outrages on the basis of
anti-communism? Would he
explain American adventurism
in Central America as a response
to Soviet adventurism despite
the fact that we began more than
a half century before the Russian
Revolution? I'm willing to bet he
would.
