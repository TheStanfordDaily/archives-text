## Kennedy clouding issue 
### 
The research proposal to the Stanford Syn
chrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) which in
cludes work related to the nuclear weapons
program has raised some difficult issues for the
University. It is unfortunate that it has proved
so hard to have an open discussion of those
questions. Too often the discussion is de
flected by the raising of false issues, and the
main questions are not discussed.
So it is with University President Donald
Kennedy's most recent statement about the
proposal (Daily, July 22) where he again makes
the claim that the main issue here is one of
academic freedom. He notes that a Stanford
faculty member is listed as the principal inves
tigator on the project, and the proposal "is thus
clearly in the same category as other
investigator-initiated research projects."
Now, Donald Kennedy is surely in a position
to know that this proposal was submitted with
out the involvement of a single member of the
Stanford faculty. Let me state that again: the
proposal was not initiated by nor collaborated
in by any Stanford faculty member. Of course,
in that form it did not meet the guidelines for
sponsored research, and so Artie Bienenstock
agreed to have his name added as principal
investigator. But he was in no way the initiator
of the proposal, and his involvement is entirely
ex post facto. Consequently, his academic
freedom is in no way an issue here. Kennedy's
assertion is simply wrong on the facts.
Kennedy also makes the statement that there
are many kinds of work listed in the proposal,
"most of them having nothing whatever to do
with nuclear weapons or testing." The proposal
was 80 percent funded by the weapons test
division of Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, with funds from the military appli
cations division of the Department of Energy.
The senior collaborators from Livermore gave a
colloquium recently at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center CSLAC) at which *h«y di*cu»-
sed their proposed research program. They
stated that their work was primarily related to
the nuclear weapons program. The Livermore
group is the predominant group in the collab
oration, and we may reasonably conclude that,
when the time comes to make scheduling deci
sions, they will carry considerable weight.
One is reminded of an occasion in the '60s
when then-Secretary of State Dean Rusk was
attempting once again to explain to a congres
sional audience what the United States was
doing in Indochina. Sen. Clifford Case of New
Jersey was heard to say: "Secretary Rusk is no
dope: why does he keep on saying this?"

Donald Kennedy is no dope either. Why does
he keep reverting to specious arguments about
academic freedom?
In the case of Dean Rusk, it was that if he dealt
openly and honestly with the reasons the Un
ited States was doing what it was doing, it
would have involved a radical critique of the
whole thrust of U.S. foreign policy. If he had
gone that route, he would have been promptly
ejected from the government and would have
found himself treated as a pariah by his entire
peer group. So, perhaps, with Donald Ken
nedy.
Stanford University embarked on a course in
the 1940s which has led to it becoming one of
the world's great research institutions. Its fame
is most widespread in the realm of the physical
sciences. This growth has been almost entirely
funded by the federal government and in the
physical sciences it has been largely supported
by the military.
In the last 20 years, the nuclear weapons
stocks of the United States have increased from
a few thousands to several tens of thousands.
Present plans call for doubling again in the next
decade, and the nuclear weapons budget has
been radically increased. In fact, the number of
nuclear weapons in the stockpile has a doubl
ing time of about seven years. Technical people
speak of that as an exponential increase, and
such a growth curve is characteristic of a pro
cess which is self-driven, rather than one which
is responsive to an external need. An examina
tion of the literature of strategic analysis, and
much of that devoted to arms control, leads to
the same conclusion: the nuclear weapons sys
tem drives itself, and is not responsive to any
real national security needs. Much of this ar
cane literature serves only to supply a mystique
to hide the truth.
These truths are now more and more enter
ing the general social consciousness. Increas
numhor. oi people are coming to see that
continued collaboration with pernicious
militarism is not possible. For its own protec
tion as an institution, the University must con
sider these facts.
Donald Kennedy says that "academic free
dom really means freedom of inquiry." Surely it
means much more than that. Freedom to in
quire is a first step, but there is also the freedom
to assert, the freedom to oppose and the free
dom to develop a way of living which is an
alternative to social policies which are destruc
tive.
