# University apologizes to McCloskey
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
Provost Albert Hastorf has
strongly attacked the ASSU and
the Guest Professorship Board
for their handling of former
Congressman Paul "Pete"
McCloskey's spring quarter
political science class.
Following a political science
department review of the con- (
troversy surrounding the
course, Hastorf formally
apologized to McCloskey Wed
nesday and warned the ASSU
Senate that academic credit will
not be granted for future guest
professor classes unless the
GPB's bylaws are changed.
In the department's report,
professors David Danelski,
Robert Horn and Heinz Eulau
concluded that the CPB and the
ASSU's Council of Presidents
"seriously misunderstood the
permissible limits of student ac
tion in instructional matters in
the University" and "went be
yond the traditional limits of
student participation in instruc
tional matters and in the process
abridged academic freedom."
The controversy over
McCloskey's guest professor
ship here began winter quarter
with arguments over whether he
would the use the class as a vehi
cle for promoting his views on
Israel that some senators called
anti-Semitic. Later, then GPB

Chairman Seth Linfield made ef
forts to control portions of
McCloskey's reading list and
choice of guest lecturers for the
three-unit course.

ASSU graduate senator Jim
McGrath said Wednesday that
the senate will release no official
statement on Hastorf's actions
until after a meeting today with
Hastorf and Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences
Norman Wessells.
However, graduate senator
Roland Van Gaalen said that he

will introduce legislation at
Tuesday's senate meeting that
would change the GPB's bylaws
to comply with Hastorf's rec
ommendations.
"I will propose a radical revi
sion of the bylaws in order to
guarantee that future guest pro
fessors will have total academic
freedom," Van Gaalen said yes
terday. "We have to make sure
that ASSU politicos and the GPB
are in no position to harrass a
guest professor again."
Although Van Gaalen said he
thinks that the ASSU has little
choice but to rewrite the GPB's
bylaws, it is possible that the
senate will decide to abandon
having guest professors entirely
rather than bow to University
recommendations.
"As Hastorf himself pointed
out, that's definitely a possibil
ity," McGrath said. "The other
option would be complying to
tally complying to other rules
that might be mutually agree
able. But I just don't know what
the senate will decide."
Hastorf has told the ASSU that
it must drop a section of the
GPB's bylaws which states that the
GPB "will be empowered to set
academic criteria" for guest pro
fessor classes and that "with just
cause" the GPB "may take any
remedial action available to it in
cluding, but not limited to, re

voking the title of, adjusting the
salary of, or dismissing the
Guest Professor."
Hastorf said the ASSU must
also provide an appropriate Uni
versity official with a written
contract between the GPB and

the guest professor stating the
amount to paid to the guest pro
fessor. The ASSU must deposit
that amount with the University.
The appropriate University
department would then take re
sponsibility for paying the guest
professor both the salary and
administrative costs through
standard University budgetary
procedures.

Van Gaalen said that Univer
sity control over the guest pro
fessor's salary would prevent in
the future what he called the
"implicit threats" that the GPB
members made that they would
decide not to pay McCloskey
should he not follow their rec
ommendations.
Hastorf has also agreed wih
the committee's recommenda
tion that McCloskey should be
paid for more than $250 in out
of-pocket administrative ex
penses for the course, plus an
unspecified sum to make up for
a discrepancy in his actual salary
and what he was originally prom
ised for teaching the course.
McGrath has reacted angrily
to the University's handling of
the case. He said that ASSU offi
cials first saw the results of the
committee's study in Wednes
day's Campus Report.
McGrath said he will discuss
the "unprecedented" lack of
communication between the
ASSU and the University at to
day's meeting with Wessells and
Hastorf.
"There is definitely was a fail
ure in communication, but you
cannot judge as of yet that there
was failure of intent," he said.
"It could very well be that there
was an administrative slip-up,
and that would be unfortunate

Jim McGrath
. . . gets angry
but not a long-term problem. If
it's an administrative slip-up it's
one thing, but if they just didn't
care to talk to the ASSU it's
another."
McGrath said that he is un
clear as to whether Hastorf's re
quirements are final.
"If we had been involved in
the procedure throughout and
had talked to Wessells, I could
say that the provost has decided
and that's the decision. But it's
still unclear. The only thing I've

received so far is the written ma
terials," McGrath explained.
"There are some things that may
be solid or may not be. The point
is with a report the size of politi
cal science's and the complexity
of it would be impossible to
write up something" that is not
at least somewhat flexible.
The committee formed its
conclusions and made the sub
sequent recommendations after
studying the written account of
the controversy surrounding
McCloskey's political science
course on "The Congressional
Decision- Making Process,
1964-83."
