Football games and the Cotfee
House aren't the only places you
can hear Stanford music. Now
you can take the music home
with you.
Counterpoint, the Mendic
ants and the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) all put out albums
within the last few months.
LSIUMB Assistant Manager
Ben Langlotz said he was
pleased with the digitally re
corded album The Band re
leased late in spring quarter.
"We are really happy with the
album," Langlotz said, "and we
think it's as good as we could get
it."
But putting out the latest in a
long line of LSJUMB albums
wasn't easy.
"We test recorded for one
whole day and critically listened
to the sound after the testing
session," Langlotz said.
After that first day of "test re
cording" at Frost Amphitheatre
in October, The Band returned
to record for real.
"We went back and corrected
what needed to be so it wasn't
done half-assed," he said. "We
were very particular."
Audio Engineering Associates
did the actual recording, but all
other work on the record was
done by Stanford people.
The production took "a long
time," Langlotz said. While en
gineers worked on preparing
the record itself, graduate stu
dent Robert Beyers devoted
much of his time taking pictures
of The Band for the album's
cover.
Although the album cost
$10,000 to produce, Langlotz
