## Campus music groups produce albums 
### LINDA HOWELL 
Football games and the Cotfee
House aren't the only places you
can hear Stanford music. Now
you can take the music home
with you.
Counterpoint, the Mendic
ants and the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) all put out albums
within the last few months.
LSIUMB Assistant Manager
Ben Langlotz said he was
pleased with the digitally re
corded album The Band re
leased late in spring quarter.
"We are really happy with the
album," Langlotz said, "and we
think it's as good as we could get
it."
But putting out the latest in a
long line of LSJUMB albums
wasn't easy.
"We test recorded for one
whole day and critically listened
to the sound after the testing
session," Langlotz said.
After that first day of "test re
cording" at Frost Amphitheatre
in October, The Band returned
to record for real.
"We went back and corrected
what needed to be so it wasn't
done half-assed," he said. "We
were very particular."
Audio Engineering Associates
did the actual recording, but all
other work on the record was
done by Stanford people.
The production took "a long
time," Langlotz said. While en
gineers worked on preparing
the record itself, graduate stu
dent Robert Beyers devoted
much of his time taking pictures
of The Band for the album's
cover.
Although the album cost
$10,000 to produce, Langlotz


A RECORD PERFORMANCE: The Incomparable Leland Stan
ford Junior University Band released another in a long series of

Greg Webb/Daily
albums this spring. Two other campus music groups, Counter
point and the Mendicants, have also released records recently.
said that The Band should at
least break even on the
projectâ€”within two years.
The Mendicants, a 16-voice
men's singing group, recorded
their album in a very different

setting from Frost Am
phitheatre. They spent two
nights recording in the choir lott
at Memorial Church.
Although members of the
sometimes-acapella-sometimes
not group were pleased with the
original tapes for the album,
they were disappointed with the
final product.
"We were pleased with the

tapes we heard first recorded,
but the album itself is not as
good as the tapes, although the
overall sound is pretty good,"
explained Mendicants member
Steve Hubbard.
"There were a couple of songs
on the album that we weren't
pleased with. They sounded
alive on the tape, but after the
taping and the pressing of the

album the sound lost something
and seems a little dead now," he
said.
However, Hubbard hasn t
given up hope.
"Next year the potential is
there to be really good," he said.
"I would like to be able to record
an album at the end ot next
year."
But that may depend on the
success of this Mendicants al
bum.
Although it only cost the
group about $2600 to produce
1000 copies of the album, Hub
bard said he is not sure how
soon the Mendicants can expect
to recoup the expense.
He said the group hopes to
sell many copies of the record
during the Mendicants' 20th
year anniversary/reunion during
Big Game weekend in
November.
"Family, friends, alumni and
other supporters," he said, "will
especially buy this album."
Members of Counterpoint,
the female counterpart to the
Mendicants, hope their first
album will more firmly establish
the five-year-old group.
Production costs for the 500
copies of the Counterpoint
album totalled only around
$1600, but Music Director Gail
Gronert said she won't really
mind if the group doesn't make
money on the project.
"The record was made to earn
satisfaction from the music and
not to gain profit," she ex
plained.
Gronert said that with only

tour returning members, Coun
terpoint will undergo a rebuild
ing phase this year.
According to Stanford
Bookstore Sales Clerk Dean Sel
domridge, after a promising
start in spring, all three groups'
albums have sold poorly this
summer.
Seldomridge blames the slow
sales on students' lack of aware
ness of both the albums' exis
tence and the bookstore's new
record depratment location up
stairs.
However, Seldomridge said
that she does have a number of
backorders "from students all
over the country" who need a fix
of Stanford music before they
return from vacation in Septem
ber.
But while most ot Stanford's
students are away for the sum
mer, members of The Band, the
Mendicants and Counterpoint
are busy planning their activities
for next year.
The Band's Langlotz said the
LSJUMB is currently planning its
giant road trip to Champaign, Il
linois for the Cardinal's season
opener against the University of
Illinois.
The Band will also continue its
spontaneous summer concerts
whenever its members get a
"strong desire and incentive to
play," Langlotz said. And al
though the concerts are not pub
licized, Langlotz said that with
The Band's reputation for high
volume playing, "they shouldn't
be hard to hear."
