# Didactic art of Shanghai

### CHRIS MAI 
Since the May opening of
"Treasures from the Shanghai
Museum: 6000 Years of Chinese
Art," over 160,000 visitors have
come to San Francisco's Asian
Art Museum in Golden Gate
Park to see the 232 pieces loaned
by the Shanghai Museum. For
the most part, they have not
been disappointed.
The exhibition, a result of the
sister-city relationship between
Shanghai and San Francisco, is a
comprehensive review of the
past 60 centuries of Chinese art.
Present are virtually all of the
major motifs in Chinese art over
the millenia: the reverence for
nature, the evolution of a feudal
society, the practice of ancestor
worship and the fusion of the
supernatural with the mundane.
Also here are the wares familiar
to us, such as the blue and white
Ming vases, the carved red
laquer boxes and the silk scrolls,
as well as more unusual pieces,
such as a bronze axe with a
cruciform motif, stoneware pil
lows and rhinoceros horn cups.
The show itself is organized
chronologically. Its strength lies

in its didacticism, a purpose well
in accord with the image of the
traditional scholar-artist
gentleman of ancient China. The
organizers have gone to
painstaking lengths to give full
descriptions of the pieces and to
place them in their social and

historical contexts.
Displays throughout the exhi
bition give charts, maps,
chronologies, artistic and politi
cal histories, and on-site photo
graphs. Additional displays ex
plain the evolution of Bronze
Age vessel shapes and the tex
tures and strokes for calligraphy
and painting. Recorded tours
are also available at a modest fee
in English and Chinese.
Each display is labeled in both
English and Chinese, the former
in the Pinyin system, which has
supplanted the more familiar
Wade-Giles phonetics. For
example, the Ch'ing dynasty,
China's last, has been rewritten
as the Qing dynasty in Pinyin.
The exhibition starts with re
cently unearthed archaeological
finds of Neolithic Age China.
The clay containers, which al
though more than 5000 years old
are virtually unscratched, curi
ously resemble the wares o ( the
later Indian civilizations on the
American continent. The motifs
on neolithic and Bronze Age
works, we are told, prove the ac
tual existence of what were once
thought of as mythical dynasties
thousands of years ago. These
cultures, ancient even by
Chinese standards, show their
deft skill in working bronze, clay
and jade. Of special notice are
the imposing Shang (14th-11th
centuries 8.C.) three-legged
vessels.
The era of feudal lords ended
with the unification of China
under the Han dynasty in the
third century B.C. Theobsession
of the Han Chinese with man's
position in the universe and with
immortality is clear in the carv
ings on the works presented.
The subsequent Tang dynasty

(618-907 A.D.) created a three
color lead glazed ceramic. One
example of this technique is of a
female rider in foreign attire,
evidence of the cosmopolitan
nature of the empire.
Eight dynasties separated the
Tangfrom the Ming, perhapsthe
most fabled of China's art pa
trons. Artisans of this "interim"
period created what is called
"classical" Chinese ceramics.
Examples of the many glazes, as
well as of the creamy white
porcelain favored by the Sung
dynasty, predominate the next
part of the exhibit.
With the overthrow of the
foreign Mongol rulers in 1368,
the Ming dynasty established an
era which created the most

well-known pieces of Chinese
art. A clay-figurine honor guard
procession, unearthed from a
Ming tomb outside of Beijing,
dominates the Ming portion of
the exhibit. The show ends, sur
prisingly, not with works of the
Qing dynasty (1644-1911) but
with the works of contemporary
artists.
Yet the exhibition is not all di
dactic. Several of the pieces are
simply fun. In the Han dynasty
room is a "magic mirror," forged
of bronze nearly 2000 years ago,
whose image on the back of the
plate is projected onto the front
when light shines upon it. The
secret of this phenomenon has
only recently been discovered:

the cooling of the front surface
caused microscopic indenta
tions paralleling the image on
the back of the mirror.
Another piece, called the "wa
ter spurting basin," has fish
which apparently spurt water
from their mouths when the
edge of the bowl is rubbed vig
orously. Actually, the bowl
works on the principle of reso
nance: when the frequency of
vibration of the rubbing equals
the natural frequency of the
bronze bowl, then there is a
jump in energy, resulting in
what looks like the fish spurting
water. The curious can try to
work the "water spurting basin"
on a reproduction near the
exhibit's end.

The exhibition as a whole is
solid. The pieces themselves, al
though obviously priceless, are
not, however, the most impress
ive examples of Chinese art. The
Ming ceremonial procession,
for example, pales before the
thousands of life-size warriors
unearthed at Xian. And, the im
perial collections housed in the
National Museum in Taiwan are
much more awe-inspiring.
What the Shanghai exhibit
does offer, however, is a broad
survey with good examples and
informative secondary materi
als. Seeing it is much like taking
a crash course in Chinese art.
This alone makes visiting the
exhibit worthwhile.
