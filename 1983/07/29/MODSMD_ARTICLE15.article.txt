### ANDY LISAC 
It is an easy mistake: you
peruse the pink section of the
Chronicle to find the address of
Sonezone's Massa Confusa and
find it listed under theater. So
you go to the performance ex
pecting something along the
lines of modern conventional
theater, only to find there is
nothing conventional or theatri
cal about the piece, except
perhaps that it is performed in a
small theater: no plot, no
character development, no
catharsis, no theatrical conven
tions tying one scene to the next
or unifying the whole.
There are clues, of course,
which could alert the avid
theatergoer that something is
askew. The title Massa Confusa,
for instance. The theater space
itself is another clue. Behind the
liquor stores, run-down hotels
and small financial offices which
line 16th Street, one must walk
past an iron gate, through bright
fluorescent corridors, and de
scend some dark winding stairs
into a black cement anteroom
full of artists and musicians who
have abandoned their South of
Market warehouses to make this
subterranean void come alive.
Attired in baggy-yet-esthetic
secondhand clothes, these ar
tifacts wear their androgyny as a
matter of course, their striking
haircuts with as much aplomb as
a genuine Folsom Street punk,
and their airs of indifference as
naturally as the Reagan refugees
searching for food outside in the
alleyways. They are ushers, fel
low creators, and "freelance
conceptualists," as the refresh
ments boy describes himself. All

have come, like we have, on the
recommendation of friends.
Throughout the pre-theater
rituals, the prevailing atmos
phere is one of imaginative jux
taposition. In the opening, there
is a strobe light flashing to the
strains of synthesizer music. Be
tween blackouts, a figure which
looks like a mobile Izod alligator
assumes various threatening or
animated poses. As the synthe
sizer and shameless heartbeat
sound effects continue, a beau
tiful woman in ripped chiffon
garb and a Dolly Parton platinum
wig tosses around in a quaint
sleeping-beauty bed. When that
vignette runs its course, two Star
Wars figures in gold lame and
helmets construct a wooden
cage, from which appears a per
sonification of existential angst
in a skull cap and white face.
The program lists the sleeping
beauty as "Chimera, an intuitive
somnambulist," and skull cap as
"Quidnunc, the embodiment of
quididity." This bit of playful
pretentiousness has really no
bearing on the performance,
however. Quidnunc utters a
slew of fearful phrases, none of
which are actually spoken by the
performer, forall of the dialogue
save one effective scream to
ward the end of the piece is on a
soundtrack. There is a metaphor
in this, I am sure.
Quidnunc is a trapped fellow
whose demeanor rests squarely
on this fact. On stage and in the
film loops which show him skit
tering about in various desolate
locales, he affects a kind of help
less bewilderment that trans
cends his repulsive physical
traits. His bewilderment mirrors

that of the audience, both as an
audience and as a collection of
people grappling with acomplex
world outside the theater.
Chimera, on the other hand,
suggests all that is'fanciful about
Stevie Nicks: the flowing gypsy
clothes, the dreamy fantasy
world, the wistful gazes into her
full length mirror. Self-absorbed
to the point of perpetual
slumber, this creature seems to
experience only one emotion
when awake, and that is a certain
longing to make contact with the
creature (herself) on the other
side of the mirror. Again this op
erates as a metaphor for the
mirror-like barrier between au
dience and performance.
Later on we come across Dog
Boy Slim, a whale of a dog who is
beached, somewhat blissfully,
on a desert of sand. The program
notes he "dreams of swimming
but has no fins." His opening
line, "Funny, destiny can be so
surprising," evokes laughter
from an audience which has al
ready wondered how destiny
had brought them to this par
ticular locale. Slim exudes a
cheerful acceptance of a bad
fate, yet another facet of the
audience-performer paradigm.
The visual techniques are
perhaps thehighlight of the per
formance. As the various charac
ters cavort willy nilly on stage,
Sonezone has utilized dark light
ing, black-clad stage hands and
sleight of hand maneuvers with
various props to lend the per
formance an abracadabra feel
ing more appropriate to a Hal
loween piece. The film loops,
sound projections, shadow
dancing and some sophisticated

visual metaphors with mirrors
and windows all add to the sur
real atmosphere.
How, then, to critically evalu
ate this mishmash?
Traditionally the term "con
ceptual art" has been applied to
art which represents not only
what is perceived through the
senses, but also what is known
to exist. For example, a primitive
cave drawing might represent
the outline of a pregnant bear
and the embryonic cub within its
mother. Cubism is also concep
tual to the extent that artists like
Cezanne and Picasso were in
terested in representing several
incompatible views of a piece of
fruit or a human face simulta
neously.
More recently, conceptual art
has becomethe international tag
which identifies the post-1960s
artists who are interested in
creating "concepts" or ideas
rather than a physical object or
tangible product. As such, con
ceptual art has come to rely
heavily on words (since con
cepts are closely allied with lan
guage), has directed the spec
tator's attention on the creative
process itself, and has tended to
involve spectator participation.
Obviously, if a concept is to be
the goal of a production, the
elements which make up the
piece lose, for the most part,
their reverential qualities. Artists
such as Tom Curtis and Monte
Thompson of Sonezone pur
posely render their productions
uninteresting, commonplace, or
trivial to get at the "idea" they
express, and they rely not only
on what is sensually perceived,
but what is already known to

exist.
Curtis and Thompson both
told me their creative challenge
is to tread the balance between
theatrical convention and vag
ueness. "Our goal is to open
possibilities of interpretation,"
Thompson said during our
interview. But I wonder to what
extent they have overstepped
the limits of conceptual art and
opened too many possibilities.
Rather than creating trivialized
moods for the sake of concep
tualization, Sonezone has
created a miasma of garbled
ideas, meaningless words and
an atmosphere of pretentious
metaphors which intrude upon
the connecting mental pro
cesses. Stunning visual tech
niques can be appreciated for
what they are, perhaps, but an
overlay of trite music which pro
duces nothing, and hackneyed
representations of modern
angst which lead us no closer to
conceptualizing than we might
experience from riding a Muni
bus through the Haight is a
waste of time and $5 admission. I
am sorry to say it is also a waste
of the visual talent Sonezone
exhibits.
Both CurtisandThompson are
alumni of the San Francisco Art
Institute, an influential bastion
of West Coast creativity. Should
you like to rub elbows with ar
tists from this group, or formu
late your own personal opinions
on the difference between thea
ter and conceptual art, this is a
worthwhile piece to see. For
those of you who seek less de
manding fare, however, this is
not the piece for you.

secondhand clothes, these ar
tifacts wear their androgyny as a
matter of course, their striking
haircuts with as much aplomb as
a genuine Folsom Street punk,
and their airs of indifference as
naturally as the Reagan refugees
searching for food outside in the
alleyways. They are ushers, fel
low creators, and "freelance
conceptualists," as the refresh
ments boy describes himself. All

have come, like we have, on the
recommendation of friends.
Throughout the pre-theater
rituals, the prevailing atmos
phere is one of imaginative jux
taposition. In the opening, there
is a strobe light flashing to the
strains of synthesizer music. Be
tween blackouts, a figure which
looks like a mobile Izod alligator
assumes various threatening or
animated poses. As the synthe
sizer and shameless heartbeat
sound effects continue, a beau
tiful woman in ripped chiffon
garb and a Dolly Parton platinum
wig tosses around in a quaint
sleeping-beauty bed. When that
vignette runs its course, two Star
Wars figures in gold lame and
helmets construct a wooden
cage, from which appears a per
sonification of existential angst
in a skull cap and white face.
The program lists the sleeping
beauty as "Chimera, an intuitive
somnambulist," and skull cap as
"Quidnunc, the embodiment of
quididity." This bit of playful
pretentiousness has really no
bearing on the performance,
however. Quidnunc utters a
slew of fearful phrases, none of
which are actually spoken by the
performer, forall of the dialogue
save one effective scream to
ward the end of the piece is on a
soundtrack. There is a metaphor
in this, I am sure.
Quidnunc is a trapped fellow
whose demeanor rests squarely
on this fact. On stage and in the
film loops which show him skit
tering about in various desolate
locales, he affects a kind of help
less bewilderment that trans
cends his repulsive physical
traits. His bewilderment mirrors

that of the audience, both as an
audience and as a collection of
people grappling with acomplex
world outside the theater.
Chimera, on the other hand,
suggests all that is'fanciful about
Stevie Nicks: the flowing gypsy
clothes, the dreamy fantasy
world, the wistful gazes into her
full length mirror. Self-absorbed
to the point of perpetual
slumber, this creature seems to
experience only one emotion
when awake, and that is a certain
longing to make contact with the
creature (herself) on the other
side of the mirror. Again this op
erates as a metaphor for the
mirror-like barrier between au
dience and performance.
Later on we come across Dog
Boy Slim, a whale of a dog who is
beached, somewhat blissfully,
on a desert of sand. The program
notes he "dreams of swimming
but has no fins." His opening
line, "Funny, destiny can be so
surprising," evokes laughter
from an audience which has al
ready wondered how destiny
had brought them to this par
ticular locale. Slim exudes a
cheerful acceptance of a bad
fate, yet another facet of the
audience-performer paradigm.
The visual techniques are
perhaps thehighlight of the per
formance. As the various charac
ters cavort willy nilly on stage,
Sonezone has utilized dark light
ing, black-clad stage hands and
sleight of hand maneuvers with
various props to lend the per
formance an abracadabra feel
ing more appropriate to a Hal
loween piece. The film loops,
sound projections, shadow
dancing and some sophisticated

visual metaphors with mirrors
and windows all add to the sur
real atmosphere.
How, then, to critically evalu
ate this mishmash?
Traditionally the term "con
ceptual art" has been applied to
art which represents not only
what is perceived through the
senses, but also what is known
to exist. For example, a primitive
cave drawing might represent
the outline of a pregnant bear
and the embryonic cub within its
mother. Cubism is also concep
tual to the extent that artists like
Cezanne and Picasso were in
terested in representing several
incompatible views of a piece of
fruit or a human face simulta
neously.
More recently, conceptual art
has becomethe international tag
which identifies the post-1960s
artists who are interested in
creating "concepts" or ideas
rather than a physical object or
tangible product. As such, con
ceptual art has come to rely
heavily on words (since con
cepts are closely allied with lan
guage), has directed the spec
tator's attention on the creative
process itself, and has tended to
involve spectator participation.
Obviously, if a concept is to be
the goal of a production, the
elements which make up the
piece lose, for the most part,
their reverential qualities. Artists
such as Tom Curtis and Monte
Thompson of Sonezone pur
posely render their productions
uninteresting, commonplace, or
trivial to get at the "idea" they
express, and they rely not only
on what is sensually perceived,
but what is already known to

exist.
Curtis and Thompson both
told me their creative challenge
is to tread the balance between
theatrical convention and vag
ueness. "Our goal is to open
possibilities of interpretation,"
Thompson said during our
interview. But I wonder to what
extent they have overstepped
the limits of conceptual art and
opened too many possibilities.
Rather than creating trivialized
moods for the sake of concep
tualization, Sonezone has
created a miasma of garbled
ideas, meaningless words and
an atmosphere of pretentious
metaphors which intrude upon
the connecting mental pro
cesses. Stunning visual tech
niques can be appreciated for
what they are, perhaps, but an
overlay of trite music which pro
duces nothing, and hackneyed
representations of modern
angst which lead us no closer to
conceptualizing than we might
experience from riding a Muni
bus through the Haight is a
waste of time and $5 admission. I
am sorry to say it is also a waste
of the visual talent Sonezone
exhibits.
Both CurtisandThompson are
alumni of the San Francisco Art
Institute, an influential bastion
of West Coast creativity. Should
you like to rub elbows with ar
tists from this group, or formu
late your own personal opinions
on the difference between thea
ter and conceptual art, this is a
worthwhile piece to see. For
those of you who seek less de
manding fare, however, this is
not the piece for you.
It is an easy mistake: you
peruse the pink section of the
Chronicle to find the address of
Sonezone's Massa Confusa and
find it listed under theater. So
you go to the performance ex
pecting something along the
lines of modern conventional
theater, only to find there is
nothing conventional or theatri
cal about the piece, except
perhaps that it is performed in a
small theater: no plot, no
character development, no
catharsis, no theatrical conven
tions tying one scene to the next
or unifying the whole.
There are clues, of course,
which could alert the avid
theatergoer that something is
askew. The title Massa Confusa,
for instance. The theater space
itself is another clue. Behind the
liquor stores, run-down hotels
and small financial offices which
line 16th Street, one must walk
past an iron gate, through bright
fluorescent corridors, and de
scend some dark winding stairs
into a black cement anteroom
full of artists and musicians who
have abandoned their South of
Market warehouses to make this
subterranean void come alive.
