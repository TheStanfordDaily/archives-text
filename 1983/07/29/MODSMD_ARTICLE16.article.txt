# Teenage whiz kids whiz through SATs, classes

Julian Stanley, a visiting
scholar at the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences, started a program 12
years ago to identify the bright
est of youngsters in their early
teens. Each year the program
searches thousands of schools
for kids age 13 or less to find
those that are intellectually the
upper one percent of their age
group. Stanley chooses the top
one-fiftieth of one percent for
his personal study.
Identified children are pro
vided special opportunities to
allow them to learn at an in
creased pace. Weekend and
night classes are organized dur

ing the school year along with
special courses in the summer.
Stanley's top youngsters may at
tend three-week summer ses
sions equivalent to a year of var
ious high school courses.
Stanley pinpoints these chil
dren by having them take the
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT).
The initial talent search is per
formed in five regions by five
universities: lohns Hopkins,
where Stanley is a professor of
psychology, Duke, Northwest
ern, Arizona State and Denver.
Those that score either 500 on
math or 430 on verbal, or better,
are given special educational
opportunities. Stanley filters
these results for those achieving

700 or better pn math SAT.
"We are trying to find these
youngsters early enough to
move them ahead faster and bet
ter," Stanley said. "They need
more opportunities than the
usual school can give."
Stanley points out that a bright
mind can become bored when
not properly stimulated. He tries
to get the children in seventh
grade before the slow pace of
eighth grade Algebra I deadens
their interest. He has found
eighth and ninth graders have al
ready lost interest even if their
minds are sharp.
Two Pennsylvania colleges,
Franklin and Marshall College
and Dickenson College, are the

locations of two separate
three-week summer sessions for
the kids scoring 700 or better. In
one session these youngsters
take a course in any of biology,
math, chemistry, physics, mic
roeconomics and several
humanities choices. Each ses
sion has about 140 kids. Classes
are taught by former graduates
of Stanley's summer school,
people who understand the
prodigies' needs.
A "slow" child may finish only
one year of math in three weeks.
A "fast" one may complete over
four years of high school math.
Last summer at least four kids
took chemistry one term and
biology the next. They all scored
over 700 on the Achievement
Tests in both these subjects.
One 13-year-old took both at
once, finishing with perfect 800s
on both Achievement Tests.
"There were lots of other
modest results," Stanley said.
When the kids return to
school, they move up in the sub
jects studied over the summer.
They have good retention be
cause they continue in those
subjects at school. Many do not
graduate from high school but
go directly to college.
Ranjit Bhatnagar, 15, of Bur
lingame, will attend UC-
Berkeley in the fall on a Chancel
lor's Scholarship, one of only 60
offered by the University. He
scored a perfect 800 on his
chemistry achievement test and
received exceptional scores on
both sections of the SAT.

Because Stanford requires a
high school diploma, it does not
accept these students. How
ever, jay Luo, who graduated
from the University of Idaho at
age 12, has now completed a
year of graduate study in math at
Stanford at age 13. He is a
teacher at the Dickenson Col
lege program this summer.
Stanford has missed one pro
digy with a high school diploma.
Sho kuwamoto, 13, of Thousand
Oaks, will attend the CalTech
this fall.
Asked how kids of such bril
liance get along with the average
person, Stanley points out that
intelligence does not mean
maladjustment. If a child is
happy and sociable before en
tering accelerated programs, he
will be more so afterwards as his
curiosities and needs will be ful
filled. Stanley indicates that
follow-up studies show these
youngsters will have success in
all aspects of life.
Stanley organized the pro
gram for two purposes: to pro
vide a service to these extremely
bright youths, and for research.
He examines the effects of the
stress and strain of accelerated
learning, and does follow-ups
throughout the children's lives.
One interesting correlation
noticed is a relationship be
tween myopia, left-handedness,
allergies and mathematical pre
cocity.
