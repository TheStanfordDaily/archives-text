The Pat Metheny Group has
made some changes.
Guitarist Pat Metheny cut his
hippv-length hair. The group's
new drummer has an even
shorter haircut, exposing, God
forbid, his ears. And the jazz/
fusion band has added a multi
talented Brazilian to it> core.
One thing, hoover, hadn't
changed since last wear's Greek

Theater concert — the music.
Consequently, neither has the
Pat Metheny Group's status. The
quintet simply is in a class by it
self.
No band of any national prom
inence comes close to duplicat
ing Metheny's sound, a light
blend of jazz and rock. That's
because few have tried to
Xerox" the music. And that's
because few can.

The combination of
Metheny's tinkling guitar and
Lyle Mays' calm piano and syn
thesizer melodies makes for a re
laxing sound, yet one interesting
enough to listen to for two and a
half hours, the length of the
group's open-air concert last
Saturday night.
The unmatched style of music
also has the unique quality of
completely taming a crowd of

thousands. Not a sound could
be heard, not a creature was stir
ring during Metheny's acoustic
guitar or Mays' grand piano
solos. In fact, during one par
ticular solo, one of the 8000-plus
at the Creek Theater yelled en
couragement to Metheny. Im
mediately, another shout fol
lowed: "Shut up!"
As most of the show's content
was not much different than !.i>f
year's July concert, Metheny and
company remain in a kind of
limbo as to their future -ound.
After taking a longer-than-usual
break between albums, the
group returned last year with a
new LP, Off tamp, and a new
sound, one involving the in
creased use of synthesizers as
opposed to the previous inclina
tion towards acousti instru
ments.
Whether or not the quintet
would continue in the electric,
more synthesized direction was
a question that wasn't convinc
ingly answered in last year's
show. The same goes for the
1983 concert. Although one left
the '82 performance with the
idea that the group was leaning
to the synthesizer side of the
coin, the opposite was true in
one's post-concert stroll to the
car following Saturday's show.
Metheny soloed more often
with his acoustic guitar, while
rarely going to the digital delay
— <m electric guitar whose notes
are fed through a synthesizer to
give it a trumpet-like sound.
Likewise, Mays was more often
positioned in front of the con
cert grand than his maze of syn
thesizers, one of which sounds
like a harmonica.
Usually in a Pat Metheny con
cert, the best surprise is no sur
prise. One goes to hear his

music and admire his magnifi
cently unpretentious method of
playing it. But on Saturday, the
best surprise was a very unex
pected and shocking one —
vocals.
Vocals, you say? No wav, not
in a Metheny song. Horrors!
Four black, overweight sisters
from the Los Angeles area had
written lyrics to many of
Metheny's songs a few year's
ago and performed their version
of "Airstream" Saturday night.
Metheny began telling the
story of their ry like this.
I get a lot of tapes in the mail,
but they're usually from guys
who just bought their first digital
(delay system) and they want me
to, like, check it out. Well, one
dav I got this tape, put it on and !
was shocked. I mean I was
shocked."
Metheny went on to tell the
rest of the story and then invited
the four on stage to do
"Airstream," the lyrics of which
were meticulously written bv the
four sisters. There were even
words over the solos.
So on the right side of the
Creek Theater's stage was the
'ong-haired, laidback Pat
Metheny Group and on the left
side stood four big, dancing sis
ters singing a love song over a
perfectly fine instrumental tune.
Other highlights of the even
ing included dramatic synthe
sizer work by Mays during the
concert's longest song — "As
Falls Wichita. So Falls Wichita
Falls." Mays made helicopter
propeller noises sound authen
tic by starting them in the left set
of speakers and moving them
slowly to the right speakers
More than one stoned person in
the audience looked up.
