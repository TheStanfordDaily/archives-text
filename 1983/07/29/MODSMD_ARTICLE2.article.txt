Emeritus Professor of History Thomas Bailey
died Tuesday in a Menlo Park convalescent
hospital. He was 80.
Bailey retired from teaching in 1968 after a
38-year career during which he published at
least 17 books.
Bailey's 1956 history textbook The American
Pageant has become a standard in high school
and college level American history classes, sell
ing over a million copies in six editions.
Another book, The Diplomatic History of the
American People, first published in 1940, has
been used in more than 250 colleges for more
than 40 years.
When apologizing each year to students who
were forced to buy his diplomatic history book
for his class, Bailey "immodestly but truthfully
remarked. . . that if they were taking this
course at another institution, the chances were
rather good that my book would be the one
required," Bailey told Donald Stokes of the
Stanford News Service.
Bailey is survived by his wife Sylvia Dean,
their son Arthur Dean Bailey of Sunnyvale and
two grandchildren.
