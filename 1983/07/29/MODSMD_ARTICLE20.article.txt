### ERIC POSTEL 
With Bob Marley's death, the
leadership of reggae has been
handed to a coterie of five
Jamaican and English bands:
Eddy Grant (his "Electric Av
enue" is currently the No. 2
single in the United States),
Black Uhuru (with their gritty
street music), Steel Pulse (with
their soaring, melodic chants),

Musical Youth (with their teen
aged enthusiasm) and ÜB4O. UB
who?
What is a UB40? No, it's not
the code name for a military
exercise in El Salvador, nor is it
the name of a new Japanese
sports car. ÜB4O is the British
government reference number
on an unemployment benefits

card. ÜB4O is also the name of an
outstanding, but generally un
known, reggae group from En
gland. At the time of the band's
formation, most of its members
were unemployed, thus provid
ing the musicians with some in
timate experiences with that
piece of paperwork.
ÜB4O was founded five years

ago in Birmingham, England.
The band has released four al
bums since then and has had
several singles in the English
charts. Despite all that, they are
relatively unkown in America;
not because their records are
lousy, and not because Ameri
cans can't appreciate British
musicians. Their relative obscur
ity is due to the vagaries of the
music business. Whereas Eddy
Grant independently produced
his own record and then had
mammoth CBS Records distri
bute it around the expanses of
the United States, ÜB4O has in
dependently produced and dis
tributed their records.
Independent distributors do
not have access to as many retail
stores as do the conglomerates,
and they certainly don't have the
same promotion budgets. Thus,
the degree of ÜB4o's success is
underscored by saying that the
band's first single "King" was
the first single ever to reach the
English top 10 without any major
record company support. For
Americans, the end result of
these business affairs was that
we could only discover ÜB4O by
purchasing expensive, hard-to
find, import copies of the
group's English records.
Luckily, we won't have such

problems anymore. A&M re
cords has just issued the band's
first American releases, titled
1980-1983. The album features a
selection of the best cuts from
their English releases.
ÜB4o's music shares elements
of ska (as done by Madness, Fn
glish Beat, Specials, etc.), tradi
tional reggae (as done by Bob
Marley, Black Uhuru, etc.), and
dub (as done by Scientist and
other relatively unknown
bands). They combine these
elements into a blend of music
that is utterly original.
The result is music that is con
sistently mesmerizing and en
joyable. On top of the music
goes the most poignant lyrics in
reggae. When the band sings of
that "One in Ten" whose pov
erty and misery is generally ig
nored by most of the world, one
can't help but be moved. This is
one band that does know how to
combine rockin' good times
with a genuine social con
sciousness. Go see this impor
tant, up-and-coming band, o.t
its first nationwide tour, tonight
at the Keystone Palo Alto or
Saturday and Sunday in San
Francisco. I guarantee that you
will not be disappointed. Only
then will you truly know what a
ÜB4O is.
