### 
A Nous la Liberte (1931) O
Annenberg Auditorium
Rene Clair's great social satiri
cal comedy — gentle and lyrical,
but with sharp, stunning Art
Deco sets (by Lazare Meeson).
Raymond Cordy and Henri Mar
chand play prison buddies who
are reunited years later when life
has placed them on opposite
sides of the class fence: Cordy
now runs a phonograph factory
and Marchand works on the as
sembly line, like Chaplin in Mod
ern Times. (It is widely known
that Clair's film spawned Chap
lin's, but seeing it won't make
you like Modern Times any less.)
A Nous la Liberte approaches

perfection, and Georges Auric's
score is so sweetly infectious that
you find yourself humming it
months later, with not apparent
provocation. Shot (beautifully)
by Georges Perinal.
Plays Thursday evening with
Sous les Toits de Paris.
Sous Les Toits de Paris (1930)
Annenberg Auditorium C
Rene Clair made three movies
that should probably be called
masterpieces — An Italian Straw
Hat, Le Million and A Nous la
Liberte. This nostalgic musical
about love among those who sell
sheet music in the streets is a les
ser work, and it may seem slight

in comparison, as Renoir's Le
Crime de M. Lange or La Bete
Humaine does when you com
pare it with some of the other
films he made in the '30s. But it's
a lovely bauble, and when 10
years have gone by and you find
that you can still remember the
title song (by Georges Auric) and
that you've retained the image of
the Paris rooftops and the ex
traordinarily delicate feeling of
the film — which seems as sad
and faraway as a childhood
memory — you realize just how
good it is.
Plays Thursday evening with A
Nous la Liberte.

Altered States (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
Watching this movie, in which
a young scientist/professor (Wil
liam Hurt) experiments with LSD
and Mexican mushrooms in an
attempt to regress to the primal
state from which man has
evolved, one is struck by its weird
time warp quality: who would
want to make an acid movie in
1981? Ken Russell directed this
terrible picture in his usual flam
boyant, visually unimaginative
style; Paddy Chayefsky adapted
the script — a cross between
1950s sci-fi and an adolescent's
interpretation of Carlos Cas
taneda — from his own novel.
(He employs the pseudonym
"Sidney Aaron.")
Plays Sunday evening.
Coup de Torchon
New Varsity, Palo Alto; Fox,
Redwood City
In French colonial Africa in the
'30s, a local cop (that resolute,
dreary actor Philippe Noiret) fi
nally gets so sick of the penny
ante villainy and cruelty around
him that he turns killer. Bernard
Tavernier's movie progresses
from the morally questionable to
the morally repellent, and as it
gets uglier it also grows more
opaque. But some people seem
convinced that Tavernier and
Jean Aurenche, who collabo
rated with him on the screenplay,
have something to say to us. With
Isabelle Huppert, Stephane Au
dran, Guy Marchand and jean-
Pierre Marielle, in a double role.
He's the only really fresh per
former, so when he pops up a
second time he's like a cool glass
of water in all this existential Afri
can heat.
Plays Wednesday with Moon
lighting (New Varsity) and with
Diabolique (Fox).

La Strada (1956) q
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Federico Fellini's most hon
ored and beloved movie. The
title means "the road," and the
story deals, superficially, with the
relationship between a travelling
strong man, Zampano (Anthony
Quinn), and an innocent waif he
adopts and brutalizes (Ciulietta
Masina). The third character in
this fable about the interplay be
tween brute torce and inno
cence, body and soul, is an ac
robat (Richard Basehart), a fool
who is also an artist. Quinn has
never been better (except
perhaps in Requiem for a
Heavyweight); Masina gives a
heartbreaking performance —
probably inspired by Lillian Gish
in Griffith's Broken Blossoms;
and Basehart, a fine, underrated
actor, is an ideal third member of
the trio. The film represents,
along with the following year's
The Nights of Cabiria, the peak of
Fellini's powers as a filmmaker,
before he began to sacrifice real
sensitivity for the patented, self
adoring kind that corrupts his
later films. Be forewarned: the
final image is a remarkably pure
expression of despair that you
won't be able to shake off when
you leave the theater.
Plays Monday with 8 1/2.

time warp quality: who would
want to make an acid movie in
1981? Ken Russell directed this
terrible picture in his usual flam
boyant, visually unimaginative
style; Paddy Chayefsky adapted
the script — a cross between
1950s sci-fi and an adolescent's
interpretation of Carlos Cas
taneda — from his own novel.
(He employs the pseudonym
"Sidney Aaron.")
Plays Sunday evening.
Coup de Torchon
New Varsity, Palo Alto; Fox,
Redwood City
In French colonial Africa in the
'30s, a local cop (that resolute,
dreary actor Philippe Noiret) fi
nally gets so sick of the penny
ante villainy and cruelty around
him that he turns killer. Bernard
Tavernier's movie progresses
from the morally questionable to
the morally repellent, and as it
gets uglier it also grows more
opaque. But some people seem
convinced that Tavernier and
Jean Aurenche, who collabo
rated with him on the screenplay,
have something to say to us. With
Isabelle Huppert, Stephane Au
dran, Guy Marchand and jean-
Pierre Marielle, in a double role.
He's the only really fresh per
former, so when he pops up a
second time he's like a cool glass
of water in all this existential Afri
can heat.
Plays Wednesday with Moon
lighting (New Varsity) and with
Diabolique (Fox).

La Strada (1956) q
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Federico Fellini's most hon
ored and beloved movie. The
title means "the road," and the
story deals, superficially, with the
relationship between a travelling
strong man, Zampano (Anthony
Quinn), and an innocent waif he
adopts and brutalizes (Ciulietta
Masina). The third character in
this fable about the interplay be
tween brute torce and inno
cence, body and soul, is an ac
robat (Richard Basehart), a fool
who is also an artist. Quinn has
never been better (except
perhaps in Requiem for a
Heavyweight); Masina gives a
heartbreaking performance —
probably inspired by Lillian Gish
in Griffith's Broken Blossoms;
and Basehart, a fine, underrated
actor, is an ideal third member of
the trio. The film represents,
along with the following year's
The Nights of Cabiria, the peak of
Fellini's powers as a filmmaker,
before he began to sacrifice real
sensitivity for the patented, self
adoring kind that corrupts his
later films. Be forewarned: the
final image is a remarkably pure
expression of despair that you
won't be able to shake off when
you leave the theater.
Plays Monday with 8 1/2.
