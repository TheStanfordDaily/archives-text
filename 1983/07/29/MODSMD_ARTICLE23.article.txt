Covert aid wins narrow victory
Washington—Proponents of President Reagan's
program of covert military assistance to Nicaraguan
rebels won a one-vote victory in the House yesterday
in a test showdown that tied any ban of the secret aid
to a reciprocal gesture by the Sandanista govern
ment.
The House tentatively agreed 214-213 to link any
halt of the CIA program to a requirement that
Nicaragua shut off its supply of weapons and supplies
guerrillas battling U.S.-backed governments in Cent
ral America.
The first of a series of decisions appeared to indicate
that the president has the strength to withstand the
first major challenge to a key element of his Central
American policy. The amendment to the proposed
ban would, in effect, leave Reagan a free hand in
helping the so-called "contras" rebels.
Intensive behind-the-screens manuevers con
tinued in an effort to sway the final outcome, in one
of the toughest battles yet between the president and
the Democratic House.
Reagan declares war on the mob
Washington—President Reagan promised a "frontal
assault on the mob in America" as he assembled a
national commission yesterday to investigate or
ganized crime and throw the spotlight of publicity on
alleged gangsters throughout the country by con
ducting region-by-region hearings.
Named as the chairman of the 20-member commission
was U.S. Circuit Court )udge Irving Kaufman of New
York, who as a federal district judge in 1952 sen
tenced convicted Soviet spies Julius and Ethel Rosen
berg to die in the electric chair for passing secrets
about the atomic bomb.
"We shall reveal the threat criminal cartels pose to
our nation's well-being," promised the 73-year-old
Kaufman. "We will recommend strategies and legisla
tion to make the business of organized crime unprof
itable."
Reagan said the group's aim is to "break and crip
ple the organized criminal syndicates that for too
long have been tolerated in America."
Other members of the commission include former
Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart; Sen. Strom
Thurmond (R-S.C.); chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee; Rep. Peter Rodino, Jr., chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee; Stanford Law School As
sociate Dean Thomas Mcßride, a former member of
the Watergate Special Prosecution Force; and several
state and local law enforcement officials.
Reagan said the commission will ask Congress for
subpoena powers as a tool for its investigation,
stretching out over three years.
Israelis promise total withdrawal
Washington—lsraeli leaders have assured the Re
agan administration that Israel's partial troop with
drawal from Lebanon will be "a step in the right

direction of the total withdrawal" of all foreign forces
from Lebanon, Secretary of State George Shultz said
yesterday.
Shultz said following a 30-minute meeting between
President Reagan and Israel's foreign and defense
ministers that the Israelis had made clear they intend
towithdrawall their forces from Lebanon eventually.
Shultz said he hopes the assurances given by
Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Defense Minis
ter Moshe Arens "will have some impact" on Syria,
which so far has refused to pull out its troups from
Lebanon.
Little detail was disclosed by Shultz or other U.S.
officials on wha was discussed with the Israelis during
marathon talks here.
A senior official, who briefed reporters on the un
derstanding he remain anonymous, said the Israelis
apparently hadn't set a date for beginning the partial
pull-out, although other sources said it is expected to
start soon.
Phalangists ordered out of S. Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon—The Israeli army ordered yester
day the closure of three Christian Phalangist militia
barracks in southern Lebanon, triggering protests by
hundreds of Christians in the region.
The decision by the Israelis to lessen the influence
of the militiamen in southern Lebanon was a major
blow to the Phalangists, who have been attempting to
expand their area of operations.
Christians in the south reportedly expressed con
cern yesterday that, without the presence of the
Phalangist militiamen, the Christian villages of the
region would be open to attack by Druze militiamen.
Christians and Druze, traditional enemies in this
country, have been fighting for months in the Shouf
mountains near Beirut despite the factthat the moun
tains are formally occupied by Israeli troops.
Now the Israelis are preparing to leave the Shouf,
redeploying to the south along the Awwali river,
which enters the Mediterranean just north of the
Lebanese port city of Sidon. Their order that the
militia bases be closed apparently was an effort to
consolidate control of their realigned zone of occu
pation.
Christians also marched yesterday afternoon on
the Israeli headquarters in the Beirut suburb of Yarze.
Agent Orange bill approved
Washington—A bill that for the first time would
compensate some Vietnam veterans for disabilities
linked to the herbicide Agent Orange was approved
by a House subcommittee yesterday despite oppo
sition from the Veterans Administration.
The narrowly drawn measure offers the prospect of
disability benefits only to an estimated 3000 to 4000
veterans suffering from three disorders that have
been traced in some studies to exposure to dioxin, a
toxic contaminant of the herbicide.
Compensation would be available only to former
servicemen who contract soft-tissue sarcoma, a rare
form of cancer, within 20 years of their departure

from Southeast Asia.
It also would apply to those who, within a year of
leaving the battle area, came down with porphyria
cutanea tarda (PCT), a liver and blood condition.
Rep. Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.), the bill's chief sup
porter, said that although relatively few veterans
would be eligible for benefits, "this bill establishes a
pretty good precedent" for Congress to expand
compensation later to cover victims of other diseases
presumably caused by Agent Orange.
The House Veterans Affairs subcommittee on
compensation approved the bill on a 7-4 vote, with all
votes in favor cast by Democrats and all opposed by
Republicans.
The Veterans Administration said it opposed the
measure on the ground that more research must be
done before conclusions can be reached about
whether exposure to Agent Orange damaged the
health of ground troops in Vietnam. The major vete
ran's groups support the bill.
National Public Radio survives
Washington—National Public Radio averted immi
nent bankruptcy yesterday by negotiating an "agree
ment in principle" on a survival loan from the Corpo
ration for Public Broadcasting that will keep NPR's
news and cultural programming on the air.
The agreement, hammered out by executives of
the organizations during a marathon bargaining ses
sion lasting nearly 12 hours, sidestepped the trouble
some issue of loan collateral by providing for transfer
of title to NPR's satellite equipment to three public
trustees.
Because final details of the accord probably won't
be settled until Tuesday, officials said, the corpora
tion already had transferred $500,000 to NPR so it can
meet its payroll today.
Assuming no snags develop before papers are
signed Tuesday, NPR, the national programming arm
for U.S. public radio stations, will be able to start
using an $8.5 million line of credit from CPB next
week.
The network's board quickly ratified the accord
yesterday morning. Directors of CPB, the indepen
dent body created by Congress to disburse federal
funds for public radio and television, followed suit
yesterday afternoon.
CPB had insisted that NPR transfer title to the cor
poration to a small group of stations, to protect the
network against creditors should it default on the
loan or declare bankruptcy.
NPR balked, saying that a title transfer was un
necessary and would amount to a reorganization of
the network's 281 member stations.
The stalemate was broken when both organiza
tions agreed that three public trustees would hold
title to the equipment in behalf of NPR and its sta
tions.

Reagan declares war on the mob
Washington—President Reagan promised a "frontal
assault on the mob in America" as he assembled a
national commission yesterday to investigate or
ganized crime and throw the spotlight of publicity on
alleged gangsters throughout the country by con
ducting region-by-region hearings.
Named as the chairman of the 20-member commission
was U.S. Circuit Court )udge Irving Kaufman of New
York, who as a federal district judge in 1952 sen
tenced convicted Soviet spies Julius and Ethel Rosen
berg to die in the electric chair for passing secrets
about the atomic bomb.
"We shall reveal the threat criminal cartels pose to
our nation's well-being," promised the 73-year-old
Kaufman. "We will recommend strategies and legisla
tion to make the business of organized crime unprof
itable."
Reagan said the group's aim is to "break and crip
ple the organized criminal syndicates that for too
long have been tolerated in America."
Other members of the commission include former
Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart; Sen. Strom
Thurmond (R-S.C.); chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee; Rep. Peter Rodino, Jr., chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee; Stanford Law School As
sociate Dean Thomas Mcßride, a former member of
the Watergate Special Prosecution Force; and several
state and local law enforcement officials.
Reagan said the commission will ask Congress for
subpoena powers as a tool for its investigation,
stretching out over three years.
Israelis promise total withdrawal
Washington—lsraeli leaders have assured the Re
agan administration that Israel's partial troop with
drawal from Lebanon will be "a step in the right

direction of the total withdrawal" of all foreign forces
from Lebanon, Secretary of State George Shultz said
yesterday.
Shultz said following a 30-minute meeting between
President Reagan and Israel's foreign and defense
ministers that the Israelis had made clear they intend
towithdrawall their forces from Lebanon eventually.
Shultz said he hopes the assurances given by
Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Defense Minis
ter Moshe Arens "will have some impact" on Syria,
which so far has refused to pull out its troups from
Lebanon.
Little detail was disclosed by Shultz or other U.S.
officials on wha was discussed with the Israelis during
marathon talks here.
A senior official, who briefed reporters on the un
derstanding he remain anonymous, said the Israelis
apparently hadn't set a date for beginning the partial
pull-out, although other sources said it is expected to
start soon.
Phalangists ordered out of S. Lebanon
Beirut, Lebanon—The Israeli army ordered yester
day the closure of three Christian Phalangist militia
barracks in southern Lebanon, triggering protests by
hundreds of Christians in the region.
The decision by the Israelis to lessen the influence
of the militiamen in southern Lebanon was a major
blow to the Phalangists, who have been attempting to
expand their area of operations.
Christians in the south reportedly expressed con
cern yesterday that, without the presence of the
Phalangist militiamen, the Christian villages of the
region would be open to attack by Druze militiamen.
Christians and Druze, traditional enemies in this
country, have been fighting for months in the Shouf
mountains near Beirut despite the factthat the moun
tains are formally occupied by Israeli troops.
Now the Israelis are preparing to leave the Shouf,
redeploying to the south along the Awwali river,
which enters the Mediterranean just north of the
Lebanese port city of Sidon. Their order that the
militia bases be closed apparently was an effort to
consolidate control of their realigned zone of occu
pation.
Christians also marched yesterday afternoon on
the Israeli headquarters in the Beirut suburb of Yarze.
Agent Orange bill approved
Washington—A bill that for the first time would
compensate some Vietnam veterans for disabilities
linked to the herbicide Agent Orange was approved
by a House subcommittee yesterday despite oppo
sition from the Veterans Administration.
The narrowly drawn measure offers the prospect of
disability benefits only to an estimated 3000 to 4000
veterans suffering from three disorders that have
been traced in some studies to exposure to dioxin, a
toxic contaminant of the herbicide.
Compensation would be available only to former
servicemen who contract soft-tissue sarcoma, a rare
form of cancer, within 20 years of their departure

from Southeast Asia.
It also would apply to those who, within a year of
leaving the battle area, came down with porphyria
cutanea tarda (PCT), a liver and blood condition.
Rep. Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.), the bill's chief sup
porter, said that although relatively few veterans
would be eligible for benefits, "this bill establishes a
pretty good precedent" for Congress to expand
compensation later to cover victims of other diseases
presumably caused by Agent Orange.
The House Veterans Affairs subcommittee on
compensation approved the bill on a 7-4 vote, with all
votes in favor cast by Democrats and all opposed by
Republicans.
The Veterans Administration said it opposed the
measure on the ground that more research must be
done before conclusions can be reached about
whether exposure to Agent Orange damaged the
health of ground troops in Vietnam. The major vete
ran's groups support the bill.
National Public Radio survives
Washington—National Public Radio averted immi
nent bankruptcy yesterday by negotiating an "agree
ment in principle" on a survival loan from the Corpo
ration for Public Broadcasting that will keep NPR's
news and cultural programming on the air.
The agreement, hammered out by executives of
the organizations during a marathon bargaining ses
sion lasting nearly 12 hours, sidestepped the trouble
some issue of loan collateral by providing for transfer
of title to NPR's satellite equipment to three public
trustees.
Because final details of the accord probably won't
be settled until Tuesday, officials said, the corpora
tion already had transferred $500,000 to NPR so it can
meet its payroll today.
Assuming no snags develop before papers are
signed Tuesday, NPR, the national programming arm
for U.S. public radio stations, will be able to start
using an $8.5 million line of credit from CPB next
week.
The network's board quickly ratified the accord
yesterday morning. Directors of CPB, the indepen
dent body created by Congress to disburse federal
funds for public radio and television, followed suit
yesterday afternoon.
CPB had insisted that NPR transfer title to the cor
poration to a small group of stations, to protect the
network against creditors should it default on the
loan or declare bankruptcy.
NPR balked, saying that a title transfer was un
necessary and would amount to a reorganization of
the network's 281 member stations.
The stalemate was broken when both organiza
tions agreed that three public trustees would hold
title to the equipment in behalf of NPR and its sta
tions.

Covert aid wins narrow victory
Washington—Proponents of President Reagan's
program of covert military assistance to Nicaraguan
rebels won a one-vote victory in the House yesterday
in a test showdown that tied any ban of the secret aid
to a reciprocal gesture by the Sandanista govern
ment.
The House tentatively agreed 214-213 to link any
halt of the CIA program to a requirement that
Nicaragua shut off its supply of weapons and supplies
guerrillas battling U.S.-backed governments in Cent
ral America.
The first of a series of decisions appeared to indicate
that the president has the strength to withstand the
first major challenge to a key element of his Central
American policy. The amendment to the proposed
ban would, in effect, leave Reagan a free hand in
helping the so-called "contras" rebels.
Intensive behind-the-screens manuevers con
