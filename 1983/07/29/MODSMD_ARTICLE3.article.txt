# Police hunt for backpack thieves

### BRYCE LEE 
Stanford police are looking for
two suspects who they believe
are responsible for a "crime
wave" of petty thefts on campus.
Police believe that the two
suspects—a clean-shaven black
man in his early 20s and a
bearded black man, also in his
early 20s—are responsible for at
least five thefts of money from
purses and backpacks at the Law
School and other parts of cam
pus.
Using a mug-shot file, police
have positively identified the
first suspect, a man they said has
a previous criminal record in
volving petty thefts.
There is also speculation that
one of the suspects is a heroin

addict who steals to support his
habit.
According to police, most of
the thefts have occurred at the
Law School where the thief has
rummaged through backpacks
in search of money.
Police officials said they are
taking the petty thefts very seri
ously.
"There really is a big effort (to
apprehend the suspects) since
this really is the first crime wave
to hit Stanford," a police
spokesman said.
He advised students to "keep
wallets and valuables in sight"
when studying in public places
and to lock their rooms before
going out.
