# Stanford protesters block weapons station

### TIM GRIEVE 
Hundreds of protesters — in
cluding many from the Stanford
community — flocked to Con
cord this week to attempt a
blockade of the Naval Weapons
Station to protest U.S. involve
ment in Central America.
Stern Hall Residence Adminis
trator Victoria Baker was among
those who were arrested for
their attempts to "disrupt busi
ness as usual" at the take-off
point for munitions shipments
headed for El Salvador.
"It's real frustrating to realize
lhat my name and money are
being used for murder," Baker
said last night. "I'll do what I can
'o stop it and if that means put
ting my body on the line, there's
no question that's what I'll do."
Baker said that she chose to

practice civil disobedience at the
weapons station after three
years o< work in the accepted
legal channels to change the Re
agan administration's Central
American policies.
"I've spent three years work
ing on educational programs,
showing films and sitting at liter
ature tables and I know for a fact
that the American people don't
support the action of this man.
My only alternative now is to
commit civil disobedience and
start escalating my own action.
There are people all over the Bay
Area, all over the country and all
over the world who are standing
up and saying we have to stop
this. I'm standing up with
them

Central America.
week. Monday she was taken to
the Contra Costa County Cor
rectional Facility and released
after a few hours. She was ar
rested again Tuesday and re
leased Wednesday afternoon
with a number of other protes
ters who police did not want to
crowd the jail.
Other protesters were held
Imtil yesterday morning, when
all but one pleaded no contest
and were released after a judge
sentenced them to the time they
had already served.
Stanford student Doug Spald
i ing also participated in the Con
cord protest. He said he wasn't
■ arrested because he didn't actu
ally try to block anyone from get
; ting into the station and there
- fore was never in "the arrest po
f. sition."
| "Our overall purpose was to
halt arms shipments and thereby
; halt U.S. involvement by form
ing a land and sea blockade
around the station."
Spalding said that although
the Concord protest hasn't
stopped U.S. involvement in
Central America yet, it has
drawn more attention to the
growing numbers of people who
disagree with Reagan's policies.
"I have to say that 100 people
standing out on roads aren't
going to do it. But it inconveni
enced the workers and made
them think. It's a nuisance and
it's consciousness raising. It
might ultimately get Reagan's
policy changed."
Baker said that unlike some of
the violent protests during the
Vietnam era, both protesters
and police were peaceful in
Concord this week.
"The police didn't use un
necessary force or treat us like

pigs or subhumans. By doing
that, they kept the panic to a
minimum."
Stanford student Paul
Hodgdon also participated in
the protest. He said he watched
a Vietnam veteran tell a Marine
protecting the station about Vie
tnam and his work after the war
in a factory that produced
napalm. When he told the
Marine about pictures he saw of
children hit by napalm, the vete
ran cried.
"He put his face on the pave
ment and wept and wept."
Spalding said the confronta
tions between the protesters
and the workers trying to get
past the blockades presented
"quite a scenario."
"It always comes to a philo
sophical standpoint. A worker
drives up, honks his horn, ac
celerates a few times and says he
has a right to go to work. But the
protesters are saying 'I can't let
you go to work.' It's an emo
tional response."
Baker said that some of the
workers reacted in a "danger
ous" way.
"They would drive up at 20
miles an hour and come this
close to us."
She held her hands six inches
apart.
But Baker said she sym
pathizes with the people who
work at the naval station and the
Marines who must protect the
station from the protesters.
"I have a lot of sympathy for
the people there. They need
their jobs and we're calling their
personal lives into question. But
we're doing it for them, too.
They (the Marines) will be sent
down there to die. I won't be."
