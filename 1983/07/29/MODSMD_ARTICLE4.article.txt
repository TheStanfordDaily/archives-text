### TIM GRIEVE 
Hundreds of protesters — in
cluding many from the Stanford
community — flocked to Con
cord this week to attempt a
blockade of the Naval Weapons
Station to protest U.S. involve
ment in Central America.
Stern Hall Residence Adminis
trator Victoria Baker was among
those who were arrested for
their attempts to "disrupt busi
ness as usual" at the take-off
point for munitions shipments
headed for El Salvador.
"It's real frustrating to realize
lhat my name and money are
being used for murder," Baker
said last night. "I'll do what I can
'o stop it and if that means put
ting my body on the line, there's
no question that's what I'll do."
Baker said that she chose to

practice civil disobedience at the
weapons station after three
years o< work in the accepted
legal channels to change the Re
agan administration's Central
American policies.
"I've spent three years work
ing on educational programs,
showing films and sitting at liter
ature tables and I know for a fact
that the American people don't
support the action of this man.
My only alternative now is to
commit civil disobedience and
start escalating my own action.
There are people all over the Bay
Area, all over the country and all
over the world who are standing
up and saying we have to stop
this. I'm standing up with
them
