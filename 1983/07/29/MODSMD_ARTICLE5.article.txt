# Severe corn shortage for Zimbabwe's next harvest
## 
### 
Harare, Zimbabwe—Zimbabwe, re
garded as the granary of black Africa just
two years ago before the onset of the
worst drought in its history, will have only
a two-week supply of corn, the staple
food, remaining by the time of the next
harvest, according to the head of the
country's major farmers' organization.
The southern African nation will have
only 50,000 tons of corn in stock—half of
what is consumed each month—by the
end of next March, when the next harvest
is due, said Jim Sinclair, president of the
Commercial Farmers' Union, speaking
Wednesday at the organization's annual
meeting.
Agriculture Minister Dennis Norman,
who visited the United States last month
to seek food aid, acknowledged the accu
racy of the figures, the first time the prob
lem has been outlined so drastically in
public. He said, however, the normally
food-rich country would have enough
corn to avoid the embarrassment of hav
ing to import.
Norman said the drought, unrest in the
southwestern province of Matabeleland
and fluctuations in farm prices and inter
est rates have brought agriculture, the
mainstay of the economy, to a "low ebb."
Western diplomats regard a successful
Zimbabwe as a key to the future of
mineral-rich but economically poor
southern Africa.
Today's meeting of the predominantly
white Farmer's Union was addressed by

six cabinet minsters, many of whom came
under sharp criticism over government
policy. Although the atmosphere of the
conference was friendlier than the four
previous ones since black rule began in
1980, farmers complained angrily about
violence on white-owned farms in the
province of Matabeleland and de
nounced government plans to force
some white farmers to sell their land for
the resettlement of black peasants.
The situation in Matabereland, where
16 farmers or members of their families
have been killed this year by dissidents
opposed to the government of Prime
Minister Robert Mugabe, was the subject
of two closed meetings with Emmerson
Munangagwa, the minister responsible
for security.
The killing of farmers by dissidents
"has had a devastating effect not only on
the morale of farmers but also on their
confidence in the security forces to pro
tect them," one landowner said.
More than half of the farmland in the
province is reportedly up for sale because
of the violence. It is believed that more
than 1000 black civilians have been killed
as a result of army retaliation against the
dissidents. After Wednesday's meeting,
Munangagwa conferred with Mugabe.
Many of the 5000 white farmers, who
produce the bulk of the food in the coun
try, are concerned over the shift in gov
ernment land-acquisition policy an
nounced by Moven Mahachi, the minis

ter of land, resettlement and rural devel
opment.
"Compulsory measures will be used to
achieve consolidation of blocks of land in
areas where some landowners refuse to
offer their land for sale to government
voluntarily," Mahachi said.
Until now, the 5 million acres bought
by the government for resettlement of
peasants has been acquired on the basis
of "willing buyer, willing seller."
Mahachi criticized "the attitude of cer
tain landowners who. . .persistently
harass the officials in my ministry" over
leasing of state land and said, therefore,
that the process would stop.
He said the government's socialist pol
icy sought to "convert the land own
ership and tenure system from private
ownership and uncontrolled land use
permitting a high degree of exploitation
of man by man, to either produce
cooperatives or state farms." In addition,
he said the remaining private holdings
must be deduced in size but production
must also be increased.
At the same time, Mahachi said he
wished to "reassure farmers that the gov
ernment has no intention of disrupting
the success of the commercial sector of
agriculture."
Responding to Mahachi's announce
ment, Sinclair said the government was in
effect saying, "If you're not a willing sel
ler, we'll make you one."

"The feeling of insecurity felt by the
commercial farmers engendered b\
rhetoric and statements that his tenure is
in doubt, all have a debilitating effect,
Sinclair said.
"Put a comercial farming operator with
secure tenure against any other system
and he will out-perform the other system
all the time," he added. "I know that in
many corners that statement will be chal
lenged. All I can say is that world experi
ence shows that if a man owns his land
and expends his own blood over working
and developing it, he will make it profit."
Food self-sufficiency, built up over
years of white rule, is a sensitive political
issue in Zimbabwe.
"Zimbabwe will be the last, if ever, Af
rican state to face famine," Dawson
Sanyangore, director of social services,
said recently in an interview with The
Herald, the country's main daily newspa
per. "We are far from it."
At that very time Norman was in Wash
ington seeking food aid.
The next day a government spokesman
did an abrupt about-face, saying that
"statement is not in accord with a true
state of affairs. . . It is true that Zimbabwe
is one of the countries threatened with
famine."

who visited the United States last month
to seek food aid, acknowledged the accu
racy of the figures, the first time the prob
lem has been outlined so drastically in
public. He said, however, the normally
food-rich country would have enough
corn to avoid the embarrassment of hav
ing to import.
Norman said the drought, unrest in the
southwestern province of Matabeleland
and fluctuations in farm prices and inter
est rates have brought agriculture, the
mainstay of the economy, to a "low ebb."
Western diplomats regard a successful
Zimbabwe as a key to the future of
mineral-rich but economically poor
southern Africa.
Today's meeting of the predominantly
white Farmer's Union was addressed by

six cabinet minsters, many of whom came
under sharp criticism over government
policy. Although the atmosphere of the
conference was friendlier than the four
previous ones since black rule began in
1980, farmers complained angrily about
violence on white-owned farms in the
province of Matabeleland and de
nounced government plans to force
some white farmers to sell their land for
the resettlement of black peasants.
The situation in Matabereland, where
16 farmers or members of their families
have been killed this year by dissidents
opposed to the government of Prime
Minister Robert Mugabe, was the subject
of two closed meetings with Emmerson
Munangagwa, the minister responsible
for security.
The killing of farmers by dissidents
"has had a devastating effect not only on
the morale of farmers but also on their
confidence in the security forces to pro
tect them," one landowner said.
More than half of the farmland in the
province is reportedly up for sale because
of the violence. It is believed that more
than 1000 black civilians have been killed
as a result of army retaliation against the
dissidents. After Wednesday's meeting,
Munangagwa conferred with Mugabe.
Many of the 5000 white farmers, who
produce the bulk of the food in the coun
try, are concerned over the shift in gov
ernment land-acquisition policy an
nounced by Moven Mahachi, the minis

ter of land, resettlement and rural devel
opment.
"Compulsory measures will be used to
achieve consolidation of blocks of land in
areas where some landowners refuse to
offer their land for sale to government
voluntarily," Mahachi said.
Until now, the 5 million acres bought
by the government for resettlement of
peasants has been acquired on the basis
of "willing buyer, willing seller."
Mahachi criticized "the attitude of cer
tain landowners who. . .persistently
harass the officials in my ministry" over
leasing of state land and said, therefore,
that the process would stop.
He said the government's socialist pol
icy sought to "convert the land own
ership and tenure system from private
ownership and uncontrolled land use
permitting a high degree of exploitation
of man by man, to either produce
cooperatives or state farms." In addition,
he said the remaining private holdings
must be deduced in size but production
must also be increased.
At the same time, Mahachi said he
wished to "reassure farmers that the gov
ernment has no intention of disrupting
the success of the commercial sector of
agriculture."
Responding to Mahachi's announce
ment, Sinclair said the government was in
effect saying, "If you're not a willing sel
ler, we'll make you one."

"The feeling of insecurity felt by the
commercial farmers engendered b\
rhetoric and statements that his tenure is
in doubt, all have a debilitating effect,
Sinclair said.
"Put a comercial farming operator with
secure tenure against any other system
and he will out-perform the other system
all the time," he added. "I know that in
many corners that statement will be chal
lenged. All I can say is that world experi
ence shows that if a man owns his land
and expends his own blood over working
and developing it, he will make it profit."
Food self-sufficiency, built up over
years of white rule, is a sensitive political
issue in Zimbabwe.
"Zimbabwe will be the last, if ever, Af
rican state to face famine," Dawson
Sanyangore, director of social services,
said recently in an interview with The
Herald, the country's main daily newspa
per. "We are far from it."
At that very time Norman was in Wash
ington seeking food aid.
The next day a government spokesman
did an abrupt about-face, saying that
"statement is not in accord with a true
state of affairs. . . It is true that Zimbabwe
is one of the countries threatened with
famine."
