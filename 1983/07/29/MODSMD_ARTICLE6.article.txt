# Goal of U.S. military presence in Honduras is seen to protect country and to calm Central American fears

Tegucigalpa, Honduras—A major aim of the rapidly es
calating U.S. military presence in and around Honduras
is to provide a protective shield for this country as U.S.-
backed rebel forces operating along the border with
neighboring Nicaragua expand their efforts to over
throw the Sandinista government there, according to
senior U.S. and Honduran military officials.
Gen. Gustavo Alvarez, commander of the Honduran
armed forces, said Tuesday night in an interview that the
scheduled arrival of as many as 4000 U.S. troops for joint
maneuvers in Honduras in the next few months and a
small flotilla of warships off each coast of the Central
American isthmus should "dissuade" the Nicaraguans
from making any overt move against Honduras.
U.S. officials said a function of the U.S. troop pre
sence also is to calm Honduran worries and thus avoid
any rash action by the Honduran military as border ten
sions increase. As one source close to Gen. Alvarez put
it, the U.S. presence should "confine the ball game to
Nicaragua itself."
Alvarez was careful to deny the well-documented pre
sence of the rebels' camps inside Honduras but warned
that if—"out of desperation"—the Sandinistas attacked
Honduras, their incursion "would be smashed."
The Honduran commander added, however, any re
sponse by his troops would be "very prudent" and "rea
sonable."
"We do not want to fall into an escalation of violence
with Nicaragua. We do not want to provoke a war with
Nicaragua," Alvarez said.
The complex calculations that appeared to surround
recent Reagan adminstration decisions to raise the visi
ble role of the United States in Central America reflect
still persistent difficulties in judging the behavior of
Washington's friends as well as its foes in the region.
In the last few weeks, Alvarez has emerged as one of
the most controversial and important players of the cur
rent drama.
Alvarez's powerful position, his anticommunist con
victions and his blunt talk have led Nicaraguan leaders,
including Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto, to warn the
United States is "creating a monster" by giving the Hon
duran commander ever greater military force.

The general's backers, including Honduras' elected
president, Roberto Suazo Cordova, picture him as a
capable, charismatic defender of a developing democra
tic government in this country and of democratic values
in the region as a whole.
But even some U.S. military officials who know him
and like him suggest he and other members of the Hon
duran high command could overcommit their forces in
the fight against Nicaragua and should not be allowed to
force the commmitment of U.S. troops.
As one military officer visiting this capital said re
cently, "I'm not sure you want to tell the Hondurans
you're going to back them 100 percent." Some of them
the officer said, "do have delusions of grandeur," some
"do think they could take them" referring to the San
dinistas.
In a lengthy interview Tuesday night, Alvarez showed
both his potential for military moderation and his fierce
ideological opposition to communist influence in the
region.
"Everything you do to destroy a Marxist regime is
moral," Alvarez said as he concluded his conversation
with reporters.
The general called the Nicaraguan "counter
revolutionaries" fighting the Managua government "the
cheapest and most just" means of resolving Central
America's crisis.
Alvarez suggested, however, the best way to see the
Sandinistas removed from power would be through
elections.
The general has long-standing personal ties with at
least one of the top leaders of the Nicaraguan anti-
Sandinista rebels. Former Nicaraguan National Guard
major Emilio Echaverri, now the chief of staff of the
Nicaraguan Democratic Force, was a classmate of Al
varez when they studied at the national military academy
of Argentina in the late 19505.
Although Alvarez consistently has denied Honduras
gives direct support to the anti-Sandinista rebels, he said
last night that the U.S. Congress should do so.
"While a Marxist government exists in Nicaragua
problems are going to continue," Alvarez said. The re
bels "are the cheapest solution we have."

Alvarez said the negotiations that other Latin Ameri
can nations are trying to further under the auspices of
the four-nation Contadora group could be effective in
bringing about what he considers to be necessary
changes in the Nicaraguan government.
But, he added, "I asked myslef when a negotiation
with the communists has been to the advantage of the
West."
Alvarez took as an example the Paris peach talks with
Vietnam conducted by Henry Kissinger, suggesting
that the former secretary ot state essentially gave away
all of Southeast Asia.
"Is that negotiation?" asked Alvarez. "That is not
negotiation."
Asked how he felt about Kissinger's appointment as
head of a new bipartisan commission on Central
America policy, Alvarez said, "I hope for the good of
Central America that this is his lucky moment."
Alvarez said the Sandinistas and Salvadoran rebels are
only willing to negotiate now because they are "losing."
"When communists are winning they say, 'Victory or
death," Alvarez commented. "When they are losing
they say they will negotiate."
But the general said that under the present circum
stances, "I am very optimistic. We are going to win the
battle against communism." He added that current ac
tions "are guaranteeing that Central America is going to
be part of the West."
The greatest worry of Honduras in the four years since
the Sandinistas took power in Nicaragua, Alvarez said,
has been the fear of domestic subversion inspired by
Nicaragua.
He added he does not believe the Sandinistas want to
make war openly on his country under any circum
stances but prefer instead to use what he called "dirty
and cowardly" tactics.
During an interview Tuesday evening and earlier dur
ing a visit to a new U.S.-funded training facility at Puerto
Castilla, Alvarez said the Reagan adminstration's public
commitment to the fight against communist expansion
in the hemisphere has helped dispel his government's
worries about both covert and overt operations against
it.
