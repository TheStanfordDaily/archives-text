## Nixon, Haig and Ford: Monsters in seats of power 
### 
Now that we've moved past
Watergate—in time, if not in any
deeper sense —most of us have
come to hold a modified view of
our elected officials. The new
opinion has lost a little of the
gentleness of a Will Rogers but
still falls short of the rancor of a
Thomas Nast or lonathan Swift.
Shaped as I am in a Doonesbury
mold, it was a little shocking for
me to read in this month's issue
of the Atlantic that two of our
past presidents and an ex
advisor to our current president
are amoral monsters.
"The Pardon," by Seymour
Hersh, attempts to convince the
reader that there was indeed a
deal struck between Richard
Nixon and Gerald Ford: Nixon
gives Ford the presidency, Ford
gives Nixon a pardon for Water
gate. To add a touch of current
events, Hersh casts Gen. Alex
ander Haig in the role of go
between.
Stated like that, the whole
thing seems rather clean, almost
like a straight exchange or a
business deal. However it is
stated, the truth of the matter
lies in a man desperate to save
himself from loss of privilege—
and prison—willing to sell any
thing he has, another man hys
terically anxious to weather the
storm, and a third willing
enough to go along. The
scoreboard has Nixon as the cri
minal, Haig as the fiend, and
Ford as the yielder to tempta
tion.
The value of Hersh's thesis is
not to be debated here.
Whether Ford accepted office
with the intent to pardon Nixon
or not, he surely must have
known that it was expected of
him. Nixon was nota man fo doa
favor without demanding a re
turn, and by that time he cer
tainly was not in any position to
do so. What is more important is
the tone of the article: President
Reagan bemoans an "un
friendly" press corps, but Hersh
is out for blood.
I was just barely old enough to
understand the Watergate scan
dal. Some had their faith in poli
tics shattered by it, mine was
forged in it. Now I settle back
into a comfortable cynicism, wil
ling to accept Reagan as a de
luded anachronism and our
congressmen as men under high

pressure and thus explosively
fallible. Still, that kind of cyni
cism is actually a guarded op
timism: I can accept the inevita
ble evil in the system as merely a
function of its openness. It takes
a shock like Hersh's article to
brrng into light the fact that there
are villains that our system has
no defense against, who make
wounds it cannot heal.

As a moderately informed,
fashionably skeptical individual,
I found Haig to be a rather quaint
bogeyman. His role as
gibberish-spouting hawk
seemed to be rather self
deflating, as though he were a
hai.dpuppet of the spectre of
death. However, the man who
national television showed up
panicking, gasping "I am in con
trol!" is not so ridiculous.
On the eve of Henry Kissing
er's return to power, the Atlantic
article shows Haig as wheedling,
whining and willing his way into
favor and power with Ford.
Hersh telis of Haig's friendship
with Special Prosecutor Leon
Jaworski in those final days, play

ing "opposing generals" under
the guise of friendship. Hersh
shows Haig (as reported by
Ford's lawyer and personal ad
viser, Benton Becker) as manipu
lating Ford, over-awing Ford
with his familiarity with power
and his own views of what
should be done and what Nixon
wants.
John Dean wrote that Haig was

"Deep Throat," and here he
seemed to be pulling the strings
of a humble man unprepared for
the presidency. It's hard to say
exactly what Haig had designs
upon, but it's frightening to
think how much power he's
wielded as an appointee under
different adminstrations. Here's
a military man, a man never to
my knowledge elected to public
office, and when Reagan was
shot he went on all three net
works to tell us he was in com
mand now!
Perhaps because he has had
the propriety to retire and stay
mostly out of the public eye,
Nixon has come off fairly de
cently in revisionist histories of

Watergate. In 1974 he was some
leviathan octupus, reaching out
to shred the Constitution, in
validate the courts and defy the
Congress. Now we hear that he
was one of our best foreign pol
icy strategists whose main fault
was a marked tendency toward
getting caught. There is some
thing at once both repellently
odious and perversely charming
in the current tendency to see
Watergate as a victimless crime.
Even Hersh pays service to this
retrenchment, quoting an un
named prosecutor as saying that
Nixon had "respect for the gov
ernment, because he stepped
out." This anonymous voice—of
which there are very many
quoted in the article—gives a
worst-case scenario of Nixon de
fying the courts, dissolving
Congress and mobilizing the
troops, all with a majority of pub
lic support.
Then Secretary of Defense
James Schlesinger is profiled as
moving quietly to forestall any
attempt at a military quasi-coup,
perhaps a hopeless, forgone
conclusion against
Commander-in-Chief Nixon,
but a definite precaution and
needed safeguard against Haig.
Nixon comes off better than
Haig in all of this hearsay plot
ting, Haig portrayed as hypocrit
ical and scheming, pressing
everyone to find their limits and
backing off in slightly-more
cautious agreement after the
sounding.
Perhaps the most radical de
parture from the current public
view is in the treatment of Ford.
Hersh extensively quotes the
left-handed compliments paid
him, then proceeds to cast
doubts on even those dim
praises. He quotes one inves
tigator as saying, "For God's
sake, the other guy was a lunatic.
We had a thorough investigation
of (Ford) and we didn't find any
dead women or live boys. He
was a known quantity: k
n-o-w-n; and let's get on with it."
Hersh finds neither of the
above, but does mention several
improprieties before proceed
ing with the grand smear of
Ford's character. Ford, he re
ports, supported aid to Vietnam
and Nixon's anti-communism,
spied for J. Edgar Hoover against
Earl Warren, was "indifferent"

to civil rights, disrupted Wright
Patman's early Watergate inves
tigation at the behest of the
Nixon adminstration—then lied
about it at his confirmation
hearings—and played fast and
loose with his personal financ
ing. Obviously, this is the
character of a man who will, for
solely personal reasons, give a
pardon to an ex-president
forced out of office amid a na
tion schism and in ill health.
I don't know whose skpeti
cism is more dangerous: my
brand of chic, trendy intellectual
laziness in saying all politicians
are corrupt but restrained by
some weak thread of decency or
some inherent obstacle in our
democratic system from run
ning amok and wreaking havoc
on the whole of the body politic,
or Hersh's brand of backbiting
bare-it-all-and-damn-the-inten
tions reportage of anonymous
sources and feuding cliques
culminating in the eradication of
any vestige of morality or benign
intent from the souls and
memories of any individual crass
enough to work in government.
Hersh ends his article by say
ing that the committee that in
vestigated the pardon, Leon
Jaworsky, the White House staff
members now assailed by con
science, Nixon, Haig and finally
Ford all betrayed the public trust
and failed in some oddly equal
way. He concludes by saying
that the transfer of power was
"not a triumph for democracy."
Obviously, Hersh is a man of
rather high standards.
Still, he may be right. It was
not thanks to any inherent
power of democracy that the
crime came to light—there is no
constitutional clause requiring
the hiring of incompetent burg
lars or making awkward han
dling of covert financial transac
tions mandatory. Watergate
would not have been a victim
less crime if the criminals had
gotten away free. Abuses would
have escalated, and there is no
telling what President Haig
would be up to. Maybe we need
to hear the shrill voices of the
muckrakers to keep us alert, but
that is neither a pleasant nor a
promising prospect for our de
mocracy to live with.
