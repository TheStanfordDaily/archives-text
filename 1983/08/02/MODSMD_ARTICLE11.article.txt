## Hoover board pledges cooperation with trustee board 
### JENNIFER ROSEN 
The Hoover Institution Board
of Overseers has pledged to
cooperate "in every way possi
ble" with the Stanford Board of
Trustees in an upcoming study
of relations between the Univer
sity and the Institution.
In a statement issued last
week, the overseers expressed
deep concern over the recent
"unfounded charges" by mem
bers of the Stanford community.
"In our judgment, the direc
tion and operation of the
Hoover Institution are, and have
been, in complete conformity
with the basic understandings
and agreements that apply to the

Hoover Institution and its more
than 60-year relationship to
Stanford University.
"We are proud of the Hoover
Institution and its staff, and be
lieve that their record of ac
complishments and achieve
ment has brought distinction
and credit to the entire Stanford
community," the overseers said.
The overseers also thanked all
professors who signed a petition
organized by French Prof. Al
phonse luilland, Computer Sci
ences Prof. John McCarthy and
Materials Science Engineering
Prof. Oleg Sherby, which op
posed an investigation of al
leged partisanship by the
Hoover Institution as a grave
threat to academic freedom.

According to luilland, the pe
titioners viewed such an investi
gation as an academic threat be

cause the Institution was to be
investigated for its political as
sociation with the Reagan ad
ministration and its conservative
political bias.
"Once you start investigating
an institution for political bias,
you open a Pandora's box," Juil
land said. "If today you investi
gate Hoover for conservative
bias, tomorrow you investigate
the Political Science Department
for its liberal bias. Liberals inves
tigating conservatives, and con
servatives investigating liberals,
are a definite threat to academic
freedom."
luilland also said that an "ex
ternal aspect" of such a threat
would be its effect on other in
stitutions across the country.

Similar investigations could
"spread all over the U. 5.," he
said, resulting in a situation
where "professors are valued
not according to their academic
achievement, hut according to
their political bias."
Although juilland said he
would "rather not make a pre
diction" about the outcome of
the investigation, he expressed
hope that Stanford-Hoover ties
would be strengthened, rather
than weakened, by the investi
gation.
"People at Hoover are using
relations with Stanford for pre
stige. We benefit equally," he
said. "I hope relations will be
strengthened for the mutual be
nefit of the two institutions."
