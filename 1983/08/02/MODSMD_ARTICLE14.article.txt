### RICKY SPEAR 
An associate dean of the
Law School here was ap
pointed last week to the re
cently formed Presidential
Commission on Organized
Crime, a blue ribbon commit
tee created by the Reagan
administration to "analyze
and to tell how the mob oper
ates."
Thomas Mcßride, one of 20
experts with practical experi
ence in combatting or
ganized crime appointed to
the commission, was inspec
tor general of the Depart
ment of Agriculture during
the Carter administration, as
sociate Watergate special
prosecutor with Leon
jaworski and inspector gen
eral of the U.S. Department
of Labor under President Re
agan.
A registered independent
politically, Mcßride has also
served as a trial attorney in
the Organized Section of the
U.S. Department of Justice,
as deputy chief counsel of the
House Select Committee on
Crime in 1969 and as staff di
rector of the Police Founda
tion, a private organization.
Arthur Brill, deputy di
rector of public affairs for the
Department of Justice, said
yesterday that the primary ob
jective of the new presiden
tial commission is "to analyze
and to tell how the mob oper
ates."

According to Brill, Reagan
created the commission to
improve the efforts of all
three branches of govern
ment against organized crime
— "not only traditional or
ganized crime — racketeer
ing — but new forms, such as
motorcycle gangs, and prison
gangs."

He especially emphasized
the administration's fight
against what Brill cited as the
nation's No. 1 criminal prob
lem — drug law violations.
"We think it (drug rac
keteering) is the No. 1 crime
problem because it is directly
related to half the violent
crime that occurs."
The creation of the or
ganized crime committee
marks the second major
committee formed by the Re
agan administration in the
month of July.
