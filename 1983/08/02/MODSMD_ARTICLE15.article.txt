# Dutch parliament member critical of Reagan rhetoric

### BRYCE LEE 
A visiting Dutch Parliament
member warned Friday that
nothing will be gained from
President Reagan's policy of por
traying the Soviet Union as a vil
lain.
Reagan may seriously under
mine arms control negotiations
by "trying to influence negotia
tions through publicspeeches in
which he recognizes the United
States and Western Europe as
angels and the Soviet Union as
the incarnation of evil," Joost
Van lersel told the Daily.
After spending nearly one
month traveling through Ameri
can cities on an economic and
political "fact-finding" tour that
included two weeks in Washing
ton, D.C., Van lersel arrived for
a one-day tour of Stanford and
the Hoover Institution last Fri
day. He is a member of the
Dutch Christian Democratic
Party and the spokesman for in
dustry and trade relations in the
Dutch Parliament.
Considered an expert on eco
nomic and foreign affairs, Van
lersel expressed his disap
pointment with the "lack of tact"
of the United States in arms con
trol negotiations. Reagan's habit
of depicting the Soviets as the
"bad guys" will "influence
negotiations in a negative way
and will serve nobody," Van ler
sel said.
Van lersel cautioned that the

idea that the Soviets are a group
of "monolithic creatures" and
the "incarnation of evil" is
dangerous and may hamper any
attempts at arms control. As an
alternative, he welcomed a more
"quiet" approach to diplomacy.
In addition, Van lersel said
that there are "far too many nu
clear weapons in the world" and
that arms reduction talks are es
sential.
"It is absolutely neccessary to
come to an arms control
(agreement) and to reduce the
number of nuclear weapons,
. . . at least put a ceiling on exist
ing armaments and arsenals as in
SALT I and II," he said. "So I
strongly advocate START."
But even though Van lersel
feels that arms control is of great
importance, he also strongly
supports the 1979 decision to
deploy U.S. cruise missiles in
Europe. He feels that the cruise
missiles will serve a dual role: as
a "bargaining chip" in arms re
duction and as a deterrent if
arms control fails.
In addition to the issue of arms
control, Van lersel also dis
cussed his concern about the
state of the world economy.
"The greatest danger in the in
ternational economy is that the
every single government is only
looking out for (its) own inter
ests without taking into account
the international dimension of
the economies. We are con

fronted more and more with
tensions of protectionism both
in Europe and the U.S."
Misunderstanding between
the United States and Europe is
also a factor in creating tension,
Van lersel said.
"We must coordinate views,"
he added, so that "a concrete
economic policy can be attained
so that free trade is maintained."
Such a policy is of mutual
interest to both Europe and the
United States, Van lersel said.
He emphasized that coopera
tion is vital to the United States
because of the growing eco
nomic power of Europe.
Van lersel also criticized the
United States for failing to
realize its true economic rela
tionship to Europe.
"The U.S. economy is no
longer closed. It is largely de
pendent on import and export
and is an integral part of the
world trade system. Therefore
we must come into an agree
ment with each other, for it is
largely a matter of give and
take."
Van lersel warned that the
present economic recovery may
only be temporary and that high
U.S. interest rates were harmful
to European recovery. High
interest rates "attract much capi
tal to the U.S." he said, prompt
ing European bankers to raise
interest rates in their countries.
