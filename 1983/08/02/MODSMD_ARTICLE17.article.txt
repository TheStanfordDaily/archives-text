## Kerouac's random access biography 
### ROBERT BASIL 
Gerald Nicosia, Memory
Babe: A Critical Biography of
Jack Kerouac, Grove Press,
767 pp., $22.50.
Jack Kerouac published 18
books during his liftime; four
more have come out posthum
ously. Since his death in 1969,
only two books — neither very
good — have been written on his
work. Olympians of the New
York literary parlor have only
occasionally thrown bones of
interest or approval his way —
John Updike, the king of "mime
tic fiction," has quipped,
"(Kerouac) attempted to grab it
all; somehow, to grab it all. I like
him." Updike's is about as ar
ticulate as appraisals have come.
With the exception of a few es
says discussing his most famous
books, Kerouac's work has been
roundly ignored.
His life, however, has been
hysterically famous. You've
heard th*? rap: Jack Kerouac and
Neal Cassady and one girl be
tween 'em and gas fumes pour
ing through those car floor
boards and going 90 for chris
sake heading straight on into the
bleary American Night! Mad
Jack feeding teletype paper into
his typewriter and benzedrine
and scotch into his mouth and
going at it for days without end
100 words a minute! And Sad
Jack always coming home to his
Jew-hating mother for love and
fresh French Canadian soup and
growing into a fat jerk and bet
raying his Gary Cooper dark
handsomeness, his trained
Catholic elegance, and the mil
lions of beatniks, hippies and
rockers who claimed him as
their Buddha! What a story!
With Gerald Nicosia's Memory
Babe, we have the tale for a
fourth time. The author had
good reason to be dissatisfied
with the three earlier "lives,"
and one hopes and expects that
his biography will be the last. It's
definitely the longest — more
than 700 pages. Nicosia has con
tacted everybody who ever
bumped into Kerouac. If you're
reading this review, you proba
bly know several people who got
his queries. But the amount of
material Nicosia has assembled
seems to have hurt the quality of
his writing.
Much of the blame should go
to the editors at Grove Press
there is no evidence that any
body looked at the manuscript

with a blue pencil before it went
to press. There are many er
rors, and the book's organiza
tion, from sentence to sentence
as well as from chapter to chap
ter, is often incoherent. I sus
pect that either Nicosia decided
to put together a scholarly biog
raphy as spontaneously as
Kerouac supposedly composed
his novels, or some San Fran
cisco wind blew through his
study window and brutally shuf
fled his note cards.
Nicosia has shown little dis
cretion in choosing quotes and
authorities. Anybody who told
him, "Yes, me and Jack wentout
New Year's Eve in 1955 and
ended up in bed with Thelonius
Monk's piano," gets a chapter.
People who claim best friend
status in one chapter never sur
face again. The book's tone can
be compared to that of a loud,
drunken party, full of suspicious
voices going all at once, both re
peating and contradicting each
other.
This lack of authorial discern
ment, however, allows Nicosia
to get all sorts of facts and
sources down on paper that he
might have deleted, were he
worrying about keeping to
gether a fixed portrait of
Kerouac. It is quite wonderful,
for example, to read the few
pages given to Robert Creeley's
perception of Kerouac and his
work — Creeley was amazed at
Kerouac's "ability to translate
immediate sensation into im
mediately actual language" — or
to listen to several of Kerouac's
childhood cohorts (mostly ig
nored in the earlier biographies)
recount his frustrated football
and romantic aspirations.
Another primary value of (his
biography is that it describes in
lurid, bathetic detail the
difference between the quality
of Kerouac's life and his work.
Kerouac, born in Lowell, Mas
sachusetts in 1922 of French
Canadian parents, was a high
school star athlete. He went to
the same prep school as William
Buckley, and then bounced in
and out of Columbia University
on scholarships. Hanging
around Columbia, he became
friends with William Burroughs
and Allen Ginsberg — the three
later became the center of what
Kerouac himself termed "the
beat generation." Nicosia traces
with relentless attention to de

tail (if also with less than even
insight) Kerouac's obsessions
with jazz and the urban under
side of life, his increasingly un
happy sexual behavior, the al
coholism that would kill him at
47, and his clinging to his
mother.
Paradoxically, the very faults
that make reading Nicosia's
book tedious will probably im
prove the quality of scholarship
and criticism being done on
Kerouac, if only because it will
turn the focus from the writer's
overexamined life to the ne
glected body of his work. In
some ways, the "critical" por
tions of this biography serve to
begin such discussion. Though
mired in conventional
rigamarole, much of what
Nicosia says is new and interest
ing. Even more important is the
lengthy and groundbreaking
analysis of Kerouac's most for
mally innovative achievement,
Visions of Cody.
It is about time that the resi
due of the romantic myth of
Kerouac and his bohemian pals
drained away. Now that the
writers who fashioned their
esthetic stances as anti
academic street poets are te
nured professors, many of
whose public readings amount
to either onanism or cruel shril
ling, we should regard the work
of the Beat Generation, and
Kerouac in particular, indepen
dently from the biographies. On
the Road can live without them.
