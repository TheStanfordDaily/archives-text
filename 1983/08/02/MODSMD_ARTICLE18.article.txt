# Some minor cracks in Morris West's Glass
## 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
Morris West, The World Is
Made of Glass, William Mor
row, 322 pp, $15.95.
Out of a case history related
by psychologist C.C. Jung in
his autobiographical Dreams,
Memories, Reflections, Morris
West has created an arresting
character with an extraordinary
history. Jung tells of a woman
who came for a single consulta
tion, to confess that she had
long ago murdered her best
friend in order to marry the
friend's husband, and had car
ried out the entire plan success
fully.
The sketch is provocative, and
West has developed an exotic
character, Magda, to play the
role of Jung's patient. But West
has altered the story so that Jung
is the one who chooses to ter
minate the analysis, because he
senses a dangerous sympathy in
his and Magda's characters, a
sympathy that threatens to pro
duceadual madness in which he
would come out the loser.
West's desire to examine the
possibility of such a psychologi
cal "contagion" is promising,
but as it turns out, Jung's charac
ter does not tie in to Magda's
convincingly, and ends up seem
ing somewhat disconnected
from the rest of the novel.
Jung and Magda alternate
first-person narratives. Magda's
is preoccupied with the prob
lems that lead her to seek help

from lung; her sadistic tenden
cies are getting out of hand, and
she is too well known for her
kinky tastes. Jung's narrative
centers on the personal and
domestic problems current at
the onset of his breakdown in
1913. The two protagonists only
meet halfway through the book,

'You have learnt that
there is no greater ex
citement than to hold
a life in your hands,
knowing that you
can snuff it out like a
candle flame. There is
no orgasm more po
tent than that pro
duced by the act of
execution. You have
experienced it. You
are obsessed to
repeat it-and sooner
or later-you will/
â€”From Magda's diary

at which point they each begin
reporting the single day of con
sultation that Magda undergoes.
Magda's part in the storytel
ling is lively and engaging. Now
in her 40s, she has lived a re

markable, cosmopolitain life in
the highest circles of European
society. Magda's adventures fol
lowing her husband's early
death are what cause her to seek
advice, but the novel focuses on
the formative events that pre
cede these years. Her very un
usual education and upbringing
come in for lengthy treatment,
and merit it. West has created a
fascinating character here,
though much of Magda's attrac
tion depends on her freakish
ness, so she comes across more
as a biography than as a person,
and our sympathies for her are
consequently weakened.
Jung is interesting both as a
narrator and as a character, but
this cannot be credited entirely
to West. The psychologist's
biography is followed very
closely, not only recounting real
professional and domestic in
trigues, but even retelling
dreams Jung recorded himself.
Although this information enter
tains the reader, it could only be
justified if it contributed to the
novel as a whole, and for this it
would have to be important in
determining the course of Jung's
encounter with Magda. Al
though both characters describe
a special sense of identity felt be
tween them, the events de
scribed do not bear this out.
The encounter itself is not par
ticularly helpful to the novel. In a
marathon session, Magda pro
vides a biography to Jung, to

form a basis for analysis. But her
life story is begun even before
the two meet, and the session
just serves as a convenient occa
sion to complete it. The conflicts
and sympathies that mar the
consultation are dramatic, and
reason enough to break off the
treatment, but they do not seem
particularly drastic when Jung
keeps on referring to other
dangerous patients he has had.
The special psychological
threat that is supposed to be de
veloped here does not seem
very great. The novel may be in
tended to center around the
unique relationship between
Jung and Magda, but these two
narrative strands never bind to

gether adequately, and Jung's,
which is derivative, finally ap
pears superflous.
The potential of such a book
to explore the analytic relation
ship goes unfulfilled, since no
analysis e w er occurs. D.M.
Thomas' The White Hotel gave a
far more complete view of
psychology and its status in the
early years of this century than
does The World is Madeof Class.
The richness of West's novel is
largely independent of its
source in lung's analyses. Less
emphasis on this origin would
have tightened its structure.
