### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
Flashbacks, an autobiography, by
Timothy Leary, J.P. Tarcher &
Houghton Mifflin, 397 pp., $15.95.
Timothy Leary's Flashbacks succeeds
as a brisk, informative biography of the
author, but proves strangely incomplete
as an autobiography, a genre that ought
to present a more subtle, complex record
of its subject's experiences than a biog
raphy can. Leary adds a strange quality of
detachment to the enthusiasm present
throughout this book, thus appearing
either diffident with his readers, or out of
touch with the deeper side of his emo
tional life. He nevertheless provides an
entertaining account of his activities dur
ing the '60s and '70s, with an energetic
review of the theories that underlay his
plans.
'She wore tennis shoes! that was the
genetic signal.'
Leary's espousal of Neo-Lamarckian
theories of evolution, based on the prin
ciple that.genetic changes occur as a logi
cal response to the environment, not just
randomly, complements his views about
the scientific uses of psychedelic drugs,
so that his proposals for directing the fu
ture evolution of mankind seem fairly ra
tional, if still unconvincing. Indeed, the
way Leary spinsout schemes and theories
on the basis of a few far-out axioms is one
of the most amusing things about
Flashbacks.
The real-life escapades Leary describes
are even more absorbing than his
metaphysical adventu res. The story of the
early experiments with psilocybin at Har
vard is informative, and provides an ap
propriately moderate introduction to the
wackier incidents that follow. Leary re

counts the ins and outs of his 1966 trial for
possession of marijuana, briefly covers
his California gubernatorial campaign,
and explains in detail how he escaped
from prison with the help of the Wea
thermen. The ensuing period of exile,
first with Eldridge Cleaver in Algeria, and
then in Switzerland, ended with his ex
tradition from Afghanistan, and his return
to a series of state and federal prisons.
Flashbacks concludes with Leary's ulti
mate release in 1976.
Leary tells a good story, in a breezy
style that communicates an energy that
must make him an enjoyable companion
in good times. His reaction to difficulties,
however, is puzzling, for he tends to con
centrate on action, and does not tell
much about his thoughts. When he does
talk about his inner life, Leary is so frank
about it that the absence of any periods of
serious reflection seems to mean that he
simply does not confront his own reac
tions to adversity. The nine-month silenc
ing he underwent as a cadet at West Point
and his many years in prison do not seem
to have led to any personal crises. This
seems a little odd.
'Everyone lives in a neural cocoon of
private reality.'
The absence of this kind of thing in
Flashbacks would not be so apparent, nor
would it call for comment, if Leary did not
bring it into play by the structural promi
nence he gives to the suicide of his first
wife. The book is divided into two halves.
The second reviews his life from 1963 on,
in uninterrupted chronological se
quence. The first half consists of a similar
coverage of 1959 through 1963, with
"flashbacks" from his life up to age 40
interspersed to complete the autobiog

raphy. The very first flashback recalls the
bare fact of his wife's suicide, and the last
explains the circumstances of Leary's
adulterous affair (managed with appalling
insensitivity) that provoked it.
One senses Leary's sorrow and regret,
and he says that he had not gotten over
his wife's death five years later, but de
spite the importance he claims this mis
fortune had for him, he still doesn't seem
to have been hurt enough to stop and risk
genuine self doubt. Leary's relationships
with his children and friends indicate that
he is capable of ready emotion and con
cern, but also displays occasional callous
ness and indifferencp. He is sensitive to
complaints of his apparent detachment,
and attempts to explain his attitude by
comparing himself to a professional
athlete, who goes for the percentages
and never gets so involved that he forgets
he's just playing a game. This stance is
independent of his use of LSD, but Leary
indicates that it was confirmed by his very
first trip: "From that day I have never lost
the sense that I am an actor, surrounded
by characters, props, and sets for the
comic drama being written in my brain."
His life is certainly a drama, and as pre
sented in Flashbacks it is often comic. But
it is disturbing how lightly Leary seems to
take his role in the spectacle. Perhaps it is
unfair to judge someone's character
merely on the basis of an autobiography,
especially when his life is as eventful and
public as Leary's has been, but I still can't
help wondering how much human sub
stance lies within the "cheerleader for
evolution" persona that Leary so eagerly
adopted.
