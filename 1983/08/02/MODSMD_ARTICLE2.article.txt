# Professors attack Central American policy
## 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
Although the Central Ameri
can situation has been capturing
the headlines for the past three
years, in recent weeks events
have become even more press
ing. The Daily contacted four
experts in Latin American and
U.S. policy and asked for their
opinions on the issues.
Recent administration actions
show a two-pronged approach
to the U.S. policy: Reagan has
pushed for an increase in U.S.
military activity in the area while
at the same time he has left the
door open for negotiations in
the region.
The Reagan administration is
increasing its attempts to either
overthrow the government of
Nicaragua or intimidate it into
changing its policies. It is con
tinuing to provide covert aid to
rebels trying to take over the
government and it has an
nounced plans for large scale
U.S. naval maneuvers in the re
gion. The administration con
tends that Nicaragua has fueled
tensions in the region by provid

ing large-scale aid to the rebels
in El Salvador.
Meanwhile, critics in Con
gress have reacted to the
stronger policy with greater op
position. Last Thursday the
House voted to cut off $80 mil
lion in covert aid to rebels trying
to overthrow the government of
Nicaragua. The vote has not
legal force because it is unlikely
that the Senate will consider the
matter, but it did provide sym
bolic opposition to Reagan
policies.
On the diplomatic front, spe
cial U.S. envoy to the region
Richard Stone made the first of
ficial U.S. contact with leaders of
the revolutionaries fighting
against the government of El Sal
vador at a meeting Sunday in
Bogota, Colombia.
Stanford Latin American and
U.S. policy experts contacted by
the Daily reacted with mixed in
terpretations of the situation
and U.S. policy in the region.
However, all agreed that U.S.
policy is ambiguous and confus
ing.

"Pushing this war is not having

Reynolds said that Reagan's
political analysts thought this
war could increase his popular

Senior Research Fellow
Robert Wesson of the Hoover
Institution agreed. "It is an ex

not want to be involved with the
CIA in the region," he said.
Political Science Prof. Alexan
der George, recent winner of a
Mac Arthur Foundation award,
said that Reagan could use the
vote as a form of political
blackmail.
