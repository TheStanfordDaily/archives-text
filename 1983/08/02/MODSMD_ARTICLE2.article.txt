# Professors attack Central American policy
## 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
Although the Central Ameri
can situation has been capturing
the headlines for the past three
years, in recent weeks events
have become even more press
ing. The Daily contacted four
experts in Latin American and
U.S. policy and asked for their
opinions on the issues.
Recent administration actions
show a two-pronged approach
to the U.S. policy: Reagan has
pushed for an increase in U.S.
military activity in the area while
at the same time he has left the
door open for negotiations in
the region.
The Reagan administration is
increasing its attempts to either
overthrow the government of
Nicaragua or intimidate it into
changing its policies. It is con
tinuing to provide covert aid to
rebels trying to take over the
government and it has an
nounced plans for large scale
U.S. naval maneuvers in the re
gion. The administration con
tends that Nicaragua has fueled
tensions in the region by provid

ing large-scale aid to the rebels
in El Salvador.
Meanwhile, critics in Con
gress have reacted to the
stronger policy with greater op
position. Last Thursday the
House voted to cut off $80 mil
lion in covert aid to rebels trying
to overthrow the government of
Nicaragua. The vote has not
legal force because it is unlikely
that the Senate will consider the
matter, but it did provide sym
bolic opposition to Reagan
policies.
On the diplomatic front, spe
cial U.S. envoy to the region
Richard Stone made the first of
ficial U.S. contact with leaders of
the revolutionaries fighting
against the government of El Sal
vador at a meeting Sunday in
Bogota, Colombia.
Stanford Latin American and
U.S. policy experts contacted by
the Daily reacted with mixed in
terpretations of the situation
and U.S. policy in the region.
However, all agreed that U.S.
policy is ambiguous and confus
ing.

House vote
Food Research Institute Prof.
Clark Reynolds (eared that the
House vote to cut off covert aid
in Nicaragua would force the
Reagan administration to chan
nel aid to the rebels there
through other nations. "It's
likely to make covert aid, more
covert," he said.

political split on the issues. But
headded it indicates that"popu
lar opinion is on the side of cut
ting off aid."
"Pushing this war is not having
the same effect on the popular
ity of Reagan as the Malvinas
(Falklands) war had on the popu
larity of Thatcher in Britain."
Reynolds said that Reagan's
political analysts thought this
war could increase his popular
ity.
Senior Research Fellow
Robert Wesson of the Hoover
Institution agreed. "It is an ex
pression that most Americans do
not want to be involved with the
CIA in the region," he said.
Political Science Prof. Alexan
der George, recent winner of a
Mac Arthur Foundation award,
said that Reagan could use the
vote as a form of political
blackmail.
"It's typical of presidents who
have a hard time getting con
gressional support for policies
to try political blackmail. They
say, 'If things go bad in Central

vote indicates the profound
America and you don't support
me, the blame will be on you.'
This puts Congress on the spot
so they have to go along with it,
at least part way," George said.
"This kind of political maneuver
is unfortunately a part of the
American system."
Richard Fagen, a political sci
ence professor, said the vote is
part of a long history of opposi
tion to Reagan policies in the re
gion. "I don't think he can now
get everything he wants in either
House."
Negotiations
According to Fagen, the re
cent negotiations between
Stone and the insurgents of El
Salvador represent a positive
step. However, he added, "I
don't think it's a switch in direc
tion."
"The Reagan administration is
concerned with at least present
ing the appearance of a willing
ness to negotiate. But it (the
meeting) does not mean it wants
to negotiate seriously," Fagen
said.
Wesson said he believed that
the Reagan administration was
realistic enough to negotiate
with the rebels in El Salvador.
But concerning negotiations

with Nicaragua, he said, "I've
talked to some people in the
State Department who say the
only way the Sandinistas could
placate the Reagan administra
tion would be to shoot them
selves. I have tended to have the
feeling that the Reagan adminis
tration would tolerate nothing
but a change in the Sandinista
government."
Fagen said that although it is
unwilling, eventually the Reagan
administration may have to
negotiate with the Sandinista
government of Nicaragua.
The reason, he said, is that the
Nicaraguan rebels cannot win
the war at the current levels of
U.S. aid. In addition, as the
House vote indicated, the Re
agan administration cannot win
support for increased aid to the
rebels there.
"The military campaign is not
going well," Fagen said.
"They've been fightingforovera
year and they have yet to win a
beachhead. They are still fight
ing from Honduras."
In addition, he said they have
not made any progress at "win
ning the hearts and minds of the
people."
Concerning the role of the
Contadores, a group including
Mexico, Panama, Colombia and

Venezuela that has offered to act
as intermediary toward solving
the conflicts of Central America,
Wesson said the Reagan admin
istration has been ambiguous.
"It's unclear to what extent
they are prepared to take a polit
ical stand or search for a military
solution," he said. "I suspect the
administration has not made up
its own mind and they are cer
tainly not letting us know."
Naval maneuvers
George voiced concern over
the planned naval maneuvers off
the coast of Nicaragua. "It's very
risky, this show of force and this
inflation of the stakes with
rhetoric in an effort to gain pub
lic support," he said. "We did
the same thing in Vietnam."
George warned of three main
problems with this strategy.
First, it leaves the United States
in a weak position if "the bluff is
called." Also, whatever increase
in public support the strategy
receives is tied to whether the
intimidation works. "Support
will drop quickly if the bluff is
called and intervention is in
creased," he said.
In addition, according to
George, the maneuvers leave
open the possibility of some
type of incident such as the one
that occurred in the Gulf of Ton

kin in Vietnam in the early '60s
and was used throughout the
war to justify U.S. intervention.
Wesson said he was unsure
whether the maneuvers repre
sented a gesture or preparation
for further moves. He added the
Reagan administration wants to
create some "uncertainty which
may be a valid move in negotia
tions."
However, according to Fagen,
who visited Nicaragua last year,
the maneuvers will not be effec
tive in intimidating the people or
the government of that nation in
negotiations.
"I think they will harden the
Nicaraguans will to exist," Fagen
said. "They already believe that
under certain circumstances the
U.S. would invade them. They
don't need naval maneuvers to
convince them of that."
Kissinger commission
The Kissinger commission — a
bipartisan group set up by Re
agan to make recommendations
concerning the U.S. role in
Central America — received
strong criticism from Fagen.
"I think it's a farce in the sense
that it will not come up with rec
ommendations sharply at vari
ance to what the Reagan admin
istration would do anyway," he
said.

Wesson agreed that the com
mission's purpose is to gain
popularity for Reagan adminis
tration policies. But, he said, "it
may quite properly express
something that needs to be ex
pressed."
Reynolds attacked Kissinger's
appointment because "Kis
singer is a total cynic."
"His philosophy is to keep the
world safe for the status quo and
that's totally antitheiical to the
needs of Central America,"he
said. "He's back iri 19th cen
tury power politics."
Reynolds, Fagen and George
agreed that the Soviet role in the
region, which the Reagan ad
ministration has emphasized, is
indirect and not a decisive fac
tor.
All the experts agreed that
there is no easy or short-term
solution to the conflicts of Cent
ral America.
Reynolds offered an analogy
of the conditions in Central
America. "It's analogous to the
U.S. before the Civil War: you
have a proto-slavery situation.
Effectively bringing proto-slaves
into society takes decades."
For the time being, Reynolds
said, "all you can do is watch the
suffering with anguish and try to
reduce outside interference."
Although the Central Ameri
can situation has been capturing
the headlines for the past three
years, in recent weeks events
have become even more press

The reason, he said, is that the
Nicaraguan rebels cannot win
the war at the current levels of
U.S. aid. In addition, as the
House vote indicated, the Re
agan administration cannot win
support for increased aid to the
rebels there.
"The military campaign is not
going well," Fagen said.
"They've been fightingforovera
year and they have yet to win a
beachhead. They are still fight
ing from Honduras."
In addition, he said they have
not made any progress at "win
ning the hearts and minds of the
people."
Concerning the role of the
Contadores, a group including
Mexico, Panama, Colombia and

Venezuela that has offered to act
as intermediary toward solving
the conflicts of Central America,
Wesson said the Reagan admin
istration has been ambiguous.
"It's unclear to what extent
they are prepared to take a polit
ical stand or search for a military
solution," he said. "I suspect the
administration has not made up
its own mind and they are cer
tainly not letting us know."
Naval maneuvers
George voiced concern over
the planned naval maneuvers off
the coast of Nicaragua. "It's very
risky, this show of force and this
inflation of the stakes with
rhetoric in an effort to gain pub
lic support," he said. "We did
the same thing in Vietnam."
George warned of three main
problems with this strategy.
First, it leaves the United States
in a weak position if "the bluff is
called." Also, whatever increase
in public support the strategy
receives is tied to whether the
intimidation works. "Support
will drop quickly if the bluff is
called and intervention is in
creased," he said.
In addition, according to
George, the maneuvers leave
open the possibility of some
type of incident such as the one
that occurred in the Gulf of Ton

kin in Vietnam in the early '60s
and was used throughout the
war to justify U.S. intervention.
Wesson said he was unsure
whether the maneuvers repre
sented a gesture or preparation
for further moves. He added the
Reagan administration wants to
create some "uncertainty which
may be a valid move in negotia
tions."
However, according to Fagen,
who visited Nicaragua last year,
the maneuvers will not be effec
tive in intimidating the people or
the government of that nation in
negotiations.
"I think they will harden the
Nicaraguans will to exist," Fagen
said. "They already believe that
under certain circumstances the
U.S. would invade them. They
don't need naval maneuvers to
convince them of that."
Kissinger commission
The Kissinger commission — a
bipartisan group set up by Re
agan to make recommendations
concerning the U.S. role in
Central America — received
strong criticism from Fagen.
"I think it's a farce in the sense
that it will not come up with rec
ommendations sharply at vari
ance to what the Reagan admin
istration would do anyway," he
said.

Wesson agreed that the com
mission's purpose is to gain
popularity for Reagan adminis
tration policies. But, he said, "it
may quite properly express
something that needs to be ex
pressed."
Reynolds attacked Kissinger's
appointment because "Kis
singer is a total cynic."
"His philosophy is to keep the
world safe for the status quo and
that's totally antitheiical to the
needs of Central America,"he
said. "He's back iri 19th cen
tury power politics."
Reynolds, Fagen and George
agreed that the Soviet role in the
region, which the Reagan ad
ministration has emphasized, is
indirect and not a decisive fac
tor.
All the experts agreed that
there is no easy or short-term
solution to the conflicts of Cent
ral America.
Reynolds offered an analogy
of the conditions in Central
America. "It's analogous to the
U.S. before the Civil War: you
have a proto-slavery situation.
Effectively bringing proto-slaves
into society takes decades."
For the time being, Reynolds
said, "all you can do is watch the
suffering with anguish and try to
reduce outside interference."
Although the Central Ameri
can situation has been capturing
the headlines for the past three
years, in recent weeks events
have become even more press
ing. The Daily contacted four
experts in Latin American and
U.S. policy and asked for their
opinions on the issues.
Recent administration actions
show a two-pronged approach
to the U.S. policy: Reagan has
pushed for an increase in U.S.
military activity in the area while
at the same time he has left the
door open for negotiations in
the region.
The Reagan administration is
increasing its attempts to either
overthrow the government of
Nicaragua or intimidate it into
changing its policies. It is con
tinuing to provide covert aid to
rebels trying to take over the
government and it has an
nounced plans for large scale
U.S. naval maneuvers in the re
gion. The administration con
tends that Nicaragua has fueled
tensions in the region by provid

ing large-scale aid to the rebels
in El Salvador.
Meanwhile, critics in Con
gress have reacted to the
stronger policy with greater op
position. Last Thursday the
House voted to cut off $80 mil
lion in covert aid to rebels trying
to overthrow the government of
Nicaragua. The vote has not
legal force because it is unlikely
that the Senate will consider the
matter, but it did provide sym
bolic opposition to Reagan
policies.
On the diplomatic front, spe
cial U.S. envoy to the region
Richard Stone made the first of
ficial U.S. contact with leaders of
the revolutionaries fighting
against the government of El Sal
vador at a meeting Sunday in
Bogota, Colombia.
Stanford Latin American and
U.S. policy experts contacted by
the Daily reacted with mixed in
terpretations of the situation
and U.S. policy in the region.
However, all agreed that U.S.
policy is ambiguous and confus
ing.

House vote
Food Research Institute Prof.
Clark Reynolds (eared that the
House vote to cut off covert aid
in Nicaragua would force the
Reagan administration to chan

through other nations. "It's
likely to make covert aid, more
covert," he said.

political split on the issues. But
headded it indicates that"popu
lar opinion is on the side of cut
ting off aid."
"Pushing this war is not having
the same effect on the popular
ity of Reagan as the Malvinas
(Falklands) war had on the popu
larity of Thatcher in Britain."
Reynolds said that Reagan's
political analysts thought this
war could increase his popular
ity.
Senior Research Fellow
Robert Wesson of the Hoover
Institution agreed. "It is an ex
pression that most Americans do
not want to be involved with the
CIA in the region," he said.
Political Science Prof. Alexan
der George, recent winner of a
Mac Arthur Foundation award,
said that Reagan could use the
vote as a form of political
blackmail.
"It's typical of presidents who
have a hard time getting con
gressional support for policies
to try political blackmail. They
say, 'If things go bad in Central

vote indicates the profound
America and you don't support
me, the blame will be on you.'
This puts Congress on the spot
so they have to go along with it,
at least part way," George said.
"This kind of political maneuver
is unfortunately a part of the
American system."
Richard Fagen, a political sci
ence professor, said the vote is
part of a long history of opposi
tion to Reagan policies in the re
gion. "I don't think he can now
get everything he wants in either
House."
Negotiations
According to Fagen, the re
cent negotiations between
Stone and the insurgents of El
Salvador represent a positive
step. However, he added, "I
don't think it's a switch in direc
tion."
"The Reagan administration is
concerned with at least present
ing the appearance of a willing
ness to negotiate. But it (the
meeting) does not mean it wants
to negotiate seriously," Fagen
said.
Wesson said he believed that
the Reagan administration was
realistic enough to negotiate
with the rebels in El Salvador.
But concerning negotiations

with Nicaragua, he said, "I've
talked to some people in the
State Department who say the
only way the Sandinistas could
placate the Reagan administra
tion would be to shoot them
selves. I have tended to have the
feeling that the Reagan adminis
tration would tolerate nothing
but a change in the Sandinista
government."
Fagen said that although it is
unwilling, eventually the Reagan
administration may have to
negotiate with the Sandinista
government of Nicaragua.
The reason, he said, is that the
Nicaraguan rebels cannot win
the war at the current levels of
U.S. aid. In addition, as the
House vote indicated, the Re
agan administration cannot win
support for increased aid to the
rebels there.
