"Style is something I've never
consciously thought of. The way
I've played at a given point in my
career reflected how I felt at that
time. I've never tried to force my
playing to go in one way or
another; I've let it evolve. I don't
try to play different, I just try to
play better."
These words may seem
strange coming from Stan Getz,
one of the most distinctive
stylists in jazz. In contrast to the
sameness that pervades much of
jazz, Getz's tenor sound is
unique and immediately identi
fiable. Very much like his con
temporary Miles Davis, Getz
forged his own personal mixture
of lyricism and emotional inten
sity; but unlike Miles, whose
playing today is a pale reminder
of past brilliance, Getz is as
much a dominant force in the
jazz world as ever.
Getz's reluctance to force
stylistic development or change
is at the heart of his musical per
sonality. He is an instinctive
musician — even more so than
most jazz players. He has no
formulas for good playing, and
when forced to formalize his ap
proach he relies on the dictates
of good taste.
"Form, logic, content — these
are the three things that you


Style,
instinct
and
Stan
Getz
need to have in good improvis
ing. The problem with a lot of
younger players is that they get
bored too quickly; they always
want something new and
different. They don't play with
thought; instead they end up
playing a lot of fast licks; their
playing lacks depth."
It is perhaps no surprise that
Getz, with his emphasis on mus
ical integrity, dismisses attempts
to politicize jazz. "A lot of the
newer movements in jazz are at
tempts to make a political state
ment with the music. I don't
think music should be political.
My personal idea of music as an
art form is to use it to bring
people something beautiful." At
the same time Getz is anything
but politically apathetic — his
upcoming schedule includes
several benefits for causes he
supports.

Getz, a traditionalist who
sounds like a modernist,
strongly recommends that
younger musicians become
aware of the richness of the jazz
tradition. "Younger musicians
should listen to jack Teagarden,
Benny Goodman, Lester Young,
Louis Armstrong, Pee Wee Rus
sell, the Ellington band and its
soloists like johnny Hodges and
Harry Carney." At the same time
he expresses an understanding
and appreciation of later
saxophonists — many of whom
were influenced by Getz's play
ing — like John Coltrane, Joe
Henderson, Wayne Shorter,
Sonny Rollins, Eddie Harris.
"Good jazz education pro
grams in schools and univer
sities can help the younger
players come to grips with the
tradition. When I was coming up
there were essentially two
schools of jazz — dixieland and
swing — but the younger player
of today is faced by so many
different schools of music that
all claim to be jazz. There are so
many musicians and such a glut

of records on the market that it
can be very confusing for them."
At the same time, Getz's own
musical education was not a
formal, institutionalized process
— it was rather a case of "learn
ing by doing." After only a
couple years of disciplined prac
ticing, he began working with
major bands. "Back then we
used to call it the 'travelling
academy.' Over a period of
seven years I worked with about
as many bands.
"Conditions were much
different then, as were attitudes
towards jazz. For example, al
bums nowadays are commercial
projects, instead of document
ing an actual performing situa
tion. Today the engineer can
end up determining the sound
on the record.
"I can recall making records
with just two microphones. In a
situation like that a band had to
learn how to balance itself.
Those kind of conditions de
manded musical skills which are
just not seen nowadays."
Getz emphasizes that in his
own development as a musician
he followed a pattern of steady
evolution, rather than a series of
abrupt changes. In conversation
he stresses the importance of
understanding the traditions of
the music and building from
there.
"I joined the musicians union

the same day as Allen Eager, and
I remember that he went with a
swing band while I joined lack
Teagarden's bad, which did di
xieland; I always felt that it was
good for me to have gone that
route. I started with the begin
ning of the tradition and built
from there."
This understanding of the full
range of the tradition accounts
for his rare ability to be comfort
able in any number of musical
contexts. Fans familiar with his
recent work are well aware of his
ability in a mainstream setting,
and his work with Brazilian
bossa nova music brought him
both widespread acclaim and
several Grammy awards; but
equally impressive is his work
with strings (with a double string
quartet on the Focus album), ac
companying singers, in jam ses
sions (with Norman Cranz's
JATP), or in more subdued, trad
itional settings (check out his
work with Jimmy Rowles on The
Peacocks album of several years
back). '
Getz's work with the Stanford
Jazz Workshop, an affiliation
which began last year, has put
him into contact with aspiring
young musicians and has given
him an opportunity to share his
extensive experience in an edu
cational setting. His stay at Stan
ford includes lecturing, indi
vidual instruction, as well as a

performance by his quartet.
"At first I thought I had never
done anything like this kind of
teaching before. I looked on it as
moving into a new and different
type of activity. But Jim McNeely
(the pianist in Getz's quartet)
pointed out to me that the teach
ing was very similar to what I do
with my band."
Cetz tries to infuse students
with a sense of musical taste
which transcends the emoting
and empty pyrotechnics which
he sees in many younger
players. When asked to elabo
rate on his admiration for Jack
Teagarden, Cetz made clear his
own musical values: "He didn't
play radically different from
what had gone on before, but
what he played was perfect. It
seems that playing in good taste
is almost out of style today.
People seem to have to react vio
lently to musical styles today,
just as they do to lifestyles."
"Really, if you play what's true
for you — regardless of what
people call good or bad — no
body can put you down for it. It's
important for a musician to have
a certain amount of irreverence
— and I mean that in two ways.
Irreverence lets you go your
own direction when others dis
agree, but irreverence is just as
much sticking to your guns
when others are pushing you to
change."
