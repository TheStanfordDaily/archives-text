"Style is something I've never
consciously thought of. The way
I've played at a given point in my
career reflected how I felt at that
time. I've never tried to force my
playing to go in one way or
another; I've let it evolve. I don't
try to play different, I just try to
play better."
These words may seem
strange coming from Stan Getz,
one of the most distinctive
stylists in jazz. In contrast to the
sameness that pervades much of
jazz, Getz's tenor sound is
unique and immediately identi
fiable. Very much like his con
temporary Miles Davis, Getz
forged his own personal mixture
of lyricism and emotional inten
sity; but unlike Miles, whose
playing today is a pale reminder
of past brilliance, Getz is as
much a dominant force in the
jazz world as ever.
Getz's reluctance to force
stylistic development or change
is at the heart of his musical per
sonality. He is an instinctive
musician — even more so than
most jazz players. He has no
formulas for good playing, and
when forced to formalize his ap
proach he relies on the dictates
of good taste.
