# The
						bare bones of heavy metal

### ERIC POSTEL 
New Wave has achieved gen
eral acceptance and is well on its
way towards controlling main
stream American radio. The
adoption of this music by the
masses guarantees that the
young and restless will turn
elsewhere to express their emo
tions. Many will turn to Heavy
Metal.
Devotees of heavy metal will
say it never left. In some ways
that is true. The '60s saw the
emergence of hard-rock bands
such as Cream, Black Sabbath
and Deep Purple. With the '70s
came the term heavy metal and
bands such as Van Halen,
Aerosmith, Ted Nugent. But
most of those bands are either
long gone, or are playing huge
stadiums and have succumbed
to many of the over-indulgences
that helped to give rise to punk
and new music. However, a
whole new generation of hard
rockers started emerging in En
gland (where else) around 1979
and they are quickly gaining big
followings.
The second generation of
heavy metal bands frequently
sport Gothic-sounding names
and feature lots of images of

skulls, blood, vampires, devils,
screaming eagles and bats.
Leather, chains and studs are de
rigeur and tattoos never hu.t.
These metal maniacs play very
loud rock and roll that is consis
tently rebellious in nature.
At its most extreme
(Motorhead, Saxon, Iron
Maiden), Metal Mania's rebell
ion and wall of sound is highly
evocative of hardcore punk
(Black Flag, et al.). Saxon's lead
singer, Biff Byford, remarked in
Melody Maker last year that,
"What people were looking for
in punk, is what they are looking
for in heavy rock. We were the
ones breaking down the barriers
between band and audience,
and we were doing it with com
plete honesty and no b.s." That
is why lots of kids are turning to
heavy metal with a vengeance.
Here are some of this year's
hard-rock releases from old and
new metal maniacs like:
Motorhead
Another Perfect Day
Bronze/Polygram
A change of producers and
guitarists have helped to replace
the muddy wall of sound with a
crisp, high energy classic. Lem
my's rough, gritty singing

doesn't overpower the killer,
screaming guitars as it did on last
year's Iron Fist. "Another Perfect
Day" would make a great single
but the entire offering is a clas
sic. With songs like "Die You
Bastard" and "Dancing on Your
Grave," Motorhead represents
metal mania at its finest ex
tremes. Co see the headhanging
trio next week at the Keystone
Palo Alto.
Lita Ford Band
Out For Blood
Mercury' Polygram
Lita Ford was the guitarist for
the first major all-girls band, The
Runaways, along with Joan Jett.
Her debut as a bandleader fea
tures some excellent guitar licks,
but her vocals are only passable.
"Stay With Me Baby" is a very
hot song, but most of the
songwriting is undistinguished.
Triumph
Never Surrender
RCA
I know this trio plays loud
electric guitars and has scream
ing vocals, but I'll never believe
these guys are true heavy metal
fans. "All the Way" is a decent
song, but last year's Allied
Forces was a much better effort.
