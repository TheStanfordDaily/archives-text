# The 						bare bones of heavy metal
## 
### ERIC POSTEL 
New Wave has achieved gen
eral acceptance and is well on its
way towards controlling main
stream American radio. The
adoption of this music by the
masses guarantees that the
young and restless will turn
elsewhere to express their emo
tions. Many will turn to Heavy
Metal.
Devotees of heavy metal will
say it never left. In some ways
that is true. The '60s saw the
emergence of hard-rock bands
such as Cream, Black Sabbath
and Deep Purple. With the '70s
came the term heavy metal and
bands such as Van Halen,
Aerosmith, Ted Nugent. But
most of those bands are either
long gone, or are playing huge
stadiums and have succumbed
to many of the over-indulgences
that helped to give rise to punk
and new music. However, a
whole new generation of hard
rockers started emerging in En
gland (where else) around 1979
and they are quickly gaining big
followings.
The second generation of
heavy metal bands frequently
sport Gothic-sounding names
and feature lots of images of

skulls, blood, vampires, devils,
screaming eagles and bats.
Leather, chains and studs are de
rigeur and tattoos never hu.t.
These metal maniacs play very
loud rock and roll that is consis
tently rebellious in nature.
At its most extreme
(Motorhead, Saxon, Iron
Maiden), Metal Mania's rebell
ion and wall of sound is highly
evocative of hardcore punk
(Black Flag, et al.). Saxon's lead
singer, Biff Byford, remarked in
Melody Maker last year that,
"What people were looking for
in punk, is what they are looking
for in heavy rock. We were the
ones breaking down the barriers
between band and audience,
and we were doing it with com
plete honesty and no b.s." That
is why lots of kids are turning to
heavy metal with a vengeance.
Here are some of this year's
hard-rock releases from old and
new metal maniacs like:
Motorhead
Another Perfect Day
Bronze/Polygram
A change of producers and
guitarists have helped to replace
the muddy wall of sound with a
crisp, high energy classic. Lem
my's rough, gritty singing

doesn't overpower the killer,
screaming guitars as it did on last
year's Iron Fist. "Another Perfect
Day" would make a great single
but the entire offering is a clas
sic. With songs like "Die You
Bastard" and "Dancing on Your
Grave," Motorhead represents
metal mania at its finest ex
tremes. Co see the headhanging
trio next week at the Keystone
Palo Alto.
Lita Ford Band
Out For Blood
Mercury' Polygram
Lita Ford was the guitarist for
the first major all-girls band, The
Runaways, along with Joan Jett.
Her debut as a bandleader fea
tures some excellent guitar licks,
but her vocals are only passable.
"Stay With Me Baby" is a very
hot song, but most of the
songwriting is undistinguished.
Triumph
Never Surrender
RCA
I know this trio plays loud
electric guitars and has scream
ing vocals, but I'll never believe
these guys are true heavy metal
fans. "All the Way" is a decent
song, but last year's Allied
Forces was a much better effort.

The legions of journey and
Triumph fans will probably like
this, but I can't get excited by
any of this corporate hard rock.
Def Leppard
Pyro mania
Mercury/Polygram
This is what colosseum-style,
melodic heavy metal should be
like — this set cooks. The album
is consistently solid and 3 million
people have already discovered
that "Photograph" is a heavy
metal pop classic — up there
with Van Halen's "Dance the
Night Away" and judas Priest's
"You've Got Another Thing
Coming."
Fastway
Fastway
Columbia
This new trio is a collaboration
between ex-Motorhead guitarist
Fast Eddie Clark, ex-Humble Pie
drummer Jerry Shirley and voc
alist David King. Long on hard
rock experience, these guys
have recorded a debut that is too
long on overdubs and flash, and
too short on originality and good
songs. Fastway is probably
headed for a shortstay.

Coney Hatch
Outa Hand
Mercury/Polygram
This English band, sounding
more like Foreigner-type bands
than any of the heavy metal cult
bands, is very solid and has writ
ten some very good songs (es
pecially "First Time For Every
thing" and "Shake It"). This al
bum, their second, should
garner the band new fans be
cause it is a very respectable of
fering. I just wish side B had
more energy and blistering

guitars.
Krokus
Headhunter
Arista
The screeching vocals and
slashing guitars of this Swiss
quintet are strongly reminiscent
of their Teutonic neighbors,
Scorpions, despite the fact that
this album was produced by
judas Priest's producer. The
band's single, "Screaming in the
Night," is bound to be a big suc
cess and the rest of the album is
equally consistent. With a song

called "Eat the Rich," how could
these metal maniacs miss?
Uriah Heep
Head First
Bronze/Polygram
Tepid, lifeless hard rock from
this aging band. "Lonely Nights"
is an okay rock ballad, but last
year's Abominog was a better
album (though that's not saying
much). Don't old war horses
ever die?
Girlschool
Screaming Blue Murder
Bronze/Polygram

This all-girl heavy metal band
has switched labels again in the
States and this is their third offer
ing. This band is an enigma be
cause they seem to have the po
tential to be prime metallurgists,
but all three albums have proved
to be erratic. "You Cot Me,"
"Screaming Blue Murder" and
ZZ Top's "Tush" are all good
songs, but several others are
pedestrian. Another problem is
that the guitar solos aren't too
hot. This band needs to write
more good songs and get a hot
lead guitarist (like Lita Ford) in
order to reach their full poten
tial. In the meantime, this set of
tunes will do.
Saxon
Power and the Glory
Carrere/CBS
If you used to like hard rock,
but think all heavy metal sounds
the same these days, then Saxon
is foryou. These five Englishmen
frequently eschew the tradi
tional metal motifs in favor of
such diverse subjects as the first
landing on the moon, JFK's as
sassination, extra-terrestrial be
ings, etc. There's lots of fire in
these musicians, but somehow
the production seems to take a
slight edge off their fire.
Nevertheless, this album is a
very solid follow-up to last year's
Strong Arm of the Law.

This new trio is a collaboration
between ex-Motorhead guitarist
Fast Eddie Clark, ex-Humble Pie
drummer Jerry Shirley and voc
alist David King. Long on hard
rock experience, these guys
have recorded a debut that is too
long on overdubs and flash, and
too short on originality and good
songs. Fastway is probably
headed for a shortstay.

Coney Hatch
Outa Hand
Mercury/Polygram
This English band, sounding
more like Foreigner-type bands
than any of the heavy metal cult
bands, is very solid and has writ
ten some very good songs (es
pecially "First Time For Every
thing" and "Shake It"). This al
bum, their second, should
garner the band new fans be
cause it is a very respectable of
fering. I just wish side B had
more energy and blistering

guitars.
Krokus
Headhunter
Arista
The screeching vocals and
slashing guitars of this Swiss
quintet are strongly reminiscent
of their Teutonic neighbors,
Scorpions, despite the fact that
this album was produced by
judas Priest's producer. The
band's single, "Screaming in the
Night," is bound to be a big suc
cess and the rest of the album is
equally consistent. With a song

called "Eat the Rich," how could
these metal maniacs miss?
Uriah Heep
Head First
Bronze/Polygram
Tepid, lifeless hard rock from
this aging band. "Lonely Nights"
is an okay rock ballad, but last
year's Abominog was a better
album (though that's not saying
much). Don't old war horses
ever die?
Girlschool
Screaming Blue Murder
Bronze/Polygram

This all-girl heavy metal band
has switched labels again in the
States and this is their third offer
ing. This band is an enigma be
cause they seem to have the po
tential to be prime metallurgists,
but all three albums have proved
to be erratic. "You Cot Me,"
"Screaming Blue Murder" and
ZZ Top's "Tush" are all good
songs, but several others are
pedestrian. Another problem is
that the guitar solos aren't too
hot. This band needs to write
more good songs and get a hot
lead guitarist (like Lita Ford) in
order to reach their full poten
tial. In the meantime, this set of
tunes will do.
Saxon
Power and the Glory
Carrere/CBS
If you used to like hard rock,
but think all heavy metal sounds
the same these days, then Saxon
is foryou. These five Englishmen
frequently eschew the tradi
tional metal motifs in favor of
such diverse subjects as the first
landing on the moon, JFK's as
sassination, extra-terrestrial be
ings, etc. There's lots of fire in
these musicians, but somehow
the production seems to take a
slight edge off their fire.
Nevertheless, this album is a
very solid follow-up to last year's
Strong Arm of the Law.

New Wave has achieved gen
eral acceptance and is well on its
way towards controlling main
stream American radio. The
adoption of this music by the
masses guarantees that the
young and restless will turn
elsewhere to express their emo
tions. Many will turn to Heavy
Metal.
Devotees of heavy metal will
say it never left. In some ways
that is true. The '60s saw the
emergence of hard-rock bands
such as Cream, Black Sabbath
and Deep Purple. With the '70s
came the term heavy metal and
bands such as Van Halen,
Aerosmith, Ted Nugent. But
most of those bands are either
long gone, or are playing huge
stadiums and have succumbed
to many of the over-indulgences
that helped to give rise to punk
and new music. However, a
whole new generation of hard
rockers started emerging in En
gland (where else) around 1979
and they are quickly gaining big
followings.
The second generation of
heavy metal bands frequently
sport Gothic-sounding names
and feature lots of images of

skulls, blood, vampires, devils,
screaming eagles and bats.
Leather, chains and studs are de
rigeur and tattoos never hu.t.
These metal maniacs play very
loud rock and roll that is consis
tently rebellious in nature.
At its most extreme
(Motorhead, Saxon, Iron
Maiden), Metal Mania's rebell
ion and wall of sound is highly
evocative of hardcore punk
(Black Flag, et al.). Saxon's lead
singer, Biff Byford, remarked in
Melody Maker last year that,
"What people were looking for
in punk, is what they are looking
for in heavy rock. We were the
ones breaking down the barriers
between band and audience,
and we were doing it with com
plete honesty and no b.s." That
is why lots of kids are turning to
heavy metal with a vengeance.
Here are some of this year's
hard-rock releases from old and
new metal maniacs like:
Motorhead
Another Perfect Day
Bronze/Polygram
A change of producers and
guitarists have helped to replace
the muddy wall of sound with a
crisp, high energy classic. Lem
my's rough, gritty singing

doesn't overpower the killer,
screaming guitars as it did on last
year's Iron Fist. "Another Perfect
Day" would make a great single
but the entire offering is a clas
sic. With songs like "Die You
Bastard" and "Dancing on Your
Grave," Motorhead represents
metal mania at its finest ex
tremes. Co see the headhanging
trio next week at the Keystone
Palo Alto.
Lita Ford Band
Out For Blood
Mercury' Polygram
Lita Ford was the guitarist for
the first major all-girls band, The
Runaways, along with Joan Jett.
Her debut as a bandleader fea
tures some excellent guitar licks,
but her vocals are only passable.
"Stay With Me Baby" is a very
hot song, but most of the
songwriting is undistinguished.
Triumph
Never Surrender
RCA
I know this trio plays loud
electric guitars and has scream
ing vocals, but I'll never believe
these guys are true heavy metal
fans. "All the Way" is a decent
song, but last year's Allied
Forces was a much better effort.

The legions of journey and
Triumph fans will probably like
this, but I can't get excited by
any of this corporate hard rock.
Def Leppard
Pyro mania
Mercury/Polygram
This is what colosseum-style,
melodic heavy metal should be
like — this set cooks. The album
is consistently solid and 3 million
people have already discovered
that "Photograph" is a heavy
metal pop classic — up there
with Van Halen's "Dance the
Night Away" and judas Priest's
"You've Got Another Thing
Coming."
