# Luis Bunuel: a laugh stronger than death
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Luis Bunuel died last week, at
the age of 83, 55 years after mak
ing his first film, Un Chien An
dalou, in collaboration with Sal
vador Dali. It is extraordinary to
think that in his debut picture
the young Bunuel managed not
only to find a unique style, but
also to achieve one of the key
succes scandales of ou. century,
and moreover to align himself
with one of its most important
movements, surrealism. By 1928
very few surrealistic experi
ments had actually been at
tempted in movies, and it was
the use of the medium to effect
the odd, jarring juxtapositions
Dali was already creating on
canvas that, as much as the vio
lence and horror of the two most
celebrated images (the slashing
of the eyeball, the maggots eat
ing away at a living man's hand),
disturbed and disoriented audi
ences. But the greatest shock in
Un Chien Andalou was how
funny it was — filmgoers didn't
know how to respond to the
kind of renegade wit that could
first conceive of an image of al
most primal horror and disgust
and then laugh at it.
Through half a century of
filmmaking (his last film, That
Obscure Object of Desire, came
out in 1977), Bunuel's laugh re
mained loud and raucous —
immune to the hushed disap
proval of others who thought
him in bad taste or cringed at his
anticlerical gags and his eternal
jeering at the bourgeois delights
of his audiences. These delights,
Bunuel reasoned cleverly, in
cluded food — in The Exter
minating Angel the guests at a
dinner party cannot escape, and
in The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie the characters move
resolutely from one restaurant
to another in a vain search for
nourishment — and the satisfac
tion of conventions in a work of
art. Much of Bunuel's work can

be seen as a series of jokey re
versals on audience expecta
tions — like his penultimate
film, The Phantom of Liberty, in
which the narrative is an arbi
trary series of anecdotes, each
suggested by a detail in the pre
vious one, or That Obscure Ob
ject of Desire, in which two
women share the central female
role. The same impulse may ac
count for the haphazard look of
some of his movies, as if he just
didn't care about catering to our
predilection for aesthetic plea
sure. This might seem like an ex
cuse for sloppy craftsmanship,
but because Bunuel's movies are
often achingly beautiful — be
cause he could rival Goya in
Land Without Bread and Mag
ritte in Simon of the Desert —

the contrast in visual quality be
tween one film and another
raises the issue of intention.
Not surprisingly, however,
the Bunuel movies we care
about are those that leave startl
ingly clear images in our heads.
Clarity is one of the rules of sur
realism, and often what is most
shocking in a Bunuel film seems
most simple — the abandoned
child and the donkey attacked
by bees in Land Without Bread,
the final image in Los Olvidados
of a boy's body being tossed
down a hill by an old man who
doesn't want to be implicated in
his murder. Bunuel was a sur
realist by temperament, so these
moments seem surrealistic even
though they are brutally realis
tic. Land Without Bread, made in

1932, is such a catalogue of hor
rors that we can hardly believe
that it is in fact a documentary
about a contemporary village in
Bunuel's native Spain — a village
eternally on the brink of starva
tion and so isolated and back
ward it seems medieval.
Of course, many of the most
famous sequences in Bunuel are
truly surrealist in style — not
only his two shorts with Dali, Un
Chien Andalou and L'Age d'Or,
but also the hallucinations in
The Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe and, most extraordinary
of all, the scene in Los Olvidados
in which the slum kid, Pedro,
imagines the wounds in a corpse
bleeding anew and his mother,
who has rejected him, handing
him freshly killed meat. This se
quence, conceived in 1950, has
not lost its power to shock audi
ences, and the film, still the most
extensive and uncompromising
portrayal of the effects of urban
poverty on childhood ever put
on screen, continues to inspire
other gifted directors, such as
Martin Scorsese (Mean Streets)
and the incendiary Brazilian
muckraker Hector Babenco (P/-
xote).
Robinson Crusoe, on the
other hand, ought to be seen by
more people, especially by
those who must confront the
seemingly insurmountable ob
stacles involved in adapting lit
erature to film. The experience
of Bunuel's Robinson Crusoe,
with its towering central per
formance by Dan O'Herlihy, lib
erates you from the shackles of
Defoe's novel because Bunuel
has approached the subject in a
direct, objective way that is not
possible in a first-person narra
tive like Defoe's. Perhaps partly
because the book is a recog
nized part of our common heri
tage even before we've actually
read it — just as the Mona Lisa is
familiar to us through its many
copies and allusions before

we've seen the original —
Bunuel's movie version may af
fect us more profoundly. He
communicates the horror and
melancholy of solitude more viv
idly than Defoe does, and by dis
tancing us from Crusoe, he gets
at the eccentricity of a man left
alone for so many years in a way
Defoe, writing as the voice of
Crusoe's journal, could not.
(One of the finest bits in the
movie, for example, is a shot of
O'Herlihy strolling along the
beach in motley clothes, holding
an umbrella and talking to in
sects.)
Bunuel's refusal to buckle
under to a "classic" is indicative
of his independence of mind.
He never gave in to the demons
he saw in the world he lived in;
he never became one of them. A
late comedy like The Discreet
Charm of the Bourgeoisie, made
when he was in his 70s, still has
the sting of anger that, though
internalized and transformed by
a comic vision, was never com
promised. As far as I know, not a
single one of Bunuel's movies,
good or bad, bears the stain of
sentimentality. He never cush
ioned the shock for us — and
thereby did us the service of re
minding us that we could still be
shocked. Movies can manipu
late and coddle us, like subtle
and experienced whores, but
after Bunuel's movies, which
unseat us and laugh at us, we
feel cleaner than before. It
would take something a hell of a
lot stronger than death to si
lence that laugh.

famous sequences in Bunuel are
truly surrealist in style — not
only his two shorts with Dali, Un
Chien Andalou and L'Age d'Or,
but also the hallucinations in
The Adventures of Robinson
Crusoe and, most extraordinary
of all, the scene in Los Olvidados
in which the slum kid, Pedro,
imagines the wounds in a corpse
bleeding anew and his mother,
who has rejected him, handing
him freshly killed meat. This se
quence, conceived in 1950, has
not lost its power to shock audi
ences, and the film, still the most
extensive and uncompromising
portrayal of the effects of urban
poverty on childhood ever put
on screen, continues to inspire
other gifted directors, such as
Martin Scorsese (Mean Streets)
and the incendiary Brazilian
muckraker Hector Babenco (P/-
xote).
Robinson Crusoe, on the
other hand, ought to be seen by
more people, especially by
those who must confront the
seemingly insurmountable ob
stacles involved in adapting lit
erature to film. The experience
of Bunuel's Robinson Crusoe,
with its towering central per
formance by Dan O'Herlihy, lib
erates you from the shackles of
Defoe's novel because Bunuel
has approached the subject in a
direct, objective way that is not
possible in a first-person narra
tive like Defoe's. Perhaps partly
because the book is a recog
nized part of our common heri
tage even before we've actually
read it — just as the Mona Lisa is
familiar to us through its many
copies and allusions before

we've seen the original —
Bunuel's movie version may af
fect us more profoundly. He
communicates the horror and
melancholy of solitude more viv
idly than Defoe does, and by dis
tancing us from Crusoe, he gets
at the eccentricity of a man left
alone for so many years in a way
Defoe, writing as the voice of
Crusoe's journal, could not.
(One of the finest bits in the
movie, for example, is a shot of
O'Herlihy strolling along the
beach in motley clothes, holding
an umbrella and talking to in
sects.)
Bunuel's refusal to buckle
under to a "classic" is indicative
of his independence of mind.
He never gave in to the demons
he saw in the world he lived in;
he never became one of them. A
late comedy like The Discreet
Charm of the Bourgeoisie, made
when he was in his 70s, still has
the sting of anger that, though
internalized and transformed by
a comic vision, was never com
promised. As far as I know, not a
single one of Bunuel's movies,
good or bad, bears the stain of
sentimentality. He never cush
ioned the shock for us — and
thereby did us the service of re
minding us that we could still be
shocked. Movies can manipu
late and coddle us, like subtle
and experienced whores, but
after Bunuel's movies, which
unseat us and laugh at us, we
feel cleaner than before. It
would take something a hell of a
lot stronger than death to si
lence that laugh.

Luis Bunuel died last week, at
the age of 83, 55 years after mak
ing his first film, Un Chien An
dalou, in collaboration with Sal
vador Dali. It is extraordinary to
think that in his debut picture
the young Bunuel managed not
only to find a unique style, but
also to achieve one of the key
succes scandales of ou. century,
and moreover to align himself
with one of its most important
movements, surrealism. By 1928
very few surrealistic experi
ments had actually been at
tempted in movies, and it was
the use of the medium to effect
the odd, jarring juxtapositions
Dali was already creating on
canvas that, as much as the vio
lence and horror of the two most
celebrated images (the slashing
of the eyeball, the maggots eat
ing away at a living man's hand),
disturbed and disoriented audi
ences. But the greatest shock in
Un Chien Andalou was how
funny it was — filmgoers didn't
know how to respond to the
kind of renegade wit that could
first conceive of an image of al
most primal horror and disgust
and then laugh at it.
Through half a century of
filmmaking (his last film, That
Obscure Object of Desire, came
out in 1977), Bunuel's laugh re
mained loud and raucous —
immune to the hushed disap
proval of others who thought
him in bad taste or cringed at his
anticlerical gags and his eternal
jeering at the bourgeois delights
of his audiences. These delights,
Bunuel reasoned cleverly, in
cluded food — in The Exter
minating Angel the guests at a
dinner party cannot escape, and
in The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie the characters move
resolutely from one restaurant
to another in a vain search for
nourishment — and the satisfac
tion of conventions in a work of
art. Much of Bunuel's work can

be seen as a series of jokey re
versals on audience expecta
tions — like his penultimate
film, The Phantom of Liberty, in
which the narrative is an arbi
trary series of anecdotes, each
suggested by a detail in the pre
vious one, or That Obscure Ob
ject of Desire, in which two
women share the central female
role. The same impulse may ac
count for the haphazard look of
some of his movies, as if he just
didn't care about catering to our
predilection for aesthetic plea
sure. This might seem like an ex
cuse for sloppy craftsmanship,
but because Bunuel's movies are
often achingly beautiful — be
cause he could rival Goya in
Land Without Bread and Mag
ritte in Simon of the Desert —

the contrast in visual quality be
tween one film and another
raises the issue of intention.
Not surprisingly, however,
the Bunuel movies we care
about are those that leave startl
ingly clear images in our heads.
Clarity is one of the rules of sur
realism, and often what is most
shocking in a Bunuel film seems
most simple — the abandoned
child and the donkey attacked
by bees in Land Without Bread,
the final image in Los Olvidados
of a boy's body being tossed
down a hill by an old man who
doesn't want to be implicated in
his murder. Bunuel was a sur
realist by temperament, so these
moments seem surrealistic even
though they are brutally realis
tic. Land Without Bread, made in

1932, is such a catalogue of hor
rors that we can hardly believe
that it is in fact a documentary
about a contemporary village in
Bunuel's native Spain — a village
eternally on the brink of starva
tion and so isolated and back
ward it seems medieval.
Of course, many of the most
famous sequences in Bunuel are
truly surrealist in style — not
only his two shorts with Dali, Un
Chien Andalou and L'Age d'Or,
but also the hallucinations in
