Envoy meets Salvadoran leader
San Salvador, El Salvador — After weeks of maneuv
ering and frustration, presidential envoy Richard
Stone met face-to-face Sunday for the first time with a
key leader of the Salvadoran guerrilla movement. He
and two aides talked for two hours at midday Sunday
with Ruben Zamora, the No. 2 leader of the Re
volutionary Democratic Front, the political arm of the
five Marxist-led guerrilla bands fighting government
forces here.
The meeting was significant because it represented
the first suggestion of possible political accommoda
tion between opponents in a civil war that has
claimed 40,000 lives in less than four years.
Stone has repeatedly sought to meet with political
leaders of the Salvadoran left, all of whom live in
exile, since becoming President Reagan's emissary to
Central America in early |une.
Stone had been unable to arrange a meeting with
the Salvadoran rebel leaders, including Zamora, in
San )ose, Costa Rica, early in July. Stone's assignment
is to encourage participation by the left in national
elections, which will probably be held here around
March, 1984.
In advance of Zamora's meeting with Stone Sun
day, the left had said repeatedly that it wants to
negotiate power-sharing in advance of any election, a
position unacceptable to many of the members of a
nine-man National Political Commission who heard
Stone's report Sunday.
Weapons smuggling decreases
Washington — U.S. intelligence believes the
smuggling of weapons from Nicaragua to leftist guer
rillas in El Salvador has effectively stopped, although
shipments of medicine, communications gear and
some ammunition are still being detected, officials
say.

Administration and congressional sources familiar
with the intelligence data said explanations for the
drop-off vary. Some credit U.S. interdiction efforts
and pressure on the leftist Nicaraguan government,
but others say the Salvadoran guerrillas simply have
all the weapons they need.
The officials, who spoke on condition they not be
identified, said the Salvadoran guerrillas still were
using infiltration routes from Nicaragua to obtain
some "specialty" ammunition, medicines and "top
of-the-line" communications gear.
But the officials said the guerrillas appeared to have
more than enough guns in El Salvador to arm their
estimated 6000 fighters and are able to re-supply by
capturing weapons from government soldiers and by
buying guns on the international black market.
Bush meets with governors
Portland, Maine — Vice President George Bush told
the nation's governors Sunday the answer to rising
budget deficits "cannot possibly be to raise taxes."
But Democratic Gov. Scott Matheson of Utah,
chairman of the governors association, told a news
conference that "we're going to respectfully disagree
with the president" on taxes, and said that if taxes
aren 't increased "we can kiss the recovery goodbye."
The statements by Bush and Matheson reaffirmed
the impasse between the governors and President
Reagan over budget priorities and whether new taxes
are needed to reduce projected budget deficits.
Hours later, Bush told the governors that "some
have argued that since a recovery has begun, we
should raise taxes and increase spending . . .
"We know that the current federal deficits repre
sent a challenge and that when the federal govern
ment engages in its present massive borrowing, it
squeezes resources away from the private sector. But
the answer cannot possibly be to raise taxes and
spend money just as this recovery is gaining strength.

"Instead we must continue to control government
spending and hence foster the government reve
nues."
While the administration and the governors re
mained far apart on budget questions, the state exec
utives approved a position on education that en
dorsed merit pay for teachers, a plan being pushed by
the president.
U.S., China OK trade pact
Washington — The United States and China haved
settled a simmering textile dispute that had soured
other trade relations between the two nations, but
there is little joy among American clothing manufac
turers who had wanted more protection against im
ports.
The new pact, negotiated in Geneva, Switzerland,
ends a seven-month battle that had led the Chinese to
slow or halt imports of various U.S. farm products in
retaliation for actions the American government had
taken to curb a quickly rising stream of textiles to the
United States.
In general, the agreement would put quotas on
Chinese exports of about three dozen textile items to
the United States. But it would still allow those ex
ports to keep growing at rates of 2 percent or more —
the sore point for U.S. manufacturers.
Textile quotas had been in effect for several years,
but negotiations on renewal broke down near the
end of last year. At the urging of domestic textile
manufacturers, U.S. officials imposed their own
quotas on Chinese exports to this country in January.
China retaliated by cutting its farm imports.

the answer cannot possibly be to raise taxes and

U.S., China OK trade pact
Washington — The United States and China haved
settled a simmering textile dispute that had soured
other trade relations between the two nations, but
there is little joy among American clothing manufac
turers who had wanted more protection against im
ports.
The new pact, negotiated in Geneva, Switzerland,
ends a seven-month battle that had led the Chinese to
slow or halt imports of various U.S. farm products in
retaliation for actions the American government had
taken to curb a quickly rising stream of textiles to the
United States.
In general, the agreement would put quotas on
Chinese exports of about three dozen textile items to
the United States. But it would still allow those ex
ports to keep growing at rates of 2 percent or more —
the sore point for U.S. manufacturers.
Textile quotas had been in effect for several years,
but negotiations on renewal broke down near the
end of last year. At the urging of domestic textile
manufacturers, U.S. officials imposed their own
quotas on Chinese exports to this country in January.
China retaliated by cutting its farm imports.
