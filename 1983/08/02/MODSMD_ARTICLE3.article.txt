# Committee staff will investigate Hoover files
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
Congressional investigators
are tentatively planning to arrive
here later this week to begin
their own search of the Reagan
archives at the Hoover Institu
tion.
Staff members of a House
subcommittee and investigators
from the General Accounting
Office plan to look through the
Reagan papers recently
examined by the FBI in search of
pilfered papers from the 1980
Carter campaign.
The House Post Office and
Civil Service subcommittee on
human resources, which is in
vestigating how Carter debate
briefing papers ended up in Rea
gan campaign hands, reached
agreement with the White
House to conduct their search of
the campaign files on Friday
after three weeks of negotia
tions.
)oe Grimes, press secretary to
the subcommittee, said the pre
cise details of the visit are "pre
sently being worked out."
Grimes said the visit could be as
early as this week.
Charles Palm, acting archivist
at the Hoover Institution, said
that a date for the investigators'
arrival will probably be decided
upon tomorrow.
Although the FBI search was
limited to finding evidence of
criminal activity, the subcommit
tee has a broader charge of look
ing for evidence of unethical
conduct.
The agreement between the
White House and the subcom
mittee permits investigators to
review on behalf of the panel the
papers of several former Reagan
campaign workers, including
the White House Chief of Staff
James Baker and CIA Director
William Casey.
The agreement was appar
ently approved by one of three
trustees of campaign archives:
Reagan, presidential counselor
Edwin Meese and Michael De
aver, deputy White House chief
of staff.
Palm needs authorization from
the archives' trustees before he
can permit the investigators to
search the files.
