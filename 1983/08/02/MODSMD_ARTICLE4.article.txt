# Animal research bill could do more harm than good
## 
### KRISHNA WEST 
The purchase or importation
of research animals not bred
specifically for that purpose may
soon become a crime in Califor
nia if a bill authored by a Hol
lywood senator and pushed by
animal rights activists is ap
proved by the State Assembly
Aug. 17.
Sponsored by the Fund for
Animals and Sen. David Roberti
(D-Hollywood), Senate Bill 883
(SB 883) prohibits medical re
searchers from obtaining any
animal — specifically cats and
dogs — from pounds, even
though those animals will
otherwise be destroyed.
Roberti's administrative assis
tant, John Millen, says the bill is
supported by the "signatures of
over 500 doctors, 100 animal wel
fare institutions and a quarter of

a million Californians
statewide." It has already passed
the Senate, and is due fora hear
ing before the Government Or
ganization Committee later this
month.

News Analysis

SB 883 does not prohibit the
experimental useof animalsout
right. But if the bill becomes law,
researchers would be forced to
use specially bred animals that
are considerably more expen
sive than pound animals and ap
parently in scarcer supply. Or,
research institutions would have
to breed their own.
Stanford now spends 3 per
cent of its animal research grants
($2,516,250 in 1980-81) to pur
chase cats and dogs from

pounds. This figure would jump
by 15 percent if the University
were forced to buy the animals
from breeders.
Roberti and his political action
committee, Respect Our Ani
mals' Rights (ROAR), carried a
nearly identical bill to the as
sembly floor last year, but were
defeated by lack of support from
assemblymen who didn't care
for his high pressure tactics. Ac
cording to Jim Bourgart, ad
ministrative assistant to local As
semblyman Robert Naylor,
Roberti held "200 bills that re
quired our attention hostage" to
force the measure thiough.
Millen says Roberti is moti
vated by his concern for the
rights of pets and pet owners,
the support of animal control di
rectors in various counties, and
the "remarkable success" of this

program in the city of Los
Angeles.
But Stuart lamieson, assistant
professor of cardiovascular
surgery here, disagreed. "It's
important to separate the two is
sues. Roberti's bill is to prohibit
the use of pound animals in re
search. The issue of cruelty is an
entirely different thing," he
said. "There should never be
cruelty in research. It is unac
ceptable and cannot be toler
ated."
"We do this research out of
great concern for human be
ings," Jamieson continued.
"Hundreds of patients are alive
today directly because of this re
search."
Seven other states have
passed laws like the one pro
posed in SB 88J. But, according
to Larry Horton, associate vice

president for public affairs,
"other states that have the law,
like New York, prohibit the use
of animals in their state from
their pounds, and buy them
from entrepreneurs who go to
other states and bring them in."
Animal rights activists have
long agitated for the replace
ment of animals used in labora
tory experiments with so-called
alternatives discovered or in
vented through the "miracles of
modern science."
But suitable alternatives are
difficult if not impossible to find
in many cases. Scientists have
always contended that the only
good substitute for a human
subject in research is an animal
— or another human.

species rights have now come
