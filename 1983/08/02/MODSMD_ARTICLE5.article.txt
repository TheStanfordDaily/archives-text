## Severe starvation threatens Ethiopia 
### 
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — Tens
thousands of Ethiopians, mostly
women and children, are
threatened with starvation in the
next few months in a famine that
could become one of the most
catastrophic in African history.
Despite urgent appeals for in
ternational assistance while
there is still time to save
thousands of lives, the United
States, the world's largest
source of surplus food, has vir
tually turned its back on disas
ter.
About 50 to 100 children are
already dying daily, according to
Trevor Page, a United Nations
World Food Program official
who recently toured areas of
northern Ethiopia where the
government and relief agencies
say 3 million people are affected
by drought and 1 million are in
dire need.
Most relief officials think that
the death toll is likely to increase
sharply until the next harvest in
November unless foreign
donors provide emergency food
supplies and massive assistance
in transporation to bring food to
isolated areas.
Some say the toll could ap
proach the 200,000 who died in
the same area a decade ago in
Africa's worst famine. Unlike
that drought, which Emperor
Haile Selassie's government
tried to hide, the military gov
ernment has provided ample
warning and has sought to or
ganize international aid. These
efforts can prevent a major dis
aster if assistance is provided,
officials say.
The relief effort, however, has
been made much more difficult
by ongoing wars that have en
gulfed Eritrea and Tigray pro

vinces and have spilled over into
the other two drought-affected
provinces in the north, Condar
and Welo.
Several guerrilla groups have
been fighting the central gov
ernment for the independence
of Eritrea for 22 years in Africa's
longest war. In Tigray, the re
gion hit worst by drought, the
Tigray People's Liberation front
guerrilla organization claims to
have captured most of the coun
tryside in its struggle for au
tonomy. The Ethiopian govern
ment denies the claim.
The intermingling of famine
and war has made the Ethiopian
drought a classic example on
both the domestic and interna
tional level of the politics of star
vation.
With the government and the
guerrillas jockeying for inter
national aid, the Tigray Front has
charged Ethiopia with diverting
food assistance from the
needy—charges that Ethiopia and
international aid organziations
have strongly denied.
Meanwhile, the United States
has virtually bowed out of its
customary role of providing
humanitarian relief to the starv
ing because of Ethiopia's close
ties to the Soviet Union.
This series will examine the
politics of starvation and its im
pact on millions of people in a
country where hunger is a per
manent fact of life, the only
difference being whether scores
die or tens of thousands, de
pending on the vicissitudes of
nature. Relief officials inter
viewed in Washington, London,
Rome, Ethiopia and elsewhere in
Africa say the Reagan adminstra
tion is putting politics ahead of
humanitarian considerations.

Ethiopia, the closest ally of the
United States in black Africa
until a Marxist revolution over
threw Haile Selassie in 1974, is
now a firm friend of the Soviet
Union, its arms supplier, and
host to about 12,000 Cuban
troops. The military government
in the East African nation is
sharply critical of the United
States, professes a common
ideology with the Soviet Union
and shares another Soviet
trait—an inability to feed its
people without importing food.
A western diplomat said it was
clear that the United States was
not going to provide major as
sistance unless others fail to do
so.

"There is not much inclination
(for the United States) to feed
Ethiopians while the Russians
arm the country and direct it
against the United States," he
said.
Most of the emergency food
aid has been provided by the
U.N. World Food Program, the
European Community and indi
vidual European nations.
In general, that has also been
the policy of the United States.
The diplomat noted the long
standing tradition of such
American humanitarian assist
ance given despite political con
siderations, recalling that in the

19205, under conservative Re
publican leadership, the U.S.
government organized a mas
sive relief effort to overcome a
famine in the Soviet Union even
while Washington refused to
recognize the new Communist
government.
Some western donors have
pointed out to Ethiopian officials
that their Soviet Bloc allies give
them very little food assistance.
"You can't give what you don't
have," said Shimelis Adugna,
until recently the head of the
Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilita
tion Commission.
