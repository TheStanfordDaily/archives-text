# Ideological parting in France
## 
### 
Paris—lt says a lot about France that the main
topic of political conversation right now is what
appears to bean ideological parting of the ways
for the Socialist government and left-wing intel
lectuals.
The past week has seen great chunks of
newsprint devoted to such matters as the fail
ure of any reputable writer to publish a book in
support of President Francois Mitterrand's
two-year-old Socialist experiment and the re
moval of street signs commemorating the leftist
Chilean leader, Salvador Allende. Writers,
journalists, philosophers and presidential ad
visers have been pressed to give their opinion
on what government spokesman Max Gallo de
scribed as "an ideological victory" of the right.
The intensity of the debate, and the emotions
it has unleashed, cannot be attributed simply to
the arrival of a journalistic "silly season" coin
ciding with the summer holidays. Thanks to
France's literary and cultural traditions, intel
lectuals here hold a special moral position that
can be difficult for the Anglo-Saxon mind to
comprehend. And because of their concentra
tion in Paris, with its dominating hold on all
aspects of French life, from politics to the mass
media, they have been a major influence on
public opinion.
Until recently, it was assumed that the French
intelligentsia was predominantly left-wing in
outlook. Its great causes have been leftist: the
Dreyfus affair at the turn of the century, when a
Jewish army officer was unjustly convicted of
treason, Leon Blum's "Popular Front" govern
ment of the late 19205, and the great intellectual
ferment produced by the 1968 student uprising.
All that seems to have changed. To judge by
the latest debate, French writers and philoso
phers value the principle of intellectual inde
pendence above political commitment. Ideol
ogy at least of the traditional left-wing variety
deriving from the works of Karl Marx, is dead.
What is surprising is that this should have
happened under a Socialist administration that
has gone to much greater lengths to pamper

the intelligentsia than any of its right-wing pre
decessors. Asa voracious readerand theauthor
of several books, Mitterrand is himself a French
intellectual of the old school. He is said to enjoy
the company of writers and sociologists.
The Paris newspaper Le Monde, which is to
French intellectuals what The Wall Street Jour
nal is to New York bankers, reported on its
front page this week that writers remain as
eager as ever to accept an invitation for dinner
at the Elysee presidential palace, but no longer
try to draw public attention to the fact.
"It's obviously become a little less chic than
before to be left-wing," said Regis Debray, the
one-time revolutionary who fought alongside
Che Guevara in Bolivia and now selves as an
adviser to Mitterrand on international rela
tions. Earlier this year Debray angered fellow
writers by accusing the host of the popular
literary television show "Apostrophes," Ber
nard Pivoo, of acting like a dictator.
Symbolically, much of the debate over the
place of intellectuals in French life is being
conducted in Le Monde—a newspaper that
can't quite seem to make up its mind about the
Socialist state. Over the past year, Le Monde
has lost a tenth of its readers as it has wavered
between its leftist sympathies and journalistic
objectivity.
By contrast, another left-wing newspaper,
Liberation, has gained circulation, partly be
cause it regards all politicians as fair game.
The Le Monde series on intellectuals was
opened by Gallo, a well-known novelist and
one of the few intellectuals to pin his colors
unequivocally to the Socialist mast. Bemoaning
the "crumbling" of the intellectual left and the
importation of Reaganite ideas from across the
Atlantic, he called on the occupants of literary
salons on the Paris Left Bank to start churning
out some vigorous left-wing thoughts again.
At stake, Gallo wrote grandly, was not merely
"the future success of the political left—but the
very destiny of France."
