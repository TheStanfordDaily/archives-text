# Private university costs rise rapidly
## 
### 
The cost of college in the
United States will jump an aver
age of 10 percent this fall —
nearly triple the rate of
inflation — and the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Tech
nology will top the list of the
nation's most expensive col
leges, with annual fees of more
than $15,000, according to a sur
vey by the College Board.
While students attending pub
lic colleges or universities will
pay an averageof 7 percent more
than they did in the 1982-83
school year, or $4721, those en
rolled in private colleges can ex
pect to pay an average of 11 per
cent more, or $8440.
MIT will cost $15,130, up from
$13,500 last year. The other
schools among the 10 most ex
pensive are Bennington Col
lege, $14,445; Brown, $14,145;
Sarah Lawrence, $14,105;
Dartmouth, $14,093; Stanford,
$14,039, and Columbia, $13,820.
Students attending two-year
public colleges will pay an esti
mated 8 percent more this Sep
tember, or an average of $3400.
Those costs, calculated in the
annual College Board survey,
include tuition and fees, room
and board, books and supplies,
transportation and personal ex
penses.
The jump in college prices is
considerably more than the rate
of U.S. inflation, the study
notes. Consumer prices were up
3.9 percent in 1982 and grew at
only a 3 percent annual rate for

the first five months of this year.
California, fees alone will rise
substantially this fall. In re
sponse to the budget Gov.
George Deukmejian signed this
month, the California State Uni
versity Board of Trustees voted
to increase yearly student fees to
$687, an increase of 36 percent
from last year's level. Including
other expenses, such as books
and room and board, students at
Cal State's 19 campuses can ex
pect to pay $5500 in the coming
academic year, compared to
about $5000 last year.
At the University of California,
fees will rise to $1380, roughly 12
percent above last year's original
level and 5 percent more than
students actually paid after a
mid-year $100 surcharge was
levied to help make up the grow
ing budget deficit. Total costs at
the nine UC campuses, includ
ing required fees and personal
expenses, will range between
$6300 and $7000. Last year, they
ran between nearly $4400 and
$6000.
California's community col
lege fees have yet to be estab
lished, but Deukmejian has
asked legislators to approve the
first tuition fee in the system's
history when they return to Sac
ramento next month. The gov
ernor has proposed that full
time students pay $50 a semes
ter.
