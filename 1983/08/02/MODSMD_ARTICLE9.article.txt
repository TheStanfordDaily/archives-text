## Three cheers for the sinister summer visitors 
### 
May the good Lord have mercy upon us allâ€”but espe
cially on me: the cheerleaders have returned to Stan
ford.
Crossing Escondido road has become truly hazard
ous, as the passing motorists slow down to rubberneck
as if they were pausing to witness the aftermath of a
highway collision between an egg truck and a semi carry
ing a full load of pressurized shaving cream contain
ers. Great flocks of cheerleaders roam the street, paus
ing intermittently to burst into cheer, surely a sight not
to pass unremarked.
Still, I seem to be exceptionally subject to the lure of a
girl in uniform. When I was younger (15 minutes ago,
when last I checked) my goal in life was to be a baseball
player, and thus my idea of a perfect match would have
been something other than a chemical engineer. How
ever, since I've been rather remiss in keeping up my end
of the bargain, things haven't quite worked out that way.
Perhaps because the tendency has been that the
women I've dated stress glamor less than career profi
ciency and fancy themselves less Loni Anderson than
Marie Curie, my obsession is worsening. I can picture
myself being hauled onto the floor of Congress, some 20
years from now, forced to explain my errant behavior
with some 18-year-old cheerleaders. (And if they'd haul
a gas station attendant onto the floor of Congress, you
know he's done something really bad.)
Since idle fantasies are always the safest things, I've
spent my time since Day One, AC (arrival of cheerlead
ers), trying to figure out exactly what they do while
they're here. I'm a bit at a loss here, as I got into Stanford
without ever attending any "youth camps," like the
Leadership Seminar they had here, or the Youth in Gov
ernment model senates. I was once invited to the Young

Men's Socialist Revolutionary Camp,butldidn'tgo,and
I was an alternate to the Future Criminal's Model Mob,
but I had to lie about my qualifications to get even that
far.
I find it hard to picture how cheerleaders exist without
teams to cheer. I can picture them in some deep sub
basement, practicing cheers for no present object but
that seems too reminiscent of 16th century monks clois
tered to pray blindly and continuously for a world they
never get to see. I reject that image, since it would be
just too great a waste if such a thing were to catch on,
and thus squander one of our great resources.
It's too bad they didn't come a week earlier (yes, I
know:"and it's too bad they aren't staying a month
longer") because we could have had a unique con
vergence of two fantasy worlds. Imagine how surrealis
tic it would have been to hold the Corporate Olympics
with random squads of cheerleaders dispersing aimless
bursts of enthusiasm.
That's something that has me worried, there. I've seen
cheerleaders running around in the afternoon emitting
excess enthusiasm like leaky electrical plants. (I've also
heard them going at it at 8:00 in the (expletive deleted)
morning, but that's the price I pay for having Manzanita
park so close to Branner.) Perhaps it's just my alarmist
side, but has anyone noticed the odd weather we've
been having lately?
Frankly, I think these ladies are tampering with forces
far beyond the ken or control of man. Oh, sure, we've all
seen the individual cheerleader, in an ecstasy after a
touchdown or important home run, levitate some 15 or
20 feet, but we dismissed it as joyous exuberance. Yeah,
and we've watched as the cheerleaders un-cheer (boo?
what is the opposite of "cheer") an opposing team, and

then there rapidly follows a fumble or an error: we
rattled 'em, we say, or maybe it was just coincidence.
What if it wasn't coincidence?
What if it was black magic?
Someone is taking the cream of our womenhood,
putting them in small, insular groups and investing them
with unnatural charisma and unearthly powers. Think
about it: have you ever known anyone who stopped
being a cheerleader? No way. There's got to be more to it
than the appeal of a dopey short skirt and memorizing
some trite rhymes. They're after power.
If I were to ever have the chance to get close enough
to check this out, I'm sure I could find some sort of
cabalistic mark upon their bodies. I think everyone, for
their own safety as well as that of the whole world,
should join in an effort to help me in that quest. Soon.
Real soon.
Still, what if I'm wrong? What if they're just a bunch of
civic spirited girls, who just have school pride and a
natural zest for life? What if they are decent, caring
people, nice girls who visit elderly folk in convalescent
hospitals and bring them flowers and cute macrame
knick-knacks? What if they are simply, as wonderful as
they seem to be?
Frankly, they're going to have to prove it to me. I'm
not afraid to face up to such an ordeal. So, I am issuing a
challenge to all the cheerleaders here. I'm not hard to
find: I'm in the phone book,'land I live in the trailer with
the horse's skull in front of the door. Let's get this thing
out into the open.
Ladies, the ball is in your court.
