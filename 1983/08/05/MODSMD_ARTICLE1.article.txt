### KATHY OLMSTED 
A team of congressional inves
tigators arrived here yesterday
afternoon to search the Reagan
archives at the Hoover Insitution
for evidence of papers that
might have been taken from the
1980 Carter presidential cam
paign.
Four staff members of the
human resources subcommittee
of the House Post Office and
Civil Service committee, which
is investigating how Carter de
bate briefing papers wound up
in Reagan campaign hands, and
five representatives of the Gen
eral Accounting Office arrived at
the archives yesterday after
noon.
According to Joseph Grimes, a
spokesman for the subcommit
tee in Washington, the inves
tigators plan to stay about five to
10 days. They will search
through some material originally
searched by FBI agents in July,
but they will also look through
additional material.
The congressional inves
tigators are looking for evidence
of unethical conduct by cam
paign officials. The FBI had a nar
rower charge of looking for evi
dence of criminal activity.
The investigators are uncer
tain exactly how long their
search will take.
"It depends on how long it
takes to review the documents,"
Micah Green, staff director for
the human resources subcom
mittee, said. He added that the
investigators are not going over

"every stitch" of documents in
the Reagan archives.
Hoover archivist Charles Palm
refused to comment on the spe
cifics of the investigators'
search.
"I don't want to talk about
their search," he said yesterday,
noting that all visitors to the arc
hives are entitled to privacy in
their use of the scholarly re
source.
