## Ted Harwood Academic freedom: a closing remark 
### 
First, I would like to compli
ment Don Caughey for his ad
mission that there is room for
conscientious disagreement in
debate (Daily, July 26). I will
make just a few points.
First, contrary to what Don
Caughey claims, there is nothing
in what I have written that
suggests I would not tolerate
Don or anyone else asking "chal
lenging questions about our
political, economic and social
institutions." I suggested that
the loss of nerve by our political
leaders was a regrettable devel
opment and that it posed perils
to the freedoms of those whose
societies were being threatened
by communist revolution. I re
ferred to the ideas and senti
ments on our campuses that
helped to foster this loss of
nerve as "foolish." But foolish
ness is not heresy. I made it very
clear that all ideas and
ideologies could compete freely
in a democracy, including
ideologies such as Naznsm and
Marxism even though they have
proven catastrophically lethal to
populations that have fallen
under their domination. I em
phasized that point because of
my concern over what I dis
cerned in Don's first essay as jus
tifications in defense of intellec
tual intolerance.
Second, Don could not have
aroused my ire with his assertion
that apartheid in South Africa is
un\u<;t ;< he
said and ail that he had said l
would have agreed with him. But
what he in fact said in his first
essay (Daily, lune 21) was that
academic freedom was being
used at Hoover "to defend apart
heid in South Africa," which is
an altogether different state
ment. It is also, I believe, quite
untrue and I challenge him to
find any statement by any
Hoover scholar in defense of
apartheid.
Doubtless what Don was re
ferring to was the fact that some
at Hoover oppose communist

supported guerrilla movements
in South Africa as elsewhere.
Many of us oppose these
movements because we do not
wish to see a greater evil, one
that would be even more de
structive of the liberties of all ra
cial groups, substituted fora les
ser evil. Many of us believe,
further, that the chances for
achieving more humane and
civil libertarian policies will be
much greater in societies where
the Western democracies con
tinue to have leverage than they
will be in societies dominated by
repressive communist elites.
But let's spell out the logic im
plicit in what Don wrote.
"Communist backed guerrillas
oppose Apartheid. Therefore,
any who oppose the com
munists must support Apar
theid." If this reasoning were
correct, then it should also apply
to our own society. Then, by
such reasoning, any in America
who opposed the Communist
Party U.S.A., which was strongly
opposed to ]im Crow laws and
other racist practices in America,
had to have been a supporter of
racism. Vet I am certain Don
would agree that there was noth
ing illogical in the fact that many
Americans opposed both the
communist party and racism.
And if he*agrees with that, then
he should agree that the same
position can be held without
contradiction in the case of
South Africa.
In an earlier letter, Don ex
tended an invitation to meet
with me privately. I appreciate
his gesture of good will and look
forward to talking with him. I
would like now to reciprocate by
inviting him to one of our
Hoover afternoon coffee hours.
I think he'll find us good com
pany and come away with the
realization that we're not such
bad Fellows after all.
