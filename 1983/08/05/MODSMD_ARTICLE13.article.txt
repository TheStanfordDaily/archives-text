## Hoover and SSRL debates receive mixed reviews 
### 
The debate between Donald
Kennedy and |ohn Harris turns,
it is clear, on the question of
faith. In this Harris is closer to
the full truth than president
Kennedy who, with his set
"pluralist" position, has trouble
acknowledging anything that
coherent. It is indeed more than
a question of (pluralistic)
"academic freedom." In the
end, the decision to go ahead
with nuclear weapons research
is a power play, a choice of im
plementing one's faith in the
goodness of our — however
terrifying—cause.
I happen to subscribe to that
cause and for the moment see
no way out of the deep rivalry
imposed upon us (as usual his
torically between great powers)
by fate. But I welcome an oppos
ing voice like Harris' because I
believe that the healthy position
for a university is a balance be
tween the two dimensions of
(vertically or "metaphorically")
faith and (horizonatally or
"metonymically") tolerance.
Similarly, in the Harwood-
Caughey debate, Harwood does
have a faith and does not deny it,
but he also, despite the good
dean's rhetoric, has a profes
sional respect for the views of

others. And in the final analysis,
he seems to have put his finger
on the crucial problem of our
time: how to maintain belief in
ourselves despite our immense
privileges.
It is a law of life for the suc
cessful to flag, tend to self-doubt
and decadence in that sense.
The only way to overcome that
self-destructive bent is to go on
to face specific new challenges,
day by day. A glorious artist in
his prime must, however wear
ily, start another project. Right
now our main national project,
in terms of foreign affairs, is, in
the face of all the sentimen
talities and flacidities recently
castigated by the great Raymond
Aron, to counter the "cancer
ous" but zestful drives of the to
talitarian and anti-cultural
underdogs.
Yet, again, we must care about
the less fortunate and we must
insist on the higher balance and
maintain our humanity and de
cency in the process, as best we
can. This is truly challenging and
a beautiful cause for the youth if
only they could see it, through
the dark trappings of the nuclear
phase of this ages-old evolution
of civilization.

I have not enjoyed the
Caughey-Harwood slanging
match very much. It is becoming
steadily clearer that the issue is
not academic freedom as such;
Caughey fairly clearly believes
that there is a Higher Principle
which must govern academic
freedom, and this could proba
bly be re-phrased in such a way
as to cause Harwood to assent to
it as well. Of course, they dis
agree on what that Principle is.
Indeed, in such a diverse group
of people as Stanford consists
of, it is quite impossible that any
lasting and meaningful agree
ment should be found as to what
such a Principle should be.
The University recognizes this
and refuses to incorporate any
such Principle into its policies.
Peer review and the consciences
of individual faculty members
are the only restraints on the
subject matter of research or
teaching, then, unless some
kind of oversight body comes
into existence empowered to
veto research proposals or
course content. Who should be
on such a body and how many
votes should be required for a
veto?
