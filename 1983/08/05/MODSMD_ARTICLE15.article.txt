## Quake prediction still 10 years away 
### STACEY KERREOS 
San Francisco is overdue for an earthquake, a Stanford pro
fessor told a Terman Auditorium crowd Wednesday night.
Applied Earth Sciences and Geology Prof. Richard Jahns
said that if the "big one" were to hit tomorrow, it would
probably catch scientists by surprise â€” but they might be able
to do something about it.
Within 10 years there should be a reliable way to predict
earthquakes, Jahns said, "but I've been saying that for the past
30 years."
The recent earthquakes in Coalinga could not have been
predicted, Jahns said, but they could have been "forecasted."
Forecasting is a more generalized form of predicting quakes
that is "too complex" to be completely accurate, Jahns said. In
order to accurately predict earthquakes, scientists would need
a much longer geographical history than they now possess for
America.
However, Jahns said that recent experiments in Colorado
may offer scientists a way to make earthquakes less severe.
The experiments indicate that when water is injected into
the earth, it creates an earthshaking turbulence. But when
water is extracted from the earth, the opposite effect takes
place, calming the earth's turbulence.
