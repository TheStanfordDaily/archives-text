# Drell: deterrence policy a necessary evil
## 
### MARC JEFFERSON 
"The sole purpose of nuclear
weapons is to deter nuclear ag
gression," Sidney Drell, deputy
director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC), said
in a speech on the future of the
intercontinental ballistic missile
(ICBM) last night.
Even though deterrence is, in
Drell's opinion, a horrible, im
moral and dangerous policy he
sees no other technical alterna
tive. There is no effective de
fense against a nuclear attack
that cannot be countered or cir
cumvented easily and inexpen
sively, he said.
Without any effective de
fense, the only way of prevent
ing a nuclear war is too use de
terrence, based upon an assured

knowledge of unacceptable and
intolerable destruction, as long
as there are nuclear weapons in
the world.
"I believe that the best policy
for us is to minimize the risk of
nuclear war," he said. In order
to do that, deterrence must be
made to work.
Drell agrees with the Ameri
can Catholic bishops "that de
terrence is not an end in itself,
but it is a morally acceptable pol
icy, as long as we are working for
nuclear disarmament."
On the subject of Russian
physicist Andre Sakharov's open
letter, Drell said he was sur
prised that Sakharov supports
building the MX missile to get
the Soviets worried enough to

negotiate seriously. Drell feels
that the Soviet planners have
enough to worry about, since
they have 75 percent of their nu
clear weapons in vulnerable
ICBMs, and, unlike the United
States, they have little diversity
in their nuclear arsenal.
Drell said that because he be
lieves the present Minuteman
system can be used as a viable
deterrent for many years, he is
content to stay with it. If any
change would be necessary in
our arsenal, Drell would prefer
to build a "Midgetman," with
only one warhead, since it
would be a less valuable target
than an MX. However, he said he
would only support that deci
sion if it were done in an arms
control context.
