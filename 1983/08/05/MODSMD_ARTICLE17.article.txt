# University gears up to fight research bill
## 
### KRISHNA WEST 
Last in a two-part series
If Sacramento lawmakers pass
Senate Bill 883 and outlaw the
use of any pound animals for re
search purposes in California,
they could force Stanford to
spend four to 10 times more a
year for research animals.
And the University is pulling
out all stops to make sure that
doesn't happen.
World-renowned Stanford
cardiologist Norman Shumway
has made rare public appear
ances on television—on ABC's
Nightline and NBC's Today
Show. Shumway also defended
the use of animals in lab re
search at a well-attended press
conference at the University of
California at San Francisco last
month.
Beneficiaries of Stanford's
medical research are loudly
proclaiming testimonials on
their benefactor's behalf. And
the University is engaging in
conferences with politicians
who will determine SB 883's final
fate in the State Assembly.
Stanford is not alone in fight
ing the legislation: a University
of California study says institu
tional costs in 12 universities in
the state for acquiring these
animals will more than quad
ruple to $4.05 million a year if the
bill becomes law. Researchers
say pounds will lose an impor
tant source of revenue and that
the prohibition may foster a con
traband animal piracy industry.

Backed by Senate President
Pro Tern David Roberti (D-
Hollywood), his political action
committee, Respect Our Ani
mals' Rights (ROAR), the Fund
for Animals and more than
250,000 Californians, SB 883 os
tensibly aims to protect aban
doned and lost pets by making
the use of any but "purpose
bred" animals a misdeameanor
punishable by a fine of $500.
Such laws are already en
forced in some cities and coun
ties in California.
In addition, eight states in the
country prohibit what the Fund
for Animals calls "pound sei
zure," the release of any pound
animal for research. But whereas
researchers in these states can
purchase pound animals from
other places, SB 883 would com
pletely ban the use of any pound
animals for research in Califor
nia.
Scheduled to appear before
the Assembly Committee on
Government Affairs on Aug. 17,
SB 883 embraces all types of
animals sheltered in pounds,
and specifically names cats and
dogs in its most recent form.
Actually, though, less than 3
percent of America's unwanted
cats and dogs were used for re
search last year. California re
searchers purchased 10,000 of
these pound animals.
Under SB 883, research in
stitutions could also raise their
own purpose-bred animals. But
as there are no commercial

breeders on the West Coast at
present, facilities for starting
breeding colonies would have to
be constructed from scratch at
the cost of $12 million, accord
ing to the UC study. Annual
operating costs for institutional
breeding colonies, the study
states, would be $8 million.
In addition, opponents of the
bill claim that scientific progress
would be retarded as a conse
quence of SB 883's becoming
law.
At the UCSF press conference,
Shumway said that Great Brit
ain's heavy restrictions on the
use of pound animals in re
search has seriously delayed that
nation's advances in cardiac
surgery.
Shumway's pioneer experi
ments here on dogs led to the
first successful heart transplant
in 1959 and, later, to the first per
fection of lung transplantation
techniques. The UC study says
that present experiments on lab
animals could lead to break
throughs in discovering cures
for cancer and for acquired im
mune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS).
Stuart lamieson, assistant pro
fessor of cardiovascular surgery,
said that if pound animals can
not be experimented upon,
"our research will become ex
pensive, and we'll have to cut
back on research— which
means making less progress."
The University Office of Public
Affairs has quoted Jamieson as

saying that the proponents of
SB 883 "should realize that its
passage will result in the need
less loss of human lives. . .
Organ transplantation has made
tremendous advances as a result
of research with pound animals.
If this bill had been passed 20
years ago, many hundreds of
people alive today would have
died from irreversible organ
failure."
Politicians pushing for all
encompassing animal welfare
laws have traditionally encoun
tered rough sailing in legislative
waters. But the dynamic Roberti,
using his influence as then Sen
ate majority leader, managed to
pressure his colleagues into giv
ing his pet bill top priority last
session, only to watch it die for
lack of support on the Assembly
floor.
Local Assemblymen Byron
Sher (D-Palo Alto) and Robert
Naylor (R-Menlo Park) were
among those who voted against
the bill last year: they didn't care
for Roberti's manipulative tac
tics. But University officials be
lieve that the bill's emojional
appeal to "people who don't
fully understand the issues and
would normally consider it ab
surd" could now make its
chances for success excellent.
Researchers fear this as the
first step towards a total ban on
research using lab animals in
California—even though the
bill's proponents say that has not
been their intention.

Cautiously appraising his
superior's views on the subject,
Naylor's administrative assis
tant, Jim Bourgart, said, "Bob
feels the medical research done
using these animals is impor
tant. He does not favor experi
ments done on animals for
pointless reasons."
Since unclaimed pound ani
mals will never be put out to
pasture, he said the choice is
"between putting them to death
or using them for medical ex
perimentation."
John Millen, administrative
assistant to Roberti, said that
most of the animals in the
pounds today are strays that
have wandered from home and
often cannot be identified
within three days, after which
time the animals are either sold
to labs or euthanized.
Researchers are amenable to
compromises such as legislation
mandating permanent pet iden
tification tattoos, prohibiting the
laboratory use of animals bear
ing such marks and extending
the pounds' pet claimant cur
few. But Roberti has thus far re
mained adamant in his de
mands, willing to give no quar
ter.
The Fund for Animals move
ment compares research labs to
Nazi concentration camps and
equates pound animals to aban
doned children. Millen said SB
883 proposes "cleaner ('though
not much better' he conceded),
more humanistic methods of re
search."
Actress Gretchen Wyler, vice
president of the Fund for Ani
mals, charged Stanford labora
tories with cruel mistreatment of
animals in pain research. The
University denied these allega
tions, attesting that all
animals—9s percent of which
are rodents—which may be ex
posed to pain are sedated with
anesthesia and other drugs to re
lieve pain.
Stanford lost accreditation by
the American Association of Ac
creditation for Laboratory Ani
mal Care (AAALAC), a private
agency, because four areas of its
animal facilities needed repair.
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs, said
those repairs have been made,
but Stanford made a "deliberate
decision to forgo" AAALAC's
"high standards" of accredita
tion until construction of a new
$12 million animal care facility is
completed.
Calling SB 88.3's proponents
"hypocritical" because they
seem to be willing to expose
animals other than their pets to
experimentation, surgeon
lamieson said, "From the practi

cal point of view alone, it serves
our interests to treat these ani
mals as well as we possibly can,
because we want long-term
healthy survivors."
He refuted the "schizophre
nic Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde" re
searcher image being projected
by the animal rights activists, ex
plaining that those who have
"dedicated (their) lives to reliev
ing pain and suffering" would
never inflict pain on members of
another species.
Roberti's coalition, on the
other hand, questions the
humane value of the animals'
continued existence when they
have to spend their lives chained
to machines monitoring their
minutest movements. Millen
added that researchers used
cheap pound animals capri
ciously.
Researchers have been ac
cused of unnecessary duplica
tion of animal experimentation
before. They still answer with
the same standard justification
that experiments must be re
peated in order to obtain reli
able statistical results.
They say random-source
mongrel pound animals are just
as important to research as
purpose-bred animals because,
as Shumway pointed out on
network television last week,
"man is a mongrel."

the bill last year: they didn't care
for Roberti's manipulative tac

lieve that the bill's emojional
appeal to "people who don't
fully understand the issues and
would normally consider it ab
surd" could now make its
chances for success excellent.
Researchers fear this as the
first step towards a total ban on
research using lab animals in
California—even though the
bill's proponents say that has not
been their intention.

Cautiously appraising his
superior's views on the subject,
Naylor's administrative assis
tant, Jim Bourgart, said, "Bob
feels the medical research done
using these animals is impor
tant. He does not favor experi
ments done on animals for
pointless reasons."
Since unclaimed pound ani
mals will never be put out to
pasture, he said the choice is
"between putting them to death
or using them for medical ex
perimentation."
John Millen, administrative
assistant to Roberti, said that
most of the animals in the
pounds today are strays that
have wandered from home and
often cannot be identified
within three days, after which
time the animals are either sold
to labs or euthanized.
Researchers are amenable to
compromises such as legislation
mandating permanent pet iden
tification tattoos, prohibiting the
laboratory use of animals bear
ing such marks and extending
the pounds' pet claimant cur
few. But Roberti has thus far re
mained adamant in his de
mands, willing to give no quar
ter.
The Fund for Animals move
ment compares research labs to
Nazi concentration camps and
equates pound animals to aban
doned children. Millen said SB
883 proposes "cleaner ('though
not much better' he conceded),
more humanistic methods of re
search."
Actress Gretchen Wyler, vice
president of the Fund for Ani
mals, charged Stanford labora
tories with cruel mistreatment of
animals in pain research. The
University denied these allega
tions, attesting that all
animals—9s percent of which
are rodents—which may be ex
posed to pain are sedated with
anesthesia and other drugs to re
lieve pain.
Stanford lost accreditation by
the American Association of Ac
creditation for Laboratory Ani
mal Care (AAALAC), a private
agency, because four areas of its
animal facilities needed repair.
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs, said
those repairs have been made,
but Stanford made a "deliberate
decision to forgo" AAALAC's
"high standards" of accredita
tion until construction of a new
$12 million animal care facility is
completed.
Calling SB 88.3's proponents
"hypocritical" because they
seem to be willing to expose
animals other than their pets to
experimentation, surgeon
lamieson said, "From the practi

cal point of view alone, it serves
our interests to treat these ani
mals as well as we possibly can,
because we want long-term
healthy survivors."
He refuted the "schizophre
nic Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde" re
searcher image being projected
by the animal rights activists, ex
plaining that those who have
"dedicated (their) lives to reliev

never inflict pain on members of
another species.
Roberti's coalition, on the
other hand, questions the
humane value of the animals'
continued existence when they
have to spend their lives chained
to machines monitoring their
minutest movements. Millen
added that researchers used
cheap pound animals capri
ciously.
Researchers have been ac
cused of unnecessary duplica
tion of animal experimentation
before. They still answer with
the same standard justification
that experiments must be re

able statistical results.
They say random-source

If Sacramento lawmakers pass
Senate Bill 883 and outlaw the
use of any pound animals for re
search purposes in California,
they could force Stanford to
spend four to 10 times more a
year for research animals.
And the University is pulling
out all stops to make sure that
doesn't happen.
World-renowned Stanford
cardiologist Norman Shumway
has made rare public appear
ances on television—on ABC's
Nightline and NBC's Today
Show. Shumway also defended
the use of animals in lab re
search at a well-attended press
conference at the University of
California at San Francisco last
month.
Beneficiaries of Stanford's
medical research are loudly
proclaiming testimonials on
their benefactor's behalf. And
the University is engaging in
conferences with politicians
who will determine SB 883's final
fate in the State Assembly.
Stanford is not alone in fight
ing the legislation: a University
of California study says institu
tional costs in 12 universities in
the state for acquiring these
animals will more than quad
ruple to $4.05 million a year if the
bill becomes law. Researchers
say pounds will lose an impor
tant source of revenue and that
the prohibition may foster a con
traband animal piracy industry.

Backed by Senate President
Pro Tern David Roberti (D-
Hollywood), his political action
committee, Respect Our Ani
mals' Rights (ROAR), the Fund
for Animals and more than
250,000 Californians, SB 883 os
tensibly aims to protect aban
doned and lost pets by making
the use of any but "purpose
bred" animals a misdeameanor
punishable by a fine of $500.
Such laws are already en
forced in some cities and coun
ties in California.
In addition, eight states in the
country prohibit what the Fund
for Animals calls "pound sei
zure," the release of any pound
animal for research. But whereas
researchers in these states can
purchase pound animals from
other places, SB 883 would com
pletely ban the use of any pound
animals for research in Califor
nia.
Scheduled to appear before
the Assembly Committee on
Government Affairs on Aug. 17,
SB 883 embraces all types of
animals sheltered in pounds,
and specifically names cats and
dogs in its most recent form.
Actually, though, less than 3
percent of America's unwanted
cats and dogs were used for re
search last year. California re
searchers purchased 10,000 of
these pound animals.
Under SB 883, research in
stitutions could also raise their
own purpose-bred animals. But
as there are no commercial

breeders on the West Coast at
present, facilities for starting
breeding colonies would have to
be constructed from scratch at
the cost of $12 million, accord
ing to the UC study. Annual
operating costs for institutional
breeding colonies, the study
states, would be $8 million.
In addition, opponents of the
bill claim that scientific progress
would be retarded as a conse
quence of SB 883's becoming
law.
At the UCSF press conference,
Shumway said that Great Brit
ain's heavy restrictions on the
use of pound animals in re
search has seriously delayed that
nation's advances in cardiac
surgery.
Shumway's pioneer experi
ments here on dogs led to the
first successful heart transplant
in 1959 and, later, to the first per
fection of lung transplantation
techniques. The UC study says
that present experiments on lab
animals could lead to break
throughs in discovering cures
for cancer and for acquired im
mune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS).
Stuart lamieson, assistant pro
fessor of cardiovascular surgery,
said that if pound animals can
not be experimented upon,
"our research will become ex
pensive, and we'll have to cut
back on research— which
means making less progress."
The University Office of Public
Affairs has quoted Jamieson as

saying that the proponents of
SB 883 "should realize that its
passage will result in the need
less loss of human lives. . .
Organ transplantation has made
tremendous advances as a result
of research with pound animals.
If this bill had been passed 20
years ago, many hundreds of
people alive today would have
died from irreversible organ
failure."
Politicians pushing for all
encompassing animal welfare
laws have traditionally encoun
tered rough sailing in legislative
waters. But the dynamic Roberti,
using his influence as then Sen
ate majority leader, managed to
pressure his colleagues into giv
ing his pet bill top priority last
session, only to watch it die for
lack of support on the Assembly
floor.
Local Assemblymen Byron
Sher (D-Palo Alto) and Robert
Naylor (R-Menlo Park) were
among those who voted against
the bill last year: they didn't care
for Roberti's manipulative tac
