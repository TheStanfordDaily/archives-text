## Future is sunny for grad's solar firm 
### CAROL PUTNAM 
FAFCO Solar Energy Sales is
located in Sunnyvale on a four
lane side street, lined with mod
ern office buildings and well
groomed lawns. All the streets in
Sunnyvale, the heart of Silicon
Valley, are like that: uncluttered
with plenty of room for growth.
Inside FAFCO's reception area
above the secretary's desk, a
sign reads, "Congratulations! 16
SALES last week. Beat it next
week!"
FAFCO, the oldest solar com
pany in this area, lost money last
year, but Stanford graduate John
Mack, manager in the energy
conservation department,
smiled when I asked how busi
ness is going.
"We may have the best month
ever. We're coming out of the
recession and people are buy
ing."
What people are buying is the
FAFCO 444 Solar Hot Water
Heater, a passive, integral
collector-storage system. This
system is revolutionary in two
ways: First, a conventional solar
hot water heater uses a collector
on the roof to heat the water and
a separate tank inside the house
for storage. FAFCO's new sys
tem combines the collector and
storage parts into one unit which
sits on the roof - thus the term
integral collector-storage svs
tem.
Second, a conventional solar
heating system requires control
mechanisms, such as pumps,
controller valves and freeze pro
tection, necessary to actively
move water through the system.
These mechanisms are prone to
failure and often require addi
tional maintenance. The 444
eliminates these active elements
and needs "no more mainte
nance than plumbing," Mack
said.
In designing their model, Mack
says that FAFCO's engineers
strove to produce a model that
was 1 )aesthetically pleasing, 2)-
maintenance free, 3)cost
effective in energy saved per
dollar of investment, 4)fully war
ranted for five years, and 5)-
reasonably priced. Jay Maggard,
product engineer at FAFCO's
manufacturing office in Menlo

Park, admits that the finished
product, which meets these re
quirements, isbasicallyasophis
ticated bread box. What makes it
special is the material used.
The four-by-10 collector is
made from galvanized steel,
chosen for its light weight and
efficient heat transfer, painted

with polyurethane paint. En
cased inside the steel box, a
plastic "air mattress" holds the
water. FAFCO used its expertise
in plastic pool collectors to de
velop this material and
strengthened it with polymer
films, tedlar and teflon to pro
duce a "selective surface."
Such a surface enables 92 per
cent of the sun's heat to be ab
sorbed during the day and
radiates only about 20 percent of
its heat back at night. This
minimized night-time cooling
and heat loss, which are the
biggest problems with this sys
tem's cost-effectiveness.
"We don't make a claim,"
Maggard said, specifically about
how many BTUs or dollars are
saved per dollar of investment.
"What we do say is that in this
area, a normal family of four can
save over half their natural gas
bill, on the average, over a
year."
Maggard said, however, that
every family is different and their
hot water loads differ. A family
that showers at night after the
water has had a chance to heat
up all day will save more than a

family that showers at six in the
morning when the water has
been cooling off all night.
"If they'll shift their load,
they'll do better," Maggard said,
"but that's up to them."
Maggard emphasized the
point that the 444 will still save
energy: "Even if the collector
isn't at 120 degrees, you will still
save energy if the water is deliv
ered to your gas heater at 80 or
90 degrees and has to boost it to
120 degrees." Without the sys
tem, the water would have to be
heated from 40 or 50 degrees to
120 or 140 degrees by your gas
heater.
There will, of course, be some
seasonal variation, but Maggard
said that on the average, over a
year, a family's hot water heating
bill will be reduced by about
half.
Another potential problem
with the integral system is its
weight on the roof. When filled
with water, the 65 gallon tank
weighs 675 pounds. Maggard
said that by sizing the collector
at four-by-10 feet, the weight is
distributed over the roof and
does not cause problems.
FAFCO had several consul
tants draw up roof construction
details that would accomodate
the weight. In most cases there
is no additional construction re
quired; "sometimes just a bit of
bracing," Maggard said.
The 444 has a full five-year
warranty and a ten-year limited
warranty. Its cost is $3500, com
pared to $5000 for the conven
tional system.
"We'll provide 12.9 percent
financing, which comestoabout
$75.00 a month," Mack said.
"We've already sold fifty. It's
crazy not to buy a solar system
now."
Although state credits were
recently dropped by five per
cent, California still has the na
tion's largest solar incentive
program: a 50 percent com
bined state and federal tax credit
on the cost of buying and install
ing a solar system. With this
plan, the California Energy
Commission projects that 50
percent of California's homes
will have solar systems by 1995.
Pacific Gas and Electric also
provides incentive with its "ZIP"
loans for conservation. Through
the Zero Interest Loan Program,
PC.&E will loan customers the
money to install conservation
materials—a water heater jacket,
weather stripping, and
insulation—interest free with a

pay back period of over 50
months.
"It was 10 years ago that I first
suggested granting tax credits
for energy conservation," state
Senator William Cohen said. "I
was almost laughed off the floor.
We've come a long way. Now we
realize that it is not only people
who are whitewater canoists or
butterfly chasers who are con
cerned about energy, but
people from all parts of the polit
ical spectrum."
"Solar is moving from a parti
san to a bipartisan business,"
Mack said. "When conservative
republicans argue that a 'real'
business shouldn't need tax in
centives to remain viable, I re
mind them of the billions of dol
lars we give each year to petro
leum, gas, coal and nuclear in
dustries."
In fact, FAFCO sells more solar
systems to wealthier, more con
servative buyers than to liberal,
hippie types. This is partly be
cause FAFCOs first product in
1969 was a solar pool heater. A
potential buyer had to first af
ford a swimming pool.

FAFCO made "lots of mis
takes" in its first three years,
Mack said. But they wanted to
establish themselves in the mar
ket. When their plastic pool
heaters sprang leaks, FAFCO
went back and replaced them at
no charge to their customers. In
1973, they had come up with a
better design and guaranteed it
for one year. By 1976, FAFCO
controlled overso percent of the
market, and came out with
another improved model and a
five-year warranty. Each time
they came out with a better
model, FAFCO went back to
their customers and replaced
the old model.

In 1977, the company sold its
distribution (now FAFCO Solar
Energy Sales, a separate com
pany) and bought the raw mate
rials to produce a 10-year war
ranted plastic pool heater with
the "best efficiency rating suited
to a pool environment." FAFCO
returned to their old customers
and installed the final product,
charging only the cost of materi
als.
1979 saw the peak of the solar
pool heating market. Mack cites
the Iranian revolution, the en
ergy crisis, the rising cost of nat
ural gas and the ban on the use
of natural gas to heat pools as
contributing factors to the high
sales rate. As the pool heating
market began to fade, FAFCO
needed to expand its product
line to remain viable.
After going public in late 1980,
FAFCO came out with what
Mack calls their "me too" prod
uct: a conventional, domestic
solar hot water heating system.
Other solar companies already
sold similar systems, but FAFCO
also "made a major commitment
to produce a new heating system
by mid 1983," Mack said.
"We saw a decline in sales in
1980, but broke even. We did
lose money last year, but didn't
go out of business like a lot of
our competitors."
True to its commitment, the
444 solar hot water heater is on
the market.
"We're still playing with it,"
Maggard said, who also denies
allegations that the system will
discredit the solar industry be
cause of its inefficiencies. "It will
definitely save money and en
ergy."
As to the future of solar, Mack
is characteristically optimistic.
"Solar looks good," he said.
"It's a business with an inher
ently political side to it. Solar is
very organized with good grass
roots structure and conservative
backing as well."
While he admits that if thecur
rent federal tax credits (which
expire at the end of 1985) are not
renewed, the solar industry
would be severely affected,
Mack doesn't feel this will hap
pen. FAFCO is involved at both
state and federal levels, lobby
ing for renewal of the credits.
Freeman Ford, founder of
FAFCO and MBA graduate from
Stanford, is acting president of
the Solar Industry Association in
Washington, D.C. and actively
working to extend the credits to
1990.

FAFCO Solar Energy Sales is

SALES last week. Beat it next

FAFCO, the oldest solar com

Mack, manager in the energy
conservation department,
smiled when I asked how busi
ness is going.
"We may have the best month
ever. We're coming out of the
recession and people are buy
ing."
What people are buying is the
FAFCO 444 Solar Hot Water
Heater, a passive, integral
collector-storage system. This
system is revolutionary in two
ways: First, a conventional solar
hot water heater uses a collector
on the roof to heat the water and
a separate tank inside the house
for storage. FAFCO's new sys
tem combines the collector and
storage parts into one unit which
sits on the roof - thus the term
integral collector-storage svs
tem.
Second, a conventional solar
heating system requires control
mechanisms, such as pumps,
controller valves and freeze pro
tection, necessary to actively
move water through the system.
These mechanisms are prone to
failure and often require addi
tional maintenance. The 444
eliminates these active elements
and needs "no more mainte
nance than plumbing," Mack
said.
In designing their model, Mack
says that FAFCO's engineers
strove to produce a model that
was 1 )aesthetically pleasing, 2)-
maintenance free, 3)cost
effective in energy saved per
dollar of investment, 4)fully war
ranted for five years, and 5)-
reasonably priced. Jay Maggard,
product engineer at FAFCO's
manufacturing office in Menlo

Park, admits that the finished
product, which meets these re
quirements, isbasicallyasophis
ticated bread box. What makes it
special is the material used.
The four-by-10 collector is
made from galvanized steel,
chosen for its light weight and
efficient heat transfer, painted

with polyurethane paint. En
cased inside the steel box, a
plastic "air mattress" holds the
water. FAFCO used its expertise
in plastic pool collectors to de
velop this material and
strengthened it with polymer
films, tedlar and teflon to pro
duce a "selective surface."
Such a surface enables 92 per
cent of the sun's heat to be ab
sorbed during the day and
radiates only about 20 percent of
its heat back at night. This
minimized night-time cooling
and heat loss, which are the
biggest problems with this sys
tem's cost-effectiveness.
"We don't make a claim,"
Maggard said, specifically about
how many BTUs or dollars are
saved per dollar of investment.
"What we do say is that in this
area, a normal family of four can
save over half their natural gas
bill, on the average, over a
year."
Maggard said, however, that
every family is different and their
hot water loads differ. A family
that showers at night after the
water has had a chance to heat
up all day will save more than a

family that showers at six in the
morning when the water has
been cooling off all night.
"If they'll shift their load,
they'll do better," Maggard said,
"but that's up to them."
Maggard emphasized the
point that the 444 will still save
energy: "Even if the collector
isn't at 120 degrees, you will still
save energy if the water is deliv
ered to your gas heater at 80 or
90 degrees and has to boost it to
120 degrees." Without the sys
tem, the water would have to be
heated from 40 or 50 degrees to
120 or 140 degrees by your gas
heater.
There will, of course, be some
seasonal variation, but Maggard
said that on the average, over a
year, a family's hot water heating
bill will be reduced by about
half.
Another potential problem
with the integral system is its
weight on the roof. When filled
with water, the 65 gallon tank
weighs 675 pounds. Maggard
said that by sizing the collector
at four-by-10 feet, the weight is
distributed over the roof and
does not cause problems.
FAFCO had several consul
tants draw up roof construction
details that would accomodate
the weight. In most cases there
is no additional construction re
quired; "sometimes just a bit of
bracing," Maggard said.
The 444 has a full five-year
warranty and a ten-year limited
warranty. Its cost is $3500, com
pared to $5000 for the conven
tional system.
"We'll provide 12.9 percent
financing, which comestoabout
$75.00 a month," Mack said.
"We've already sold fifty. It's
crazy not to buy a solar system
now."
Although state credits were
recently dropped by five per
cent, California still has the na
tion's largest solar incentive
program: a 50 percent com
bined state and federal tax credit
on the cost of buying and install
ing a solar system. With this
plan, the California Energy
Commission projects that 50
percent of California's homes
will have solar systems by 1995.
Pacific Gas and Electric also
provides incentive with its "ZIP"
loans for conservation. Through
the Zero Interest Loan Program,
PC.&E will loan customers the
money to install conservation
materials—a water heater jacket,
weather stripping, and
insulation—interest free with a

pay back period of over 50
months.
"It was 10 years ago that I first
suggested granting tax credits
for energy conservation," state
Senator William Cohen said. "I
was almost laughed off the floor.
We've come a long way. Now we
realize that it is not only people
who are whitewater canoists or
butterfly chasers who are con
cerned about energy, but
people from all parts of the polit
ical spectrum."
"Solar is moving from a parti
san to a bipartisan business,"
Mack said. "When conservative
republicans argue that a 'real'
business shouldn't need tax in
centives to remain viable, I re
mind them of the billions of dol
lars we give each year to petro
leum, gas, coal and nuclear in
dustries."
In fact, FAFCO sells more solar
systems to wealthier, more con
servative buyers than to liberal,
hippie types. This is partly be
cause FAFCOs first product in
1969 was a solar pool heater. A
potential buyer had to first af
ford a swimming pool.

FAFCO made "lots of mis
takes" in its first three years,
Mack said. But they wanted to
establish themselves in the mar
ket. When their plastic pool
heaters sprang leaks, FAFCO
went back and replaced them at
no charge to their customers. In
1973, they had come up with a
better design and guaranteed it
for one year. By 1976, FAFCO
controlled overso percent of the
market, and came out with
another improved model and a
five-year warranty. Each time
they came out with a better
model, FAFCO went back to
their customers and replaced
the old model.

In 1977, the company sold its
distribution (now FAFCO Solar
Energy Sales, a separate com
pany) and bought the raw mate
rials to produce a 10-year war
ranted plastic pool heater with
the "best efficiency rating suited
to a pool environment." FAFCO
returned to their old customers
and installed the final product,
charging only the cost of materi
als.
1979 saw the peak of the solar
pool heating market. Mack cites
the Iranian revolution, the en
ergy crisis, the rising cost of nat
ural gas and the ban on the use
of natural gas to heat pools as
contributing factors to the high
sales rate. As the pool heating
market began to fade, FAFCO
needed to expand its product
line to remain viable.
After going public in late 1980,
FAFCO came out with what
Mack calls their "me too" prod
uct: a conventional, domestic
solar hot water heating system.
Other solar companies already
sold similar systems, but FAFCO
also "made a major commitment
to produce a new heating system
by mid 1983," Mack said.
"We saw a decline in sales in
1980, but broke even. We did
lose money last year, but didn't
go out of business like a lot of
our competitors."
True to its commitment, the
444 solar hot water heater is on
the market.
"We're still playing with it,"
Maggard said, who also denies
allegations that the system will
discredit the solar industry be
cause of its inefficiencies. "It will
definitely save money and en
ergy."
As to the future of solar, Mack
is characteristically optimistic.
"Solar looks good," he said.
"It's a business with an inher
ently political side to it. Solar is
very organized with good grass
roots structure and conservative
backing as well."
While he admits that if thecur
rent federal tax credits (which
expire at the end of 1985) are not
renewed, the solar industry
would be severely affected,
Mack doesn't feel this will hap
pen. FAFCO is involved at both
state and federal levels, lobby
ing for renewal of the credits.
Freeman Ford, founder of
FAFCO and MBA graduate from
Stanford, is acting president of
the Solar Industry Association in
Washington, D.C. and actively
working to extend the credits to
1990.

FAFCO Solar Energy Sales is
located in Sunnyvale on a four
lane side street, lined with mod
ern office buildings and well
groomed lawns. All the streets in
Sunnyvale, the heart of Silicon
Valley, are like that: uncluttered
with plenty of room for growth.
Inside FAFCO's reception area
above the secretary's desk, a
sign reads, "Congratulations! 16
SALES last week. Beat it next
week!"
FAFCO, the oldest solar com
pany in this area, lost money last
year, but Stanford graduate John
Mack, manager in the energy
conservation department,
smiled when I asked how busi
ness is going.
"We may have the best month
ever. We're coming out of the
recession and people are buy
ing."
What people are buying is the
FAFCO 444 Solar Hot Water
Heater, a passive, integral
collector-storage system. This
system is revolutionary in two
ways: First, a conventional solar
hot water heater uses a collector
on the roof to heat the water and
a separate tank inside the house
for storage. FAFCO's new sys
tem combines the collector and
storage parts into one unit which
sits on the roof - thus the term
integral collector-storage svs
tem.
Second, a conventional solar
heating system requires control
mechanisms, such as pumps,
controller valves and freeze pro
tection, necessary to actively
move water through the system.
These mechanisms are prone to
failure and often require addi
tional maintenance. The 444
eliminates these active elements
and needs "no more mainte
nance than plumbing," Mack
said.
In designing their model, Mack
says that FAFCO's engineers
strove to produce a model that
was 1 )aesthetically pleasing, 2)-
maintenance free, 3)cost
effective in energy saved per
dollar of investment, 4)fully war
ranted for five years, and 5)-
reasonably priced. Jay Maggard,
product engineer at FAFCO's
manufacturing office in Menlo

Park, admits that the finished
product, which meets these re
quirements, isbasicallyasophis
ticated bread box. What makes it
special is the material used.
The four-by-10 collector is
made from galvanized steel,
chosen for its light weight and
efficient heat transfer, painted

with polyurethane paint. En
cased inside the steel box, a
plastic "air mattress" holds the
water. FAFCO used its expertise
in plastic pool collectors to de
velop this material and
strengthened it with polymer
films, tedlar and teflon to pro
duce a "selective surface."
Such a surface enables 92 per
cent of the sun's heat to be ab
sorbed during the day and
radiates only about 20 percent of
its heat back at night. This
minimized night-time cooling
and heat loss, which are the
biggest problems with this sys
tem's cost-effectiveness.
"We don't make a claim,"
Maggard said, specifically about
how many BTUs or dollars are
saved per dollar of investment.
"What we do say is that in this
area, a normal family of four can
save over half their natural gas
bill, on the average, over a
year."
Maggard said, however, that
every family is different and their
hot water loads differ. A family
that showers at night after the
water has had a chance to heat
up all day will save more than a

family that showers at six in the
morning when the water has
been cooling off all night.
"If they'll shift their load,
they'll do better," Maggard said,
"but that's up to them."
Maggard emphasized the
point that the 444 will still save
energy: "Even if the collector
isn't at 120 degrees, you will still
save energy if the water is deliv
ered to your gas heater at 80 or
90 degrees and has to boost it to
120 degrees." Without the sys
tem, the water would have to be
heated from 40 or 50 degrees to
120 or 140 degrees by your gas
heater.
There will, of course, be some
seasonal variation, but Maggard
said that on the average, over a
year, a family's hot water heating
bill will be reduced by about
half.
Another potential problem
with the integral system is its
weight on the roof. When filled
with water, the 65 gallon tank
weighs 675 pounds. Maggard
said that by sizing the collector
at four-by-10 feet, the weight is
distributed over the roof and
does not cause problems.
FAFCO had several consul
tants draw up roof construction
details that would accomodate
the weight. In most cases there
is no additional construction re
quired; "sometimes just a bit of
bracing," Maggard said.
The 444 has a full five-year
warranty and a ten-year limited
warranty. Its cost is $3500, com
pared to $5000 for the conven
tional system.
"We'll provide 12.9 percent
financing, which comestoabout
$75.00 a month," Mack said.
"We've already sold fifty. It's
crazy not to buy a solar system
now."
Although state credits were
recently dropped by five per
cent, California still has the na
tion's largest solar incentive
program: a 50 percent com
bined state and federal tax credit
on the cost of buying and install
ing a solar system. With this
plan, the California Energy
Commission projects that 50
percent of California's homes
will have solar systems by 1995.
Pacific Gas and Electric also
provides incentive with its "ZIP"
loans for conservation. Through
the Zero Interest Loan Program,
PC.&E will loan customers the
money to install conservation
materials—a water heater jacket,
weather stripping, and
insulation—interest free with a

pay back period of over 50
months.
"It was 10 years ago that I first
suggested granting tax credits
for energy conservation," state
Senator William Cohen said. "I
was almost laughed off the floor.
We've come a long way. Now we
realize that it is not only people
who are whitewater canoists or
butterfly chasers who are con
cerned about energy, but
people from all parts of the polit
ical spectrum."
"Solar is moving from a parti
san to a bipartisan business,"
Mack said. "When conservative
republicans argue that a 'real'
business shouldn't need tax in
centives to remain viable, I re
mind them of the billions of dol
lars we give each year to petro
leum, gas, coal and nuclear in
dustries."
In fact, FAFCO sells more solar
systems to wealthier, more con
servative buyers than to liberal,
hippie types. This is partly be
cause FAFCOs first product in
1969 was a solar pool heater. A
potential buyer had to first af
ford a swimming pool.

FAFCO made "lots of mis
takes" in its first three years,
Mack said. But they wanted to
establish themselves in the mar
ket. When their plastic pool
heaters sprang leaks, FAFCO
went back and replaced them at
no charge to their customers. In
1973, they had come up with a
better design and guaranteed it
for one year. By 1976, FAFCO
controlled overso percent of the
market, and came out with
another improved model and a
five-year warranty. Each time
they came out with a better
model, FAFCO went back to
their customers and replaced
the old model.

In 1977, the company sold its
distribution (now FAFCO Solar
Energy Sales, a separate com
pany) and bought the raw mate
rials to produce a 10-year war
ranted plastic pool heater with
the "best efficiency rating suited
to a pool environment." FAFCO
returned to their old customers
and installed the final product,
charging only the cost of materi
als.
1979 saw the peak of the solar
pool heating market. Mack cites
the Iranian revolution, the en
ergy crisis, the rising cost of nat
ural gas and the ban on the use
of natural gas to heat pools as
contributing factors to the high
sales rate. As the pool heating
market began to fade, FAFCO
needed to expand its product
line to remain viable.
After going public in late 1980,
FAFCO came out with what
Mack calls their "me too" prod
uct: a conventional, domestic
solar hot water heating system.
Other solar companies already
sold similar systems, but FAFCO
also "made a major commitment
to produce a new heating system
by mid 1983," Mack said.
"We saw a decline in sales in
1980, but broke even. We did
lose money last year, but didn't
go out of business like a lot of
our competitors."
True to its commitment, the
444 solar hot water heater is on
the market.
"We're still playing with it,"
Maggard said, who also denies
allegations that the system will
discredit the solar industry be
cause of its inefficiencies. "It will
definitely save money and en
ergy."
As to the future of solar, Mack
is characteristically optimistic.
"Solar looks good," he said.
"It's a business with an inher
ently political side to it. Solar is
very organized with good grass
roots structure and conservative
backing as well."
While he admits that if thecur
rent federal tax credits (which
expire at the end of 1985) are not
renewed, the solar industry
would be severely affected,
Mack doesn't feel this will hap
pen. FAFCO is involved at both
state and federal levels, lobby
ing for renewal of the credits.
