POET: I know what dreams are . . . But what is
poetry?
DAUGHTER OF INDRA: It is not reality ... It is
more than reality. It is not dreaming — but dreams
come alive, envisioned . . .
— August Strindberg, A Dream Play
To this equation — reality plus dreams equals
poetry — Strindberg added a fourth quantity, the
ater, which encompasses all three of the others.
Ingmar Bergman's rich, engrossing new movie
Fanny and Alexander is unofficially dedicated to
Strindberg: at the end of it two retired actresses,
Helena Ekdahl (Cunn Wallgren) and her
daughter-in-law Emilie (Ewa Frohling), decide to
return to the theater in a production of A Dream
Play, and Helena begins to read the author's pre
face aloud: "On a flimsy foundation of actual hap
penings, imaginations spins and weaves in new
patterns: an intermingling of remembrances, ex
periences, whims, fancies, ideas, fantastic absur
dities and improvisations, and original inventions
of the mind." This "intermingling," of course, re
fers as much to Bergman's own dream play, the
film we have just seen, as it does to Strindberg's.
Bergman's inspiration this time has been
Strindberg the man of the theater, not just
Strindberg the expressionist (as it was in Cries and
Whispers) or Strindberg the chronicler of marital
strife (as in Scenes from a Marriage). Emilie tells
Helena that A Dream Play contains roles for both of
them, and Bergman too has chosen his own role —
the Poet whom the Daughter of Indra salutes be
fore ascending to heaven at the conclusion of the
play: "Farewell, you mortal child, you poet
dreamer, /who — better than the rest — has
learned to live . . It's not a modest choice, but
perhaps we can grant that after three and a half
decades of making movies, many of them as
tonishing, he has earned it.
Fanny and Alexander, set in a Swedish town in
the 1910s, is named for the two youngest members
of a theatrical family. Ten-year-old Alexander (Be
rtil Guve) and his eight-year-old sister (Pernilla
Allwin) are Helena's grandchildren, and their par
ents, Emilie and Oscar (Allan Edwall), who man
ages the theater company begun by his late father,
share Helena's enormous house. Oscar has two
brothers — bumbling, eternally bankrupt Carl
(Borje Ahlstedt), a university professor who bic
kers constantly with his patient German-born wife
Lydia (Christina Schollin), and the regally mous
tachioed philanderer Gustav Aldof (Jarl Kulle),
whose wife Alma (Mona Malm) accepts his sexual
wanderings amiably. (The film omits mention of
Gustav Adolf's occupation, but according to the
prologue to the published screenplay, he is a res
tauranteur.)
In the course of the first half of the picture,
Oscar dies and Emilie remarries — the harsh, un
yielding Bishop Edvard Vergerus ()an Malmsjo), a
widower who has been living alone with his
mother, sister and invalid aunt. In the second half
Emilie, made miserable by the second marriage,
succeeds in extricating first her children and then
herself from Edvard's grasp and in returningto the
warm bosom of the Ekdahl family.
It is impossible to avoid seeing Bergman him
self, who planned Fanny and Alexander as his last
film, both in the figure of the dying Oscar, deliver

ing a final Christmas speech — beautifully read by
Allan Edwall — to his beloved company (the com
pany of Fanny and Alexander includes, in support
ing roles, three performers who together span
almost Bergman's entire career — Harriet An
dersson, Gunnar Bjornstrand and Erland
josephson) and in the perceptive, bright-eyed,
tough-minded Alexander. There's no question
that Bergman wants Alexander to attract our sym
pathies: in the face-off between him and his step
father over an imaginative lie he has told (implicat
ing Edvard in the death by drowning of his wife and
children), the boy's unassailable spirit draws the
focus of the scene.
Bergman sees Alexander's storytelling as a
means of creating theater — a gift he has certainly
come by honestly. The initial image of Fanny and
Alexander shows the boy manipulating an elabo
rate miniature stage for cardboard cut-out pup
pets (it's a classic opening), and later that day he
appears as one of the angels in his father's Nativity
production —which, shot from above, looks like a
puppet play come to life. From that point on virtu
ally everything Alexander does — cursing with un
restrained energy at his father's funeral, throwing
himself on a table in a side room during his
mother's wedding to the bishop — can be viewed
as theater. Extravagant scenes play themselves out
wherever he turns — a statue raises its out
stretched hand to its breast, a giant Oriental
marionette shimmies as he passes, Oscar's ghost
visits him repeatedly. At the end of the movie,
when he thinks he has escaped from his stepfather
at last, Edvard's ghost trips him in the corridor.
Alexander is a poet-dreamer, a theatrical artist in
the making, and such men never break free of
their ghosts.
A number of distinguished ghosts make an ap
pearance in Fanny and Alexander — Strindberg, of
course, but also Shakespeare, Feydeau, Chekhov.
The scenes between Edvard and Emilie remind us
of the husband-and-wife scenes in The Father and
The Dance of Death, and one of them seems di
rectly influenced by the dialogue in A Dream Play
in which the Daughter of Indra and the Attorney
debate the possibilities for happiness in marriage.
(The picture includes many such nods to A Dream
Play : at the end of Part One, Alexander points out
to Fanny the barred, permanently locked windows
in their bedroom — an equivalent to the chilling
episode in Strindberg in which a maid pastes up all
the holes in the Attorney's home, sealing the air
out.) The problem is, ironically, that since
Bergman has evoked Strindberg on marriage in so
many other pictures with contemporary settings,
Emilie's Strindbergian reflections sound anac
hronistic. To exacerbate the problem, once Emilie
begins to suffer, Ewa Frohling's intensity never
seems convincingly early-20th-century.
The names of Shakespeareg and Feydeau pop
up in the day-to-day conversation of the theatrical
Ekdahls — Oscar is rehearsing Hamlet when he is
taken ill (and, significantly, he has cast himself as
the Ghost), Emilie chides Alexander for "playing
Hamlet" when he won't forgive her for wedding
Edvard, and Helena, reminiscing with her old lover
Isak (Erland Josephson, in a marvelous turn), re
calls a time when her husband caught them to
gether as a scene out of a Feydeau farce.
And indeed there are several such scenes in the
film. Almost every time Carl appears, the movie

turns the corner into farce, because Carl's over
stated fretting and bitching and overexuberant
flourishes of gentility in social situations make him
a walking caricature. His one semi-serious scene,
in which he asks his wife, "How is it one becomes
second-rate . . .? How does the dust fall?," is in a
Chekhovian mode — this is the cry of Trigorin, of
Andrei — though it fails to achieve the requisite
balance of the comically and the tragically ludicr
ous; it's a bit heavy-handed. Chekhov emerges
more successfully in Oscar's Christmas speech, in
which he apologizes for behaving in a "comically
solemn" fashion, and in the love scene between
Custav Adolf and the maid, Maj (Pernilla
Wallgren), in which the tone is shifted delicately
from bawdy to rueful.
These imperial dramatic ghosts — so approp
riate to this tale of theater-making — stand beside
those of Hans Christian Andersen and Charles
Dickens, who lend the movie its structure and
mood. Behind the magic and the supernatural
tale-telling (in the second half) — devices out of
Andersen — is a fairy tale about a pair of children
rescued from the clutches of an evil stepfather
through the offices of good angels (Helena and
Isak, whom she sends to kidnap the children in an
antique chest). And the story bears a strong re
semblance to David Copperfield, too, with Alex
ander as David, Edvard and his sister Henrietta as
the Murdstones, and Emilie as a variation on Mrs.
Copperfield. Moreover, the first hour of the film,
detailing a long Yuletide celebration, has a Dic
kensian sensuousness (it's the best part of the
movie) that harkens back to the feeling of
Bergman's adaptation of The Magic Flute eight
years ago.
The pleasure one derives from watching Fanny
and Alexander has a lot to do with its structure —
particularly in the first half, which maintains a de
eply satisfying traditional narrative — and its sen
suousness; even though Bergman miscalculates
occasionally, and his obsessions threaten to take
over in Part Two, the movie is absorbing through
out its considerable length. (It runs three and a
half hours, including intermission.)
I can't think of a film that accomplishes a fuller
or a warmer depiction of childhood spent in a
wealthy, affectionate home in the Europe of the
early part of our century than the first half of Fanny
and Alexander, with its collection of maids and
aunts and Christmas traditions, its free-wheeling
play and its erotic tensions. A pillow fight insti
gated by the cherubic red-headed servant Maj is
out of Jean Vigo's joyous ode to the free spirits of
schoolchildren, Zero de Conduite, and there's a
funny, intimate scene in the nursery when Emilie
and Alma hear the children's prayers — rhymed off
rapidly, without inflection — in which the combi
nation of bedclothes and holidy excitement and
the pink and red glows of the two women produce
a confused, sexually electric tableau that suggests
lames Barrie with the sex left in.
Unfortunately, Bergman doesn't expose the
other side of childhood — the frightening side —
with the same vividness. The scenes in which
Fanny and Alexander are compelled to visit their
father's deathbed and, later that night, awaken to
their mother's mourning wails, seem too meas
ured, too thought-out; they don't summon up the
emotional power Bergman was clearly working

towards. And are the episodes demonstrating Ed
vard's severity in dealing with his stepson perhaps
too Victorian? When his crusty old mother wakes
the boy for his punishment and the thunder rages
outside his permanently locked window, you may
have to suppress a giggle.
The second half is not as firmly controlled as the
first, and as Bergman moves through each of his
celebrated preoccupations — God, death, mar
riage as hell, the doubling and the merging of
personalities — they seem not only terribly famil
iar but terribly perfunctory, and they call up some
of the worst excesses of his lesser pictures. (When
Alexander pumps his spectral father for informa
tion about Cod, one relives the metaphysical
mumbo-jumbo of Through a Class Darkly,
wherein God showed up as a spider, and a close
up of Edvard's slobbering, decaying aunt in the last
stages of her illness is like the ugliest, rubbing
our-face-in-the-dirt moments in Scenes from a
Marriage, Face to Face and Autumn Sonata — far
from my favorite Bergman pictures.)
There's too much of Jan Malmsjo's mannered
performance as Edvard — who could play this role
without mannerisms? — and too little of the won
derful actors who play the Ekdahls — especially
Jarl Kulle and Mona Malm, Borje Ahistedt, radiant
Pernilla Wallgren, and Gunn Wallgren, whose per
formance as Helena holds the movie together. The
roles the two Wallgrens, maid and mistress, prob
ably had their origins in Bergman's most dazzling
comedy, the 1955 Smiles of a Summer Night
(which Jarl Kulle acted in), and their history may
account in part for the solid craftsmanship, the
subtlety and the range in the writing of them. After
that, one must credit the actresses.
Uneven as it is, Fanny and Alexander gives us so
much more than most movies, even for its length,
that one tends to accept even the second half with
gratitude. Few directors can stage a scene as
eloquently as Bergman has staged the aftermath of
Oscar's stroke, when his wife and the other actors
carry him across the snow; few directors can so
effect the transition from a rich, loving home to a
cold, cruel one that we feel the same sensory pri
vation as the children. The film is full of extraordi
nary touches, like Alma's sexual receptiveness
when her husband returns from an assignation
with his mistress, Maj — or the scene in which
Helena discusses Maj's pregnancy with Gustav
Adolf and Alma and it is the two in-laws, rather
than mother and son, who huddle and confer in
perfect comfort with each other. (You get the
sense that these feminine chats about Gustav
Adolf's silliness have been going on for years.)
When Emilie visits Edvard's family for the first
time, her elegant lime-green dress, so tastefully
understated anywhere else, presents such a glar
ing contrast to the enforced simplicity of Edvard's
quarters that it blinds you, and you can predict his
next words to his wife-to-be — that she leave all
the accoutrements of her old life at Helena's
house when she enter his. Later, when Emilie visits
Helena, Bergman and his legendary photo
grapher, Sven Nykvist, give her a moment of
splendor as she mounts her carriage on a magnifi
cent, tree-lined path — only to return to a life
devoid of color. Fanny and Alexander is not a mas
terpiece, but it is certainly the work of master — a
master filmmaker and a master dramatist.
