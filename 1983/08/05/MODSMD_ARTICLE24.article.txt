## Old and young folks at home in Concord 
### BILL AINSWORTH 
Folk music is alive and well in
the Bay Area. The reception ac
corded Pete Seeger and Arlo
Guthrie at their concert in the
Concord Pavillion last Thursday
night proved there is still a large
audience for an American tradi
tion in music that's popularity
has waned in the past 20 years.
The majestic hilltop setting
and comfortable grass at the
Pavillion combined with a warm
summer's evening to provide
the perfect conditions to relax
and enjoy the talents of these
giants of folk music.
Last Thursday's show high
lighted each musician's strong
points in music and showman
ship. Guthrie's long
introductions—given in his
rambling, loose, off-the-wall
style—kept the audience laugh
ing, while Seeger's hearty style
conveyed to the audience the
celebration of life that is the es
sence of his songs.
However, each musician's
upbeat rapport with the audi
ence did not take away from the
social criticisms which pervaded
their songs. These criticisms
were evident in songs ranging
from poignant ballads to light,
humorous tunes.
The social criticisms had many
and varied targets: President
Reagan, the regime of Chilean
dictator Augosto Pinochet, the
government bailout of Chrysler
and a beauty contest in Pacifica.
Guthrie's song about Chrysler
was done in the classic folk tradi
tion. In its humorous way, it ef
fectively portrayed the unem

ployed man's deep sense of frus
tration over a system that pro
vides bailouts for multi-billion
dollar corporations, while re
ducing to the bone the compen
sation given to the millions of
unemployed Americans.
Although the crowd was not
filled with many unemployed
people, the audience neverthe
less empathized with the mes
sage, as Guthrie sang the
chorus:
"I'm changing my name to
Chrysler, and I'm headed for
Washington, D.C. I'll tell some
power broker what they did for
laccoca(r) would be perfectly
acceptable to me."
But social criticism was not the
whole story as both Seeger and
Guthrie played songs, written
about both ordinary and ex
traordinary events, that were
witty and just plain fun.
At folk music concerts, fans
are able to enjoy new songs that
they are hearing for the first time
as much as the traditional favo
rites. This is due to the clear, in
telligible manner in which the
lyrics are sung and to the fre
quent sing-along emphasis
which places the musician in the
role of teacher.
As a result, the audience can
derive more satisfaction from
each song than at most concerts,
where much of the time is spent
surviving the new material so
you can hear the hits that
origianlly attracted you to the
concert.
This was evident as the audi
ence derived as much pleasure
from a new song Guthrie played

about the trauma of children
growing up in the '80s as they did
from his hit "City of New Or
leans."
The same was true for
Seeger's new song about a high
school announcement of a
beauty contest in Pacifica. This
contest drew a challenge from a
young girl who asked the man
making the announcement to be
)udged in the same sexist way in
which beauty contests are
judged.
Seeger's deep, rich voice and
lively manner were evident
throughout the evening. It is
clear that Seeger has not lost any
musical abilities in his long
career.
His rendition of the classic "If I
Had a Hammer" and "Kisses
Sweeter Than Wine" proved that
he can inspire and uplift an au
dience now as well as at any
other time in his career. That is
no small feat, considering that
the 66-year-old Seeger has been
playing concerts for more than
35 years.
The only drawback of the con
cert was that with talented musi
cians on the scale of Seeger and
Guthrie sharing the stage, you
never quite got enough of
either. Even though they did
play three hours, both of them
could easily fill that time alone.
The mastery of the two artists,
the weather and the setting left
me—and many other members
of the audience —with the desire
for this concert to go on all
night.
