Andropov: New Challenge to
the West, is reputed to be the
first complete political biog
raphy of the new Soviet leader. It
attempts to lift the aura of re
spectability conferred upon An
dropov by the Western and
Soviet media. According to an
introduction by Robert Con
quest, Beichman and Bernstam's
book presents Andropov's
background so that Westerners
can understand and predict his
behavior. The body of the book,
however, cannot fulfill this
promise. Instead, much of the
biography reads like the descrip
tion of Kurtz in joseph Conrad's
Heart of Darkness : the reader is
invited to draw conclusions
about the brutal nature of the
character, while provided only
brief and incomplete glimpses
of the actual person.

After a review of Andropov's
early environment, the biog
raphy proper gets underway
with the year 1930, when 16-
year-old Andropov joined the
Soviet Communist Youth or
ganization, the Komsomol. This
connection with the Komsomol
provided the main focus of An
dropov's political activity from
the 1930s through World War 11.
Beichman and Bernstam deduce
a low moral character in An
dropov from the nature of the
Komsomol activities.
Andropov's official biography
reports that his first important
political appointment came in
1938, but Beichman and
Bernstam reveal that he first
gained such status in 1937. Sta
lin's purge was at its height that
year. From these two bits of in
formation, the authors infer that
Andropov must have led an un
savory political life in order to
survive within Stalin's brutal
political framework.
The authors describe various
forced-work projects which
were undertaken in Andropov's

province during the 1930s and
'40s, under Komsomol supervi
sion. These projects imposed
horrifying living conditions on
thousands of women and chil
dren laborers. The authors con
clude that Andropov must have
been one of the major labor or
ganizers for these projects,
since he was a Komsomol leader
at the time.
The authors believe a political
and ideological closeness grew
between Andropov and Stalin
from 1951 to 1953, when An
dropov was appointed to head a
sub-department in the National
Communist Party. Although An
dropov's activities during this
period are undocumented, the
authors are of the opinion that
he was destined to become the
leader of a political purge even
more devastating than that of
1937.
Beichman and Bernstam
suggest that Andropov's Stalinist
tendencies continued after Sta
lin's death. Andropov was am
bassador to Hungary during the
uprising there in 1956, which

Soviet troops violently suppres
sed. The harshness of the Soviet
intervention prompts the au
thors to attribute its organiza
tion to Andropov.
After the Hungarian crisis,
Andropov returned to Moscow.
At this point, he began to rise
slowly towards the head of the
Soviet political system.
Beichman and Bernstam's
analysis begins to fail here, as
the quality and quantity of doc
umentation decrease signifi
cantly. For the authors, An
dropov becomes a token parti
cipant in struggles involving
much more powerful figures like
Kruschev and Brezhnev. They
speculate that Andropov's ap
pointment to head the KGB in
1967 was arranged by one of his
patrons, and did not result from
his own efforts.
The final step in Andropov's
career appears to have followed
the previously established pat
tern of political circumstances
favoring his characteristic
ruthlessness. Despite the death
of his patron Suslov in 1982, An

dropov was able to seize power
after Brezhnev's death because
other Soviet leaders feared what
he might do with the dossiers of
information he had collected
during his tenure in the KGB.
Beichman and Bernstam tell
an interesting story of An
dropov's activities from 1930
through the mid-19505, but their
analysis becomes much more
tenuous after this period. Even
though they had access to the
Hoover Archives, which contain
probably the most complete ma
terial on the Soviet Union out
side that country, there are in
evitable gaps in their knowledge
of Andropov's career. The au
thors have done their best to re
construct his political life, but
their conclusions are question
able, even on the basis of the
evidence they had. Ultimately,
this biography must be viewed
as a plausible story rather than a
historical piece, because even in
the better-documented areas
much of the evidence and
analysis is speculative.
