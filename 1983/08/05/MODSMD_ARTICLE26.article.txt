## Where else can you get a Shirley Temple in California? Delmonico's 
### KAREN SPRINGEN 
DELMONICO'S
1906 El Camino Real
Menlo Park
324-4701
We enjoyed our meal at Del
monico's. The Italian continen
tal restaurant in Menlo Park
brought back memories of the

type of restaurant we ate at with
our grandparents on special oc
casions. The waiter even served
us a Shirley Temple (made with
Seven-up and grenadine)!
The restaurant management
and employees obviously take
pride in their food and service.
Our waiter, wearing a black suit,
was gracious and formal. He

served us attentively throughout
the meal.
Defying the conventions of
restaurant reviews, we both or
dered pasta. If we had had big
ger appetities—or if we were no'i
such devoted Italian food
fans—we would have chosen
one of the many veal, seafood,

or filets on the menu. Del
monico's is particularly proud
of its filet of petrale Florentine
($11.95), veal parmigiana
($14.25) and brochette of beef
with wild rice ($12.75).
We opened our meal with the
soup of the day—split pea
(minestrone is always
available) — which was thick, hot

and tasty. We also tried the
mixed green dinner salad which
was free of any garnish save two
tomato wedges. Those who like
to hold the croutons, and the
bacon bits, will be happy with the
salad. Those who are accus
tomed to lavish salad bar salads
will be devastated.

Our pastas were just what we
wanted. The restaurant owner is
Greek, not Italian, but we never
would have guessed had he not
told us. Good sourdough bread,
complete with butter on a chil
led silver plate, accompanied
the meal.
The fettuccini alfredo ($6.25)
was a more than ample portion

of noodles (not home-made, in
cidentally) in a creamy sauce
doused with fresh parmesan
cheese. It was served on a large
oval plate without vegetables or
other garnishes alongside it.
Of course we couldn't resist
dessert, although we virtuously

decided to split the chocolate
mousse torte ($2.00) between
us. The torte, which Del
monico's purchased from an
Italian bakery in San Francisco,
was excellent. (The blueberry
cheesecake is the only dessert
which is baked in-house.)
Considering the elegant at

mosphere and the excellent ser
vice the food is reasonably
priced at Delmonico's. Our bill
came to a total of $20.
The restaurant has been open
for 13 months.
Although reservations are
recommended, it seems un
likely that the large, 125-seat res
taurant will be filled on many
nights. It was half-way full at 7:00
p.m. Wednesday.
Delmonico's is truly ideal for
wedding receptions or other oc
casions requiring a private room
for about 40 guests.
Lunch is served Monday
through Friday from 11:30 a.m.
to 2:30 p.m. Delmonico's is not
open for lunch on Saturday and
Sunday. After all, owner Steve
Dimi explained, he and the
other restaurant workers need
to rest occasionally! The restau
rant is open for dinner Monday
through Saturday from 5:30 p.m.
to 10:30 p.m.
One final note: Delmonico's
has a $6 minimum charge.
