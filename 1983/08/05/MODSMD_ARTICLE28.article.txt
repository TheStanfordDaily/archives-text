## Dine in another era at The Antique

The inevitable problem with a
restaurant critique is that a fa
vorable review is also usually
boring: no one wants to read
about the scrumptious shrimp
when they could chuckle about
the petrified meat loaf.
But one of the "hazards" of
living in the Bay Area is that
readers have to endure a
number of boring restaurant re
views because they enjoy the
choice of a number of very good
restaurants. The Antique, just
off campus on El Camino, is one
such eatery.
The Antique's decor lives up
to its name: dimly lit antique
shaded lamps decorate a room
filled with wood-lacquered ta

bles and baroque metal finish
ings. The atmosphere is struc
tured to remind the customer of
another, more gracious era.
The menu offers a wide variety
of choices: from pizza ($7.45) to
New York steak ($11.45); from
shrimp scampi ($11.95) to club
sandwiches ($4.95). The prices
are relatively moderate: the
most expensive dinners are onlv
$11.95.
We chose the clams fettucini
($8.45) and one of the house
specialities, barbecued chicken
and ribs ($10.95). The former
consists of fettucini noodles
covered with a light sauce with
clams and vegetables in it. The
dish is a little offbeat for most
tastes, perhaps, but it is defi
nitely worth trying.
The barbecued chicken and
ribs is a large meal that includes

a full serving of ribs and the
equivalent of a quarter of
chicken. Although the dual en
trees were both good, this meal
should be attempted only if one
is very hungry.
The dinners come with sour
dough bread, steak fries, baked
potato or rice pilaf, and salad
bar. The sourdough bread was
delicious, but the slightly un
dercooked and sticky rice pilaf
was disappointing.
The salad bar (at $5.95) was a
bit overpriced for a la carte con
sumption. Nevertheless, it was
quite well-stocked with standard
salad bar items: cucumbers, car
rots, alfalfa sprouts, bacon bits,
croutons, bell peppers, etc.
Service throughout the entire
evening was outstanding. Our
waitress was very attentive and
solicitous.
The house vin rose is also very
good and moderately priced
($4.95 for a carafe). The absolute
topper of the meal, though, was
an incredible heaping portion of
unspeakably delicious mud pie
($2.50). Devotees of chocolate
desserts should not miss it.
Despite a few minor prob
lems, our long and leisurely
meal was generally enjoyable
and reasonably priced. Students
looking for a nice restaurant

with a varied menu near campus
would do well to try The Anti
que.
