Jiertftarv'Auditorium ★
• Bunuel was a surrealist
by temperament, so the startl
clear images in this movie
fc seem surrealistic even though
they are'brutally realistic. This is
a documentary about a village
in Bunuel's native Spain — a vil
lage eternally on the brink of
starvation and so isolated and
backward it seems medieval —
but it is such a catalogue of hor
rors that we can scarcely be
lieve it. Bunuel's relentless
presentation of the plight of the
villagers, unfiltered by sen
timentality or false hope, trans
ports the picture so far beyond
its limited didactic purposes
that it remains one of the few
odcumentaries that is also a
work of art: an expression of
unendurable, hopeless agony
suspended outside time.
Plays tonight with Un Chien
Andalou and Entr'acte.
Un Chien Andalou (1928)
Terman Auditorium ★
Luis Bunuel made his debut
in collaboration with Salvador
Dali. (They teamed again two
years later on L'Age d'Or.) In it,
he managed not only to find a
unique style, but also to achieve
one of the key succes scandales
of our century, and moreover
to align himself with one of its
most important movements,
surrealism. The use of the medi
um to effect the odd, jarring
juxtapositions Dali was already

creating on canvas disturbed
and disoriented audiences as
much as the violence and hor
ror of the two most celebrated
images (the slashing of the eye
ball, the maggots eating away at
a living man's hand). But the
greatest shock in the film was
how funny it was — filmgoers
didn't know how to respond to
the kind of renegade wit that
could first conceive of an image
of almost primal horror and dis
gust and then laugh at it. With
Pierre Batcheff, Simone
Mareuil, Jaime Miravilles,
Bunuel as the man wielding the
razor, and Dali as the priest.
Plays tonight with Land
Without Bread and Entr'acte.
Star Trek II: The Wrath of
Khan ★
Fox, Redwood City
Nicholas Meyer directed this
witty, spirited adventure film, a
sequel to an episode of the Star
Trek TV show. It features
Ricardo Montalban as Khan, a
criminal exiled by Captain Kirk
(William Shatner) to a planet
that has since deteriorated; the
script by Harve Bennett and
Jack Sowards chronicles his at-,,

The Man with the Golden
Gun (1974)
Memorial Auditorium
Despite Britt Ekland's
gorgeous smile (she plays a
character called Goodnight)
and Christopher Lee's urbanely
evil charm, this is one of the
dreariest entries in the James
Bond series. Roger Moore dis
plays about as much personality
as a goldfish, and nothing in the
script (by Richard Maibaum
and Tom MJnkiewicz), the
direction (by Guy Hamilton), or
even the production design
rouses you from the lethargy
you've sunk into after you've
watched yet another car chase.
Clifton James does a reprise of
the redneck sheriff character
he played in Live and Let Die —
it's one of the least appealing
creations in any of the Bonds.
With Maud Adams and Herve

Villechaize
Plays
Sunday
evening.

Play It Again, Sam (1972)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Herbert Ross directed this
adaptation of Woody Allen's
stage play about a klutz who
dreams of being Bogart. It's fair
ly enjoyable, but a bit too civ
ilized for Allen: confined to the
Broadway comedy structure, he
doesn't have much room to be
inventive. Still, there are a few
inspired bits, like a sequence in
which Allen imagines how his
best friend (Tony Roberts) will
react to the news that he, Alien,
has had an affair with Roberts'
wife (Diane Keaton).
Plays Sunday and Monday
with Casablanca.
The Night of the Hunter
(1955) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Charles Laughton stepped
behind the camera for the first
time to make this adaptation of
~

Craves appears (briefly) as her
first husband, a robber. Shot by
the prodigious cinemato
grapher, Stanley Cortez, who
gives it the rich black and white
contrasts of the best German
Expressionist films. No one who
has seen this marvel is likely to
have forgotten the journey the
children take across the water,
which may have inspired the
opening of De Palma's Blow
Out.
Plays Thursday with To Kill a
Mockingbird
5.0.8. (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In Blake Edwards' un
believably vitriolic portrait of a
crass, cynical Hollywood, a pro
ducer (Richard Muliigan)
whose big-budgeted musica',
Night Wind, starring his whole
some wife (Julie Andrews), is an
unqualified disaster, tries to re
coup his losses by having her
bare her breasts on camera.
Julie Andrews, whose role is
obviously a self-parody (and
one she has no skill at playing),
happens to be Blake Edwards'
wife in real life, so when she rips
off her blouse Edwards seems
guilty of exactly the same kind
of exploitation as the Mulligan
character in the movie. Edwards
spends an hour and a half vent
ing his spleen on everyone in
Hollywood and the las? half
hour in a sanctimonious tribute
to his producer hero (who dies
in the course of the picture).
The entire enterprise may make
you feel unclean. Among the
cast, only Robert Preston, as
a quack doctor, really dist
inguishes himself, though
Loretta Swit has a few funny
moments (and the best lines)
and Mulligan manages the
physical gags that are Edwards'
specialty with particular elan.
Plays today and tomorrow
with footsie.
