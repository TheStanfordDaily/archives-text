# SLAC confirms fifth quark

Physicists at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) have announced the measurement of the
decay lifetime of the "B-Meson" particle in two
separate experiments conducted at the Positron-
Electron Project storage ring facility.
The measurement, which is the first of its kind,
was announced July 28 at the 11th annual confer
ence of the SLAC Summer Institute.
By measuring the length of time the B-Meson
took to decay, scientists were able to confirm the
existence of the fifth quark. Quarks — basic con
stituents of matter — combine to form neutrons
and protons.
Physicists at SLAC were able to detect B-Meson
particles by colliding bunches of electrons and
positrons through the storage rings at the
Positron-Electron Project storage ring.
The measurement of the B-Meson decay was
confirmed by two experiments.
The first experiment was a collaboration be
tween physicists at SLAC and several universities.

These physicists — represented at the conference
by Marcello Piccolo, a visiting physicist from Italy
— were able to obtain a measurement of 1.8
picoseconds (one thousandth of a billionth of a
second) by reconstructing the trajectory of the
B-Meson.
The second measurement was done in conjunc
tion with UC-Berkeley. The prime investigators,
Nigel Lockyer and John Jarols (both of Stanford)
were able to record a lifetime of about 1.03
picoseconds.
The lifetime measurements are important be
cause they provide information about the "weak"
interactions that cause radioactive decay.
Jarols and Lockyer used a revolutionary device
that can measure such small distances. According
to Stanford physicist Marty Perl, this new device
will introduce "a new era" into the world of parti
cle physics.
Physicists at SLAC agree that the most difficult
task in obtaining the decay life of the B-Meson was
its relatively short lifespan.
