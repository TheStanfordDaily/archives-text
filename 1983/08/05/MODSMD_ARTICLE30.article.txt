Libya bombs Chad
N'Djamena, Chad — President Hissene
Habre's government charged yesterday that Li
byan planes extended their bombing raids 220
miles deeper into Chad, and U.S. advisers
began teaching Habre's troops how to fire
American Redeye missiles at the aerial raiders.
Information Minister Mahamat Soumaila said
I ibvan planes bombed Kalait and Oum
Chalouba, in eastern Chad, Wednesday and
again yesterday, causing "some damage The
two oases control the north-south route in
eastern Chad.
It was the first time, in a week of alleged
bombing bv Col. Moammar Khadafy's air force,
that attacks had been reported south of the
battlefront at Faya-Largeau, the chief oasis in
north central Chad, which Habre's fo r ces re
captured last Saturday from ex-President
Goukoni Oueddei's Libyan-backed armv.
Libya has repeatedly denied its planes have
hombed Chad, its southern neighbor. But
Habre's government claimed Libyan planes in
raids earlier this week destroyed much of
Faya-Largeau, a town of 10,000, and caused
heavy casualties
General assaulted in Germany
Wiesbaden, West Germany — A storm of pro
test has erupted in West Germanv over Wed
nesday's assault on a U.S. general by a member
of the ecological and pacifist Green Party in the
Hesse state Parliament.
The Green, Frank Schwalba-Hoth, had
lunged a: general Paul Williams, commander of
the U.S. V Corps, shouting "bloody Ami be
tore smearing him with red fluid
A' the beginning of yesterday's Hesse state
Parliament session, Parliamentary State Presi
dent lochen Lengemann refused Schwalbe-
Hoth permission to enter the building and de
scribed his action as "violating in the worst
possible way the rules of this house."
Lengemann was giving a reception for U.S.
commanders in thp state Parliament when the
incident occurred

Italy gets Socialist leader
Rome — Bettino Craxi, a pragmatic 49-year
old who rose from relative obscurity in less than
a decade, yesterday became the first Socialist
prime minister of Italy by pulling together a
coalition of the same five political parties that
have run the government since 1980.
But the installation of the sometimes-brash
Socialist leader did not signify a swerve to the
left in Italy, where coalition-building depends
upon the consent and cooperation of the dom
inant Christian Democrats, who have provided
all but two of Italy's post-World War II prime
ministers.
To gain the top job, Craxi's minority Socialists
had to agree to accept only six seats in the
TO-member Cabinet, including his own. The
Christian Democrats got 16 seats and, of the
three smaller coalition partners, the Republi
cans received three seats, the Social Democrats
three and the Liberals two.
Thus, despite a humiliating setback in gen
e-al elections june 26-27, the centrist Christian
Democrats comfortably maintained their lead
ing role in government, including the key posts
of deputy premier and foreign minister.
Yankee caged for fowl play
Toronto — Dave Winfield, the hitting star in
the New York Yankees' 3-1 victory over the To
ronto Blue lays Thursday night, was taken to a
police station shortly after the game and
charged with cruelty to animals after a warmup
throw in theoutfield struck and killed a seagull.
The bizarre incident occurred as the Blue lays
were coming to bat in the bottom of the fifth
inning. The game was delayed momentarily
while one of the ballboys removed the dead
gull from the outfield.
The maximum penalty for cruelty' to animals
is a $500 fine and/or six months in prison.
Today's weather
Mostly fair today. Highs in the 80s, lows in the
