### TIM GRIEVE 
After a two-week deiay in fi
nancial aid offer mailings, the
University has decided to in
clude information in future mail
ings on its policy of offering pri
vate aid to non-registrants who
do not qualify for federal loans.
"We were going to inform
students one way or the other"
about the University's policy,
Associate Director of Financial
Aids Vincent DeAnda explained.
"The question was whether
we'd do that in a separate mail
ing. We've decided to send the
information with the financial
aid offers."
The financial aids office stop
ped mailing out 1983-84 financial
aid offers last month when
members of Stanford Against
Conscription asked the Univer

sitv to consider including the in
formation.
DeAnda said that about 900 of
fers had already been mailed
when the office stopped the
mailings, an i that the recipients
of those offers will also receive
the new information in a sepa
rate mailing.
DeAnda said that there is still
no wav to predict how much
money Stanford will have to
provide for non-registrants who
are now ineligible for federal fi
nancial aid because of the re
cently enacted Solomon
amendment.
"We just don't know how
many students are going to be in
this category. We couldn't even
predict," DeAnda said.
