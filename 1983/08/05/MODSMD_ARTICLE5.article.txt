# Panel to discuss Reagan library
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
The University may have
moved one step closer to be
coming home for President
Reagan's presidential library this
week.
University President Donald
Kennedy has appointed a faculty
committee to consult with him
on the academic value of having
Reagan's presidential library on
campus, but the chairman of
that committee anticipates some
opposition to the library from
faculty members who do not
agree with Reagan s political
policies.
The Hoover Institution al
ready holds Reagan's papers
from his pre-gubernatorial,
gubernatorial and campaign
periods, and the White House
has expressed an interest in plac
ing Reagan's presidential papers
here as well.

Economics Prof. James Rosse,
who will head the new faculty
committee, said that Kennedy's
announcement of the commit
tee can be seen as a further step
in acquiring the library.
"Kennedy has made state
ments in the past that Stanford
would be interested in the li
brary," he said, "and this is
another step."
But Rosse also anticipates that
some faculty members will be
less than enthusiastic about the
project.
"I suspect that there will be a
fair number of people who dis
approve of Reagan's policies and
will use this as an opportunity to
express their displeasure," he
said.
He said he hopes that faculty
members will he able to separate
their political views from their
