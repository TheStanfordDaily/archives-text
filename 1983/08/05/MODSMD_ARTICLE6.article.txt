### BRYCE LEE 
The ASSU Senate voted Tues-
Hay to create a committoo to r*Â»
spond to the Political Science
Department's report on the sen
ate's handling of former con
gressman Pete McCloskey's
spring quarter political science
class.
The senate also charged two
standing committees to investi
gate two separate questions: the
entire issue of academic free
dom and the bylaws of the Guest
Professorship Board (CPB).
A Political Science Depart
ment committee announced last
week that the ASSU and the CPB
had gone beyond "the tradi
tional limits of student participa
tion in instructional matters and
in the process abridged
academic freedom" when deal
ing with McCloskey's spring
quarter class.
Following the departmental
review, Provost Albert Hastorf
formally apologized to McClos
key and warned the senate that
academic credit will not be
granted for future guest profes

sor courses unless the CPB's
bylaws are changed.
? "na*nrii had aruued that
McCloskey migtii userns as
a vehicle to promote his al
ledgedly "anti-Semitic" views.
CPB chairman Seth Linfield also
attempted to control portions of
McCloskey's reading list and the
choice of guest lecturers for the
three-unit course.
In essence, the senate de
cided Tuesday to create a com
mittee to "report" on the de
partment's report.
"What we are doing is looking
at the report issued by the Politi
cal Science Department and
pointing out where things are
incorrect," said ASSU Senate
Chairman and member of new
committee, Jug Jagadish. "Ba
sically the committee is issuing a
'report' on the report."
Jagadish went on to point out
several "factual" ertors in the
University's review.
"Contrary to what the report
said, the senate never approved
a salary more than $2000 for
McCloskey. What we approved
was $2000 and that was never re
duced; however, the Universi
ty's report says that a higher sal
ary was promised."
Graduate Senator Roland Van
Gaalen has said that he feels the
entire purpose of the committee
was to form a "smokescreen" so
that the ASSU could "save face
in the entire controversy.
"It is clear that McCloskey
should have had academic free
dom. He was appointed by the
University as a temporary faculty
member, and as such cannot be

restricted by the ASSU and the
GPB."
However, according to
Jagadish, the entire question of
academic freedom is still very
unclear. In order to clarify the
dilemma, the senate voted to
havethegraduate education and
research committee (a standing
committee within the ASSU sen
ate) begin investigating the en
tire question of academic free
dom.
Another standing committee,
the administration and rules
committee, was instructed by
the senate to begin working on a
new set of laws concerning the
Guest Professorship program
that would be acceptable to both
the ASSU and the University.
