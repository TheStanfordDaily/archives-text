## Official defends administration's response to AIDS 
### 
Washington — A top Health and Human
Services Department official Tuesdav de
fended the Reagan administration's re
sponse to the outbreak o* acquired im
mune deficiency syndrome, denying
charges that the government has dis
criminated against homosexuals and cit
ing large amounts of money devoted to
combating the disease.
"As long as these human beings are
suffering from this illness, we are going to
solve this problem — and solve it as soon
as we can," Dr. Edward Brandt, assistant
secretary for health, told the House Gov
ernment Operations subcommittee on
intergovernmental relations human
resources.
Besides $166 million that has been allo
cated for studies related to AIDS at the
National Institutes of Health, Brandt said,
the Public Health Service funding for
AIDS in the current fiscal year will be
$14.5 million, an increase of $9 million
over last year.

But three public health professionals at
the hearing called for increased federal
funding for research on the disease —
which strikes mainly homosexual men —
and for aid to communities with large gay
populations, such as San Francisco and
New York.
Dr Mervyn Silverman, San Francis
co's municipal health director, said that
local funding has paid for more than 98
percent of the costs needed to deal with
AIDS in his city, which has the second
highest number of cases in the country.
' Obviously, San Francisco and other
impacted communities cannot continue
to meet these needs without federal sup
port," he said.
Stan Matek, former president of the
American Public Health Association,
called increased involvement at the fed
eral level "the priority now" and urged
the administration to provide more
money for AIDS research.
AIDS, first identified in ]une 1981,

wipes out the body's immune system,
leaving the victim susceptible to some
types of cancers, such as Kaposi's sar
coma, and several other life-threatening
infections, the most common of which is
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
More than 75 percent of the 1922 cases
reported in the United States and Puerto
Rico have occurred in sexually active
homosexual and bisexual men. Most of
the others have been identified as in
travenous drug users or Haitian immi
grants.
Several witnesses, including three
AIDS victims, who appeared before the
subcommittee Monday speculated that
the government might have given more
attention to the disease if persons other
than homosexuals were considered at
high risk.
"After listening to the witnesses who
testified before the subcommittee yes
terday, I have grave concerns about the

federal government's response to the
AIDS emergency," said Rep. Ted Weiss
(D-N.Y.), the subcommittee chairman, in
opening the hearing Tuesday.
But Brandt said, "We have approached
this disease in the same way we have ap
proached all others." He called charges
of discrimination "insulting" and said
that "at no time have biases, prejudices
influenced our decision-making."
Under questioning by subcommittee
members, Brandt rejected suggestions
that the Department of Health and
Human Services has acted too slowly and
unevenly in the face of the AIDS crisis.
"The response was as rapid as one can
hope for," he said. But, he added, "We
are clearly way behind in our ability to
help" AIDS victims, because of slower
than expected advances in scientific re
search.
