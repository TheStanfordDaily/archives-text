# Soviet study calls for decentralization
## 
### 
Moscow — A confidential
study prepared for the Kremlin
leadership has called for a fun
damental reform of the Soviet
economy and asserted that its
centralized management system
can no longer ensure the "full
and effective use of the society's
intellectual and labor re
sources."
The document, printed in 70
numbered copies and made
available here, provides an un
usual insight into internal Krem
lin debates over how to rescue
the economy from the stagna
tion that has afflicted it during
the past few years.
In contrast to published ac
counts that focus on various im
pediments to economic growth
— ranging from a lack of incen
tives to shortages of skilled per
sonnel — the 30-page study's
main argument is that the exist
ing system itself is now acting as
a "brake" to further develop
ment.
The study was presented in
April at one of a series of
closed-door seminars organized
by the Soviet Academy of Sci
ences, economic sections of the
Communist Party Central Com
mittee and the Gosplan, or the
state planning commission.
These seminars involved the
country's top economic offi
cials, managers and economists.
It is not known what other
points of view were articulated
at these conferences. The fact
that the system itself was being
questioned, however, suggests
the scope of the discussions and
the concern over the economy.
Yuri Andropov, the new
Soviet leader, subsequently en
dorsed reformist tendencies in a
June speech in which he as
serted that changes in the eco
nomy are "inevitable" and that
the economy was so far man
aged on an "irrational trial-and
error" basis.
While Andropov appears to
have embraced the assessments
of reformist elements as to the
weaknesses of the country's

economy, he has not necessarily
endorsed their prescription for a
broad decentralization. There
are indications, however, that
he is gingerly moving in that
direction.
The dearest such indication
came last month when the gov
ernment inaugurated partial re
forms to free industry from rigid
central control and boost pro
duction. These reforms, known
here as "economic experi
ments," involve the country's
heavy and transport machinery
industries as well as electro
technical industries. Also in
volved are the food industries of
the Ukraine, Byelorussia's light
industry and local industry of
Lithuania.
The "experiments" provide
for a freer rein for the enter
prises ! n deciding how to reward
workers, introduce labor-saving
technology and plow profits
back into production. The en
terprises will be involved in "all
stages of planning," be allowed
to change their systems of finan
cial incentives and generally be
given more independence from
the central authorities.
All this suggests that the
Soviet leader is determined to
modernize the country's eco
nomic structure. It is by no
means clear whether he is pre
pared to go as far and quickly in
the direction suggested by the
study.
The Soviet economy, the
study asserted, "has long passed
the point where it was possible
to regulate it effectively from a
single center."
It said that some of the basic
ideological assumptions have
become dated or irrelevant. In
particular, it challenged the no
tion that economic changes can
be carried out "without social
conflicts" because "under
socialism there are no groups"
without vested economic inter
ests.
"An analysis of the past dec
ades of the development of our
economy," it said, "forces us to

cast doubts on this point of view.
A fundamental restructuring of
the system of economic man
agement touches significantly
on the interests of many social
groups, some of which see in it
hopes for an improvement in
their positions while others see a
worsening" of their status.
Earlier attempts to reform the
economy — made by Nikita
Khrushchev and later by Alexei
Kosygin in the '60s — "did not
take into account" changes that
had taken place in the country.
"This was, we believe, oneofthe
reasons that they ended up in
failure," the report states.
The study identified the huge
state bureaucracy as the main
opponent of any reforms. There
are an estimated 5 million Com
munist Party members em
ployed at various levels in the
bureaucracy.
The main source of current
economic problems here, ac
cording to the study, is a wide
gulf between the state planning

commission in Moscow and in
dividual economic units such as
private enterprises and collec
tive farms.
An array of institutions, minis
tries, commissions and inspec
tion teams occupy intermediate
positions between the Gosplan,
and the individual economic un
its. It is these intermediate bu
reaucratic units that have
"mushroomed" over the past
decades without any productive
service to the society, the study
reported.
In making an argument for
economic decentralization, the
document asserted that the vast
bureaucratic structure is largely
responsible for the steady de
cline in labor productivity and
growth.
Analyzing the relations be
tween "the strictness of ad
ministrative methods and an ef
fective economic develop
ment," the study asserted that
"stricter control over all aspects
of worker activities" has a nega

tive impact on productivity.
To switch the economy to an
intensive" state "is possible
only if one permits the realiza
tion of all existing social reserves
and creative potential of work
ers," the report states.
The current system was
created by )osef Stalin in the
19305, the study said. "That was a
social system in which the
people were consistently re
garded as 'screws' in the eco
nomic mechanism and they be
haved almost as obediently (and
passively) as machines and re
sfnce that period, however,
the political and economic situa
tion in the Soviet Union has
changed, the report states. "This
system was corrected, renewed
and improved but it was not
once subjected to a qualitative
restructuring to reflect funda
mental changes in the condition
of productive forces."

cials, managers and economists.
It is not known what other
points of view were articulated
at these conferences. The fact
that the system itself was being
questioned, however, suggests
the scope of the discussions and
the concern over the economy.
Yuri Andropov, the new
Soviet leader, subsequently en
dorsed reformist tendencies in a
June speech in which he as
serted that changes in the eco
nomy are "inevitable" and that
the economy was so far man
aged on an "irrational trial-and
error" basis.
While Andropov appears to
have embraced the assessments
of reformist elements as to the
weaknesses of the country's

economy, he has not necessarily
endorsed their prescription for a
broad decentralization. There
are indications, however, that
he is gingerly moving in that
direction.
The dearest such indication
came last month when the gov
ernment inaugurated partial re
forms to free industry from rigid
central control and boost pro
duction. These reforms, known
here as "economic experi
ments," involve the country's
heavy and transport machinery
industries as well as electro
technical industries. Also in
volved are the food industries of
the Ukraine, Byelorussia's light
industry and local industry of
Lithuania.
The "experiments" provide
for a freer rein for the enter
prises ! n deciding how to reward
workers, introduce labor-saving
technology and plow profits
back into production. The en
terprises will be involved in "all
stages of planning," be allowed
to change their systems of finan
cial incentives and generally be
given more independence from
the central authorities.
All this suggests that the
Soviet leader is determined to
modernize the country's eco
nomic structure. It is by no
means clear whether he is pre
pared to go as far and quickly in
the direction suggested by the
study.
The Soviet economy, the
study asserted, "has long passed
the point where it was possible
to regulate it effectively from a
single center."
It said that some of the basic
ideological assumptions have
become dated or irrelevant. In
particular, it challenged the no
tion that economic changes can
be carried out "without social
conflicts" because "under
socialism there are no groups"
without vested economic inter
ests.
"An analysis of the past dec
ades of the development of our
economy," it said, "forces us to

cast doubts on this point of view.
A fundamental restructuring of
the system of economic man
agement touches significantly
on the interests of many social
groups, some of which see in it
hopes for an improvement in
their positions while others see a
worsening" of their status.
Earlier attempts to reform the
economy — made by Nikita
Khrushchev and later by Alexei
Kosygin in the '60s — "did not
take into account" changes that
had taken place in the country.
"This was, we believe, oneofthe
reasons that they ended up in
failure," the report states.
The study identified the huge
state bureaucracy as the main
opponent of any reforms. There
are an estimated 5 million Com
munist Party members em
ployed at various levels in the
bureaucracy.
The main source of current
economic problems here, ac
cording to the study, is a wide
gulf between the state planning

commission in Moscow and in
dividual economic units such as
private enterprises and collec
tive farms.
An array of institutions, minis
tries, commissions and inspec
tion teams occupy intermediate
positions between the Gosplan,
and the individual economic un
its. It is these intermediate bu
reaucratic units that have
"mushroomed" over the past
decades without any productive
service to the society, the study
reported.
In making an argument for
economic decentralization, the
document asserted that the vast
bureaucratic structure is largely
responsible for the steady de
cline in labor productivity and
growth.
Analyzing the relations be
tween "the strictness of ad
ministrative methods and an ef
fective economic develop
ment," the study asserted that
"stricter control over all aspects
of worker activities" has a nega

tive impact on productivity.
To switch the economy to an
intensive" state "is possible
only if one permits the realiza
tion of all existing social reserves
and creative potential of work
ers," the report states.
The current system was
created by )osef Stalin in the
19305, the study said. "That was a
social system in which the
people were consistently re
garded as 'screws' in the eco
nomic mechanism and they be
haved almost as obediently (and
passively) as machines and re
sfnce that period, however,
the political and economic situa
tion in the Soviet Union has
changed, the report states. "This
system was corrected, renewed
and improved but it was not
once subjected to a qualitative
restructuring to reflect funda
mental changes in the condition
of productive forces."

Moscow — A confidential
study prepared for the Kremlin
leadership has called for a fun
damental reform of the Soviet
economy and asserted that its
centralized management system
can no longer ensure the "full
and effective use of the society's
intellectual and labor re
sources."
The document, printed in 70
numbered copies and made
available here, provides an un
usual insight into internal Krem
lin debates over how to rescue
the economy from the stagna
tion that has afflicted it during
the past few years.
In contrast to published ac
counts that focus on various im
pediments to economic growth
— ranging from a lack of incen
tives to shortages of skilled per
sonnel — the 30-page study's
main argument is that the exist
ing system itself is now acting as
a "brake" to further develop
ment.
The study was presented in
April at one of a series of
closed-door seminars organized
by the Soviet Academy of Sci
ences, economic sections of the
Communist Party Central Com
mittee and the Gosplan, or the
state planning commission.
These seminars involved the
country's top economic offi
cials, managers and economists.

points of view were articulated

that the system itself was being
