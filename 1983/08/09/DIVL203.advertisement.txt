A NEW TOOL FOR YOUR FLOSSTRATIONS WITH A BRUSHOFF!'
Like the sign says in some dental offices, "You don't have to (brush
and) floss all of your teeth, just the ones you want to keep."
For example, consider the Floss'N Gloss™ tool and brushing with aim.
Aim like this is significantly better than Crest, Colgate, and
Aquafresh toothpastes and gels combined!
Yes! It's a loss not to floss, gloss and toss with the
Floss'N Gloss tool and aim.
This tool has a one-inch-long floss loop which has something extra:
It's an extra thick, Flossgarded™ second strand which is almost
like a "rubber baby bumper" or safety in a safety razor.
With one hand, the Floss'N Gloss tool works easily, and without
the two-handed hassle of flossing freehand which can be a pain to
■ leam. Many people have tried, or have been told, and have given up
on regular flossing to remove particles of food "etc."
Overcome your fiosstrations with Floss'N Gloss and a brushoff with
aim!
