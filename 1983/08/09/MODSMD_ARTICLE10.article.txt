## Hoover mission a threat to University 
### 
The Hoover Institution and its
supporters are trying to per
suade the Stanford community
that certain questions cannot be
raised about Hoover's political
activities without violating the
academic freedom of individuals
at Hoover.
French Prof. Alphonse )uil
land, recently awarded the croix
de guerre by the Hoover Board
of Overseers for his efforts on
Hoover's behalf, warns of a
grave threat to academic free
dom if questions are raised
about the political role of
Hoover and its conservative
political bias. "If today you in
vestigate Hoover for conserative
bias," he said, "tomorrow you
investigate the Political Science
Department for its liberal bias."
(Daily, Aug. 2)
The flaw in Jutland's position
(and the failure to see it may help
explain why so many faculty
members signed his petition in
the spring) is that no one has
ever proposed an investigation
into Hoover's political bias. This
is partly because no one needs a
study to ascertain Hoover's bias.
The Institution is openly and
proudly conservative. Indeed, it
rarely misses an opportunity to
boast of its conservative political
connections.

of academic freedom when
academics exercise their rights

activities that advance political
causes.

Because the political beliefs of

are, if you'll pardon the phrase, a
red herring. They serve Hoover
by confusing the real issue and
deflecting attention away from
the essential questions that have
been identified so far in the de
bate.
To give Juilland his due, let us
acknowledge again that there is

agandize for a particular ideol
ogy, which actively promotes
the advancement of particular
political candidates, and which
can lay valid claim to the title of
"leading conservative think tank
in the country" compatible with
a university whose professed
values are dedicated to the non
partisan, nonpolitical, objective
search for truth?
Everyone knows that it is dif-

Stanford University. No other
university has anything compar
able to Hoover, and only the de
politicization of Hoover as an
organization will correct the
situation. Many members of the
Stanford community believe
that Stanford should r.ot be used
directly or indirectly to push par
tisan political causes. If we allow
this situation to continue we will
be in violation of our expressed
values as a university, and we
will endanger Stanford's reputa
tion for objectivity, on which
nothing less than our legitimacy
is based. If and when that day
comes Stanford may be so iden
tified with the right wing of the
political spectrum that our
claims to academic greatness
will be impeached by our com
mitments to the political cause
of conservatism.
In evaluating these issues,
consider what has happened to
the Hoover Institution underthe
directorship of W. Glenn
Campbell: nothing less than the
radical trasformation of a li
brary and archive into one of the
foremost centers of political re
search and advocacy in the
United States. If you talk to

people who were around
Hoover before Campbell, they
will tell you that Hoover's previ
ous directors were fairly
middle-of-the-road Republicans
who were rather circumspect
about the money they accepted
and the activities they encour
aged. As reported by the Palo
Alto Weekly, the expansion of
Hoover under Campbell has

there were no Hoover Fellows;

$9,000,000. Director Campbell
was apparently brought in to do

wanted something more than a
library and archive; under
Campbell they got it.
When the faculty and students
began questioning Hoover last
springourconcerns were met by
charges of "witch hunt" and ap
peals to academic freedom. It
should be noted that there is a
fine line between greeting op
ponents with such epithets as
"witch hunt" and engaging in

Juilland's definition of the issue
we will find ourselves in the
anomalous position of shutting

questions—in the name of

not only be a tragedy for free and
open and responsible discus

academic freedom itself.

the May 17, 1983 Los Angeles

the purpose of the Institution:
"to demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx" and "to
protect the American way of
life." As Wood put it: A Univer
sity has only one fundamental
mission: the pursuit of truth. To
extol the virtues of one political
and economic system while
condemning the faults of
another is an act of partisan ad
vocacy, not a declaration of
academic inquiry. "I wonder,"
he added "what the reaction of
conservative faculty members
and students would be to a
University-supported organiza
tion whose purpose is "to dem
onstrate the evils of capitalism"
and "to protect the socialistic
way of life."
The responsible discussion of
such questions does not en
danger academic freedom, it
exemplifies it.. In the coming
weeks there will be efforts to
limit discussion of the Hoover
Institution to questions of better
management and other "safe"
issues. The political activities of
the Hoover Institution, we are
told, are off limits. The problem
of Hoover, some University ad
ministrators contend further, is
not that Hoover is too closely en
twined with Stanford but that it
is not close enough. These are
valid positions for discussion
but the Stanford community
should be wary of efforts to re
strict the debate: the reason polit
ical activity lies at the heart of the
debate over Hoover is that
Hoover has been transformed
into a political organization.
How and why this transforma
tion occurred, and whether the
Stanford community wants such
an institution in our midst, are
the central concerns of a great
many members of the Stanford
community. It will be a black day
in Stanford's history if such
questions are barred from study
on the grounds of academic
freedom.

The flaw in Jutland's position
(and the failure to see it may help

Because the political beliefs of

are, if you'll pardon the phrase, a

To give Juilland his due, let us
acknowledge again that there is

ogy, which actively promotes
the advancement of particular
political candidates, and which
can lay valid claim to the title of
"leading conservative think tank

partisan, nonpolitical, objective

Everyone knows that it is dif-

Stanford University. No other
university has anything compar
able to Hoover, and only the de
politicization of Hoover as an
organization will correct the
situation. Many members of the
Stanford community believe
that Stanford should r.ot be used
directly or indirectly to push par
tisan political causes. If we allow
this situation to continue we will
be in violation of our expressed
values as a university, and we
will endanger Stanford's reputa

nothing less than our legitimacy
is based. If and when that day
comes Stanford may be so iden

political spectrum that our
claims to academic greatness
will be impeached by our com

In evaluating these issues,
consider what has happened to
the Hoover Institution underthe
directorship of W. Glenn
Campbell: nothing less than the
radical trasformation of a li

foremost centers of political re

United States. If you talk to

people who were around
Hoover before Campbell, they
will tell you that Hoover's previ

we will find ourselves in the

the purpose of the Institution:
