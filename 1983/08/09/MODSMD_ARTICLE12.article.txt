# Medical School study aids search for disease cures

Multiple sclerosis,
rheumatoid arthritis and
juvenile diabetes, incurable dis
eases linked to the body's im
mune system, may one day be
treatable, and possibly pre
vented by a new therapy devel
oped by researchers at the Med
ical Center.
The results of a study led by
Lawrence Steinman, assistant
professor of neurology, indicate
that scientists may have moved
"one step closer toward their
goal of turning immune diseases
off at the source."
This step is the result of
Steinman's research that fo

cusedon adiseasein mice which
acts much like the chronic dis
ease of the nervous system in
humans, myasthenia gravis. The
symptoms of this illness in hu
mans are fatigue and weakness
in muscles of the eye and throat,
causing double or blurred vision
and difficulty swallowing. More
than 8000 Americans suffer from
myasthenia gravis.
In healthy patients,
neuromuscular activity occures
as the result of nerve cells relay
ing messages from the brain to
the body's muscles via "chemi
cal messengers." These mes
sages are received by a protein
on the muscle, called

acetycholine receptor.
Patients with myasthenia
gravis, however, produce an
tibodies (proteins generated in
the blood in reaction to other
proteins) that destroy the "re
ceiving" protein: their immune
system becomes overactive. Be
cause the "messengers" no
longer have a terminal" in which
to be received," the normal ex
change of nerve impulses can no
longer take place.
Subramanian Sriram, a
member of Steinman's research
team, describes myasthenia
gravis as a disease in which "the
body fights against its own tis
sue, creating antibodies that de

stroy the proteins necessary for
the body's electrical system to
work."
Steinman and his team have
learned to genetically control
the symptoms of myasthenia
gravis in mice and feel that dis
eases linked to the immune sys
tem in humans might be treata
ble in the same way. In their
studies, the team has been able
to "locate" the disease gene
susceptibility in mice which
"tells" the cells in the immune
system to locate the gene in
mice which produces destroying
antibodies. In addition to pin
pointing this susceptibility gene,
the team has successfully

created "tailor-made" proteins
called monoclonal antibodies
which act by attaching them
selves onto a specific "un
healthy" gene and turning it off.
Once the defective gene was
turned off, Steinman said "nor
mal cell communication re
turned and the symptoms of the
disease disappeared."
Even after studying the mice
for up to a year after the experi
ments were done, no negative
side effects have been detected.
The advance could lead to
progress in the treatment of
gravis patients. The current
popular treatment uses a drug
with undesirable side effects,
Prednigone. This therapy tends
to "work quite well" in control
the symptoms of the disease by
inducing a suppression of the
entire immune system, yet it
causes high blood pressure,
weight loss and increased vul
nerability to infection.
The new therapy, identifica
tion of the gene that causes the
dieseases susceptibility and
then are "turning it off," could
hold answers for other patients
with genetically related diseases
such as multiple schlerosis (MS).
MS antibodies eat away the pro

tective sheath for nerve cells in
the brain and spinal cord, inter
fering with the normal functions
of nerve pathways.
Patients suffer from symptoms
such as sudden blindness, loss
of balance, stiff muscles and
jerky muscle movements in the
arms and legs. During the first
years, MS responds to treat
ments such as rest and physical
therapy. The disease and the
symptoms, however, gradually
worsen, leading to paralysis as
treatment grows ineffective.
The cause of the disease is still
unknown, as is the cure. Medi
researchers have searched for 20
years for the "mysterious anti
gens" in MS which cause the

immune system to fight against
itself. Steinman believes "\here
may not be a specific MS antigen
but instead a variety of antigens
that trigger the diseases." His
research team has taken a
different approach to the dis
ease based on their knowledge
gained from their treatment
breakthroughs in treating the
symptoms in mice of myasthenia
gravis.
This new treatment allows for
"proximity," making it possible
for physicians to direct their
treatment to specific defective
areas rather than suppressing
the body's total immune system,
as must be done with Pre
dnisone.
"It's a new and different type
of immune regulation," Stein
man said. "There's no certainty
that it will work in humans, but it
could be a major change from
the fairly brutal types of im
munosuppression that have
been done in the past."
