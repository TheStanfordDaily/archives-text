# Medical School study aids search for disease cures

Multiple sclerosis,
rheumatoid arthritis and
juvenile diabetes, incurable dis
eases linked to the body's im
mune system, may one day be
treatable, and possibly pre
vented by a new therapy devel
oped by researchers at the Med
ical Center.
The results of a study led by
Lawrence Steinman, assistant
professor of neurology, indicate
that scientists may have moved
"one step closer toward their
goal of turning immune diseases
off at the source."
This step is the result of
Steinman's research that fo

cusedon adiseasein mice which
acts much like the chronic dis
ease of the nervous system in
humans, myasthenia gravis. The
symptoms of this illness in hu
mans are fatigue and weakness
in muscles of the eye and throat,
causing double or blurred vision
and difficulty swallowing. More
than 8000 Americans suffer from
myasthenia gravis.
In healthy patients,
neuromuscular activity occures
as the result of nerve cells relay
ing messages from the brain to
the body's muscles via "chemi
cal messengers." These mes
sages are received by a protein
on the muscle, called

acetycholine receptor.
Patients with myasthenia
gravis, however, produce an
tibodies (proteins generated in
the blood in reaction to other
proteins) that destroy the "re
ceiving" protein: their immune
system becomes overactive. Be
cause the "messengers" no
longer have a terminal" in which
to be received," the normal ex
change of nerve impulses can no
longer take place.
Subramanian Sriram, a
member of Steinman's research
team, describes myasthenia
gravis as a disease in which "the
body fights against its own tis
sue, creating antibodies that de

stroy the proteins necessary for
the body's electrical system to
work."
Steinman and his team have
learned to genetically control
the symptoms of myasthenia
gravis in mice and feel that dis
eases linked to the immune sys
tem in humans might be treata
ble in the same way. In their
studies, the team has been able
to "locate" the disease gene
susceptibility in mice which
"tells" the cells in the immune
system to locate the gene in
mice which produces destroying
antibodies. In addition to pin
pointing this susceptibility gene,
the team has successfully

created "tailor-made" proteins
called monoclonal antibodies
which act by attaching them
selves onto a specific "un
healthy" gene and turning it off.
Once the defective gene was
turned off, Steinman said "nor
mal cell communication re
turned and the symptoms of the
disease disappeared."
Even after studying the mice
for up to a year after the experi
ments were done, no negative
side effects have been detected.
The advance could lead to
progress in the treatment of
gravis patients. The current
popular treatment uses a drug
