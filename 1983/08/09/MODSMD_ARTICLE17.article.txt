Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
That's what the 2000-plus at
the Circle Star Theater's 7 p.m.
Saturday night show heard for
most of the evening. They paid
to see Christopher Cross and
that's about all they did—saw
him. Listening to Cross and his
eight-man band was a different
story.
Cross was using a cordless
guitar (the same idea as a wire
less microphone) with the trans
forming equipment strapped to
his back. And Saturday night it
worked about as good as my
grammar.
The end result was a loud buzz
not unlike a mosquito hovering
over your eardrum it was espe
cially distracting between songs
and even could be heard during
thequiet parts of them. To offset
the problem, the sound men
cranked up the sound so loud
that the only thing buzzing after
the show were people's ears.
Cross and company minus the
pestering buzz was good,
though.
The pudgy Texan played and
sang most of the songs from his
only two albums as well as his
Grammy Award winning song
written for the movie Arthur.
While few of the concert ver
sions of the songs were ex
tended past the studio tracks, all

were crisply and professionally
played.
He played them to an audi
ence of couples. Newlyweds.
The type that went to Hawaii for
their honeymoon and have been
wearing aloha shirts ever since.
The lovebirds seemed familiar
enough with Cross's music, but
obviously are not big concert
goers.
As Cross and his band neared
the end of their final song—
"Ride Like the Wind"—the
couples began streaming up the
aisles towards the Circle Star's
exits like there were two out in
the bottom of the ninth of a
Giants game. What about en
cores? Probably left them in the
islands with their savage tan
coconut oil.
When Cross opened his
mouth for the first time in the
first song, most of the new
lyweds did a double-take. Cross,
a hefty, balding character who is
the owner of a Texas drawl,
looks nothing like he sounds.
He looks in his 30s and sounds in
his teens. Early teens. Nonethe
less, his high voice, pre
pubescent sounding voice is
very clear and very listenable.
No doubt both his albums have
been best sellers.
Most of all, however, Cross is
personable. He has a keen sense
of humor and it was obvious

many of his on stage jokes were
on-the-spot inventions.
The guitarist/vocalist intro
duced a song from his 1983 LP,
Another Page, called "Baby Says
No" as a tune about "a guy
who'sso in love with this girl that
he doesn't care that she doesn't
want to 'give it up.' "
Cross also cares about his
music. He even said so.
While playing the introduc
tion to a serious love song called
"Words of Wisdom," a stage
hand was adjusting his cordless
guitar equipment on his strap.
Just as he began singing, Cross
suddenly stepped back from the
microphone and stopped the
band.
"Hold it,"he said. "I really
care about these songs and I
simply can't play them with
some guy crawling all over my
back." Cross cracked a spon
taneous joke or two about the
failure of his guitar hook-up and
then proceeded to restart
"Words of Wisdom," which, by
the way, he sang with probably
more feeling than the rest of the
show's songs.
Cross is a better-than-decent
guitarist, too. He soloed in
about half the songs, playing the
compostitions of top-notch
studio musicians equally as well.
When not soloing and just sing
ing, Cross easily took care of the

lead guitar role, an ability many
pop rock singer/guitarists don't
possess.
As funny, caring or talented as
Cross is, one can't help but
wonder if there is a place for his
high voice and pop, easy listen
ing sounds in the ever-changing
world of contemporary n • isic. If
the growing popularity „. soft
rock stations like KYUU is any

indication, there most definitely
is.
But Cross will have to put out
albums more often if he is to stay
afloat. He took a three-year vaca
tion between albums on his first
two and if it wasn't for the saving
grace of a few hit songs on
Another Page, he might already
be washed ashore.
