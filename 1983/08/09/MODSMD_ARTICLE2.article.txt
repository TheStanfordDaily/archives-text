# Green Party member blasts placement of 'Euromissiles'
## 
### AFSHIN PEDRAM 
In a speech timed to coincide
with the 43rd anniversary of the
atomic destruction of
Hiroshima, a member of the
West German Green Party told a
Terman Auditorium audience
Saturday that many Europeans
are "deeply concerned" over
what she called the "Euromissile
crisis."
Marie Luise Beck-Oberdorf,
parliamentary speaker for her
party, strongly denounced the
deployment of U.S. Pershing II
and cruise missiles in Western
Europe. She said that public
support, both in Europe and in
the United States, must be
mobilized to oppose the "es
calating arms race."
Beck-Oberdorf questioned
whether peace can ever be
genuinely promoted in Europe if
the superpowers seek military
parity through a mutually as
sured destruction strategy.
From the Green Party perspec
tive, striving for military equality
without reducing the arms race
logically implies the need for the
superpowers to be prepared for
the possibility of an unexpected

war game scenario outbreak.
Beck-Oberdorf used this argu
ment to illustrate the escalating
arms race between the two
superpowers in light of the gen
eral stalemate in present-day
arms negotiations.
Beck-Oberdorf said that link
ing NATO security interests
solely to anti-communism and
instilling "paranoia" over the
spectre of communism among
the German popoulation is a
convenient way to fuel the en
gines of war machines at the ex
pense of even reducing social
welfare, as is the present case in
West Germany.
Having criticized the strategic
viability of the theory of deter
rence, Beck-Oberdorf pointed
out the "fallacies" of the 1979
"double-track" decision result
ing in the scheduled deploy
ment of the Pershing II and
cruise missiles in December
1983. The "double-track" deci
sion was proposed by former
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in a
1977 London speech.
From the Social Democratic
perspective voiced by Schmidt,
the Soviet SS-4 and SS-5 missiles

required a NATO response well
before the Soviets deployed
their successors — the SS-20
missiles in 1977. At that time,
NATO placed under its orders
three U.S. operational nuclear
missile-launching submarines,
armed subsequently with Polaris
missiles from 1965, Poseidon
missiles after 1971 and Trident
missiles in the 1980s.
The 400 to 480 nuclear
warheads of those medium
range missilesarecomparablein
number and accuracy to the
SS-20 warheads.
Beck-Oberdorf said the SS-20
was just a progressive replace
ment for the outdated SS-4 and
SS-5. Such a deployment did not
signify a technological military
breakthrough in the strategic
balance of forces between the
NATO and Warsaw Pact.
Beck-Oberdorf then argued
that the Pershing II and cruise
missiles do not even belong to
the same intermediate-range
category — intermediate-range
ballistic missiles — but to the
lower medium-range ballistic
missile category.
