Coup topples Guatemalan chief
Guatemala City — Defense Minister Oscar
Humberto Mejia Victores seized the presidency
yesterday from evangelist Brig. Gen. Efrain Rios
Montt in a move the military command said was
necessary to halt "religious fanaticism."
The president of the Supreme Court,
Ricardo Sagastume Vidaurre, swore in the new mil
itary president at the National Palace, the seat of
government, Monday afternoon.
An unconfirmed report said Rios Montt and
some supporters were holding out in the Presiden
tial House, adjacent to the National Palace.
Local reporters said two soldiers were killed and
at least three others were wounded in fighting
near the palace.
While planes and helicopters circled the palace
earlier in the day, the National radio broadcast a
nine-point proclamation from the military com
mand, saying Rios Montt, a convert from
Guatemala's predominant Roman Catholicism to a
fundamentalist Protestant sect, had been replaced
by Mejia Victores, who also is a brigadier general.

Anchorwoman wins case
Kansas City, Mo. — A federal jury yesterday
found Metromedia Inc. guilty of fraud in the $1.2
million lawsuit brought by former TV anchor
woman Christine Craft, who contended she was
demoted because of her age and appearance.
The four-woman, two-man jury also issued an
advisory verdict urging the judge to find
Metromedia guilty of sex discrimination, but dis
agreed with Ms. Craft's claim that the company
violated equal-pay laws.
On the fraud charge, damages were assessed at
$375,000, but jurors still have to hear further argu
ments before punitive damages are assessed.
Ms. Craft contended in the fraud charge that the
company said it was hiring her for her journalistic
abilities, not her appearance.
Telephone strike continues
Callers across America sometimes got apologies
instead of operators as the nationwide strike by tel
ephone workers entered its second day yesterday,

but automatic equipment handled the crush of
business calls without reports of problems.
Thousands of the strikers carried signs outside
American Telephone & Telegraph company facil
ities around the nation, but few picket-line prob
lems were reported. Phone company officials in
several states, however, reported yesterday that
scattered acts of vandalism cut service to hundreds
of people.
"The key thing for most customers is they are
seeing no effect because direct-dial calls are going
through," said Pat Montgomery, a spokeswoman
for Illinois Bell. Her comments were echoed by
Bell officials around the country whose companies
serve about 150 million telephones — 80 percent
of the U.S. total.
Today's weather
Morning low clouds clearing to the coast by
noon. Highs 60 at the coast to the 80s inland. To
night and tomorrow, fair except overnight low
clouds. Lows in the 50s and highs in the 80s.
