# Proposed Reagan library fuels Hoover controversy
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
Professors here are con
cerned that housing the Reagan
presidential library and center
for public affairs on campus will
expand the role of the Hoover
Institution within the
University—a role that is already
too large, in their opinion.
Political Science Prof. John
Manleyand English Prof. Ronald
Rebholz, the leaders of the peti
tion drive in the spring that
called for an investigation of the
relations between the Hoover
Institution and the University,
warned that a Reagan library and
public policy center here could
"seriously divide the Stantord
community unless provision is
made for full and open campus
discussion" of the proposed
centers.
Discussions between the
White House and W. Glenn
Campbell, director of the Hoover
Institution, about housing the
Reagan library here have gone
on since Reagan became presi
dent. The former governor of
California has already deposited
his gubernatorial, campaign and
transition papers at the Hoover
Institution.
The possibility of having the
library here advanced one more
step Thursday when University
President Donald Kennedy an
nounced the appointment of a
nine-member faculty committee
to study "the kinds of academic
benefits that might accrue to
Stanford" through the posses
sion of the Reagan papers.
The committee will also inves
tigate the academic merits of
housing the "Ronald Reagan
Center for Public Affairs," an ad
junct to the library designed to
facilitate debate and analysis of
political issues.
Kennedy has asked the ad hoc
committee to report to him by
Oct. I—an early date that
doesn't allow time for questions
to be raised, according to Man
ley and Rebholz.
"If the time schedule is fol
lowed, all of this will be pre
sented as a fait accompliManley
said.
Because the committee was
formed in mid-August, with few
professors and students around,
the committee might have the
appearance of ramming through
the library and policy center
proposals, Manley said.
"It shuts off free expression,"
he said, "in a University that's
supposed to be dedicated to it."
Rebholz suggested that the
timing was a "deliberate move to

get this shoved through" before
students and faculty could have
time to organize and articulate
opposition.
However, Economics Prof,
lames Rosse, the committee's
chair, said the October report
date was set because Kennedy
wanted the board of trustees to
be informed of the stage of the
study—though not necessarily
receive the final report —at their
October meeting. The board will
not meet again until December,
Rosse said.
Manley also said that none of
the nine committee members
were among the 84 faculty
members that signed Manley
and Rebholz's petition calling
for a re-evaluation of the
Stanford-Hoover relationship.
In fact, Rosse signed an oppos
ing petition supporting
Hoover's presence on campus.
Rebholz charged that the
committee members had been
chosen in view of the decision
that Campbell and Kennedy
wanted them to make—that is,
to agree to house the library.
Rebholz admitted that some
"responsible historians" are on
the committee, but he said that
"historians will inevitably want
that archive."

However, Rosse replied that
the committee "as a whole is
pretty well-balanced."
"It's awfully early to be mak
ing judgments about people's
prejudices," he said.
Manley and Rebholz particu
larly objected to the proposed
Reagan public policy center.
This center will clearly be "an
extension of the Hoover Institu
tion," Rebholz said.
Manley agreed. "I'm not sure
the Stanford community wants
to be associated with that," he
said.


John Manley
Manley said he didn't want to
pre-|udge the scholarly value of
the Reagan papers. But the issue
is not the academic value of the
papers, he said, but the expan
sion of Hoover's role at a time
when the University is sup
posedly reassessing its relation
ship with the conservative think
tank.
In May, the faculty senate
voted overwhelmingly to urge
the board of trustees to appoint
a committee to "explore and

reassess the relations between
the Hoover Institution and the
University."
But the proposed library and
the center will "further cement
the relations between Stanford
and the Reagan administration,"
Manley said, even though as a
result of the faculty senate vote
the University is "allegedly
exploring and re-evaluating"
those relations.
"Some people are already jok
ing about this becoming Ronald
Reagan University," Manley
said.
Rebholz questioned the ap
propriateness of housing

Reagan's library here, consider
ing that the president was never
a student at Stanford.
"Reagan has absolutely no as
sociation with Stanford Univer
sity whatsoever," Rebholz said.
The president's association
with Hoover and Campbell,
combined with his desire to de
posit his papers at a "famous
West Coast university," led him
to consider housing his library
here, Rebholz said.
A presidential library at
Eureka, Illinois, where the pres
ident went to college, was just
"too ludicrous for him to ac
cept," Rebholz said.

White House and W. Glenn
Campbell, director of the Hoover
Institution, about housing the
Reagan library here have gone
on since Reagan became presi
dent. The former governor of
California has already deposited
his gubernatorial, campaign and
transition papers at the Hoover
Institution.
The possibility of having the
library here advanced one more
step Thursday when University
President Donald Kennedy an
nounced the appointment of a
nine-member faculty committee
to study "the kinds of academic
benefits that might accrue to
Stanford" through the posses
sion of the Reagan papers.
The committee will also inves
tigate the academic merits of
housing the "Ronald Reagan
Center for Public Affairs," an ad
junct to the library designed to
facilitate debate and analysis of
political issues.
Kennedy has asked the ad hoc
committee to report to him by
Oct. I—an early date that
doesn't allow time for questions
to be raised, according to Man
ley and Rebholz.
"If the time schedule is fol
lowed, all of this will be pre
sented as a fait accompliManley
said.
Because the committee was
formed in mid-August, with few
professors and students around,
the committee might have the
appearance of ramming through
the library and policy center
proposals, Manley said.
"It shuts off free expression,"
he said, "in a University that's
supposed to be dedicated to it."
Rebholz suggested that the
timing was a "deliberate move to

get this shoved through" before
students and faculty could have
time to organize and articulate
opposition.
However, Economics Prof,
lames Rosse, the committee's
chair, said the October report
date was set because Kennedy
wanted the board of trustees to
be informed of the stage of the
study—though not necessarily
receive the final report —at their
October meeting. The board will
not meet again until December,
Rosse said.
Manley also said that none of
the nine committee members
were among the 84 faculty
members that signed Manley
and Rebholz's petition calling
for a re-evaluation of the
Stanford-Hoover relationship.
In fact, Rosse signed an oppos
ing petition supporting
Hoover's presence on campus.
Rebholz charged that the
committee members had been
chosen in view of the decision
that Campbell and Kennedy
wanted them to make—that is,
to agree to house the library.
Rebholz admitted that some
"responsible historians" are on
the committee, but he said that
"historians will inevitably want
that archive."

However, Rosse replied that
the committee "as a whole is
pretty well-balanced."
"It's awfully early to be mak
ing judgments about people's
prejudices," he said.
Manley and Rebholz particu
larly objected to the proposed
Reagan public policy center.
This center will clearly be "an
extension of the Hoover Institu
tion," Rebholz said.
Manley agreed. "I'm not sure
the Stanford community wants
to be associated with that," he
said.


John Manley
Manley said he didn't want to
pre-|udge the scholarly value of
the Reagan papers. But the issue
is not the academic value of the
papers, he said, but the expan
sion of Hoover's role at a time
when the University is sup
posedly reassessing its relation
ship with the conservative think
tank.
In May, the faculty senate
voted overwhelmingly to urge
the board of trustees to appoint
a committee to "explore and

reassess the relations between
the Hoover Institution and the
University."
But the proposed library and
the center will "further cement
the relations between Stanford
and the Reagan administration,"
Manley said, even though as a
result of the faculty senate vote
the University is "allegedly
exploring and re-evaluating"
those relations.
"Some people are already jok
ing about this becoming Ronald
Reagan University," Manley
said.
Rebholz questioned the ap
propriateness of housing

Reagan's library here, consider
ing that the president was never
a student at Stanford.
"Reagan has absolutely no as
sociation with Stanford Univer
sity whatsoever," Rebholz said.
The president's association
with Hoover and Campbell,
combined with his desire to de
posit his papers at a "famous
West Coast university," led him
to consider housing his library
here, Rebholz said.
A presidential library at
Eureka, Illinois, where the pres
ident went to college, was just
"too ludicrous for him to ac
cept," Rebholz said.
