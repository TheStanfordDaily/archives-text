### BRYCE LEE 
A Stanford professor
walked away unhurt from his
demolished plane Sunday
after making an emergency
landing in a marsh just south
of the Dumbarton bridge.
Jerome Yesavage, as assis
tant professor of psychiatry,
was on a training flight from
Livermore. He had already
started his approach at Palo
Alto Airport when the engine
of the Cessna 152 he was fly
ing malfunctioned.
According to airport offi
cials, Yesavage radioed about

9 a.m. that he was looking for
a place to make an
emergency landing.
Soon after, Yesavage
"landed" his plane belly-up
in a swamp near the Dumbar
ton bridge. According to
Fremont police, he untangled
himself from his battered
plane and waded waist-deep
in mud to the shore.
Preliminary results of a
police investigiation indicate
that the crash was the result
of an "engine malfunction"
rather than pilot error.
