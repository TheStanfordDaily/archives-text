# Property of 'Jogging Burglar' returned
## 
### MARC JEFFERSON 
Convicted burglar Robert Lee
O'Connor and his girlfriend,
Nancy Burt, will receive some of
the property seized from them by
the Stanford police department,
but only that property which they
have been able to prove was theirs
before the beginning of the crime
spree, according to Stanford Police
Capt. Raul Niemeyer.
In addition, the auction of the
goods recovered from the pos
session of O'Connor, the so
called "jogging burglar," has
been rescheduled for Sept. 17.
The auction, originally sche
duled for July 8 and 9, was
postponed when O'Connor and
Burt claimed that all of the un
claimed goods were theirs.

Richard Roggia, Burt's attor
ney, was unavailable for com
ment.
Captain Niemeyer and a
number of people from the
Santa Clara County Public Ad
mininstrator's office will be
meeting to review all of the claim
forms from those victims who
may not have been able to view
the goods which were removed
from O'Connors home. These
claims will be settled before the
auction takes place.
O'Connor's crime spree
began in 1978, and continued
until his arrest by Stanford
police in November 1982. He
may have been involved in as
many as 18 burglaries in the area,

as well as a number of others
across the nation.
He would case the neighbor
hood of a prospective victim
while jogging through it, and
hence earned the sobriquet of
"jogging burglar." O'Connor
plead guilty to 21 counts of
burglary, and is now serving a
19-year sentence in Folsom
prison. Burt was sentenced to a
year in the county jail after
pleading guilty to one count of
receiving stolen goods.
O'Connor's estranged wife,
Maureen Martinez, who was
also found guilty of receiving
stolen goods, already claimed
her personal property through
her parents.
