# Teachers soften on standardized tests
## 
### 
Washington—The nation's
largest teachers' union, which
waged a bitter, vitriolic war
against standardized student
testing during the 19705, has
quietly scrapped the last ves
tiges of its anti-testing rhetoric.
The National Education asso
ciation, which 10 years ago
called for a moratorium on all
standardized tests in the
schools, adopted a new, more
positive policy at its convention
in Philadelphia last month.
Some 7200 union delegates
made the change without de
bate as they approved dozens of
resolutions in the waning hours
of the NEA's week-long meeting.
"It looks like we softened on
testingand nobody even knew,"
said one surprised NEA staff
member, who spoke only on the
condition she not be identified.
Between 1973 and 1978, the

union sought a total moratorium
on standardized tests and in re
cent years had opposed giving
any test that was "potentially
damaging to a student's self
concept," biased, "used in an
exploitive manner by the media"
or otherwise objectionable.
The NEA focused its fire on
mass-produced, multiple
choice exams such as the
Scholastic Aptitude Test and the
lowa Test of Basic Skills, which
are given in thousands of Ameri
can schools each year. NEA ob
jected vehemently to using stu
dent scores to compare schools
and contended many tests were
unfair to minorities. In general
minorities and the poor usually
score far below average on tests
such as the SAT.
