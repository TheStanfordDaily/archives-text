# Agreement possible by summer
## 
### 
Washington—Moscow has taken a number of
steps in recent weeks that have led some high
ranking U.S. officials to conclude that a com
prehensive arms control agreement is possible,
if not likely, by early next summer.
These officials, who insisted on anonymity,
say Moscow has signalled it wants better rela
tions and that Washington is responding. They
believe President Reagan and Soviet leader Yuri
Andropov will hold a summit meeting if an arms
agreement is reached.
Such a summit would probably be held prior
to the Republican and Democratic party con
ventions next summer. There would be obvi
ous political benefits for Reagan—if he seeks
re-election—since it could divert attention
from the Democratic convention, scheduled in
July, and help portray Reagan as a man of peace
in time for the Republican convention in Au
gust.
The officials, highly placed in both the State
Department and the Arms Control and Disar
mament Agency, offered an even more op
timistic assessment of arms control talks in
Geneva than did chief negotiator Edward
Rowny at the White House last Friday.
Rowny, just back from the latest round of
strategic arms reduction (STARTS) talks, told
reporters there was new flexibility in the posi
tions of both Moscow and Washington, but an
agreement was still "a long way off."
But the officials cite the following devel
opments that point to a Soviet desire to im
prove relations with the Reagan adminstration
and which signal probable progress at Geneva:
—The decision to let members of the Pen
tecostal religious sect leave the Soviet Union
after five years of living in asylum at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow.
—Signals given to U.S. officials that some
Soviet political dissidents will be allowed to
leave the Soviet Union before the end of the
year.
—The decision to quickly conclude a five
year grain agreement with Washington.
—Moscow's acceptance of a compromise
that will break a deadlock and lead to an agree

ment in the three-year-old conference on
East-West security at Madrid. The compromise
will lead to a follow-up conference on human
rights and human contacts.
—Concessions by Moscow at the Geneva
START talks, specifically dropping its insistence
on a ban against air-launched cruise missiles.
U.S. counter-concessions at START have
sharply reduced the remaining differences in
the number of strategic weapons each wants
the other to agree on, and U.S. officials say
these differences are now bridgeable.
"There are indications the Soviet Union is
negotiating seriously," said one official, mean
ing Moscow is serious about wanting a strategic
arms control accord that is fair to both sides.
Another official said that latest Soviet propo
sals, if accepted, already amounts to an im
provement over the unratified SALT 2 agree
ment.
But Rowny told reporters, and the others of
ficials agreed, that a START agreement is virtu
ally out of the question without a companion
agreement on the European-based nuclear
missiles, the subject of parallel negotiations on
intermediate range nuclear forces in Geneva,
known as INF.
One official said "it would split the alliance"
if Washington agreed to a strategic arms
agreement that didn't also put limits on Soviet
missiles targeted on Europe and U.S. missiles
based in Europe.
The United States, under the auspices of
NATO, will begin deploying cruise and Persh
ing II missiles in Europe later this year, as no
agreement is expected before then. Moscow is
expected to protest, perhaps by walking out of
the Geneva intermediate-range talks. But one
official predicted such a walkout would be
temporary and only for propaganda purposes.
While it is too early to decide on a Reagan-
Andropov summit, State Department officials
say one is a virtual certainty if there is an arms
control agreement —to enable the two leaders
to initial the accord that would make them both
look good with their respective constituencies.
