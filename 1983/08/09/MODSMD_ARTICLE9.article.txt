# Anti-Sandinistas may obtain asylum
## 
### 
Washington â€” Secretary of
State George Shultz Sunday
gave strong public support to
CIA-backed guerrillas fighting
the government of Nicaragua
and said that if they get into a
jam, they may be able to obtain
asylum in the United States.
Interviewed on "Meet the
Press" (NBC) Shultz did not for
mally acknowledge that the
anti-Sandinista "secret army" is
receiving covert CIA aid, despite
a statement by one of his ques
tioners that this is "an open sec
ret."
Nonetheless, Shultz gave un
usually explicit backing to the
guerrillas' cause, saying "their
goal is one that, given our opin
ion of that (Sandinista) govern
ment, we can hardly turn away
from."
Asked if U.S. forces would
intervene to "save the skins" of
the guerrillas in case they suffer
military reverses, Shultz replied:
"Well, if they seek to leave some
place and want asylum or some
thing like that, well, they may
come here."
Shultz's statement was be
lieved to be the first by a senior
U.S. official publicly suggesting
the possibility that the ClA
backed forces, presently re
ported to number more than
10,000 and reportedly being
built up by the CIA to 12,000 to
15,000, might be given asylum
here if they fail to oust the San
dinista regime.
Until recently, U.S. officials
generally declined to comment
about anti-government guerril
las in Nicaragua, citing a stan

dard practice of not discussing
intelligance matters. Since the
"secret army" became the sub
ject of a lengthy debate in the
House, which voted July 28 to
ban further CIA aid to the in
surgency, officials have begun
to speak of the guerrillas more
openly, though usually still in
guarded terms.
Shultz said the administration
has by no means accepted the
House vote as "the final verdict"
on the anti-government in
surgency in Nicaragua, pointing
out that the Senate has not acted
to cut off U.S. support of the op
eration and that President Kea
gan has not signed such legisla
tion into law.
While taking the House vote
"very seriously," Shultz said,
"we're going to work hard" to
see that Congress does not vote
to terminate U.S. backing for the
operation.
The secretary repeated the of
ficial U.S. position that the U.S.
government is "not trying to"
overthrow the leftist Sandinista
government. A law passed last
December and signed into law
by Reagan forbids covert U.S.
aid "for the purpose" of over
throwing that government.
Shultz conceded in testimony
before the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee last Thursday
that it "certainly is" the aim of
anti-Sandinista forces to over
throw the Managua govern
ment.
