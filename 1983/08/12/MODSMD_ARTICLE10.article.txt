## Shape up but don't slip up How not to get hurt if you succumb to the jazz-aerobics craze

Now that Stayin' Alive and Flashdance
have become the hottest movies around,
it isn't surprising to see Americans getting
in the mood for exercise. Aerobics clas
ses are popping up just as fast as leotards
can be pulled on. Even men are getting in
the act. The goal is achieving total
fitness—to good music in an enthusiastic
atmosphere.
Aerobic conditioning is the newest
"in" sport going. This total conditioning
consists of working all muscles plus giv
ing the heart and lungs a vigorous work
out. It is also fun and the results are a

body proud to be thinly clad in a clingy
leotard. You can bet Jennifer
"Flashdance" Beals herself spends many
an hour at aerobics class working up a
good sweat. Now it seems everyone is
getting into the act.
When considering a place to begin
molding the "new you," or just improv
ing your already fit physique, keep in
mind these guidelines when searching
for an aerobics gym that teaches safe, ef
fective, challenging aerobics.
First, building endurance for your car
diovascular system is primary. (All the
muscle strength in the world does no

good if you can't jog around the block.)
A combination of both muscle strength
and endurance is optimum. Rigorous
stretching also keeps muscle tissue flexi
ble, toned and less prone to injury.
While exercising, it is important to
monitor your pulse to keep it at a training
level and not too high. Too many beats a
minute can damage your myocardial tissue,
or heart muscle.
Total fitness is a combination of muscle
strength, endurance and flexibility. The
results are an increase in your energy
level, decrease in pounds and a better
feeling about yourself.

And who knows? Maybe the john
Travolta or Jennifer Beals of your dreams
will be perspiring next to you in class and
dance his or her way into your life.
So that you don't have to endure too
easy, too expensive or too dangerous
aerobics classes before you find the best
one for you, here is a guide to the local
aerobics facilities and how they rate:
