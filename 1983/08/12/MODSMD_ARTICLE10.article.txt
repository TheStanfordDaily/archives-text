## Shape up but don't slip up How not to get hurt if you succumb to the jazz-aerobics craze 
### JENNA DEANGELES 
Now that Stayin' Alive and Flashdance
have become the hottest movies around,
it isn't surprising to see Americans getting
in the mood for exercise. Aerobics clas
ses are popping up just as fast as leotards
can be pulled on. Even men are getting in
the act. The goal is achieving total
fitness—to good music in an enthusiastic
atmosphere.
Aerobic conditioning is the newest
"in" sport going. This total conditioning
consists of working all muscles plus giv
ing the heart and lungs a vigorous work
out. It is also fun and the results are a

body proud to be thinly clad in a clingy
leotard. You can bet Jennifer
"Flashdance" Beals herself spends many
an hour at aerobics class working up a
good sweat. Now it seems everyone is
getting into the act.
When considering a place to begin
molding the "new you," or just improv
ing your already fit physique, keep in
mind these guidelines when searching
for an aerobics gym that teaches safe, ef
fective, challenging aerobics.
First, building endurance for your car
diovascular system is primary. (All the
muscle strength in the world does no

good if you can't jog around the block.)
A combination of both muscle strength
and endurance is optimum. Rigorous
stretching also keeps muscle tissue flexi
ble, toned and less prone to injury.
While exercising, it is important to
monitor your pulse to keep it at a training
level and not too high. Too many beats a
minute can damage your myocardial tissue,
or heart muscle.
Total fitness is a combination of muscle
strength, endurance and flexibility. The
results are an increase in your energy
level, decrease in pounds and a better
feeling about yourself.

And who knows? Maybe the john
Travolta or Jennifer Beals of your dreams
will be perspiring next to you in class and
dance his or her way into your life.
So that you don't have to endure too
easy, too expensive or too dangerous
aerobics classes before you find the best
one for you, here is a guide to the local
aerobics facilities and how they rate:
Fonda's—San Francisco. Jane Fonda,
Shame on you! The teachers are en
thusiastic, but only about getting your

money. And then they forget
what fitness is. With only three
minutes of aerobics, not even a
bead of perspiration forms on a
brow. You'll leave with a good
leg workout, but vour heart and
lungs will be rotting in your
chest. Fonda's is overpriced at $6
a class and you're better off
somewhere else.
Move It—Los Gatos. Twenty
minutes of aerobics is more like
it, but the jerky, uncontrolled
movements and uncoordinated
steps here make class clumsy.
The facilities are large. The
showers there are convenient
and class size is about 30

people. The pi ice is $5.50 a class.
A little high, but comparable.
lazzercise —Palo Alto. 1 his silk
class is more like a leotard tash
ion show than an exercise ses
sion. The class, horribly over
crowded, taught on a hard gym
nasium floor is detrimental to
knees and feet. There is more
"body-watching" than exercise
here, a lot of prancing and kick
ing that does no actual good.
Three bucks a class to fake
some trivial moves is fun for
some, but you'll never have a
"bodv beautiful" because it is so
physically undemanding. The
teachers are enthusiastic and
motivating, with "Whoops'" and
"Yeahs" but the people are
there for atmosphere.
Elite Body Work—Menlo Park.
It you want strong arm- then

this is the place, but there are no
aerobics. The teacher, a body
builder, is concerned primarily
with muscle and not total fit
ness. There was no warm-up, a
dangerous practice tor muscles.
The bar work, resembling ballet,
was enjoyable. Class was small (six
to eight people). Cost for 45 min
utes wa>. $5.50.
Heartwork—Palo Alto. Lower
back: Beware of abuse! There
are many back injuries lingering
around ever\ class, potentially
really hurting someone over a
long term. I hey teach poor form
and the short warm-up adds to a
big potential for bad backs.
Aerobic training was 10 minutes,
but boring and jerky. For $2.50,
all you are buying is a line of sore
vertebras.

atmosphere.
Aerobic conditioning is the newest
"in" sport going. This total conditioning
consists of working all muscles plus giv
ing the heart and lungs a vigorous work
out. It is also fun and the results are a

body proud to be thinly clad in a clingy
leotard. You can bet Jennifer
"Flashdance" Beals herself spends many
an hour at aerobics class working up a
good sweat. Now it seems everyone is
getting into the act.
When considering a place to begin
molding the "new you," or just improv
ing your already fit physique, keep in
mind these guidelines when searching
for an aerobics gym that teaches safe, ef
fective, challenging aerobics.
First, building endurance for your car
diovascular system is primary. (All the
muscle strength in the world does no

good if you can't jog around the block.)
A combination of both muscle strength
and endurance is optimum. Rigorous
stretching also keeps muscle tissue flexi
ble, toned and less prone to injury.
While exercising, it is important to
monitor your pulse to keep it at a training
level and not too high. Too many beats a
minute can damage your myocardial tissue,
or heart muscle.
Total fitness is a combination of muscle
strength, endurance and flexibility. The
results are an increase in your energy
level, decrease in pounds and a better
feeling about yourself.

And who knows? Maybe the john
Travolta or Jennifer Beals of your dreams
will be perspiring next to you in class and
dance his or her way into your life.
So that you don't have to endure too
easy, too expensive or too dangerous
aerobics classes before you find the best
one for you, here is a guide to the local
aerobics facilities and how they rate:
Fonda's—San Francisco. Jane Fonda,
Shame on you! The teachers are en
thusiastic, but only about getting your

money. And then they forget
what fitness is. With only three
minutes of aerobics, not even a
bead of perspiration forms on a
brow. You'll leave with a good
leg workout, but vour heart and
lungs will be rotting in your
chest. Fonda's is overpriced at $6
a class and you're better off
somewhere else.
Move It—Los Gatos. Twenty
minutes of aerobics is more like
it, but the jerky, uncontrolled
movements and uncoordinated
steps here make class clumsy.
The facilities are large. The
showers there are convenient
and class size is about 30

people. The pi ice is $5.50 a class.
A little high, but comparable.
lazzercise —Palo Alto. 1 his silk
class is more like a leotard tash
ion show than an exercise ses
sion. The class, horribly over
crowded, taught on a hard gym
nasium floor is detrimental to
knees and feet. There is more
"body-watching" than exercise
here, a lot of prancing and kick
ing that does no actual good.
Three bucks a class to fake
some trivial moves is fun for
some, but you'll never have a
"bodv beautiful" because it is so
physically undemanding. The
teachers are enthusiastic and
motivating, with "Whoops'" and
"Yeahs" but the people are
there for atmosphere.
Elite Body Work—Menlo Park.
It you want strong arm- then

this is the place, but there are no
aerobics. The teacher, a body
builder, is concerned primarily
with muscle and not total fit
ness. There was no warm-up, a
dangerous practice tor muscles.
The bar work, resembling ballet,
was enjoyable. Class was small (six
to eight people). Cost for 45 min
utes wa>. $5.50.
Heartwork—Palo Alto. Lower
back: Beware of abuse! There
are many back injuries lingering
around ever\ class, potentially
really hurting someone over a
long term. I hey teach poor form
and the short warm-up adds to a
big potential for bad backs.
Aerobic training was 10 minutes,
but boring and jerky. For $2.50,
all you are buying is a line of sore
vertebras.
Hearbeal l td.—Palo Alto. Vea!

Ltd., Stanford junior Christy
Nichols said, "This sure beat>

every muscle in my whole body
has been worked. There were
even muscles I didn't know I
had."
