# Sailing away on Stanford's Lavengro

### TIM GRIEVE 
I guess it all started when Dad
turned 40.
Ever since that day in 1982,
Dad has spoken of nothing hut
sailboats.
In the old davs Dad would pile
the family into our big red Old
smobile and drive to the Coloma
to see where John Marshall dis
covered gold. Now he takes the
family to marinas—to see the
boats.
He's dragged Mother along to
countless boat shows, boat
stores, boat races and even boat
movies.
He's told me about the "fresh
breeze in your face," the "in
credible quiet out on the water
and more than I could ever want
to know about jetties, genoas
and jibs.
That's why a press release that
crossed my desk a couple weeks
ago caught my eye.
Stanford's Director of Sailing
was offering me an introduc
tion to big boat sailing aboard
Stanford's own Lavengro.
Great idea. I convinced Mike
Donovan, the man in charge of
the Sunday Sailing Seminars, to
let Dad come along.
Dad talked about the planned
trip for weeks. He spent hours
trying to figure out if the Laven
gro would be a ketch or a yawl
and even longer trying to tell me
the difference.
Finally, the big day arrived.
We left home in Sacramento

practically before dawn, stop
ped for gas and a greasy break
fast in Sacramento's industrial
section and hit the docks an
hour early—something I'm sure
Dad had planned just so he
could look at another marina full
of boats.
When the press, release said
"big boat sailing," I expected
something along the lines of a
cruise ship. Wrong. While at 45
feet Lavengro isn't tiny, it isn't
exactly the Love Boat either.
Mike Donovan offered the
pre-trip safety briefing.
"Even if we popped a plank I
have my doubts that she would
sink completely. . .
That's what they said about
the Titanic.
Mike explained that a trip on
the Lavengro with its fairly non
functional transmission is "not
unsafe—if you know the condi
tions."
I didn't.
He showed us where the life
jackets were, and what we
should do in case someone went
overboard. "Everyday someone
goes overboard on the Bay," he
warned. "I've done it before my
self."
Great.
Donovan introduced Laven
gro's skipper, Luke from Bel
gium, tothe 10 of uswho would
be the boat's crew for the day.
Only Luke from Belgium was
downstairs — excuse me

DARING DAD: Curt Grieve, the author's father, takes over the helm as Lavengro races toward a
collision with the Atlantic Maru, a menacing supertanker. With the help of the boat's skipper, Luke
from Belgium, Grieve managed to avert disaster.
