# Sailing away on Stanford's Lavengro
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
I guess it all started when Dad
turned 40.
Ever since that day in 1982,
Dad has spoken of nothing hut
sailboats.
In the old davs Dad would pile
the family into our big red Old
smobile and drive to the Coloma
to see where John Marshall dis
covered gold. Now he takes the
family to marinas—to see the
boats.
He's dragged Mother along to
countless boat shows, boat
stores, boat races and even boat
movies.
He's told me about the "fresh
breeze in your face," the "in
credible quiet out on the water
and more than I could ever want
to know about jetties, genoas
and jibs.
That's why a press release that
crossed my desk a couple weeks
ago caught my eye.
Stanford's Director of Sailing
was offering me an introduc
tion to big boat sailing aboard
Stanford's own Lavengro.
Great idea. I convinced Mike
Donovan, the man in charge of
the Sunday Sailing Seminars, to
let Dad come along.
Dad talked about the planned
trip for weeks. He spent hours
trying to figure out if the Laven
gro would be a ketch or a yawl
and even longer trying to tell me
the difference.
Finally, the big day arrived.
We left home in Sacramento

practically before dawn, stop
ped for gas and a greasy break
fast in Sacramento's industrial
section and hit the docks an
hour early—something I'm sure
Dad had planned just so he
could look at another marina full
of boats.
When the press, release said
"big boat sailing," I expected
something along the lines of a
cruise ship. Wrong. While at 45
feet Lavengro isn't tiny, it isn't
exactly the Love Boat either.
Mike Donovan offered the
pre-trip safety briefing.
"Even if we popped a plank I
have my doubts that she would
sink completely. . .
That's what they said about
the Titanic.
Mike explained that a trip on
the Lavengro with its fairly non
functional transmission is "not
unsafe—if you know the condi
tions."
I didn't.
He showed us where the life
jackets were, and what we
should do in case someone went
overboard. "Everyday someone
goes overboard on the Bay," he
warned. "I've done it before my
self."
Great.
Donovan introduced Laven
gro's skipper, Luke from Bel
gium, tothe 10 of uswho would
be the boat's crew for the day.
Only Luke from Belgium was
downstairs — excuse me

from Belgium, Grieve managed to avert disaster.
below—working on the non
functional transmission.
Donovan told us that we
would delay our departure so
that we could join in a cham
pagne toast on board to the ac
quisition of another boat for
Stanford's fleet. However, when
sailing director Joe Petrucci
showed up half an hour late—
sans champagne—we shoved
off.
Motoring through the oil-slick
water of the marina, surrounded
by the smell and sound of
Lavengro's aging diesel engine, I
thought back to Dad's romantic
musings about the quiet, natural
beauty of sailing. For some rea
son I thought of the helicopter
cavalryman in Apocalypse Now
who says he "loves the smell of
napalm in the morning."
But it wasn't long before I
realized Dad may have been
right about this sailing business.
As we traveled north, nearing
the U.S.S. Enterprise, the aircraft
carrier that ran aground in the
Bay earlier this year, Luke from
Belgium supervised the raising
of the mainsail and cut the sput
tering diesel engine.
Luke from Belgium told us to
man the boomvang, which, with
Luke from Belgium's accent,
sounded more like "boom
thang," something dying to be
the basis for a funk dance
number. We were supposed to
stow the lazy sheets, man the
mizzan and prepare to tack.
I moved to the front and
watched the ocean.
With just the ocean water lap
ping at her sides and the sail
flapping softly in the wind,
Lavengro offers a side of the

ocean you just can't see on the
beach or in a Red and White fleet
tour boat.
It's the man-and-nature sort of
thing, I guess. Sure, it's nature
and man-surrounded by a 45-
long, 18-ton piece of machinery.
But still. . . .
Donovan announced that the
crew—Dad and I and about eight
others—would take turns at the
helm. Dad was to be first. I was
second.
Dad took over the helm just as
the winds began to blow Laven
gro dangerously near the^flan
tic Maru, a giant black super
tanker. Supertankers seem big
from the Bay Bridge. They're just
a little bigger when you're in
their shadows.
And my father was going to
save us. Right.
Sure, Dad drives the family car
well enough. He can even drive
motorcycles and big red trucks
with some proficiency. But a 45-
foot sailboat blowing toward
disaster? I wasn't so sure.
But just as collision seemed
eminent, Luke from Belgium
took command of Lavengro's
three sails (the mainsail, the jib
and the mizzan, a tiny sail in the
back—aft—which never seemed
to do anything at all). A little bit
of fancy sail maneuvering called
"tacking" and we were headed
safely around the Atlantic Maru.
But as we neared the shadow
of the Bay Bridge, my number
came up. "Son, it's your turn to
take the helm" Dad said.
Having sailed only bathtub
boats before, I was a little con
cerned about taking the big
wooden wheel of Lavengro as
the pillars from the Bay Bridge
seemed to grow closer and
closer together.
The wind kicked up and
Lavengro rocketed forward,

running at about six knots—
seven miles per hour to you and
me. Somehow it seemed a little
faster.
Luke from Belgium said to
steer properly I would just need
to "find the groove and stick
with it. You'll feel it when she
slips out of the groove." I didn't.

Lavengro lurched back and
forth, losing all her speed more
than once. Meanwhile, Joe Pet
rucci raced dangerously by us
with his crew in Stanford Stuff
through the bridge; Donovan
and Luke from Belgium were
more than a little proud of their
overgrown baby.
My shift at the helm ended
uneventfully and we headed out
for Angell Island. Somewhere
behind the island we hit a dead
spot and Lavengro died. So we
sat in one place, slowly turning
in the wind like a just-hanged

man, waiting for the wind to pick
up.
The Coast Guard cruised by.
We were a motley crew, but de
finitely not the marijuana smug
gler type, so a guardsman
shouted something about an
overturned boat and sped by.
The sea grew quiet as we

slowly turned. I waited for the
thumping music from laws to
warn me that a great white was
circling the boat.
But eventually Luke from Bel
gium cranked up Lavengro's
"Iron Genoa"—that's boat-talk
for "motor"—and moved us out
of the dead spot.
The motor would come on
again in another hour. It was get
ting late—Mom was back at the
marina, certain that we had
drowned — and Donovan
wanted to hit the marina's bar.
So Luke from Belgium

cranked up the engine and
supervised the lowering of the
mainsail. Ten minutes later,
Luke from Belgium eased
Lavengro into berth 676 and the
other members of the crew
folded the sails while I pre
tended to write important in
formation in my soggy reporter's

notebook. Finally I did chip in to
help—l swear to God—swab the
deck. Slopping oily seawater on
Lavengro's deck so the salt
would stop leaks below—how
can you beat fun like that?
But I've talked to Dad three
times since Sunday and each
time he's told me how much fun
he had, how he's going to go
again and that he's volunteered
to scrub barnacles off the boat.
Great. Have fun, Dad. Just
don't tell me about it.

COOL HAND LUKE: Lavengro's skipper, Luke from Belgium, checks the mainsail on the 45-foot
ketch. The non-matriculated graduate student is no stranger to big-boat sailing; he helped sail a
boat similar to Lavengro across the Altantic.
