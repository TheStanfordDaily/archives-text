# Sunday Sailing Seminars

Mike Donovan and sailing director Joe Petrucci set up the
Sunday Sailing Seminars with two purposes in mind.
First, they want to give members of the Stanford community
an "introduction to big boat sailing." Second, they want to get
those same people involved with the sailing association's plan
for a permanent, on-the-water facility to house its boats.
Donovan said that his group is hoping to arrange a
"sweetheart lease" with Leslie Salt in Redwood City—a deal
which would allow the sailing association to lease land adja
cent to Stanford's crew facility there for a very low price.
The sailing association will sell donated boats in orderto pay
for the facility's construction. Donovan and Petrucci have
been "actively recruiting" big boat donations for the program
since last year.
How can anyone afford to donate a boat the size of Laven
gro? The answer, of course, is tax write-offs. With large boats
nearing the six-figure range, there are some hefty tax write-off
possibilities.
Donovan and Petrucci decided that they "may as well
utilize" the donated boats while they have them, and thus the
Sunday Sailing Seminar was born.
But there are only a few more weekends left of the free
sailing seminars. Beginning in September, the seminars will be
limited to members of the Stanford Sailing Association.
