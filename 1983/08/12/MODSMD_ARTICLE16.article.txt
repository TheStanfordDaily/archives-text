## Small pleasures and big mistakes 
### STEVE VINEBERG ‘The Star Chamber 
Peter Hyams has a talent for
making the implausible grue
somely effective. His last film,
the science fiction thriller Out
land, was excitingly staged and
paced (and it had terrific sets),
but it relied on gaudy displays of
violence to carry the puzzling,
insufficiently worked out plot
line. Sean Connerv played a var
iation on the Gary Cooper hero
in High Noon, who had to com
bat the villains — exploiters
feeding an ultimately suicide
inducing t'orm of speed to their
workers — all by himself. The
audience was left to figure out
why the workers wouldn't assist
Connery, who was acting in their
own interests.
Hyams has help in spinning
out the lengthy expository mate
rial in his new picture, The Star
Chamber (Roderick Taylor wrote
the story and collaborated on
the script), but it doesn't make
any more sense than Outland
did. A young judge, Steve Har
din (Michael Douglas, in an un
reasonably heavy, brooding per
formance), hears two horrend
ous cases in a row — one against
a confessed rapist and mur
derer, and one against two men
who allegedly tortured and kil
led a child kidnapped for use in a
pornographic film — and in each
one, a technicality obliges him
to decide in favor of the obvi
ously guilty party. (Neither
technicality presents a very con
vincing obstacle to the prosecu
tion's case, as far as one can
see.) Fed up with his inability to
provide justice, Hardin joins a
"star chamber" — a group of
judges (led by a grey-haired Hal
Holbrook, pretending to be

older than he is) who reach ver
dicts and hand down sentences,
in private, to those who have es
caped their merited punish
ments. When the assumed child
killers turn out to be innocent
and Hardin cannot have their
"sentences" (determined by the
"star chamber") revoked, he at
tempts to intercept theworkings
of the illegal organization of
which he himself is now a part.
Hyams and Taylor neglect to
link up narrative information, so
we're left with a lot of unan
swered questions. We never
learn why, for example, two in
nocent men were driving
around in a van containing the
victim's bloody sneaker. The
movie tries to dispose of the
problem by presenting these
two as low-life, up to no good —
like all the other criminals in this
movie, they appear to be some
sub-species of human being, a
kind of slime that must be rub
bed out. Given the bias of the
film, the "star chamber" doesn't
seem to be such a bad idea —
until it starts to make mistakes.
Yet the first glimpse Hyams gives
us of the "star chamber" judges
is the grisly suicide of one of
them, which begins the movie
and is then dismissed. When
Holbrook invites Douglas to fill
this now-vacant position, he
claims that he sleeps easier now
that he knows he's carrying out

'The Star Chamber' is a creepy, unpleasant
experience, in which the 'drama' is provided
by loving descriptions of atrocities; logic and
motivation don't figure into Hyams' strategy
for manipulating the audience.

real lustice, but clearly the dead
man didn't — and Hardin, sup
posedly a deeply moral,
conscience-troubled and sur
passingly intelligent man,
doesn't give the suicide a sec
ond thought. Neither do the
filmmakers, for whom it merely
supplies a lurid, boffo opening.
This is not just sloppy craftsman
ship; it is irresponsible
moviemaking.
The Star Chamber is a creepy,
unpleasant experience, in which
the "drama" is provided by lov
ing descriptions of atrocities;
logicand motivation don't figure
into Hyams' strategy for manipu
lating the audience. Since mis
carriages of justice through the
location of legal loopholes dis
turb many of us profoundly, and
raise the issue of protection of
and protection under the law,
The Star Chamber can get away
with looking and sounding like a
serious film when it is really a
cheap, mock-serious film on a
serious subject. Despite its
scary, well shot chase scenes —
no one does chases better than
Peter Hyams these days — and
the presence of the awesomely
gifted actor Vaphet Kotto in the
cast, it is, I think, a loathsome
movie.
'Get Crazy'
Atrocious as most of it is, Get
Crazy is so utterly unlike any

other movie that I was intermit
tently intrigued by it. Not sur
prisingly, The Geffen Company
has no idea how to package it, so
the ads make it look like Zapped
or Private School; actually, it's a
tribute to Bill Graham's Fillmore
East in New York, where the di
rector, Allan Arkush, and one of
the screenwriters, Danny
Opatoshu (the others are Henry
Rosenbaum and David Taylor),
worked in the late '60s and early
'70s. In the movie, the Fillmore
East has become the Saturn, the
last of the 'bOs-style rock clubs,
and its proprietor (Allen Goor
witz) is celebrating its 15th an
niversary with a gargantuan New
Year's Eve concert featuring old
and new wave blues and rock 'n'
roll acts.
Arkush doesn't havethe talent
to pull off the weird melange of
pop music parody and revue
sketch fantasy he and the writers
have cooked up, and they leave
some potentially hilarious per
formers stranded — Goorwitz,
for example, and Ed Begley, jr.,
as the bad guy who wants to tear
down the Saturn and replace it
with a mile-high recording
studio. You keep wishing that
the Brian De Palma of Phantom
of the Paradise would step in and
pare down the cramped, overkill
crowd scenes, shape the satirical
numbers, record them properly,
and show Arkush where to place
his camera.
But while you are reshooting
the damn thing in your head, the
most amazing people show up
— actors (Daniel Stern, Franklyn
Ajaye, and Mary Woronov and
Paul Bartel of Eating Raoul),
choreographers (Lori Eastside,
as a punk singer), and musicians
(Lou Reed as a reclusive rock

prophet named Auden — a
funny blend of Dylan, Leonard
Cohen and Reed himself —
Howard Kaplan of The Turtles
and The Mothers of Invention,
Fabian Forte, Bobby Sherman,
Lee Ving of Fear, jazzman Bill
Henderson). And Malcolm
McDowell has a relaxed good
time taking off on Mick jagger,
especially in a heartbreak ballad
in which he slips in sly snatches
of Rod Stewart and Bruce
Springsteen as well.
'Risky Business'
Most teen comedies are so
terrible that Risky Business, writ
ten and directed by Paul
Brickman, may seem like a jewel
in comparison, because it has its
own style and, in the nighttime
exteriors, an eerily erotic dream
landscape. (Reynaldo Villalobos
and Bruce Surtees share credit
for the photography.) Brickman
demonstrates wit in a few silent
sequences, and there's a won
derful scene in which his hero,
joel (played by a winning all-
American suburban type named
Tom Cruise), free from the con
straints imposed on him by his
parents who are now on vaca
tion, dances around the living
room in his underwear, miming
the words to a Bob Seger song.
But this film about a high school
senior who somehow winds up
managing a whorehouse in his
parents' home is indifferently
written and — except for Cruise
— flatly acted. And the way
Brickman has pointed it squarely
at the wish fulfillment fantasies
of its adolescent audiences is a
little dispiriting. After a while
you start to cringe every time
Brickman scores a bulls-eye and
the crowd roars.
