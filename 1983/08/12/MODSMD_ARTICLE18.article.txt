# You gotta hate him, but you gotta love him
## 
### LAUREN JACOBS 
Barry Manilow won over a
near sell-out audience July 26 at
the Concord Pavilion, proving
he can "write the songs to make
the whole world sing" and then
some. Manilow's two hour-plus
show alternated catchy upbeat
melodies ("Copacabana," and
"Daybreak") with the romatic
ballads for which he is best
known ("Mandy," "Even Now.")
On this second night of a three
concert engagement, Barry was
excited, energetic and profes
sional, without being slick. The
man is simply a great performer,
and the audience loved it. Even
my escort, a sometime Daily
concert reviewer (nameless lest
it be discovered he attended a
Barry Manilow concert) admit
ted to an entertaining show.
Barry Manilow is no fool. He's
watched as, over the past 10
years, pop music has ushered in
and out new personalities like a
revolving door. An album or
two, a coast-to-coast tour, and
then it's over-time to step aside
for the next act to steal the spot
light. But Manilow has survived
the changing musical scene.
Today Barry is writing and per
forming the same type of music
for which he first became popu
lar. And, as his recent concert
exhibited, Barry's musical style
still works.
Sure, his lyrics are corny
("When will our eyes meet?/
When can I touch you?/ When
will this strong yearning end?/
and, when will I hold you
again?") And there's no denying
that Manilow looks somewhat

ridiculous dancing around on
stage (the man is built like a stalk
of celery.) But it's all done with
such good, warm-hearted sin
cerity that it's impossible not to
tap your foot along. Besides, it's
my belief that most of us are
closet Barry Manilow fans.
Women adore him, as his de
voted audience showed. And
men? We've all known many
who hide their Manilow albums
behind the Stones or the Stray
Cats.
Manilow's lyrics have a uni
versal quality—typically telling a
story of love ended or unre
quited. Even though pop music
has shifted direction, Barry's
fans have stayed with him. It was
an older crowd at Tuesday's
concert—many couples in their
20s, 30s and even 40s (I half ex
pected to spot my parents as we
searched for our seats.) Flocks of
teenages were notably absent,
especially the screaming high
school girls of vintage Manilow
shows. In 1974 I was one of those
obnoxious teeny-boppers who
attended Barry's Circle Star The
ater concert. Back then, Barry
was the newest heartthrob, and
his performance played up to
the young female audience who
were his greatest fans.
On Tuesday night, we saw an
older Barry Manilow—still full of
enthusiasm, with the clear tenor
voice and love songs seeming
just as fresh as yesteryear. But
it's been almost 10 years since "I
Write the Songs" was released,
and Barry and his audience have
grown up. Atone point, duringa
50s style dance number to

"Bandstand Boogie," Manilow
joked of attending high school
in the early 70s. The audience
laughed with him (Yeah, sure
Barry!), after teasing him for
being winded once the number
ended.

Of course, it was the personal
moments like this which
brought authenticity and sincer
ity to an otherwise elaborate
show. The opening moments of
lighting and orchestration
seemed borrowed from a Tahoe
nightclub. Manilow was backed
up by a large contingent of stage
musicians, four backup singers,
and a symphony of strings piped
in from the sound studio.
Still, the acoustics of the Con
cord Pavilion were excellent,
even for the majority of the au
dience seated on the grass. On a
warm summer night, grass seat
ing at the Pavilion can't be beat.
But those of us fortunate to be
seated near the stage caught the
full energy and emotion thrown
into each song. There was a spe
cial smile as Barry introduced
"Lay Me Down" from 1975's Try
ing to Get the Feeling, with "I
pulled this one out of an old
closet," And one lucky fan was
chosen to sing "Can't Smile
Without You" with Barry on
stage, receiving an "I sang with
Barry" t-shirt for her efforts.
The years have been kind to
Barry and his music. The fans are
still there, albeit a bit more se
date. Barry is still writing and
performing for people who be
lieve in his corny love songs. No,
Barry won't be "alive forever,"
and he didn't "write the very first
song." But he knows a special
way to "put the words and the
melody together." And—those
of us who spent an evening with
Barry would agree with his lyrics.
"I am music and I write the
songs."

then it's over-time to step aside
for the next act to steal the spot
light. But Manilow has survived
the changing musical scene.
Today Barry is writing and per
forming the same type of music
for which he first became popu
lar. And, as his recent concert
exhibited, Barry's musical style
still works.
Sure, his lyrics are corny
("When will our eyes meet?/
When can I touch you?/ When
will this strong yearning end?/
and, when will I hold you
again?") And there's no denying
that Manilow looks somewhat

ridiculous dancing around on
stage (the man is built like a stalk
of celery.) But it's all done with
such good, warm-hearted sin
cerity that it's impossible not to
tap your foot along. Besides, it's
my belief that most of us are
closet Barry Manilow fans.
Women adore him, as his de
voted audience showed. And
men? We've all known many
who hide their Manilow albums
behind the Stones or the Stray
Cats.
Manilow's lyrics have a uni
versal quality—typically telling a
story of love ended or unre
quited. Even though pop music
has shifted direction, Barry's
fans have stayed with him. It was
an older crowd at Tuesday's
concert—many couples in their
20s, 30s and even 40s (I half ex
pected to spot my parents as we
searched for our seats.) Flocks of
teenages were notably absent,
especially the screaming high
school girls of vintage Manilow
shows. In 1974 I was one of those
obnoxious teeny-boppers who
attended Barry's Circle Star The
ater concert. Back then, Barry
was the newest heartthrob, and
his performance played up to
the young female audience who
were his greatest fans.
On Tuesday night, we saw an
older Barry Manilow—still full of
enthusiasm, with the clear tenor
voice and love songs seeming
just as fresh as yesteryear. But
it's been almost 10 years since "I
Write the Songs" was released,
and Barry and his audience have
grown up. Atone point, duringa
50s style dance number to

"Bandstand Boogie," Manilow
joked of attending high school
in the early 70s. The audience
laughed with him (Yeah, sure
Barry!), after teasing him for
being winded once the number
ended.

Of course, it was the personal
moments like this which
brought authenticity and sincer
ity to an otherwise elaborate
show. The opening moments of
lighting and orchestration
seemed borrowed from a Tahoe
nightclub. Manilow was backed
up by a large contingent of stage
musicians, four backup singers,
and a symphony of strings piped
in from the sound studio.
Still, the acoustics of the Con
cord Pavilion were excellent,
even for the majority of the au
dience seated on the grass. On a
warm summer night, grass seat
ing at the Pavilion can't be beat.
But those of us fortunate to be
seated near the stage caught the
full energy and emotion thrown
into each song. There was a spe
cial smile as Barry introduced
"Lay Me Down" from 1975's Try
ing to Get the Feeling, with "I
pulled this one out of an old
closet," And one lucky fan was
chosen to sing "Can't Smile
Without You" with Barry on
stage, receiving an "I sang with
Barry" t-shirt for her efforts.
The years have been kind to
Barry and his music. The fans are
still there, albeit a bit more se
date. Barry is still writing and
performing for people who be
lieve in his corny love songs. No,
Barry won't be "alive forever,"
and he didn't "write the very first
song." But he knows a special
way to "put the words and the
melody together." And—those
of us who spent an evening with
Barry would agree with his lyrics.
"I am music and I write the
songs."
