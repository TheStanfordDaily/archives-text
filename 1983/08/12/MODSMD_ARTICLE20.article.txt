Caddyshack (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bill Murray does a funny
take-off on Apocalypse Now,
and Chevy Chase has one brief
ly amusing routine about a
golfer whose prowess results
from his inner peace. The rest
of the movie is perhaps best left
undiscussed. Harold Ramis
directed and worked on the
script with Brian Doyle-Murray
(Bill Murray's brother, who is in
the cast) and Douglas Kenney
(who produced); Kenny Log
gins wrote the songs. With
Rodney Dangerfield, Michael
O'Keefe and Ted Knight.
Plays today with Animal
House and Dr. Detroit.
Autumn Sonata (1978)
Fox, Redwood City
Ingmar Bergman made this
psychological drama about the
relationship between a famous
concert pianist (Ingrid
Bergman) and her unhappy
daughter (Liv Ullmann), who
feels that her mother has always
slighted her in favor of a sparkl
ing career, but the sensibility
isn't very different from that of
1950s TV drama. It's overheated
in a conventional, Freudian
way, and its conclusions about
the responsibility parents
should take for the develop
ment of their children seem not
only infuriatingly simple
minded, but oddly demode in a
movie of the late '70s. Bergman
was in a psychodramatic, rub
their-face-in-the-dirt mood
when he made it, apparently, so
there are endless shots of Lena
Nyman, as the drooling idiot
daughter Ingrid Bergman
deserted in her hour of need,
crawling across the floor of her
darkened bedroom. Liv Ull

1
mann gives an amazing per
formance, but it reaches past
the normal boundaries of natu
ralistic acting to an unpleasant
sort of realism — a realism
without artistry. The movie ison
Ullmann's side, but Ingrid
Bergman isso ingratiating as the
charming, utterly self-centered
survivor mother that we look to
her for relief.
Plays Wednesday with Wild
Strawberries.
La Strada (1956) *
Festival, Palo Alto
Federico Fellini's most hon
ored and beloved movie. The ti
tle means "the road," and the
story deals, superficially, with
the relationship between a trav
elling strong man, Zampano
(Anthony Quinn), and an inno
cent waif he adopts and
brutalizes (Giulietta Masina).
The third character in this fable
about the interplay between
brute force and innocence,
body and soul, is an acrobat
(Richard Basehart), a fool who is
also an artist. Quinn has never
been better (except perhaps in
Requiem for a Heavyweight;)
Masina gives a heartbreaking
performance — probably in
spired by Lillian Gish in Grif
fith's Broken Blossoms; and
Basehart, a fine, underrated ac
tor, is an ideal third member of
the trio. The film represents,
along with the following year's
The Nights of Cabirla, the peak
of Fellini's powers as a film
maker, before he began to sac
rifice real sensitivity for the pat
ented, self-adoring kind that

corrupts his later films. Be fore
warned: the final image is a re
markably pure expression of
despair that you won't be able
to shake off when you leave the
theater.
Plays through Wednesday
with The Clowns.
La Nuit de Varennes
New Varsity, Palo Alto
For this picture, set on the
eve of the French Revolution,
director Ettore Scola must have
had the most extravagant
budget of his career, but the
picture displays no ex
travagance of spirit — it's re
spectably dull, an Italian
equivalent of the expensive his
tory pageant movies produced
here and in England in the '60s.
The cast is such an unholy mix
of nationalities and acting styles
— Jean-Louis Barrault,
Marcello Mastroianni, Hanna
Schygulla, Harvey Keitel, Jean-
Claude Brialy, Andrea Ferreol
— that a director with any wit or
imagination would make comic
use of the contrasts between
them, but except for
Mastroianni (who plays
Casanova) no one in it does
anything you can recall a month
later.

Plays Monday and Tuesday
with Let joy Reign Supreme.
Gandhi
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A three-and-a-quarter-hour
soporific. Richard Atten
borough doesn't have the right
qualities for epic filmmaking;
furthermore, out of either a
lack of personal resources or an
ascetic refusal to vulgarize
Gandhi's story, he resists turn
ing it into theater. And in the
process of purifying it of his
torical lumps, he has buried
much essential factual informa
tion and obfuscated the issues.
Ben Kingsley brings a fascinat
ing mixture of understated pas
sion and unpredictable wit to
the title role — he humanizes
the icon John Briley's homiletic
screenpay sets up — but the rest
of the cast (John Gielgud, Ed
ward Fox, Trevor Howard,
Martin Sheen, Candice Bergen,
lan Charleson, Michael
Hordern, John Mills, etc., etc.)
is just expensive dressing.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday.
Exposed
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Writer-director James
Toback may have come up with
the first example of a new sub
genre: belligerent farce. He
turns everything in this con
voluted pseudo-philosophical
thriller into an aggressive,
stylized joke. As Elizabeth

— terry Lewis
Carlson, an English student
breaking out of an affair with an
impossible, egotistic professor
(played by Toback himself),
Nastassia Kinski shows a lot of
anger — much of it a kind of
self-indulgent, irrational, de
fensive New Wave anger that
defines her in a way that is dif
ferent from her other movies;
Toback allows her to release
more energy than her nice-girl
roles have allowed her to work
up.
Plays Wednesday with Blow-
Up.
The King of Comedy
Fox, Redwood City
Robert De Niro plays Rupe.t
Pupkin, autograph hound and
aspiring stand-up comic, who
kidnaps a Johnny Carson-style
talk show host (Jerry Lewis) and
threatens to kill him unless
Rupert can open his show that
evening. Jerry Lewis gives a per
ceptive, lived-in performance,
but it's Rupert who is at the core
of the film, and Robert De Niro
— though he gets all the behav
ioral details of his character
dead right — is inscrutable in
the role. As his friend Masha, a
groupie who helps him in his
scheme, gangly Sandra
Bernhard shows an aggressive,
original talent, but her scenes
are pointlessly creepy. Martin
Scorsese's picture, with a script
by Paul D. Zimmerman, is ob
sessive and steamed-up, but
you can't tell what triggered so
much anger and bitterness in
the filmmakers, or even at
whom it is directed. They make
severe emotional demands on
us — to not apparent purpose,
though, and with little com
pensation offered.
Plays today and Monday with
Network.
