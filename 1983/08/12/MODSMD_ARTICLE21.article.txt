Chadian city falls to rebels
N'Djamena, Chad — Government troops defen
ding the northern city of Faya-Largeau withdrew
yesterday under heavy bombardment from Libyan
aircraft and artillery, leaving the besieged desert
outpost to the mercy of the invading Libyans and
the Chadian rebels they support.
A reliable diplomatic source here said that the
government troops of President Hissen Habre
were fleeing along roads east and west of the oasis
town about 500 miles north of N'Djamena, the cap
ital, and were being pursued by Libyan aircraft.
Their resistance in the region, the source said, was
at an end. It was not clear whether rebel and Lib
yan ground troops had actually entered the town.
There were unconfirmed reports here that 600
to 700 of the 2000 Chadian troops defending Faya-
Largeau had been "lost," presumably either killed
or captured.
However, the closest that any Chadian official
would come yesterday to an admission that a mili
tary disaster had occurred or was imminent in
northern Chad was this comment by Mahamat
Soumalia, Chad's minister of information:
"Because of the extreme intensity of the bom
bardment, the Chadian command does not rule
out the possibility of a withdrawal."
He would not confirm that the town had already
been abandoned by government troops. But he
said, "At 6:30 this morning, 30 Libyan planes re
sumed the bombing of Faya-Largeau" and added
that Libyan artillery continued a massive bombard
ment that began about 24 hours earlier.
The bombardment began at the same time that
the Libyan forces and the rebel troops, led by
former Chadian President Goukouni Oueddei,
launched a major push to capture Faya-Largeau,
which is at end of a road that is little more than a
track across the desert yet is the most important
crossroads city of northern Chad.
In Wednesday's bombardment of the city, in
telligence sources in N'Djamena said, Libyans used
Soviet-built TU-22 long-range bombers and
Sukhoi fighter-bombers, probably based at Sebha,
in southern Libya. Soviet-made tanks also were
said to have been used.
Barrage on Beirut renewed
Beirut, Lebanon — Leftist Druse gunners re
newed their barrage on Beirut's airport and
shelled a mountain army post yesterday, but the
rebellious sect freed three Cabinet ministers
seized in an attempt to force the Cabinet to resign.
Government sources said the three ministers,
seized Wednesday night, were unharmed and in
good condition after intensive negotiations to gain
their release. The sources did not explain what
prompted the abductors free the captives.
The three were Adel Hamiyeh, minister of fi
nance, a Druse; Pierre Khoury, minister of public

works, a Maronite Christian; and Adnan Mroweh,
minister of labor and public health, a Shiite
Moslem.
Before the Cabinet members were freed,
Gemayel's government announced it had rejected
the abductors' demands, including a call for resig
nation of the 10-member Cabinet.
The abductions, repeated Druse shelling attacks,
and the Druse feud with Christian militias in the
mountains overlooking Beirut have presented
President Amin Gemayel with his most serious
challenge since taking office last September.
Reagan meets with commission
Washington — President Reagan gave his special
commission on Central America its marching or
ders yesterday and expressed the hope that its
pursuit of a long-range policy for the region will
lead to closer U.S. ties with all of Latin America.
"I began this before I even took office," he said
at an impromptu news conference, "to see if we
can't make the borders meeting places instead of
lines for confrontation or separation."
Reagan said he had told the commission, "I just
hope we can bring this about and bring together
the more than 600 million people in our two conti
nents and the isthmus (of Central America), and
that their job would be to start with Central Ameri
ca."
The president met privately for half an hour with
the 12-member commission, which is headed by
Henry Kissinger. While being photographed with
the group, he said he was not worried that its re
port next February could be critical of adminis
tration policies.
"Not at all. We wanted a completely independ
ent commission to find out something for a long
range policy, and they're going to remain inde
pendent," the president said.
In linking the commission to U.S. policy
throughout Latin America, Reagan, on the eve of a
trip to Mexico, seemed to be broadening the
"North American accord" theme he first raised on
launching his campaign in 1979, when he spoke of
tightening bonds between Canada, Mexico and
the United States.
Now, Reagan said, he wants to "bring all the na
tions of the Americas closer together" and "to al
leviate some of the conditions that have made
many of those countries subject to recurring revo
lutions, because the revolutions ... for the most
part have simply changed one set of rulers for an
other set of rulers."
Sen. Charles Mathias Jr. (R-Md.), one of eight
members of Congress named to advise the com
mission, told reporters on leaving the session that
the president's views eventually could mean in
creased aid proposals for the region.
"It may be possible to develop a program which

will cost something and which will have full admin
istration support because of the way in which it's
been conceived and developed," he said.
Man bites snake
Lake City, Fla. — When a rattlesnake bit Arlie
Waldron on the forearm, he decided to get even.
He bit the snake's head off, but not before the rat
tler nipped him six more times, including once on
the tongue.
A canebreak rattlesnake bit the 42-year-old
Waldron as he started to teach his son about han
dling snakes as they stood in Waldron's backyard
in the pine woods of north Florida.
Enraged, Waldron said he set out to bite off the
reptile's head, but the fatal chomp didn't come
before Waldron had been bitten seven times.
He was rushed from his home near Lake City to a
local hospital that night, july 16, and two hours lat
er was transferred to Shands Teaching Hospital in
Gainesville. He spent four days there before re
turning home.
His head and neck "swelled up like a balloon"
Waldron recalled in a recent interview with the
Lake City Reporter.
Waldron, who said he had bitten other less-dan
gerous reptiles such as oak and grass snakes, prom
ised to give up snake-biting. That decision, he said,
was wholeheartedly supported by his wife, Bon
nie.
