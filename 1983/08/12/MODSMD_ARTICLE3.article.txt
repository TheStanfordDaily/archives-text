# Program to mix engineering, business

An alternative to the MBA for business
minded engineers will be offered by the
Stanford School of Engineering this fall.
According to Anthony Macias, associate
dean of engineering for development, the
Stanford Institute for Manufacturing and Au
tomation (SIMA) will produce graduates not
only interested in the technical end of man
ufacturing, but in commercial aspects as
well.
"The degree is really supposed to be an
alternative for someone who wants to be
co'nversant in technology and equally con
versant in the business aspects of manufac
turing systems engineering," Macias said.
"It's common to find at the chief operating
officer position people with MBA's or

people with law degrees, people who aren't
necessarily trained during their educational
programs to chat comfortably with the guy
on the manufacturing floor, or the techni
cian or the researchers at the plant," Macias
explained.
According to Macias, IBM has provided a
nucleus fund of $2 million for SIMA. "This is
an incremental fund, which will serve as a
catalyst to go forward," he said. "As IBM
funding fades out, new funding from neigh
borhood of 20 sponsors will be coming into
full strength."
Although IBM is currently SIMA's sole
sponsor, Macias said many other companies
have expressed interest in the program.
"There has been a lot of interestâ€”we have
had companies wanting to know how to join

if they are so inclined. Formal solicitations
will probably begin in September," Macias
said.
According to Macias, SIMA's pilot pro
gram for fall will consist of six students and
eventually reach 30 students in the next
three or four years.
Macias sees only positive benefits from
increased university ties to business. "The
University is blessed with a strong tradition
of positive interactions with industry such
that everyone gains," he said.
The director of one of SIMA's major re
search components, Larry Leiffer, sees busi
ness funding as an "attractive alternative" to
government grants.
"We hope that stable funding from private
industry will serve as a counter
balance to government funding.
A broadened support base will
be a complimentary benefit for
all," he said.
In addition, closer
University-business ties will be
nefit both sides of the job mar
ket, Macias said. "Companies
will have facilitated access to
students, and students will have
more companies to choose
from,"he said.
Leiffer views SIMA as a natural
outgrowth of existing campus
activity. "SIMA is bringing new
techniques to the art of man
ufacturing, and bringing that art
towards being more of a sci
ence," he said.
