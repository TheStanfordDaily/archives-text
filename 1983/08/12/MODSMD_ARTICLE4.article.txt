# Elwaymania hits Denver
## 
### TIM GRIEVE TROY EID 
Denver—When John Lennon said that the
Beatles were "bigger than jesus," people got
angry. But if John Elway said that about himself
here today, no one would mind.
In his first professional game with the Denver
Broncos last week, the Stanford graduate elec
trified a sold-out Mile High Stadium, hitting 10
of 15 passes and leading the series that gave the
Broncos a 10-7 victory over the Seattle Sea
hawks.
He's the million dollar man in thf Mile Hieh
City: the press here has bee.i hit with El
waymania.
According to Sports lllustrated's cover story
on Elway this week, The Denver Post ran 14
photos—including one on the front page—
eight stories and five charts and graphs on Fri
day night's game.
"If he keeps this up, he'll be legend by Sep
temberand eligible for sainthood by October,"
wrote SI reporter Douglas Looney.
The press here is certainly pushing for El
way's deificalion.
Last month the Rocky Mountain Mews ran a
giant front-page photo of Elway riding to his
first day of training camp, heralding it as "the
start of the Elway era."
After Friday's game, Denver sports columnist
VVoodrow Page Jr. wrote that Elway's perform

ance Sunday was part of a "fairy tale" for the
previously mediocre Broncos. According to
Page, Elway took the field in the second half of
Friday night's game "appropriately, with a
thunderclap in the background" and "thunder
ous applause in the foreground."
Another reporter wrote that Elway would
have to keep his performance "in perspective
with the Second Coming."
Still another called Elway the Divine Mr. E.
while yet another never mentioned Elway by his
rar>° jus* as th* 1 "Best Quarterback ir
Land."
Both the Post and the Slews have begun "El
way watch" columns in which they report even
the most trivial bits of information available on
their fair-haired California hero.
Elway told The Denver Post that all this public
ity is "kinda embarrassing" and that the fans'
chants of "El Way, El-Way" concern him be
cause of their adverse effect on starting Bronco
quarterback Steve Deßerg.
The team's management insists that veteran
Steve Deßerg is still the team's first string quar
terback and that Elway sits in the second posi
tion.
The fans and the press here may have some
thing to say about that.
