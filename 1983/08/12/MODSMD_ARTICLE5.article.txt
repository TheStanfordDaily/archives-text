## Soviet-American relations follow no clear past pattern 
### 
Washington—With American warships
maneuvering off the coasts of two Soviet
client states, Nicaragua and Libya, the Rea
gan administration is demonstrating that
its Soviet policy is an eclectic hybrid fit
ting no clear pattern of the past.
Two months ago Secretary of State
George Shultz described that policy to
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
saying that the administration had em
barked on a course going beyond either
"containment" or "detente." Some saw
new American militancy in his remarks;
senior officials said instead that the new
emphasis would be on "active and pro
ductive dialogue."
In fact, U.S. policy has gone in both
directions. The United States is project
ing its military power with exceptional as
sertiveness against Soviet-supported na
tions. At the same time, the administra
tion is boasting of having achieved "en
couraging progress" on several fronts in
negotiations with the Soviets, though
these gains have been largely on marginal
or technical issues.
To critics this is a crazy-quilt pattern of
strategic incoherence. But administration

policy-makers see it as an effective com
bination of firmness and flexibility. The
double-track approach, senior officials
say, enables the administration to hold
diplomatic doors open to the KremNn
and, by no means least of all, to deflect
charges that the administration is resist
ing compromise with the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union, in private even more
than in public, scoffs at American claims
of diplomatic advances as highly exag
gerated, inflated for domestic political
purposes. Nevertheless, the Soviet lead
ership, preoccupied with the badly sag
ging Soviet economy, has for its own
self-interest been responsive to U.S. di
plomatic probing, even while minimizing
the results.
What has been obscured in the process
is that the United States, not the Soviet
Union, has made the largest shift of posi
tion. The Reagan administration began by
saying it would link all subjects on the
American-Soviet front, from Afghanistan
to Poland to arms control.
When the Reagan administration
backed off that all-or-nothing approach,
the Soviet Union shifted from its conten

tion that negotiations with the administra
tion were hopeless. But what impelled
the Kremlin's switch, senior U.S. officials
say, was not any change in the U.S. line,
but the sustained buildup of American
military strength and a realization in Mos
cow that Reagan might well run for a sec
ond term and win.
"If Reagan announced tomorrow that
he wasn't going to run," one senior U.S.
diplomat said recently, "we could all
relax on preparing briefing papers on
Soviet issues."
Soviet sources concede in private that
the prospect of a second Reagan term has
affected Soviet diplomatic planning. But
they stress that none of the central issues
dividing the two superpowers is near a
solution.
That is the single point on which the
two sides agree. Before the United States
launched its current naval maneuvers,
one senior U.S. official likened the recent
gains made in American-Soviet diplo
macy to "a delicate flower." At this stage,
he said, "it wouldn't take much to knock
all of this into a cocked hat because it has
no roots, it has no depth yet."

The Reagan administration is gambling
that its displays of force in Central
America and in the Mediterranean will
not disrupt U.S.-Soviet relations.
Brief encounters in these regions have
been treated on both sides as passing in
cidents. Extended military maneuvers in
zones where American-Soviet interests
are in conflict, however, do raise the
prospect of incidents that could entangle
the two superpowers.
In operations off Libya's coast, where
American-supported forces are fighting
Libyan-supported rebels, U.S. officials
regard the risk of a clash with Soviet
interests as quite low.
In explaining its actions, the United
States has gone considerably beyond its
first rationale of simple "training man
euvers," to declare, in the words of
Shultz, that a corollary purpose is "to
underline the deterrent capability of the
United States. . . to everybody, our
friends and our adversaries alike."
