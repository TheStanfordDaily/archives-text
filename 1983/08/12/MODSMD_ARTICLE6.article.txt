Moscow—Seen from a dis
tance through the schoolyard
fence, the students, all in
their teens, seemed to be en
gaged in a strange ballet
exercise.
They would run a few
yards, then twist themselves
in a half-pirouette, arching the
right arm high as in a tennis
serve. Moments later, some
distance away, a puff of dust
would rise from the dry
ground.
Witnessed by two Western
military attaches at a school in
Dushanbe, in Soviet Central
Asia, this exercise, on closer
inspection, proved to be un
related to ballet. Like chil
dren their age all over the
Soviet Union the boys and
girls in Dushanbe were en
gaged in a unique feature of
Soviet physical education—
hurling make-believe hand
grenades.
shaped iike the "potato
mrisher' grenades of World
War I! bur made of wood or
heav\ rubber, the practice
grenades are sold in sports
shops in various weights for
difterent ages. Learning to
throw them is a formal re
quirement of the Soviet phys
ical fitness curriculum.

Along with disassembling,
assembling and firing au
tomatic weapons, grenade
throwing is taught as part of
the 140 hours of military in
struction Soviet students re
ceive in the last two years of
high school, the ninth and
tenth grades.
"Most of our military clas
ses are indoors," a young
Moscow student said re
cently "but once in a while
we get to go to Ihe firing
range, or we go out to throw
grenades. It's |ust a sport. It
doesn't have anything to do
with military things."
He said this in all sincerity.
He seemed surprised to hear
that American children, and
mo-.l others in the outside
world do not learn grenade
throwing in school.
Thtowing a grenade, even a
practice one, is no simple
mattei as i- man-, clear in a
phys> cal fitness book by one
N.G. Skachkov, published
last year in Moscow. Students
14 and 15 are introduced to
the proper technique by hurl
ing tennis balls; thenatagel6
they graduate to practice
grenades.
