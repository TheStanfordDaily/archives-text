## Eric Postel U.S. Central American policy is misguided 
### 
An open letter to all California con
gressmen
I am writing to you to express my grave
concerns about U.S. policies in Latin
America. Recent actions and statements
by the president and other members of
his administration have greatly distressed
me. As a result, I have tried to educate
myself about this issue, and am takingthe
time to contact every representative from
California in order to convey my views. I
am doing so in order to encourage you to
take every action possible to curb the ap
parently reactionary policies of the Rea
gan administration.
In coming to a sensible conclusion
about our foreign policies towards this
region, I believe it is necessary to
examine several questions:
•/s the situation in El Salvador solely
caused by the export of revolution? All
reports would seem to indicate that the
answer is no. This week's papers re
ported that a White House working paper
has concluded that the domestic prob
lems in several of these countries are the
result of Cuban-Soviet surrogates who try
to destabalize the economies, encourage
repression, and then start recruiting
eager volunteers. Common sense, how
ever, argues that people who are truly
satisfied with their freedoms and oppor
tunities do not succumb to revolutionary
entreatment. Clearly the extreme poverty
of these nations and the failure of the
ruling classes to do much about the con
ditions is the basic cause of instability in
Latin America. Virutally no one in the
world, including Americans, is going to
peacefully exist in squalor while a few

people establish wealthy empires and use
force to maintain that wealth.
•Does that mean there has been no
export of revolution? Obviously not!
Those guns have to come from some
where. As a former naval officer, my own
experiences lead me to believe the presi
dent when he says many of the arms are
coming from Cuba and Russia. But, un
like President Reagan, I do not see a
commie under every rock. I believe that
most of the people using these weapons
do not care where the weapons come
from. Accordingly, it seems quite possi
ble that our desire to respond to any
Communist involvement, irrespective of
the underlying causes, may actually be
aiding the Communists. Since the usual
Communist argument is that the United
States is imperialist and does not truly
care about the disadvantaged people in
the world, our failure to support such
people as aggressively as we support all
anti-Communist efforts would seem to
prove the Communist argument.
I imagine that the president and his
aides would respond to my previous
comments by arguing that the point is
that the United States is against any indi
viduals who attempt to implement their
policies and philosophies at gunpoint,
and that our primary interest is in sup
porting the development of democratic
processes around the world. But that is
simply not true. If it were true, we surely
would not be providing military support
to any of the South American dictator
ships.
•What is the threat? The president sees
the threat as a communist war machine

that must be challenged on every occa
sion. That view tends to see little coun
tries as nothing more than boxing arenas
for the superpowers. Surely that is not
the entire description of the threat. What
about the desires of the people living in
these arenas? I strongly believe that if the
president would pay more attention to the
fact that almost one-third of the world's
population is living in abject poverty and
starvation, he would find that there
would be far fewer requests for Soviet
and Cuban arms from people tired of the
advantaged not aiding (or often even al
lowing) the efforts of the disadvantaged
to achieve a decent life for themselves.
The White House often points out that
better than 50 percent of our aid to Latin
America is economic in nature. However,
I'll bet anything that most of the aid does
a lot more to facilitate the stability of the
regime in power than it does to insure
that all the people are fed and that human
rights are respected. If the aid is given to
rulers who do not have the people's best
economic interests at heart, then it is not
true economic aid, but rather another
form of military support for the rulers.
• What right do we have to become
involved in internal politics? NONE! I am
greatly ashamed by President Reagan's
remark that no peace is possible as long
as the Sandinista government remains in
power. He is obviously very close
minded. The President would clearly like
to destabilize the Nicaraguan govern
ment. My American history book says that
the American Revolution was fought over
the right to self-government. Granted
that this is a complex age, but once we

start sacrificing our most basic principles,
we are finished. Our foreign aid should
be restricted to economic aid and
perhaps some military aid for defense. I
strongly believe that we have absolutely
no business becoming involved in de
stabilizing a government that enjoys the
support of the majority of its con
stituents. (Note: guns were involved, but
the guerrillas could not have won against
Somoza's army without the support of
the people.) A recent Time poll shows
that most Americans agree, since fewer
than 25 percent said the United States
should support the contras.
Given this analysis, I strongly urge you
to vote against all covert involvements in
Latin America and to refuse to increase
U.S. military aid to Latin America. Fur
thermore, I suggestthatwhen you decide
on how much the United States should
spend, you should also consider the fact
that the administration is also spending
huge amounts of money to move carrier
task forces down there to threaten
Nicaragua, etc.
Please help to put an end to this gun
boat diplomacy. America's reputation
throughout the world must always be one
of democracy, respect for human rights,
respect for self-determination, and the
well-being of all humankind. I hope you will
find time during your very hectic schedule to
give this issue the attention it deserves, and
attempt to end our current misguided
policies.

people as aggressively as we support all
anti-Communist efforts would seem to
prove the Communist argument.
I imagine that the president and his
aides would respond to my previous
comments by arguing that the point is
that the United States is against any indi
viduals who attempt to implement their
policies and philosophies at gunpoint,
and that our primary interest is in sup
porting the development of democratic
processes around the world. But that is
simply not true. If it were true, we surely
would not be providing military support
to any of the South American dictator
ships.
•What is the threat? The president sees
the threat as a communist war machine

that must be challenged on every occa
sion. That view tends to see little coun
tries as nothing more than boxing arenas
for the superpowers. Surely that is not
the entire description of the threat. What
about the desires of the people living in
these arenas? I strongly believe that if the
president would pay more attention to the
fact that almost one-third of the world's
population is living in abject poverty and
starvation, he would find that there
would be far fewer requests for Soviet
and Cuban arms from people tired of the
advantaged not aiding (or often even al
lowing) the efforts of the disadvantaged
to achieve a decent life for themselves.
The White House often points out that
better than 50 percent of our aid to Latin
America is economic in nature. However,
I'll bet anything that most of the aid does
a lot more to facilitate the stability of the
regime in power than it does to insure
that all the people are fed and that human
rights are respected. If the aid is given to
rulers who do not have the people's best
economic interests at heart, then it is not
true economic aid, but rather another
form of military support for the rulers.
• What right do we have to become
involved in internal politics? NONE! I am
greatly ashamed by President Reagan's
remark that no peace is possible as long
as the Sandinista government remains in
power. He is obviously very close
minded. The President would clearly like
to destabilize the Nicaraguan govern
ment. My American history book says that
the American Revolution was fought over
the right to self-government. Granted
that this is a complex age, but once we

start sacrificing our most basic principles,
we are finished. Our foreign aid should
be restricted to economic aid and
perhaps some military aid for defense. I
strongly believe that we have absolutely
no business becoming involved in de
stabilizing a government that enjoys the
support of the majority of its con
stituents. (Note: guns were involved, but
the guerrillas could not have won against
Somoza's army without the support of
the people.) A recent Time poll shows
that most Americans agree, since fewer
than 25 percent said the United States
should support the contras.
Given this analysis, I strongly urge you
to vote against all covert involvements in
Latin America and to refuse to increase
U.S. military aid to Latin America. Fur
thermore, I suggestthatwhen you decide
on how much the United States should
spend, you should also consider the fact
that the administration is also spending
huge amounts of money to move carrier
task forces down there to threaten
Nicaragua, etc.
Please help to put an end to this gun
boat diplomacy. America's reputation
throughout the world must always be one
of democracy, respect for human rights,
respect for self-determination, and the
well-being of all humankind. I hope you will
find time during your very hectic schedule to
give this issue the attention it deserves, and
attempt to end our current misguided
policies.

An open letter to all California con
gressmen
I am writing to you to express my grave
concerns about U.S. policies in Latin
America. Recent actions and statements
by the president and other members of
his administration have greatly distressed
me. As a result, I have tried to educate
myself about this issue, and am takingthe
time to contact every representative from
California in order to convey my views. I
am doing so in order to encourage you to
take every action possible to curb the ap
parently reactionary policies of the Rea
gan administration.
In coming to a sensible conclusion
about our foreign policies towards this
region, I believe it is necessary to
examine several questions:
•/s the situation in El Salvador solely
caused by the export of revolution? All
reports would seem to indicate that the
answer is no. This week's papers re
ported that a White House working paper
has concluded that the domestic prob
lems in several of these countries are the
result of Cuban-Soviet surrogates who try
to destabalize the economies, encourage
repression, and then start recruiting
eager volunteers. Common sense, how
ever, argues that people who are truly
satisfied with their freedoms and oppor
tunities do not succumb to revolutionary
entreatment. Clearly the extreme poverty
of these nations and the failure of the
ruling classes to do much about the con
ditions is the basic cause of instability in
Latin America. Virutally no one in the
world, including Americans, is going to
peacefully exist in squalor while a few

people establish wealthy empires and use
force to maintain that wealth.
•Does that mean there has been no
export of revolution? Obviously not!
Those guns have to come from some
where. As a former naval officer, my own
experiences lead me to believe the presi
dent when he says many of the arms are
coming from Cuba and Russia. But, un
like President Reagan, I do not see a
commie under every rock. I believe that
most of the people using these weapons
do not care where the weapons come
from. Accordingly, it seems quite possi
ble that our desire to respond to any
Communist involvement, irrespective of
the underlying causes, may actually be
aiding the Communists. Since the usual
Communist argument is that the United
States is imperialist and does not truly
care about the disadvantaged people in
the world, our failure to support such
people as aggressively as we support all
anti-Communist efforts would seem to
prove the Communist argument.
I imagine that the president and his
aides would respond to my previous
comments by arguing that the point is
that the United States is against any indi
viduals who attempt to implement their
