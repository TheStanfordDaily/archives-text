## Negotiations needed in conflict 
### 
Imagine yourself with a
"friend" who you believe is
being physically threatened by
an "enemy." You want to be of
helptoyourfriend. You promise
your full support. Suppose that
the "enemy" proposes that the
situation can be resolved by
conversations among all parties
involved and a few actively con
cerned friends and neighbors,
such as yourself. What would
you do? Most people, for prag
matic as well as loving reasons,

gional war.

peaceful and mutually satisfying
resolution to the situation
through dialogue with the hope
of avoiding a costly and destruc
tive conflict.

Tragically, our government's
role in the escalating conflict be
tween Honduras ("our friend"?)
and Nicaragua ("our enemy"?)
has been one of setting the stage
for a regional war. We continue
to arm Honduras to the teeth
and practice intimidating mili
tary maneuvers on three sides of
Nicaragua. Meanwhile,
Nicaragua has made repeated
calls for negotiations. Last week
it made a plea for immediate
multilateral negotiations to be
convened under the auspices of
the Contadora group (heads of
state from Mexico, Panama, Co
lumbia, and Venezuela) with the
intent of peacefully resolving
the regional conflict.
Our president has brushed off
this plea and chosen instead to
flex his military muscles off both
coasts of Nicaragua over the
next six months as well as along
the Honduran-Nicaraguan border
within miles of Nicaraguan
troops. These are brash, uncar
ing and dangerous actions. Ig
noring a call for negotiations at
this critical juncture is to pro
mote a military conflict between
the nations of the Americas. If
we do not come to our senses
and embrace the call for negotia
tions and peaceful diplomacy,

the people of the Americas,
North, Central and South, will
all suffer the pain and suffering
that war can bring.

and good will among people,
not the kind that promotes

nations rather than the family's
destructor.
