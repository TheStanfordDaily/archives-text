# $1 million grant for Soviet study center
## 
### BRYCE LEE 
The Rockefeller Foundation
announced last week that it
would provide $1 million to aid
in the creation of a joint
Stanford/UC-Berkeley pro
gram to study Soviet foreign pol
icy.
Following a competition
among 12 major universities and
research centers, both the Stan
ford proposal and a proposal
from Columbia University were
selected for the grants.
The Stanford-Berkeley pro
gram, one of the first significant
cooperative academic ventures
between the two schools, will
involve faculty and graduate
students.
The principal goal of the new
program will be the study of
Soviet foreign policy. According
to Stanford Political Science
Prof. Alexander Dallin, the pur
pose will be three-pronged —to
promote academic interest,
public awareness, and, most
importantly, national security.
George Breslauer, a political
science professor at Berkeley
who will be working on the pro
gram, said the "purpose will be
to generate foreign policy on a
large scale using innovative pol
icy."
Dallin, an internationally rec
ognized authority on Soviet af
fairs, said he was very eager to
see the development of such a
program at Stanford.
"It's a great opportunity that is
really needed here in the United
States," he said. "Within the
past 10to 15years there has been
a slump in the study of Soviet
foreign policy and we need to
train new people to continue re
search in this field."
"Evidently, a number of
people must have talked to the
(Rockefeller) Foundation re
garding the decline in Soviet
studies, and they responded."
Dallin cited several reasons
for the decline in the number of
actual Soviet specialists and

overall interest in that field.
"Lots of Soviet experts have
retired," he said. "By the late
'60s we thought we had all the
answers about the Soviets. Be
sides, at that time there was de
tente."
Breslauer, in charge of ad
ministrative duties for the un
dertaking, said that within the
last decade there has been a
"long period of financial ne
glect" of Soviet studies.
He also emphasized Dallin's
concern that new Soviet experts
need to be trained. "By the end
of this decade, one half of our
Soviet specialists will have re
tired."
Breslauer said he believed that
the primary reason for the new
interest in Soviet affairs is "the
renewal of the Cold War and the
collapse of detente."
"If we don't catch up in (re
search concerning the Soviets)
there will be a huge gap. Our
capability to deal with Soviets
(militarily) will far exceed our ac
tual knowledge of them."
The program will be com
posed of an executive board of
five members. At Stanford, the
program will be led by Dallin and
Political Science Prof. Alexander
George (a recent recipient of a
Mac Arthur Foundation grant).
At Berkeley, the headquarters of
the joint effort, Breslauer and
Prof. Gail Lapidus will head the
program.
The program will combine
Berkeley's Center for Slavic and
East European Studies with Stan
ford's Center for Russian and
East European Studies. Further
more, Stanford's arms control
and disarmament program
(which Berkeley lacks) and Ber
keley's courses on Soviet eco
nomics and political science
(which Stanford lacks) will be in
corporated.
Proposals for research proj
ects will be presented as early as
this fall but the actual field work
will not start until next year.
