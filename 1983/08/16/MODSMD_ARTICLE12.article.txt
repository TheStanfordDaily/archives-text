# Profs, dispute Reagan policy center role
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
The number of Hoover Institu
tion heavyweights who were
named to a committee studying
the Reagan public affairs center
confirms charges that the center
will expand the role of Hoover,
professors here said yesterday.
Political Science Prof. ]ohn
Manley said that the list of com
mittee members chosen by
Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell "reads like a Who's
Who of the Hoover Institution."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz

said that the committee's roster
confirms that the proposed
Ronald Reagan Center for Pulbic
Affairs will become "just an ex
tension of the Hoover Institu
tion" if the center is located
here.
But the committee's chair,
Hoover Senior Fellow Martin
Anderson, said that it was
"academically irresponsible" of
Manley and Rebholz to make
such charges when the commit
tee hasn't worked out its tenta
tive purpose and goals.

Anderson, a former domestic
adviser to President Reagan,
called Manley and Rebholz
"quite unrepresentative of the
Stanford community" and said
they are "criticizing things that
haven't even happened yet."
The public affairs center
would be an adjunct to the Re
agan presidential library. A fac
ulty committee appointed by
University President Donald
Kennedy is currently studying
the possible merits of housing
both operations here.

Manley and Kebholz were the
leaders of a petition drive last
spring calling for the Unrversity
to reassess its relationship with
Hoover. Both professors have
expressed their opposition to
having the Reagan library and
public affairs center come to
Stanford without full discussion
of the issues.
But Anderson said the Univer
sity has taken "extraordinary
steps" to study all possible be
nefits and disadvantages of
housing the Reagan center.
