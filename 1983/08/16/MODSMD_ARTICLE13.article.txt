## A 						look at the economics of the music industry 
### ERIC POSTEL 
David Bowie and The Clash were paid in excess of $1
million each for headlining at the US Festival. Having
already sold more than 7 million copies of Thriller,
Michael Jackson and CBS Records have taken in gross
receipts of at least $32 million. One six-hour long
stadium concert may gross between $700,000 and
$1,200,000. One Journey concert alone grossed $209,275
(Austin, Texas on July 5), and the band plays perhaps
from 60 to 90 such concerts per year in the United States
alone.
Meanwhile, new bands signed to national labels may
only sell 15,000 records, average $1000 per night on their
first cross-country tour, and owe in excess of $50,000.
Obviously, some people get very rich in rock and roll,
but most do not. The economics of the music business is
frequently misunderstood by most rock and roll af
ficionados.
Most people in the music business are reticent to
discuss finances. A member of concert promoter Bill
Graham's staff responded to inquiries with a terse reply.
"Every show and deal is different," he said. "There are
no ready-made formulas. We don't divulge bands',
promoters', managers', or agents' personal financial ar
rangements."
Besides the fact that publicity about financial ar
rangements can cause negotiation problems when deal
ing with other clients or artists, the presence of highly
individualized financial arrangements does make such
comments highly appropriate. However, despite the
lack of ready-made formulas, some information can be
provided about the economics of this business.
Let's follow the career of a talented or trendy local
band as it climbs the ladder of success. When the band
first starts playing, it may be playing for up to $200 at local
parties. If it starts playing in local clubs, it may do so for
$50, or may even be required to sell a certain number of
tickets for its performance (in a sense, paying to play).

Assuming the band is good, its reputation will spread
and its ability to draw nighttime revelers into clubs will
increase. Headlining the large "showcase" clubs in a city
may bring in up to 75 percent of the ticket receipts (as
much as $2500-55000) per night. The band's only expenses
will consist of local transportation and instruments. But
remember, our band can only headline so many times a
year for fear of overexposure.
By the time the band is headlining, it may have signed
with its first booking agent. Booking agents arrange
appearances for artists under contract to them. The artists
usually sign a three-to-five year exclusive contract with a
booking agent, and give up about 10 percent of all gross
concert earnings. The booking agent will try to talk to all
the club owners around the region or the country about
hiring our heroes.
Good agents will keep the band working as much as
possible, and try to get the band into the largest, most
fashionable clubs in each town. One of four methods is
often used to pay for a full-fledged concert perform
ance: a flat fee, a simple percentage of ticket revenues
(the "gate" or "gross"), a higher percentage of the
gross or a guaranteed tee, or a guaranteed fee with an
artist/promoter split at varying percentages for all
amounts over the guarantee plus the promoter's ex
penses. The band relies on the booking agent to keep
such potentially complicated arrangements straight.
In order to publicize themselves more, the band
members may go into the recording studio and make
their own single. This can cost several thousand dollars,
which may never be recouped. However, if the single
helps the band land a record contract or attract the
attention of a big name personal manager, the effort will
have achieved its principal goal. Occasionally, a band
will make money off its independently released record,
but most do not.
Somewhere around this point in their career, most
bands begin to look for personal managers. If the band
has generated a real "buzz," the managers may come to
them. But most bands have to chase the managers. Per
sonal managers handle all business affairs, and use their
contacts to try to get the band a recording contract or
possibly a more prestigious booking agent. Personal
managers usually take 10 to 20 percent of all of the
band's gross income for their efforts
As is the case in every music business deal, the finan
cial arrangement depends on the artsit's perceived sales

and talent (talent and sales are not necessarily
synonomous). If several managers all want to represent
the same artist, the artist is obviously going to get a
better deal. A new artist-manager arrangement recently
becoming more popular involves the manager paying
the band a salary and expenses while receiving virtually
all revenues until the band pays the manager back. Con
sidering the fact that it may take years for a band to gain
widespread success, if it does so at all, managers receive
such high fees to cover all of the up-front expenditures
and risk. Turning a local band into a national success
("breaking" the band) usually involves a lot of effort.
If a record company decides to sign our band, another
set of complex financial arrangements must be agreed
upon. Bands are paid royalties and publishing fees. Both
are always some sort of percentage of sales revenues.
The musicians may also receive advances, which are
essentially loans to pay for personal and recording ex
penses until royalty payments are actually made.
Royalty payments are the rewards earned by the artist
as a result of sales of a recorded performance (as op
posed to songwriting). They vary drastically—perhaps
from 15 percent of the wholesale price of each record (as
low as $4 per album) to 23 percent of the retail list price
($6.98 to $8.98) per album. Royalty rates are always
negotiated, and once again depend on the perceived
future sales of the artist.
Different artists and managers will have different
negotiation strategies. A major artist will usually want a
percentage of the list price so that he doesn't lose
money when the record company offers sales to its cus
tomers. In general, the artists will receive between 85
cents and $2.20 per record sold.
Given such figures, Michael Jackson has probably
earned at least $15 million from royalties alone. His costs
probably consisted of several hundred thousand dollars'
worth of studio expenses, jackson's manager will take
perhaps 10 percent off the top, and the Internal Revenue
Service will take another gigantic percentage.
Still, Michael Jackson won't be starving. On the other
hand, our new band will be fortunate to sell 30,000 to
50,000 copies of their first record. That will yield perhaps
$24,000 to $36,000 in royalties. Bare-bones recording
alone costs $10,000 to $20,000 so our band has not made
any money at all. And don't forget—the manager and the
IRS still get their cut off the top. Because jazz and classi
cal recordings often cost less to record and advertise, a
profit can be made on far lower sales of such recordings.
Record companies release thousands of records per
year, but only a couple hundred achieve gold (500,000
sold) or platinum (1,000,000 sold) status. Thus, most
bands' financial arrangements resemble those of our
new band, not Michael Jackson's.
Meanwhile, the record companies' costs of produc
tion and marketing run between $1.75 and $2 per album.
Thus, their profit after all costs is probably at least one
dollar per album sold. However, if they have loaned our
band in excess of $100,000 (via advances) overthe course
of several records, the record companies are going to
drop the band from their rosters.
If our band writes their own songs, they will also
receive two additional types of income. First, a small
amount of publishing royalties (a few cents per song for
each album sold) is paid to the writer of every song on
the record. All songwriters sign contracts with song pub
lishers who are either independent or are part of the
record companies.
Anyone can own the publishing rights. Most artists
retain ownership, but some sell them. For instance,
Buddy Holly's family sold all his songs to Paul
McCartney. Every time any artist (such as Linda
Ronstadt) uses a Buddy Holly song anywhere in the
world, publishing royalties are paid to Paul McCartney.
Thus, a musician who doesn't sell many records may get
a second chance if lots of other artists use the songs.
Artists also receive income as a result of air play by
radio stations or jukeboxes ("mechanicals"). The artist
selects one of two organizations, BMI or ASCAP, to
handle the monitoring of airplay and collection/
disbursement of fees. BMI and ASCAP use different
methods for determining how much should be paid to
each artist. Suffice it to say that no artist without a hit
record can make a living off mechanicals alone.
Because concert appearances help to sell records, the
record company will want our fledgling band to set off
on a cross-country tour playing showcase clubs or open
ing for more popular artists. The traveling roadshow will
be expensive. At aminimum, the band will have to rent a
truck or bus to get around the country. They will need to
have at least one sound manager, who mixes the sound
from the soundboard at the back of the club, one or two
stage hands to set up and take down equipment, and a
road manager to handle ail of the logistics of lodging,

sound checks, interviews and finances. These people
are usually paid a salary that does not depend on the
evening's receipts.
This crew, in addition to the band, must be fed and
lodged every night. Thus, the booking agent will want to
try to keep the band playing every night of the tour, but
that is often hard in a country this size. It is also a very
tiring routine, so a few rest days must always be in
cluded. Elaborate staging or extravagant lifestyles will
drive costs through the roof.

Michael Jackson has probably earned
at least $15 million from royalties
alone. His costs probably consisted of
several hundred thousand dollars'
worth of studio expenses. Jackson's
manager will take perhaps 10 percent
off the top, and the Internal Revenue
Service will take another gigantic
percentage. Still, Michael Jackson
won't be starving.

With appearance fees running as low as $1000 per
night, the concert tour can easily be a losing proposi
tion. As a result, a record company will often underwrite
some of the costs because they know that touring gives
bands ' exposure" and leads to greater sales. But if
greater sales don't result on the next album, either our
band will end up owing the record company a lot of
money, or the record company may incur a big loss
(depending on the recording contract terms).
If our band does hit the big time, they will make lots of
money playing concerts as the previous figures show.

But gross receipts are extremely deceiving. First, the
promoter often takes 50 percent of the gross receipts.
Most cities charge large fees for the use of their
stadiums. The promoter must also pay for large security
forces, stage crews, and all publicity.
These days there is a monopoly in each city: Bill
Graham handles San Francisco, Don Law handles Bos
ton, Barry Fey handles Denver, etc. Every time the band
appears in the big cities, from a 750-seat showcase club
to a 65,000-seat stadium, one promoter will probably be
handling the arrangements. These promoters often
make more money off a moderately popular group that
sells much better than expected, than they do off ap
pearances by supergroups such as The Police. This is
because the booking agents of the supergroups struc
ture the deals to ensure that all excessive profits end up
in the band's pockets, and the supergroups are too
popular for the promoters to do anything about it.
While Journey may gross $400,000 to $500,000 from a
concert, that is not what they will take home. Journey
has a 55-member crew and four tractor trailers full of
equipment. Both cost lots of money. Once again, the
booking agent, personal manager and the IRS all get
their share before the band sees a dime. Obviously, that
still leaves quite a bit, but concert appearance fees aren't
what they first appear to be.
However, one little known source of concert revenue
often yields as much money as the proceeds from the
concert—merchandising. Merchandising is the fancy
way of saying T-shirt and button sales. High profile per
sonalities (such as Bruce Springsteen) and heavy metal
bands are the primarily beneficiaries (as opposed to the
Joni Mitchells, Miles Davises and Fleetwood Macs of the
musical world).
Heavy Metal concerts often gross as much from T-shirt
sales as they do from all ticket revenues. The band may
pay $4 per shirt to make and transport the shirt and $4 to
the promoter for the rights and labor to sell the shirts.
However, they will often charge up to $13 for the shirt to
the concert goer. That leaves a whooping $5 per shirt
profit. That can mean more than $200,000 in additional
income to our band at a large stadium concert (yes, the
manager still gets a cut).
The concert income, plus the merchandising income,
plus the record sales after the concert in area stores,
results in big incomes for the supergroups. But very few
artists ever achieve this level. The rest have much higher
costs than the general public ever realizes, and are far
from wealthy. Let's hope that the joys of musical crea
tion and the ability to entertain people makes up for the
hardships endured by our fictional band during their
odyssey.
