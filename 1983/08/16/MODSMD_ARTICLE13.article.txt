## A
						look at the economics of the music industry 
### ERIC POSTEL 
David Bowie and The Clash were paid in excess of $1
million each for headlining at the US Festival. Having
already sold more than 7 million copies of Thriller,
Michael Jackson and CBS Records have taken in gross
receipts of at least $32 million. One six-hour long
stadium concert may gross between $700,000 and
$1,200,000. One Journey concert alone grossed $209,275
(Austin, Texas on July 5), and the band plays perhaps
from 60 to 90 such concerts per year in the United States
alone.
Meanwhile, new bands signed to national labels may
only sell 15,000 records, average $1000 per night on their
first cross-country tour, and owe in excess of $50,000.
Obviously, some people get very rich in rock and roll,
but most do not. The economics of the music business is
frequently misunderstood by most rock and roll af
ficionados.
Most people in the music business are reticent to
discuss finances. A member of concert promoter Bill
Graham's staff responded to inquiries with a terse reply.
"Every show and deal is different," he said. "There are
no ready-made formulas. We don't divulge bands',
promoters', managers', or agents' personal financial ar
rangements."
Besides the fact that publicity about financial ar
rangements can cause negotiation problems when deal
ing with other clients or artists, the presence of highly
individualized financial arrangements does make such
comments highly appropriate. However, despite the
lack of ready-made formulas, some information can be
provided about the economics of this business.
Let's follow the career of a talented or trendy local
band as it climbs the ladder of success. When the band
first starts playing, it may be playing for up to $200 at local
parties. If it starts playing in local clubs, it may do so for
$50, or may even be required to sell a certain number of
tickets for its performance (in a sense, paying to play).

Assuming the band is good, its reputation will spread
and its ability to draw nighttime revelers into clubs will
increase. Headlining the large "showcase" clubs in a city
may bring in up to 75 percent of the ticket receipts (as
much as $2500-55000) per night. The band's only expenses
will consist of local transportation and instruments. But
remember, our band can only headline so many times a
year for fear of overexposure.
By the time the band is headlining, it may have signed
with its first booking agent. Booking agents arrange
appearances for artists under contract to them. The artists
usually sign a three-to-five year exclusive contract with a
booking agent, and give up about 10 percent of all gross
concert earnings. The booking agent will try to talk to all
the club owners around the region or the country about
hiring our heroes.
Good agents will keep the band working as much as
possible, and try to get the band into the largest, most
fashionable clubs in each town. One of four methods is
often used to pay for a full-fledged concert perform
ance: a flat fee, a simple percentage of ticket revenues
(the "gate" or "gross"), a higher percentage of the
gross or a guaranteed tee, or a guaranteed fee with an
artist/promoter split at varying percentages for all
amounts over the guarantee plus the promoter's ex
penses. The band relies on the booking agent to keep
such potentially complicated arrangements straight.
In order to publicize themselves more, the band
members may go into the recording studio and make
their own single. This can cost several thousand dollars,
which may never be recouped. However, if the single
helps the band land a record contract or attract the
attention of a big name personal manager, the effort will
have achieved its principal goal. Occasionally, a band
will make money off its independently released record,
but most do not.
Somewhere around this point in their career, most
bands begin to look for personal managers. If the band
has generated a real "buzz," the managers may come to
them. But most bands have to chase the managers. Per
sonal managers handle all business affairs, and use their
contacts to try to get the band a recording contract or
possibly a more prestigious booking agent. Personal
managers usually take 10 to 20 percent of all of the
band's gross income for their efforts
As is the case in every music business deal, the finan
cial arrangement depends on the artsit's perceived sales

and talent (talent and sales are not necessarily
synonomous). If several managers all want to represent
the same artist, the artist is obviously going to get a
better deal. A new artist-manager arrangement recently
becoming more popular involves the manager paying
the band a salary and expenses while receiving virtually
all revenues until the band pays the manager back. Con
sidering the fact that it may take years for a band to gain
widespread success, if it does so at all, managers receive
such high fees to cover all of the up-front expenditures
and risk. Turning a local band into a national success
("breaking" the band) usually involves a lot of effort.
If a record company decides to sign our band, another
set of complex financial arrangements must be agreed
upon. Bands are paid royalties and publishing fees. Both
are always some sort of percentage of sales revenues.
The musicians may also receive advances, which are
essentially loans to pay for personal and recording ex
penses until royalty payments are actually made.
Royalty payments are the rewards earned by the artist
as a result of sales of a recorded performance (as op
posed to songwriting). They vary drastically—perhaps
from 15 percent of the wholesale price of each record (as
low as $4 per album) to 23 percent of the retail list price
($6.98 to $8.98) per album. Royalty rates are always
negotiated, and once again depend on the perceived
future sales of the artist.
Different artists and managers will have different
negotiation strategies. A major artist will usually want a
percentage of the list price so that he doesn't lose
money when the record company offers sales to its cus
tomers. In general, the artists will receive between 85
cents and $2.20 per record sold.
Given such figures, Michael Jackson has probably
earned at least $15 million from royalties alone. His costs
probably consisted of several hundred thousand dollars'
worth of studio expenses, jackson's manager will take
perhaps 10 percent off the top, and the Internal Revenue
Service will take another gigantic percentage.
Still, Michael Jackson won't be starving. On the other
hand, our new band will be fortunate to sell 30,000 to
50,000 copies of their first record. That will yield perhaps
$24,000 to $36,000 in royalties. Bare-bones recording
alone costs $10,000 to $20,000 so our band has not made
any money at all. And don't forget—the manager and the
IRS still get their cut off the top. Because jazz and classi
