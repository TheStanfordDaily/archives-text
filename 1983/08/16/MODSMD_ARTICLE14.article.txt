# One-of-a-kind, with a delayed double-take

### STEVE VINEBERG 
Woody Allen's charming
Zelig, the story of a man whose
fear of being ostracized permits
him to change his features at will
to conform to the people around
him, is such a certifiable ano
maly that comparisons to other
movies, even other Woody Allen
movies, are difficult to make and
finally not very useful. In terms
of genre, its closest relative is
Carl Reiner's Dead Men Don't
Wear Plaid, in which Steve Mar
tin, by dint of some ingenious
matte work, shared the screen
with Humphrey Bogart, Barbara
Stanwyck and assorted other
stars of 1940s film noirs.
But Dead Men operated en
tirely on its gimmick: the scenes
Reiner directed himself were tone
less and shapeless, aside from
the kick Martin's performance
gave them, and the device was
too clever — it dried the picture
out. The tone of Zelig, a weird
hybrid of sage and lunatic, is
familiar to those of us who have
enjoyed Allen's short stories,
most of which have appeared in
The New Yorker (and are col
lected under the titles Getting
Even, Without Feathers and Side
Effects). Allen begins with a style
— Dostoevski's, or Ibsen's, or
Beckett's — that he can ape per
fectly, and then substitutes ex
travagant, far-out ideas for the
originals, so that Van Gogh ends
up as a dentist writing to Theo
about the art he creates in his
patients' mouths, and a charac
ter in a mock-Ibsen drama reveals
to her deluded husband the
well-kept secret that he is actu
ally a dwarf. The best of these
stories, likeZe//g, produce a de

layed double-take reaction: at
first you're not sure you heard it
right, then the joke grips your
imagination so tightly that you
chuckle to yourself about it for
weeks.
Like Reiner in Dead Men,
Allen and his editor, Susan
Morse, have inserted the hero,
Leonard Zelig (played by Allen
himself), into old film clips —
footage of the '20s and early '30s
gathered from a variety of
sources and featuring such

Zelig's tale is told through the
combination of these deftly doc
tored scraps; present-day,
slightly overexposed interviews
with unmannered actors in the
roles of the principals in Zelig's
life grown older; analytical
statements delivered by con
temporary social observers such
as Susan Sontag, Irving Howe,
Saul Bellow and Bruno Bet
telheim (in gentle self
parodies); and "historical"
scenes between Zelig and his

psychiatrist-turned-lover, Eud
ora Fletcher (Mia Farrow).
Gordon Willis shot the Zelig-
Eudora sequences with a set of
newsreel lenses from the
period, at a reduced camera
speed, and then he reportedly
subjected the rushes to unusual
cruelty in order to "age" them.
(They were dunked in the
shower, stomped on, etc.) The
prodigious results display not
only Allen's and Willis's and
Morse's ingenuity but an infec
tious kind of delight in discover
ing new ways of obtaining funny
effects. Zelig is collegiate in the
best sense.
Though I would be reluctant
to claim for this movie the
weight of a literary work,
Leonard Zelig, dubbed
"Leonard the Lizard" in the
media, seems to be a comic
cross between Kafka's Gregor
Samsa and the most outrageous
chameleon in American letters,
Melville's Confidence Man. (Al
len must have been conscious of
the latter connection, because
he includes a running gag about
Moby Dick.)
Cast in this bizarre role, and
restrained by the demands of
the style, Woody Allen gives his
best performance in years; in
one scene — in which Eudora
tricks him into abandoning his
psychological disguise — he is
really remarkable. And chain
smoking Mia Farrow, her hair
plaited and piled on top of her
head, her eyes hidden behind a
pair of too-large glasses like In
grid Bergman's in Spellbound, is
sweetly, touchingly reticent

here. Her best screen appear
ances (in Rosemary's Baby and
The Great Catsby) have always
had a built-in affectation that
was part of what made her so
special, yet Eudora is self
conscious in a completely
different way: she avoids the
camera as though she could
never get used to the necessary
invasion of her private life.
Zelig certainly lacks the
breadth of great comedy, but for
what it is, it's just about perfect.
The items one might quarrel
with, like the scenes from an al
leged 1935 biography of Zelig
with a too-contemporary
looking actress, Marianne
Tatum, as Eudora, don't taint
one's pleasure in watching it.
When Woody Allen returned to
the sources of some of his old
send-ups in last summer's A
Midsummer Night's Sex Com
edy, he appeared to be lost,
floundering desperately after
ridding himself of the ego and
venom of his previous films,
Manhattan and Stardust
Memories. Now he's got himself
out of that corner by making a
lovely one-of-a-kind comedy no
one else could have thought up.
