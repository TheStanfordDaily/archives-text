AT&T to negotiate with unions
Washington — Representatives of the American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. and its three striking
unions will hold their first formal negotiations to
day since the nationwide strike began nine days
ago, company and union spokesmen said yester
day.
"Both sides agreed the formal meeting might be
helpful in defining areas of possible movement,"
said Pic Wagner, a spokesman for AT&T. He said,
however, that the parties still are far apart.
"We're bringing in our top bargaining people to
explore the issues with the full group," said Fran
cine Zucker, spokeswoman for the Communica
tions Workers of America, the largest striking
union with 525,000 members. She said the session
would be to held to continue earlier informal,
small-group discussions. She added that the com
pany may present another offer.
John Shaughnessy, president of the Tele
communicaions International Union, the smallest
union invoved in the strike with 50,000 members,
said, "We aren't any closer together but it's been
agreed the place to discuss our differences is at the
bargaining table."
U.S., Soviets reach stalemate
Washington — United States and Soviet officials
said Sunday the nations are each waiting for the
other to make the next move in the stalemate over
the teen-age son of a Soviet diplomat who re
portedly wrote President Reagan seeking to re
main in the country.
Presidential counselor Edwin Meese 111, describ
ing the situation as "very difficult," said the United

States was continuing to insist on interviewing 16-
year-old Andrei Berezhkov, whose father is a top
ranking official in the Soviet Embassy in Washing
ton.
Meese said officials want to determine the "real
intentions" of the teen-ager, who reportedly sent
President Reagan a letter last week stating: "I hate
my country and its rules and I love your country. I
want to stay here."
At the embassy, an official who declined to be
identified said: "We are waiting for permission of
the State Department for the (Berezhkov) family to
leave the country."
Chairman blasts waste cleanup
Washington — A House subcommittee chair
man charged yesterday the Defense Department's
system of disposing of hazardous wastes generated
on military bases invites fraud and could threaten
public health.
Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.) said two companies
hired to dispose of defense wastes are under fed
eral indictment for improper dumping of the
wastes, while at least two others are undercriminal
investigation.
He said the Pentagon seems to care little about
what happens to the wastes once they leave a mili
tary installation, usually relying on the contractor's
word that they are properly disposed of.
But Defense Department officials testifying
before Synar's House Government Operations
subcommittee on the environment said they were
following federal law and argued that tracking all
waste to proper disposal would be costly.

Hong Kong optimism growing
Hong Kong — The start of the detailed nego
tiations between Britain and China on Hong
Kong's future has brought the first swell of op
timism here since it became clear a year ago that
this British crown colony will be returnedtoChina.
The panicked statements that filled the press six
months ago about what the Chinese takeover will
mean have given way to expressions of hope, even
confidence, that a satisfactory agreement can be
reached on Hong Kong's future as a special admin
istrative region of China.
The Hong Kong stock market, which plunged
lower and lower for nine months, has recovered
most of what it lost, and the Hong Kong dollar,
weakened by capital flight, has strengthened
slightly but not fully stabilized.
"Instead of talking about leaving, people are be
ginning to talk about staying," says David K.P. Li,
chief manager of the Bank of East Asia, who counts
himself a "stayer."
"There are bound to be a lot of changes here
when China recovers sovereignty. Some of these
changes will be cosmetic, but others will be real,
and Hong Kong will be a different place than it is
under the British today. Still, people here will have
the opportunity, I am convinced, to make quite a
good living. The return of Hong Kong does not
seem to be the doomsday scenario it once did."
Today's weather
Fair inland Wednesday through Friday. Low
clouds and fog along the coast with areas of after
noon clearing. Highs ranging from the mid 60s to
mid 70s along the coast to the 90s to near 100s in
land. Lows in the 50s.
