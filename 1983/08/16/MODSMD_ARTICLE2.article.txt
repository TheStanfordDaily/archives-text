### BRYCE LEE 
Plans to raise $500,000 to re
store Stanford University's his
toric Red Barn and stables are
"ready to go," according to L. W.
Lane Jr., director of the volun
teer effort and publisher of Sun
set Magazine.
Lane, chairman of the board at
Lane Publishing Company, said
he was excited about the "won
derful opportunity to restore a
historic part of Stanford his
tory."
The University's Board of
Trustees has already approved
the idea of restoring the Victo
rian barn that is now located on
the Stanford Golf Course. One
of the oldest buildings on cam
pus, the barn is one of the last
remaining landmarks from Le
land Stanford's Palo Alto Stock
Farm.
Although final project ap

proval is pending, Lane said that
he hopes that some of the re
construction can be completed
before the winter rainy season.
According to historic records,
the barn was probably built be
tween 1878 and 1880. The Uni
versity was opened in 1885 on
stock farm land.
"If Leland Stanford had not
started the farm, there is a good
chance that the University may
not have opened where or when
it did," Lane said.
Lane and University officials
are currently selecting a fund
raising committee, composed of
faculty, staff, students and riding
enthusiasts to help in the volun
teer effort.
Lane, an active member in
conservation efforts, owns a
horsebreeding and cattle ranch
himself. He said he was involved
in the restoration project not

only because of its historical
value but also because of the
additional cultural dimension it
would give to Stanford.
"The barn will add an enrich
ing dimension of the Stanford
experience to faculty, staff and
students alike," Lane said.
The total restoration effort is
expected to cost $950,000. It will
include rebuilding the concrete
foundation, strengthening the
walls and installing a new roof.
The exterior, which remains al
most unchanged from the time it
was built, will also be authenti
cally replicated.
"The exterior is 100 percent in
tact," Lane said, "and I think we
can get it certified with the Na
tional Trust for Historic Preser
vation."
In the 1880s, Senator Stanford
gained recognition for his exper
iments in horse breeding and
training.
