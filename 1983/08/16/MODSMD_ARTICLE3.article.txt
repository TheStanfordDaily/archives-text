# SSRL expansion studied

Increasing demand for ex
perimental time at the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Labora
tory (SSRL) has led researchers
to consider expansion of the
facilities with the addition of a
two-ring synchrotron radiation
generator.
SSRL spokesmen said the pro
posal for the expansion was un
related to the nuclear weapons
related project which was the
center of a controversy last
spring. Instead, they say, addi
tional experiments with syn
chrotron radiation using a two
ring facility could have impor
tant commercial and medical
applications.
"Support for synchrotron
radiation has blossomed," said
SSRL director Arthur
Bienenstock. "There is a belief
among many that it is one of the
most exciting ways to study mat
ter."
Earlier this month, more than
200 potential users of a double
ring generator met here to con
sider experiments that would be
made possible if the new facility
is constructed.
Use of synchrotron radiation
may allow researchers to detect
the level of metals present in

metaloproteins and metaloen
zymes in biological systems.
From there, "you can tell how
the atomic arrangements are
changing in those (systems) as
the material is undergoing
biological processes,"
Bienenstock said.
SSRL hopes to build two stor
age rings, providing a wider
spectrum of the radiation pro
duced when high energy elec
trons or positrons circulating in
a vacuum near the speed of light
pass through magnetic fields.
One of the two rings would
produce X-rays from electron
energies with five to six billion
electron volts.
The second ring would use
electron energies of only one or
two billion volts, yielding soft
X-rays and vacuum ultraviolet
radiation.
Both rings would take advan
tage of the latest technologies of
wigglers and undulators, mag
netics devices pioneered at
SSRL, that increase the intensity
of the radiation.
University administrators said
they had not made a decision on
whether the University would
make the appropriate invest
ment on the project.
