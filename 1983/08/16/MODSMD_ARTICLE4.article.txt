# University-industry links grow

The combined effects of a
sluggish economy and cut
backs in federal funding for
research have led universities
and industry to intensify their
efforts to work together on
research projects which are
beneficial to both.
The current economic
conditions have prompted
University President Donald
Kennedy to warn that "fed
eral funding of scientific re
search facilities has plum
meted and between $1 and $2
billion would be needed to
bring university research
equipment up to standard."
In fact, the state of the eco
nomy may in part be a result
of reduced investment in re
search.
A recent National Science
Foundation report stated that
the current decline in U.S.
economic output is "largely
the result of diminished
technological development
in industry, and limited in
teractions between university
basic researchers and indus
trial users of the research

probably hrave contributed to
that decline."
Increased participation by
corporations in basic re
search conducted by univer
sities is a highly profitable
method of increasing innova
tion in industry, and in return
stimulating the economy, as
well as diversifying a universi
ty's funding sources.
Since 1981, corporate fund
ing of research conducted by

universities has increased by
$75 million, according to one
study.
But universities are not yet
under industry control. Cor
porate funding of basic re
search is expected to total
$360 million this year, which
is only a small percentage of
the federal funding for re
search. Only about 4 percent
of Stanford's research budget
is financed by corporations.
Despite the mutual advan
tages of joint research proj
ects, fundamental
differences between the par
ticipants can make reaching
an agreement on a joint
university-industry project
take as long as some of the
research itself.
Industrial scientists some
times regard university re
search as "ivory tower," self
indulgent study with too little
application to the real world.
On theother hand, university
researchers sometimes be
lieve that industrial research
is inferior in quality because it
is driven by profit motives
