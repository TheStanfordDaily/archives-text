# University-industry links grow

The combined effects of a
sluggish economy and cut
backs in federal funding for
research have led universities
and industry to intensify their
efforts to work together on
research projects which are
beneficial to both.
The current economic
conditions have prompted
University President Donald
Kennedy to warn that "fed
eral funding of scientific re
search facilities has plum
meted and between $1 and $2
billion would be needed to
bring university research
equipment up to standard."
In fact, the state of the eco
nomy may in part be a result
of reduced investment in re
search.
A recent National Science
Foundation report stated that
the current decline in U.S.
economic output is "largely
the result of diminished
technological development
in industry, and limited in
teractions between university
basic researchers and indus
trial users of the research

probably hrave contributed to
that decline."
Increased participation by
corporations in basic re
search conducted by univer
sities is a highly profitable
method of increasing innova
tion in industry, and in return
stimulating the economy, as
well as diversifying a universi
ty's funding sources.
Since 1981, corporate fund
ing of research conducted by

universities has increased by
$75 million, according to one
study.
But universities are not yet
under industry control. Cor
porate funding of basic re
search is expected to total
$360 million this year, which
is only a small percentage of
the federal funding for re
search. Only about 4 percent
of Stanford's research budget
is financed by corporations.
Despite the mutual advan
tages of joint research proj
ects, fundamental
differences between the par
ticipants can make reaching
an agreement on a joint
university-industry project
take as long as some of the
research itself.
Industrial scientists some
times regard university re
search as "ivory tower," self
indulgent study with too little
application to the real world.
On theother hand, university
researchers sometimes be
lieve that industrial research
is inferior in quality because it
is driven by profit motives

rather than scientific merit.
The interest of industry in
the proprietary control of re
search findings is also in con
flict with a university's mis
sion of maintaining free ac
cess to information.
For joint research projects
to be successful, a com
promise between adminis
trative control and academic
freedom must be reached,
such as flexible patent
policies and arranged publi
cation delays.
Stanford's research collab
orations with industry at
tempt to complement rather
than compete with traditional
university commitments to
academic excellence and

public service.
The first industrial research
park in the country was
opened by Stanford in 1951. It
has become the most suc
cessful enterprise of its kind.
The Stanford Industrial
Park allows the University
and participating industry
members to interact more
often because they are closer
to each other.
The relative proximity in
creases the likelihood that
laboratory facilities will be
shared by both sides and pro
fessors can find more con
sulting opportunities. Both
sides are able to take advan
tage of each other's programs
and resources, thus broaden
ing their understanding of

the possible implications of
their own work.
The Industrial Park was in
strumental in the develop
ment of such well known
companies as Hewlett-
Packard, Watkins-Johnson
and Varian. In fact, Silicon
Valley owes a great deal of its
success and even its exis
tence to Stanford University.
Stanford is deepening its
involvement with Silicon Val
ley industries by establishing
another joint industry/
university research effort
called the Center for Inte
grated Systems.
Located directly on cam
pus, CIS is a collaboration of
the federal government, the
University and some 19 high

technology companies.
Stanford and industrial sec
tor researchers will work to
gether at each stage of the re
search process. They will de
velop research programs and
implement research projects,
and work to transfer research
findings to industry for de
velopment.
James Meindl, co-director
of CIS, identified one of the
potential problems of closer
ties between industry,
academe and government as
de-emphasis on arts and
h ijmanities.
"The quality of life still de
pends on the arts and
humanities," he said.
