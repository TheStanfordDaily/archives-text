## Shultz's power over Reagan administration waning 
### 
Washington — One year after
taking office amid bipartisan
praise and high expectations.
Secretary of State George Shultz
faces a growing perception that
his influence with President Rea
gan is waning and that he has
been superseded as the driving
force in administration foreign
policy.
Fueled by speculation about
where Shultz and national secu
rity affairs adviser William Clark
stand in the pecking order, this
perception has been most evi
dent in the debate over Central
America.

Despite initial high hopes accompanying his
appointment, Shultz has been unable to
achieve any major, attention-grabbing
accomplishments. He has had some successes
. . . but they do not convert easily into
bankable political capital for the president.

Many executive branch and
congressional leaders agree that
Shultz, expected to act as a
moderating force on administra
tion actions, is clearly caught in
the wake of the get-tough ap
proach advocated by Clark and
other hard-line presidential ad
visers.
The Central America con
troversy has raised questions
about whether policy control in
such other top-priority areas as
the Middle East and East-West
relations is shifting from the
State Department to the White
House.
Clark's emergence as over
seer of interagency arms-control
planning and the recent ap-

pointment of Robert McFarlane,
Clark's deputy at the National
Security Council, as Reagan's
special Middle East envoy have
been publicly interpreted as
signs that the White House has
been keenly disappointed by the
failure of Shultz's much-touted
Mideast initiatives and his appa
rent inactivity in arms control.
In fact, speculation about
Shultz's status, including one
hotly denied report that he was
thinking about resigning, has
prompted the White House to
push him into the center of pub
lic attention. But these efforts

have been so heavy-handed and
obvious that they have had the
opposite effect, fueling the
speculation about Shultz's
status.
In a series of interviews re
cently, senior officials at the
White House and State Depart
ment insistedthatwhileacertain
amount of tension is inevitable,
the interplay between Shultz
and Clark is, as one put it, "not
malicious."
The jockeying within the
policy-making machinery, they
contended, does not represent a
grab for power like those made
in previous administrations by
such national security affairs ad
visers as Henry Kissinger against

William Rogers or Zbigniew
Brzezinski against Cyrus Vance.
Nor is it a replay of bickering
over turf and prerogatives that
characterized Alexander Haig
Jr.'s tenure at the State Depart
ment during the first part of the
Reagan administration.
Still, the officials acknowl
edged that some "realign
ments" have occurred because
of a feeling in the White House
that Shultz's tendency to focus
on long-range goals and chip
away at them methodically does
not meet many of the presi
dent's most pressing political
and ideological needs.
In actuality, the officials con
tended, this shift has been con
fined largely to Central America,
thrust by the combination of
events and Reagan's ideological
convictions atop the foreign
policy agenda. But, the officials
said, it was inevitable that as
Clark's presence became so ob
vious in the area dominating
public attention, there would be
a rush of speculation that
Shultz's influence was waning
throughout the broader policy
spectrum.
That, the officials contended,
is not the case. But those within
the White House said that, in
some areas, they regard Shultz's
approach as too passive and de
liberative as Reagan prepares for
what is expected to be a re
election bid and has a growing
need for at least some results in
the foreign-policy field.
Despite initial high hopes ac
companying his appointment,
Shultz has been unable to
achieve any major, attention
grabbing accomplishments. He

has had some successes, most
notably in patching the bitter rift
with European allies over the
Soviet natural-gas pipeline and
in teaming with Treasury Secre
tary Donald Regan to blunt in
ternational debt problems
threatening world economic or-

But these do not convert easily
into bankable political capital for
the president. As one official
noted: "On the pipeline issue,
you can't brag about the fact that
after Reagan shot himself in the
foot, Shultz bandaged it up for
him. And while the debt prob
lem is of major importance, it's
something that only a conven
tion of economists would find
sexy and exciting."
On the issues that tend to
dominate the front pages, Shultz
has encountered seemingly un
ending frustrations. In the Mid
dle East, his bold plan for resolv
ing the Arab-Israeli conflict and
his shuttle-diplomacy bid to get
foreign forces out of Lebanon
have run off the rails. In East-
West relations, there are hopes
for results on arms control and
other relaxations of tensions,
but relations between the
superpowers are largely frozen
in mutual suspicion and re
crimination.

Shultz's response in each case
has been to say, in effect, "Let's
pick up the pieces and go at the
problem again." But it is an ap
proach that has caused impa
tience in an administration feeling
increasingly impelled to shift to
more direct, short-term strate
gies that promise earlier results,
even at the risk of controversy
and crisis.
That, the officials asserted, is
what accounts for Clark's in
creasing activism. As one of the
president's most trusted inti
mates who sees his role as ensur
ing that Reagan's wishes are
translated into action, he has
stepped into what the White
House inner circle perceives as a
void that Shultz is temperamen
tally and philosophically unwil
ling to fill.
But, the officials added,
Clark's emergence from the
anonymity in which he cus
tomarily prefers to operate is by
no means an across-the-board
phenomenon. But regarding
Central America, even top
Shultz aides do not dispute that
in recent months power has
shifted steadily from the State
Department to Clark's White
House office and that Shultz is
unhappy about that and the
execution of policy.
The problem goes back to
Shultz's first days in office when
he was forced to concentrate
almost exclusively on the Middle
East and the pipeline dispute.
Central America was relatively
quiet, and Shultz left policy
management to Thomas Enders,
then assistant secretary for
inter-American affairs.
However, because of person
ality conflicts and suspicions
that he was deviating too much
from Reagan's view of the re
gional conflict, Enders lost the
confidence of Clark who in May
initiated his ouster and started
taking a direct hand in day-to
day Central America policy.

you can't brag about the fact that
after Reagan shot himself in the
foot, Shultz bandaged it up for
him. And while the debt prob
lem is of major importance, it's
something that only a conven
tion of economists would find
sexy and exciting."
On the issues that tend to
dominate the front pages, Shultz
has encountered seemingly un
ending frustrations. In the Mid
dle East, his bold plan for resolv
ing the Arab-Israeli conflict and
his shuttle-diplomacy bid to get
foreign forces out of Lebanon
have run off the rails. In East-
West relations, there are hopes
for results on arms control and
other relaxations of tensions,
but relations between the
superpowers are largely frozen
in mutual suspicion and re
crimination.

Shultz's response in each case
has been to say, in effect, "Let's
pick up the pieces and go at the
problem again." But it is an ap
proach that has caused impa
tience in an administration feeling
increasingly impelled to shift to
more direct, short-term strate
gies that promise earlier results,
even at the risk of controversy
and crisis.
That, the officials asserted, is
what accounts for Clark's in
creasing activism. As one of the
president's most trusted inti
mates who sees his role as ensur
ing that Reagan's wishes are
translated into action, he has
stepped into what the White
House inner circle perceives as a
void that Shultz is temperamen
tally and philosophically unwil
ling to fill.
But, the officials added,
Clark's emergence from the
anonymity in which he cus
tomarily prefers to operate is by
no means an across-the-board
phenomenon. But regarding
Central America, even top
Shultz aides do not dispute that
in recent months power has
shifted steadily from the State
Department to Clark's White
House office and that Shultz is
unhappy about that and the
execution of policy.
The problem goes back to
Shultz's first days in office when
he was forced to concentrate
almost exclusively on the Middle
East and the pipeline dispute.
Central America was relatively
quiet, and Shultz left policy
management to Thomas Enders,
then assistant secretary for
inter-American affairs.
However, because of person
ality conflicts and suspicions
that he was deviating too much
from Reagan's view of the re
gional conflict, Enders lost the
confidence of Clark who in May
initiated his ouster and started
taking a direct hand in day-to
day Central America policy.

George Shultz
Washington — One year after
taking office amid bipartisan
praise and high expectations.
Secretary of State George Shultz
faces a growing perception that
his influence with President Rea
gan is waning and that he has
been superseded as the driving
force in administration foreign
policy.
Fueled by speculation about
where Shultz and national secu
rity affairs adviser William Clark
stand in the pecking order, this
perception has been most evi
dent in the debate over Central
America.

Despite initial high hopes accompanying his
appointment, Shultz has been unable to
achieve any major, attention-grabbing
accomplishments. He has had some successes
. . . but they do not convert easily into
bankable political capital for the president.

Many executive branch and
congressional leaders agree that
Shultz, expected to act as a
moderating force on administra
tion actions, is clearly caught in
the wake of the get-tough ap
proach advocated by Clark and
other hard-line presidential ad
visers.
The Central America con
troversy has raised questions
about whether policy control in
such other top-priority areas as
the Middle East and East-West
relations is shifting from the
State Department to the White
House.
Clark's emergence as over
seer of interagency arms-control
planning and the recent ap-

pointment of Robert McFarlane,
Clark's deputy at the National
Security Council, as Reagan's
special Middle East envoy have
been publicly interpreted as
signs that the White House has
been keenly disappointed by the
failure of Shultz's much-touted
Mideast initiatives and his appa
rent inactivity in arms control.
In fact, speculation about
Shultz's status, including one
hotly denied report that he was
thinking about resigning, has
prompted the White House to
push him into the center of pub
lic attention. But these efforts

have been so heavy-handed and
obvious that they have had the
opposite effect, fueling the
speculation about Shultz's
status.
In a series of interviews re
cently, senior officials at the
White House and State Depart
ment insistedthatwhileacertain
amount of tension is inevitable,
the interplay between Shultz
and Clark is, as one put it, "not
malicious."
The jockeying within the
policy-making machinery, they
contended, does not represent a
grab for power like those made
in previous administrations by
such national security affairs ad
visers as Henry Kissinger against

William Rogers or Zbigniew
Brzezinski against Cyrus Vance.
Nor is it a replay of bickering
over turf and prerogatives that
characterized Alexander Haig
Jr.'s tenure at the State Depart
ment during the first part of the
Reagan administration.
Still, the officials acknowl
edged that some "realign
ments" have occurred because
of a feeling in the White House
that Shultz's tendency to focus
on long-range goals and chip
away at them methodically does
not meet many of the presi
dent's most pressing political
and ideological needs.
In actuality, the officials con
tended, this shift has been con
fined largely to Central America,
thrust by the combination of
events and Reagan's ideological
convictions atop the foreign
policy agenda. But, the officials
said, it was inevitable that as
Clark's presence became so ob
vious in the area dominating
public attention, there would be
a rush of speculation that
Shultz's influence was waning
throughout the broader policy
spectrum.
That, the officials contended,
is not the case. But those within
the White House said that, in
some areas, they regard Shultz's
approach as too passive and de
liberative as Reagan prepares for
what is expected to be a re
election bid and has a growing
need for at least some results in
the foreign-policy field.
Despite initial high hopes ac
companying his appointment,
Shultz has been unable to
achieve any major, attention
grabbing accomplishments. He

has had some successes, most
notably in patching the bitter rift
with European allies over the
Soviet natural-gas pipeline and
in teaming with Treasury Secre
tary Donald Regan to blunt in
ternational debt problems
threatening world economic or-

But these do not convert easily
