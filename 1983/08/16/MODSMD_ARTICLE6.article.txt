# Pope greets 150,000 at Lourdes, France

Lourdes, France—John Paul II
told 150,000 pilgrims today that
he had come to this shrine of the
Virgin Mary to celebrate not only
her assumption into heaven but
also the second millennium of
her birth.
John Paul, the first pontiff to
journey to one of the most popu
lar shrines to the mother of
Jesus, spoke at a morning Mass
after a full day of activities Sun
day, including a speech de
nouncing states that impose a
"civil death" on their people by
denying them fundamental
rights.
In his homily, the pope said
the 2000 th anniversary of the
birth of Christ is only 17 years
away. "Would it therefore not
be opportune to celebrate first
the second millennium of the
birth of Mary?" he said.
The pontiff spoke in French
before pilgrims gathered in
cool, misty weather in a meadow
in the Our Lady of Lourdes
sanctuary. Police estimated the
crowd at 150,000.
Roman Catholic dogma
teaches that Mary was born by
immaculate conception, or
without sin, and was bodily as
sumed into heaven. Aug. 15 is
the feast day celebrating the
assumption —one of the biggest
holidays in Europe, with virtually
all shops and offices closed for
the day.
Lourdes is particularly linked
to the dogma of immaculate
conception because a 14-year
old local girl named Bernadette
Soubirous said the Virgin Mary
appeared to her here in 1858 and
said, "I am the Immaculate Con
ception."
That was only four years after
Pope Pius IX first promulgated
the dogma of the Immaculate
Conception. The town has since

become one of the most popular
honoring the Virgin Mary, draw
ing thousands of ill and dying
people searching for miraculous
cures from the shrine's springs.
Earlier today, the white-robed
pontiff held meetings with
priests and nuns at the Rosary
Basilica and then proceeded by
motorcade in his white
popemobile to the crowded
meadow.
The pope had planned to visit
Lourdes two years ago, but the
trip was canceled after he was
seriously wounded in an assas
sination attempt in St. Peter's
Square on May 13, 1981.
In his address Sunday to
thousands of pilgrims filling the
square in front of the Basilica of
the Rosary, the white-robed
pontiff called for prayers for "all
those who suffer intolerable
blows to their human dignity, to
their fundamental rights—all
those who are prevented from
freely using their liberty of
thought and action, humiliated
in their legitimate national aspi
rations."
The polish-born pontiff did
not cite specifics, saying "must
we be more precise?"
There was no official crowd
estimate for Sunday, but repor
ters on the scene said there ap
peared to be far fewer than the
expected 200,000 people.
Among the crowd were
thousands of sick and disabled
people in special carts.
There also was a large contin
gent of pilgrims from the pope's
troubled homeland—including
members of the outlawed Sol
idarity trade union. As he rode in
the parade, the pope waved and
pointed at a huge Solidarity
banner.
