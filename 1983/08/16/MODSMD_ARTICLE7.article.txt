## Michael Shuman SSRL: academic freedom not enough 
### 
An open letter to University President
Donald Kennedy
In your open reply to Loren Rusk, pub
lished in the July 22 issue of the Daily, you
endorsed the proposed nuclear weapons
research project at the Stanford Syn
chrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) be
cause "we should not suspend a central
principle of academic freedom." I am
writing, in part, to criticize your argu
ments, but, in larger part, to encourage
you to become a thoughtful leader for
world peace rather than an unwitting
apologist for inhumane weapons re
search.
Let me begin by explaining two points
of agreement. First, I deeply share your
feeling that academic freedom is "the
most important freedom the scholar
has." Second, I, like you, remain uncon
vinced that the SSRL project will substan
tially "add to the danger of annihilation."
What concerns me more is that you carry
the principle of academic freedom so far
that you deny the existence of important
countervailing principles that should
limit certain kinds of inhumane research.
It may be that the connections between
the SSRL project and nuclear war are suf
ficiently attentuated so that these coun
tervailing principles do not apply in this
case. But because other inhumane proj
ects, more directly linked to nuclear
weapons, are bound to arise sooner or
later, the University has a responsibility
to develop a conscientious, comprehen
sive procedure for evaluating the con
nections between its research and such
weapons. Thus, I urge you to settle the
SSRL controversy (and future such con
troversies) by helping to establish a new
Univeristy Panel To Safeguard Against In
humane Weapons Research.

What concerns me more is that you carry the principle of
academic freedom so far that you deny the existence of
important countervailing principles that should limit
certain kinds of inhumane research.

Your argument for inaction begins by
analogizing academic freedom to free
speech, implying that the University
should accord researchers as much
"freedom of speech." The analogy is
sound, providing you recognize that
neither freedom is absolute. Despite the
Constitution's strong proscription against
limits on the freedom of speech, the Su
preme Court has nevertheless fashioned
a number of exceptions, two of which are
especially relevant here—speech that sol
icits crime and speech that poses a "clear

and present danger" to national security.
As the chair of the faculty committee that
excoriated and ousted former English
Prof. Bruce Franklin back in 1971, you
more than most should be well aware that
Stanford does not always tolerate a pro
fessor's "free speech" when it judges him
to have incited violent, criminal acts.
Moreover, as Stanford Law School Prof.
Bill Cohen muses, if a professor seeks to
discover and publish how a five year old
can build cheap hydrogen bombs from
sea water, society and the University alike
would probably be legally justified in en
joining that research—"free speech"
notwithstanding.
Not only has absolute freedom of
academic speech never existed, but it has
always been more narrowly cir
cumscribed than public free speech.
Hence, the University punished Franklin
for speech for which the government
could have never jailed or fined him.
More recently, the University purged
Stephen Mosher from the anthropology
department for speech that, while appar
ently legal, was deemed heinous for a
Stanford researcher. Giving answers to a
friend on a take-home final exam is also
legally permissible, but it violates the
University honor code. In all of these
cases, Stanford has erected narrow
boundaries within which students and
faculty alike must operate.
What the SSRL case poses,however, is
not just pure speech and research, but
applied research. In the same way that
the Supreme Court has more easily seen
fit to restrict speech coupled with con
duct, so too should the University more
readily regulate research with overt ap
plications. Still, you claim that you "do
not believe that. . . .the specificity of the

products. . . .provides a valid basis for
casting aside the principle that faculty
members should be free to inquire ac
cording to the dictates of their own pro
fessional interests and conscience." But
no one is complaining about the SSRL
"products" because they are too spe
cific; instead, the fear is that the "prod
ucts" have end-uses that are specifically
evil—namely the mass murder of human
beings.
To many, nuclear weapons research
should be curtailed not just because it

solicits crime, but because it /s crime—an
international crime. I find it hard to be
lieve that the university would idly stand
by and allow a professor to develop
"new, more efficient gas chambers" for
acts of genocide. Even though
government-sponsored nuclear weapons
research is obviously not a federal crime,
we should recognize that every nuclear
weapon is a preparatory crime against
humanity, for nuclear weapons violate

But your logic is flawed because your only 'good set of
principles' is 'academic freedom/ As I have shown,
those principles have never stood in a vacuum, and to
most reasonable people, an equally sound principle is
the prevention of genocide. We may disagree over
whether the SSRL project poses such a threat, but the
issue at least deserves an open debate in a forum where a
positive finding would lead to the stopping of such
research.

fundamental international laws against
indiscriminate killing of noncombatants
during wartime. The university should
adopt a simple principle: we will not tol
erate weapons research useable only for
mass murder regardless of "professional
interests and conscience." Again, such a
criterion might not apply in the SSRL
case, but the principle is nevertheless
valid.
Even if you are unconvinced that nu
clear weapons research is an interna
tional crime, you should still oppose it on
the grounds that it is ethically irresponsi
ble. While you wonder "what possible
principle" could govern such regula
tions, you need only look as far as the
University Panel on Human Subjects in
Medical Research, which has ably devel
oped numerous principles for preventing
degrading and deceptive research with
out endangering the "academic free
dom" of the Medical School. In the same
way that that panel has prevented phar
maceutical companies from using the
University for its dirty deeds, a new Panel
To Safeguard Against Inhumane
Weapons Research can prevent military
establishments from using the University
for forging more efficient ways of killing
people.
Vou deny that the enormous destruc
tiveness of nuclear weapons means that
"the entire matter passes to a different
ethical zone. . . .because that kind of ar
gument is regularly advanced whenever a
good set of principles produces a result
with which many disagree. . But your

logic is flawed because your only "good
set of principles" is "academic freedom."
As I have shown, those principles have
never stood in a vaccuum, and to most
reasonable people, an equally sound
principle is the prevention of genocide.
We may disagree over whether the SSRL
project poses such a threat, but the issue
at least deserves an open debate in a
forum where a positive finding would
lead to the stopping of such research.

I am not well-versed in the intracicies of
who holds the power to regulate
academic research, I only know that you
are a respected opinion leader, both at
Stanford and throughout the academic
world. A declaration by you—that all
weapons of mass destruction are im
moral, that all research exclusively di
rected at producing such weapons is un
ethical, that the University will set up a
special panel to stop such research, and
that other universities should follow
suit—would have a profound impact
around the globe. In your hands, Dr.
Kennedy, is the power to preserve not
only academic freedom, but also to stand
up for international survival.
The growing outcry against nuclear
weapons—by millions of Americans and
Europeans, by the Catholic Church, and
even by your predecessor, Richard
Lyman—suggests that consideration of
the "danger of annihilation" need not re
quire a "different ethical zone," but
rather a sober recognition of the compet
ing values that have always lurked in the
old zone. As Albert Einstein and Bertrand
Russell pleaded in their 1955 Pugwash
Declaration urging reversal of the nuclear
arms race: "We appeal, as human beings,
to human beings: remember your hu
manity and forget the rest. If you can do
so, the way lies open to a new paradise; if
you cannot, there lies before you the risk
of universal death."
