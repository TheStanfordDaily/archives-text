## Hoover criticism unfair 
### 
Everyone, including Profes
sors Manley and Rebholz, has a
right to his or her prejudices and
hates. Racists hate minorities,
war mongers hate peacemakers
and Manley and Rebholz hate
the Hoover Institution. When
prejudices and hates are in
dulged, however, at the inno
cent expense of others, they
should not be tolerated.
The proposed Reagan library
and public affairs center will be
most attractive assets for Stan
ford. Even Rebholz recognizes
that "historians will inevitably
want thai archive." And they will
not be the only ones whose re
search interests will be served by
access to the papers of the cur
rent U.S. president.
Disturbingly, Manley and Reb
holz do not not see the issue of
Reagan library in terms of the
scholarly value of the Reagan
papers. According to the Daily
(August 9), Manley said that the
issue is not the academic value
of the papers, but the expansion
of Hoover's role at a time when
the University is supposedly
reassessing its relationship with

the conservative think tank. This
admission by Manley that he
seeks to block the legitimate re
search interests of a significant
part of the Stanford community
to indulge his personal pre
judices against Hoover and Re
agan should be duly noted. It re
veals not only moral irresponsi
bility, but a contempt for scien
tific research that has been
strongly hinted at by his own
paucity of publications during
his Stanford years.
The fact that both Manley's
and Rebholz's bibliographies
are open and virtually empty
books may be harsh but is
nonetheless relevant, because it
can reflect a skeptical attitutde
toward the value of academic re
search.
For his part, Rebholz ques
tions the appropriateness of
housing Ronald Reagan's library
and public affairs center here on
the grounds that the president
was never a student at Stanford,
but Lyndon johnson never was a
student at the University of
Texas where the LBJ library is
housed. |immy Carter never was

a student at Emory University
where the Carter library and
public policy center is located;
and John Kennedy never was a
student at the University of Mas
sachusetts where the Kennedy
library is housed. Texas simply
was Lyndon Johnson's home
state; Georgia, Jimmy Carter's;
Massachusetts, John Kennedy's;
and California, Ronald Reagan's.
Moreover, if as a general rule
this or any other university were
to limit its acceptance of major
acquisitions to former students,
there would be few acquisitions
indeed.
By all means, let there be a full
and open discussion on the
merits of the Reagan library and
public affairs center, but let the
question be resolved on the
grounds of accommodating the
legitimate scholarly interests of
this University—not the pre
judiced sensibilities of a small
and vociferous anti-Hoover
clique.
