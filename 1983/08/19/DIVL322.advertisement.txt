the aim?*
Like the sign says in some dental offices —
"You don't have to brush and floss all of your teeth,
just the ones you want to keep."
Complete aim like this is significantly better than
just brushing with Crest, Colgate, Aquafresh,
• Close-Up and Aim toothpastes and gels.
Yes! It's a loss not to floss, gloss and toss
with the new Floss N Gloss™ tool.
This tool has a one-inch-long-floss-loop which has
something extra: It's an extra thick, FlossgardecT*
second strand which is almost like a rubber baby
bumper or safety in a safety razor.
In fact, aimed to remove particles of food etc., the
revolutionary Floss N Gloss tool is the world's first
safety toothpick\
The Floss N Gloss tool is not owned by, promoted
by or associated with the makers of Crest, Colgate,
Aquafresh, Close-Up and Aim toothpastes and gels.
