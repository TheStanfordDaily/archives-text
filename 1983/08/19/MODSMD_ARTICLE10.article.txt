The Daily of Aug. 16 contains
an opinion by Melvyn Krauss in
which Professors Rebholz and
Manley are taken to task for their
anti-Hoover activities. I ordinar
ily have no interest in the thrust
and parry of academic debate.
Krauss' thrusts at my colleagues
(Manley and Rebholz) won't be
reiterated here. If you want to
know what he said about them
you will have to find a yellowing
copy of the paper blowing in the
wind in the Quad, or call Krauss.
I am concerned about his obfus
cation of the issuer o( tKc re
lationship between the Hoover
Institution and Stanford Univer
sity; 2) the placement of a Re
agan Presidential Library to
house the Reagan presidential
papers at Stanford and 3) the
creation of a Reagan Center for
Public Affairs.
In my view these are three
separable questions. The
Academic Senate has briefly de
bated and chosen to refer for

further discussion the first
issue—the relationship between
the Hoover Institution and the
University. The other two issues
have not been discussed by the
faculty in any formal way. I
would expect that before ad
ministrative decisions are taken
which can have serious effects
on academic pursuits, the fac
ulty, through its senate, will get
to discuss the issues and express
its views.
Krauss' comments are not the
first time that Rebholz, Manley,
or collectively the faculty who
signed the petition bringing the
issue of the Hoover Institution
before the Faculty Senate, have
been attacked with ad hominem
arguments advanced by Hoover
fellows. Maybe they don't have
any substantive arguments to
make, and maybe they think that
the real issues will be lost sight
of. I hope that will not happen.
