## Aerobics story contained inaccuracies 
### 
With dismay, we recently read
an article concerning aerobics
programs in this area (Daily, Aug.
12). We take strong pffense to
several inaccuracies.
Our program, among others,
was criticized by your reporter
who has never attended any of
our classes. She misrepresented
our program with false state
ments on cost, the length of
aerobics and stretching seg
ments, and, most maliciously,

the safety of the exercises.
How can one possibly critique
a class without ever having been
there? We have been conscien
tious in successfully ensuring
injury-free exercise and have
consistently coached all partici
pants on correct technique.
While we always solicit and
appreciate legitimate sugges
tions, we find this irresponsible
reporting unacceptable. We
condemn your reporter's blatant

desire to bolster her favorite
aerobics program with cheap
shots at others.
