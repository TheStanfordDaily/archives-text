## Bulk of Nicaraguan economy controlled by leftists 
### 
Managua, Nicaragua—The lef
tist government here has taken
over more than half of the coun
try's economy, despite official
claims that the private sector
controls the bulk of business
and production, according to
new research.
The results of the research by
the National Institute of Social
Studies, a private foundation
with links to the Sandinista re
gime, were obtained privately.
Diplomatic economists from
Latin America and Europe agree
with the conclusions.
According to the study, which
has not been made public, the
government now owns or con
trols at least 60 percent of
Nicaragua's industrial and
commerical capacity.
That contrasts with repeated
public statements by the San
dinistas that Nicaragua has a
pluralistic economy, with the
private sector holding 60 per
cent of it.
In fact, one Western diplomat
said, "not more than a year ago,
the 60 percent (private sector)
figure may have been correct;
but, if you look at the trends,
more and more individual prop
erty is going to the government
in some form or another."
According to the institute's
study, in every major sector,
from manufacturing to heavy ag
riculture, the Sandinistas now
have well over 50 percent in their
control. Only in industrial pro
duction does the private sector
hold more than 45 percent.
Another specialist, with an
admittedly anti-Sandinista out
look, predicted that, "overtime,
70 percent or more of the eco
nomy will belong to the gov
ernment. In our view, the pri
vate sector is a dying animal."
Sandinista economists denied
that the institute's study showed
a drop in private business parti
cipation, arguing that direct
government holdings still total
only about 40 percent of the
economy.
They base their interpretation
on assertions that cooperatives,
which are particularly important
in agriculture, should be in
cluded in the private sector. Yet
the cooperatives are organized

by the government, their credit
is arranged by the government,
their production quotas are set
by the government and much of
the marketing of their output,
particularly for export, is han
dled by the government.
"I have to admit that to in
clude the cooperatives in the
private sector is misleading," a
diplomat whose country is sym

7n areas where the government has taken over, effi
ciency has dropped as much as two-thirds. If they don't
restore some private control, this will be an impossible
country/
- a Western European diplomat

pathetic to the Sandinistas said.
The issue of how much of the
economy is government
controlled or remains in private
hands is important and sensitive
on several levels.
As part of their effort to con
vince international opinion that
Nicaragua is not a clone of Cuba
or a dependency of the Soviet
Union and its Communist Bloc
allies, the Sandinistas argue that
Nicaragua is a pluralistic society
with a mixed economy.
"We are not communists and
we don't have a socialist eco
nomy," Luis Enrique Figueroa,
president of the country's cent
ral bank, said in an interview.
It is important that Nicaragua
maintain at least the appearance
of substantial private involve
ment In the economy because,
among other problems, it suf
fers from a lack of credit from
outside sources and a serious
foreign debt.
Its chances for restoring credit
and investment and for re
negotiating its nearly $2 billion
debt depend largely on foreign
confidence, and that will be
weakened even more than it is
already if most of the economy
slips into the government's

hands.
A pluralistic economy also is
crucial in obtaining political
support from Latin American
and Western European coun
tries that have not, as has the
United States, given up on San
dinista promises to preserve an
open and democratic society.
Finally, what remains of the
private sector would join an al

ready serious exodus, depriving
the country of expertise, capital
and diversity.
"At least half of the middle
class and the entrepreneurs
have gone," one business leader
who asked not to be named said.
"The rest are about to go unless
we are given assurances that we
won't be harassed and perse
cuted and that we can operate
our businesses by economic fac
tors and not politics."
Another level of sensitivity
concerns the functioning of the
economy itself. Statistics show
that the productivity and effi
ciency of business and industry
have fallen drastically since the
1971 revolution.
Over all, economic growth
was minus 2 percent and is not
recovering In 1983 as exports
continue to decline from 1982's
total of $348 million, which rep
resented an 11 percent drop
from the year before.
All of this decline has pushed
unemployment over 20 percent
and inflation to more than 25
percent, as demand exceeds the
available supply of goods.
Most foreign economists and
diplomats, as well as private
businessmen, blame govern

ment interference and misman
agement, although it is clear that
Nicaragua has suffered badly
from poor weather and the
worldwide recession.
"Most of their manufactured
goods were aimed at Central
America," one European
economist said, "and the market
has dropped."
So has the world market for

Nicaragua's most important raw
materials—sugar, coffee and
cotton. "Short of an unexpected
jump in commodity prices, I
don't see much chance for a re
covery here," another foreign

economist said.
Although surprisingly little
emphasis is put on it by the San
dinistas and their supporters,
the country has been badly hurt
by withdrawal of U.S. economic
aid and an unofficial trade
boycott by the Reagan adminis
tration.
The United States has with
drawn nearly all credit, making it
impossible for Nicaragua to ob
tain both financing and goods
from what has been its major
trading partner.
Despite these outside condi
tions, many economists and di
plomats say that the major prob
lem remains poor management
and inefficiency.
They point to food shortages
and rationing in a country rich in
agriculture, the declining pro
ductivity and a growing bureau
cracy that makes the simplest
business transaction a wrestling
match with red tape.
"In areas where the govern
ment has taken over," a Western
European diplomat said, "effi
ciency has dropped as much as
two-thirds. If they don't restore
some private control, this will be
an impossible country."

cotton. "Short of an unexpected
jump in commodity prices, I
don't see much chance for a re
covery here," another foreign

economist said.
Although surprisingly little
emphasis is put on it by the San
dinistas and their supporters,
the country has been badly hurt
by withdrawal of U.S. economic
aid and an unofficial trade
boycott by the Reagan adminis
tration.
The United States has with
drawn nearly all credit, making it
impossible for Nicaragua to ob
tain both financing and goods
from what has been its major
trading partner.
Despite these outside condi
tions, many economists and di
plomats say that the major prob
lem remains poor management
and inefficiency.
They point to food shortages
and rationing in a country rich in
agriculture, the declining pro
ductivity and a growing bureau
cracy that makes the simplest
business transaction a wrestling
match with red tape.
"In areas where the govern
ment has taken over," a Western
European diplomat said, "effi
ciency has dropped as much as
two-thirds. If they don't restore
some private control, this will be
an impossible country."

Managua, Nicaragua—The lef
tist government here has taken
over more than half of the coun
try's economy, despite official
claims that the private sector
controls the bulk of business
and production, according to
new research.
The results of the research by
the National Institute of Social
Studies, a private foundation
with links to the Sandinista re
gime, were obtained privately.
Diplomatic economists from
Latin America and Europe agree
with the conclusions.
According to the study, which
has not been made public, the
government now owns or con
trols at least 60 percent of
Nicaragua's industrial and
commerical capacity.
That contrasts with repeated
public statements by the San
dinistas that Nicaragua has a
pluralistic economy, with the
private sector holding 60 per
cent of it.
In fact, one Western diplomat
said, "not more than a year ago,
the 60 percent (private sector)
figure may have been correct;
but, if you look at the trends,
more and more individual prop
erty is going to the government
in some form or another."
According to the institute's
study, in every major sector,
from manufacturing to heavy ag
riculture, the Sandinistas now
have well over 50 percent in their
control. Only in industrial pro
duction does the private sector
hold more than 45 percent.
Another specialist, with an
admittedly anti-Sandinista out
look, predicted that, "overtime,
70 percent or more of the eco
nomy will belong to the gov
ernment. In our view, the pri
vate sector is a dying animal."
Sandinista economists denied
that the institute's study showed
a drop in private business parti
cipation, arguing that direct
government holdings still total
only about 40 percent of the
economy.
They base their interpretation
on assertions that cooperatives,
which are particularly important
in agriculture, should be in
cluded in the private sector. Yet
the cooperatives are organized

by the government, their credit
is arranged by the government,
their production quotas are set
by the government and much of
the marketing of their output,
particularly for export, is han
dled by the government.
"I have to admit that to in
clude the cooperatives in the
private sector is misleading," a
diplomat whose country is sym

7n areas where the government has taken over, effi
ciency has dropped as much as two-thirds. If they don't
restore some private control, this will be an impossible
country/
- a Western European diplomat

pathetic to the Sandinistas said.
The issue of how much of the
economy is government
controlled or remains in private
hands is important and sensitive
on several levels.
As part of their effort to con
vince international opinion that
Nicaragua is not a clone of Cuba
or a dependency of the Soviet
Union and its Communist Bloc
allies, the Sandinistas argue that
Nicaragua is a pluralistic society
with a mixed economy.
"We are not communists and
we don't have a socialist eco
nomy," Luis Enrique Figueroa,
president of the country's cent
ral bank, said in an interview.
It is important that Nicaragua
maintain at least the appearance
of substantial private involve
ment In the economy because,
among other problems, it suf
fers from a lack of credit from
outside sources and a serious
foreign debt.
Its chances for restoring credit
and investment and for re
negotiating its nearly $2 billion
debt depend largely on foreign
confidence, and that will be
weakened even more than it is
already if most of the economy
slips into the government's

hands.
A pluralistic economy also is
crucial in obtaining political
support from Latin American
and Western European coun
tries that have not, as has the
United States, given up on San
dinista promises to preserve an
open and democratic society.
Finally, what remains of the
private sector would join an al

ready serious exodus, depriving
the country of expertise, capital
and diversity.
"At least half of the middle
class and the entrepreneurs
have gone," one business leader
who asked not to be named said.
"The rest are about to go unless
we are given assurances that we
won't be harassed and perse
cuted and that we can operate
our businesses by economic fac
tors and not politics."
Another level of sensitivity
concerns the functioning of the
economy itself. Statistics show
that the productivity and effi
ciency of business and industry
have fallen drastically since the
1971 revolution.
Over all, economic growth
was minus 2 percent and is not
recovering In 1983 as exports
continue to decline from 1982's
total of $348 million, which rep
resented an 11 percent drop
from the year before.
All of this decline has pushed
unemployment over 20 percent
and inflation to more than 25
percent, as demand exceeds the
available supply of goods.
Most foreign economists and
diplomats, as well as private
businessmen, blame govern

ment interference and misman
agement, although it is clear that
Nicaragua has suffered badly
from poor weather and the
worldwide recession.
"Most of their manufactured
goods were aimed at Central
America," one European
economist said, "and the market
has dropped."
So has the world market for

Nicaragua's most important raw
materials—sugar, coffee and
cotton. "Short of an unexpected
jump in commodity prices, I
don't see much chance for a re
covery here," another foreign

economist said.
