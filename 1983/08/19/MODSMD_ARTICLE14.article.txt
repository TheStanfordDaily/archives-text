## University to install new phone system 
### ELLI VEIDEMAN 
The University is planning a
$22 million to $26 million mod
ernization of its campus tele
phone and electronic communi
cations systems.
An estimated $12.5 to $14.5
million of this money will go to
replace the present telephone
system and to construct a new
telecommunications building.
Other elements in the elec
tronic communications media
project will include a Stanford
University Network (SUNet), an
energy management and control
system, and a distribution sys
tem that will be the common de
nominator of all three.
Under the telecommunica
tions department's project
plans, the existing telephone
system will be replaced by a
new, computerized system bet
ter equipped to serve University
needs.
The current telephone system
installed in 1973 is "very reli
able,' according to |oe Deßode,
manager of telecommunication
services. But it does not have the

capabilities needed in the future
to reduce inefficient use of time
and University funds.
Pending final approval from
the board of trustees, the proj
ect has a target completion date
of |une or July, 1985. Construc
tion of the distribution system is
due to begin this fall. The instal-

According to Joe Deßode, manager of
telecommunications services, the
current University phone system is
growing obsolete and is becoming'more
and more expensive to maintain/

lation of the underground con
duit and cabling is the first step
in modernizing the currently
saturated system.
According to Deßode, one of
the major disadvantages of the
current Centrex system is main
tenance. As an electrical
mechanical system, it is growing
obsolete and is becoming "more
and more expensive to main-

tain."
The major problem is the "in
ability of the individual (phone)
user to transfer calls without
operator involvement," accord
ing to Greg Speiger, a consultant
in the telecommunications de
partment. Call forwarding is lim
ited and party line conferencing

is not possible without operator
assistance. With the new com
puterized system and its many
features, an individual will be
able to establish call forwarding
and conferencing himself.
The new system should also
decrease the number of cross
lines and background ringing
that are not uncommon occur
rences now, according to
Michael Carlick, console atten
dant at the telecommunications
department. "People get cut off
quite a bit," he said.
Making moves and changes in
existing outlets under the cur
rent system is costly and re
quires servicing by a technician.
The new system will allow
changes to be made directly
through an on campus data ter
minal that accepts software
rather than hardware changes.
The cost for station movement
will be greatly reduced as a re
sult of this reprogramming fea
ture. In addition, there will be a
significant savings in labor.
Consultant studies have indi
cated that over a five year period
after its introduction, the system

will save an estimated $5 million
to $7 million. Unlike the current
Centrex system, it will also be
protected from tariff increases
and thus would eventually pay
for itself.

The overall benefits will in
clude a reduction in individual
departmental telephone opera
tion costs and an increased rate
stability.
Since nearly two-thirds of
Stanford's phones are located in
the area of the Main Quad, For
sythe Hall and the Medical Cen
ter, the chosen site for the $1.5
million to $2 million new tele
communications building will
be above the underground
thermal reservoir, putting it
right next to the busy areas.
The new building will be large
enough to accommodate the
new equipment and will house
one of the main new switches.
The other will be located at the
Medical Center.
Both switches will be con
nected to "nodes" placed at var
ious points throughout the
campus, making excess cabling
unneccessary.
According to Deßode, the first
activity the campus will see is an
"intensive station review" that
the telephone vendors and tele

communication department will
be conducting. They will deter
mine the locations and features
of the new phones.
The second most noticeable
change will be the switch from
rotary dial phones to the
Touch-Tone type.
Once the vendor is chosen in
Decemberand installation ofthe
system begins, a training pro
gram to aid and teach people
how to use the system will be
gin, Deßode said. The system is
so "radically different in its use
of features" that particular em
phasis is being placed on the
training session, he added.
"Once the new system is
wired in, there will be a period of
time when people will have two
phones on their desk—the new
and the old," Deßode said. This
gradual phasing in of the new
system will allow time for iron
ing out "the glitches in the sys
tem."
Planners intend to install the
University switch first, and then
to convert the Medical Center
three or four months after the
University system has been "de
bugged."
"We don't want problems
(with the telephones) to inter
fere with patient care," Deßode
added.
The residential dorms and the
bookstore will not be affected by
the modernization as they have
separate systems of their own.
The energy management and
control project will cost $1.6 mil
lion. It will affect 70 campus
buildings through a computer
based direct digital control.
The energy management
project is expected to reduce
electrical consumption by 1.9
percent, steam by 0.9 percent,
and chilled water by 5 percent.

enough to accommodate the
new equipment and will house
one of the main new switches.
The other will be located at the
Medical Center.
Both switches will be con
nected to "nodes" placed at var
ious points throughout the
campus, making excess cabling
unneccessary.
According to Deßode, the first
activity the campus will see is an
"intensive station review" that
the telephone vendors and tele

communication department will
be conducting. They will deter
mine the locations and features
of the new phones.
The second most noticeable
change will be the switch from
rotary dial phones to the
Touch-Tone type.
Once the vendor is chosen in
Decemberand installation ofthe
system begins, a training pro
gram to aid and teach people
how to use the system will be
gin, Deßode said. The system is
so "radically different in its use
of features" that particular em
phasis is being placed on the
training session, he added.
"Once the new system is
wired in, there will be a period of
time when people will have two
phones on their desk—the new
and the old," Deßode said. This
gradual phasing in of the new
system will allow time for iron
ing out "the glitches in the sys
tem."
Planners intend to install the
University switch first, and then
to convert the Medical Center
three or four months after the
University system has been "de
bugged."
"We don't want problems
(with the telephones) to inter
fere with patient care," Deßode
added.
The residential dorms and the
bookstore will not be affected by
the modernization as they have
separate systems of their own.
The energy management and
control project will cost $1.6 mil
lion. It will affect 70 campus
buildings through a computer
based direct digital control.
The energy management
project is expected to reduce
electrical consumption by 1.9
percent, steam by 0.9 percent,
and chilled water by 5 percent.

The University is planning a
$22 million to $26 million mod
ernization of its campus tele
phone and electronic communi
cations systems.
An estimated $12.5 to $14.5
million of this money will go to
replace the present telephone
system and to construct a new
telecommunications building.
Other elements in the elec
tronic communications media
project will include a Stanford
University Network (SUNet), an
energy management and control
system, and a distribution sys
tem that will be the common de
nominator of all three.
Under the telecommunica
tions department's project
plans, the existing telephone
system will be replaced by a
new, computerized system bet
ter equipped to serve University
needs.
The current telephone system
installed in 1973 is "very reli
able,' according to |oe Deßode,
manager of telecommunication
services. But it does not have the

capabilities needed in the future
to reduce inefficient use of time
and University funds.
Pending final approval from
the board of trustees, the proj
ect has a target completion date
of |une or July, 1985. Construc
tion of the distribution system is
due to begin this fall. The instal-

According to Joe Deßode, manager of
telecommunications services, the
current University phone system is
growing obsolete and is becoming'more
and more expensive to maintain/

lation of the underground con
duit and cabling is the first step
in modernizing the currently
saturated system.
According to Deßode, one of
the major disadvantages of the
current Centrex system is main
tenance. As an electrical
mechanical system, it is growing
obsolete and is becoming "more
and more expensive to main-

tain."
The major problem is the "in
ability of the individual (phone)
user to transfer calls without
operator involvement," accord
ing to Greg Speiger, a consultant
in the telecommunications de
partment. Call forwarding is lim
ited and party line conferencing

is not possible without operator
assistance. With the new com
puterized system and its many
features, an individual will be
able to establish call forwarding
and conferencing himself.
The new system should also
decrease the number of cross
lines and background ringing
that are not uncommon occur
rences now, according to
Michael Carlick, console atten
dant at the telecommunications
department. "People get cut off
quite a bit," he said.
Making moves and changes in
existing outlets under the cur
rent system is costly and re
quires servicing by a technician.
The new system will allow
changes to be made directly
through an on campus data ter
minal that accepts software
rather than hardware changes.
The cost for station movement
will be greatly reduced as a re
sult of this reprogramming fea
ture. In addition, there will be a
significant savings in labor.
Consultant studies have indi
cated that over a five year period
after its introduction, the system

will save an estimated $5 million
to $7 million. Unlike the current
Centrex system, it will also be
protected from tariff increases
and thus would eventually pay
for itself.

The overall benefits will in
clude a reduction in individual
departmental telephone opera
tion costs and an increased rate
stability.
Since nearly two-thirds of
Stanford's phones are located in
the area of the Main Quad, For
sythe Hall and the Medical Cen
ter, the chosen site for the $1.5
million to $2 million new tele
communications building will
be above the underground
thermal reservoir, putting it
right next to the busy areas.
The new building will be large
enough to accommodate the
new equipment and will house
one of the main new switches.
The other will be located at the
Medical Center.
Both switches will be con
nected to "nodes" placed at var
ious points throughout the
