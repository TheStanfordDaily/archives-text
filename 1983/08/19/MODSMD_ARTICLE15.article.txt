## Grateful Dead author explains the fascination

When the Grateful Dead play Frost
Amphitheatre this weekend, you can bet
Stanford graduate Paul Grushkin will be
there.
Because when it comes to the Grateful
Dead, Grushkin wrote the book—The Of
ficial Book of the Dead Heads.
What is a Dead Head?
You'll see them on campus this
weekend. They crawl out of the woods
around Frost, tie-dyed and strung out,
looking for a friend or a light or an extra
ticket to a Dead show, man.
But Grushkin says not all Dead fans are
'60s holdovers.
"A huge percentage of their audience
is of that era, of that mind set. But there
are just as many doctors and lawyers who
like the band."
And what is it about these musicians
that makes people devote their lives to
traveling across the country—and even to
Egypt—to see the Dead perform?
Grushkin says it's patience.
"They have patience. There's an in
evitability in the music itself. Some nights
it just might not be The Most Incredible
Thing You've Ever Heard. But it might be
tomorrow night. We don't know whether
the Frost concerts are going to be The All
Time Shows. But it might be. It might not

be this concert, but it might be the next
one. But if we don't go. . . "
For a lot of Dead Heads, not going just
isn't an option.
"Some people really take it too far.
They travel constantly to see the band. It's
not particularly harmful, it's just a bit ob
sessive, perhaps."
But Grushkin says it's easy to get
hooked, to get on the bus, to become a
Dead Head.
"The Dead plays a peculiar type of
American folk music. It's jazz, blues and
rock and roll all rolled into one, a genial,
comfortable type of music that makes
everyone dance and sway and meditate
and think about things a little. That ap
peals to people. You can be young or old
or in between and still get off on that."
Grushkin says the band's longevity is
also a factor in the Dead's popularity.
"At 18 plus years, one would have to
say that that alone gives them a certain
permanency. They've established an
identity with their music, and their rap
port with their audience is as unique in
music as anything. This didn't all happen
at the beginning in 1965. But certainly by
the early 1970s when the Dead grew out
of their San Francisco boundaries, their
popularity and notoriety grew and grew
and grew. They have become an endur

ing institution."
But still, no one travels across country
with other bands—the Who, the Rolling
Stones—that have been around just as
long.
"So many bands are devoted to enter
tainment, but they're facades. The Dead
speaks from the heart. For people who
love the Dead, the music is just a tremen
dous emotional release. People use it to
refresh the body and soul,"he explains.
Grushkin, manager of the Bay Area
Music Archives, says the music of Bob
Weir and Jerry Garcia and the others
"transcends their humanity.
"These musicians can combine and
improvise on things and it's earthshatter
ing, time-stopping, anything that's won
derful that you can think of. It's music
made by humans, but an elusive quality
does manage to manifest itself at the con
certs. You can stick your tongue out and
lick what's going through the air."
But most importantly, Grushkin says,
the Dead and the audience relate.
"A song called 'Touch of Grey' has an
incredibly stirring chorus. 'We will get by,
we will survive. . . ' They as band mem
bers can relate to that and we the audi
ence can relate to that as well."
Grushkin says that theme of survival is a
central theme of the book.

"Our book celebrates that business,
that 'we will get by, we will survive.'"
Because, Grushkin says, you don't
have to have been with the band in 1965
to be a real Dead Head, he decided not to
organize The Official Book of the Dead
Heads in a chronological manner.
"You have to go to the concerts to ap
preciate them. If you saw them the very
first time they played or just last Tuesday
in Phoneix, the thingthat really matters is
that you've been to a concert. It's be
cause the band is discovering the music
right then and there. They've got a stan
dard tune they're playing and they're fo
cused in and it sparkles."
The Official Book of the Dead Heads
captures some of the feeling of a Dead
show through dozens of letters from
Dead Heads and hundreds of newpaper
clippings.
In only three and a half months, about
50,000 copies of the book have been sold
and letters are pouring in from Dead
Heads anxious to tell their own Grateful
Dead stories.
"We are getting over a hundred letters
a week from people writing in to tell their
life stories. The book has evoked a lot of
feelings."
Will there be a sequel?
"It's inevitable."
