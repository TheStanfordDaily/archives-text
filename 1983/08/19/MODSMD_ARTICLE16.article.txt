## ZORBA A revival with some life to it 
### LAURENCE MASLON 
You may groan when you read
that Anthony Quinn is reviving
his famous role as Zorba the
Greek, but you really shouldn't.
Not only is the present revival of
Zorba in a class above the cur
rent glut of revivals, but in some
ways it actually creates a bit of
theater history.
The original Zorba repre
sented a kind of informal
watershed in Broadway musi
cals. Broadway was slowly escap
ing the kind of splashy mindless
star vehicles of the early and
mid-'6os (Dolly, Mame,
Charity-only the names
changed)and began to incorpo
rate serious issues and sophisti
cated theatrical devices (7776,
Hair, and Company appeared at
roughly the same time). Zorba
was directed by Harold Prince,
and in many ways the construc
tion and style of the musical set
the tone for the landmarks he
was to create with Stephen Sond
heim, like Follies and Pacific
Overtures. But Prince started his
directing career working with
the major songwriting teams of
the '60s, and Kander and Ebb,
one of the best of them,
supplied their best score for
Zorba.
Zorba the Creek, Nikos Kazan
takis' novel, was a "natural" for
musicalization. It had been a
successful novel, and an ex
tremely popular movie. The
story of Zorba, a big-souled
wanderer who embraced life
however and wherever he found
it, has all the stark contrasts and
outbursts of passion that
thoughtful musical theater can
handle very well, and the
creators rose to the occasion.
Many of the numbers mirror the
emotions of the characters as
well as advance the story. Some
times literal, sometimes
metaphorical, the musical has a
depth of emotion that is found in
the best moments of Fiddler on
the Roof, also written by Zorba's
librettist Joseph Stein. The orig

inal Zorba was a mild success
with Herschel Bernardi in the
lead, but there was something
about the stark concept (with its
opening number "Life Is (What
You Do While You're WaitingTo
Die)") that put Broadway audi
ences off.
In seeking to revive it with An
thony Quinn repeating his
movie success in the lead role,
the producers hit a financial
brainstorm which also produced
an artistic success. Zorba may
seem like one of those drag
out-the-o I d-star-and-the-o Id
scenery revivals, but it isn't. The
movie's director, Michael
Cacoyannis, and its co-star, Lila
Kedrova, have also been signed
on, but no one has ever worked
so well on this musical, and an
idiosyncratic musical it is, be
fore.
In many ways, the choice of
Cacoyannis was the shrewdest

one. He is a wonderful theater
director, eliminating many of
the show-bizzy aspects of the
show, and giving it a clear, sure
hand. The story has all the ele
ments of a Christian story as well
as a humanistic one: philo
sophic learning, redemption,
death, resurrection. Cacoyannis
has opened it up to all pos
sibilities of interpretation. The
staging is fast and imaginative
without being pretentious.
The musical necessitates a
kind of Greek tragedy staging. A
single figure dressed in black,
called the Woman, comments
on the action and joins in it when
necessary. Although her chaiac
ter is handled less well than il
might have been—she should
be more mysterious—it is a tar
cry from the pretentiousness of
Che in Evita.
It is also a tribute to the di
rector that Quinn, the show's

raison d'etre, always services the
show first, and his fans second.
And he certainly deserves his
many fans. Practically every line
captures a laugh or a satisfied
gasp of recognition, but there is
nothing sentimental or pander
ing in his performance. He is
strong, virile and quite skillful in
the way he steers out of some of
the book's more sentimental
waters. His singing may leave
something to be desired (it must
make the conductor suicidal),
but he is so solid that he makes
the rest of the show fall into
place.
And it is a disciplined show.
The small, but tight and energe
ticensemble isasurprisingtreat,
and no one in the cast falls short
of this energy. Robert Westen
berg as the young writer whom
Zorba counsels about life does
an especially fine job with a
thankless second banana role.

His achievement is consider
able. Debbie Shapiro as the
Woman brings a tremendous
force and voice to another tricky
part, and Lila Kedrova, reprising
her role as the aging courtesan
who becomes Zorba's lover, is
also terrific for her sensitive and
solid playing of a role easily
turned into a case of the Broad
way cutes.
Cacoyannis, Quinn, Kedrova,
and the suberb design team,
especially David Chapman with
his sparse Cretan sets, have
done something quite remarka
ble. They have dusted off a
commercial failure of great
worth, given it a new, tightly
original, highly professional re
suscitation, and returned it to
where I think it belongs—the
canon of exceptional American
musicals. Let's only hope that
others are bright enough to fol
low their example.

You may groan when you read
that Anthony Quinn is reviving
his famous role as Zorba the
Greek, but you really shouldn't.
Not only is the present revival of
Zorba in a class above the cur
rent glut of revivals, but in some
ways it actually creates a bit of
theater history.
The original Zorba repre
sented a kind of informal
watershed in Broadway musi
cals. Broadway was slowly escap
ing the kind of splashy mindless
star vehicles of the early and
mid-'6os (Dolly, Mame,
Charity-only the names
changed)and began to incorpo
rate serious issues and sophisti
cated theatrical devices (7776,
Hair, and Company appeared at
roughly the same time). Zorba
was directed by Harold Prince,
and in many ways the construc
tion and style of the musical set
the tone for the landmarks he
was to create with Stephen Sond
heim, like Follies and Pacific
Overtures. But Prince started his
directing career working with
the major songwriting teams of
the '60s, and Kander and Ebb,
one of the best of them,
supplied their best score for
Zorba.
Zorba the Creek, Nikos Kazan
takis' novel, was a "natural" for
musicalization. It had been a
successful novel, and an ex
tremely popular movie. The
story of Zorba, a big-souled
wanderer who embraced life
however and wherever he found
it, has all the stark contrasts and
outbursts of passion that
thoughtful musical theater can
handle very well, and the
creators rose to the occasion.
Many of the numbers mirror the
emotions of the characters as
well as advance the story. Some
times literal, sometimes
metaphorical, the musical has a
depth of emotion that is found in
the best moments of Fiddler on
the Roof, also written by Zorba's
librettist Joseph Stein. The orig

inal Zorba was a mild success
with Herschel Bernardi in the
lead, but there was something
about the stark concept (with its
opening number "Life Is (What
You Do While You're WaitingTo
Die)") that put Broadway audi
ences off.
In seeking to revive it with An
thony Quinn repeating his
movie success in the lead role,
the producers hit a financial
brainstorm which also produced
an artistic success. Zorba may
seem like one of those drag
out-the-o I d-star-and-the-o Id
scenery revivals, but it isn't. The
movie's director, Michael
Cacoyannis, and its co-star, Lila
Kedrova, have also been signed
on, but no one has ever worked
so well on this musical, and an
idiosyncratic musical it is, be
fore.
In many ways, the choice of
Cacoyannis was the shrewdest

one. He is a wonderful theater
director, eliminating many of
the show-bizzy aspects of the
show, and giving it a clear, sure
hand. The story has all the ele
ments of a Christian story as well
as a humanistic one: philo
sophic learning, redemption,
death, resurrection. Cacoyannis
has opened it up to all pos
sibilities of interpretation. The
staging is fast and imaginative
without being pretentious.
The musical necessitates a
kind of Greek tragedy staging. A
single figure dressed in black,
called the Woman, comments
on the action and joins in it when
necessary. Although her chaiac
ter is handled less well than il
might have been—she should
be more mysterious—it is a tar
cry from the pretentiousness of
Che in Evita.
It is also a tribute to the di
rector that Quinn, the show's

raison d'etre, always services the
show first, and his fans second.
And he certainly deserves his
many fans. Practically every line
captures a laugh or a satisfied
gasp of recognition, but there is
nothing sentimental or pander
ing in his performance. He is
strong, virile and quite skillful in
the way he steers out of some of
the book's more sentimental
waters. His singing may leave
something to be desired (it must
make the conductor suicidal),
but he is so solid that he makes
the rest of the show fall into
place.
And it is a disciplined show.
The small, but tight and energe
ticensemble isasurprisingtreat,
and no one in the cast falls short
of this energy. Robert Westen
berg as the young writer whom
Zorba counsels about life does
an especially fine job with a
thankless second banana role.

His achievement is consider
able. Debbie Shapiro as the
Woman brings a tremendous
force and voice to another tricky
part, and Lila Kedrova, reprising
her role as the aging courtesan
who becomes Zorba's lover, is
also terrific for her sensitive and
solid playing of a role easily
turned into a case of the Broad
way cutes.
Cacoyannis, Quinn, Kedrova,
and the suberb design team,
especially David Chapman with
his sparse Cretan sets, have
done something quite remarka
ble. They have dusted off a
commercial failure of great
worth, given it a new, tightly
original, highly professional re
suscitation, and returned it to
where I think it belongs—the
canon of exceptional American
musicals. Let's only hope that

low their example.
