Assume for the moment that
pop music exists for the sake of
emotion —that good pop songs
of ail varieties somehow send
shivers straight through the ears
and down the spines of teen
aged Americans. Over the last 30
years pop music has developed
along two lines: on the one hand
there's soul, where the singers
bring emotion to simple, univer
sal songs, and on the other
there's rock and roll, where the
guitarists do the same thing for
even simpler songs. (Rhythm
and blues simply substitutes
bass and massed voices for
rock's guitars.) But during the
'70s a third line emerged with
the advent of the singer/
songwriters. Most of these
people could neither sing nor
play their instruments very well,
so they got emotion across by
being intensely, nakedly au
tobiographical in their lyrics —
the musical equivalent of soft
core porn.
Jackson Browne has always
been one of the best of the
singer/songwriters, and on two
albums released in the late '70s
— The Pretender and Running
On Empty — he made some of
the decade's best music. Not
coincidentally, Browne has been
one of the most guarded of the
group; even when he was re
sponding directly to his wife's
suicide on The Pretender, you
didn't feel you were supposed to
pity him or share his anger.
Browne also has had the most
extreme case of a disease com
mon among singer/songwriters
— a fascination with rock and
roll. Over his last three albums
his songs have become shorter
and faster and picked up a beat.
Lawyers In Love takes this pro
cess all the way, and you just
can't deny that it is rock — unfor
tunately, it's rock as seen by
Southern California dilettantes.
Browne probably has the best

L.A. band money can buy play
ing around him on Lawyers In
Love, and they produce expert,
synthesizer-heavy rock noise.
But their hearts (if they have any)
aren't in it. This album defines
"slick" in a way that other bands
can only dream about.
So what about the lyrics, you
ask. Even on Hold Out, his last
album —which was very much a
mixed bag — the best songs,
such as "Call It a Loan" and
"Missing Persons," were as
good as anything Browne had
done. It's hard to tell with
Lawyers In Love — to go with the
new rock feel, the songs have
gotten so simple and moon-
Junish that Browne, who still
sings like he just had his tonsils
removed, can't begin to make
them convincing, to bring to
them the necessary emotion.

'Lawyers In Love' is,
in fact, about the
changes in Jackson
Browne - if you listen
to it closely > he tells
you why, after making
brilliant soft confes
sional music for years,
he's now making
heartless rock and
roll.

Browne needs longer, starker
songs and complex lyrics that he
can recite (as opposed to sing
ing). In the new format, where
he forces himself to cut corners
lyrically, Browne's snideness
leaks out — but even so, there's
no room for a line as transcen
dentally snide as "I'm going
back inside, and turning out the
light/And I'll be in the dark, but
you'll be out of sight," from The
Pretender's "Here Come Those
Tears Again."

The album's first seven songs
take turns dealing with two sub

jects — how fucked up the world
is ("Lawyers In Love," "Say It
Isn't True," and "Downtown" —
a song about downtown Los
Angeles that has one great line,
"Eight blocks south of City Hall/
The rats run free and the winos
crawl," and follows it with the
truly awful "Darkness falls on
the fast machine/Where the fu
ture stops, the American
dream") and how true love
doesn't exist anymore ("On the
Day," "Cut It Away," "Tender Is
the Night" and "Knock on any
Door"), making the fucked-up
world even harder to take. The
last song, "For a Rocker" (which
may or may not be about Buddy
Holly), sounds upbeat at first;
but then you realize he's saying
that dancing to rock and roll
(and not old Jackson Browne
tunes) is all there is left to do
while you wait for the
apocalypse, which not only has
been said before better, but is a
really depressing end to a really
depressing album.
Lawyers In Love is full of sar
donic echoes of, and references
to, old Browne songs: "Cut It
Away" cuts "Hold On Hold
Out," "Tender Is the Night" re
fers back to "The Pretender"
and "For a Rocker" is an obvious
follow-up to "For a Dancer." It's
almost as if Browne is laughingat
himself and the music he used to
make. Maybe the album's
Fitzgerald reference ("Tender Is
the Night") is an indication that
Browne fears his career will lack
a second act. Maybe it will — it's
hard to imagine him doing the
things he's done before better,
and in the American music busi
ness that means the end of the
line — but so far he hasn't shown
any sign of wanting to do any
thing about it. If the world
doesn't come to an end before
next year, Jackson Browne may
find Lawyers In Love a pretty
embarrassing thing to have lying
around.

gotten so simple and moon-
Junish that Browne, who still
sings like he just had his tonsils
removed, can't begin to make
them convincing, to bring to
them the necessary emotion.

'Lawyers In Love' is,
in fact, about the
changes in Jackson
Browne - if you listen
to it closely > he tells
you why, after making
brilliant soft confes
sional music for years,
he's now making
heartless rock and
roll.

Browne needs longer, starker
songs and complex lyrics that he
can recite (as opposed to sing
ing). In the new format, where
he forces himself to cut corners
lyrically, Browne's snideness
leaks out — but even so, there's
no room for a line as transcen
dentally snide as "I'm going
back inside, and turning out the
light/And I'll be in the dark, but
you'll be out of sight," from The
Pretender's "Here Come Those
Tears Again."

The album's first seven songs
take turns dealing with two sub

jects — how fucked up the world
is ("Lawyers In Love," "Say It
Isn't True," and "Downtown" —
a song about downtown Los
Angeles that has one great line,
"Eight blocks south of City Hall/
The rats run free and the winos
crawl," and follows it with the
truly awful "Darkness falls on
the fast machine/Where the fu
ture stops, the American
dream") and how true love
doesn't exist anymore ("On the
Day," "Cut It Away," "Tender Is
the Night" and "Knock on any
Door"), making the fucked-up
world even harder to take. The
last song, "For a Rocker" (which
may or may not be about Buddy
Holly), sounds upbeat at first;
but then you realize he's saying
that dancing to rock and roll
(and not old Jackson Browne
tunes) is all there is left to do
while you wait for the
apocalypse, which not only has
been said before better, but is a
really depressing end to a really
depressing album.
Lawyers In Love is full of sar
donic echoes of, and references
to, old Browne songs: "Cut It
Away" cuts "Hold On Hold
Out," "Tender Is the Night" re
fers back to "The Pretender"
and "For a Rocker" is an obvious
follow-up to "For a Dancer." It's
almost as if Browne is laughingat
himself and the music he used to
make. Maybe the album's
Fitzgerald reference ("Tender Is
the Night") is an indication that
Browne fears his career will lack
a second act. Maybe it will — it's
hard to imagine him doing the
things he's done before better,
and in the American music busi
ness that means the end of the
line — but so far he hasn't shown
any sign of wanting to do any
thing about it. If the world
doesn't come to an end before
next year, Jackson Browne may
find Lawyers In Love a pretty
embarrassing thing to have lying
around.

Assume for the moment that
pop music exists for the sake of
emotion —that good pop songs
of ail varieties somehow send
shivers straight through the ears
and down the spines of teen
aged Americans. Over the last 30
years pop music has developed
along two lines: on the one hand
there's soul, where the singers
bring emotion to simple, univer
sal songs, and on the other
there's rock and roll, where the
guitarists do the same thing for
even simpler songs. (Rhythm
and blues simply substitutes
bass and massed voices for
rock's guitars.) But during the
'70s a third line emerged with
the advent of the singer/
songwriters. Most of these
people could neither sing nor
play their instruments very well,
so they got emotion across by
being intensely, nakedly au
tobiographical in their lyrics —
the musical equivalent of soft
core porn.
Jackson Browne has always
been one of the best of the
singer/songwriters, and on two
albums released in the late '70s
— The Pretender and Running
On Empty — he made some of
the decade's best music. Not
coincidentally, Browne has been
one of the most guarded of the
group; even when he was re
sponding directly to his wife's
suicide on The Pretender, you
didn't feel you were supposed to
pity him or share his anger.
Browne also has had the most
extreme case of a disease com
mon among singer/songwriters
— a fascination with rock and
roll. Over his last three albums
his songs have become shorter
and faster and picked up a beat.
Lawyers In Love takes this pro
cess all the way, and you just
can't deny that it is rock — unfor
tunately, it's rock as seen by
Southern California dilettantes.
Browne probably has the best

L.A. band money can buy play
ing around him on Lawyers In
Love, and they produce expert,
synthesizer-heavy rock noise.
But their hearts (if they have any)
aren't in it. This album defines
"slick" in a way that other bands
can only dream about.
So what about the lyrics, you
ask. Even on Hold Out, his last
album —which was very much a
mixed bag — the best songs,
such as "Call It a Loan" and
"Missing Persons," were as
good as anything Browne had
done. It's hard to tell with
Lawyers In Love — to go with the
new rock feel, the songs have
gotten so simple and moon-
Junish that Browne, who still
sings like he just had his tonsils
removed, can't begin to make
them convincing, to bring to
