### 
University President Donald Kennedy joined
five other leading college presidents this week to
encourage stronger ties between America's uni
versities and public schools.
In a prepared statement, the group said that
although "substantial progress has been made in
improving access to our system of public educa
tion and in improving the academic achievement
of younger children," university administrators
must now push for "continuing gains in achieve
ment, without sacrificing our accomplishments in
educating all of our young people."
The meeting, organized by Kennedy and Har
vard University President Derek Bok, came as a
response to increasing concern about public edu
cation on the part of politicians and the media.
The six presidents—Kennedy, Bok, Hanna Gray
of Chicago, Robert McNeil of Wisconsin, Harold
Shapiro of Michigan and Michael Sovern of
Columbia—offered a ten-point plan for closer ties
to the country's public schools.

The six said that all universities should try to:
• make "improvements in educational practice
through collaboration of university faculties with
the schools"
• improve "teacher education programs, includ
ing opportunities for helping classroom teachers"
•provide "opportunities for the continued pro
fessional development of superintendents, prin
cipals and other school leaders"
•sponsor "special research programs on cam
pus for enriching the experience of students and
of school personnel"
•emphasize "research programs that are aimed
at deepening understanding of education and at
the improvement of teaching and learning"
•encourage "institutional and faculty participa
tion in collaborative curriculum development
projects"
•encourage university students to "consider
devoting part or all of their lives to teaching"
•emphasize "the importance of teaching in the
schools by recognizing espe
cially successful teachers
• serve "where needed, as
sources of advice in shaping of
public policies affecting educa
tion."
The administrators met earlier
this week at Pajaro Dunes, a vac
ation condominium community
near Salinas.
