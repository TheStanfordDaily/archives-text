## Synthesizers a sorry supplement 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Some jazz/fusion artists have
been acting pretty stupid lately.
Two of the most prominent —
violinist Jean-Luc Ponty and
saxo ph onist/vocalist Ronnie
Laws — redefined that very
word, "stupid," with their re
cently released 1983 albums.
The problem: synthesizers.
Jazz/fusion, following in the
footsteps of many others in the
music world, has entered the
electronic age. A sort of indus
trial revolution, if you will, with
synthesizers replacing humans
in bands.
Most of the songs on Ponty's
Individual Choice, only a week
old, feature one artist — Ponty
himself. Ponty playing the violin,
Ponty playing the synthesizers.
Ponty programming the drum
machines. Ponty doing every

thing but pressing the damn re
cords himself.
On Laws' Mr. Nice Guy, less
than half the songs have a real,
honest-to-Cod bass guitar in
them. Vou know, the kind with
strings and all. Instead, another
type of synthesizer (appropri
ately enough called a bass syn
thesizer) manufactures a
plastic-sounding bassline.
There's also DMX Drum Com
puters, OBX Synthesizers and
GSls, whatever they are, on Mr.
Nice Guy.
The bottom line is plain and
simple. None of it works.
But the funny thing of it is
Ponty can get away with the
same crime that Laws can't. Pon
ty's Individual Choice is actually
listenable, though musically it
fails. Mr. Nice Guy, on the other

hand, is awful. Despite two
normal-sounding songs, the LP
ranks among the worst jazz/
fusion albums in recent mem
ory.
Ponty fans will be glad to hear
that the French violinist still has
his unmistakable "sound," the
eerie, yet fluid combination of
synthesizers and his electric vio
lin. The various melodies on In
dividual Choice are interesting
and original. However, the drum
and rhythm machines that back
the violin solos are too manufac
tured and after first listening wal
low into the world of tedium
Individual Choice is an exam
ple of a well-done album as part
of this new, synthesized move
ment in jazz/fusion. Mr. Nice
Cuy is proof of one of much
poorer quality.

What's so amazing about the
two musician's sudden reliance
on the synthesizer is their 1982
albums were perhaps their best.
Side 2 of Ponty's 1982 effort,
Mystical Adventures, is his best
album side ever and contains
some of his most challenging
songs from a musical
standpoint. Solidground, Laws'
1982 release, is by far his top L P,
as it perfectly displays his in
strumental and vocal abilities.
Why the two decided to try
something new when at the
peak of their careers is hard to
understand. It can't be for
money, since neither I P will sell
once the word gets out that
there are better buys in the re
cord market today. A musician's
reputation can only carry him so
far.
The different sound of synthe
sizers as opposed to the actual

instruments is not the complete
problem, though. That humans
are not making those sounds on
the two albums is what's bother
some. The entire idea of the
band is undermined. The idea of
people working together as a
team to produce harmonic
sound is gone.
While the ear may not notice
much difference between a
snare drum and a drum ma
chine, the mind can't ignore the
fact that machines, rather com
puters, are producing the
sound.
Machines replaced manpower
as the chief force of labor during
the Industrial Revolution be
cause they were more efficient.
Granted, the machines replac
ing man in the music world are
more efficient. But efficiency
isn't the idea in music. Not by a
longshot.
