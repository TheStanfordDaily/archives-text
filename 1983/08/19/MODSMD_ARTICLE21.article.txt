# 'As You Like It': nonsense with charm and wit
## 
### MARC FAJER 
As You Like It is a show that
lives and dies to a large extent on
the performance of one actress.
Rosalind is one of the four or five
largest roles in Shakespeare,
and if she is not charming and
witty and lovable, the play can
come across as an awful lot of
nonsense. It is therefore a plea
sure to see a production in
which not only is Rosalind all
that she should be and more,
but some of the supporting cast
is good enough so that you don't
feel that you are watching only
one person for a whole evening.
If the Valley Shakespeare Festi
val production is graced with the
presence of Dianne Manning
performing splendidly in the
leading role, it is also blessed
with the awareness that there
are other interesting people in
the show who are well worth
watching.
Director Peter Nyberg has
done a generally fine job with
the play. Many of the subtleties
are brought out of the rich text
to give the play a great deal of
depth in places. The scenes
featuring Rosalind and Celia, her
cousin, together are especially
good. Their early moments to
gether demonstrate the affec
tion between the two girls with
out ever becoming maudlin, and
the joy and exuberance within
each of them is well portrayed.

Janice Cole, as Celia, is
superb; she manages to be
strong and interesting — every
bit Rosalind's equal — without
eclipsing the star in the scenes
with Orlando late in the show. It
is in those dialogues with her
"suitor," when she is dressed as
a boy, that Manning is at her
best. The real desire she has for

It is a pleasure to see a production in which not only is Rosalind all that
she should be and more, but some of the supporting cast is good
enough so that you don't feel that you are watching only one person for
a whole evening.

him shows through in just the
right places; we ache for her,
laugh with her, and appreciate
her as she explains the hazards
of love.
Bill Peck is less fortunate as
Orlando, and the major difficul
ties of the play come with his
characterization. He shouts
most of his lines, and reveals lit
tle depth, so that, although he is
very funny at times, he never at
tracts our sympathy. In this pro
duction, Orlando never seems
to change from beginning to
end, and Rosalind's entire

charade seems wasted on him.
He is no more ready for marriage
at play's end than Phebe or Sil
vius.
Dennis Martin leads the rest of
the cast in a very good perform
ance as both the good and the
evil dukes. He is evil enough in
the city, and inspirational
enough in the forest to carry off

the dual casting, and has just the
right sort of presence to be the
Robin Hood type figure that the
production calls for. Brian
Cousins and Lynn McCormick
are very funny as the shepherd
Silvius and his scornful love
Phebe. She wears a deliberately
unattractive huge red wig that
makes her look rather like
Raggedy Ann and which is hys
terical to watch.
Al Blair is very good as the
melancholy Jacques, providing
just the right mixture of insight

and humor. His famous "seven
ages of man" speech is beauti
fully delivered, though the di
rector chose to dim the lights for
the end of it and give it a bit more
depressing tone than I tend to
think works at that point.
David Booth is very funny as
the clown, Touchstone, though

he is a bit too professional in his
humor and lacks a little bit of the
warmth that makes the character
different from some of Shake
speare's other clowns. Richard
Garner is wonderful as old
Adam. He has a repertoire of
noises and gestures that are al
ways funny and his scenes are
some of the best in the show.
Dick Butterfield has a wonderful
voice singing Amiens, though
his Scottish (I think) accent
when he is speaking is a little
strange, and it tends to disap
pear when he is singing.

Among the better scenes in
the show not already discussed
is the "marriage" between the
"boy" Ganymede, pretendingto
be Rosalind, and Orlando. His
sense that things are not as sim
ple as they seem, and Rosalind's
sudden awareness of his confu
sion are beautifully done; the
scene is probably Peck's best in
the show.
Jacques' argument with Or
lando also is very well directed.
The choice to pick up on the way
the jesting is written and pause
before the last word or phrase of
each witticism works very well.
There are a couple of moments
that do not work as well, notably
what seems to be a general seri
ousness among the woodsmen
while singing lyrics like "this life
is most jolly." There is also a sort
of a dance that serves as a finale
that is not well done and is much
too long. But at the end of as
good a show as this, it was not
that serious a problem.
The Valley Shakespeare Festi
val productions are on tour for
the next couple of weeks, in
cluding a stop at the Concord
Pavilion. If vou run across them
doing As You Like It, it is well
worth the time to see them: the
performances of Dianne Man
ning and Janice Cole are espe
cially good, and the whole thing
is a lot of fun.
