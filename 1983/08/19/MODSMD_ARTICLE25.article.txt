## Wiggin won't make promises for '83 season 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
With the start of the college
football season nearly a month
off, the so-called experts are al
ready making their predictions
about Stanford in 1983.
But as far as head coach Paul
Wiggin is concerned, he
couldn't care less about the pre
season numbers being tossed
around. From Wiggin, there'll
be no promises and no hype in
1983. Just dedication.
"If you don't mind," he told
reporters Monday afternoon at
Ming's Restaurant, "I'd like to
quietly go about what we're do
ing."
Thirty-five freshmen arrived
Tuesday and began practice
Wednesday. Seventy upper
classmen are expected tomor
row with official practice starting
Monday morning. Stanford's
first game is at home, Sept. 10,
against Oklahoma, ranked
number one in many preseason
polls.
Among those early arrivals is
Stanford's prize catch of the 1983
recruiting season—local quar
terback star John Paye. The
Atherton resident was perhaps
the most highly-touted and
sought after high school player
this year.

Running backs Tom Henley
and Marshall Dillard and safety
Joe Cain also reaped numerous
prep accolades.
One thing that won't be arriv
ing Saturday among the up
perclassmen, though, is big
names. It is for that reason the
"experts" express skepticism
about Stanford football.
Cone from last year's 5-6
squad is the Golden Boy with an
even Coldener Arm, John Elway.
So is jitterbugging halfback Vin
cent White. So is about half the
offensive line.
So what's left? Receivers Emile
Harry and Mike Tolliver are
back, along with place kicker
Mark Harmon. Also returning
are nine of the 11 starters on the
defensive unit that ranked dead
last in the Pacific-10 Conference
last year.
Nonetheless, Wiggin ex
pressed a controlled sort of op
timism at Monday's press con
ference. "Based on what I saw in
spring practice, I saw a team
more than I have ever seen be
fore," he said. "The feeling of
'team' hits me more than any
thing else."
Losing a demi-god like Elway
and pass-catching halfbacks like
White and Mike Dotterer is bad

enough for a pass-oriented team
like Stanford. And the Cardinal's
1983 schedule won't ease the
pain a bit.
Seven of Stanford's 11 oppo
nents have the potential to be in
the top 20 nationally by the end
of the season—Oklahoma, Il
linois, Arizona State, UCLA,
Washington, Arizona and USC.
While not making predictions
about '83, Wiggin and company
have made some changes on
both sides of the ball. "The plan
is now," Wiggin urges. "We're
not building for three years
down the road."
The biggest change has come
on defense, where the Cardinal
will line up in a four linemen,
three linebackers configuration
as opposed to the 3-4 alignment
of past years. Much of the de
fensive personnel will remain
the same, but most will be play
ing slightly different positions.
On offense, Stanford will still
throw the football as is its
trademark. The type of passes
thrown, though, will be
different.
"We want to stay on the field
as long as possible," said offen
sive coordinator Jim Fassel. "We
want to strive to run more plays.
So you'll see us in more of a

timed passing game."
Fassel figures Steve Cottrell to
be the Cardinal's starting quar
terback, although Paye and Greg
Topp should challenge for the
job in preseason practices.

While Cottrell will have some
big shoes to fill (Elway's) and a
rich quarterbacking tradition to
uphold (Stanford's), Wiggin has
confidence in the 5-10, 185-
pound senior.
