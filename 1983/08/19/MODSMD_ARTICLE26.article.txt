Fanny and Alexander ★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingmar Bergman's rich, en
grossing movie, set in a Swedish
town in the 1910s, is named for
the two youngest members of a
theatrical family. It is impossible
to avoid seeing Bergman
himself, who planned this as his
last film, in the perceptive,
bright-eyed, tough-minded
Alexander (Bertil Guve), who is
a poet-dreamer, a theatrical ar
tist in the making. Dickens and
Hans Christian Andersen had a
hand in the deeply satisfying
traditional structure, and the
ghosts of Strindberg,
Shakespeare, Chekhov and
Feydeau make an appearance,
too. Though the second half of
this lengthy (three-and-a-half
hour) picture is not as firmly
controlled as the first, and as
Bergman moves through each
of his celebrated preoccupa
tions, they seem not only ter
ribly familiar but terribly per
functory, still one is grateful for
its sensuousness, for the elo
quent staging, for Sven Nykvit's
photography, and for many of
the performances — particular
ly those of GunnWallgren and
Pernilla Wallgren.
The Man Who Would Be
King (1975) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Huston and Gladys Hill
adapted Rudyard Kipling's su
perb short story, omitting many
of its ambiguities and neutral
izing its controversial political
content, but it's a handsome,
highly entertaining movie
nonetheless, and it contains
what is likely Huston's best sus
tained direction since the early
'50s (though his work in be
tween was often fascinating). In
a triumph of casting, Michael
Caine plays the con man adven
turer who sets out to become
rich in a mountain area of India,
and Sean Connery plays his less
swift pal, whose part of the
scheme is to become king of
the local tribe. At first Connery,
with his dark, bewhiskered
balloon face, seems too big,
physically and vocally, for his
role, but as the film proceeds he
finds uses for his frame and his
deep, resonant voice: he takes
on the look and sound of the
king. Christopher Plummer is
stuck playing Kipling.
Plays Sunday with Lawrence
of Arabia.

Say Amen, Somebody ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Watching the two ir
repressible oldsters at the cen
ter of this documentary —
Thomas A. Dorsey, the "father
of gospel music," and his prize
pupil, Willie Mae Ford Smith —
you get the feeling that George
T. Nierenberg, the producer
director, caught the last ves
tiges of first-generation gospel.
One of the many pleasures of
this movie is that if you are un
familiar with old-time gospel,
you find out how amazing the
best of it is, and you see the
links to jazz, blues and show
music. Nierenberg, a smart
documentarian with a sense of
irony, has captured some love
ly, unpredictable moments as
well as some overpowering mu
sical performances. With Delois
Barrett Campbell and the Bar
rett Sisters, Zella Jackson Price,
and the O'Neal Twins.
Plays Monday with Gospel.
Gospel
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ninety minutes of uninter
rupted gospel may seem relent
less, but some of the grou ps are
astonishing. The singers in
clude The Mighty Clouds of
)oy, Shirley Caesar, The
Hawkins Family, The Clark Sis
ters and Reverend James Cleve
land. Directed by David Leivick
and Frederick A. Ritzenberg.
Plays Monday with Say
Amen, Somebody.
The Captain's Paradise
(1953)
Festival, Palo Alto
Anthony Kimmins' comedy,
written by Alec Coppel and
Nicholas Phipps, has a wonder
ful premise: Alec Guinness
shares his life with two wives
(Celia Johnson and Yvonne De
Carlo), who together provide
an ideal existence — and who
do not, of course, know about
each other. The playing out of
this comic notion is disappoint
ing, though, despite the ad
mirable efforts of the three
stars. (Celia Johnson is particu
larly marvellous.) With Charles
Goldner, Miles Malleson, Bill
Fraser, and Nicholas Phipps
himself.

Plays through
Wednesday with The
Taming of the Shrew.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman
Fox, Redwood City
As John Fowles' mystery
woman, Sarah Woodruff, Meryl
Streep gives a remarkably
articulate performance, but her
mastery of technique is so clear
ly evident that it becomes the
theme of her scenes. Karel
Reisz directed this chilly, split
movie from Harold Pinter's
screenplay; in an attempt to
find a filmic equivalent for the
commentary chapters in
Fowles' novel, Pinter has pro
vided a modern story about the
filming of The French Lieuten
ant's Woman, filled with the el
liptical dialogue that is his spe
cialty, but Reisz's heart doesn't
seem to be in these scenes —
they're flat, and after a while
they begin to seem intrusive.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday
with Sophie's Choice.

Death Race 2000 (1975)
Paul Bartel's comic strip
parody is a lot like a college re
vue, but it's pretty consistently
clever and amusing. David Car
radine, displaying his star cha
risma, plays Mr. Frankenstein,
the reigning champ in the race
of the title. The plot is an out
growth of the old joke about
garnering points for every pe
destrian you can mow down in
your car — those are the rules
of the game. (Frankenstein gets
the race off to a rousing start by
running down his own pit
crew.) Robert Thom and
Charles Griffith wrote the
script, from a story by II
Melchior, and Roger Corman
produced it (of course). Syl
vester Stallone, Raul Julia and
others show up.
Plays today and tomorrow
with The Road Warrior.

The Road Warrior
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Set in Australia in the not
too-distant future, when the
fuel shortage has triggered a
war and the survivors wander in
bands searching for gas to keep
them going. The road is more or
less owned by brutal ma
rauders, and in the course of
the film one "family" enlists the
aid of Max (Mel Gibson, who
also played this role in Mad
Max) to defeat their hoodlum
adversaries. The director,
George Miller, is very talented,
and there are moments of
apocalyptic glory in Dean Sem
mler's photography, but the
movie is mostly a long destruc
tion orgy featuring bows and
arrows and cannon-sized flame
throwers. It's intended to be
funny, but it's difficult to re
member that when you are of
fered such delights as a child
tossing a boomerang into the
skull of one of the attackers. In
the last third, the picture has
the nervetoturnself-righteous,
and we are asked to hear lec
tures on survival and despair
from characters dressed like
medieval punk neanderthals.
Plays today and tomorrow
with Death Race 2000.
Brimstone and Treacle
Fox, Redwood City
This Gothic comedy comes
from the pen of Dennis Potter
(Pennies from Heaven). Sting,
of The Police, plays a nasty
young man who gains access to
the home of Denholm Elliott
and loan Plowright by posing as
an old school chum of their
daughter; she was left para
lyzed and incommunicative by
a car accident some months
ago. Elliott acquits himself with
remarkable aplomb, as usual,
but the rest of the picture is dis
maying. Potter exposes his
characters with satirical in
cisiveness but he shows no
compassion for them; the mov
ie gives off the unpleasant odor
of wit souring. Directed by
Richard Loncraine.
Plays today with Rude Boy.
