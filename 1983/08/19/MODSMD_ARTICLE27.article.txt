Hurricane slams into Texas
Houston — Hurricane Alicia slammed into
Houston yesterday like a sledgehammer from the
sea, shattering windows in skyscrapers and raining
jagged shards of tinted glass down onto the streets
of the city. The storm cut off electricity to 1.6 mil
lion people and reportedly left four persons dead.
Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmore ordered the
downtown area sealed off from traffic after Alicia
left gaping holes in storefronts and skyscrapers.
Streets were flooded and traffic was stalled in the
nation's fifth largest city. Repair crews were
stymied in their efforts to reconnect fallen utility
lines.
Buffalo Bayou, the city's main waterway and
feeder to the Houston Ship Channel connecting
the metropolis with the Gulf of Mexico, jumped
several feet over its banks. It flooded adjacent
roadways and filled the underground garage at
City Hall with water. Whitmore called the storm
"the most serious disaster I have ever seen."
Andropov urges weapons ban
Moscow — Soviet President Yuri Andropov met
with nine U.S. senators yesterday and proposed a
ban on anti-satellite weapons, a move the senators
said might be a "ploy" to maintain the Soviet
monopoly on space weaponry.
But the nine Democrats said they hoped the pro
posal would lead to serious treaty talks between
the superpowers. The delegation leader,
Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, said it provided the
"only degree of optimism" from a meeting that
lasted nearly two hours.
Pell and Western analysts said Andropov's pro
posal left a number of unanswered questions, in
cluding whether the Soviet Union still considers
the U.S. space shuttle an anti-satellite weapon.
Andropov was quoted by the official news agen-

cy Tass as telling the senators U.S.-Soviet ties are
"tense virtually in every field."
Pell, who spoke for the other senators at a news
conference in the U.S. ambassador's residence,
said there had been "signs of very, very modest im
provements in the air." But he added it would be
"premature" to speak of a thaw in East-West ten
sion.
Honduras asks for more aid
Tegucigalpa, Honduras — The commander of
Honduras' armed forces has asked the United
States for an extensive array of military hardware,
including warplanes and artillery, over the next
few years, according to diplomatic and military
sources.
The shopping list drawn up by Gen. Gustavo
Alvarez Martinez was presented to U.S. officials
earlier this year. Although its prospects depend on
how the threat from neighboring Nicaragua is
assessed by the Reagan administration and Con
gress, the army is already receiving its first artillery
from funds allocated earlier, the sources here said.
"If all of a sudden the threat goes away, there
might be a loss of interest in Congress because
they will ask what it is all going for," a U.S. diplomat
said. "Right now, we have a considerable threat." ,
Diplomat's son goes home
Washington — A red-eyed and solemn Andrei
Berezhkov, the 16-year-old son of a ranking Soviet
diplomat, denied to American reporters yesterday
that he had written President Reagan asking to re
main in the United States. Then, with the concur
rence of the U.S. government, he and his parents
flew for home.
The boy, in sessions with reporters at the Soviet
embassy compound and then at Dulles Interna
tional Airport, said: "The letterthat was published,
I didn't write it. Even my name wasspelled wrong."

Vietnam: talk slows search
Bangkok, Thailand — Vietnam has warned the
United States that continued hostile statements by
senior American officials would slowthe search for
Americans missing in action in the Vietnam War,
the Vietnamese news agency said yesterday.
The warning was issued in a memorandum pre
sented to U.S. Ambassador John Gunther Dean in
Bangkok and noted that Secretary of State George
Shultz and other officials had accused Vietnam of
holding back the remains of U.S. servicemen, the
agency said.
"It is obvious that the systematic hostile attitude
of the U.S. authorities does not help create the fa
vorable conditions and atmosphere for the search
of Americans missing in action, but causes more
obstacles.... The U.S. side must bear all responsi
bility for slow progress," the memorandum was
quoted as saying.
Today's weather
Increasing clouds tonight with a chance of
showers. Tomorrow look for morning fog and low
clouds. Chance of showers in the afternoon.
