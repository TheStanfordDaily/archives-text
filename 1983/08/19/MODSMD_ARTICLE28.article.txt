In a review of aerobic dance establishments in
last Friday's Daily, reviewer Jenna DeAngeles
wrote that Heartwork of Palo Alto charged $2.50
per session. In fact, session prices there run from
$1.75 to $2.00. The classes there offer 20 to 23
minutes of aerobic training, not 10, as previously
reported. The establishment offers warm-up and
cool-down exercises, and has had no reports of in
juries since they began business last year. The Daily
regrets any inconvenience the errors may have
caused. I
