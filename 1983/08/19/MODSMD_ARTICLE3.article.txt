# Roberti stalls on research bill
## 
### KATHY OLMSTED 
Scientists, patients and con
cerned citizens were surprised
Wednesday when the bill they
had travelled to Sacramento to
testify against was abruptly
withdrawn by its powerful spon
sor.
State Senate President Pro
Tem David Roberti (D-Los
Angeles) postponed the hearing
on his so-called "pound sei
zure" bill when it appeared that
it wouldn't pass the Assembly
Ciovernmental Organization
Committee.
The measure, SB 883, would
prohibit the use of pound ani
mals in biomedical research. It
has been strongly opposed by
Stanford and other research in
stitutions.
Roberti's press secretary, Bud
Lembke, said the senator had
decided to postpone the hearing
because another animal bill
sponsored by Assemblyman Wil
liam Filante (R-Greenbrae) con
fused the issue.
Lembke said the committee
members had been misled into
believing that the Filante bill,
which is supported by medical
researchers, is "an adequate
substitute" for Roberti's bill.
But the Roberti bill's oppo
wav Filante hill had
nothing to do with the senator's
decision to postpone the hear
ing.
The committee members
were not "misled," according to
Larry Horton, associate vice
president for public affairs. In
stead, they just recognized that
Roberti's bill was "ridiculous."
The Roberti bill doesn't strictly
prohibit the use of all animals in
research, but rather prohibits
pounds and shelters from selling
unclaimed animals to medical
researchers.
If the bill passes, scientists
would be forced to buy more
expensive, specially bred re
search animals. Scientists argue
that the Roberti bill would drive
up the cost of research and ulti
mately cause less research to be
done.
The Filante bill, on the other
hand, calls for a statewide iden

tification system for pets. The
bill's supporters believe that this
system would eliminate any pos
sibility of pets being used in
medical experiments.
However, Lembke said the bill
is "preposterous'' and impracti
cal. Scientists "living in ivory
towers don't understand the
huge bureaucracy that the bill
would require.
"It just won't work," he said.
But Horton said the Filante bill
responds to "all of the stated ob
jectives" of the Roberti bill. The
Roberti supporters' true objec
tive, though, is to completely
"stop the use of animals in re
search," Horton said.
An impressive assortment of
researchers, patients and "angry
citizens" had showed up at the
committee meeting on Wed
nesday to testify against the bill.
Famed Stanford cardiovascular
surgeon Norman Shumway,
heart transplant patients and
Stuart Damon, a soap opera star
who has a diabetic son, had
travelled to Sacramento to op
pose the bill.
But they were given no oppor
tunity to speak when Roberti ab
ruptly pulled the bill. The presi
dent pro tem had finally realized
that his bill never would pass,
B'""" tho impressive array of
witnesses, Horton said.
"I think the presentation
would have been overwhelm
ing," he said.
Roberti may take up the bill
again within the next couple of
weeks, Lembke said. He will use
the intervening time to use his
political clout to try to convince
the committee members to sup
port his bill.
In fact, Roberti's power is the
sole reason that the bill has got
ten this far, Horton said. As pres
ident pro tem, Roberti has the
"de facto power of forcing his
bills through the senate."
The measure passed the state
senate in )une. Assuming it
eventually passes the Govern
mental Operations Committee,
it still must pass the Ways and
Means Committee before it
reaches the Assembly floor.
