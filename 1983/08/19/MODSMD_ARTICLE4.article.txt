Stanford Chemistry Prof.
Henry Taube has been named
this year's recipient of the 1983
Welch award in chemistry, the
Welch Foundation announced
this week.
Citing Taube's "decades of
leadership and dedication," the
foundation awarded $150,000
and a gold medallion, which
Taube will receive on Nov. 7 in
Houston.
"When I heard about the
award five weeks ago, I naturally
was astonished. It took me a
while to really believe it," Taube
said.
Although the Welch Founda
tion has not specifically stated

why Taube received his award,
lack Josey, president of the
foundation, hinted that it was a
culmination of "ideas and ex
perimental methods" dis
covered by Taube in inorganic
chemistry that resulted in
Taube's selection.
A graduate of UC-Berkeley,
Taube taught at Cornell and the
University of Chicago before
coming to Stanford as a full pro
fessor in 1961.
Taube's first interest in inor
ganic chemistry came when he
was asked to teach an advanced
course in chemistry. He chose
coordinate chemistry, an essen
tial part of inorganic chemistry.
