Stanford Chemistry Prof.
Henry Taube has been named
this year's recipient of the 1983
Welch award in chemistry, the
Welch Foundation announced
this week.
Citing Taube's "decades of
leadership and dedication," the
foundation awarded $150,000
and a gold medallion, which
Taube will receive on Nov. 7 in
Houston.
"When I heard about the
award five weeks ago, I naturally
was astonished. It took me a
while to really believe it," Taube
said.
Although the Welch Founda
tion has not specifically stated

why Taube received his award,
lack Josey, president of the
foundation, hinted that it was a
culmination of "ideas and ex
perimental methods" dis
covered by Taube in inorganic
chemistry that resulted in
Taube's selection.
A graduate of UC-Berkeley,
Taube taught at Cornell and the
University of Chicago before
coming to Stanford as a full pro
fessor in 1961.
Taube's first interest in inor
ganic chemistry came when he
was asked to teach an advanced
course in chemistry. He chose
coordinate chemistry, an essen
tial part of inorganic chemistry.
Taube's primary field of inter
est is the understanding of the
rates of chemical reactions.
"When given the composition
and structure of two reactants,
the main question is, 'what can
we predict about the rate of
reaction with these inorganic
substances?' " Taube said.
Since the 19505, Taube has
played a significant role in the

renewed interest in inorganic
chemistry. He has been respon
sible for much of the research in
the understanding of electron
transfer, the reactivities of oxy
gen and nitrogen in chemical
and biochemical systems and
the properties of mixed valence
compounds.
His contributions in the study
of reactivity and reaction mech
anisms in inorganic chemistry
have also been well recognized.
The Welch Foundation was
founded in 1954 and has pro
vided more than $130 million in

research grants, The Welch
award was established in 1972 to
promote "basic chemical re
search" and to encourage re
search that "betters mankind,"
A panel of leading scientists
throughout the nation is re
sponsible for nominating the
winner each year.
Taube has also received the
National Medal of Science, the
Willard Cibbs Medal and the
American Chemistry Society's
award for Distinguished Service
in the Advancement of Inorganic
Chemistry. He is the eighth sci
entist to receive the Welch
award.
