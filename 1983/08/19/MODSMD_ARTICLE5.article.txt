It was art against the elements yesterday when a strange bit of summer weather dumped rain
on Mozart 11, the sculpture outside Meyer Library. The Weather Service says that there is a
chance of rain in the evening again today. But never fear, concert promoters for this
weekend's Grateful Dead concerts say the shows will go on rain or shine.
