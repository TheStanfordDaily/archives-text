## 'El Nino'-the century's unequaled natural catastrophe 
### 
Callao, Peru — When it began, the sea
change was not recognized for what it
was.
Northwest of this port town, the iso
lated reach of the eastern Pacific Ocean
along the Equator remained misleadingly
benign. The few who sailed near at the
time remember an eerie, beautiful still
ness — a flat sea of glassy waters and little
wind. The sun blazed from a crystal-blue
sky, interrupted only occasionally by a
towering cumulus cloud.
But the temperature of the sea surface
during May 1982 had risen slightly, less
than one degree Fahrenheit.
Reports of the subtle warming, meas
ured by weather satellites and drifting
buoys deployed by the United States' Na
tional Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), flowed that
month into the suburban Camp Springs,
Md., office of Gene Rasmusson, chief of
the diagnostics branch of NOAA's Cli
mate Analysis Center.
Rasmusson thought the readings odd,
particularly because the Southern
Hemisphere was entering its winter sea
son, but he figured the satellite data
probably were faulty. Then in )une, the
chronically low atmospheric pressure at a

measuring station in Darwin, Australia,
on the western side of the Pacific, sud
denly rose sharply, while the chronically
high pressure at another station in Tahiti,
in the central Pacific, fell dramatically.
Rasmusson made a passing reference
to the abnormal figures that month at a
gathering of the country's major me
terologists and oceanographers in Seat
tle. A few eyebrows were raised. Then the
scientists went on to other business.
"In retrospect, we should have been
able to figure what was happening,"
Oregon State University oceanographer
William Quinn said a year later. "The
signs were there."
What was happening was the begin
ning of a natural catastrophe unequaled
in this century, associated with a warm
ocean current called "El Nino." In the
past year, disrupted weather patterns
have wreaked havoc across three-fourths
of the globe, causing more than 800
deaths and $8 billion in damage.
For months, the vast natural world has
appeared to veer from the laws of rational
order. Perennial winds and currents have
died or reversed direction. Normal sea
levels and temperatures have soared or

plummeted. Millions of fish and seabirds
have disappeared. Weather systems have
been displaced by thousands of miles,
withering normally lush lands and turn
ing deserts into lakes.
California, the Rocky Mountain states,
the Gulf Coast, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia
staggered under torrential rains, flood
ing, mudslides and destructive tides,
while Australia, Indonesia and southern
Africa gasped through record droughts.
Some areas accustomed to six inches of
rain got 12 feet.
"This warm episode will go down in the
records as one of the strongest, and, in
some respects, one of the more unusual
events of the past century," Rasmusson
concluded last fall. "Things unheard of
were happening. From a human and eco
nomic standpoint, it may also have been
one of the most costly. The major socio
economic problems which have been
created in many areas of the world can
only be completely evaluated after the
event has passed into history."
The past year's events have also en
courged modesty rather than arrogance
in those usually accustomed to under
standing and mastering the natural

world. Armed with the finest instruments
modern technology could provide, some
of the premier scientists in meterology
and oceanography failed to predict what
was to happen, did not believe it when it
began, thought it was ending when it was
reaching a new peak, and announced it
was over when it was still lingering.
In the end, some of them joined the
laymen staring heavenward, pondering
man's vulnerability to the natural world's
unfathomable dynamics. Their learned
conversations became dotted with words
such as "awesome" and "humbling." In
interviews, some conceded that they
simply did not understand what was hap
pening.
"When you see what can happen, how
a quirk in the wind can do all this, it's
humbling," said Alan Strong of NOAA's
National Environmental Satellite, Data
and Information Service. "It reminds us
what mother nature can do. ... It is fas
cinating that what happens in one area
can affect the whole world. As to why this
happens, that's the question of the cen
tury. Scientists are trying to make order
out of chaos."
