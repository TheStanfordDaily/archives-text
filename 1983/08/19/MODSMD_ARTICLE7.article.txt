# Higher output by nation's industries
## 
### 
Washington — Industrial pro
duction picked up a strong 1.8
percent last month, the eighth
straight gain since the end of the
recession, government figures
showed Tuesday. Economists
said the pace will have to slacken
if inflation s to remain under
control, but for now, "we can sit
back and enjoy the rebound."
The higher output by the na
tion's factories and mines was
widespread among materials
and products with "especially
sharp rises in automobiles and
steel," the report from the Fed
eral Reserve Board said. And it
said output of carpeting and fur
niture surpassed the record set
in 1979.
"There are precious few sec
tors of the economy that are not
growing strongly right now,"
said Donald Straszheim of Whar
ton Econometrics.
Jerry Jasinowski, chief
economist for the National As
sociation of Manufacturers, said
the report foreshadows "rapid
economic growth" during this
August-October quarter and no
slowing in the rebound until the
fourth quarter.
Straszheim called the growth
"stunningly large" and "very
out-sized," adding that a slow
ing of the recovery is inevitable
over the next three or four quar
ters.
July's overall advance fol
lowed gains of 1.1 percent in
June and 1.3 in May, the Fed
said. Since the recovery started
late last year, only the 1.9 per
cent increase in April was larger.
The government's industrial

production index rose in July to
148.6 percent of the 1967 base.
The Fed said that was 10.2 per
cent above November but still
3.5 percent below the high of
July 1981, when the recession
was getting under way.
Ortner said Tuesday's figures
were a "glowing report" on the
economy, but emphasized that
the strong growth "is part of the
rebound."
He said such growth is "un
sustainable long-term" because
the economy does not have the
capacity to keep up that pace,
and undesirable "because infla
tion would begin to heat up very
quickly."
"But meanwhile, it's bringing
workers back into their jobs," he
said. "In the meantime, we can
sit back and enjoy the rebound
from the recession."
A Commerce Department re
port last week suggested there
was room for further increases
in production since sales by
manufacturers, wholesalers and
retailers climbed for the fourth
straight month in June and the
size of goods in stock declined.
Some economists said that al
though sales are expected to
remain strong, a separate report
last week showed that an antici
pated slowing from the recent
clip had already started in at least
one sector during July, as re
tailers posted a small 0.02 per
cent drop in sales. Jasinowski
said that slowing should mean
some rebuilding this month of
inventoriescut back sharply dur
ing the recession.
