## Oh sure, it's fun... 
### 
Everyone said the summer
Daily would be fun.
"It's a blast," they said. "No
one reads it. Just relax and en
joy."
Yeah, sure.
Oh, not that it hasn't been
educational. We've all learned
things about layout ("Uh, Jen
nifer, I think you'll need to cut
these stories a little. . .Well, so
what if the picture obliterated
the copy, Tony, it still looked
cool"), responsibility ("Has
anyone seen Tony?. . . Sorry
Alan, it's chocolate theme night
tonight") and frustration
("Maybe someone besides Dean
Caughey will write next week,
Shirish. . . Well, Tim, what in
teresting story ideas does the
PTT have for us today?")
We've learned what it's like to
produce a publication with a
skeleton staff ("No, Tim, I would
not like to write another
story. . .Does anyone know
where Tony is?. . . Just send a
whole gob of Greg Webb/

Dailys. . . Tim, we need another
house ad!. . . Is Tony back
yet?. . . Jennifer, there's an
awful lot of world news today.
How about another page?").
We've followed through on
some stories ("Mr. Palm, I hate
to bother you in the archives
again, but. . .") and missed
others ("Well, hell, if the barn
story is a week late anyway, we
might as well wait another is
sue"). We've made some mis
takes ("And where is A Nous La
Liberte playing, Steve?") and
had some triumphs ("Just let
them try to deny that Jimmy Car
ter is coming").
Come to think of it, I think the
dozen or so of us have done a
pretty good job—and had a hel
luva time while we were at it. So
to Paul, Julie, Bev, Donna, Jean,
Diane, Shirish, Jennifer, Rod,
Greg, Karen, Mike, Tony, Bill,
Tim and Alan: thanks for making
this a good paper and a great
summer.
