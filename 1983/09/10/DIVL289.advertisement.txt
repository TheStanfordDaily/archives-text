CASIO NOW OFFERS
STUDENT AD.
We at Casio figured you could use a
little help this semester (not to mention a
few extra bucks). So we're offering a $5
rebate on our FX-98 and FX-910 solar pow
ered scientific calculators, which regularly
sell for $29.95.
The FX-910 is a wallet sized unit with
48 scientific functions. The FX-98 is credit
card size with 42 scientific functions.
Both feature an 8 digit mantissa with 2
digit exponent.
Both feature fractional calculations (a
function not found on many comparable
units). So now you can work with fractions
without having to convert to decimals.
And since both units incorporate a
powerful solar cell that can operate in very
low light, they'll not only save you time and
energy, they'll save you from ever having
to buy batteries.
The FX-98 and FX-910 also come with
a free application manual, "Strategies for
Scientific Calculating," which will save you
work by showing you shortcuts for using
your calculator.
So if you think you could use a little
student aid this semester, take advantage of
our $5 rebate offer. And bring a Casio to
class.
