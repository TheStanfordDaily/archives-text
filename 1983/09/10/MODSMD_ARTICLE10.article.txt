# Veris, Wyman, Williams to lead changed defense

### DAVE DUTCHER 
As the 1983 Stanford football
campaign opens against the
second-ranked Oklahoma
Sooners today, there are facts
about the 1982 season that even
the most optimistic Cardinal
fans simply cannot avoid.
Some of these facts tell the
story of the Stanford defense: it
was last in the Pac-10 in both
passing and rushing defense as
well as total defense. While the
Cardinal offense tallied an aver
age 413.8 yards pergame in 1982,
the defense was surrendering
428.5 yards per opponent.
The rumbling about the secu
rity of Head Coach Paul Wiggin's
job, which began after Stan
ford's 25-20 Big Game loss to
UC-Berkeley last November, has
continued through the start of
this season. Many believe Wig
gin's 1983 squad must produce
better than the 5-6 record of last
year for Wiggin to retain the top
coaching position.
Thus, the head coach has
moved directly and drastically to
remedy the main problem: the
Cardinal defense. Wiggin is play
ing a more active role in coach
ing the defense, specifically the
defensive line and he is well
qualified in that area.
Wiggin, a defensive tackle
during his playing days on the
Farm, is one of 11 Stanford
players to achieve All-America
status twice during a career. In
the National Football League, he
earned Pro Bowl acclaim and
played on an NFL championship
team.
In addition to coaching the de
fensive front, Wiggin has
changed the Cardinal defense
from the 3-4 alignment to the
4-3.
Junior Carin Veris, an honor
able mention AII-Pac-10 choice
at outside linebacker last sea
son, is one reason Stanford
switched defense strategies.
The 6-foot-6, 250-pound Veris
will move up from outside
linebacker to start at left defen
sive end.
The 4-3 defense, which is bet
ter suited to stopping the run
than the 3-4, will enable the Car
dinal to take advantage of Veris'
pass rushing ability.
Veris, who Wiggin said is "in a
class by himself," led Stanford
with nine sacks last season.
"Last year we had some good
people up front," Veris said in a
recent interview, "but I think we
relied on our linebackers last
year. This year we have the
strong people up front to create
an aggressive type of team and
control the line of scrimmage,
and I think the coaches changed
the defense because of the
people we have on the front
line."
Those people include Mike
Wyman, a 6-6 senior who is battl
ing Pat Mitchel for the starting
left tackle position. Wyman, the

-1979 Nevada Player of the Year at
Reno's Wooster High School,
played well late last season and
during spring workouts.
On the right side of the defen
sive line, junior Dave Marohnic
is slated to start at tackle. Like
Wyman, Marohnic recorded 15
solo tackles last season.
Two-time academic All -
American John Bergren and fel
low senior Don Stubblefield are
listed one-two at defensive end.
Junior Terry Jackson started all
last year at noseguard and, like
most Cardinal defensive line
men, could see time at different
positions during the season.
The defensive line faces a
formidable challenge against the
Oklahoma offensive front,
which averages 267 pounds. This
fact does not worry Veris.
"They (the Oklahoma line
men) are really big. They're
going to be bigger than us
weight-wise," Veris acknowl
edged. "But I think physically
and aggressively we match up
well with them.
"As long as you've got the
physical capabilities and the ag
gressiveness you'll do fine, and I
think we'll do fine."
The huge Sooner line will try
to create running room for,
among others, Heisman Trophy
hopeful Marcus Dupree, who
will run out of an l-formation.
Dupree and the Sooners, ac
cording to Wiggin, run seven
times more than they pass.
"We have to stop their whole
offense," Veris said. "Marcus
Dupree is a great player (as is)

Danny Bradley, their quarter
back. We're not going to do any
tricks or anything like that.
We're just going to play basic
football and try to beat them."
Besides Veris' talent as a de
fensive lineman, another reason
Stanford switched to the 4-3
strategy was middle linebacker
Dave Wyman, sophomore
brother of senior tackle Mike
Wyman.
"Dave is a premier middle
linebacker," Wiggin said. "The
reason we decided to go to the
4-3 defense this fall is because
we have Dave Wyman on cam
pus."
Dave Wyman said the defense
is ready to rebound from its 1982
position at the bottom of the
Pac-10.
"We want to make a name for
ourselves on defense," he said.
"I think we're really excited
about trying to do that because
Stanford has always been known
as an offensive school. It should
be a good challenge.
"It was nice to have John Elway
but I think that we might have
relied too much on him and the
offense," Wyman continued.
"Now I think we realize we have
to do it on defense in order to
win."
On Dave Wyman's right side,
junior Matt Soderlund, who was
one of many Cardinal players
suffering hamstring problems
during fall practice, will start.

product, was Stanford's run-
