# Tailback Dupree: a blend of speed, power
## 
### JASON COLE 
In a little less than a year's time the name Marcus
Dupree has become a household word in college foot
ball.
After only his freshman season at the University of
Oklahoma, Dupree had his picture on the cover of
Sports Illustrated , was named as a pre-season Ail-
American candidate and is known as a serious candidate
for the Heisman Trophy.
Dupree is what many consider the quintessential run
ning back. His 6-foot-3 skeleton frames 230 bone
crushing pounds.
But even more important is his speed. During his
freshman season, Dupree put together a formidable
series of long distance touchdown runs in which he not
only ran over opponents but ran away from them. He's
been clocked at an impressive 4.35 seconds in the 40-
yard dash.
At a recent press conference, Stanford Head Coach
Paul Wiggin, who played nine seasons with NFL legend
Jim Brown on the Cleveland Browns, said, "Dupree re
minds of Jim Brown. Like Jim, if you give Marcus an
opening it's over. He's very exciting."
Dupree was one of the most sought after high school
athletes in the nation during his senior year. Out of
Philadelphia, Mississippi, he was generally regarded as
the No. 1 high school running back.
DuringhisfirstyearasaSooner, he proved his calling.
Dupree broke the Oklahoma record for rushing yards
by a freshman with 905. The record is particularly im
pressive because he gained only 20 yards in the first
three games of the season, and did not start until the
seventh.
Against lowa State Oklahoma's fourth opponent
last yearâ€”Dupree carried the ball 13 times for 62 yards.
For almost any other freshman, that performance
would be considered very good. For Marcus, it was just

the beginning. He ended up the season with four 100-
plus rushing games and 13 touchdowns.
Not only did his 13 touchdowns tie a Sooner freshman
record for both touchdowns and points scored, but the
way he scored them was amazing.
In each of Oklahoma's last seven games, Dupree
scored a touchdown from at least 30 yards out. In fact, six
of the seven touchdowns were from 60 yards or farther.
In almost storybook fashion, Dupree saved the best
for last and when it meant the most. Hislongest runof
the year came against archrival Nebraska in the final
regular season game, when he galloped for 86 yards and

a touchdown.
Then, in the Fiesta Bowl against Arizona State, Dupree
rushed for a phenomenal 239 yards, setting a bowl re
cord. His performance earned him the offensive player
of the game award. But, again, the Sooners lost 32-21.
In the Fiesta Bowl game, Dupree pulled a hamstring
which prevented an already impressive performance
from becoming an unbelievable one. The hamstring in
jury also caused Dupree to miss all of spring practice.
In spite of Dupree's amazing freshman year, all is not
well for the Sooner sophomore. An article in a June issue
of Sports Illustrated raised more than just eyebrows
when it talked of disagreement between Dupree and
Head Coach Barry Switzer.
Switzer downplays the disagreement, attributing it to
the unhappy nature of an 18-year-old freshman. He
claims that any person who is thrust into a new environ
ment with heavy demands is going to be unhappy.
The problems were compounded when Dupree failed
to show up for a fall practice session.
According to Oklahoma Sports Information Director
Mike Treps, a broken fuel pump was the cause of Dup
ree's absence, but the rumors roared on.
Reports indicated that Dupree was having a rocky
recovery from his hamstring pull and was also over
weight. In fact, they said Dupree was so out of shape that
slower teammates were catching him.
Responding to a question regarding Marcus' condi
tion at a recent press conference, Treps said, "Marcus is
fine. As good as ever."
At a news conference over the summer, Switzer was
asked if he thought that Marcus Dupree was the best
football player in America.
"No, I don't think you can say that about any 19-year
old who's only played oneyear of football. But, ifyou ask
me if I think Marcus Dupree has more talent than any
other college player, I'd have to say yes," he replied.
