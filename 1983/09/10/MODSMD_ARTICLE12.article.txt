# Sooner coach calls allegations untrue
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
When University of Oklahoma
coach Barry Switzer told Sports
Illustrated he had a problem, he
never thought that his words
would become the focus of a
Sports Illustrated cover story
about his stormy relationship
with star running back Marcus
Dupree. But last season was not
a typical one for Oklahoma
football or for the usually popu
lar coach.
After getting off to a 1-2 start
last year; Oklahoma fans and
alumni began to question
whether Switzer whose teams
have won two national champi
onships and finished out of the
top ten only once since 1973
could remain successful. One
editorial i n the Daily Oklahoman
even called for his resignation.
The media also began to look
into his profitable off-the-field
activities which some said hurt
his coaching. But the off-season
article in Sports Illustrated about
his relationship with Dupree
may have been the most damag
ing.
The article, which appeared
after the season, was written
from Dupree's point of view and
raised questions about the
player's ability and desire to per
form under Switzer.
Switzer says that the article
should never have been written.
He said he went to Sports Illus
trated and asked them not to run
an article promoting Dupree as a

Heisman Trophy candidate.
The Sooner coach said he did
not feel that Dupree had earned
that right, even though as a
freshman Dupree emerged as
one of the nation's best running
backs when Switzer changed his
offense from the wishbone to
the l-formation. Ironically, it was
largely due to Dupree's talent
that Oklahoma went on to win
seven straight games before los
ing to Nebraska, and then to
Arizona in the Fiesta Bowl.
"I was concerned about my
team," Switzer said at a Bay Area
press conference. "My final
words were, 'Help me, I have a
problem.' I asked them not to do
the article."
Dupree earned a reputation as
a poor practice player last year
and, said Switzer, Dupree was
out of shape and 20 pounds
overweight for the Fiesta Bowl.
Despite being out of shape, he
set a Fiesta Bowl rushing record
by gaining 239 yards.
"The reason that we had a
problem was that the best player
in America was a freshman,"
Switzer explains. "I doubt
whether many freshman are re
ally that happy, coming into a
new system and everything. I
wanted to help him play like he
is capable of, but he didn't like
constructive criticism. At the
same time, he (Dupree) knows
that today he is under tremen
dous pressure."
