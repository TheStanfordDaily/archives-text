# Card hoping for continued offensive success
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Without a doubt, Stanford's
1982 offense, anchored by five
eventual professional draft
choices, was a success.
The Cardinal led the Pac-10 in
passing offense with 301 yards
per game, while finishing sec
ond and third, respectively, in
total offense and scoring.
But the problem with such re
sults is that fifth-year offensive
coordinator Jim Fassel and his
players will be pressed for an
equally impressive showing this
year. The offense's test begins
today against second-ranked
powerhouse Oklahoma, which
has nine returning defensive
starters.
Predictably, Fassel does not
plan to tamper with the,offense's

successful pass-oriented for
mula despite greeting only four
returning starters when fall prac
tice began.
First-year starting quarterback
senior Steve Cottrell, who will
be scrutinized perhaps more
than any other Stanford player,
will direct the offense. Fassel be
lieves the offense will vary little
from last season when it was led
by former Cardinal and present
Denver Bronco John Elway.
"I don't think there will be any
dramatic changes," Fassel said
in a recent interview. "We may
throw the ball shorter some
times but that may not be as
much play design as Steve not
trying to throw the ball
downfield as much as John did."

While many Stanford follow
ers hold pleasant memories of
Elway's accomplishments, Fassel
found reason for optimism
about Elway's move to Denver
and the professional ranks. He
foresees this year's team as a
good one overall, as opposed to
one with a few outstanding indi
viduals.
"We're going to be more than
a name John Elway, (former
halfback) Vincent White,
(former tight end) Chris Dressel
or someone like that," Fassel
said. "We may not have a great
quarterback like John Elway, but
we're going to have an awfully
good one."
Cottrell, an engineering
major, saw limited action during
spring workouts, but re
established himself as the starter
in front of freshman John Paye
and junior Greg Topp during fall
practice.
Paye, who rejected football
scholarship offers from Notre
Dame and UCLA to accept Stan
ford's bid, was impressive in
practice and bypassed Topp, a
6-foot-4 economics major from
Flagstaff, Arizona, for the back
up job. Until Tuesday, when
Head Coach Paul Wiggin an
nounced Paye was the second
team quarterback and would not
be redshirted, Paye's fate was
not known.
"The decision (not to redshirt
Paye) was made based on pre
senting the best football team
we can present," Wiggin said at
a press conference Tuesday.
During his senior season, Paye
threw for 3388 yards and 37
touchdowns, both single
season state highs. The high
school star set another standard
by tossing eight scoring aerials

in a November game, and his
career pass completions are also
tops in the nation.
Behind Cottrell, a deep squad
of running backs will be relied
upon to improve Stanford's
ninth-place Pac-10finish in rush
ing offense. The Cardinal rolled
up 112.8 yards per game on the
ground, while rival UC-Berkeley
rushed for 73.1 yards per game.
Sophomore Kevin Scott will
fill the void left at halfback by the
departure of the Cardinal's third
all-time leading rusher, Vincent
White, now with the Denver
Gold of the United States Foot
ball League.
Scott, a 5-9 sophomore from
Puyallup, Washington, who red
shirted last season, has, accord
ing to Fassel, improved his
pass-catching an all
important feature of the Stan
ford multiple offense.
"At running back we're new
and pretty green," Fassel said,
"but Scott's looked very well.
He's really played well. He looks
pretty solid as the starter."
Junior Shaun Avant and
freshman Thomas Henley are
listed behind Scott for halfback
dutry. Henley and Scott will also
return kickoffs.
The Cardinal features more
experience at the fullback spot.

Fifth-year senior Rob Moore,
who shared time with 'B3
graduate Greg Hooper last sea
son, will start.
Kaulana Park, a 6-3 junior, is
listed behind Moore. Park, who
blocked well last season, will see
plenty of action.
Fassel, who notes sophomore
Brian Morris as another fullback
prospect, is pleased with the
depth at this position.

Marshall Dillard, a blue-chip
recruit from Bakersfield, is
ranked behind Moore and Park.
Dillard led California prep
rushers with over 2100 yards last
season. Dillard has "improved
every day," Fassel said.
The foundation of theoffense,
the line, is led by left tackle Jeff
Deaton and left guard Matt Mo
ran, both returning seniors.

GRINDING IT OUT: Stanford fullback Rob Moore runs through
the line for a big gain. Moore returns for his last year of eligibilityas the starting fullback after suffering a knee injury last season.
