# Senior starts at quarterback, Paye to play
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
After waiting patiently
through the John Elway quarter
backing era, senior Steve Cot
trell finally gets his chance to
start today against a highly
touted Oklahoma defense in
Stanford's season opener.
Despite the fact that Elway
now wears a Denver Bronco un
iform in the National Football
League, Cottrell still faces stiff
competition for the starting
signal-caller job. Freshman John
Paye and junior Greg Topp each
present a real challenge to Cot
trell.
Paye's exact status for this sea
son was not known until Tues
day when Cardinal Head Coach
Paul Wiggin announced that the
freshman is Cottrell's backup.
The Stanford coaching staff
had considered redshirting
Paye, but the former high schol
standout earned a spot on the
team ahead of Topp.
"Sunday night (offensive
coordinator) Jim Fassel, John
and myself talked about it and
we finalized our thinking Mon
day," Wiggin said, adding, "I
think he's going to be a great
player."
Cottrell believes Paye will be
nefit from being the backup
quarterback instead of saving a
year of eligibility by redshirting.
"John's a very good quarter
back who has a lot of talent,"
Cottrell said. "It will be a learn
ing experience for him. As the
backup quarterback he will learn
the game plans and study films
(of the opposition)."
Cottrell and other Cardinal
players say Stanford may have
relied too heavily on Elway's tal
ents last year and Elway's depar
ture, in that sense, has positive
effects on the team.
"Last year a lot of guys de
pended on John," Cottrell said.
"This year we're going to work
together more as a team . . .
"We termed our offense last
year an 'instant offense,' " Cot

trell continued. "While we were
on the field we had the capability
of scoring if we were on our own
20 (yard line). We could always
(pass) long and expect a big play.
This year we're hoping for that
too, but we'd like to establish a
real consistent offense . . . with
the idea that we want to be able
to make a first down every three
(plays) and make a touchdown
hopefully after three or four first
downs and not try to take it all
in one play two or three times in
a row and then punt."
Wiggin said Tuesday that the
Cardinal resembles a more
cohesive team than any team he
has seen: "I think everyone has
a recognition of their roles this
year."
Cottrell firmly established
himself as the starter during
pre-season workouts. A strong
fall was necessary for Cottrell,
who pitched for the Stanford
baseball team last spring and
thus saw limited action on the
football field.
With Cottrell on the baseball
diamond, Topp seized the op
portunity and performed well
during the spring. His play re
minded all who envisioned a
battle between heir apparent
Cottrell and Paye who many
considered the best prep quar
terback in the country last year
that there were three legiti
mate candidates for the starting
quarterback spot.
This fall, however, Topp was
unable to continue playing at the
level he maintained during the
spring. Paye, meanwhile, made
it known to all through his prac
tice performance that he was not
an automatic redshirt candidate,
and stayed with the team after
passing Topp on the depth
chart.
Cottrell's fall showing evi
dently earned him the starting
nod.
"Although he missed spring
football, he worked hard this
summer and maintained his po

sition (as the starter)," offensive
coordinator Fassel said. "He
came out at the beginning of the
season with the same type of
form he left last year."
Cottrell saw action in three
games last season, completing
three of nine passes for one
touchdown. The 5-foot-11 prod
uct of Northridge, California
played less during the 1982 sea
son than in 1981. It was that year,
his sophomore season, that Cot
trell hit 26 of 42 passes for two
touchdowns, including a
memorable performance
against Arizona State when he
completed 21 of 34 tosses for 311
yards.
Despite Cottrell's lack of play
ing time, Fassel foresees few
problems for the new starter.
"I think there will be some
things that will hurt him," Fassel
said, "but they will be minimal
because Steve has a lot of confi
dence in himself and he's been
in the game in pressure situa
tions and performed very well."
Topp has been on the field
numerous times during his
freshman and sophomore sea
sons as a punter. In 1981,
Topp punted 54 times for a 36.7-
yard average. Last year, how
ever, he booted the ball only 10
times before Tripp Hardin, then
a walk-on, won the punting
duties.
Topp probably will not punt
this season and, instead, will
concentrate his efforts on recap
turing the second or first
string quarterback position.
Six days before Wiggin an
nounced Paye's position behind
Cottrell, Fassel said the backup
quarterback position was "up in
the air between Paye and Topp."
He added that during the fall,
Topp "had his rough moments."
Despite his slow start, Topp is
optimistic.
"When practice started, I
thotight Steve and I were
number ones," Topp said in an
