# Football hero to leave Farm after 45 years

"Twinkletoes? Hell, I run
more like a duck!"
It may not sound much like
the stuff heroes are made of, but

the man behind this quote is a
figure firmly etched in the minds
of every Stanford football fan old
enough to see or avid enough
to study the 1940 Stanford

team which became famous as
the *'Wow Boys."
Familiar names are not dif
ficult to find on that Rose Bowl
championship team, which
managed to turn collegiate foot
ball topsy-turvy by pressing the
obsolete T-forrrration back into
service. Under Head Coach
Clark Shaughnessy, the 1940
team .recorded an undefeated
record, including a 21-13 victory
over Nebraska in the Rose Bowl.
Ask any fan what the most
memorable play of that thrilling
Rose Bowl victory was, and the
answer will be an assured one. It
was a 39-yard touchdown run on
a reverse field punt return by
none other than old Twinkletoes
himself, Pete Kmetovic, which
clinched the game for the Wow
Boys.
Kmetovic went on to become
the most valuable player of the
1941 Rose Bowl as well as an al
most permanent fixture in the
Athletic Department administra
tion until his retirement early
this month. In fact, except for a
brief hiatus in professional foot
ball and the Navy, Kmetovic has
been associated with Stanford
ever since he enrolled in 1938.
A local product, Kmetovic
grew up in San Jose, where he
starred on the San Jose High
School football and track teams.
Kmetovic was the top running
back on that San Jose team, spe
cializing in long puntreturns. He
carried on that tradition as a
member of the 1940 Stanford
squad.

"Pete was a clutch per
former," said Chuck Taylor,
Kmetovic's teammate at San Jose
High School and Stanford,
where Taylor was head coach
from 1951 to 1957.
"He always came through
when a key performance was
needed. He was just devastating
out on the flanks were he could
zig and zag for all kinds of yar
dage."
Against San Francisco in the
1940 season opener, Kmetovic
scored on a 60-yard punt return.
At USC, he turned in a 61-yard
touchdown run, and in the con
ference championship against
Washington, he scored on a 56-
yard interception return.
And then there was the Rose
Bowl.
To many, Kmetovic's punt re
turn seemed an almost unbe
lievable run. He began the play
by taking four or five steps to his
left before abruptly reversing his
field, doubling back to the 45-
yard line and picking up the re
maining blockers as he took off
downfield. With superb block
ing from quarterback Frankie
Albert and the rest of the team,
Kmetovic was able to clinch the
game for Stanford.
Final statistics show that
Kmetovic carried 14timesfor141
yards.
After receiving his bachelor of
arts in 1942, Kmetovic served
three years in the Navy during
the heyday of World War 11.
From there, he returned to

play professional football for the
Philadelphia Eagles in 1946 and
for Detroit in 1947. The next
year, he assumed the head
coaching role at San Bernardino
Valley College and, in 1949, he
moved on to an assistant coach
ing spot at the University of San
Francisco.
Finally, in 1950, Kmetovic re
turned to the Farm as an assis
tant to then-Head Coach Mar
chie Schwartz.
During his stint as assistant
coach, Kmetovic helped de
velop backs like Gary Kerkorian,
Bob Mathias, Bob Garrett, Bill
Tarr, John Brodie and defensive
tackle Paul Wiggin.
''l've had the privilege of
being associated with Pete not
only as a friend and adminis
trator, but also as a coach during
the four years that I played foot
ball for Stanford," Wiggin said.
"The coaches I played under
at Stanford had a great deal to do
with shaping my character, not
only as a football player, but also
as a person. I feel very fortunate
to have had Pete as a part of my
life."
Kmetovic was an assistant
until 1962, when he became op
erations manager for the Athle
tic Department. He also served
as head rugby coach for a
number of years r during which
time Stanford took several Mon
terey Tournament titles, then
the equivalent of a national
championship.
All in all, Kmetovic spent 33


END OF AN ERA: Pete
Kmetovic, former Stanford
football hero and long-time employee
of the Athletic Department,
retires this month after
many years of service to the
University. Kmetovic is the honorary
captain of the Cardinal for
today's game against Oklahoma.

years of his life working for the
Athletic Department, gaining
the respect and admiration of
everyone he worked with.
"Kmetovic has always been a
tremendous person to work
with, for everyone from staff
members to the numerous
athletes with whom he has de
alt," said Frank Cardoza, who
has worked on the grounds and
maintenance crew almost as
long as Kmetovic has been in the

athletic department.
A soft-spoken man who shies
away from recognition,
Kmetovic has dedicated his life
to helping Stanford athletes ac
complish as much as they could
with their talents, while shaping
their personalities through con
stant encouragement.
Recently, some of Kmetovic's"
former rugby players paid him
this tribute: "Those of us here
tonight speak for the hundreds
of ruggers who played under
Pete. We all share a deep ap
preciation for Pete as our coach;
but, above all, we thank Pete for
caring about us as individuals."

Athletic Director Andy Ceiger
said, "I have been extremely
lucky to have had the opportu
nity to know and work with Pete
Kmetovic. He is a valued friend
and an excellent member of our
staff.
"Loyalty and integrity de
scribe his performance per
fectly. We honor him proudly
and will miss his presence in our
daily lives."
And, by the way, Oklahoma
better be careful that old
Twinkletoes, today's honorary
game captain, hasn't taught this
year's Stanford team any of his
heroic tactics.
