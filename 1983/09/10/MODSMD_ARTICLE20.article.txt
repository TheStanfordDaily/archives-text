The following is the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band's written version
of their program for today's
game:
After gaining notoriety during
a particular football game at the
end of last season, the trombone
section of the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
(LSJUMB) wants to let the audi
ence know even trombones can
take only so much trouncing.
In today's pre-game show, the
Band will put its 'bone section
through the Foamy Shaving
Cream strength test.
Can this formidable section
halt a runaway Dolly roller coas
ter car as it careens "Down to the
Bone?!" SPLAT! Well, maybe
not.
Can these stalwart musicians
stop a speeding bullet?! BLAM!
"There Ain't nothin' " stopping
this bullet.
Evidently the trombones' true
strength and virility can be dem
onstrated in only one way. The
Band looks on in admiration as
these brutish 'bones disem
bowel a football player from
across the Bay as punishment for
his team's "Evil Ways."
The Axe returns to Stanford (at
least in effigy) as the LSJUMB in
vites the audience to "Come
Join the Band."
During halftime, the Band
seeks to reveal the inner work
ings of its (disorganization, with
a tribute to the Band's summer
mail. Correspondence received
by the Band often takes a some
what "Roundabout" path, usu
ally being answered sometime
within four months.
Much of this summer's mail
has suggested that the LSJUMB
improve its athletic prowess in
order to avoid a repeat of the
end of the infamous football
game of last fall. Thus, the Band
concluded it was "Born to Run"
the 40-yard dash.
Some alumni mail has con
tained threats that contributions
could drastically decrease from
dollars to cents unless the Band
"Changes" to a more traditional
(or militaristic) style.
