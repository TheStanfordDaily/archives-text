# Cardinal seeks repeat of 1980 upset win
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
There will be a lot of red at
Stanford Stadium today, and not
all of it will be from Oklahoma
crimson and Stanford cardinal
uniforms. Some of it will come
from the red faces of Oklahoma
players seeking revenge.
The Oklahoma Sooners, the
nation's second-ranked team,
make their second visit to the
Farm mindful of what occurred
the last time they faced the Car
dinal.
Oklahoma, then ranked
fourth in the country, welcomed
an inhospitable Stanford team to
their field at Norman on Sept.
27, 1980. The Cardinal wore out
its welcome by racing out to a
31-0 lead before embarrassing
the Sooners 31-14 and dashing
Oklahoman hopes for a national
championship.
In the game, then-sophomore
John Elway demonstrated, in
Oklahoma Coach Barry
Switzer's view, "the greatest ex
hibition of quarterback play I
have ever seen on this field."
Elway, now the starting quar
terback for the National Football
League's Denver Bronco, tossed
three touchdown passes and
scored one himself to pace the
upset.
Today the Sooners make the
visit, only their second season
opener on the road since 1978
when they defeated the Cardinal
35-29. Oklahoma, like Stanford
with Elway in 1980, brings a
sophomore sensation.
Marcus Dupree, whose
weight and alleged problems
with Switzer have made as much
news as his field achievements,

is a Heisman Trophy candidate
and the main cog in the Okla
homa offensive machine. Dup
ree, who set a Fiesta Bowl rush
ing record with 239 yards in a
32-21 loss to Arizona State Jan. 1,
is one of seven returning offen
sive starters for the Sooners.
Cardinal Head Coach Paul
Wiggin, who likened Dupree to
a number of great running
backs, is impressed with Dup
ree's strength as well as his
speed.
"As a tackier, you cannot
bring Dupree down with your
arms," Wiggin, a former defen
sive end, said. "You've got to
put your numbers on his."
Junior Danny Bradley will di
rect the Sooner offense. Brad
ley, recruited as a wishbone
quarterback, enables Oklahoma
to revert to the 'bone if the
l-formation attack falters-
The key to the Sooners' suc
cess, according to Bradley, is
execution.
"We have to execute well and
not have any busts," the Pine
Bluff, Arkansas product said. "If
we keep our poise and read the
defenses well, we should be
able to move the ball."
Spencer Tillman, who red
shirted last year, will open at
fullback. Tillman and Dupree
will run behind the blocks of a
large offensive line. Starting
tackles Brent Burks and Sidney
Dodd return while guard Paul
Parker and center Chuck
Thomas combine with freshman
guard Eric Pope to form the nu
cleus of the Oklahoma ground
attack.
Oklahoma switched last sea

son from its traditional
wishbone offense to the
l-formation to better use the tal
ents of Dupree, an excellent
cutback runner with explosive
acceleration.
The Cardinal coaching staff
knows firsthand about changing
philosophies to take advantage
of personnel.
Stanford, in an attempt to
shore up a defense which
finished last in the Pac-10 in total
defense, rushing defense and
pass defense, now will employ
the 4-3 alignment.

The Cardinal, essentially,
moved junior Garin Veris from
outside linebacker to defensive
end and thus moved out of the
3-4 defense. Veris, a 6-foot-6
honorable mention AII-Pac-10
choice last year, led Stanford in
sacks in 1982.
Another key to the Cardinal
defense is middle linebacker
Dave Wyman, whose brother
Mike will see considerable time
at defensive tackle.

Dave Wyman, a sophomore,
combines speed and strength at
the heart of the 4-3 defense. He
and the rest of the Stanford de
fense will be concerned primar
ily with the Oklahoma running
attack because over 80 percent
of the Sooners' plays are of the
running type.
Senior strong safety Vaughn
Williams will be counted upon
to lead the secondary, which is
composed of four of the nine re
turning defensive starters. Wil
liams, an All-America candidate,
led the Card last year with 94
tackles. Fifth-year senior Kevin
Baird, who started the 1980 game
against the Sooners, is at left
cornerback.
While Veris, Dave Wyman and
Williams play major roles in the
fate of the Cardinal defense,
All-Big-Eight selection Rick
Bryan leads the Sooner stop
squad. Bryan, a tackle, is one of
nine returning starters in the
Oklahoma 5-2 alignment.
Fellow all-conference pick
Jackie Shipp anchors the
linebackers and Keith Stanberry,
whom Switzer called "the best
strong safety in the Big Eight,"
roves the secondary. Senior
standout Scott Case opens at
free safety.
Senior Steve Cottrell will look
to find the magic Elway found in
Norman as he opens at quarter
back for the Cardinal. Cottrell,
who established himself as the
starter over freshman sensation
John Paye and junior Greg Topp
this fall, will see an Oklahoma
defense intent on stopping the
Cardinal air attack with an ag
gressive pass rush.

"We have to rush the passer
about 40 or 50 times and keep
the pressure on him," Bryan
said.
Cottrell will be looking over
the Sooner pass rush for, among
others, All-America candidate
Emile Harry. Harry, a junior split
end, led Stanford in receiving
yards and yards per catch last
year. Harry is only one of a tal
ented receiving crew. Mike Tol
liver and Eric Mullins provide
depth at the flanker position
while Greg Baty and Jim Clymer
will handle tight end respon
sibilities.
Fifth-year senior Rob Moore is
one of four returning offensive
starters. Moore will share the
Cardinal backfield with sopho
more Kevin Scott, a threat on the
ground as well as in the pass pat
terns.
Up front, Jeff Deaton and Matt
Moran return to man the left
side. An improved Brent Martin
will snap the ball, while Tom
Prukop and Scott Carpenter
clear the way on the right side.
As evidenced by Oklahoma's
seven turnovers against Stan
ford in 1980, ball-control is vital
for both offenses. Either offense
can make the scoreboard light
up quickly if helped by key turn
overs.
Oklahoma, which as prepared
for the game amidst reminders
of the 1980 loss to the Cardinal,
has hopes of revenge and a pos
sible national title working to
motivate it. The Sooners would
like nothing more than to pay a
long outstanding debt by put
ting the red onto the Stanford
players' faces with a big win.
