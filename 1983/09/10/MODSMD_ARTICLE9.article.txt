# Coach Wiggin: We have to be consistent
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Today's Oklahoma-Stanford
game represents the start of Paul
Wiggin's fourth year as head
coach of the Cardinal. Wiggin, a
1957 Stanford graduate, owns a
three-year record of 16-17. He
was a three-year starter at offen
sive and defensive tackle and re
ceived All-America honors in
1955 and 1956, one of 11 Stanford
players to earn All-America
status twice in a career. The 48-
year-old Modesto, California na
tive also had an 11-season stint
with the Cleveland Browns, and
held three coaching jobs in the
professional ranks before com
ing to Stanford. The following is
an interview with the Cardinal's
27th coach.

CT: How do you feel about
playing a powerful team like
Oklahoma this early in the sea
son?
Wiggin: First of all, for me to
say I don't want to do it would
sound as if I'm not accepting the
challenge. I would guess if you
were to ask everyone in America
that coaches football who they'd
like their opener to be against
just write it down on a piece of
paper and put it on a ballot I
don't think many of them would
put Oklahoma down. But one
thing about it is that we'll sure
find out who we are and what we
are pretty early. This is the only
option team that we'll be facing
all year and it creates some spe
cial problems for us. We have to
do some unique things that re
late to our defense. But, again,
we'll find out a lot about our
football team from a character
standpoint when this is all said
and done.

CT: Explain all the details con
cerning the decision not to red
shirt John Paye.
Wiggin: Very quickly, it's our
obligation as a staff and particu
larly me as a football coach to
present the best football team I
can. I think we're a better foot
ball team with John Paye and
that's the reason for it. Redshirt
ing, I think, is something that
you give consideration to in the
long range of things, and I think
when you look at all the things
that relate to John Paye's situa
tion everything and you
consider how great he's going to
be, I think in his best interests
and in our best interests that this

was the best decision.
CT: Many people have picked
Stanford to finish low in the
Pac-10. What do you think of
your team's chances against the
rest of the league, and what has
to be done in order to improve
on last year's (5-6 overall) finish?
Wiggin: Well, we can't go to
last year because it's a different
team, different times and
different circumstances. But I
think our team is better than
people say, and I think our
players believe that they're bet
ter than that. I don't think the
fact that we believe that is going
to change anyone's opinion
as educated as some of those

opinions can be. I'm proud of
this team and I would be proud
to take them into any kind of
competition, including Okla
homa, and you can't predict.
You don't know where it's going
to fall because we have a very
tough schedule. But I feel good
about our football team and I
think that when it's all said and
done, whatever happens, that
people will be proud of this par
ticular group of kids.
CT: What are your im
pressions of Marcus Dupree and
of Oklahoma as a whole?
Wiggin: They're a great foot
ball team. They believe that they
have their best team since 1975,

and maybe better than that
team, which was the national
champion. Who am I to say? We
see them on film from a year
ago. They've got seven starters
on offense and nine really, if
you look at it, 10 starters on
defense returning, which means
the people they had a year ago
are a year older and a year bet
ter. It's a great football team a
team that got national ranking. I
think it's a great football team.
They've got some great players
particularly Marcus Dupree.
He's an awesome football
player; he's one of those rare
great players.
CT: After a season with Heis
man Trophy candidate John El
way, who finished runnerup in
the Heisman voting (to Geor
gia's Herschel Walker), you face
another in Dupree. What do you
think of his chance of winning
the Heisman Trophy?
Wiggin: If he can stay healthy,
which has been a little bit of a
problem with him he's 100
percent healthy now he's got
an excellent chance. He's a great
player one of the most explo
sive, accelerating players I've
ever=seen.
CT: What are the main things
Stanford has to do and the main
things it has to avoid in order to
win?
Wiggin: We're going to have to
deal with option football. That's
number one. That's new and
unusual for us. Oklahoma's the
only option team we'll play all
year and we've had to put to
gether some special parts re
lated to our defense to deal with
that and it'll be interesting to see
how well we hold up. But that is




HIGHS AND LOWS: Stanford Head Coach Paul Wiggin has to bear the ups and downs of winning
and losing. Wiggin endures (upper left) the agony of a disappointing performance one week and
celebrates (right) the joys of a great win the next. Finally, he watches (lower left) with anticipation
as his players prepare for the upcoming season.

really a key: our ability to main
tain the discipline of our defense
for four quarters. We have to
maintain a level of consistent
play as well because manpower
wise they're bigger than we are,
and we're going to have to deal
with that on both sides of the
line. We're going to have to
maintain a belief in what we're
doing on both sides of the foot
ball as we go along because
chances are that we're going to

have to just find our niches as
the game unfolds and not get
frustrated at all about periods or
blocks of time where we aren't
as productive as we'd like to
be. . . . There are a lot of factors
that enter into it, but it's going to
be a game where execution is
goingto be of paramount impor
tance and that's true in every
game. Belief is going to have to
really be important and I like the
attitude our football team had
when we played Oklahoma
(31-14 Stanford win in 1980) and
I'm just hoping that we go into
this game with the same mental
attitude.
