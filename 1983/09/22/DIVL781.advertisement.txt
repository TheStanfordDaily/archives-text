A BRIEF DISCOURSE
ON THE CULTURAL
SIGNIFICANCE OF WBS.
THE HISTORY
For as long as man has consumed
meat, he has consumed ribs. Since
hunting was no easy chore, a rib in
the cave was worth a sirloin on the
hoof. In time, people began to love
ribs for their own sake. Ribs tasted
good; they were fun to eat. So, even as
animals were domesticated, and it
became easier to get larger, unbony
smoke. Then, the
ribs are lightly
basted and fin
ished off over the
mesquite broiler.

A BRIEF DISCOURSE
ON THE CULTURAL
SIGNIFICANCE OF WBS.
THE HISTORY
For as long as man has consumed
meat, he has consumed ribs. Since
hunting was no easy chore, a rib in
the cave was worth a sirloin on the
hoof. In time, people began to love
ribs for their own sake. Ribs tasted
good; they were fun to eat. So, even as
animals were domesticated, and it
became easier to get larger, unbony
smoke. Then, the
ribs are lightly
basted and fin
ished off over the
mesquite broiler.
Diagrami The ribs reach
you savory, smoky and sizzling.
THE RIB IN ART
It has recently been established
by archaeologists and art historians 1
A. Meat: Lean and juicy.
B. Sauce: It is rumored that the recipe is descended
/ from that consumed at the Satyricon.
C. Bone: Before there were knives and \
forks, hones were the only graceful p> Flavor: The mesquite charcoal flavor B. || 1

than by sight. (Cross section)
The lack of ribs in literature
was most recently discussed by Brent
in her paper on Barbara Pym? In
the entire body of Pym's work, there
is no mention of ribs because, Brent
contends, ribs connote an embrace
jjSj&L of life too lusty to
be delineated by any

cuts of meat, ribs never entirely fell
out of favor.
Then, with the age of special
ization, the Science and Politics of
ribs developed. Divisions among rib
lovers emerged. Choice of meat and
method of preparation forced people
into narrow special interest groups.
Now, however, in this Rib-
Enlightened Age, serious scholars
concur that ribs are best when
smoked, as they are at Mac Arthur
Park (see fig. 1).
THE ART IN RIBS
Mac Arthur Park has brought
rib preparation out of the Dark Ages.
