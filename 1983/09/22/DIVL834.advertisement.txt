Save a bike
Lock it with CITADEL
A lock that really stops the bicycle thief and
guarantees your bicycle up to $350.00!
Impossible? Not if it's a CITADEL lock!
Stops the tools used by thieves!
The CITADEL is an entirely new concept in
bike locks. Its thru-hardened Molychrome™
alloy means boltcutters can't dent it; hacksaws
can't cut it. Hammers, prybars, and drills are
just as useless.
The CITADEL'S high security round key
cylinder has over 700,000 possible key com
binations. The exclusive cylinder Drill Guard™
thwarts drilling attacks. Security features like
these are the reason why CITADEL is recom
mended by more police departments than any
other bike 4ock.
Warranty pays up to $350
The security of the CITADEL is backed up
by a unique one year warranty. If your bicycle is
stolen due to the failure of the lock to prevent
the theft, we'll pay you the value of your bike
up to $350.*
Secures your bike easily
The compact shape of the CITADEL makes it
easy to use. It unlocks in two separate pieces
to secure your bike quickly to a bike stand or
other stationary object. And, its durable vinyl
coating protects your bike's finish. An optional
storage bracket is available for carrying the
CITADEL when it's not in use.
