"Human life at all times needs to be nourished by the dimension of experience called
'spiritual.' Our need for friendship based on caring and mutual trust, for a sense of
significance in our life and work, is always pressing. Many who seek meaning in wealth,
technological achievement and professional standing are lonely and empty.
The Church in the University addresses its message to this experience of spiritual need. It
argues that there is a solid satisfaction and a rest for the restless heart —in God, who may
be trusted and should be worshipped. The Church contends that a recovery of this
relationship with God is the one sure remedy for the boredom and emptiness of our
times, the strongest base for developing integrated individual identity and caring human
community."
- Robert Hamerton-Kelly, Dean
