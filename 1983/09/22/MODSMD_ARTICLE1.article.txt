# The
						student health survey
## How you feel, what you do and what you want

"Do you have any idea how bad
Cowell's reputation is on campus?"
The question was put to me reluc
tantly but forcefully by a student two
years ago. I didn't think our reputation
was that bad, but I didn't know how
good it was, either.
In the spring of 1980, we had con
ducted a "user survey," a question
naire filled out by students on their
way out of Cowell. The results were
very positive, but we still wondered
how many students were not even
coming to Cowell because of its
"terrible reputation." Traditionally,
the food service and the health service
are whipping boys on any campus, but
did we really deserve the brickbats?
The last survey, done jointly by
Cowell and the Dean of Student Affairs
Office, had been in 1979 before the on
set of our Health Promotion Program.
At that time, 80 percent of those polled
were either "very satisfied" or
"generally satisfied" with their medi
cal treatment at Cowell. However,
since then there has been a steady

decline in the total number of students
using Cowell, a trend reflected on col
lege campuses nationwide.
We wanted to know more about this
drop in the number of patients we saw
at Cowell. We weren't sure whether it
was because students were truly more
healthy, whether they were seeking
care elsewhere because of Cowell's
"awful" reputation, or most opti
mistically whether our Health
Promotion Program was teaching stu
dents to "take care of themselves" so
well that they didn't need to see us.
So we planned another survey. This
survey was conducted not only to try
to answer these questions, but also to
plan further health promotion and
health care efforts. Who used Cowell,
who needed to use Cowell, and in what
aspects of health care were students
most interested?
In the spring of 1983, 1000 question
naires were sent to a randomly
selected group of students, 500 under
graduates and 500 graduate students.
The response rate was 57.7 percent,
and the students in the survey sample
almost exactly parralleled the general

Stanford student population in impor
tant demographic characteristics.
Although analysis of the survey is
still ongoing, we are sharing a number
of the results with you in this issue of
The Student Body. Our hope is that
you, the students, will be interested in
not only what you think of Cowell, but
also what you think of yourselves.
The average respondent was a white
single American male, who lives with
a roommate and visits Cowell one to
three time per year. He is s'lo 1/2" tall
and weighs 158 pounds. He does not
smoke, drinks moderately, but does
not use other drugs. He exercises regu
larly, wears a seatbelt (but doesn't wear
a bike helmet), and always uses some
form of contraception (these latter ac
tivities are presumably not performed
simultaneously!). Not very surprising
results just look around you.
What were interesting, however,
were the sub-populations we found
and how they clustered. Eighty percent
of those seen as Cowell rated their care
by doctors as "good" or "excellent."
A full third of the students surveyed

had gone elsewhere for care, but most
went for servics which they thought
were not available at Cowell dental
services, dermatology, orthopedics
and opthamaology although most of
those services are indeed available at
or through Cowell. This result is under
careful study as Cowell's new director
considers the expansion of Cowell's
services. Students expressed definite
interest in having both dental services
and a pharmacy at Cowell.
A third of the students had never
heard of Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), and another 45 per
cent knew of it only vaguely. Most stu
dents had not had therapy either at
CAPS or elsewhere and were not
aware that they had ever been invovled
in CAPS programs. But since the pro
grams are quite diverse and usually
well-attended, it seems likely that
many students had been touched by
CAPS without ever knowing it.
Finally, 81 percent had read The
Student Body! 88.5 percent of those
found it interesting and 92 percent
found it informative. This will not be
the last issue!
