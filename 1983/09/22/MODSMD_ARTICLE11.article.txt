# Bay Area Nightclubbing: video discos, sweaty bars and new wave bowling alleys
## 
### 
Newark has discos. Cleve
land has discos. Omaha has
discos. Even Marriot's Great
America has discos.
Houston has a stadium cap
able of accomodating Led
Zeppelin. Seattle has a really
big stadium and they put really
big (and trashy and mindless)
acts like Aerosmith in there.
Los Angeles has two stadiums
capable of accomodating
Aerosmith if you count
Anaheim (the Rams did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied qual
ity. Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, if you look long
73 ough even the most
branch office of all branch of
fice metropoli go to pains to
see that this is true. Quality of
performance aside, it just goes
to show that it was a mistake to
leave Kansas in the first place.
Maybe out there you can't gel
what you want, but you can get
what you need, so to speak.
Everything except night
clubs, that is. San Francisco's
nightclubs, even more than
Herb Caen and the Zodiac Kil
ler, distinguish this city from
every inhabited community
outside New York State lines.
The City has more nightclubs
than LA, for instance, which
holds somewhere near eight
times as many inhabitants, and
it offers more variety than LA,
for example, which holds eight
times as many human beings.
Of course it is very hard to

find one's way around when
one doesn't always know
where to go. It isn't always
good to have a billion zillion
nightclubs if your orientation
issue doesn't at least include a
guide to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo
Alto is the club most folks
know about. It's not the
cheapest club,, or the biggest,
or the friendliest, or the one
with the best sound (Lord,
no!). But it is close , and that
means a lot to a mostly
bicycle-bound audience justi
fiably uneasy about traversing
the wilds of San Mateo on a
stray Samtrans 7F or facing the
Tenderloin district without an
easy escape route.
But location doth not a
nightclub make, and the Keys
tone is not a nightclub, so
don't let anyone tell you diffe
rently. A nightclub has enter
tainment, but also gives you an
atmosphere and a chance to
converse. The Keystone Palo
Alto does not exactly fail in
these goals; rather, it blatantly
refuses to attempt reaching
them.
Consequently, the selection
of bands is like that of a small
concert arena country
bumpkins one night, mul
tigenarian blues/jazz artists the
next, rapid and rabid lobotomy
rock the next (of both the
heavy metal and punk var
ieties). For the latter be espe
cially forewarned, for Palo Alto
punk rockers are a singularly
ridiculous bunch. Despite the

kids with skinny ties borrowed
from their fathers and the
lineups of family Buicks out
side the Keystone dropping off
Skip and Cindy for Punk Nite
Out, the dancing inside can
often resemble a cross bet
ween leapfrog and Rollerball.
If you beware the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always
a good guess in the spontane
ous "let's go to a show" rallies
common in dorms around the
end of a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you
enjoy the hazards and want to
go out of your way to create
them, then the Mabuhay Gar
dens is waiting for you with
open safety pins. Five or six
years after the fact, punk music
seems to have settled its feud
with (and acknowledged its
debt to) heavy metal. Perhaps
in deference to this newly dis
covered patrimony (or perhaps
to the sacred cash cow of the
concertgoing public), punk
clubs often have "metal
nights" and everyday audi
ences definitely have more of
an axle-grease aura around
them these days. Which is ac
tually perfect for the Mabuhay
Gardens. While the Keystone
acts like a small arena, the Fab
Mab is more like a slightly
oversize garage, with brick
walls and a self-consciously
dangerous air about it. The
bands have the best names in
the Bay Area, though certainly
not the tonal quality. Still thriv
ing as a Polynesian restaurant
by day/leatherette cave by

night, the club is best for those
who understand the colossal
joke taking place six or seven
nights a week. That's enter
tainment.
Roosting at the mouth of
Broadway, the Fab Mab also
serves as an introduction to the
North Beach area of the city,
where most of the real night
clubs (i.e., the ones that adver
tise) reside. Right across the
street from the Mab is The
Stone, owned by the same folks
who dispense entertainment at
the Keystone Palo Alto and the
Keystone Berkeley. The Stone
is sort of a hybrid; it has the
physical qualities of its im
mediate neighbor but the
music selection of the Keys
tone,. a decidedly pop flavor
(they often share bands, stag
ing the same show at each
'Stone of successive nights).
If you go down Broadway a
few blocks (negotiating your
way past the massage parlors
and Carol Doda) and turn onto

Columbus, you'll eventually
pass Wolfgang's, the physical
succesor to the Boarding House
(901 Columbus) and the
spiritual heir to the Old Wal
dorf as Bill Graham's Home for
Acts That Can't Sell Out the
Coliseum. Amazingly enough,
few of the many sins of the
father are visited upon the
latest offspring; the sound is
decent, the stage and lighting
very good, and there's even a
balcony for those who really
don't go to clubs to see the
band. The only caveats to the
clubber are well-known to
Waldorf denizens: beware the
chairs (bicycle seats with legs),
the drink minimum (the "Calis
toga with Orange Flavor"
tastes like it should have "A
gent" in there somewhere) and
the food (Chicken Lollipops?
McPutrid.)
Better chairs and bigger
shows can be found at the

other Graham venue, the
Kabuki Nightclub at the Japan
Center near Geary Street. Lo
cated significantly west of
North Beach, the Kabuki
nonetheless has even more
traditional nightclub aesthe
tics; it's big and flashy, like the
nightclubs in 1930s musicals,
with lots of tables for the
Nicholas Brothers to dance ac
ross. It's a little bit odd to see
Greg Kihn play in a place that
should have Billie Holliday, but
it's still a roomy, nice club. The
videos in the lobby help as
well, as does the Japantown
Bowling Alley across the street
(open till 4 a.m. Wednesdays
and Thursdays and 24 hours on
weekends).
If you accept the above three
elements music, rock video,
and bowling as a sort of a
holy trinity of night-on-the

town experiences, then the
Park Bowl on Haight Street was
designed with you in mind. Lo
cated a couple of blocks away
from the l-Beam, one of the
more elaborate dance clubs on
the scene (forget the bands
the stage is a show in itself), the
Park Bowl is your basic, well
mannered, direct-from-
Muncie, Indiana, bowling alley
during the week. But on Friday
and Saturday nights, the lights
go down, the volume goes up,
and a 12-foot-video screen de
scends and hovers over the
center lanes. It, and satellite TV
sets around the alley, show
rock videos and the like while
the paying customers ($6 cover
charge for entrance and about
two hours of tenpinning) take
