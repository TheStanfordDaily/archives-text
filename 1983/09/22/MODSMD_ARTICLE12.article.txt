# Rating the area's moviehouses
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Stanford is something of a
movie buff's paradise. At the
best of times, there are seven
or eight film series operating
simultaneously on campus, as
well as a colorful selection of
revivals at the two downtown
revival houses, the New Varsity
and the Festival, and first-run
foreign and domestic pictures
on 15 screens in eight local
theaters. Newly arrived movie
addicts will find their needs
tended to in the following loca
tions.
ON CAMPUS
ASSU Sunday Flicks: This is the
most popular film series on
campus not because it is as
sembled with especially good
taste, but because it includes
very recent releases and pro
vides a party-like atmosphere
akin to that of midnight screen
ings of The Rocky Horror Pic
ture Show. Most people have a
great time, though those who
prefer to see the screen behind
the barrage of paper planes
and hear the soundtrack over
the gleefully improvised com
mentary may seek elsewhere.
Among last year's films were
Reds, An Officer and a Gent
leman and Diner. Because the
Sunday Flicks draw such a large
crowd, they screen twice in
Memorial Auditorium (on
Sunday evenings, of course).
Stanford Film Society: Though
this series is run by a small, de
dicated group of under
graduates, it is drawn up in

connection with the Film
Aesthetics and Film History
courses given in the Com
munications Department in
the fall and the winter, respec
tively. (Occasionally there will
be a spring series as well, but
that is rare.) Attendance is
compulsory for students enrol
led in these courses, but the
movies a highly varied mix
ture of American and foreign
films, silents and talkies are
open to everyone. These pic
tures are almost always terrific.
They screen Monday evenings
in Kresge Auditorium.
German Film Series: Sponsored
by Haus Mitteleuropa, where
they are shown, these movies
cover a wide spectrum of Ger
man film. Classics like M and
Metropolis often pop up, as
well as examples of contem
porary German cinema and re
latively obscure entries like the
film of Faust starring Gustav
Grundgens, the actor on
whose story last year's
Mephisto was based. Thursday
evenings.
Law School Film Society: Like
the publicity surrounding this
series, the choice of movies
varies greatly according to who
is in charge of it from term to
term. It's generally an agree
able, nostalgic collection of
Hollywood classics like Little
Women, The Big Sleep and
Roman Holiday , and it draws
affectionate, fairly quiet audi
ences. Friday nights in Kresge
Auditorium.

Great Directors Film Series: The
most esoteric movies in town
this is a series for diehard
cinephiles. Again, the selec
tion depends on the tastes of
the two or three people who
operate it, but the emphasis is
generally placed on foreign
films, particularly by highly ex
perimental directors whose
work would be unlikely to turn
up even in most revival theat
ers. This year, however, the list
will include movies by Sergei
Eisenstein and Francis Ford
Coppola. The films will be
shown free of charge Tuesday
evenings in Terman Au
ditorium this fall.
Chaparral Film Series: The
Chaparral supports itself
largely through these movies,
so the list always includes a
number of sure-fire successes
(Woody Allen, Monty Python,
and james Bond movies, for
example). And it emphasizes
comedy, because that, after all,
is the ChapparaT s business.
Because of the balance bet
ween recent and older re
leases, the selection of films is
usually fairly decent, and it in
cludes a few really pleasant
surprises (like last year's Used
Cars). Saturday evenings in
Kresge Auditorium.
Others: As well, Casa Italiana
and La Maison Francaise gen
erally collaborate on a French-
Italian film series at least one
quarter every year, and two
years out of the last three there
has been a Japanese film series

as well. These always prove to
be treasure troves for movie
lovers with non-conformist
tastes. Then there is the usual
smattering of dorm-sponsored
movies, movies associated
with special events one-shot
deals and foreign (often
Third World) films shown by
the Bechtel International
Center.
OFF CAMPUS
New Varsity: Located on Uni
versity Avenue between
Waverley and Cowper Streets,

the New Varsity is a nearly ideal
repertory cinema. Double bills
(and occasionally triple bills)
change every day or two, and
they offer not only recent films
(often hot off the first-run
screens) but also American and
foreign classics, some not
often revived. If a relatively
unpublicized movie opens in
San Francisco and fails to show
up first-run in Palo Alto, you
can expect it at the New Varsity
within six months. The seats

are slightly rickety and uncom
fortable, but the Varsity's pat
rons don't seem to mind very
much. The building also
houses an indoor-outdoor
cafe-restaurant where locals
often gather in the evening for
coffee, dessert and live music
in the courtyard.
Festival: Just behind the Var
sity, on Hamilton Avenue just
west of Cowper Street, is the
Festival Theater, which shows
one double bill a week. (The

movies change on Thursday.)
It's much smaller than the Var
sity intimate but very
cozy, with overstuffed seats
and enormous pillows on the
floor just in front of the screen.
Almost all the features are Hol
lywood movies from the '3os
and '4os (there's a British dou
ble bill every six weeks or so),
which are a treat to see again
on a big screen even if you've
already caught them on TV.
The Festival threatened to

close its doors for good last
December, but it changed
hands instead, to the great re
lief of those of us who believe it
provides the best atmosphere
in town for seeing movies.
Aquarius: The Aquarius, on
Emerson between University
and Lytton, has two small
cinemas that show mostly
foreign and "small" American
features like Come Back to the
5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy
Dean and Chilly Scenes of
Winter. Since it is one of Palo
major claims to culture,
â„¢ is nearly always crowded on
Friday and Saturday nights.
Bijou: The Aquarius' twin, lo
cated farther south on Emer
son Street between Hamilton
and Forest. The Bijou is more
likely to show popular com
mercial features than the
Aquarius, though lately they
have been sharing the goods,
and in fact a picture bumped
out of the Aquarius by a newer
roioase may be shuffled down
1..? street to the Bijou if it has
been doing surprisingly good
business. It is unusual for a
movie to play longer than a
month at either of these
houses.
Fine Arts: On California Av-
Itenue, just east of El Camino
in the midst of the nicest com
mercial area in Palo Alto. The
Fine Arts is a fairly nice theater,

but it has a tendency to grab
hold of movies it can show for
months and months like An
Officer and a Gentleman or
Candhi so you're not likely
to go there more than three or
four times a year, no matter
how dedicated a movie lover
you are.
Stanford: The latest addition to
Palo Alto's moviehouses, the
renovated old Stanford Thea
ter is also used as a concert hall
and a live theater. When it is
not otherwise booked, it
shows double bills of recent re
leases at bargain admission
prices.
Palo Alto Square: These twin
theaters take up the bottom
floor of a very bland-looking
office building at the corner of
El Camino and Page Mill Road.
They draw mostly high school
kids, because they'tend to
show boffo films like War-
Games, The Twilight Zone and
Staying Alive. But they are un
deniably comfortable and con
venient (if you have a car).
Guild, Park: These are Menlo
Park's two movie theaters (the
third, the Menlo, closed a year
ago and its space was absorbed
by an expanding Chinese re
staurant), located a couple of
blocks from each other on El
Camino. Each offers first-run
movies of all kinds, including
"art house" films like La
Traviata and The Grey Fox.
Old Mill 6: The bane of a
moviegoer's existence you
can't avoid seeing films here,
because since there are six sc

reens, two or three new pic
tures arrive every week. Be
sides, the bargain-price
twilight shows are very seduc
tive. But the screens are tiny,
the theater is always crowded,
and you move from line to line
until you feel you're being pro
cessed. Furthermore, it's an of
fensively ugly environment in
which to see movies the the
ater looks vaguely like a video
arcade. But if you must, you
must. Located in the Old Mill
Shopping Mall on San Antonio
Road, north of the San Antonio
Shopping Center. (The easiest
way to get to it is via Alma; if
you take the San Antonio
turn-off, you'll find immediate
signs for the Old Mill.)
Any local paper will tell
what's playing at each of the
above theaters the bills usu
ally change on Fridays and
the best overall guide to
movies is the Arts and Enter
tainment section of the Sunday
San Francisco Examiner &
Chronicle, affectionately
known as the "pink section." A
number of local theaters adver
tise in the Daily, as do a
number of the on-campus film
series. The registration packet
always includes ASSU Sunday
Flicks and Chaparral Saturday
Film Series schedules; the
others turn up in the usual
places the kiosks, in and
around Tresidder, around the
Quad. A selective list of movies
(mostly revivals) appears in the
"Cinemascope" section of the
Daily every Friday.
