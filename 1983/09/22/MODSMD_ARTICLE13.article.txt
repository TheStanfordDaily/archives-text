# THEATRE AT STANFORD
## PLAY BILL 
### 
No matter how
much people
talk about the
San Francisco
opera, or the
city's
nightclubs, it is
the area's
hundreds of
theater groups
that validate San
Francisco's
claim to West
Coast cultural
supremacy.

What museums are to Flor
ence, the theatre is for San
Francisco. No matter how
much people talk about the
San Francisco opera, or the ci
ty's nightclubs, it is the area's
hundreds of theatre groups
that validate San Francisco's
claim to West Coast cultural
supremacy. The most impor
tant activity takes place in the
many small theatres scattered
around San Francisco and Ber
keley; the following account
starts closer to home, covering

campus and area theatre first,
then moving to the city's major
groups, and finally arriving at
the smaller venues.
The Stanford Drama Dept.
presents a major play each
quarter, with productions usu
ally taking place in the Little
Theater behind Memorial Au
ditorium. The productions are
directed and designed by
members of the department,
but cast auditions are open to
the public, and students from
fields other than drama are
often cast. The department's
1983-84 plays will be Friedrich
Durrenmatt's The Visit, Pin
ero's Trelawny of the "Wells,"
and Hamlet. '
In addition to the major pro
ductions, the department
sponsors Graduate Directing
Workshops, "no-frills" pro
ductions directed by the de
partment's graduate students.
These are held at the Nitery, in
the Old Union, and there is no
admission charge. No titles
have been announced for this
year; watch for posters or ad
vertisements in the Daily.
There are several successful,
on-going, student-run produc
ing companies on campus.
Chief among these is Rams
Head, which produces
Gaieties, a comedy revue, dur
ing Big Game week in the fall,
and a major musical produc
tion each spring. In recent
years Rams Head has put on
Cabaret and Hello Dolly. Both
Gaieties and the musicals are

put on in Memorial Au
ditorium. The group also pro
duces a program of one-act
plays written by students. The
Company is a smaller group,
with a production schedule
less cut-and-dried than Rams
Head's; individual initiative
counts for more in determin
ing what plays are produced,
and when. The Company's
productions vary greatly in
scope, ranging in recent years
from elaborate stagings of Hair
and Jesus Christ Superstar to a
traveling troupe that went from
dorm to dorm doing The Fan
tastic ks in lounges.
The Black Performing Arts
Group and the Asian American
Theatre Project also do plays,
usually concentrating their ef
forts on spring quarter. Five
years ago the AATP put on the
first performance anywhere of
David Henry Hwang's FOB , a
play which was later produced
by Joseph Papp in New York, to
critical acclaim.
All of the student production
companies rely, of course, on
student ability in all areas: per
formance, direction, set and
lighting and costume work,
promotion. Announcements
regarding auditions, and sup
port positions, appear in the
Daily and in flyers posted
around campus.
Spring quarter is the great
season for dorm productions.
Most of the larger dorms, and
even some of the smaller
houses, put on a play in the

spring. The repertoire is drawn
mainly from Broadway, either
comedies (You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown; The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas) or musi

cals (Oklahoma, Grease). Oc
casionally something a bit
more cerebral is attempted,
such as Whitman's production
of Antigone or Lagunita's

Threepenny Opera and Two
Gentlemen of Verona. Over
the years, some dorms have
gained a reputation for the
lavishness of their produc
tions; Toyon and Lagunita
(home of the Lagunita Players)
are famous in this regard.
There is a huge gap, in San
Francisco and Berkeley profes
sional theatre, between the
large groups and the small
groups. Because of the strange
rules that apply in financing for
the arts, there are only two
ways to survive: to be very
small, or very, very big. This
leads to another dichotomy.
The small theatres can afford to
be much more adventurous in
their programming, or to aim
themselves at a specific audi
ence. The large theatres have
huge investments to protect,
and must attract as wide an au
dience as possible; hence,
they are inherently conserva
tive. And there's one more dif
ference, also determined by
economic considerations:
there are, by most standards,
only two "large" companies to
describe, both of which we
have; there are many, many
small companies, the most im
portant of which are described
thereafter.
The American Conservatory
Theater, or ACT, ranks with the
Guthrie Theatre in Min
neapolis as one of the coun
try's best regional theaters. Its
presence in the Geary Theatre,
at 450 Geary in San Francisco,

makes Geary Street the heart of
the theater district. No com
pany in the Bay Area, or even
on the West coast (outside of
Shakespearean festival groups)
can rival the ACT in performing
talent, facilities, or reputation.
The ACT is an arch
conservative company: they
go heavy on the classics, and
the modern (meaning post
-1920) plays they do perform
tend to be of the sparkling-
British-wit (Noel Coward) or
the folksy-American (/ Re
member Mama, Ah! Wilder
ness) kind. But they are nearly
always a joy to watch, because
no one puts polish on a pro
duction these days like the
ACT.
The Berkeley Repertory
Theatre keeps threatening to
become an ACT clone; their
schedules in recent seasons
have been, if anything, more
conservative than the San
Francisco company's. Despite
their slick promotional efforts,
though, Berkeley Rep in per
son is much less pretentious
than the ACT. Their theatre at
2205 Addison St. is a marvel,
both modern and comforta
ble; it is a much nicer place to
see a play than the rather
baroque Geary.
The big money in San Fran
cisco theatre is tied up in
Carole Shorenstein's two "Best
of Broadway" series. "Best of
Broadway" plays in three diffe
rent theatres: the Golden Gate,
25 Taylor; the Orpheum, 1192
Market; and the Curran, 445
Geary (next door to the ACT).
All three host traveling produc
tions of Broadway hits; the cur
rent boffo SF smash is Lena
Home: the Lady and Her
Music, actually a show worth
seeing. Smaller-scale New
York successes, such as Caryl
Churchill's Cloud 9 or Harvey
Fierstein's Torch Song Trilogy,
will sometimes be brought to
Theatre on the Square or the
Marine's Memorial Theatre,
both located in the Geary dis
trict near Union Square.
Although it does not often
receive much publicity, the
bulk of the theatrical activity in
San Francisco is centered
around the smaller, semi
professional theaters. It is here
that most of the local actors
work, where the local authors
often have their plays first per
formed, and where the local
technicians get to try out their
ideas.
They are often referred to as
the "99-seat" theaters since, by
limiting themselves to less than
100 seats, they can avoid Equity
(i.e. union) pay scales and thus
mount new productions at re
latively low cost.

The size of these theaters
also brings many benefits to
the audience. Spaces this small
offer an intimacy and intensity
that is almost never attained in
a large theater. There is often
no extravagant stage; some
times just a space on the floor
surrounded by seats. The tradi
tional distance between audi
ence and performer can be al
most completely wiped out,
emphasizing the "live" aspects
which give theater its unique
excitement.
Another advantage of the
small size is that writers and di
rectors are offered a great deal
of flexibility. The risks of
mounting a production are not
so great, and experimentation
is common. Another important
feature is that the theaters can
specialize only producing
plays with certain themes, or
plays connected with some so
cial or political group.
Trying to describe this aspect
of San Francisco theater can be
difficult since companies can
surface and then disappear
quickly. There are a number of
theaters, however, which have
become an established part of
the city's cultural life. Even if it
omits the more volatile com
panies, a description of their
work should give an impres
sion of the vitality of small thea

ter in the Bay Area.
The Magic Theatre is the best
known of the small theatres in
San Francisco, thanks in part to
its resident playwright, Sam
Shepard. Shepard has pre
miered many of his more re
cent plays at the Magic, includ
ing True West and Buried Child
(which won the Pulitzer Prize
in 1979).
The Magic specializes in new
plays by contemporary playw
rights, and often stages ex
perimental theatre pieces by
performance artists. They have
strong ties to contemporary
German and Austrian theater
via their dramaturg, Stanford
Drama Prof. Martin Esslin.
The 1983-84 Magic season
will include premieres of
works by Shepard, Ed Bullins,
Mayo Simon and Adele Edling
Shank. The Magic Theatre has
two stages located in Building
D at Fort Mason.
The Julian Theatre specializes
in plays dealing with current
events and contemporary so
cial issues. In addition, their
productions are usually multi
racial and multi-cultural, thus
giving an implicit social con
sciousness to any play they
perform. The Julian is located
at 953 DeHaro Street, on Pot
rero Hill. They share their

space, in a residential
neighborhood, with another
group, the Nabe Theatre.
Because of the many ethnic
and social groups in the city,
playwrights and performers
from these groups have come
together to form theatres
which concentrate on the spe
cial interests of these com
munities. Two of the best
known groups of this type are
Theatre Rhinoceros and the
Asian-American Theatre Project.
Theatre Rhinoceros produces
plays about gay people. Sev
eral years ago the Rhinoceros
premiered Harvey Fierstein's
Pulitzer Prize-winning Torch
Song Trilogy.
Because of its heavy reliance
on improvisation and its often
transitory nature, it is difficult
to give much concrete infor
mation about performance art
in the city. It is almost com
pletely unpublicized, with in
formation being spread by
word of mouth among the ar
tist's friends and colleagues.
Another problem is that the
works are often performed in
unusual settings, such as
empty lots, warehouses, or
parks.
One space which specializes
in performance art (as well as
environmental sculpture and

experimental poetry) is 80
Langton. It is run by artists, and
it puts on frequent shows, but
often with very brief runs
(perhaps only one night).
80 Langton is located, not
surprisingly, at 80 Langton, a
small street off Folsom near
Seventh.
The small theatres in San
Francisco often put on plays
with brief runs and do not have
a lot of money to spend on
publicity. As a result, just find
ing out what is going on can be
a challenge.
One very good source of in
formation is the Sunday pink
section of the San Francisco
Examiner and Chronicle. They
have listings (occasionally with
descriptions) of productions
by the more established small
theatres.
There are two free publica
tions which give much more in
formation about the less well
known groups. The SF Bay
Guardian appears every Wed
nesday. It is distributed in
many bars and restaurants in
the city and in the East Bay. In
addition to a calendar of cheap
and free events, they publish
quite complete listings of plays
currently running as well as of
plays about to open.

Theatre on the Square or the

both located in the Geary dis
trict near Union Square.
Although it does not often
receive much publicity, the
bulk of the theatrical activity in
San Francisco is centered
around the smaller, semi
professional theaters. It is here
that most of the local actors
work, where the local authors
often have their plays first per
formed, and where the local
technicians get to try out their
ideas.
They are often referred to as
the "99-seat" theaters since, by
limiting themselves to less than
100 seats, they can avoid Equity
(i.e. union) pay scales and thus
mount new productions at re
latively low cost.

The size of these theaters
also brings many benefits to
the audience. Spaces this small
offer an intimacy and intensity
that is almost never attained in
a large theater. There is often
no extravagant stage; some
times just a space on the floor
surrounded by seats. The tradi

ence and performer can be al
most completely wiped out,
emphasizing the "live" aspects
which give theater its unique
excitement.
Another advantage of the
small size is that writers and di
rectors are offered a great deal
of flexibility. The risks of
mounting a production are not
so great, and experimentation
is common. Another important
feature is that the theaters can
specialize only producing
plays with certain themes, or
plays connected with some so
cial or political group.
Trying to describe this aspect
of San Francisco theater can be
difficult since companies can
surface and then disappear
quickly. There are a number of
theaters, however, which have
become an established part of
the city's cultural life. Even if it
omits the more volatile com
panies, a description of their
work should give an impres

ter in the Bay Area.
The Magic Theatre is the best
known of the small theatres in
San Francisco, thanks in part to
its resident playwright, Sam
Shepard. Shepard has pre

ing True West and Buried Child
(which won the Pulitzer Prize

The Magic specializes in new

performance artists. They have
strong ties to contemporary
German and Austrian theater
via their dramaturg, Stanford
Drama Prof. Martin Esslin.
The 1983-84 Magic season
will include premieres of
works by Shepard, Ed Bullins,
Mayo Simon and Adele Edling
Shank. The Magic Theatre has
two stages located in Building
D at Fort Mason.
The Julian Theatre specializes
in plays dealing with current
events and contemporary so
cial issues. In addition, their
productions are usually multi
racial and multi-cultural, thus
giving an implicit social con
sciousness to any play they
perform. The Julian is located
at 953 DeHaro Street, on Pot

space, in a residential

group, the Nabe Theatre.
Because of the many ethnic
and social groups in the city,
playwrights and performers
from these groups have come
together to form theatres
which concentrate on the spe
cial interests of these com
munities. Two of the best
known groups of this type are
Theatre Rhinoceros and the
Asian-American Theatre Project.
Theatre Rhinoceros produces
plays about gay people. Sev

premiered Harvey Fierstein's
Pulitzer Prize-winning Torch

Because of its heavy reliance
on improvisation and its often

to give much concrete infor

in the city. It is almost com
pletely unpublicized, with in
formation being spread by
word of mouth among the ar
tist's friends and colleagues.
Another problem is that the
works are often performed in
unusual settings, such as
empty lots, warehouses, or
parks.
One space which specializes
in performance art (as well as
environmental sculpture and

experimental poetry) is 80
Langton. It is run by artists, and
it puts on frequent shows, but
often with very brief runs
(perhaps only one night).
80 Langton is located, not
surprisingly, at 80 Langton, a
small street off Folsom near
Seventh.
The small theatres in San
Francisco often put on plays
with brief runs and do not have
a lot of money to spend on
publicity. As a result, just find
ing out what is going on can be
a challenge.
One very good source of in
formation is the Sunday pink
section of the San Francisco
Examiner and Chronicle. They
have listings (occasionally with
descriptions) of productions
by the more established small
theatres.
There are two free publica
tions which give much more in
formation about the less well
known groups. The SF Bay
Guardian appears every Wed
nesday. It is distributed in
many bars and restaurants in
the city and in the East Bay. In
addition to a calendar of cheap
and free events, they publish
quite complete listings of plays
currently running as well as of
plays about to open.

the area's

What museums are to Flor
ence, the theatre is for San
Francisco. No matter how
much people talk about the
San Francisco opera, or the ci
ty's nightclubs, it is the area's
hundreds of theatre groups
that validate San Francisco's
claim to West Coast cultural
supremacy. The most impor
tant activity takes place in the
many small theatres scattered
around San Francisco and Ber
keley; the following account
starts closer to home, covering

campus and area theatre first,
then moving to the city's major
groups, and finally arriving at
the smaller venues.
The Stanford Drama Dept.
presents a major play each
quarter, with productions usu
ally taking place in the Little
Theater behind Memorial Au
ditorium. The productions are
directed and designed by
members of the department,
but cast auditions are open to
the public, and students from
fields other than drama are
often cast. The department's
1983-84 plays will be Friedrich
Durrenmatt's The Visit, Pin
ero's Trelawny of the "Wells,"
and Hamlet. '
In addition to the major pro
ductions, the department
sponsors Graduate Directing
Workshops, "no-frills" pro
ductions directed by the de
partment's graduate students.
These are held at the Nitery, in
the Old Union, and there is no
admission charge. No titles
have been announced for this
year; watch for posters or ad
vertisements in the Daily.
There are several successful,
on-going, student-run produc
ing companies on campus.
Chief among these is Rams
Head, which produces
Gaieties, a comedy revue, dur
ing Big Game week in the fall,
and a major musical produc
tion each spring. In recent
years Rams Head has put on
Cabaret and Hello Dolly. Both
Gaieties and the musicals are

put on in Memorial Au
ditorium. The group also pro
duces a program of one-act
plays written by students. The
Company is a smaller group,
with a production schedule
less cut-and-dried than Rams
Head's; individual initiative
counts for more in determin
ing what plays are produced,
and when. The Company's
productions vary greatly in
scope, ranging in recent years
from elaborate stagings of Hair
and Jesus Christ Superstar to a
traveling troupe that went from
dorm to dorm doing The Fan
tastic ks in lounges.
The Black Performing Arts
Group and the Asian American
Theatre Project also do plays,
usually concentrating their ef
forts on spring quarter. Five
years ago the AATP put on the
first performance anywhere of
David Henry Hwang's FOB , a
play which was later produced
by Joseph Papp in New York, to
critical acclaim.
All of the student production
companies rely, of course, on
student ability in all areas: per
formance, direction, set and
lighting and costume work,
promotion. Announcements
regarding auditions, and sup
port positions, appear in the
Daily and in flyers posted
around campus.
Spring quarter is the great
season for dorm productions.
Most of the larger dorms, and
even some of the smaller
houses, put on a play in the

spring. The repertoire is drawn
mainly from Broadway, either
comedies (You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown; The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas) or musi

cals (Oklahoma, Grease). Oc
casionally something a bit
more cerebral is attempted,
such as Whitman's production
of Antigone or Lagunita's

Threepenny Opera and Two
Gentlemen of Verona. Over
the years, some dorms have
gained a reputation for the
lavishness of their produc
tions; Toyon and Lagunita
(home of the Lagunita Players)
are famous in this regard.
There is a huge gap, in San
Francisco and Berkeley profes
sional theatre, between the
large groups and the small
groups. Because of the strange
rules that apply in financing for
the arts, there are only two
ways to survive: to be very
small, or very, very big. This
leads to another dichotomy.
The small theatres can afford to
be much more adventurous in
their programming, or to aim
themselves at a specific audi
ence. The large theatres have
huge investments to protect,
and must attract as wide an au
dience as possible; hence,
they are inherently conserva
tive. And there's one more dif
ference, also determined by
economic considerations:
there are, by most standards,
only two "large" companies to
describe, both of which we
have; there are many, many
small companies, the most im
portant of which are described
thereafter.
The American Conservatory
Theater, or ACT, ranks with the
Guthrie Theatre in Min
neapolis as one of the coun
try's best regional theaters. Its
presence in the Geary Theatre,
at 450 Geary in San Francisco,

makes Geary Street the heart of
the theater district. No com
pany in the Bay Area, or even
on the West coast (outside of
Shakespearean festival groups)
can rival the ACT in performing
talent, facilities, or reputation.
The ACT is an arch
conservative company: they
go heavy on the classics, and
the modern (meaning post
-1920) plays they do perform
tend to be of the sparkling-
British-wit (Noel Coward) or
the folksy-American (/ Re
member Mama, Ah! Wilder
ness) kind. But they are nearly
always a joy to watch, because
no one puts polish on a pro
duction these days like the
ACT.
The Berkeley Repertory
Theatre keeps threatening to
become an ACT clone; their
schedules in recent seasons
have been, if anything, more
conservative than the San
Francisco company's. Despite
their slick promotional efforts,
though, Berkeley Rep in per
son is much less pretentious
than the ACT. Their theatre at
2205 Addison St. is a marvel,
both modern and comforta
ble; it is a much nicer place to
see a play than the rather
baroque Geary.
The big money in San Fran
cisco theatre is tied up in
Carole Shorenstein's two "Best
of Broadway" series. "Best of
Broadway" plays in three diffe
rent theatres: the Golden Gate,
25 Taylor; the Orpheum, 1192
Market; and the Curran, 445
Geary (next door to the ACT).
All three host traveling produc
tions of Broadway hits; the cur
rent boffo SF smash is Lena
Home: the Lady and Her
Music, actually a show worth
seeing. Smaller-scale New
York successes, such as Caryl
Churchill's Cloud 9 or Harvey
Fierstein's Torch Song Trilogy,
will sometimes be brought to
Theatre on the Square or the
Marine's Memorial Theatre,
both located in the Geary dis

the Old Union, and there is no
admission charge. No titles
have been announced for this
year; watch for posters or ad
vertisements in the Daily.
There are several successful,
on-going, student-run produc
ing companies on campus.
Chief among these is Rams
Head, which produces
Gaieties, a comedy revue, dur
ing Big Game week in the fall,
and a major musical produc
tion each spring. In recent
years Rams Head has put on
Cabaret and Hello Dolly. Both
Gaieties and the musicals are

put on in Memorial Au
ditorium. The group also pro
duces a program of one-act
plays written by students. The
Company is a smaller group,
with a production schedule
less cut-and-dried than Rams
Head's; individual initiative
counts for more in determin
ing what plays are produced,
and when. The Company's
productions vary greatly in
scope, ranging in recent years
from elaborate stagings of Hair
and Jesus Christ Superstar to a
traveling troupe that went from
dorm to dorm doing The Fan
tastic ks in lounges.
The Black Performing Arts
Group and the Asian American
Theatre Project also do plays,
usually concentrating their ef
forts on spring quarter. Five
years ago the AATP put on the
first performance anywhere of
David Henry Hwang's FOB , a
play which was later produced
by Joseph Papp in New York, to
critical acclaim.
All of the student production
companies rely, of course, on
student ability in all areas: per
formance, direction, set and
lighting and costume work,
promotion. Announcements
regarding auditions, and sup
port positions, appear in the
Daily and in flyers posted
around campus.
Spring quarter is the great
season for dorm productions.
Most of the larger dorms, and
even some of the smaller
houses, put on a play in the

spring. The repertoire is drawn
mainly from Broadway, either
comedies (You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown; The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas) or musi

cals (Oklahoma, Grease). Oc
casionally something a bit
more cerebral is attempted,
such as Whitman's production
of Antigone or Lagunita's

Threepenny Opera and Two
Gentlemen of Verona. Over
the years, some dorms have
gained a reputation for the
lavishness of their produc
tions; Toyon and Lagunita
(home of the Lagunita Players)
are famous in this regard.
There is a huge gap, in San
Francisco and Berkeley profes
sional theatre, between the
large groups and the small
groups. Because of the strange
rules that apply in financing for
the arts, there are only two
ways to survive: to be very
small, or very, very big. This
leads to another dichotomy.
The small theatres can afford to
be much more adventurous in
their programming, or to aim
themselves at a specific audi
ence. The large theatres have
huge investments to protect,
and must attract as wide an au
dience as possible; hence,
they are inherently conserva
tive. And there's one more dif
ference, also determined by
economic considerations:
there are, by most standards,
only two "large" companies to
describe, both of which we
have; there are many, many
small companies, the most im
portant of which are described
thereafter.
The American Conservatory
Theater, or ACT, ranks with the
Guthrie Theatre in Min
neapolis as one of the coun
try's best regional theaters. Its
presence in the Geary Theatre,
at 450 Geary in San Francisco,

makes Geary Street the heart of
the theater district. No com
pany in the Bay Area, or even
on the West coast (outside of
Shakespearean festival groups)
can rival the ACT in performing
talent, facilities, or reputation.
The ACT is an arch
conservative company: they
go heavy on the classics, and
the modern (meaning post
-1920) plays they do perform
tend to be of the sparkling-
British-wit (Noel Coward) or
the folksy-American (/ Re
member Mama, Ah! Wilder
ness) kind. But they are nearly
always a joy to watch, because
no one puts polish on a pro
duction these days like the
ACT.
The Berkeley Repertory
Theatre keeps threatening to
become an ACT clone; their
schedules in recent seasons
have been, if anything, more
conservative than the San
Francisco company's. Despite
their slick promotional efforts,
though, Berkeley Rep in per
son is much less pretentious
than the ACT. Their theatre at
2205 Addison St. is a marvel,
both modern and comforta
ble; it is a much nicer place to
see a play than the rather
baroque Geary.
The big money in San Fran
cisco theatre is tied up in
Carole Shorenstein's two "Best
of Broadway" series. "Best of
Broadway" plays in three diffe
rent theatres: the Golden Gate,
25 Taylor; the Orpheum, 1192
Market; and the Curran, 445
Geary (next door to the ACT).
All three host traveling produc
tions of Broadway hits; the cur
rent boffo SF smash is Lena
Home: the Lady and Her
Music, actually a show worth
seeing. Smaller-scale New
York successes, such as Caryl
Churchill's Cloud 9 or Harvey
Fierstein's Torch Song Trilogy,
will sometimes be brought to
Theatre on the Square or the
Marine's Memorial Theatre,
both located in the Geary dis
trict near Union Square.
Although it does not often
receive much publicity, the
bulk of the theatrical activity in
San Francisco is centered
around the smaller, semi
professional theaters. It is here
that most of the local actors
work, where the local authors
often have their plays first per
formed, and where the local
technicians get to try out their
ideas.
They are often referred to as
the "99-seat" theaters since, by
limiting themselves to less than
100 seats, they can avoid Equity
(i.e. union) pay scales and thus
mount new productions at re
latively low cost.

The size of these theaters
also brings many benefits to
the audience. Spaces this small
offer an intimacy and intensity
that is almost never attained in
a large theater. There is often
no extravagant stage; some
times just a space on the floor
surrounded by seats. The tradi
tional distance between audi
ence and performer can be al
most completely wiped out,
emphasizing the "live" aspects
which give theater its unique
excitement.
Another advantage of the
small size is that writers and di
rectors are offered a great deal
of flexibility. The risks of
mounting a production are not
so great, and experimentation
is common. Another important
feature is that the theaters can
specialize only producing
plays with certain themes, or
plays connected with some so
cial or political group.
Trying to describe this aspect
of San Francisco theater can be
difficult since companies can
surface and then disappear
quickly. There are a number of
theaters, however, which have
become an established part of
the city's cultural life. Even if it
omits the more volatile com
panies, a description of their
work should give an impres
sion of the vitality of small thea

ter in the Bay Area.
The Magic Theatre is the best
known of the small theatres in
San Francisco, thanks in part to
its resident playwright, Sam
Shepard. Shepard has pre
miered many of his more re
cent plays at the Magic, includ
ing True West and Buried Child
(which won the Pulitzer Prize
in 1979).
The Magic specializes in new
plays by contemporary playw
rights, and often stages ex
perimental theatre pieces by
performance artists. They have
strong ties to contemporary
German and Austrian theater
via their dramaturg, Stanford
Drama Prof. Martin Esslin.
The 1983-84 Magic season
will include premieres of
works by Shepard, Ed Bullins,
Mayo Simon and Adele Edling
Shank. The Magic Theatre has
two stages located in Building
D at Fort Mason.
The Julian Theatre specializes
in plays dealing with current
events and contemporary so
cial issues. In addition, their
productions are usually multi
racial and multi-cultural, thus
giving an implicit social con
sciousness to any play they
perform. The Julian is located
at 953 DeHaro Street, on Pot
rero Hill. They share their

space, in a residential
neighborhood, with another
group, the Nabe Theatre.
Because of the many ethnic
and social groups in the city,
playwrights and performers
from these groups have come
together to form theatres
which concentrate on the spe
cial interests of these com
munities. Two of the best
known groups of this type are
Theatre Rhinoceros and the
Asian-American Theatre Project.
Theatre Rhinoceros produces
plays about gay people. Sev
eral years ago the Rhinoceros
premiered Harvey Fierstein's
Pulitzer Prize-winning Torch
Song Trilogy.
Because of its heavy reliance
on improvisation and its often
transitory nature, it is difficult
to give much concrete infor
mation about performance art
in the city. It is almost com
pletely unpublicized, with in
formation being spread by
word of mouth among the ar
tist's friends and colleagues.
Another problem is that the
works are often performed in
unusual settings, such as
empty lots, warehouses, or
parks.
One space which specializes
in performance art (as well as
environmental sculpture and

experimental poetry) is 80
Langton. It is run by artists, and
it puts on frequent shows, but
often with very brief runs
(perhaps only one night).
80 Langton is located, not
surprisingly, at 80 Langton, a
small street off Folsom near
Seventh.
The small theatres in San
Francisco often put on plays
with brief runs and do not have
a lot of money to spend on
publicity. As a result, just find
ing out what is going on can be
a challenge.
One very good source of in
formation is the Sunday pink
section of the San Francisco
Examiner and Chronicle. They
have listings (occasionally with
descriptions) of productions
by the more established small
theatres.
There are two free publica
tions which give much more in
formation about the less well
known groups. The SF Bay
Guardian appears every Wed
nesday. It is distributed in
many bars and restaurants in
the city and in the East Bay. In
addition to a calendar of cheap
and free events, they publish
quite complete listings of plays
currently running as well as of
plays about to open.
No matter how
much people
talk about the
San Francisco
opera, or the
city's
nightclubs, it is
the area's
hundreds of
theater groups
that validate San
Francisco's
claim to West
Coast cultural
supremacy.

What museums are to Flor
ence, the theatre is for San
Francisco. No matter how
much people talk about the
San Francisco opera, or the ci
ty's nightclubs, it is the area's
hundreds of theatre groups
that validate San Francisco's
claim to West Coast cultural
supremacy. The most impor
tant activity takes place in the
many small theatres scattered
around San Francisco and Ber
keley; the following account
starts closer to home, covering

campus and area theatre first,
then moving to the city's major
groups, and finally arriving at
the smaller venues.
The Stanford Drama Dept.
presents a major play each
quarter, with productions usu
ally taking place in the Little
Theater behind Memorial Au
ditorium. The productions are
directed and designed by
members of the department,
but cast auditions are open to
the public, and students from
fields other than drama are
often cast. The department's
1983-84 plays will be Friedrich
Durrenmatt's The Visit, Pin
ero's Trelawny of the "Wells,"
and Hamlet. '
In addition to the major pro
ductions, the department
sponsors Graduate Directing
Workshops, "no-frills" pro
ductions directed by the de
partment's graduate students.
These are held at the Nitery, in
the Old Union, and there is no
admission charge. No titles
have been announced for this
year; watch for posters or ad
vertisements in the Daily.
