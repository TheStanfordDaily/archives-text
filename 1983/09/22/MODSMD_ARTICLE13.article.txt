# THEATRE AT STANFORD

No matter how
much people
talk about the
San Francisco
opera, or the
city's
nightclubs, it is
the area's
hundreds of
theater groups
that validate San
Francisco's
claim to West
Coast cultural
supremacy.

What museums are to Flor
ence, the theatre is for San
Francisco. No matter how
much people talk about the
San Francisco opera, or the ci
ty's nightclubs, it is the area's
hundreds of theatre groups
that validate San Francisco's
claim to West Coast cultural
supremacy. The most impor
tant activity takes place in the
many small theatres scattered
around San Francisco and Ber
keley; the following account
starts closer to home, covering

campus and area theatre first,
then moving to the city's major
groups, and finally arriving at
the smaller venues.
The Stanford Drama Dept.
presents a major play each
quarter, with productions usu
ally taking place in the Little
Theater behind Memorial Au
ditorium. The productions are
directed and designed by
members of the department,
but cast auditions are open to
the public, and students from
fields other than drama are
often cast. The department's
1983-84 plays will be Friedrich
Durrenmatt's The Visit, Pin
ero's Trelawny of the "Wells,"
and Hamlet. '
In addition to the major pro
ductions, the department
sponsors Graduate Directing
Workshops, "no-frills" pro
ductions directed by the de
partment's graduate students.
These are held at the Nitery, in
the Old Union, and there is no
admission charge. No titles
have been announced for this
year; watch for posters or ad
vertisements in the Daily.
There are several successful,
on-going, student-run produc
ing companies on campus.
Chief among these is Rams
Head, which produces
Gaieties, a comedy revue, dur
ing Big Game week in the fall,
and a major musical produc
tion each spring. In recent
years Rams Head has put on
Cabaret and Hello Dolly. Both
Gaieties and the musicals are

put on in Memorial Au
ditorium. The group also pro
duces a program of one-act
plays written by students. The
Company is a smaller group,
with a production schedule
less cut-and-dried than Rams
Head's; individual initiative
counts for more in determin
ing what plays are produced,
and when. The Company's
productions vary greatly in
scope, ranging in recent years
from elaborate stagings of Hair
and Jesus Christ Superstar to a
traveling troupe that went from
dorm to dorm doing The Fan
tastic ks in lounges.
The Black Performing Arts
Group and the Asian American
Theatre Project also do plays,
usually concentrating their ef
forts on spring quarter. Five
years ago the AATP put on the
first performance anywhere of
David Henry Hwang's FOB , a
play which was later produced
by Joseph Papp in New York, to
critical acclaim.
All of the student production
companies rely, of course, on
student ability in all areas: per
formance, direction, set and
lighting and costume work,
promotion. Announcements
regarding auditions, and sup
port positions, appear in the
Daily and in flyers posted
around campus.
Spring quarter is the great
season for dorm productions.
Most of the larger dorms, and
even some of the smaller
houses, put on a play in the

spring. The repertoire is drawn
mainly from Broadway, either
comedies (You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown; The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas) or musi

cals (Oklahoma, Grease). Oc
casionally something a bit
more cerebral is attempted,
such as Whitman's production
of Antigone or Lagunita's

Threepenny Opera and Two
Gentlemen of Verona. Over
the years, some dorms have
gained a reputation for the
lavishness of their produc
tions; Toyon and Lagunita
(home of the Lagunita Players)
are famous in this regard.
There is a huge gap, in San
Francisco and Berkeley profes
sional theatre, between the
large groups and the small
groups. Because of the strange
rules that apply in financing for
the arts, there are only two
ways to survive: to be very
small, or very, very big. This
leads to another dichotomy.
The small theatres can afford to
be much more adventurous in
their programming, or to aim
themselves at a specific audi
ence. The large theatres have
huge investments to protect,
and must attract as wide an au
dience as possible; hence,
they are inherently conserva
tive. And there's one more dif
ference, also determined by
economic considerations:
there are, by most standards,
only two "large" companies to
describe, both of which we
have; there are many, many
small companies, the most im
portant of which are described
thereafter.
The American Conservatory
Theater, or ACT, ranks with the
Guthrie Theatre in Min
neapolis as one of the coun
try's best regional theaters. Its
presence in the Geary Theatre,
at 450 Geary in San Francisco,

makes Geary Street the heart of
the theater district. No com
pany in the Bay Area, or even
on the West coast (outside of
Shakespearean festival groups)
can rival the ACT in performing
talent, facilities, or reputation.
The ACT is an arch
conservative company: they
go heavy on the classics, and
the modern (meaning post
-1920) plays they do perform
tend to be of the sparkling-
British-wit (Noel Coward) or
the folksy-American (/ Re
member Mama, Ah! Wilder
ness) kind. But they are nearly
always a joy to watch, because
no one puts polish on a pro
duction these days like the
ACT.
The Berkeley Repertory
Theatre keeps threatening to
become an ACT clone; their
schedules in recent seasons
have been, if anything, more
conservative than the San
Francisco company's. Despite
their slick promotional efforts,
though, Berkeley Rep in per
son is much less pretentious
than the ACT. Their theatre at
2205 Addison St. is a marvel,
both modern and comforta
ble; it is a much nicer place to
see a play than the rather
baroque Geary.
The big money in San Fran
cisco theatre is tied up in
Carole Shorenstein's two "Best
of Broadway" series. "Best of
Broadway" plays in three diffe
rent theatres: the Golden Gate,
