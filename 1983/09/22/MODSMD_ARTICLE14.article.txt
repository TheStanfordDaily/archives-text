Student bibliophiles and
bibliomaniacs are faced with an
unusual problem at Stanford. Finding
a good bookstore near campus is no
challenge; choosing is the hard part.

Between California Avenue,
in Palo Alto, and Santa Cruz
Avenue, in Menlo Park, there
are nearly 30 different stores
which sell only, or primarily,
books; and a number of other
establishments thrift shops,
consignment shops, outdoor
stores, etc which keep
books on hand. Any attempt to
cover them all would be over
whelming; the following ac
count will only try to hit the
highlights.
The place to start, of course,
is on campus. The Stanford
Bookstore is both more than,
and less than, a good
bookstore. More, because half
of its floor space is given over
to office, art and engineering
supplies, clothing, candy and
cookies-, stationery, cards and
hundreds of items that say
"Stanford." The Bookstore
also stocks textbooks (up

stairs), cashes checks (on
Saturdays), orders art prints,
and does a lot of other things
most bookstores won't. If
you're looking for something
specific, the selection is very
good in most areas (particu
larly art history and literary
criticism), but the atmosphere
in the front of the store, where
the books are shelved, is such
as to force you to find the book
you want quickly and leave.
The lighting is unpleasant, and
there is no seating of any kind;
the rows of often-crowded
check-out lines make the store
resemble nothing sp much as a
supermarket. It's a good place
to find a book (they will also
order anything in print), but it
ranks low as a place forlooking
at books.
The campus is bracketed by
the area's two best "new
book" bookstores. To the

southeast, and slightly closer,
is Printers Inc. (310 California
Ave.). Printers Inc. is relatively
new (it was started by five
former Kepler's employees),
and has quickly become the
most popular place around,
largely on the strength of its
espresso bar and artsy/literary
ambiance. Printers Inc. calls it
self "the literary bookstore,"
and most nights the store is full
of professors of English, local
artist types, a few real writers,
and a lot of people trving hard
to look like they belong. This,
to my mind, is one of the
store's drawbacks; the other is
lack of ventilation. Printers Inc.
is a hot place if you're more
than 10 feet from the door. At
mospheric conditions aside,
however, Printers Inc. is a
good store, well-stocked in
most areas (hard and
softcover), and especially
strong in fiction and children's
books, with lots of chairs scat
tered around and nice carpet
ing (a rarity). Last, and best, is
the magazine selection. Scat
tered around the front of the
store are hundreds of periodi
cals; they carry everything
from Arizona Highways to Die
Zeit, and have the area's best
selection of scholarly and liter

ary journals.
Northwest of campus, along
El Camino Real in Menlo Park,
lies Kepler's. Kepler's is a local
landmark, having been a focus
for "radical" activity in the '6os.
The store has moved with the
times; its image is now com
posec of equal parts of en
vironmental awareness,
small-scale technology advo
cacy, and championship of
small and avant-garde presses.
The main bragging point at
Kepler's, as far as books go, is
its claim to be the biggest
paperback bookstore around.
This may be true you can
find almost anything there
but the sterile, shopping-mall
feel of the store's new building
(it moved a couple of years
ago) discourages browsing.
The old store didn't have the
carpeting or stained shelves of
a Printer's Inc., but sheer size
made it a nice place to browse
there were any number of
nooks and crannies to lose
yourself in. One feature that
has been carried over is an al
cove with chairs and tables
where no one bothers you
while you read and a copier
bearing a sign that asks you not
to break the spines of the
