Student bibliophiles and
bibliomaniacs are faced with an
unusual problem at Stanford. Finding
a good bookstore near campus is no
challenge; choosing is the hard part.

Between California Avenue,
in Palo Alto, and Santa Cruz
Avenue, in Menlo Park, there
are nearly 30 different stores
which sell only, or primarily,
books; and a number of other
establishments thrift shops,
consignment shops, outdoor
stores, etc which keep
books on hand. Any attempt to
cover them all would be over
whelming; the following ac
count will only try to hit the
highlights.
The place to start, of course,
is on campus. The Stanford
Bookstore is both more than,
and less than, a good
bookstore. More, because half
of its floor space is given over
to office, art and engineering
supplies, clothing, candy and
cookies-, stationery, cards and
hundreds of items that say
"Stanford." The Bookstore
also stocks textbooks (up

stairs), cashes checks (on
Saturdays), orders art prints,
and does a lot of other things
most bookstores won't. If
you're looking for something
specific, the selection is very
good in most areas (particu
larly art history and literary
criticism), but the atmosphere
in the front of the store, where
the books are shelved, is such
as to force you to find the book
you want quickly and leave.
The lighting is unpleasant, and
there is no seating of any kind;
the rows of often-crowded
check-out lines make the store
resemble nothing sp much as a
supermarket. It's a good place
to find a book (they will also
order anything in print), but it
ranks low as a place forlooking
at books.
The campus is bracketed by
the area's two best "new
book" bookstores. To the

southeast, and slightly closer,
is Printers Inc. (310 California
Ave.). Printers Inc. is relatively
new (it was started by five
former Kepler's employees),
and has quickly become the
most popular place around,
largely on the strength of its
espresso bar and artsy/literary
ambiance. Printers Inc. calls it
self "the literary bookstore,"
and most nights the store is full
of professors of English, local
artist types, a few real writers,
and a lot of people trving hard
to look like they belong. This,
to my mind, is one of the
store's drawbacks; the other is
lack of ventilation. Printers Inc.
is a hot place if you're more
than 10 feet from the door. At
mospheric conditions aside,
however, Printers Inc. is a
good store, well-stocked in
most areas (hard and
softcover), and especially
strong in fiction and children's
books, with lots of chairs scat
tered around and nice carpet
ing (a rarity). Last, and best, is
the magazine selection. Scat
tered around the front of the
store are hundreds of periodi
cals; they carry everything
from Arizona Highways to Die
Zeit, and have the area's best
selection of scholarly and liter

ary journals.
Northwest of campus, along
El Camino Real in Menlo Park,
lies Kepler's. Kepler's is a local
landmark, having been a focus
for "radical" activity in the '6os.
The store has moved with the
times; its image is now com
posec of equal parts of en
vironmental awareness,
small-scale technology advo
cacy, and championship of
small and avant-garde presses.
The main bragging point at
Kepler's, as far as books go, is
its claim to be the biggest
paperback bookstore around.
This may be true you can
find almost anything there
but the sterile, shopping-mall
feel of the store's new building
(it moved a couple of years
ago) discourages browsing.
The old store didn't have the
carpeting or stained shelves of
a Printer's Inc., but sheer size
made it a nice place to browse
there were any number of
nooks and crannies to lose
yourself in. One feature that
has been carried over is an al
cove with chairs and tables
where no one bothers you
while you read and a copier
bearing a sign that asks you not
to break the spines of the
books you xerox. Kepler's has a
magazine selection second
only to Printers Inc. among
local bookstores, and a section
devoted to small press publica
tions. Both stores are open late
most nights.
Several other "new book"
stores deserve mention. There
are three very different stores
in downtown Palo Alto: Shirley
Cobb (452 University Ave.),
Stacey's (219 University Ave.),
and Plowshare Community
f Booksellers (162 University
Ave.). Shirley Cobb is the
epitome of the small-scale,
personalized bookstore. It
stocks only hardcover, and the
selection is aimed at affluent,
educated, suburbanites. This
makes it a bit expensive, but
browsing is fun, and it's a won
derful place to shop for a gift.
The selection is rather idiosyn
cratic, perhaps reflecting the
staff's tastes, but the art,
photography, fiction, and na
ture sections are excellent.
Stacey's began as strictly a
medical/technical store, but
has expanded into most of the
general areas. The technical
areas still seem to be the
store's strength.
Plowshare was founded
about 12 years ago by a group
of Stanford graduates, and is
very community-oriented; it's
the place to go for news of en
vironmental, anti-nuclear, or
any "counter-culture" sort of
happenings. It is, at the same
time, an excellent small paper
back store, with a good fiction
selection and a children's al
cove; the back room is re
served for the sections on East
ern religions, homesteading,
etc.
Behind Macy's, in the Stan
ford Shopping Center, you'll
find Books Inc., a hardcover/
softcover store notable for its
paperback mystery and sci
ence fiction stocks and its re
mainder tables and shelves. In
the Old Mill Shopping Center,
off San Antonio Road in Moun
tain View, is Upstart Crow & Co.

This bookstore/cafe has little in
the way of books, but if you
have to be in the Old Mill it's
not a bad place to get a cup of
coffee.
There are chain stores in the
area; one should shun them as
a matter of principle, but occa
sionally a bargain can be found
on their bargain tables. Closest
to campus are B. Dalton's, in
the Stanford Shopping Center,
and Waldenbooks, on Califor
nia Ave.
A number of stores cater to
particular needs. The most
common of this type is the re
ligious bookstore. My favorite
bookstore name in the area
used to be that of the One Way
Bookstore (320 California Ave.),
a Christian shop which closed
last year. Still in business are
The Angelus (779 Santa Cruz
Ave., Menlo Park) and the
East-West Bookshop (1170 El
Camino, Menlo Park), which is
heavily into the mystic. The
most interesting store of this
type that I've found is Minerva
Books (1027 Alma, Palo Alto), a
small but very attractive store
with interesting selections in
mythology and all religions and
without the self-conscious
"mysticism" of other stores
like itself.
A distant relative of the re
ligious bookstores is the sci
ence fiction and fantasy
bookstore. Comics & Comix in
downtown Palo Alto (515
Cowper) has lots of comic
books, SF paperbacks, posters,
and magazines; its stock runs
toward sadistic porn, and the
clientele appears to be mostly
high-school age. Future Fantasy
(2033 El Camino, Palo Alto) is
smaller, but more serious.
Finally, here are three mis
cellaneous special-interest
stores. The American Opinion
Bookstore (2656 Broadway,
Redwood City) is "the peninsu
la's only conservative
bookstore." Szwede Slavic
Books (2233 El Camino, Palo
Alto) is self-explanatory. And
the closest adult bookstore to
campus is the H & R Bookstore
(on El Camino in Redwood
City), where you can also
watch movies for a quarter and
buy magazines in plastic bags

for $12.50.
If you are interested in used
books, for economy's sake or
collecting's sake, you will want
to go to Berkeley as often as
possible. Flaving said that, I
must admit that there are a
couple of stores around here
that nearly match up, the dif
ferences being mainly of size
rather than quality.
For collectors, the two most
important stores in this area
are Chimaera Books & Records
and Wessex Used Books & Re
cords. Wessex, located near
the corner of El Camino and
Santa Cruz in Menlo Park, is
strictly a used book store. The
stock is mostly hardcover, and
the specialty is modern fiction,
within which area the store is
one of the best in the Bay Area.
Wessex is a small store (two
rooms), and outside of fiction
its selection is rather skimpy.
But there are enough novels to
keep you browsing for hours,
and the prices are very reason
able, as first editions go.
Chimaera is another story en
tirely. The store takes up most
of the two-story house on the
corner of Kipling and Lytton, in
downtown Palo Alto.
After all this, there's still one
crucial issue left unresolved:
where should you go to buy
the Sunday New York Times?
The closest place, if you live on
campus, is The Store at Tresid
der; but The Store gets the
paper late and sells it out early.
Better is Printers Inc., where
you can read the paper over a
cup of French roast, assuming
you find an empty table. Best,
however, is Mac's Smoke Shop
(534 Emerson), half a block
from the Good Earth Restaur
ant in downtown Palo Alto.
Mac's is the real thing, with
magazines and drugstore
paperbacks down one wall
(starting with Barron's and end
ing with Raunch), and cigars
down the other, and old men
telling dirty jokes behind the
counter. The long, narrow
store is open to the sidewalk,
and the newspapers are right in
front; walking in and buying a
paper at Mac's is the closest
feeling in Palo Alto to being in
New York.

store is open to the sidewalk,
and the newspapers are right in
front; walking in and buying a
paper at Mac's is the closest
feeling in Palo Alto to being in
New York.
Student bibliophiles and
bibliomaniacs are faced with an
unusual problem at Stanford. Finding
a good bookstore near campus is no
challenge; choosing is the hard part.

Between California Avenue,
in Palo Alto, and Santa Cruz
Avenue, in Menlo Park, there
are nearly 30 different stores
which sell only, or primarily,
books; and a number of other
establishments thrift shops,
consignment shops, outdoor
stores, etc which keep
books on hand. Any attempt to
cover them all would be over
whelming; the following ac
count will only try to hit the
highlights.
The place to start, of course,
is on campus. The Stanford
Bookstore is both more than,
and less than, a good
bookstore. More, because half
of its floor space is given over
to office, art and engineering
supplies, clothing, candy and
cookies-, stationery, cards and
hundreds of items that say
"Stanford." The Bookstore
also stocks textbooks (up

stairs), cashes checks (on
Saturdays), orders art prints,
and does a lot of other things
most bookstores won't. If
you're looking for something
specific, the selection is very
good in most areas (particu
larly art history and literary
criticism), but the atmosphere
in the front of the store, where
the books are shelved, is such
as to force you to find the book
you want quickly and leave.
The lighting is unpleasant, and
there is no seating of any kind;
the rows of often-crowded
check-out lines make the store
resemble nothing sp much as a
supermarket. It's a good place
to find a book (they will also
order anything in print), but it
ranks low as a place forlooking
at books.
The campus is bracketed by
the area's two best "new
book" bookstores. To the

southeast, and slightly closer,
is Printers Inc. (310 California
Ave.). Printers Inc. is relatively
new (it was started by five
former Kepler's employees),
and has quickly become the
most popular place around,
largely on the strength of its
espresso bar and artsy/literary
ambiance. Printers Inc. calls it
self "the literary bookstore,"
and most nights the store is full
of professors of English, local
artist types, a few real writers,
and a lot of people trving hard
to look like they belong. This,
to my mind, is one of the
store's drawbacks; the other is
lack of ventilation. Printers Inc.
is a hot place if you're more
than 10 feet from the door. At
mospheric conditions aside,
however, Printers Inc. is a
good store, well-stocked in
most areas (hard and
softcover), and especially
strong in fiction and children's
books, with lots of chairs scat
tered around and nice carpet
ing (a rarity). Last, and best, is
the magazine selection. Scat
tered around the front of the
store are hundreds of periodi
cals; they carry everything
from Arizona Highways to Die
Zeit, and have the area's best
selection of scholarly and liter

ary journals.
Northwest of campus, along
El Camino Real in Menlo Park,
lies Kepler's. Kepler's is a local
landmark, having been a focus
for "radical" activity in the '6os.
The store has moved with the
times; its image is now com
posec of equal parts of en
vironmental awareness,
small-scale technology advo
cacy, and championship of
small and avant-garde presses.
The main bragging point at
Kepler's, as far as books go, is
its claim to be the biggest
paperback bookstore around.
This may be true you can
find almost anything there
but the sterile, shopping-mall
feel of the store's new building
(it moved a couple of years
ago) discourages browsing.
The old store didn't have the
carpeting or stained shelves of
a Printer's Inc., but sheer size
made it a nice place to browse
there were any number of
nooks and crannies to lose
yourself in. One feature that
has been carried over is an al
cove with chairs and tables
where no one bothers you
while you read and a copier
bearing a sign that asks you not
to break the spines of the
books you xerox. Kepler's has a
magazine selection second
only to Printers Inc. among
local bookstores, and a section
devoted to small press publica
tions. Both stores are open late
most nights.
Several other "new book"
stores deserve mention. There
are three very different stores
in downtown Palo Alto: Shirley
Cobb (452 University Ave.),
Stacey's (219 University Ave.),
and Plowshare Community
f Booksellers (162 University
Ave.). Shirley Cobb is the
epitome of the small-scale,
personalized bookstore. It
stocks only hardcover, and the
selection is aimed at affluent,
educated, suburbanites. This
makes it a bit expensive, but
browsing is fun, and it's a won
derful place to shop for a gift.
The selection is rather idiosyn
cratic, perhaps reflecting the
staff's tastes, but the art,
photography, fiction, and na
ture sections are excellent.
Stacey's began as strictly a
medical/technical store, but
has expanded into most of the
general areas. The technical
areas still seem to be the
store's strength.
Plowshare was founded
about 12 years ago by a group
of Stanford graduates, and is
very community-oriented; it's
the place to go for news of en
vironmental, anti-nuclear, or
any "counter-culture" sort of
happenings. It is, at the same
time, an excellent small paper
back store, with a good fiction
selection and a children's al
cove; the back room is re
served for the sections on East
ern religions, homesteading,
etc.
Behind Macy's, in the Stan
ford Shopping Center, you'll
find Books Inc., a hardcover/
softcover store notable for its
paperback mystery and sci
ence fiction stocks and its re
mainder tables and shelves. In
the Old Mill Shopping Center,
off San Antonio Road in Moun
tain View, is Upstart Crow & Co.

This bookstore/cafe has little in
the way of books, but if you
have to be in the Old Mill it's
not a bad place to get a cup of
coffee.
There are chain stores in the
area; one should shun them as
a matter of principle, but occa
sionally a bargain can be found
on their bargain tables. Closest
to campus are B. Dalton's, in
the Stanford Shopping Center,
and Waldenbooks, on Califor
nia Ave.
A number of stores cater to
particular needs. The most
common of this type is the re
ligious bookstore. My favorite
bookstore name in the area
used to be that of the One Way
Bookstore (320 California Ave.),
a Christian shop which closed
last year. Still in business are
The Angelus (779 Santa Cruz
Ave., Menlo Park) and the
East-West Bookshop (1170 El
Camino, Menlo Park), which is
heavily into the mystic. The
most interesting store of this
type that I've found is Minerva
Books (1027 Alma, Palo Alto), a
small but very attractive store
with interesting selections in
mythology and all religions and
without the self-conscious
"mysticism" of other stores
like itself.
A distant relative of the re
ligious bookstores is the sci
ence fiction and fantasy
bookstore. Comics & Comix in
downtown Palo Alto (515
Cowper) has lots of comic
books, SF paperbacks, posters,
and magazines; its stock runs
toward sadistic porn, and the
clientele appears to be mostly
high-school age. Future Fantasy
(2033 El Camino, Palo Alto) is
smaller, but more serious.
Finally, here are three mis
cellaneous special-interest
stores. The American Opinion
Bookstore (2656 Broadway,
Redwood City) is "the peninsu
la's only conservative
bookstore." Szwede Slavic
Books (2233 El Camino, Palo
Alto) is self-explanatory. And
the closest adult bookstore to
campus is the H & R Bookstore
(on El Camino in Redwood
City), where you can also
watch movies for a quarter and
buy magazines in plastic bags

for $12.50.
If you are interested in used
books, for economy's sake or
collecting's sake, you will want
to go to Berkeley as often as
possible. Flaving said that, I
must admit that there are a
couple of stores around here
that nearly match up, the dif
ferences being mainly of size
rather than quality.
For collectors, the two most
important stores in this area
are Chimaera Books & Records
and Wessex Used Books & Re
cords. Wessex, located near
the corner of El Camino and
Santa Cruz in Menlo Park, is
strictly a used book store. The
stock is mostly hardcover, and
the specialty is modern fiction,
within which area the store is
one of the best in the Bay Area.
Wessex is a small store (two
rooms), and outside of fiction
its selection is rather skimpy.
But there are enough novels to
keep you browsing for hours,
and the prices are very reason
able, as first editions go.
Chimaera is another story en
tirely. The store takes up most
of the two-story house on the
corner of Kipling and Lytton, in
downtown Palo Alto.
After all this, there's still one
crucial issue left unresolved:
where should you go to buy
the Sunday New York Times?
The closest place, if you live on
campus, is The Store at Tresid
der; but The Store gets the
paper late and sells it out early.
Better is Printers Inc., where
you can read the paper over a
cup of French roast, assuming
you find an empty table. Best,
however, is Mac's Smoke Shop
(534 Emerson), half a block
from the Good Earth Restaur
ant in downtown Palo Alto.
Mac's is the real thing, with
magazines and drugstore
paperbacks down one wall
(starting with Barron's and end
ing with Raunch), and cigars
down the other, and old men
telling dirty jokes behind the
counter. The long, narrow
store is open to the sidewalk,
and the newspapers are right in
front; walking in and buying a
paper at Mac's is the closest
feeling in Palo Alto to being in
New York.

(starting with Barron's and end
ing with Raunch), and cigars
down the other, and old men
telling dirty jokes behind the
counter. The long, narrow
store is open to the sidewalk,
and the newspapers are right in
front; walking in and buying a
paper at Mac's is the closest
feeling in Palo Alto to being in
New York.
Student bibliophiles and
bibliomaniacs are faced with an
unusual problem at Stanford. Finding
a good bookstore near campus is no
challenge; choosing is the hard part.

Between California Avenue,
in Palo Alto, and Santa Cruz
Avenue, in Menlo Park, there
are nearly 30 different stores
which sell only, or primarily,
books; and a number of other
establishments thrift shops,
consignment shops, outdoor
stores, etc which keep
books on hand. Any attempt to
cover them all would be over
whelming; the following ac
count will only try to hit the
highlights.
The place to start, of course,
is on campus. The Stanford
Bookstore is both more than,
and less than, a good
bookstore. More, because half
of its floor space is given over
to office, art and engineering
supplies, clothing, candy and
cookies-, stationery, cards and
hundreds of items that say
"Stanford." The Bookstore
also stocks textbooks (up

stairs), cashes checks (on
Saturdays), orders art prints,
and does a lot of other things
most bookstores won't. If
you're looking for something
specific, the selection is very
good in most areas (particu
larly art history and literary
criticism), but the atmosphere
in the front of the store, where
the books are shelved, is such
as to force you to find the book
you want quickly and leave.
The lighting is unpleasant, and
there is no seating of any kind;
the rows of often-crowded
check-out lines make the store
resemble nothing sp much as a
supermarket. It's a good place
to find a book (they will also
order anything in print), but it
ranks low as a place forlooking
at books.
The campus is bracketed by
the area's two best "new
book" bookstores. To the

southeast, and slightly closer,
is Printers Inc. (310 California
Ave.). Printers Inc. is relatively
new (it was started by five
former Kepler's employees),
and has quickly become the
most popular place around,
largely on the strength of its
espresso bar and artsy/literary
ambiance. Printers Inc. calls it
self "the literary bookstore,"
and most nights the store is full
of professors of English, local
artist types, a few real writers,
and a lot of people trving hard
to look like they belong. This,
to my mind, is one of the
store's drawbacks; the other is
lack of ventilation. Printers Inc.
is a hot place if you're more
than 10 feet from the door. At
mospheric conditions aside,
however, Printers Inc. is a
good store, well-stocked in
most areas (hard and
softcover), and especially
strong in fiction and children's
books, with lots of chairs scat
tered around and nice carpet
ing (a rarity). Last, and best, is
the magazine selection. Scat
tered around the front of the
store are hundreds of periodi
cals; they carry everything
from Arizona Highways to Die
Zeit, and have the area's best
selection of scholarly and liter

ary journals.
Northwest of campus, along
El Camino Real in Menlo Park,
lies Kepler's. Kepler's is a local
landmark, having been a focus
for "radical" activity in the '6os.
The store has moved with the
times; its image is now com
posec of equal parts of en
vironmental awareness,
small-scale technology advo
cacy, and championship of
small and avant-garde presses.
The main bragging point at
Kepler's, as far as books go, is
its claim to be the biggest
paperback bookstore around.
This may be true you can
find almost anything there
but the sterile, shopping-mall
feel of the store's new building
(it moved a couple of years
ago) discourages browsing.
The old store didn't have the
carpeting or stained shelves of
a Printer's Inc., but sheer size
made it a nice place to browse
there were any number of
nooks and crannies to lose
yourself in. One feature that
has been carried over is an al
cove with chairs and tables
where no one bothers you
while you read and a copier
bearing a sign that asks you not
to break the spines of the
books you xerox. Kepler's has a
magazine selection second
only to Printers Inc. among
local bookstores, and a section
devoted to small press publica
tions. Both stores are open late
most nights.
Several other "new book"
stores deserve mention. There
are three very different stores
in downtown Palo Alto: Shirley
Cobb (452 University Ave.),
Stacey's (219 University Ave.),
and Plowshare Community
f Booksellers (162 University
Ave.). Shirley Cobb is the
epitome of the small-scale,
personalized bookstore. It
stocks only hardcover, and the
selection is aimed at affluent,
educated, suburbanites. This
makes it a bit expensive, but
browsing is fun, and it's a won
derful place to shop for a gift.
The selection is rather idiosyn
cratic, perhaps reflecting the
staff's tastes, but the art,
photography, fiction, and na
ture sections are excellent.
Stacey's began as strictly a
medical/technical store, but
has expanded into most of the
general areas. The technical
areas still seem to be the
store's strength.
Plowshare was founded
about 12 years ago by a group
of Stanford graduates, and is
very community-oriented; it's
the place to go for news of en
vironmental, anti-nuclear, or
any "counter-culture" sort of
happenings. It is, at the same
time, an excellent small paper
back store, with a good fiction
selection and a children's al
cove; the back room is re
served for the sections on East
ern religions, homesteading,
etc.
Behind Macy's, in the Stan
ford Shopping Center, you'll
find Books Inc., a hardcover/
softcover store notable for its
paperback mystery and sci
ence fiction stocks and its re
mainder tables and shelves. In
the Old Mill Shopping Center,
off San Antonio Road in Moun
tain View, is Upstart Crow & Co.

This bookstore/cafe has little in
the way of books, but if you
have to be in the Old Mill it's
not a bad place to get a cup of
coffee.
There are chain stores in the
area; one should shun them as
a matter of principle, but occa
sionally a bargain can be found
on their bargain tables. Closest
to campus are B. Dalton's, in
the Stanford Shopping Center,
and Waldenbooks, on Califor
nia Ave.
A number of stores cater to
particular needs. The most
common of this type is the re
ligious bookstore. My favorite
bookstore name in the area
used to be that of the One Way
Bookstore (320 California Ave.),
a Christian shop which closed
last year. Still in business are
The Angelus (779 Santa Cruz
Ave., Menlo Park) and the
East-West Bookshop (1170 El
Camino, Menlo Park), which is
heavily into the mystic. The
most interesting store of this
type that I've found is Minerva
Books (1027 Alma, Palo Alto), a
small but very attractive store
with interesting selections in
mythology and all religions and
without the self-conscious
"mysticism" of other stores
like itself.
A distant relative of the re
ligious bookstores is the sci
ence fiction and fantasy
bookstore. Comics & Comix in
downtown Palo Alto (515
Cowper) has lots of comic
books, SF paperbacks, posters,
and magazines; its stock runs
toward sadistic porn, and the
clientele appears to be mostly
high-school age. Future Fantasy
(2033 El Camino, Palo Alto) is
smaller, but more serious.
Finally, here are three mis
cellaneous special-interest
stores. The American Opinion
Bookstore (2656 Broadway,
Redwood City) is "the peninsu
la's only conservative
bookstore." Szwede Slavic
Books (2233 El Camino, Palo
Alto) is self-explanatory. And
the closest adult bookstore to
campus is the H & R Bookstore
(on El Camino in Redwood
City), where you can also
watch movies for a quarter and
buy magazines in plastic bags

for $12.50.
If you are interested in used
books, for economy's sake or
collecting's sake, you will want
to go to Berkeley as often as
possible. Flaving said that, I
must admit that there are a
couple of stores around here
that nearly match up, the dif
ferences being mainly of size
rather than quality.
For collectors, the two most
important stores in this area
are Chimaera Books & Records
and Wessex Used Books & Re
cords. Wessex, located near
the corner of El Camino and
Santa Cruz in Menlo Park, is
strictly a used book store. The
stock is mostly hardcover, and
the specialty is modern fiction,
within which area the store is
one of the best in the Bay Area.
Wessex is a small store (two
rooms), and outside of fiction
its selection is rather skimpy.
But there are enough novels to
keep you browsing for hours,
and the prices are very reason
able, as first editions go.
Chimaera is another story en
tirely. The store takes up most
of the two-story house on the
corner of Kipling and Lytton, in
downtown Palo Alto.
After all this, there's still one
crucial issue left unresolved:
where should you go to buy
the Sunday New York Times?
The closest place, if you live on
campus, is The Store at Tresid
der; but The Store gets the
paper late and sells it out early.
Better is Printers Inc., where
you can read the paper over a
cup of French roast, assuming
you find an empty table. Best,
however, is Mac's Smoke Shop
(534 Emerson), half a block
from the Good Earth Restaur
ant in downtown Palo Alto.
Mac's is the real thing, with
magazines and drugstore
paperbacks down one wall
(starting with Barron's and end
ing with Raunch), and cigars
down the other, and old men
telling dirty jokes behind the
counter. The long, narrow
store is open to the sidewalk,
and the newspapers are right in
front; walking in and buying a
paper at Mac's is the closest
feeling in Palo Alto to being in
New York.
