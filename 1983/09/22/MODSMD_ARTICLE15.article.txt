Keeping track of Bay Area art what is being done and what is being
exhibited is the hardest job of all for the culture hound. Outside of a few
major museums, art is the least publicized aspect of cultural life. Adding to
the problem is the number of small galleries, especially in San Francisco,
that stage consistently important events which are short-lived and
under-publicized.

Keeping track of Bay Area art
what is being done, and
what is being exhibited is
the hardest job of all for the
culture hound. Outside of a
few major museums, art is the
least publicized aspect of the
local cultural life. Adding to the
problem is the number of small
galleries, especially in San
Francisco, many of which stage
consistently important exhibits
which last a month or less and
which you won't know about
unless you seek them out. Be
cause of the vast number of
places in the area which exhibit
art, the following account is
destined to be highly arbitrary;
I only hope to point out a few
of the more important venues.
The Stanford Art Depart
ment maintains both the Stan
ford Museum of Art and the
Stanford Art Gallery. The
Museum's permanent collec
tion is a marvelous resource for

students; all periods of Euro
pean art are represented, and
there are rooms devoted to
Greek and Roman, Asian, and
Oceanic art as well. There is a
large gallery devoted to Stan
ford family memorabilia. The
Museum's main claim to fame
is its renowned Rodin collec
tion, which is housed in a spe
cial rotunda within the
museum (as well as in various
outdoor spots on campus). The
museum's upstairs balconies,
and the Meidel room, hold
special exhibits; among this
year's temporary shows will be
an exhibit of Gisele Freund's
photographs of French artists
and writers, and a group of
17th-century Dutch paintings
from a Bay Area private collec
tion.
The Stanford Gallery, snug
gled in between the Business
School, Hoover Tower, the Art
Building and the History
corner of the Quad, holds
rotating exhibits throughout
the year, including the annual
show of work by candidates for
the Master of Fine Arts degree.
In December Art Prof. Keith
Boyle will have a one-man
show in the gallery. The gallery
building also houses the Gal

lery Bookshop, which sells art
books, cards and posters.
A number of other places on
campus hang exhibits more or
less regularly. STARTS (Student
Arts at Stanford) puts on
monthly exhibits in the Cof
feehouse, mainly of student
photography, and in the up
stairs lobby of Tresidder Un
ion. The Bechtel International
Center puts on exhibits with in
ternational, often Third World,
themes.
San Francisco is home to
four major museums, three of
which are under common
management. These three, the
"Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco," are the M.H. de
Young Memorial Museum and
the Asian Art Museum (both in
the same building in Golden
Gate Park) and the California
Palace of the Legion of Honor
(Lincoln Park). The de Young's
collection, which encompas
ses Western art from the
Greeks and Romans to early
20th-century European and
American, isn't particularly
noteworthy (i.e., one visit is
enough), but the museum
plays host to many of the top
national traveling exhibits in
recent years San Francisco

money has brought the Tut,
Tiffany, Alexander, etc., shows
to the de Young. The Asian Art
Museum has one of the best
permanent collections in its
field in this country; unfortu
nately, there isn't enough y
room on the walls for more
than a fraction of it. The collec
tion is constantly rotated. The
collection of the Palace of the
Legion of Honor is composed
entirely of French art, from
medieval tapestries to a room
of impressionists and post
impressionists. In the base
ment of the Legion is the
museums' Graphic Arts de
partment, which puts up rotat
ing exhibits of prints and draw
ings. The Legion also draws
big-name temporary exhibits
the Phillips collection and
the Dresden exhibit have been
there in recent years.
Temporary exhibits cur
rently housed in the Fine Arts
Museums are: at the Asian,
"Treasures of the Shanghai
Museum: 6000 years of
Chinese Art"; at the de Young,
a traveling show of Pennsyl
vania German art assembled by
Delaware's Winterthur
