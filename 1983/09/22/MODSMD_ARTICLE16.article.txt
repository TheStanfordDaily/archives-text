# Variety is key to music on the farm
## 
### 
Music is the hardest enter
tainment category to pin
down, because it encompasses
everything from the San Fran
cisco Opera to the Keystone
Palo Alto, with room in bet
ween for Bach societies and
Rolling Stones concerts in
Candlestick Park. At the same
time, the local music scene is
less monolithic than the thea
ter; in any given genre of
r music, it is possible to keep
track of what's happening, and
even to attend a good propor
tion of the relevant events.
Most musical performers
spend their time traveling; the
best way to describe local mus
ical offerings is in terms of or
ganizers, who tend to stay in
one place. On campus, the
most visible of these organiz
ers is the Lively Arts at Stanford.
While the Lively Arts program
contains a variety of events, in
cluding dance companies,
films and lectures, and (occa
sionally) drama, the bulk of the
schedule is made up of musical
acts. This year the Lively Arts is
bringing to campus a number
of soloists pianists Peter
Serkin and Cecile Licad,
guitarist Julian Bream, cellist
Carter Brey and violinist Ana
Kavafian, to name a few and
chamber groups the Emer
son, Guarneri and Concord
quartets, the Borodin Trio, etc.
and miscellaneous other
acts, including the fabulous
Pilobolus dance company. All
Lively Arts concerts take place
either in Memorial Auditorium
or Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
depending on their drawing
power.
The Stanford Music Depart
ment sponsors a full season of
performances throughout the
school year, featuring campus
groups and performers. Many
of the department's students
give recitals in the upstairs
lounges at Tresidder which are
open to the public. Orchestral
ensembles, including the Stan
ford Symphony and Chamber
Orchestras and the Stanford
Baroque Ensemble, and the
University's vocal groups, the
Chorus and Chorale, give per
formances in Dinkelspiel and
the Church. The Tresidder re
citals are free; the ensemble
performances are cheap f Qr
students. One of the nicer
Stanford traditions is the yearly
Messiah Sing, held at the end
of each fall quarter in Memorial
Church. This year's sing is

scheduled for Dec. 11. A new
event this year is a Music Dept.
opera production, scheduled
for sometime in May.
The Bay Area is known as a
hotbed of "new" music. Stan
ford's contribution to this is
the Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics,
located at 1600 Arastradero
Road between Page Mill and
Alpine Roads. The CCRMA
gives periodic performances of
its latest compositions, in the
evening under the open sky
(either at its own facility, or in
Frost Amphitheatre). They
suggest you bring a blanket.
The Music Department pub
lishes a quarterly calendar of
events, which can be obtained
from it or at the Tresidder In
formation Desk. If you wish to
buy tickets for an event in ad
vance, go to the Tresidder Tic
ket Office.
STARTS (Student Arts st Stan
ford) is a student group, head
quartered in Tresidder, which
works to involve students in
the arts. They sponsor a truly
wide variety of things: lec
tures, art exhibits, excursions
around the Bay Area, classes in
calligraphy, dancing, music,
etc., and large-scale events
such as the Stanford Christmas
Faire and the Plant and Poster
Sale (which should be going on
right now). And, of course,
music: noon concerts on the
Tresidder patio, featuring local
rock and jazz groups, "Classi
cal Cafe" and other programs
in the Coffee House, and live
music several nights a week at
Encina Station.
At an institution that doesn't
have many "institutions" of its
own, the Stanford Savoyards
stand out. This will be the
Savoyards'ninth season of per
forming Gilbert & Sullivan
operettas in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. The Savoyards
membership is drawn from all
parts of the University: stu- *
dents, faculty, staff, and com
munity members work to
gether to put on the shows.
This only covers the more
formal, institutionalized, in
stances of music on campus.
Other sorts of events happen
all the time. Big-name rock
concerts occasionally come off
in Frost Amphitheatre the
Beach Boys and Pablo Cruise
will play Oct. 1 and Santana
Oct. 2. Another musical possi
bility is dorm and frat parties;


The Concord String Quartet
