# 'The play's the thing' at Ashland
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
It's a long trip, but if you
love Shakespeare, it's worth
every mile.
The Oregon Shakespeare
Festival is held just over
the Oregon border in the
small town of Ashland. The
drive up Interstate Five is in
credibly long and, except
for Mt. Shasta, incredibly
unremarkable. You do get
to see Weed town men
tioned in Steinbeck's Can
nery Row, and Redding and
Project City but other than
that, it's the typical hot, dry
California landscape for
four or five hundred miles.
But what you go to see is
Shakespeare—some of the
best Shakespeare anywhere
outside of the 16th century.
Bard-lovers from all over
the country flock to Ash
land's three theatres to see

top-flight productions of
plays both by Shakespeare
and his contemporaries and
the would-be Shakespeares
of the last two centuries.
The main stage for the fes
tival is a re-creation of the
original venue for Shakes
peare's work, the Globe
theatre near London. Adja
cent to both a road and a
park, the Ashland theatre
suffers from honking cars
and quacking ducks, but the
power of the plays elimi
nates most distractions.
But because the weather
in Ashland turns cold in
early September, this sea
son's outdoor offerings—
Richard 111, Much Ado
About Nothing and
Cymabline —closed last
week.
However, the ultra
modern indoor Angus

Bowmer indoor theatre re
mains open throughout Oc
tober with rotating festival
productions of Shakes
peare's Hamlet, Joe Orton's
farce, What the Butler Saw,
Eugene O'Neill's comedy,
Ah, Wilderness! and a new
adaptation of Dracula.
Although the Festival
tends to play things safe on
its giant outdoor stage,
there are some surprises
occasionally in the Bowmer
theatre.
Last year's production of
Julius Caesar, for instance,
was set in a 20th century
middle-east country, com
plete with desert terrorists
and a female Cassius. A
production of Arthur Mil
ler's Death of a Salesman a
few years back was powered
by echoing electronic
sounds to make for a

frightening overall perfor
mance.
The tiny Black Swan—it
seats only about 50—theatre
usually hosts smaller pow
erful dramas. This year is no
exception. Long-time festi
val actor Stuart Duckworth
presents the world pre
miere of his own play,
Dreamhouse, at the Black
Swan this year. Also playing
at the intimate theatre are
Shaw's Don Juan in Hell and
John Osborne's The Enter
tainer.
Tickets for the Ashland
plays aren't cheap. But stu
dents do get discounts at
certain matinees and stu
dents rush tickets are avail
able just before show-time
for many of the plays. For
tickets or more information,
call the festival at (503) 483-
4331. -
