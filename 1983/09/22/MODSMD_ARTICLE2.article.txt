# Mental health: challenged or overwhelmed

As a health center, Cowell is
concerned with students'
blood pressures and illnesses
and questions about their
physical health. But Cowell is
also concerned with how stu
dents feel about themselves.
How a student feels about
himself reflects on how that
student deals with his envi
ronment, relationships, and
academics.
That's why the results of the
survey which pertain to this
concern are so interesting
and so important.
• 84 percent of the students
said they feel satisfied with
themselves.
• 83 percent of the students
said they often feel energetic.
• 26 percent of the students
reported that they often feel
lonely.

• 47 percent of the students
said they often feel anxious or
tense.
• 22 percent said they often
feel tired wihout any apparent
reason.
• 10 percent said they often
feel "so depressed it is hard to
get going."
• 57 percent reported that
they often feel overwhelmed
by the things they have to do.
A profile emerges. The
majority of students feel ener
getic and satisfied and not
lonely, depressed, or tired
without reason. But is of con
cern to us that 10 to 25 percent
do not feel good about them
selves or feel lonely often.
The number of students who
feel anxious or tense and over

whelmed by things to do is
striking. This relects a level of
what students generically call
"stress" and deserves some at
tention here.
Althouth everyone probably
experiences tension and a
sense of being overwhelmed
periodically, the high fre
quency of stress for a majority
of students camnot be over
looked as one barometer of
mental health on campus.
Universities which educate
students for highly demand
ing and intense professional
roles not only attract competi
tive students, but also foster
competition. There are two is
sues here: One is how much
the University fosters an un
