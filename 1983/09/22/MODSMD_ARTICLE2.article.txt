# Mental health: challenged or overwhelmed
## 
### DORYN DAVIS CHERVIN Director, Health Promotion Program DOUGLAS DAHER Staff psychologist 
As a health center, Cowell is
concerned with students'
blood pressures and illnesses
and questions about their
physical health. But Cowell is
also concerned with how stu
dents feel about themselves.
How a student feels about
himself reflects on how that
student deals with his envi
ronment, relationships, and
academics.
That's why the results of the
survey which pertain to this
concern are so interesting
and so important.
• 84 percent of the students
said they feel satisfied with
themselves.
• 83 percent of the students
said they often feel energetic.
• 26 percent of the students
reported that they often feel
lonely.

• 47 percent of the students
said they often feel anxious or
tense.
• 22 percent said they often
feel tired wihout any apparent
reason.
• 10 percent said they often
feel "so depressed it is hard to
get going."
• 57 percent reported that
they often feel overwhelmed
by the things they have to do.
A profile emerges. The
majority of students feel ener
getic and satisfied and not
lonely, depressed, or tired
without reason. But is of con
cern to us that 10 to 25 percent
do not feel good about them
selves or feel lonely often.
The number of students who
feel anxious or tense and over

whelmed by things to do is
striking. This relects a level of
what students generically call
"stress" and deserves some at
tention here.
Althouth everyone probably
experiences tension and a
sense of being overwhelmed
periodically, the high fre
quency of stress for a majority
of students camnot be over
looked as one barometer of
mental health on campus.
Universities which educate
students for highly demand
ing and intense professional
roles not only attract competi
tive students, but also foster
competition. There are two is
sues here: One is how much

healthy, over-burdening envi
ronment for students, versus a
growth-promoting experience.
Whet is Stanford's responsibil
ity for the statistic that indi
cates that over half of the stu
dents are feeling over
whelmed'.'' What kind ol
quality of life standards is it
promoting?
The second issue involves
taking responsibility for our
personal roles in this process.
To compete involves emotion
al costs, but how much is the
individual student willing to
pay? Stress, even when high,

is not necessarily detrimental;
indeed, it is often challenging
and stimulating. However,
students must recognize the
potential emotional strain of
their present circumstances
and that they have made a con
scious choice for such a life
style in order to attain their
goals.
Often part of the dilemma in
feeling overwhelmed and anx
ious is a void in a student's
routine of any time for being
quiet, perfectly quiet, and ob
serving feelings. Students are
not being fair to themselves it
they art? not taking the time to
respond to their own emotion
al lives.

To deride if you are over
whelmed or just challenged,
ask yourself: Do you have a
regular time to stop and
recognize the types of emotions
you are feeling on any given
day? Are you familiar enough
with observing your feelings
to be able to descriptively
name the wide range of affec
tive responses you can have?
Do you have people in you
support stystem with whom to
talk about your feelings? Have
you asked, and can you confi
dently respond to, the ques
tion of how you want to be a
university student, here at
Stanford, in IHH.'t, under the
types of demands you are ex
periencing?
