# Some offbeat activities you should – or shouldn't – try
## 
### 
Most sights and experiences around the Farm
become pretty pedestrian to students after a few
months. Tourists may "ooh" and "ahh" over
Hoover Tower and Memorial Church, but for
most students these are just part of the everyday
routine.
There are a few things to do, though, when
you need a break from the ordinary. Some stu
dents get away from the sleep-study-sleep-study
grind by trying one of these activities.
The vista from the ridge near the "Dish" is
breathtaking and makes a sunrise or sunset pic
nic in the foothills a must. "Cowtipping"—
pushing over the cows that are sleeping stand
ing up—is said to be another favorite pastime,
though many say cowtipping stories are tall tales
of the "snipe hunt" genre.

Should you find yourself unable to take it all,
sunbathing at the top of the Terman Engineering
Center offers an unusual view of the campus as
well as a relaxing study break. The stairs lead
right up the roof, and the more driven among us
have even set up desks there.
If you escape both the red-shirted orientation
volunteers and your resident assistant and are
not baptised in the Stanford tradition by a
"fountain hopping" run during your first week
on the Farm, dipping in fountains such as "The
Claw" in White Plaza or "The Hoop" in front of
Green Library will cool you off during the warm
fall and spring quarters. Students have also been
known to dunk classmates in the fountains dur
ing the winter.

DISHING IT OUT: One of the best views of campus can be seen from the area around Stanford's satellite dish on the hills.
Many talk of climbing the walls around here.
Some do. Walk around the Quad on any given
sunny day and you're likely to see a fellow
student/rock climbing enthusiast clinging to the
cracks and crags of the sandstone walls. Excel
lent practice for climbing in the Sierras, some
mountaineers claim.
In the fall, Lake Lagunita is nothing but a myth
propagated by University bulletins and public
relations brochures. By spring, however, the
crater has metamorphosed into a lake. . . per
fect for a picnic breakfast on a raft at sunrise.
Lunchtime raft picnics are also nice, but are
often interrupted by out-of-control beginners in
the spring quarter wind-surfing class.
If you need a release on a sunny day, a
California hybrid—frisbee golf— will kill an af
ternoon in no time. Just pick a target and see
how many tosses of the frisbee it takes to hit the
target. Certain students have also been seen
swinging golf clubs at a whiffle ball among the
bike racks, but this is for the particularly desper
ate.
Should your shoulders get sore from frisbee

golf, or hunching over a study carrel for too
long, a jacuzzi in the "Faculty Ghetto" will
loosen up the muscles. Be courteous though—
the facility is meant for the residents of the com
plex.
A network of steam tunnels lies under the
University, and though it is illegal, "spelunking"
in the steam tunnels has become sort of a tradi
tion with sonle groups on campus. Legend has it
that one party of explorers even ordered a
Domino's pizza from a steam tunnel under the
Quad...and it was delivered!
During the week before finals—Dead
Week—groups of students, usually dormmates,
gather every evening at midnight to let the Uni
versity know how they feel. . .and let loose
therapeutic "primal screams" that echo eerily
across campus.
Another Dead Week ritual, The Paper Ball and
Airplane Accuracy Contest, was discontinued
two years ago when glass windows were instal
led in the atrium of Meyer Undergraduate Lib
rary. But in the anti-window days, a student
would place a small wastepaper basket about 20
feet in front of the loan desk, throw the inau
gural paper ball, and a shower of paper would
fall from the balconies above.

PIPE DREAMS: Although It is illegal, some students have fun crawling through the University's intricate tunnel systems.
