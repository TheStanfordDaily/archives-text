# Some offbeat activities you should – or shouldn't – try
## 
### 
Most sights and experiences around the Farm
become pretty pedestrian to students after a few
months. Tourists may "ooh" and "ahh" over
Hoover Tower and Memorial Church, but for
most students these are just part of the everyday
routine.
There are a few things to do, though, when
you need a break from the ordinary. Some stu
dents get away from the sleep-study-sleep-study
grind by trying one of these activities.
The vista from the ridge near the "Dish" is
breathtaking and makes a sunrise or sunset pic
nic in the foothills a must. "Cowtipping"—
pushing over the cows that are sleeping stand
ing up—is said to be another favorite pastime,
though many say cowtipping stories are tall tales
of the "snipe hunt" genre.

Should you find yourself unable to take it all,
sunbathing at the top of theTerman Engineering
Center offers an unusual view of the campus as
well as a relaxing study break. The stairs lead
right up the roof, and the more driven among us
have even set up desks there.
If you escape both the red-shirted orientation
volunteers and your resident assistant and are
not baptised in the Stanford tradition by a
"fountain hopping" run during your first week
on the Farm, dipping in fountains such as "The
Claw" in White Plaza or "The Hoop" in front of
Green Library will cool you off during the warm
fall and spring quarters. Students have also been
known to dunk classmates in the fountains dur
ing the winter.

DISHING IT OUT: One of the best views of campus can be seen from the area around Stanford's satellite dish on the hills.
