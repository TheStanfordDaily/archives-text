# The

### KATHY OLMSTED 
After all the Orientation
trips, dances and par
ties, it hits you.
t- All of the sudden, you realize
'"that you have to sign up for
classes, and you haven't the
faintest idea what to take.
Luckily (or unfortunately,
on your point of
k'iew), the University has made
decisions for you. Writ
ing, foreign language and
-western culture requirements
Chave to be taken care of first.
Butyou'll still have a number
â€¢;of free units to dispose of as
;you wish. Following is a short
rand by no means comprehen
sive list of recommended clas
ses. Some are universally
-popular, some are "sleepers"
Ithat haven't hit the big time
lyet. Hopefully this list avoids
"Prof. Blank is a great lec
turer and everyone loved his

class" syrup of the ASSU
Course Guide, but allowances
must be made for personal
opinions.
Art 001: Introduction to Art.
Albert Elsen. This topical intro
ductory course, taught by the
distinguished and opinionated
Haas professor of art history,
is a popular fall quarter class.
Students intending to enroll in

any other art history courses
should plan to take this one
first.
Civil Engineering 170: Envi
ronment Science and Technol
ogy. Gil Masters. A tremend
ously popular, non-technical
introduction to the causes and
effects of environmental pollu
tion. The course covers issues
like over-population and food

that prospective international
relations or political science
majors might enjoy studying
from a scientific perspective.
English 173A: Shakespeare.
Ronald Rebholz. Even if you
took Shakespeare in high
school, this class is worth a re

peat performance. You may
have read the plays already,
but this class will inevitably
bring new insights to your un
derstanding of the Bard. The
class is taught every quarter,
but different plays are studied
each term so make sure you're
interested in the plays
scheduled for that segment.
Ronald Rebholz, who teaches
the class in the fall, has a repu
tation for a colorful, opinion
ated lecturing style, and a vast
knowledge of the plays; his
classes are always large. Read
ings of selected scenes are
scheduled at the end of each
week. When you take this
class, all the world's a stage.
History 91: Traditional East
Asian Civilization. Bill Lyell and
Lyman Van Slyke. The profes

sors complement each other
perfectly: Lyell is highly enter
taining but his lectures some
times lack organization; Van
Slyke is more didactic but also
more organized. The course
also fulfills the Area 3 distribu
tion requirement. The class

begins with a look into the de
velopment of civilization in
early China and ends with
Neo-Confucianism. Lyell
lapses into Chinese at times,
but on the whole the course is
geared to the non-specialist.
History 172A:America Since
1945. Barton Bernstein. Prof.
Bernstein is loved and hated,
but always admired. The re
visionist historian is one of the
nhost well-organized and
dynamic lecturers on cam
pus. Just about everyone I
talked to agreed that this was
one of their favorite courses.
Arrogant or not, Bernstein
certainly gets you thinking.
Beware: the reading is formid
able and the grading even
tougher. And don't schedule a
class right afterwards: Berns

tein has been known to lecture
overtime frequently.
Human Biology 10: Human
Sexuality. Herant Katchadou
rian. Lively lectures and guest
speakers combined with the
satisfaction of the everything
you-always-wanted syndrome
make this one very popular
course here.
Political Science 001: Major
Issues of American Public Policy.
Hubert Marshall. This class is a
fuzzy classic. Prof. Marshall's
dynamic lecturing style, his in
sights. on the Vietnam War and

his accessibility combine to
make this a "must" class. Be
prepared to do lots of reading,
including a large amount of
Alexis de Toqueville. But also
be prepared to know a lot more
about poverty, monopoly and
foreign policy than you did at
the beginning.
Political Science 138A,B:
Arms Control and Disarmament.
John Lewis. This course is
taught by interdisciplinary fa
culty and enlivened by fre

quent guest lecturers frongfc
Washington and the United
Nations. The comprehensive
and thought-provoking class is
very difficult, requiring the
memorization of a number of
acronyms, but all your effort is
rewarded.
Psychology 001: General
Psychology. Philip Zimbardo.
One of the most popular
courses on campus, Zimbar
do's class is particularly re
nowned for its i nnovative grad
ing policy. After reading each
chapter, students take a short

chapter test administered in a
proctor's home. If they don't
pass, they take it again. Stu
dents trying for an 'A' also must
pass an oral test on Zimbardo's
Shyness book and pass a wrijjp
ten examination on the lec
tures at the end of the term.
More than 90 percent usually
get A's. Zimbardo puts a little
life into the often dull subject
of introductory psychology
by scheduling attention

Barton Bernstein is
loved and hated,
but always
admired. Arrogant
or not, he certainly
gets you thinking.

The distinguished
and opinionated
Albert Elsen is one
of the world's
foremost experts
on Rodin.

Hubert Marshall's*
dynamic lecturing
style, his insights
on the Viet Nam
war and his
accessibility
combine to make
Poli. Sci. 001 a
"must" course.
