# A
						guide to the libraries
## 
### 
During the first week on
campus, most new students
are so busy meeting their
roommates, going to orienta
tion activities, buying books,
and worrying about classes,
that they just never get around
to taking the twenty minute
guided tour of Meyer Under
graduate Library.
"Hey, I thought this was
supposed to be about diver
sions" you may have just said,
"why would they start en
couraging me to go to the lib
rary?"
Well, you may soon find that
the only time you find books
you'd like to read for pleasure
is when you're hunched over
in a corner trying to get a prob
lem set done or finish reserve
reading. Or you may find that
you want to get involved in an
activity that requires a little

background information. So
think of this as fuel for your
diversions.
The 11 University lib
raries and six coordinate lib
raries here present students
with a vast store of information
including manuscripts, maps,
sound recordings, periodicals,
microtexts, photographs, gov
ernment documents, and over
four and one-half million
books.
About half of all library staf
fers here work at Green Lib
rary. Green contains a general
reference service, the Univer
sity Archives, the current
Periodicals and Microtexts
room, the Government docu
ments collection, the Central
Map collection, Special collec
tions, and the main research
collection of the University lib
raries.

In Special collections,
stance, students can examine
such diverse materials as
Shakespeare's folios and the
personal correspondence of
writers like John Steinbeck.
Green also is one of the
more modern libraries here
(the East Wing was completed
in 1980) and students must
show their student identifica
tion to gain admittance to the
library.
Inside Green Library there
are lockers, study carrels,
countless shelves of books,
and incredibly comfortable
chairs. Since Green has
space than all the other ill
raries on campus, there is usu
ally a good chance of finding a
free semi-isolated desk orchair
at which to do serious study
ing.
