# A 						guide to the libraries
## 
### 
During the first week on
campus, most new students
are so busy meeting their
roommates, going to orienta
tion activities, buying books,
and worrying about classes,
that they just never get around
to taking the twenty minute
guided tour of Meyer Under
graduate Library.
"Hey, I thought this was
supposed to be about diver
sions" you may have just said,
"why would they start en
couraging me to go to the lib
rary?"
Well, you may soon find that
the only time you find books
you'd like to read for pleasure
is when you're hunched over
in a corner trying to get a prob
lem set done or finish reserve
reading. Or you may find that
you want to get involved in an
activity that requires a little

background information. So
think of this as fuel for your
diversions.
The 11 University lib
raries and six coordinate lib
raries here present students
with a vast store of information
including manuscripts, maps,
sound recordings, periodicals,
microtexts, photographs, gov
ernment documents, and over
four and one-half million
books.
About half of all library staf
fers here work at Green Lib
rary. Green contains a general
reference service, the Univer
sity Archives, the current
Periodicals and Microtexts
room, the Government docu
ments collection, the Central
Map collection, Special collec
tions, and the main research
collection of the University lib
raries.

In Special collections,
stance, students can examine
such diverse materials as
Shakespeare's folios and the
personal correspondence of
writers like John Steinbeck.
Green also is one of the
more modern libraries here
(the East Wing was completed
in 1980) and students must
show their student identifica
tion to gain admittance to the
library.
Inside Green Library there
are lockers, study carrels,
countless shelves of books,
and incredibly comfortable
chairs. Since Green has
space than all the other ill
raries on campus, there is usu
ally a good chance of finding a
free semi-isolated desk orchair
at which to do serious study
ing.

Meyer Library
Meyer Undergraduate Lib
rary, affectionately known as
UGLY, contains language
laboratories, audio visual ser
vices, a periodicals room, an
exam file (copies of mid-term
and final exams for various
classes) lockers and carrels,
and is where one obtains any
materials placed on reserve for
class reading. Meyer also
houses the Learning Assistance
Center.
Meyer has several Copicard
copying machines, electric and
manual typewriters and cal
culators. Because it houses the
reserve reading materials,
Meyer Library is not as quiet or
uncrawaed as Green.
Art and Architecture Lib
ra*, in the Nathan Cummings
Art Building contains books on
art and architectural history,
paintings, a special collection
on Chinese art, sculpture and
graphic art.
The Frederic M. Falconer
Biology Library, on the third
floor of Herrin Hall in the

Biological Sciences Center,
holds various materials in
botany, zoology and experi
mental fields of biology.
The Swain Library of Chemis
try, in Room One of the
Chemistry building, has books
on chemistry, and materials
about chemical and petroleum
industries. The Cubberley Lib
rary of Education, on the sec
ond floor of the Education
building, offers books, docu
ments, periodicals, pamphlets,
microforms, dissertations and
other materials on education.
The Branner Earth Sciences
Library, on the second floor of
the Mitchell Earth Sciences
building has materials in geol

ogy, geophysics, mineral en
gineering, and petroleum en
gineering, geological maps,
U.S. Geological Survey topog
raphical sheets, and a stunning
mineral collection. (The only
drawback to this library is the
seemingly sub-zero tempera
tures in the winter. Warm days
outside, however, make it a
great place to study when you
are seeking air conditioning.
The Engineering Library, in
the Terman Engineering build
ing, has books on engineering,
and the Guggenheim Space
Sciences Library, containing
collections in aeronautics and
astronautics, radio science,
and electrical engineering.

The Mathematical and Com
puter Science Library, in Room
384 of the Quad, has books on
math, statistics, and computer
theory and application.
The Music Library, on the
second floor of the Knoll, con
tains the only catalog for scores
and recordings, and holds col
lections for music teaching, re
search and performance.
The Physics Library, in Room
300 of the Varian building, has
the Hansen Microwave
Laboratory Library, which con
tains materials on microwave
physics and engineering, and
the Plasma Physics Institute.
