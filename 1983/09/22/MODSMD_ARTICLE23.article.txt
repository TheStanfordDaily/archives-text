# The 						City
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
You could spend a lifetime exploring San Francisco.
But there are a number of sights that should be on your list if
you haven't been there before.
If you are a newcomer to the area,or perhaps haven't been to the "city by
the bay" in awhile, this list will give you a splendid start.

The brick buildings of the old factory
were restored in 1962, setting an example
for urban reclamation efforts all over the
world.
The Cannery —A defunct Del Monte
cannery transformed into a galleria of
shops and restaurants, The Cannery con
tinued the Ghirardelli tradition of urban
redevelopment. Mimes and musicians
regularly give performances in the com
plex's square.
Fisherman's Wharf —Salty fishermen,
seagulls and the ripe smell of freshly
cleaned fish once dominated San Fran
cisco's wharf. Although the nearby slips
still berth trawlers, wax museums,
carnival-type rides and tourist shops have
almost taken over the surrounding wharf
area. Yet the 19th century museum ship
Balclutha harks back to old days and
some of the city's best restaurants are still
to be found along "The Wharf."
Palace of Fine Arts —Created as the
diadem of the 1915 Pacific Exposition, a
central rotunda embracing a Corinthian
colonnade ornamented with freizes and
statuary comprise the Palace. By the
19505, these original plaster structures
had been reduced to ruins by the weather
sweeping through the Golden Gate. Dur
ing the 60s, a sentimental movement
mobilized to have the monument re
stored in pre-cast concrete. The support
ing buildings now house the
Exploratorium, a "hands-on" science
museum.
Chinatown —A long-time resident of
Hong Kong once said that San Francisco's
Chinatown reminded him of home...the
rush hour traffic jams on the main drag,
Grant Avenue, rivaled any bicycled, au
tomobiled tie-up a Chinese city could
muster. But Grant Avenue also offers a
kaleidoscope of Asian delights—
restaurants, dim sum bars, pharmacies
displaying pickled snake, people inspect
ing the Chinese cabbage out in front of
grocery stores with pressed ducks hang
ing in the windows. The streets radiating

49 Mile Drive —This half-day tour is a
planned drive through the most famous
landmarks of "The City." An excellent in
troduction to San Francisco, the route
starts on Van Ness Avenue at the Civic
Center and is clearly marked by blue and
white seagull signs.
Alcatraz—Known by inmates as "The
Rock," Alcatraz claims most of its fame
from the time when it was a Devil's Isle
style federal penitentiary housing such
notable criminals as The Bird Man. The
island has also been used as a fortifica
tion, a U.S. military prison, an army dis
ciplinary barracks, and an American In
dian stronghold. The Bay Area's 39,000-
acre Golden Gate Recreation Area now
claims the 135 foot crag; and the National
Park Service runs two-hour conducted
tours from the San Francisco waterfront.
Reservations required.
Transamerica Pyramid —The tallest
building in the San Francisco skyline, the
48 stories of the Pyramid slant skyward to
form an unusual "skysaving" wedge. This
design, a company symbol for the Trans
america Corporation, and the building's
juxtaposition to the low-rise Jackson
Square caused considerable controversy.
Bank of America World Headquarters—
The Bank of America complex occupies
an entire downtown block, complete
with a formal plaza dominated by a black
granite sculpture known locally as the
"The Banker's Heart." Completed in
1969, thousands of movie-goers thought
they saw the early demise of the Bank of
America building in the movie The Tower
ing Inferno.
Ghirardelli Square —Here is where 19th
century laborers once made chocolate,
packaged spices and wove fine woolens.
Twentieth century visitors to Ghirardelli
Square now browse in the Mustard Build
ing, watch street performers in the plaza
next to the Woolen Building and buy
Ghirardelli (pronounced GEAR'-ar-delly)
chocolate in the old Chocolate Building.

Polk Street —ln the pre-supermarket
era, this avenue once supported a posh
shopping district catering to the well-to
do residents of Russian Hill and Nob Hill.
Bath houses and gay activists have since
supplanted the fur-coated housewives
and chic shops. Though the shops have
changed with the local tastes and de
mands, many fashionable boutiques and
gourmet restaurants still line Polk Street.
Washington Square —Schoolgirls com
ing out of confession in the adjacent
Church of Saints Peter and Paul, grand
fathers feeding the pidgeons and
hucksters from the red-light Broadway
district a couple blocks away circulate
through the piazza of San Francisco's"Lit
tle Italy," the North Beach District. After
gorging on pasta in one of the excellent
cafes in the area, visit Washington Square
to digest your meal and soak up some of
the local color.
California Palace of the Legion of
Honor —The Palace, perched close to
Land's End in the western part of the city,
houses an extensive collection of Rodin
bronzes including The Thinker.
Fort Point —This three-tiered brick fort
used to hold vigil against invaders passing
through the Golden Gate. Now dwarfed
by the Golden Gate Bridge, the building
has been made a National Historic Site
and tours are conducted between 10 a.m.
and 5 p.m.
Golden Gate Bridge —Visitors are often
disappointed to discoverthe bridge is not
so-named because it is painted gold but
because the sun sets in the Golden
Gate...but not always. The Gate is often
"socked in" by fog, to the dismay of
tourists dressed for California sun.
Lombard Street —This twister descends
Russian Hill from Hyde, with 10 hairpin

out from Grant Avenue house one of the
largest Chinese populations outside of
China and plenty of opportunities for
exploration.
Union Square —This is San Francisco's
Fifth Avenue. Some of The City's most
swank shops and hotels—l Magnin's
(complete with a marble-paneled, gold
fixtured bathroom), Saks Fifth Avenue,
the Hotel St. Francis, Elizabeth Arden's—
front the Square or the nearby streets.
Civic Center —After the 1906 ear
thquake and fire, the city planners
wanted to remake the town into a mod
ern Athens. The Civic Center is only a
small part of the elaborate complex plan
ned. San Franciscans boast that City Hall,
with its ornamented dome, gargoyled fi
nials and marble balustrade is the finest
example of French Romanesque architec
ture outside of Europe. The elaborate
Federal and State office buildings, Civic
Auditorium and Brooks Exhibit Hall, Pub
lic Library and Performing Art Center
echo this traditional theme. The newly
completed glass and white concrete
Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall is a
modern departure.
Twin Peaks —A cliche necking and
drinking teenage hangout Friday and
Saturday nights, Twin Peaks offers an in
toxicating vista of the Bay Area from the
Marin headlands to the Santa Clara Val
ley. During the day, a drive around the
figure-eight road that collars the peaks is
an excellent way to get your bearings on a
first trip to the city. At night the glittering
skyline is a perfect top-off to a night on
the town.
Japan Town/Center —Japan Center and
the revitalized Japan Town join to create a
mecca for the thousands of Japanese
businessmen who visit San Francisco to
make financial deals and have their pic
ture taken in front of the Golden Gate
Bridge. The complex of hotels, theaters,
shops and restaurants offer some of the
best saimen noodles and electronic
goods this side of the Pacific.

turns in a single block. Constructed,
some say by a mischeivous city planner,
the street now terrifies student drivers all
over the city.
Mission Delores —Father Serra founded
this mission in 1776 as part of Spain's col
onization effort in the New World. Dur
ing his lifetime, this Franciscan missio l
nary started a whole string of missions
stretching along the El Camino Real or,
"King's Highway" all the way to
California.
Ferry Building —ln the days before rush
hour traffic clogged the Bay and Golden
Gate Bridges, the Ferry building annually
processed more than 50 million commut-.
ers from the East Bay and Marin County.
Today, a Bay Bridge approach obscures
this monument at the foot of Market
Street. Most of the building is used now
as office space, although the Golden Gate
Ferry operates out of the south side of the
building.
Coit Tower/Telegraph Hill —The Bohe
mian section of San Francisco, the cir
cuitous streets and cliff-hanging houses
of Telegraph Hill have been inhabited by
successive generations of flower chil
dren, artists and literati. The upper area
around Coit Tower, a monument to the
city's early volunteer firefighters, has de-.
veloped into a patchwork of posh
ments. ™
Nob Hill —The exclusive Common
wealth Club, the lavish Fairmont HoteJ,
the Huntington Hotel, four-star restaur
ant Alexis and apartments with rents as
high as their views—all these attract San


Francisco's glitterati to Nob Hill, one of
the city's most elegant spots.
George R. Moscone Convention
Center —A $126 million affirmation that
San Francisco is indeed a tourist town,
Moscone Center houses a 216,000-foot
exhibit hall area, 41 meeting rooms seat
ing from 30 to 3000 people, a 30,000
square-foot ballroom, and accommo
dates 20,000 special events theater-style.
The facility is named for the late Mayor
George R. Moscone who was assassi

nated in the late 1970s by ex-San Fran
cisco Supervisor Dan White.
Pier 39 —Pier cii--onnrls its ma' 1 of
shops and restaurants with the trappings
of a turn-of-the-century street scene.
Built on a 1000 toot-long pier, the mall
offers sweeping views of the Bay and the
City.
Old Mint —Though it was phased out of
operation in 1937, the Old Mint was re
vamped and reopened as a museum in
1973. The include period rooms,
a pyramid of gold bars, Old West ar
tifacts, Mint's Special Coins and Metals
Division and monetary treasures of all
kinds.
