# How To Get There From Here
## 
### REBECCA BUECHEL 
It's Friday night and you're
planning your Stanford
weekend that lies ahead, but
you encounter difficulties:
I here are no parties planned,
'you've already seen the up
coming flick three times and
theclarinet duet at Dinkelspiel
just doesn't entice you. At this
point the itch begins. You
realize you're tired of the par
course, deGuerre pool and
Domino's pizza and you want
something more.As your horiz
ions begin to extend beyond
the Farm, beyond even Palo
Alto-, they reach northward to
San Francisco. The perfect day
in The City forms in your mind,
but you quickly dismiss your
figments since you, like many
lot™, are car-less.
Suddenly San Francisco
seems very far, much further
;tha'n when you were deciding
tocome to Stanford and read in
the pre-enrollment prop
aganda: "San Francisco is 35
imiles to the north (of the cam
!pus).and offers the urban plea
sures of theatres, galleries, re
staurants, and an extensive
shopping district."
Not that Stanford isn't fun,
but everyone yearns for some
•city now and again. And San
!Francisco is world-renowned:
iPeople fly thousands of miles
ltd visit San Francisco, new
lytveds travel there for their
honeymoons and the city has
;thre highest density of restaur-
seats per person. The ex
•citdment of the Wharf, Golden
•Gate Park, the Golden Gate
Ibrlidge and backstreet byways
alf mJfe San Francisco a perfect
Ispot'for your weekend. If you

■
feel your desire to travel north
stifled by your lack of a car,
you'll be happy to hear that
there are other inexpensive,
convenient ways to get there.
The most accessible trans
port to The City is the SamTrans
bus which departs from the
Stanford Shopping Center at
the El Camino bus stop. From
here the 7-F bus line follows
Highway 101 which is admit
tedly not the most scenic
route, but the bus fare is only
$1.45 each way. For early
risers, buses begin the trip to,
San Francisco at 5:17 a.m. on
weekdays and at 6:32 a.m. on
weekends. After 8:37 a.m.
buses run every half hour untill
the evening (6:07 p.m. week-l

days and 4:37 p.m. weekends)
when they switch to an hourly
departure schedule with the
last one leaving at 12:05 a.m.
The travel time by SamTrans is
nearly twice that of going by
car (one and one-half hours),
but can pass quickly if shared
with a book, Walkman, or
friend; however, be prepared
to stand if you ride during
commuter hours.
When you finally arrive at the
downtown stops, Eighth and
Mission (near the civic center)
or First and Mission, and the
aura of The City hits you, the
image of the long bus ride
fades quickly. Do n't forget that
the last bus to Palo Alto leaves
First and Mission at 1:03 a.m.
and that the south bound
buses leave from Seventh and
Mission instead of Eighth. Ear

lier, the homewardbound 7-F
buses leave every 10-15 mi
nutes until 6:49 p.m. when
they start leaving once an hour.
But if you really want to "get
into" the Bay Area commuting
scene, you may want to con
sider taking BART (Bay Area
Rapid Transit) to The City. The
disadvantage of using BART is
that since the closest BART sta
tion to Stanford is in Daly City,
riding BART involves getting to
Daly City. The 5-L SamTrans

busline which regularly leaves
the Palo Alto southern Pacific
Station from 5:50 a.m. until
6:40 p.m., stops at the Daly
City BART station. The trip on
the 5-L costs less than one dol
lar, but the stop-and-go route
takes one and one-half hours.
One practical advantage of
BART is that since BART offers
special bike permits including
temporary one-time passes
you can take your bike. But
since neither the bus nor the
train allows bikes, you would
need to hitch a ride with your
bike up to Daly City. If your
bike collapses at the frame,
you don't need a special permit
to take it on BART.
BART, with its space-age ap
pearance and automation,

where machines sell tickets
which whiz through slots and
magically open gates, is the
pride of the Bay Area. Boarding
for the twenty-minute ride is
self-explanatory as well-lit
signs mark the way. The price
varies, depending on where
you disembark, but never ex
ceeds $l.lO. The seven
downtown stations are all un
derground and centrally lo
cated: four are along Market
Street, two on Mission, and
one near the city college at
Geneva and San Jose streets.
BART runs every 15-20 minutes
from 6 a.m. until midnight
Monday through Saturday, and
from 9 a.m. until midnight on
Sundays. BART is still fairly new
and promises a swift and com
fortable entry to downtown.
But if buses make you sick or
you think BART too robotic
then why not take the train?
When was the last time you
rode a train? The CalTrain
leaves from the Southern
Pacific Depot off University

Avenue just a short bike ride
from campus. But don't forget
to lock your bike securely be
fore abandoning it all day, or
you'll have to walk home.
The train is more-expensive
than the others with a one-way
ticket costing $3.20 and a
round-trip ticket costing $4.80.
The train tends to be more
comfortable and roomy than
the bus. After a smattering of
dawn departures, the train's
schedule eases into what vag
uely resembles hourly depar
tures with a few extras fit in be
tween from 8:24 a.m. to 10:24
p.m. The downtown stop is at
Fourth and Townsend, fairly far
from centers of interest, but
along the city bus routes.
Along such routes, the
MUNI bus can get you from
your depot (no matter which
transport you choose to use) to
within a short walk of any
where you might want to go
once you're in the city. The
MUNI will be a necessary p&rt
of your journey since many
depots are in the less desirable
parts of town. v
The combined networks of
cable cars (which are under re
pair until next year), the mini
metro (electric buses), and
gasoline buses make up the
city transportation better
known as the MUNI. Various
depots have courteously
phones connecting to the
MUNI office where you can get
directions on what lines to use.
If the phones are unavailable,
and you have not pre-checked
your directions, simply ask a
passing bus driver or a native,
either of whom are usually
helpful.
Once you know which bus
numbers to take, you are
nearly to your destination
since the MUNI vehicles run
often. You shouldn't have to
wait more than ten minutes for
your ride, and often will wait
only a few seconds till your bus
comes to pick you up. Rides
are 60 cents each, but if you ask
