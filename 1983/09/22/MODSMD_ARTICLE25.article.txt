# Peninsula eating: Something more than McDonald's
## 
### 
They say that half the fun
is getting there.
If that's true, then when it
comes to eating out, at least
half the fun is choosing a re
staurant.
The Peninsula offers
hundreds of restaurants
from which to choose. Al
though a cruise down El
Camino Real might con
vince you that Chinese food
is your only choice in these
parts, with a little searching
you can find just about any
thing.
We make no attempt to
provide a complete listing
of area eateries in the fol
lowing reviews you'll
have enough time to dis
cover other places on your
own. What we hope to pro
vide with these reviews,
condensed versions of larger
Daily reviews, is a base of
restaurants from which you
may begin your search for
new favorites. Please note
that all prices are approxi
mate and subject to change.
Happy hunting!
CHANTILLY
530 Ramona
Palo Alto
321-4080
Chantilly is that type of
restaurant you'd like to
keep a secret. The under
stated elegance of roses and
pinks give Chantilly an exc
lusive atmosphere without
the pretensions of other
top-flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile
and the diverse menu
shows imagination: sauteed
veal and eggplant, I'es
calopine de veau a la Bolog
naise for two, Chicken
Cynthia with champagne.
The chef's subtle sauces
and refined seasonings en
hance rather than stifle the
freshness of Chantilly's dis

hes. The Lisson Salad a la
Chantilly for two with let
tuce, cucumber, olive, ba
con, feta cheese and herbs,
and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb, sauteed with
fresh tarragon, will both de
light rather than assault
your palate.
CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9988
China Lion is the venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger
brother. The menu lists 109
items, many of which are
Hunan style. Prices are
lower than Chef Chu's, but
the portions are smaller.
One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is
attentive.
Kung Pao Beef consists of
tender beef slices and crisp
green peppers accented
with peanuts. Prawns in hot
sauce, though tasty, are a
challenge to eat the
prawns are not shelled.
CHEZ JUSTINE
625 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
328-8549
Chez Justine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargot and oys
ters. Pate Maison is of the
pureed liver variety, but too
dry. Entrees come with soup
du jour and salad.
The menu features
abalone, Long Island duckl
ing, New York steak with
green peppercorns among
its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in
cream sauce are extremely
tender, but the veal is too
thick for classic escalopes.
Rather, they resemble veal
medallions. Truite Plemon

daise (fresh trout with wine
sauce) is outstanding.
For dessert, strawberries
with ice cream, nuts and
Grand Marnier is a visual as
well as tasty treat.
COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN BAR-B-Q
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
568-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cook
ery. Their simple diet of
thin-sliced roasted meat
was introduced in China
during the 13th century. The
Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, the
cuisine became known as
the "Mongolian Barbeque."
Take a bowl and help
yourself to frozen strips of
turkey, lamb, pork and
beef. Fresh vegetables, in
cluding shredded carrots,
onions, celery, cabbage,
bean sprouts and cilantro
are next.
Everything is topped off
by any of several barbeque
sauces. Curry, sweet and
sour, lobster, spicy, mild,
medium hot and extra hot
are offered, and you are en
couraged to create your
own combinations.
The atmosphere of Col
onel Lee's is quiet, relaxed
and casual, typical of
neighborhood cafes. The
services are courteous and
made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no
one spoke English very well.
THE DUTCH GOOSE
3567 Alameda de las Pulgas
Menlo Park
854-3245
The Goose joins the com
pany of "Zots" and the "O"
as a place to get beer and

burgers. Saturday nights are
especially fun there, as the
establishment seems en
tirely populated by Stanford
students. There are peanut
shells and sawdust on the
floor. The atmosphere is
reminiscent of Pop's Malt
Shop from the Archie com
ics, after a crew of loggers
has rolled through, that is.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Avenue
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant—somewhere in be
tween a country inn and an
exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered
world of starched linens,
fresh flowers, candlelight
and wine. Not that the food
isn't good—it is, but it's the
ambiance, not the cuisine
that you will remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salad, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such
as Beef Wellington ($11),
and Stuffed Trout ($9.75).
Scandanavian Koltbords—a
platter of assorted fruits,
cheeses, meats, seafood
and bread ($l2 for two;
$6.50 for one) provide a un
ique dinner alternative.
Dessert was the high
point of the meal.
Cheesecake, assorted cakes
and pastries (all $1,60), vari
ous flavors of Rick's Rather
Rich ice cream ($1.25) and
Creme Caramel ($1.50) eas
ily triumph over your
calorific conscience.
The Gatehouse also has a
huge wooden bar with an
equally elegant, yet quiet
atmosphere.
HENRY'S
482 University Avenue
Palo Alto
326-5680

Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flaw
lessly prepared. And if the
food lacks the inspiration of
a top-flight French restaur
ant, the generous portions,
fair prices and great atmos
phere more than compen
sate. Entrees are priced be
tween $5 and $B, and come
with a choice of homemade
soup or house salad.
The house salad was
crisp, refreshing and served
with a chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of
the daily specials, com
prised two large pieces of
sole, resting on a bed of
fresh spinach and covered
with a light wine sauce. Per
fectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average
rice accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich
(veal Aurich-style) is
another sure bet at Henry's.
The real character of the in
gredients, moreover, is not
masked by heavy sauces.
Both over-salting and over
saucing are frequent faults
of even the best French re
stau rants.
MADDALENA'S
CONTINENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Maddalena's is a must for
any self-professed French
or Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a con
tinental menu; pasta is
served unblushingly
alongside scampi bour
delaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian
pastes are the unusual ap
petizers. From such a list as
Cannelloni Florentine, Fet
tucine alia Romano, and alia
Romagna, we chose Lin
guine Von.

Maddalena's offers salads
a la carte, such spinach
($5.50 for two), mushroom
($5), Caesar ($5.50 for two)
and Butter lettuce with sea
food ($4.95).
The entree list most
dearly revealed the continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($9.95) and Sole
Florentine with Shrimp
($10.50) to Chicken Al Forno
Arturo and Steak Sinatra.
Just as the excellent
cuisine and reasonable
prices remind me of bygone
days, so too does the
decor—soft blue walls and
carpeting, gold-framed pic
tures, beautifully painted
screens and chandeliers.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road
East Palo Alto
856-7700
One of the better Chinese
restaurants around, Ming's
is a popular banquet spot
and if you don't go there on
your own, you'll likely end
up there with your dorm,
team or club sooner or later.
The good thing is you can
either have a moderate,
simple dinner, or an elabo
rate meal which can get
fairly expensive. Ming's
beef is one of their best
recognized specialties.
Moderate-Expensive. Open
daily.
MONTI'S SEAFOOD
RESTAURANT
Menlo Park
321-3724
From the outside it looks
small and intimate. The in
timate part is right, but it is
by no means small. The
building itself contains

three elegantly furnishecL
dining rooms and a cocktaiP
lounge. Off to the side of
the main building is a fresh
fish market, which is open
six days a week.
Monti's specializes in
Eastern seafoods, which are
imported to ensure fresh
ness. These include Maine
lobster, cherry stone clams,
and blue point oysters. Ev
erything on the menu is av
ailable in the fish market
next door. However the
menu is not limited to sea
food. It is in fact quite ex
tensive, offering continen
tal dinners in addition to
their wide variety of sea®
food.
SCOTT'S SEAFOOD
GRILL AND BAR
2300 East Bayshore
East Palo Alto
856-1046
For those of you who ap
preciate seafood but care
little about where you eat it,
Scott's may just be the tic
ket. Although its two giant
dining areas create at best a
warehouse effect, Scott's
offers a fine variety of sea
food dishes.
The bay shrimp cocktail
($4.50) is a first-cabin rendi -
tion of what is all-too-ofterfi
a fairly generic appetizer.
The fried calamari ($9.. '.)
tossed with lemon,
wine, parsley and butter is a
refreshing break from the
more heavily-breaded ver
sion available elsewhere.
Unfortunately, the seafood
saute ($13.95) like many
Stanford football teams of
late, looks great on paper
but doesn't quite live up to
its billing. Although the crab
legs, scallops and prawns
are satisfying enough, the
sauce is uninspiring.
They say that half the fun

If that's true, then when it
comes to eating out, at least
half the fun is choosing a re

MONTI'S SEAFOOD
RESTAURANT
Menlo Park
321-3724
From the outside it looks
small and intimate. The in
timate part is right, but it is
by no means small. The
building itself contains

three elegantly furnishecL
dining rooms and a cocktaiP
lounge. Off to the side of
the main building is a fresh
fish market, which is open
six days a week.
Monti's specializes in
Eastern seafoods, which are
imported to ensure fresh
ness. These include Maine
lobster, cherry stone clams,
and blue point oysters. Ev
erything on the menu is av
ailable in the fish market
next door. However the
menu is not limited to sea
food. It is in fact quite ex
tensive, offering continen
tal dinners in addition to
their wide variety of sea®
food.
SCOTT'S SEAFOOD
GRILL AND BAR
2300 East Bayshore
East Palo Alto
856-1046
For those of you who ap
preciate seafood but care
little about where you eat it,
Scott's may just be the tic
ket. Although its two giant
dining areas create at best a
warehouse effect, Scott's
offers a fine variety of sea
food dishes.
The bay shrimp cocktail
($4.50) is a first-cabin rendi -
tion of what is all-too-ofterfi
a fairly generic appetizer.
The fried calamari ($9.. '.)
tossed with lemon,
wine, parsley and butter is a
refreshing break from the
more heavily-breaded ver
sion available elsewhere.
Unfortunately, the seafood
saute ($13.95) like many
Stanford football teams of
late, looks great on paper
but doesn't quite live up to
its billing. Although the crab
legs, scallops and prawns
are satisfying enough, the
sauce is uninspiring.
They say that half the fun
is getting there.
If that's true, then when it
comes to eating out, at least
half the fun is choosing a re
staurant.
The Peninsula offers
hundreds of restaurants
from which to choose. Al
though a cruise down El
Camino Real might con
vince you that Chinese food
is your only choice in these
parts, with a little searching
you can find just about any
thing.
We make no attempt to
provide a complete listing
of area eateries in the fol
lowing reviews you'll
have enough time to dis
cover other places on your

CHANTILLY
530 Ramona
Palo Alto
321-4080
Chantilly is that type of
restaurant you'd like to
keep a secret. The under
stated elegance of roses and
pinks give Chantilly an exc
lusive atmosphere without
the pretensions of other
top-flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile
and the diverse menu
shows imagination: sauteed
veal and eggplant, I'es
calopine de veau a la Bolog
naise for two, Chicken
Cynthia with champagne.
The chef's subtle sauces
and refined seasonings en
hance rather than stifle the
freshness of Chantilly's dis

hes. The Lisson Salad a la
Chantilly for two with let
tuce, cucumber, olive, ba
con, feta cheese and herbs,
and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb, sauteed with
fresh tarragon, will both de
light rather than assault
your palate.
CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9988
China Lion is the venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger
brother. The menu lists 109
items, many of which are
Hunan style. Prices are
lower than Chef Chu's, but
the portions are smaller.
One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is
attentive.
Kung Pao Beef consists of
tender beef slices and crisp
green peppers accented
with peanuts. Prawns in hot
sauce, though tasty, are a
challenge to eat the
prawns are not shelled.
CHEZ JUSTINE
625 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
328-8549
Chez Justine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargot and oys
ters. Pate Maison is of the
pureed liver variety, but too
dry. Entrees come with soup
du jour and salad.
The menu features
abalone, Long Island duckl
ing, New York steak with
green peppercorns among
its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in
cream sauce are extremely
tender, but the veal is too
thick for classic escalopes.
Rather, they resemble veal
medallions. Truite Plemon

daise (fresh trout with wine
sauce) is outstanding.
For dessert, strawberries
with ice cream, nuts and
Grand Marnier is a visual as
well as tasty treat.
COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN BAR-B-Q
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
568-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cook
ery. Their simple diet of
thin-sliced roasted meat
was introduced in China
during the 13th century. The
Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, the
cuisine became known as
the "Mongolian Barbeque."
Take a bowl and help
yourself to frozen strips of
turkey, lamb, pork and
beef. Fresh vegetables, in
cluding shredded carrots,
onions, celery, cabbage,
bean sprouts and cilantro
are next.
Everything is topped off
by any of several barbeque
sauces. Curry, sweet and
sour, lobster, spicy, mild,
medium hot and extra hot
are offered, and you are en
couraged to create your
own combinations.
The atmosphere of Col
onel Lee's is quiet, relaxed
and casual, typical of
neighborhood cafes. The
services are courteous and
made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no
one spoke English very well.
THE DUTCH GOOSE
3567 Alameda de las Pulgas
Menlo Park
854-3245
The Goose joins the com
pany of "Zots" and the "O"
as a place to get beer and

burgers. Saturday nights are
especially fun there, as the
establishment seems en
tirely populated by Stanford
students. There are peanut
shells and sawdust on the
floor. The atmosphere is
reminiscent of Pop's Malt
Shop from the Archie com
ics, after a crew of loggers
has rolled through, that is.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Avenue
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant—somewhere in be
tween a country inn and an
exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered
world of starched linens,
fresh flowers, candlelight
and wine. Not that the food
isn't good—it is, but it's the
ambiance, not the cuisine
that you will remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salad, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such
as Beef Wellington ($11),
and Stuffed Trout ($9.75).
Scandanavian Koltbords—a
platter of assorted fruits,
cheeses, meats, seafood
and bread ($l2 for two;
$6.50 for one) provide a un
ique dinner alternative.
Dessert was the high
point of the meal.
Cheesecake, assorted cakes
and pastries (all $1,60), vari
ous flavors of Rick's Rather
Rich ice cream ($1.25) and
Creme Caramel ($1.50) eas
ily triumph over your
calorific conscience.
The Gatehouse also has a
huge wooden bar with an
equally elegant, yet quiet
atmosphere.
HENRY'S
482 University Avenue
Palo Alto
326-5680

Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flaw
lessly prepared. And if the
food lacks the inspiration of
a top-flight French restaur
ant, the generous portions,
fair prices and great atmos
phere more than compen
sate. Entrees are priced be
tween $5 and $B, and come
with a choice of homemade
soup or house salad.
The house salad was
crisp, refreshing and served
with a chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of
the daily specials, com
prised two large pieces of
sole, resting on a bed of
fresh spinach and covered
with a light wine sauce. Per
fectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average
rice accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich
(veal Aurich-style) is
another sure bet at Henry's.
The real character of the in
gredients, moreover, is not
masked by heavy sauces.
Both over-salting and over
saucing are frequent faults
of even the best French re
stau rants.
MADDALENA'S
CONTINENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Maddalena's is a must for
any self-professed French
or Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a con
tinental menu; pasta is
served unblushingly
alongside scampi bour
delaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian
pastes are the unusual ap
petizers. From such a list as
Cannelloni Florentine, Fet
tucine alia Romano, and alia
Romagna, we chose Lin
guine Von.

Maddalena's offers salads
a la carte, such spinach
($5.50 for two), mushroom
($5), Caesar ($5.50 for two)
and Butter lettuce with sea
food ($4.95).
The entree list most
dearly revealed the continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($9.95) and Sole
Florentine with Shrimp
($10.50) to Chicken Al Forno
Arturo and Steak Sinatra.
Just as the excellent
cuisine and reasonable
prices remind me of bygone
days, so too does the
decor—soft blue walls and
carpeting, gold-framed pic
tures, beautifully painted
screens and chandeliers.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road

One of the better Chinese

is a popular banquet spot
and if you don't go there on
your own, you'll likely end
up there with your dorm,
team or club sooner or later.
The good thing is you can
either have a moderate,
simple dinner, or an elabo
rate meal which can get
fairly expensive. Ming's
beef is one of their best
recognized specialties.

MADDALENA'S
CONTINENTAL
544 Emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Maddalena's is a must for
any self-professed French
or Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a con
tinental menu; pasta is
served unblushingly
alongside scampi bour
delaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian
pastes are the unusual ap
petizers. From such a list as
Cannelloni Florentine, Fet
tucine alia Romano, and alia
Romagna, we chose Lin
guine Von.

Maddalena's offers salads
a la carte, such spinach
($5.50 for two), mushroom
($5), Caesar ($5.50 for two)
and Butter lettuce with sea
food ($4.95).
The entree list most
dearly revealed the continen
tal variety and ranges from
such fish dishes as Sole
Meuniere ($9.95) and Sole
Florentine with Shrimp
($10.50) to Chicken Al Forno
Arturo and Steak Sinatra.
Just as the excellent
cuisine and reasonable
prices remind me of bygone
days, so too does the
decor—soft blue walls and
carpeting, gold-framed pic
tures, beautifully painted
screens and chandeliers.
MING'S
1700 Embarcadero Road
East Palo Alto
856-7700
One of the better Chinese
restaurants around, Ming's
is a popular banquet spot
and if you don't go there on
your own, you'll likely end
up there with your dorm,
team or club sooner or later.
The good thing is you can
either have a moderate,
simple dinner, or an elabo
rate meal which can get
fairly expensive. Ming's
beef is one of their best
recognized specialties.
Moderate-Expensive. Open
daily.
MONTI'S SEAFOOD
RESTAURANT
Menlo Park
321-3724
From the outside it looks
small and intimate. The in
timate part is right, but it is
by no means small. The
building itself contains

three elegantly furnishecL
dining rooms and a cocktaiP
lounge. Off to the side of
the main building is a fresh
fish market, which is open
six days a week.
Monti's specializes in
Eastern seafoods, which are
imported to ensure fresh
ness. These include Maine
lobster, cherry stone clams,
and blue point oysters. Ev
erything on the menu is av
ailable in the fish market
next door. However the
menu is not limited to sea
food. It is in fact quite ex
tensive, offering continen
tal dinners in addition to
their wide variety of sea®
food.
SCOTT'S SEAFOOD
GRILL AND BAR
2300 East Bayshore
East Palo Alto
856-1046
For those of you who ap
preciate seafood but care
little about where you eat it,
Scott's may just be the tic
ket. Although its two giant
dining areas create at best a
warehouse effect, Scott's
offers a fine variety of sea
food dishes.
The bay shrimp cocktail
($4.50) is a first-cabin rendi -
tion of what is all-too-ofterfi
a fairly generic appetizer.
The fried calamari ($9.. '.)
tossed with lemon,
wine, parsley and butter is a
refreshing break from the
more heavily-breaded ver
sion available elsewhere.
Unfortunately, the seafood
saute ($13.95) like many
Stanford football teams of
late, looks great on paper
but doesn't quite live up to
its billing. Although the crab
legs, scallops and prawns
are satisfying enough, the
sauce is uninspiring.
They say that half the fun
is getting there.
If that's true, then when it
comes to eating out, at least
half the fun is choosing a re
staurant.
The Peninsula offers
hundreds of restaurants
from which to choose. Al
though a cruise down El
Camino Real might con
vince you that Chinese food
is your only choice in these
parts, with a little searching
you can find just about any
thing.
We make no attempt to
provide a complete listing
of area eateries in the fol
lowing reviews you'll
have enough time to dis
cover other places on your
own. What we hope to pro
vide with these reviews,
condensed versions of larger
Daily reviews, is a base of
restaurants from which you
may begin your search for
new favorites. Please note
that all prices are approxi
mate and subject to change.
Happy hunting!
CHANTILLY
530 Ramona
Palo Alto
321-4080
Chantilly is that type of
restaurant you'd like to
keep a secret. The under
stated elegance of roses and
pinks give Chantilly an exc
lusive atmosphere without
the pretensions of other
top-flight restaurants.
The chef is from L'Etoile
and the diverse menu
shows imagination: sauteed
veal and eggplant, I'es
calopine de veau a la Bolog
naise for two, Chicken
Cynthia with champagne.
The chef's subtle sauces
and refined seasonings en
hance rather than stifle the
freshness of Chantilly's dis

hes. The Lisson Salad a la
Chantilly for two with let
tuce, cucumber, olive, ba
con, feta cheese and herbs,
and the Medallions of
Spring Lamb, sauteed with
fresh tarragon, will both de
light rather than assault
your palate.
CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9988
China Lion is the venture
of Samson Chu, Lawrence
"Chef" Chu's younger
brother. The menu lists 109
items, many of which are
Hunan style. Prices are
lower than Chef Chu's, but
the portions are smaller.
One is advised to order an
extra bowl of rice. Service is
attentive.
Kung Pao Beef consists of
tender beef slices and crisp
green peppers accented
with peanuts. Prawns in hot
sauce, though tasty, are a
challenge to eat the
prawns are not shelled.
CHEZ JUSTINE
625 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
328-8549
Chez Justine offers eight
standard appetizers such as
shrimp, escargot and oys
ters. Pate Maison is of the
pureed liver variety, but too
dry. Entrees come with soup
du jour and salad.
The menu features
abalone, Long Island duckl
ing, New York steak with
green peppercorns among
its entrees.
Escalopes de Veau in
cream sauce are extremely
tender, but the veal is too
thick for classic escalopes.
Rather, they resemble veal
medallions. Truite Plemon

daise (fresh trout with wine
sauce) is outstanding.
For dessert, strawberries
with ice cream, nuts and
Grand Marnier is a visual as
well as tasty treat.
COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN BAR-B-Q
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
568-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not
known for their fancy cook
ery. Their simple diet of
thin-sliced roasted meat
was introduced in China
during the 13th century. The
Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, the
cuisine became known as
the "Mongolian Barbeque."
Take a bowl and help
yourself to frozen strips of
turkey, lamb, pork and
beef. Fresh vegetables, in
cluding shredded carrots,
onions, celery, cabbage,
bean sprouts and cilantro
are next.
Everything is topped off
by any of several barbeque
sauces. Curry, sweet and
sour, lobster, spicy, mild,
medium hot and extra hot
are offered, and you are en
couraged to create your
own combinations.
The atmosphere of Col
onel Lee's is quiet, relaxed
and casual, typical of
neighborhood cafes. The
services are courteous and
made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no
one spoke English very well.
THE DUTCH GOOSE
3567 Alameda de las Pulgas
Menlo Park
854-3245
The Goose joins the com
pany of "Zots" and the "O"
as a place to get beer and

burgers. Saturday nights are
especially fun there, as the
establishment seems en
tirely populated by Stanford
students. There are peanut
shells and sawdust on the
floor. The atmosphere is
reminiscent of Pop's Malt
Shop from the Archie com
ics, after a crew of loggers
has rolled through, that is.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Avenue
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly
elegant—somewhere in be
tween a country inn and an
exclusive British club. You
can relax in a pampered
world of starched linens,
fresh flowers, candlelight
and wine. Not that the food
isn't good—it is, but it's the
ambiance, not the cuisine
that you will remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salad, steaks, sea
food and daily specials such
as Beef Wellington ($11),
and Stuffed Trout ($9.75).
Scandanavian Koltbords—a
platter of assorted fruits,
cheeses, meats, seafood
and bread ($l2 for two;
$6.50 for one) provide a un
ique dinner alternative.
Dessert was the high
point of the meal.
Cheesecake, assorted cakes
and pastries (all $1,60), vari
ous flavors of Rick's Rather
Rich ice cream ($1.25) and
Creme Caramel ($1.50) eas
ily triumph over your
calorific conscience.
The Gatehouse also has a
huge wooden bar with an
equally elegant, yet quiet
atmosphere.
HENRY'S
482 University Avenue
Palo Alto
326-5680

Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flaw
lessly prepared. And if the
food lacks the inspiration of
a top-flight French restaur
ant, the generous portions,
fair prices and great atmos
phere more than compen
sate. Entrees are priced be
tween $5 and $B, and come
with a choice of homemade
soup or house salad.
The house salad was
crisp, refreshing and served
with a chilled fork.
Sole Florentine, one of
the daily specials, com
prised two large pieces of
sole, resting on a bed of
fresh spinach and covered
with a light wine sauce. Per
fectly cooked vegetables
and better-than-average
rice accompanied the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich
(veal Aurich-style) is
another sure bet at Henry's.
The real character of the in
gredients, moreover, is not
masked by heavy sauces.
Both over-salting and over
saucing are frequent faults
of even the best French re
stau rants.
