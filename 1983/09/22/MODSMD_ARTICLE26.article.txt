# The 						I-Center: a home away from home
## 
### MELINDA ISRAEL 
White stucco walls, French
windows and a red-tile roof
make the Bechtel International
Center at the intersection of
Mayfield Avenue and Lomita
Drive look like an elegant yet
inviting residence.
However, while the building
houses many offices to aid
foreign and American stu
dents, no one actually lives
there. Instead, the Interna
tional Center becomes a non
residential home by hosting
classes and social events, pro

viding overseas resources, and
in general creating an atmos
phere for cultural interaction.
A new student can get in
volved at the center by such
various routes as helping a
foreign student with conversa
tion (English in Action prog
ram), visiting the Overseas Re
source Center or simply at
tending one of the center's
numerous social gatherings.
As Director Lee Zeigler em
phasizes, the center is "not just
for foreign students, and not
just for graduate students."

other Tuesday, and the Africa
table will be on Wednesdays
this year.
For the 2000 foreign students
at Stanford each year, a volun
teer committee made up of
community workers is often
invaluable. Providing transpor
tation and temporary home
stays, the volunteers help
make the initial adjustments to
living at Stanford a bit easier.
Located on the second floor,
the Overseas Resource Center
provides information on inter

national employment, study,
travel, and scholarships to
more than 500 visitors each
month. Counselor Barbara
Star says students often "come
in with ideas in the back of
their heads," and then find
their musings in reality on the
center's laden shelves.
For specific schedules of
events, the center published a
newsletter every third week
and lists announcements in the
Daily's Once Around The
Quad section.
