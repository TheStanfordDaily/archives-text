# Bopping around Berkeley
## Don't make eye contact 
### JANE BAILIE 
"There's no where like Berzerkeley!" stu
dents of the University of California at Berkeley
laughingly exclaim as they weave their way
down Telegraph Avenue, many of them seem
ingly oblivious to their surroundings, treating
each new human "obstacle" as something to be
ignored rather than accosted.
The city of Berkeley has been known to attract
some of the more eccentric personalities of the
local area. The shops and streets are painted
with a certain amount of "human color," some
of it psychedelic.
The "Red Man" can be seen virtually any day
parading around the streets of Berkeley, dres
sed completely from head to foot in a vibrant
jpshade of scarlet, carrying on his back a stuffed
puppet the size of a small child.
"Crazy William" is rumored to have been a
philosophy graduate student who "went over
the edge." He painted his clothes and face with
dollar size red polka dots and now camps out on
Telegraph making faces at people and generally
drawing attention to himself. "You have to be
normal to stand out" many freshman are told,
and despite the large student population, many
often find this the case.
The city carries with it an atmosphere which is
probably unique throughout the country. "It's
very much the 'live and let live' philosophy

here," explained one woman resident. "With
this kind of community, there's got to be some
sort of laissez-faire."
Berkeley is still often considered a mecca for
political demonstrators and activists. Few
causes seem to go unnoticed. Supporters of ev
erything from the nuclear freeze to sailing clas
ses establish themselves in Sproul Plaza, a focal
point of the UC campus. During the late morn
ing and early afternoon, it is difficult to cross this
stretch of pavement without being asked to sign
any number of political petitions or join a variety
of activist groups.
Though many of those new to the area may
find this process intimidating, the majority of
students tend to develop "defense tactics" to
ward off the more adamant of these representa
tive demonstrators. Clutching textbooks and
note pads, students can be seen with heads bent
and eyes focused firmly on the ground in front
of them as they quickly stride through a crowd
of activists proffering petitions.
The majority of those persons often consi
dered "unusual" are in reality harmless, pro
vided they are not provoked. "Whatever you do
or see, avoid eye contact!" is the often repeated
line of advice given to those unfamiliar with the
area.

THE QUIET SIDE: Students relax on the UC-Berkeley campus, far from the madness of downtown Berkeley.
