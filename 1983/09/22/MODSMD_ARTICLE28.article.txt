# To Rise Above One's Peers

### 
For the love of lofts and for
those of you who passed
woodshop (do they still have
that in high school?): With the
side benefit of making
maximum use of your undoub
tedly too small University
housing quarters, here's a di
version of sorts for craftsmen
and homebodies.
In case you're not familiar
with the term, lofts are beds on
stilts so to speak; they may be
very simple structures de
signed to enhance storage
space or finely crafted pieces
of furniture adding a touch of
class to your modest accomo
dations.
It shouldn't take too long to
build one, really, and then
you'll have more space for
other diversions like yoga or a
tereo system.
By far the dorm which has
the most lofts is Toyon, due to
its cathedralesque ceilings
which tend to give loftless re
sidents the "closing in walls"
feeling. They're actually a fairly
recent invention only be
coming popular in the past ten
years or so.
Lofts come in all shapes and
sizes: single lofts for one bed,

double lofts for two, "L
-shaped" lofts with a mezzanine
for studying and reading, split
level lofts, and lofts with built
in bars, staircases and even
waterbeds.
If you don't want to spend
the money to buy a ready
made loft, it's not that difficult
to build one yourself. Lumber
and tools are available from
local merchants, and tools like
power saws and drills can be
rented.
"So how do I build a loft?"
The basic ingredients of a
one-story, single bed loft are:
a 4xB sheet of plywood %
inch thick or thicker (fibre
board is heavy and cumber
some)
4x4 posts cut to the de
sired height
2x4 or 2x6 boards to sup
port the plywood, Ix 4 or 2x4
boards to use as cross-bracing
to prevent sway
joist hungers
nails (or wood screws) and
lag bolts
carpet to finish off the
platform.
The first thing to build is the
frame to support the platform.
There are two basic frames to

choose from: (A) a frame of
2x4's with outside dimensions
of 4xB ft. or (B) a 2x6 or 2xB
outer frame with inside dimen
sions 4xB ft.
The advantage to B is that the
plywood may be set inside the
outer frame, leaving a rim
around the platform which not
only keeps the mattress from
sliding off but precludes the
use of nails to anchor the
plywood to the frame. This
saves set-up and tear-down
time.
For both frames (A and B),
cut the corners so the shorter
2x4's fit inside the long ones.
The nicest and easiest way to
secure the outside corners,
though slightly more expen
sive is to use lag bolts (not bolts
from Lagunita Court ask at a
hardware store for a descrip
tion).
At each end of the long
boards drill two holes into the
face. Make the diameter of the
holes smaller than that of the
bolt. Make sure the lag bolts
are long enough to extend into
the end of the shorter boards
and provide a strong joint.
The next step for both A and
B is to install joists at 20-inch

intervals to support the plat
form. Be sure to leave at least
four inches clear at each end
for the loft legs.
Joists are usually 2x4s sup
ported by joist hangers an
chored to the long boards of
the frame. The joists must pro
vide a level surface for the
plywood platform.
For a 2x4 outer frame (A),
make sure the joist hangers are
nailed in so that the inner 2x4
joists will fit flush with the top
of the frame. First, measure
and mark position of the joist
hangers with a small 2x4 block.
Now cut the 2x4 joists to fit
snugly within the outer frame,
resting on the joist hangers. As
long as the corners are secure,
the joists need not be nailed.
On frames with top-flush
joists (A), plywood platforms
must be nailed or screwed
down. For a loft with a wide
outer frame (B), the plywood
platform may be set on top of
the joists inside the frame.
Next, the legs must be instal
led and braced. Use 4x4 posts.
Set them inside the frame at
the corners, with the top of the

posts on the same level as the
joists. You could lean the plat
form against the wall for this
step.
Drill holes for at least two lag
bolts per leg, or use at least
four "16 inch penny" nails.
Braces should run diagonally
from the top of one leg to the
bottom of the opposite leg.
From the long side, use a 2x4
for the diagonal brace; on the
ends, a Ix 4 is fine.
If you want built-in shelves,
cut a 2x4 or 2x6 to fit between
the legs and nail or bolt it in.
This will also give added sup
port.
For a ladder, cut
blocks of equal length for stairs
(wider stairs are nicer). Cuttwo
more 2x4's for ladder uprights
(avoid splintery wood) and
mark off steps at regular inter
vals. The ladder can be nailed
together since it's small
enough to store.
Now your loft should be
ready to sand, stain, carpet and
enjoy.
