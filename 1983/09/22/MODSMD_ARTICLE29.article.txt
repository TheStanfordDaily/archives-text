# The Few. The Proud. The Daily.
## 
### 
The Daily isn't looking for just
anybody. The Daily needs a few
good people. Strong people.
Tough people. People with guts.
And good grammar.
If you think you've got what it
takes, if you think you pass muster,
if you think you know where to put
the commas in a sentence, step
forward.
Join The Daily. Go to strange,
foreign countries. Meet Exotic, in
teresting people. And write for
them.
