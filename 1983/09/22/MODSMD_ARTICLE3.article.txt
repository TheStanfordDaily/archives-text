# How we can survive traumatic life events
## 
### ALEJANDRO MARTINEZ Staff psychologist 
It has been suggested that
stress is a natural by-product
of all activities,. The ordinary
deportment of daily life
eating, not eating, exercising,
not exercising, having a lover
or a mate, not having a lover or
a mate, sleeping, not sleeping,
taking on difficult tasks,
avoiding difficult tasks all
effect the dynamic steady state
of an individual. In other
words, every life event is
stressful to some degree.
Yet it does not follow that
all life events are stressful to
the same degree nor that all
stress arises in negative cir
cumstances. There is, for ex
ample, significant stress in en
tering or finishing college or a
graduate program, getting
married, and making out
standing personal achieve
ment, just as there is signifi
cant stress in having financial
difficulties, problems with
school, and conflicts in
relationships.
The Cowell survey indi
cated that nearly half of all stu
dents at Stanford often feel
anxious or tense. This is sig
nificant in itself as it has been

shown that prolonged, un
abated stress is primarily re
sponsible for the development
of stress-related disorders. Yet,
in addition to on-going high
levels of anxiety, the current
Cowell health survey suggests
that a significant number of
students have also experi
enced at least one major per
sonal crisis since enrolling at
Stanford. When asked, "Since
you came to Stanford has
something really bad or
traumatic happend to you that
was difficult to handle?" a
third of the respondents an
swered in the affirmative.
Are there any predominant
patterns in who has experi
enced these personal crises?
The answer is yes. Preliminary
results indicate that women
(42 percent) experienced these
events in higher proportion
than men (28 percent), and un
dergraduates (38 percent)
more frequently than graduate
students (29 percent).
There also seems to be a sig
nificant pattern in the type of
personal crisis that students
find difficult to handle. Indis-
putably, the most often-noted
crisis event involves partner
related matters (i.e., break-up,
problems in the relationship,
rejection, etc.). Next came per
sonal problems anxiety, de
pression, loneliness, identity
concerns. The third involved
academic matters such as aca
demic demands and problems
and feelings of inadequacy. Fi
nally, students reported con
cern over events affecting their
health and the health of
others.
There were also a number of
students who said they had ex
perienced multiple traumatic
events since coming to Stan
ford. We don't know if these
multiple events have served to
"build character" for these
students, or simply to wear
them down.
But it is clear that a large
number of Stanford students
are either experiencing signifi
cant tension and/or significant
life crisis. As noted, nearly
half feel anxious or tense most
of the time and a third re
ported having experienced a

traumatic event that they
found difficult to handle. One
has to wonder how students
are coping with these life
demands.
The survey provides some
valuable insights in at least a
couple of coping mechanisms:
personal resources and the use
of social support. It is clear
that despite the on-going
duress students feel, a signifi
cant number of students call
upon inner resources. For ex
ample, 84 percent of the re
spondents often feel satisfied
with themselves and 33 per
cent often feel energetic. With
respect to social support, the
survey provides encouraging
news. Only one percent of the
respondents dealt with their
crises alone. The other 99 per
cent talked to someone about
their crises. Most talked to
friends. One out of five talked
to family members and almost
as many talked with their
spouses or intimate partners.
Nine percent talked to a Coun
seling and Psychological
Services or Cowell staff mem
ber. To a lesser extent, stu
dents also talked to acquain

tances", RAs and RFs, academic
advisors, faculty members or
TAs, priests, rabbis, ministers,
and lawyers.
Given that stressful life
events are part of living, it is
encouraging that students are
using both the inner and social
resources available to them.
Research is increasingly
demonstrating the value of
these resources during those
crises and major transition
times in our lives.
It has heen written that
people who have someone
who cares for them are more
likely to adequately resolve
tension than those who do not.
Even without employing the
resources of others, simply
knowing that these are
available increases one's re
sources. The nest time you
wonder if you should take the
time to have dinner with a
friend, keep in mind that there
is a strong case for maintain
ing social support in our
everyday lives. Having it can
be the best way to make sure
that it's there when we need it
most.
