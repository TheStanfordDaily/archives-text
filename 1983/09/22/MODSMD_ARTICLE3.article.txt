# How we can survive traumatic life events
## 
### ALEJANDRO MARTINEZ Staff psychologist 
It has been suggested that
stress is a natural by-product
of all activities,. The ordinary
deportment of daily life
eating, not eating, exercising,
not exercising, having a lover
or a mate, not having a lover or
a mate, sleeping, not sleeping,
taking on difficult tasks,
avoiding difficult tasks all
effect the dynamic steady state
of an individual. In other
words, every life event is
stressful to some degree.
Yet it does not follow that
all life events are stressful to
the same degree nor that all
stress arises in negative cir

graduate program, getting

shown that prolonged, un

of stress-related disorders. Yet,
in addition to on-going high
levels of anxiety, the current
Cowell health survey suggests
that a significant number of
students have also experi
enced at least one major per
sonal crisis since enrolling at
Stanford. When asked, "Since
you came to Stanford has
something really bad or
traumatic happend to you that
was difficult to handle?" a
third of the respondents an

Are there any predominant
patterns in who has experi
enced these personal crises?
The answer is yes. Preliminary
results indicate that women
(42 percent) experienced these
events in higher proportion
than men (28 percent), and un
dergraduates (38 percent)
more frequently than graduate
students (29 percent).
There also seems to be a sig
nificant pattern in the type of
personal crisis that students
find difficult to handle. Indis-
