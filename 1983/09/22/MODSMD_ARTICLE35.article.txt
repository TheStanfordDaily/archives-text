# Lost? A campus tour might help
## 
### JENNIFER ROSEN 
Ever wonder how many bricks there are
in Meyer Library? Or how many showers in
Branner Hall?
These and other questions are answered
on student-led campus tours, offered
Monday through Saturday at 11 a.m. and'
2:15 p.m., and Sunday at 2:15 p.m.,
originating at the information booth at the
front of the Quad.
Hosea Belcher, student director of the
Guide and Visitors Service, says the tour
guide business is exciting.
"It gives you a chance to interact with all
types of people—prospective students,
cheerleaders, football players, alumni.
You meet VIPs like (former President
Jimmy) Carter, and the British ambas
sador. You never know who is going to
show up at Hoover Tower," he said.
Sophomore tour guide Donna Clark ag
reed. "You get to meet different people
from all over the world. You tell them

about Stanford, and they tell you all about
their culture," she said.
"It's amazing how popular Stanford is.
You don't realize its importance within
California, but people come from over
seas and all over the country just to see
Stanford," she said.
According to Belcher, the most com
mon question asked is, "Where's the bat
hroom?" But adult visitors also ask about
admissions and financial aid.
"Students tend to ask more questions
about social life, athletics, and the
weather," Belcher said. "Visitors, impres
sed by the weather and beauty of the
campus, ask me, 'How could you go to
school here, and study at the same time?' I
tell them I don't."
According to Clark, visitors are most
impressed by Memorial Church and enjoy
being "in the heart of things" in White
Plaza.
The tour also includes visits to the

School of Engineering, Bowman Alumni
House, Tresidder Union and Hoover To
wer.
Belcher, a four-year tour guide veteran,
said he has grown from his tour guide ex
perience. "It's a great opportunity for a
person. You have to be personal but give
the facts—you can't be shy. I've grown
more confident as a speaker."
Students who are considering attending
the University often take a tour to help
them make their decisions.
"Prospective students on my tours
come up to me later and say, 'You really
helped me a lot. . . that's why I decided to
come.' That really makes you feel good,"
Belcher said.
And the qualifications needed to be a
tour guide?
"You really have to love Stanford to be a
guide, and share with others how great a
place it is to go to school," Belcher said.
