# Mandatory candy, Hello Days
## Traditions you're lucky you missed 
### 
Puzzling over that row of bronze num
bered plaques in front of Memorial
Church? Those plaques, set in the tiles of
the Quad since 1892, conceal one of the
few remaining Stanford traditions.
Each graduating class over the years has
interred a time capsule containing the
memorabilia of its short era at Stanford—
everything from armbands to the Saturday
Night Fever soundtrack, from Lacoste
shirts to punk rock paraphernalia. The
capsules are to be opened, one per year,
starting with the University's centennial in
1992.
But other Stanford traditions have not
stood the test of time so well and li ke many
collegiate whims have gone the way of
panty raids and streaking.
Some conventions out of the Stanford
archives that freshmen need not learn, but
may enjoy reading, include:
• No freshmen men are allowed on the
Row.

• No smoking in the Quad.
• No women on the steps of the Law build
ing (which is now the Political Science
Department.)
• No corsages at Stanford dances except
the Senior Ball.
• Ride-sharing seekers congregate under
the big oak tree by the History Corner.
• Only skirts may be worn by women
travelling beyond the Post Office toward
the Quad.
• Candy or flowers are a must for women
subjected to the indignity of being
locked out after dormitory closing
hours.
• No men allowed in women's dorms ex
cept in social rooms.
• No women allowed alone in men's
dorms, fraternities or off campus.
•An annual Hello Day in the fall when
everyone must say hello to everyone
else.

• And last but not least, the traditional Big
Came bonfire has been forever extin
guished.
The demise of many of these traditions
came with woman's liberation and the
sexual revolution of the 19605. Others just
faded into a past that held such scriptures
more dearly.
Some new traditions such as following
the Band to the City the night before Big
Game, Jack's runs and the great paper
airplane show during the Sunday Flicks
have risen to take the old formalities'
place.
However, freshmen women must still
be on their guard for one tradition which is
still going strong. As legend has it, in fact,
one cannot truly be called a Stanford
woman until one has been kissed by a
senior man in the middle of the Quad at
midnight under a full moon. Bring a bottle
of champagne and do it up right you'll
be in good company.

KISS AND TELL: A freshman female becomes a true Stanford woman with a kiss from a
senior under the full moon in the Quad. Or so the legend goes. The moonlight kiss is one
of the few traditions that has survived - for better or for worse - the test of time.
