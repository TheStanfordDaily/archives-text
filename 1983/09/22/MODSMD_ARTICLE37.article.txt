# Campus counseling can help you through hard times
## 
### KAREN SPRINGEN KRISHNA WEST 
These are the best years of
your life, right? What's more,
you're spending them in
California, where the sun
soothes all worries, right?
'Not necessarily.
During the first year of col
lege, freshmen encounter all
kinds of unexpected stress.
Psychologists say that a general
feeling of anxiousness com
bined with a heavy work load,
new living conditions and new
roommates mean that some
students experience the first
real anxiety of their lives as
freshmen.
Fortunately, a number of
groups are ready to help.
"Sometimes you just need to
talk to someone," said
graduate Dayna Goldfine, a
former resident assistant who
has had counseling herself. "I
wished I would have learned
about (counseling services)
sooner."
Indeed, there's plenty to
learn about.
Orientation volunteers and
resident assistants usually pro
vide the first answers. In addi
tion to being information
sources and counselors them
selves, these people can refer
you to the appropriate agen
cies.
A first step for many students
who need help is a trip to The
Bridge, Stanford's community
center for peer counseling.
The student volunteers who
staff The Bridge are there to
"listen, to explore feelings or
to discuss problems and frust
rations concerning school,
sex, drug, relationships and
life."
But according to The
Bridge's manual, the volun
teers "don't tell people what
they'should'do." Itcontinues,
"We don't give advice. We are
not professionals and we do
.not assume that we can know
what a person is thinking or
feeling better than that person
him/herself."
The staffers at The Bridge
handle everything from re
quests for legal assistance and
gay housing information to
coping with paranoid delu
sions and attempts at suicide.
But the group also helps stu
dents deal with eating disor
ders, job-related conflicts,
anger, frustration, divorce,
incest, depression and
academic troubles.
And if counselors at The
Bridge feel uncomfortable
dealing with a particular prob
lem, they will refer callers to
other Bay Area support groups.
The Bridge is open five days a

week and live-in staffers are on
call all night.
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), a part of the
University health service, pro
vides professional personal
and general counseling help to
students.
All students are eligible to
use the service, either on a self
or resident assistant-referral.
The 1200 to 1500 students—
about 10 percent of the Univer
sity population—who use
CAPS each academic year aver
age three to four visits each.
Each dorm has a CAPS rep
resentative who works closely
with residence staff, providing
a formal counseling structure
within the residences.
Advising associates who work
with residence assistants and
residence fellows are coordi
nated by the Academic Infor
mation Center and the Resi

dential Education office.
But Res. Ed. warns that no
advisers are miracle workers.
Unfortunately, Res. Ed. offi
cials complain, many students
build up inflated expectations
of what advisers can do.
They caution students
against believing that advisers
have "computer-like brains
which store and regularly up
date all information in Courses
and Degrees, Course Abstracts,
The ASSU Course Guide and
the Time Schedule and that
"without any effort at all . . .
you and your adviser will au
tomatically become best of
friends. Your adviser will call
you regularly for tennis, din
ner, a movie or a Caribbean
cruise."
The Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC), will
provide resume assistance,

help with job interview
techniques and provide career
counseling.
For specific acadmic coun
seling and information, the
Academic Information Center
(AIC) and the Learning Assis
tance Center are available.
The LAC offers a study skills
course for credit, and Alice
Supton of Res. Ed. stresses that
students should not wait until
they are "in some trouble to
take that course."
Peer counseling and tutor
ing are also available at the
LAC.
The AIC, located in Old Un
ion, offers on-call advisers and
pre-professional training.
Other academic help centers
include the Term paper advisory
service in Meyer library and the
English deparment tutorial
center.
Cowell Health Center offers
confidential contraceptive peer
counseling, often acting as a re
ferral service for abortion
counseling, prenatal care and
price information.
Peer counselors at Cowell
must take a two-part class in
cluding both medical and peer
counseling.
Students may also make an
appointment to see the Cowell
gynecologist or nurse prac
titioner.
Planned Parenthood offers an
alternative pregnancy and
counseling service. The
service except for abortions
is free, but the group asks
for donations.
Palo Alto is the national
headquarters for the Venereal
Disease National Hotline, oper
ated by the American Social
Health Association. Students
here volunteer at the center
and may receive academic
credit through the Stanford
Clearinghouse Catalog of In
ternship and Research Oppor
tunities (SCIRE) program.
Callers are usually referred
to one of 2000 crisis interven
tion centers of one of 5000
clinics throughout the United
States.
In the end, the decision to
seek counseling is up to the in
dividual student. "What we try
to do through the residence
staff is to remove any barriers
students have to seeking
help," Supton said. "There are
going to be some rough times.
We want students to know that
help is available."

ders, job-related conflicts,
anger, frustration, divorce,
incest, depression and
academic troubles.
And if counselors at The
Bridge feel uncomfortable
dealing with a particular prob

other Bay Area support groups.
The Bridge is open five days a

week and live-in staffers are on
call all night.
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), a part of the
University health service, pro
vides professional personal
and general counseling help to
students.
All students are eligible to
use the service, either on a self
or resident assistant-referral.
The 1200 to 1500 students—
about 10 percent of the Univer
sity population—who use
CAPS each academic year aver
age three to four visits each.
Each dorm has a CAPS rep
resentative who works closely
with residence staff, providing
a formal counseling structure
within the residences.
Advising associates who work
with residence assistants and
residence fellows are coordi
nated by the Academic Infor
mation Center and the Resi

dential Education office.
But Res. Ed. warns that no
advisers are miracle workers.
Unfortunately, Res. Ed. offi
cials complain, many students
build up inflated expectations
of what advisers can do.
They caution students
against believing that advisers
have "computer-like brains
which store and regularly up
date all information in Courses
and Degrees, Course Abstracts,
The ASSU Course Guide and
the Time Schedule and that
"without any effort at all . . .
you and your adviser will au
tomatically become best of
friends. Your adviser will call
you regularly for tennis, din
ner, a movie or a Caribbean
cruise."
The Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC), will
provide resume assistance,

help with job interview
techniques and provide career
counseling.
For specific acadmic coun
seling and information, the
Academic Information Center
(AIC) and the Learning Assis
tance Center are available.
The LAC offers a study skills
course for credit, and Alice
Supton of Res. Ed. stresses that
students should not wait until
they are "in some trouble to
take that course."
Peer counseling and tutor
ing are also available at the
LAC.
The AIC, located in Old Un
ion, offers on-call advisers and
pre-professional training.
Other academic help centers
include the Term paper advisory
service in Meyer library and the
English deparment tutorial
center.
Cowell Health Center offers
confidential contraceptive peer
counseling, often acting as a re
ferral service for abortion
counseling, prenatal care and
price information.
Peer counselors at Cowell
must take a two-part class in
cluding both medical and peer
counseling.
Students may also make an
appointment to see the Cowell
gynecologist or nurse prac
titioner.
Planned Parenthood offers an
alternative pregnancy and
counseling service. The
service except for abortions
is free, but the group asks
for donations.
Palo Alto is the national
headquarters for the Venereal
Disease National Hotline, oper
ated by the American Social
Health Association. Students
here volunteer at the center
and may receive academic
credit through the Stanford
Clearinghouse Catalog of In
ternship and Research Oppor
tunities (SCIRE) program.
Callers are usually referred
to one of 2000 crisis interven
tion centers of one of 5000
clinics throughout the United
States.
In the end, the decision to
seek counseling is up to the in
dividual student. "What we try
to do through the residence
staff is to remove any barriers
students have to seeking
help," Supton said. "There are
going to be some rough times.
We want students to know that
help is available."

These are the best years of
your life, right? What's more,
you're spending them in
California, where the sun
soothes all worries, right?
'Not necessarily.
During the first year of col
lege, freshmen encounter all
kinds of unexpected stress.
Psychologists say that a general
feeling of anxiousness com
bined with a heavy work load,
new living conditions and new
roommates mean that some
students experience the first
real anxiety of their lives as
freshmen.
Fortunately, a number of
groups are ready to help.
"Sometimes you just need to
talk to someone," said
graduate Dayna Goldfine, a
former resident assistant who
has had counseling herself. "I
wished I would have learned
about (counseling services)
sooner."
Indeed, there's plenty to
learn about.
Orientation volunteers and
resident assistants usually pro
vide the first answers. In addi
tion to being information
sources and counselors them
selves, these people can refer
you to the appropriate agen
cies.
A first step for many students
who need help is a trip to The
Bridge, Stanford's community
center for peer counseling.
The student volunteers who
staff The Bridge are there to
"listen, to explore feelings or
to discuss problems and frust
rations concerning school,
sex, drug, relationships and
life."
But according to The
Bridge's manual, the volun
teers "don't tell people what
they'should'do." Itcontinues,
"We don't give advice. We are
not professionals and we do
.not assume that we can know
what a person is thinking or
feeling better than that person
him/herself."
The staffers at The Bridge
handle everything from re
quests for legal assistance and
gay housing information to
coping with paranoid delu
sions and attempts at suicide.
But the group also helps stu
dents deal with eating disor
ders, job-related conflicts,
anger, frustration, divorce,
incest, depression and
academic troubles.
And if counselors at The
Bridge feel uncomfortable
dealing with a particular prob
lem, they will refer callers to
other Bay Area support groups.
