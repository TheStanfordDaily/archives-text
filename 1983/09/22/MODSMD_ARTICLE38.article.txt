With Hoo Tow, ASSU, Flo Mo, Dink, The Claw and
Mem everything part of the standard Stanford voc
abulary, the visitor needs a dictionary just to keep up
with the conversation. .
This list of the various parts of Stanford-speak, along
with appropriate English translations, should provide
some help.

ASSU —Associated Students of Stanford
University, the student government.'
Headed by a council of four co-presidents
and a student senate, the ASSU sponsors,
among other things, the Sunday Flicks, a
refrigerator rental service, the Coffee
House and the Guest Professorship Board.
AXE The symbol of rivalry between
Stanford and UC-Berkeley (Cal). The Axe is
awarded to the winner of the Big Game
(see below), but not to the winner of The
Big Came (also see below). Periodically, a
group from the dispossessed school at
tempts to steal the Axe from the current
owner during Big Game week; The last
successful attempt was made by a Stanford
contingent in 1973. When Stanford owns
the Axe, it is displayed in a specially
constructed case in Tresidder Memorial
Union. A screw hangs in that case today.

BIG GAME The annual football game
between Stanford and Cal. Stanford won
the very first Big Game in 1892 under the
leadership of a team manager named Her
bert Hoover. Overall, Stanford leads the
rivalry 40-34 with 10 ties and one very big
argument (see below). Stanford will host
this year's Big Game on November 19.
THE BIG GAME Not to be confused
with the Big Game. The Big Game can only
mean the most recent chapter in the
Stanford-Cal rivalry. In the final seconds of
the 1982 Big Game, Stanford went ahead
20-19. That's when things went astray. With
Stanford fans dancing to the Band's All
Right Now, the two teams lined up for the
kick-off. A Cal player started running with
the ball, then a lateral, then a tackle, a

lateral, a tackle, a lateral until Cal player
Kevin Moen rammed into a Stanford trom
bonist and scored for Cal. Or did he? At
least one photograph showed an official
blowing the play dead after one of the first
tackles. Hours of instant replay and a fake
Daily Cal proclaiming a Stanford victory la
ter, the Golden Bear still owned the Axe.
CARDINAL It's not a bird, a plane, a
griffin, or a robber baron. It's a color and
it's final. The University has finally de
cided, after a 10-year battle, that Stanford
athletic teams will be designed by the car
dinal color.
THE CLAW Not a man-eater, just the,
ahem, indescribable sculpture which,
ahem, graces White Plaza.

again.

rent reason, runs into the ocean and

Hoover's institute on "War, Revolution
and Peace." A campus-wide controversy
