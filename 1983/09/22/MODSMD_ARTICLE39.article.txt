# The
						powers that be: Stanford's Board of Trustees
## 
### 
Most students will never meet them but their actions
affect every part of "The Stanford experience."
The Board of Trustees, as custodians of the Universi
ty's endowment and properties, sets the University's
annual budget, steers the future course of the Uni
verstiy, appoints (and removes) University presidents
and fixes salaries for faculty members.
Moreover, the Board is charged with the more difficult
duty of establishing and maintaining "an educational
system which will, iffollowed, fit the graduate with some
useful pursuit, and to this end to cause the pupils, as
early as may be, to declare the particular calling which in
life they may desire to pursue. . ."
