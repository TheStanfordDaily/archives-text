A look around the Stanford
campus reveals that almost
everyone owns a pair of athlet
ic shoes, shorts, and a T-shirt.
However, the Cowell survey
shows that only 47.5 percent
of Stanford students use them
as often as they should. They
are the ones who engage in
vigorous physical exercise for
at least 20 continuous minutes
per session several times a
week. 19.5 percent of this
group exercises daily.
The question was phrased to
determine how many students
were getting aerobic exercise
in sufficient amounts. One can
accrue all the health and psy
chological benefit of aerobic
exercise by doing it for 20
minutes every other day
While this is the minimum,
students can easily squeeze
this amount of time into busy
schedules. What many non
exercising students have yet to
realize is that this amount of
regular exercise makes busy
schedules more manageable.
Students' reasons for their
inactivity focus on a perceived
lack of time or lack of motiva
tion. These are the most com
mon barriers to regular exer-
Often the time spent prepar
ing for, participating in, and
showering after a workout
seems too much to deal with.
However, non-exercisers or ir
regular exercisers should talk
to those who exercise regular
ly. They report more energy,
less stress, and more produc -
tivity when exercising regular
ly Time is saved in the long
run. And the sense of well

being that no one can quantity
is reported by virtually every
regular exerciser.
Other, more long-term
benefits from regular exercise
include weight loss, better
metabolism of sugars, preven
tion of bone and joint disor
ders, blood pressure reduc
tion, and prevention of heart
disease. But for most students
the most compelling reasons
to exercise regularly are the re
ported feelings oi more pro
ductivity, more self
confidence, less depression,
less stress, and an increased
ability to sleep better at night.
for those 52.5 percent of
Stanford students who don't
regularly exercise, consider
trying any of a variety of exer
cises to tit your style: jogging,
aerobic; dance, walking, swim
ming, cycling, or hiking
Motivation can be difficult.
The benefits often seem long
term and the immediate
workout can seem tiring and,
for some, even painful. The
best way to enhance your mo
tivation to execise is simply to
do it. A good trial period is
two weeks. Plan your schedule
and stick to it for this time per
iod.
Don't overdo your exercise
session to speed up getting
into shape. Over exertion
won't help; it will only make
you worn out and tired.
Two weeks is enough time
to begin to feel the benefits
lh.it accompany exercise. It is
simply a matter of putting on
those shoes, shorts, and T
shirt you already have and get
ting out the door on those first
few days.
