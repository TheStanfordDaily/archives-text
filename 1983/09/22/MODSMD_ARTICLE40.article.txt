# How did I ever get this roommate?
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
You made it successfully through the admissions process
months ago. But over the summer, your vital statistics were being
scrutinized yet another time —during your roommate pairing.
No, despite all the rumors to the contrary, they don't pair
freshman roommates by height, but hometowns, family size,
music preference and not a little bit of luck do enter into the
process.
"It's all a value judgment," said Eric Lansverk, one of the two
freshman coordinators that handle the "roommating." "But we
don't have any set criteria because people don't fit into a set
mold, especially when the only information you have about them
is condensed onto a little white (housing) card."
For the sake of generalization, you can count on a few stan
dards in selection:
•If you're from California, your roommate will not be from
California.
•If you're from out of state, there's a good chance your room
mate will be from California since 50 percent of the class is from
California.
•You will share some common interest with your roommate.
•You won't know who your roommate is until the day you arrive
because changes are made down to the last minute.
The roommating—which is done in about a week—is handled
by two upperclassmen who work closely with the Office of Ad
missions, the office of Residential Education (Res. Ed.), and the
Academic Information Center.

Much in the style of the Admissions Office, the two coor
dinators pursue a goal of "diversity but compatibility" in making
roommate decisions. The coordinators try to make the system
personal.
Said Lansverk, "I've had fathers call me and say, Tm so glad
that my son won't be a number like my other son was at Har
vard.' "
According to administrators, the personal touch is more a
question of style than of anything else. "There is some feeling
that random processes work just as well as the hand-picked
process," said Roger Whitney of the Housing Office. "But that's
not the way we do it here at Stanford."
Despite the effort to be personal, many of the choices are
already made for the coordinators: the Housing Office gives
them a "freshman configuration" which determines how many
freshman will be in each dorm, sometimes even down to the
rooms reserved for freshmen.
To the extent that the freshman configuration allows, indi
vidual preferences and requests to be involved in special prog
rams are accomodated first. Then the creative, and subjective,
part of the process begins.
"We put people into dorms first off," said Alison Hardy, one of
the freshman coordinators. "From there we just do our best to fill
their preferences. I guess after a while .that people just start
looking like they should be roommated. We look for a common
ground, something they can share . . . but obviously you don't
want to put clones together."
