# Campus politics: the times are changing-or are they?

### BILL AINSWORTH TIM GRIEVE 
When people think of politi
cal activism, a few universities
instantly come to mind. UC-
Berkeley. Kent State. Ohio
State. But Stanford has its own
tradition of student protest as
well.
Student participation in the
campus violence of the late
1960s and early 1970s here was
as heavy as that at any major
university.
Thousands of students and
faculty members participated
in the April 3, 1969 protest
against classified research at
the University and at the then-
Stanford Research Institute.
The Board of Trustees even
tually succumbed to pressure
from students and faculty
members, disallowing clas
sified research on campus and
severing ties with the Stanford
Research Institute.
Now banned from using the
Stanford name, the industrial
park is known only by the ac
ronym SRI.
The following year, the issue
of permitting students to ob
tain academic credit for ROTC
classes sparked two weeks of
protest, escalating into violent
riots causing at least $15,000
worth of damage as well as in
juries to several students and
police.
As a response to the expan
sion of U.S. involvement in
Southeast Asia into Cambodia
in 1970, more than 8000 stu
dents and faculty members at
tended a mass rally in Frost
Amphitheatre.
A student strike im
plemented after the Cambo
dian expansion was honored
by almost two-thirds of the
student population. As a result
of the strike, the campus was
closed for several days.
But since the violent erup
tions of the late '6os and early
70s, student activism at Stan
ford, as at other universities,
has taken on a milder tone, and
many students avoid politics al
together.
Jim Steyer, a member of the
Stanford Progressive Alliance,
said that he sees a good deal of
political apathy at Stanford.
"There's greater participa
tion and awareness, but rela
tive to five years ago the stu
dent body today is pretty
apathetic," he said. "If you're
looking for a major trend in
student activism, I don't think
it exists right now."
Last fall, John Mattox, direc
tor of.the Stanford Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Forum,
said that students "don't think
they can have an effect" on na

tional political issues. He said
that many students seem in
terested in issues like the nuc
lear freeze, but "they don't
seem concerned enough to do
anything about it."
Although Edward Romero of
the Stanford Democrats was
disappointed by the apathy
students showed toward last
fall's state elections, he said he
understands the time conflict
students face.
"With 18 units and a chem
problem set, it is difficult to
devote a lot of time to politics,"
Romero said as elections
neared last year.
Major issues in politics now,
such as nuclear weapons and
education cutbacks, "are all
important issues in students'
lives," Romero said. "It's sad
that students don't know the
stances; it makes them suscep
tible to a lot of rhetoric."
But that isn't to say that stu
dents here are without opin
ions or that they have given up
on political activism.
Despite or maybe because
of the University's strong
ties to the Reagan administra
tion (many of the president's
advisers are fellows at the
Hoover Institution), students
here are slightly more liberal
than the general population of
the country.
A study conducted for the
American Council on Educa
tion of 188,692 college
freshmen indicated that 32
percent of last year's entering
class here called themselves
"liberal," compared to 27 per
cent of the entering freshmen
at "highly selective private uni
versities" nationwide.
The highest percentage of
Stanford freshmen 42 per
cent called themselves
"middle of the road" politi
cally, while 24.1 percent said
they were "conservative."
Only about 2 percent called
themselves either "far left" or
"far right."
The political activity on cam
pus over the past two years re
flects the liberal leanings of
Stanford students.
President Reagan's defense
and foreign policies have fallen
under repeated attack at
numerous rallies and protests.
About 120 students partici
pated in a Cinco de Mayo rally
and march to Secretary of State
George Shultz's campus resi
dence to protest U.S. involve
ment in Central America.
Anotherlso people marched
in the rain from White Plaza to
Universfty President Donald
Kennedy's office in spring to
protest a proposal at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation

Laboratory that would involve
weapons-related research.
Many graduating seniors and
some faculty members wore
armbands at commencement
exercises in June to show guest
speaker Shultz their disap
proval of the U.S. role in Cent
ral America.
The Stanford Progressive Al
liance (SPA) often acts as a sort
of clearinghouse for liberal
thought on campus.
An outgrowth of the Stan
ford Organizing Committee of
1967-78, SPA is geared toward
forming a coalition of Third
World, minority, women's and
"traditional white progressive"
groups, Steyer said.
He explained that women's,
minority and Third World
groups have been hurt in the
past by their isolation from one
another, something SPA set
out to change.
Steyer estimated that last
year SPA consisted of 40 diffe
rent groups. The organization,
he said, has a "self-defining
membership. The word 'prog
ressive' is self-defining. We
leave it open."
Steyer characterized SPA as
"broad-minded, non
dogmatic, open to many diffe
rent opinions." He said that it
is important for the organiza
tion to agree on common goals
"because so often liberals have
been torn apart by details."
The Stanford Conservative
Political Alliance (SCPA) was
formed in 1981 by a group of'
students who saw a "very one
sided campus approach (to
politics)," according to David
Eisner, last year's editor of The
Stanford Review, the SCPA's
newspaper.
"The Residential Education
program, the publications on
campus and the administration
all had a liberal bias. This one
sidedness was creating an
anti-intellectual atmosphere,"
Eisner said.
"What we decided to do was
create some kind of body whch
could intelligently present
conservative issues for discus
sion, to fill a very noticeable
void on campus," he
explained.
Eisner said his organization
is "steering very much away
from the idea of The
Dartmouth Review," a conser
vative publication at
Dartmouth College that plays
to a conservative audience.
"We are trying to present
conservative viewpoints to a
very broad audience," he said.
"We are just trying to show
people that it doesn't pay to be
anti-intellectual."

tion (many of the president's
advisers are fellows at the
Hoover Institution), students
here are slightly more liberal
than the general population of
the country.
A study conducted for the
American Council on Educa
tion of 188,692 college
freshmen indicated that 32
percent of last year's entering
class here called themselves
"liberal," compared to 27 per
cent of the entering freshmen
at "highly selective private uni
versities" nationwide.
The highest percentage of
Stanford freshmen 42 per
cent called themselves
"middle of the road" politi
cally, while 24.1 percent said
they were "conservative."
Only about 2 percent called
themselves either "far left" or
"far right."
The political activity on cam
pus over the past two years re
flects the liberal leanings of
Stanford students.
President Reagan's defense
and foreign policies have fallen
under repeated attack at
numerous rallies and protests.
About 120 students partici
pated in a Cinco de Mayo rally
and march to Secretary of State
George Shultz's campus resi
dence to protest U.S. involve
ment in Central America.
Anotherlso people marched
in the rain from White Plaza to
Universfty President Donald
Kennedy's office in spring to
protest a proposal at the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation

Laboratory that would involve
weapons-related research.
Many graduating seniors and
some faculty members wore
armbands at commencement
exercises in June to show guest
speaker Shultz their disap
proval of the U.S. role in Cent
ral America.
The Stanford Progressive Al
liance (SPA) often acts as a sort
of clearinghouse for liberal
thought on campus.
An outgrowth of the Stan
ford Organizing Committee of
1967-78, SPA is geared toward
forming a coalition of Third
World, minority, women's and
"traditional white progressive"
groups, Steyer said.
He explained that women's,
minority and Third World
groups have been hurt in the
past by their isolation from one
another, something SPA set
out to change.
Steyer estimated that last
year SPA consisted of 40 diffe
rent groups. The organization,
he said, has a "self-defining
membership. The word 'prog
ressive' is self-defining. We
leave it open."
Steyer characterized SPA as
"broad-minded, non
dogmatic, open to many diffe
rent opinions." He said that it
is important for the organiza
tion to agree on common goals
"because so often liberals have
been torn apart by details."
The Stanford Conservative
Political Alliance (SCPA) was
formed in 1981 by a group of'
students who saw a "very one
sided campus approach (to
politics)," according to David
Eisner, last year's editor of The
Stanford Review, the SCPA's
newspaper.
"The Residential Education
program, the publications on
campus and the administration
all had a liberal bias. This one
sidedness was creating an
anti-intellectual atmosphere,"
Eisner said.
"What we decided to do was
create some kind of body whch
could intelligently present
conservative issues for discus
sion, to fill a very noticeable
void on campus," he
explained.
Eisner said his organization
is "steering very much away
from the idea of The
Dartmouth Review," a conser
vative publication at
Dartmouth College that plays
to a conservative audience.
"We are trying to present
conservative viewpoints to a
very broad audience," he said.
"We are just trying to show
people that it doesn't pay to be
anti-intellectual."
When people think of politi
cal activism, a few universities
instantly come to mind. UC-
Berkeley. Kent State. Ohio
State. But Stanford has its own
tradition of student protest as
well.
Student participation in the
campus violence of the late
1960s and early 1970s here was
as heavy as that at any major
university.
Thousands of students and
faculty members participated
in the April 3, 1969 protest
against classified research at
the University and at the then-
Stanford Research Institute.
The Board of Trustees even
tually succumbed to pressure
from students and faculty
members, disallowing clas
sified research on campus and
severing ties with the Stanford
Research Institute.
Now banned from using the
Stanford name, the industrial
park is known only by the ac
ronym SRI.
The following year, the issue
of permitting students to ob
tain academic credit for ROTC
classes sparked two weeks of
protest, escalating into violent
riots causing at least $15,000
worth of damage as well as in
juries to several students and
police.
As a response to the expan
sion of U.S. involvement in
Southeast Asia into Cambodia
in 1970, more than 8000 stu
dents and faculty members at
tended a mass rally in Frost
Amphitheatre.
A student strike im
plemented after the Cambo
dian expansion was honored
by almost two-thirds of the
student population. As a result
of the strike, the campus was
closed for several days.
But since the violent erup
tions of the late '6os and early
70s, student activism at Stan
ford, as at other universities,
has taken on a milder tone, and
many students avoid politics al
together.
Jim Steyer, a member of the
Stanford Progressive Alliance,
said that he sees a good deal of
political apathy at Stanford.
"There's greater participa
tion and awareness, but rela
tive to five years ago the stu
dent body today is pretty
apathetic," he said. "If you're
looking for a major trend in
student activism, I don't think
it exists right now."
Last fall, John Mattox, direc
tor of.the Stanford Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Forum,
said that students "don't think
they can have an effect" on na

tional political issues. He said
that many students seem in
terested in issues like the nuc
lear freeze, but "they don't
seem concerned enough to do
anything about it."
Although Edward Romero of
the Stanford Democrats was
disappointed by the apathy
students showed toward last
fall's state elections, he said he
understands the time conflict
students face.
"With 18 units and a chem
problem set, it is difficult to
devote a lot of time to politics,"
Romero said as elections
neared last year.
Major issues in politics now,
such as nuclear weapons and
education cutbacks, "are all
important issues in students'
lives," Romero said. "It's sad
that students don't know the
stances; it makes them suscep
tible to a lot of rhetoric."
But that isn't to say that stu
dents here are without opin
ions or that they have given up
on political activism.
