# From farm to university, it's the history of Stanford
## 
### 
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the sum
mer of 1891 to be the Universi
ty's first president, he found
the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles
and more from near the head
of San Francisco Bay. Bounding
it on the southwest rises . . .
the Sierra de la Santa Cruz 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously' ....
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its
cloak of redwood, oak and
madrono diversified by thic
kets of chemisal ....
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30
miles south of San Francisco,
its favorable climate assured by
its situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Sen. and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,

Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the Univer
sity in the 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation
that it should never be sold.
To this land, Sen. Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the promi
nent landscape architect, Fre
derick Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the
foothills of the ranch, so as to
take advantage of the magnifi
cent view of the bay, but they
finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below,
at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quad
rangle. The senator felt the flat
site was more practical for later
expansion.
Olmsted worked out the
general concept for the
grounds and the buildings, but
it remained for the young Bos
ton architect, Charles Allerton

Coolidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent
architect of his time.
The style is called Richard
sonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanes
que, which is characterized by
rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half
circle arches supported by
short columns with decorated
capitals.
The inner quad of 12 class
room buildings with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church
and three engineering build
ings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were
ready for the University's
opening on October 1,1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew D. White
of Cornell pronounced the
Stanford buildings the most
beautiful college architecture

in America.
But just before five on the
morning of April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's
new buildings shook for 45
seconds. The great earthquake
killed two men on campus and
caused millions of dollars of
damage.
The ponderous church to
wer, with its clocks, chimes
and spire, crashed into the
chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out
the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the
inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad
100 feet high and decorated
with a frieze depicting the
march of civilization was
damaged beyond repair. So
were a library and gymnasium
that were just short of comple
tion. None of these was re
placed.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed uhtil the fall. Seniors
in what has come to be known

AN EARLY LOOK: Stanford has changed a bit since the University first opened close to 100
years ago, as this photo from the University's archives proves.
