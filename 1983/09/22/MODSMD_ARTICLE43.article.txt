# From farm to university, it's the history of Stanford
## 
### 
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the sum
mer of 1891 to be the Universi
ty's first president, he found
the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles
and more from near the head
of San Francisco Bay. Bounding
it on the southwest rises . . .
the Sierra de la Santa Cruz 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously' ....
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its
cloak of redwood, oak and
madrono diversified by thic
kets of chemisal ....
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30
miles south of San Francisco,
its favorable climate assured by
its situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Sen. and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,

Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the Univer
sity in the 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation
that it should never be sold.
To this land, Sen. Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the promi
nent landscape architect, Fre
derick Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the
foothills of the ranch, so as to
take advantage of the magnifi
cent view of the bay, but they
finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below,
at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quad
rangle. The senator felt the flat
site was more practical for later
expansion.
Olmsted worked out the
general concept for the
grounds and the buildings, but
it remained for the young Bos
ton architect, Charles Allerton

Coolidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent
architect of his time.
The style is called Richard
sonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanes
que, which is characterized by
rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half
circle arches supported by
short columns with decorated
capitals.
The inner quad of 12 class
room buildings with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church
and three engineering build
ings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were
ready for the University's
opening on October 1,1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew D. White
of Cornell pronounced the
Stanford buildings the most
beautiful college architecture

in America.
But just before five on the
morning of April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's
new buildings shook for 45
seconds. The great earthquake
killed two men on campus and
caused millions of dollars of
damage.
The ponderous church to
wer, with its clocks, chimes
and spire, crashed into the
chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out
the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the
inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad
100 feet high and decorated
with a frieze depicting the
march of civilization was
damaged beyond repair. So
were a library and gymnasium
that were just short of comple
tion. None of these was re
placed.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed uhtil the fall. Seniors

years ago, as this photo from the University's archives proves.
as "The Earthquake Class"
were voted their degrees in
May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pur
suing a construction project
that was begun in 1886 and that
has been intermittently con
tinued up to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the
Stanford land, comprised for
the most part of the central
portion running from El
Camino Real to the back boun
dary in the foothills.
The areas designated for
light lie in open land, including
the arboretum, golf course and
the foothill lands used for
space-probing antennae and
research in nuclear physics and
biological sciences.
The inner and outer quads
occupy 17 acres at the heart of
the academic area. The inner
quad's 12 classroom buildings,
two of which are now used by
the presidentand his staff, date
from the time the University
opened in 1891, while the
outer quad was completed in
1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedi
cated.

Buildings in the outer quad
are being brought up to
earthquake-proof standards by
an "inside-out" process of
construction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of
no particular denomination. In
the Founding Grant, they di
rected the trustees "to have
taught in the University the
immortality of the soul, the
existence of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the
highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and
the University were to be non
sectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
In the original plans, the
central site now occupied by
the church was reserved for it,
though construction was de
ferred. When Senator Stanford
died in 1893, his widow deter
mined that the church would
be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permis
sion to copy the Roselli fresco
of the "Last Supper" in the Sis
tine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depict

ing the history of redemption.
The larges mosaic, however,
occupies most of the facade of
the church and, with 47 fi
gures, depicts the Sermon on
the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around
a steel framework. Another set
of mosaics was brought from
Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes,
was never rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower
and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace millions of items
that include books, docu
ments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters,
maps and photos. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building,
completed in 1978, honors the
former president's humanita
rian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World
War I when he headed the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him
in a position to document the
war, Hoover shipped crates of
material to the library at Stan
ford, his alma mater, and laid
the literary foundation of the

Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony,
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a
challenge to those who prom
ote war. They should attract
those who search for peace."
The Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere out
side Russia. It has more data on
Mussolini than can be found in
Italy. It also probably has the
most complete record on Hi
tler and the Nazi movement ex
tant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research
on problems of social, political
and economic change in the
20th century.
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (Au
ditorium), dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War I, the au
ditorium also contains in the
foyer plaques honoring the
Stanford dead of World War 11.
The main auditorium seats 1700
and the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is
White Memorial Plaza, a
200,000 square foot landscaped
area donated to the University
by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond
White in memory of their sons.
The focal point of the plaza is a

Bordered by the bookstore,

rial Union, the music building
and the Old Union which
contains several student ser
vices the plaza is a campus
crossroads.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm
one of the most productive and
varied programs of ionos
pheric and interplanetary radio
investigation. Its scientists
priade the first radar contact
with the sun.
The most spectacular of the
antennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary
gases by means of a radar
beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along
Sand Hill Road. The $ll4 mill
ion machine, financed by the
Atomic Energy Commission
and completed in 1966, fires
the electron down a straight,
slender tube rather than whirl
ing protons in circles, as most
atom smashers do. The
' machine develops an energy of
20 billion electron volts.
As the 70s end, the Univer
sity draws to a close its so

called "Second Great Stone
Age," a building boom
launched in the early '6os in
which the University has at
tempted to meet its big post
war expansion in students and
faculty.
In the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325
million to pay for new campus
facilities and improvements,
including campus landmarks
such as Maples Pavilion, Meyer
Library, the Green Library an
'nex, the Terman Engineering
Center and the Mudd Chemis
try building.
Now, however, as the Uni
versity stabilizes its popula
tion, it plans fewer major build
ing projects for the coming
years.
Construction projects such
as the nearly-completed Braun
music building and the just
finished new dormitories do
depend largely on the be
neficience of University
donors and in this inflationary
age, the University may have
difficulty raising more funds.
Even if all building were to
stop today, though, the Uni
versity would still look much
different on its 100 th anniver
sary than it did on that day in
1886 when Sen. Stanford de
cided to locate his new univer
sity on the site of his horse
farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding
horses ought to be good
enough for teaching students.

mined that the church would
be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permis
sion to copy the Roselli fresco
of the "Last Supper" in the Sis
tine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depict

ing the history of redemption.
The larges mosaic, however,
occupies most of the facade of
the church and, with 47 fi
gures, depicts the Sermon on
the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around
a steel framework. Another set
of mosaics was brought from
Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes,
was never rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower
and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace millions of items
that include books, docu
ments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters,
maps and photos. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building,
completed in 1978, honors the
former president's humanita
rian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World
War I when he headed the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him
in a position to document the
war, Hoover shipped crates of
material to the library at Stan
ford, his alma mater, and laid
the literary foundation of the

Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony,
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a
challenge to those who prom
ote war. They should attract
those who search for peace."
The Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere out
side Russia. It has more data on
Mussolini than can be found in
Italy. It also probably has the
most complete record on Hi
tler and the Nazi movement ex
tant.
With these resources, the in

advanced study and research
on problems of social, political
and economic change in the
20th century.

COPS IN THE QUAD: Police cars crowd the Quad during student protests against the Vietnam War and ROTC classes on campus in the early 1970s.
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the sum
mer of 1891 to be the Universi
ty's first president, he found
the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles
and more from near the head
of San Francisco Bay. Bounding
it on the southwest rises . . .
the Sierra de la Santa Cruz 'a
misty camp of mountains
pitched tumultuously' ....
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming
its higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena, its
cloak of redwood, oak and
madrono diversified by thic
kets of chemisal ....
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively
barren and treeless Sierra del
Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30
miles south of San Francisco,
its favorable climate assured by
its situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Sen. and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,

Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the Univer
sity in the 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation
that it should never be sold.
To this land, Sen. Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the promi
nent landscape architect, Fre
derick Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the
foothills of the ranch, so as to
take advantage of the magnifi
cent view of the bay, but they
finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below,
at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quad
rangle. The senator felt the flat
site was more practical for later
expansion.
Olmsted worked out the
general concept for the
grounds and the buildings, but
it remained for the young Bos
ton architect, Charles Allerton

Coolidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent
architect of his time.
The style is called Richard
sonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanes
que, which is characterized by
rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half
circle arches supported by
short columns with decorated
capitals.
The inner quad of 12 class
room buildings with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church
and three engineering build
ings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were
ready for the University's
opening on October 1,1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew D. White
of Cornell pronounced the
Stanford buildings the most
beautiful college architecture

in America.
But just before five on the
morning of April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's
new buildings shook for 45
seconds. The great earthquake
killed two men on campus and
caused millions of dollars of
damage.
The ponderous church to
wer, with its clocks, chimes
and spire, crashed into the
chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out
the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the
inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad
100 feet high and decorated
with a frieze depicting the
march of civilization was
damaged beyond repair. So
were a library and gymnasium
that were just short of comple
tion. None of these was re
placed.

than $2 million. Classes were

as "The Earthquake Class"
were voted their degrees in
May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pur
suing a construction project
that was begun in 1886 and that
has been intermittently con
tinued up to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the
Stanford land, comprised for
the most part of the central
portion running from El
Camino Real to the back boun
dary in the foothills.
The areas designated for
light lie in open land, including
the arboretum, golf course and
the foothill lands used for
space-probing antennae and
research in nuclear physics and
biological sciences.
The inner and outer quads
occupy 17 acres at the heart of
the academic area. The inner
quad's 12 classroom buildings,
two of which are now used by
the presidentand his staff, date
from the time the University
opened in 1891, while the
outer quad was completed in
1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedi
cated.

Buildings in the outer quad
are being brought up to
earthquake-proof standards by
an "inside-out" process of
construction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of
no particular denomination. In
the Founding Grant, they di
rected the trustees "to have
taught in the University the
immortality of the soul, the
existence of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the
highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and
the University were to be non
sectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
In the original plans, the
central site now occupied by
the church was reserved for it,
though construction was de
ferred. When Senator Stanford
died in 1893, his widow deter
mined that the church would
be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permis
sion to copy the Roselli fresco
of the "Last Supper" in the Sis
tine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depict

ing the history of redemption.
The larges mosaic, however,
occupies most of the facade of
the church and, with 47 fi

the structure was completely

In this sheltered area 30
miles south of San Francisco,
its favorable climate assured by
its situation between bay and
ocean, its meadows patterned
with ancient oaks, Sen. and
Mrs. Leland Stanford estab
lished their university on the
site of their suburban home,

Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the Univer
sity in the 1885 Grant of En
dowment with the stipulation
that it should never be sold.
To this land, Sen. Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the promi
nent landscape architect, Fre
derick Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the
foothills of the ranch, so as to
take advantage of the magnifi
cent view of the bay, but they
finally decided to drive in a
stake in the grainfields below,
at a point that marks one
corner of the Inner Quad
rangle. The senator felt the flat
site was more practical for later
expansion.
Olmsted worked out the
general concept for the
grounds and the buildings, but
it remained for the young Bos
ton architect, Charles Allerton

Coolidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late men
tor, Henry Hobbs Richardson,
considered the most eminent
architect of his time.
The style is called Richard
sonian Romanesque, and it fol
lows the European Romanes
que, which is characterized by
rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades
formed of successive half
circle arches supported by
short columns with decorated
capitals.
The inner quad of 12 class
room buildings with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church
and three engineering build
ings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were
ready for the University's
opening on October 1,1891.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will
have their part in the students'
training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its les
son of grace and genuiness."
President Andrew D. White
of Cornell pronounced the
Stanford buildings the most
beautiful college architecture

in America.
But just before five on the
morning of April 18, 1906, the
ground beneath Stanford's
new buildings shook for 45
seconds. The great earthquake
killed two men on campus and
caused millions of dollars of
damage.
The ponderous church to
wer, with its clocks, chimes
and spire, crashed into the
chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out
the front wall. The rose win
dow and the huge Venetian
mosaic of the Sermon on the
Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the
inner quad.

structure of the outer quad

with a frieze depicting the
march of civilization was

years ago, as this photo from the University's archives proves.
as "The Earthquake Class"
were voted their degrees in
May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pur
suing a construction project
that was begun in 1886 and that
has been intermittently con
tinued up to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the
Stanford land, comprised for
the most part of the central
portion running from El
Camino Real to the back boun
dary in the foothills.
The areas designated for
light lie in open land, including
the arboretum, golf course and
the foothill lands used for
space-probing antennae and
research in nuclear physics and
biological sciences.
The inner and outer quads
occupy 17 acres at the heart of
the academic area. The inner
quad's 12 classroom buildings,
two of which are now used by
the presidentand his staff, date
from the time the University
opened in 1891, while the
outer quad was completed in
1903, the same year that
Memorial Church was dedi
cated.

Buildings in the outer quad
are being brought up to
earthquake-proof standards by
an "inside-out" process of
construction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of
no particular denomination. In
the Founding Grant, they di
rected the trustees "to have
taught in the University the
immortality of the soul, the
existence of an all-wise and
benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the
highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and
the University were to be non
sectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
In the original plans, the
central site now occupied by
the church was reserved for it,
though construction was de
ferred. When Senator Stanford
died in 1893, his widow deter
mined that the church would
be built as a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to
approve the mosaic sketches,
and obtaining papal permis
sion to copy the Roselli fresco
of the "Last Supper" in the Sis
tine Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depict

ing the history of redemption.
The larges mosaic, however,
occupies most of the facade of
the church and, with 47 fi
gures, depicts the Sermon on
the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around
a steel framework. Another set
of mosaics was brought from
Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes,
was never rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower
and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace millions of items
that include books, docu
ments, files, manuscripts,
diaries, pamphlets, posters,
maps and photos. The Herbert
Hoover Memorial Building,
completed in 1978, honors the
former president's humanita
rian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World
War I when he headed the
Commission for Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him
in a position to document the
war, Hoover shipped crates of
material to the library at Stan
ford, his alma mater, and laid
the literary foundation of the

Hoover Institution.
At the 1941 ceremony,
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a
challenge to those who prom
ote war. They should attract
those who search for peace."
The Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere out
side Russia. It has more data on
Mussolini than can be found in
Italy. It also probably has the
most complete record on Hi
tler and the Nazi movement ex
tant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research
on problems of social, political
and economic change in the
20th century.
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (Au
ditorium), dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War I, the au
ditorium also contains in the
foyer plaques honoring the
Stanford dead of World War 11.
The main auditorium seats 1700
and the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is
White Memorial Plaza, a
200,000 square foot landscaped
area donated to the University
by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond
White in memory of their sons.
The focal point of the plaza is a

The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm
one of the most productive and
varied programs of ionos
pheric and interplanetary radio
investigation. Its scientists
priade the first radar contact
with the sun.
The most spectacular of the
antennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary
gases by means of a radar
beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along
Sand Hill Road. The $ll4 mill
ion machine, financed by the
Atomic Energy Commission
and completed in 1966, fires
the electron down a straight,
slender tube rather than whirl
ing protons in circles, as most
atom smashers do. The
' machine develops an energy of
20 billion electron volts.
As the 70s end, the Univer
sity draws to a close its so

called "Second Great Stone
Age," a building boom
launched in the early '6os in
which the University has at
tempted to meet its big post
war expansion in students and
faculty.
In the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325
million to pay for new campus
facilities and improvements,
including campus landmarks
such as Maples Pavilion, Meyer
Library, the Green Library an
'nex, the Terman Engineering
Center and the Mudd Chemis
try building.
Now, however, as the Uni
versity stabilizes its popula
tion, it plans fewer major build
ing projects for the coming
years.
Construction projects such
as the nearly-completed Braun
music building and the just
finished new dormitories do
depend largely on the be
neficience of University
donors and in this inflationary
age, the University may have
difficulty raising more funds.
Even if all building were to
stop today, though, the Uni
versity would still look much
different on its 100 th anniver
sary than it did on that day in
1886 when Sen. Stanford de
cided to locate his new univer
sity on the site of his horse
farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding
horses ought to be good
enough for teaching students.

When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the sum
mer of 1891 to be the Universi
ty's first president, he found
the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles
and more from near the head
of San Francisco Bay. Bounding
it on the southwest rises . . .
the Sierra de la Santa Cruz 'a
misty camp of mountains
