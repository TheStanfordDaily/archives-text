# A season of questions

### ADAM BERNS 
Stanford football Coach Paul Wiggin came
under fire following the Cardinal's last-second
loss to Cal in the Big Game. While Stanford
beat such national powerhouses as Ohio State
and Washington, it still ended the season with
more losses than wins.
If Stanford couldn't win with John Elway, it
was asked, how could it win without him?
Following a reshuffling of coaches in the
off-season, Wiggin thinks he has the answer.
"This is an interesting year without the pre
sence of an (John) Elway, (Vincent) White, or
(Darrin) Nelson," Wiggin said before opening
game. "Many conclusions have been drawn by
the press, and I don't know how to change that.
"I think what I've seen, based on the spring
practice, shows more of a team that I've ever
seen before. That's the basis that we're putting
the 1983 team together."
Most pre-season polls don't know what to
make of a Stanford football team without John
Elway. The Cardinal has been placed between
fourth and eighth in the Pac-10 by most football
forecasters, tending towards the latter.
