# A 						season of questions
## 
### ADAM BERNS 
Stanford football Coach Paul Wiggin came
under fire following the Cardinal's last-second
loss to Cal in the Big Game. While Stanford
beat such national powerhouses as Ohio State
and Washington, it still ended the season with
more losses than wins.
If Stanford couldn't win with John Elway, it
was asked, how could it win without him?
Following a reshuffling of coaches in the
off-season, Wiggin thinks he has the answer.
"This is an interesting year without the pre
sence of an (John) Elway, (Vincent) White, or
(Darrin) Nelson," Wiggin said before opening
game. "Many conclusions have been drawn by
the press, and I don't know how to change that.
"I think what I've seen, based on the spring
practice, shows more of a team that I've ever
seen before. That's the basis that we're putting
the 1983 team together."
Most pre-season polls don't know what to
make of a Stanford football team without John
Elway. The Cardinal has been placed between
fourth and eighth in the Pac-10 by most football
forecasters, tending towards the latter.

Stanford's opening game
against Oklahoma didn't ans
wer many of the questions
raised about the team. The of
fense played well in the latter
stages of the game but didn't
have a first down until late in
the second quarter. The new
4-3 defense did a commenda
ble job against Heisman
Trophy candidate Marcus Dup
ree, but defensive breakdowns
allowed the Sooners to control
the ball when the game was on
the line.
The most important part
about the game may have been
that an old question resurfaced
following the contest. Who
was going to be the starting
quarterback?
Wiggin thought that the
quarterback question was
answered in fall practice. Steve
Cottrell was the undisputed
starter, while freshman John
Paye ended redshirt specula
tion by earning the No. 2 spot.
"We believe in Steve Cot
trell," Wiggin said before the
start of the season. "We like
what he stands for. I think con
tinuity was part of the decision
(to make him the starter.)"
The Oklahoma game may
have changed that stable situa
tion. Cottrell, who had been
ineffective in moving the team,
despite reasonably good statis
tics, was replaced in the fourth

quarter by Paye. The freshman
hit five-of-six passes for 88
yards and one touchdown. His
only incompletion was drop
ped. He was also effective in
avoiding Oklahoma's pass
rush.
After the game, Wiggin was
repreatedly questioned about
the quarterback situation, of
fering no definitive answers at
that point.
Sooner Coach Barry Switzer
was a little more forthright. "I
think that Stanford found a
quarterback today," he said
after the game, "He (Paye)
stood in the pocket and
showed a lot of poise.
At press time, Wiggin had
announced Cottrell as the star
ter for the Oklahoma game,
but did not rule out the possi
bility that Paye would play.
In contrast with the quarter
back situation, Stanford's re
ceiving corps is mostly proven
talent. Junior split end Emile
Harry and fifth-year senior
flanker Mike Tolliver lead what
could be one of the best receiv
ing units in the nation. Harry, a
legitimate All-American candi
date, caught 44 passes last sea
son for 763 yards, and is the
Cardinal's main deep throat.
Tolliver, who has caught 66
passes forll7o yardsin his pre
vious years at Stanford, boasts
a 17.7 year average. Other
players that figure to make a
contribution are seniors Eric
Mullins, Steve Brown and Don
Lonsinger.

The tight end position is a
little less settled. Throughout
practice last spring and up to
opening game, its been a
neck-to-neck battle between
senior Jim Clymer and sopho
more Greg Baty. Clymer
started against Oklahoma,
after Baty appeared to have
nailed down the starting job,
and at press time was slated to
start against Illinois.
Two veterans return to Stan
ford's offensive line. Senior
Jeff Deaton (6-foot-3, 270
pounds) returns to the left
tackle spot while senior Matt
Moran (6-4, 260) returns at left
guard. Junior Brent Martin (6-4,
246), who many felt was as
good as last year's starter Mike
Teeuws, will start at center. In
experience may be a problem
on the right side of the line this
year. Senior Steve Aimonetti
(6-1, 230) and sophomore Tom
Prukop (6-2, 253) will start at
tackle and guard respectively.
In the backfield, the Cardinal
will sorely miss the talents of
Vincent White, the nation's
leading receiver last year, and
Mike Dotterer. Fullback Rob
Moore returns for his fifth year
on the Farm and is the only
runner with significant experi
ence. He is backed up by
Kaulana Park who played spar
ingly last year but did see sig
nificant action in the
Washington game. Sopho
more Kevin Scott, a redshirt
*ast year, will start as halfback,

backed up by junior Shaun Av
ant.
Against Oklahoma, Stanford
ended the game with negative
rushing yardage and Wiggin
indicated that he was not
happy with the situation.
Thomas Henly, a hightly re
cruited freshman, saw action inÂ«
the Oklahoma game and could
push for a starting job in the
backfield along with sopho

more Stan Gill. Freshman Mar
shall Dillard, who led the state
in rushing last year, could also
see some playing time this sea
son at fullback or halfback.
The key to Stanford's suc
cess this season, however, will
probably be the defense. Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger
asked Wiggin in the offseason
to devote more personal atten
tion to the defense and the re

suit is a change to the 4-3.
"I'm excited about de
fense," Wiggin said. "We're
going to the 4-3 approach. It's a
disciplined defense, sort of a
distant cousin to the (Dallas
Cowboy's) flex.
"We now have players that
measure up," Wiggin added.
"We have the players to play it
(a 4-3).
The key players in the new
4-3 are junior defensive end
Garin Veris and sophomore
middle linebacker Dave Wy
man.
Veris, who played linebacker
last season, literally grew out of
his position. At 6-6, 260
pounds, Wiggin wanted to
utilize Veris as more of an at
tack player. He had nine sacks
last season in his linebacker
position and Wiggin hopes to
use this pass rushing ability on
every down this year.
If Veris is the physical talent
behind the 4-3, then Wyman is
the brains behind it. Wiggin
has been particularly impre
ssed by the sophomore's abil
ity to read offenses and his
leadership on the field.
The rest of the defensive line
is filled out by senior tackle Pat
Mitchell, junior tackle Dave
Marohnic, and defensive end
John Bergren. Backups likelyto
see action include Mike
Wyman (David's brother), and
last year's starting nose guard
Terry Jackson.
Juniors Tom Briehl and Matt
Soderlund will complete the

linebacking crew for the Car-,
dinal. %
The Stanford secondary re
turns intact from last season.
Senior Vaughn Williams, a
two-time First Team AII-Pac-10
safety, will return to play
strong safety this year after
playing free safety last season.
The coaches feel that this will
put him in more of an attack
position. Last year's starting
strong safety, senior Charles
Hutching, moves to free safety
this year while senior Kevin
Baird and junior Eric Price re
turn as the starting corner
backs.
Senior kicker Mark Harmon
returns this season and figureij
to be one of the nation's best
kickers. Last year he made 14-
of-20 field goals and 36-of-37
extra points. Senior Tripp Har
din will handle the punting
chores again this season. He
averaged 39-6 yards a kick last
year.
The Pac-10 conference this
year again figures to be one of
the toughest and easily the
most evenly balanced in the
nation. With the two best
schools in the conference,
Arizona and USC, on proba
tion and ineligible for the con
ference championship, any
thing could happen. While
Stanford is untested on of
fense, its experienced defensei
should keep most games fairly
close. If the offense returns to
its usual form, Stanford could
surprise a lot of people.
