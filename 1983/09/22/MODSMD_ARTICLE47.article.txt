# Stanford 20 – Cal 19: A Big Game victory that wasn't
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
You've probably heard quite
enough about it, thank you.
You saw the i nstant replays and
slow-motion-reverse-camera
angle versions of it hundreds
of times. Your Berkeley-bound
friends have reminded you
about it a few too many times.
And Sports lllustrated's 12-
page recap of it all didn't help
any.
It's a joke. An embarrass
ment. John Elway said it ruined
his college football career. And
it wasn't the first time the in
comparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band has found itself in trou
ble.
It is, of course, The Play.
Basically, this is what hap
pened. Stanford pulled ahead
in last November's Big Game
with a 35-yard Mark Harmon
field goal. The Stanford rooting
section went wild. Although
four seconds remained on the
game clock, Stanford fans,
players and band members
seemed certain that a Big Game
victory—and the coveted axe
that goes along with it—were
.theirs.

A radio announcer shouted
that Stanford had won the
game and that "only a miracle"
could save the Bears. A miracle
is exactly what the Bears got.
As referees cleared the field
of prematurely-jubilant Stan
ford fans, the Cal kickoff return
team planned the obvious:
"Don't get tackled with the
ball."
But that all-so-obvious foot
bal I advice was to take on a new
importance in the moments to
come.
The Stanford kick-off team
lined up at the 40-yard line,
penalized 15 yards for the Stan
ford fans that poured on to the
field after the field goal.
Meanwhile, things were any
thing but calm on the Cal
bench. Anticipating an onsides
"squib" kick, Cal coaches
shouted for their special kick
off return team made up exc
lusively of good ball-handlers
to take the field. But amid the
noise of the Stanford celebra
tion, a couple of the special
team members never heard
their coaches. Other players
went in for them, resulting in
anywhere from 10 to 14 Cal

players on the field at the time
of the kickoff. And of the
players actually on the field
legally, a few were even in the
wrong places—a situation the
referees should have corrected
before the kickoff but didn't
notice in the pandemonium of
the moment.
Harmon kicked his short
bouncing kickoff where no
Cal player should have been.
But because of the confusion
on the Cal- sidelines, strong
safety Kevin Moen was just
coming on the field and the
ball bounced directly to him.
Moen ran four yards before
he saw Stanford's Barry

Cromer coming toward him.
Moen looked around and spot
ted teammate Richard Rodgers
close to the left sideline. A
quarterback in high school,
Moen was confident he could
hit Rodgers, so he threw a 12-
yard pass to his startled team
mate.
But Rodgers didn't keep the
ball long. A quick block from a
teammate gave Rodgers just
enough time to lateral to
freshman running back Dwight
Garner on the Cal 43-yard line.
But at the Cal 49, Garner was
stopped by a pile of Cardinal
players. Or was he? Kicker
Mark Harmon thought he was

down. Players on both
benches thought he was down.
The Stanford rooting section
knew he was down.
But more importantly, The
Band thought he was down.
Garner and the referees
didn't think so, though.
Garner says that just before
his knees hit the ground he
"shovel-passed" the ball back
to Rodgers.
Rodgers found an opening
and ran to the Stanford 46-yard
line, where he lateraled to
wide receiver Mariet Ford on
the Stanford 47. At the Stanford
27, Ford dove into three
would-be Stanford tacklers, at
the same time tossing the ball
over his shoulder to Moen,
who he knew was somewhere
behind him.
With all but one Stanford
man removed from the action,
the only thing between Moen
and the end zone was the Stan
ford Band.
Stanford Linebacker Mike
Noble chased Moen, but once
he found himself in a sea of
red-jacketed band members
he lost the end zone.
Moen didn't.
He ran through the startled
and celebrating band members
straight into the end zone,
where he collided with trom
bonist Gary Tyrrell.
There were flags on the field,

players on the field, fans on the
field, the axe on the field and
the Band on the field. It
couldn't be a touchdown.
But it was.
Stanford appealed the loss to
just about everybody who
would listen. The NCAA said
no dice, but that's not what a
fake version of The Daily
Californian said.
Staffers of The Stanford Daily
produced a fake version of the
Berkeley paper proclaiming a
Stanford victory shortly after
the game. It tricked thousand.!!
of Cal students and has be
come a bit of a collectors item.
But the fake Daily Cal hasn't
been the only spin-off from Big
Game 1983. A Cal fraternity
sells T-shirts with a diagram of
the play on the front. A Stan
ford group sells T-shirts with
the inscription, "We Wuz
Robbed."
KGO radio in San Francisco
sells a tape of their radio an
nouncer screaming during the
play. And UC-Berkeley sells a
$lOO video tape of the play to
watch in your very own home.
In its recap of the play earlier
this month, Sports Illustrated
said that there has "never been
anything in the history of col
lege football to equal it for
sheer madness."
They haven't seen Big Game
1983 yet.

Stanford Axe Committee members celeb
rate prematurely after Mark Harmon's
field goal put Stanford ahead 20-19 in Big
Game 1982. But after a 57-yard California
kickoff return through the Stanford
band members game officials confer to
decide the game's outcome. Finally, the
referees signaled the touchdown good, the
Cal cannon fired, and Cal fans had the true
celebration.
