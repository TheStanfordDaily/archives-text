# The
						continuing saga of John Elway
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Stanford freshmen are coming to the
Farm just after one of the Cardinal's most
celebrated football figures left.
John Elway came to Stanford in the fall
of 1979. Before he left in June, Elway estab
lished a National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation record for pass completions,
finished runnerup in the 1982 Heisman
Trophy balloting and earned Co-Player of
the Year honors from the Pac-10 confer
ence.
The 6-foot-4 blonde took his passing
prowess to Denver, where he is now the
Broncos' quarterback. But the road to De
nver was blocked by obstacles.
Elway was drafted as the National Foot
ball League's (NFL) first player by the Bal
timore Colts. Elway, however, had expres
sed to the Colts that he did not wish to play
in Baltimore, and had asked the Colts not

to choose him in the draft.
Elway, who played a major role in the
Cardinal baseball team's 43-22 record in
the spring of 1981, told the Colts he would
play baseball for the New York Yankees,
who had also drafted Elway, if the Colts
picked him in the draft.
The Colts called Elway's bluff, choosing
him first in the NFL draft. It looked as if
Elway would play baseball. But, in a sud
den turn in events, the Colts traded the
right to sign Elway to Denver. Elway, who
said he wanted to play on the West Coast,
agreed to a lucrative $5 million contract
with the Broncos.
The media and Denver fell in love with
their new quarterback.
The Denver Post , evidently caught up
in Elwaymania, published 14 photos, eight
stories and five charts and graphs after the
10-7 preseason win over Seattle. Sports II

lustrated called Elway's debut "dazzling"
after Elway completed 10 of 15 passes. The
Post and the Rocky Mountain News in
itiated "Elway watch" columns which con
tain even trivial information on the North
ridge, California product. In the first pre
season game, when Steve Deßerg played
thefirst half, Denverfanschanted, "Elway,
Elway!" The fans finally broke loose with
cheers when Elway took the field in the
second half.
Elway played well in two preseason wins
over Seattle and Atlanta. Then Denver
Coach Dan Reeves announced Elway
would be the starting quarter back in front
of Deßerg.
Elway's first game as a starter was unsuc
cessful. The Minnesota Vikings made life
rough on the unproven Denver offensive
line and, consequently, on a still inexperi

After breaking most
of the records in the
Stanford book, Stan
ford quarterback
sensation John Elway
announced at a news
conference that he
would leave football
to play pro baseball
unless the Baltimore
Colts traded him to a
warmer-climate NFL
team. The Colts
traded Elway to the
Denver Broncos
the rest just might be
Bronco history.
