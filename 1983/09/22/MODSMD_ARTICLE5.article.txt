# The hazards of aiming for 'perfect'

The key words these days
are "peak form" and "top con
dition" as we move away from
"normal" and toward
"fantastic But being fantastic
is taking its toll.
We seem to have high
and even higher expecta
tions of ourselves in terms ol
who we are. how we look, and
how we feel about ourselves.
Striving for the ideal body,
students are turning to coping
strategies which are less than
ideal. Eating and controlling
one's weight often becomes
problematic, running head
long into one's vision of the
ideal self.
While if seems that many
students, not unlike many
people in the general popula
tion, are concerned with
eating and its consequences,
little is known about the
degree of eating problems on
campus. As with any survey
question of a sensitive, per
sonal and perhaps em
harassing nature, the ten
dency may be to under-report
the level of problems associ
ated with eating in students'

lives. While four to fifteen per
cent of the students respond
ing to the survey reported
eating problems in various
areas, the results are striking.
The health survey showed
that whatever eating problems
exist, they are primarily an
issue for women on this
campus. Although only one
third of the students respond
ing to the survey were women,
that group reported almost all
the eating problems.
Students were asked about
several methods for weight
control. Five percent of the
women use amphetamines,
five percent use fasting, and
2.4 percent use laxatives
several times a month or more
to control their weight. By
contrast, only one percent of
thi! men use fasting for weight
control during this same time
period, and none use the other
methods. 1!) percent of the wo
men. and 5.5 percent of the
men, fast several times a year
for weight control. It should be
noted that, as a group, both
men and women at Stanford
are within their recommended
weight ranges.
Much has been written in
the .media about binging and
purging of one's food, yet not
much was known about this
practice. Questions were
asked about hinging "eating
uncontrollably or excessively
for a two to three hour per
iod." Just over nine percent of
the women reported hinging
several times a month or more
often, as compared to two per
cent of the men. Fourteen per
cent of the women and eight
percent of the men binge a few
times a year.
Questions about purging, or
self-induced vomiting, were
also included on the survey.
Three percent of the women
reported self-induced vomit
ing after binging several times
a month or more often; four
percent of the women reported
hinging and purging several
times a year. By contrast, less
than one third of one percent
of the men reported hinging
and purging monthly.
Two and a half percent of
the women reported self
induced vomiting after regular
eating several times a month.
The same percentage reported

the practice several times a
year. Again, less than one
third of one percent of the men
reported self-induced vomit
ing after regular eating.
The Fall, 19H.'t issue of In
sight. a publication of Stan
ford's Department of Psychia
try and behavioral Sciences,
describes the bulemic individ
ual as "almost always a young
woman" who is "trapped in a
destructive cycle of binge
eating and vomiting. Usually
of normal weight, she has an
intense fear of bee oming fat
and ordinarily adheres to a
rigid, restricted diet. Yet she
also has powerful, intractable
urges to overeat, and
periodicaly binges on
"forbidden" foods like ice
cream or brownies.
"Several thousand calories
later, she feels guilty, despon
dent, and physically ill. To
relieve her physical and emo
tional distress, she finds some
way of undoing the binge.
Most bulemics induce vomit
ing after a binge; many also
take laxatives or diuretics. The
relief of vomiting strongly
reinforces the pattern, and the
binge/vomit cycle may become
a daily event."
It seems that the constant
bombardment about the hor
rors of overweight, or the goal
of simply being perfect, has
had a more profound effect on
women than on men. Perhaps
men express the pressures in
different ways. Thinness, for
women, is the ultimate goal
while they are barraged by
delectable food ads on televi
sion or get whiffs of chocolate
chip cookies as they walk
downtown.
While it may be tempting to
dismiss the impact of these
pressures and contradictions
as affecting only "those"
troubled women, it is apparent
that it's a process that may be
taking a toll on all of us. While
in many areas of our lives it
may be valuable to strive for
excellence, it is equally impor
tant to define the boundaries
of those areas more distinctly.
This way we can understand
how our goals and ambitions
enrich us and find ways to
keep them from enslaving us
in a state of continuous dissat
isfaction with who we are.
