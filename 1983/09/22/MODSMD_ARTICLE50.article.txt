## Eighth place and holding 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Few basketball teams that
finished in eighth place in their
league have hopes as high as
Stanford does for its 1983-84
season.
The Cardinal, at third from
the bottom in the Pac-10 con
ference, finished last season
with its best record in 10 years.
Much of the credit goes to
second-year Stanford coach
Tom Davis.
Davis, who made programs
at Lafayette and Boston Col
lege successful before coming
to the Farm, gave Stanford bas
ketball respectability both in
the Pac-10 and in the eyes of its
followers.
Before Davis' arrival, the
Cardinal suffered through a
7-20 1981-82 season and a last
place Pac-10 finish under Dick
Dißiaso. Davis brought vic
tories as well as fans to Maples
Pavilion last season.
In 1982-83 the Cardinal raced
out to a 7-1 start before being
decimated by injuries and, as
usual, a tough Pac-10 schedule.
Stanford finished the year 14-
14—its first non-losing season
since 1972-73—and 6-12 in the
Pac-10, annually one of the
best top-to-bottom confer
ences in the country.
The reason for optimism in
the Davis camp?

All-Americans—seniors John
Revelli and Keith Jones —
return to lead Stanford. Revelli
and Jones are two members of
a group of walk-on players cal
led the Grey Squad are ex
pected to contribute to the
Cardinal cause.
Despite one of the brightest
outlooks in years, Davis is
cautious.
"Our lack of front-court
strength and overall speed
and quickness are still prob
lems for us," Davis said.
"Whether we're improved
enough to move up from our
eighth place finish remains to
be seen however. I feel the rest
of the league has improved
right along with us, and league
strength may keep us from
moving very far up the ladder."
Davis will count on Revelli, a
6-foot-8 center, to bolster the
Cardinal middle. Revelli,
named Pac-10 Rookie of the
Year in 1981 and first team All
Pac-10 in 1982, was en route to
another honor-laden season in
1982-83 when he suffered a
season ending knee injury
against Arizona State. Still, Re
velli finished with a team-high
7.8 rebounds per game and set
a Stanford record for season
field goal percentage, shooting
67 percent.
Jones constituted the Cardi
nal outside scoring threat. The

6-1 guard led the team in scor
ing with 19.8 points per game
and finished second in the con
ference with 20.6 per Pac-10
match. Jones, who set the Car
dinal single-season scoring re
cord with 553 points and at
tempted and made more free
irows than any other Cardi
nal , was part of a Pac-10 All-Star
squad which toured the Soviet
Union in August.

Hans Wichary and Steve Brown
will provide experienced sup

Wichary played admirably as
the Cardinal's only power
player last season. Brown, a 6-1
swingman, averaged over 10
points in Pac-10 play.
Sophomore Keith Ramee
started all but three games last
year at point guard. Ramee set
the single season mark in as
sists (133) and the single game
standard with 12. Fellow
second-year players Earl
Koberlein and Andy Fischer,
the latter of whom made the
team as a walk-on from the
Gray Squad, add depth to the
front line.
In addition to Ramee, senior
Ricky Lewis should see time at
point guard. Lewis, who has
suffered six shoulder separa
tions, started three games last
year before succumbing to yet

Freshman Grady Johnson,
Doug Wall and Novian Whittsit
are the prizes of Davis' first re
cruiting at the Cardinal boss.
The 6-8 Johnson averaged 15
points, 10 rebounds and eight
blocked shots in his lastyearof
high school at Atlanta. Wall
scored 20.2 points and added
11.2 rebounds per game at
Nevada Union High School.
Whittsit of San Pedro, Califor

3.5 assists per game. '*

Davis, who made programs
at Lafayette and Boston Col
lege successful before coming
to the Farm, gave Stanford bas
ketball respectability both in
the Pac-10 and in the eyes of its
followers.
Before Davis' arrival, the
Cardinal suffered through a
7-20 1981-82 season and a last
place Pac-10 finish under Dick
Dißiaso. Davis brought vic
tories as well as fans to Maples
Pavilion last season.
In 1982-83 the Cardinal raced
out to a 7-1 start before being
decimated by injuries and, as
usual, a tough Pac-10 schedule.
Stanford finished the year 14-
14—its first non-losing season
since 1972-73—and 6-12 in the
Pac-10, annually one of the
best top-to-bottom confer
ences in the country.
The reason for optimism in
the Davis camp?
Two honorable mention

All-Americans—seniors John
Revelli and Keith Jones —
return to lead Stanford. Revelli
and Jones are two members of
a group of walk-on players cal
led the Grey Squad are ex
pected to contribute to the
Cardinal cause.
Despite one of the brightest
outlooks in years, Davis is
cautious.
"Our lack of front-court
strength and overall speed
and quickness are still prob
lems for us," Davis said.
"Whether we're improved
enough to move up from our
eighth place finish remains to
be seen however. I feel the rest
of the league has improved
right along with us, and league
strength may keep us from
moving very far up the ladder."
Davis will count on Revelli, a
6-foot-8 center, to bolster the
Cardinal middle. Revelli,
named Pac-10 Rookie of the
Year in 1981 and first team All
Pac-10 in 1982, was en route to
another honor-laden season in
1982-83 when he suffered a
season ending knee injury
against Arizona State. Still, Re
velli finished with a team-high
7.8 rebounds per game and set
a Stanford record for season
field goal percentage, shooting
67 percent.
Jones constituted the Cardi
nal outside scoring threat. The

6-1 guard led the team in scor
ing with 19.8 points per game
and finished second in the con
ference with 20.6 per Pac-10
match. Jones, who set the Car
dinal single-season scoring re
cord with 553 points and at
tempted and made more free
irows than any other Cardi
nal , was part of a Pac-10 All-Star
squad which toured the Soviet
Union in August.
Junior San Diego products
Hans Wichary and Steve Brown
will provide experienced sup
port for Jones and Revelli.
Wichary played admirably as
the Cardinal's only power
player last season. Brown, a 6-1
swingman, averaged over 10
points in Pac-10 play.
Sophomore Keith Ramee
started all but three games last
year at point guard. Ramee set
the single season mark in as
sists (133) and the single game
standard with 12. Fellow
second-year players Earl
Koberlein and Andy Fischer,
the latter of whom made the
team as a walk-on from the
Gray Squad, add depth to the
front line.
In addition to Ramee, senior
Ricky Lewis should see time at
point guard. Lewis, who has
suffered six shoulder separa
tions, started three games last
year before succumbing to yet

Freshman Grady Johnson,
Doug Wall and Novian Whittsit
are the prizes of Davis' first re
cruiting at the Cardinal boss.
The 6-8 Johnson averaged 15
points, 10 rebounds and eight
blocked shots in his lastyearof
high school at Atlanta. Wall
scored 20.2 points and added
11.2 rebounds per game at

Whittsit of San Pedro, Califor

season Nov. 3 against the

"I still feel it's apparent that
we're in eighth-place team in
the Pac-10. We're a team that
will have to work hard every
time out."
