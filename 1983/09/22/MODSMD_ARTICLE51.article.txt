# 1983 Scouting Reports

### JASON COLE 
Men's swimming
Despite a fourth place finish in last
year's NCAA finals, Stanford men's
swimming Coach Skip Kenney is disap
pointed.
"We had one bad day during all of last
year, and it happened to be on the first
day of the NCAAs," Kenney explains.
Indeed, the Cardinal swimmers were
undefeated during the dual meet season,
top-ranked and a favorite to win the
championship. So what happened?
"We walked in there looking for the
trophy rather than going out and getting
m." says Kenney. Stanford was so confi
dent that they would take the title they
assumed that it would be easy. It wasn't.
But last year's lesson was well learned,
Kenney says. "We've got to be better," he
says simply. The team returns 17 of 18
swimmers from last year's squad.
Among the returners are 1983 Pan-Am
team members Dave Bottom and John
Moffitt.
But just as significant as returners, will
be the addition of several prominent re
cruits. Most notable among them are Jeff
Kostoff and Pablo Morales, both Pan-Am
team members and both freshmen.
These additions will give Stanford the
needed depth that almost assures them
an NCAA title. "We've got all the big
point getters. What we need are the con
solation points. (The University of)
j| : lorida won the championship without
winning any event, because they got all
the consolation points," Kenney points
out.
With the Olympics just around the
corner, Kenney is especially excited
about the upcoming year. Stanford will
have at least four Olympians and possibly
eight. If Stanford places enough swim
mers on the Olympic team, Kenney could
join Stanford women's swimming coach
George Haines in coaching the U.S.
team.
"It would be very exciting to join
George on the team and be part of the
games. I hope I get the chance," he says.
Women's swimming
Stanford women's swimming Coach
George Haines doesn't seem to be sweat
the upcoming year. Why should he?
tven after winning the NCAA champion
ship last year he thinks he has a better
team coming back.
"We lost four big performers, but I
think we more than made up for those
losses with the women we recruited,"
Haines says.
The four who graduated are Kim Car
lisle, Patty Spees, Kelly Asplund and Barb
Major.
But six freshman recruits will look to fill

in the empty shoes. They are Susan Rapp
(sister of team member junior Jenny
Rapp), Beth Washut, Laura Blankley,
Mary McDevitt, Mary Ellen Vetters and
Kirsten Lund.
Rapp is the top prospect of the group,
according to Haines. A member of the
1983 Pan-Am team, she is an all-around
performer who "will probably make up
most of the points we lost to graduation,"
Haines said.
Washut should also be an important
contributor to the team, he said.
But the strength of the team lies in the
returners. Anchored by Pan-Am per
former and Olympic hopeful Marybeth
Linzmeier, the team returns 12 of 16 vete
rans. Others returners include Libby Kin
kead, Patty Gavin, Diana Zock, co-captain
Krissie Bush and Lisa Buese.
Haines' major worry (if you can call it
that) is not with his own team, but with
the atmosphere created by the upcoming
Olympics. "I would definitely put us in
the top three with USC and Florida. Both
of those schools have good programs,
but the excitement created by the Olym
pics may help put one of them on top. I
know we'll be there (the NCAA champ
ionships), and we'll be looking forward to
the Olympics too."

Baseball
After two straight appearances at the
College World Series, Stanford baseball
might be due for a bit of a comedown.
Not that this team will lack talent, but as
Coach Mark Marquess puts it, "We
graduated the heart of our lineup, our
offensive punch."
Gone are Eric Hardgrave (who almost
doubled the Stanford single season home
run record with 24)., Mike Aldrete (13
homers), Vince Sakowski (six homers)
and Mike Dotterer (two homers). That's
45 out of the 80 total home runs that Stan
ford hit last season.
But all is not lost. The Cardinal returns
both of its catchers, the shortstop and
second baseman, the centerfielder, al
mosttheentire pitching staff and a host of
utility players. Add to that several re
cruits, and you have a team that Marquess
says may end up as high as second or
third in the Pac-6.
"ASU has to be the favorite this year,
but there's not that big a difference bet
ween them and the rest of the division.
Everyone is strong, USC, UCLA, Arizona
and us. If some of our players have good
years, we could win the division," says
Marquess.

In the field, the team should be strong;
the whole middle of the field is returning.
But it all comes back to hitting. If the
Cardinal can muster any support for the
pitching staff, they will be very competi
tive. If not, another World Series appear
ance may be a year or two off.
Women's basketball
A quick look at Stanford's 1983-
84 women's basketball team will tell
you right away that some big changes are
in store as a "rebuilding" process goes
into work.
To start with, Stanford lost five players to
graduation, including four of its top five
scorers, four of its five starters and its first
front-line substitute. Two of the five
now-alumni were fifth-year players, so all
told, 22 years of Stanford basketball ex
perience joined the real world.
The process of rebuilding is underway.
"I'm optimistic about how this team is
going to come together," said Coach
Dotty McCrea. "We had a'very good re
cruiting year and we have a strong nuc
leus of returning players."
Among the nucleus is one proven ta

lent, 5-foot-2 sophomore point guard
Virginia Sourlis. Sourlis averaged 11
points and nearly four assists per game in
her freshman season and for her efforts
was named to the American Women
Sports Federation Freshman All-America
team. Joining her as veterans will be 6-2
sophomore center Sarah Evans, 6-0 junior
forward Mary Bradach and 5-II senior
forward Judy Carter. Five guards also re
turn, including 5-7 senior Lee Ann
Margerum, 5-10 sophomore Judy Griffith
and 5-7 Junior Noel Hanrahan. Rejoining
the Cardinal after sitting out two years
will be 5-5 senior guard Denise McGuire.
"The great thing is that we're going to
have incredibly competitive practices this
fall," says McCrea. "Virtually all of our
starting spots, with the exception of one
guard, are wide open. We've got a couple
of freshman who are going to make seri
ous challenges. Everyone will have to play
hard."
Those "couple of freshmen" are 6-1
forward Kim Mercer and 5-6 guard Erica
Mueser. Also challenging for a starting
spot will be 6-1 forward Karen
Goedewaagen and 5-10 forward Sue
Sebolt.
"It's great to have fresh blood in the
system," McCrea says. "All of the kids
have great attitudes and they all want to
play. That alone will help us get a lot done
in practice."
Getting things done in practice will be
important, as Stanford faces its second
season in the nation's toughest women's
basketball conference, the WCAA. The
conference produced four NCAA tour
nament teams last season, including na
tional champion USC.
Men's golf
Stanford men's golf Coach Tim Schaaf
makes a very simple evaluation of this
year's team:
"We should be even stronger and
deeper than we were last year."
That kind of talk could scare a lot of
opponents this coming year.
After a close third-place finish in the
Pac-10 (behind UCLA and USC) last year,
the Cardinal returns five of six lettermen
and three former lettermen who re
shirted, and adds three fine recruits.
The goals, however, are very modest.
Schaaf admits that although he believes
he has one of the best teams in the west
ern region, "Everybody is very close. The
difference between the first team and
sixth team could be very little. We would
just like to make the top 10.1 think we can
do that."
The five returning lettermen are Lanny
Sawchuck, Josh Mendry, Scott Erickson,
Carl Wagner and Don Walsworth. But
their spots are far from assured with the
