# 1983 Scouting Reports
## 
### JASON COLE 
Men's swimming
Despite a fourth place finish in last
year's NCAA finals, Stanford men's
swimming Coach Skip Kenney is disap
pointed.
"We had one bad day during all of last
year, and it happened to be on the first
day of the NCAAs," Kenney explains.
Indeed, the Cardinal swimmers were
undefeated during the dual meet season,
top-ranked and a favorite to win the
championship. So what happened?
"We walked in there looking for the
trophy rather than going out and getting
m." says Kenney. Stanford was so confi
dent that they would take the title they
assumed that it would be easy. It wasn't.
But last year's lesson was well learned,
Kenney says. "We've got to be better," he
says simply. The team returns 17 of 18
swimmers from last year's squad.
Among the returners are 1983 Pan-Am
team members Dave Bottom and John
Moffitt.
But just as significant as returners, will
be the addition of several prominent re
cruits. Most notable among them are Jeff
Kostoff and Pablo Morales, both Pan-Am
team members and both freshmen.
These additions will give Stanford the
needed depth that almost assures them
an NCAA title. "We've got all the big
point getters. What we need are the con
solation points. (The University of)
j| : lorida won the championship without
winning any event, because they got all
the consolation points," Kenney points
out.
With the Olympics just around the
corner, Kenney is especially excited
about the upcoming year. Stanford will
have at least four Olympians and possibly
eight. If Stanford places enough swim
mers on the Olympic team, Kenney could
join Stanford women's swimming coach
George Haines in coaching the U.S.
team.
"It would be very exciting to join
George on the team and be part of the
games. I hope I get the chance," he says.
Women's swimming
Stanford women's swimming Coach
George Haines doesn't seem to be sweat
the upcoming year. Why should he?
tven after winning the NCAA champion
ship last year he thinks he has a better
team coming back.
"We lost four big performers, but I
think we more than made up for those
losses with the women we recruited,"
Haines says.
The four who graduated are Kim Car
lisle, Patty Spees, Kelly Asplund and Barb
Major.
But six freshman recruits will look to fill

in the empty shoes. They are Susan Rapp
(sister of team member junior Jenny
Rapp), Beth Washut, Laura Blankley,
Mary McDevitt, Mary Ellen Vetters and
Kirsten Lund.
Rapp is the top prospect of the group,
according to Haines. A member of the
1983 Pan-Am team, she is an all-around
performer who "will probably make up
most of the points we lost to graduation,"
Haines said.
Washut should also be an important
contributor to the team, he said.
But the strength of the team lies in the
returners. Anchored by Pan-Am per
former and Olympic hopeful Marybeth
Linzmeier, the team returns 12 of 16 vete
rans. Others returners include Libby Kin
kead, Patty Gavin, Diana Zock, co-captain
Krissie Bush and Lisa Buese.
Haines' major worry (if you can call it
that) is not with his own team, but with
the atmosphere created by the upcoming
Olympics. "I would definitely put us in
the top three with USC and Florida. Both
of those schools have good programs,
but the excitement created by the Olym
pics may help put one of them on top. I
know we'll be there (the NCAA champ
ionships), and we'll be looking forward to
the Olympics too."

Baseball
After two straight appearances at the
College World Series, Stanford baseball
might be due for a bit of a comedown.
Not that this team will lack talent, but as
Coach Mark Marquess puts it, "We
graduated the heart of our lineup, our
offensive punch."
Gone are Eric Hardgrave (who almost
doubled the Stanford single season home
run record with 24)., Mike Aldrete (13
homers), Vince Sakowski (six homers)
and Mike Dotterer (two homers). That's
45 out of the 80 total home runs that Stan
ford hit last season.
But all is not lost. The Cardinal returns
both of its catchers, the shortstop and
second baseman, the centerfielder, al
mosttheentire pitching staff and a host of
utility players. Add to that several re
cruits, and you have a team that Marquess
says may end up as high as second or
third in the Pac-6.
"ASU has to be the favorite this year,
but there's not that big a difference bet
ween them and the rest of the division.
Everyone is strong, USC, UCLA, Arizona
and us. If some of our players have good
years, we could win the division," says
Marquess.

In the field, the team should be strong;
the whole middle of the field is returning.
But it all comes back to hitting. If the
Cardinal can muster any support for the
pitching staff, they will be very competi
tive. If not, another World Series appear
ance may be a year or two off.
Women's basketball
A quick look at Stanford's 1983-
84 women's basketball team will tell
you right away that some big changes are
in store as a "rebuilding" process goes
into work.
To start with, Stanford lost five players to
graduation, including four of its top five
scorers, four of its five starters and its first
front-line substitute. Two of the five
now-alumni were fifth-year players, so all
told, 22 years of Stanford basketball ex
perience joined the real world.
The process of rebuilding is underway.
"I'm optimistic about how this team is
going to come together," said Coach
Dotty McCrea. "We had a'very good re
cruiting year and we have a strong nuc
leus of returning players."
Among the nucleus is one proven ta

lent, 5-foot-2 sophomore point guard
Virginia Sourlis. Sourlis averaged 11
points and nearly four assists per game in
her freshman season and for her efforts
was named to the American Women
Sports Federation Freshman All-America
team. Joining her as veterans will be 6-2
sophomore center Sarah Evans, 6-0 junior
forward Mary Bradach and 5-II senior
forward Judy Carter. Five guards also re
turn, including 5-7 senior Lee Ann
Margerum, 5-10 sophomore Judy Griffith
and 5-7 Junior Noel Hanrahan. Rejoining
the Cardinal after sitting out two years
will be 5-5 senior guard Denise McGuire.
"The great thing is that we're going to
have incredibly competitive practices this
fall," says McCrea. "Virtually all of our
starting spots, with the exception of one
guard, are wide open. We've got a couple
of freshman who are going to make seri
ous challenges. Everyone will have to play
hard."
Those "couple of freshmen" are 6-1
forward Kim Mercer and 5-6 guard Erica
Mueser. Also challenging for a starting
spot will be 6-1 forward Karen
Goedewaagen and 5-10 forward Sue
Sebolt.
"It's great to have fresh blood in the
system," McCrea says. "All of the kids
have great attitudes and they all want to
play. That alone will help us get a lot done
in practice."
Getting things done in practice will be
important, as Stanford faces its second
season in the nation's toughest women's
basketball conference, the WCAA. The
conference produced four NCAA tour
nament teams last season, including na
tional champion USC.
Men's golf
Stanford men's golf Coach Tim Schaaf
makes a very simple evaluation of this
year's team:
"We should be even stronger and
deeper than we were last year."
That kind of talk could scare a lot of
opponents this coming year.
After a close third-place finish in the
Pac-10 (behind UCLA and USC) last year,
the Cardinal returns five of six lettermen
and three former lettermen who re
shirted, and adds three fine recruits.
The goals, however, are very modest.
Schaaf admits that although he believes
he has one of the best teams in the west
ern region, "Everybody is very close. The
difference between the first team and
sixth team could be very little. We would
just like to make the top 10.1 think we can
do that."
The five returning lettermen are Lanny
Sawchuck, Josh Mendry, Scott Erickson,
Carl Wagner and Don Walsworth. But
their spots are far from assured with the


Greg Webb/Daily
return of redshirts Doug Thompson, Tim
Robinson and John Scanlon, and the ad
dition of freshman (and last year's U.S.
Junior champion) Rich Marik.
"We're going to have a lot of competi
tion for the top six spots," Schaaf said. "I
think it will be good for the players and
especially good for the team since we'll
have-good individuals ready to play any
time."

Women's tennis
It's not easy to follow up perfection. In
1983, the Stanford women's tennis team
did a more than admirable job. After
going undefeated and winning the NCAA
championship in 1982, the Cardinal fell to
fourth place in 1983.
Overall, the team was 20-6 and 9-3 in
the WCAA. Their fourth-place finish
came after defeating both Princeton and
San Diego State and then losing to USCin
the semi-finals and UCLA in the consola
tion round. USC was the eventual win
ner.
But Head Coach Frank Brennan is not
satisfied with that finish, especially con
sidering the loss of No. 1 doubles player
Caryn Copeland. Thus, Brennan pro
ceeded to have one of the finest recruit
ing years imaginable.
Brennan received letters of intent from
three of the top four ranked high school
players in the country. The three are

Leigh Anne Eidredge (No. 1), Patty Fen
dick (No. 2) and Stephanie Savides (No.
4).
The onset of these three top-rated
women will help complement the return
of players Elise Burgin, Michelle Weiss
and Susy Jaeger. Their collective efforts
should help keep Stanford in the top five
again this year, with an outside shot at the
championship.
Men's tennis
Since the mid-19705, Stanford and ten
nis have become almost synonymous.
With such stars as John McEnroe, Roscoe
Tanner and Sandy and Gene Mayer, the
Cardinal has not only rolled up individual
honors but several national champion
ships as well.
Last year was another in a long string of
successes. After losing its second match
(against Pepperdi le), Stanford reeled off
23 straight victories, the Pac-10 champ
ionship and the NCAA championship.
Stanford defeated a favored Southern
Methodist University team in the finals to
win the crown.
As usual, the expectations are high for
the Cardinal men's team. The tennis team
returns five out of the six players from last
year's squad, including captain Mark Mc-
Keen. Also returning is seventh man
Ceordie McKee, who filled in when
number one player Scott Davis was ill last
season.
Coach Dick Gould added several top
recruits, including Derrick Rostagno of
Palos Verdes, California. Rostagno is a
tournament level player who, according
to Gould, should step right into the top
six.
However, the one loss that Stanford
suffered was a big one. After winning the
NCAA championship, Scott Davis an
nounced that he would forego his senior
year and turn professional. That left the
number one spot vacated.
Despite the loss, Gould says he be
lieves that the Cardinal will be among the
top five schools in the country, with USC
topping the list. USC returns five of their
six starters (including the nation's 1
number one singles player) and adds a
top-notch doubles player to fill in their
one weakness. "If anyone is going to beat
(USC), they're going to have to win a
doubles match," says Gould.

Women's volleyball
Stanford women's volleyball made a
rather auspicious entrance into one of
the toughest volleyball conferences in
the nation last year when it tied for sec
ond place overall in its first season as a
member of the Western Collegiate Athle
tic Association.
In 1983; Head Coach Fred Sturm looks
forward to more of the same results, and
a season goal of attaining an NCAA Final
Four Tournament berth.
To help accomplish that goal, the
team returns a powerful nucleus of star
ters and some fine new recruits to this
year's edition of Cardinal volleyball.
Sturm is cautiously optimistic in his
outlook for the upcoming season. "This
year's team will be better than last year's,
but it would be premature to be overly
optimistic at this point in time. There are
so many factors affecting the eventual
success of the team. For instance, the
proposed change in the format of the
NCAA Final Four Tournament, illnesses
and injuries to key players, and the per
formance of other top teams (most of
whom will also return a majority of star
ters), will all have a significant impact
upon our season."
The Stanfordcause will be bolstered by
the return of Kim Oden, one of the most
highly touted volleyball players to come
upon the college scene in recent years. A
6-foot-2 middle blocker who led the team
in almost an unbelievable triple combina
tion of kills, hitting percentage and
blocks.
But Oden does not stand alone on this
year's team. She will be joined by quite a
few other talented players.
Led by senior captain Kari Rush, the
Stanford squad is formidable.
Sturm also managed to cop a few prize
recruits last year, although the freshmen
will have their work cut out for them. In
addition to learning a complex Stanford
system, all three new Cardinals are also
expected to adjust to playing different
positions than they played in high school.
Sturm said of his team: "If this group
continues to improve its standard of per
formance at the rate it has over the past
three years, and barring the misfortune of
illness and injury, I am certain that every
thing will fall into place record-wise."

Men's soccer
Men's soccer Coach Nelson Lodge has
a very straight forward opinion of this
year's team. "In my eight seasons that I've
been here, I think we will have the best
team Stanford has ever fielded. We are
extremely competitive amongst our
strikers. We are exceptionally strong in
the midfield, and we are more than
adequate on defense. Our goalie play will
be better than ever."
Stanford returns its top four scorers—
including All-American candidate Jorge
Titinger.
Titinger, a senior striker, is one of the
finest soccer players to ever wear a Car
dinal uniform. An All-Far West and All-
Pacific Soccer Conference selection in
1982, he scored 13 goals and passed for 12
assists for a total of 38 points.
"There is no question that Jorge is one
of the finest collegiate soccer players in
the country," said Lodge. "There is no
question his strengths are his aggressive
ness, power and the ability to intimidate
an opponent around the goal box. He will
again be a dominant force for us this
'year."
Stanford has another All-American
candidate in sophomore Angel Vazques
who scored 20 points last season. Round
ing out the Cardinal top scorers are
sophomore Todd Rafalovich and junior
Giancarlo Ferruzzi, who each scored 25
points last season.
Another All-American candidate is
senior midfielder Walter Kingson. Ac
cording to Lodge, no one knows the
game better than Kingson.
The Cardinal will have one of its tough
est schedules in recent years with 15
home appearances, including contests
against the University of Washington, the
University of Nevada-Las Vegas, San Jose
State, Cal State Fullerton, San Diego State
and Fresno State. The away slate leads to
such places as Santa Clara, Portland and
the University of San Francisco.
"The strength of our schedule is impor
tant as far as making the NCAA playoffs"
said Lodge. "Washington has an excel
lent program and was nationally ranked
last season. Teams such as USF, Santa
Clara and San Jose State are always strong
while Fullerton and UN-LV have excellent
programs."

Field hockey
A traditionally eastern sport, field hoc
key has taken a bit longer to catch on in
the western part of the United States. But
today the West Coast can boast some of
the finest teams in the country, including
Stanford University.
Two years ago, Stanford posted a sea
son record of 6-5-1. Last year, despite

playing without Ail-American Patsy Hun
tington, the team was 10-4-1. Head Coach
Onnie Killefer looks forward to the up
coming season and Stanford's emergence
as a nationally-ranked team. Her goal this
season is to gain a berth in the NCAA
tourney in November.
One major reason behind the op
timism surrounding this upcoming sea
son is the return of Huntington, a former
U.S. Junior National Team member. Hun
ti ngton sat out the enti re 1982 season with
a knee injury but returns to the 1983
squad fully recovered and eager to re
sume playing.
She is recognized as one of the
stronger forwards in collegiate play. Hun
tington's trademark is a stubbornly de
termined attitude which helps to make
her an aggressive attack player.
"Patsy is someone you have to contend
with no matter where she is on the field,"
said Killefer, who was herself an Ail-
American in field hockey at Stanford.


Huntington will be joined by a core of
returning players who should bolster
Stanford's performance on the field and
contribute to the Cardinal's goal of attain
ing an NCAA playoff berth. On the for
ward line, junior Jen Bleakely and
sophomore Karen Chamberlain will be
counted on heavily to add their talents to
the Stanford cause.
Bleakley, a forward, is termed a "subtle
playmaker" by Killefer. She should re
ceive substantial assistance from Cham
berlain and from captain Valerie Jackson.
With these three starters, Stanford's for
ward line should display a potent scoring
threat at all positions.
Stanford will also be strong in the nets
again this year with the return of junior
Bonnie Warner. Warner has already qual
ified for the 1984 Olymic team in the luge.
She is a quick, strong goalie who breeds
confidence in the Stanford backfield.
The entering freshman should be able
to make significant contributions on this
year's team. Mary Chung, Janet Lohman

2nd Andrea Wolpert should see ample
playing time once they become adjusted
to the Stanford system.
This year's schedule will be extremely
challenging as Stanford faces several
nationally-ranked competitors, including
Long Beach State, San Jose State and Cal
at home.
Another reason for continued op
timism that the team will turn in a fine
performance in 1983 is the development
of a squad with significant depth for the
first time in many years. Good depth will
allow the Cardinal to play a flexible game,
with a competent reserve squad in case of
injuries.
With the extra depth, the key element
to Stanford's success this season will be
the development of an integrated, team
style of play with an emphasis on even
distribution of attack and consistent de
fensive play. The performance of the
freshmen in key starting roles will also
have a major impact upon regular season
results.

Water polo
The water polo program at Stanford
University is no stranger to success.
Under Head Coach Dante Dettamanti,
over the last six years the Cardinal has
never placed lower than third in the na
tion. That string of results could be se
verely tested during the 1983 season.
In fact, the upcoming season may be
the first time that opposing teams may
actually relish the opportunity to square
off against Stanford. Pre-season polls
have rated the Cardinal as the number
eight team in the nation, the first time that
they will have been ranked lowerthan the
fourth spot in eight years.
Graduation has taken its toll on this
year's team. However, ace goalie Steve
Moyer will return for the 1983 season. A
two time Junior National Team member,
Moyer is one of the most experienced
players on this year's team and should be

one of the top goalies in the nation during
the 1983 season.
In the field, Stanford returns Portola
Valley's Mark Daley. A junior, Daley
should be one of the top drivers on the
team. Sophomore Chris Woolfolk is also
expected to contribute his talents to the
team's attack. Other returning players in
clude junior Marc Gleichart, sophomores
Marvin Mouchawar, John Woodberry,
Justin Lansberg, swimmer James
Reynolds, and Puerto Rican National
Team member Jaime Velez. Velez was a
pleasant surprise for coach Dettamanti
last season, chalking up more playing
time than any other freshman.
Dettamanti has prepared himself quite
well for this year's rebuilding process
with a banner crop of 1983 high school
recruits. Eightenteringfreshmen are high
school All-Americans and five of those
eight are U.S. Junior National team mem
bers who participated in this summer's
Junior National World Championships in

Spain.
Thp road to an NCAA Championship
for this year's Cardinal water polo team
maybe a long, tough, uphill battle, how
ever. Despite an untested reserve of
rookie starters, coach Dettamanti has set
his eventual sights on yet another NCSS
crown. Of course, even he will readily
admit that the lack of experience which
characterizes his young squad may make
that goal a difficult one to achieve.
This year's team is not short on talent,
but it will take some time for the team to
develop consistency and become game
tough. "As with any young squad, the
mostdifficult aspect of teamwork is learn
ing to develop a consistent style of play.
This year's team will be extremely com
petitive, with the ability to beat any team
in the country. The key to our success
depends, to a great extent, upon how
quickly we are able to develop as a team.
Individually, the skills are there. Team
wise, they will take a bit longer to de
velop," states Dettamanti.
