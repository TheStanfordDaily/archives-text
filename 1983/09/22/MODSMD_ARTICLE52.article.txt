# A 						campus running guide
## 
### 
On any given working day
around 8 a.m. or 5:30 p.m.,
students, professors, and even
the University president on oc
casion, swarm to the running
trails that thread through the
campus and the surrounding
foothills. The central campus
and its environs boast some of
the most varied and challeng
ing runs in the Bay Area. A list
of the favorite courses follows.
There are two Par Courses on
campus, one starting near
Angell Field and the other near
Roble Hall. Each consists of a
series of exercises staggered
over a two mile run.
The Lake Lagunita Run covers
about 1.5 miles. Run toward
the lake on Lagunita Drive
(keeping the parking lot and
the Bechtel Center on your
left). Cross Lomita Drive and
run up a short hill to the Boath
ouse. Take a left onto the path
between Lambda Nu house
and the lake. Follow the path
all the way around the lake
until you cross over a small
creek. Run along the fence
until you hit the pathway
around the lake. Return to the
Boathouse.
University President Donald
Kennedy welcomes running
partners of all speeds to go
overthe Dish Run when he runs
it very early in the morning.
Call Kennedy's office to find

out when to meet at the back
lawn of Hoover House, where
Santa Ynez deadends into Cab
rillo. If you'd rather go it alone,
take Campus Drive until it hits
Junipero Serra and enter the
fence to the dish. Follow the
road straight up the hill to the
dish. The road diverges at one
point, the right fork being a
gentler and longer slope to the
top of the grade. Take a sharp
turn to the left at the top of the
hill and run along the ridge for
about a mile or so: Proceed
down the hill, always bearing
to the right. At the bottom of
the hill cross Junipero Serra,
and run down Frenchman's
Road to Mayfield. Turn left on
Mayfield and return to Campus
Drive to complete the five mile
course.
To begin the 11-mile Aras
tradero Loop, start down Cam
pus Drive past Wilbur Field.
Turn right on Bowdoin Strpet.
Turn right on Stanford Avenue
and follow it until you cross
Junipero Serra. Turn left on
Junipero Serra and follow it
until Page Mill. Turn right on
Old Page Mill Road. Run along
Page Mill until you cross Aras
tradero Road. Turn right. Fol
low Arastradero out about 2
miles until the "Zots" intersec
tion on Alpine Road. Turn
right. Follow Alpine back past
the Ladera Shopping Center.

Turn right onto Junipero Serra.
Follow Junipero Serra back
past the lake and onto Campus
Drive.
Angell Field or Stadium Track
Once around equal a quar
ter mile.
