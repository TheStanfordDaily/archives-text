# Taking risks: what are you willing to chance?

Risk taking is not uncommon to
most people. Everyone takes some
kinds of risks in particular areas
while acting prudently in others.
From a developmental perspective,
taking risks can he a growth
promoting process. Going to college or
entering a graduate program is a risk
many of us have been willing to take,
as is trying out for a part in a play or a
team sport. Leaving a secure job for a
more challenging yet less secure
future is a risk as well, that not all, but
some are willing to take. Most would
encourage the taking of such risks.
Yet there are some risks in which
the benefits are more difficult to un
derstand and. from a health perspec
tive. may be quite detrimental. In
terms of students' lives, this type of
risk includes smoking, drinking and
taking drugs. They also include not
using seatbelts, bicycle helmets or
contraception.
Contraception
As reported in another article in this
issue of The Student Body , in terms ol
contraception, the major risk is to the
21 percent of Stanford students who
are sexually active but who do not use
contraception each time they have
sexual relations.
Bicycle Helmets
At Cowell. countless students come
in for treatment for injuries which
might have been buffered by a bicycle
helmet. Yet. of the 86 percent of Stan
ford students who ride bicycles, only
seven percent use a helmet and only
four percent of this small group wear
a helmet on a consistent basis.

Seatbelts
As most know, one of the major
causes of death and disability for
college-age students is car accidents;
hence, our concern with seatbelt use.
It is encouraging to note that 51 per
cent of the Stanford student popula
tion consistently wear seatbelts. Our
concern is for the risk taken by the 26
percent who nfeier or rarely wear seat
belts.
Alcohol
Alcohol use is more difficult to eval
uate in terms of its risk. For students
with low tolerance for alcohol, one or
two drinks is a substantial risk. But
generally our concern is for those who
drink frequently and who drink a lot
each time they do. From this perspec
tive, the 12 percent of the students
.who drink alcohol several times a
week might be at risk. The fact that
students under 21 drink more per oc
casion than students over 21 may
present a risk as well. An interesting
finding regarding the assessment of
risk is that people who may be over
drinking seem willing to recognize
this risk, as the data showed that the
more often students drink, the more
they say they drink "too much" alco
hol.
Drugs
Drug use was reported as relatively
low in the survey. While 27 percent re
ported having smoked marijuana, just
3.8 percent of the students reported
having smoked marijuana once or
twice a week or more. Cocaine use
was reported by 14 percent of the
sample, with three percent of those
using cocaine monthly or more often.
Psychedelics and amphetamines were
used by only five and four percent of
the students, respectively, and even
then only a few times a year.

Smoking
Almost anyone can cite the hazards
of cigarette smoking it is a behavior
which is associated with multiple
diseases. It was heartening to learn
that only six percent of Stanford stu
dents indicated that they smoked.
More graduate students than under
graduates and more men than women
smoke. Compared to national
averages, six percent is a low smoking
rate. Since, in the long term, smoking
is considered a very high-risk behav
ior. we wondered about other health
practices of smokers. We were
surprised to learn that, compared to
non-smokers, smokers seem to engage
in more risk taking activities; smokers
said they drink alcohol more often,
drink "too much" alcohol more often,
use drugs more often, exercise less of
ten, and wear seatbelts and bicycle

helmets less often than non-smokers.
While these findings are dramatic, a
question that remains unanswered is
whether all smokers engage in these
risk areas more often than non
smokers or whether a subset of
smokers is contributing to the differ
ence between smokers and non
smokers.
Risk taking is a value-laden con
cept. What is a risk for one person is
not necessarily a risk for another.
Health risk-taking behavior is not at
epidemic proportions at Stanford, and
the consequences to the community
may be negligible. However, the con
sequences to the individual can be
quite significant. It is simply impor
tant for those of us who take these
kinds of risks to take them knowing
what we are doing and what the
outcomes are for us.
