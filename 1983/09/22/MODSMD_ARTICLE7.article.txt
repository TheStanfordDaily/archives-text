# The 						unplanned pregnancy and what students do to prevent it
## 
### LAURA ARNOLD 
Did you know that 40 per
cent of Stanford students have
no need for birth control?
Reasons range from not
being "sexually active" to
being gay to desiring preg
nancy. Of those who do need
birth control, 79 percent use
contraception each time they
have sexual intercourse. But
this also means that 21 percent
use contraception with differ
ent degrees of regularity, or ir
regularity, when they have
sexual intercourse.
If over 20 percent of the
sexually active student
population are not adequately
using contraception, it is im
portant to consider possible
reasons and consequences.
Almost four percent of the
sexually-active women who
responded to the survey said
that they have had an un
planned pregnancy while at
Stanford.
Inconsistent use becomes
especially important as one
examines the frequency of
various contraceptive meth

ods. Barrier or mechanical
methods such as the
diaphragm (41 percent) and
the condom (44 percent) have
had a resurgence in popularity
in recent years. Concern over
potential side effects of meth
ods such as the oral contracep
tive, or The Pill, and the I.U.D.
may explain at least part of the
transition to barrier forms of
contraception. The Pill and, to
a larger degree, the I.U.D. have
declined in use (only 4.8 per
cent of women in the survey
use an 1.U.D.), Further,
reproductive education and
increased comfort with one's
body have contributed to the
return to methods that require
forethought and active partici
pation of one or, ideally, both
partners.
However, these barrier
methods are not without side
effects; they are considered by
some to be inconvenient, af
fecting the spontaneity of
lovemaking. Furthermore, bar
rier methods have an inherent
ly higher risk of pregnancy
than The Pill or the I.U.D. if

I hey are not used consistently
and correctly.
Cowell currently provides a
diaphragm class to educate
students in that method. The
Contraceptive Peer Coun
selors, as well as the medical
staff, provide general
reproductive education as
well.
If lack of education is not
the only explanation, it is nec
essary to consider why people
with access to birth control in
formation and contraceptive
products are only sporadic
users. Ambivalence about he
coming or being sexually ac
tive may he a contributing fac
tor. Someone who is not sure
that he or she is ready for
sexuality is less likely to be a
conscientious contraceptor.
The "double standard" per
sists. Women are still uncom
fortable if they appear to have
planned ahead for sexual ac
tivity. Yet, the barrier methods
necessitate this forethought.
It has been hypothesized
that the most consistent con
traceptors are in longer-term

relationships, with both
partners sharing the responsi
bility for birth control.
However, in consideration of
the methods currently
available, women ultimately
bear the responsibility for in
suring that they will not have
an unplanned pregnancy. This
often influences the method
chosen, especially in more
casual relationships.

Every available method has
a measure of safety, effective
ness, and convenience, and
each individual must weigh
the importance of each to his
or her needs. Available educa
tion attempts to tailor itself to
the needs and uncertainties of
students, hut ultimately each
must choose not what the
"best" method is, but what he
or she will actually use.
