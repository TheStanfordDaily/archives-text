Many students here have expressed
an interest in first-aid cure. We hope
that this issue iv ill add to your first-aid
knowledge. In addition, we welcome
vou lo drop by Cowell with any ques
tions you may have.
Ankle sprain: An ankle sprain is
caused by a strong, unusual turn or
blow to the joint. Apply an ice pack or
cold cloths to area immediately, and
elevate the injured ankle above the
level of the heart. This elevation
decreases pain and swelling. If the
sprain hurts more than a little, use
crutches to remove weight from
injured ankle when it is necessary to be
up and around. Swelling and pain
should begin to subside within 4B
hours.
Burns: How bad is a burn? Burns are
classified as first, second and third
degree, according to the depth of the
burn. First degree burns are superficial
and cause the skin to turn red. A sun
burn is usually a first degree burn.
Second degree burns are deeper, and
result in splitting of the skin layers or
blisters. Scalding with hot water or a
very severe sunburn with blisters are
common instances of second degree
burns. Third degree burns destroy all
layers of the skin and extend into the
deeper tissues. They are painless be
cause nerve endings have been
destroyed. First degree burns seldom
need a doctor's attention. Second
degree burns can be treated at home if
they are not extensive. But any second
degree bum which involves more than
20 or :I0 square inches of skin is exten
sive enough to warrant professional

medical care. A second degree burn
that involves face or hands also should
be seen by a physician; this type of
burn might result in cosmetic prob
lems or loss of function. All third
degree burns should be seen by a
physician because these burns lead to
scarring and infection, and skin grafts
are often needed.
To treat minor burns at home, apply
something cold immediately. This
reduces the amount of skin damage
done by the burn and also eases pain.
The cold should be applied for at least
five minutes and kept on until pain is
relieved or for one hour, whichever
comes first. Reapply if pain returns.
Aspirin may be used to reduce pain as
well. Blisters should not be ruptured. If
they burst by themselves, as they often
do, the overlaying skin should be
allowed to remain as a "wet dressing."
The use of local anesthetic creams or
sprays is not recommended as they
may slow the normal healing. Any
burns which continue to be painful for
more than 48 hours should be seen at
Cowell. Also, any burn which blisters
may require sterile dressing, which
also can be obtained at Cowell.
Cuts: Active and vigorous bleeding can
almost always be controlled by the ap
plication of direct pressure to the
wound. If the wound continues to
bleed despite the application of pres
sure, medical attention is required.
Head injuries: Nature has carefully
cushioned the valuable contents of the
skull. Few minor bumps lead to prob
lems beyond initial pain. However,
careful observation following any head
injury is a good idea. Ice applied to the
traumatized area may minimize the

swelling. If there is bleeding from the
eyes, ears or mouth, if both eyes are
blackened, if the patient is knocked
unconscious, if the patient cannot re
member the injury, or if the patient has
double vision or any severe vomiting,
he should be taken to Cowell immedi
ately.
Infected wounds: An infected wound
usually festers beneath the surface of
the skin, resulting in pain, swelling
and redness. Occasionally, "red streak
ing" will occur. Medical attention is
required if these signs appear.
Insect bites: Most insect bites are
trivial. Insect bites or stings may cause
reactions either locally or in the basic
body systems. Local reactions may be
uncomfortable, but do not pose a
serious hazard. In contrast, "systemic"
reactions occasionally may be serious
and may require emergency treatment.
The most common systemic reaction is
an asthma attack, characterized by dif
ficulty in breathing. Hives and skin
rashes following insect bites are less
serious, but indicate that a reaction has
occurred and a more severe reaction
might occur if bitten or stung again.
Very rarely fainting or loss of con
sciousness may occur. If this does oc
cur, the patient must be taken to an
emergency care provider immediately.
If a patient has had any of these reac
tions in the past, he or she should go
immediately to a medical facility if
stung or bitten. But for most bites,
home treatment is appropriate. If an in
sect stinger is in place, remove it im
mediately and apply something cold.
Ice cold-packs may be used. Delay in
application results in a more severe
local reaction.

Nosebleed: Nosebleeds may occur
spontaneously or as a result of injury.
Sit up with head held back and pinch
the nostrils together. Do not blow your
nose. It may be necessary to maintain
pressure for several minutes.
Sometimes a cold, wet towel applied to
the area will help to stop the bleeding.
Poison oak: The itching skin lesions
which follow contact with a poison
oak plant, and other plants of the Rhus
family, result in "contact dermatitis."
This means that something has been
applied to the skin which has caused
the skin to react to it. In this case the
oil of the plant results in a rash after 12
to 48 hours and persists for approxi
mately two weeks. Contact may be in
direct from pets, contaminated cloth
ing, or from smoke from burning Rhus
plants. It can occur in any season.
Come into Cowell for treatment, self
care information and supplies.
Puncture wounds: Puncture wounds
are caused by nails, pins, tacks, and
other sharp objects. Allow the wound
to bleed to carry foreign material to the
outside, wash thoroughly with soap
and warm water. Hydrogen peroxide
can be used to cleanse the wound. Con
sult your records or your physician to
determine if you need a tetanus
booster.
