# Four frosh making valued contributions
## 
### JASON COLE 
The class of 1987 could be a
vintage year for the Stanford
football program. A fine nu
cleus of talent has already
emerged from this year's
freshman class and some
others look like blue-chip
products for the future.
Heading up this year's
freshman class are three
players who have already
played a significant amount of
time. Quarterback John Paye,
halfback Thomas Henley and
linebacker Joseph Cain.
Paye is the most prominent
of them. The 6-foot-2, 188
pound Paye has already
shown that he will probably
be another in the great line of
Stanford quarterbacks.
After moving into the
second-string spot just before
the opening game against
Oklahoma, Paye saw playing
time in his first college game.
With Stanford down 27-7 in
the fourth quarter against the
Sooners, Paye came in and
drove the Cardinal to a touch
down. On the next offensive
possesion, Paye again had the
team moving but an unfor
tunate fumble ended the drive
and essentially the game.
After the game, Oklahoma
Coach Barry Switzer said
simply, "I think they
(Stanford) found themselves a
quarterback."
Paye's final statistics on the
day were impressive. He com
pleted five of six passes for 88

yards and one touchdown.
Against Illinois last week,
Paye entered the game after
starter Steve Cottrell
sprained his ankle. Paye
played most of the game and
led the Cardinal to its only
touchdown in a 17-7 loss.
However, Paye did commit
several errors, including
throwing two interceptions.
More than anything else,
Paye's inexperience showed
in those errors.

Still, Jack Elway, head coach
at San Jose State and father of
former Stanford Ail-American
quarterback John Elway, said
that Paye "compared quite
favorably at this stage" with
his son. .
Paye, thus far, has com
pleted more than 60 percent
of his passes for 260 yards and
two touchdowns. Cottrell, a
senior, will again start for
Stanford if he is healthy, but
Paye may play if the offense

keeps running in circles.
Paye was Stanford's number
one recruit last year. From
nearby Menlo Park, he led
Menlo School to a state cham
pionship and was the Central
Coast Section Player of the
Year last year. His statistics
were impressive, as he rolled
up 3388 yards in passing and
37 touchdowns, both state
records.
Henley, like Paye, is listed
number two at his position,

halfback.
Henley had an auspicious
beginning to his Stanford
career. In the opening game
against Oklahoma, Henley
scored the Cardinal's first
touchdown on a 26-yard pass
from Cottrell.
Although he's behind sop
homore Kevin Scott, Henley is
seeing a lot of playing time. He
has carried the ball six times,
caught three passes and
returned five kickoffs.
The 5-11 Henley is an excep
tionally quick runner who
reminds the Stanford coaches
of former Cardinal star, and
now professional, Darrin Nel
son. As he proved in the Okla
homa game, he is also an adept
receiver.
A native of Ontario, Califor
nia, Henley attended Damien
High School where he rushed
for 1900 yards on 250 attempts
during his senior year. He
also earned all-California In
terscholastic Federation (CIF)
as well as many other honors.
Henley said his biggest ad
justment was adapting to the
more complicated offense run
by Stanford. "I've had to learn
a lot, very fast," he said.
The mention of the name
Joseph Cain to other football
players incites a couple of
responses. First, the player
will smile. Second, he'll
chuckle and repeat Cain's
name: "Joe Cain, Joe Cain."

EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS: Freshman John Paye, who is known more for his passing prowess,
executes a running play. Many thought Paye would redshirt this year, but Paye proved he is too
valuable to remain away from the action. Paye declined scholarship offers from Notre Dame and
UCLA before coming to Stanford.
