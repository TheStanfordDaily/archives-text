# Four frosh making valued contributions
## 
### JASON COLE 
The class of 1987 could be a
vintage year for the Stanford
football program. A fine nu
cleus of talent has already
emerged from this year's
freshman class and some
others look like blue-chip
products for the future.
Heading up this year's
freshman class are three
players who have already
played a significant amount of
time. Quarterback John Paye,
halfback Thomas Henley and
linebacker Joseph Cain.
Paye is the most prominent
of them. The 6-foot-2, 188
pound Paye has already
shown that he will probably
be another in the great line of
Stanford quarterbacks.
After moving into the
second-string spot just before
the opening game against
Oklahoma, Paye saw playing
time in his first college game.
With Stanford down 27-7 in
the fourth quarter against the
Sooners, Paye came in and
drove the Cardinal to a touch
down. On the next offensive
possesion, Paye again had the
team moving but an unfor
tunate fumble ended the drive
and essentially the game.
After the game, Oklahoma
Coach Barry Switzer said
simply, "I think they
(Stanford) found themselves a
quarterback."
Paye's final statistics on the
day were impressive. He com
pleted five of six passes for 88

yards and one touchdown.
Against Illinois last week,
Paye entered the game after
starter Steve Cottrell
sprained his ankle. Paye
played most of the game and
led the Cardinal to its only
touchdown in a 17-7 loss.
However, Paye did commit
several errors, including
throwing two interceptions.
More than anything else,
Paye's inexperience showed
in those errors.

Still, Jack Elway, head coach
at San Jose State and father of
former Stanford Ail-American
quarterback John Elway, said
that Paye "compared quite
favorably at this stage" with
his son. .
Paye, thus far, has com
pleted more than 60 percent
of his passes for 260 yards and
two touchdowns. Cottrell, a
senior, will again start for
Stanford if he is healthy, but
Paye may play if the offense

keeps running in circles.
Paye was Stanford's number
one recruit last year. From
nearby Menlo Park, he led
Menlo School to a state cham
pionship and was the Central
Coast Section Player of the
Year last year. His statistics
were impressive, as he rolled
up 3388 yards in passing and
37 touchdowns, both state
records.
Henley, like Paye, is listed
number two at his position,

halfback.
Henley had an auspicious
beginning to his Stanford
career. In the opening game
against Oklahoma, Henley
scored the Cardinal's first
touchdown on a 26-yard pass
from Cottrell.
Although he's behind sop
homore Kevin Scott, Henley is
seeing a lot of playing time. He
has carried the ball six times,
caught three passes and
returned five kickoffs.
The 5-11 Henley is an excep
tionally quick runner who
reminds the Stanford coaches
of former Cardinal star, and
now professional, Darrin Nel
son. As he proved in the Okla
homa game, he is also an adept
receiver.
A native of Ontario, Califor
nia, Henley attended Damien
High School where he rushed
for 1900 yards on 250 attempts
during his senior year. He
also earned all-California In
terscholastic Federation (CIF)
as well as many other honors.
Henley said his biggest ad
justment was adapting to the
more complicated offense run
by Stanford. "I've had to learn
a lot, very fast," he said.
The mention of the name
Joseph Cain to other football
players incites a couple of
responses. First, the player
will smile. Second, he'll
chuckle and repeat Cain's
name: "Joe Cain, Joe Cain."

EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS: Freshman John Paye, who is known more for his passing prowess,
executes a running play. Many thought Paye would redshirt this year, but Paye proved he is too
valuable to remain away from the action. Paye declined scholarship offers from Notre Dame and
UCLA before coming to Stanford.
senior Kevin Lamar. "Just the
way he talks and is always
laughing whenever anybody
says anything. He's great."
Cain came to Stanford as a
defensive back, but was
quickly moved to outride
linebacker. He's 6-1, 200
pounds, and has 4.5-second
speed in the 40-yard-dash,
making him an effective combi
nation of speed and power.
So far, Cain has demon
strated his skills on both the

kickoff and punt teams, and
has yet to play in a regular de
fensive situation. Cain is also
playing behind returning
starter Matt Soderlund.
Cain, a Los Angeles native,
led Compton High School in
tackles the last three years,
averaging 14 a game. He was
named to the All-CIF team last
year among other honors.
Despite having been a
linebacker in high school,
Cain said the change from
high school to college was still
dramatic. "High school
players just don't come at you
like these guys. I've had to
learn a lot more technique

and style," he said.
The only thing keeping ful
lback Marshall Dillard from
playing may be experience.
The 6-3, 210-pound Dillard is
playing behind two veteran
players, Rob Moore and
Kaulana Park.
Dillard, who is from
Bakersfield, California,
rushed for 2115 yards and 40
touchdowns for Bakersfield
High School last year and
received almost every honor
available. He was one of Stan
ford's top recruits last year
and could be the fullback of
the future.
