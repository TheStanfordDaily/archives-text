# Greg Topp leaves Farm, transfers to SDSU
## 
### JASON COLE 
In 1979, a freshman named
John Elway entered Stanford
and saw playing time almost
immediately. That event subse
quently led to the transfer of
two back-up quarterbacks,
Grayson Rogers and Babe
Laufenberg.
In 1983, history is repeating
itself. Third-string quarter
back Greg Topp decided last
week to transfer to San Diego
State University.
Topp, a 6-foot-4, 192-pound
junior, said that there were
"better quarterbacking op

portunities elsewhere." What
that translates into is that
Topp did not expect to play
here.
Topp started the year as
second-string to starter Steve
Cottrell, but freshman sensa
tion John Paye soon overtook
Topp. After both Cottrell and
Paye saw action against Okla
homa in the season opener,
Topp decided to transfer.
Before finally deciding to
enter San Diego State, Topp
also considered both Indiana
University and the University
of Idaho.

Topp is a native of Flagstaff,
Arizona, where he went to
Flagstaff High School and was
a teammate of present Stan
ford running back Stan Gill.
When Topp entered Stan
ford in 1981, he was also a
promising punter. During his
freshman season, Topp
averaged 36.7 yards per punt
on 54 attempts. In 1982, he
averaged 34.0 yards on just 10
punts before losing his job to
Tripp Hardin.
Topp's only appearance at
quarterback for Stanford was
in 1982 against Oregon State

when he went one-for-five
with four yards and one inter
ception.
Topp will be eligible to play
for San Diego State in 1984 and
will have two years of
eligibility remaining.
Topp said, "I'll miss Stan
ford a great deal. But I feel I
can be a major college quar
terback, and it was evident
that I was not going to get the
opportunity at Stanford, espe
cially with John Paye on the

scene. I want to make it clear
that there is no animosity be
tween myself and any of the
coaches or the other quarter
backs.
"Transferring, however, is
the only chance I would ever
have of playing. If I didn't
transfer, I would deprive
myself that chance, and
there's no question I would al
ways wonder just how far I
could go in the game of foot
ball."
