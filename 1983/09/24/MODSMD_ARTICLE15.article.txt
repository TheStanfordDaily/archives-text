### 
In today's pregame show, the Band salutes
those memories as "The Stanford Band Applies
To Stanford."
The Band's GPA falls well below its goal of
4.00. Desperation is apparent as the LSJUMB
pleads " 'All I Ever Wanted' was to please Dean
Fred."
In extra-curricular activities, the Band has
likewise floundered. Since their brief football
career ended in disaster, the Band plays up its
experience "Workin' for the MCA" while
recording last year's album.
Then a miracle occurs, and Dean Fred ex
tends an "Open Invitation" to the Band. Maybe
Dean Fred wants to promote "diversity." Or

maybe he just wants to lower the curve.
Today's halftime show is "Freshman Orienta
tion : Follow Us To Good Times." (But expect to
wait in line first).
"Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing" poor in
digent frosh. Since Stanford is situated in the
liberal-minded Bay Area, freshmen should
have no trouble getting financial AIDS.
Those frosh who cannot paye now are
"Depending on You," Stanford, to let them
defer.
Between the lines at the bank and the phone
center and registration, the Band thinks Stan
ford ought to "Let the Children Play" and
really get to know each other.
