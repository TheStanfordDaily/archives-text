# Two similar teams looking for win today
## 
### JASON COLE 
San Jose State and Stanford come into today's
game with a great deal in common. Both are
playing their third game, both lost their last
game and both have a lot to prove.
For Stanford (0-2), the pre-season expecta
tions have gone somewhat sour. Although the
Cardinal defense has played impressive foot
ball in holding other teams, the offense has
been all but ineffective.
That is a strange turn of events for Stanford.
In the past few years the Cardinal offense has
been all but unstoppable and the defense has
been a sieve.
In the season opener against Oklahoma, the
Cardinal defense held the Sooners, then
ranked number two in the country, to 27
points. The defense, however, was not even
responsible for nine of the Sooners' points,
due to a punt return for a touchdown and the
sack of quarterback Steve Cottrell for a safety.
But the offense scored only 14 points that
day. Although much of that can be credited to
Oklahoma's fine defense, Stanford's offense
was just as much to blame. Not only did the of

fense fail to get a first down in the first quar
ter, but it did not score until late in the first
half.
The second half was not much better as the
Cardinal was again shut down during the third
quarter. Freshman sensation John Paye then
led the offense to its second touchdown of the
game during the fourth quarter. However,
Paye's efforts ended up being too little, too
late.
Although disappointed, the team was not
mentally defeated. As senior reserve offensive
lineman Scott Carpenter commented after the
game, "Oklahoma didn't beat us, we beat our
selves with mistakes. You're not going to see us
making those kinds of mistakes again. We're
going to be a good football team."
In its second game, Stanford traveled to
Champaign, Illinois to face the University of Il
linois. The story was the same there, as the
defense played well allowing only 17 points
(seven on a blocked punt), but the offense
managed only a single touchdown. The 17-7
loss was frustrating in more ways than one.

IN THE TRENCHES: Senior defensive lineman Pat Mitchel
started every game last season as a defensive end in the 3-4
alignment. In the 4-3 this season, Mitchel and Terry Jackson
have shared playing time.
