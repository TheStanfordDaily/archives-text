# Two similar teams looking for win today
## 
### JASON COLE 
San Jose State and Stanford come into today's
game with a great deal in common. Both are
playing their third game, both lost their last
game and both have a lot to prove.
For Stanford (0-2), the pre-season expecta
tions have gone somewhat sour. Although the
Cardinal defense has played impressive foot
ball in holding other teams, the offense has
been all but ineffective.
That is a strange turn of events for Stanford.
In the past few years the Cardinal offense has
been all but unstoppable and the defense has
been a sieve.
In the season opener against Oklahoma, the
Cardinal defense held the Sooners, then
ranked number two in the country, to 27
points. The defense, however, was not even
responsible for nine of the Sooners' points,
due to a punt return for a touchdown and the
sack of quarterback Steve Cottrell for a safety.
But the offense scored only 14 points that
day. Although much of that can be credited to
Oklahoma's fine defense, Stanford's offense
was just as much to blame. Not only did the of

fense fail to get a first down in the first quar
ter, but it did not score until late in the first
half.
The second half was not much better as the
Cardinal was again shut down during the third
quarter. Freshman sensation John Paye then
led the offense to its second touchdown of the
game during the fourth quarter. However,
Paye's efforts ended up being too little, too
late.
Although disappointed, the team was not
mentally defeated. As senior reserve offensive
lineman Scott Carpenter commented after the
game, "Oklahoma didn't beat us, we beat our
selves with mistakes. You're not going to see us
making those kinds of mistakes again. We're
going to be a good football team."
In its second game, Stanford traveled to
Champaign, Illinois to face the University of Il
linois. The story was the same there, as the
defense played well allowing only 17 points
(seven on a blocked punt), but the offense
managed only a single touchdown. The 17-7
loss was frustrating in more ways than one.

IN THE TRENCHES: Senior defensive lineman Pat Mitchel
started every game last season as a defensive end in the 3-4
alignment. In the 4-3 this season, Mitchel and Terry Jackson
have shared playing time.
On several occasions the Cardinal had major
offensive plays called back by penalties. The
opening play of the game was a 50-yard pass
from Cottrell to wide receiver Emile Harry,
which was called back for a motion penalty
against halfback Kevin Scott. Late in the second
quarter, an 82-yard screen pass touchdown
from Paye to Scott was called back for holding.
Thus, not only was the offense assessed
more than 100 yards in penalties, but those
same penalties cost the Cardinal more than 150
additional yards lost in total offense and at least
one touchdown.
The San Jose State Spartans (1-1) have a vic
tory under their collective belt, but are also
coming off a 30-9 loss to UC-Berkeley last
week.
After tying the score at 9-9, the Spartans
were blitzed for three unanswered touch
downs, including a 50-yard interception return
of a pass by San Jose starting quarterback Jon

Carlson. For the day, Carlson threw four in
terceptions and may have thrown himself out
of the solid starting position.
On two different occasions, Carlson was
replaced by backup Bob Frasco. Carlson's con
fidence may be at a low: "It's tough to say if I'm
No. 1. I'm looking forward to starting (against
Stanford). I think I'll be right there. (The game)
didn't do a lot for my confidence."
No matter who's throwing for the Spartans,
the favorite target will be wide receiver Eric
Richardson. Richardson is averaging 22.6 yards
a catch on 10 receptions, two of which went for
touchdowns. His 4.48-second speed in the 40-
yard-dash makes him a definite deep threat. He
was a second team All-PCAA performer last
year and looks like a good bet to repeat.
The San Jose State defense has also allowed
more than 20 points in each of its two outings.
Spartan Head Coach Jack Elway called his
defense "young and inexperienced", but Car
dinal Head Coach Paul Wiggin described them
as "fast and aggressive." The Spartans,
however, lost starting safety Lou Patrone for
the rest of the season with a knee injury.
This may seem to leave the spectator with
very little to cheer for or about. But judging
from the past, that's far from the truth.
San Jose State has won the last two con
frontations and is looking to avenge their

lifetime losing record against Stanford
(Stanford leads the series 32-6-1). This game is
always an emotional one, especially during the
last four years when it was known as the
"Elway Bowl," because it pitted father-coach
Jack against his quarterback-son, John.
Stanford is also hungry for a win. After two
losses that many players and coaches believe
could have been victories, the Cardinal needs
a win to give it some confidence before it heads
into a tough Pac-10 conference schedule. If it
doesn't win today, Stanford might have a long
disappointing season ahead. Wiggin said, "I
don't try to think that way about a season
(looking ahead to future games)." But he might
have to.
On defense, look for Stanford to be strong.
They have a penchant for giving up a lot of
yards but few points. As defensive end (and
All-America candidate) Garin Veris puts it,
"The defense is designed to give up some of
the shorter plays to prevent the big play. We
get tough when they (other teams) get close."
The defensive secondary, led by two-time Ail-
American Vaughn Williams, was very ag
gressive last Saturday and that should not

change.
The only question mark on defense, and it's a
big one, is middle linebacker Dave Wyman.
Wyman, who leads the defense in tackles with
31, tore the tendon in his left ring finger and it
may require surgery. He is listed as probable
for this game, but Wiggin indicated Tuesday
Wyman would play.
On offense, the Cardinal certainly has the
tools to score; it's just a question of when it
will emerge from its shell. Senior Mike Tolliver
leads the team, and is among the nation's
leading receivers, with 15 receptions and two
touchdowns. On the other side is All-America
candidate Harry, who is averaging more than
20 yards a catch on five receptions. Halfback
Scott has seven receptions out of the backfield,
not including the 82-yard play that was called
back.
Throwing to them will be either Cottrell or
Paye. Cottrell is a senior with a lot of experi
ence. He has completed more than 52 percent
of his passes for 263 yards and one touchdown,
he is listed as the starter, but a sprained ankle
may force him to the bench. If so, Paye will go
into his third game. Paye is almost everything
that Stanford had hoped when they recruited
him. Thus far, he has completed more than 60
percent of his passes for 260 yards and two
TDs.

AFTER THE COMPLETION: Senior starting tight end Jim Clymer runs for extra yardage after
catching a pass against Oklahoma. After another reception in that same game, a 27-14 season
opening loss, Clymer appeared headed for a touchdown but was stripped of the ball by an Okla
homa defender.

making those kinds of mistakes again. We're
going to be a good football team."
In its second game, Stanford traveled to
Champaign, Illinois to face the University of Il
linois. The story was the same there, as the
defense played well allowing only 17 points
(seven on a blocked punt), but the offense
managed only a single touchdown. The 17-7
loss was frustrating in more ways than one.

IN THE TRENCHES: Senior defensive lineman Pat Mitchel
started every game last season as a defensive end in the 3-4
alignment. In the 4-3 this season, Mitchel and Terry Jackson
have shared playing time.
On several occasions the Cardinal had major
offensive plays called back by penalties. The
opening play of the game was a 50-yard pass
from Cottrell to wide receiver Emile Harry,
which was called back for a motion penalty
against halfback Kevin Scott. Late in the second
quarter, an 82-yard screen pass touchdown
from Paye to Scott was called back for holding.
Thus, not only was the offense assessed
more than 100 yards in penalties, but those
same penalties cost the Cardinal more than 150
additional yards lost in total offense and at least
one touchdown.
The San Jose State Spartans (1-1) have a vic
tory under their collective belt, but are also
coming off a 30-9 loss to UC-Berkeley last
week.
After tying the score at 9-9, the Spartans
were blitzed for three unanswered touch
downs, including a 50-yard interception return
of a pass by San Jose starting quarterback Jon

Carlson. For the day, Carlson threw four in
terceptions and may have thrown himself out
of the solid starting position.
On two different occasions, Carlson was
replaced by backup Bob Frasco. Carlson's con
fidence may be at a low: "It's tough to say if I'm
No. 1. I'm looking forward to starting (against
Stanford). I think I'll be right there. (The game)
didn't do a lot for my confidence."
No matter who's throwing for the Spartans,
the favorite target will be wide receiver Eric
Richardson. Richardson is averaging 22.6 yards
a catch on 10 receptions, two of which went for
touchdowns. His 4.48-second speed in the 40-
yard-dash makes him a definite deep threat. He
was a second team All-PCAA performer last
year and looks like a good bet to repeat.
The San Jose State defense has also allowed
more than 20 points in each of its two outings.
Spartan Head Coach Jack Elway called his
defense "young and inexperienced", but Car
dinal Head Coach Paul Wiggin described them
as "fast and aggressive." The Spartans,
however, lost starting safety Lou Patrone for
the rest of the season with a knee injury.
This may seem to leave the spectator with
very little to cheer for or about. But judging
from the past, that's far from the truth.
San Jose State has won the last two con
frontations and is looking to avenge their

lifetime losing record against Stanford
(Stanford leads the series 32-6-1). This game is
always an emotional one, especially during the
last four years when it was known as the
"Elway Bowl," because it pitted father-coach
Jack against his quarterback-son, John.
Stanford is also hungry for a win. After two
losses that many players and coaches believe
could have been victories, the Cardinal needs
a win to give it some confidence before it heads
into a tough Pac-10 conference schedule. If it
doesn't win today, Stanford might have a long
disappointing season ahead. Wiggin said, "I
don't try to think that way about a season
(looking ahead to future games)." But he might
have to.
On defense, look for Stanford to be strong.
They have a penchant for giving up a lot of
yards but few points. As defensive end (and
All-America candidate) Garin Veris puts it,
"The defense is designed to give up some of
the shorter plays to prevent the big play. We
get tough when they (other teams) get close."
The defensive secondary, led by two-time Ail-
American Vaughn Williams, was very ag
gressive last Saturday and that should not

change.
The only question mark on defense, and it's a
big one, is middle linebacker Dave Wyman.
Wyman, who leads the defense in tackles with
31, tore the tendon in his left ring finger and it
may require surgery. He is listed as probable
for this game, but Wiggin indicated Tuesday
Wyman would play.
On offense, the Cardinal certainly has the
tools to score; it's just a question of when it
will emerge from its shell. Senior Mike Tolliver
leads the team, and is among the nation's
leading receivers, with 15 receptions and two
touchdowns. On the other side is All-America
candidate Harry, who is averaging more than
20 yards a catch on five receptions. Halfback
Scott has seven receptions out of the backfield,
not including the 82-yard play that was called
back.
Throwing to them will be either Cottrell or
Paye. Cottrell is a senior with a lot of experi
ence. He has completed more than 52 percent
of his passes for 263 yards and one touchdown,
he is listed as the starter, but a sprained ankle
may force him to the bench. If so, Paye will go
into his third game. Paye is almost everything
that Stanford had hoped when they recruited
him. Thus far, he has completed more than 60
percent of his passes for 260 yards and two
TDs.

AFTER THE COMPLETION: Senior starting tight end Jim Clymer runs for extra yardage after
catching a pass against Oklahoma. After another reception in that same game, a 27-14 season
opening loss, Clymer appeared headed for a touchdown but was stripped of the ball by an Okla
homa defender.
San Jose State and Stanford come into today's
game with a great deal in common. Both are
playing their third game, both lost their last
game and both have a lot to prove.
For Stanford (0-2), the pre-season expecta
tions have gone somewhat sour. Although the
Cardinal defense has played impressive foot
ball in holding other teams, the offense has
been all but ineffective.
That is a strange turn of events for Stanford.
In the past few years the Cardinal offense has
been all but unstoppable and the defense has
been a sieve.
In the season opener against Oklahoma, the
Cardinal defense held the Sooners, then
ranked number two in the country, to 27
points. The defense, however, was not even
responsible for nine of the Sooners' points,
due to a punt return for a touchdown and the
sack of quarterback Steve Cottrell for a safety.
But the offense scored only 14 points that
day. Although much of that can be credited to
Oklahoma's fine defense, Stanford's offense
was just as much to blame. Not only did the of

fense fail to get a first down in the first quar
ter, but it did not score until late in the first
half.
The second half was not much better as the
Cardinal was again shut down during the third
quarter. Freshman sensation John Paye then
led the offense to its second touchdown of the
game during the fourth quarter. However,
Paye's efforts ended up being too little, too
late.
Although disappointed, the team was not
mentally defeated. As senior reserve offensive
lineman Scott Carpenter commented after the
game, "Oklahoma didn't beat us, we beat our
selves with mistakes. You're not going to see us
making those kinds of mistakes again. We're
going to be a good football team."
