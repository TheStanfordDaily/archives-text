# Fassel: Quarterback system helps
## 
### JASON COLE 
Ovr the past few years, the
Stanford Cardinal has had one
of the most productive of
fenses in the country.
However, that seems to have
changed this season. In their
first two games, the Cardinal
has scored a total of 21 points.
For the past five years, Jim Fas
sel has been Stanford's of
fensive coordinator. Fassel, 33,
was a quarterback at USC and
Long Beach State before
playing several years in both
the National Football League
and the short-lived World
Football League. He has
coached at the University of
Utah and Weber State, before
coming to Stanford. The fol
lowing is an interview with the
Cardinal coach.
CT: Is having two quarter
backs play hurting the of
fense's consistency?
Fassel: I don't think so. I
think based on the playing ex
perience that both of them

have had on the college level,
I think it's an asset to have
them on the team.to be able to
go to one or the other
depending on how they're
playing. They're similar
enough in their style that it
doesn't hurt our team.
CT: There seems to be a
noticeable difference be
tween when John Paye is in
the game and when Steve Cot
trell is in. The offense seems
to pick up when Paye is in. Do
you see any reason for that?
Fassel: I think the interest
ing thing is that last week
Steve played very well but that
he got some passes dropped
and some big plays called back
with penalties. When John
was in there, he completed
them and the team moved. It
was a little bit of the luck of
the draw. But you're right,
John has moved the team very
well, especially for a fresh
man. The hard thing to say is
that it is not Steve who is stop

ping the offense. It's a lot of
other errors that is prevent
ing the team from moving. I
really believe more than
anything else that the quarter
back takes far too much credit
ahd he takes far too much
blame. When you score a lot
of points, there are a lot of
factors for that and when you

don't move everybody thinks
it's the quarterback's fault. It
can be, but everybody focuses
on it too much.
CT: When you attended
USC, the role of the quarter
back was to direct a running
game and throw as a second
ary option. Even the Stanford
teams under Plunkett estab
lished the running game and
then passed. In this new era
where teams like Stanford are
passing first, how has that
changed coaching styles?
Fassel: I think what you find
is that people say that winning
teams run more than they pass
and if you looked at the games
that we've won, you'll find
that we ran more than we
passed. A lot of that has to do
with the way the game is
going. When you're ahead
you don't need to pass as
much. But I really believe that
to be most effective you have
to have a running game that is
respectable to the point

where the defense can't just
pin their ears back and come
after you with the (pass) rush.
Last year we averaged more
yards per run than USC and
UCLA. Now we didn't run
more than they did, but our
efficiency in running game
was pretty good.
CT: The running game
hasn't been very efficient. Are
you going to stick with it?
Fassel: Yes, I think at certain
times you want to be able to
establish the running game.
Last week we ran a lot on first
down. Now a lot of people
ask, "Why are you running so
much on first down?" If
you're going to establish the
running game, the best time to
do it is on first down. Because
then if you don't do anything
on first down, you've got two
downs to make it up. But let's
say you throw on first down
and it's incomplete. Now
second down you run and


Jim Fassel
your run game isn't going
very well. Well, now you've
got third down and you have
to pick up nine or 10 yards.
But if you run on first and
nothing happens, you still
have two downs to make it up.
Now that sounds funny be
cause all you're doing is run
ning and then passing. What
you really have to do is mix it
up and keep the other team
off balance.
CT: The initial phase of your
game seems to be predictable,
because you try to set up the
running game. It seems that Il
linois was able to anticipate
what you were going to do. Is
the offense too predictable?
Fassel: No, it really wasn't
that. Our weak-side pitch play
was pretty efficient. We were
getting four yards except for a
couple of times. But our weak
side sweep play was based on
an audible situation, depend
ing on what they were doing
on the line.
CT: Who calls the plays and
how are they determined?
Fassel: I do. They're based
on the film work we do before
the game. We break down the
defenses and put all the
defenses in a computer and
figure out what the defenses'
tendencies are going to be. All
the situations like first-and
long, second-and-long, third
and-short are put into the
computer and the results are

given to me. We then make up
a game plan based on what
they (the opposing team)
do. Then, during the game,
we chart our own tendencies
throughout the game. I know
all during the game exactly
what defenses they're giving
me and the plays I've called
against them.
CT: Stanford had one of the
most productive offenses in
the country during the last
few years. Now, although
John Elway is gone, Stanford
still has quite a bit of talent
left. Why aren't we scoring?
Fassel: I think more than
anything we're an inex
perienced offense. Basically,
we have a new center, a new
right guard, a new right
tackle, two new tight ends
(and) the running backs were
playing with the quarter
backs. What we have to do is
try to get the ball in the hands
of those people who are expe
rienced and can handle the
ball. We had some opportuni
ties to make some real big
plays and score two or three
touchdowns in the Illinois
game, and we had the right
play against the right situa
tion. We had nine or ten guys
doing the right thing and one
or two guys not doing it. On
offense, you have to get on all
11 cylinders; everybody has
to do their job or the play gets
stopped. I think what we have
to do, since we're young and
inexperienced, is get the ball
in the hands of those who
have experience.

was pretty good.
CT: The running game
hasn't been very efficient. Are
you going to stick with it?
Fassel: Yes, I think at certain
times you want to be able to
establish the running game.
Last week we ran a lot on first
down. Now a lot of people
ask, "Why are you running so
much on first down?" If
you're going to establish the
running game, the best time to
do it is on first down. Because
then if you don't do anything
on first down, you've got two
downs to make it up. But let's
say you throw on first down
and it's incomplete. Now
second down you run and


Jim Fassel
your run game isn't going
very well. Well, now you've
got third down and you have
to pick up nine or 10 yards.
But if you run on first and
nothing happens, you still
have two downs to make it up.
Now that sounds funny be
cause all you're doing is run
ning and then passing. What
you really have to do is mix it
up and keep the other team
off balance.
CT: The initial phase of your
game seems to be predictable,
because you try to set up the
running game. It seems that Il
linois was able to anticipate
what you were going to do. Is
the offense too predictable?
Fassel: No, it really wasn't
that. Our weak-side pitch play
was pretty efficient. We were
getting four yards except for a
couple of times. But our weak
side sweep play was based on
an audible situation, depend
ing on what they were doing
on the line.
CT: Who calls the plays and
how are they determined?
Fassel: I do. They're based
on the film work we do before
the game. We break down the
defenses and put all the
defenses in a computer and
figure out what the defenses'
tendencies are going to be. All
the situations like first-and
long, second-and-long, third
and-short are put into the
computer and the results are

given to me. We then make up
a game plan based on what
they (the opposing team)
do. Then, during the game,
we chart our own tendencies
throughout the game. I know
all during the game exactly
what defenses they're giving
me and the plays I've called
against them.
CT: Stanford had one of the
most productive offenses in
the country during the last
few years. Now, although
John Elway is gone, Stanford
still has quite a bit of talent
left. Why aren't we scoring?
Fassel: I think more than
anything we're an inex
perienced offense. Basically,
we have a new center, a new
right guard, a new right
tackle, two new tight ends
(and) the running backs were
playing with the quarter
backs. What we have to do is
try to get the ball in the hands
of those people who are expe
rienced and can handle the
ball. We had some opportuni
ties to make some real big
plays and score two or three
touchdowns in the Illinois
game, and we had the right
play against the right situa
tion. We had nine or ten guys
doing the right thing and one
or two guys not doing it. On
offense, you have to get on all
11 cylinders; everybody has
to do their job or the play gets
stopped. I think what we have
to do, since we're young and
inexperienced, is get the ball
in the hands of those who
have experience.
Ovr the past few years, the
Stanford Cardinal has had one
of the most productive of
fenses in the country.
However, that seems to have
changed this season. In their
first two games, the Cardinal
has scored a total of 21 points.
For the past five years, Jim Fas
sel has been Stanford's of
fensive coordinator. Fassel, 33,
was a quarterback at USC and
Long Beach State before
playing several years in both
the National Football League
and the short-lived World
Football League. He has
coached at the University of
Utah and Weber State, before
coming to Stanford. The fol
lowing is an interview with the
Cardinal coach.
CT: Is having two quarter
backs play hurting the of
fense's consistency?
Fassel: I don't think so. I
think based on the playing ex
perience that both of them

have had on the college level,
I think it's an asset to have
them on the team.to be able to
go to one or the other
depending on how they're
playing. They're similar
enough in their style that it
doesn't hurt our team.
CT: There seems to be a
noticeable difference be
tween when John Paye is in
the game and when Steve Cot
trell is in. The offense seems
to pick up when Paye is in. Do
you see any reason for that?
Fassel: I think the interest
ing thing is that last week
Steve played very well but that
he got some passes dropped
and some big plays called back
with penalties. When John
was in there, he completed
them and the team moved. It
was a little bit of the luck of
the draw. But you're right,
John has moved the team very
well, especially for a fresh
man. The hard thing to say is
that it is not Steve who is stop

ping the offense. It's a lot of
other errors that is prevent
ing the team from moving. I
really believe more than
anything else that the quarter
back takes far too much credit
ahd he takes far too much
blame. When you score a lot
of points, there are a lot of
factors for that and when you

don't move everybody thinks
it's the quarterback's fault. It
can be, but everybody focuses
on it too much.
CT: When you attended
USC, the role of the quarter
back was to direct a running
game and throw as a second
ary option. Even the Stanford
teams under Plunkett estab
lished the running game and
then passed. In this new era
where teams like Stanford are
passing first, how has that
changed coaching styles?
Fassel: I think what you find
is that people say that winning
teams run more than they pass
and if you looked at the games
that we've won, you'll find
that we ran more than we
passed. A lot of that has to do
with the way the game is
going. When you're ahead
you don't need to pass as
much. But I really believe that
to be most effective you have
to have a running game that is
respectable to the point

where the defense can't just
pin their ears back and come
after you with the (pass) rush.
Last year we averaged more
yards per run than USC and
UCLA. Now we didn't run
more than they did, but our
efficiency in running game
was pretty good.

hasn't been very efficient. Are
you going to stick with it?
