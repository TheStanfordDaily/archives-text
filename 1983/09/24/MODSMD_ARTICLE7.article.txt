# Elway enjoying benefits of his unorthodox philosophy

Its hard to argue with suc
cess especially the success
the San Jose State football
program has had since Jack El
way became head coach five
years ago.
Since 1979, Elway's San Jose
State teams have compiled a
31-15-1 record. In 1981 the
Spartans went 9-3, won the
Pacific Coast Athletic Associa
tion championship and played
in the California Bowl San
Jose State's first bowl game
berth in 10years.
Last year Elway's team went
8-3, including three wins over
Pac-10 conference teams. One
of those teams was Stanford,
which fell to the Spartans 35-
31 in a game typical of an Elway
team exciting and high
scoring.
Elway is not the first, and
certainly not the last, college
coach to experience success.
But Elway, who coached Cal
State-North ridge to a 20-11-1
record in three years, has
achieved his status in away
that few have.
Whereas most college
coaches recruit players out of
high school, Elway, a two-time
PCAA Coach of the Year, uses
the pool of talent in junior col
leges to form his teams. Less
than 30 Spartan players came

straight to San Jose State from
high school.
For Elway and his program,
the philosophy of recruiting
junior college players to play
at San Jose State for two years
instead of wooing high school
seniors with the prospect of
four years in San Jose has paid
off. A major reason Elway
scours the junior college
ranks is the fact that the
players whom Elway recruits
successfully are experienced
when they put on a Spartan
uniform.
"We started (recruiting
junior college players) five
years ago. They are two years
older and they've played 20
college football games," Elway
said in an interview Tuesday.
There's a maturity factor
there, and when they come in -
where we can we redshirt a
lot of them so they've got
three years to play two
(seasons). It gives you immedi
ate help and they're two years
older so that, dealt with prop
erly, they can affect your foot
ball team."
But experience is not the
only quality a prospective
Spartan must have. "We're
looking for a guy that has an
outstanding attitude and is
going to work to get a college
degree," Elway said.

Elway was quick to add the
Spartan- program welcomes
freshmen and that the success
junior college players
brought to San Jose State will
make it easier for Elway and
his staff to get more freshmen
playing in Spartan Stadium.
"We have also recruited

years.

freshmen and we have not
lowered our standards there,
Elway said. Now we're getting
more success recruiting
freshmen because our
credibility's better because
we've won football games."
Despite the local presence
of Stanford and UC-Berkeley,

San Jose State does not com
pete much with the two
schools for recruits. One rea
son is Elway's preference of
junior college players; an
other is that San Jose State
recruits almost exclusively in
California while Stanford and
Cal recruit on a national basis.
According to the Spartan
head coach, who is more
widely known as the father of
a certain Stanford quarter
back with the same last name,

recruiting determines 80 per
cent of a coach's success in
college football.
"It doesn't make any differ
ence how great a coach you
are if you're not on a par with
people you play," he said.
Largely due to his unor
thodox method of basing his
program on the performance
of junior college players,
however, Elway and his pro
gram are indeed over par.
