# Eric Richardson vital to SJSU success

### DAVE DUTCHER 
In many ways, Eric Ric
hardson is representative of
the San Jose State football
program.
Richardson, who, like many
of his teammates, transferred
to San Jose State from a junior
college, is the latest of many
great Spartan offensive
performers, and he will likely
be taken high in the profes
sional draft.
Richardson, indeed, has
represented the Spartans
well.

The 6-foot-2 Novato, Cali
fornia native turned in San
Jose State's 10th best receiv
ing numbers after 1982, his
first season. Richardson
caught 40 passes for 590 yards
and four touchdowns. He
compiled these statistics
despite being overshadowed
by another outstanding
receiver, Tim Kearse.
But Kearse, who Stanford
followers remember well from
his stellar performance (163
yards receiving and one
touchdown pass) against the

Cardinal last season, has
graduated. Richardson now
has the stage to himself.
Many have been on that
stage before. Kearse, Steve
Clarkson, Steve De√üerg, Rick
Kane, Ed Luther, Vic
Rakhshani and Gerald Willhite
are some of the offensive stan
douts who have preceded Ric
hardson, who will probably
capture his share of the pro
fessional limelight.
"He's a great receiver, as
good a receiver as there is in
the country," San Jose State

coach Jack Elway said at a
press conference Tuesday.
"He's got size, speed, hands,
is a real competitor and runs
well after he catches the ball."
Richardson, a senior envi
ronmental sciences major,
refined his talents at Mon
terey Peninsula College
before transferring to San
Jose State. He was one of last
year's prize recruits for El
way, who builds teams largely
through junior college trans
fers. This season, the Spartans
added 25 junior college prod
ucts to their roster.
At Monterey, Richardson
was among the national elite
of receivers. He tallied 1236
yards and 11 touchdowns
through his 63 receptions as a
conference most valuable
player and all-state selection
his sophomore year.
Monterey was the first step
to excellence for Richardson.
"When I came out of high
school, I wasn't highly
recruited," Richardson said in
a telephone interview Tues
day. "I needed a place that
threw the ball. Monterey did
and so does San Jose State."
Richardson was named to
the second team all-Pacific
Coast Athletic Association
(PCAA) squad in 1982, while
Kearse was a first-team
choice.
Richardson leads the Spar
tans in receptions, receiving
yards, yards per catch and

touchdown catches. He will
move into San Jose State's
career top 10 in receiving with
a productive performance
today. According to Elway,
Richardson has developed
into a team leader.
Richardson believes San
Jose State can improve on last
season's finish. That will be a
tall order: The Spartans
compiled an 8-3 record, com
ing in third in the PCAA.
Yet Richardson said San
Jose State has benefited from
the departure of stars like
Clarkson and Kearse.
"There's more enthusiasm
this year and better at
titudes," Richardson said.
"There's more of a team atti
tude and a better atmosphere.
If you don't have these
(individual-star) type of
people everyone does their
job."
Another Spartan who has
done his job is senior halfback
Bobby Johnson, another
transfer from Monterey
Peninsula College. Johnson,
who had a shoulder injury
and rushed for only 29 yards
in a 30-9 loss to UC-Berkeley
last week, demonstrated his
potential with over 90 yards in
the Spartans' 31-26 season
opening win over Nevada-Las
Vegas.
"Against Cal, Bobby
Johnson did not run like
Bobby Johnson can run," El


RECEIVER ON THE LOOSE: San Jose State wide receiver Eric Richardson beats a Cal defensive
back for a reception in a game last season. Richardson, a senior, leads the Spartans in four
receiving categories and will enter San Jose State's top ten in receiving yardage with a big game
today.
