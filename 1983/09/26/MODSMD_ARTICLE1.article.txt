# Shockley draws student protest
## 
### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
Nobel laureate William Shockley
came under heavy tire tor his
theories on genetic inferiority as
dozens of students protested a
speech he delivered to freshmen
here Friday, prompting apologies
from University administrators.
The Black Students Union and the
African Students Association, which
organized the protest, objected to
the scheduling of the speech during
freshman orientation.
Rhonda Trotter, president ot the
BSU, termed the timing of the
speech ''insensitive'' and
"inappropriate."
The furor over Shockley's pre
sence stems from his views on
genetic intelligence and dysgenics,
a belief that the quality of human
race is decreasing due to the
"excessive reproduction of the
genetically disadvantaged."
Shockley has also advocated a

program called the Voluntary
Sterilization Bonus Plan, which
would pay $1000 per IQ point below
100 to any person agreeing to be
sterilized.
Shockley's speech here focused
on his work with transistors, for
which lie won a Nobel Prize in 1956.
But Shockley reaffirmed his confi
dence in his genetic views.
"No one has convinced me in l()
years that there is anything wrong
with this program," he said before
his speech.
Although they find his beliefs
"more than |ust < controversial" and
"advocating genocide," the protest
ing groups objected more to the of
fice of Residential Education's
scheduling of Shockley's speech
than to his views or his presence on
campus.
"We are talking about a depart
ment of the University that claims it
is promoting cultural diversity,"
Trotter said. "(Shockley's pres

ence) is a direct contradication. If
another group had invited him, we
would not have dealt with him
Asst. Dean of Res. Ed. Alice Sup
ton, organizer of the speeches,
took full responsibility for the
misunderstanding.
"I really regret, apologize lhat
people feel insulted and that this
has divided the community,' she
said. "Obviously I did not realize
the extent and depth ot teeling that
the choice would create.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, in his welcoming speech to
the freshmen, echoed Supton s
apologies.
"We gravely underestimated the
depth of personal feeling held b\
many about one of the Nobel
laureates," he said. |"o those so of
fended, I apologize for the discom
fort we did not intend."
Apologies, however, were not
the only type of responses around
campus. Outside Kresge before the

speech, a peaceful demonstration
was held featuring leaflets and Tigris
saying,"Shoe kle\ Hitler of the
'80s" and "Stick to Iran ' tors not
to geno( ide.
In addition to the pre-speech
rally, the protesters simultaneousK
held a forum featuring four Stan
ford staff members simultaneousK

ternative to Shocklev's speech
hach of the speakers was criti'.ai
of the University's decision to in
elude Shockley in the orientation
program and of Shockley's views in
general.
"Shockley has hurt you, said
Asst. Dean of studeni Affairs Ron
Hudson. "People like him have
defined youi education possibili
ties, kept your numbers down, and
yes, that has hurt you."
While the rest of the University
was responding strongly to his
