# Arms treaties promote security, according to University expert
## 
### 
Coit Blacker, associate
director of the Stanford Center
for International Security and
Arms Control, came to Stan
ford in 1977 after earning a
Ph.D. in international politics
from the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy at Tufts
University.
A leading authority on So
viet military policy and arma
ments, he is the author of a
number of books and articles
on the subject. Some of his
most recent work appears in a
new book, After Brezhnev:
Sources of Soviet Conduct in
the 1980s.
The opinions Blacker offers
in this interview are his only
and do not necessarily reflect
those of the Stanford Center
for International Security and
Arms Control.
Q: What do you think of the
contention that "there exist no
successful examples of arms
control agreements?"
A: I just don't agree.
Q: But if the Soviets continue
to expand their armed forces—as
you contend in After Brezhnev—
how can arms control agree
ments be reached?
A: There are ways for the
two sides to manage the com
petition in armaments in ways
that either do not increase the
probability of war or that ac
tually decrease the probability
of war.

The best of all possible
worlds would be a process by
which the United States and
the Soviet Union agreed
bilaterally to reduce arma
ments. In the absence of that, I
would argue that there is still
a future for arms control.
Even if both sides continue
to acquire weapons, there is a
role for arms control—because
it matters greatly which weap
ons systems we procure.
There are some systems that
are more destabilizing than
others.
Q: Do you think that earlier
bilateral agreements, such as
the Limited Test Ban Treaty and
the Non-Proliferation Treaty,
were seriously regarded by the
Soviets?
A: Yes I do, very seriously.
Q: Do you think that, in
practice, such agreements are
glossed over or abandoned
when they interfere with Soviet
national objectives?
A: No, they're not. I think
that the Soviet Union is a more
reliable treaty partner than is
sometimes alleged in the
United States.
On the other hand, the
Soviets will do everything they
are allowed to do, under the
terms of an agreement — down
to the last cross of a "t" and
the last dot of an "i."
Q: What about charges that
Soviets don't hold up their end

of agreements?
A: That is simply not true
There is no evidence that
know of that the Soviets hav<
ever violated the Limited Tes
Ban Treaty or the Non
Proliferation Treaty.

The problem (with elements
of the SALT I accord) was thai
the wording was so vague thai
the Soviets were able to ex
ploit the loophole of Ihe
treaty, which was so large that
the you could drive an ICBM
through it.
Q: Would you argue that the
Soviets could always find
loopholes and therefore never
adhere to an agreement?
A: No. I would argue thai it
makes it imperative thai any
agreement that you- s*v,«> vjwW

them be as specific and
detailed as possible, and that
there be a mechanism by
which, if you have questions
about compliance, you can
bring it to their attention.
That's why we have the
Standing Consultative Com
mission (SCC), which was or

ganized in the wake of SALT I
(to assure bilateral com
pliance).
On every occasion when
the United States has brought
an issue before the SCC . . .
the issue has been resolved to
the satisfaction of the Ameri
can government.
That is a terribly important
point. It is something many
people are unaware of when
they claim that the Soviets
have violated these agree
ments.
