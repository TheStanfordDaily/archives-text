## Mosher pushes book, repeats claims 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Senior staff writer 
Steven Mosher, the doctoral student who was expelled from
the anthropology program here last February, reiterated his alle
gations against the University Friday while promoting his new
book, Broken Earth: The Rural Chinese.
During a sometimes tense two-hour question-and-answer ses
sion at Kepler's Bookstore in Menlo Park, Mosher restated his
claims that the University unjustly terminated his doctoral candi
dacy under pressure from the Chinese government.
"Peking asked for my head," said Mosher in an interview with
The Daily. He said that the Chinese government had made "a
number of vicious allegations" against him, and had, through
communications with other scholars, informed Stanford that
"unless Steven Mosher is dealt with, the scholar exchange prog
ram will suffer."
Mosher also told The Daily that Stanford has told him he could
apply to transfer to another department within the University. He
said that "it didn't make sense" to him, and he jokingly suggested
that the University would like to see him change his course of
study to medieval history or Celtic studies. Mosher said he will
decline the offer.
Mosher, who speaks Mandarin and Cantonese, was one of the
first social scientists to be admitted to China as part of the
liberalized exchange program initiated in the late 19705. He spent
nine months in 1979 and 1980 observing life in a rural commune in
China's Guangdong Province, where he gathered an unusual
collection of local police and government documents.
"All doors were opened wide to me," Mosher told the
bookstore audience. He said that the local officers were com
manded by Peking to make all resources available to him.
According to Mosher, the Chinese government did not ap
prove of the discoveries he was making in the commune.
In June 1980, Mosher appealed for an extension of his visa, but
was turned down by the government. He returned to Taiwan,
where, before his stay in China, he had worked on his doctoral
thesis for Stanford. He published an article in a major Taiwanese
magazine based on his research in China, in which he claimed
that China's radical birth control program involved forced abor
tion and infanticide.
He explained to an attentive audience Friday how Chinese
women were often coerced into having abortions as late as nine
months into their terms when the birth of the baby would place a
family over the government limit of one child. He also explained
how female babies were sometimes killed or left to die because,
unlike their male counterparts, they could not work to support
their parents.
The parents would, according to Mosher, "sacrifice the baby
girl's life for their own."
Peking banned all further research in China by American scho
lars shortly after Mosher left the country. Chinese government
officials made allegations that Mosher had acted unethically and
illegally while in their country. Among the list of charges were
spying, smuggling and immoral conduct with a woman.
Mosher maintains that he did nothing unethical or illegal. He
claims officials in Peking made their allegations because they are
attempting to undo the "colossal blunder" they committed when
they allowed Western researchers into the country.
Mosher called the Chinese actions a "recovery by the Chinese
bureaucracy after their fumble in 1979 Iwhen it allowed western
researchers to study China's social problems]."
The public explanation given by the University for Mosher's
dismissal was that Mosher had engaged in "illegal and seriously
unethical conduct" while in China. The precise reasons for

Mosher's dismissal are, however, contained in a 47-page confi
dential investigative report compiled by an Anthropology De
partment committee.
It was on the basis of this report that the department voted
11 to 0 to expell Mosher from the doctoral program, but the
department has refused to release the report to the public on the
grounds that it contains information that would be injurious to
third parties.
Mosher has also declined to release his copy of the report, and
is on record as having stated that the report contains information
that would endanger innocent persons.
Mosher described the report Friday as merely "a compendium
of all allegations made so far." He also said that the report was a
"cover-up" by Stanford, and that, if it is to be released, it will have
to be the University's responsibility to do so.
"I am not going to be responsible for releasing a report that
libels myself," Mosher said. When pressed by several members
of his audience, Mosher added that he would sue the University
for libel if it released the report.
Mosher told The Daily that before he had published his con
troversial article in Taiwan, Stanford had ignored Chinese allega
tions against him. But, according to Mosher, the University took a
second look at the allegations after he published his article.
Mosher said, "The second time, they [the anthropology faculty
members] found them [the allegations! believable."
Mosher told his audience that there was no doubt in his mind
that he was expelled "for publishing the article on birth control
[in China]."
Norman Wessells, dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences at Stanford, was not available for comment, but in the past
he has denied Mosher's contention that he was dismissed for
publishing the article in Taiwan.

was turned down by the government. He returned to Taiwan,
where, before his stay in China, he had worked on his doctoral
thesis for Stanford. He published an article in a major Taiwanese
magazine based on his research in China, in which he claimed
that China's radical birth control program involved forced abor
tion and infanticide.
He explained to an attentive audience Friday how Chinese
women were often coerced into having abortions as late as nine
months into their terms when the birth of the baby would place a
family over the government limit of one child. He also explained
how female babies were sometimes killed or left to die because,
unlike their male counterparts, they could not work to support
their parents.
The parents would, according to Mosher, "sacrifice the baby
girl's life for their own."
Peking banned all further research in China by American scho
lars shortly after Mosher left the country. Chinese government
officials made allegations that Mosher had acted unethically and
illegally while in their country. Among the list of charges were
spying, smuggling and immoral conduct with a woman.
Mosher maintains that he did nothing unethical or illegal. He
claims officials in Peking made their allegations because they are
attempting to undo the "colossal blunder" they committed when
they allowed Western researchers into the country.
Mosher called the Chinese actions a "recovery by the Chinese
bureaucracy after their fumble in 1979 Iwhen it allowed western
researchers to study China's social problems]."
The public explanation given by the University for Mosher's
dismissal was that Mosher had engaged in "illegal and seriously
unethical conduct" while in China. The precise reasons for

Mosher's dismissal are, however, contained in a 47-page confi
dential investigative report compiled by an Anthropology De
partment committee.
It was on the basis of this report that the department voted
11 to 0 to expell Mosher from the doctoral program, but the
department has refused to release the report to the public on the
grounds that it contains information that would be injurious to
third parties.
Mosher has also declined to release his copy of the report, and
is on record as having stated that the report contains information
that would endanger innocent persons.
Mosher described the report Friday as merely "a compendium
of all allegations made so far." He also said that the report was a
"cover-up" by Stanford, and that, if it is to be released, it will have
to be the University's responsibility to do so.
"I am not going to be responsible for releasing a report that
libels myself," Mosher said. When pressed by several members
of his audience, Mosher added that he would sue the University
for libel if it released the report.
Mosher told The Daily that before he had published his con
troversial article in Taiwan, Stanford had ignored Chinese allega
tions against him. But, according to Mosher, the University took a
second look at the allegations after he published his article.
Mosher said, "The second time, they [the anthropology faculty
members] found them [the allegations! believable."
Mosher told his audience that there was no doubt in his mind
that he was expelled "for publishing the article on birth control
[in China]."
Norman Wessells, dean of the School of Humanities and Sci
ences at Stanford, was not available for comment, but in the past
he has denied Mosher's contention that he was dismissed for
publishing the article in Taiwan.
