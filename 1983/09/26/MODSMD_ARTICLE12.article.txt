# Diversity marks class of '87
## 
### HARA LEVY Staff Writer 
The largest number of
freshman applicants ever
has produced the most
diverse class to enter Stan
ford yet, according to Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy.
Approximately 1513
freshman entered Stanford
this fall, bringing their
overall accomplishments
and qualities as well as
stereos, typewriters and
dictionaries to the Farm.
There were 14,522 ap
plicants for the class of
1987, an increase of 5 per
cent over last year.
Stanford also gains 139
transfer students this year.
In his welcoming address
to the freshman class on
Thursday, Kennedy said,
"Diversity does not just
happen at a place like Stan
ford. It is sought out,
courted, treasured. We
believe that it is a cor
nerstone of the experience
you will have here."
Kennedy stressed that
the freshmen should
actively exploit the diver
sity within the undergradu
ate student body and in the
surrounding graduate and
professional schools. Ken
nedy reminded the fresh
men that each of them is a

"part of a student body
with diverse aims."
The class of '87 certainlv
fits Kennedy's billing: its
members hail from every
state except Delaware and
from several dozen foreign
countries.
Forty-two percent at
tended high school in Cali
fornia. After California, the
states with the largest num
bers of enrolling freshman
are Washington, New
York, Texas, Massachu
setts, Colorado, Oregon
and Connecticut.
Among those admitted
and enrolling in this year's
freshman class, 56 percent
are men and 44 percent are
women; 66 percent at
tended a public high school
while 34 percent attended
either a parochial or an in
dependent school.
Nine percent of the class
is black, nine percent is
Chicano and one percent
is Native American.
Proportionally, Stanford
has "far more members of
these minorities than are
enrolled even by the great
public institutions with
which we cooperate and,
sometimes, compete," Ken
nedy said.
Compared to previous
years, interest in the social
sciences and humanities

has increased among in
coming Stanford freshmen.
But, three out of five mem
bers of the class of '87 say
their first choice is either
engineering, natural
sciences, applied science
or mathematics.
An additional 14 percent
(down 3 percent from last
year) indicated interest in
pursuing a career in
medicine.
Freshman interests have
changed slightly over the
years. For the first class to
enter Stanford, English was
the most popular major,
followed by mechanical en
gineering, history and civil
engineering.
Then, as now, the object
of the University, as stated
in its charter, is "to qualify
students for personal suc
cess and direct usefulness
in life."
In keeping with this
tradition, Kennedy sug
gested students consider
the obligations associated
with their interests and tali
ents.
"In this day and age,
when economic cir
cumstances often dictate
too much concern over
one's future," he said, "it is
sometimes reassuring to
remember that we all have
an agenda of social respon
sibility."
