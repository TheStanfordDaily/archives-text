### BRYCE LEE 
More than 1500 people
turned out on campus Sep
tember 17 for an auction of
dozens of unclaimed items
recovered from convicted
"jogging burglar" Robert
O'Connor, who was arrested
by Stanford police last Novem
ber.
Most of the people who at
tended the auction were
curious bargain hunters who
purchased everything from
guns, coins and jewelry to a
$450 box of X-rated films. A
$600 Hopi Indian basket and a

rare 1799 coin that went for
$850 were among the highest
priced items.
The items at the auction
were the remaining unclaimed
loot from O'Connor's string
of burglaries in affluent
neighborhoods in the area.
At day's end, more than
$60,000 worth of merchandise
had been sold.
According to Pat Binns, of
fice manager for Neale and
Sons, the company that ran
the auction, the majority of
the proceeds will go toward
paying storage bills incurred

by Stanford police. Thr
remainder will provide com
pensation to victims with un
recovered claims.
O'Connor pleaded guilty to
21 counts of burglary after his
arrest by Stanford police last
November.
After O'Connor's arrest,
police obtained a search war
rant for the La Honda home of
his girlfriend Nancy Burl.
They recovered over $1.5 mil
lion worth of property, stolen
earlier by O'Connor, at her
residence and in several
storage lockers.
