## The 						Stanford Daily Editor's introduction 
### 
As incoming editor of The Daily, I have been
asked by friends, family and University admi
nistrators, "What are you going to do differ
ently this year?"
The first few times I heard the question. I
stuttered a bit and said, "Oh, nothing major,
but lots of little things that probably wouldn't
interest you."
Most people were as unsatisfied with that
answer as I was. So I started giving them the
specifics: Sports is going to run every day; the
box on the front page is going to be called
Update instead of World News; the headlines
on the front page are going to be bolder; and
so on.
But my intuition was right. No one was fas
cinated by the "in-house" changes.
The interrogators wanted to hear something
more philosophical — something they could
relate to.
So I thought in general terms and decided to
talk about the atmosphere I hope to cultivate in
the office. "I hope to convey to the other
editors, reporters and new staffers that The
Daily is a serious, professional organization,
but also a fun one," I would say.
That response provoked more smiles and
understanding glances than others, but I was
never thoroughly pleased with "What I am
going to do differently this year."
Answering the oft-asked question about my
plans is problematic in the same way that fin
ding the right words — or any words at all — to
fill this space is difficult.

The tradition of the new editor putting his
or her thoughts on the opinions page started

in 1975. Times were apparently not so good for
the paper then.
The incoming editor let the community know
that The Daily's finances were in shambles, and
went on to say, "Just as seriously, our editorial
product has been widely assailed as dull, mis
leading and inaccurate, with some justification.
"The Daily's reputation as one of the
country's best college newspapers has been all
but wiped out."
Fortunately, the editors' perspectives since
then have been more upbeat. And they've also
been similar.
Daily editors of the last eight years have
espoused objectives and principles that
should, and most likely will, always pilot the
paper. I am not embarrassed to say that I plan
to continue their course.
At The Daily, we aim for objective, accurate
and complete coverage of the University,
hoping to entertain and impress the reader.
Our ears and eyes are open to make sure we
aren't missing something you should know
about; tips from you, who don't spend several
hours a day in the Daily office, are always more
than welcome.
To stimulate thought and discussion, we pro
vide this page. A variety of opinions will be
printed in an attempt to portray the general
sentiments of the community.
We are here to inform you. But just as im
portantly, we also do our best to teach profes
sions: journalism, photography, graphic arts
and business.
Informing and training may at times tug on
each other, but they are the two objectives
that guide The Daily's existence.
