## Peace through force won't work in Lebanon 
### 
The Reagan administration in
variably regards left-wing revolu
tions anywhere in the world as the
work of the Soviets and their
agents. This approach had unfor
tunate consequences in mid-
September when U.S. warships off
Lebanon began firing on villages in
the Shouf mountains southeast of
Beirut. The European governments
whose troops help to make up the
peacekeeping forces in Lebanon
were critical of the U.S. escalation.
But as Reagan explained, "Our
Middle East policies must not be
permitted to fail in the face of
Soviet-sponsored aggression."
It's true that Syria supports the
Druze and Moslems fighting in the
Shouf mountains. And the Soviet
Union, in turn, supplies Syria with
most of its weapons. But the Soviets
have little influence on Syria, which
has its own agenda in the Middle
East and pays for its arms with large
grants from Saudi Arabia.
Lebanon's civil war is no more a
result of Soviet aggression than is
the revolution in El Salvador. In
both countries, longstanding in
justices and antagonisms have
repeatedly flared into violence â€” in
tensified by waves of slaughter and
retribution. In both countries, un
fortunately, the United States is
backing the wrong side.
Just a year ago Israeli-backed
Phalangist militiamen rampaged
through two refugee camps in
Beirut, murdering hundreds of
defenseless Palestinians. U.S. mili
tary forces today are supporting
these same Phalangists against the
Druze and other Moslems in the
Shouf mountains.
When the Israelis invaded
Lebanon in 1982 they encouraged
the Phalangists to move into areas
long controlled by the Druze.
Before the invasion, Moslems and
Christians had managed to live more
or less peacefully for nearly a cen
tury. According to Jonathan Randal
of The Washington Post, Israeli of
ficers gave arms to both sides and
"warned each of them of the other's
intentions . . . indulging in that clas
sic imperial principle of divide and
rule." By the end of 1982, hundreds
of Druze and Christians had been
killed.
When the Israelis withdrew from
the Shouf, fresh fighting broke out
between the Druze and the Phalan
gists' Lebanese Forces, with the
Christian-dominated Lebanese army
joining the Phalangist side. The U.S.
Navy is shelling Druze positions, ac
cording to a White House spokes
man, "to make it more costly for
Syria and their surrogates." The
statement reflects a dangerous ig
norance of the situation in Lebanon.
Lebanese factions have struggled
for political dominance ever since
the country became independent in
1943. Although the Phalangists rep
resent only a minority of Christians
in Lebanon, the Israeli invasion of
1982 succeeded in forcing the selec
tion of their chief, Bashir Cemayel,
as president. Gemayel's forces had
not only massacred more than a
thousand Palestinians at Tal Zataar
in 1976 but had even murdered his
Christian rivals for the presidency,

along with their families, in 1978 and
1980. Gemayel's father, Pierre,
founded the Phalange after a visit to
the 1936 Olympics in Berlin where
he was inspired by the Nazis.
Now the United States is prop
ping up the government of Bashir's
brother, Amin, in hopes of making
Lebanon a reliable U.S. ally in the
Middle East. But'the* present go
vernment has no popular base.
Democratic elections have not been
held since the early seventies and
the Moslem majority has been sys
tematically denied fair representa
tion in the legislature.
Representation is based on religi
ous affiliation and there has been
no census since 1932.

In Lebanon, as in Central
America, the United
States is attempting to
shape the destiny of a
small, weak country
with military force.

American negotiators have con
sulted with Syria and Saudi Arabia,
but have made little effort to deal di
rectly with Gemayel's domestic op
ponents or to understand the
complex roots of Lebanon's civil
war. A Druze leader recently told a
Los Angeles Times correspondent
that " the Americans don't under
stand the real situation in Lebanon.
They see it as the Lebanese govern
ment fighting off foreign forces. But
the real situation is that there is an
unjust situation in Lebanon dating
back to independence. We are as
tonished at the U.S. naval shelling.
The U.S. is supporting a fascist go
vernment."
A similar complaint was made in
San Francisco on September 21 by
former Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, who accused the
Reagan administration of
"oversimplifying" the situation in
Lebanon. "The whole American
policy is based on illusions," he
said. "They believe that through use
of force they can bring about a new
political order in Lebanon."
As Rabin suggested, our massive
firepower is no substitution for pa
tient and legitimate efforts to cope
with that country's underlying
problems. In the name of support
ing the Lebanese government we
are in fact supporting a right-wing
minority faction that is feared by a
majority of Lebanese. In Lebanon,
as in Central America, the United
States is attempting to shape the
destiny of a small, weak country
through military force. Such an ap
proach guarantees that Lebanon's
suffering will only increase, and
risks the danger of ever-deepening
U.S. commitment. President Reagan
still seems to be seeking the victory
that eluded us in Vietnam. He won't
find it in Lebanon.
