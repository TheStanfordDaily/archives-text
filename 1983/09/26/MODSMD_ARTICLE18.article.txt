Rebholz defended
Melvyn Krauss wrote, in The
Stanford Daily of August 16, that
"when prejudices and hates are
indulged ... at the expense of
others, they should not be
tolerated." In the same column he
indulges in just such prejudice
when he asserts (contrary to fact)
that the bibliography of Prof.
Ronald Rebholz is "virtually
empty" and infers that this may
reflect "a skeptical attitude toward
the value of academic research"
on his part.
Your readers need to know that
Rebholz, a former Rhodes
Scholar, is the author of the stan
dard critical biography of the
Renaissance politician, courtier
and poet, Fulke Greville
(published by the Clarendon
Press at Oxford). He is the first
scholar to have gained full access
to Greville's papers at Warwick
Castle. This book, to anyone inter
ested in simple tallies, is easily the
equivalent of a dozen substantial
articles.
Rebholz is also editor of
the works of Wyatt (published by
Vale University Press). Wyatt is the
greatest, and by far the most diffi
cult of the earlier Tudor poets.
Rebholz has proved his
scholarly capacity at the most
advanced levels of his discipline.
He understands projects of great
complexity and scope. That they
are too few to suit Krauss
would be of no consequence if he
did not draw false inferences in
print.
We have signed no petitions
concerning the Hoover Institution
and, heretofore, have written
nothing related to the present
controversy. Our motives in
writing now are collegia!. We
cannot see how the open discus

sion for which Krauss calls is
furthered by his own unscholarly
insinuations about a colleague
who, after all, has undergone
precisely the kind of review to
which many members of the faculty
believe scholars at the Hoover
should be subject.

Parking hassles
I have just received the new
regulations for campus parking.
Aside from the considerable an
noyance of the increase to $100 for
an "A" permit (up from $70, up
from $40, up from zero) with no
noticeable increase in parking
space, I was dismayed to discover
two changes which will undoub
tedly make the parking situation
even more inconvenient.
First, and for me the most
troublesome, there is no longer
an acceptable way to obtain a
sticker for each of my cars. I live
some distance from Stanford and
my wife works even farther away.
We have two cars which we alter
nate using depending on the par
ticular needs of the day. Now I
have the choice of paying $200 for
parking or remembering to trans
fer a hanging tag from car to car.
Even with the Stanford honor
code it would seem unwise to
leave a hundred dollar tag hanging
in clear view. Thus even on hot
days one can no longer leave a
window ajar. It should also be
noted that one should not drive
with such a tag obstructing the
view, so it must be removed while
driving. All this inconvenient non
sense has been given to us for no
apparent reason. Perhaps a few
people have misused extra stickers

in the past, but does that mean we
should all be burdened with
garbage regulations?
The second change that would
seem counterproductive is to
force carpoolers to ride in their
carpool every day by allowing only
one hanging tag for carpool mem
bers and not allowing bumper
stickers. Even the most devoted
carpooler sometimes needs
his/her own car for the day. This
regulation will probably result in
the dissolution of many active car
pool groups when the intention
was probably to stop a few from
bending the rules.
When rules such as these are
made, it is usually a sign that the
regulators have begun to be more
concerned with the strict ad
herence to their regulations than
to the original problem. In this
case the problem is to allow the
Stanford community convenient
access to their places of work,
study and living. The new regula
tions will inconvenience the
majority of the community in the
attempt to stop a few from circum
venting the previous rules.

Employee relations
I believe that the Committee on
Parking and Transportation's
policy of charging some (not
SLAC) employees to park is at best
penny wise and dollar foolish. It is
a hardship to some and an irrita
tion to others that does nothing to
foster good employee relations. I
find it especially ironic in light of
numerous University cost saving
and energy conservation cam
paigns where those same
employees are asked to save Stan
ford money.
