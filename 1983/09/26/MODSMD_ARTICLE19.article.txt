## Oral surgery is a real pain 
### 
Nobody likes pain. Not even oral surgeons. Or so I
was told. Thus reassured, I gave my consent and aut
horization for a total stranger to remove my wisdom
teeth.
The consent form is slightly less reassuring. It in
forms you that "occasionally there are complications of
surgery, drugs and anesthetics including, but not lim
ited to: pain, infection, swelling, limitation of opening,
bleeding, bone spicules, residual bone fragments, dis
coloration, permanent numbness and tingling of the
lip, tongue, chin, gums, cheeks, bone and teeth, pain
and numbness and thrombophlebitis (inflammation of a
vein) from intravenous, inadvertant intra-arterial and
intramuscular injection, injury to and stiffening of the
neck and facial muscles, change in occlusion of tem
poromanidibular joint difficulty, injury to adjacent
teeth or restorations to other teeth or injuries to
other tissues, referred to pain to the ear, neck and
head, nausea and vomiting, allergic and other un
toward reactions to drugs and anesthetics, bone
fractures, bruises, delayed healing, sinus complica
tions and oral-antral and oral-nasal fistulas and
opening."
The only complication the form doesn't mention is
death. That's why it says "but not limited to."
Then, even if you survive the surgical procedure,
the drugs are bound to get you with "lack of aware
ness and coordination."

After surgery, one then stops at a pharmacy and
picks up the prescribed medication; drugs with names
longer than this column. And medicine must be taken at
particular times. Such as five hours after sleeping,
eight hours after eating solids and one hour before
drinking liquids. They never did quite explain to me
how to take medicine while one is choking on his own
blood.
Thus, I warn you, it will be very painful. Who do you
trust, me or the American Dental Association? After all,
it's the oral and maxillofacial surgeons who warn you
that: (1) All surgical procedures are accompanied by
post-operative discomfort; (2) Swelling is to be ex
pected after oral surgery, and (3) It is not unusual to
have persistent or intermittent bleeding after tooth ex
tractions.
There's no pain when one's wisdom teeth are
removed. No pain for the surgeon, that is. The worst
part is when the nurse smiles sweetly and asks in
nocently, "How do you feel?" Of course, your mouth
is numb and the best one can manage is a weak thumbs
down signal.
For me, the process of molar emancipation is over.
You should be so lucky.

(Mark Soble is a junior majoring in economics whc
recently had all four of his wisdom teeth removed.)
