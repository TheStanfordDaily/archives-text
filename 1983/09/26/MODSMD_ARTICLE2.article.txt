# Estelle Freedman wins long battle for tenure
## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
Estelle Freedman's lengthy battle
against alleged sex discrimination fi
nally ended in mid-September when
the associate history professor was
granted tenure.
University President Donald Ken
nedy conducted the tinal step in a
series of reviews that began in
March 1%2. He accepted the advi
sory board's recommendation that
Freedman be given tenure and an
nounced his decision to the Board
of Trustees Sept. 13.
Freedman said she was glad the
struggle was over and pointed out
that the administration's decision
had positive ramifications for re
search and teaching in the iield of
feminist studies.
"I would like to think that the
decision was taken as a sign by
other faculty that at some levels of
the administration there is support
for feminist scholarship," she said
in a recent Daily interview.
She cautioned, however, that al
though her appointment may en
courage feminist scholars, it does
not solve all the problems for
feminist studies.
"There will always be people who
do not believe that what women do
is valuable," she said.
Supporters of Freedman, both in
the Feminist Studies Program and in
the History Department, reacted to

the news with enthusiasm.
"Her getting tenure is absolutely
wonderful," said Assoc. Anthropol
ogy Prof. Jane Collier, an active
member of the Feminist Studies Pro
gram.
Collier praised Freedman's teach
ing ability and concluded that the
University has added a new and vi
tal member to thefeminst faculty."
History Prof. Carl Degler, an out
spoken supporter of Freedman,
also expressed his delight.
Degler indicated that the Adminis
tration's decision "suggests that the
internal review system is function
ing."
The advisory board, which con
sists of seven tenured professors
elected by the faculty, ruled on the
case Sept. 9.
Member Kenneth Arrow, an
economist and Nobel laureate, said
once the advisory board upheld
Provost Albert Hastorf's recom
mendation for tenure, Freedman
had virtually won the battle. He said
that while in theory Kennedy may
disagree with the board, he rarely
does so in practice.
Board member George Dekker,
an English professor here, said that
the group faced a difficult decicion,
as did committees at lower levels
who previously reviewed the con
troversial case.
"None of the decisions alone the
line in her case were easy," he said.
"We certainly in our discussions
recapitulated most of the view
points. It wasn't a simple decision.
There wasn't perfect unanimity."
Dekker pointed out, however,
that although the board faced a
tough decision, it completed it ob
jectively.
Industrial Engineering Prof. James
Adams also denied that outside pres
sure influenced the decision.
Freedman's fight for tenure
began when the Appointment
and Promotions Committee of

Humanities and Sciences un
animously voted against her ap
pointment in March 1982. Freedman
filed a grievance with Norman Wes
sells, dean of Humanities and
Sciences.
Wessells upheld the recom
mendation against tenure. But
Provost Albert Hastorf reversed the
decision in a surprise move this
summer, returning the case to regu
lar status and subject to approval by
the advisory board.
Freedman's case is the first in the
last decade to survive an appeal
beyond the dean's level. In the past,
four other candidates pressed their
cases, but none of them received a
provostial approval.
