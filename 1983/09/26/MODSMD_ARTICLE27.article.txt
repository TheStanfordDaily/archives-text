## Kennedy stresses diversity, responsibility to freshmen 
### 
In his annual welcome to incoming
freshmen, University President Donald
Kennedy stressed the diversity of the
University and the responsibilities
students here must take. The following
is the text of Kennedy's speech.

On behalf of the University,
I want to welcome each of you
to Stanford. This is a happy
time for you, for us, and for
the Dean of Admissions. For
some time now, Dean Fred has
been telling you that Stanford
is great; and he has been tel
ling us that you are the
greatest freshman class he has
ever admitted. Now, in fall, he
gets to prove to both groups
how right he was. It happens
every year.
Earlier today, under the
pretense of offering reas
surance, I had a little talk with
your parents. (This, too hap
pens every year; at noon I tell
the parents what good care
we're going to take of their off
spring, and in the evening
their offspring tell me how
little care they want or need.)
Actually, what I said at Parents
Convocation was something
like this: that Stanford is an
extraordinary place with a
great deal to offer; that how
much students take away from
it depends in large part on
how much they put in; and

that we expect a good deal of
independence of Stanford un
dergraduates. I assure you
that I said these things very
tactfully and very gently—but I
meant every word. It is just as
important that you should
hear this as that they should.
Why is that point worth
making? It is because you have
made a particular kind of col
lege choice. In the first place,
you decided to try a place that
would ask a lot of you, one
that is competitive in the sense
of having a highly selected stu
dent body and of declaring
that its expectations are high.
Second, you have chosen to
go to college in a university.
That choice does not follow
inevitably from the first.
There are selective liberal arts
colleges of superb quality,
and by and large they offer
substantially more guided
educational experiences than
does a university like Stan
ford. What advantages do we
offer by way of comparison?
Of Stanford's seven
schools, only three offer un

dergraduate degrees. Most of
you will find yourself enrolled
in the School of Humanities
and Sciences, which includes
the departments of the liberal
arts, the natural sciences and
social sciences: English and
philosophy and classics, his
tory and sociology and
economics, chemistry and
biology and physics. An in
creasing fraction of you —
nearly one-fifth, if the trend
continues — will find yourse
lves in the School of Engineer
ing. And a small number will
study geology, or petroleum
engineering, or one of the
otherdisciplinesthat makes up
Stanford's small but distin
guished School of Earth Sci
ences. In each of these
schools, you will find numbers
of other students who are pur
suing Master's or Ph.D. de
grees— for in addition to offer
ing undergraduate work, these
schools grant most of the ad
vanced degrees in particular to
scholarly disciplines that are
given at Stanford.
With the four other
schools, your contact will be
much less direct. These are
the so-called professional
schools, and their primary
business is the offering of
post-graduate degrees in par
ticular professional disci
plines: In the School of
Education, for example, you
will find some teachers in
training, as well as a number
of doctoral candidates who

are studying educational
policy, school finances and
government, and who will be
assuming positions of leader
ship in our public educational
system. Up at the other end of
the mall across the street is
the Law School, where about
600 prospective lawyers,
judges, or just plain
generalists are pursuing
degrees. Right next door is

the Gradaute School of Busi
ness, where an equivalent
number of MBA candidates
are slaving away. And way
over there, across Campus
Drive, is the Medical Center.
At any given time it has only
about 300 M.D. candidates,
but it looks huge. That is be
cause it is training interns and
residents and running a 660
bed hospital, in addition to

training post-doctoral fellow
and pre-doctoral scholars in
clinical work and in the basic
disciplines of biomedical re
search.
Your contact with these
other schools may or may not
be meaningful to you in your
undergraduate career. You
might have a law student as an
R.A. or as a T.A. in political
science —or you might not. You

might find, as one of my fresh
man advisees did three years
ago, that your interest in the
phi I osophy and practice of
education takes you to do an
independent study with a
member of the School of Edu
cation faculty — or you might
not. You might find yourself
taking a course in health
policy from a member of the

Business School faculty, or
you might not. You might even
reach the end of four years
here thinking that there really
wasn't a medical center at all —
that we just dreamed up its
existence to encourage false
hopes on the part of all of
those pre-medical students.
But I can assure you that it is
there, that a large number of
its faculty members advise un
dergraduates, that it con
tributes courses available to
undergradauate students, and
each year offers independent
research opportunites for
scores of undergraduates.
Going to college in a univer
sity thus means that you are
part of a student body with
diverse aims. For every one of
you, there is one of another
kind of student, who already
has a Bachelor's degree and
who has made an intense and
powerful commitment to some
more advanced form of learn
ing or scholarly work or pro
fessional preparation. They
are worth knowing, because
what they know and what they
believe could be important to
you.
Beyond them, the schools
represent an institutional
commitment on Stanford's
part that is different from that
of a college by itself. It is a
commitment to all of the

diverse realms of human
learning and understanding.
Stanford is one of the handful
of institutions in the United
States that is called a research
university, because it is com
mitted to the discovery of new
knowledge as well as the dis
semination of what is already
known. For the undergradu
ate, that is sometimes a source
of frustration. It means that
faculty members are com
mitted not only to teaching but
to other work as well.
Through the years here I have
often heard it said that Stan
ford should pay more atten
tion to teaching and less to
research and the appointment
of faculty, and that quality at
one of these things often
means a lack of ability at the
other. This last premise is, in
my experience, terribly
wrong. Among the best un
dergraduate teachers in this
university — and you are all
scheduled to see some of them
very soon — are some of its
leading scholars. My own ex
perience here over 23 years
has included seven years as a
department chairmen and
four years in charge of a
major interdepartmental un
dergraduate program, and
I've had more occasion than
most to worry about the com
patibility of good teaching and
good research. Though you
will no doubt encounter some
exceptions, I can assure you
that they go together more of
ten than not. I can also assure
you that Stanford is paying

close attention to teaching in
appointment and promotions,
and to continued improve
ment of the quality of under
graduate instruction
wherever we can. . . .
Still, the duality of a univer
sity's commitment does
sometimes lead to frustration
on the part of our under
graduates, who understand
ably want the teaching role to
be paramount and want prior
claim on the time and attention
of this faculty. Yet the involve
ment of the Stanford faculty
with matters at the frontiers of
knowledge offers great
benefits of a different kind. It
makes this an environment of
great intellectual richness,
and for the students who care
to seek it out, it provides a
vast array of opportunities,
for stretching their own ca
pacities through independent
work and through the
breadth of course offerings
available here.
That richness is related to
another quality of your new
environment: its diversity. At
tracted by the wide range of
fields and activities Stanford
offers, and by its excellence,
is an equally wide range of
people. We are a richly inter
national place; we have stu
dents from all corners of the
globe, with all sorts of beliefs
and backgrounds, and every
intellectual interest you can
think of. They — or ratheryou -
are also from all walks of life,
of all possible shades, and
with all conceivable kinds of

personal history. Each of you
probably thinks that in your
own background there is
something so wonderful and
fortunate, or so shameful and
unfair that it has no parallel in
anyone else's. I assure you
that you're wrong.
Now diversity does not just
happen at a place like Stan
ford. It is sought out, courted,
treasured. We believe it is a
cornerstone of the experi
ence you will have here. As
students in a university col
lege, you can be exposed to
the full range of a university's
intellectual mission and to all
the different advanced stu
dents who participate in it. As
students in an institution that
believes in equality, you will
also find that we have com
mitted substantial institutional
resources to guaranteeing
diversity in our undergradu
ate population. That has been
successful: You are not only
the best class we've ever had,
but the most diverse. For ex
ample, you include 9 percent
blacks, 9 percent hispanics
and 1 percent American In
dians. . . .
The kinds of diversity I have
mentioned and that you ex
hibit are made possible in part
by financial aid policies that
we have insisted upon retain
ing despite hard economic
times for institutions like this
one. We have done so be
cause we believe so strongly
in the value of the objective.
The differences
represented around you in

this auditorium and in the
campus beyond it represent
opportunities. These oppor
tunties will do you no good,
however, if you treat them
passively. It is easy to tolerate
differences, and it is also not
worth much. It is much harder
to explore and understand
them, but the personal
growth that will afford you is
truly worthwhile. Please try to
find the energy and courage
to search actively.
I also want to urge your
commitment to two other
values. The first is that univer
sities are devoted to the life of
the mind, and intellectual
purposes are central to them.
I hope you will note that I said
intellectual, not academic. We
promote substantial and
serious efforts in the class
room, and I think most of you
will respond well to that. But I
have in mind something
beyond just grades and
course taking. Most of the

rest of us are here because
we celebrate the values of
knowing and understanding
and because we realize that
these values create joy as well
as power. Many different
forms of commitment to them
are possible: artistic, literary,
scientific. All are charac
terized by intensity and con
tinuity of involvement,
bridging from the formal aca
demic program to the rest of
one's life. . . .
Finally, I hope you will
reflect from time to time on
the personal obligations you
are building. I'm not talking
about the fact that you got in
here and some other people
didn't, or about the fact that
you may have some form of
financial aid. These things
reflect our assessment of your
abilities and accomplishments.
But accomplishments and abil
ities also generate obligations.
You will be, throughout your

lives, in a better position to do
things for your fellow human
beings than most people. That
is a serious matter. In this day
and age, when economic cir
cumstances often dictate too
much concern over one's own
future, it is sometimes actually
reassuring that we all have an
agenda of social responsibil
ity. Think from time to time
about the form in which you
might choose to deliver on
your responsibility, how you
might equip yourselves to dis
charge it most effectively, how
much satisfaction various
forms of public service might
afford you.
Three months less than four
years from now, I will be bid
ding you farewell. The time
will pass quickly for you — and
alas, even more quickly for
me. On that day, I hope you
will think first of how much
you have gained and grown
and quickly thereafter, about
how much you have to offer.

part of a student body with
diverse aims. For every one of
you, there is one of another
kind of student, who already
has a Bachelor's degree and
who has made an intense and
powerful commitment to some
more advanced form of learn
ing or scholarly work or pro
fessional preparation. They
are worth knowing, because
what they know and what they
believe could be important to
you.
Beyond them, the schools
represent an institutional
commitment on Stanford's
part that is different from that
of a college by itself. It is a
commitment to all of the

diverse realms of human
learning and understanding.
Stanford is one of the handful
of institutions in the United
States that is called a research
university, because it is com
mitted to the discovery of new
knowledge as well as the dis
semination of what is already
known. For the undergradu
ate, that is sometimes a source
of frustration. It means that
faculty members are com
mitted not only to teaching but
to other work as well.
Through the years here I have
often heard it said that Stan
ford should pay more atten
tion to teaching and less to
research and the appointment
of faculty, and that quality at
one of these things often
means a lack of ability at the
other. This last premise is, in
my experience, terribly
wrong. Among the best un
dergraduate teachers in this
university — and you are all
scheduled to see some of them
very soon — are some of its
leading scholars. My own ex
perience here over 23 years
has included seven years as a
department chairmen and
four years in charge of a
major interdepartmental un
dergraduate program, and
I've had more occasion than
most to worry about the com
patibility of good teaching and
good research. Though you
will no doubt encounter some
exceptions, I can assure you
that they go together more of
ten than not. I can also assure
you that Stanford is paying

close attention to teaching in
appointment and promotions,
and to continued improve
ment of the quality of under
graduate instruction
wherever we can. . . .
Still, the duality of a univer
sity's commitment does
sometimes lead to frustration
on the part of our under
graduates, who understand
ably want the teaching role to
be paramount and want prior
claim on the time and attention
of this faculty. Yet the involve
ment of the Stanford faculty
with matters at the frontiers of
knowledge offers great
benefits of a different kind. It
makes this an environment of
great intellectual richness,
and for the students who care
to seek it out, it provides a
vast array of opportunities,
for stretching their own ca
pacities through independent
work and through the
breadth of course offerings
available here.
That richness is related to
another quality of your new
environment: its diversity. At
tracted by the wide range of
fields and activities Stanford
offers, and by its excellence,
is an equally wide range of
people. We are a richly inter
national place; we have stu
dents from all corners of the
globe, with all sorts of beliefs
and backgrounds, and every
intellectual interest you can
think of. They — or ratheryou -
are also from all walks of life,
of all possible shades, and
with all conceivable kinds of

personal history. Each of you
probably thinks that in your
own background there is
something so wonderful and
fortunate, or so shameful and
unfair that it has no parallel in
anyone else's. I assure you
that you're wrong.
Now diversity does not just
happen at a place like Stan
ford. It is sought out, courted,
treasured. We believe it is a
cornerstone of the experi
ence you will have here. As
students in a university col
lege, you can be exposed to
the full range of a university's
intellectual mission and to all
the different advanced stu
dents who participate in it. As
students in an institution that
believes in equality, you will
also find that we have com
mitted substantial institutional
resources to guaranteeing
diversity in our undergradu
ate population. That has been
successful: You are not only
the best class we've ever had,
but the most diverse. For ex
ample, you include 9 percent
blacks, 9 percent hispanics
and 1 percent American In
dians. . . .
The kinds of diversity I have
mentioned and that you ex
hibit are made possible in part
by financial aid policies that
we have insisted upon retain
ing despite hard economic
times for institutions like this
one. We have done so be
cause we believe so strongly
in the value of the objective.
The differences
represented around you in

this auditorium and in the
campus beyond it represent
opportunities. These oppor
tunties will do you no good,
however, if you treat them
passively. It is easy to tolerate
differences, and it is also not
worth much. It is much harder
to explore and understand
them, but the personal
growth that will afford you is
truly worthwhile. Please try to
find the energy and courage
to search actively.
I also want to urge your
commitment to two other
values. The first is that univer
sities are devoted to the life of
the mind, and intellectual
purposes are central to them.
I hope you will note that I said
intellectual, not academic. We
promote substantial and
serious efforts in the class
room, and I think most of you
will respond well to that. But I
have in mind something
beyond just grades and
course taking. Most of the

rest of us are here because
we celebrate the values of
knowing and understanding
and because we realize that
these values create joy as well
as power. Many different
forms of commitment to them
are possible: artistic, literary,
scientific. All are charac
terized by intensity and con
tinuity of involvement,
bridging from the formal aca
demic program to the rest of
one's life. . . .
Finally, I hope you will
reflect from time to time on
the personal obligations you
are building. I'm not talking
about the fact that you got in
here and some other people
didn't, or about the fact that
you may have some form of
financial aid. These things
reflect our assessment of your
abilities and accomplishments.
But accomplishments and abil
ities also generate obligations.
You will be, throughout your

lives, in a better position to do
things for your fellow human
beings than most people. That
is a serious matter. In this day
and age, when economic cir
cumstances often dictate too
much concern over one's own
future, it is sometimes actually
reassuring that we all have an
agenda of social responsibil
ity. Think from time to time
about the form in which you
might choose to deliver on
your responsibility, how you
might equip yourselves to dis
charge it most effectively, how
much satisfaction various
forms of public service might
afford you.
Three months less than four
years from now, I will be bid
ding you farewell. The time
will pass quickly for you — and
alas, even more quickly for
me. On that day, I hope you
will think first of how much
you have gained and grown
and quickly thereafter, about
how much you have to offer.
In his annual welcome to incoming
freshmen, University President Donald
Kennedy stressed the diversity of the
University and the responsibilities
students here must take. The following
is the text of Kennedy's speech.

On behalf of the University,
I want to welcome each of you
to Stanford. This is a happy
time for you, for us, and for
the Dean of Admissions. For
some time now, Dean Fred has
been telling you that Stanford
is great; and he has been tel
ling us that you are the
greatest freshman class he has
ever admitted. Now, in fall, he
gets to prove to both groups
how right he was. It happens
every year.
Earlier today, under the
pretense of offering reas
surance, I had a little talk with
your parents. (This, too hap
pens every year; at noon I tell
the parents what good care
we're going to take of their off
spring, and in the evening
their offspring tell me how
little care they want or need.)
Actually, what I said at Parents
Convocation was something
like this: that Stanford is an
extraordinary place with a
great deal to offer; that how
much students take away from
it depends in large part on
how much they put in; and

that we expect a good deal of
independence of Stanford un
dergraduates. I assure you
that I said these things very
tactfully and very gently—but I
meant every word. It is just as
important that you should
hear this as that they should.
Why is that point worth
making? It is because you have
made a particular kind of col
lege choice. In the first place,
you decided to try a place that
would ask a lot of you, one
that is competitive in the sense
of having a highly selected stu
dent body and of declaring
that its expectations are high.
Second, you have chosen to
go to college in a university.
That choice does not follow
inevitably from the first.
There are selective liberal arts
colleges of superb quality,
and by and large they offer
substantially more guided
educational experiences than
does a university like Stan
ford. What advantages do we
offer by way of comparison?
Of Stanford's seven
schools, only three offer un

dergraduate degrees. Most of
you will find yourself enrolled
in the School of Humanities
and Sciences, which includes
the departments of the liberal
arts, the natural sciences and
social sciences: English and
philosophy and classics, his
tory and sociology and
economics, chemistry and
biology and physics. An in
creasing fraction of you —
nearly one-fifth, if the trend
continues — will find yourse
lves in the School of Engineer
ing. And a small number will
study geology, or petroleum
engineering, or one of the
otherdisciplinesthat makes up
Stanford's small but distin
guished School of Earth Sci
ences. In each of these
schools, you will find numbers
of other students who are pur
suing Master's or Ph.D. de
grees— for in addition to offer
ing undergraduate work, these
schools grant most of the ad
vanced degrees in particular to
scholarly disciplines that are
given at Stanford.
With the four other
schools, your contact will be
much less direct. These are
the so-called professional
schools, and their primary
business is the offering of
post-graduate degrees in par
ticular professional disci
plines: In the School of
Education, for example, you
will find some teachers in
training, as well as a number
of doctoral candidates who

are studying educational
policy, school finances and
government, and who will be
assuming positions of leader
ship in our public educational
system. Up at the other end of
the mall across the street is
the Law School, where about
600 prospective lawyers,
judges, or just plain
generalists are pursuing
degrees. Right next door is

the Gradaute School of Busi
ness, where an equivalent
number of MBA candidates
are slaving away. And way
over there, across Campus
Drive, is the Medical Center.
At any given time it has only
about 300 M.D. candidates,
but it looks huge. That is be
cause it is training interns and
residents and running a 660
bed hospital, in addition to

training post-doctoral fellow
and pre-doctoral scholars in
clinical work and in the basic
disciplines of biomedical re
search.
Your contact with these
other schools may or may not
be meaningful to you in your
undergraduate career. You
might have a law student as an
R.A. or as a T.A. in political
science —or you might not. You

might find, as one of my fresh
man advisees did three years
ago, that your interest in the
phi I osophy and practice of
education takes you to do an
independent study with a
member of the School of Edu
cation faculty — or you might
not. You might find yourself
taking a course in health
policy from a member of the

Business School faculty, or
you might not. You might even
reach the end of four years
here thinking that there really
wasn't a medical center at all —
that we just dreamed up its
existence to encourage false
hopes on the part of all of
those pre-medical students.
But I can assure you that it is
there, that a large number of
its faculty members advise un
dergraduates, that it con
tributes courses available to
undergradauate students, and
each year offers independent
research opportunites for
scores of undergraduates.
Going to college in a univer
sity thus means that you are
part of a student body with

you, there is one of another
kind of student, who already

as power. Many different
forms of commitment to them
are possible: artistic, literary,
scientific. All are charac
terized by intensity and con
tinuity of involvement,
bridging from the formal aca
demic program to the rest of
one's life. . . .
Finally, I hope you will
reflect from time to time on
the personal obligations you
are building. I'm not talking
about the fact that you got in
here and some other people
didn't, or about the fact that
you may have some form of
financial aid. These things
reflect our assessment of your
abilities and accomplishments.
But accomplishments and abil
ities also generate obligations.
You will be, throughout your

lives, in a better position to do
things for your fellow human
beings than most people. That
is a serious matter. In this day
and age, when economic cir
cumstances often dictate too
much concern over one's own
future, it is sometimes actually
reassuring that we all have an
agenda of social responsibil
ity. Think from time to time
about the form in which you
might choose to deliver on
your responsibility, how you
might equip yourselves to dis
charge it most effectively, how
much satisfaction various
forms of public service might
afford you.
Three months less than four
years from now, I will be bid
ding you farewell. The time
will pass quickly for you — and
alas, even more quickly for
me. On that day, I hope you
will think first of how much
you have gained and grown
and quickly thereafter, about
how much you have to offer.
In his annual welcome to incoming
freshmen, University President Donald
Kennedy stressed the diversity of the
University and the responsibilities
students here must take. The following
is the text of Kennedy's speech.

On behalf of the University,
I want to welcome each of you
to Stanford. This is a happy
time for you, for us, and for
the Dean of Admissions. For
some time now, Dean Fred has
been telling you that Stanford
is great; and he has been tel
ling us that you are the
greatest freshman class he has
ever admitted. Now, in fall, he
gets to prove to both groups
how right he was. It happens
every year.
Earlier today, under the
pretense of offering reas
surance, I had a little talk with
your parents. (This, too hap
pens every year; at noon I tell
the parents what good care
we're going to take of their off
spring, and in the evening
their offspring tell me how
little care they want or need.)
Actually, what I said at Parents
Convocation was something
like this: that Stanford is an
extraordinary place with a
great deal to offer; that how
much students take away from
it depends in large part on
how much they put in; and

that we expect a good deal of
independence of Stanford un
dergraduates. I assure you
that I said these things very
tactfully and very gently—but I
meant every word. It is just as
important that you should
hear this as that they should.
Why is that point worth
making? It is because you have
made a particular kind of col
lege choice. In the first place,
you decided to try a place that
would ask a lot of you, one
that is competitive in the sense
of having a highly selected stu
dent body and of declaring
that its expectations are high.
Second, you have chosen to
go to college in a university.
That choice does not follow
inevitably from the first.
There are selective liberal arts
colleges of superb quality,
and by and large they offer
substantially more guided
educational experiences than
does a university like Stan
ford. What advantages do we
offer by way of comparison?
Of Stanford's seven
schools, only three offer un

dergraduate degrees. Most of
you will find yourself enrolled
in the School of Humanities
and Sciences, which includes
the departments of the liberal
arts, the natural sciences and
social sciences: English and
philosophy and classics, his
tory and sociology and
economics, chemistry and
biology and physics. An in
creasing fraction of you —
nearly one-fifth, if the trend
continues — will find yourse
lves in the School of Engineer
ing. And a small number will
study geology, or petroleum
engineering, or one of the
otherdisciplinesthat makes up
Stanford's small but distin
guished School of Earth Sci
ences. In each of these
schools, you will find numbers
of other students who are pur
suing Master's or Ph.D. de
grees— for in addition to offer
ing undergraduate work, these
schools grant most of the ad
vanced degrees in particular to
scholarly disciplines that are
given at Stanford.
With the four other
schools, your contact will be
much less direct. These are
the so-called professional
schools, and their primary
business is the offering of
post-graduate degrees in par
ticular professional disci
plines: In the School of
Education, for example, you
will find some teachers in
training, as well as a number
of doctoral candidates who

are studying educational
policy, school finances and
government, and who will be
assuming positions of leader
ship in our public educational
system. Up at the other end of
the mall across the street is
the Law School, where about
600 prospective lawyers,
judges, or just plain
generalists are pursuing
degrees. Right next door is

the Gradaute School of Busi
ness, where an equivalent
number of MBA candidates
are slaving away. And way
over there, across Campus
Drive, is the Medical Center.
At any given time it has only
about 300 M.D. candidates,
but it looks huge. That is be
cause it is training interns and
residents and running a 660
bed hospital, in addition to

training post-doctoral fellow
and pre-doctoral scholars in
clinical work and in the basic
disciplines of biomedical re
search.
Your contact with these
other schools may or may not
be meaningful to you in your
undergraduate career. You
might have a law student as an
R.A. or as a T.A. in political
science —or you might not. You

might find, as one of my fresh
man advisees did three years
ago, that your interest in the
phi I osophy and practice of
education takes you to do an
independent study with a
member of the School of Edu
cation faculty — or you might
not. You might find yourself
taking a course in health
policy from a member of the

Business School faculty, or
you might not. You might even
reach the end of four years
here thinking that there really
wasn't a medical center at all —
that we just dreamed up its
existence to encourage false
hopes on the part of all of
those pre-medical students.
But I can assure you that it is
there, that a large number of
its faculty members advise un
dergraduates, that it con
tributes courses available to
undergradauate students, and
each year offers independent
research opportunites for
scores of undergraduates.
Going to college in a univer
sity thus means that you are
part of a student body with
diverse aims. For every one of
you, there is one of another
kind of student, who already
has a Bachelor's degree and
who has made an intense and
powerful commitment to some
more advanced form of learn
ing or scholarly work or pro
fessional preparation. They
are worth knowing, because
what they know and what they
believe could be important to
you.
Beyond them, the schools
represent an institutional
commitment on Stanford's
part that is different from that
of a college by itself. It is a
commitment to all of the

diverse realms of human
learning and understanding.
Stanford is one of the handful
of institutions in the United
States that is called a research
university, because it is com
mitted to the discovery of new
knowledge as well as the dis
semination of what is already
known. For the undergradu
ate, that is sometimes a source
of frustration. It means that
faculty members are com
mitted not only to teaching but
to other work as well.
Through the years here I have
often heard it said that Stan
ford should pay more atten
tion to teaching and less to
research and the appointment
of faculty, and that quality at
one of these things often
means a lack of ability at the
other. This last premise is, in
my experience, terribly
wrong. Among the best un
dergraduate teachers in this
university — and you are all
scheduled to see some of them
very soon — are some of its
leading scholars. My own ex
perience here over 23 years
has included seven years as a
department chairmen and
four years in charge of a
major interdepartmental un
dergraduate program, and
I've had more occasion than
most to worry about the com
patibility of good teaching and
good research. Though you
will no doubt encounter some
exceptions, I can assure you
that they go together more of
ten than not. I can also assure
you that Stanford is paying

close attention to teaching in
appointment and promotions,
and to continued improve
ment of the quality of under
graduate instruction
wherever we can. . . .
Still, the duality of a univer
sity's commitment does
sometimes lead to frustration
on the part of our under
graduates, who understand
ably want the teaching role to
be paramount and want prior
claim on the time and attention
of this faculty. Yet the involve
ment of the Stanford faculty
with matters at the frontiers of
knowledge offers great
benefits of a different kind. It
makes this an environment of
great intellectual richness,
and for the students who care
to seek it out, it provides a
vast array of opportunities,
for stretching their own ca
pacities through independent
work and through the
breadth of course offerings
available here.
That richness is related to
another quality of your new
environment: its diversity. At
tracted by the wide range of
fields and activities Stanford
offers, and by its excellence,
is an equally wide range of
people. We are a richly inter
national place; we have stu
dents from all corners of the
globe, with all sorts of beliefs
and backgrounds, and every
intellectual interest you can
think of. They — or ratheryou -
are also from all walks of life,
of all possible shades, and
with all conceivable kinds of

personal history. Each of you
probably thinks that in your
own background there is
something so wonderful and
fortunate, or so shameful and
unfair that it has no parallel in
anyone else's. I assure you
that you're wrong.
Now diversity does not just
happen at a place like Stan
ford. It is sought out, courted,
treasured. We believe it is a
cornerstone of the experi
ence you will have here. As
students in a university col
lege, you can be exposed to
the full range of a university's
intellectual mission and to all
the different advanced stu
dents who participate in it. As
students in an institution that
believes in equality, you will
also find that we have com
mitted substantial institutional
resources to guaranteeing
diversity in our undergradu
ate population. That has been
successful: You are not only
the best class we've ever had,
but the most diverse. For ex
ample, you include 9 percent
blacks, 9 percent hispanics
and 1 percent American In
dians. . . .
The kinds of diversity I have
mentioned and that you ex
hibit are made possible in part
by financial aid policies that
we have insisted upon retain
ing despite hard economic
times for institutions like this
one. We have done so be
cause we believe so strongly
in the value of the objective.
The differences
represented around you in

this auditorium and in the
campus beyond it represent
opportunities. These oppor
tunties will do you no good,
however, if you treat them
passively. It is easy to tolerate
differences, and it is also not
worth much. It is much harder
to explore and understand
them, but the personal
growth that will afford you is
truly worthwhile. Please try to
find the energy and courage
to search actively.
I also want to urge your
commitment to two other
values. The first is that univer
sities are devoted to the life of
the mind, and intellectual
purposes are central to them.
I hope you will note that I said
intellectual, not academic. We
promote substantial and
serious efforts in the class
room, and I think most of you
will respond well to that. But I
have in mind something
beyond just grades and
course taking. Most of the

rest of us are here because
we celebrate the values of
knowing and understanding
and because we realize that
these values create joy as well
as power. Many different
forms of commitment to them
are possible: artistic, literary,
scientific. All are charac
terized by intensity and con
tinuity of involvement,
bridging from the formal aca
demic program to the rest of
one's life. . . .
Finally, I hope you will
reflect from time to time on
the personal obligations you
are building. I'm not talking
about the fact that you got in
here and some other people
didn't, or about the fact that
you may have some form of
financial aid. These things
reflect our assessment of your
abilities and accomplishments.
But accomplishments and abil
ities also generate obligations.
You will be, throughout your

lives, in a better position to do
things for your fellow human
beings than most people. That
is a serious matter. In this day
and age, when economic cir
cumstances often dictate too

future, it is sometimes actually

ity. Think from time to time
about the form in which you
might choose to deliver on
your responsibility, how you
might equip yourselves to dis
charge it most effectively, how
much satisfaction various
forms of public service might
afford you.
