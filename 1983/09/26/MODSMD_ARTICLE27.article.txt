## Kennedy stresses diversity, responsibility to freshmen 
### 
In his annual welcome to incoming
freshmen, University President Donald
Kennedy stressed the diversity of the
University and the responsibilities
students here must take. The following
is the text of Kennedy's speech.

On behalf of the University,
I want to welcome each of you
to Stanford. This is a happy
time for you, for us, and for
the Dean of Admissions. For
some time now, Dean Fred has
been telling you that Stanford
is great; and he has been tel
ling us that you are the
greatest freshman class he has
ever admitted. Now, in fall, he
gets to prove to both groups
how right he was. It happens
every year.
Earlier today, under the
pretense of offering reas
surance, I had a little talk with
your parents. (This, too hap
pens every year; at noon I tell
the parents what good care
we're going to take of their off
spring, and in the evening
their offspring tell me how
little care they want or need.)
Actually, what I said at Parents
Convocation was something
like this: that Stanford is an
extraordinary place with a
great deal to offer; that how
much students take away from
it depends in large part on
how much they put in; and

that we expect a good deal of
independence of Stanford un
dergraduates. I assure you
that I said these things very
tactfully and very gently—but I
meant every word. It is just as
important that you should
hear this as that they should.
Why is that point worth
making? It is because you have
made a particular kind of col
lege choice. In the first place,
you decided to try a place that
would ask a lot of you, one
that is competitive in the sense
of having a highly selected stu
dent body and of declaring
that its expectations are high.
Second, you have chosen to
go to college in a university.
That choice does not follow
inevitably from the first.
There are selective liberal arts
colleges of superb quality,
and by and large they offer
substantially more guided
educational experiences than
does a university like Stan
ford. What advantages do we
offer by way of comparison?
Of Stanford's seven
schools, only three offer un

dergraduate degrees. Most of
you will find yourself enrolled
in the School of Humanities
and Sciences, which includes
the departments of the liberal
arts, the natural sciences and
social sciences: English and
philosophy and classics, his
tory and sociology and
economics, chemistry and
biology and physics. An in
creasing fraction of you —
nearly one-fifth, if the trend
continues — will find yourse
lves in the School of Engineer
ing. And a small number will
study geology, or petroleum
engineering, or one of the
otherdisciplinesthat makes up
Stanford's small but distin
guished School of Earth Sci
ences. In each of these
schools, you will find numbers
of other students who are pur
suing Master's or Ph.D. de
grees— for in addition to offer
ing undergraduate work, these
schools grant most of the ad
vanced degrees in particular to
scholarly disciplines that are
given at Stanford.
With the four other
schools, your contact will be
much less direct. These are
the so-called professional
schools, and their primary
business is the offering of
post-graduate degrees in par
ticular professional disci
plines: In the School of
Education, for example, you
will find some teachers in
training, as well as a number
of doctoral candidates who

are studying educational
policy, school finances and
government, and who will be
assuming positions of leader
ship in our public educational
system. Up at the other end of
the mall across the street is
the Law School, where about
600 prospective lawyers,
judges, or just plain
generalists are pursuing
degrees. Right next door is

the Gradaute School of Busi
ness, where an equivalent
number of MBA candidates
are slaving away. And way
over there, across Campus
Drive, is the Medical Center.
At any given time it has only
about 300 M.D. candidates,
but it looks huge. That is be
cause it is training interns and
residents and running a 660
bed hospital, in addition to

training post-doctoral fellow
and pre-doctoral scholars in
clinical work and in the basic
disciplines of biomedical re
search.
Your contact with these
other schools may or may not
be meaningful to you in your
undergraduate career. You
might have a law student as an
R.A. or as a T.A. in political
science —or you might not. You

might find, as one of my fresh
man advisees did three years
ago, that your interest in the
phi I osophy and practice of
education takes you to do an
independent study with a
member of the School of Edu
cation faculty — or you might
not. You might find yourself
taking a course in health
policy from a member of the
