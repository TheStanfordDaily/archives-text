### SHEILA HENNESSEY Staff writer FELICIA LEE 
Milton Friedman claims that
"there is no such thing as a free
lunch." He believes policy mak
ers often overlook indirect costs
when evaluating economic
policies.

Nobel Prize-winning econo
mist Milton Friedman told 600
freshmen Friday that the
bedrock principle of econom
ics is that "there is no such
thing as a free lunch."
But Friedman, a senior re
search fellow at the Hoover
Institution and a professor
emeritus at the University of
Chicago, said that the princi
ple is disregarded all too
often. Policy-makers have a
tendency to look at the direct
effects of economic policies,
but not the indirect, invisible
effects, he said.
Drawing on both historical
and recent examples, Fried
man proceeded to illustrate
how this myopic view can be
misleading. He cited the
recently-negotiated agree
ment with japan which pro
vides for voluntary quotas on
lapanese cars imported by the
United States.
The economist chuckled at
the word "voluntary," then
claimed that although Ameri
can autoworkers' jobs will be
saved by this agreement, its
indirect effects, which have
been overlooked, far out
weigh that benefit.
The agreement, he said,
gives the japanese govern
ment the go-ahead to enforce
a cartel, causing the price of
imported lapanese cars as
well as American cars to rise.
Friedman stumped the audi
ence momentarily when he
said that the people hurt most
by the agreement are Ameri
can farmers, until he ex
plained that the lapanese will
have fewer dollars to spend
on American goods, so will
buy less agricultural produce.
Friedman puzzled the audi
ence once again when he

claimed that China is com
munist today partly because
Franklin Roosevelt, as presi
dent, needed the votes of two
Nevada senators. But by using
the same method of tracing in
direct effects, the economist
explained his position.
To appease the senators
from Nevada, an important
silver-producing state, the
U.S. Treasury announced it
would buy silver at a price
much higher than the market
price. Silver began pouring
into the United States from
China, a country with a silver
standard economy. The re
sulting deflation, economic
distress and resources lost by
the Chinese Nationalist go
vernment, Freidman claimed,
contributed greatly to the
eventual Communist Party vic
tory there.
The closing comments of
Friedman's speech referred
to the size of the federal go
vernment's budget. Drawing
appreciative chuckles from
the audience, Friedman
claimed that "one of the im
portant reasons that the
federal government's budget
is out of control is because of
the invention of air condition
ing," which makes summers in
the nation's capital bearable
and results in longer Con
gressional sessions.
Asked for his views regard
ing federal aid for higher
education, Friedman said that
"there is no program in the
United States so disgraceful as
a program whereby we tax
children from Watts to send
children from Beverly Hills to
college."
Although he is opposed to
federal subsidies for higher
education, Friedman said he
does favor government loan
programs.

Friedman voiced his disdain
tor the Federal Reserve when
asked what he would do it
nominated as its chairman. "I
would recommend to
Congress that the Federal
Reserve be abolished," he
responded quickly.
Answering a question re
garding the legality of drugs,
Friedman said he believes ma
rijuana and other controlled
substances should be
legalized because some cur
rent problems would be al
leviated.

Research is an important
and rewarding part of univer
ity life which complements
rather than detracts from the
education of undergraduates,
Nobel laureate Kenneth Ar
row told a group of freshmen
Friday.
Arrow, a professor of eco
nomics and operations re
search here, spoke to an
assembly of Florence Moore,
Brannner and Roble residents
as part of a series of talks by
Nobel Prizewinners.

He told the group he chose
to speak on the role and na
ture of academic research be
cause it would be an aspect ot
university life unfamiliar to
most freshmen.
Though rewarding, academ
ic research is often unpredic
table, he said. "There's a lot of
failure — it's not like manufac
turing a common product," he
said.
Hard work alone, he added,
is not always a guarantee of
success. "No amount of inves

tigation substitutes for in
genuity," he said.
Professors who devote time
to research as well as teaching
often face special problems
such as time conflicts and diffi
culty keeping up with prog
ress in areas outside their
fields of study, Arrow said.
Nevertheless, he said re
search can be beneficial to
those who teach: "On the
whole, the better the re
searcher, the better the
teacher "
The economics professor

encouraged the students to
consider participating in some
sort of research project
during their undergraduate
years, even it they do not plan
to pursue academic careers.
Arrow also spoke briefly
about the study of economics,
the subject for which he was
awarded the Nobel Prize in
1972. While economics is "a
fascinating and important sub
ject," too many students study
it because of the "mistaken
belief that economics will help
you make money in business,"
he said.
The study of economics in
volves much conjecture
rather than concrete solu
tions to problems, Arrow
said. "Economics is an advice
giving subject," he said. The
main problem faced by
economists is that "what's
good for somebody may be
bad for somebody else."
Because of the complexities
involved in the study of eco
nomics, Arrow suggested that
elementary economics classes
should last two quarters.
"One quarter is really not
enough to understand the
subject," he said.

indirect effects, which have
been overlooked, far out
weigh that benefit.
The agreement, he said,
gives the japanese govern
ment the go-ahead to enforce
a cartel, causing the price of
imported lapanese cars as
well as American cars to rise.
Friedman stumped the audi
ence momentarily when he
said that the people hurt most
by the agreement are Ameri
can farmers, until he ex
plained that the lapanese will
have fewer dollars to spend
on American goods, so will
buy less agricultural produce.
Friedman puzzled the audi
ence once again when he

claimed that China is com
munist today partly because
Franklin Roosevelt, as presi
dent, needed the votes of two
Nevada senators. But by using
the same method of tracing in
direct effects, the economist
explained his position.
To appease the senators
from Nevada, an important
silver-producing state, the
U.S. Treasury announced it
would buy silver at a price
much higher than the market
price. Silver began pouring
into the United States from
China, a country with a silver
standard economy. The re
sulting deflation, economic
distress and resources lost by
the Chinese Nationalist go
vernment, Freidman claimed,
contributed greatly to the
eventual Communist Party vic
tory there.
The closing comments of
Friedman's speech referred
to the size of the federal go
vernment's budget. Drawing
appreciative chuckles from
the audience, Friedman
claimed that "one of the im
portant reasons that the
federal government's budget
is out of control is because of
the invention of air condition
ing," which makes summers in
the nation's capital bearable
and results in longer Con
gressional sessions.
Asked for his views regard
ing federal aid for higher
education, Friedman said that
"there is no program in the
United States so disgraceful as
a program whereby we tax
children from Watts to send
children from Beverly Hills to
college."
Although he is opposed to
federal subsidies for higher
education, Friedman said he
does favor government loan
programs.

Friedman voiced his disdain
tor the Federal Reserve when
asked what he would do it
nominated as its chairman. "I
would recommend to
Congress that the Federal
Reserve be abolished," he
responded quickly.
Answering a question re
garding the legality of drugs,
Friedman said he believes ma
rijuana and other controlled
substances should be
legalized because some cur
rent problems would be al
leviated.

Research is an important
and rewarding part of univer
ity life which complements
rather than detracts from the
education of undergraduates,
Nobel laureate Kenneth Ar
row told a group of freshmen
Friday.
Arrow, a professor of eco
nomics and operations re
search here, spoke to an
assembly of Florence Moore,
Brannner and Roble residents
as part of a series of talks by
Nobel Prizewinners.

He told the group he chose
to speak on the role and na
ture of academic research be
cause it would be an aspect ot
university life unfamiliar to
most freshmen.
Though rewarding, academ
ic research is often unpredic
table, he said. "There's a lot of
failure — it's not like manufac
turing a common product," he
said.
Hard work alone, he added,
is not always a guarantee of
success. "No amount of inves

tigation substitutes for in
genuity," he said.
Professors who devote time
to research as well as teaching
often face special problems
such as time conflicts and diffi
culty keeping up with prog
ress in areas outside their
fields of study, Arrow said.
Nevertheless, he said re
search can be beneficial to
those who teach: "On the
whole, the better the re
searcher, the better the
teacher "
The economics professor

encouraged the students to
consider participating in some
sort of research project
during their undergraduate
years, even it they do not plan
to pursue academic careers.
Arrow also spoke briefly
about the study of economics,
the subject for which he was
awarded the Nobel Prize in
1972. While economics is "a
fascinating and important sub
ject," too many students study
it because of the "mistaken
belief that economics will help
you make money in business,"
he said.
The study of economics in
volves much conjecture
rather than concrete solu
tions to problems, Arrow
said. "Economics is an advice
giving subject," he said. The
main problem faced by
economists is that "what's
good for somebody may be
bad for somebody else."
Because of the complexities
involved in the study of eco
nomics, Arrow suggested that
elementary economics classes
should last two quarters.
"One quarter is really not
enough to understand the
subject," he said.


Though rewarding, academic re
search is often unpredictable. In
genuity, not investigation, is the
key to research, Kenneth Arrow

Milton Friedman claims that
"there is no such thing as a free
lunch." He believes policy mak
ers often overlook indirect costs
when evaluating economic
policies.

Nobel Prize-winning econo
mist Milton Friedman told 600
freshmen Friday that the
bedrock principle of econom
ics is that "there is no such
thing as a free lunch."
But Friedman, a senior re
search fellow at the Hoover
Institution and a professor
emeritus at the University of
Chicago, said that the princi
ple is disregarded all too
often. Policy-makers have a
tendency to look at the direct
effects of economic policies,
but not the indirect, invisible
effects, he said.
Drawing on both historical
and recent examples, Fried
man proceeded to illustrate
how this myopic view can be
misleading. He cited the
recently-negotiated agree
ment with japan which pro
vides for voluntary quotas on
lapanese cars imported by the
United States.
The economist chuckled at
the word "voluntary," then
claimed that although Ameri
can autoworkers' jobs will be
saved by this agreement, its
indirect effects, which have
been overlooked, far out
weigh that benefit.
The agreement, he said,
gives the japanese govern
ment the go-ahead to enforce
a cartel, causing the price of
imported lapanese cars as
well as American cars to rise.

ence momentarily when he
