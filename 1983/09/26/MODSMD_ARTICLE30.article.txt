## San Jose State humiliates mistake-prone Stanford 
### ADAM BERNS 
It used to be that a San lose State upset over
the Stanford football team was a big deal, but
under Spartan Coach lack Elway it's becoming
common practice. On Saturday, San lose State
got its third straight victory over the Cardinal.
The unpredictable Spartans mixed their
short passing game with effective misdirection
in their running attack to achieve a 23-10 vic
tory.
San Jose State quarterback lon Carlson, who
led his team to only nine points against Cal last
weekend, connected on 20-of-33 passes for 211
yards, while the Spartans added 234 yards on
the ground.
"I think that one thing that worked was our
misdirection,'' Elway said about his team's run
ning attack. "It was effective. I was concerned
because we weren't running the ball well
early."
For the third straight week, the Stanford of
fense took nearly the whole game to get
started, not scoring a touchdown until the
fourth quarter.
The only bright spot for Stanford was the
performance of freshman quarterback |ohn
Paye. Although he threw three interceptions,
Paye completed 21-of-42 passes for 353 yards
after coming in for senior Steve Cottrell
towards the end of the first quarter.
Paye did an admirable job avoiding a fierce
Spartan pass rush which could tee off on him
virtually every play in the absence of a Stan
ford running game.
Paye was inserted in the game earlier than
the coaches had planned but Cardinal Head
Coach Paul Wiggin insisted that Cottrell's
injured ankle wasn't the reason.
Wiggin declined to name a starting quarter
back for next week."l don't know (who will
start)," he said. "We'll have to measure that
this week."
The Spartan defense dominated Stanford's

offensive line, which has lost several players to
injuries. Wiggin admits that he is greatly con
cerned about the status of the line.
Starting center Brent Martin did not play
Saturday due to an injury sustained against Illi
nois and backup Rob Macauley sprained his
right knee in the game, sending third stringer
Kurt losephsen into the game.
lust one week ago, he (losephson) was on
our scout team," Wiggin said after the game.
We've also lost Tom Prukop (the starting left
guard)."
San lose State took advantage of the situa
tion, sacking Stanford quarterbacks through
out the day. Stanford senior tackle Matt Moran
summarized the situation: "People have been
successful blitzing us and until we can stop it,
people will do it every week."
San Jose State took control of the game
early, marching 60 yards down the field on its
first possession. On its fifth play, Spartan run
ning back Art King took a handoff over right
tackle and scampered 35 yards to the Stanford
14-yard line. Three plays later, Carlson hit King
on a swing pass from the 15 for a Spartan
score.
Following the touchdown, Cottrell tried to
hit Harry on a bomb down the right sideline
but had the pass intercepted by San lose State
free safety Sherman Cocroft. Harry was open,
but the ball was underthrown.
Stanford got the ball right back when Car
dinal safety Charles Hutchings intercepted a
Carlson pass, but Cottrell was again unable to
move the team and was replaced by Paye on the
following series.
After Paye threw an interception on the
Spartan goal line, San jose State moved the ball
73 yards for its second score. King set up full
back Dave Criswell's scoring plunge from the
one with a 9-yard misdirection play from the
Stanford 10.

Freshman quarterback John Paye was in the arms of Spartan
defenders all afternoon. Although he was able to pass for 353
yards, Paye was sacked five times and threw three intercep
tions.
San lose State got a field
goal before the half ended,
making the score 17-0.
Farly in the third quarter,
Harmon missed a 26-yard field
goal but made a 32-yarder
later in the period.
The Spartans came right
back, however, scoring on a
4-yard pass from Carlson to
Sullivan at the start of the
fourth period. This drive was
again keyed by a long run â€” a
31-yarder up the middle by
halfback Bobby Johnson.
Spartan kicker Phillippe
Rebboah missed the point
after, making the score 23-3.
One of the days only excit
ing moments followed when
Paye hit receiver Emile Harry
for a 47-yard touchdown pass,
putting Stanford to within two
touchdowns.
After the Cardinal defense
held, Stanford got possession
on the Spartan 43-yard line.
Under pressure, Paye com
pleted a crucial third-down
pass to running back Thomas
Henley in the right flat for 29
yards. After Paye scrambled
for 6 yards and had two passes
fall incomplete, Henley caught
a 3-yard fourth-down pass,
just short of the first down,

ending the Cardinal drive on
the San Jose State 5-yard line.
Stanford never really
threatened again. On the Car
dinal's final series, Paye had a
pass intercepted with 1:13
left, but it was inconsequential
because the game was out of
reach.
Cardinal cutouts
Throughout Saturday's
game, Stanford was in the 3-4
defense, not its usual 4-3, but
only because of the type of of
fense that San Jose State runs.
Next week, the Cardinal
should be back in the 4-3.
Stanford, now 0-3, has its
Pac-10 Conference opener
next weekend at Arizona State
and follows that with games
against UCLA, Washington,
and Arizona. It could be five
more games until Stanford
gets its next victory when it
plays Oregon State on Octo
ber 29.
The Leland Stanford junior
University Marching Band
got into the action again
last Saturday. The 10-yard
penalty assessed on Stanford
at the start of the game was ac
tually a delay of game penalty
on the Band.
Apparently it is the home
team's responsibility to get the
band off the field in time.
