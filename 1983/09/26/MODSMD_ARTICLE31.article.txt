# Spartans' Carlson leaves no doubt he's Elway's man
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
If there was any question
regarding the job security
of San Jose State quarter
back Jon Carlson, there is
not any longer.
Carlson, who was man
handled by UC-Berkeley's
defense in a 30-9 loss nine
days ago, rebounded in im
pressive fashion against
Stanford Saturday after
noon.
The 6-foot-1 Carlson led
a crisp San Jose State of
fense as the Spartans
defeated Stanford 23-10.
San Jose State played a
prototypical offensive
game, mixing passing and
running plays with near
perfect execution to
achieve both ball control
and big play potential.
Carlson and his offensive
mates were anything but
near-perfect against Cal on
September 17. Carlson, a

junior mass communication
major, threw four inter
ceptions — three in the first
half—and Cal's defense capi
talized on San Jose State's
inability to move the ball.
Backup quarterback Bob
Frasco played over 12
minutes because Carlson
"didn't seem settled
down," according to Spar
tan Coach Jack Elway.
"He wasn't taking things
that the defense was giving
him," Elway said. Transla
tion: Carlson was inef
fective.
Thus, in addition to the
loss, Carlson's status as the
starter was in jeopardy. El
way said after the Cal loss
the position was open, but
Carlson was listed number
one last Monday, practiced
as the first stringer last
week and started Saturday.
