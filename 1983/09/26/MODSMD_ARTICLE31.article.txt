# Spartans' Carlson leaves no doubt he's Elway's man
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
If there was any question
regarding the job security
of San Jose State quarter
back Jon Carlson, there is
not any longer.
Carlson, who was man
handled by UC-Berkeley's
defense in a 30-9 loss nine
days ago, rebounded in im
pressive fashion against
Stanford Saturday after
noon.
The 6-foot-1 Carlson led
a crisp San Jose State of
fense as the Spartans
defeated Stanford 23-10.
San Jose State played a
prototypical offensive
game, mixing passing and
running plays with near
perfect execution to
achieve both ball control
and big play potential.
Carlson and his offensive
mates were anything but
near-perfect against Cal on
September 17. Carlson, a

junior mass communication
major, threw four inter
ceptions — three in the first
half—and Cal's defense capi
talized on San Jose State's
inability to move the ball.
Backup quarterback Bob
Frasco played over 12
minutes because Carlson
"didn't seem settled
down," according to Spar
tan Coach Jack Elway.
"He wasn't taking things
that the defense was giving
him," Elway said. Transla
tion: Carlson was inef
fective.
Thus, in addition to the
loss, Carlson's status as the
starter was in jeopardy. El
way said after the Cal loss
the position was open, but
Carlson was listed number
one last Monday, practiced
as the first stringer last
week and started Saturday.
Carlson completed 20-of-33
passes for 211 yards and two
touchdowns. He kept the
Stanford defense guessing by
throwing—on target —to a num
ber of receivers, unlike he did
against Cal. Art King caught
six passes, Eiic Richardson
five, Carl Sullivan four and
Bobby Johnson and Keith
McDonald two apiece.
If Carlson was not "settled
down" against Cal, he was
against Stanford. San Jose
State tried numerous gadget
and misdirection plays against
the Cardinal defense. These
types of plays are successful
only with proper and consis
tent execution — aspects

Carlson and the Spartans
played with Saturday — and
were successful against Stan
ford.
"I think this week in
practice we executed very
well," Carlson said after the
game. "We watched films ex
clusively — we saw a lot of film
this week. We weren't
surprised by anything they
ran. We picked up everything
when they changed their de
fensive schemes."
Most of Carlson's comple
tions were on passes into the
middle of Stanford's defense.
The Cardinal secondary
coverage left area open there
and Carlson took full advan
tage of what was available,
something he didn't do against
Cal. As Elway said, "Carlson
did an excellent job at finding
his receivers ... he executed

what was there."
Carlson knows his perfor
mance Saturday will make any
talk of being replaced bv
Frasco as the starter disap
pear. Carlson is the Spartans'
number one signal-caller and
there is no doubt about it.
"I think (my position) is
fairly secure, and I'm just
going to work hard to main
tain it," Carlson said.
For Elway, Carlson's play
meant a victory over local rival
Stanford—the third in as many
years for the Spartans — and
the solving of a quarter
back problem that existed
only in speculation for a
couple days.
Elway said, "It was a thrill
for me to see Jon have such a
good game."
Not half as thrilling as it was
for Carlson.
