# Card listless in first two losses

Illinois 17, Stanford 7
Champaign, 111. — It didn't
take a very sophisticated
knowledge of football to
realize that Stanford was in
trouble from down one in
its 17-7 loss to Illinois Sept.
17.
Starting quarterback
Steve Cottrell took the
opening snap from center,
dropped back to pass and
completed a 46-yard bomb
to Emile Harry. But it all
went for naught when a five
yard illegal motion penalty
cost Stanford the yardage
and set the tone for the
rest of the game.
That color tone was
bright yellow, as in the
color of officials' penalty
flags. Stanford was
penalized 10 times for 115
yards, enough to negate a
touchdown and 160 yards
in gains. Eight of those
hankies for 85 yards lit
tered the air in the first half
alone.
There were other
mistakes, too. The most
costly one was a blocked
Trip Hardin punt deep in
Stanford territory with
1:37 left in the first half.
The block came just over a
minute after Stanford had
tied the score at 7-7 on a
John Paye-to-Mike Tolliver
14-yard touchdown strike.
Illinois' lohn Ayres
recovered the blocked
punt in the end zone and
Chris White, Coach Mike
White's son, kicked the
point after to put the lllini
ahead for good. White

added a field goal in the
third quarter for the 17-
point total.
The Fighting lllini,
playing in front of 72,852
vocal fans, rushed for 215
yards on 53 carries while
the Card ground out a
whopping 44 yards on 23
tries, an average of 1.91
yards per attempt. Illinois
also had 23 first downs to
Stanford's 18, and punted
only three times. Hardin
took the field eight times.
Paye, who replaced Cot
trell early in the second
quarter, was 15-of-27 for
172 yards with one touch
down and two intercep
tions. Two bright spots for
Stanford offensively were
Tolliver, who caught nine
passes for 147 yards, and
halfback Kevin Scott, who
rushed for 51 yards on
nine carries.
Oklahoma 27, Stanford 14
Stanford — All of the atten
tion in Stanford's opening
game against then No. 2-
ranked Oklahoma cen
tered on Heisman Trophy
candidate running back
Marcus DuPree.
And while the Cardinal
defenders held DuPree un
der 150 yards, they certain
ly didn't stop the rest of
Oklahoma's ground ma
chine. All told, the Sooners
rolled up 395 rushing
yards, outgaining their
Stanford foes on the
ground by 396 yards.
The Cardinal rushed for
minus 1 yard on 22 carries
for an average of minus .05
yards per attempt.

The game was never
close, but Stanford fans
were treated to their first
glimse of freshman quar
terback Paye. With 13:04
left in the game, he jogged
on the field to the roar of
the 62, 778 and promptly
drove the Cardinal to its
second touchdown, an 18-
yard pass to Tolliver.
On Stanford's next se
ries, Paye again moved the

team steadily down the
field, but the drive and any
chance Stanford had of
coming back ended when
tight end Jim Clymer
fumbled on a 42-yard pass
play.
Paye's final statistics
were five-of-six for 88
yards, his only incomple
tion coming on a dropped
pass. Tolliver caught six
passes for 54 yards.
