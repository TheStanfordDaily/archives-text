# Basketball tickets on sale

Stanford's rigorous campaign to sell out
Maples Pavilion for the 1983-84 basketball
season is going well — so well in fact that pur
chasing season tickets may be the only way to
get a seat when North Carolina and UCLA
come to town.
Nearly 1000 student season tickets were
signed up for in a first-time ever sale last
spring. Additional tickets are on sale today and
tomorrow at registration.
Student season tickets are selling for $7.50.
In addition, students who purchase a season
ticket will receive a coupon good for a free
dinner at the Golden Spike.
Even if the student sale goes well, how realis
tic a goal is it to try and sell out a 7500-seat
arena such as Maples that has experienced dif
ficulties drawing in the past?
"I'd say there is a very real chance that it
might happen," |im Colton, director of promo
tions for the Athletic Department, said.
"Response has been encouraging, especially
considering we had never tried some of this
stuff before.
"With the rush we're expecting from stu

dents and faculty (and) staff, we're very op
timistic about the prospects."
Bruce Pearl, recently promoted to the
associate head coach position, explained the
strategy behind the promotion.
"When we were at B.C. (Boston College), we
sold the place out and it was like a sixth man,"
he said. "The fans were instrumental in our
rise to the forefront of Eastern basketball. If
we can elicit a similar response now, we hope
to achieve similar results here.
Stanford had three game sellouts last year —
UCLA, Oregon State, and UC-Berkeley. 5500
season tickets were sold in 1982-83 as well.
All five Cardinal starters return from last
year's squad, including AM-Conference selec
tions John Revelli and Keith )ones. Stanford re
corded its best season in the last decade,
finishing at 14-14, and rounded out the season
with a convincing win over defending confer
ence champion Oregon State in front of a
packed house.
North Carolina, the 1982 NCAA champion, is
one of four teams participating in the Hewlett-
Packard/Stanford Invitational.
