Lebanese cease-fire arranged
Beirut, Lebanon — After 12 days of intense set tarian
fighting in the Shout Mountains, Lebanese Prime
Minister Shafik Wa/zan early today announced a
cease-fire throughout the nation and the creation of
a reconciliation council to disi uss Lebanon s politi
cal future.
"I he cease-fire, to be effective from 9 p.m. yester
day, was first announced in Damascus, Syria, late
yesterday by Syrian Foreign Minister Abdel Aalim
khaddah and Saudi Arabian mediator Prince Bandar
Sultan.
The intended immediate effect of the cease-fire is
to halt the warfare between the I ebanese army and
Syrian-backed Dru/e militiamen and their allies in
the mountains on Beirut's southeastern outskirts,

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service

but Wazzan emphasized that the truce was to Ih' ef
fective in all of Lebanon.
Speaking on Beirut radio, Wazzan said that lie
was confident that all parties would abide by tin
cease-fire.
Earlier in Damascus, Druze leader VValid Jumblatt
said that he had ordered his troops to stop shooting
at 9 p.m. yesterday.
In his announcement, Khaddah said .it a press
conference: "An agreement has been reached tor .i
cease-fire in Lebanon, ending the war and starting a
national dialogue. What was achieved is great. We
appeal to all our Lebanese brothers to go bevond
the bloodshed and the hatred in order to restart
the building of Lebanon.
Bandar, who worked for the cease-fire alongside
U.S. Special Envoy Robert McFarlane, told the news
conference that the accord included an agreement
"for the immediate start of a national entente con
ference."
Lebanon's official announcement said neutral ob
servers would monitor the truce.
The announcement said the reconciliation council
will include the army, the mostly Christian Lebanese
Front, the pro-Syrian National Salvation Front of
which Jumblatt is one of the three top leaders, the
Shia Moslem community's Amal militia, and repre
sentatives of the government and parliament.
President Amin Gemayel would head the official
delegation on the council, and several independent
Lebanese politicians also would take part, the an
nouncement said.
But even in the final hours before the cease-fire
announcement was made, artillery from the Shouf
Mountains above Beirut fell on U.S. Marines in the
compound they occupy at Beirut International Air
port as part of a multinational peacekeeping force.
Warrant Officer Charles Rowe, a Marine corps
spokesman, said a Marine was wounded in the bom
bardment, bringing to three the number of U.S.
troops wounded yesterday. Earlier in the day, a
Marine was hit by sniper fire and another suffered
shrapnel wounds. Rowe said none of the three was
seriously hurt.
Syria tightens rein on PLO
Tripoli, Lebanon — Syria used tanks and special com
mando units Saturday and yesterday to bring under
its firm control the remnants of Yasser Arafat's Pal
estinian fighting force in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa
Valley.
On hours' notice, Syria brusquely ordered the
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) out of the
area near both Lebanon's war-torn Shouf Moun
tains and Syria's front lines with Israel. Three senior
PLO officers who balked were arrested. Syrian
forces then forced a 130-vehicle convoy of 1500
guerrillas to an area 60 miles north of their former
positions, leading them into a much smaller valley
where the fighters discovered they were encircled
by Syrian tanks on the mountain peaks above them.
Early yesterday, Arafat and his aides, from their
provisional headquarters in this northern Lebanon
port city, 35 miles west of the valley where his guer

rillas were trapped, were trying to get food and
water to them.
"I hope that we can solve this problem with our
brother Syrians," Arafat said. "It's a tough struggle
. . . As you see, they are sieging my forces, squeez
ing them."
Frantically conferring by two-way radio with their
fighters throughout the day, Arafat aides appeared
bewildered by their sudden forced march out of the
Bekaa. They were suspicious that it was linked to a
coming agreement between the American-backed
Lebanese government and Syrian-backed Druze
rebels, but they did not seem sure.
What was apparent, however, was the humiliation
and fear here. Arafat spoke of "dangers" to the
trapped fighters as aides talked worriedly of the
possibility of a "massacre," but when word reached
here that Syria might release the Palestinians if they
agreed to give up arms, the aides talked of honor
and resistance.
German conservatives stumble
Bonn, West Germany — Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
center-right coalition stumbled badly yesterday in
its first major electoral test since coming to power
six months ago, failing to win a majority in either of
two state elections.
While the mediocre performance for Kohl's own
Christian Democrats and his small coalition partner,
the free Democrats, does not put the government in
any danger, it constitutes a definite setback.
In the large, central state of Hesse, which in
cludes the nation's business capital of Frankfurt,
and in Bremen, the country's smallest state, the
coalition parties failed to wrest power from the op
position Social Democrats.
About 4.5 million voters, roughly 10 percent of
the West German electorate, were eligible to vote in
the elections which were decided mainly on eco
nomic and regional issues.
The national debate on the north Atlantic Treaty
Organization's (NATO's) plan to deploy U.S.
medium-range nuclear missiles here later this year
was not a major factor in either result, analysts
agreed.
The Kohl government is committed to the missile
plan, considered essential by NATO to counter a
Soviet missile buildup that began in the mid-19705.
By far the more serious setback for the coalition

came in Hesse, where the Christian Democrats not
only tailed to win a share of power but also lost
their position as the state s largest single party.
Weinberger arrives in China
Peking — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
arrived here yesterday seeking to stimulate years of
vague talk by both China and the United States
about a strategic and military relationship.
At the outset of the talks Weinberger will hold
with Chairman Deng Xiaoping, Premier Zhao Ziyang
and Defense Minister Zhantg Aiping, however, both
sides appeared initially cautious and anxious not to
upset a fragile momentum that has been building in
low-level talks over the past months.
The recent warming trend in Sino-American rela
tions was evident as Weinberger was welcomed
here in an unusual full-dress military ceremony at
the military museum near downtown Peking.
Crisply-uniformed troops goose-stepped in parade
before Weinberger, and a smart military band trum
peted "The Star Spangled Banner" and the Chinese
national anthem.
U.S. wants I M F restrictions
Washington — The United States and other rich
industrial nations insisted yesterday that poor
countries restrict their borrowing from the Inter
national Monetary Fund, touching off a struggle
within the IMF leadership.
The 22 finance ministers who set IMF policy were
arguing late last night in a closed-door session
about the terms under which the debtor nations qan
get new loans from the fund. U.S. Secretary of the
Treasury Donald Regan represented the United
States at the meeting. Mexico and Brazil, two of the
key debtor countries, also belong to the key 22-
member committee.
The IMF has been a lender of last resort, provid
ing money and developing financial rescue plans for
nations teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. When
a country cannot get new commercial bank loans
and virtually runs out of foreign currency to pay for
imports, it may turn to the IMF.
An IMF rescue program, which usually involving
stringent economic austerity or even hardship in
debtor countries, is sufficient to persuade private
banks to resume making loans.

The debtor countries often cut government
spending, raise taxes, and the steps to discourage
imports.
The U.S. and the other industrial nations, known
as the group of 10, believe that borrowing should
be restricted to avoid exhausting the IMF's funds.
Currently, a nation may borrow an amount equal
to 150 percent of the money it has deposited with
the IMF, with a maximum of 450 percent over three
years.
The United States had proposed cutting the maxi
mum loan limit next year to 102 percent, with fur
ther annual cutbacks over the next four years,
under this plan Brazil, for example, would have a
top three-year loan amount of $2.5 billion,
compared with $4.7 billion under the current sys
tem.

sion comedy series and "Hill Street Blues" was cho

in Emmy history, topped only in 1974 when CBS
captured 44 awards.

mando units Saturday and yesterday to bring under
its firm control the remnants of Yasser Arafat's Pal
estinian fighting force in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa
Valley.
On hours' notice, Syria brusquely ordered the
Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) out of the
area near both Lebanon's war-torn Shouf Moun
tains and Syria's front lines with Israel. Three senior
PLO officers who balked were arrested. Syrian
forces then forced a 130-vehicle convoy of 1500
guerrillas to an area 60 miles north of their former
positions, leading them into a much smaller valley
where the fighters discovered they were encircled
by Syrian tanks on the mountain peaks above them.
Early yesterday, Arafat and his aides, from their
provisional headquarters in this northern Lebanon
port city, 35 miles west of the valley where his guer

rillas were trapped, were trying to get food and
water to them.
"I hope that we can solve this problem with our
brother Syrians," Arafat said. "It's a tough struggle
. . . As you see, they are sieging my forces, squeez
ing them."
Frantically conferring by two-way radio with their
fighters throughout the day, Arafat aides appeared
bewildered by their sudden forced march out of the
Bekaa. They were suspicious that it was linked to a
coming agreement between the American-backed
Lebanese government and Syrian-backed Druze
rebels, but they did not seem sure.
What was apparent, however, was the humiliation
and fear here. Arafat spoke of "dangers" to the
trapped fighters as aides talked worriedly of the
possibility of a "massacre," but when word reached
here that Syria might release the Palestinians if they
agreed to give up arms, the aides talked of honor
and resistance.
German conservatives stumble
Bonn, West Germany — Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
center-right coalition stumbled badly yesterday in
its first major electoral test since coming to power
six months ago, failing to win a majority in either of
two state elections.
While the mediocre performance for Kohl's own
Christian Democrats and his small coalition partner,
the free Democrats, does not put the government in
any danger, it constitutes a definite setback.
In the large, central state of Hesse, which in
cludes the nation's business capital of Frankfurt,
and in Bremen, the country's smallest state, the
coalition parties failed to wrest power from the op
position Social Democrats.
About 4.5 million voters, roughly 10 percent of
the West German electorate, were eligible to vote in
the elections which were decided mainly on eco
nomic and regional issues.
The national debate on the north Atlantic Treaty
Organization's (NATO's) plan to deploy U.S.
medium-range nuclear missiles here later this year
was not a major factor in either result, analysts
agreed.
The Kohl government is committed to the missile
plan, considered essential by NATO to counter a
Soviet missile buildup that began in the mid-19705.
By far the more serious setback for the coalition

came in Hesse, where the Christian Democrats not
only tailed to win a share of power but also lost
their position as the state s largest single party.
Weinberger arrives in China
Peking — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
arrived here yesterday seeking to stimulate years of
vague talk by both China and the United States
about a strategic and military relationship.
At the outset of the talks Weinberger will hold
with Chairman Deng Xiaoping, Premier Zhao Ziyang
and Defense Minister Zhantg Aiping, however, both
sides appeared initially cautious and anxious not to
upset a fragile momentum that has been building in
low-level talks over the past months.
The recent warming trend in Sino-American rela
tions was evident as Weinberger was welcomed
here in an unusual full-dress military ceremony at
the military museum near downtown Peking.
Crisply-uniformed troops goose-stepped in parade
before Weinberger, and a smart military band trum
peted "The Star Spangled Banner" and the Chinese
national anthem.
U.S. wants I M F restrictions
Washington — The United States and other rich
industrial nations insisted yesterday that poor
countries restrict their borrowing from the Inter
national Monetary Fund, touching off a struggle
within the IMF leadership.
The 22 finance ministers who set IMF policy were
arguing late last night in a closed-door session
about the terms under which the debtor nations qan
get new loans from the fund. U.S. Secretary of the
Treasury Donald Regan represented the United
States at the meeting. Mexico and Brazil, two of the
key debtor countries, also belong to the key 22-
member committee.
The IMF has been a lender of last resort, provid
ing money and developing financial rescue plans for
nations teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. When
a country cannot get new commercial bank loans
and virtually runs out of foreign currency to pay for
imports, it may turn to the IMF.
An IMF rescue program, which usually involving
stringent economic austerity or even hardship in
debtor countries, is sufficient to persuade private
banks to resume making loans.

The debtor countries often cut government
spending, raise taxes, and the steps to discourage
imports.
The U.S. and the other industrial nations, known
as the group of 10, believe that borrowing should
be restricted to avoid exhausting the IMF's funds.
Currently, a nation may borrow an amount equal
to 150 percent of the money it has deposited with
the IMF, with a maximum of 450 percent over three
years.
The United States had proposed cutting the maxi
mum loan limit next year to 102 percent, with fur
ther annual cutbacks over the next four years,
under this plan Brazil, for example, would have a
top three-year loan amount of $2.5 billion,
compared with $4.7 billion under the current sys
tem.

Beirut, Lebanon — After 12 days of intense set tarian
fighting in the Shout Mountains, Lebanese Prime
Minister Shafik Wa/zan early today announced a
cease-fire throughout the nation and the creation of
a reconciliation council to disi uss Lebanon s politi
cal future.
"I he cease-fire, to be effective from 9 p.m. yester
day, was first announced in Damascus, Syria, late
yesterday by Syrian Foreign Minister Abdel Aalim
khaddah and Saudi Arabian mediator Prince Bandar
Sultan.
The intended immediate effect of the cease-fire is
to halt the warfare between the I ebanese army and
Syrian-backed Dru/e militiamen and their allies in
the mountains on Beirut's southeastern outskirts,

From the Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times/Washington Post News Service

but Wazzan emphasized that the truce was to Ih' ef
fective in all of Lebanon.
Speaking on Beirut radio, Wazzan said that lie
was confident that all parties would abide by tin
cease-fire.
Earlier in Damascus, Druze leader VValid Jumblatt
said that he had ordered his troops to stop shooting
at 9 p.m. yesterday.
In his announcement, Khaddah said .it a press
conference: "An agreement has been reached tor .i
cease-fire in Lebanon, ending the war and starting a
national dialogue. What was achieved is great. We
appeal to all our Lebanese brothers to go bevond
the bloodshed and the hatred in order to restart
the building of Lebanon.
Bandar, who worked for the cease-fire alongside
U.S. Special Envoy Robert McFarlane, told the news
conference that the accord included an agreement
"for the immediate start of a national entente con
ference."
Lebanon's official announcement said neutral ob
servers would monitor the truce.
The announcement said the reconciliation council
will include the army, the mostly Christian Lebanese
Front, the pro-Syrian National Salvation Front of
which Jumblatt is one of the three top leaders, the
Shia Moslem community's Amal militia, and repre
sentatives of the government and parliament.
President Amin Gemayel would head the official
delegation on the council, and several independent
Lebanese politicians also would take part, the an
nouncement said.
But even in the final hours before the cease-fire
announcement was made, artillery from the Shouf
Mountains above Beirut fell on U.S. Marines in the
compound they occupy at Beirut International Air
port as part of a multinational peacekeeping force.
Warrant Officer Charles Rowe, a Marine corps
spokesman, said a Marine was wounded in the bom
bardment, bringing to three the number of U.S.
troops wounded yesterday. Earlier in the day, a
Marine was hit by sniper fire and another suffered
shrapnel wounds. Rowe said none of the three was
seriously hurt.

plan, considered essential by NATO to counter a
Soviet missile buildup that began in the mid-19705.
By far the more serious setback for the coalition

came in Hesse, where the Christian Democrats not
only tailed to win a share of power but also lost
their position as the state s largest single party.
Weinberger arrives in China
Peking — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger
arrived here yesterday seeking to stimulate years of
vague talk by both China and the United States
about a strategic and military relationship.
At the outset of the talks Weinberger will hold
with Chairman Deng Xiaoping, Premier Zhao Ziyang
and Defense Minister Zhantg Aiping, however, both
sides appeared initially cautious and anxious not to
upset a fragile momentum that has been building in
low-level talks over the past months.
The recent warming trend in Sino-American rela
tions was evident as Weinberger was welcomed
here in an unusual full-dress military ceremony at
the military museum near downtown Peking.
Crisply-uniformed troops goose-stepped in parade
before Weinberger, and a smart military band trum
peted "The Star Spangled Banner" and the Chinese
national anthem.
U.S. wants I M F restrictions
Washington — The United States and other rich
industrial nations insisted yesterday that poor
countries restrict their borrowing from the Inter
national Monetary Fund, touching off a struggle
within the IMF leadership.
The 22 finance ministers who set IMF policy were
arguing late last night in a closed-door session
about the terms under which the debtor nations qan
get new loans from the fund. U.S. Secretary of the
Treasury Donald Regan represented the United
States at the meeting. Mexico and Brazil, two of the
key debtor countries, also belong to the key 22-
member committee.
The IMF has been a lender of last resort, provid
ing money and developing financial rescue plans for
nations teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. When
a country cannot get new commercial bank loans
and virtually runs out of foreign currency to pay for
imports, it may turn to the IMF.
An IMF rescue program, which usually involving
stringent economic austerity or even hardship in
debtor countries, is sufficient to persuade private
banks to resume making loans.

The debtor countries often cut government
spending, raise taxes, and the steps to discourage
imports.
The U.S. and the other industrial nations, known
as the group of 10, believe that borrowing should
be restricted to avoid exhausting the IMF's funds.
Currently, a nation may borrow an amount equal
to 150 percent of the money it has deposited with
the IMF, with a maximum of 450 percent over three
years.
The United States had proposed cutting the maxi
mum loan limit next year to 102 percent, with fur
ther annual cutbacks over the next four years,
under this plan Brazil, for example, would have a
top three-year loan amount of $2.5 billion,
compared with $4.7 billion under the current sys
tem.
NBC sweeps Emmy Awards
Pasadena, Calif. — "Cheers" was named best televi
sion comedy series and "Hill Street Blues" was cho
sen best dramatic series last night to highlight a
sweeping victory for the ratings-poor NBC network
at the 35th annual Emmy Awards.
NBC, which finished third among the three net

the Bth year in a row, collected 21 of the 23 Emmys
handed out Sunday night in ceremonies that were
nationally televised by that network.
Besides the awards for "Cheers" and "Hill Street
Blues," the police drama which was named best
drama series for the third consecutive year, NBC
picked up Emmys for best drama special "Special
Bulletin," best music or comedy special ("Motown
25: yesterday, today, forever") and best children's
program ("Big Bird in China").
Another low-ranked NBC series, "St. Elsewhere,"
was honored when three of its performers received
awards as best dramatic actor, supporting actor and
supporting actress.

in Emmy history, topped only in 1974 when CBS
captured 44 awards.
