Women's Volleyball
The No. 2 rated Stanford women's vol
leyball team lived up to its status as the No. 2
team in the nation last weekend by winning
all of its four matches in the San Jose Spar
tans Shop Invitational at San Jose State.
Although the Card swept their first
tournament of the season, it was by no
means an easy victory. "We really had our
backs to the wall every single match," said
Coach Fred Sturm. "We struggled but we
did find a way to win."
As members of one of the toughest vol
leyball conferences in the country the wo
men have their work cut out for them and
the scores of last weekend's tournament
show that they are ready to meet this
season's challenges.
In the first match at San Jose State the
Card overtook Cal-Poly San Luis Obispo 15-
7,15-11, 7-15,15-7. Sophomore standout Kim
Oden had 19 kills and a hitting percentage
of .567 in the match.
The second match against San Jose State
lasted a grueling two hours and 45 minutes.
The Cardinal defeated San Jose in five
games, 12-15, 15-8, 15-11, 14-16 and 15-13
despite the Spartan's home court advan
tage. Again, star middle blocker 6-foot-2
Oden led the team with 23 kills.
Stanford met success in the third match
against UC-Santa Barbara 13-15, 16-14, 10-
15, 16-14, 15-12. In the last game of this con
test Stanford was down 6-12, but made a
surprising comeback to win. Stanford
sunk Texas in its final match of the tourna
ment 15-12, 12-15, 15-6, 10-15, 16-14.
In this season's opener the Card lost to
No. 1 ranked Hawaii by a score of 15-5,15-1,
15-8 in the first game, and an extremely
close score of 15-6, 15-10, 10-15, 12-15, 17-15
in the second game. The first home match
will be against UC-Berkeley on Oct. 11 at
7:30 p.m.
Field Hockey
Despite field hockey's lack of popularity
on the West Coast, the Cardinal women aim
to become national contenders. Unfor
tunately, in last weekend's Long Beach In
vitational tournament they lost two of three
games, butCoachOnnie Killefer is optimistic
nevertheless.

"Overall we played well, and we im
proved during the tournament," said Kil
lefer. "We did better each game we
played."
In Stanford's successful first game against
Long Beach State, Cardinal freshman Mary
Chung scored the only two goals of the con
test — and both were off penalty shots.
In the next game, San Jose State swept the
Card 4-2. At the end of the first half the
score was tied 2-2, but Stanford could not
capture a lead.
In the third game against UC-Berkeley,
the Cardinal lost a close 2-1 match. Kiliefer
said that Stanford dominated the action,
despite the outcome.
Cross country
Both the Stanford men's and women's
cross country teams whipped past their op
ponents in last weekend's Fresno State In
vitational.
The women runners achieved a perfect
score of 15 in the meet, and were far ahead
of UC-Davis with 86 points, Arizona State
with 92, UC-Berkeley with 96, Hayward
State with 98, San Francisco State with 169,
Fresno State with 189, UC-Santa Barbara
with 237 and St. Mary's with 271.
The top five finishes were all Cardinal wo
men.
On the course, sophomore
Alison Wiley raced to first place in 16:45,
followed by fellow Cardinals Pattisue
Plumer in 16:49 and Ceci Hopp in 16:51.
The Cardinal men also dominated the
meet with a fine score of 28 points. Trailing
Stanford was Nevada with 50 points and
Fresno State with 77.
Card runner Jim Smith finished second
overall on the 10,000-meter course with a
30:58 clocking.
The next cross-counti-y meet will be the
Stanford College Invitational Oct. 8.
Tennis
The men's and women's All-School lad
der and the tournament tennis class will be
set at a series of "try-outs" this week at the
varsity courts.
All interested students should report to
the courts ready to play at 2:15 p.m. Wed

Field Hockey
Despite field hockey's lack of popularity
on the West Coast, the Cardinal women aim
to become national contenders. Unfor
tunately, in last weekend's Long Beach In
vitational tournament they lost two of three
games, butCoachOnnie Killefer is optimistic
nevertheless.

"Overall we played well, and we im
proved during the tournament," said Kil
lefer. "We did better each game we
played."
In Stanford's successful first game against
Long Beach State, Cardinal freshman Mary
Chung scored the only two goals of the con
test — and both were off penalty shots.
In the next game, San Jose State swept the
Card 4-2. At the end of the first half the
score was tied 2-2, but Stanford could not
capture a lead.
In the third game against UC-Berkeley,
the Cardinal lost a close 2-1 match. Kiliefer
said that Stanford dominated the action,
despite the outcome.

Fresno State with 189, UC-Santa Barbara
