# Water polo drops another one
## 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
The University of Pacific
wafer polo team sank Stan
ford's hopes of a victory by
scoring in the opening
minutes of the game and going
on to win 8-3, lowering the
Cardinal's season mark to 2-4-
1.
In the first play of the game,
UOP's Mike Haily converged
with a 10-meter outside skip
shot into the corner of Stan
ford's goal.
Head Coach Dante Det
tamanti said, "That quick goal
really shocked us as well as
everyone at the game and it
set the tone for the rest of the
game."
Stanford was unable to
come back from the shock al
though freshman standout
David Imbernino put the ball
home to make the score 4-1 at
the half.
However the deficit was too
great to overcome. Since UOP
had a very strong defense,
Stanford missed several op
portunities to score from the

hole. As a result, UOP
dominated the entire second
half.
"We should be scoring be
tween six and 10 goals a game
on the average," Dettamanti
said after the game. "We can't
expect to win on half that
many."
The goals that Stanford
scored were not too spec
tacular since UOP was down
one man for all three. On the
other hand, all UOP's goals
were "natural goals" — goals
scored with the full crew of six
on each side.
Despite Stanford's lack of
punch on Saturday, and its 7-5
loss to Pepperdine earlier this
season, the team has plenty of
scoring potential. Eight fresh
man are high school Ail-
Americans, including the top
recruits in the nation, Imber
nino, Stanford's high scorer,
and Craig Klass, third in
scoring.
Returning players include
All-America hopeful Steve
Moyer and Mark Daley, who

scored in Saturday's game.
But basically this is a very
young team.
"As with any young squad,
the most difficult aspect of
teamwork is learning to
develop a consistent style of
play," Dettamanti said. "This
year's team will be extremely
competitive with the ability to
beat any team in the country.
"The key to success
depends to a great extent
upon how quickly you are
able to develop as a team. In
dividually the skills are there.
Teamwise, they will take a bit

longer to develop."
Dettamanti would also like
to see the scoring spread out
more evenly rather than have
the responsibility fall solely on
Imbernino. Specifically, sop
homore Jose Velez, who
played well last season, needs
to take up the slack.
Imbernino sees an optimis
tic future for the team, despite
its 2-4-1 record. "The game
against UOP doesn't show our
potential at all," he said. "All
we need is experience and I
think by our next few games
we'll start to bring it together."
