the 550 linear feet of docu
ments for evidence of pilfered
Carter papers.
After the FBI agents com
pleted their search, congres
sional investigators arrived to
conduct their own search of
the archives.
New constructions
Despite the presence of the
FBI agents, the University's
business proceeded as usual
on campus. The Medical Cen
ter announced June 30 plans
to construct a $3.3 million nu
clear magnetic resonance
(NMR) center here.
NMR imaging uses harmless
magnetic fields and radio
waves in place of X-rays to
make three-dimensional
images of the human body.
The center, planned just to
the west of the Medical Cen
ter, should be operational by
1985.
In addition, President
Reagan signed an appropria
tions bill this summer that pro
vides $32 million for the first
year of construction of a new
collider at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC).
The new machine, named
SLC (for SLAC linear collider),
will study subatomic particles
and cost a total of $112 million.
Carter visit
As FBI agents searched for
purloined Carter papers at
Hoover, the former president
arrived on campus for a visit.
Carter, who was stopping at
Stanford on his way to Japan,

met privately on July 15 with
University President Donald
Kennedy, commisioner of the
Food and Drug Administration
during Carter's administra
tion.
The former president then

discussed high-technology en
gineering activity with en
gineering professors, and
discussed the details of run
ning a public policy center
with Hoover officials. Carter
is planning to set up a public
policy research center at
Emory University in Georgia.
Mosher's grievance
Other continuing campus
stories had new developments
this summer. The dean of the
School of Humanities and

Sciences announced July 7
that he had denied the griev
ance filed by a student who
claimed the termination of his
doctoral candidacy by the
Anthropology Department
was unjust.

Dean Norman Wessells
based his decision to deny
Steven Mosher's grievance on
the recommendations of a
panel he had appointed to in
vestigate the grievance.
Mosher's candidacy ended
Feb. 24 when the anthropol
ogy faculty unanimously
agreed with an investigative
committee report that found
that Mosher's allegedly un
ethical conduct in the People's
Republic of China had endan

gered his research subjects.
On July 21, Mosher contin
ued the grievance procedure
by filing an appeal with Gerald
Lieberman, dean of graduate
studies and research.
Freedman's tenure
Following a year-long ten
ure battle charged with allega
tions of sex discrimination,
Assoc. History Prof. Estelle
Freedman was recommended
for tenure by Provost Albert
Hastorf. Hastorf announced
his decision July 21.
Economon sentenced
Former Stanford student
Aristotle Economon was sen
tenced to 15 days in jail on July
19 for making and selling
counterfeit tickets to Senior
Casino Night.
However, Economon was
allowed two days off for time
already served. In addition,
his jail term ran concurrently
with an identical sentence he
received for illegally obtain
ing $1000 worth of telephone
equipment.
Stanford West
University administrators
claimed in July that additional
restrictions placed on the
Stanford West housing proj
ect by the Palo Alto City Coun
cil had caused them to
consider dropping the proj
ect.
Even though the University
has already spent $1.7 million
on plans for the 46-acre site,
officials here were angry at
what they called the extra
jurisdictional attempts by the
council to regulate Stanford
lands.
On July 7, the University cut

175 units from the proposed
project as part of a com
promise designed to win
council approval of the proj
ect. The council approved the
project's environmental im
pact report on July 11, but
added several restrictions
which the University consid
ered potentially unaccep
table.
In September, the
University proposed fresh
discussions with the council
on Stanford West.
McCloskey gets apology
Provost Albert Hastorf for
mally apologized to Guest
Professor Paul Pete McClos
key for the ASSU's handling of
the former congressman's
spring quarter political sci
ence class.

After a political science de
partment review of the
controversy surrounding the
course, Hastorf strongly at
tacked the ASSU Senate and
the Guest Professorship
Board (CPB). In addition, the
provost warned that academic
credit will not be granted for
future guest professor classes

unless the CPB's bylaws are
changed.
The controversy over
McCloskey began last winter
when some students worried
that McCloskey might use his
class to promote his allegedly
anti-Semitic views. Later, the
GPB attempted to control por
tions of McCloskey's reading
list and choice of guest lec
turers.
The ASSU Senate
responded to Hastorf's apol
ogy by appointing a committee
to study the Political Science
Department's report.
The senate also changed
two standing committees to in
vestigate the issue of academic
freedom and the CPB's
bylaws.
In early September, six stu
dent leaders issued a report
denying that McCloskey's aca
demic freedom had been
abridged.
Animal research bill
Despite heavy lobbying by
the Medical Center and other
research institutions, the state
Senate approved June 22 a bill
that would prohibit the use of
pound animals in biomedical
research.
In response, the University
geared up to fight the bill in
the Assembly. Famed Stanford
surgeon Norman Shumway
appeared on network televi
sion opposing the bill, the
Medical Center scheduled
press conferences with
heart/lung transplant patients,
and University administrators
actively lobbied key legis
lators.
The bill, sponsored by pow
erful senate President pro
tem David Roberti (D-Los An
geles), was scheduled for a
hearing before the Assembly
Governmental Organization
Committee on Aug. 17. But
Roberti postponed the
hearing when it appeared that
the bill wouldn't pass the com
mittee.
The bill will be brought up
again in January.
Reagan library
University President
Donald Kennedy appointed a
committee Aug. 4 to advise him
on the academic value of
housing Ronald Reagan's
presidential library ana public
policy center on campus.
But the leaders of the peti
tion drive that called on the
University to reassess its ties
to the Hoover Institution ex

pressed reservations about
bringing the library and cen
ter here.
Political Science Prof. John
Manley and English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz charged that
the Oct. 1 report date of the
advisory committee did not al
low enough time for the op
position to organize.
Manley and Rebholz were
also concerned that the policy
center might expand the role
of the Hoover Institution at a
time when the University is
supposedly reassessing its re
lationship with Hoover.

The Hoover Institution's
Board of Overseers endorsed
the proposal to house the li
brary here at its July meeting.
Hoover Director Campbell
also appointed a committee of
Hoover scholars to advise him
on the public affairs center.
Draft7aid link
The Financial Aids Office
temporarily delayed mailings
of aid offers in July in order to
review information in the of
fers on the draft registration
link to federal student aid.
The delay came after mem
bers of Stanford Against Con
scription criticized the
University's decision to send
out registration compliance
forms in the aid offers without
stating that Stanford would
meet all students' financial
need, regardless of their com
pliance.
The Financial Aids Office fi
nally decided to include the
information.

After the FBI agents com

conduct their own search of
the archives.
New constructions
Despite the presence of the
FBI agents, the University's
business proceeded as usual
on campus. The Medical Cen
ter announced June 30 plans
to construct a $3.3 million nu
clear magnetic resonance
(NMR) center here.
NMR imaging uses harmless
magnetic fields and radio
waves in place of X-rays to
make three-dimensional
images of the human body.
The center, planned just to
the west of the Medical Cen
ter, should be operational by
1985.
In addition, President
Reagan signed an appropria
tions bill this summer that pro
vides $32 million for the first
year of construction of a new
collider at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC).
The new machine, named
SLC (for SLAC linear collider),
will study subatomic particles
and cost a total of $112 million.
Carter visit
As FBI agents searched for
purloined Carter papers at
Hoover, the former president
arrived on campus for a visit.
Carter, who was stopping at
Stanford on his way to Japan,

met privately on July 15 with
University President Donald
Kennedy, commisioner of the
Food and Drug Administration
during Carter's administra
tion.
The former president then

discussed high-technology en
gineering activity with en
gineering professors, and
discussed the details of run
ning a public policy center
with Hoover officials. Carter
is planning to set up a public
policy research center at
Emory University in Georgia.
Mosher's grievance
Other continuing campus
stories had new developments
this summer. The dean of the
School of Humanities and

Sciences announced July 7
that he had denied the griev
ance filed by a student who
claimed the termination of his
doctoral candidacy by the
Anthropology Department
was unjust.

Dean Norman Wessells
based his decision to deny
Steven Mosher's grievance on
the recommendations of a
panel he had appointed to in
vestigate the grievance.
Mosher's candidacy ended
Feb. 24 when the anthropol
ogy faculty unanimously
agreed with an investigative
committee report that found
that Mosher's allegedly un
ethical conduct in the People's
Republic of China had endan

gered his research subjects.
On July 21, Mosher contin
ued the grievance procedure
by filing an appeal with Gerald
Lieberman, dean of graduate
studies and research.
Freedman's tenure
Following a year-long ten
ure battle charged with allega
tions of sex discrimination,
Assoc. History Prof. Estelle
Freedman was recommended
for tenure by Provost Albert
Hastorf. Hastorf announced
his decision July 21.
Economon sentenced
Former Stanford student
Aristotle Economon was sen
tenced to 15 days in jail on July
19 for making and selling
counterfeit tickets to Senior
Casino Night.
However, Economon was
allowed two days off for time
already served. In addition,
his jail term ran concurrently
with an identical sentence he
received for illegally obtain
ing $1000 worth of telephone
equipment.
Stanford West
University administrators
claimed in July that additional
restrictions placed on the
Stanford West housing proj
ect by the Palo Alto City Coun
cil had caused them to
consider dropping the proj
ect.
Even though the University
has already spent $1.7 million
on plans for the 46-acre site,
officials here were angry at
what they called the extra
jurisdictional attempts by the
council to regulate Stanford
lands.
On July 7, the University cut

175 units from the proposed
project as part of a com
promise designed to win
council approval of the proj
ect. The council approved the
project's environmental im
pact report on July 11, but
added several restrictions
which the University consid
ered potentially unaccep
table.
In September, the
University proposed fresh
discussions with the council
on Stanford West.
McCloskey gets apology
Provost Albert Hastorf for
mally apologized to Guest
Professor Paul Pete McClos
key for the ASSU's handling of
the former congressman's
spring quarter political sci
ence class.

After a political science de
partment review of the
controversy surrounding the
course, Hastorf strongly at
tacked the ASSU Senate and
the Guest Professorship
Board (CPB). In addition, the
provost warned that academic
credit will not be granted for
future guest professor classes

unless the CPB's bylaws are
changed.
The controversy over
McCloskey began last winter
when some students worried
that McCloskey might use his
class to promote his allegedly
anti-Semitic views. Later, the
GPB attempted to control por
tions of McCloskey's reading
list and choice of guest lec
turers.
The ASSU Senate
responded to Hastorf's apol
ogy by appointing a committee
to study the Political Science
Department's report.
The senate also changed
two standing committees to in
vestigate the issue of academic
freedom and the CPB's
bylaws.
In early September, six stu
dent leaders issued a report
denying that McCloskey's aca
demic freedom had been
abridged.
Animal research bill
Despite heavy lobbying by
the Medical Center and other
research institutions, the state
Senate approved June 22 a bill
that would prohibit the use of
pound animals in biomedical
research.
In response, the University
geared up to fight the bill in
the Assembly. Famed Stanford
surgeon Norman Shumway
appeared on network televi
sion opposing the bill, the
Medical Center scheduled
press conferences with
heart/lung transplant patients,
and University administrators
actively lobbied key legis
lators.
The bill, sponsored by pow
erful senate President pro
tem David Roberti (D-Los An
geles), was scheduled for a
hearing before the Assembly
Governmental Organization
Committee on Aug. 17. But
Roberti postponed the
hearing when it appeared that
the bill wouldn't pass the com
mittee.
The bill will be brought up
again in January.
Reagan library
University President
Donald Kennedy appointed a
committee Aug. 4 to advise him
on the academic value of
housing Ronald Reagan's
presidential library ana public
policy center on campus.
But the leaders of the peti
tion drive that called on the
University to reassess its ties
to the Hoover Institution ex

pressed reservations about
bringing the library and cen
ter here.
Political Science Prof. John
Manley and English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz charged that
the Oct. 1 report date of the
advisory committee did not al
low enough time for the op
position to organize.
Manley and Rebholz were
also concerned that the policy
center might expand the role
of the Hoover Institution at a
time when the University is
supposedly reassessing its re
lationship with Hoover.

The Hoover Institution's
Board of Overseers endorsed
the proposal to house the li
brary here at its July meeting.
Hoover Director Campbell
also appointed a committee of
Hoover scholars to advise him
on the public affairs center.
Draft7aid link
The Financial Aids Office
temporarily delayed mailings
of aid offers in July in order to

The delay came after mem

University's decision to send
out registration compliance
forms in the aid offers without
stating that Stanford would
meet all students' financial
need, regardless of their com
pliance.
The Financial Aids Office fi

PRESIDENTS MEET: Former President |immy Carter met here |uly
15 with University President Donald Kennedy and Hoover Institn
tion officials to disc uss plans for the Carter Center for Public At
fairs at Emory University in Georgia.
arrived on July 13 to search
the 550 linear feet of docu
ments for evidence of pilfered
Carter papers.
After the FBI agents com
pleted their search, congres
sional investigators arrived to
conduct their own search of
the archives.
New constructions
Despite the presence of the
FBI agents, the University's
business proceeded as usual
on campus. The Medical Cen
ter announced June 30 plans
to construct a $3.3 million nu
clear magnetic resonance
(NMR) center here.
NMR imaging uses harmless
magnetic fields and radio
waves in place of X-rays to
make three-dimensional
images of the human body.
The center, planned just to
the west of the Medical Cen
ter, should be operational by
1985.
In addition, President
Reagan signed an appropria
tions bill this summer that pro
vides $32 million for the first
year of construction of a new
collider at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC).
The new machine, named
SLC (for SLAC linear collider),
will study subatomic particles
and cost a total of $112 million.
Carter visit
As FBI agents searched for
purloined Carter papers at
Hoover, the former president
arrived on campus for a visit.
Carter, who was stopping at
Stanford on his way to Japan,

met privately on July 15 with
University President Donald
Kennedy, commisioner of the
Food and Drug Administration
during Carter's administra
tion.
The former president then

discussed high-technology en
gineering activity with en
gineering professors, and
discussed the details of run
ning a public policy center
with Hoover officials. Carter
is planning to set up a public
policy research center at
Emory University in Georgia.
Mosher's grievance
Other continuing campus
stories had new developments
this summer. The dean of the
School of Humanities and

Sciences announced July 7
that he had denied the griev
ance filed by a student who
claimed the termination of his
doctoral candidacy by the
Anthropology Department
was unjust.

Dean Norman Wessells
based his decision to deny
Steven Mosher's grievance on
the recommendations of a
panel he had appointed to in
vestigate the grievance.
Mosher's candidacy ended
Feb. 24 when the anthropol
ogy faculty unanimously
agreed with an investigative
committee report that found
that Mosher's allegedly un
ethical conduct in the People's
Republic of China had endan

gered his research subjects.
On July 21, Mosher contin
ued the grievance procedure
by filing an appeal with Gerald
Lieberman, dean of graduate
studies and research.
Freedman's tenure
Following a year-long ten
ure battle charged with allega
tions of sex discrimination,
Assoc. History Prof. Estelle
Freedman was recommended
for tenure by Provost Albert
Hastorf. Hastorf announced
his decision July 21.
Economon sentenced
Former Stanford student
Aristotle Economon was sen
tenced to 15 days in jail on July
19 for making and selling
counterfeit tickets to Senior
Casino Night.
However, Economon was
allowed two days off for time
already served. In addition,
his jail term ran concurrently
with an identical sentence he
received for illegally obtain
ing $1000 worth of telephone
equipment.
Stanford West
University administrators
claimed in July that additional
restrictions placed on the
Stanford West housing proj
ect by the Palo Alto City Coun
cil had caused them to
consider dropping the proj
ect.
Even though the University
has already spent $1.7 million
on plans for the 46-acre site,
officials here were angry at
what they called the extra
jurisdictional attempts by the
council to regulate Stanford
lands.
On July 7, the University cut

175 units from the proposed
project as part of a com
promise designed to win
council approval of the proj
ect. The council approved the
project's environmental im
pact report on July 11, but
added several restrictions
which the University consid
ered potentially unaccep
table.
In September, the
University proposed fresh
discussions with the council
on Stanford West.
McCloskey gets apology
Provost Albert Hastorf for
mally apologized to Guest
Professor Paul Pete McClos
key for the ASSU's handling of
the former congressman's
spring quarter political sci
ence class.

After a political science de
partment review of the
controversy surrounding the
course, Hastorf strongly at
tacked the ASSU Senate and
the Guest Professorship
Board (CPB). In addition, the
provost warned that academic
credit will not be granted for
future guest professor classes

unless the CPB's bylaws are
changed.
The controversy over
McCloskey began last winter
when some students worried
that McCloskey might use his
class to promote his allegedly
anti-Semitic views. Later, the
GPB attempted to control por
tions of McCloskey's reading
list and choice of guest lec
turers.
The ASSU Senate
responded to Hastorf's apol
ogy by appointing a committee
to study the Political Science
Department's report.
The senate also changed
two standing committees to in
vestigate the issue of academic
freedom and the CPB's
bylaws.
In early September, six stu
dent leaders issued a report
denying that McCloskey's aca
demic freedom had been
abridged.
Animal research bill
Despite heavy lobbying by
the Medical Center and other
research institutions, the state
Senate approved June 22 a bill
that would prohibit the use of
pound animals in biomedical
research.
In response, the University
geared up to fight the bill in
the Assembly. Famed Stanford
surgeon Norman Shumway
appeared on network televi
sion opposing the bill, the
Medical Center scheduled
press conferences with
heart/lung transplant patients,
and University administrators
actively lobbied key legis
lators.
The bill, sponsored by pow
erful senate President pro
tem David Roberti (D-Los An
geles), was scheduled for a
hearing before the Assembly
Governmental Organization
Committee on Aug. 17. But
Roberti postponed the
hearing when it appeared that
the bill wouldn't pass the com
mittee.
The bill will be brought up
again in January.
Reagan library
University President
Donald Kennedy appointed a
committee Aug. 4 to advise him
on the academic value of
housing Ronald Reagan's
presidential library ana public
policy center on campus.
But the leaders of the peti
tion drive that called on the
University to reassess its ties
to the Hoover Institution ex

pressed reservations about
bringing the library and cen
ter here.
Political Science Prof. John
Manley and English Prof.
Ronald Rebholz charged that
the Oct. 1 report date of the
advisory committee did not al
low enough time for the op
position to organize.
Manley and Rebholz were
also concerned that the policy
center might expand the role
of the Hoover Institution at a
time when the University is
supposedly reassessing its re
lationship with Hoover.

The Hoover Institution's
Board of Overseers endorsed
the proposal to house the li
brary here at its July meeting.
Hoover Director Campbell
also appointed a committee of
Hoover scholars to advise him
on the public affairs center.
Draft7aid link
The Financial Aids Office
temporarily delayed mailings
of aid offers in July in order to
review information in the of
fers on the draft registration
link to federal student aid.
The delay came after mem
bers of Stanford Against Con
scription criticized the
University's decision to send
out registration compliance
forms in the aid offers without
stating that Stanford would
meet all students' financial
need, regardless of their com
pliance.
The Financial Aids Office fi
nally decided to include the
information.
