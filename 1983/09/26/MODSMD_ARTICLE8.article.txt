Arms control has "helped
blind us at a crucial time" to
Soviet actions and motiva
tions, according to William
Van Cleave, Hoover Institu
tion senior research fellow
and professor at the Univer
sity of Southern California.
Van Cleave's remarks at the
start of the Hoover Institution
Conference on Arms Control
this weekend helped set the
tone for three days of talks
centered around the past and
present role of arms control
in national security and strat
egy-

The list of conference parti
cipants featured Reagan
administration officials and
internationally-re cognized
scV*o\ars, as we\\ as members
of the press, the private sec
tor and various areas of the
military-industrial complex.

"I surveyed the recent
record of U.S. arms control
experience for success and
failure," Van Cleave said. "I
searched diligently for exam
ples of success. I couldn't find
any."
Other conferences
speakers included such well
known figures as James
George and Charles Kupper
man of the United States Arms
Control and Disarmament
Agency, Hoover senior re
search fellow Edward Teller
and Harvard Professor Ric
hard Pipes.
Lewis, the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency's
director of multilateral affairs,
drew fire from several confer
ence delegates as he
defended President Reagan's
recent actions designed to ac
commodate arms control
agreements.
"I think we're doing a good
job, " Lewis contended. "We
are under a tremendous
amount of pressure."
Teller, who is also associate
director emeritus for
Lawrence Livermore Labora
tories, sharply denied
America's need for arms con
trol pacts with the Soviets,
whom he claims do not adhere
to agreements.
"Oisatmament negoVia\ior>s
are useful for the Soviets and
nobody else," Teller said.
