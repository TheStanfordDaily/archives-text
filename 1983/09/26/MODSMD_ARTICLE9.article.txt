Diplomats said the plan
would allow Washington and
Moscow each about 300 war
heads in Europe. The Russians
could retain the 324 warheads
on 108 SS-20 missiles facing
Asia, while the U.S. would
build an equal number to
supplement its domestic in
ventory.
In this way, the administra
tion believes it would retain
an overall global ceiling, but
allow for regional differences
in Europe and Asia.
Moscow has refused to
agree to any new American
deployments. Soviet leaders
have instead proposed to
reduce their missile force
aimed at Western Europe to
the present French and
British level of about 300 war
heads on 162 missiles.

President Reagan is ex
pected to make public today at
the United Nations a new pro
posal for breaking the dead
lock in the medium-range
nuclear missile talks with the
Soviet Union.
According to The New York
Times, the plan centers
around a higher proposed
ceiling on missile warheads
for each side worldwide, in
conjunction with a Washing
ton agreement not to deploy
all of its permitted missile war
heads abroad.
The proposed new ceiling
would allow the Soviets to
retain a greater number of the
more than 1500 missile war
heads currently in Russian ar
senals. The current Reagan
plan asks for 300 warheads for
each side.
