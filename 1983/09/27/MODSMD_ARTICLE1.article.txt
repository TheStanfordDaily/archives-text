# Res Ed clamps down on frosh drinking
## 
### TAREK HAMADA 
The Office of Residential Edu
cation is making a concerted ef
fort to reduce the consumption
of alcoholic beverages by fresh
men here, according to several
resident assistants.
The action is the most striking
part of a redoubled campaign to
emphasize a standard University
policy to put less emphasis on al
cohol in campus residences.
All RAs have been asked by
Alice Supton, assistant dean of
residential education, to serve
non-alcoholic beverages at dor
mitory parties and to center the
parties around some activity such
as dancing.
"Resident assistants were en
couraged to de-emphasize drink
ing alcohol at orientation parties
and at all parties during the
year," Supton said.
RAs can decide for themselves
whether they want to serve al
coholic drinks at dormitory par
ties, she said. "The office does
not believe in prohibition. We
believe that the resident assis
tants know best what will go well
in a party at their dorms," Sup
ton said.
Partly as a result of the policy,
Frog Pond Wines, Liquors &
Delicatessen, a liquor store in
Mountain View that was once
commonly patronized by under
age students, no longer delivers
liquor to freshman dorms. The
store stopped such deliveries
last year after a number of RAs
complained that the store was
selling alcohol to freshmen.
Supton said that serving such
beverages as orange juice and
soda alongside beer and wine
gives students, particularly
freshmen, freedom of choice at
parties. Freshmen won't feel
pressured to drink beer at a
party if other beverages are
available, Supton added.
Supton recommends including
an interesting activity that can
make a party a lively event in
which a variety of students can
participate. "There is a place for
beer-and-hard-rock parties. But
people need to be sensitive to
the fact that not every freshman
enjoys the same thing. If you give
one character to all the parties,
then some people may feel that
the parties here are not for
them," Supton said.
RAs at most freshman houses
said yesterday that alcoholic
beverages, usually beer, were
served at dorm parties last
weekend, but in more moderate
quantities than usual.
At one party, in Florence
Moore Hall, no alcoholic drinks
were served at all Saturday
night, according to Barrett
Cowan, an RA in Cardenal House
there. Fte said the menu included
mineral water, punch, fruits,
vegetables, bread and dip.

Cowan said he agreed with ef
forts to serve fewer alcoholic
drinks at dormitory parties. "If
the people at Stanford are in fact
so interesting, do you need to be
blasted to have a good time with

them?," he asked.
Upperclassmen were the only
people at the party who asked
him why no alcoholic drinks
were served, Cowan said.
Ann Pursely, another RA in

Cardenal House, said that the
alcohol-free party was a big suc
cess. "I think that we had a great
party," Pursely said.
Resident assistants cannot stop

EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY: Freshmen celebrate their first week on campus with a keg at a dorm
party. Residential Education administrators have asked for a reduction in the amount of alcoholic
beverages made available to freshmen.
treshmen from drinking a I
coholic beverages because the
freshmen can always find a drink
somewhere, she added.
At Branner Hall, RAs Cindi
Wheeler and "T. Bag" Biglow,
said one keg of beer was served
alongside non-alcoholic punch
and soft drinks at the dorm's

party on Saturday night.
"It used to be that beer was
just about all they had (at orien
tation parties). If you wanted a
non-alcoholic alternative it was
the drinking fountain or the soda
machine," Wheeler said.
Bob Holmen, an RA at Otero
House in Wilbur Hall, said about
180 freshmen from the Otero and
Rinconada houses drank non
alcoholic daiquiris, pina coladas
as well as two kegs of beer at a
party Saturday night.

Many of the freshmen at the
party did not know the daiquiris
were non-alcoholic, Holmen
said. "They came up to me at the
party and said that the daiquiris
were good but they needed
more alcohol. The party was well
received."
Several freshmen who went to
Saturday night's parties said that
it did not bother them that a lim
ited amount of alcohol was
served.
Maren Ormsefh, a resident of

Larkin House, where one keg of
beer and a selection of non
alcoholic drinks were served to
the 100 freshmen, said she
thought the party was well done.
"I don't think it would have been
any fun if everybody got drunk.
People seemed to be more inter
ested in talking and dancing with
each other," she said.
One keg of beer and several
non-alcoholic drinks were
served to the 100 freshmen at the
house's party.
