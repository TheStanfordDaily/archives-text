# Res Ed clamps down on frosh drinking
## 
### TAREK HAMADA 
The Office of Residential Edu
cation is making a concerted ef
fort to reduce the consumption
of alcoholic beverages by fresh
men here, according to several
resident assistants.
The action is the most striking
part of a redoubled campaign to
emphasize a standard University
policy to put less emphasis on al
cohol in campus residences.
All RAs have been asked by
Alice Supton, assistant dean of
residential education, to serve
non-alcoholic beverages at dor
mitory parties and to center the
parties around some activity such
as dancing.
"Resident assistants were en
couraged to de-emphasize drink
ing alcohol at orientation parties
and at all parties during the
year," Supton said.
RAs can decide for themselves
whether they want to serve al
coholic drinks at dormitory par
ties, she said. "The office does
not believe in prohibition. We
believe that the resident assis
tants know best what will go well
in a party at their dorms," Sup
ton said.
Partly as a result of the policy,
Frog Pond Wines, Liquors &
Delicatessen, a liquor store in
Mountain View that was once
commonly patronized by under
age students, no longer delivers
liquor to freshman dorms. The
store stopped such deliveries
last year after a number of RAs
complained that the store was
selling alcohol to freshmen.
Supton said that serving such
beverages as orange juice and
soda alongside beer and wine
gives students, particularly
freshmen, freedom of choice at
parties. Freshmen won't feel
pressured to drink beer at a
party if other beverages are
available, Supton added.
Supton recommends including
an interesting activity that can
make a party a lively event in
which a variety of students can
participate. "There is a place for
beer-and-hard-rock parties. But
people need to be sensitive to
the fact that not every freshman
enjoys the same thing. If you give
one character to all the parties,
then some people may feel that
the parties here are not for
them," Supton said.
RAs at most freshman houses
said yesterday that alcoholic
beverages, usually beer, were
served at dorm parties last
weekend, but in more moderate
quantities than usual.
At one party, in Florence
Moore Hall, no alcoholic drinks
were served at all Saturday
night, according to Barrett
Cowan, an RA in Cardenal House
there. Fte said the menu included
mineral water, punch, fruits,
vegetables, bread and dip.

Cowan said he agreed with ef
forts to serve fewer alcoholic
drinks at dormitory parties. "If
the people at Stanford are in fact
so interesting, do you need to be
blasted to have a good time with

them?," he asked.
Upperclassmen were the only
people at the party who asked
him why no alcoholic drinks
were served, Cowan said.
Ann Pursely, another RA in

Cardenal House, said that the
alcohol-free party was a big suc
cess. "I think that we had a great
party," Pursely said.
Resident assistants cannot stop

party. Residential Education administrators have asked for a reduction in the amount of alcoholic
beverages made available to freshmen.
