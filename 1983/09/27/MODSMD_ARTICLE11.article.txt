## Viewpoint: Robert Larkin Hard line needed with Soviets 
### 
In the wake of the Soviet downing of KAL flight 007 an
amazing number of columnists and contributors to the
op-ed pages of major American newspapers have
somehow reached the conclusion that the incident
demonstrates the need for greater cooperation and
enhanced negotiation with the USSR rather than the
pursuit of a harder line. Another popular response
has been to excuse the Russians of any responsibility
for the murder of 2b9 innocent civilians. They invoke
the "Ruskie clause," which states that any Soviet action
is justified by their "paranoia.''
Those who subscribe to this belief argue against an
active American role in global affairs for fear of upset
ting the poor Soviets. The USSR has one-sixth of the
world's land mass, the third largest population on
earth, an unparalleled resource base, and the most
awesome military machine in human history. The
Soviets do not flinch when in the course of their con
tinuing expansion they find it advantageous to employ
banned chemical agents or expedient to blast an
unarmed civilian jet out of the sky to demonstrate the
inviolability of their borders.
Having failed in their nice-guy, peace-movement ap
proach to weaken America's regional alliances, the
Soviets now seem to be trying the bully tactic, seeking
to intimidate our allies into submission and acceptance
of Soviet regional hegemony. With the subtlety of an
elephant in heat, the Russians have sadistically
reminded the japanese of their vulnerability to nuclear
missiles and threatened European governments with
unspecified "consequences" should they proceed with
the scheduled deployment of Pershing and cruise
missiles this December. The Soviets constantly harass
lapanese fishing boats and have tested the readiness of
japan's air defense system not less than 300 times so far
this vear.

The downing of KAL flight 007 makes
one thing perfectly clear; the Soviets
understand and respect power and
have no qualms about the wanton use
of force in pursuit of their goals.

Ignoring present Soviet hostilities and a history of
Soviet aggression, including Hungary, Berlin, Czec
hoslovakia, Afghanistan, and Poland (not to mention
adventure-by-proxy in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and
Central America), commentators maintain we must
negotiate, and Freeze-niks wail for a "verifiable halt"
to weapons production and deployment.
How can we expect the Soviets to negotiate in good
faith when in the KAL massacre they have lied through
their teeth, changed their story when confronted with
incontrovertible evidence in the UN, and refused to
cooperate in the search for wreckage and bodies?
Now they have gone so far as to blame the United
States for the whole affair! Recently, good, hard
evidence has surfaced suggesting that the Soviets have
violated existing weapons treaties (all of which were
considered verifiable when ratified), and the destruc
ti&n of flight 007" raises //->«* issue of a new Sov/ef AflM
system and a new ICBM — direct violations of the SALT I
and II accords.
What do the Freeze-niks suggest we do in the event

that a "verifiable" treaty is broken? Like speed limits
without traffic cops, treaties lacking adequate vehk les
of enforcement are worthless. Paralyzed by fear of Ar
mageddon, Americans would immediately rule out mili
tary options and resort to diplomacy. Perhaps we
could confront the Russians at the United Nations and
watrh them wince as we flogged them with the wet
noodle of world opinion. Oh yes, we could make a lot
of noise, but as President Reagan, our chief Russian
watcher, proved, Americans haven't the guts to enact
meaningful sanctions like credit restrictions or consul
ate closings. Nor would all the sanctions in the world
constitute an adequate solution to the strategic dis
equilibrium posed by, say, the development by the Rus
sians of an operational ABM system.
All too often we seem to be a nation of diplomaniacs
who pursue negotiations for negotiations' sake with
out ever assessing the underlying motives and goals of
the negotiating process. So anxious are we to conclude
diplomatic agreements that we often forget two vital
postulates of international relations:
• States are motivated by self interest, not altruism.
• Treaties in and of themselves have no inherent
value. They are desirable only when they yield a
measurable increase in national security.
If, because of previous experience, one has reason
to expect that the treaty will be violated (as we do, con
sidering the indisputable evidence of yellow rain and
the suspected development of a proscribed second
new missile and ABM system), and if one has no effec
tive means for deterring a violation, punishing it after
the fact, or countering the security threat created by
the violation, then negotiating a treaty actually
represents a greater danger than doing nothing at all
because ot the false sense of security it provides.
The downing of KAL flight 007 makes one thing per
fectly clear: The Soviets understand and respect
power and have no qualms about the wanton use of
force in pursuit of their goals. To them "cooperation"
means doing it their way.
Since WVVII we have sat on our hands and refused to
challenge the Soviets. Icy rhetoric, countless treaties,
and numerous sanctions have not halted Soviet expan
sion one iota. We build the MX, B-1 and Trident to
deter a strategic nuclear attack, but we are weak
kneed when it comes to checking Soviet regional ad
venturism. Fearing a confrontation over Korea, we
sacrificed half of that nation. Likewise, our commitment
in Vietnam was half-hearted. We ignored uprisings in
Eastern Europe, and huffed and puffed about the Ber
lin Wall that today stands stronger than ever. October,
1962 made a hero of ]ohn Kennedy and a sham of the
Monroe Doctrine. His acceptance of Castro's Cuba
opened a Pandora's Box in Latin America that promises
to bedevil our efforts to stabilize the region for quite
some time. We have all but forgotten Angola, Afghanis
tan, and Ethiopia, and now, in response to the KAL inci
dent, the President conceeds that "short of going to
war, there's nothing we can do."
Will we ever take a stance or be forced someday to
retreat into fortress America? If the United States
desires to maintain its current position in the world,
and if we expect any meaningful progress in the START,
Theatre Nuclear Force (TNF) and Mutual and Balanced
Force Reduction (MBFR) negotiations, we must convey
our determination to defend our values and commit
ments, including a willingness to utilize force where
necessary. If we want to play in the big leagues, we
must not be afraid to stand up to bat.
