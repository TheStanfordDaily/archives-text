## Leadership before materialism 
### 
Students today are full of fear,
afraid that they will not find a se
cure place in this nation's troubled
economic system. Many students
seem to be preparing themselves
for life with only financial consider
ations in mind, and seek security in
the college programs that seem
most designed to leave them with at
least a well paying job. Though they
are wise to seriously consider their
financial futures in shaping their
college careers, it may be the case
that some student* t Stan

without giving it anot er th Jght.
It is almost certainly the case that
many people who choose a career
for purely materialistic reasons
would have done greater amount of
good in a career less oriented to
financial success. Before any mem
bers of the Class of '87 make such an
unthinking mistake, I would like to
!help them clarify and perhaps
;overcome these fears, advise them
;of their potential as Stanford stu
dents, and provoke them into
•serious consideration before
•making a choice they'll probably
have to live with for their entire
Jives.
I To a freshman, arriving at Stan
ford can give the feeling of a runner
having just arrived late to a marat
hon. From the busy socializing of
orientation week, through the rush
of registration and into the hectic
first days of classes, it is not hard to
become wistful for the simple secur
ity one has left at home. In the place
of this security, Stanford students
are presented with the limitless op
portunities of education.
But these new opportunities can
be a bit intimidating, while becom
ing increasingly aware of the
ominous stormclouds looming
ahead, beyond graduation. That
storm far ahead is the real world,
and the national and world eco
nomy, which is not often generous
to the unprepared. At this moment,
those storm clouds seem to be
looming larger and darker and
more ominously than usual, sending
many students scurrying to the rela
tive safety of pre-professional edu
cation.
Yet even the recent experiences
of students who choose those

"safe" careers seem to indicate that
no career is absolutely secure.
Medical students complain that com
petition is fierce over the most
desirable jobs — those in large hospi
tals in urban areas — and many find
that they must accept less desirable
positions, away from the cities.
There also seems to be a glut of
lawyers, as most students from the
best law schools vie for lucrative
positions with prestigious law firms.
(They also go for the bucks: In a
recent graduating class at Stanford
Law School, only two out of a class
of more than 100 entered the legal
aid-public defender branches of the
legal system.)
Most surprising, however, are
the recent indications that the high
technology industries will not
replace old-style heavy industry,
perhaps leaving millions of perma
nently unemployed workers (this
was reported in The New York
Times). Two researchers here at the
Hoover Institute did not even rank
the computer industry in the top 20
industries with regard to growing
employment in the coming years.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics also
reported that those jobs that will
open will be low-paying ones: 70
percent of them paying less than

$12,600 per year, while only 30 per
cent of the jobs in the older indus
tries were that low paying.
So there are many reasons to be
scared. Students now realize that
they can no longer afford to be
casual about their career
prospects, and this realization can
not be disparaged. However, in
their zeal for achieving financial se
curity, many students are forgetting
responsibilities of at least second
ary importance. If it is true that
Stanford students are somehow
shaped from the finer clay of
humanity, then they also have a re
sponsibility to be responsible
leaders and use their elevated posi
tions to improve conditions for
those not lucky enough to attend
Stanford. Many students are very
happy to accept their noblesse, for
getting their oblige, and simply
strive to make as big a pile of money
as possible. Therein lies the
tragedy: If the elite students of
today, the future leaders of the
world, and the potential agents of
our salvation are only interested in
making money, will anything ever
get any better?
