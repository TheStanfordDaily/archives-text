Human rights in Iran
The shooting down of the Korean
commercial jetliner was an inex
cusable act and a terrible tragedy. It
is only natural that American public
opinion and media should react
strongly to this incident. In fact, we
as humanitarians and advocates of
democracy, justice and freedom are
expected to show sympathy and takt
initiatives to prevent such tragedies
from ever happening again.
The question that comes to mind
is that whether sue h
humanitarianism should be selective
and even prejudicial, or must be
applied equally to all people and
situations. Case in point, the gross
violations of human rights in Iran
and the continuation of the
Iran/Iraq war.
Most of those killed have
been teenage boys that were forced
to the fronts by the ruling clerics in
Iran. Now I ask you, even if we
apply humanitarianism on a purely
proportional (i.e. number of those
killed) basis, doesn't this tragedy
deserve at least a small portion of
the media and public attention that
the jetliner incident has received?
Why are we so silent when
thousands are sacrificed by a
medieval and barbaric regime; 1 Why
don't we use our leverage to stop
this totally meaningless massacre?
Or should we wait and react only if
flier "Soviets" involved?

Geiger's schedule
As one of the Stanford students
who sat in the rain in Norman in
exulting over the trouncing
which Stanford was giving an Okla
homa team as highly ranked as its
current successor, I was very
distressed at the cry-baby comments
of Andy Ceiger as found in Glenn
Dickey's column of Sept. 12,1983.
Geiger contends games against
top-ranked teams, in which Stan
ford (in his mind) has no chance,
can only lead to a losing attitude and
poor attendance. He also contends
that more games against such teams
as San Jose State, games which
Stanford "has a chance to win,"
would enhance the Stanford pro
gram, and better prepare it for the
conference schedule. A schedule
which forces them, poor dears, to
face both USC and UCLA every
year!
Geiger forgets, or has never
known, that Stanford traditionally
plays best against its toughest oppo
nents, often winning these games
under John Ralston and Bill Walsh,
and occasionally under lesser
coaches. Last season's solid upset of
Washington is a fine example.
Also overlooked is Stanford's
tendency, even under Ralston and
Walsh, to drop games against unin
spiring, sub-standard competition.
Such is the fate which befell Cal
against San Diego State earlier this
season. As in so many Stanford-San
Jose State games, Cal played uni
nspired football and was beaten by
San Diego State, prompting Andy
Geiger to say "San Diego State is no
pushover."
Geiger seems to believe Stanford
cannot recruit the athletes neces
sary to compete with the rest of the
country. The bowl teams of Ralston
and Walsh have proven that wrong.
I oo many times Stanford linemen
have been publically excused as
being, in effect, too smart to be big
or fast enough to protect the pas
ser, while more often the problem
was that they couldn't know where
the quarterback was; poorly
coached, he had run out of the
pocket and was displaying his in
credible "natural talent" in trying to
allude outside rushers.
By implication, Andy Geiger
would prefer that the Stanford team
spend its season back on the East
coast, playing Ivy league schools,
where he apparently thinks he still
is.
If Glenn Dickey's presentation of
Geiger's comments is accurate,
which I do not want to believe, then
Andy Geiger owes an apology to
Stanford students, alumni and par
ticularly, football players.
