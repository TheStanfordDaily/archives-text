## Balanced attack key to success Booters take on Nevada-Las Vegas 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
Ihe Stanford men's soccer
team must bounce back from
its two game losing streak if it is
to have a chance at contend
ing with the strong Nevada Los
Vegas team in today's 3 p.m.,
game at the Harry Malone
Field.
UNLV is coming off an inspir
ing victory over Cal State Ful
ler tc> n (3-1). Stanford must be
especially aware of Runnin'
Rebel's Robbie Ryerson who
lias 13 points in seven games.
I his kid is simply scoring
every game," stated Coach
Nelson Lodge. Lodge hopes
he will not have to put a man
'>n him but he explained, "If
/e get anyÂ»kind of a lead I
/on't hesitate to mark him."

Despite the great scoring
threat of Ryerson, Stanford's
game plan will not be any
different from any other game.
Stanford has a strong enough
team as a whole that no one
player will have too much of
an effect on its game plan.
"I would like to play every
game with consistent strength
whether it be against a 'no
body' or an excellent team."
Lodge's strategy is working
sufficiently this season. After
beating Washington to be
come nationally ranked, Stan
ford did not let up and pum
meled Sacramento 8-1. The
victory over Washington gave
Stanford a ranking of eighth in
the west.

UNLV is ranked fifth in the
west.
"We have 14 more games so
I want to stay as steady and
strong for the entire season,"
Lodge said. "It's ridiculous to
get up for one game and lose
the next simply because one
team is ranked higher than the
other. As a matter of fact, I
have a fantasy that we could
go into each game not know
ing what team we were play
ing, so we would have to con
centrate only on our game and
not our opponents. If we were
able to do this, we would be
outstanding.
Senior striker lorge Titinger,
who scored 13 goals and had
12 assists last season, and
junior midfielder Angel Vas

quez have been the scoring
leaders for Stanford. Vasquez
has 10 points this year but is
uncertain for today's game be
cause of an ankle injury.
Junior striker Willie Burk
hardt, who Lodge praises as
being simply magnificent as
the goal, has recorded three
shutouts and his goal per
game average is 0.83.
Stanford's team effort will
be tested since these two
teams are so evenly matched.
