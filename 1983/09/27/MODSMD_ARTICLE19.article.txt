# Australia II slips past Liberty
## Cup goes down under 
### 
From the Washington Post
Newport, R.I. — The men
from the land clown under
turned the yachting world
upside down yesterday.
Australia II slid past
Liberty late in the seventh
and deciding America's
Cup race on placid Rhode
Island Sound, then
withstood a furious upwind
challenge to end the
longest winning streak in
sports.
The final race for the
treasured silver trophy the
New York Yacht Club has
held through 25 challenges
since 1851 ended at 5:22
EDT yesterday afternoon in
a rosy dusk. The white
challenger with the radical,
winged keel slipped across
the finish 41 seconds ahead
of red American Liberty,
whose name will live in
yachting infamy.
Australia 11, which had to
win three straight races to
take this series after falling
behind, 3-1, was engulfed
immediately in a sea of
cheering fans as yachts
from the spectator fleet
roared to her side.
While the crew wrestled
the mainsail from the spars,
Ben Lexcen, the yacht
designer for whom this
winged invention marked
the fourth try at the cup in
10 years, leaped from a
rubber dinghy onto the
victorious yacht, shook
skipper John Bertrand's
hand and steered her
home.
It was a hard, close vic
tory appropriate to the
most competitive Cup se
ries ever. Liberty skipper
Dennis Conner, the
defending cup champion,
won the start in 8-knot

breezes, lost the lead a
short way up the first leg
but regained it and held on
until only six miles
remained of the 24.3-mile
course.
Australia hung close be
hind, never trailing by as
much as a minute, but the
final lead change late in the
day was as unexpected as
any development in this
surprise-filled Cup sum
mer.
Conner was sailing bril
liantly and the American
syndicate chiefs aboard
Liberty's motor tender,
Fire Three, looked content
and confident as she
turned down the next-to
last leg 57 seconds ahead
with her spinnaker full and
the wind and Australia II at
her back.
But the Aussies, in a risky
maneuver halfway through
the leg, went off down the
right side of the course and
a caught a superior
breeze. Suddenly the lead
was gone. Veteran 12-
meter Gary Jobson, watch
ing from a spectator boat
250 yards behind the
yachts, jumped to his feet
and shouted, "Australia is
catching her." The boats
were side by side and Con
ner was forced to maneu
ver away as Australia stole
his wind.
Conner removed about a
half-ton of ballast weights
from Liberty for this race,
reasoning that Australia 11,
two tons lighter, would be
too quick in yesterday's
light breezes, which never
exceeded 10 knots. The tac
tic worked as long as the
boats were sailing into the
wind, but the two times
they turned their transoms

to the breeze Australia
went faster, and that
turned out to be the yacht
race.
With Liberty 21 seconds
behind as the boats sailed
up the final 4 and a half
miles into the breeze, Con
ner steered his boat
through the wind 47 times,
tacking back and forth
across the course at half
minute intervals while his
crew strained to trim the
sails. It was a Herculean
show, but Bertrand echoed
Conner's every move and
the Americans were left
with no hole to sneak
through.
As the boats approached
the finish they were sil
houetted against the set
ting sun, Australia II four
boat lengths ahead. A puff
of smoke from the race
committee yacht, Black
Knight, signaled the end of
the race and the end of an
era.
The 25th and last chal
lenge for the cup the yacht
American won from a fleet
of British boats 132 years
ago was over. The name
America's Cup remains, but
it will next be contested
12,000 miles away off Perth,
on the west coast of
Australia. The Australians
will entertain challenges
for a series expected to
start in January 1987, and
already several American
yachtsmen have said they
will be there.
What lost the cup?
"Arrogance," said Harold
Ludmore, former
helmsman of the unsuc
cessful British entry Vic
tory '83.
