## Stanford football '83 is... well... bad 
### 
The 1974 edition of the Merriam-
Webster Pocket Dictionary defines the
word "bad" as "below standard, poor."
The dictionary's editorial staff might
consider enhancing its definition by ad
ding three more words: "Stanford foot
ball, 1983."
As evidenced by Stanford's latest
catastrophe, a 23-10 embarrassment
compliments of South Bay rival San lose
State, Cardinal football fans are in for a
long season. Stanford mistakes seem to
be part of the play book and touch
downs are about as common as trees in
the state of Kansas.
More than just another loss (the third
this season and sixth in a row,) the San
Jose State game spelled out Stanford's
fate for the rest of the season. Had
Coach Paul Wiggin and his troops
prevailed over a less talented, but better
coached Spartan squad, they might have
gained the confidence and momentum
necessary to at least be competitive in
the rugged Pacific-10 Conference.
As it is, though, Stanford will open its
Pac-10 schedule at Arizona State Satur
day sporting an 0-3 record and will face
the loud Sun Devil fans with all the con
fidence and momentum of a winless
team. Then Stanford returns home to
take on defending Rose Bowl champs
UCLA. Then it's Washington in Seattle.
Then it's Arizona, the team Sports Il
lustrated ranked No. 3 in its pre-season
issue.
In other words, barring nuclear
holocaust, Stanford will be 0-7 before it
has another legitimate chance to win a
football game, an away contest against
Oregon State Oct. 29. And the way the
Card has played in its first three outings,
it may be hard-pressed to beat even the
Beavers, who have racked up a 17-92-2
record in the last decade.
Of the three non-conference losses,
the one to the Spartans stings the most.
On Saturday, the problems started
before the game even began.
Stanford outdid itself this time. In
stead of having its first penalty on its
first play (the case a week earlier at Illi
nois) the Cardinal had yardage marched
off against it before the opening kick
off.
The Band (yes, the same one of Big
Came fame) was on the field too long
before the game, a pair of five-yard
delay of game penalties were assessed
and San lose State kicked off from the 50
instead of its own 40 yard line.
Stanford's first series left nothing to
be desired as far as humor was con
cerned:
First down: Steve Cottrell completes

pass to Mike Tolliver, loss of four.
Second down Kevin Scott runs left, no
gain.
Third down: Lci.rell overthrows in
tended receiver lolliver, but pass is
caught by Coach Wiggin on the sideline.
Fourth down: Trip Hardin punts.
lust 1:33 into the game and Stanford
had already been penalized 10 yards,
passed for minus four and punted from
a yard deep in its end zone.
The Spartans, on the other hand,
were models of efficiency on their first
possession. Though San lose State had
the ball just 2 minutes, 54 seconds, it
confused the Cardinal defense enough
to move it 60 yards in eight plays and
score the game's first touchdown.
San lose State kicked off, this time
without the aid of the Stanford Band, to
freshman Thomas Henley. He promptly
fumbled the kick, regained possession
and then struggled to the 10 yard line
like a pigeon flying upwind in a hur
ricane.
On first and 10 from the 10, Cottrell
handed off to Scott up the middle. No
gain. On second down, an illegal motion
penalty (just like the one that negated a
46-yard pass play against Illinois) pushed
the Card back to its own five yard line.
On second and 15, Cottrell underthrew
a wide open Tolliver into the hands of
backpedalling defensive back Sherman
Cocroft and the Spartans were knocking
on the end zone door again.
With 9:13 left in the first quarter, Cot
trell had completed three of his four
passes — one to his receiver, one to his
coach and one to the opposing team.
"Steve (Cottrell) was not necessarily on
target today," Wiggin would say later.
Wiggin had more to say at the post
game press conference. "If there's one
thing I'm concerned about, it's the end
zone—getting the damn ball in the damn
end zone." Wiggin paused, answered
another question and then returned to
the original topic. "But dammit, you've
got to get the damn thing in the end
zone."
Damn right, The 1983 version of the
Cardinal offense has sputtered for a
grand total of four TDs, its worst offen
sive output in the first three games of a
season since the 1962 campaign. And
place kicker Mark Harmon hasn't
helped the scoring punch any by missing
75 percent of his field goal attempts.
Part of the problem might be the ab
sence of any sort of effective rushing at
tack. In three games, Stanford ball
carriers have run for 85 yards on 73 at
tempts, a sterling average of 1.16 yards
per carry.
Another viable explanation might be

the penalties. Stanford's three-game
total is 23 infractions for 240 yards; and
don't forget about the hundreds of
yards in gains cancelled by the hankies.
There have been some bright spots,
though. Freshman quarterback |ohn
Paye, while still a diamond in the rough,
has performed admirably at times and is
responsible for three of the Cardinal's
four passing TDs. Senior receiver Mike
Tolliver has caught 24 balls for 290 yards
and is among the nation's leaders.
Another source of optimism has been
the defense. While defensive end Garin
Veris and company haven't stopped
teams when they've had to at the end ot
games, they have held the opposition to

a point total low enough for Stanford to
win.
In three games, the defense is respon
sible for only 53 points, an average of
just over 17 points per game. Stanford
special teams has allowed two touch
downs, a scoring punt return against
Oklahoma and a blocked punt in the end
zone against Illinois.
But for every ray of sun, there seems
to be 10 dark clouds, or in the case of
the first three games, 10 yellow penalty
flags. It's not the big mistakes that are
hurting Stanford. It's all the little ones.
Completions to the coach and the
penalties on the band don't win football
games.
