## Punching the clock and doing it well 
### TIM GRIEVE 
In Thucydides', The
Peloponesian W,ir, Pericles
says that the problem with
giving funeral orations is that
those who never knew the
loved one will say that no one
could be worth the praise you
offer, while those who did
know the dearly departed will
contend that you did not do
him justice. That's just the
problem with reviewing Elvis
Costello's concert in Berkeley
Friday night.
Those of you who missed
the show will think that it
couldn't be as good as I claim
it was, while those of you who
saw it will say it was even bet
ter.
Rock and roll's militant
Woody Allen was in fine form
Friday night. He rocked and
balladeered through an in
credible selection of his caus
tic and painful variety of
music.
Backed by the T.K.O. Horns
and Afrodiziak, Elvis and the
Attractions kicked off the two
and-a-hour set with a rollicking
version of "Let Them All Talk."
After the opener, Elvis in
formed the crowd that he
would be playing songs from
both his latest release "Punch
The Clock" and from his six
previous albums. This an
nouncement had to be a bit of
a relief for fans who had seen
Elvis play Berkeley last year
when he performed songs

from his then-current album
"Imperial Bedroom."
The music from "Imperial
Bedroom" is music for listen
ing, not for dancing, and his
ISB2 concert suffered for it.
Bui Elvis's new tunes — "Let
Them All Talk," "T.K.0.," and
"Everyday I Write The Book,"
among others — are the kind ol
songs that still carry Costello's
painful messages and cutting
remarks, but do so in a more
rock-and-roll framework.
When Elvis did pull out
numbers from "Imperial
Bedroom," he met with mixed
success. "Man Out of Time"
was a high point of the con
cert. "Shabby Doll" wasn't.
Bui there can be no com
plaints about Flvis<, treatment
of his older numbers. With the
T.K.O. horns playing a varia
tion on every T.V. detective
theme you've ever heard and
Afrodiziak providing some
spooky vocals, "Watching The
Detectives" took on a whole
new power.
The horn section provided
a new fullness and drive to the
Attractions' sound, but the At
tractions are still the key to
Costello's concert sound. I'm
not sure how they do it; no
one plays rhythm. The drum
mer bopped in and out
through all the songs, never
bothering to hold down a
beat. The bassist played along
with the melody. World's
funkiest keyboardist Steve

Nieve just threw in a few
notes or some low-key bang
ing whenever it seemed to
fit. And Elvis only plays guitar
sporadically. But it all works
out. Amazing.
And if the music is amazing,
Elvis is just plain incredible.
Costello is the only per
former around with songs
that make tor good reading as
well as good listening. No one
in music today can turn a
phrase like this angry young
man:
"I used to be disgusted,
now I try to be amused."
"I said I'm so happy I could
die. She said drop dead and
left with another guy."
"Do you have to be so cruel
to be callous?"
"We could sit like lovers,
staring in each other's eyes,
but the magic of the moment
might become too much for
you."
Vou get the feeling that in
his 28 years Elvis has had more
garbage dumped on him than
most people. And when he
writes and sings about his
troubles, its not in the pure
sap "Lovin, Touchin,
Squeezin" style. Elvis takes
a sense of humor into his
songs, and that showed

through in the concert Friday
night. After he introduced
"The World and his Wife" as a
"rancid story of family life,"
the crowd chuckled. But, he
warned, "What are you laugh
ing at? It could he your own."
He introduced "Red Shoes '
as "A Stray Cats number
called Pink Pedal Pu-hers'
and "Alison ,is " umn r,iM"d
'Torn Between Iwo Lovers.
But the highest point of the
evening of high points had to
be Flvis's political set. After
"What's so funny about Peace,
Love and Understanding," he
dedicated "Shipbuilding," a
song about a shipbuilder's
son who dies in the Falklands
War, to those who didn't un
derstand the sentiment of
"What's so funny." Next came
a jivey remake of the English
Beat's "Stand Down Mar
garet" which became "Stand
Down Ronnie" in Elvis's hand.
Later in the set Elvis stood
alone at center stage and sang
a new song knocking religion
and government.
All through the concert, Elvis
at least gave the impression
that he means what he says.
Whether he sings about an
other lost love or World War
111 doesn't really matter. What
matters is that he means it.
And it shows.
And that's what makes Elvis
king.
