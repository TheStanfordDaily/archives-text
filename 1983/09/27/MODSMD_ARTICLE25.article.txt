# James Taylor still loves his work, but has he been doing it too long?
## 
### MIKE HALE 
You hope James Taylor is
above it all. It'd been more
than a decade since bweet
Baby James had three top-10
albums in three years and was
obviously the best songwriter
since Dylan (if you didn't
count )oni Mitchell, and a lot
of people didn't); now when
he gives a concert, he plays to
adoring teenagers who think
"Carolina In My Mind" is an
Appalachian folk song and
who only really come alive
when he does "How Sweet It
Is" or "Up On the Roof"
(originals by Marvin Cave and
the Drifters, respectively).
Such was the case, anyway,
in Frost Amphitheater Sept. 17
when Taylor and a band of
L.A. all-stars played a shrewd
mix of old, new and borrowed
tunes before 3500 sun-baked
picnickers. It should be said,
first, that this was a great
show — a flawless two-hour
demonstration of the power
of Taylor's off-hand, winning
personality. He had the crowd
in his pocket (so to speak)
from the moment he walked
on stage alone to open the
show until he walked off alone
after the third encore.
Frost on a sunny afternoon
is such a pretty place (as
Taylor noted several times)
that perhaps the bulk of the
audience didn't mind, or
didn't notice, the show's slick

ness, or Taylor's attitude of
bemused calculation. Several
times he toyed with the
crowd; at one point he an
nounced, "This next song was
written by a good friend of
mine, Carole king," waited
while the applause built tor
"You've Cot a Friend," then
tore into "Up On the Roof."
He didn't bother to explain
that king wrote the tune (but
not the words, thank Cod) of
"Up On the Roof" 10 years
before she wrote "You've Got
a Friend," before a sizable
chunk of the audience was
born.
Taylor is an amazingly gifted
singer and songwriter, but it's
hard to deny that a nose for
fashion has been just as im
portant in his success. His
first albums managed to sound
suitably early-'7os sensitive,
but still had an edge to them (a
trick Jackson Browne, for
one, i r ..till trying to master);
he wasn't giving away any
secrets, like a singer was
supposed to in those days, but
he made it sound like he was.
When the times changed,
Taylor was one of the first to
change with them. He cut his
hair in 1977, and started
covering '60s soul and R & B
tunes as early as 1976. He was,
in the late '70s, one of the first
white singers to have huge
hits with '60s R & B remakes.
Perhaps Taylor has

stagnated during the last few
years because th e crowd
doesn't know where it wants
to be led. When Billy Joel can
get to No. 1 with an embalmed
parody of b I u e - e \ e d soul,
maybe it's time to lie low tor a
while, i hat s what Taylor was
doing at Frost, biding his time,
showing he can do the fash
ionable things as well as
anyone else.
The song selection for the
show was a bit schizophrenic.
From his last six albums—half of
his total output—Tavlor played
only the hit singles; "Shower
the People," "How Sweet It
Is, "Handyman," "Money,"
"Up On the Roof." When it
came to the first six albums, he
left out two of his most
popular songs "Fire and Rain"
and "You Can Close Your
Eyes" but did just about every
thing else you could want:

"Carolina In My Mind,"
"Something in the Way She
Moves," "Sweet Bab\ James,"
"Steamroller," "Mexico,"
''Machine Gun Kelly,''
"Walking Man," "On A
Country Road, "Mud Slide
Slim," "Let It Fall Down,"
"You Got a Friend," and many
others.
The show was a reminder of
both how good an interpreter
of others' songs Taylor is, and
how long it's been since
Taylor wrote a batch of good
songs himself. And to show
that he can practice rock
revivalism as well as Billy Joel
(or Hall and Oates or Bruce
Springsteen, tor that matter),
Taylor ripped through "Sea
Cruise" (Frankie Ford),
"Knock On Wood" (Eddie
Floyd) and "Summertime
Blues" (Mitch Ryder).
Where will Taylor go next? I

hope his band was no indica
tion. Between them, the
people on stage must have had
100 years ot experience back
ing Taylor, Linda Ronstadt,
Jackson Browne, Karl a
Bonoff, et al. You can get the
names off the back of any al
bum produced in L.A. in the
last 10 years: Danny
Dugmore, guitar; Billy Payne
(ex-Little Feat), keyboards;
Lee Sklar, bass; Al Slosser,
drums; and their fearless

leader, Peter Asher, on per
cussion. They were awfully
good (this was a great concert,
remember) but you got the
feeling they could plav these
songs in their sleep. It you
knew all the songs already,
too, it didn't really matter,
The best moments in the
show were the quiet ones.
Taylor alone on stage with his
guitar, or an a capella render
ing of a traditional blues.
After a first encore of

"Summertime Blues" and a
second ot "You've Got a
Friend," Taylor came out
alone and sang "Sweet Baby
James,'' said thank you, and
walked away. Taylor so effort
lessly captivated the crowd —
many of whom had probably
never heard the song — then
and throughout the after
noon, that it almost seems his
failure to make compelling
music so far in the '80s is more
our fault than his.

Frost on a sunny afternoon
is such a pretty place (as
Taylor noted several times)
that perhaps the bulk of the
audience didn't mind, or
didn't notice, the show's slick

ness, or Taylor's attitude of
bemused calculation. Several
times he toyed with the
crowd; at one point he an
nounced, "This next song was
written by a good friend of
mine, Carole king," waited
while the applause built tor
"You've Cot a Friend," then
tore into "Up On the Roof."
He didn't bother to explain
that king wrote the tune (but
not the words, thank Cod) of
"Up On the Roof" 10 years
before she wrote "You've Got
a Friend," before a sizable
chunk of the audience was
born.
Taylor is an amazingly gifted
singer and songwriter, but it's
hard to deny that a nose for
fashion has been just as im
portant in his success. His
first albums managed to sound
suitably early-'7os sensitive,
but still had an edge to them (a
trick Jackson Browne, for
one, i r ..till trying to master);
he wasn't giving away any
secrets, like a singer was
supposed to in those days, but
he made it sound like he was.
When the times changed,
Taylor was one of the first to
change with them. He cut his
hair in 1977, and started
covering '60s soul and R & B
tunes as early as 1976. He was,
in the late '70s, one of the first
white singers to have huge
hits with '60s R & B remakes.
Perhaps Taylor has

stagnated during the last few
years because th e crowd
doesn't know where it wants
to be led. When Billy Joel can
get to No. 1 with an embalmed
parody of b I u e - e \ e d soul,
maybe it's time to lie low tor a
while, i hat s what Taylor was
doing at Frost, biding his time,
showing he can do the fash
ionable things as well as
anyone else.
The song selection for the
show was a bit schizophrenic.
From his last six albums—half of
his total output—Tavlor played
only the hit singles; "Shower
the People," "How Sweet It
Is, "Handyman," "Money,"
"Up On the Roof." When it
came to the first six albums, he
left out two of his most
popular songs "Fire and Rain"
and "You Can Close Your
Eyes" but did just about every
thing else you could want:

"Carolina In My Mind,"
"Something in the Way She
Moves," "Sweet Bab\ James,"
"Steamroller," "Mexico,"
''Machine Gun Kelly,''
"Walking Man," "On A
Country Road, "Mud Slide
Slim," "Let It Fall Down,"
"You Got a Friend," and many
others.
The show was a reminder of
both how good an interpreter
of others' songs Taylor is, and
how long it's been since
Taylor wrote a batch of good
songs himself. And to show
that he can practice rock
revivalism as well as Billy Joel
(or Hall and Oates or Bruce
Springsteen, tor that matter),
Taylor ripped through "Sea
Cruise" (Frankie Ford),
"Knock On Wood" (Eddie
Floyd) and "Summertime
Blues" (Mitch Ryder).
Where will Taylor go next? I

hope his band was no indica
tion. Between them, the
people on stage must have had
100 years ot experience back
ing Taylor, Linda Ronstadt,
Jackson Browne, Karl a
Bonoff, et al. You can get the
names off the back of any al
bum produced in L.A. in the
last 10 years: Danny
Dugmore, guitar; Billy Payne
(ex-Little Feat), keyboards;
Lee Sklar, bass; Al Slosser,
drums; and their fearless

leader, Peter Asher, on per
cussion. They were awfully
good (this was a great concert,
remember) but you got the
feeling they could plav these
songs in their sleep. It you
knew all the songs already,
too, it didn't really matter,
The best moments in the
show were the quiet ones.
Taylor alone on stage with his
guitar, or an a capella render
ing of a traditional blues.
After a first encore of

"Summertime Blues" and a
second ot "You've Got a
Friend," Taylor came out
alone and sang "Sweet Baby
James,'' said thank you, and
walked away. Taylor so effort
lessly captivated the crowd —
many of whom had probably
never heard the song — then
and throughout the after
noon, that it almost seems his
failure to make compelling
music so far in the '80s is more
our fault than his.
You hope James Taylor is
above it all. It'd been more
than a decade since bweet
Baby James had three top-10
albums in three years and was
obviously the best songwriter
since Dylan (if you didn't
count )oni Mitchell, and a lot
of people didn't); now when
he gives a concert, he plays to
adoring teenagers who think
"Carolina In My Mind" is an
Appalachian folk song and
who only really come alive
when he does "How Sweet It
Is" or "Up On the Roof"
(originals by Marvin Cave and
the Drifters, respectively).
Such was the case, anyway,
in Frost Amphitheater Sept. 17
when Taylor and a band of
L.A. all-stars played a shrewd
mix of old, new and borrowed
tunes before 3500 sun-baked
picnickers. It should be said,
first, that this was a great
show — a flawless two-hour
demonstration of the power
of Taylor's off-hand, winning
personality. He had the crowd
in his pocket (so to speak)
from the moment he walked
on stage alone to open the
show until he walked off alone
after the third encore.
