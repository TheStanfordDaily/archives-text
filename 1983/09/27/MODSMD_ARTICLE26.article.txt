Strokes and other
blockages of the blood ves
sels which cause an esti
mated 50 percent of all
hospital admissions in the
United States, can be
treated with a laser cat
heter which vaporizes
obstructions and allows
blood to wash away the
pulverized residue.
The technique, called
laser angioplasty, can
reach areas inaccessible by
conventional surgery, said
Dr. R. Scott Mitchell of the
Cardiovascular Surgery
Department of the Medical
Center.
Plaque deposits of fatty
material are a major source
of artery blockage in
Americans, and plaque

easily burns away under
the intense beam of an ar
gon laser. "The laser
operates in pulses lasting
only a fraction of a
second," said Mitchell. "In
this way, it actually causes
the plaque to vaporize and
explode instead of melting.
As a result, little heat is
transferred to the patient,"
he said.
The center of the cat
heter fires a short range
laser beam at a frequency
that is absorbed well by
plaque and poorly by arte
ry walls.
The outside of the cat
heter serves as an in
flatable balloon within the
artery to flatten or reshape
the atherosclerotic plaque
obstructing a vessel.
