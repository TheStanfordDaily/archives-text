## Running: anorexia analogue? 
### ALEX TARG 
Anorexia Nervosa and long
distance running may seem to
have little in common, but new
evidence suggests that both
young women obsessed with
dieting and compulsive run
ners suffer from the same
problem.
According to Alayne Yates,
M.D. and Kevin Leehey, M.D.
of the Department of Psychia
try at the University of
Arizona Health Sciences Cen
ter, a subgroup of male ath
letes designated as
"obligatory runners" closely
resemble anorexic women in
terms of certain personality
characteristics and personal
background. These include
inhibition of anger, extraor
dinarily high self
expectations, tolerance of
physical discomfort, denial of
potentially serious disability, a
tendency toward depression,
as well as family background
and socio-economic class.
Anorexic women and mem
bers of their families are often
compulsively athletic, and
obligatory runners may dem
onstrate a bizarre preoccupa
tion with food and an unusual
emphasis on lean body mass.
Yates and Leehey, in report
published in the Feb. 3, 1982
edition of The New England
lournal of Medicine explain
both anorexia nervosa and
obligatory running as at
tempts by individuals to es
tablish an identity.
The typical anorexic
woman, according to Yates
and Leehey, "is an elite among
dieters, often receiving com
pliments for her waspish waist
and translucent skin. External
appearance becomes an all
consuming interest; dieting is
her life, and if she cannot
starve herself, she becomes
socially anxious and suffers
from low self-esteem. In order
to control her body and her
life she continues to diet in
spite of debility, which is
denied, and she may eventu
ally die in the service of her
impossible dream."
Yates and Leehey report
similar symptoms in members
of a 60-person group of inter
viewees who consisted of male
marathon and trail runners.
"Certain runners demon
strate a single-minded commit
ment to physical
effectiveness; they may log
more than 100 miles a week.
Running becomes a consum
ing goal that preempts all
other interests in life. When
the obligatory runners in our

sample were unable to run,
they experienced depression
and anxiety about physical
deterioration. Not surpris
ingly, they continued to run in
spite of illness, which was of
ten denied, heart disease or
stress fractures. Such un
reasonable dedication has
resulted in disability or even
death.
"The runners were gener
ally self-effacing, hard
working, high achievers from
affluent families who were un
comfortable with anger and
who characteristically inhib
ited the direct expression of
affect. Their singular commit

ment to running occurred at a
time of heightened anxiety,
depression, and identity diffu
sion.
"Assuming an identity as a
runner served an adaptive
function, providing a difficult
but obtainable goal. The sense
of self was further enhanced
as the runner acquired the
elaborate habits and rituals of
running: special clothing,
shoes, books, diaries, stop
watches, graded exercise for
mats, and friends of a similar
bent with whom they could
compare equipment and run
ning time."

Vates and Leehey continue
"The runner's ideal of less
than 5 percent body fat
represents a degree of
emaciation not commonly
found in our culture, except
among ballet dancers, gym
nasts, models and patients
with anorexia.
"Obligatory runners and
anorexic women must con
tinue to prove themselves by
running or dieting . . . they
are satisfied by moving toward
a goal, not by achieving it. The
endless quest is perpetuated
by the fear that if one stops,
one will cease to exist."

RUNNING ON EMPTY: For some runners the activity could become an obsession. Some ex
perts say the obligatory runner seeks to improve his time at any cost.
