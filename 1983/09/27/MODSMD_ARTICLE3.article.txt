Reagan outlines stance to U.N.

New York—President Reagan outlined his nuclear
arms negotiating position to the United Nations yes
terday and called on the Soviet Union "to reduce the
tensions it has heaped on the world in the past few
weeks" by bargaining seriously.
"The door to an agreement is open, it is time tor the
Soviet Union to walk through it,' the president told
the U.N. General Assembly, referring to the
intermediate-range nuclear force talks in Geneva.
"The United States seeks and will accept any equit
able, verifiable agreement that stabilizes forces at
lower levels than currently exists. We are readv to be
flexible in our approach—indeed, willing to com
promise."

But in one of several digs at the Soviets and re
ferences to their shooting down the Korean Air Lines
jetliner carrying 269 persons Sept. 1, the president
added, "we cannot, however, especially in light of
recent events, especiallv in light of recent events,
compromise on the necessity of effective verifica
tion. Reactions to the Korean airliner tragedy are a
timely reminder of just how different the Soviet's
concept of truth and international cooperation is
from that of the rest of the world. Evidence abounds
that we cannot simply assume that agreements
negotiated with the Soviet Union will be fulfilled.
"Peace cannot be served by pseudo-arms control,
we need reliable reciprocal reductions. I call upon
the Soviet Union today to reduce the tension it has
heaped on the world in the past few weeks and to
show a firm commitment to peace by coming to a
bargaining table with a new understanding of its obli
gations."
