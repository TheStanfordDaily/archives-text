Reagan outlines stance to U.N.

New York—President Reagan outlined his nuclear
arms negotiating position to the United Nations yes
terday and called on the Soviet Union "to reduce the
tensions it has heaped on the world in the past few
weeks" by bargaining seriously.
"The door to an agreement is open, it is time tor the
Soviet Union to walk through it,' the president told
the U.N. General Assembly, referring to the
intermediate-range nuclear force talks in Geneva.
"The United States seeks and will accept any equit
able, verifiable agreement that stabilizes forces at
lower levels than currently exists. We are readv to be
flexible in our approach—indeed, willing to com
promise."

But in one of several digs at the Soviets and re
ferences to their shooting down the Korean Air Lines
jetliner carrying 269 persons Sept. 1, the president
added, "we cannot, however, especially in light of
recent events, especiallv in light of recent events,
compromise on the necessity of effective verifica
tion. Reactions to the Korean airliner tragedy are a
timely reminder of just how different the Soviet's
concept of truth and international cooperation is
from that of the rest of the world. Evidence abounds
that we cannot simply assume that agreements
negotiated with the Soviet Union will be fulfilled.
"Peace cannot be served by pseudo-arms control,
we need reliable reciprocal reductions. I call upon
the Soviet Union today to reduce the tension it has
heaped on the world in the past few weeks and to
show a firm commitment to peace by coming to a
bargaining table with a new understanding of its obli
gations."
Thus, while the words Reagan used to castigate the
Soviets were far less harsh that those he chose im
mediately after they shot down the airliner—he re
frained from calling them barbaric liars—the message
was essentially the same: Soviet leaders cannot be
trusted and they rule by immoral standards.
The Soviet delegation sat stone-faced throughout
Reagan's 23-minute address; applauding neither
when he was introduced nor when he tinished his
remarks.
The vast majority of delegates from other nations
sat attentively through the speech, then gave the
president a lengthy applause at the conclusion, in
contrast to the more lukewarm reception he received
last year after addressing a U.N. disarmament confer
ence.
The most significant reaction to Reagan's address
was the Soviet Union's announcement that it has
postponed until Oct. 4 a speech originally scheduled
for today.
Soviet Ambassador Oleg Troyanovsky would not
comment on Reagan's speech which was praised bv
many delegates, instead, the Soviet delegate told re
porters when he emerged from the assembly that the
main Soviet address, originally to have been given by
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, would be de
layed.
Gromyko refused to come to New York after his
Aeroflot plane was barred from local airports by Gov
ernors Mario Guomo of New York and Thomas Kean
of New lersey on grounds that his safety could not be

guaranteed in the wake ot the Soviet downing ot the
South Korean airliner.
Kremlin: Reagan slanders Soviets
Moscow—The Kremlin yesterday accused Presi
dent Reagan of using his appearance before the U.N,
General Assemblv to slander the Soviet Union and
mislead international public opinion.
In a report from New York, the official Soviet news
agency Tass said the president had delivered a
hypocritical speech" that contained "demagoguerv,
disinformation, and blatant lies."
Ridiculing his talks about peace, it said that the
"aggressive imperialist essence ' of U.S. foreign pol
icy fooled no one.
A noteworthy omission from the initial Tass report
on Reagan's speech was any mention of the new U.S.
proposals on limiting intermediate-range nuclear
weapons in Europe. This appeared to be a sign that
the Kremlin is still digesting the changes in the U.S.
position and has not yet decided how to respond
forn illy.

eration of aircraft capable of carrying nuclear
weapons.

Senate may OK Marines in Beirut
Washington—Achievement of a Lebanon cease-fire
appeared yesterday to be paving the way for congres
sional approval ot a compromise resolution that
would authorize President Reagan to keep United
States Marines in the Beirut area tor an additional 18
months.
As the senate began debating the measure, some
members who had reservations about the idea—among
them Charles Mathias (R-Md), and Barry Goldwater
(K-Ariz) said they now believe the resolution will pass
when it comes up for a vote by the full senate, ex
pected tomorrow.
However, a new cloud was thrown over the com
promise because of congressional concern about re
cent remarks by Secretary of State George Shultz,
Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va) and
House Majority Leader Tip O'Neill (D-Mass) said they
interpreted Shultz's comments to mean that the ad
ministration reserves the right to expand the size,
mission or the time period of the Marine deployment
without congressional approval.
Bvrd said Shultz was indicating that if Congress
passes the resolution, Reagan will sign it them
promptly toss it aside. O'Neill said, "I would expect
the President... to keep his word." He said he will ask
Reagan tor his personal assurance that he intends to
abide by the compromise agreement.
Watt gets 'a little breathing room'
Washington—As his allies launched counteroffen
sives in Congress and at the White House, Secretary

of the Interior James Watt won a brief reprieve yes
terday in his battle to keep his job when the senate
decided to postpone until next week a vote on a
resolution calling for Watt's removal.
The delay in the vote also may have provided what
one senate aide called "a little breathing room" for
Republicans to decide whether Watt has become too
much of a political liability tor the party after he noted
that members of his coal commission included "a
black, a woman, two lews and a cripple."
Department of the Interior officials, who asked not
to be named, said that Watt spent the weekend trying
to assess his position and marshaling political friends
across the nation to tight for him on Capitol Hill and at
the White House.
Despite some indications that Watt's chances for
keeping his job seemed better yesterday than they
did last week, the officials said that the atmosphere in
Watt's spacious offices was "very gloomy" as he went
about routine business.

Senate may OK Marines in Beirut
Washington—Achievement of a Lebanon cease-fire
appeared yesterday to be paving the way for congres
sional approval ot a compromise resolution that
would authorize President Reagan to keep United
States Marines in the Beirut area tor an additional 18
months.
As the senate began debating the measure, some
members who had reservations about the idea—among
them Charles Mathias (R-Md), and Barry Goldwater
(K-Ariz) said they now believe the resolution will pass
when it comes up for a vote by the full senate, ex
pected tomorrow.
However, a new cloud was thrown over the com
promise because of congressional concern about re
cent remarks by Secretary of State George Shultz,
Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va) and
House Majority Leader Tip O'Neill (D-Mass) said they
interpreted Shultz's comments to mean that the ad
ministration reserves the right to expand the size,
mission or the time period of the Marine deployment
without congressional approval.
Bvrd said Shultz was indicating that if Congress
passes the resolution, Reagan will sign it them
promptly toss it aside. O'Neill said, "I would expect
the President... to keep his word." He said he will ask
Reagan tor his personal assurance that he intends to
abide by the compromise agreement.
Watt gets 'a little breathing room'
Washington—As his allies launched counteroffen
sives in Congress and at the White House, Secretary

of the Interior James Watt won a brief reprieve yes
terday in his battle to keep his job when the senate
decided to postpone until next week a vote on a
resolution calling for Watt's removal.
The delay in the vote also may have provided what
one senate aide called "a little breathing room" for
Republicans to decide whether Watt has become too
much of a political liability tor the party after he noted
that members of his coal commission included "a
black, a woman, two lews and a cripple."
Department of the Interior officials, who asked not
to be named, said that Watt spent the weekend trying
to assess his position and marshaling political friends
across the nation to tight for him on Capitol Hill and at
the White House.
Despite some indications that Watt's chances for
keeping his job seemed better yesterday than they
did last week, the officials said that the atmosphere in
Watt's spacious offices was "very gloomy" as he went
about routine business.

Reagan outlines stance to U.N.

New York—President Reagan outlined his nuclear
arms negotiating position to the United Nations yes
terday and called on the Soviet Union "to reduce the
tensions it has heaped on the world in the past few
weeks" by bargaining seriously.
"The door to an agreement is open, it is time tor the
Soviet Union to walk through it,' the president told
the U.N. General Assembly, referring to the
intermediate-range nuclear force talks in Geneva.
"The United States seeks and will accept any equit
able, verifiable agreement that stabilizes forces at
lower levels than currently exists. We are readv to be
flexible in our approach—indeed, willing to com
promise."

But in one of several digs at the Soviets and re
ferences to their shooting down the Korean Air Lines
jetliner carrying 269 persons Sept. 1, the president
added, "we cannot, however, especially in light of
recent events, especiallv in light of recent events,
compromise on the necessity of effective verifica
tion. Reactions to the Korean airliner tragedy are a
timely reminder of just how different the Soviet's
concept of truth and international cooperation is
from that of the rest of the world. Evidence abounds
that we cannot simply assume that agreements
negotiated with the Soviet Union will be fulfilled.
"Peace cannot be served by pseudo-arms control,
we need reliable reciprocal reductions. I call upon
the Soviet Union today to reduce the tension it has
heaped on the world in the past few weeks and to
show a firm commitment to peace by coming to a
bargaining table with a new understanding of its obli
gations."
Thus, while the words Reagan used to castigate the
Soviets were far less harsh that those he chose im
mediately after they shot down the airliner—he re
frained from calling them barbaric liars—the message
was essentially the same: Soviet leaders cannot be
trusted and they rule by immoral standards.
The Soviet delegation sat stone-faced throughout
Reagan's 23-minute address; applauding neither
when he was introduced nor when he tinished his
remarks.
The vast majority of delegates from other nations
sat attentively through the speech, then gave the
president a lengthy applause at the conclusion, in
contrast to the more lukewarm reception he received
last year after addressing a U.N. disarmament confer
ence.
The most significant reaction to Reagan's address
was the Soviet Union's announcement that it has
postponed until Oct. 4 a speech originally scheduled
for today.
Soviet Ambassador Oleg Troyanovsky would not
comment on Reagan's speech which was praised bv
many delegates, instead, the Soviet delegate told re
porters when he emerged from the assembly that the
main Soviet address, originally to have been given by
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, would be de
layed.
Gromyko refused to come to New York after his
Aeroflot plane was barred from local airports by Gov
ernors Mario Guomo of New York and Thomas Kean
of New lersey on grounds that his safety could not be

guaranteed in the wake ot the Soviet downing ot the
South Korean airliner.
Kremlin: Reagan slanders Soviets
Moscow—The Kremlin yesterday accused Presi
dent Reagan of using his appearance before the U.N,
General Assemblv to slander the Soviet Union and
mislead international public opinion.
In a report from New York, the official Soviet news
agency Tass said the president had delivered a
hypocritical speech" that contained "demagoguerv,
disinformation, and blatant lies."
Ridiculing his talks about peace, it said that the
"aggressive imperialist essence ' of U.S. foreign pol
icy fooled no one.
A noteworthy omission from the initial Tass report
on Reagan's speech was any mention of the new U.S.
proposals on limiting intermediate-range nuclear
weapons in Europe. This appeared to be a sign that
the Kremlin is still digesting the changes in the U.S.
position and has not yet decided how to respond
