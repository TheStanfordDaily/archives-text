# Hope show unlikely after planning mix-up
## 
### DAN LABOV Staff writer 
Confusion over a recently
imposed moratoriumon campus
concerts this quarter has
jeopardized a planned Bob Hope
performance originally scheduled
for Nov. 12.
University President Donald Ken
nedy ordered in August the
moratorium on all future concerts,
except those already approved, un
til an evaluation committee can
study the way concerts are
produced on campus and make a re
commendation concerning their
future here.
Although the University initially
made an exception on the concert
ban for Hope's performance, which
was to be held at Maples Pavilion,
the Athletic Department, because of
a misinterpretation of the extent of
the ban, rescheduled Maples for a
basketball scrimmage.
According to Assistant to the
President Bob Hamrdla, Kennedy
announced the moratorium because
of security problems and adminis
trative burdens caused by the con
certs.
For example, at a Grateful Dead
concert at Frost Amphitheatre
police arrested a number of
concert-goers. And University per
sonnel spent an extensive amount of
time organizing the concert.
But Norm Robinson, then-acting
dean of student affairs, assumed the
Hope performance would not cause
the same problems as the Grateful
Dead concert. He conditionally
allowed the Concert Network to
proceed with the show.

preted Kennedy's moratorium to
mean the Hope show was off,
however. Though neither Scott
Davis, the organizer of the Hope
concert and a graduate student in
economics, nor Kennedy was
notified, the Athletic Department
removed the concert's hold on
Maples and rescheduled that date
for a basketball scrimmage and
practices for the women's volleyball
and basketball teams.
Davis drafted a letter to the Ath
letic Department claiming publicity
and "Mr. Hope's promotional an
nouncements and the distribution
of winter sports schedules at the
concert would prove to be a better
promotion for the basketball team
than the scrimmage."
Despite acquiring the support of
Men's Basketball Coach Tom Davis,
Scott Davis was unable to persuade
Andy Geiger, the director of the
Department of Athletics, to allow

Hope's performance.
Geiger said the basketball scrim
mage would be a better promotion
for the team.
"Bob Hope doesn't do anything
for the Athletic Department,"
Geiger said. He could see no reason
why Maples should be "usurped by
the concert. This is a basketball
pavilion - that's the primary purpose
of it. That date is critical for us; it's
just two weeks before the start of
the season."
Geiger told the concert organizer
that his decision was final.
The problems with concerts on
campus precede the current
moratorium and date back to when
concerts were run by the ASSU's
Special Events.
According to Jim McGrath, a
member of the Committee on Con
temporary Entertainment (CoCE)
which handles concert organization
now, the former system had "very
good educational value, as it was
completely student-run and stu
dents could involve themselves in all
aspects of concert production."
However, Special Events became
such a financial burden, losing
more than $100,000 in its final year
of operation, that the ASSU voted in
1980 to disband it.
Now, the CoCE is responsible for
setting policy guidelines for student
groups staging concerts. The group
most often involved in the execution
of specific concert plans is the Con
cert Network, a partnership be
tween the ASSU, the Leland
Stanford junior University March
ing Band, the Chaparral and the
Student Alumni Network.
sionai concert producers like the
Bay Area's Bill Graham Presents are
called in to take care of almost all
the arrangements, while students
perform a few chores for which
they receive small but guaranteed
payments.
Still, many are dissatisfied with
the current system because the
process is less educational.
Davis says there is a lack of coor
dination between the organizations
working on the concerts.
The problems with the present
system have made many question
whether there will be any concerts
here this spring.
But McGrath and Davis say they
are confident a new system can be
worked out.
And Margaret Ann Fidler, assis
tant dean of student affairs, who will
chair the evaluation committee
along with Council of Presidents
member Karol Watson, says"I share
their optimism."
