# A 						Med Center first: lasers clear arteries
## 
### ALEX TARG 
Physicians at the Medical Center, using an opera
tion never before performed on a human, have re
opened a clogged leg artery in a 62-year-old man by
disintegrating the blockage with a laser beam piped
through the patient's blood vessels.

LASER SURGERY NOT IN VEIN: Intense laser
light from a tube inserted into a blocked artery
clears the passage of plaque deposits.

The operation represents a major step in the de
velopment of laser heart surgery and shows great
promise as a surgical procedure.
Unlike a surgeon's knife, which cuts through
tissue from the skin inward, the laser causes little
gross tissue damage. The laser attacks vascular
problems from the inside out, requiring only a small
insertion incision, usually in the femoral artery, ac
cording to Dr. K. Scott Mitchell of the Car
diovasular Surgery Department at the Medical
Center.
Dr. Robert Ginsburg and his associates, Drs.
Mitchell, Diana Guthaner and Norman Shumway,
announced last week that the unidentified patient
was able to leave the hospital a single day after the
operation with only a bottle of aspirin as medica
tion.
According to Ginsburg, clinical assistant profes
sor of medicine in cardiology, studies on
performing the procedure on humans began in
March but were preceded by several years of ex-

perimenls with animals,
human cadavers and
cooperative research in
optical physics.
To blast away the plaque
or blood clot blocking a
vessel, the surgeon inserts
a catheter housing a tiny
quartz fiber-optic filament
about the size of a human
hair. This safely carries the
powerful green beam from
an argon laser to the point
of blockage, Mitchell said.
From the patient's point
of view, the treatment is
not much different from
standard catheterization,
in which a long tube
slightly thicker than a
strand of spaghetti snakes
into the blocked blood ves
sel.
Unlike a normal cat
heter, however, a surgeon
can maneuver the tip of the
laser angioplasty device in
four directions using a spe
cial joystick. In skilled
hands, with the assistance
of X-ray fluoroscopy, the
laser-tipped catheter cuts
precisely even if it is as
much as three feet from the
point at which it enters the
circulatory system,
Mitchell said.
The American Ffeart As
sociation says about 41 mil
lion Americans have heart
or blood-vessel disease
and of those 110,000 un
dergo bypass surgery each
year because of blocked
arteries.
Bypass surgery involves
taking a vein from its nor
mal position in the body
and using it to bypass
clogged vessels.
"Laser angioplasty is not
meant as a replacement
procedure, but if used in
conjunction with others,
the resulting back-up effect
will hopefully raise the
odds of success," said
Ginsburg.
