## Transfers ready for Stanford experience 
### DANA RATLIFF 
As incoming freshmen wandered the campus
sorting through a barrage of information, a
select group of 139 new transfer students were
sharing a similar experience.
Because of thei r familiarity with college life,
transfer students participated in their own
special orientation program. Manx transfer
students appreciated the chance to get ac
quainted with Stanford and its people without
being treated like treshmen.
" I thought the transfer program was great,"
said Suzanne Ericksen, a transfer student from
Brown University. "It's easier getting to know
people because they take more time. I'm glad
we were separated from the freshmen who get
to know each other fast and superficially," she
added.
Unlike Erickson, University of Colorado
transfer Brooke Armstrong said she feels she
is pushed into the freshman category. "I'm not
a freshman. I'm completely and totally lost but I
still want to keep my identity," she said.
Reasons for changing schools are as differ
ent as the students themselves.
"I felt more at home on the West Coast be
cause back at Brown everyone was a lot more
tense. During finals week students would form
lines at 7:30 a.m. to get into the library that
opens at 8 a.m. and all the desks would be
taken," Ericksen said.
Armstrong left Colorado for intellectual
reasons. "I was stagnating in Colorado. There
was an apathetic attitude. At Stanford there is a
higher echelon of intelligence and more
stimulating people and conversations."
Eor many transfer students, coming to Stan

ford was a refreshing change from their previ
ous college experiences. "I fell in love with
Stanford as soon as I came to visit," West Point
transfer John Scoggins said.
Cindy Fallon, a former Oregon State stu
dent, was happy |iist to be out of her old
school. "A lot of people I knew had already
left. The school is reall\ big and impersonal. I
also wanted to get out of Oregon because I al
ways had it in the back of my mind to transfer,"
she said.
Some students, however, come to Stanford
with mixed feelings about their decision to
transfer. "The first week I hated it here be
cause it was new and unfamiliar," said Tufts
University transfer P.ena Hoffman. "I was very
settled at Tufts; it was kind of uprooting. But
later on I began meeting people and recogniz
ing faces at Stanford."
The application process for transfer stu
dents is similar to the freshman application
process. "We look for the same sorts of things
in transfers as in freshmen: strength of aca
demic program, grades earned and extracur
ricular activities," said Parker Beverage, dean
of transfer admissions.
Robert Valdez stopped out of Stanford after
his freshman year and transferred to UC-Santa
Barbara. Now back at Stanford, Valdez, like
other transfer students, expressed dissatisfac
tion with his previous school.
"I had applied only to UCSB and Stanford
out of high school. I left to see what the other
campus would be like. I also left for reasons of
love, but found out that is not a good way to
choose a school,' he said.
