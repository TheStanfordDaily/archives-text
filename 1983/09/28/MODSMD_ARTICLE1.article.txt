# SSRL director approves controversial plan
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH 
The director of the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
yesterday approved a proposal sub
mitted by three major weapons lab
oratories and the University of
California that would involve SSRL.
in nuclear weapons research for
the first time ever.
SSRL Director Arthur
B ie n en s to c k gave the plan,
sponsored by Lawrence Livermore,
Sandia and Los Alamos National Lab
oratories and UC, the go-ahead
after months of deliberation.
The approved plan is a revised
version of a proposal that prompted
protests from faculty and staff mem
bers at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SIAC) and SSRL
and hundreds of students last
spring.
Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost
and dean of graduate studies and
research, must still review, the pro

posal for formal approval.
Lieberman said yesterday that
from what he has seen ot the plan, it
would conform to University
guidelines and would be accepted.

The new proposal, which will in
volve the construction at SSRL of
two new beam lines costing $6.4 mil
lion, specifies that calibration of in
struments for direct use in nuclear
weapons testing will take place at
Lawrence Livermore Laboratories,
not SSRL.
An earlier proposal, written in
Aug. 1982, was vague on the ques
tion of the location of the instru
ment calibration, but it implied the
research would take place here, ac
cording to SLAC researcher Roger
Miller.
The proposal will be funded by
$5.4 million from the Department of
Energy's Office of Military Applica
tions and $1 million from the Uni
versity of California.
A "very, very small" percentage
of the research carried out under
the new plan would have direct ap
plication to nuclear weapons re
search, Bienenstock said. He said

that the weapons laboratories and
UC will use the beam line two-thirds
of the time, while the remaining
one-third will be reserved for gen
eral use by SSRL.
None of the research will be clas
sified, in accordance with
University policies.
Students and faculty who oppose
the proposal, surprised by
Bienenstock's announcement, said
yesterday they were pleased SSRL
would not be responsible for in
strument calibration, but pointed
out that funding for the proposal
would still come from weapons lab
oratories.
The controversy over the pro
posal started in lanuary when 15
faculty and 280 staff members at
SLAC signed a petition opposing the
plan because it would involve re
search on nuclear weapons.
Students formed a large group to
oppose the proposal and support

the workers at SLAC. The group
gathered thousands of signatures
on a petition opposing all nuclear
weapons-related research on
campus.

University President Donald Ken
nedy responded to two subsequent
student protests by reaffirming a
University policy that the project
could be judged on only its scien
tific merit.
Bienenstock, in an interview with
The Daily yesterday, echoed Ken
nedy's statements. He said that
though it was "difficult" for him to
make a decision on the proposal, he
only considered the project based
on its "contributions to basic sci
ence."
He said, "I was sensitive to the
many people who did not want to
participate in weapons research.
But most of the proposal involves
basic science. To stop that work is
to stop an attempt to build up our
ability to understand nature, and I
can't bring myself easily to stand in
the way of furthering the under
standing of nature."
