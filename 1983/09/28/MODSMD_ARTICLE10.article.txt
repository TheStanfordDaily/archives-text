# Students weigh advantages against disadvantages
## Computer registration gets mixed reviews 
### HARA LEVY Staff writer 
The new computers used at
registration for signing up for
courses were given mixed
reviews by students. While
some students thought the
computers made signing class
lists less time-consuming and
easier, others felt that the
machines only complicated
matters.
But despite some snags in
ihe system, Lynn Carlyle, in
formation and registration of
ficer, said the computer
system is much better than
previous ways of signing up
for c lasses.
"The main motivation be
hind implementing the com
puter system," Carlyle said,
"is that it created a means by
which one could sign up for
courses in one stop. Hope
fully, this would decrease the
time spent in lines."
Carlyle added that the new
system makes it much easier
for freshmen to sign up for
Ihe required Western Culture
and English classes.
Although this one-stop

technique has posed prob
lems, Carlyle stressed that the
disadvantages should be ba
lanced with the benefits.
I hose students pleased with
the new computer system said
they only waited in the class
sign-up line for about 20
minutes. Many students were

amazed that they only had to
contend with one relatively
short line.
Several students did com
plain about inefficient and un
fair practices. After waiting in
line for a half-hour, one un
dergraduate was annoyed
with some of the"course
reservationists", or computer

operators, who were not
familiar with the system.
"The system went down
right when I got there on
Monday," said Kim Crowdley,
"and it took a half-hour to
bring the system up with
everyone waiting in a very
long line. And, after all that, I
was told I was number 45 on

the waiting list."
Carlyle said that Monday
there was a slowdown of com
puter response time, causing
a need to make changes in
programming and procedure.
Within one hour of the
changes the lines dwindled.
A major flaw in the use of
the computers in registering

for courses was that the us
hers and course reser
vationists did not check
permits to register for those
trying to beat the system by
signing up for classes before
their scheduled time.
One course reservationist
complained that there was not
enough checking and secur
ity, allowing people to sign up
for classes before they were
allowed.
In spite of problems,
Carlyle said, "On Tuesday be
tween Hand 12 a.m., 1 bO3 stu
dents went through, and the
lines were only five deep at
each terminal."
Most of the course reser
vationists felt that the system
was a big improvement over
last year.
Carlyle hopes that the new
system, with some more work,
will be a "prototype for other
on-line systems" which will be
able to achieve more inter
active programming and add
other students services like
financial aid and admissions,
making the registration
process less painful.
