## Viewpoint: Brooks Duncan The 						real tragedy of KAL 007 
### 
By the time you read this, I will be Hying over the
lapan Sea, out of the United States and on to Seoul.
I think I will be over )apanese waters and then into
South Korea, but it's hard to tell. It's hard to tell the
difference between North and South Korean air space.
I can't tell the difference between a North Korean and
South Korean or a Japanese and Russian military base
from 30,000 feet. They all look alike to me.
I can't tell the difference even at 1000 feet. In the
middle of the night, I'm sure it would be even harder.
All I know is what they tell me. I just know the route
that's written on the airlines map.
I don't know why they switch to a new crew during a
refueling stop, or why there is a delay. I don't know
whether the pilot's communications systems are really
working or not. I don't know if there are military per
sonnel on board. I don't know if there is a U.S. recon
naissance plane overhead, or if my flight is
synchronized with a U.S. satellite.
I don't know if the lights outside my window are So
viet fighters or stunt planes. All I know is that people
are trying to sleep, and the stewardesses have asked us
to close the shades and turn off our lights if we don't
need them. I don't even know if there are Defense De
partment cameras strapped to the plane. There are lots
of things they don't want me to know.

My government says it is a govern
ment by the people and for the
people. It is elected and it is ac
countable. It says it is protecting me
by not telling me everything.

Of course no reasonable person would think about
causing harm to me, even if my plane might seem like it
was on a spy mission, even if my government called his
country all sorts of bad names, even if my government
seemed to keep building more and more missiles di
rected right at his home town and planned to build
even more horrifying weapons to deploy in space, and
even if my government and his government didn't seem
too interested in talking about really stopping all of
this.
The funny thing, though, which isn't really so funny,
is that my own government said it would do this. It says
it has been doing this for years, without ever having
said a word before.
It reminds me of the time that my government sent
people into the desert to watch atomic weapons tests,
without telling them that they would probably get can
cer 20 years later, or the time it spread a disease in
New Haven, just to experiment with biological warfare
techniques in urban areas, or the time they kept saying
that "peace is at hand" or that victory was near in Viet
nam while they sent more college age men to their
deaths.
It reminds me of the time that my government said
that the Russians savagely downed a Korean commer
cial jet and then it played a segment of a tape from a So

viet pilot in order to shock the world. My government
did this before it told me a little more about what was
on the rest of the tape, and before it explained why the
Russian military might have been a little worried.
My government says it is a government by the people
and for the people. It is elected and it is accountable. It
says it is protecting me by not telling me everything.
The Soviet government also says it is a people's go
vernment, elected by the masses and serving the
masses. It protects the masses by not telling them
everything, too.
Don't misunderstand. I think that the United States is
the greatest country in the world. I love America and I
think our government has done and will continue to do
great things.
It's just that in order for government to work the
way it's supposed to, citizens need to have enough in
formation to submit their own suggestions and to par
ticipate in the policy process. Democracy has to be for
the people and by the people.
I do not know whether the United States is to blame
at all for the loss of life on Korean Flight 007.
Even if it were, and even if it were supporting a
spying mission and risking civilian lives, I can not say
that this policy is definitely wrong, either.
I might very well choose to risk my life if I believed it
was the only way to verify Soviet compliance with arms
treaties and to insure world peace.
I am not saying that the decision makers in our go
vernment don't believe they are doing the right thing
when they risk other people's lives, either.
I am saying that I would like my democratic, elected,
responsive government to tell me more of the truth.
Myths about evil empires are great fun to listen to, but
I would rather just have the facts, thank you.
The one fact I do know is that the fate of the Korean
airliner reveals a tragedy much greater than the loss of
some 300 lives.
The tragedy is that two great nations, in an incident
of international crisis, place no faith in disclosure to
their own people or to submitting to an investigation
or mediation through the United Nations, a body
which they say they created to help bring about world
peace.
The tragedy is that the Cold War lottery takes un
suspecting lives every day as both societies bankrupt
their economies building weapons.
The tragedy, too, is that this sad incident should be
used by both nations to further increase tensions
when they both need most to sit down and talk openly
to each other, to their own people, and to the world
community.
The terrible, horrible truth of this incident is that
both nations are already well past the point of worry
ing whether or not they can gamble with civilian lives in
a time of peace.
There are a lot of things about foreign policy I don't
know and a lot of things no government is going to tell
me. But there is one thing I know for sure.
As cheerful as I am now, I won't look very cheerful
when I wash up on the Japanese shores.
I don't want to be a pawn anymore.
