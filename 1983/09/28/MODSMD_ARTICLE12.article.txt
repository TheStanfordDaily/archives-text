## Palo Alto proposal threatens the first amendment rights of cable television 
### 
Palo Alto city government has
been considering allowing cable TV
in Palo Alto off and on for the past
10 years. Lately it appears that some
decision may be reached soon.
Cable is a relatively new technol
ogy in terms of the kinds and quality
of communications that can now be
transmitted on it. As a result, the full
implications for our basic civil
liberties of government regulation
and control over cable have been
somewhat neglected.
Cable systems are entitled to the
same free speech rights possessed
by newspapers and by private
citizens. A newspaper takes words
and pictures and delivers them to
subscribers via printing presses
and delivery routes. A cable system
takes words and pictures and
delivers them electronically via
cable.
I believe that policies currently
proposed by the Palo Alto govern
ment and the governments of neigh
boring cities with which Palo Alto is
cooperating are not in accord with
our Bill of Rights and threaten the
First Amendment rights of cable
operators.
First, Palo Alto and the other Mid
peninsula cities should halt their
plans to impose special burdens on
cable systems. These burdens are
distressingly similar to the colonial
stamp tax on newspapers that our
ancestors rebelled against at the
time of the American Revolution.
In the 19305, Louisiana Gov. Huey
Long imposed a state tax on the
newspapers that opposed him. The
U.S. Supreme Court held correctly
that such a special burden on
speech and press is a violation of
the First Amendment. The Palo Alto
city government's requirement that
whoever gets its permission to in
stall cable in the area must also pro
vide expensive services and
facilities (access channels, extensive
free use of the cable system by the
city government, etc.) is imposing a
modern-day stamp tax on press
freedom.
The special, costly burdens that
city government policies will impose
on cable are precisely the reason
that Viacom recently dropped out of
the cable bidding.
Second, like newspapers, cable
systems should not be required to
provide guaranteed access. The Su
preme Court in the Miami FHerald
case pointed out that a newspaper
cannot constitutionally be forced by
the government to print anything

the newspaper does not want to
print.
Implementing guaranteed access
always and inevitably means that
whenever a controversy arises over
what should be communicated the
government imposes its decision on
the media.
Cable systems, like newspapers,
must not be forced to transmit ma
terial they do not want to transmit.
Yet the guaranteed access policies
proposed by the Palo Alto city go
vernment would do exactly that.
Guaranteed access ultimately makes
government officials into editors
and destroys the independence of
the press.
Third, you cannot have freedom
of speech when the government
awards a monopoly to someone to
transmit the speech. This is as if the
City Council granted to the Oakland
Tribune or the San Jose Mercury-
News the exclusive franchise to
deliver newspapers in Palo Alto. In
stead of a single monopoly franchise
for cable, awarded by the city go
vernment, we should have open
entry for all cable systems wishing
to offer their wares to the people
living in this area.
Fourth, you cannot have freedom
of speech if you have government
control of programming. Palo Alto's
cable plan is one of the most blatant
violations of the First Amendment in

the country. The city's franchise ap
plication form (called a "Request
for Proposals") says explicitly that
the philosophy of the cable oper
ator will figure importantly in the
granting of the franchise. Controll
ing speech on the basis of the phi
losophy of the speaker is a direct,
overt assault on the First Amend
ment.
In addition, a new agency created
by Midpeninsula city governments
will decide what groups obtain time
on the public access and institu
tional access channels and who ob
tains prime-time slots. It may also
oversee all local programming — this
has not yet been decided. This
agency may, as it emerges, be pre
sented as a citizens' commission or a
community agency detached from
the regular government bureau
cracy. But in fact, this agency will
have governmental powers and will
control what goes on the cable
medium.
The currently proposed cable TV
policies for Palo Alto and the neigh
boring communities are profoundly
antagonistic to the First Amendment
and the fundamental rights and
liberties of all of us. These policies
should be reversed before it is too
late.
