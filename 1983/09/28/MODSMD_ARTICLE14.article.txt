## Student boredom is ignored 
### 
Boredom; it strikes without war
ning. At Stanford, it spreads faster
than a social disease. It is a disease
without a single cure.
Some forms of it can be
prevented, however. In fact, for a
limited group of victims, Stanford
University has the cure, but it won't
release it.
The problem is undergraduate
boredom. When you place a group
of talented, intellectually curious,
self-motivated and creative people
(the kind that Dean Fred admits)
into an educational structure which
is regimented, competitive,
packaged and poorly tailored to in
dividual needs, you end up with
hundreds of frustrated young
people who will do almost anything
they can to escape educational activ
ities whicVi include or remind them
of course work. If you ask them
why, they will tell you that they are
bored.
This is one reason why several
public school systems in the country
have begun to develop special pro
grams for the gifted. Unfortunately,
these programs have not filtered up
to institutions of higher education
like Stanford.
What happens, very simply, is that
Stanford students, eager to pursue
their intellectual interests, enter
the school to find their freedom of
choice immediately limited. They
find that they must take certain
courses in order to meet distribu
tion requirements. They must fulfill
all of the specific and often picayune
requirements of each course. They
must pick a major and then submit
themselves to the requirements of
their departments.
Of course, if you are a faculty
member or an administrator, you
will argue that this is for students'
own good. If on the other hand, you
are a typical Stanford undergradu
ate, or if you talk to or live with one
or more, you will realize that un
dergraduates are entirely preoc
cupied by these requirements. In
fact, they spend more free time
talking about the process of their
education (meeting these require
ments) than they do about the con
tent of their education, and even
more time trying to escape it al
together. It used to be safe to speak
of notions like the "love of knowl
edge" at a university, but today no
tions like these are quickly erased
from an undergraduate's vocabu
lary.
Amusingly, the problem of under
graduate boredom is news to no
one, yet most educators, ad

ministrators and students, are so
complacent as to pretend either that
it does not exist, or that there is no
solution. The University points to
the successes of the student body,
as well as its annual questionnaire
to seniors on the value of their edu
cation, in blinding itself to the prob
lem. Those who do admit that there
is a problem often call it "apathy,"
which does little more than to
rename it in a form which makes it
seem inevitable.
In the university, tension arises
between, on the one hand, the uni
versity's endorsement of academic
and intellectual freedom (i.e. its
belief in a free marketplace of ideas,

and on the other hand, its imposi
tion of requirements and its own
determination of what education is,
as well as what is best for its stu
dents.)
Two events earlier this year high
light this conflict: the release of the
Statement of University Mission,
and the "Majors Event" held late
last spring.
What is particularly fascinating
about the "Majors Event" is that the
speeches of the University's presi
dent and provost at that event sug
gest that there is a tremendous
strain between the educational
ideals which some of the Univer
sity's highest officers hold, and the
educational system which is
supposed to reflect those goals.
At "A Majors Event," I he Daily
quoted Provost Albert Hastorf ur
ging students to "study what you
find interesting, exciting and
demanding and not what you think
will be economically rewarding."
Donald Kennedy added, "What
you do in your undergraduate life
seldom relates to what you'll do af
terwards. The most educated
people aren't doing what they are
trained for, but make their intelli

gence known in sometimes obscure
ways."
It is very ironic that both men
should have made these statements
at "A Majors Event," because the
ideal they suggest — freedom to pick
and choose one's studies without
concern for developing a pre
professional specialty — is precisely
the reason why there is no reason
to have majors at all.
Perhaps the idea of a major is
such a sacred cow that neither man
could suggest slaying it. Philosophi
cally, both seem committed to the
ideal of a liberal arts education
which allows students to pursue in
terests and develop skills in a wide
variety of areas in order to develop
several capacities.
If Stanford's goal is to encourage
students to develop skills in a wide
variety of areas and to obtain a
broad literacy in as many fields as
possible in preparation for an un
certain future, a major prevents
this. In fact, the University's
response to the argument against
eliminating distribution require
ments is that students will refuse to
look beyond their narrow interests
in choosing courses. Ironically, the
argument against eliminating majors
is that students will never narrow
their interests.
What lies behind both ,»rguments
is a very negative vision of both
higher education and student judg
ment.
If Stanford's goal is to allow stu
dents to indulge in their intellectual
curiousities and to pursue knowl
edge in the ways that educators
have suggested to encourage the
gifted, it is not doing this through
artificial requirements.
If it is to create an elite with a
shared set of experiences and
values, a preference for bureau
cratic order, authoritarian dis
cipline, and a commitment to
regulations and specialization
rather than skills, independence,
and creativity, it fortunately hasn't
gone far enough in copying the So
viet and some European models.
It is more likely that the University
is committed to none of these. Be
cause the school has no defined
educational mission, what has
evolved is a system supported by
various parochial interests. Those
who have the most to gain from dis
tribution requirements are those
departments which can classify
themselves as required, thus ensur
ing a steady flow of students and
funds. Those who have the most to
gain from major requirements are
not students but departments who
can reward and punish professors
by requiring certain courses, and
which can shape students' outlooks
by narrowing their way of thinking.
Those who have the most to lose
are citizens of the world communi
ty. We all lose when some of our
best minds become so frustrated
that they turn away from learning.
We all lose when promising young
people cynically learn to accept
regimentation and specialization.
There is a cure for this under
graduate boredom. It is to increase
intellectual freedom by replacing
requirements with guidance, distri
bution requirements with distribu
tion guidelines, and major
requirements with optional con
centrations. This is only a first step
towards unleashing intellectual en
ergy toward the creation of a more
broadly educated and creative soci
ety.
You might say this is a small
part of the educational mission u< a
great university.
