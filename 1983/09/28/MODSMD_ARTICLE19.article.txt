# White Shoes and the Successful Engineer
## 
### 
Three-martini lunches, slick phrases, fat
expense accounts. UGH! No self-respecting
engineer wants anything to do with selling,

right? Well consider this: recent
research shows that the most success
ful, innovative high tech companies
have a strong orientation to the custo
mer. And Megatest has an on-the-job
training program for engineers who
want a career path toward leadership in
innovation.

The Death of a Salesman...
We call it Test Engineering. It's not
sales, but rather working with sales
engineers to directly serve our custo
mers' technical application needs.
Short of being a test pilot, it's about the
most exciting, fast-paced job you can
get: the front line of high-tech business
competition, in a world-wide arena. It takes

intelligence, expertise and a full deck of cards

The Birth of a Career...
Test Engineering is an excellent way to gain a
broad perspective on a growing world-wide
market. You'll learn incredibly sophisti-

cated automated test equipment for
state-of-the-art VLSI components from
the user's end. It's an outstanding
springboard toward challenges in
research and development, product
marketing, sales engineering, 0r...
some of our best engineers stay

hooked on Test Engineering.
Mega who?
We're the fastest growing innovator in
Automatic Test Equipment. We're very
good at a lot of things, including having
a good time. If you're a smart EE and
would like to hear more we'll be on
campus â€” Tuesday October 11, at the
Career Planning and Placement Center.
