# A 						toss-up between work and fun
## 
### SHELLY WENTKER Staff writer 
Walking past the Oval
during lunchtime, one may
see people juggling and
wonder if perhaps the circus
is coming to Stanford.
It's not.
Those are members of the
juggling club out practicing
their art.
The club was started about
seven or eight years ago by
Marty Frost, a systems
programmer in the Computer
Science Department.
Frost is currently the head
of the club and its "driving
force," according to member
Craig Smith.
Frost and another member
may go to an international jug
gling convention and com
pete, Smith said. "The rest of
us pretty much do it for fun,"
he added.
Smith said that he and Laura
Novick, both psychology stu
dents, got involved in juggling
through their psychological
research.

"We were looking for a task
with a lot of non-verbal stuff,"
Smith said.
Smith and Novick have been
juggling for three and one years
respectively and joined the
club when Frost saw them
"feebly attempting" to juggle.
FHe invited them to join the
club to improve their skills,
Smith said.
Since then, they have been
juggling with the club which
began practicing in the Oval at
lunchtime about two years
ago.
"We're typically juggling as
a group," Novick said, per
forming "passing patterns"
which are routines involving
several people juggling indi
vidually in addition to passing
clubs or balls to each other.
Although there are estab
lished routines that the group
does, there is definitely room
for individual creativity. Smith
said that the best evidence of
this is the rule he believes all
drummers (and jugglers) live
by: You can do whatever you
want to as long as you're there

on the beat. In other words,
one can juggle as he pleases as
long as he passes at the right
time and in the right manner.
"In between the beats, it's
free time," he said.
This sense of timing is an es
sential element of juggling, ac
cording to Smith. "The most
important part of juggling is to
be patient and not panic," he
said. FHe added that the novice
juggler must learn to wait for
the balls, clubs, or whatever
he's juggling to go up and
come down."Things will be up
in the air and you have to get
used to that," he said.
Members of the club are
willing to teach people or help
those with some experience
improve their skills. Smith said
there is currently a bus driver
who approached them in the
Oval and is now learning to
juggle.
Others are not so
responsive to the jugglers.
"Most people, I think, are
afraid to bother us. Usually
they just watch," Novick said.
FHe added that a large majority

of their audience is composed
of tourists who take pictures.
"One person even sent us
the pictures," said club mem
ber Tony Ahrens.
People who do approach
the jugglers and speak to them
often have the same question:
Why do they juggle?
Smith and Ahrens juggle be
cause of the challenges it
presents. "You can always
learn something new," Ah
rens said.
Smith echoed this senti
ment, explaining that he,
Novick, and Ahrens are about
equal in juggling ability and
that the more experienced
members of the club are al
ways "pushing us."
Novick, on the other hand,
enjoys juggling because she
finds it relaxing.
"One thing that's really
good is it takes a lot of con
centration so you can clear
your mind. It's a good way to
keep from worrying about
other things because you
need to pay attention to jug
gling," she concluded.
