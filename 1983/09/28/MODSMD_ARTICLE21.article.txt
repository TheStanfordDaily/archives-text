# Many ASSU services available

Students who are in a legal scrape or who
yearn for a new t-shirt can turn to the ASSU
for help.
Student-run services provided by the
ASSU include the Legal Counseling Service,
the T-Shirt Service, the Linen Service and
the Recycling Center. The Linen Service
provides sheets and towels for freshmen at
a reasonable price. Freshmen order the
linen during the summer and then pick it up
during orientation.
Approximately 800 students use the ser
vice each year, allowing it to do quite well
financially, manager Anne Padrnos said.
The Recycling Service operates a center
for recyclable material and works to
promote campus awareness of recycling.
Because the service is used primarily by fac
ulty and staff, it usually operates at a loss.
This year, representatives of the Recy
cling Service will be in each dorm to build
awareness among the students, and next
year the University will help to fund the
nroiert. The Recycling Service is managed

by students Henry Bankhead, Wade Cray
and Jan Hill.
The T-Shirt Service sells a variety of Stan
ford shirts, including a Dean Fred "Creat
model and one proclaiming FHarvard the
"Stanford of the East." The service also
prints custom shirts for dorms, clubs and in
tramural teams.
The T-Shirt Service sells a large number
of shirts to tourists and visitors and also
does well financially, manager Rudy Schlos
ser said.
Finally, the Legal Counseling Service is an
independent project that provides consulta
tion and referral services for students and
their families. The service is funded by a fee
assessment and can help students with such
things as how to write contracts and what to
do in the case of an accident.
Any profit that these projects generate is
used to fund other student services. Mindy
Basham, the Student Financial Manager,
oversees all these projects and handles the
ASSU's other financial services.
