/ never realized how much time patients
spend looking at the ceiling. The perspec
tive changes right away.

As a canter survivor I ap
proac li life \\ith a new tenacitv
and fervor, as it someone sud
denly turned up the power of
all my senses," said Dr.
Fit/hugh Mullan, who spoke
recently at the Medical Cen
ter.
In a talk sponsored by the
division of radiation therapy,
Mullan told the standing

room-only crowd what it was
like to be on the receiving end
of health care. "I never
realized, he said, "how much
time patients spend looking at
the ceiling. The perspective
i hanges right away."
Mullan, author of Vital
Signs: A Young Doctor's
Struggle with Cancer, an ac
count based on his own expe
rience as a cancer patient,

said that he sees three
"stages" through which a typi
cal cancer patient passes. He
calls these stages pain/fear,
compromise and re-entry.
"The pain/fear stage is at the
beginning, the compromise
stage is during the extended
survival' time following acute
treatment, and the re-entry
stage is during the time of
permanent survival' or

'cure'," he said.
I he last two stages, the pe
riods of extended and per
manent survival, are the most
difficult for the cancer patient
to deal with, according to
Mullan. "There are no role
models who come to see you
and say, 'I struggled with this
disease and made it,' as there
are for patients who have had
mastectomies or colostomies.''
Mullan also cited the
paucity of support groups for
cancer patients, a lack he
views as serious. "Here, at a
major medical center, you
have several groups like that,
but in most places they are
few, far between and not well
known to I he people who
need them."
Some of the cancer victim's
most difficult problems result
from disease-related changes
in body image, role in society
and family, and sexuality, said
Mullan. "In our 'Pepsi
generation, Sea-and-Ski
world,' there is seemingly no
place for people who are not
young and perfect . . . though
who among us is?," he said.
Mullan described the
"Thank God It's the Flu"
Syndrome, wherein the
"cured" cancer patient fears
that every ache and pain is the
cancer recurring. "Then you
find that it's only the flu, and
say, 'Thank Cod' "
On a more serious note,

Mullan talked of issues of
employment and insurance,
both of which are areas of
great difficulty for the current
or past cancer patient It is of
ten difficult, it not impossible,
for the cancer patient to find
employment, or insurance
coverage," he said.
"Although, here in Califor
nia, you have some of the best
laws in the country regarding
this type of discrimination,
they are seldom enforced,'
he added.
Mullan, who is chief medical
officer in the office of medical
applications of research for
the National Institutes of
Health, encourages those in
volved with cancer patient
treatment to think more about
the many types of problems
the patient must overcome,
not just the disease.
Mullan hopes more pro
grams to help cancer patients
cope with social, emotional
and financial stresses will be
established. He praised such
efforts as the American Can
cer Society's "I Can Cope"
Program, and patient/family
support groups, such as Stan
ford's group for cancer, lym
phoma and leukemia.
"The cancer patient feels a
great sense of isolation," said
Mullan. "Participation in a
group of other people dealing
with the same problem can
make all the difference."
