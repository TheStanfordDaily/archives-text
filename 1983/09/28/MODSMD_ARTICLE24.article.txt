# Coffee House works to improve communication, profits

### CAROL PUTNAM 
; When the Coffee House
first opened in the late 19605,
it was a popular hangout for
anti-establishment students.
Later, it became a University
operated commissary and
since 1980 it has been owned
and operated by students.
Things in the early days
were easier than they are
now. I he Coffee House is cur
rently struggling with new
and complex problems.
Maintaining continuity in
an organization with over 100
part-time student employees
and a board of directors
which changes every year is a
challenging and often difficult
task.
The Coffee House became
an independent corporation
in May 1980 when the ASSU
drew up a proposal and
gained a contract from Tresid
der for a new student-owned
and operated coffee house.
Tresidder has a five-year
contract with the Coffee
House in which Tresidder
provides the organization
with space, utilities, custodial
services, remodelling, capital
equipment and general mar
keting support. In return,
Tresidder receives a
percentage of gross profits
from the Coffee House as rent
and reserves the right to have

final authority on operating
hours, pricing, new items and
management staff.
The emphasis on heavy stu
dent involvement was "critical
to Tresidder's acceptance of
the ASSU contract," said
Nancy Howe, manager of
Tresidder's food service.
Trying to employ as many stu
dents as possible, however,
has caused unique problems
in running the Coffee House.
The high turnover rate on
the board of directors and at
the employee level creates
daily challenges in communi
cation and in fully under
standing the needs of the
Coffee House.
"I've always had good daily
communication with the Cof
fee House manager," Howe
said.
But communication with the
Coffee House board of direc
tors has been difficult. "The
turnover rate is good for stu
dent employment, but we
need to minimize the up
heaval, Howe said, adding that
she would like to see the
board develop more of a his
tory.
The upper echelons of the
Coffee House may have a hard
time, but communication at
the employee level is even
more challenging. The Coffee
House employs over 100 part

time students, whose hours
and work schedules change at
least every quarter.
"The constant transitions
and lack of routine make any
change in policy or service a
major undertaking, said Doug
Spalding, a part-time shift
manager at the Coffee House.
Last fall, the combination of
a change in service and new
staff resulted in a 14 percent
decline in transactions from
Sept. 1 to Oct. 31.
In an effort to combat the
communication problem,
manager Gary Verzani is in
cluding a newsletter with em
ployee paychecks. He and
assistant manager Keith Pikus
have also set up a better chain
of communications, including
job descriptions, which will
provide the employees with a
better understanding of their
jobs.
"This aspect of communica
tions is most important," Pikus
said.
He and Verzani are also
planning "informal g e t -
togethers" with the staff and
board of directors to stim
ulate more communication
among employees at all levels.
Financial problems as well
as communication problems
can also be linked to the con
stant transitions within the or
ganization. Coffee House

management constantly
struggles to maintain a bal
ance between their commit
ment to student employment
and financial need.
Taxes, payroll and training
for each of the employees are
a major drain on revenue, and
extra time and effort spent on
communication adds to this
drain. Mandatory meetings
were once held each quarter,
but they cost between $600
and $800, because of labor re
quirements to pay employees
for mandatory meetings and
thus were discontinued.
The Coffee House is cur
rently somewhere between
$50,000 and $70,000 in debt,
bookkeeper Farr Hashimi
said. Approximately $35,000 of
this amount is the result of un
derpricing and additional ex
penditures when the new
service went in last fall.
The other $15,000 to $35,000
is an accumulation of debts to
the ASSU, the University Com
missary, and other vendors.
While the ASSU and Tresid
der would like to see
repayment before the five
year contract is up in 1985,
Verzani said, he feels "no
pressure" from either party.
But Howe said financial suc
cess is "very important" in de
termining whether the Coffee
House will retain its current

student-run status.
Employees and customers
alike had difficulty adjusting to
the opening of the outside
patio and implementation of
the new service, which in
volved delivery of food to the
table after order forms were
filled out. While the purpose
of the new ordering method
was to eliminate lines and
streamline service, employees
had not been adequately
prepared for the change and
could not explain it to the cus
tomers.
As a result, Howe said, the
Coffee House lost many fac
ulty and staff customers. Al
though the order cards were
altered several times during
the year, customers still com
plained that they needed "a
Stanford degree" to figure it
out.
Another major change took
place in June when Steve
Weiss, manager of the Coffee
House since its incorporation
in May 1980, left to start his
own restaurant.
Because Verzani was able
to take over during the rela
tive calm of summer, the
transition between the two
was smooth.
Changes in service this fall
came as a response to custom
er comments that they miss the
"old" system of having a sand
wich maker. Verzani sees the
change as a way to combine
the good points of the old ser
vice with those of the "new

old" service.
"The new service," he says,
"is not a dramatic, drastic
structural change. It's mainly
an expansion of service." Fie
also emphasises that "what we
have come up with is not
final."
Verzani plans to provide
more programming and enter
tainment as well. In fact, ac
cording to bookkeeper
FHashimi, there is a trend
showing that the Coffee
House has made money since

February and is beginning to
pay off the debt. This trend is
partly "because we increased
the price of goods we are sel
ling in February," Fiashimi
said, adding, "The quality of
the food has not changed."
While financial success is
important, the Coffee F-louse
still strives to satisfy the highly
critical clientele of the Stan
ford community.
'The customer should de
termine the service," FHowe
said.


STUDENTS AT WORK: Over 100 students work part time at
the Coffee House each quarter. Maintaining continuity and
efficiency within the organization presents a constant chal-
