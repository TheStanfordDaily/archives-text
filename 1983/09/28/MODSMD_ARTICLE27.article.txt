### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
The University of Nevada-
Las Vegas Running Rebels
men's soccer team lived up to
its reputation as a fast team
and put another dent in Stan
ford's record, lowering it to
4-2-1.
Before the game, Coach
Nelson Lodge warned his
team that UNLV's Rob Ryerson
was a scoring machine. Sure
enough, Ryerson put the ball
home in the first 10 minutes of
the game while his younger
brother finished Stanford off
with a breakaway goal in the
second half.
The guy (R. Ryerson) was
lust unmarked in front of the
goal," explained Cardinal
goalie Willie Burkhardt. Prob
ibly one of the reasons he was
left unmarked was because
the ball was a field away.
It took a 45-yard throw-in,
one that could have easily
matched an John Elway pass,
to give Ryerson an easy shot
and UNLVa 1-0 lead.

I warned our guys about
that play," Lodge said. "They
do it every time but I guess it is
done with such perfection
that it is hard to stop."
After the UNLV's quick
score, Stanford looked dis
heartened.
"We played two or three
times below our potential,"
Burkhardt said. "We were
just trying to stay in the game
and didn't attack as much as
they did."
Because Stanford started
out behind, it was on defense
most of the first half. UNLV
would have broken the game
open had it not been for a
couple of well-positioned
Stanford defenders. Tom
Rafalovich made a sliding
block of a rocket of a shot by
Ryerson to save one such
goal-
In the second half, Stanford
became more aggressive and
got more shots on goal in the
first 15 minutes than they had
the entire first half. On a cor
ner kick, Angel Vasquez ham

mered a shot into the corner
only to be deflected by
UNLV's diving goalie. Jorge
Titinger also got a couple of
breakaways but the defenders
swarmed on the ball and he
was unable to get a clear shot.
"We were able to get to the
ball a lot quicker because we
were able to stay fresh
longer," said UNLV fullback
Rob Moreland. "I think it's be
cuase our subs (substitutes)
are better than theirs."
UNLV was quicker on the
ball except at the beginning of
the second half probably due
to a let-down after the goals
were scored. " I know we're
better than that," Lodge said.
"We had an attitude of not
wanting to win today. We
didn't pressure the ball."
Stanford matched UNLV's
play with all their starters in
the game. But when Vasquez
hurt his ankle, the Cardinal
lacked scoring punch and
consequently played a more
defensive game.
