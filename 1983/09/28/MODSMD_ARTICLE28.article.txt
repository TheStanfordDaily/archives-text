### BETH KLEID 
Senior field fun ke\ player Patsy
Huntington is bai k. \ttei almost a sear
of recuperation period from a knee
injur\, former L 1 v lunior National
leam member and Mi-American player
Huntington is reads to race down the
field again.
Huntington tripped and fell during a
match against Holland while she was
plaving on the lunior National Team in
Colorado Springs the summer after
her sophomore year.
Huntington remembers the day of
her injurs as one of the worst in her
lite. "On top of it all we lost the game
we were playing against Holland." she
said.
The road to recovery has not been
an easy one tor Huntington. "At first I
thought that I would never be able to
plav again, she said. "I thought to
myself How will I run around and play
such a strenuous game as field hockey
when I could not even walk without a
limp?' It got vers depressing."
Huntington has plased field hockey
since the seventh grade, and this made
it even more difficult to sit out for for
the entire season last year. "It's one
thing not to be able to play because
someone is better than you," said
Huntington, "but it is so frustrating
not to be physically able to play."

But now Huntington is getting bai k
into top shape. She does not set base a
full range of motion in her knee, but
doctors say it will increase over time.
"When I hurt my knee it was during a
period that I was playing my best
hockey ever, and I am slowly getting
back to that level. I am really enthusi
astic about returning to field hoc ke\."
The field hockey tea m h e r e
welcomes her return. "Palsy is some
one you have to contend with no mat
ter where she is one the field, said
killefer. Killefer was also a Stanford
Ail-American in field hockey and suf
fered an injury similar to Huntington's
knee problem.
Huntington is recognized as one of
the strongest forwards in collegiate
field hockey, and having her back on
the team generates a feeling of op
timism for the coming season among
team members.
But Huntington said she does not
feel unreasonable pressure to per
form. "People will not be expecting me
to be the player I used to be because
of my injury," she said.
The senior hails from Philadelphia, a
field hockey mecca, where she played
for Cermantown Academy. Hunting
ton began her field hockey career in
middle school, where every girl was
required to play the sport. Once she

caught tin' field hockey bug there was
niÂ» slopping her.
Huntington exudes enthusiasm tor
her sport, the team here and its coat h.
"Field hot key is a tun sport Inn ause
it is a difficult one In field hoc ke\ you
are constantly moving - there are two
uninterrupted 35 minute halves. You
have to run in an awkward position
and when someone makes a good pla\
it may not look difficult - hut it is."
Nevertheless, Huntington ex
pressed the hope that more people
will come out to watch tield hotkev
this year.She said that the sport reallx
is beginning to catch on in the West.
She has high hopes tor this season.
"We have a good team this year.
There is a lot ot team spirit, and every
one is very supportive of each other.
Huntington said that her goal tor the
team is to gain entrance to the NCAA
tournament in November.
As lor her own future, Huntington
may continue with field hotkey by
playing on the National team, but it
depends on how things work out with
her knee.
Huntington's knee injury caused
her to view field hotkey differently.
"The injury was like a slap in the fat e,
and now I appreciate the sport much
more."
