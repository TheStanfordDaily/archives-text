# Local Aussies applaud America's Cup victory

### MARK ZEIGLER 
Native Australians in the Stanford communi
ty were generally excited that the America's
Cup finally went down under Monday, ending
the United States' 132-year hold on yachting's
most prestigous title.
"We're not yachting fans, but we're thrilled
that they (Australia) won/' said loan Angus,
wife of graduate student Max Angus. "Wo flew
an Australian flag on our back patio and
popped open a bottle of champagne."
Australia 11, who earned the right to chal
lenge for the Cup in August, rebounded from a
3-1 defecit by taking three straight rates from
American defender liberty in the best-of
seven series held on Rhode Island Sound in
Newport, Rl. Australia's .successful challenge
marked the end of the longest winning streak
in international sports history.
In the seventh and deciding race, Australia II
skipper John Bertrand steered his 12-meter
boat past Dennis Conner's Liberty with |ust six
miles to go on the 24.3 mile course. Australia II
held on to win by 41 seconds or about tour
boat lengths.
Asked to describe the reaction back in
Australia, visiting Business School professor
Philip Brown replied, "They're overjoyed. I
happen to come from Perth (Australia ll's
home port). I can just imagine that everything
is bubbling there. It (winning the Cup) is quite
an accomplishment."
Brown pointed out that since most of the
major cities are on the coast, yachting is much
more popular in Australia than in America.
"Among the yachting circles, I think they're
celebrating by eating and drinking," Angus
said. "But amongst the general population, the

celebration would be happy conversation.
"It (winning the Cup) is a matter of national
pride," she added.
Director of Sailing Joseph Petrucci, an Amer
ican, is just as pleased Australia II defeated
Liberty us are the Australian students and fac
ulty at Stanford.
"I am thrilled with the fact that Australia has
won," he said. "The value to international
yacht rating of Australia winning far exceeds
the value of America's 132-year domination of
the Cup."
As a token of his admiration, Petrucci sent a
formal letter of congratulation to the
Australian syndicate on behalf of the Stanford
Sailing Program.
Petrucci explained that the winning nation
has the option of hosting the next challenge on
its home water. The next Cup races—scheduled
for 1987 in Perth, Austialia — a West Coast
based boat is chosen to challenge Australia and
is successful, the ensuing Cup could take place
on West Coast waters and maybe even on San
Francisco Bay. For example, if a boat from San
Francisco's St. Francis Yacht Club could travel
to Perth in 1987, win the Cup back for America
and then host the next Cup races in the early
1990'5.
"It could be ihe St. Francis Yacht Club, the
Newport Yacht Club or the Wakegan Yacht
Club in Illinois,' Petrucci said. "The possibili
ties are endless."
Petrucci is a firm believer that the radical
keel design Australia II used to produce a
faster boat will not be to its advantage when
Australia makes its first Cup defense.
"In the case of this America's Cup, though,
the Australians had the fastest boat," he said.
