# Stanford West faces uncertain future
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
Because of the cost of stipulations
placed on the Stanford West project
by Palo Alto, the University has
called for "fresh discussions" with
the city on the proposed housing
development.
These new talks, which were sug
gested in a letter from William
Massy, vice-president for business
and finance, to Palo Alto Mayor
Betsy Bechtel, will not begin until
Stanford has completed an informal
internal review of its plans for the
project and the prospects for its
completion.
University officials would not give
an estimated date for when this
review might be completed and
when the talks might begin.
The current controversy began
when the Palo Alto City Council cer
tified the Environmental Impact
Report on the project at its )uly 7
meeting. At that time the council
added several conditions to its ap
proval of the report. These in
cluded:
. creation of a 150-foot buffer on

the southeast side of Willow Road;
• prohibition of automobile access
from Pasteur Road to San Fran
cisquito Creek to the southeast side
of Willow Road;
• restrictions on the use of land
bounded by Pasteur Road, Campus
Drive, the golf course and Willow
Road to academic or support
services only; and
• establishment of a playing field
on the site of the project.
The first three stipulations apply
to land within Santa Clara County,
while the last applies to Palo Alto
land.
In his letter to Bechtel, dated
Sept. 1, Massy told the mayor that
"we have regretfully concluded that
Stanford West cannot proceed un
der the conditions that have been
proposed."
These conditions included the
four above, the Palo Alto require
ment that 15 percent of the pro
posed 1100 Stanford West units be
financed at below market rates,
road improvements requested by
the city, and rental ot the Mayfield

School site to the Palo Alto Housing
Authority for $100,000.
Although Massy called for new
talks on all of these proposals, the
three latter stipulations had been
agreed to by both the city and the
University. The University has
asked for renegotiation on these
three conditions because it esti
mated that they would cost between
$12 and $15 million.


William Massy
Bruce Freeland, Palo Alto's chief
planning official, said that the 150-
toot setback and the land use re
strictions on county, not city, land
were only asking the University "to
make a commitment to its own land
use plan."
The restrictions on Willow Road
were imposed, Freeland said be
cause the Environmental Impact
Report mentioned that traffic con
gestion would result on the street if
the project were completed. He
said the stipulation was "a very

reasonable request to make since it
(traffic) can be routed in a different
direction."
In addition, Freeland said that
such a condition was within Palo
Alto's rights because Willow Road is
designated as a city road, and thus
Palo Alto can control access to it.
According to Andrew Doty, Uni
versity director of community rela
tions, Stanford finds these
conditions unacceptable because it
is inappropriate to exchange con
cessions on Palo Alto land in ex
change for concessions on county
land.
Doty disagreed with Freeland on
the findings of the Environmental

Impact Report, saying that "nothing
in the EIR on Stanford West says that
these conditions suggested by the
City Council are necessary to
mitigate the impact of Stanford
West." Freeland had said that the
report indicated that such restric
tions on Willow Road were neces
sary.
Palo Alto has a housing shortage,
and the infusion of 1100 units of
housing, 15 percent of which would
be at below market rates and 30 per
cent of which (according to current
estimates) would be for people not
affiliated with Stanford, would help
alleviate this problem.
But the University remains

adamant on its refusal to comply
with the conditions. Doty warned:
"If those conditions are not
eliminated, then Stanford West will
not proceed."
