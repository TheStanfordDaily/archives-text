# Sports facilities on the Farm
## 
### 
Though the Universit) is not
nationally known as a sports
power in many sports, it is a
haven tor the recreational ath
lete. Good weather, space and
a variet) of facilities all make
the campus a great place to
work out. Whether its running
the Perrier par course, shoot
ing bask ets in Map les ,
we'ghtlifting in Enema, or
swimming in DeGuerre,
recreational athletes from the
Stanford community can find a
place to play their game, swim
their laps or lift their weights.
Maples Pavilion is the
campus multipurpose
facility. The pavilion was built
in 7969 and the floor of the
gym is recognized as one of
the best basketball surfaces in
the world.
DeGuerre Pool Plaza houses
three pools. Eight indoor
squash, handball and racquet
ball courts are also part of the
DeGuerre complex.
But these and other facilities
are often closed to the public
to allow practice time for the
varsity teams. A schedule of
times when the facilities are
open to the public follows.
