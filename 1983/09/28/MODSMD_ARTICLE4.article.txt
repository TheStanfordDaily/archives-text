Reagtin supports IMF funding
Washington — President Reagan yesterday bluntly
warned conservative Republicans who threaten to
block an $8.4 billion authorization bill tor the Inter
national Monetary Fund that, if they succeed, the
consequences could be an "economic nightmare
that could plague generations to come.
In an address to the opening session here of the
IMF and World Bank, Reagan pushed hard tor pas
sage of the legislation that he described as the
linchpin" of the entire international finance system.
"Let me make something very plain, Reagan told
an audience composed of the world's top bankers
and financial officials at the Sheraton-Washington
Hotel. "I have an unbreakable commitment to in-

Frtim Ihe wires ol the \ssoi uted Press and the I os Angeles limes Washington Post News Service

creased funding for the IMF."
American failure to participate in a proposed 48
percent expansion of the IMF's capital would result
in a withdrawal by other major nations, and the
resultant "nightmare" would disrupt the world's
trade and tinanical systems, he said.
Reagan called on Democrats and Republicans
alike to lay aside their differences, and to get on
with the task in a spirit of true bipartisanship." But
his plea did not go down well with Democrats on
Capitol Hill,
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass)
said Reagan's speech would not satisfy Democrats
who have "saved his bill" and then were subjected
to " the most vicious political letter I have ever
seen" from the Republican party. He was referring
to charges by Rep. Phil Cramm (R-Tx) that sup
porters of the bill are helping communist countries.

Congress will have input in Lebanon
Washington — President Reagan, seeking to
preserve a shaky war-powers agreement struck
with congressional leaders, vowed yesterday to give
Congress a sav in any "substantial expansion in the
number or role ot U.S. armed torces in Lebanon."
Moreover, Reagan said in a letter requested by
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn), if
the American torces were needed beyond the
agreed upon 18 months, "It would be my intention
to work together with the Congress with a view
toward taking action on mutually acceptable terms.
Reagan wrote the letter to shore up wavering
support tor the war-powers agreement on the even
of showdown votes in the Senate and the House.
Republican leaders were cautiously optimistic that
they could hold the agreement intact in the
Republican-run Senate. But in the Democratic
controlled House, Rules Committee Chairman
Claude Pepper (D-Fla) suggested that Democratic
leaders might offer an amendment Wednesday that
would sharply trim the 18-month deployment period
in the compromise agreement reached with the
Reagan administration officials.
That disclosure came as momentum built in the
House for an alternative plan pushed by a wide
range of mutinous Democrats. It would cut off funds
for the Lebanon operation at the end of November
unless Reagan either certified that there was a
cease-fire or invoked the 1973 War-Powers Act,
giving Congress a role in deciding further deploy
ment.

Baker solicited the letter from Reagan after he
and House Speaker Tip O'Neill (D-Mass) had
protested that Secretary of State George Shultz
seemed to be reneging on the war-powers agree
ment negotiated principalis b\ Baker, O'Neill and
administration officials.
Budget office pressured EPA
Washington—l he Environmental Protection Agency
has faced "immense pressure" to fit its regulations to
the Reagan administration's philosophical bent—and
has received "veiled threats" when it did not, an ex-aide
to former EPA administrator Anne Burtord told a con
gressional subcommittee yesterday.
Furthermore, industries affected b\ EPA regula
tions repeatedK used the Office of Management
and Budget to influence EP-X policies, )ohn Daniel
the agency s former chief of staff, told the House En
ergy Committee's Oversight and Investigations Sub
committee.
Daniel cited instances in which corporations
atfected by EPA proposals knew of the proposed
rules t>etore they were published—knowledge that he.
said apparently came, in violation of the law, from
the budget office, an arm of the White House. In an
other case, he said EPA received guidelines from the
budget office that were "so technical they would
have had to come from someone other than OMB it
self," presumablv from the regulated companies.
When the agency acted against the will of the
White House, lie said, it faced "veiled threats of
what would happen next." In one such instance, he
said, he received a late-night call from an OMB offi
cial who warned "there was a price to pay tor doing
what we had done, and he hadn't begun to pay.
"So the inescapable conclusion is that (OMB), just

sat over there and ac ted as ,1 back door c hannel lor
letting corporations affected (by EPA polities) hot
wire the regulatory process and get the results the\
wanted. Isn't that essentially' what the\ were doing,
Rep. Albert Core (D-Tenn) asked Daniel.
I think you correctly characterized it replied
the former chief of statt, who until his resignation
last spring had been the only Democ rat among the
EPA's top-level political appointees.
However, when OMR spokesman Edwin Dale was
asked in an interview to comment on Daniel's allega
tions, he insisted, "our judgment is completely inde
pendent....! would certainly deny completely that
we were some kind of conduit tor industry views.
Watt may have weathered storm
Washington—President Reagan said it is up to Sec
retary oi the Interior lames Watt to decide for him
self whether he has permanently damaged his
eftectiveness and should step down from his job be
cause of his remark about "a black, a woman, two
lews and a c ripple."
And, with congressional Republican divided and
Democrats pulling some of their punches, some De
partment of the Interior officials said yesterday they
believed that their chief might have "weathered the
storm."
Said one Interior official late yesterday, "We're
not out of the woods, but things are looking up
around here."
In an interview with the New York Post, the tran
script of which was released by the White House
yesterday, Reagan said that Watt's comments about
members of a federal advisory panel on coal leasing
were improper but not bitter or bigoted.
"If I thought he was bigoted or prejudiced, he
wouldn't be a part of administration," Reagan said.

It was an attempt at lightness that, as we all have to
admit, toll very flat."
Asked whether he planned to tire Watt, Reagan
said, I think that is a decision that he, himself,
would have to make, whether he feels that he has
made it questionable as to whether he can be effec
tive or not."
While some Democratic officials were trying to
walk a narrow line between criticizing Watt as the\
normally would do and becoming so strident that
htey lose a usetul political target by forcing the
President to oust him. As one House Democrat aide
said, some Democrats believe that "it we raised a big
stink, he'd be gone—and we don't want to lose this
guv."
That spirit, House Speaker Thomas "Tip O Neill
(D-Mass) said yesterday, this town needs a |oke
and he's (Watt) the biggest joke we've had in
years."

Capitol Hill,
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass)
said Reagan's speech would not satisfy Democrats
who have "saved his bill" and then were subjected
to " the most vicious political letter I have ever
seen" from the Republican party. He was referring
to charges by Rep. Phil Cramm (R-Tx) that sup
porters of the bill are helping communist countries.

Congress will have input in Lebanon
Washington — President Reagan, seeking to
preserve a shaky war-powers agreement struck
with congressional leaders, vowed yesterday to give
Congress a sav in any "substantial expansion in the
number or role ot U.S. armed torces in Lebanon."
Moreover, Reagan said in a letter requested by
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn), if
the American torces were needed beyond the
agreed upon 18 months, "It would be my intention
to work together with the Congress with a view
toward taking action on mutually acceptable terms.
Reagan wrote the letter to shore up wavering
support tor the war-powers agreement on the even
of showdown votes in the Senate and the House.
Republican leaders were cautiously optimistic that
they could hold the agreement intact in the
Republican-run Senate. But in the Democratic
controlled House, Rules Committee Chairman
Claude Pepper (D-Fla) suggested that Democratic
leaders might offer an amendment Wednesday that
would sharply trim the 18-month deployment period
in the compromise agreement reached with the
Reagan administration officials.
That disclosure came as momentum built in the
House for an alternative plan pushed by a wide
range of mutinous Democrats. It would cut off funds
for the Lebanon operation at the end of November
unless Reagan either certified that there was a
cease-fire or invoked the 1973 War-Powers Act,
giving Congress a role in deciding further deploy
ment.

Baker solicited the letter from Reagan after he
and House Speaker Tip O'Neill (D-Mass) had
protested that Secretary of State George Shultz
seemed to be reneging on the war-powers agree
ment negotiated principalis b\ Baker, O'Neill and
administration officials.
Budget office pressured EPA
Washington—l he Environmental Protection Agency
has faced "immense pressure" to fit its regulations to
the Reagan administration's philosophical bent—and
has received "veiled threats" when it did not, an ex-aide
to former EPA administrator Anne Burtord told a con
gressional subcommittee yesterday.
Furthermore, industries affected b\ EPA regula
tions repeatedK used the Office of Management
and Budget to influence EP-X policies, )ohn Daniel
the agency s former chief of staff, told the House En
ergy Committee's Oversight and Investigations Sub
committee.
Daniel cited instances in which corporations
atfected by EPA proposals knew of the proposed
rules t>etore they were published—knowledge that he.
said apparently came, in violation of the law, from
the budget office, an arm of the White House. In an
other case, he said EPA received guidelines from the
budget office that were "so technical they would
have had to come from someone other than OMB it
self," presumablv from the regulated companies.
When the agency acted against the will of the
White House, lie said, it faced "veiled threats of
what would happen next." In one such instance, he
said, he received a late-night call from an OMB offi
cial who warned "there was a price to pay tor doing
what we had done, and he hadn't begun to pay.
"So the inescapable conclusion is that (OMB), just

sat over there and ac ted as ,1 back door c hannel lor
letting corporations affected (by EPA polities) hot
wire the regulatory process and get the results the\
wanted. Isn't that essentially' what the\ were doing,
Rep. Albert Core (D-Tenn) asked Daniel.
I think you correctly characterized it replied
the former chief of statt, who until his resignation
last spring had been the only Democ rat among the
EPA's top-level political appointees.
However, when OMR spokesman Edwin Dale was
asked in an interview to comment on Daniel's allega
tions, he insisted, "our judgment is completely inde
pendent....! would certainly deny completely that
we were some kind of conduit tor industry views.
Watt may have weathered storm
Washington—President Reagan said it is up to Sec
retary oi the Interior lames Watt to decide for him
self whether he has permanently damaged his
eftectiveness and should step down from his job be
cause of his remark about "a black, a woman, two
lews and a c ripple."
And, with congressional Republican divided and
Democrats pulling some of their punches, some De
partment of the Interior officials said yesterday they
believed that their chief might have "weathered the
storm."
Said one Interior official late yesterday, "We're
not out of the woods, but things are looking up
around here."
In an interview with the New York Post, the tran
script of which was released by the White House
yesterday, Reagan said that Watt's comments about
members of a federal advisory panel on coal leasing
were improper but not bitter or bigoted.
"If I thought he was bigoted or prejudiced, he
wouldn't be a part of administration," Reagan said.

It was an attempt at lightness that, as we all have to
admit, toll very flat."
Asked whether he planned to tire Watt, Reagan
said, I think that is a decision that he, himself,
would have to make, whether he feels that he has
made it questionable as to whether he can be effec
tive or not."
While some Democratic officials were trying to
walk a narrow line between criticizing Watt as the\
normally would do and becoming so strident that
htey lose a usetul political target by forcing the
President to oust him. As one House Democrat aide
said, some Democrats believe that "it we raised a big
stink, he'd be gone—and we don't want to lose this
guv."
That spirit, House Speaker Thomas "Tip O Neill
(D-Mass) said yesterday, this town needs a |oke
and he's (Watt) the biggest joke we've had in
years."

Reagtin supports IMF funding
Washington — President Reagan yesterday bluntly
warned conservative Republicans who threaten to
block an $8.4 billion authorization bill tor the Inter
national Monetary Fund that, if they succeed, the
consequences could be an "economic nightmare
that could plague generations to come.
In an address to the opening session here of the
IMF and World Bank, Reagan pushed hard tor pas
sage of the legislation that he described as the
linchpin" of the entire international finance system.
"Let me make something very plain, Reagan told
an audience composed of the world's top bankers
and financial officials at the Sheraton-Washington
Hotel. "I have an unbreakable commitment to in-

creased funding for the IMF."
American failure to participate in a proposed 48
percent expansion of the IMF's capital would result
in a withdrawal by other major nations, and the
resultant "nightmare" would disrupt the world's
trade and tinanical systems, he said.
Reagan called on Democrats and Republicans
alike to lay aside their differences, and to get on
with the task in a spirit of true bipartisanship." But
