Reagtin supports IMF funding
Washington â€” President Reagan yesterday bluntly
warned conservative Republicans who threaten to
block an $8.4 billion authorization bill tor the Inter
national Monetary Fund that, if they succeed, the
consequences could be an "economic nightmare
that could plague generations to come.
In an address to the opening session here of the
IMF and World Bank, Reagan pushed hard tor pas
sage of the legislation that he described as the
linchpin" of the entire international finance system.
"Let me make something very plain, Reagan told
an audience composed of the world's top bankers
and financial officials at the Sheraton-Washington
Hotel. "I have an unbreakable commitment to in-

creased funding for the IMF."
American failure to participate in a proposed 48
percent expansion of the IMF's capital would result
in a withdrawal by other major nations, and the
resultant "nightmare" would disrupt the world's
trade and tinanical systems, he said.
Reagan called on Democrats and Republicans
alike to lay aside their differences, and to get on
with the task in a spirit of true bipartisanship." But
his plea did not go down well with Democrats on
Capitol Hill,
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass)
said Reagan's speech would not satisfy Democrats
who have "saved his bill" and then were subjected
to " the most vicious political letter I have ever
seen" from the Republican party. He was referring
to charges by Rep. Phil Cramm (R-Tx) that sup
porters of the bill are helping communist countries.
