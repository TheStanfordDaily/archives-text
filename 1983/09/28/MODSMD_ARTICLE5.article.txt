# Project opponents see few concessions

Opponents of a controversial
plan at the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) saw
some small victories in yesterday's
announcement that the proposal
would be accepted.
Faculty and students who
opposed the plan, which would aid
research on nuclear weapons, said
they took solace in the fact that an
especially objectionable component
of an earlier proposal was not in
cluded in the plan approved yester
day.
But Ann O'Leary, a graduate
student in psychology, said she still
opposes the project because "the
military is still dictating what's hap
pening with the money."

Bienenstock approved a revised
version of the proposal, which is
sponsored by the Lawrence
Livermore, Sandia and Los Alamos
National Laboratories and the Uni
versity of California.
The new plan stipulates that
calibration of detectors used in nu
clear weapons testing will take place
at Lawrence Livermore, not SSRL.
Opponents of the research said
they had assumed from the wording
of the original proposal that the

calibration would take place at Stan
ford.
The project will cost $6.4 million,
of which $5.4 million will be
financed by the Department of tn
ergy's Office of Military Applica
tions and $1 million will be funded
by U.C.
Bienenstock said a "very, very
small" amount of the research
would aid nuclear weapons re
search. He said that because of the
nature of the research, it would be
impossible to predict how much it
would benefit nuclear weapons de
velopment.
O'Leary, who is a member of the
campus chapter of the Democratic
Socialists of America (DSA), said the
fact that the calibration would not
oA "is a small victory
But there's still a larger problem:
What goes on at SSRL is being
dictated by the military.''
Ross Boylan, also a member of
DSA, said the group would meet this
week to decide what actions to take
in the wake of the approval of the
project. He said the group plans to
protest a speech that University
President Donald Kennedy will give
on campus Oct. 7 to the Physicians
for Social Responsibility.
Kennedy declined to interfere
with Bienenstock's decision on the
project.
Boylan also said he opposed the
project because many workers at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter feel the project compromises
their freedom because they never

agreed to be involved in nuclear
weapons research when they came
toSLAC.
Mary lames, an engineering
physicist at SLAC, said there was a
"tacit" agreement when she began
working at the center that she
would not take part in nuclear
weapons research.
Roger Miller, a researcher at
SLAC, called the decision a "limited
victory,'' but said he was
"concerned'' about the fact that the
weapons laboratories and U.C.
would control two-thirds of the
beam-line time, while SSRL re
searchers would control only one
third.
