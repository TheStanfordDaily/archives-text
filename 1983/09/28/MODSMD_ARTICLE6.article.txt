# ASSU meeting focuses on cable TV

### TROY EID 
A cable television system will
potentially link "every single room"
in the University within two years,
according to James McCrath,
graduate ASSU senator.
McGrath and other ASSU officials
discussed the possibility of a
campus-wide cable television ser
vice, as well as the initiation of a
weekly ASSU newsletter, at this
year's opening ASSU senate
meeting, held last night at the Busi
ness School.
Efforts to introduce unrestricted
cable on campus have been blocked
in certain administrative quarters,
McGrath said.
He added that some University of
ficials fear that full commercial ser
vice could interfere with the studies
of undergraduates.
A decision on the scope and
limitations of cable television here
"will be made sometime this quar
ter," McCrath said. He urged un
dergraduates to "voice their
opinion as to what kind of a cable
system they would like." McGrath
noted that a campus cable link-up
would provide a wide range of edu
cational services to students and
faculty, including commercial and
inter-University programming.
"Such a cable hook-up," McCrath
added, "probably would be in
stalled no sooner than the end of
this year and no later than the end
of the following year."
Other senate discussion focused
on the introduction of a one-page
weekly ASSU newsletter, which will
distributed to students next Wed
nesday and will appear every Mon
day thereafter.
The newsletter's mission "is to
keep people aware of what's hap
pening in ASSU," according to
Mark Sobel, undergraduate
senator in charge of the project.
Sobel's announcement of the
newsletter spawned a raucous 30-
minute debate, during which
senators struggled to name the new
publication.
After a series of votes on titles
ranging from "Government Sian

dais," "ASSU Already Know,"and
"ASSU Like It,"the senate finally
agreed to dub the paper "ASSU
News."
Further deliberation centered
around broad objectives outlined
by the ASSU Steering Committee for
this year's senate. Senator Roland
Van Caalen attempted to strike a
clause in the Steering Committee
resolution that instructs the senate
to serve the interests of the student
body "outside the University."

"We are not being elected to rep
resent students" in politics otf
campus," Van Gaalen contended.
"We do not want to be a Russian
Communist party."
Van Gaalen's motion was defeated
after Sobel and others "questioned
its value," prompting another
debate and a vote to "postpone in
definitely" resolutions concerned
with the "outside the University"
clause.
