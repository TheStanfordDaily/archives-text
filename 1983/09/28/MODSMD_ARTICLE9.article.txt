# Stanford's first track stars trained at the Old Red Barn. A landmark too precious to lose.

### 
The famous Red Barn (not to be
confused with the "other" Stanford Barn
at the Shopping Center) is older than
the University. It was where Leland
Stanford raised and trained the prize
trotting horses that won 19 world
records, and surely would have won
more had it not been for Senator
Stanford's death. It was. in its time,
the world's leading research and breed
ing center for trotters.
Today, this last major structure of the
Stanford Farm is falling apart. Its
foundations are rickety, its walls sagging.

roof leaking, interior suffering from
decay. IT DESERVES A NEW LEASE
ON LIFE!
