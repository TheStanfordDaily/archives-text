## Students shower accolades on new housing 
### PAM CLOYD Staff writer 
To the residents of Sterling
Quad, Stanford's latest venture
in high-class housing, living in
relative luxury provides more
than just a pretty room.
The lounges are decorated in
smoky neutrals, with framed art
prints, fireplaces and handmade
leather couches. The
kitchenettes are equipped with
microwave ovens and each floor
has a comfortable study lounge
and a room for typing or music
practice. There's even an inter
com system in each house.
"You have to look past the
building, though," said Jan Nash,
resident assistant at Potter
House. "If people weren't in
volved, this place could go belly
up. It's the people. Everyone's so
enthusiastic."
Several residents agreed that


NO FREE LUNCH: Many Sterling Quad diners like the new system which provides refunds for students
who eat less, but some wish the savings could be greater than the $50 rebate now allowed. Food Service
administrators say the experimental meal plan should cut waste and costs.
the comfortable surroundings
have improved their daily lives.
"It's amazing how it changes
your perspective," said Cathy
Bledsoe, a junior living in Potter
House. "I was assigned to the
trailers last year, and the girl I
drew with was put into U|ama.<. I
petitioned and was assigned to
Stern, which was a little better,
but it was difficult to move into
the dorm late.
"After last year I felt that I
could adjust to any roommate,
any situation, which gives you a
certain freedom. But not liking
your house makes you feel bad
about yourself. Here, you share
the enthusiasm. It's funny Even
though you don't have anything
to do with it, you have a certain
pride. In the trailer or Stern I

didn't fix up my room; it was kind
of grubby But here I'm excited
to lix it up and proud to have
people come over," she said.
There have been some prob
lems. The telephone company
has been working all week to
correct a mix-up that left many
students with their neighbors'
phone numbers, according to
Michael Tchao, a junior living in
Potter. "I didn't have any prob
lem until the other day. Then all
of a sudden the guy upstairs had
my number," he said.
Tchao and a friend, So n j a
Stumme, were busy yesterday
picking up pieces of foam stuffing
they had spilled on the floor
while making a pillow. "They
won't lend out the vacuum be
cause they haven't decided on
the procedure yet," he ex
plained.
Some students have been dis
appointed with the residence's
new pay-as-you-go eating plan,

since the most one can save p< r
quarter is $50. "I th'nk its k•' (,»t
a ripoff in that respect " said
sophomore Leslie kilby I u<<
derstand tha' they're work ng
within a new budget, but I think
we should be able to < redit
more."
kilby said she liked the new,
setup, though "The food s
healthy—not all tried and sick Von
couldn't ask tor better. Ihe
dining hall is like a hotel restau
rant, and the kitchen worke>s
are very considerate.''
Will the new dorms romf! : ne
with the suites and the indepen
dent houses to form a new s<u ial
hotspot on campus? It's hard to
say, but the residents agree that
the enthusiasm is running high.
"The group that lives here is
really noisy, and it seems like
we'll get things together,' sai<|
Carlos Re/a, a sophomore living
in Schiff House. "It teels like i?
will pick up."
