## Profiting from their mistakes 
### TROY EID 
The Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB) may, as some
critics charge, be making lots of mistakes
these days.
The Big Came debacle and the more
recent band-related incident at last Satur
day's San Jose State football game— during
which the LSJUMB inadvertantly contrib
uted to a penalty against the Stanford
squad— have aroused animosity from some
corners of campus, sympathy from others.
But while campus opinions on the Band
may differ, perhaps one consensus can be
reached: the LSJUMB is being recognized
in a big way, both here and abroad, and the
Band is probably enjoying more attention
now than at any other time in its history.
Band Manager Gary Robinson claims that
the I SJUMB is "the most popular university
band in the world," and while some Stan
fordites might debate over the meaning of
this "popularity," to Band members it
means albums, road trips and commercial
endorscment offers.

It's a strange turn of events. Everybody hated the Band after its
Big Game foibles last year. But now the madcap marchers are
more popular than ever.

Chrysler Connection
A recent roadtrip to the Midwest is a
good example of the Band's growing
popularity.
The LSJUMB bussed itself out to Chicago
this summer, and the Chrysler Corporation
put them up for the night.
"It was an incredible time," said band
member Jamie Smeltz, in reference to the
the Chrysler fete. "We stayed in the
Chicago Inn, and Chrysler paid for it all.
"They had all this great food and an open
bar," Smeltz continued. "All we had to do
was film an endorsement for some new car
Chrysler came out with."
Assistant Band Manager Ben Langlotz
elaborated on the terms of the endorse-

ment, noting that Chrysler may use film
footage of the Band in a television commer
cial for a new car. He stressed that the
LSJUMB "didn't sign a release" to allow the
big-three automaker to name Stanford in
the commercial. "Only Stanford people
would recognize that it's our band," he
said.
Langlotz added that some individual band
members, however, signed releases to be
paid for their parts in the filming. "The
whole band wasn't paid . . .because we
don't endorse anyone," he said.
"I think Chrysler chose us because we
enjoy such wide national recognition,"
Robinson said. Langlotz agreed, adding
that "our reputation extends beyond the
Bay Area."

dorsement agreement "in hopes ol
promoting their beer," hu! he; pointed out
that he and others resisted the plan.
"When they wanted us to play our theme
song for their ads, we immediately refused,
because we don't want commercialism to
interfere with our activities," Langlotz said.
He noted another brewing company r< -
lationship, this time between the LS|UMB
and Budweiser. "Not long ago we played at
a posh San Francisco hotel for several
thousand Budweiser area managers," h»
explained. "In return, they provided beer
and dinner."
Robinson claims that I S|l JMB "is the most
popular university marching hand in the
world." And while Robinson's authority to
make such a statement might be question
able, there's no arguing that the Incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band is the one of the most fa
mous—er, possibly infamous hands mi the
land.

Beer and the Band
"I can't stereotype the Band, but one
reason we're together is so we can be
rowdy and raise hell, " said band member
Dave Oline. While other band members
might hesitate to agree — at least publicly —
beer does play an important role in
LSJUMB these days.
"Miller (Brewing Co.) has approached
us about doing endorsements," Robinson
said. "Coors is thinking about doing the
same."
Miller supplied beer for the Band at last
spring's Bay to Breakers road race in San
Francisco; in return, the LSJUMB provided
music for the event, l anglotz said that Mil
