## Viewpoint: Frederick Stark Don't work for the Fed 
### 
I have a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia Uni
versity and am retired after having worked tor many
years for the federal government's Social Se< urity Ad
ministration and Health Care Financing Administration.
I very strongly urge all college graduates not to work
for the United States government because:
• Wages and salaries for federal workers are 22 per
cent on the average (and in some cases as much as 50
percent) below the pay that workers in private en
terprise receive for essentially the same jobs. The most
pay that a federal employee can receive is $57,500 a
year, which is a trifle compared to the yearly salaries of
many private company executives which are in the
hundreds of thousands of dollars and which in some
cases exceed $1 million.
• Fpderal employees have to pay a high percentage of
the premiums for their health and life insurance,

Wages and salaries for federal work
ers are 22 percent below the pay that
workers in private enterprise receive
for essentially the same jobs.

whereas, many employers in private enterprise pay all
of such premiums for their employees.
• Federal employees have to pay into Medicare's
Hospital Trust Fund, and effective with |an. 1,1984 new
federal employees will also have to pay into Social Se
curity's other trust funds. This is in addition to paying
into the Civil Service Retirement System. It constitutes
just a sneakv way by which the Reagan administration
and the Congress have taken federal employees'
money to shore up Medicare and Social Security.
Federal employees have their own health insurance
and retirement svstems and cannot bear these addi
tional taxes.
• The Reagan administration has raised federal
employees' and retirees' health insurance premiums to
exorbitant levels and cut their health insurance
coverage drastically.
• According to the Congressional Budget Office,
federal employees receive less vacation and holiday
time than do many people in private enterprise. For ex
ample, for many years steel workers have been given
13-week vacations every five years (in addition to their
regular vacations during the intervening years) upon
attaining a certain seniority.
• The Congressional Budget Office also said that
federal employees receive less sick time than do many
private enterprise employees.
• Federal employees work a 40-hour week while
many private enterprise workers have work weeks of
less hours. For example, the electricians in New York
City obtained a 25-hour work week many years ago.
• For decades, federal employees have paid 7 percent
of their total pay into their retirement fund. They have
had to pay into their fund far more than people cov
ered by Social Security have been required to pay into
the Social Security trust funds. The vast majority of
private enterprise retirement plans are fully paid for
bv the emDlovers with no emolovee contributions re

quired, and private plans are protected by a federal
law, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Statute.
• 112 edera! employees do not receive Christmas or any
other bonuses, or have profit sharing plans, stock op
tion plans, etc.
• Federal employees are forbidden to engage in
politics. This is a complete violation of their Constitu
tional rights of free expression and association.
• Federal retirees who are under age 62 are only
going to receive about one-half of the cost of living in
creases that those 62 or older will receive. This con
stitutes blatant, outrageous age discrimination.
• Federal retirees formerly received 1 percent of
their pensions added to the pensions at the time of
retirement and two cost of living increases each year in
order to at least fractionally compensate them for the
low pay that they had been given while working. Now
they do not get the IXpercent1 X percent add-on, and they only
receive one cost of living increase per year.
• Federal retirees have to pay income tax on every
cent of their pensions once they get back what they
paid into their pension fund. The money that they paid
into the pension fund is not taxable, because taxes
were paid on it by the retiree when he or she was
working.
• In the past college graduates sought employment
with the federal government mainly because of job se
curity and retirement at a comparatively young age on
a good pension. Recent legislation has cut down
federal job security, job security has been increased in
the private sector by law and recent court decisions,
and many private company pension plans provide
benefits (including early retirement) that are equal to
or more generous than those that are given by the
Federal Civil Service Retirement System.
• Therefore, college graduates are much better off
working in private enterprise with the chance of be-

dents or a quarter-of-a-million-a-year vice president
than working in the civil service for cheapskate pay
and second rate fringe benefits.
If a college graduate cannot find a good job in
private enterprise upon graduation, he or she would
do far better to work in a menial job in private en
terprise until such time as he can obtain a position in
the private sector that is commensurate with his educa
tion than take a job with the United States government
while looking for a good occupation with a private
business. Otherwise, he may ruin his future by tainting
himself with federal employment, since it is looked
upon with such disdain by the business community and
the public in general. In fact, for a number of years
people have been thought of as having disgraced them
selves, if they have worked for the federal govern
ment.

I have a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia Uni
versity and am retired after having worked tor many
years for the federal government's Social Se< urity Ad
ministration and Health Care Financing Administration.
I very strongly urge all college graduates not to work
for the United States government because:
• Wages and salaries for federal workers are 22 per
cent on the average (and in some cases as much as 50
percent) below the pay that workers in private en
terprise receive for essentially the same jobs. The most
pay that a federal employee can receive is $57,500 a
year, which is a trifle compared to the yearly salaries of
many private company executives which are in the
hundreds of thousands of dollars and which in some
cases exceed $1 million.
• Fpderal employees have to pay a high percentage of
the premiums for their health and life insurance,

Wages and salaries for federal work
ers are 22 percent below the pay that
workers in private enterprise receive
for essentially the same jobs.

whereas, many employers in private enterprise pay all
of such premiums for their employees.
• Federal employees have to pay into Medicare's
Hospital Trust Fund, and effective with |an. 1,1984 new
federal employees will also have to pay into Social Se
curity's other trust funds. This is in addition to paying
into the Civil Service Retirement System. It constitutes
just a sneakv way by which the Reagan administration
and the Congress have taken federal employees'
money to shore up Medicare and Social Security.
Federal employees have their own health insurance
and retirement svstems and cannot bear these addi
tional taxes.
• The Reagan administration has raised federal
employees' and retirees' health insurance premiums to
exorbitant levels and cut their health insurance
coverage drastically.
• According to the Congressional Budget Office,
federal employees receive less vacation and holiday
time than do many people in private enterprise. For ex
ample, for many years steel workers have been given
13-week vacations every five years (in addition to their
regular vacations during the intervening years) upon
attaining a certain seniority.
• The Congressional Budget Office also said that
federal employees receive less sick time than do many
private enterprise employees.
• Federal employees work a 40-hour week while
many private enterprise workers have work weeks of
less hours. For example, the electricians in New York
City obtained a 25-hour work week many years ago.
• For decades, federal employees have paid 7 percent
of their total pay into their retirement fund. They have
had to pay into their fund far more than people cov
ered by Social Security have been required to pay into
the Social Security trust funds. The vast majority of
private enterprise retirement plans are fully paid for
bv the emDlovers with no emolovee contributions re

quired, and private plans are protected by a federal
law, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Statute.
• 112 edera! employees do not receive Christmas or any
other bonuses, or have profit sharing plans, stock op
tion plans, etc.
• Federal employees are forbidden to engage in
politics. This is a complete violation of their Constitu
tional rights of free expression and association.
• Federal retirees who are under age 62 are only
going to receive about one-half of the cost of living in
creases that those 62 or older will receive. This con
stitutes blatant, outrageous age discrimination.
• Federal retirees formerly received 1 percent of
their pensions added to the pensions at the time of
retirement and two cost of living increases each year in
order to at least fractionally compensate them for the
low pay that they had been given while working. Now
they do not get the IXpercent1 X percent add-on, and they only
receive one cost of living increase per year.
• Federal retirees have to pay income tax on every
cent of their pensions once they get back what they
paid into their pension fund. The money that they paid
into the pension fund is not taxable, because taxes
were paid on it by the retiree when he or she was
working.
• In the past college graduates sought employment
with the federal government mainly because of job se
curity and retirement at a comparatively young age on
a good pension. Recent legislation has cut down
federal job security, job security has been increased in
the private sector by law and recent court decisions,
and many private company pension plans provide
benefits (including early retirement) that are equal to
or more generous than those that are given by the
Federal Civil Service Retirement System.
• Therefore, college graduates are much better off
working in private enterprise with the chance of be-

coming one of the $1 million-a-year corporation presi
dents or a quarter-of-a-million-a-year vice president
than working in the civil service for cheapskate pay
and second rate fringe benefits.
If a college graduate cannot find a good job in
private enterprise upon graduation, he or she would
do far better to work in a menial job in private en
terprise until such time as he can obtain a position in
the private sector that is commensurate with his educa
tion than take a job with the United States government
while looking for a good occupation with a private
business. Otherwise, he may ruin his future by tainting
himself with federal employment, since it is looked
upon with such disdain by the business community and
the public in general. In fact, for a number of years
people have been thought of as having disgraced them
selves, if they have worked for the federal govern
ment.
