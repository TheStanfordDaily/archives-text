Yes, you can join the ranks of the famous and become a regular
newspaper columnist. Although we can't promise a personal secretary
and nationwide syndication, we do offer sharp pencils and your name
in print.
Just drop a sample column in the opinions box at The Daily office or
give it to Kevin or Bob. Columns should be three to four pages, typed
and double-spaced on a 57-character line. Also fill out an application
for a bi-weekly columnist position. Sample columns are due by
Monday.
Readers are also encouraged to submit letters to the editor. If you
have an opinion on or response to a campus or national issue, put your
thoughts in words and bring them to The Daily. All letters and columns
are subject to editing.
