## Soviet conduct guided by fear, not inherent evil 
### 
The West has witnessed, in recent
weeks, a deluge of journalistic efforts to
analyze the downing of Korean Airlines
flight 007 by the Soviet Union. We have
been confidently told that the tragedy un
derscores, among other things, the prox
imity of the two superpowers to the
cataclysmic events of 1914 and the re
emergence of the"the politics of fear. The
key to understanding this event, however
and the West's reaction to it, lies not in
post facto analysis but in a brief bv
Charles Krauthammer which appeareo in
Time over a week before the airline inci
dent.
Krauthammer begins:
Solipsism is the belief that the whole
world is me, and as Mathematician
Martin Gardner points out, its authen
tic version is not to he found outside
mental institutions. What is to he
found outside the asylum is its
philosophical cousin, the belief that
the whole world is like me. This
species of solipsism - plural solipsism,
if you like - is far more common he
cause it is far less lonely.
The 269 lives lost aboard KAL flight 007
have reawakened the West to the central
proposition that the leaders of the Soviet
Union are not like us. The stan
dards of conduct do not, however, spring
from some innate moral defect. They are
not the melodramatic "source of all evil'' in
the world.
The United States and the Soviet Union
emereed from World War II as ill-prepared

superpowers. Both lacked the long
•liplomatic tradition of Europe and both ex
hibited strong isolationist sentiment well
into the 20th century. Though intriguing,
this acknowledgement of historical
sirTTiarities does not take us far on the road
of understanding. The roots of the Korean
airline tragedy hark back to the fundamen
il enduring and decidedly unique histori
experience of Russia. Within the
fairytale-like security of the Stanford com
munity we have difficulty understanding
ii .Soviets' fear of invasion (confirmed by
Napoleon and Hitler but alien to America),
Iv-ii fear of being overcome by technology
a concern completely unfathomable to the
region of Silicon Valley), and, perhaps most
importantly, their pathological fear of
freedom.
It is indeed an irony of history that a
group of human beings who are themselves
nearly overcome with fear should use fear
as a central element of foreign policy. We
need look no further than the missile con
troversy in Western Europe to witness
Andropov's skillful manipulation of human
ftv.r. The tragedy of flight 007 is not the loss
<>: life. Indeed, the downing of the jet could
j'ave been accidental. The real tragedy
-Irikes us most profoundly when we realize
it it was assuredly not accidental. The
sv stematk lies on the part of Soviet officials
.■ rve only to confirm our darkest
suspicions. Regarding the newly installed
Soviet leader, we need look no further
than the realistic writings of John LeCarre
to understand the moral credo of the intel
ligence community as a whole and of the
KGB in particular.

Vet, the indictments of history do not
focus on the Soviet Union alone. Krautham
mer's words also provide a telling criticism
of the West:
. . . the mirror-image fantasy derives
above all from the coziness of middle
class life. The more settled and or
dered one's life - and in particular
one's communal life - the easier it
becomes for one's imagination to fail
. . . When the comfortable encounter
the unimaginable, the result is not
only emotional but cognitive rejec
tion.
In this century, the West has attained a
level of material comfort unprecedented in
history. The Stanford lifestyle, one of air
conditioning and fro-yo on demand, cer
tainly exemplifies this historical trend. In
our time, the Constitution's "pursuit of
happiness" has become the pursuit of
gratification in material, emotional and
sexual terms. By nature, it will remain a pur
suit not unlike that of the eternally restless
characters of Dante's Divine Comedy.
The West is not superior on the basis of
color television sets, its walkman stereos,
its mass media electoral process, or, tor
that matter, its Pershing missiles. It is su
perior for the simple reason that, for the
last 2000 years, it has acknowledged a stan
dard of morality above Machiavellian naked
force. It is surely not coincidental that the
persistent theme underlying a full three
academic quarters of Western Culture is
that of Christianity. Nietzsche's declaration
that God is dead, far from dispelling this

standard, revealed that "the still point of
the turning world," the central proposi
tion upon which Christianity rests, is based
on the uniquely human faculty of imagina
tion. The acceptance of the philosophical
religious concept of Cod itself rests on the
ability of the human being to conceive of an
entity so radically different from himself as
to be beyond the realm of scientific proof
and the scope of human senses.
The basis of conflict between the United
States and the Soviet Union is only inciden
tally manifested in military terms. The con
flict exists between two mutually exclusive
systems which propose to explain the basic
conditions of life on earth. That is, which
both attempt to find the meaning of human
suffering. Like Charles Ryder in Evelyn
Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, our genera
tion must come to realize that spiritual
beliefs are not archaic superstitutions and
that those who so much as refer to them
are not always ranting ideologues. Only
then can we turn the basis of conflict into
the source of peace.
The moral challenge of our time thus
becomes not one of self-admiration but
one immeasurably more difficult: to love
our neighbor as ourselves, but not be
cause he is like ourselves.
The political task complementary to the
moral one at hand is to sit across a negotiat
ing table in Geneva with mirror-images of
ourselves. We may appeal to the Soviets in
the same manner as we do each other,
keeping in mind that they are no less
human, but that they simply do not accept
the moral propositions which underlie
Western civilization as we know it. This

realization on our part makes this chal
lenge difficult. It also makes the task no less
urgent. Our capacity to do our duty as we
understand it must save both Western and
Soviet civilization from a far more
profound tragedy. As Krauthammer so
deftly reminds us, this task is the essence of
politics itself:
Ultimately to say that people all share
the same hopes and fears, are all born
and love and suffer and die alike, is to
say very little. For it is after com
monalities are accounted for that
politics becomes necessary. It is only
when values, ideologies, cultures and
interests clash that politics even
begins.
The legacy of Korean Airlines flight 007
rests with the politicians of the world: both
in the halls of the Kremlin, and in the Oval
Office of the White House, where our
President recalled the words of Abraham
Lincoln. It would indeed be a glorious turn
of history if the United States, so enamored
with its own image as to be called "The Cul
ture of Narcissism," could come to live,
without conquest or capitulation, with a
state which stands in vehement opposition
to the premises of Western civilization. We
must try. To do so would seem to defy all
that history so portentously places before
us, though perhaps that is the "daring" of
which Mr. Lincoln spoke.

group of human beings who are themselves
nearly overcome with fear should use fear
as a central element of foreign policy. We
need look no further than the missile con
troversy in Western Europe to witness
Andropov's skillful manipulation of human
ftv.r. The tragedy of flight 007 is not the loss
<>: life. Indeed, the downing of the jet could
j'ave been accidental. The real tragedy
-Irikes us most profoundly when we realize
it it was assuredly not accidental. The
sv stematk lies on the part of Soviet officials
.■ rve only to confirm our darkest
suspicions. Regarding the newly installed
Soviet leader, we need look no further
than the realistic writings of John LeCarre
to understand the moral credo of the intel
ligence community as a whole and of the
KGB in particular.

Vet, the indictments of history do not
focus on the Soviet Union alone. Krautham
mer's words also provide a telling criticism
of the West:
. . . the mirror-image fantasy derives
above all from the coziness of middle
class life. The more settled and or
dered one's life - and in particular
one's communal life - the easier it
becomes for one's imagination to fail
. . . When the comfortable encounter
the unimaginable, the result is not
only emotional but cognitive rejec
tion.
In this century, the West has attained a
level of material comfort unprecedented in
history. The Stanford lifestyle, one of air
conditioning and fro-yo on demand, cer
tainly exemplifies this historical trend. In
our time, the Constitution's "pursuit of
happiness" has become the pursuit of
gratification in material, emotional and
sexual terms. By nature, it will remain a pur
suit not unlike that of the eternally restless
characters of Dante's Divine Comedy.
The West is not superior on the basis of
color television sets, its walkman stereos,
its mass media electoral process, or, tor
that matter, its Pershing missiles. It is su
perior for the simple reason that, for the
last 2000 years, it has acknowledged a stan
dard of morality above Machiavellian naked
force. It is surely not coincidental that the
persistent theme underlying a full three
academic quarters of Western Culture is
that of Christianity. Nietzsche's declaration
that God is dead, far from dispelling this

standard, revealed that "the still point of
the turning world," the central proposi
tion upon which Christianity rests, is based
on the uniquely human faculty of imagina
tion. The acceptance of the philosophical
religious concept of Cod itself rests on the
ability of the human being to conceive of an
entity so radically different from himself as
to be beyond the realm of scientific proof
and the scope of human senses.
The basis of conflict between the United
States and the Soviet Union is only inciden
tally manifested in military terms. The con
flict exists between two mutually exclusive
systems which propose to explain the basic
conditions of life on earth. That is, which
both attempt to find the meaning of human
suffering. Like Charles Ryder in Evelyn
Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, our genera
tion must come to realize that spiritual
beliefs are not archaic superstitutions and
that those who so much as refer to them
are not always ranting ideologues. Only
then can we turn the basis of conflict into
the source of peace.
The moral challenge of our time thus
becomes not one of self-admiration but
one immeasurably more difficult: to love
our neighbor as ourselves, but not be
cause he is like ourselves.
The political task complementary to the
moral one at hand is to sit across a negotiat
ing table in Geneva with mirror-images of
ourselves. We may appeal to the Soviets in
the same manner as we do each other,
keeping in mind that they are no less
human, but that they simply do not accept
the moral propositions which underlie
Western civilization as we know it. This

realization on our part makes this chal
lenge difficult. It also makes the task no less
urgent. Our capacity to do our duty as we
understand it must save both Western and
Soviet civilization from a far more
profound tragedy. As Krauthammer so
deftly reminds us, this task is the essence of
politics itself:
Ultimately to say that people all share
the same hopes and fears, are all born
and love and suffer and die alike, is to
say very little. For it is after com
monalities are accounted for that
politics becomes necessary. It is only
when values, ideologies, cultures and
interests clash that politics even
begins.
The legacy of Korean Airlines flight 007
rests with the politicians of the world: both
in the halls of the Kremlin, and in the Oval
Office of the White House, where our
President recalled the words of Abraham
Lincoln. It would indeed be a glorious turn
of history if the United States, so enamored
with its own image as to be called "The Cul
ture of Narcissism," could come to live,
without conquest or capitulation, with a
state which stands in vehement opposition
to the premises of Western civilization. We
must try. To do so would seem to defy all
that history so portentously places before
us, though perhaps that is the "daring" of
which Mr. Lincoln spoke.

political science.)
The West has witnessed, in recent
weeks, a deluge of journalistic efforts to
analyze the downing of Korean Airlines
flight 007 by the Soviet Union. We have
been confidently told that the tragedy un
derscores, among other things, the prox
imity of the two superpowers to the
cataclysmic events of 1914 and the re
emergence of the"the politics of fear. The
key to understanding this event, however
and the West's reaction to it, lies not in
post facto analysis but in a brief bv
Charles Krauthammer which appeareo in
Time over a week before the airline inci
dent.
Krauthammer begins:
Solipsism is the belief that the whole
world is me, and as Mathematician
Martin Gardner points out, its authen
tic version is not to he found outside
mental institutions. What is to he
found outside the asylum is its
philosophical cousin, the belief that
the whole world is like me. This
species of solipsism - plural solipsism,
if you like - is far more common he
cause it is far less lonely.
The 269 lives lost aboard KAL flight 007
have reawakened the West to the central
proposition that the leaders of the Soviet
Union are not like us. The stan
dards of conduct do not, however, spring
from some innate moral defect. They are
not the melodramatic "source of all evil'' in
the world.
The United States and the Soviet Union
emereed from World War II as ill-prepared

superpowers. Both lacked the long
•liplomatic tradition of Europe and both ex
hibited strong isolationist sentiment well
into the 20th century. Though intriguing,
this acknowledgement of historical
sirTTiarities does not take us far on the road
of understanding. The roots of the Korean
airline tragedy hark back to the fundamen
il enduring and decidedly unique histori
experience of Russia. Within the
fairytale-like security of the Stanford com
munity we have difficulty understanding
ii .Soviets' fear of invasion (confirmed by
Napoleon and Hitler but alien to America),
Iv-ii fear of being overcome by technology
a concern completely unfathomable to the
region of Silicon Valley), and, perhaps most
importantly, their pathological fear of
freedom.
