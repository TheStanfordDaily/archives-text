Marshall's "anti-lsraelism" attacked

The commentaries of Rachelle
Marshall, the "expert" on Middle
Eastern affairs, appear regularly in
many local newpapers. After
reading several of her letters, one
discovers that they only purport to
educate or express opinion. The
true purpose is to provide a vehi
(le for Marshall's anti-Israel views,
most of which are vicious and
transmitted by innuendo.
A tvpical example appears in her
most r<>( eni contribution (Daily,
Sept .?(>). Ac cording to Marshall,
"Ist. S hacked Phalange militiamen
rampaged through refugee camps
in Beirut, ha( king and shooting
hundreds of defenseless people to
d ith." Vet even the most biased of
Marshall's sources have produced

no connection between the
Phalange terrorists and the Israelis.
Marshall /s far too skilled and expe
rienced as a rhetorician to be un
aware of the implications of her
remarks. Similar examples can be
found in many of her frequent
"analyses" of Middle Eastern
politics.
I ot ally, Marshall is perhaps the
most often printed source of vile
canards about Israel. It is regret
table that the apparent
"thoughtfulness" of her letters has
achieved the desired result: dis
semination of twisted, anti-Israel
propaganda.
