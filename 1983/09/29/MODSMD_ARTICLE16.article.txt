# Mexican professor criticizes El Salvador situation
## 
### 
Stanford student Brad Bar ham is
spending the year travelling through
Mexico and Central America, report
ing for The Daily on issues facing the
region. This is the first of those
reports.

Jose Armando Oliva, a
professor of electrical engi
neering and philosophy at the
Ibero-Arnerican University in
Mexico City, is an outspoken
opponent of human rights vio
lations in El Salvador.
The Daily interviewed him in
his Mexico City office.
DAILY: Armando, when and
why did you leave El Salvador?
OLIVA: I left at the end of
February in 1981 for two
reasons. First and most impor
tantly, my brother and sister
in-law disappeared on Feb. 3,
1981, after being taken away
by the Treasury Police. To this
date, we only know that they
are 'missing.' Second, I was a
member of an organization of
faculty members in San Sal

vador called the General Uni
versity Assembly. The military
had recently intervened and
banned further meetings,
and, as a result, they had my
name on their list.
As you can imagine, the dis
appearance of my brother and
his wife had a tremendous
emotional impact on my family
And, although no direct
threat was made against my
life, I left with my wife and
nine-month-old son and came
to Mexico City. It was here
that I began to work with
Socorro juidico (an indepen
dent human rights organiza
tion in El Salvador).
DAILY: Why was Socorro
luridico formed?
OLIVA: It was created in

1975 by some Salvadorans who
were affiliated with the
Archdiocese of San Salvador
in order to protest the legal
rights of workers and unions.
That was a time of growing
labor strife in San Salvador.
DAILY: How did Socorro
luridico then become a human
rights organization?
OLIVA: Briefly, the human
rights situation in El Salvador
deteriorated rapidly between
1975 and 1979 under the
regimes of Arturo Molina and
General Romero. Demands by
popular organizations were
answered by government
repression. Priests, students,
teachers, workers, peasants
and professionals began to
disappear. The church's in
volvement in efforts to defend
human rights grew accord
ingly.
Archbishop Oscar Romero
began to denounce publicly
the abuses of the military, and
he needed solid evidence for
his denunciations. Socorro
luridico thus gained the status
of the Legal Aid Office of the
Archbishop of San Salvador
and became an objective
source outside of the govern

ment for data gathering and
testimony about human rights
abuse. In other words, our
original purpose was trans
formed by the rise of govern
ment repression and the need
for documentation of human
rights abuses.
DAILY: In the U.S., Amnesty
International, Americas Watch
and other human rights organi
zations have often been at
tacked as "left leaning." Have
similar accusations been made
of Socorro luridico?
OLIVA: Of course. We have
been heavily criticized for
being partial. Yet, our answer
to that accusation is really
very basic. It is the poor, the
teachers, the students, the
workers who are demanding
human rights protection from
the repression of the military
and the government. It is
these groups who have asked
the church to denounce
human rights abuses, and they
have often risked their own
lives to help us document the
abuses. At the same time,
Socorro Juridico does not
argue that the guerrilla
groups, known to many Sal
vadorans as the popular army,

do not also violate human
rights. All one can say is that
they do so in much smaller
proportions and in a very dif
ferent manner.
DAILY: What's the differ
ence?
OLIVA: We identify two
types of violence, not to justify
the violence of the left, but to
identify its nature so that we
can understand it. The first
type is that of the government,
which is an institutionalization
of force, of repression, under
which violence is systematical
ly committed by the state with
impunity.
The second is violence as a
response to the tirst. As one
might imagine, those popular
organizations who also
opposed the government in a
more peaceful manner previ
ously have, for the most part,
chosen to defend themselves
against government repres
sions as a response to the
denial of their human, demo
cratic rights.
I repeat this is not a jus
tification for the violence of
the left but a facl of S a I -
vadoran history.
DAILY: President Reagan and
members of his administration
point to the decline in docu
mented deaths from human
rights abuses as evidence of an
improving situation. What is the
extent of the decline and what
does it mean?
OLIVA: Documented deaths

have indeed dropped from
12,000 in 1981 to about 6000 in
1982 and 1983. This fact re
quires a careful explanation,
however.
First, repression has
changed locations and charac
ter. It is now primarily in the
countryside and done on a
collective level rather than a
selective level. Both of these
characteristics make
documentation near
impossible. For 1982, for ex
ample, we have 6000 undocu
mented but reported deaths.
And, many massacres have
simply gone unreported to
our office in San Salvador.
Second, the Civil War has
deepened since 1981. The
guerrilla groups, contrary to
some reports, have become a
significant popular army, ca
pable of launching major at
tacks throughout the
northern and eastern parts of
the country.
Increasingly, the army
relies on bombing raids to try
and defeat the growing insur
gency . Killing becomes indis
criminate when one drops
bombs, and again these
human rights abuses are just
not documented. Without the
support of the majority of its
people, the Salvadoran go
vernment increasingly relies
on violence to maintain its
control. The deaths have only
become harder to count.
Whether they have decreased

is another question.
DAILY: Finally, why has the
military followed this course?
What lies at the root of the
human rights abuses?
OLIVA: Let me take this op
portunity to say that funda
mentally the conflict in El
Salvador is an internal one. Its
roots lie deeply in a structure
of injustice, in which the
poor, and by that I mean the
overwhelming majority, have
been made to endure for
more than five decades
hunger, poverty, prisons and
severe repression in order to
keep the Salvadoran system
stable for the benefit of a
minority.
As the poor began to or
ganize and their population
grew, so did the government's
systematic abuse of human
rights, the disappearances,
the tortures. . . . The social
structure allowed no room
for reform. Democratic ef
forts were denied violently.
People began to arm them
selves against government
repression. Repression has
deepened, U.S. military aid
has grown 100 times, and the
guerrilla groups have become
a popular army. El Salvador is
embroiled in a civil war. As
long as negotiations are not
sincerely pursued, human
rights abuses will continue.

regimes of Arturo Molina and
General Romero. Demands by
popular organizations were
answered by government
repression. Priests, students,
teachers, workers, peasants
and professionals began to
disappear. The church's in
volvement in efforts to defend
human rights grew accord
ingly.
Archbishop Oscar Romero
began to denounce publicly
the abuses of the military, and
he needed solid evidence for
his denunciations. Socorro
luridico thus gained the status
of the Legal Aid Office of the
Archbishop of San Salvador
and became an objective
source outside of the govern

ment for data gathering and
testimony about human rights
abuse. In other words, our
original purpose was trans
formed by the rise of govern
ment repression and the need
for documentation of human
rights abuses.
DAILY: In the U.S., Amnesty
International, Americas Watch
and other human rights organi
zations have often been at
tacked as "left leaning." Have
similar accusations been made
of Socorro luridico?
OLIVA: Of course. We have
been heavily criticized for
being partial. Yet, our answer
to that accusation is really
very basic. It is the poor, the
teachers, the students, the
workers who are demanding
human rights protection from
the repression of the military
and the government. It is
these groups who have asked
the church to denounce
human rights abuses, and they
have often risked their own
lives to help us document the
abuses. At the same time,
Socorro Juridico does not
argue that the guerrilla
groups, known to many Sal
vadorans as the popular army,

do not also violate human
rights. All one can say is that
they do so in much smaller
proportions and in a very dif
ferent manner.
DAILY: What's the differ
ence?
OLIVA: We identify two
types of violence, not to justify
the violence of the left, but to
identify its nature so that we
can understand it. The first
type is that of the government,
which is an institutionalization
of force, of repression, under
which violence is systematical
ly committed by the state with
impunity.
The second is violence as a
response to the tirst. As one
might imagine, those popular
organizations who also
opposed the government in a
more peaceful manner previ
ously have, for the most part,
chosen to defend themselves
against government repres
sions as a response to the
denial of their human, demo
cratic rights.
I repeat this is not a jus
tification for the violence of
the left but a facl of S a I -
vadoran history.
DAILY: President Reagan and
members of his administration
point to the decline in docu
mented deaths from human
rights abuses as evidence of an
improving situation. What is the
extent of the decline and what
does it mean?
OLIVA: Documented deaths

have indeed dropped from
12,000 in 1981 to about 6000 in
1982 and 1983. This fact re
quires a careful explanation,
however.
First, repression has
changed locations and charac
ter. It is now primarily in the
countryside and done on a
collective level rather than a
selective level. Both of these
characteristics make
documentation near
impossible. For 1982, for ex
ample, we have 6000 undocu
mented but reported deaths.
And, many massacres have
simply gone unreported to
our office in San Salvador.
Second, the Civil War has
deepened since 1981. The
guerrilla groups, contrary to
some reports, have become a
significant popular army, ca
pable of launching major at
tacks throughout the
northern and eastern parts of
the country.
Increasingly, the army
relies on bombing raids to try
and defeat the growing insur
gency . Killing becomes indis
criminate when one drops
bombs, and again these
human rights abuses are just
not documented. Without the
support of the majority of its
people, the Salvadoran go
vernment increasingly relies
on violence to maintain its
control. The deaths have only
become harder to count.
Whether they have decreased

is another question.
DAILY: Finally, why has the
military followed this course?
What lies at the root of the
human rights abuses?
OLIVA: Let me take this op
portunity to say that funda
mentally the conflict in El
Salvador is an internal one. Its
roots lie deeply in a structure
of injustice, in which the
poor, and by that I mean the
overwhelming majority, have
been made to endure for
more than five decades
hunger, poverty, prisons and
severe repression in order to
keep the Salvadoran system
stable for the benefit of a
minority.
As the poor began to or
ganize and their population
grew, so did the government's
systematic abuse of human
rights, the disappearances,
the tortures. . . . The social
structure allowed no room
for reform. Democratic ef
forts were denied violently.
People began to arm them
selves against government
repression. Repression has
deepened, U.S. military aid
has grown 100 times, and the
guerrilla groups have become
a popular army. El Salvador is
embroiled in a civil war. As
long as negotiations are not
sincerely pursued, human
rights abuses will continue.
Stanford student Brad Bar ham is
spending the year travelling through
Mexico and Central America, report
ing for The Daily on issues facing the
region. This is the first of those
reports.

Jose Armando Oliva, a
professor of electrical engi
neering and philosophy at the
Ibero-Arnerican University in
Mexico City, is an outspoken
opponent of human rights vio
lations in El Salvador.
The Daily interviewed him in
his Mexico City office.
DAILY: Armando, when and
why did you leave El Salvador?
OLIVA: I left at the end of
February in 1981 for two
reasons. First and most impor
tantly, my brother and sister
in-law disappeared on Feb. 3,
1981, after being taken away
by the Treasury Police. To this
date, we only know that they
are 'missing.' Second, I was a
member of an organization of
faculty members in San Sal

vador called the General Uni
versity Assembly. The military
had recently intervened and
banned further meetings,
and, as a result, they had my
name on their list.
As you can imagine, the dis
appearance of my brother and
his wife had a tremendous
emotional impact on my family
And, although no direct
threat was made against my
life, I left with my wife and
nine-month-old son and came
to Mexico City. It was here
that I began to work with
Socorro juidico (an indepen
dent human rights organiza
tion in El Salvador).
DAILY: Why was Socorro
luridico formed?
OLIVA: It was created in

1975 by some Salvadorans who
were affiliated with the
Archdiocese of San Salvador
in order to protest the legal
rights of workers and unions.
That was a time of growing
labor strife in San Salvador.
DAILY: How did Socorro
luridico then become a human
rights organization?

rights situation in El Salvador
deteriorated rapidly between
1975 and 1979 under the
