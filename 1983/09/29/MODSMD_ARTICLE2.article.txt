# Buy-as-you-eat plan pleases light eaters

Residents of the recently con
structed Sterling Quad have
reacted positively to a new con
cept in University Food Service:
a pricing system which requires
students to pay for what they eat
on an item-by-item basis rather
than just paying a lump sum for
the whole quarter.
Sophomore Stacy Torres com
mented, "I like it because if you
miss meals you don't pay for
them."
Torres said the food is good,
adding, "It (the system) just
eliminates waste, so that's good."
Others are impressed by the
efficiency of the operation.
"The lines are a lot shorter
than I thought they'd be," said
junior David Fogelsong. "Last
night's dinner was really good."
The new system was instituted
because of what Sterling Food
Service manager Kirby Tubb
called "a great concern that with
the present system heavy eaters
eat heavy and the light eaters
subsidize them."
Maxine Anderson, University
Food Service manager, said, "It's
new to Stanford ... we think it's
an exciting kind of thing."
Anderson said that if the sys
tem proves successful, the Uni
versity may consider changing
from Food Service's present
standard-price menu to the new
plan.
In the Sterling Quad system,

each student pays a base rate at
the beginning of the quarter
which is translated into food
points. Each student's account
balance is then stored on a com
puter.
When students go to get food,
they insert their meal card into
the "IDentificard" electronic
control system which deducts the
proper number of food points
from the account.
For fall quarter, the base rate
is $698, of which $459 goes to
overhead and fixed costs and
$23<» is for food points.
Tubb said this divisor, of costs
is "pretty standard in terms ot
pricing. She also said that the
base rate was calculated based
upon what the staff feels the
average student needs to main
tain a balanced diet.
The $239 is roughly equivalent
to 23,900 food points of which
19,200 must be used and are non
refundable. The remaining 4700
may be used or carried forward
to the next quarter.
Those who eat less than
average can accumulate points
throughout the quarter that may
be refunded in cash — up to $47
for fall quarter — at the end of the
quarter.
Also, if a student exhausts his
allotment of food points before
the end of the quarter, he may
purchase additional points in lots
ot 2000 for $20.
