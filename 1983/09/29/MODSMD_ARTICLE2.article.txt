# Buy-as-you-eat plan pleases light eaters
## 
### SHELLY WENTKER Staff writer 
Residents of the recently con
structed Sterling Quad have
reacted positively to a new con
cept in University Food Service:
a pricing system which requires
students to pay for what they eat
on an item-by-item basis rather
than just paying a lump sum for
the whole quarter.
Sophomore Stacy Torres com
mented, "I like it because if you
miss meals you don't pay for
them."
Torres said the food is good,
adding, "It (the system) just
eliminates waste, so that's good."
Others are impressed by the
efficiency of the operation.
"The lines are a lot shorter
than I thought they'd be," said
junior David Fogelsong. "Last
night's dinner was really good."
The new system was instituted
because of what Sterling Food
Service manager Kirby Tubb
called "a great concern that with
the present system heavy eaters
eat heavy and the light eaters
subsidize them."
Maxine Anderson, University
Food Service manager, said, "It's
new to Stanford ... we think it's
an exciting kind of thing."
Anderson said that if the sys
tem proves successful, the Uni
versity may consider changing
from Food Service's present
standard-price menu to the new
plan.
In the Sterling Quad system,

each student pays a base rate at
the beginning of the quarter
which is translated into food
points. Each student's account
balance is then stored on a com
puter.
When students go to get food,
they insert their meal card into
the "IDentificard" electronic
control system which deducts the
proper number of food points
from the account.
For fall quarter, the base rate
is $698, of which $459 goes to
overhead and fixed costs and
$23<» is for food points.
Tubb said this divisor, of costs
is "pretty standard in terms ot
pricing. She also said that the
base rate was calculated based
upon what the staff feels the
average student needs to main
tain a balanced diet.
The $239 is roughly equivalent
to 23,900 food points of which
19,200 must be used and are non
refundable. The remaining 4700
may be used or carried forward
to the next quarter.
Those who eat less than
average can accumulate points
throughout the quarter that may
be refunded in cash — up to $47
for fall quarter — at the end of the
quarter.
Also, if a student exhausts his
allotment of food points before
the end of the quarter, he may
purchase additional points in lots
ot 2000 for $20.
Tubb said the main reason for

having the minimum point score
was to insure that students eat
properly.
"We were afraid that when
students were given a lot of
choices, their nutritional intake
might go down," she explained.
"In order to pinch pennies, they
might not eat properly."
Despite the food-point pricing,
non-residents of Sterling Quad

with regular meal plans may eat
there as can those with no food
plan.
"Everything is priced by two
prices. The first is food points
and the second is cash (for non
residents)," Tubb said.
But there is a difference be
tween the two prices. Tubb
pointed out that since residents
pay overhead and fixed costs in
the base rate at the beginning of
the quarter, the food points are
food cost only. The cash prices,
on the other hand, include over
head costs.

Tubb also said that the system
uses food points so that it is not
necessary to have two different
cash prices for each item. "We
didn't want people to get
confused," she said.
The managers of Sterling Food
Service have been pricing indi
vidual items since last spring, ac
cording to Tubb. Currently, this
is done manually, placing a bur
den on the staff.
Tubb cited an example of the
difficulty: If the price of sugar
were to go up, the prices of all
items using sugar in their recipes

would have to be recalculated
manually. Therefore, "we hope
to have it computerized later in
the year," she said.
But computerizing Food Ser
vice would not be the first inno
vation of the Sterling Quad ser
vice.
"We do offer more variety and
choices," Tubb said. "Our food
line is three things: regular hot
food similar to other halls, an in
ternational or special of the day,
and take out."
While offering more types of
food, Sterling also offers longer

hours for eating.
"We have extended meal
hours to accomodate people's
schedules," Tubb explained, ad
ding that not all lines will be open
during all serving hours.
Although the extended hours
may be welcomed by students,
lubb said they also cause some
what of a "production problem''
for the staff because just as they
complete serving one meal, they
must immediately prepare for
serving the next one.
In spite of these problems,
Tubb commented, "We're very

pleased with how it's going . .
we'll be working out some of the
rough points."
Anderson said there will be an
"on-going evaluation" by resi
dent faculty members, students,
and Food Service personnel
Tubb said, "Righ! now, wp-f
not sure it's going to cost an> less
than the other system. It could
benefit the students costwise,
but we don't yet know.
"This is going to be a learning

the students."

having the minimum point score
was to insure that students eat
properly.
"We were afraid that when
students were given a lot of
choices, their nutritional intake
might go down," she explained.
"In order to pinch pennies, they
might not eat properly."
Despite the food-point pricing,
non-residents of Sterling Quad

with regular meal plans may eat
there as can those with no food
plan.
"Everything is priced by two
prices. The first is food points
and the second is cash (for non
residents)," Tubb said.
But there is a difference be
tween the two prices. Tubb
pointed out that since residents
pay overhead and fixed costs in
the base rate at the beginning of
the quarter, the food points are
food cost only. The cash prices,
on the other hand, include over
head costs.

Tubb also said that the system
uses food points so that it is not
necessary to have two different
cash prices for each item. "We
didn't want people to get
confused," she said.
The managers of Sterling Food
Service have been pricing indi
vidual items since last spring, ac
cording to Tubb. Currently, this
is done manually, placing a bur
den on the staff.
Tubb cited an example of the
difficulty: If the price of sugar
were to go up, the prices of all
items using sugar in their recipes

would have to be recalculated
manually. Therefore, "we hope
to have it computerized later in
the year," she said.
But computerizing Food Ser
vice would not be the first inno
vation of the Sterling Quad ser
vice.
"We do offer more variety and
choices," Tubb said. "Our food
line is three things: regular hot
food similar to other halls, an in
ternational or special of the day,
and take out."
While offering more types of
food, Sterling also offers longer

hours for eating.
"We have extended meal
hours to accomodate people's
schedules," Tubb explained, ad
ding that not all lines will be open
during all serving hours.
Although the extended hours
may be welcomed by students,
lubb said they also cause some
what of a "production problem''
for the staff because just as they
complete serving one meal, they
must immediately prepare for
serving the next one.
In spite of these problems,
Tubb commented, "We're very

pleased with how it's going . .
we'll be working out some of the
rough points."
Anderson said there will be an
"on-going evaluation" by resi
dent faculty members, students,
and Food Service personnel
Tubb said, "Righ! now, wp-f
not sure it's going to cost an> less
than the other system. It could
benefit the students costwise,
but we don't yet know.
"This is going to be a learning
experience for us as well as fur
the students."
Residents of the recently con
structed Sterling Quad have
reacted positively to a new con
cept in University Food Service:
a pricing system which requires
students to pay for what they eat
on an item-by-item basis rather
than just paying a lump sum for
the whole quarter.
Sophomore Stacy Torres com
mented, "I like it because if you
miss meals you don't pay for
them."
Torres said the food is good,
adding, "It (the system) just
eliminates waste, so that's good."
Others are impressed by the
efficiency of the operation.
"The lines are a lot shorter
than I thought they'd be," said
junior David Fogelsong. "Last
night's dinner was really good."
The new system was instituted
because of what Sterling Food
Service manager Kirby Tubb
called "a great concern that with
the present system heavy eaters
eat heavy and the light eaters
subsidize them."
Maxine Anderson, University
Food Service manager, said, "It's
new to Stanford ... we think it's
an exciting kind of thing."
Anderson said that if the sys
tem proves successful, the Uni
versity may consider changing
from Food Service's present
standard-price menu to the new
plan.
In the Sterling Quad system,

each student pays a base rate at
the beginning of the quarter
which is translated into food
points. Each student's account
balance is then stored on a com
puter.
When students go to get food,
they insert their meal card into
the "IDentificard" electronic
control system which deducts the
proper number of food points
from the account.
For fall quarter, the base rate
is $698, of which $459 goes to
overhead and fixed costs and
$23<» is for food points.
Tubb said this divisor, of costs
is "pretty standard in terms ot
pricing. She also said that the
base rate was calculated based
upon what the staff feels the
average student needs to main
tain a balanced diet.
The $239 is roughly equivalent
to 23,900 food points of which
19,200 must be used and are non
refundable. The remaining 4700
may be used or carried forward
to the next quarter.
Those who eat less than
average can accumulate points
throughout the quarter that may
be refunded in cash — up to $47
for fall quarter — at the end of the
quarter.
Also, if a student exhausts his
allotment of food points before
the end of the quarter, he may
purchase additional points in lots
ot 2000 for $20.
