## Berns Aside • Adam Berns Card football: talent there, changes needed 
### 
In the past few weeks, sportswriters have had a
field da\ cutting down the Stanford football team.
From lello to simply "bad," the press has not
spared adjectives. One recent headline even in
sinuated that the season might be as good as
over.
Writing off the Stanford football team so soon,
however, might be a mistake. While the team is
definitely weak in some areas, talent exists in
other areas to compensate.
With clever game plans, some coaching
gambles and a little bit luck, other coaches have
been able to overcome similar adversity. The
question is: Will Wiggin and his coaches make
the necessarv changes, and can they motivate tht
team?
One example in recent Stanford historv which
closely parallels the current situation is when
Rod Dowhower was Stanford's football coach in
1979. Losing two of his first three games, includ
ing an embarrassing 17-13 loss to Army,
Dowhower was under pressure not just to win,
but to play a freshman quarterback named John
Elway.
Dowhower responded by cleverly working El
way into the system and making changes on both
offense and defense.
Stanford went on that season to score victories
over Arizona, Arizona State and UCLA, and
achieved a tie with USC.
What the Dowhower experience proved,
however, is that a team which looks bad earlv on
can improve drastically if the right changes are
made.
Stanford is not lacking in talent, despite what
the newspaper clippings say. In fact, for a Car
dinal team, this group of players is probably
more talented than average, despite some ob
vious weaknesses.
The defense has been responsible for
only 53 points in three games, including an ad
mirable showing against a strong Oklahoma
team.
But that does not necessarily mean that the
defense has plaved well. There have been break
downs, and the defense seems to lack heart.
In the fourth quarter, when a defense is
supposed to show its true colors, the* Cardinal

seems to make all its errors. Oklahoma, Illinois
and San Jose State were all able to run right over
Stanford late in the game, despite being shut
down, or at least contained, earlier.
But in all the talk about Stanford football, it's
the offense which is the major source of con
tern. Teams just don't win games without an of
fensive line and running attack —or do they?
San Francisco 49er Head Coach Bill Walsh has
never underestimated the importance of a strong
running game, a strong line and a great back. But
he proved in 1981 that with clever coaching, an
innovative game plan and intensity a team can win
without these essential ingredients.
In 1981, Walsh had undersized Dan Audick
pla\ing the crucial left tackle position and had no
running backs worthy enough to note. But he did
have an excellent quarterback and a strong
group of receivers.
The result: He took the NFL by surprise, set
ting up the run late in the game by passing early
on.
The Cardinal has problems similar to those of
the 1981 49ers. The offensive line has been
plagued by injuries; there are no outstanding
running backs, and therefore, no running game
to speak of.
But Stanford seems to have the same in
gredients that San Francisco used to make the
right changes.
Although he's a bit raw, freshman quarterback
lohn Paye appears to have the talent, scrambling
ability and poise to make the offense work, and
Fmile Harry, Mike Tolliver and Eric Mullins could
be the best group of receivers in the nation.
But enough about why Stanford can be a better
football team. The real question is what can be
done.
first of all, the running backs are not catching
enough passes. The leading receiver in the back
field sophomore Kevin Scott, has only 10 catches
for bfl yards and currently is out with a sprained
ri.l't shoulder. Freshman Thomas Henley has
only nve receptions and fullback Rob Moore has
tour receptions for only 11 yards.
Besides the dump-off passes in the flats, the
running backs need to get in the pass patterns
more, particularly the 6 to 15-yard routes.

Well-conceived screen plays are another pos
sibility, and against blitzing teams it might be the
only way to slow down the pass rush.
Against Illinois, Scott got a touchdown pass on
one of these screens — before it was called back
for holding—and got eight yards the other time
he ran a screen pass. Against San lose State, one
of the most effective routes ot the day was a
screen pass thrown to Thomas Henley on a blitz
which went for 29 yards.
But if the running backs are not able to do fhe
job, there is alwavs the one back offense which
has been successfully used by several pro teams.
The Cardinal could then use two tight ends or
three wide receivers; Stanford has depth at both
positions.
Tolliver and Mullins could also both be used as
receivers out of the backlield in order to get iso
lated on a linebacker, something which Tolliver
has already done on a couple of plays.
On defense, more risks need to be taken, par
ticularly late in the game. For example, with eight
minutes left against San lose State, the Cardinal
had the Spartans on their own 8-yard line, third
and-seven.
Unfortunately, cornerback Kevin Baird played
a good 20 yards off his man, and San lose State
quarterback Jon Carlson was easily able to com
plete an 8-vard-out pattern to receiver Keith
McDonald.
The most important factor, however, may be
motivation.
It is not the talent. Stanford has shown that it
can both move the ball, and stop the other team
from doing so. San Jose State was not a better
team than Stanford, but it had a good game plan,
and it wanted to win.
Saturday is Stanford's second season. As silly
as it might sound, with Arizona and LJSC - the two
strongest teams in the Pacific-10 Confernce — on
probation, the Cardinal's Rose Bowl chances are
not that unrealistic. Neither UCLA or Washing
ton is especially strong this yeir, and Arizona
State returns only two starters on defense.
But the real question is whether the coaches
and players believe in themselves. If adjustments
are not made both in philosophy and attitude, a
record of 1-10 or 2-9 is a real possibility.

the necessarv changes, and can they motivate tht
team?
One example in recent Stanford historv which
closely parallels the current situation is when
Rod Dowhower was Stanford's football coach in
1979. Losing two of his first three games, includ
ing an embarrassing 17-13 loss to Army,
Dowhower was under pressure not just to win,
but to play a freshman quarterback named John
Elway.
Dowhower responded by cleverly working El
way into the system and making changes on both
offense and defense.
Stanford went on that season to score victories
over Arizona, Arizona State and UCLA, and
achieved a tie with USC.
What the Dowhower experience proved,
however, is that a team which looks bad earlv on
can improve drastically if the right changes are
made.
Stanford is not lacking in talent, despite what
the newspaper clippings say. In fact, for a Car
dinal team, this group of players is probably
more talented than average, despite some ob
vious weaknesses.
The defense has been responsible for
only 53 points in three games, including an ad
mirable showing against a strong Oklahoma
team.
But that does not necessarily mean that the
defense has plaved well. There have been break
downs, and the defense seems to lack heart.
In the fourth quarter, when a defense is
supposed to show its true colors, the* Cardinal

seems to make all its errors. Oklahoma, Illinois
and San Jose State were all able to run right over
Stanford late in the game, despite being shut
down, or at least contained, earlier.
But in all the talk about Stanford football, it's
the offense which is the major source of con
tern. Teams just don't win games without an of
fensive line and running attack —or do they?
San Francisco 49er Head Coach Bill Walsh has
never underestimated the importance of a strong
running game, a strong line and a great back. But
he proved in 1981 that with clever coaching, an
innovative game plan and intensity a team can win
without these essential ingredients.
In 1981, Walsh had undersized Dan Audick
pla\ing the crucial left tackle position and had no
running backs worthy enough to note. But he did
have an excellent quarterback and a strong
group of receivers.
The result: He took the NFL by surprise, set
ting up the run late in the game by passing early
on.
The Cardinal has problems similar to those of
the 1981 49ers. The offensive line has been
plagued by injuries; there are no outstanding
running backs, and therefore, no running game
to speak of.
But Stanford seems to have the same in
gredients that San Francisco used to make the
right changes.
Although he's a bit raw, freshman quarterback
lohn Paye appears to have the talent, scrambling
ability and poise to make the offense work, and
Fmile Harry, Mike Tolliver and Eric Mullins could
be the best group of receivers in the nation.
But enough about why Stanford can be a better
football team. The real question is what can be
done.
first of all, the running backs are not catching
enough passes. The leading receiver in the back
field sophomore Kevin Scott, has only 10 catches
for bfl yards and currently is out with a sprained
ri.l't shoulder. Freshman Thomas Henley has
only nve receptions and fullback Rob Moore has
tour receptions for only 11 yards.
Besides the dump-off passes in the flats, the
running backs need to get in the pass patterns
more, particularly the 6 to 15-yard routes.

Well-conceived screen plays are another pos
sibility, and against blitzing teams it might be the
only way to slow down the pass rush.
Against Illinois, Scott got a touchdown pass on
one of these screens — before it was called back
for holding—and got eight yards the other time
he ran a screen pass. Against San lose State, one
of the most effective routes ot the day was a
screen pass thrown to Thomas Henley on a blitz
which went for 29 yards.
But if the running backs are not able to do fhe
job, there is alwavs the one back offense which
has been successfully used by several pro teams.
The Cardinal could then use two tight ends or
three wide receivers; Stanford has depth at both
positions.
Tolliver and Mullins could also both be used as
receivers out of the backlield in order to get iso
lated on a linebacker, something which Tolliver
has already done on a couple of plays.
On defense, more risks need to be taken, par
ticularly late in the game. For example, with eight
minutes left against San lose State, the Cardinal
had the Spartans on their own 8-yard line, third
and-seven.
Unfortunately, cornerback Kevin Baird played
a good 20 yards off his man, and San lose State
quarterback Jon Carlson was easily able to com
plete an 8-vard-out pattern to receiver Keith
McDonald.
The most important factor, however, may be
motivation.
It is not the talent. Stanford has shown that it
can both move the ball, and stop the other team
from doing so. San Jose State was not a better
team than Stanford, but it had a good game plan,
and it wanted to win.
Saturday is Stanford's second season. As silly
as it might sound, with Arizona and LJSC - the two
strongest teams in the Pacific-10 Confernce — on
probation, the Cardinal's Rose Bowl chances are
not that unrealistic. Neither UCLA or Washing
ton is especially strong this yeir, and Arizona
State returns only two starters on defense.
But the real question is whether the coaches
and players believe in themselves. If adjustments
are not made both in philosophy and attitude, a
record of 1-10 or 2-9 is a real possibility.
In the past few weeks, sportswriters have had a
field da\ cutting down the Stanford football team.
From lello to simply "bad," the press has not
spared adjectives. One recent headline even in
sinuated that the season might be as good as
over.
Writing off the Stanford football team so soon,
however, might be a mistake. While the team is
definitely weak in some areas, talent exists in
other areas to compensate.
With clever game plans, some coaching
gambles and a little bit luck, other coaches have
been able to overcome similar adversity. The
question is: Will Wiggin and his coaches make
the necessarv changes, and can they motivate tht
team?
