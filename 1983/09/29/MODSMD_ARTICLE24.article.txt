# Avenge earlier loss
## Card kilters KO Cal 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
The Stanford women's field hockey team
played better than its best yesterday against
UC-Berkeley.
"We lost last Saturday 2-1 to Cal and I
thought in that game we played the best we had
all season," said Stanford Coach Onnie Kille
fer.
But yesterday at the brand new Field Hockey
Field (behind Harry Maloney soccer field), Kil
lefer's kilters beat that same Cal team 3-1.
And it was as convincing a 3-1 decision as
they come.
While the two teams battled to a 1-1 tie in the
first half, the Cardinal put the Bears away early
in the second, scoring a pair of goals in the
first seven minutes of the period. The win
upped Stanford's overall record to 4-3 and its
NorPac conference mark to 2-1.
Stanford struck first, with sophomore Karen
Chamberlain firing one into the back of the net
22 minutes into the game, which consists of two
35-minute halves. Freshman Mary Chung and
senior Patsy Huntington were credited with as
sists on the play.
Ihe Cardinal kilters saw their lead vanish
before the end of the half, however, when
Cal's Kathy Forbey scored with just 1:10
remaining.
Killefer and company needed less than a min

ute to score their first goal of the second half,
an unassisted score by Andea Wolpert. Then,
only six minutes later, Stanford put its cross
bay rivals away for good on a Jennifer Bleakley
goal.
While it was a tightly controlled game with a
below average number of shots on goal, Stan
ford still managed to dominate all statistical
categories. Killefer, however, said Cal was at a
disadvantage playing on Stanford's grass field,
since the Bears play on astroturf at Berkeley.
Stanford took 21 shots on goal to Cal's
seven, of which Card goalie Bonnie Warner
saved six. The Bears' goalie had but five saves.
Stanford also had nine penalty corners. Cal, a
team that features two players on the U.S.
Olympic team, had one.
Most of the play in the second half was con
centrated in the Bears' half of the field, due in
part to Stanford's crisp, accuracte passing.
Killefer said the team's goal is to reach the
NCAA tournament, held later this year at
Temple, Pa. To get there, Stanford would have
to be ranked first in the Western Region.
San lose State is presently the top-rated team
in the region and Cal was ranked second and
Stanford third before yesterday's game.
Stanford's next home contest is next Wed
nesday at 3:30 p.m. against Chico State, a team
it had defeated once already this season.
