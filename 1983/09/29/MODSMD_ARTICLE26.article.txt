## Beineix gives us fevered pretension 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
In the opening moments ot The
Moon in the Cutter, a faceless man
stalks a young woman through the
streets and alleys of Marseilles, in a
chase characterized by their compet
ing footsteps — like a famous suspense
sequence in the old Jacques Tourneur
Cat People. Then the camera tilts up to
reveal a gorgeous, finger-painted liq
uid moon and slowly pans along the
body of the woman, now dead, her
disordered clothes indi» ating rape
m"fcmn*+r> her hand pointing to
suicide.
Directed by Jean-Jacques Beineix
and < »hot by Philippe Rousselot, who
collaborated on the chic teaser Diva,
this sequence has a super-achieved
clarity bordering on the hallucinatory,
like the shock scenes in Brian De
Palma's Dressed to Kill. But whereas
De Palma invested every object on
screen with a menacing, glistening
sharpness — we could have been watch
ing an expressionistic illustration of
Gordon Liddy's dictum that any room
contains dozens of potentially lethal
weapons — menace is one element
Beineix has left out of The Moon in the
Cutter. Three minutes into the film
we've already learned most of what we
need to know about this movie, in
which a rape and suicide are pre
sented in exquisite decorative tableau.
In Diva, Beineix demonstrated his
finesse at sleight of hand, juggling twin
plots and twin figures and manipulat
ing complex set pieces with a cool, dry
wit Diva was a weightless, pretty ob/et
d'art — of no enduring value, but as
pleasantly diverting as the high tech
toys that kept showing up in the char
acters' apartments. Besides, it had the
virtue of unpretentiousness; you
weren't intended to take it seriously.
But wit is another element in scarce
supply in The Moon in the Gutter,
which is portentous and overheated.
Beineix (who wrote the st rip! with

Olivier Mergault) culled the theme —
the dream of a man trapped in a ghetto
to escape to a cleaner, finer life — from
dozens of Warner Brothers movies of
the Depression years, like Dead End
and City for Conquest, and it's yet an
other movie that unearths and over
scales the cliches of old Hollywood
movies without explaining why this
swoony nonsense has any resonance
for the filmmakers. The Moon in the
Cutter, with its giddy Gabriel Vared
score and its dazzling surfaces,
belongs on a double bill with that
other junk art pastiche, Francis Cop
pola's One from the Heart.
Nastassia Kinski, who played the
muse of Las Vegas (or something) in
One from the Heart, is cast here as an
other kind of romantic fantasy — The
Rich Woman in the Sports Car Who
Wants to Take the Hero Away from All
This. The hero, Gerard (the amazingly
intuitive French actor Gerard Depar
dieu, in arguably his worst perfor
mance), obsessed with the search for
his sister's rapist, finds respite from
his gutter existence when Loretta
(Kinski) appears, a shawl draped
around her arms, her lipstick as red as
the blood in the street where
Gerard's sister died, to pick up her
drunken, slumming brother (Vittorio
Mezzogiorno). All of Kinski's subse
quent scenes have a lush, baroque ar
tificiality, and you can get high on the
orchestrations behind them. They also
lack logic, which seems to be a
deliberate choice: Gerard and
Loretta, on their third meeting, pur
chase a marriage license from a monk
in a cathedral at the top of a winding
mountain path which is like one of
Mad King Ludwig's fairy tale castles.
The problem is that the slum scenes,
which are meant to jar with these Hol
lywood reveries (Kinski is costumed,
posed and shot like an American movie
queen — say, Elizabeth Taylor in A Place

in the Sun or Giant), share their fake
ness. The bars Gerard hangs out in
look like Brecht staged by Busby
Berkeley — their crumminess is highly
photogenic. He lives in a rooming
house presided over by Lola (Bertice
Reading), a black woman of Amazon
proportions with a chaotic tangle of
black hair and hyperdistinct diction —
she reads her lines as if she'd learned
them phonetically or as if she were in
structing a very slow child.
The rest of the household — rujned
father (Gabriel Monnet}, creepy, efts
solute brother (Dominique Pinon),
sluttish-loyal inamorata (Victoria
Abril, who plays roughly the same role
in I Married a Shadow) — are just as
much a part of the decor as the vast
billboard outside their building that
invites us to "Try Another World."
(That sign figures prominently in so
many shots that after a while I won
dered if every window in the house
looked out on it. It seems to be hung
on a wrap-around cyclorama.)
Beineix is a phenomenal technician,
and a couple of the sequences — an in
dustrial accident dream (or flash
back?) in which a laser beam
transforms itself into a cylinder of light
spilling under the door of a darkened
hospital room, and a lead pipe fight in
a warehouse in which the combatants
seem to be wielding light sabers — are
marvels of technique and imagination.
Besides, only a gifted director in
Beineix's league (or Coppola's) ever
goes wrong in quite this crazy,
feverish way. In making this movie
Beineix lost touch with anything of
substance — narrative, character,
thematic balance, humor — that might
have guided him back onto this planet.
But The Moon in the Gutter, though it
is a terrible movie (and painful to sit
through), probably won't be a serious
gaffe for Beineix in the long run. We
just have to wait it out, patiently.
