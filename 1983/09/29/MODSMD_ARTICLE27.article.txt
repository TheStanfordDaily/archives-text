# Rohmer's 'Pauline': nice but silly
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
After 15 years of turning out
literate, elegant comedies of
manners, Eric Rohmer has his
technique tuned to a fine
point. Pauline at the Beach is
an impeccable piece of
filmmaking, so seamlessly
staged and shot (by Nestor Al
mendros) that not a trace of
work shows. This enjoyable
trifle suggests Feydeau slowed
down to vacation pace.
Fifteen-year-old Pauline
(Amanda Langlet) goes on
holiday with her cousin
Marion (Arielle Dombasle), an
almost-divorcee; Marion is
chased by an old beau, the
earnest windsurfer Pierre
(Pascal Creggory), but
prefers an affair with a bal
ding older man, an eth
nologist, Henri (Feodor
Atkine), who casually sleeps
with a woman who peddles
candy on the nearby beach
(Rosette). The sixth member
of the company, Simon de la
Brosse, plays a teenager, Syl
vain, who gives Pauline her
first taste of sex and becomes
innocently involved in the
romantic convolutions of the
four adults.
Arielle Dombasle, a sun
haired beauty with long, long
legs (she played Beatrice
Romand's matchmaking pal in
Rohmer's last picture, Le Beau
Mariage), has a slightly dippy
sexiness, like the young Ann-
Margret had. When she tells
the others, "I want to burn
with love," and shudders with
the pleasure of anticipation,
she reminds you of Marilyn
Monroe in The Seven Year
Itch describing her hot
weather strategy of putting
her undies in the icebox. Roh
mer's amusement at the
dreamy fatuousness of this
young woman won't stop
viewers from melting when
she appears in her skin-tight
one-piece bathing suit, or
when the other utterly silly
character, jealous, pouting
Pierre, registers hurt in his
wide, vulnerable little-boy
eyes. Pauline at the Beach is
the sunniest, most photogenic
farce imaginable — that's a large
part of its appeal, and of its
limitations, too. For when
Feydeau is made leisurely and
set on a beach, it tends to
become soap opera, despite
the ironic tone, the intelligent
dialogue, the high degree of
craftsmanship, and the
"behaved" acting. Rohmer's
actors are so natural that
when Arielle Dombasle
preens ever so slightly for the

Rohmer called his first se
ries of comedies Six Moral
Tales, and Pauline is the third
of another series, Comedies
and Proverbs. And though it's
more fun than either of the
last two, The Aviator's Wife
and Le Beau Mariage (and it
stays with you longer), it is still
a thesis comedy, too neatly
worked out to present much
of a challenge to an audience.
This time there are two
messages: that no one in love
acts as he or she expected to,
and that children can be much
sharper-eyed and wiser than
their elders. Neither of these
theses is likely to knock down
any skyscrapers, and there is
a tiresome regularity to the
way in which Rohmer carries
them out — especially the

second, which is far more
dubious than the first.
Pauline, who handles her
sexual experience much more
calmly than anyone else (does
Rohmer really know any
adolescents?), counters her
cousin's sentimental
rationalizing with home truths
like "You say love can't be
forced, yet you want to force
Henri to love you," and she
berates Sylvain for becoming
entangled in the adults'
"game." And at the end she
knows more than Marion
about what went on between
Henri and the candy vendor —
her smile is sage, superior,
even condescending. Eric
Rohmer has made a movie
about a kid who discovered
that the adults around her
lived in a house of cards but
was smart enough not to
tumble it — a premise as un
exciting as it is unlikely.
