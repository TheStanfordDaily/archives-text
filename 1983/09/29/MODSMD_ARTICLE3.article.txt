# Second try for grad student
## Dean refuses Mosher appeal 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Senior staff writer 
Steven Mosher has lost his latest
appeal to win reinstatement as a
doctoral candidate in Stanford's An
thropology Department.
In a letter mailed to Mosher Sept.
20, Vice-Provost Gerald Lieberman
denied Mosher's second appeal,
saying his termination was "irrelev
ant to your writings on abortion and
infantic ide in China."
Mosher, author of the highly pub
licized book, Broken Earth, has re
peatedly claimed that he was dismis
sed because of an article he pub
lished in a popular Taiwanese maga
zine in which he documented
forced abortions and infanticide in
the People's Republic of China.
Mosher has said the University
bowed to pressure from China in
terminating his doctoral candidacy
in the Anthropology Department.
The Stanford anthropology faculty
voted 11-0 last February to expel
Mosher from the doctoral program,
following the recommendations of
an investigative committee that
found Mosher — guilty of "illegal
and seriously unethical conduct"
while in China.

Mosher appealed his case in April
to Norman Wess e 11 s, dean of
Humanities and Sciences, ancJ then
took the case to Lieberman in )ulv
after Wessells denied his first ap
peal.
Mosher can appeal his grievance
to University President Donald Ken
nedy, who may agree or decline to
consider it.
Mosher told The Daily Friday
before he knew that his grievance
had been denied — that he would
appeal Lieberman's decision to
Kennedy if the dean ruled against
him.
Lieberman accepted the recom
mendations of Assoc. Dean Al
bert Cielpi, who served as a review
officer in the appeal. Gelpi con
cluded that "only the proper facts
and criteria were brought to bear,
that no procedural irregularities af
fected the decision, and that the de
cision was a reasonable one."
Mosher has denied the validity of
the investigative report upon which
the decision to dismiss him was
based, claiming that the allegations
contained in the report cannot be
supported.
