# Reagan library
## Faculty to discuss controversy today 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
The controversy over the Hoover
Institution, which has been brewing
quietly all >>ummer long, is expected
to be taken up with renewed fervor
this afternoon when the Faculty
Senate convenes in a closed session
for its first meeting of the academic
year.
Although the subject is not on the
agenda for the meeting, faculty op
ponents of the Hoover Institution
and of a proposal to house the
Ronald Reagan library, museum and
center for public affairs here plan
to question the administration's
course at the meeting.
A group of faculty members, led
by Political Science Prof. John Man
ley and English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz, met Tuesday night to map out
the course of action for today's
meeting.
The plan, according to Manley, is
to convince the University to be
more open about its inquiries into
the Hoover Institution and the pro
posed Reagan center. If not, he and
his supporters might try to convince
the senate to establish its own panel
to look into the issues.

Already a number of Hoover
related committees ate in existence.
A permanent four-member Board ot
Trustees committee was established
earlier this month to examine the
refartfon?.hfp tretwct-n ,jnd
the rest of the University, and two
University committees are examin
ing the merits of the proposed
Reagan center.
One of them, a panel chaired by
Prof. James Rosse, is examining the
potential academic merits of having
a presidential library, museum and
public affairs center here. It is
scheduled to report to Kennedy by
Oct. 1, but members are in dis
agreement over a number of issues
and the report may be late.
The other, a site committee
chaired by University planner Phil
Williams, is weighing the merits of
three possible sites for the pro
posed center: one on Palm Drive, in
front of the Oval, and two in the
foothills, one immediately on
campus, and the other on Stanford
property adjacent to Page Mill Road
and Interstate 280.
A Hoover Institution committee,
chaired by Senior Fellow Martin An
derson, is also discussing the mat
ter.
Hut Manley and Rebholz, who led
a petition drive against Hoover last
spring, and their supporters don't
think the trustee committee, which
has been meeting in closed session,
is an acceptable response to the
Senate's call last spring for a full in
quiry into the role of Hoover within
the University. And they believe
that the early deadlines given to the
committees looking into the Reagan

center are an effort to force the ap
proval of the proposal before oppo
sition has a chance to develop.
Efforts to change the role of cur
rent committees or to establish an
other panel will certainly meet with
opposition from the many faculty
members who believe that the Uni
versity has gone far enough in
looking into Hoover. Many of them
charge that the attacks on Hoover
are politically motivated and believe
that a Reagan center here would be
an invaluable academic asset to the
community.
In another development that adds
fuel to the fire over Hoover, 20
members of the Stanford law

School faculty signed a letter to the
Rosse committee expressing skep
ticism about the merits of the three
element Reagan complex.
In general, the law professors'
opposition to the library stemmed
from a belief that presidential ar
chives ought not exist outside the
National Archives in Washington D.C.
But they said that the proposed
museum "would serve no particular
purpose" and worried that building
a center for public affairs, which
would be run by the Hoover Institu
tion, "would amount to a major ex
pansion of the functions and influ
ence of the Hoover Institution on
campus."
