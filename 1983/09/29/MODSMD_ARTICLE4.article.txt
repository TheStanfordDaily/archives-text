## Faculty to discuss controversy today 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
The controversy over the Hoover
Institution, which has been brewing
quietly all >>ummer long, is expected
to be taken up with renewed fervor
this afternoon when the Faculty
Senate convenes in a closed session
for its first meeting of the academic
year.
Although the subject is not on the
agenda for the meeting, faculty op
ponents of the Hoover Institution
and of a proposal to house the
Ronald Reagan library, museum and
center for public affairs here plan
to question the administration's
course at the meeting.
A group of faculty members, led
by Political Science Prof. John Man
ley and English Prof. Ronald Reb
holz, met Tuesday night to map out
the course of action for today's
meeting.
The plan, according to Manley, is
to convince the University to be
more open about its inquiries into
the Hoover Institution and the pro
posed Reagan center. If not, he and
his supporters might try to convince
the senate to establish its own panel
to look into the issues.

Already a number of Hoover
related committees ate in existence.
A permanent four-member Board ot
Trustees committee was established
earlier this month to examine the
refartfon?.hfp tretwct-n ,jnd
the rest of the University, and two
University committees are examin
ing the merits of the proposed
Reagan center.
One of them, a panel chaired by
Prof. James Rosse, is examining the
potential academic merits of having
a presidential library, museum and
public affairs center here. It is
scheduled to report to Kennedy by
Oct. 1, but members are in dis
agreement over a number of issues
and the report may be late.
The other, a site committee
chaired by University planner Phil
Williams, is weighing the merits of
three possible sites for the pro
posed center: one on Palm Drive, in
front of the Oval, and two in the
foothills, one immediately on
campus, and the other on Stanford
property adjacent to Page Mill Road
and Interstate 280.
