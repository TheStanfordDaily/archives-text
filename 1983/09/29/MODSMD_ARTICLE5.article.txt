# Outgoing Provost Hastorf prefers academics to administrative duties
## 
### USA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Provost Albert Hastorf, who will resign his post next
August, says that although his career as Stanford's
second-ranking academic official has been "interesting
ind tun," he is more than eager to resume academic
work.
I feel as if I've paid my tithe to the University," he
said, referring to his five-year stint as provost. "I think
t's very important that faculty take on administrative
positions, but not for so long that they forget who they
ire."
Hefore becoming provost, Hastorf taught courses in
pyschology arid human biology. Hastorf says he plans
,r> teach in those departments next year, although he
i- esn't know what courses he will teach yet.
I ant thinking seriously about teaching a course I
'aught several years ago on the history of psychology,"
hp said. "I've also continued to do a little teaching in
1 human biology while I was provost — I hope to do that
more responsibly now." He added that he is equally
to get back to research work.
Hasicaily, I'm eager to get back to my trade," he
'•aid.

Hastorf considers the reorganization of undergrad
uate education which took place during his term to be
his most significant achievement as provost. He also
mentioned his continual participation in and support
of the revitalization of the Western Culture program.
"Ten years ago, we had at Stanford a course called
Western Civilization that had pretty much lost its zip,"
he said. "I was instrumental in closing down Western
Civilization and the recreation of the Western Culture
program, specifically History 1-2-3 which was
developed by Cordon Craig."
Commenting on the Western Culture program itself,
Hastorf said he feels that "part of the academic game is
change, continual change. There comes a point when
even the greatest new course isn't new anymore.
Someday the present Western Culture department is
going to need revision; there's going to be a new fac
ulty with new ways to teach the course. For now, I feel
the department's doing a good job."
Hastorf feels that the most important task facing his
successor is simply to keep up the quality of education
at Stanford. "The provost's |ob is mainly concerned
with keeping up the quality, moralitv anH pv<~oii~—. j n

the faculty, and to think of ways to make education ex
citng," he said.
Hastorf said he had no ideas on who his successor
might be, but he said a search committee will probably
be established soon. "Don (University President
Kennedy) and I have had a talk or two about the com
mittee, but I'm not sure exactly when the committee will
be formed," he said. "I imagine he will announce a
committee within a month."
When Kennedy left his provost post to become presi
dent of the University, Hastorf took over as acting
provost. Most likely, the search committee will choose
a candidate before Hastorf leaves office, but it is possi
ble another temporary provost may have to fill his seat,
Hastorf said.
"No one will automatically become acting provost,"
he said, "but there are a number of perfectly capable
vice-provosts Kennedy can choose from."
Hastorf said that tellow faculty members have asked
him if he will miss working with Kennedy. "Sure I will.
But some people are acting as if when I leave the
provost's office, I'm going away," he said. "I'm not
going anywhere."
