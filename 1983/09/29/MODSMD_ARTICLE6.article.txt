Andropov belittles arms offer
Moscow—President Yuri Andropov yesterday belit
tled the Reagan adminstration's commitment to arms
control in one of the sharpest attacks on U.S. foreign
policy by a Soviet leader in recent years.
In a lengthy statement devoted entirely to U.S.-
Soviet relations, Andropov accused Washington of
pu rsui ng a " militarist course" that raised the danger of
nuclear war. He dismissed President Reagan's latest
proposals on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in
Europe and warned that the Soviet Union would re
spond to any attempt to disrupt the existing strategic
balance.

Commenting tor the first time on the shooting down
of a South Korean airliner by the Soviet Union, An
dropov blamed the United States for what he called a
"sophisticated provocation, masterminded by U.S
special services" and "an example of extreme adven
turism in politics." He said that Washington had
exploited the furor surrounding the incident to step
up the arms race.
Western diplomats who heard Andropov's state
ment, whichwas read byanannouncerasthelead item
on state television news, expressed surprise at thevir
ulence of his language and the bleakness with which
he depicted the current state of international rela
tions. They said he appeared to be mounting a coun
teroffensive following a series of attacks by President
Reagan and senior U.S. officials on the Soviet Union.
While Soviet rhetoric against the United States has
reflected the deterioration in relations between the
superpowers during the past few years, diplomatic
observers here could recall few precedents for the
sweeping nature of Andropov's attacks. The Soviet
leader seemed to rule all hope of any breakthrough in
the Geneva talks on intermediate nuclear weapons on
the basis ol present U.S. proposals.
In Washington, the State Department responded
with a statement saying, "The world will be deeply dis
appointed with the Andropov statement. He has tor
the first time associated the highest levels of the Soviet
government with the pathetic charge that the Soviet
shootdown of a civilian aircraft was the result of a
'sophisticated provocation, organized by U.S. special
services.' The international community expects and
awaits a different answer.
"The world will be disappointed that Mr. An
dropov's response to the president's major arms
control initiative at the United Nations is a threatening
restatement of their longstanding position that the
Soviets will maintain their monopoly of intermediate
range missiles in Europe. For our part we will continue
to work in Geneva for a negotiated settlement that
strengthens international peace and security."
House OKs 18-month limit
Washington—The House of Representatives yester
day rejected the argument that Lebanon may become
another Vietnam and adopted a resolution authoriz
ing President Reagan to keep U.S. Marines there as
long as 18 more months.
After a full day of sharp debate, the House voted
270-161 to back its leaders and accept a bipartisan a
greement they worked out two weeks ago with the
White House.
The 18-month authorization bill will come up for
final action Thursday in the Senate, where approval
seems likely but not certain.

The resolution authorized deployment until March
1985, if the president considers it necessary. But it also
asserts that the deployment is controlled by the War
Powers Resolution, a 1973 law giving Congress some
say over the dispatch of U.S troops to hostile areas in
foreign countries. Reagan resisted such an assertion
of congressional prerogative, but has agreed to sign
the resolution any way.
The 1600 person Marine forces was sent to Lebanon
one year ago today as part of the multinational peace
keeping force. Five Marines have been killed—one by
a mine, four by shellfire and 38 have been wounded.
The administration says it is not clear who is firing
shells at the U.S. troops.
The Marine casualties, and the confused situation in
Lebanon, prompted numerous House members from
both parties to argue yesterday that approval of an ex
tended deployment could be the first step in a gradual
escalation similar to the early years of the war in Viet
nam.
"Just as in Vietnam, we are asking young men to
fight and possibly die in a war our government is not
committed to win," shouted Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-
Fla) in a refrain heard throughout the day. "If we are
there to fight, we are far too tew. If we are there to die,
we are far too many."
But House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass)
who addressed a hushed house chamber in firm but
quiet tones at the end of the debate, said the analogy
was not accurate.
"I believe," O'Neill said, "that this resolution
clearly limits the scope and role of the United States
forces in Lebanon sothatthedangerofa Vietnam-type
escalation is avoided."
Lebanese army and militia meet
Beirut, Lebanon—Representatives of the Lebanese
army and of the warring, rival militia factions here met
yesterday and agreed to set up a jointcenterto super
vise the shakvcease-fi re that went in to effect Monday.

But shortly after the two-hour meeting—involving
officials of the army, the Christian Maronites, the
Druze and the Shia Moslems—the Druze objected to
the scheduled reopening of Beirut International air
port today and threated to block it.
The statement charged that the airport, which is
guarded by U.S. Marines here, was used as a military
base during the recent fighting. Therefore, the decla
ration by the progressive socialist party of Druze
leader Malid Jumblatt said reopening the airport
would be a serious violation of the cease fire.
"Orders have been issued toall (Druze) forces to re
spond immediately to such an attempt/'the statement
said of anv effort to reopen the airport.
Lebanese government officials argued that opening
the airport to civilian airlines is vital to Lebanon's re
turn to normal after three weeks of what amounted to
civil war.
The officials reportedly asked Saudi Arabia, which
helped put the cease-fire agreement together, to in
tercede with the Druze leadership to guarantee that
there would be no interference with the reopening of
normal civilian airline traffic.
It was shellfire from the Druze, some of which
landed in the Marines' positions, that resulted in clo
sure of the airport Aug. 28.
Nixon asks for more Latin aid
Washington—Former President Richard Nixon took
anotherstep back into publiclifeyesterday, advising a
commission headed by former aide Henry Kissinger to
aim toward a "very bold" expansion of United States
aid to Latin America.
"A long-term program for Latin America will costfar
more and will take much more time" than the Marshall
Plan that rebuilt Europeafter World War 11, Nixon said
after two hours of closed-door discussion with the Kis
singer commission on Central America. "But it is
money that needs to be spent."

Nixon's appearance marked the first time a govern
ment body has publicly requested his policy advise
since he resigned the presidency in disgrace in 1974.
"It's the first time he has done this in any public
way," Nixon spokesman Nicholas Kume said Pri
vately, though, he has been consulted on various mat
ters at the highest levels."
Kissinger, Nixon's assistant for National Security
Affairs and, later, Secretary of State, has invited all
former presidents to testify before the commission.
Former Presidents Carter and Ford appeared in August,
appeared in August.
Still, the scene seemed a page from the debates of a
decade ago; Richard Nixon, older and grayer but still
vigorous, discoursing ebulliently to the press on
foreign affairs with Kissinger silent at his elbow.
His message was a strong endorsement of the
Reagan administration's aid to El Salvador and to pro-
American guerrillas fighting the leftist government of
Nicaragua.
"I remember when Castro took over Cuba, (people
asked) 'what could little Cuba do to the United States?'
and now they are saying, 'what does it matter if little El
Salvador goes communist?' The answer is, it can do a
great deal."

Losers held a narrow lead over gainers among the

Andropov belittles arms offer
Moscow—President Yuri Andropov yesterday belit
tled the Reagan adminstration's commitment to arms
control in one of the sharpest attacks on U.S. foreign
policy by a Soviet leader in recent years.
In a lengthy statement devoted entirely to U.S.-
Soviet relations, Andropov accused Washington of
pu rsui ng a " militarist course" that raised the danger of
nuclear war. He dismissed President Reagan's latest
proposals on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in
Europe and warned that the Soviet Union would re
spond to any attempt to disrupt the existing strategic
balance.

From the wires of the Associated Press and the Los Angeles I imes Washington Post News Servic

Commenting tor the first time on the shooting down
of a South Korean airliner by the Soviet Union, An
dropov blamed the United States for what he called a
"sophisticated provocation, masterminded by U.S
special services" and "an example of extreme adven
turism in politics." He said that Washington had
exploited the furor surrounding the incident to step
up the arms race.
Western diplomats who heard Andropov's state
ment, whichwas read byanannouncerasthelead item
on state television news, expressed surprise at thevir
ulence of his language and the bleakness with which
he depicted the current state of international rela
tions. They said he appeared to be mounting a coun
teroffensive following a series of attacks by President
Reagan and senior U.S. officials on the Soviet Union.
While Soviet rhetoric against the United States has
reflected the deterioration in relations between the
superpowers during the past few years, diplomatic
observers here could recall few precedents for the
sweeping nature of Andropov's attacks. The Soviet
leader seemed to rule all hope of any breakthrough in
the Geneva talks on intermediate nuclear weapons on
the basis ol present U.S. proposals.
In Washington, the State Department responded
with a statement saying, "The world will be deeply dis
appointed with the Andropov statement. He has tor
the first time associated the highest levels of the Soviet
government with the pathetic charge that the Soviet
shootdown of a civilian aircraft was the result of a
'sophisticated provocation, organized by U.S. special
services.' The international community expects and
awaits a different answer.
"The world will be disappointed that Mr. An
dropov's response to the president's major arms
control initiative at the United Nations is a threatening
restatement of their longstanding position that the
Soviets will maintain their monopoly of intermediate
range missiles in Europe. For our part we will continue
to work in Geneva for a negotiated settlement that
strengthens international peace and security."
House OKs 18-month limit
Washington—The House of Representatives yester
day rejected the argument that Lebanon may become
another Vietnam and adopted a resolution authoriz
ing President Reagan to keep U.S. Marines there as
long as 18 more months.
After a full day of sharp debate, the House voted
270-161 to back its leaders and accept a bipartisan a
greement they worked out two weeks ago with the
White House.
The 18-month authorization bill will come up for
final action Thursday in the Senate, where approval
seems likely but not certain.

The resolution authorized deployment until March
1985, if the president considers it necessary. But it also
asserts that the deployment is controlled by the War
Powers Resolution, a 1973 law giving Congress some
say over the dispatch of U.S troops to hostile areas in
foreign countries. Reagan resisted such an assertion
of congressional prerogative, but has agreed to sign
the resolution any way.
The 1600 person Marine forces was sent to Lebanon
one year ago today as part of the multinational peace
keeping force. Five Marines have been killed—one by
a mine, four by shellfire and 38 have been wounded.
The administration says it is not clear who is firing
shells at the U.S. troops.
The Marine casualties, and the confused situation in
Lebanon, prompted numerous House members from
both parties to argue yesterday that approval of an ex
tended deployment could be the first step in a gradual
escalation similar to the early years of the war in Viet
nam.
"Just as in Vietnam, we are asking young men to
fight and possibly die in a war our government is not
committed to win," shouted Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-
Fla) in a refrain heard throughout the day. "If we are
there to fight, we are far too tew. If we are there to die,
we are far too many."
But House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass)
who addressed a hushed house chamber in firm but
quiet tones at the end of the debate, said the analogy
was not accurate.
"I believe," O'Neill said, "that this resolution
clearly limits the scope and role of the United States
forces in Lebanon sothatthedangerofa Vietnam-type
escalation is avoided."
Lebanese army and militia meet
Beirut, Lebanon—Representatives of the Lebanese
army and of the warring, rival militia factions here met
yesterday and agreed to set up a jointcenterto super
vise the shakvcease-fi re that went in to effect Monday.

But shortly after the two-hour meeting—involving
officials of the army, the Christian Maronites, the
Druze and the Shia Moslems—the Druze objected to
the scheduled reopening of Beirut International air
port today and threated to block it.
The statement charged that the airport, which is
guarded by U.S. Marines here, was used as a military
base during the recent fighting. Therefore, the decla
ration by the progressive socialist party of Druze
leader Malid Jumblatt said reopening the airport
would be a serious violation of the cease fire.
"Orders have been issued toall (Druze) forces to re
spond immediately to such an attempt/'the statement
said of anv effort to reopen the airport.
Lebanese government officials argued that opening
the airport to civilian airlines is vital to Lebanon's re
turn to normal after three weeks of what amounted to
civil war.
The officials reportedly asked Saudi Arabia, which
helped put the cease-fire agreement together, to in
tercede with the Druze leadership to guarantee that
there would be no interference with the reopening of
normal civilian airline traffic.
It was shellfire from the Druze, some of which
landed in the Marines' positions, that resulted in clo
sure of the airport Aug. 28.
Nixon asks for more Latin aid
Washington—Former President Richard Nixon took
anotherstep back into publiclifeyesterday, advising a
commission headed by former aide Henry Kissinger to
aim toward a "very bold" expansion of United States
aid to Latin America.
"A long-term program for Latin America will costfar
more and will take much more time" than the Marshall
Plan that rebuilt Europeafter World War 11, Nixon said
after two hours of closed-door discussion with the Kis
singer commission on Central America. "But it is
money that needs to be spent."
