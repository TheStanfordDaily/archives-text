# New energy plant will cut costs
## 
### JOHN CHILCOTT 
A recently approved energy plant
could cut in half the cost the Univer
sity pays for electricity, University
officials have announced.
Raymond Kaiser Engineers and
General Electric may build, own and
operate a $40 million cogeneration
plant here, Vice-President William
Massy reported recently to the
Board of Trustees.
Ihe outside joint venture could
reduce the cost of a kilowatt-hour
from 9 cents to about 5 cents in the
future, saving the University approx
imately $5.6 million during the tirst
year alone, according lo |a>on

Mavis, associate vice-president of
facilities and services.
1 he new facility would use natural
gas to fuel a gas turbine which
would simultaneously generate
electricity and steam to meet all the
University's energy needs. It would
be located north of the present en
ergy plant, near Campus Drive and
lordan Wav.
Ihe existing plant would be used
to produce steam if the new plant
broke down Under the plan cur
rently being considered, Kaiser En
gineers and General Electric would
be responsible tor the design, con
itiuction and operation of the plant,

leaving the University to assume the
risk for fluctuations in fuel and heat
rate costs.
Of the projected million sav
ings over 15 years, some $VS million
would be allocated to the Hospital,
auxiliaries and the University operat
ing budget, which would savt* about
$1.2 million the first vear. The re
maining $21 million would benefit
the University's research programs
by reducing indirect costs, making
Stanford more competitive for out
side funding and allowing research
directors to expand their activities.
The first cogeneration plant
started operation in New York City
in the late 19th century. Stanford
had its own cogeneration facility
until it became cheaper to buy elec
tricity from Pacific Gas and Electric.

Despite improved technology and
sharply rising fuel costs, cogenera
tion was not economically feasible
for the University until 1978 when
Congress passed the Public Utility
Regulatory Act requiring public
utilities to buy energy from more ef
ficient cogeneration plants.
Jerry Ostrander, director of
Utilities Systems, first proposed a

Stanford plant in 1980. Lengthy
negotiations with Kaiser Engineers
and General Electric over the pricing
risk to Stanford finally concluded on
Sept. 7.
Pending approval from the Board
at its December meeting, construc
tion could start this spring and oper
ation could begin by late summer of
1985.
