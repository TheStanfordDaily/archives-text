### REBECCA SPEER 
George Nash introduced to a Hoover Institution au
dience yesterday "one of the most accomplished yet
elusive and misunderstood figures in American his
tory."
But the mystery man shouldn't have needed much in
troduction at Hoover Tower; he's Herbert Hoover.
Nash spoke at Hoover to promote his new book,
J he Lite of Herbert Hoover the Fngineer, 1874-1914,
a thoroughly-researched biography of Hoover's pre
publit life.
Ihe book, the first product of Nash's research on
the late president, traces Hoover's life from his lowa
boyhood and years as a Stanford student to his rise to

fortune as a consulting engineer and expert on mine
finance.
Nash said he hopes to impress upon readers
Hoover's determination not only to succeed, but
"once having done well, to do good."
The author emphasized yesterday that Hoover's
vears at Stanford were instrumental in guiding him
beyond material prosperity to a life of "humanitarian
public service."
Nash, a Harvard graduate, first became interested in
Hoover's life in 1975 when the Herbert Hoover
Presidential Library Association in lowa asked him to
conduct full-scale scholarly research on the former
president.
