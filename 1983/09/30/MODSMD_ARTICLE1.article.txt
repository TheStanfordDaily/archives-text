# Kennedy reassures faculty on Reagan library
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL DAVID SANCHEZ 
University President Donald Kennedy sought yester
day to reassure the Faculty Senate that it will have a
chance to be heard before any decision is made on the
controversial proposal to house a Ronald Reagan library
and complex here.
Faculty opponents of the complex had charged that
the University was attempting to rush approval of the
library through this month before opposition had a
chance to organize, but Kennedy told the Senate that
"there remains ample time for discussion."
"There will not be any final action committing the
University in any way" to the proposal at the upcoming
Board of Trustees meeting, Kennedy said, although
there will be discussion of a yet-to-be-released report
from a faculty committee that has been looking into the
merits of the proposed Reagan center.
The proposal for the complex, like all other major
decisions at the University, must be approved by the
Board of Trustees. The next board meeting is scheduled
for Oct. 10; after that, the trustees will not convene until
early December.
Despite Kennedy's assurances, the Senate adopted
22-19 a resolution directing its steering committee to
look into ways the Senate could consider the issues
which affect it with regard to the Reagan library.

An alternative likely to be proposed is that the Senate
form its own committee to discuss the proposed com
plex separately from the panels already established by
the University.
Kennedy was subjected to pointed questioning from
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz and other critics of the
Hoover Institution who questioned, among other
things, the wisdom of extending Hoover's influence by
bringing the Reagan complex to campus.
Kennedy replied that it is as yet uncertain how the
complex would affect Hoover's influence, and said that
the matter is being studied by the faculty committee,
which is headed by Economics Prof. James Rosse.
Law Prof. John Merryman voiced concern that political
pressure to house the complex here might be placed on
the University.
The White House has indicated that Stanford would
be President Reagan's first choice as the site for his
library.
"How free will people within the University be," said
Merryman, "to exercise any very substantial influence
over the decision when the crucial time comes? At what
point is it out of our control? Is it already out of our
control?"
Kennedy replied that there was no need to worry
about political pressure.

"I think that we are quite open-minded," Kennedy
said.
Kennedy also assured the Senate that if it expressed a
strong opinion about the Reagan library, that opinion
would be weighed in the University decision.
"What I'm trying to lay to rest here," Kennedy said, "is
the speculation, which I think is a fueled speculation,
that somehow somebody is trying to take the Senate
prerogative to discuss this matter away from the Senate.
And I want to tell you that has never been true, and that it
is not true."
Rebholz later asked Kennedy what the constitutional
power of the Senate was in regard to the decision on the
Reagan complex. Kennedy said the question of constitu
tional authority "is a lot less interesting" than the ques
tion of what the actual requirements are going to be.
"If the president of the University didn't give the fac
ulty an opportunity to be heard loudly and clearly on
matters of such importance," Kennedy said, "I just don't
think he'd last very long."
Kennedy also addressed the question whether the
Board of Trustees' continuing committee on the Hoover
Institution was drifting from its original charge of explor
ing and reassessing the relationship between Hoover
and the University. Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow said
that the committee seemed to be assuming a monitoring
function.

Kennedy said, however, that "there is no implication
at all that we are monitoring and not problem solving.''
Kennedy said that the continuing committee met this
summer to determine the size and scope of the prob
lem, and that its task now is to organize the work it will
do in October.
Kennedy also noted that, although the Reagan library
and the longer-range relationship between Hoover and
the University are largely separate problems, they are
also joined "in a climate of acrimony which I really hop'
you can try earnestly and assiduously to relieve, because
it really is part of the problem, not the solution."
In other action, the Senate heard Kennedy report that
the House Appropriations Committee has in strong lon
guage urged the National Institutes of Health to pay to
universities the full indirect costs of research. That is
good news for Stanford, which had stood to lose mil
lions of dollars in research money had NIH, a major
funder of research on campus, refused to pay all the
indirect — or overhead — costs associated with re
search.
Kennedy also reported that, also in Washington, the
University is lobbying against a proposal to begin taxing
the tuition benefit Stanford and other institutions pay
for children of faculty members to cover tuition at in
stitutions other than those that employ their parents.
