## Viewpoint: Charles Ponce de Leon Grateful Dead counterculture 
### 
Not long ago I attended my first Grateful Dead con
cert. Somehow, in 10 years of concerts, I had never seen
them and suddenly thought it time that I did.
I've never been partial to the Dead, even when their
sound could have been said to be in vogue. To my pre
pubescent ears, their contemporaries—Santana, Jeffer
son Airplane—sounded much better. Even later, when I
knew the band fairly well and was more familiar with
their repertoire, the Dead struck me as boring, the au
thors of few memorable songs. By then the psychedelic
sound was out and the Dead were left behind, with
their cult, unchanged—the lone exponents of a nearly
forgotten style, indelibly associated with an era, a
place, and a way of life. To me they seemed as purely
nostalgic as the Beach Boys, only "cooler."
By the late 1970s the Dead's cult had grown
enormously and had become even more fanatical. But
to me they were anathema. I had discovered the Sex
Pistols and the Clash; suddenly rock and roll mattered
and the hippie paens of the Dead seemed not just ar
chaic but reactionary. Rock had new heroes and old
fashioned bands like the Dead were the enemy, hold
ing their fans in quasi-mystical bondage, stultifying
their minds with pretentious rubbish. The future of
rock and roll was at stake. Lines were drawn: you were
with us or you weren't.

To their fans they are Cod-1 ike; others
loathe them. But the Dead still stand
for something. They have not
changednor have they com
promised. In an industry devoid of
ideals the Dead are idealists.

But as time passed and the new wave fought for and
won a place in the mainstream, I saw its ideals com
promise, the music itself debased. My infatuation with
it faded and was replaced by a detatched cynicism to
wards most contemporary music which lingers to this
day. With few notable exceptions, it is music again, a
commmodity to be purchased and consumed; it no
longer matters, substance has become style.
The Dead incite extremes: to their fans they are
God-like; others loathe them and everything they stand
for. But the Dead still stand for something. They have
not changed, nor have they compromised. In an indus
try devoid of ideals the Dead are idealists—as opposed
to an ephemeral artist like David Bowie, who is commit
ted to nothing except his own ego.
I have never seen a concert like it. This is not to say
that it was the best, far from it. But the performance it
self is only one part of a whirling, dizzying, exhilarating
whole. It is, in every sense of the word, an event.
The crowd was remarkably heterogeneous. It would
have been easy to see the long hair and tie-dye alone
and conclude that this was a gathering of fossils, relics
of the Aquarian Age, and their few progeny. But to do
so would not only be unfair but untrue. How could
anyone ignore the families (not just hippie broods
either), the jocks, the new wavish colors, the short hair,
the Vuarnets, the Nikes, the teens? For a nearly all
white crowd it was quite diverse.
Even more uncommon was the feeling in the air—a
sense of community and fraternity that is totally lacking
at large, impersonal gatherings. It may have been large
but it was by no means impersonal. You didn't have to
know anyone to feel a part of this big, happy family.
People smiled at one another, made friends, met old
friends, and shared food and drink.
They are not ordinary rock fans who each pay $13 to
see their idols; they have more than consumption
habits in common. Each and every one of them is a part
of the show. They know it too and act accordingly—less
inhibited, more individualistic than fans at other con
certs. They play a vital role—inspiring the band, inspir
ing each other. At times the band and audience seem
almost psychically linked: the crowd puts itself in the
Dead's hands, and the band takes them higher.
No two Dead concerts are alike, they tell me. If so, I
think this is a reflection on both the audience and the
band. The band provides the music, the audience pro-

vides an absorbing visual show. With so much to see,
so much going on in the audience, one is never bored.
The crowd is not witnessing history as much as they are
helping create it.
The Dead are noted for never playing the same set
twice and offering different versions of the same songs.
This is in marked contrast to most rock bands, who lit
erally pre-program their performances down to the last
note, for the sake of quality control, and so resemble
the slick entertainment fare that the best rock has al
ways sought to depose. With much of rock slouching
towards Las Vegas, and ninety minutes of choreog
raphed sweat, the Dead's approach is something to be
thankful for, despite their excesses.
Most rock fans are uncritical of their idols—until their
idols are out of vogue when they are often too critical.
Like most consumers, they like to believe that they got
their money's worth even if they didn't. But rock and
roll has always meant more than consumption: it forges
a community of fans, a self-conscious group which dis
tinguishes itself from others. The Dead and their fol
lowing are in this tradition. So is hardcore punk and
heavy metal. These subcultures are almost pathological
in their devotion to their idols and in their disregard of
their idols' flaws.
For the true fan—as opposed to the casual one who
seeks no more than great entertainment—the perform
ance and mythology are inseparable. Their music can
not be judged as music alone; to do so would be to
overlook the mythos of the band, what they stand for,
and totally miss the point. Deep down, beneath all the
cryptic odes to the Dead's artistry, artistry doesn't mat
ter at all. The Dead Head cares not what they play just
as long as they keep playing.
Unlike their contemporaries, who sold out long ago,
the Dead remain committed to the great refusal. They
may sell t-shirts, but they are not show biz; they may
have a major label contract, but for the Dead making
records is a desultory chore. It is the live show that mat
ters, the live show that keeps the spirit alive.
But that is only half the story. As the Dead perpetuate
1960s musical values, their most devoted fans—the
true Dead Heads—perpetuate 60s cultural values.
For them the counterculture never died; of this fact
they are living proof. Like The Dead, they were never
co-opted. They are still committed to the same values
they were fiteen years ago. Their subculture may no
longer be in bloom, as they are so often reminded, but
they still live by the same communitarian ideals, out
side of the rat race.

Deep down, beneath all the cryptic
odes to the Dead's artistry, artistry
doesn't matter at all. The Dead Head

they keep playing

I've never once felt as comfortable, as accepted on
my own terms, as I did at my first Dead concert. The
Dead's subculture is open to casual fans. You needn't
be a diehard to feel like you belong. The punk rock
subculture is elitist, closed to all but the truly commit
ted. No matter how enthusiastic a fan I was, I never felt
at home at a punk show, largley because I never bought
any of the regalia or made a public spectacle of myself. I
never looked like a real fan, only a casual one, and in
the eyes of dogmatic punks that is as good as being a
Foreigner fan—or, worse yet, a Police or Clash fan, one
of the dupes who consumes "corporate new wave."
In years to come The Grateful Dead should be re
membered as gurus of a significant mass movement,
not great artists, because in fact they aren't. Through
out their career they have shown little conceptual
growth, since such growth is tantamount to a sell-out.
They don't challenge their audience, preferring to rest
on their mythology and a weary if well-received style.
Their playing is lethargic, particularly on up-tempo ma
terial, and neither Bob Weir nor )erry Garcia can sing.
Vet, despite it all, a Grateful Dead concert is nothing if
not good vibes. Isn't that what music is all about?
