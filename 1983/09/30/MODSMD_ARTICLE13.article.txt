## Defending yourself at De Guerre pool 
### 
The scene is the De Guerre combat
zone. The sun is blazing and the
bodies are strewn about the concrete.
Some guy starts swimming way over
into my lane. We argue and I swim
away. But on the next go-round he
springs in ambush, grabbing hold of
me and shouting maniacally in my
face.
I stare in disbelief. I really just
came here to enjoy myself, not to
brawl with some lunatic. But no
lifeguard dives in to my rescue. In
fact, no one seems to even raise an
eyebrow. Ho hum, another day at
the swimming pool.
I later wondered what Miss Man
ners would have said: "Congratula
tions, I didn't know your psychia
trists had reinstated your grounds
privileges!" But this may not be a
laughing matter—the same fellow
4 was sitting on a bench glaring at me.
I half expected to find him waiting in
the locker room witfi a butcher
knife.
As I thought back, I realized the
pool hasn't been the idyllic part of
the Stanford experience it's made
out to be. A few days prior to my en
counter with Jaws, my car was hit by
a macadamia nut mogul in a rented
car as I was driving to the pool. And
then while I was in the pool trying to
forget about it, my socks and sneak
ers were stolen out of the locker
room. Who the hell would want my
socks? Well at least I didn't step on a
rusty nail and die on the way back to
my car.
The litany of disasters goes on:
hand sliced on a sharp edge of the
pool, car rammed by a bicyclist in
the pool parking lot. My car seems
to be a homing device for heat
seeking objects.

But there are still plenty of trou
bles in the lap lanes. Slow pokes
blithely get in your way. Some of
them barely even float—they could
probably stay home and get as much
exercise in the bathtub. On the
other end, fanatics slip by you like
buzzsaws with their collection of
hand paddles, leg irnmoblilizers and
assorted medieval torture devices.
Some day I'll come with my out
board motor and really get into it.
But all that gadgetry seems to take
some of the fun out of it.
0.K., so either come in a suit of
armor or stay out of the pool and

parking lot. But even the sidelines
have their complications. Hardly a

sunny day goes by without some
ghostly pale individual uttering self
righteous comments about skin

cancer. Friends in the East levy pre
posterous accusations about me

bleaching my hair. Parents mutter
about neglected schoolwork. Fi
nally, even the people-watching is

mixed. Looking at people can get
you in all sorts of trouble, but that's
another story altogether.
Of course I've considered taking
up different hobbies, like Swedish
theater of the absurd or advanced
estate planning, but even masoch
ism has its limits. I guess I'll just
keep a low profile until winter,
whe.-, the anarchy subsides and the
crowds thin. Then I can enjoy the
pool in peace. At least until I run
into some lunatic with a butcher
knife.
