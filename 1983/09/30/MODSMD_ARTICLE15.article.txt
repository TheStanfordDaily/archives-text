Iran-Iraq War
Last week, for yet another time,
Khomeini's forces invaded Iraqi ter
ritory. Despite the usual claims of
the "final victory," this attack is al
most certainly going to end up the
same way as all others before it:
thousands of dead and wounded,
millions in material losses and no
significant military gains.
This familiar but tragic scenario
has been repeated time after time
ever since the withdrawal of Iraqi
forces from the Iranian territories in
lune, 1982. But despite strong in
ternational condemnation of the war
and repeated calls for peace, Kho
meini insists on continuing the war
for his own personal political be
nefits.
Last week also coincided with the
fourth anniversary of the Iran-Iraq
war. This conflict now stands as the
longest classical war since 1945. Al
though exact statistics are not avail
able, it is generally believed that
during this period the toll in human
casualties has surpassed 350,000
dead and one million wounded,
with more than three million war re
fugees and more than $500 billion in
economic and material losses.
Yet what is really amazing is the
indifference of the American com
munity and media towards this
nightmare. Nowadays we hardly
ever hear about this bloody war and
most of us have almost forgotten
about its very existence. Thanks to
the media, for now our attention
seems to have been focused on
Lebanon. However it only takes a
quick look at the Middle East map
and a hasty review of recent history
to realize that no peace and stability
in the area is even foreseeable as
long as the Iran-Iraq war continues.
So we can go on pretending that this
war does not exist, but our vital
interests in the area as well as the
faith of millions of helpless and in
nocent human beings hinges on the
settlement of this aimless and stupid
war.

Humanitarianism
Americans have always been the
focal point of humanitarian and
philanthropist activities to aid their
fellow human beings who are in
despair. Sometimes, however, our
prejudice tends to force us to
prefer aiding one group over an
other. We should not allow our
prejudices to influence our deci
sions.
Specifically speaking, I am refer
ring to the tens of thousands of
Iranian refugees who have fled the
repressive rule of the Ayatollah
Khomeini, and are helplessly in
search of security and peace of
mind. These innocent people are
mainly ordinary middle class
Iranians who have left all of their
belongings back in their country to
flee the intolerable conditions of
Iran. They lack the most basic
necessities of life: food, medicine,
and clothing. In other words, their
situation is worse than most other
refugees because of the lack of
attention that is given to them.
For this reason, it is called upon
us Americans again to demonstrate
our humanitarian concern and give
aid to a group of people who have
no control over their fate.

Bravo to leadership
As soon as I finished reading
Mathew Weseley's "Leadership be
fore materialism" in The Daily (Sept.

point out to everyone that it's about
time someone (I wish it had been
me) made such a basic idea public
news to this "prestigious,"
ambition-crazed university we all
work in. The best way for me to re
spond to Weseley's thoughts is to
say "Bravo!"
