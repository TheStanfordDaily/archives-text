### HEATHER STONE 
Music Department adminis
trators hope that the almost
completed Braun Music Cen
ter will breathe new life into
Stanford's music program.
The new music center will
promote growth in the under
graduate interest as a result of
the (increased) visibility," said
Albert Cohen, chairman of the
Music Department.
Ihe new center, located on
the edge of White Plaza be
tween the Post Office and
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, is ex
pected to open in January. The

$7.4 million project will house
a music library administrative
offices, classrooms and prac
tice facilities —the music build
ing on the Knoll and Din
kelspiel Auditorium — has
been a problem.
The new center will increase
the number of practice rooms
available from eight to 21 with
potential for five more.
The department has just re
ceived a new grant of $2.3 mil
lion to build a recital hall at the
new facility. The hall will be
better for small Music De
partment performances that

the 500-seat Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium.
Shelley White ho use, a
junior majoring in music, said
that the new facilities should
be more accessible to under
graduates. At the Knoll, lo
cated on the hill behind Flor
ence Moore, she said music
students are isolated as
"non-Stanford beings."
There is one drawback to
the new facility, though,
Whitehouse said, "Vocalists
and flutists will suffer. The
long walk up the hill to the
Knoll was really beneficial for
building lung capacity."



WAITING FOR OBOE: Music Department faculty hope that the new Braun Music Center will
increase their program's visibility on campus.
