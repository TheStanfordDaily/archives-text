# Larkin to receive personal computers
## 
### CLAY CALVERT 
More than 10 personal computer
terminals will be installed in Larkin
House next month, and terminals
may be installed in every room of
Potter House by winter quarter, Uni
versity administrators said.
According to Ralph Gorin, Di
rector of LOTS, the installation of 10
to 20 terminals in the basement of
Larkin is merely "the tip of the
iceberg" in a series of experiments
with personal computers at the Uni
versity.
Stanford is presently negotiating
with several computer manufactur
ers to rally support for further exper-

iments. Hewlett Packard and IBM are
the two companies involved for
computer installation at Potter where
rooms are already equipped with
terminal outlets, according to )an
Van Houten, director of Governor's
Corner.
The personal computers at Larkin,
which are owned by the LOTS Com
puting Facility, were given to the
University by the Digital Equipment
Corporation.
"We're still awaiting a decision
from the University about what kind

of communications network Stan
ford will have in the future," Van
Houten said. She stated that the Uni
versity, in turn, is waiting for a deci
sion from the City of Palo Alto.
A one-unit course, Computer Sci
ence 1, "Using Computers," has
been designed especially for resi
dents of Larkin, directed by Stuart
Reges, to familiarize the students
with the DEC Professional 350 model
terminals. The pass/no credit course
will begin Oct. 3 with initial sessions
working on the LOTS time-sharing
systems.
"The response to the course has
been overwhelming and enthusias-

tic," said Kriss Ferrier, resident assis
tant of Stern Hall. Within four days,
approximately 80 percent of the Lar
kin residents had signed up for the
course, she said.
Larkin resident Steve Hellman
called the program "excellent, espe
cially for those students who can't
afford to buy one (a personal com
puter)."
Reges said Larkin is "part of a pilot
project with the hope that someday
all freshman dorms will have per
sonal computers."


In a survey conducted by graduate students in the Communication
Department last spring, it was found that of the survey base of 529
students, 39 percent had used computers the week before the survey; 83
percent had used computers at some stage in their lives; 62 percent had
used computers at LOTS, 19 percent had used computers at the Center
for Information Technology (CIT); and 84 percent planned to use com
puters before they graduate. The University is currently studying the
possibility of installing computers in dorms. A pilot, 10-terminal com
puter center is scheduled to be installed in Larkin House next month.
