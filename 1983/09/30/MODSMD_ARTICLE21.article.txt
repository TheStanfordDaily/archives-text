# The 						waiting is the hardest part for campus housing walk-ons
## 
### MELINDA ISRAEL 
7:30 a.m. Nervous, bleary
eyed and desperate, they
started to crowd the Tresidder
Union lobby. For the next four
hours, these students fidget,
drink coffee and anxiously
await the announcement of
numbers. Welcome to
"Walk-On 1983."
For students unlucky
enough to be unguaranteed
and unassigned after four
housing draws since spring,
the long wait in limbo finally
ended yesterday, when nearly
170 undergraduate and
graduate autumn vacancies
were filled. Assignments will
trickle on through November,
but the first day, which fea
tures an on-the-spot lottery, is
always the most active. This
year, a record-high of 226 stu
dents participated in the event.

Would it be a coveted Stan
ford housing position or the
uncertain future of off-campus
searching? After a few tense
hours, each student knew his
or her fate.
8:07 a.m. Housing Director
Rodger Whitney promised the
crowd to start soon. Looking
over the approximately 100
people, Whitney optimistically
declared, "If this were all that
was showing up, I think we
could accommodate
everyone." This statement was
greeted by cheers and shouts
to "lock the doors!"
8:15 a.m. I he crowd swelled
to an obviously "unaccom
modatable" number. Whitney
read the rules: all special
priorities for houses will be
honored, and a housing de
posit must be on file for each

participant.
People milled about, putting
in contact lenses, reading time
schedules, and discussing
their chances. Senior Anastas
sios Salessiotis was bitter about
his plight. "I spent one year in
Twain and two years in Bur
bank, and I can't afford a car
(for off-campus commuting)."
Salessiotis said he thinks the
University should build addi
tional dormitories to meet the
demand.
But Unver kaynak, a third
year graduate student, had a
different opinion of the sys
tem. "I think housing is better
every year — my first year,
walk-ons were scarce. The new
housing (350 new under
graduate and 350 new graduate
spaces) is helping." Kaynak
cited the Escondido Village

rent increase as a reason for his
trying to walk-on. "The prices
are comparable to Palo Alto's,"
he said.
Because she turned down a
space in a cooperative house
last spring, senior Suzy Bevash
was back to try for the housing
of her choice. Students who
actually turn down offered
spaces are automatically
placed at the bottom of the
waiting list. "It's really awtul —
a catch-22," she bemoaned.
Bevash had visited the room
she was to occupy in Synergy's
basement. "It's sort of pathetic
when you see all the beautiful
houses on campus," she said.
9:10 a.m. Number-drawing
has started. When asked how
he felt about his "93," senior
lonathan Ross replied, "I'm
not too happy." If he didn't get

housing, Ross planned to look
for a lease in the faculty ghetto.
At the other end of the room,
Margo Whittier, a sophomore,
was ecstatic about her "2."
Whittier was in the process of
deciding between Sterling
Quad and Roble Hall.
10:15 a.m. Spaces are as
signed. One harried staff
member loudly asked
everyone to "move back" from
the tables. Two undergraduate
men clasped hands after sign
ing residence cards for Lambda
Nu.
Assignments continued on
through noon. The final re
sults: Out of the 173 under
graduates and 53 graduates
who participated in the walk
on draw, 115 undergraduates
and all of the graduates were
given housing. Housing direc

tor Whitney described himself
as "very pleased," adding,
"There were a lot of spaces and
a lot of people, but all was ac
complished in a smooth pro
cess. It could be chaos but we
didn't make it a crisis."
For the first time in recent
housing history, every Stan
ford campus space was filled.
"There's not a bed on campus
for students tonight," said
Whitney. He accounted the
all-time high turnout to the
new walk-on date (a week ear
lier than last year) and to the
new spaces added this year.
Whitney surmised that un
guaranteed students, believing
theirchances forcampus hous
ing to be better, hesitated this
year to take off-campus places
immediately.
As to whether the University

should supply more housing
Whitney said he was sure thai
the system is now "pretty
close" to meeting student de
mand.
According to Whitney, if one
takes into account overseas
students and a small incalcula
ble number of those who pre
fer off-campus living, the 87
percent of undergraduates
housed is a respectable figure.
True, 55-60 undergraduates
weren't given spaces, but
Whitney maintains that while
"some are desperate, some are
just shopping."
He stressed, however, that
any student "completely desper
ate, with no housing,"
should go into the housing of
fice on the third floor of Old
Union. "We want to know (of
such a situation)," he said.
