# Pac-10 opener for Stanford
## Card faces ASU's wild blitz and even wilder fans 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Believe it or not, Stanford is still in the
Rose Bowl picture.
After losing its tirst three games, Stan
ford remains undefeated in the Pacific-10
Football Conference, the winner of which
gains an automatic berth in the Rose Bowl.
Stanford, however, is also winless in the
Pac-10. Tomorrow night's game with the
Arizona State Sun Devils in Tempe, Ariz.,
is the Cardinal's league opener.
The key phrase in the above sentence is
"in Tempe, Ariz." The Sun Devils, to put it
simply, rarely lose at home in front of their
wild fans.
Arizona State, 2-0-1 in 1983, boasts a 21-2
home record since 1980 and a 37-6 mark in
the last six seasons and part of a seventh.
Almost as wild as the Sun Devils in the
stands are the Sun Devils on the field.
Arizona State has blitzed everyone except
the waterboy this season and, as a direct
result, has recorded 27 quarterback sacks
in three games.
What makes ASU so proficient at the
blitz is its team speed. While the Sun De
vils' defensive unit is by far the smallest in
the Pac-10, it is also the quickest in league.
"They play a wild brand of football and
it's fun to watch," said Stanford Coach
Paul Wiggin. "When you have that kind of
speed, you can do crazy things."
While ASU's starting linebackers aver
age 6-feet, 202 pounds and the two cor
nerbacks weight in at 166 and 171 pounds,
they should keep Stanford quarterbacks
on their toes (or on the ground) all even
ing.
Just who that Cardinal quarterback will
be has yet to be decided, according to

Wiggin. "We're going to take a look at our
situation ... we have two ways to go," he
said yesterday after practice, referring to
his top two quarterbacks â€” Steve Cottrell
and John Paye.
Taking into account that ASU is the best
blitzing team Stanford has faced this year
and that Cardinal offensive linemen have
had problems handling the blitz, Wiggin is
hesitant to start freshman sensation Paye.
Instead, he may opt for senior Cottrell's
composure, let Paye sit out for the first
quarter, as he has done in the first three
games, and examine the blitz from the
sideline.
"Whether we feel confident with a
young guy, just 18 years old, stepping in
there and dealing with it (the blitz) has not
been decided," Wiggin said. He did men
tion, however, that he was leaning to
wards starting Paye.
Whichever quarterback Wiggin chooses
to start will certainly have his work cut out
for him. As if Stanford's offensive prob
lems aren't bad enough, the loss of
halfback Kevin Scott with a shoulder
sprain leaves the Card without its top
rusher. Scott did not make the trip to
Arizona, but is expected to be back in ac
tion in a week or two.
Freshman Thomas Henley isexpected to
step in for Scott at the halfback position,
although Stan Gill should play as well.
"Henley's coming along in a positive
way," Wiggin said. "I'm not sure, though,
that if we had our drothers that we'd start
him at this time."
Asked if he thought Stanford could pro
duce any sort of meaningful running at
tack without Scott, Wiggin was optimistic.

"Yes, I think we can run, but it has to come
off the pass.
"I really think that once you establish a
phase of your game (the pass), those other
things have to fit in," he continued.
Both receiver Emile Harry (nine recep
tions, 237 yards) and Mike Tolliver (24 re
ceptions, 290 yards) who leads the nation
in receiving, will be counted on.
When on defense, Stanford will have to
stop ASU's lightening quick tailback Darryl
Clack The 5-10, 196-pound sophomore,
who is also a sprinter on the track team,
has gained 306 yards in 43 carries this sea
son, an average of 7.2 yards per carry.
One of those runs was a 78-yard
touchdown scamper last week against
Wichita State. It was the third rushing TD
in as many games for Clack, the Pac-10
Player-of-the-Week last week.
"Their backs run every play like they're
going for a touchdown," Wiggin said, in
reference to Clack, sophomore Mike
Crawford (38 carries, 155 yards) and senior
Dwaine Wright (26 carries, 96 yards).
Sun Devil quarterback Todd Hons, who
last year drove ASU to a last second
touchdown to beat Stanford 21-17, has hit
on .593 of his passes (48-of-81) for 584
yards and three touchdowns.
ASU beat Utah State 39-12 in its opener
and Wichita State 44-14 last week. Two
weeks ago against UCLA, the Sun Devils
saw a 26-10 lead vanish in the fourth quar
ter.
After the Bruins knotted the score at
26-26 late in the game, Sun Devil Coach
Darryl Rogers decided to settle for the tie
and proceeded to run out the clock.
