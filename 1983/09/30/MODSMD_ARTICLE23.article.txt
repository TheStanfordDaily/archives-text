# Creek of the Week
## 
### 
Prof. Mary Sunseri of the
Math Department claimed
that she knows more about
calculus than football when
told that she was chosen as
guest Greek this week. Sun
seri, who comes from a fam
ily of football fans, does
have some knowledge of
the sport.
"But I wish my brother
were here to help me with
this one," she said.
The math professor chose
Stanford over Arizona State
by one point for tomorrow's

game in Arizona. "I think it
will be a close one, but I
want Stanford to win. I think
they have been waiting for
the conference games to
start winning."
Sunseri expressed faith in
the Stanford Cardinal, and
predicted that it will make a
turn-around. "I have a lot of
trust in the team. We have
been down and come up
before, and I think we can
do it again," she said.
Sunseri said that she does
not rule out the Rose Bowl

for the Card this season.
Sunseri does not know if
her math ability will help her
predictions come true, but
in regard to her prediction
for a Stanford victory, Car
dinal fans should hope that
she has derived the right
equation.

with the guest Greek each
week are Daily Sports
Editors Adam Berns and
Mark Zeigler, and KZSU
Sports Director Mike
Lieberman.
