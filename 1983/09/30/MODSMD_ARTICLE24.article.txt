# Last Year
## Arizona State 21, Stanford 17 
### SID SPAETH 
Tempe, Ariz., Oct. 11,1982 â€”
The heralded match-up of the
Stanford offense and Arizona
State defense faded into the
background as an inexperi
enced and unlikely hero drove
Arizona State to a final-minute,
80-yard touchdown drive and a
21-17 win over Stanford here
Saturday night.
Arizona State junior quar
terback Todd Hons negated an
80-yard Stanford drive mo
ments earlier, and steered his
much maligned Sun Devil of
fense to the winning
touchdown over a stunned
Stanford defense in front of
70,823 delirious fans at Sun
Devil Stadium.
"I won't sleep tonight," a
teary-eyed ASU coach Darryl
Rogers said. "I'm emotionally
drained."
After )ohn Elway had picked
his way over the nation's best
and blitzingest defense for a

go-ahead touchdown with 48
seconds remaining, Hons set
off on the "heartbreaker."
Stanford went into its pre
vent defense and Hons began
attacking the unprotected
middle of the Cardinal secon
dary.
A swing pass to running back
Willie Gittens picked up 14
yards, a pass over the middle to
Doug Allen netted 16 and the
Sun Devils were at midfield.
"They were extra-conscious
of the sideline, so I took what
they gave me," Hons said. "The
middle was open."
The Sun Devil front line eas
ily shut down Stanford's
three-man pass rush and Hons
hit Jerome Weatherspoon over
the middle for 22 yards.
"Even though our two
minute offense hadn't pro
duced anything all year, I was
confident," Hons said. "I
could feel that the other guys
were confident."
