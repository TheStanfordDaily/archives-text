# Tolliver passes all others

### DAVE DUTCHER 
There are not many bright spots on a football
team that is 0-3.
Senior wide receiver Mike Tolliver, however,
represents one of the few positive aspects of the
Stanford Cardinal as it faces Arizona State in
search of its first victory tomorrow night.
Not only is Tolliver a standout amongst his
teammates and other conference players, but
the 6-foot senior is one of the best—right now
the best—in the country at what he does.
Tolliver, a Lancaster, California product, leads
the nation in receiving. In three games, he has
caught 24 passes for 290 yards. His eight recep
tions per game average is second to none.
Tolliver's series of receptions, however,
comes at a time when Stanford is suffering
through a period of weak offense. The Cardinal
has been sporadic, unable to sustain long
drives. When Stanford has driven into oppo
nents' territory, it has not been able to score, as
its 10-point scoring average indicates.
In its 23-10 loss to San Jose State last Saturday,
the Cardinal did not get past San lose State's
36-yard line until the third quarter. When they
did reach that point with 7:04 left in the third
period. Mark Harmon missed a field goal.
When Stanford, which gained 414 yards
against San lose State, does move the ball, it
succeeds when Tolliver is involved in the of
fense.
Against San lose State, Tolliver led all receiv
ers with nine catches, which were good for 89
yards. One catch was a key 15-yard reception
which helped set up Harmon's field goal late in
the third quarter.
Tolliver, an industrial engineering major had

still a better game against Illinois. He pulled
down nine aerials, this time good for 147 yards,
and scored Stanford's only points when he
caught a pass from John Paye in the end zone.
Tolliver's catch completed a 80-yard drive, one
of few sustained Cardinal offensives this year.
What was unique about that drive was that
Tolliver accounted for 63 of the 80 yards. The
Paye-Tolliver connection was also responsible
for what Paye will probably never forget—his
first touchdown pass, an 18-yarder in the fourth
quarter of the opening-game loss to Oklahoma.
Tolliver has benefited greatly from the pre
sence in the lineup of junior All-Amercia candi
date Emile Harry. Harry has drawn extra atten
tion from opposing defensive backs, leaving
Tolliver open for medium-range receptions.
Harry, meanwhile, has still had a good share
of success against the opposition—especially on
deep patterns. Although he has only caught
nine passes in three games, Harry gained an
average of 26.3 yards with each reception.
Though this season could be Tolliver's best, he
has been highly productive in both his sopho
more and junior seasons. In 1982, Tolliver
caught 30 passes for a commendable 16.3 aver
age.
Tolliver's sophomore year, however, was
even better. He grabbed 33 passes for 639 yards,
an average pf 19.3 yards per catch. The last mark
is the most impressive because the difference
between good and excellent receivers is often
measured by whether they average more than 20
yards per reception.
