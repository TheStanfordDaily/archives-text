# Vasquez out 4 to 6 weeks
## Booters take on Fullerton State 
### MACKINAY POLHEMUS 
The Stanford men's soccer team may be
able to make up for Tuesday's loss to
Nevada-Las Vegas with a win over Cal-
State Fullerton today at 3 p.m..
But making up for the loss of top scorer
Angel Vasquez will be a tougher job.
Vasquez, who leads the Card with four
goals this season, walked on the field
Tuesday with a partially-mended sprained
right ankle. He was helped off the field
later that day with a broken right ankle.
While Vasquez's fracture is a minor
one, he will be out of action for four to six
weeks. Stanford's last scheduled game is
only six weeks away: Nov. 12 against
Fresno State.

"It's a small fracture but he's out for the
season," Coach Nelson Lodge said.
In Tuesday's 2-0 loss, Vasquez came the
closest of the Stanford players to score,
with a powerful corner kick into the goal
mouth. The Cardinal will truly miss having
another scorer alongside Jorge Titinger.
"Angel will be a serious loss, but we
have made adjustments to make up for
his scoring potential," remarks Lodge.
"We have gone to four midfielders and
two strikers. This allows us to score from
the backside."
On the positive side, the change of the
lineup may allow Stanford to dominate
and control the game at the midfield. In
the last few games when Stanford has got
ten behind, they have not been able to

get control of the ball as quickly as their
opponents.
These new changes will give new roles
to different players and, thereby, create a
broader team effort. Scoring is a large re
sponsibility and should not rest on the
shoulders of only a few players. Since
Vasquez did most of the shooting, his loss
will force Stanford to find other means of
scoring.
"Changes are always good for correct
ing the attitude," Lodge said. "The kids
are accepting the changes." However,
Lodge feels the natural worry of going to a
new system.
"Right now any team is going to be
tough," Lodge said. "We're a good team.
We just have to work a little harder."
