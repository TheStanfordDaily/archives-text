# Oakland rookie fires no-hitter
## 
### 
Oakland (AP) â€” Mike
Warren of the Oakland A s
became the first rookie to
pitch a no-hitter in more
than a decade last night by
blanking the Chicago White
Sox 3-0.
The 22-year-old right
hander walked three and
struck out five in breezing
through the Chicago lineup
to pitch the second no
hitter in the major leagues
this week. Bob Forsch of the
St. Louis Cardinals no-hit
Montreal 3-0 on Monday.
The closest the White Sox
came to a hit was in the

eighth inning when pinch
hitter Mike Squires belted a
long drive that right fielder
Mike Davis, who had just
entered the game as a de
fensive replacement,
caught at the wall near the
372-toot mark for the final
out of the inning.
Warren, 5-3, did not allow
a batter to reach second
base and faced 29 batters,
two over the minimum. In
the third, he walked Scott
Fletcher, who was then
thrown out stealing. Tom
Paciorek drew another walk
in the fifth.
