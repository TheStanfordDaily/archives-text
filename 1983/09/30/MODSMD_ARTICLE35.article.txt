## 'Meditations': Dead center and smack in the middle 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
Meditations in Green, by Stephen
Wright, Scribner's, 342 pp.
$14.95.
When Griffin sees Huey for the
first time, she's walking down the
street backwards and Grif, sitting on
a garbage can, can't even tell she's a
woman. The introduction is approp
riate to a novel about a Vietnam vete
ran entangled in a past that has
erased his life before the war, and
occupied everything after it. The first
of the many flashbacks concerns the
suspicious death of Griffin's unit
commander, and midway through
the novel, when first sergeant Anstin
turns up in what passes for the pre
sent, Griffin's buddy Trips sets out to
frag him, too, as if the war had never
ended.
Don't mistake this impressive first
novel for another moving account of
troubled vets trying to come to grips
with the searing agonies of their past.
Stephen Wright may have based the
book on his own experiences, but
the ghosts who wrote Meditations in
Green don't include any hacks, and
the soldiers of the 1069 th Military In
telligence Group are not the kind
that evoke bathetic sympathy. The
pathetic style and content of this
book give the reader a strong taste of
the alienation suffered by its charac
ters.
A comparison with Catch-22 un
derscores the differences between
the wars these two novels chronicle.

Griffin is a Spec-4, and participates in
combat only accidentally, he inter
prets aerial reconnaissance photos,
directing bombing missions and later
evaluating the effectiveness of the
Agent Orange defoliation campaign.
Yossarian, asa bombardier, might be
similarly seen as a technician re
moved (to a certain degree) from di
rect participation in the "glories" of
combat. Both novels are set on air
bases and are populated by bizarre
support personnel whose experi
ences don't mesh to form a single
plot, but amply communicate each
soldier's inability to find any order or
sense in the war. And both are
often comic, and Meditations even
contains a parallel to the scene of
Snowden's death. But the tragic
tempering of Meditations is much
more pessimistic than Catch-22's.
While Yossarian is certain he'll be
okay if he can only get out of Italy in
one piece, the Vietnam veterans
Griffin and Trips are still obsessed by
the war years after coming home.
An attempt to summarize this
novel's plot would give the mislead
ing impression that it depends on a
chain of causally-linked events, and a
selection of the vignettes that make
up the book would necessarily be in
adequate. What's important to em
phasize is that the striking and varied
scenes do not focus on combat ex
periences, but instead explore the
futile efforts of the characters to
make sense of their involvement in
Vietnam and adapt their behavior to

fit into the abnormal society of the
military.
Counting and mapping bomb pat
terns on reconnaissance film, Griffin
already senses the uselessness of the
campaign. "There was no stopping
these people, they took to craters
like Americans to shopping malls."
As he's trained to take over evaluat
ing the defoliation effort, it becomes
evident that his initial sense of its
absurdity was accurate: "The first
time I heard of Agent Orange, I saw a
piece of fruit wrapped in a trench
coat." The author supplies his
characters with so many one-liners
that the only cliches they utter are
obscene.
The little circles of the crater
photographs introduce a motif that
recurs insistently through Medita
tions in Green — the O that stands
for Orange, that represents the Oxy
gen produced by the green plants'
photosynthesis, that is the shape of
bullet holes, yawning mouths, moan
ing mouths, smoke rings — the O
that stands for Opium, the unnamed
pole of the characters' self
enclosed revolutions. Many of the
episodes are filtered through, or deal
exclusively with, the states of mind
induced by Serious Drug Abuse. The
difficulty of identifying with the
characters and the way they resist the
reader's sympathy grow jointly from
their obsession with the past and
their continuing dependence on
drugs.
In the novel's present, Griffin un

dergoes a bizarre therapy requiring
him to identify with plants and adopt
the regularity of their cycles, a par
ticularly ironic treatment in view of
his experiences in the jungle and
with Agent Orange. The modern
shaman who instructs him wears a
green monk's cowl covered with lit
tle white rings representing the
uroboros, the serpent that eats its
own tail. This symbol of eternity and
closure may explicate the leitmotif O
in the novel. Curled up like a fetus
and consuming its own body and
past, the snake removes itself from
contact with the outside world.
I he flashes of strong emotion that
break through to Griffin and the
other characters are consistently
painful, and never result in success
ful contact with others. During the
massive ground attack on the airbase
that ends the novel, Griffin bends
over one of the stranger, but more
likeable characters, who lies dying:
"He was trying hard to manage the
first emotion he'd felt in months when
he realized he didn't have to. He
didn't have to go for help either."
Under the weight of episodes like
this, the urge to withdraw into an
unpopulated jungle of drug addic
tion becomes more understandable.
The loneliness of one character's
image as he isout on patrol takeson a
somewhat comforting tone — "He
felt like one of those miniature
porcelain divers fallen unnoticed in
the silt of a neglected aquarium."
Suffocated, perhaps — but safe.

Meditations in Green, by Stephen
Wright, Scribner's, 342 pp.
$14.95.
When Griffin sees Huey for the
first time, she's walking down the
street backwards and Grif, sitting on
a garbage can, can't even tell she's a
woman. The introduction is approp
riate to a novel about a Vietnam vete
ran entangled in a past that has
erased his life before the war, and
occupied everything after it. The first
of the many flashbacks concerns the
suspicious death of Griffin's unit
commander, and midway through
the novel, when first sergeant Anstin
turns up in what passes for the pre
sent, Griffin's buddy Trips sets out to
frag him, too, as if the war had never
ended.
Don't mistake this impressive first
novel for another moving account of
troubled vets trying to come to grips
with the searing agonies of their past.
Stephen Wright may have based the
book on his own experiences, but
the ghosts who wrote Meditations in
Green don't include any hacks, and
the soldiers of the 1069 th Military In
telligence Group are not the kind
that evoke bathetic sympathy. The
pathetic style and content of this
book give the reader a strong taste of
the alienation suffered by its charac
ters.
A comparison with Catch-22 un
derscores the differences between
the wars these two novels chronicle.

Griffin is a Spec-4, and participates in
combat only accidentally, he inter
prets aerial reconnaissance photos,
directing bombing missions and later
evaluating the effectiveness of the
Agent Orange defoliation campaign.
Yossarian, asa bombardier, might be
similarly seen as a technician re
moved (to a certain degree) from di
rect participation in the "glories" of
combat. Both novels are set on air
bases and are populated by bizarre
support personnel whose experi
ences don't mesh to form a single
plot, but amply communicate each
soldier's inability to find any order or
sense in the war. And both are
often comic, and Meditations even
contains a parallel to the scene of
Snowden's death. But the tragic
tempering of Meditations is much
more pessimistic than Catch-22's.
While Yossarian is certain he'll be
okay if he can only get out of Italy in
one piece, the Vietnam veterans
Griffin and Trips are still obsessed by
the war years after coming home.
An attempt to summarize this
novel's plot would give the mislead
ing impression that it depends on a
chain of causally-linked events, and a
selection of the vignettes that make
up the book would necessarily be in
adequate. What's important to em
phasize is that the striking and varied
scenes do not focus on combat ex
periences, but instead explore the
futile efforts of the characters to
make sense of their involvement in
Vietnam and adapt their behavior to

fit into the abnormal society of the
military.
Counting and mapping bomb pat
terns on reconnaissance film, Griffin
already senses the uselessness of the
campaign. "There was no stopping
these people, they took to craters
like Americans to shopping malls."
As he's trained to take over evaluat
ing the defoliation effort, it becomes
evident that his initial sense of its
absurdity was accurate: "The first
time I heard of Agent Orange, I saw a
piece of fruit wrapped in a trench
coat." The author supplies his
characters with so many one-liners
that the only cliches they utter are
obscene.
The little circles of the crater
photographs introduce a motif that
recurs insistently through Medita
tions in Green — the O that stands
for Orange, that represents the Oxy
gen produced by the green plants'
photosynthesis, that is the shape of
bullet holes, yawning mouths, moan
ing mouths, smoke rings — the O
that stands for Opium, the unnamed
pole of the characters' self
enclosed revolutions. Many of the
episodes are filtered through, or deal
exclusively with, the states of mind
induced by Serious Drug Abuse. The
difficulty of identifying with the
characters and the way they resist the
