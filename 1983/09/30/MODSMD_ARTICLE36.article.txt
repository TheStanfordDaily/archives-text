## Madison Bell's 'Ensemble' rings true 
### RICHARD BLISS 
The Washington Square En
semble, Madison Smartt
Bell. Viking, $15.75, 342 pp.
Although it begins and ends
with music, The Washington
Square Ensemble teatures not
a band of musicians but a team
of heroin dealers who have
staked out Washington Square
in New York as their territory.
In his impressive first novel,
Madison Bell uses careful and
authentic urban detail to flesh
out a 24-hour period in his
characters' picaresque lives:
their survival skills, the prob
lematic threats that they face
in their small-time operation,
the endless watchfulness and
the pointless, inevitable vio
lence. "Being small-time,"
one character confides, "is
part of the program to not be
worth killing."
But the novel, tor all its tur
bulent realism, is not simply a
sociological examination of
the down-and-out. Bell's
characters experience the
mystery and knowledge that
are the occasional by-products
of loneliness, dissipation and
urban alienation. They live for
more than the cash nexus of
drug trafficking and come to
tenuously support a vision of
solidarity, a strange undertak
ing in a world where loyalty is
only slightly less dangerous
than overconfidence.
Bell creates an ensemble of
voices by allowing each of the -
five main characters to narrate
the events of the day in a
series of interspersed, won- :
dert'ully realized dramatic J
monologues. Johnny B.
Coode, the organizer of the
team, speaks to us in a street
wise, ironic voice, using
humor to maintain constant
control of himself and the
situation. At one point he wor
ries about the promiscuity of
one park regular. "And maybe
it's a big kick for her, but I
think it's a lousy reason to die,
poor Eva the Swede, I get so
tired wondering whether it
will be the Rastas who claim
her flaxen head for a soccer
ball or the Haitians who will
shrink it down to one-quarter
size to add to their voodoo
.relic collections that I have
thought of knocking her off
myself."
This sounds altogether
different from the hopeless
savagery of Holy Mother, a
professional killer turned
junky, mourning a missed op
portunity for revenge. "The
idea that you don't bring your
private trouble to work is a
good one. Still, if the two
things just happen to coincide

there's no law that says you
can't slam the knife in a little
harder and give it an extra
twist ... I know it's not good
to think that way, but then I
don't have much else to keep
me interested in life." Holy
Mother served time in Attica
and his disinterested remem
brances of the riot there which
claimed him as an accidental
victim make his dismal present
more understandable and
painful.

While the novel tends to
stay close to the rhythms and
vocabulary of language spo
ken on the street, there are
moments of unexpected, sim
ple beauty. I hear the voice of

one solitary car moaning over
the grating at the top of the
bridge, a smooth and desper
ately lonely aural curve build
ing toward a peak it never
reaches, a phrase spliced avvav
into nothingness when the car
hits the asphalt, its lights
dropping away behind me
now, the car falling into Man
hattan. Bell's casual blend of
evocative description and ab
solutely realistic detail creates
a curious double vision ot

grim reality and potential
plenitude. He captures the ab
sence and presence of urban
existence.
Like Ernest Hemingway and
Norman Mailer, Bell finds

something glorious and truth
ful in violence. The pitched
battle with which the novel
ends gives each character a
chance to be most honestly
himself. While such faith
in grace under pressure may
seem old-tashioned, Bell earns
the right to explore the con
tingencies nt dangerous situa
tion s . The r e is nothing
abstract or unfelt about the
novel's action. We teel the
truth of Johnny B.'s statement,
"It was the not caring that
made it a better tight . . . Be
cause all this hungry heart
business is a lot of crap. In the
tight it's better not to care, not
to have an interest." We come
to see that, for these charac
ters, a philosophy of violence
is a philosophy of life.
Bell's novel creates two
levels: one of action and one
of reflection. At the level of ac
tion, we are delighted and
amused by the non-stop pace
and the intertwined strands of
plot. There are crimes, arrests,
fights and confrontations
enough for several stories,
and a few moments of un
abashed humor. But again and
again we feel the essential
seriousness of the author. He
has the honesty and humanity
to invest his characters with a
significance and clarity that in
volves us quickly and deeply
in their collective plight, their
yearnings and their unlikely
friendships.

than overconfidence.
Bell creates an ensemble of
voices by allowing each of the -
five main characters to narrate
the events of the day in a
series of interspersed, won- :
dert'ully realized dramatic J
monologues. Johnny B.
Coode, the organizer of the
team, speaks to us in a street
wise, ironic voice, using
humor to maintain constant
control of himself and the
situation. At one point he wor
ries about the promiscuity of
one park regular. "And maybe
it's a big kick for her, but I
think it's a lousy reason to die,
poor Eva the Swede, I get so
tired wondering whether it
will be the Rastas who claim
her flaxen head for a soccer
ball or the Haitians who will
shrink it down to one-quarter
size to add to their voodoo
.relic collections that I have
thought of knocking her off
myself."
This sounds altogether
different from the hopeless
savagery of Holy Mother, a
professional killer turned
junky, mourning a missed op
portunity for revenge. "The
idea that you don't bring your
private trouble to work is a
good one. Still, if the two
things just happen to coincide

there's no law that says you
can't slam the knife in a little
harder and give it an extra
twist ... I know it's not good
to think that way, but then I
don't have much else to keep
me interested in life." Holy
Mother served time in Attica
and his disinterested remem
brances of the riot there which
claimed him as an accidental
victim make his dismal present
more understandable and
painful.

While the novel tends to
stay close to the rhythms and
vocabulary of language spo
ken on the street, there are
moments of unexpected, sim
ple beauty. I hear the voice of

one solitary car moaning over
the grating at the top of the
bridge, a smooth and desper
ately lonely aural curve build
ing toward a peak it never
reaches, a phrase spliced avvav
into nothingness when the car
hits the asphalt, its lights
dropping away behind me
now, the car falling into Man
hattan. Bell's casual blend of
evocative description and ab
solutely realistic detail creates
a curious double vision ot

grim reality and potential
plenitude. He captures the ab
sence and presence of urban
existence.
Like Ernest Hemingway and
Norman Mailer, Bell finds

something glorious and truth
ful in violence. The pitched
battle with which the novel
ends gives each character a
chance to be most honestly
himself. While such faith
in grace under pressure may
seem old-tashioned, Bell earns
the right to explore the con
tingencies nt dangerous situa
tion s . The r e is nothing
abstract or unfelt about the
novel's action. We teel the
truth of Johnny B.'s statement,
"It was the not caring that
made it a better tight . . . Be
cause all this hungry heart
business is a lot of crap. In the
tight it's better not to care, not
to have an interest." We come
to see that, for these charac
ters, a philosophy of violence
is a philosophy of life.
Bell's novel creates two
levels: one of action and one
of reflection. At the level of ac
tion, we are delighted and
amused by the non-stop pace
and the intertwined strands of
plot. There are crimes, arrests,
fights and confrontations
enough for several stories,
and a few moments of un
abashed humor. But again and
again we feel the essential
seriousness of the author. He
has the honesty and humanity
to invest his characters with a
significance and clarity that in
volves us quickly and deeply
in their collective plight, their
yearnings and their unlikely
friendships.
