The most appropriate re
view of jonathan Miller's
The Human Body (Viking,
$16.95) would be a pop-up
hand with the thumb raised.
Though its text is fairly
elementary, and may not be
informative to anyone who
has passed high school
biology, The Human Body
provides great entertain
ment with its pop-up mod
els of human anatomy (de
signed by David Pelham)
which can be made to move
by pulling on paper tabs. It's
an interesting case of the
amusing leading to the in
structive, without having
much connection to it. The
pop-up effects are fun, but
they don't clarify the
anatomy especially well.
Though apparently in
tended for older children,
The Human Body may best
serve as a novel coffee table
book for adults.
Roots of Detection,
edited by Bruce Cassiday
(Ungar, $12.95 cloth, $6.95
paper) names itself better
with its subtitle: The Art of
Deduction Before Sherlock
Holmes. Cassiday has as
sembled texts from
Herodotus through the 19th
century, all involving the
application of the methods
immortalized by the sleuth

of Baker Street. In his intel
ligent — and too brief — in
troduction to selections
from Voltaire, Hoffmann,
Dumas, Dickens anci
others, Cassiday points out
that deduction alone does
not make a mystery or de
tective story. One of the
most unexpected pleasures
of this collection is the way
it reveals, by their absence,
the necessary elements of
mystery fiction. The mod
ern selections are fast
paced and surprising, and
Cassiday offers a very in
teresting contrast between
Poe's classic "The Purloined
Letter" and a Wilkie Collins
story, "The Stolen Letter."
The two volumes of Agee
on Film, just reissued by
Wideview/Perigee (paper,
$7.95 each volume), repre

sent an additional two faces
of the prodigious Pulitzer
Prize-winning novelist, poet
and journalist. Volume One
contains a comprehensive
collection of his film re
views from the 1942-48
period, as consistently
thoughtful, imaginative
and impassioned as film
criticism has ever been.
Agee's style — eloquent yet
dry and often amused — has
outlived many of the trashy
pictures he squandered it
on. Agee's other contribu
tion to film was, of course,
his screenplays. In addition
to the celebrated African
Queen and The Night of the
Hunter, there are the un
filmed Noa Noa, a biog
raphy of Gauguin, and the
adaptation of Stephen
Crane's story "The Blue
Hotel."
