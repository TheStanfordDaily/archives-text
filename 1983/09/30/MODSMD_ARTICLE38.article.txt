Lacombe, Lutien (1974) ★
Cubberley High School, 4000
Middlefield Rd., Palo Alto
Louis Malle's unique drama
about a young man (the non
professional actor Pierre Blaise,
beautifully cast) during the
German Occupation of France
who, his services rejected by the
Resistance, joins the Nazis. The
theme is the banality of evil.
When the film was released,
Malle and. his co-screenwriter,
Patrick Modiano, were
criticized in some quarters for
making a movie with a cipher at
its center, and your response to
it will certainly depend on
whether you find Lucien a point
less film subject or a fascinating
one just because he is a moral
idiot. If you respond at all, the
odds are you will remember
Lacombe, Lucien for the rest of
your life. How many directors
have crossed the line from film
into philosophy? Aurore Cle
ment plays the Jewish girl Lu
cien courts, intimidating her
father(HolgerLowenadler) into
enduring his visits because the
old man knows Lucien can turn
him in to the Nazis at any mo
ment. In the film's most amaz
ing scene, the father, fed up at
last, marches into Gestapo
headquarters to have a talk with
Lucien; our recognition that
this is a suicidal action cues us in
that the old man has begun to
lose his sanity. (Lowenadler
gives a superb performance.)
Plays Wednesday evening.
Pat and Mike (1952) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
"There ain't much meat on
her, but what there is, is
cherce," Spencer Tracy says of
Katharine Hepburn in this peer
less comedy, written by Ruth
Gordon and Garson Kanin and
directed by George Cukor.
Comic teamwork doesn't get
much better than this — when
you watch these two together
here, you think that if they we
ren't lovers they ought to have
been. Hepburn plays an
UTRTete-ot-all-trades and Tracy is
her manager; the supporting
cast includes Aldo Ray, Jim Bac
kus, Chuck Connors, Charles
Bronson,and — in bits—Gussie
Moran and Babe Zaharias.
Plays through Wednesday
with Arsenic and Old Lace.

Return of the Secaucus Seven
(1980) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Sayles, relying mostly on
funds he earned by writing
screenplays for Roger Corman,
made this picture (which he
wrote, produced, directed,
edited and plays a supporting
role in) for $60,000 and it looks
like a home movie — but it is
wonderful. The characters are a
group of friends who experi
enced the '60s together and
now, at 30 or thereabouts, are
confronting crises. Sayles
writes crinkly, soft-edge, funny
lines that catch notonly theturn
of phrase of individuals but their
speech rhythms as well as the
tensions that direct these
rhythms. The cast is made up
largely of Sayles' friends, sev
eral of whom were his
classmates at Williams College;
as actors they are a highly vari
able lot, but they communicate
such a strong bond that we see
more in the ways in which they
relate to each other than we
might see in a highly trained en
semble. The best of them are
Mike Arnott, Jean Passanante,
Gordon Clapp, Maggie Renzi
and Sayles himself.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Baby, It's You.
The Birds (1963)
Kresge Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock made this
movie out of a novel by Daphne
du Maurier; it was his first pic
ture after Psycho, and it may be
the first apocalyptic horror tale
to be made in Hollywood. In
Bodega Bay, birds gather by the
hundreds and terrify the in
habitants. There are some very
creepy shots of birds hovering
on telephone wires and roof
tops, and an effectively edited
sequence in which Tippi Hed
ren is assaulted by the creatures
in an attic, but the movie is
otherwisesloppyand rathervio
lent, and it contains bits that are
hard for an audience to accept
— for instance, the moment
when she emerges from that at
tic, sporting merely a few
scratches. Rod Taylor and
Suzanne Pleshette co-star; the
one memorable appearance is
by Ethel Criffies as an or
nithologist.
Plays tonight.

Fanny and Alexander ★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingmar Bergman's rich, en
grossing movie, set in a Swedish
town in the 1910s, is named for
the two youngest members of a
theatrical family. It is impossible
to avoid seeing Bergman him
self, who planned this as his last

film, in the perceptive, bright
eyed, tough-minded Alexander
(Bertil Guve), who is a poet
dreamer, a theatrical artist in the
making. Dickens and Hans
Christian Andersen had a hand
in the deeply satisfying tradi
tional structure, and the ghosts
of Strindberg, Shakespeare,
Chekhov and Feydeau make an
appearance, too. Though the
second half of this lengthy
(three-and-a-half-hour) picture
is not as firmly controlled as the
first, and as Bergman moves
through each of his celebrated
preoccupations, they seem not
only terribly familiar but terribly
perfunctory, still one is grateful
for its sensuousness, for the
eloquent staging, for Sven Nyk
vist's photography, and for
many of the performances —
particularly those of Gunn
Wallgrenand Pernilla Wallgren.

Eating Raoul (1982)
Cubberley Auditorium
Paul Bartel and Mary
Woronov play Paul and Mary
Bland, a young couple who at
tract "swingers" by means of
ads in porno magazines and
then kill them for their money.
This dirty variation on that
warhorse Arsenic and Old Lace
is considerably funnier than the
original, but it goes on a trifle
too long and after a while the de
liberately tacky look of the pic
ture makes the viewer feel
cheap, too. Directed by Bartel,
from a script he wrote with
Richard Blackburn. As an actor,
he conveys an amusing persona
— an odd combination of theef
feminate and the avuncular —
and there are some talented
comedians in bit parts (Susan
Saiger, Ed Begley, Jr., Dan Bar
rows, Allan Rich).
Plays tonight.

Zelig ★
Palo Alto Square
Woody Allen made this
charming movie about a man
whose fear of being ostracized
permits him to change his fea
tures at will to conform to the
peoplearound him. It's a certifi
able anomaly: Zelig's tale is told
through the combination of de
ftly doctored footage from the
'20s and early '30s, present-day
interviews, analytical state
ments delivered by contempor
ary social observers, and "his
torical" scenes between Zelig
(Allen) and his psychiatrist
lover (Mia Farrow). And the tone
is a weird hybrid of sage and
lunatic, like the best of Allen's
short stories. Zelig lacks the
breadth of great comedy, but
for what it is, it's just about per
fect.
48 Hours (1982)
Memorial Auditorium
Vou can sense Walter Hill's
delight at directing Eddie Mur
phy in this cop thriller-comedy.
He gives him one of the funniest
introductions any actor's ever
had in a movie debut, as well as
all the major routines and all the
best lines. And no one can com
plain about the results. Murphy
knows the trick of staying sharp
and relaxed at the same time,
and his gears are buried so deep
inside him that he can shift them
with no visible clue, always
catching us by surprise. 48
Hours wouldn't be a very in
teresting movie without Mur
phy, although Hill gives it the
benefit of his considerable skill
as an action director, and Mur
phy and Nick Nolte, as the cop
who presses him into service
(Murphy is a con sprung from
jail to help the police catch a
murderer), have a winning rap
port. But the script is unusually
banal,and reallythefilmmarksa
sentimental journey for Hill
back to the days when he wrote
such moviesasSamPeckinpah's
The Getaway.
Plays Sunday evening.

American Gigolo (1980)
Kresge Auditorium
Paul Schrader is drawn to
sleazy film subjects, but he is a
pristine, sanctimonious
filmmaker: nobody ever has fun
in his movies, no matter how
drenched in sin, and since we
have to listen to his characters
sound off with the humorless
pedanticism of Calvinist minis
ters, they're no fun to watch,
either. The gigolo hero of this
film, played by Richard Gere
(acting as if every moment were
a physical and spiritual strain),
may strike you as utterly self
serving, narcissistic and
materialistic, but Schrader sees
him as noble. It may be that
Schrader's championing of the
handsome protagonist stems
from his own aesthetic appreci
ation of attractive objects; visu
ally, this film (beautifully shot by
John Bailey in subdued, sunlit
desert tones) is obsessed with
surfaces — wardrobe, cars, an
tiques. Schrader also seems
confused about the gigolo's
sexuality: Cere minces and
wiggles in a self-conscious way
that is suggestive of gay prosti
tutes in other movies, and at one
point Schrader shoots him
nude, posed coyly at a window
like a Btueboy model. With
LaurenHuttonandNinaVanPal
landt.
Plays tomorrow evening.
M (1931) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Lorre was a distin
guished German stage actor
when he made this early sound
film for Fritz Lang. (The same
year, he starred in the original
production of Odon von Hor
vath's Tales from the Vienna
Woods.) He is so extraordinary
here that one wants to cry out
against the injustices perpet
rated against him in Hollywood,
where he was typed as a horror
movie creep. He manages to
make the wild child murderer
hero of M simultaneously sym
pathetic and repellent (as Bruce
Davison would do in his por
trayal of the child molester in
Short Eyes 46 years later). M, a
classic of the German Expres
sionist school, is often thought
of as Lang'sfinestachievement.

Lacombe, Lutien (1974) ★
Cubberley High School, 4000
Middlefield Rd., Palo Alto
Louis Malle's unique drama
about a young man (the non
professional actor Pierre Blaise,
beautifully cast) during the
German Occupation of France
who, his services rejected by the
Resistance, joins the Nazis. The
theme is the banality of evil.
When the film was released,
Malle and. his co-screenwriter,
Patrick Modiano, were
criticized in some quarters for
making a movie with a cipher at
its center, and your response to
it will certainly depend on
whether you find Lucien a point
less film subject or a fascinating
one just because he is a moral
idiot. If you respond at all, the
odds are you will remember
Lacombe, Lucien for the rest of
your life. How many directors
have crossed the line from film
into philosophy? Aurore Cle
ment plays the Jewish girl Lu
cien courts, intimidating her
father(HolgerLowenadler) into
enduring his visits because the
old man knows Lucien can turn
him in to the Nazis at any mo
ment. In the film's most amaz
ing scene, the father, fed up at
last, marches into Gestapo
headquarters to have a talk with
Lucien; our recognition that
this is a suicidal action cues us in
that the old man has begun to
lose his sanity. (Lowenadler
gives a superb performance.)
Plays Wednesday evening.
Pat and Mike (1952) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
"There ain't much meat on
her, but what there is, is
cherce," Spencer Tracy says of
Katharine Hepburn in this peer
less comedy, written by Ruth
Gordon and Garson Kanin and
directed by George Cukor.
Comic teamwork doesn't get
much better than this — when
you watch these two together
here, you think that if they we
ren't lovers they ought to have
been. Hepburn plays an
UTRTete-ot-all-trades and Tracy is
her manager; the supporting
cast includes Aldo Ray, Jim Bac
kus, Chuck Connors, Charles
Bronson,and — in bits—Gussie
Moran and Babe Zaharias.
Plays through Wednesday
with Arsenic and Old Lace.

Return of the Secaucus Seven
(1980) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Sayles, relying mostly on
funds he earned by writing
screenplays for Roger Corman,
made this picture (which he
wrote, produced, directed,
edited and plays a supporting
role in) for $60,000 and it looks
like a home movie — but it is
wonderful. The characters are a
group of friends who experi
enced the '60s together and
now, at 30 or thereabouts, are
confronting crises. Sayles
writes crinkly, soft-edge, funny
lines that catch notonly theturn
of phrase of individuals but their
speech rhythms as well as the
tensions that direct these
rhythms. The cast is made up
largely of Sayles' friends, sev
eral of whom were his
classmates at Williams College;
as actors they are a highly vari
able lot, but they communicate
such a strong bond that we see
more in the ways in which they
relate to each other than we
might see in a highly trained en
semble. The best of them are
Mike Arnott, Jean Passanante,
Gordon Clapp, Maggie Renzi
and Sayles himself.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Baby, It's You.
The Birds (1963)
Kresge Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock made this
movie out of a novel by Daphne
du Maurier; it was his first pic
ture after Psycho, and it may be
the first apocalyptic horror tale
to be made in Hollywood. In
Bodega Bay, birds gather by the
hundreds and terrify the in
habitants. There are some very
creepy shots of birds hovering
on telephone wires and roof
tops, and an effectively edited
sequence in which Tippi Hed
ren is assaulted by the creatures
in an attic, but the movie is
otherwisesloppyand rathervio
lent, and it contains bits that are
hard for an audience to accept
— for instance, the moment
when she emerges from that at
tic, sporting merely a few
scratches. Rod Taylor and
Suzanne Pleshette co-star; the
one memorable appearance is
by Ethel Criffies as an or
nithologist.
Plays tonight.

Fanny and Alexander ★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingmar Bergman's rich, en
grossing movie, set in a Swedish
town in the 1910s, is named for
the two youngest members of a
theatrical family. It is impossible
to avoid seeing Bergman him
self, who planned this as his last

film, in the perceptive, bright
eyed, tough-minded Alexander
(Bertil Guve), who is a poet
dreamer, a theatrical artist in the
making. Dickens and Hans
Christian Andersen had a hand
in the deeply satisfying tradi
tional structure, and the ghosts
of Strindberg, Shakespeare,
Chekhov and Feydeau make an
appearance, too. Though the
second half of this lengthy
(three-and-a-half-hour) picture
is not as firmly controlled as the
first, and as Bergman moves
through each of his celebrated
preoccupations, they seem not
only terribly familiar but terribly
perfunctory, still one is grateful
for its sensuousness, for the
eloquent staging, for Sven Nyk
vist's photography, and for
many of the performances —
particularly those of Gunn
Wallgrenand Pernilla Wallgren.

Eating Raoul (1982)
Cubberley Auditorium
Paul Bartel and Mary
Woronov play Paul and Mary
Bland, a young couple who at
tract "swingers" by means of
ads in porno magazines and
then kill them for their money.
This dirty variation on that
warhorse Arsenic and Old Lace
is considerably funnier than the
original, but it goes on a trifle
too long and after a while the de
liberately tacky look of the pic
ture makes the viewer feel
cheap, too. Directed by Bartel,
from a script he wrote with
Richard Blackburn. As an actor,
he conveys an amusing persona
— an odd combination of theef
feminate and the avuncular —
and there are some talented
comedians in bit parts (Susan
Saiger, Ed Begley, Jr., Dan Bar
rows, Allan Rich).
Plays tonight.

Zelig ★
Palo Alto Square
Woody Allen made this
charming movie about a man
whose fear of being ostracized
permits him to change his fea
tures at will to conform to the
peoplearound him. It's a certifi
able anomaly: Zelig's tale is told
through the combination of de
ftly doctored footage from the
'20s and early '30s, present-day
interviews, analytical state
ments delivered by contempor
ary social observers, and "his
torical" scenes between Zelig
(Allen) and his psychiatrist
lover (Mia Farrow). And the tone
is a weird hybrid of sage and
lunatic, like the best of Allen's
short stories. Zelig lacks the
breadth of great comedy, but
for what it is, it's just about per
fect.
48 Hours (1982)
Memorial Auditorium
Vou can sense Walter Hill's
delight at directing Eddie Mur
phy in this cop thriller-comedy.
He gives him one of the funniest
introductions any actor's ever
had in a movie debut, as well as
all the major routines and all the
best lines. And no one can com
plain about the results. Murphy
knows the trick of staying sharp
and relaxed at the same time,
and his gears are buried so deep
inside him that he can shift them
with no visible clue, always
catching us by surprise. 48
Hours wouldn't be a very in
teresting movie without Mur
phy, although Hill gives it the
benefit of his considerable skill
as an action director, and Mur
phy and Nick Nolte, as the cop
who presses him into service
(Murphy is a con sprung from
jail to help the police catch a
murderer), have a winning rap
port. But the script is unusually
banal,and reallythefilmmarksa

American Gigolo (1980)
Kresge Auditorium
Paul Schrader is drawn to
sleazy film subjects, but he is a
pristine, sanctimonious
filmmaker: nobody ever has fun
in his movies, no matter how
drenched in sin, and since we
have to listen to his characters
sound off with the humorless
pedanticism of Calvinist minis
ters, they're no fun to watch,
either. The gigolo hero of this
film, played by Richard Gere
(acting as if every moment were
a physical and spiritual strain),
may strike you as utterly self
serving, narcissistic and
materialistic, but Schrader sees
him as noble. It may be that
Schrader's championing of the
handsome protagonist stems
from his own aesthetic appreci
ation of attractive objects; visu
ally, this film (beautifully shot by
John Bailey in subdued, sunlit
desert tones) is obsessed with
surfaces — wardrobe, cars, an
tiques. Schrader also seems
confused about the gigolo's
sexuality: Cere minces and
wiggles in a self-conscious way
that is suggestive of gay prosti
tutes in other movies, and at one
point Schrader shoots him
nude, posed coyly at a window
like a Btueboy model. With
LaurenHuttonandNinaVanPal
landt.
Plays tomorrow evening.
M (1931) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Lorre was a distin
guished German stage actor
when he made this early sound
film for Fritz Lang. (The same
year, he starred in the original
production of Odon von Hor
vath's Tales from the Vienna
Woods.) He is so extraordinary
here that one wants to cry out
against the injustices perpet
rated against him in Hollywood,
where he was typed as a horror
movie creep. He manages to
make the wild child murderer
hero of M simultaneously sym
pathetic and repellent (as Bruce
Davison would do in his por
trayal of the child molester in
Short Eyes 46 years later). M, a
classic of the German Expres
sionist school, is often thought
of as Lang'sfinestachievement.

Lacombe, Lutien (1974) ★
Cubberley High School, 4000
Middlefield Rd., Palo Alto
Louis Malle's unique drama
about a young man (the non
professional actor Pierre Blaise,
beautifully cast) during the
German Occupation of France
who, his services rejected by the
Resistance, joins the Nazis. The
theme is the banality of evil.
When the film was released,
Malle and. his co-screenwriter,
Patrick Modiano, were
criticized in some quarters for
making a movie with a cipher at
its center, and your response to
it will certainly depend on
whether you find Lucien a point
less film subject or a fascinating
one just because he is a moral
idiot. If you respond at all, the
odds are you will remember
Lacombe, Lucien for the rest of
your life. How many directors
have crossed the line from film
into philosophy? Aurore Cle
ment plays the Jewish girl Lu
cien courts, intimidating her
father(HolgerLowenadler) into
enduring his visits because the
old man knows Lucien can turn
him in to the Nazis at any mo
ment. In the film's most amaz
ing scene, the father, fed up at
last, marches into Gestapo
headquarters to have a talk with
Lucien; our recognition that
this is a suicidal action cues us in
that the old man has begun to
lose his sanity. (Lowenadler
gives a superb performance.)
Plays Wednesday evening.
Pat and Mike (1952) ★
Festival, Palo Alto
"There ain't much meat on
her, but what there is, is
cherce," Spencer Tracy says of
Katharine Hepburn in this peer
less comedy, written by Ruth
Gordon and Garson Kanin and
directed by George Cukor.
Comic teamwork doesn't get
much better than this — when
you watch these two together
here, you think that if they we
ren't lovers they ought to have
been. Hepburn plays an
UTRTete-ot-all-trades and Tracy is
her manager; the supporting
cast includes Aldo Ray, Jim Bac
kus, Chuck Connors, Charles
Bronson,and — in bits—Gussie
Moran and Babe Zaharias.
Plays through Wednesday
with Arsenic and Old Lace.

Return of the Secaucus Seven
(1980) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Sayles, relying mostly on
funds he earned by writing
screenplays for Roger Corman,
made this picture (which he
wrote, produced, directed,
edited and plays a supporting
role in) for $60,000 and it looks
like a home movie — but it is
wonderful. The characters are a
group of friends who experi
enced the '60s together and
now, at 30 or thereabouts, are
confronting crises. Sayles
writes crinkly, soft-edge, funny
lines that catch notonly theturn
of phrase of individuals but their
speech rhythms as well as the
tensions that direct these
rhythms. The cast is made up
largely of Sayles' friends, sev
eral of whom were his
classmates at Williams College;
as actors they are a highly vari
able lot, but they communicate
such a strong bond that we see
more in the ways in which they
relate to each other than we
might see in a highly trained en
semble. The best of them are
Mike Arnott, Jean Passanante,
Gordon Clapp, Maggie Renzi
and Sayles himself.
Plays Tuesday and Wednes
day with Baby, It's You.
The Birds (1963)
Kresge Auditorium
Alfred Hitchcock made this
movie out of a novel by Daphne
du Maurier; it was his first pic
ture after Psycho, and it may be
the first apocalyptic horror tale
to be made in Hollywood. In
Bodega Bay, birds gather by the
hundreds and terrify the in
habitants. There are some very
creepy shots of birds hovering
on telephone wires and roof
tops, and an effectively edited
sequence in which Tippi Hed
ren is assaulted by the creatures
in an attic, but the movie is
otherwisesloppyand rathervio
lent, and it contains bits that are
hard for an audience to accept
— for instance, the moment
when she emerges from that at
tic, sporting merely a few
scratches. Rod Taylor and
Suzanne Pleshette co-star; the
one memorable appearance is
by Ethel Criffies as an or
nithologist.
Plays tonight.

Fanny and Alexander ★
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Ingmar Bergman's rich, en
grossing movie, set in a Swedish
town in the 1910s, is named for
the two youngest members of a
theatrical family. It is impossible
to avoid seeing Bergman him
self, who planned this as his last

film, in the perceptive, bright
eyed, tough-minded Alexander
(Bertil Guve), who is a poet
dreamer, a theatrical artist in the
making. Dickens and Hans
Christian Andersen had a hand
in the deeply satisfying tradi
tional structure, and the ghosts
of Strindberg, Shakespeare,
Chekhov and Feydeau make an
appearance, too. Though the
second half of this lengthy
(three-and-a-half-hour) picture
is not as firmly controlled as the
first, and as Bergman moves
through each of his celebrated
preoccupations, they seem not
only terribly familiar but terribly
perfunctory, still one is grateful
for its sensuousness, for the
eloquent staging, for Sven Nyk
vist's photography, and for
many of the performances —
particularly those of Gunn
Wallgrenand Pernilla Wallgren.

Eating Raoul (1982)
Cubberley Auditorium
Paul Bartel and Mary
Woronov play Paul and Mary
Bland, a young couple who at
tract "swingers" by means of
ads in porno magazines and
then kill them for their money.
This dirty variation on that
warhorse Arsenic and Old Lace
is considerably funnier than the
original, but it goes on a trifle
too long and after a while the de
liberately tacky look of the pic
ture makes the viewer feel
cheap, too. Directed by Bartel,
from a script he wrote with
Richard Blackburn. As an actor,
he conveys an amusing persona
— an odd combination of theef
feminate and the avuncular —
and there are some talented
comedians in bit parts (Susan
Saiger, Ed Begley, Jr., Dan Bar
rows, Allan Rich).
Plays tonight.

Zelig ★
Palo Alto Square
Woody Allen made this
charming movie about a man
whose fear of being ostracized
permits him to change his fea
tures at will to conform to the
peoplearound him. It's a certifi
able anomaly: Zelig's tale is told
through the combination of de
ftly doctored footage from the
'20s and early '30s, present-day
interviews, analytical state
ments delivered by contempor
ary social observers, and "his
torical" scenes between Zelig
(Allen) and his psychiatrist
lover (Mia Farrow). And the tone
is a weird hybrid of sage and
lunatic, like the best of Allen's
short stories. Zelig lacks the
breadth of great comedy, but
for what it is, it's just about per
fect.
48 Hours (1982)
Memorial Auditorium
Vou can sense Walter Hill's
delight at directing Eddie Mur
phy in this cop thriller-comedy.
He gives him one of the funniest
introductions any actor's ever
had in a movie debut, as well as
all the major routines and all the
best lines. And no one can com
plain about the results. Murphy
knows the trick of staying sharp
and relaxed at the same time,
and his gears are buried so deep
inside him that he can shift them
with no visible clue, always
catching us by surprise. 48
Hours wouldn't be a very in
teresting movie without Mur
phy, although Hill gives it the
benefit of his considerable skill
as an action director, and Mur
phy and Nick Nolte, as the cop
who presses him into service
(Murphy is a con sprung from
jail to help the police catch a
murderer), have a winning rap
port. But the script is unusually
banal,and reallythefilmmarksa
sentimental journey for Hill
back to the days when he wrote
such moviesasSamPeckinpah's
The Getaway.
Plays Sunday evening.

American Gigolo (1980)
Kresge Auditorium
Paul Schrader is drawn to
sleazy film subjects, but he is a
pristine, sanctimonious
filmmaker: nobody ever has fun
in his movies, no matter how
drenched in sin, and since we
have to listen to his characters
sound off with the humorless
pedanticism of Calvinist minis
ters, they're no fun to watch,
either. The gigolo hero of this
film, played by Richard Gere
(acting as if every moment were
a physical and spiritual strain),
may strike you as utterly self
serving, narcissistic and
materialistic, but Schrader sees
him as noble. It may be that
Schrader's championing of the
handsome protagonist stems
from his own aesthetic appreci
ation of attractive objects; visu
ally, this film (beautifully shot by
John Bailey in subdued, sunlit
desert tones) is obsessed with
surfaces — wardrobe, cars, an
tiques. Schrader also seems
confused about the gigolo's
sexuality: Cere minces and
wiggles in a self-conscious way
that is suggestive of gay prosti
tutes in other movies, and at one
point Schrader shoots him
nude, posed coyly at a window
like a Btueboy model. With
LaurenHuttonandNinaVanPal
landt.
Plays tomorrow evening.
M (1931) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Lorre was a distin
guished German stage actor
when he made this early sound
film for Fritz Lang. (The same
year, he starred in the original
production of Odon von Hor
vath's Tales from the Vienna
Woods.) He is so extraordinary
here that one wants to cry out
against the injustices perpet
rated against him in Hollywood,
where he was typed as a horror
movie creep. He manages to
make the wild child murderer
hero of M simultaneously sym
pathetic and repellent (as Bruce
Davison would do in his por
trayal of the child molester in
Short Eyes 46 years later). M, a
classic of the German Expres
sionist school, is often thought
of as Lang'sfinestachievement.
Plays Monday with Met
