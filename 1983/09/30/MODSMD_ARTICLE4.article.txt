# Insanity is surprisingly rare plea

### BOBAN MATHEW 
The insanity defense is not unduly
used by criminals, according to Law
and Psychology Prof. David
Rosenhan, who recently completed a
25-month study of insanity pleas en
tered in Santa Clara County.
Rosenhan said most people mis
takenly believe the "not guilty by
reason of insanity" plea is widely
used and often successful.
"The insanity defense is not a
major legal loophole," Rosenhan
said.
Rosenhan and his research team
analyzed all the insanity pleas en
tered in Santa Clara County during a
25-month period. Of the 6635 ar
raigned criminal offenses during this
time, only 39 insanity pleas were en
tered.
Out of the 39 cases, only 16 were
successful. Of all the arraigned crim
inal defendants, a mere 24 percent
were found not guilty by reason of
insanity.
Rosenhan said these figures ari:
consistent with those found in simi
lar studies.
Rosenhan also said whenever the
insanity plea does succeed, it proba
bly deserves to win because the ex
perts do concur in their opinions in
most of these cases. In 33 of 39 Santa
Clara cases studied, there was no
disagreement.
Experts did disagree, however, in
two of the 16 successful cases. But
according to Rosenhan, disagree
ment arises only because the law
demands a definite answer.
"The assessment of whether a per
son was able to control his behavior,
or able to understand and appreciate
the criminality of his behavior is,
among thoughtful people, a matter
of degree, not kind," Rosenhan said
in his presidential address to the Di
vision of Psychology and Law of the
American Psychological Association
last month.
Another common misconception
surrounding insanity pleas is the be
lief that the plea is used exclusively in
murder cases, said Linda Cheng,
Rosenhan's research assistant.
"The insanity plea is not used
merely in murder cases but also in
such criminal cases as robbery and
arson," she said.
Cheng added that only one of the
16 successful cases involved
homicide.
Rosenhan said that the media plays
a major role in exaggerating the use
of the insanity plea.
