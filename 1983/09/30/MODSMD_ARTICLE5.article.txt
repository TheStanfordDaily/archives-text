Congress invokes War Powers Act
Washington — Congress passed and sent to Presi
dent Reagan last night historic legislation invoking
the War Powers Act for the first time and authorizing
U.S. Marines to remain in Lebanon for as long as 18
more months.
The Democratic-run house gave routine tinal ap
proval on a vote of 253-156 after the Republican
controlled Senate, acting in a highly charged partisan
atmosphere, voted 54-48 to embrace the !8-month
plan. The legislation, a compromise negotiated by
Reagan and key congressional leaders, initially
passed the house Wednesday by an overwhelming,
bipartisan vote of 270-161.

In a statement, Reagan called the congressional
action a great victory for an honorable and all
important American tradition — a responsible bipar
tisan foreign policy ... By working together to pro
mote peace in Lebanon, to give Lebanon back to the
Lebanese people and to help them rebuild their de
mocracy, we are strengthening the forces for peace
throughout the Middle East."
The Senate, overriding protests that Lebanon was
becoming another Vietnam, rejected Democratic at
tempts to shave the 18-month deployment period
down to as little as two months and to force the
president to spell out the Marine's mission in greater
The Senate vote, with only three Republicans and
two Democrats bolting party ranks, was even closer
than the eight-vote margin suggested. As the roll call
wound down, a grim-faced Senate Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), got into a heated, finger
pointing discussion on the Senate floor with Sen.
Daniel Quayle (R-lnd.). It was disclosed later that
Baker had made strong partisan arguments to per
suade both Quayle and Sen. Mark Andrews (R-N.D.)
to vote for the 18-month plan.
"It was very iffy," Baker's press secretary, Tom
Griscom, said. "If we had lost Quayle and Andrews, it
was highly likely that some (Republican) votes would
have switched back to the other side. We also
thought we might get a half dozen Democratic votes
and we only go two."
Quayle, still agitated after the vote, said he op
posed Reagan's Lebanon policy but grudgingly sup
ported the 18-month plan "because it became a parti
san vote . . . When you get pushed into a partisan
corner, I have strong tendencies to support my presi
dent."
Griscom said Reagan made several 11th-hour
phone calls to shore up votes. Backstopping him,
Vice-President George Bush was on hand to but
tonhole wavering senators and to preside over the
Senate in case he was needed to break a tie.
The three Republicans nays were cast by Sens.
Mark Hatfield of Oregon, William Roth of Dela
ware and Lowell Weicker of Connecticut. The two
Democrats breaking ranks were Sens. George Mitch
ell of Maine and Edward Zorinsky of Nebraska.
"In Lebanon and the Middle East, our failure to
pass this would have been construed as a vote to pull
the marines out," Mitchell said in an interview. "It
would have undermined any effort at extending the
cease-fire in Lebanon and at encouraging a national
unity dialogue that hopefully will commence soon.'
Most Senate Democrats assailed the 18-month plan
as, in the words of Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.j, "A
blank check to the President to do whatever he wants
to do militarily in Lebanon."
The compromise was developed after two marines,
part of a multinational peacekeeping force in Leba
non, were killed Aug. 29 in shelling by Druze militia in
the Beirut area.
Thatcher shows unity with Reagan
Washington — British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher displayed steadfast solidarity with President
Reagan on East-West arms issues following a two
hour meeting here yesterday, declaring that "our
nerve is being tested, we must not falter now."
Thatcher called Soviet Leader Yuri Andropov's re
sponse to Reagan's latest arms control offers "disap
pointing and discouraging" and said the deployment
of new U.S. missiles in Britain and continental Europe
will proceed if agreement is reached in the
Euro missiles negotiations in Geneva by the end of the
year.
At the same time, the British leader refused to ac
cept Andropov's public statement Wednesday as the
last word, saying that the negotiations should con
tinue in an effort to stave off the planned deploy
ments or to minimize the extent of them if the de
ployments begin.
Reagan said the "cordial and productive" talks with
Thatcher reflected "the superb relations that exist
between our two countries."
Thatcher's whirlwind day, including separate meet
ings with Treasury Secretary Donald Regan and Fed
eral Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker as well as
the long and largely private talk with Reagan, pro
duced what she called "an overwhelming prepon
derance of agreement" on most issues.

Nonetheless, she told a news conference at the
end of her meetings that she had been "not assured
at all" by the reaction to her plea that the U.s
budgetary deficit must be brought down on a high
priority basis because it is keeping interest rates un
acceptably high and retarding economic recovery
throughout the world.
And remarks about the mission and duration of the
multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon, which
includes British troops as well as U.S. Marines,
suggested that Thatcher is less willing than the Re
agan administration to contemplate a long-lasting
military involvement there.
"I'm not prepared to make indefinite commit
ments," Thatcher said. "I believe our role is a re
stricted one yvhich should not include remaining in
Lebanon until all foreign forcesareout, shesaid. "We
may have a very long stay' it that is the objective, she
added.
Secretary of State George Shultz and other U.S.
officials at times have implied that the peacekeeping
troops may be needed until Israeli, Syrian and Pales
tine Liberation Organization troops are removed
from a stabilized Lebanon. Thatcher's comment
seemed to reject any such idea.
USSR praises Lebanon cease-fire
Moscow — The Soviet Union has praised the
cease-fire in Lebanon in an apparent sign of satisfac
tion at the diplomatic and territorial gains registered
by Syria and the Druze in the long-running civil war.
The important role played by Syria in negotiating
the cease-fire agreement has been cited by Soviet
officials as one factor in explaining the Kremlin's un
usually positive reaction. Syria is Moscow's principal
ally in the Middle East and a major recipient of Soviet
weaponry.
Other elements in the Soviet attitude include a
yvish to avoid unpredictable conflicts in a sensitive
region close to its borders and satisfaction at what
appears to be a change in the internal balance of
power in Lebanon. Western diplomats have noted
that the Soviet press has again started mentioning the
name of Lebanese President Amin Gemayel over the
past few days after a period of ignoring him and his
government.
Against these favorable developments from Mos
coyv's point of view must be set the continuing pre
sence of U.S. combat troops in Lebanon, which is
perceived here as a threat. One of the main aims of
Soviet policy has been to avoid the construction of
permanent American military bases in the Middle
East.
Despite the involvement of the Syrians in the
cease-fire talks, there is still no evidence that the
Kremlin isany closerto its long-term goal ofwinninga
place for itself at the negotiating table. Soviet
spokesman have made plain their belief that there
can be no lasting peace settlement in the Middle East
without their participation.
The United States remains opposed to Soviet in
volvement in peace negotiations on the grounds that
the Kremlin has not shown that it is prepared to take a
"constructive attitude."
The first sign of an adjustment in the Soviet posi
tion on Lebanon came in a speech Tuesday by Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in which he de
scribed the cease-fire as having "positive signifi
cance." Wednesday Soviet Leader Yuri Andropov
also welcomed the cease-fire during a meeting with
South Yemeni President Ali Nasser Mohammed Ma
sani and said he hoped it would lead to "a complete
all-round settlement on the basis of national accord."
Official Soviet statements have gone on to demand
the withdrawal from Lebanon of both Israeli occupa
tion troops and the U.S.-backed multinational force.
They also have accused the U.S. Marine members of
that force of "direct armed intervention" and de

pit ted the United States as acting hand-in-glove with
Israel in the Middle East.
Philippine soldiers raid newspaper
Manila, Philippines — Soldiers raided and shut down
vesterdas the offices of a weekly newspaper that had
repeatedly attacked President Ferdinand Marcos and
openly suggested that his government was behind
the August assassination of opposition leader Be
nigno Aquino.
Armed with a search warrant that charged the tab
loid Philippine Times with "inciting to sedition,"
government agents also padlocked a separate facility
where the sensationalist newspaper is printed.
The operator of the printing plant was reported to
have been taken to a military camp for questioning,
but the editor and publisher of the newspaper,
Rommel Corro, reportedlv had been tipped off to the
raid in advance nnd was in hiding.
The Philippine Times is one ot a handful of small,
anti-establishment publications that the government
was allowed to circulate. The large daily newspapers
in Manila are all owned by friends or relatives of the
Marcos family and rarely print news critical of the
regime.
Government domination of the major news media,
including television, has become an important issue
here in the aftermath of the Aquino killing. Critics of
the regime have organized a boycott of major news
papers and television stations, saying that they dis
torted coverage of the Aquino murder and its after
math in order to please Marcos.
The establishment publications insist that the
boycott has not affected their circulation, but news
boys and street vendors say the newspapers now are
difficult to sell. At the same time, a few periodicals
that in the past had dared to take swipes at the gov
ernmentgreweven bolderand circulation is reported
to have risen sharply. One publisher said his circula
tion is up more than six-fold since the Aquino killing.
Yesterday's closure of the Philippine Times was not
unprecedented. When he declared martial law in
1972, Marcos shut down all of Manila's newspapers,
which are free-wheeling and frequently irresponsi
ble. Many eventually reopened, but in a more docile
state.
Last December, the government shut down the
respected Forum newspaper after it printed a series
of articles that questioned whether Marcos deserved
the medals he had won in World War 11. Publisher
lose Burgos and nine other staff members were jailed
on sedition charges for 10 days and sued. Their trial is
still going on. Meanwhile, Burgos is putting out
another, equally critical publication called Malaya,
which means "freedom'' in the Tagalog language.
More U.S.-China cooperation fore
seen
Shanghai, China — A U.S.-China agreement for
President Reagan to visit Peking next year after a visit
to Washington by Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang has
set the stage for broader military cooperation be
tween the two nations, a senior Pentagon official said
yesterday.
However, the official, who briefed reporters
aboard Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger's
plane on the condition that he not be identified,
refused to describe the scope or nature of such
cooperation, other than to say that it will involve arms
sales to China and possibly "complementary action"
if both nations were challenged by a common threat.
But in general, he said agreement on the visits
"has sent an important signal to all the bureaucracies
and everybody all the way down" that military coop
eration is a high priority of both governments.
One outcome of the agreemeni was a last-minute

approval by China of an American proposal to resume
"in principle" the exchange ot military delegations
that lapsed a year ago as Sino-American relations
deteriorated over the issue of U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan.
Weinberger announced the agreement on military
exchanges here yesterday at a banquet given by a
naval unit ot the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
U.S. defense officials said that the agreement's de
tails will be worked out in the months ahead. But they
indicated that unlike the previous exchanges, in
which the two sides discussed information on mili
tary medicine, tactical warfare in general, military
communications and training, the new exchanges
will include briefings on American tactics and
weaponry. These sessions will be designed to help
modernize China's armed forces with equipment
purchased from the United States, the officials said.
During Weinberger's four days of talks in Peking,
he offered to sell China improved Hawk surface-to
air missiles and anti-tank rockets, and discussed the
sale of radar, electronic warfare equipment and other
high-technology weaponry, the senior official said.
But China did not immediately accept these offers.
"It's not a matter ot having a violent disagreement
or anything," the official said, indicating that China is
"very vague" about what weapons systems it needs,
wants to buy and can afford.
"That is why the military-to-military exchanges will
be so important," the official said. "We need to do a
lot more back and forth."
He said that Weinberger's talks in Peking had set up
a framework for further cooperation. "Things will
start moving now," the official said. "There will be
agreement on sales."
It is "the threat from the north (the Soviet Union)"
that is moving China toward greater military coopera
tion with the United States, Weinberger said earlier
this week.
