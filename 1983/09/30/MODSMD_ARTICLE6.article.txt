# Animal experiment protest planned for game tomorrow
## 
### TED LEMPERT 
Animal rights groups are planning to protest Stan
ford's use of Arizona pound animals in research here
during the Arizona/Stanford football game tomorrow.
Stanford has always been looked to as a great institu
tion of higher learning, but the University is going to
have an image problem with this," said Muriel Marlow,
head of the Western Animal Rights Network (WARN)
c hapter of Arizona's Maricopa County and organizer of
tomorrow night's rally. "I am personally disgusted with
Stanford."
Marlow said she expects between 75 and 100 people at
tomorrow night's rally, and that pickets should be ex
pected "every place where Stanford plays football and

basketball" in Arizona.
Stanford's Director of Government Relations Larry
Horton said he does not expect tomorrow night's rally to
be significant, but he does acknowledge that the animal
rights groups have become a force to be reckoned with.
"The biomedical community hasn't taken seriously
the irresponsible claims of those who have attacked
research," Horton said. "The animal groups have great
energy and are very effective, and now there is an awa
kening that a job of educating the public has to be
done."
The focal point of the controversy is Stanford's Medi
cal Center, where pound animals, shipped mostly from
out of state due to opposition from
California communities, are used in a
variety of experiments, ranging from
heart disease resarch to artificial limb
development and testing.
Marlow said that stray dogs and
cats are being sent by the pound to
Stanford, where they are subjected
to "archaic" treatment.
Once at labs such as Stanford's,
Marlow said, the animals are used in
research involving high radiation
tests, and in one experiment have
their spinal columns broken.
Med Center spokesman Mike
Coodkind defended the University's
use of pound animals in research,
saying that the research is essential
to saving human lives, there is often
no alternative to using animals, the
experiments are carried on under
humane conditions, and pound ani
mals are going to be put to death
anyway.
"Everyone of our dogs out there
running in the exercise room has re
ceived a reprieve from the pound,"
he says. "We're offering a better al
ternative."
Horton said that only 2 to 2Vi per
cent of the 15 million animals in
pounds across the country are used
in research — the rest are put to
death — and he called it a "bizarre
morality" to kill those in the pound
and breed others to be used for re
search.
Horton also said that Stanford
takes extreme care to ensure that the
animals do not suffer pain, and he
noted that a nine-member commit
tee, including people outside the re
search community, monitors animal
care at Stanford. A brochure distri
buted by the Medical Center notes
that a staff veterinarian is there to
stop any abuse and that the United
States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) inspects the facilities.
Coodkind said that statements
such as Marlow's indicate the ignor
ance among the public concerning
the use of animals for biomedical re
search. Goodkind cited Marlow's
complaint about the breaking of spi
nal columns as an example.
"I don't know of any research like
that at Stanford right now, but if it is
being done it's important for re
search on paraplegics," Coodkind
said. "The spinal cord work on ani
mals is done as a surgical operation.
They're not whacked with a baseball

bat."
Lise Ciraud, director of the Palo
Alto Humane Society Board charged
that the Med Center is hiding the
truth. Giraud claimed that former
students and employees of the Cen
ter have told her of horrifying condi
tions for the animals.
"They do not give post-operative
treatment to the dogs. They have
dogs that are stir-crazy and have
been there for years."
Giraud said that some of the exper
iments are conducted purely to gen
erate more research grants for Stan
ford. While acknowledging that
other experiments are scientifically
beneficial, she attacked the use of
pound animals.
A 1981 USDA report indicated
some problems with Stanford's care,
including algae in dogs' water dishes
and cat cages lined with newspaper
only. The University failed to meet
the standards of the American Asso
ciation for the Accreditation of Labo
ratory Animal Care (AAALAC) due to

a lack of separate pre- and post
operative rooms.
But Goodkind said Stanford has
since "fixed all the things USDA told
us to fix," and the University expects
to regain AAALAC membership
when a new $12 million "state-of
the-art animal facility" is completed
in 1984.
The WARN group is nevertheless
pointing to the USDA and AAALAC
reports as part of its protest against
Stanford, in addition to attacking the
shipment of pound animals from
Arizona.
A spokesman from the Maricopa
County Rabies Animal Control Cen
tersaid that 112dogsand41 cats were
purchased by Stanford during the
first eight months of 1983, but Good
kind said only 50 dogs and 11 cats
were brought to the University, with
the remaining being sent to other re
search institutions. Before these 1983
deliveries, Stanford had 103 dogs and
82 cats at the Medical Center, ob
tained largely from Arizona and

Southern California pounds.
The research community is behind
in the public relations campaign, ias
the Arizona State rally is just one
example of the coordinated, nation
wide effort against experiments vviHh
pound animals.
In California, State Senate Presi
dent Pro Tem David Roberti is spon
soring a bill (SB883) which would
prohibit pounds statewide from sell
ing or giving away animals for re
search, and on the national levjel
Stanford's Congressman Tom LantOs
(D-11th District) is lobbying for a
strengthening of the Animal Welfare
Act.
Horton is confident, however, that
people will recognize the necessity
of the research and that "there really
aren't two sides to this issue." He
says those who claim to have the
"moral high ground" are working
against those who are trying to al
leviate pain and suffering, and that
what is needed is an informed pub
lic.

RISKY BUSINESS: Medical researchers such as Assoc. Prof. James Dewson who use laboratory animals to gair
a better understanding of human phenomena have come under increasing criticism from animal protection
groups in recent years.
Animal rights groups are planning to protest Stan
ford's use of Arizona pound animals in research here
during the Arizona/Stanford football game tomorrow.
Stanford has always been looked to as a great institu
tion of higher learning, but the University is going to
have an image problem with this," said Muriel Marlow,
head of the Western Animal Rights Network (WARN)
c hapter of Arizona's Maricopa County and organizer of
tomorrow night's rally. "I am personally disgusted with
Stanford."
Marlow said she expects between 75 and 100 people at
tomorrow night's rally, and that pickets should be ex
pected "every place where Stanford plays football and

basketball" in Arizona.
Stanford's Director of Government Relations Larry
Horton said he does not expect tomorrow night's rally to
be significant, but he does acknowledge that the animal
rights groups have become a force to be reckoned with.
"The biomedical community hasn't taken seriously
the irresponsible claims of those who have attacked
research," Horton said. "The animal groups have great
energy and are very effective, and now there is an awa
kening that a job of educating the public has to be
done."
The focal point of the controversy is Stanford's Medi
cal Center, where pound animals, shipped mostly from
out of state due to opposition from
California communities, are used in a
variety of experiments, ranging from
heart disease resarch to artificial limb
development and testing.
Marlow said that stray dogs and
cats are being sent by the pound to
Stanford, where they are subjected
to "archaic" treatment.
Once at labs such as Stanford's,
Marlow said, the animals are used in
research involving high radiation
tests, and in one experiment have
their spinal columns broken.
Med Center spokesman Mike
Coodkind defended the University's
use of pound animals in research,
saying that the research is essential
to saving human lives, there is often
no alternative to using animals, the
experiments are carried on under
humane conditions, and pound ani
mals are going to be put to death
anyway.
"Everyone of our dogs out there
running in the exercise room has re
ceived a reprieve from the pound,"
he says. "We're offering a better al
ternative."
Horton said that only 2 to 2Vi per
cent of the 15 million animals in
pounds across the country are used
in research — the rest are put to
death — and he called it a "bizarre
morality" to kill those in the pound
and breed others to be used for re
search.
Horton also said that Stanford
takes extreme care to ensure that the
animals do not suffer pain, and he
noted that a nine-member commit
tee, including people outside the re
search community, monitors animal
care at Stanford. A brochure distri
buted by the Medical Center notes
that a staff veterinarian is there to
stop any abuse and that the United
States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) inspects the facilities.
Coodkind said that statements
such as Marlow's indicate the ignor
ance among the public concerning
the use of animals for biomedical re
search. Goodkind cited Marlow's
complaint about the breaking of spi
nal columns as an example.
"I don't know of any research like
that at Stanford right now, but if it is
being done it's important for re
search on paraplegics," Coodkind
said. "The spinal cord work on ani
mals is done as a surgical operation.
They're not whacked with a baseball

bat."
Lise Ciraud, director of the Palo
Alto Humane Society Board charged
that the Med Center is hiding the
truth. Giraud claimed that former
students and employees of the Cen
ter have told her of horrifying condi
tions for the animals.
"They do not give post-operative
treatment to the dogs. They have
dogs that are stir-crazy and have
been there for years."
Giraud said that some of the exper
iments are conducted purely to gen
erate more research grants for Stan
ford. While acknowledging that
other experiments are scientifically
beneficial, she attacked the use of
pound animals.
A 1981 USDA report indicated
some problems with Stanford's care,
including algae in dogs' water dishes
and cat cages lined with newspaper
only. The University failed to meet
the standards of the American Asso
ciation for the Accreditation of Labo
ratory Animal Care (AAALAC) due to

a lack of separate pre- and post
operative rooms.
But Goodkind said Stanford has
since "fixed all the things USDA told
us to fix," and the University expects
to regain AAALAC membership
when a new $12 million "state-of
the-art animal facility" is completed
in 1984.
The WARN group is nevertheless
pointing to the USDA and AAALAC
reports as part of its protest against
Stanford, in addition to attacking the
shipment of pound animals from
Arizona.
A spokesman from the Maricopa
County Rabies Animal Control Cen
tersaid that 112dogsand41 cats were
purchased by Stanford during the
first eight months of 1983, but Good
kind said only 50 dogs and 11 cats
were brought to the University, with
the remaining being sent to other re
search institutions. Before these 1983
deliveries, Stanford had 103 dogs and
82 cats at the Medical Center, ob
tained largely from Arizona and

Southern California pounds.
The research community is behind
in the public relations campaign, ias
the Arizona State rally is just one
example of the coordinated, nation
wide effort against experiments vviHh
pound animals.
In California, State Senate Presi
dent Pro Tem David Roberti is spon
soring a bill (SB883) which would
prohibit pounds statewide from sell
ing or giving away animals for re
search, and on the national levjel
Stanford's Congressman Tom LantOs
(D-11th District) is lobbying for a
strengthening of the Animal Welfare
Act.
Horton is confident, however, that
people will recognize the necessity
of the research and that "there really
aren't two sides to this issue." He
says those who claim to have the
"moral high ground" are working
against those who are trying to al
leviate pain and suffering, and that
what is needed is an informed pub
lic.
