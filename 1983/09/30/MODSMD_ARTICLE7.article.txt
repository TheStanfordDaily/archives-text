## Stanford program boosts public schools 
### LISA ASPINWALL 
In its second year, the Stan
ford and the Schools Study
project is uniting professors
and graduate students from
the School of Education with
policy makers from six local
school districts.
The three-year study is in
tended to provide a data base
for institutional change in local
high schools, according to
Mary Nur, assistant director of
the study. Affecting more than
20,000 students, the program's
long-range goals include
studies of testing, curriculum,
external factors and their im
pact on student development,
and teacher training — espe
cially in math, science and
computers.
Although these programs
haven't gotten beyond ques
tionnairesand meetings, all are
designed to improve pre
college education.
Initiated by University Presi

dent Donald Kennedy and
Dean of Education Myron At
kin, the program will build
collaboration between the
School of Education and local
districts to address areas of
mutual interest and need.
Stanford will benefit by ob
taining teacher training for
School of Education students.
"The study is also concerned
with changing the School of
Education, doing things
differently on the basis of what
we do in the study," said Elliot
Eisner, professor of education
and art.
Bob Madgic, director of cur
riculum for Los Altos-
Mountain View schools, said
he believes the study will be
successful because it is a col
laborative effort.
"The study will be a factor in
improving curriculum," he
said, "because the schools will
participate in developing those
findings."

Also, the University has a
vital stake in the study because
Stanford is a teacher-training
institution, Madgic said.
Superintendent of Los
Altos-Mountain View Schools
Paul Sakamoto said the study is
not as collaborative as he
would like it to be.
"I hope it will lead to some
practical kinds of assistance
that we can provide to our fac
ulty," he said. "Unless it has
some practical return to our
staff, from our standpoint it's
not going to be successful."
Last year, the only personnel
trained were high school ad
ministrators. The second year
includes plans to involve de
partment coordinators, then
individual teachers — 90 per
cent of a high school staff.
Sakamoto suggested teacher
clinics for two reasons: to
spread data from the project
and to provide intellectual
stimulation to his staff.

"There's nothing negative;
it's still wait-and-see," lesus
Sanchez, principal of Los Altos
High School, said. "I feel good
about the study — it has real
possibilities. Stanford is reach
ing out to schools where they
can be of support."
Sanchez said he believes his
school has a good working re
lationship with Stanford.
"We are being consulted a
great deal," he said. "We are in
constant contact."
So far, the only feature of the
program that has directly af
fected students — other than
questionnaires — was a
shadowing program devel
oped by Eisner. Stanford Ph.D.
candidates trailed four Moun
tain View High students — two
seniors and two sophomores
— for two weeks to "see the
rnurseofan entireday, not just
look at classes indepen
dently."
This year Stanford will con

duct 18 case studies in six
schools and also follow
teachers to understand the
demands of dealing with 160
students per day, Eisner said.
Stanford hopes to continue
its relationship with the
schools; there is no clear cut
termination date for the study.
