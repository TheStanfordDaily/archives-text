# Post-game shower interviews banned
## 
### JULIANN ANDERSON 
The Athletic Department, spurred by a female
reporter's effort to gain access to the Stanford
football locker rooms, has adopted a new policy
regarding the dressing areas: No journalists are
allowed inside immediately after a game.
Under the new policy, reporters must wait in a
nearby conference room and request that certain
players be brought in during the first 40 post-game
minutes. Afterward, anyone — male or female —
may enter the locker room.
Under the old policy, female reporters were not
allowed into the locker room until athletes had
finished showering. A runner was hired by the
University to fetch any athlete from the locker
room to speak with a female reporter. An inter
view was then conducted in a hallway adjacent to
the dressing area.
The decision was announced less than a day
before the season-opening Oklahoma contest
Sept. 10, and was made because Kristin
Huckshorn, a San Jose Mercury reporter covering
Cardinal football, needed to enter the dressing
area quickly due to deadline pressures.
"Last year I didn't go into the locker room,"
Huckshorn said. "I was generally having to wait
until they showered, and I didn't start my story
until 6 p.m." Huckshorn said she was not dissatis

fied with the old policy.
"There wasn't a problem with how it was set up,
or I would have protested," Huckshorn said.
However, just prior to the Oklahoma game,
Huckshorn's editor told her she must have the
story finished by 7 p.m., making it necessary for
her to enter the locker room in order to get quick
responses from the players. When she asked to be
admitted her request was denied, and the news
paper subsequently demanded access for all re
porters or none.
Steve Raczynski, co-director of the Sports In
formation Office, said that the department was in a
difficult position.
"We had to make a decision," Raczynski said.
"Either allow Kristin or any other woman into the
locker room or ban everyone. It was an all or
nothing proposition."
The new policy, he continued, is not very
different than the old policy except that reporters
now usually don't get the exclusive interviews in
the conference rooms that they were able to get in
the locker room.
Huckshorn said she is satisfied with Stanford's
policy as long as everyone is in the same position.
Raczynski said the reason behind the closure
was concern for the players.
"It has a lot to do with privacy," he said. Most of
the other Pac-10 universities, including Berkeley,

employ a similar closed locker room policy. How
ever, Gary Rausch, UCLA's sports information di
rector, said that they would allow a woman inside
their locker room provided that her back was to
the areas where scantily-clad players would roam.
A run-and-fetch situation would be used here, as
elsewhere.
But Rausch said that lack of space in the locker
room often makes conference room interviews
necessary. Calling the locker areas "totally in
adequate for the number of people using them,"
he cited the sheer crush of players, coaches and
athletic staff in the steamy room as a reason for
reporter removal.
A representative from Berkeley's athletic de
partment said Berkeley has a similar closed locker
room policy because "the coach indicated that he
would like to watch the media more closely."
Although Huckshorn said she would not protest
the current locker room policy, she did add that
the coaching staff was not particularly helpful in
her pursuit of news.
"Football coaches will be the last people to sup
port female reporters," she said. "When I ask a
question, I can generally tell from the response if
I'm taken seriously. The coaches often have re
sponses tinged with sarcasm.
"After all," she added, "football is the macho
sport."
