## The 						Stanford Daily Reagan library a la carte 
### 
Not surprisingly, the Hoover Institution
committee headed by former Reagan assistant
Martin Anderson has found the proposed
Reagan presidential library complex here "an
immensely valuable academic resource to the
entire Stanford community." We can only par
tially agree.
The current proposal includes a library,
museum and a center for public affairs. We
only support the library.
The presidential papers and documents
which would be kept in the library could add
greatly to the intellectual climate of this univer
sity and to the pursuit of valuable scholarship.
To have these resources within such close
reach would be a convenience most useful to
both students and faculty.
As for the museum, we see no value academi
cally for such an addition. We fear that it will
only create a tourist atmosphere and provide
no educational benefits for the University. We
wonder how Stanford will be able to handle
the expected 700,000 visitors the first year and
300,000 to 400,000 each year thereafter which
are expected if the full-scale complex is built.
Stanford is an institution of higher learning
and not a warehouse for glorifying presidents.
Of most concern to us, however, is the
planned center for public affairs. With such an
innocuous title it is difficult to see how such a
center could harm the academic environment
of the University. The Hoover committee
speaks of plans for lavish conference rooms
and auditoriums as well as offices for visiting
fellows from government, business, academics
and the media.

Our worry is not that the center won't draw
distinguished fellows but rather just what kind
of criteria will be used in choosing them and
how limited they will be in their areas of study.
Stanford has tried to keep its academics free
from restraints â€” governmental, corporate and
political. Would The Ronald Reagan Center for
Public Affairs adhere to this non-partisan com
mitment? We believe the University should
remain devoted to building its reputation on
pure academic research, not partisan politics,
be it liberal or conservative.
At this time, plans for the center bring it un
der the auspices of the Hoover Institution,
which is currently embroiled in a campuswide
debate concerning its relationship with the
University. We do not see how the University
could now possibly approve of a set-up giving
Hoover control of the policy center when it is
still investigating Hoover's partisan ties. If the
center were to be University-run, instead of
being under Hoover control, the questions of
partisanship may be answered more easily.
Whatever the case Stanford should not rush
into the project without taking into considera
tion the views of faculty and students. One
must try to analyze whether a Reagan library of
any sort even belongs on this campus.
Reagan's connection is not with the University
but with the Hoover Institution, the leading
advocate of the library proposal.
Stanford does not need a presidential li
brary complex to make it respectable. Sure, it
would be an honor to house a presidential li
brary but the University should review the
entire package before blindly accepting it.
