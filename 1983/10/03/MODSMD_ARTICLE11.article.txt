# Bring the boys home

### 
U.S. Marines stationed in Lebanon are slip
ping deeper and deeper into the fighting
there. Two more deaths during fighting this
month raised the American casualty toll to four
dead, 32 wounded. The Marines have
abandoned their original role as detached
peacemakers and are now actively supporting
Amin Gemayel's minority-based Christian go
vernment. They have undertaken an
impossible task, and it is time to bring the boys
home.
Official U.S. policy in Lebanon, most clearly
stated by Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, has been to "consolidate the au
thority of that nation's weak government and
to deter attacks against the Lebanese Army
and facilitate peace negotiations." This is an
honorable — but unrealistic — goal. Lebanon is
filled with dozens of religious sects and private
armies that have been embroiled in a civil war
for more than a decade. Furthermore, Israeli
and Syrian forces have partitioned the country
in a piecemeal fashion. There is little hope for
establishing an an undivided Lebanon under a
national polity.
U.S. policy-makers are only asking for trou
ble by sending troops into this war-torn
country. Presently, 1200 Marines are sta
tioned in a vulnerable area near the Beirut air
port, and a flotilla of aircraft carriers are
poised off the coast. Two weeks ago, the

Marines directly entered the fighting by bom
bing the Syrian-backed Druze opposition in
the Shuf mountains near Beirut. In doing this,
the United States gave tacit approval to the ex
tremist pro-government Christian Phlange
militia battling the Druze. This incremental rise
in America's role cannot help remind one of
America's incremental involvement in a small
Indonesian country 20 years ago.
The choices for America are difficult. Ameri
can policy-makers have tried to depict our in
volvement in Lebanon as "vital" to American
interests. But if the Gemayel government
should fall. Syrian forces would surely be met
with strong opposition by internal groups. If
they pushed too far, they would be met by Is
raeli force.
American withdrawal might be costly, but
not as costly as a prolonged controverisal
police action that ends in a rout. By arranging
to place U.N observers in Lebanon when we
leave, we could hope to maintain some order
there. The cease-fire agreement negotiated by
the United States and Saudi Arabia last week
provides a perfect opportunity for America to
withdraw from Lebanon "with honor."
Americans can only hope it will not take
the loss of many more American lives for
policy-makers to realize it is time for the U.S.
to get out of Lebanon.
