## Don't apologize for Shockley 
### 
Consider this hypothetical possibility: a member of
the Stanford faculty known for his Marxist views is
invited to address incoming Stanford freshmen.
Protestors appear at his talk. "No to Communist
genocide" signs appear outside the auditorium. Noth
ing the professor has said or written indicates that he
favored Stalin's brutal purges, the genocide of the Pol
Pot regime, the forced resettlement of Indians in
Nicaragua or any of the other brutalities carried out by
communist regimes. He insists that there is nothing in
Marxism — certainly not in his interpretation of Marxist
theory at any rate — to sanction the suppression of civil
liberties or the liquidation of a regime's opponents.
Yet some students and faculty, noting the historical
fact that all communist states have been repressive to
some degree or other (some indeed brutally so) claim
that Marxist theory inevitably leads to oppression and
on that basis angrily protest his talk and express their
shock to the University administration.
Would it be proper for University officials to
apologize to offended students or express embarrass
ment over the affair?
The circumstances surrounding Prof. William Shock
ley's talk during freshman orientation have yet to be
fully clarified. The Stanford physicist was one of three
Nobel laureates invited to talk to incoming freshmen
about the work that led to their Nobel awards. Shock
ley talked about his work on transistors. It appears
there may have been some confusion about whether
certain freshmen were required to go to his talk. If
some students were under the impression that they
had to listen to Shockley and would be exposed against
their wishes to his genetic theories, then an apology by
University officials for the confusion might conceivably
have been appropriate. Although students should be
encouraged to listen to arguments they disagree with,
no student should be forced to hear views he or she
personally considers offensive.
However, if the apology made to students conveyed
the impression that the University was embarrassed by
Shockley's views, then that is an altogether different
and very troubling matter.
I take strong exception to the idea that any theory
could be placed beyond the pale of legitimate scientific
discussion at a university simply because some groups
believe that it might have dangerous moral or political
repercussions. If this view were to take root, it could
easily jeopardize academic freedom because one man's

tea is just as easily somebody else's poison. Any re
search in genetics entails the possibility of finding
statistically significant differences between population
groups in the distribution of a characteristic, some
thing physical anthropologists have known for a long
time. The risk that such findings might have moral or
political repercussions always exists though by no
means does it follow that they should be allowed to
have any such moral or political consequences.
The same dilemma arises in my own field of sociol
ogy. Should, for example, the hypothesis advanced by
some sociologists (and not just sociologists!) that crime
is caused by unemployment and other broader social
forces beyond the control of individuals be put under
wraps and denied a hearing because some believe that
such a theory might lead to a weakening of the socially
useful assumption of individual responsibility, thereby
undermining the moral foundations of social order?
Whatever one thinks of Shockley's genetic theories,
it should be a matter of concern when University admi
nistrators say anything in their official capacity that
conveys the impression that some theories do not have
the same degree of legitimacy to be aired on campus as
others. If they do this, they are legitimizing an uncon
scionable double standard on campus. While they may
be defending academic freedom in a formal institution
al sense, at the same time they are undercutting its
legitimacy by pandering to the moral outrage of indi
viduals some of whom would have no objection to
closing off debate to those views and theories they
dislike. Today these happen to be Shockley's views but
tomorrow they could be your views or mine.
University administrators act properly and within
the domain of their institutional authority when they
apologize or express embarrassment over unprofes
sional conduct by members of the campus community,
as when an individual or group tries to prevent other
from hearing unpopular views, incites violence or dis
order, is unfair and applies inappropriate standards in
the treatment accorded to students, colleagues and so
forth.
They act outside the proper sphere of their author
ity when they apologize for the expression or pres
ence on campus of doctrines that just happen to be un
popular.

it should be a matter of concern when University admi
nistrators say anything in their official capacity that
conveys the impression that some theories do not have
the same degree of legitimacy to be aired on campus as
others. If they do this, they are legitimizing an uncon
scionable double standard on campus. While they may
be defending academic freedom in a formal institution
al sense, at the same time they are undercutting its
legitimacy by pandering to the moral outrage of indi
viduals some of whom would have no objection to
closing off debate to those views and theories they
dislike. Today these happen to be Shockley's views but
tomorrow they could be your views or mine.
University administrators act properly and within
the domain of their institutional authority when they
apologize or express embarrassment over unprofes
sional conduct by members of the campus community,
as when an individual or group tries to prevent other
from hearing unpopular views, incites violence or dis
order, is unfair and applies inappropriate standards in
the treatment accorded to students, colleagues and so
forth.
They act outside the proper sphere of their author
ity when they apologize for the expression or pres
ence on campus of doctrines that just happen to be un
popular.
