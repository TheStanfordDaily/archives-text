Federal benefits
Frederick Stark (Viewpoint,
Sept. 29) gives a long list of reasons
for not working for the federal
government. I recently came to
work at Stanford after 20 years
working for the federal govern
ment and, in contrast to Stark, look
back not bitterly, but with a lot of
satisfaction and some nostalgia.
Now it is true I didn't get rich but
that wasn't what I was looking for. I
was looking for a chance to have a
personal influence, however
modest, on national priorities and
policies and I found it.
Most of Stark's points have to do
with comparative salary and benefit
levels and he concludes, "(C)ollege
graduates are much better off
working in private enterprise with
the chance of becoming one of the
$1 million-a-year corporation presi
dents . .

Ignoring other more idealistic
considerations, I have three prob
lems with that advice: one, it
assumes the only thing college
graduates care about is money;
two, the probabilities of becoming
a million-dollar-a-year executive
are such that one could with equal
rationality aim at becoming a rock
star or striking oil and, three,
Stark's federal/private sector com
parisons are very dubious.
While most of Stark's points
about the federal pay and fringe
benefits are correct (although the
current top civil service salary is
$67,200, not $57,500 as Stark states),
his portrayal of comparative
benefits in the private sector is
questionable.
Stark says federal employees get
less vacation. Federal employees
with 15 years service get 30
working days (in other words, six
weeks) of vacation annually. That
seems pretty good to me.

Stark says federal employees
have to work 40 hours a week,
while electricians in New York only
work 25 hours a week. I worked
about 50 or 55 hours a week for the
government because I enjoyed it.
Stark says retired federal
employees under age 62 only get
one-half the cost-of-living increases
those 62 and older get. I don't
think there are too many private
employers who let you draw retire
ment pay, as does the federal go
vernment, at age 55 (or even
younger).

Do work for Fed
As a former federal employee
with years of positive experiences,
and as a member of University
President Donald Kennedy's staff
charged with encouraging students

to consider public service careers,
I was outraged by last Thursday's
viewpoint "Don't work for the
Fed" (Sept. 29). My first reaction is
to feel sorry for Frederick Stark,
who obviously spent a lifetime in
jobs he didn't like and now looks
back from a regretful retirement.
As Kennedy pointed out in
his commencement speech last
)une, there have been too many
negative messages from the past
two administrations in Washington,
knocking the federal service and
discouraging the best and the
brightest from considering public
service. The reasons are many
(Watergate, Vietnam, budget cuts),
but we are certainly a long way
from the tone of the early 1960s
when President John F. Kennedy
said in his State of the Union ad
dress that he wanted public service
to be a proud and lively career.
I can say from firsthand experi
ence working for the U.S. Senate,

the Treasury Department and now
as a consultant to the U.S. Justice
Department, that there is still a lot
of spirit out there among the rank
and file, a lot of individuals ded
icated to public service who are
having fun. No one forces mid- or
top-level federal employees to put
in long hours and none of these
employees receive or expect extra
financial compensation for the long
hours. The work is invigorating
and the challenges overwhelming. I
found myself fighting this tendency
to work long hours, and started
working at the Senate part-time as a
way of keeping work in perspec
tive. But soon I was burning mid
night oil like so many of my col
leagues.
Any Stanford student who is
thinking about what to do in their
life after Stanford, should consider
one other important reason for
spending some portion of his or
her career in the federal govern-

ment. This is a more selfish reason —
you can learn a lot which will be
very valuable to you in most private
or public jobs. The lawyers in
Washington who are most sought
after, get the biggest fees, are
those who have done their stint in
the government, know the policies,
politics and actors. The same is true
of many bankers, executives of
manufacturing firms and system
analysts. Because of the shrinking
workforce, the need for bright,
energetic young professionals is
great now. The cash rewards are
less than what you would get in the
private sector, and it may not be
the best place to work for your
entire life, but for a few years
government work is fun, interest
ing, and an option that Stanford
students would do well to seriously
consider.

lems with that advice: one, it
assumes the only thing college
graduates care about is money;
two, the probabilities of becoming
a million-dollar-a-year executive
are such that one could with equal
rationality aim at becoming a rock
star or striking oil and, three,
Stark's federal/private sector com
parisons are very dubious.
While most of Stark's points
about the federal pay and fringe
benefits are correct (although the
current top civil service salary is
$67,200, not $57,500 as Stark states),
his portrayal of comparative
benefits in the private sector is
questionable.
Stark says federal employees get
less vacation. Federal employees
with 15 years service get 30
working days (in other words, six
weeks) of vacation annually. That
seems pretty good to me.

Stark says federal employees
have to work 40 hours a week,
while electricians in New York only
work 25 hours a week. I worked
about 50 or 55 hours a week for the
government because I enjoyed it.
Stark says retired federal
employees under age 62 only get
one-half the cost-of-living increases
those 62 and older get. I don't
think there are too many private
employers who let you draw retire
ment pay, as does the federal go
vernment, at age 55 (or even
younger).

Do work for Fed
As a former federal employee
with years of positive experiences,
and as a member of University
President Donald Kennedy's staff
charged with encouraging students

to consider public service careers,
I was outraged by last Thursday's
viewpoint "Don't work for the
Fed" (Sept. 29). My first reaction is
to feel sorry for Frederick Stark,
who obviously spent a lifetime in
jobs he didn't like and now looks
back from a regretful retirement.
As Kennedy pointed out in
his commencement speech last
)une, there have been too many
negative messages from the past
two administrations in Washington,
knocking the federal service and
discouraging the best and the
brightest from considering public
service. The reasons are many
(Watergate, Vietnam, budget cuts),
but we are certainly a long way
from the tone of the early 1960s
when President John F. Kennedy
said in his State of the Union ad
dress that he wanted public service
to be a proud and lively career.
I can say from firsthand experi
ence working for the U.S. Senate,

the Treasury Department and now
as a consultant to the U.S. Justice
Department, that there is still a lot
of spirit out there among the rank
and file, a lot of individuals ded
icated to public service who are
having fun. No one forces mid- or
top-level federal employees to put
in long hours and none of these
employees receive or expect extra
financial compensation for the long
hours. The work is invigorating
and the challenges overwhelming. I
found myself fighting this tendency
to work long hours, and started
working at the Senate part-time as a
way of keeping work in perspec
tive. But soon I was burning mid
night oil like so many of my col
leagues.
Any Stanford student who is
thinking about what to do in their
life after Stanford, should consider
one other important reason for
spending some portion of his or
her career in the federal govern-

ment. This is a more selfish reason —
you can learn a lot which will be
very valuable to you in most private
or public jobs. The lawyers in
Washington who are most sought
after, get the biggest fees, are
those who have done their stint in
the government, know the policies,
politics and actors. The same is true
of many bankers, executives of
manufacturing firms and system
analysts. Because of the shrinking
workforce, the need for bright,
energetic young professionals is
great now. The cash rewards are
less than what you would get in the
private sector, and it may not be
the best place to work for your
entire life, but for a few years
government work is fun, interest
ing, and an option that Stanford
students would do well to seriously
consider.

Federal benefits
Frederick Stark (Viewpoint,
Sept. 29) gives a long list of reasons
for not working for the federal
government. I recently came to
work at Stanford after 20 years
working for the federal govern
ment and, in contrast to Stark, look
back not bitterly, but with a lot of
satisfaction and some nostalgia.
Now it is true I didn't get rich but
that wasn't what I was looking for. I
was looking for a chance to have a
personal influence, however
modest, on national priorities and
policies and I found it.
Most of Stark's points have to do
with comparative salary and benefit
levels and he concludes, "(C)ollege
graduates are much better off
working in private enterprise with
the chance of becoming one of the
$1 million-a-year corporation presi
dents . .

considerations, I have three prob
lems with that advice: one, it
