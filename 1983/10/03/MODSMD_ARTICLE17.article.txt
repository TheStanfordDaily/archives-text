# Credit Union errors lead to extra costs on customer accounts

### DIANE PATTERSON 
In the latest in a series of ef
forts to correct past internal
mismanagement, the Stanford
Credit Union has imple
mented surcharges on check
ing and savings accounts that
fall below a $500 minimum bal
ance.
The charges are the first
such rates in the Credit
Union's 24-year history.
Charles Dawes, the
recently-hired manager of the
Credit Union, said the fees
are primarily to cover operat
ing expenses.
He has invited customers
who have questioned the new
fees "to shop around" for a
better overall deal at another
bank.
Sources at the Credit Union
say the past poor government
of the bank led to the levy on
the negligent accounts and to
the hiring of Dawes in April
1983.
On June 16, Credit Union
members elected a new board
of directors.

The Credit Union is open to
non-students who work spe
cifically on Stanford grounds
and their families, as well as
Stanford graduates and un
dergraduates.
Karen Huyser, an electrical
engineering graduate stu
dent, and Loring Davies, a
former University student and
now a teacher at Palo Alto
High School, both commented
that despite the charges it is
easier and more convenient to
bank at the Credit Union that
at other banks close by the
campus.
One customer who refused
to give her name said she
stayed with the Credit Union
out of "loyalty to the Univer
sity." However, she called the
union "inefficient and a time
wasting." These new sur
charges are merely another
inconvenience of the Credit
Union, she said.
Davies said the Credit
Union is planning more
changes in its operations to
make it more competitive with
commercial banks in the area.
