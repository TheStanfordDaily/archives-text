# Progressive Republicans meet to plan strategy
## 
### JOHN CHILCOTT 
After circulating flyers in
thousands of registration
packets and hailing itself as
the "progressive Republi
can majority," the Stanford
Republican League held its
first meeting last week.
Chaired by Stanford
graduate Roman Buhler, an
executive committee mem
ber of the California Re
publican League and
former president of Stan
ford College Republicans,
the meeting focused on or
ganizing a Stanford
"publicity network." Buh
ler outlined three goals for
the league: to educate
people about the Republi
can party, to secure voter
registration and to foster
"leadership development."
Hamlan said although
some points of the group's
"moderate manifesto,"
such as support of the
Equal Rights Amendment
and the dismissal of Secre
tary of the Interior James
Watt, are compatible with
Democratic views, the
group is mainstream Re
publican in its positions on
government spending, so
cial programs and foreign
policy. He noted that
moderate stands will help
to broaden the group's

base of support and that
compatible views between
parties could only help to
encourage an atmosphere
of "bipartisan politics."
The group's education
program will incorporate
press releases, flyers and a
campuswide survey on cur
rent issues. The group also

hopes to establish a
speakers program which
would culminate in an ap
pearance by a U.S. senator
or Cabinet-level official.
Finally, the group plans a
voter registration drive to
encourage students to
become involved in the po
litical process on campus

and in the local structure
of Santa Clara County.
Field trips that would take
students to campaign man
agement seminars and the
state convention in
Sacramento in January 1984
are also planned
Mark Hamlan, treasurer
of the California Republi

can League, said that Stan
ford was being organized
as a local chapter of the
California Republican
League but emphasized
that the group would be
comprised of students and
former students represent
ing "Republicans of everv
stripe.''
