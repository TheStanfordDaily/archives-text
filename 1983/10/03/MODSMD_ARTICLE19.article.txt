# Rain prevents Beach Boys concert here

### 
Saturday's Beach Boys concert at Frost
Amphitheater was cancelled due to heavy
rains the night before, according to Lar
ry Davidson, acting director of Univer
sity Events and Services.
"It rained so hard on Friday that the
whole place was turned into muck,"

Davidson said. He added that ground
conditions would have made it impossible
to set up the group's equipment and
would have made the concert uncom
fortable for fans.
The sun on Saturday dried out the
Frost grounds so that yesterday's Santana
concert could go on.

Refunds for the Beach Boys concert
may be obtained at the place of ticket
purchase, Davidson said.
Ticketholders also had the option of
using their tickets for the Beach Boys
performance in Sacramento or the San
tana performance on campus yesterday.
