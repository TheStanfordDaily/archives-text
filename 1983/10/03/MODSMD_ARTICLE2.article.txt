# Palo Altans go 10K in support of freeze
## 
### NANCY WILLIAMS Staff writer 
More than 130 supporters of a nu
clear weapons freeze walked 10
kilometers through the streets of
downtown Palo Alto Saturday mor
ning to raise money and gather sup
port for their cause.
The Mid-Peninsula Freeze Cam
paign, a member of the National Nu
clear Weapons Freeze Committee,
organized the walk which was timed
to coincide with walks in 250 cities
nationwide.
The two to three hour walk began
and ended at City Hall Plaza. The
walkers, who raised more than
$7500 in pledges, carried bright
blue balloons printed with the
words "Freeze Walk." Many of the
participants hoisted up large
placards promoting the freeze issue
and arguing against the controver
sial MX missile.

"The people are in favor of a
freeze," said Herb Borach, a
spokesperson for the Mid-
Peninsula Freeze Campaign. Borack
said the members of the Freeze
Campaign and its supporters seek
to translate that wish into law. "We
want to elect a president and a
congress that not only will support
a freeze but implement one as soon
as possible."
The walkers expressed faith that a
grass roots effort such as a local
walk could help to institute change.
"Individuals can make a differ
ence," said Mary Ann Kvenvollden,
an active member of Environmental
Volunteers. Describing the freeze
as the "ultimate environmental
issue," she declared that the walk
could only help the freeze effort.
Judy Gilligan completed the walk
with her entire family, P us "
hing four-month-old Katlin in
a baby carriage. She voiced
particular concern over the
nuclear arms race because of
her children. "I'd like them to
be able to grow up without

being fried in the process."
However, Joel Jensen, an
engineer for Southwall Cor
poration, said that he sup
ported the freeze because of
the brevity of its solution.
"Anything short of a freeze
would be too complicated for
general support," he con
cluded.
This December, a national

conference of the Nuclear
Weapons Committee will rec
ommend how to spend the
funds raised by the Palo Alto
walkers and other local
groups. The local chapters
will allocate an estimated $1
million, hoping to make their
mark on the 1984 elections by
electing candidates who favor
a freeze.
