# Choosing the humanities can be a Major Decision
## 
### MELINDA ISRAEL 
Is there life after a liberal
arts degree? Many current
Stanford students seem to
think not. As tuition costs
rise and economic times
worsen, pre-professional
majors are growing in
popularity.
The trend toward
career-oriented under
graduate study is a recent
topic of University con
cern. According to Audrey
Bernfield, coordinator of

departmental student
services in the School of
Humanities and Sciences,
last year there was an
"epidemic of sophomores
searching for majors to
guarantee jobs."
As editor of the new Uni
versity publication, "The
Major Decision," Bernfield
hopes to "give students the
freedom to choose a major
through interest, not voca
tional orientation."
"The Major Decision" is

a glossy 28-page booklet
featuring profiles of recent
Stanford alumni. Ranging
in profession from
software engineer to
actress, the contributors
all have one thing in com
mon: a broad liberal arts
education.

Another graduate attest
ing to the benefits of an
interest-chosen major is
Cynthia Baker, now a law
student at Hastings College
of Law. Far from regretting
her degree in Russian,
Baker explains, "I cherish
my experiences in the So
viet Union and with the
Russian club. They have
given me what appears to
employers and others I
meet a unique back
ground."
Baker continues her un
dergraduate interests
through her involvement
with the International Law
Club and research into So
viet law practices.
The idea for the major
booklet first came about
when Bernfield began in
terviewing department
chairs last year on "how to
use a major."
When some departments
requested that alumni
relate their post-graduate
experiences, the response
was extraordinary — almost
1000 letters. The quality
and consistency of the cor
respondence led to the

desire for a "general audi
ence'' for the letters.
Hence, the publication of
10,000 brochures, which
have been distributed to
parents ot freshmen, depart
ment chairs and the sopho
more class.
In conjunction with "The
Major Decision," the Uni
versity started a new tradi
tion this year of a
"sophomore convocation.''
Held in Frost Amphitheatre
on Sept. 27, the first con
vocation included dinner,
speeches by administra
tors, and dancing.
Bernfield said the sopho
more year is a tough one,
both academically and so
cially. She described the
freshman year as one in
which students have a
"cohesive group," sup
ported by Residential Edu
cation and faculty advising.
"Sophomores lose con
tact with their advisors and
friends," she explained.
"They have to regroup —
there is a need to develop
another community." On
top of these difficulties,
sophomores are pressured
to find a major discipline of
study.
As an adviser in the
Human Biology pro
gram, Bernfield says she
discovered a number of
students come to majors
through their friends in
the same program.
But Bernfield stresses
this is not the way to
decide. "It's like putting on
someone else's glasses
prescription,"she said.
Bernfield hopes "The
Major Decision" will show
students what ordinary
people have done with
their degrees. "We didn't
choose Sally Ride," she
said.

more year is a tough one,
both academically and so
cially. She described the
freshman year as one in
which students have a
"cohesive group," sup
ported by Residential Edu
cation and faculty advising.
"Sophomores lose con
tact with their advisors and
friends," she explained.
"They have to regroup —
there is a need to develop
another community." On
top of these difficulties,
sophomores are pressured
to find a major discipline of
study.
As an adviser in the
Human Biology pro
gram, Bernfield says she
discovered a number of
students come to majors
through their friends in
the same program.
But Bernfield stresses
this is not the way to
decide. "It's like putting on
someone else's glasses
prescription,"she said.
Bernfield hopes "The
Major Decision" will show
students what ordinary
people have done with
their degrees. "We didn't
choose Sally Ride," she
said.
