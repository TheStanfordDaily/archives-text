# Choosing the humanities can be a Major Decision
## 
### MELINDA ISRAEL 
Is there life after a liberal
arts degree? Many current
Stanford students seem to
think not. As tuition costs
rise and economic times
worsen, pre-professional
majors are growing in
popularity.
The trend toward
career-oriented under
graduate study is a recent
topic of University con
cern. According to Audrey
Bernfield, coordinator of

departmental student
services in the School of
Humanities and Sciences,
last year there was an
"epidemic of sophomores
searching for majors to
guarantee jobs."
As editor of the new Uni
versity publication, "The
Major Decision," Bernfield
hopes to "give students the
freedom to choose a major
through interest, not voca
tional orientation."
"The Major Decision" is

a glossy 28-page booklet
featuring profiles of recent
Stanford alumni. Ranging
in profession from
software engineer to
actress, the contributors
all have one thing in com
mon: a broad liberal arts
education.
