# Fighting war with computer 'peace games'
## 
### DIMITRIS THEODOROU 
After seeing the movie
War Game s, most people
probably head home with
out giving much thought to
the possibility of nuclear
war. After all, nuclear
holocausts only happen in
books and movies — or do
they?
John Larson, a part-time
electrical engineering stu
dent here, takes the idea of
nuclear war quite serious
ly. "The movie is full of
technical inaccuracies
(but) there are some valid
points in it that need to be
raised,' he said. The issue
of our technological de
pendence is a "very impor
tant one and the accepted
boundaries of technologi
cal risk have to be
delineated.''
Larson is actively in
volved with the issues of
war and technology. He is
currently co-director of
the Palo Alto chapter of
Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility
(CPSR) and co-founder of
Stanford Arms Control and
Disarmament Forum
(SACDF).
CPSR, which also has
chapters in the East Bay,
Boston, Madison, San Jose
and Seattle, describes itself
as a "national alliance of
people in computer
related fields who are
working to avert the
growing threat of nuclear
war."
The number of near
misses involving computer
defense systems triggered
CPSR's general statement:
"We deplore the squan
dering of our knowledge
and skills in the pursuit of
greater military power that
contributes not to our se
curity but to our common
peril. We call for the
redirection of our talents,
resources, and energies
towards more socially re
sponsible objectives. We
resolve to work for a world
in which science and tech
nology are used not to
produce weapons of war,
but to foster a safe and just
society."

sues have met with consi
derable success. Eric Hor
vitz, a medical student here
and co-founder of both or

success mainly to the em
phasis placed on communi
cation and involvement.
"Most people think of
student groups as being
very opinionated. They are
always surprised to find
out we are simply a sort of
mature discussion group,
with no point of view, ex-

cept interest in the future
of mankind," he said.
To achieve these goals,
CPSR and SACDF publish
newsletters, sponsor talks
and maintain libraries of
past forums.
Their latest project is
described as a "legitimate
challenge to computer
geniuses.'' Their
computer-based bulletin
board system (BBS)
welcomes anyone with a
personal computer or ter
minal and a 300 baud
modem.

BBS, "dedicated to the
exchange of messages on
the topics of nuclear war
and arms control," has
been accessed by about
2000 people so far. Any cal
ler may read or add to the
dialogue by going down
the tree structure that con
tains messages on various
subjects.
The conference tree "is
an outgrowth of the philos
ophy of the group to
promote discussion and
not to take sides and to
make possible a maximum

number of forums by as
many people as possible/'
Horvitz said.
The tree branches out to
topics such as nerve gas,
the MX missile, Lebanon,
space-based weapons, a
nuclear freeze and draft
dodgers. Following the
branch "Star Wars" and
going down a sub-branch
called "Anti-satellite," one
gets a copy of the recent
senate amendment on anti
satellite warheads against
objects in space, with an
extensive bibliography at
tached.
Other branches reveal
doubts about the impar
tiality of the United Na
tions, thoughts on the Hel
sinki Accords, conversa
tions on the draft and in
formation on the organo
phosphorous compounds
existing within U.S.
stockpiles, making the tree
a rich repository of facts
and opinions on war
related issues.
"Our tree system is more
technologically advanced
than the hotline between
the U.S. and the Soviet
Union," Horvitz said.
"Communication between
individuals and nations is at
a low and that creates
suspicions and paranoias.
The more we communicate
the better we feel about
each other."
The conference tree is
part of a group called
PEACENET dedicated to the
issue of disarmament. Lar
son, who is preparing a
proposal for further fun
ding to enlarge the system,
sees it as "a small step in
the direction of other net
working goals" that never
theless "stresses the im
portance of involvement
even on people that don't
feel very capable of under
standing the issues."
Larson sits in front of his
computer terminal, with
the air of someone not
believing in the ghost of
the machine."! don't
believe we can take life for
granted in this day and age
when we are so dependent
on very intangible things
and our lives are on six
minute notice," he said.

After seeing the movie
War Game s, most people
probably head home with
out giving much thought to
the possibility of nuclear
war. After all, nuclear
holocausts only happen in
books and movies — or do
they?
John Larson, a part-time
electrical engineering stu
dent here, takes the idea of
nuclear war quite serious
ly. "The movie is full of
technical inaccuracies
(but) there are some valid
points in it that need to be
raised,' he said. The issue
of our technological de
pendence is a "very impor
tant one and the accepted
boundaries of technologi
cal risk have to be
delineated.''
Larson is actively in
volved with the issues of
war and technology. He is
currently co-director of
the Palo Alto chapter of
Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility
(CPSR) and co-founder of
Stanford Arms Control and
Disarmament Forum
(SACDF).
CPSR, which also has
chapters in the East Bay,
Boston, Madison, San Jose
and Seattle, describes itself
as a "national alliance of
people in computer
related fields who are
working to avert the
growing threat of nuclear
war."
The number of near
misses involving computer
defense systems triggered
CPSR's general statement:
"We deplore the squan
dering of our knowledge
and skills in the pursuit of
greater military power that
contributes not to our se
curity but to our common
peril. We call for the
redirection of our talents,
resources, and energies
towards more socially re
sponsible objectives. We
resolve to work for a world
in which science and tech
nology are used not to
produce weapons of war,
but to foster a safe and just
society."

sues have met with consi
derable success. Eric Hor
vitz, a medical student here
and co-founder of both or
ganizations, ascribes this
success mainly to the em
phasis placed on communi
cation and involvement.
"Most people think of
student groups as being
very opinionated. They are
always surprised to find
out we are simply a sort of
mature discussion group,
with no point of view, ex-

cept interest in the future
of mankind," he said.
To achieve these goals,
CPSR and SACDF publish
newsletters, sponsor talks
and maintain libraries of
past forums.
Their latest project is
described as a "legitimate
challenge to computer
geniuses.'' Their
computer-based bulletin
board system (BBS)
welcomes anyone with a
personal computer or ter
minal and a 300 baud
modem.

BBS, "dedicated to the
exchange of messages on
the topics of nuclear war
and arms control," has
been accessed by about
2000 people so far. Any cal
ler may read or add to the
dialogue by going down
the tree structure that con
tains messages on various
subjects.
The conference tree "is
an outgrowth of the philos
ophy of the group to
promote discussion and
not to take sides and to
make possible a maximum

number of forums by as
many people as possible/'
Horvitz said.
The tree branches out to
topics such as nerve gas,
the MX missile, Lebanon,
space-based weapons, a
nuclear freeze and draft
dodgers. Following the
branch "Star Wars" and
going down a sub-branch
called "Anti-satellite," one
gets a copy of the recent
senate amendment on anti
satellite warheads against
objects in space, with an
extensive bibliography at
tached.
Other branches reveal
doubts about the impar
tiality of the United Na
tions, thoughts on the Hel
sinki Accords, conversa
tions on the draft and in
formation on the organo
phosphorous compounds
existing within U.S.
stockpiles, making the tree
a rich repository of facts
and opinions on war
related issues.
"Our tree system is more
technologically advanced
than the hotline between
the U.S. and the Soviet
Union," Horvitz said.
"Communication between
individuals and nations is at
a low and that creates
suspicions and paranoias.
The more we communicate
the better we feel about
each other."
The conference tree is
part of a group called
PEACENET dedicated to the
issue of disarmament. Lar
son, who is preparing a
proposal for further fun
ding to enlarge the system,
sees it as "a small step in
the direction of other net
working goals" that never
theless "stresses the im
portance of involvement
even on people that don't
feel very capable of under
standing the issues."
Larson sits in front of his
computer terminal, with
the air of someone not
believing in the ghost of
the machine."! don't
believe we can take life for
granted in this day and age
when we are so dependent
on very intangible things
and our lives are on six
minute notice," he said.
