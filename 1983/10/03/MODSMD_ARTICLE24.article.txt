## Stanford vain in rain at Tempe 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
Tempe, Ariz. — Even the rain didn't help Stanford
this time.
The last time Stanford won a football game — Oct
30,1982, against then No. 1-ranked Washington — it
rained. And the only two times the Cardinal has
defeated Arizona State (in 1978 and 1979), it poured
But Saturday, Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin
watched the rain and his team fall in its Pacific-10
Conference opener.
Arizona State remained undefeated with a 29-11
drubbing of a hapless Stanford team before 53, 79">
wet fans in Sun Devil Stadium.
The setback left the Card with an 0-4 record this
season and was its seventh straight loss dating back
to 1982. ASU, meanwhile, climbed back into the Ros(
Bowl picture, improving its conference record to 1
0-1 and its overall mark to 3-0-1.
Stanford was as unimpressive Saturday night as it
was in its first three tries this year. Again, the ol
fense couldn't get the ball in the end zone mon
than once and, again, the defense was unable to
stop the run.
ASU scored only two touchdowns of its own, bui
the powerful foot of junior place kicker Luis Zen
dejas accounted for five Sun Devil field goals, a Pa<
10 record.
Zendejas had two attempts in the final minute ol
play for his NCAA record-tying sixth three-pointer
but missed them both due to the slippery condition*
on the natural turf field.
The Sun Devils' other offensive weapon was soph
omore tailback Darryl Clack, who rushed for 121
yards on 24 carries, including a 26-yard touchdowr
jaunt in the first quarter.
Defensively, ASU used its gambling blitzing ten
dencies to keep Stanford off balance. The most ef
fective blitzerwas sophomore safety David Fulcher
who was responsible for six tackles, a fumbk
recovery, an interception, two pass break-ups anc
two quarterback sacks.
While Zendejas was the center of media attentior
following the game, Darryl Rogers, his coach, wa 1
the center of a brewing controversy — an alleged at
tempt to run up the score.
Wiggin, visibly angered by Rogers' decisions to al

low Zendejas to go for his sixth field goal with 0:11
and 0:02 remaining, was terse with reporters. "I
want to stay out of that one," he said. "If he
(Rogers) is proud of it, then so be it."
An even angrier Rob Moore was quoted in an
Arizona paper yesterday as saying, "That was
bleeped. That's my comment. I hate everything ASU
stands for. I'd be embarrassed to play for that guy
(Rogers)."
Rogers was all apologies in the post-game inter
view session. "I understand his (Wiggin's) feelings.
I really understand his feelings," he said. "First I
was told it (field goal number six) was going to
break a NCAA record, not tie it. So I feel worse."

'John Paye is going to be a very fine
quarterback. And I do think right
now that he is better than John
Elway was as a freshman/

The first of the controversial three-point tries
came on a fourth-and-three from the Stanford 7.
After Zendejas missed, Paye's first pass was inter
cepted by Fulcher, who returned it to the 20.
Rogers called a time-out with two seconds left and
tried again.
Zendejas' two final field goal tries, however, in no
way affected the game's outcome. The Sun Devils
settled the issue far earlier in the evening, leading
17-3 at halftime and 23-3 in the fourth quarter.
Freshman quarterback John Paye, in his first col
legiate start, avoided the vicious Sun Devil blitz mas
terfully, but was levelled every time he released the
ball. ASU sent as many as eight defenders on its
heralded blitz.
Paye and company were able to move successfully
at times, but still couldn't get the ball in the end
zone. Paye moved the ball from Stanford to Sun
Devil territory on five of the Cardinal's first seven
possesions.
Those five drives all stalled out of Mark Harmon
field goal range, on the ASU 44-, 46-, 48-, 38- and 33-

yard lines. "With the kind of defense they have, its
hard to sustain anything," Wiggin said.
Stanford's only touchdown came in the fourth
quarter in the form of an 80-yard Paye to Emile Har
ry bomb. The Card frosh then made good on a two
point conversion with a pass to freshman halfback
Thomas Henley, who rushed for 71 yards on 14
carries.
Paye, who completed 15-of-38 passes for 281
yards, drew rave reviews from Rogers. "John Paye
is going to be a very fine quarterback," Rogers said.
"And I do think right now that he is better than John
Elway was as a freshman."
Punter Trip Hardin was a savior of sorts for Stan
ford, preventing what could have been an even
more one-sided game. The fifth-year senior punted
10 times for an average of 43.7 yards a kick, most of
which were either near midfield or from deep in
Stanford territory.
His three kicks from the end zone went for 47, 48
and 52 yards, respectively. However, Hardin had
his second punt of the year blocked, a third quarter
incident that led to one of Zendejas' four second
half fielu goals.
The Stanford defense held the Sun Devils score
less for the better part of the first quarter. But
quarterback Todd Hons, the man who last year en
gineered a final minute drive to beat the Card 21-17,
overcame a 1-for-6 passing start to take ASU 80
yards in eight plays for its first score.
Clack capped the drive with his 26-yard burst
threw a huge hole on the left side, running un
touched until Cardinal safety Darrell Grissum
latched on to him at the 5 and got a free ride into the
end zone.
And when it rained for Stanford, it poured. On
the ensuing kick-off, Zendejas, who put six-of-eight
kickoffs out of the end zone, booted it high
deep into the left corner of the field. Stanford's
deep man, Eric Mullins caught the ball over his
shoulder, couldn't keep his balance and went out! of
bounds at the 1. •

Stanford punter Trip Hardin punted 10 times for a 43.7 yard
average in the Cardinal's 29-11 loss to Arizona State Satur
day night.
Nonetheless, despite
Mullins' mistake and center
Kurt losephson's snap over
the head of Paye, who was
in the shot gun formation,
the Stanford defense was
able to keep ASU from
scoring until just over
three minutes remained in
the half.
The Sun Devils took the
ball on their own 20 with
9:52 on the clock and used
6:38 to grind out 62 yards
in 13 plays, 11 of which
were running plays. Gris
sum and middle linebacker
Dave Wyman, who had 13
tackles each, stopped Clack
on third-and-seven from
Stanford's 19, forcing Zen

dejas' tirst field goal, a 35-
yarder that made the score
10-0.
Stanford held the ball for
a mere 1:40 before another
Hardin punt, a 31-yard ef
fort that gave ASU the ball
on the Cardinal 48. It took
Hons exactly one minute to
find Doug Allen in the left
corner of the end zone for
the Devils' second TD and a
17-0 lead.
Stanford had some
fireworks of its own to dis
play before the half's end,
as Paye converted back-to
back 28- and 34-yard pass
plays, the first to freshman
halfback Thomas Henley
and the second to Mike
Tolliver. Mark Harmon
made it 17-3 with just one
tick left on the first-half
clock.

In the second half, ASU
didn't get into the end
zone, but never had to with
Zendejas suited up. Zen
dejas hit field goals of 20,
36, 49 and 52 yards, the lat
ter two after negative
yardage drives by the Sun
Devils.
ASU dominated the
second half time of posses
sion, holding the ball 21:11
to Stanford's 8:49. For the
game, the Sun Devils kept
the football 37:56 and the
ard just 22:04.
Receiver Mike Tolliver
showed why he was the na
tion's top pass-catcher
going into the game, grab
bing six Paye passes for 97
yards. He also ran a
reverse for 24 yards.

Thomas Henley, who rushed for 71 yards on 14
carries.
Paye, who completed 15-of-38 passes for 281
yards, drew rave reviews from Rogers. "John Paye
is going to be a very fine quarterback," Rogers said.
"And I do think right now that he is better than John
Elway was as a freshman."
Punter Trip Hardin was a savior of sorts for Stan
ford, preventing what could have been an even
more one-sided game. The fifth-year senior punted
10 times for an average of 43.7 yards a kick, most of
which were either near midfield or from deep in
Stanford territory.
His three kicks from the end zone went for 47, 48
and 52 yards, respectively. However, Hardin had
his second punt of the year blocked, a third quarter
incident that led to one of Zendejas' four second
half fielu goals.
The Stanford defense held the Sun Devils score
less for the better part of the first quarter. But
quarterback Todd Hons, the man who last year en
gineered a final minute drive to beat the Card 21-17,
overcame a 1-for-6 passing start to take ASU 80
yards in eight plays for its first score.
Clack capped the drive with his 26-yard burst
threw a huge hole on the left side, running un
touched until Cardinal safety Darrell Grissum
latched on to him at the 5 and got a free ride into the
end zone.
And when it rained for Stanford, it poured. On
the ensuing kick-off, Zendejas, who put six-of-eight
kickoffs out of the end zone, booted it high
deep into the left corner of the field. Stanford's
deep man, Eric Mullins caught the ball over his
shoulder, couldn't keep his balance and went out! of
bounds at the 1. •

Stanford punter Trip Hardin punted 10 times for a 43.7 yard
average in the Cardinal's 29-11 loss to Arizona State Satur
day night.
Nonetheless, despite
Mullins' mistake and center
Kurt losephson's snap over
the head of Paye, who was
in the shot gun formation,
the Stanford defense was
able to keep ASU from
scoring until just over
three minutes remained in
the half.
The Sun Devils took the
ball on their own 20 with
9:52 on the clock and used
6:38 to grind out 62 yards
in 13 plays, 11 of which
were running plays. Gris
sum and middle linebacker
Dave Wyman, who had 13
tackles each, stopped Clack
on third-and-seven from
Stanford's 19, forcing Zen

dejas' tirst field goal, a 35-

10-0.
Stanford held the ball for
a mere 1:40 before another
Hardin punt, a 31-yard ef
fort that gave ASU the ball
on the Cardinal 48. It took
Hons exactly one minute to
find Doug Allen in the left
corner of the end zone for
the Devils' second TD and a
17-0 lead.
Stanford had some
fireworks of its own to dis
play before the half's end,
as Paye converted back-to
back 28- and 34-yard pass
plays, the first to freshman
halfback Thomas Henley
and the second to Mike

game, the Sun Devils kept

Tempe, Ariz. — Even the rain didn't help Stanford
this time.
The last time Stanford won a football game — Oct
30,1982, against then No. 1-ranked Washington — it
rained. And the only two times the Cardinal has
defeated Arizona State (in 1978 and 1979), it poured
But Saturday, Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin
watched the rain and his team fall in its Pacific-10
Conference opener.
Arizona State remained undefeated with a 29-11
drubbing of a hapless Stanford team before 53, 79">
wet fans in Sun Devil Stadium.
The setback left the Card with an 0-4 record this
season and was its seventh straight loss dating back
to 1982. ASU, meanwhile, climbed back into the Ros(
Bowl picture, improving its conference record to 1
0-1 and its overall mark to 3-0-1.
Stanford was as unimpressive Saturday night as it
was in its first three tries this year. Again, the ol
fense couldn't get the ball in the end zone mon
than once and, again, the defense was unable to
stop the run.
ASU scored only two touchdowns of its own, bui
the powerful foot of junior place kicker Luis Zen
dejas accounted for five Sun Devil field goals, a Pa<
10 record.
Zendejas had two attempts in the final minute ol
play for his NCAA record-tying sixth three-pointer
but missed them both due to the slippery condition*
on the natural turf field.
The Sun Devils' other offensive weapon was soph
omore tailback Darryl Clack, who rushed for 121
yards on 24 carries, including a 26-yard touchdowr
jaunt in the first quarter.
Defensively, ASU used its gambling blitzing ten
dencies to keep Stanford off balance. The most ef
fective blitzerwas sophomore safety David Fulcher
who was responsible for six tackles, a fumbk
recovery, an interception, two pass break-ups anc
two quarterback sacks.
While Zendejas was the center of media attentior
following the game, Darryl Rogers, his coach, wa 1
the center of a brewing controversy — an alleged at
tempt to run up the score.
Wiggin, visibly angered by Rogers' decisions to al

low Zendejas to go for his sixth field goal with 0:11
and 0:02 remaining, was terse with reporters. "I
want to stay out of that one," he said. "If he
(Rogers) is proud of it, then so be it."
An even angrier Rob Moore was quoted in an
Arizona paper yesterday as saying, "That was
bleeped. That's my comment. I hate everything ASU
stands for. I'd be embarrassed to play for that guy
(Rogers)."
Rogers was all apologies in the post-game inter
view session. "I understand his (Wiggin's) feelings.
I really understand his feelings," he said. "First I
was told it (field goal number six) was going to
break a NCAA record, not tie it. So I feel worse."

'John Paye is going to be a very fine
quarterback. And I do think right
now that he is better than John
Elway was as a freshman/

The first of the controversial three-point tries
came on a fourth-and-three from the Stanford 7.
After Zendejas missed, Paye's first pass was inter
cepted by Fulcher, who returned it to the 20.
Rogers called a time-out with two seconds left and
tried again.
Zendejas' two final field goal tries, however, in no
way affected the game's outcome. The Sun Devils
settled the issue far earlier in the evening, leading
17-3 at halftime and 23-3 in the fourth quarter.
Freshman quarterback John Paye, in his first col
legiate start, avoided the vicious Sun Devil blitz mas
terfully, but was levelled every time he released the
ball. ASU sent as many as eight defenders on its
heralded blitz.
Paye and company were able to move successfully
at times, but still couldn't get the ball in the end
zone. Paye moved the ball from Stanford to Sun
Devil territory on five of the Cardinal's first seven
possesions.
Those five drives all stalled out of Mark Harmon
field goal range, on the ASU 44-, 46-, 48-, 38- and 33-

yard lines. "With the kind of defense they have, its
hard to sustain anything," Wiggin said.
Stanford's only touchdown came in the fourth
quarter in the form of an 80-yard Paye to Emile Har
ry bomb. The Card frosh then made good on a two
point conversion with a pass to freshman halfback
Thomas Henley, who rushed for 71 yards on 14

rained. And the only two times the Cardinal has
defeated Arizona State (in 1978 and 1979), it poured
But Saturday, Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin
watched the rain and his team fall in its Pacific-10
Conference opener.
Arizona State remained undefeated with a 29-11
drubbing of a hapless Stanford team before 53, 79">
wet fans in Sun Devil Stadium.
The setback left the Card with an 0-4 record this
season and was its seventh straight loss dating back
to 1982. ASU, meanwhile, climbed back into the Ros(
Bowl picture, improving its conference record to 1
0-1 and its overall mark to 3-0-1.
Stanford was as unimpressive Saturday night as it
was in its first three tries this year. Again, the ol
fense couldn't get the ball in the end zone mon
than once and, again, the defense was unable to
stop the run.
ASU scored only two touchdowns of its own, bui
the powerful foot of junior place kicker Luis Zen
dejas accounted for five Sun Devil field goals, a Pa<
10 record.
Zendejas had two attempts in the final minute ol
play for his NCAA record-tying sixth three-pointer
but missed them both due to the slippery condition*
on the natural turf field.
The Sun Devils' other offensive weapon was soph
omore tailback Darryl Clack, who rushed for 121
yards on 24 carries, including a 26-yard touchdowr
jaunt in the first quarter.
Defensively, ASU used its gambling blitzing ten
dencies to keep Stanford off balance. The most ef
fective blitzerwas sophomore safety David Fulcher
who was responsible for six tackles, a fumbk
recovery, an interception, two pass break-ups anc
two quarterback sacks.
While Zendejas was the center of media attentior
following the game, Darryl Rogers, his coach, wa 1
the center of a brewing controversy — an alleged at
tempt to run up the score.
Wiggin, visibly angered by Rogers' decisions to al

low Zendejas to go for his sixth field goal with 0:11
and 0:02 remaining, was terse with reporters. "I
want to stay out of that one," he said. "If he
(Rogers) is proud of it, then so be it."
An even angrier Rob Moore was quoted in an
Arizona paper yesterday as saying, "That was
bleeped. That's my comment. I hate everything ASU
stands for. I'd be embarrassed to play for that guy
(Rogers)."
Rogers was all apologies in the post-game inter
view session. "I understand his (Wiggin's) feelings.
I really understand his feelings," he said. "First I
was told it (field goal number six) was going to
break a NCAA record, not tie it. So I feel worse."

'John Paye is going to be a very fine
quarterback. And I do think right
now that he is better than John
Elway was as a freshman/

The first of the controversial three-point tries
came on a fourth-and-three from the Stanford 7.
After Zendejas missed, Paye's first pass was inter
cepted by Fulcher, who returned it to the 20.
Rogers called a time-out with two seconds left and
tried again.
Zendejas' two final field goal tries, however, in no
way affected the game's outcome. The Sun Devils
settled the issue far earlier in the evening, leading
17-3 at halftime and 23-3 in the fourth quarter.
Freshman quarterback John Paye, in his first col
legiate start, avoided the vicious Sun Devil blitz mas
terfully, but was levelled every time he released the
ball. ASU sent as many as eight defenders on its
heralded blitz.
Paye and company were able to move successfully
at times, but still couldn't get the ball in the end
zone. Paye moved the ball from Stanford to Sun
Devil territory on five of the Cardinal's first seven
possesions.
Those five drives all stalled out of Mark Harmon
field goal range, on the ASU 44-, 46-, 48-, 38- and 33-

yard lines. "With the kind of defense they have, its
hard to sustain anything," Wiggin said.
Stanford's only touchdown came in the fourth
quarter in the form of an 80-yard Paye to Emile Har
ry bomb. The Card frosh then made good on a two
point conversion with a pass to freshman halfback
Thomas Henley, who rushed for 71 yards on 14
carries.
Paye, who completed 15-of-38 passes for 281
yards, drew rave reviews from Rogers. "John Paye
is going to be a very fine quarterback," Rogers said.
"And I do think right now that he is better than John
Elway was as a freshman."
Punter Trip Hardin was a savior of sorts for Stan
ford, preventing what could have been an even
more one-sided game. The fifth-year senior punted
10 times for an average of 43.7 yards a kick, most of
which were either near midfield or from deep in
Stanford territory.
His three kicks from the end zone went for 47, 48
and 52 yards, respectively. However, Hardin had
his second punt of the year blocked, a third quarter
incident that led to one of Zendejas' four second
half fielu goals.
The Stanford defense held the Sun Devils score
less for the better part of the first quarter. But
quarterback Todd Hons, the man who last year en
gineered a final minute drive to beat the Card 21-17,
overcame a 1-for-6 passing start to take ASU 80
yards in eight plays for its first score.
Clack capped the drive with his 26-yard burst
threw a huge hole on the left side, running un
touched until Cardinal safety Darrell Grissum
latched on to him at the 5 and got a free ride into the
end zone.
And when it rained for Stanford, it poured. On
the ensuing kick-off, Zendejas, who put six-of-eight
kickoffs out of the end zone, booted it high
deep into the left corner of the field. Stanford's
deep man, Eric Mullins caught the ball over his
shoulder, couldn't keep his balance and went out! of
bounds at the 1. •

Stanford punter Trip Hardin punted 10 times for a 43.7 yard
average in the Cardinal's 29-11 loss to Arizona State Satur
day night.
Nonetheless, despite
Mullins' mistake and center
Kurt losephson's snap over
the head of Paye, who was
in the shot gun formation,
the Stanford defense was
able to keep ASU from
scoring until just over
three minutes remained in
the half.
The Sun Devils took the
ball on their own 20 with
9:52 on the clock and used
6:38 to grind out 62 yards
in 13 plays, 11 of which
were running plays. Gris
sum and middle linebacker
Dave Wyman, who had 13
tackles each, stopped Clack
on third-and-seven from
Stanford's 19, forcing Zen

dejas' tirst field goal, a 35-
yarder that made the score
10-0.
Stanford held the ball for
a mere 1:40 before another
Hardin punt, a 31-yard ef
fort that gave ASU the ball
on the Cardinal 48. It took
Hons exactly one minute to
find Doug Allen in the left
corner of the end zone for
the Devils' second TD and a
17-0 lead.
Stanford had some
fireworks of its own to dis
play before the half's end,
as Paye converted back-to
back 28- and 34-yard pass
plays, the first to freshman
halfback Thomas Henley
and the second to Mike
Tolliver. Mark Harmon
made it 17-3 with just one
tick left on the first-half
clock.

In the second half, ASU
didn't get into the end
zone, but never had to with
Zendejas suited up. Zen
dejas hit field goals of 20,
36, 49 and 52 yards, the lat
ter two after negative
yardage drives by the Sun
Devils.
ASU dominated the
second half time of posses
sion, holding the ball 21:11
to Stanford's 8:49. For the
game, the Sun Devils kept
the football 37:56 and the
ard just 22:04.
Receiver Mike Tolliver
showed why he was the na
tion's top pass-catcher
going into the game, grab
bing six Paye passes for 97
yards. He also ran a
reverse for 24 yards.
