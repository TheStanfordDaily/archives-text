# Zendejas kicks himself into record books

### MARK ZEIGLER 
The Zendejas family, you
might say, gets a kick out of
football.
Arizona State's Luis Zen
dejas sat in the Sun Devils'
locker room following their
29-11 win over Stanford Satur
day night and fielded ques
tions about his Pacific-10 Con
ference record five field goals
in the game.
Earlier that day, Luis' bro
ther, Max, who is Arizona's
field goal man, kicked four.
Asked if Saturday was the
highlight of the Zendejas fam
ily's kicking career, Luis
replied, "I don't know. I
haven't heard what Tony did
yet."
Tony Zendejas, Luis' cousin,
kicks for Nevada-Reno. He
booted three field goals Sat
urday against Idaho State.
Together, Zendejas
(pronounced Zen-day-haas)
feet kicked 12 field goals and
eight extra points for a total of
44 points. All this in one Satur
day.
Zendejas, as in Luis, had
eight total attempts at field
goals against Stanford, but
missed three of them, two of
which were in the final 11
seconds of the game. Had he
connected on six three
pointers, Zendejas would
have tied the NCAA single
game record.
As it was, all he got was a
Pac-10 record and a bitter
controversy. After the game,
Stanford Coach Paul Wiggin
hinted that Arizona State
Coach Darryl Rogers tried to
run up the score by inserting

Zendejas into the line-up with
just seconds left in an already
lopsided game.
Zendejas trotted on the
field for the first of his fourth
quarter misses with 0:11,
lined up on the left hashmark
24 yards from the goal posts.
The kick went wildly left.
But nine seconds later, ASU
had the ball back on the Stan
ford 20 following a David Ful
cher interception. The
stadium clock showed 0:02.
Rogers signaled for a time-out
to ponder the situation.
Rogers made up his mind
and Zendejas, No. 8, jogged
onto the field to the roar of
the rain-soaked Sun Devil fans
and to the rage of the Stan
ford coaching staff. This time,
the kick was from the right
hashmark and a 37-yard at
tempt.
"I was more worried about
slipping than making the field
goal," he said, referring to his
final attempt that fluttered
hopelessly short. "At the
hashmark, you plant and you
slide three or four yards. The
hashes are so wet that you
can't control the ball.
"If I would have kept going
on that hashmark, I would
have kept missing probably,"
he said.
Zendejas saw no reason for
Wiggin and company to get so
upset about the final-second
field goal tries. "We were just
going for a NCAA record. I
apologize. I was going to go
up to him (Wiggin) and say,
'I'm sorry.' "
Kicking five field goals in a
game is only new to Zendejas'

collegiate career. In his final
game at Don Antonio Lugo
High School, Zendejas put five
threw the uprights, scoring all
the points in his team's 15-14
win.
In the game, he booted a 57-
yarder and had a 60-yard at
tempt hit the crossbar and
bounce back on the game's
final play.

At Arizona State, the 5-foot
9, 186-pound |unior holds
school records for the longest
field goal (55 yards), single
season field goals (21), single
season points kicked (93),
career field goals (50) and the
two records he broke again
Saturday night â€” single-game
field goals (5) and single-game
points kicking (17).

Saturday also marked the
fourth time Zendejas has
kicked four or more field
goals in a game, tying a NCAA
record held by former Penn
State and NFL kicker Matt
Bahr and and Clemson's Obed
Arriri. It was his third four
field goal game of this still
young season, in which he has
already booted 13 field goals
in just 17 tries.
Zendejas had his problems
Saturday, however. He had
problems kicking off after a
Sun Devil touchdown had
made it 17-0. Zendejas kicked
off three straight times out of
bounds, since he kept slipping
on the slick natural turf field.
"The official came up to me
(after the third penalty) and
said, 'Let's get this thing
going. We don't have all
night.' "
Since Zendejas is just as ac
curate a kicker as he is a pow
erful one, goofing three
straight kickoffs is not usually
his style. As a kicker, he just
likes to do his job. "If the
coach lets you kick 10 or if he
lets you kick two field goals,
you just have to make what he
let's you kick."
After booming four field
goals against UCLA, Rogers
said of his kicker, "I don't
know how you could find one
any better right now than
Luis. What the guy is is accu
rate."
Well, almost accurate. Zen
dejas missed an extra point in
Arizona State's opener against
Utah State. Before that he had
made 75 in a row.
