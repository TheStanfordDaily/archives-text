Dublin (AP) — Former Stanford student
John McEnroe fought off an upset
stomach yesterday and completed a
record-breaking weekend by leading the
United States to a 4-1 victory over Ireland
in their Davis Cup tennis series.
McEnroe s 9-7, 6-3, 6-3 victory over
Matt Doyle the Irish No. 1, gave the
Americans a decisive 3-1 lead in the best
ot-five series.
In the final match, reduced from five
sets to three, Eliot Teltscher overcame
Sean Sorenson 14-16, 10-8, 8-6 in a four
hour marathon.
The result meant the United States
would remain in the world group, the top
division of the international tennis team
event, while Ireland dropped to the
European qualifying zone for next
season.
McEnroe's victory was his 28th in Davis
Cup singles and his 40th overall in six
years of this event — both U.S. records.
The old records were 27 in singles by Ar
thur Ashe, now the American team cap
tain, and 39 overall, by Vic Sexias.
Two hours before the match, McEnroe
was still in bed with stomach trouble.
"I didn't feel too good at that stage," he
said. "I woke up early, about 7 this mor
ning, and thought I was going to be ill.
"But the doctor gave me something for
it, and I decided to give it a shot. I came
here to play, not to be ill. I felt better as
the match went on."

At first, his service was off target and
he had two break points against him in
the third game. But he fought them off,
and never came within a point of losing
his service again.
McEnroe came through the weekend
with voctories in both his singles matches
and the doubles with Peter Fleming. He
did not lose a service game in any of
them.
Against Doyle, he dropped only 16
points in 18 service games.
Doyle has lived in Menlo Park all his
life, but qualified to play for Ireland be
cause he had an Irish grandfather.
He fought gamely against McEnroe and
it took the winner an hour to break ser

vice for the first time. This was in the Ibth
game, and it gave McEnroe the first set.
"He served pretty well and he kept the
pressure on me," McEnroe said.
Doyle lost his service again once in the
second set and twice in the third.
McEnroe was in some trouble with the
officials for the first time in the three days
of play. After disputing a line call when
Doyle aced him in the third set, McEnroe
walked to the side of the court, kicked a
chair and brandished his racket at British
umpire David Mercer. He was given a
warning.
The sellout crowd of 5800 in the hall of
the Royal Dublin Society cheered
McEnroe even when Ireland had lost the
match.
