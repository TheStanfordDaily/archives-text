49ers 33, Patriots 13
Joe Montana looked a bit foolish when he
tripped and fell in his backfield on two con
secutive plays in the first five minutes. The
rest of the time, he made the New England
Patriots look foolish.
Montana recovered from that stumbling
Start to throw for two touchdowns and 288
yards, and Ray Wersching kicked four field
goals as the San Francisco 49ers rolled to
their fourth consecutive NFL victory 33-13
over the Patriots yesterday.
"We thought we could throw the ball.
We were getting people open," said Mon
tana, who completed 25 of 38 passes for the
49ers. "Our defense was playing well. All
we had to do was keep putting some kind of
points on the board."
"It was a good defensive day for us," said
San Francisco Coach Bill Walsh. "Our
downfield hitting and our pass rush were
good. Offensively, it was not as easy as it
should be."
The 49ers played without injured Wen
dell Tyler, one of the NFL's top rushers,
"but we got our running game anyway,"
said Walsh.
The 49ers ran 85 offensive plays to just 51
for the Patriots and held the ball for 36:49,
compared to 23:11 for New England.
"We never had the ball that much, and
we could not stop Montana," said Patriots
Coach Ron Meyer. "I thought we ran it
semi-adequately, but that was not good
enough. In Montana, you're talking about
one of the best, if not the best, quarter
backs in the league right now."
San Francisco, 4-1, scored on six of its
first eight possessions, to build a 30-6 lead
after the third quarter. The Patriots, 2-3,
went ahead midway through the first per
iod on a 30-yard touchdown pass from
Steve Crogan to Derrick Ramsey, but the
49ers quickly took charge.
After the ensuing kickoff, Montana
moved the 49ers 78 yards in nine plays to an
8-yard scoring strike to Russ Francis.
Wersching's extra point gave San Francisco
a 7-6 lead, and a 2-yard touchdown run by
Jeff Moore made it 14-6 with 8:33 left in the
second quarter.
Wersching then went to work with three
field goals in 5:13. His 45-yarder on the
final play of the first half put the 49ers on
top 17-6. He then connected from 35 yards
out on San Francisco's first series of the
third quarter and from 36 yards on its
second series.
Montana's 13-yard touchdown pass to
Dwight Clark made the score 30-6 late in
the third quarter, before Grogan hooked
up with Stanley Morgan for a 32-yard
touchdown pass play early in the fourth
quarter.

But San Francisco, the NFL's highest
scoring team, got on the scoreboard for its
6th consecutive possession on Wersching's
24-yard field goal.
The 49ers entered the game with the
league's second-most productive offense,
averaging 423.5 yards a game, and churned
out 426 yards against New England.
Redskins 37, Raiders 35
Joe Theismann's third touchdown pass of
the game and second to Joe Washington, a
6-yarder with 33 seconds remaining, rallied
the Washington Redskins to a 37-35 Nation
al Football League victory yesterday over
the previously unbeaten Los Angeles
Raiders.
Theismann rallied the Redskins, 4-1, from
a 35-20 deficit with 7:31 to play, first passing
11 yards to Charlie Brown with 6:15 to play
and putting the Skins in position for Mark
Moseley's 34-yard field goal with 4:28 to go.
Then, after Washington's defense held,
he drove his team 69 yards in just five plays,
the big ones being passes of 26 and 28 yards
to Brown, before finding Washington
diving in the middle of the end zone.
Thiesmann completed 23 of 39 passes for
417 yards in an electrifying game that over
shadowed a similarly remarkable perfor
mance by Jim Plunkett and the Raiders.
Plunkett passed for four touchdowns — a
record-tying 99-yard play to Cliff Branch,
two covering 35 and 22 yards to Calvin
Muhammad and a 2-yarder to Todd Chris
tensen. The Raiders' other touchdown
came on Greg Pruitt's team-record 97-yard
punt return.
The Raiders, who had committed only
seven turnovers in their first four games,
committed six in this one — including three
interceptions and a fumble on their first
four possessions.
The Redskins got 10 points on them as
John Riggins went in from 2 yards out and
Moseley kicked a 28-yard field goal.
Theismann's 5-yard pass to Washington
gave the Skins a 17-7 halftime lead and
Moseley kicked a 29-yard field goal for a 20-
7 margin early in the third quarter before
the Raiders began what seemed to be their
winning charge.
Rams 21, Lions 10
Rookie running back Eric Dickerson, the
National Football League's leading rusher
this season, gained 199 yards and scored
three touchdowns yesterday to power the
Los Angeles Rams to a 21-10 victory over the
Detroit Lions.
Dickerson carried 30 times and scored
on runs of 1 and 8 yards in the second

quarter as the Rams built a 14-3 lead, then
tallied again on a 4-yard burst with 6 and
one-half minutes left in the contest.
The 6-foot-3, 218-pound Dickerson, who
has outstanding speed and also runs with
power, had gained 192 yards on 28 carries
a week ago in Los Angeles' 27-24 loss to the
New York Jets.
The performance against the Lions, in
which he also grabbed three passes for 21
yards, built his five-game rushing total to
645.
The former Southern Methodist Ail-
American, runnerup in the 1982 Heisman
Trophy balloting and the second player
chosen in the last NFL draft, gained 82
yards in the first half and 117 in the second
in the victory over Detroit.
Los Angeles snapped a two-game losing
skid and is now 3-2.
The Lions have now dropped four
straight after winning their 1983 opener.
Detroit played without its star running
back, Billy Sims, who is sidelined with a
broken hand.
The Lions took their only lead of the
game when Eddie Murray kicked a 51-yard
field goal to cap a 45-yard march with the
opening kickoff.
Dickerson put the Rams ahead to stay
when he scored on his 8-yard run after
6:31 of the second quarter. Five minutes
later, he scored again on a 1-yard burst to
build the pad to 14-3.
The Lions made it 14-10 when quarter
back Eric Hippie threw a 5-yard touchdown
pass to Ulysses Norris with 29 seconds
remaining in the first half.
Hippie provided most of the Lions' of
fense, completing 19 of 41 throws for 202
yards.
Chargers 41, Giants 34
Chuck Muncie ran for his third touch
down of the game on a 34-yard sprint down
the sideline with 4:32 to play and lifted the
San Diego Chargers to a 41-34 NFL victory
yesterday over the New York Giants.
Giants quarterback Scott Brunner, who
31 of 51 passes for 395 yards and three

touchdowns, fumbled the ball at San
Diego's 12-yard line with 52 seconds to
play. Brunner was trying to pass on third
down, but the ball slipped out of his hand
and was recovered by rookie linebacker
Billy Ray Smith. The Chargers then ran out
the clock.
Muncie, a running back who also scored
on runs of 1 and 2 yards, sparked the
Chargers after quarterback Dan Fouts left
the game midway through the third quarter
with a bruised deltoid muscle in his right
shoulder. Muncie's 2-yard run gave the
Chargers a 34-24 lead in the third quarter.
Fouts had thrown first-half touchdown
passes to Charlie Joiner and Kellen
Winslow. Fouts was replaced by Ed Luther,
who directed the two drives that ended in
Muncie touchdowns.
The Giants, who trailed by 17 points in
the first half, tied the score 34-34 on AN
Haji-Sheikh's 37-yard field goal with 6:53 to
play in the fourth quarter.
Haji-Sheikh's field goal was set up by
Beasley Reece's interception of a Luther
pass.
New York had tied the score 27-27 on
Haji-Sheikh's 29-yard field goal with 6:58
left in the third quarter. But the Giants
elected to nullify the points after a rough
ing the holder penalty gave them a first
down on San Diego's 7-yard line.
Cowboys 37, Vikings 24
Dallas cornerback Ron Fellows' 58-yard
touchdown run with an interception
helped make the Cowboys the only un
beaten team in the National Football League
yesterday.
Dallas, developing a reputation as the
Comeback Cowboys, spotted Minnesota a
24-12 halftime lead, then rallied for a 37-24
halftime victory at Minneapolis. The Cow
boys are 5-0, while the Vikings dropped to
3-2.
Minnesota gained its 11-point halftime
lead on the strength of two touchdown
passes from Steve Dils to Sammy White.
Dallas cut the lead to 24-20 on Ron
Springs' 5-yard touchdown run, a score
that was set up by Ron Hill's 37-yard punt
return. Then came Fellows' touchdown
return of the interception and an insur
ance score on a 12-yard TD pass from Dan
ny White to Drew Pearson to climax an 84-
yard drive led by Tony Dorsett, who
rushed for 141 yards.
Green Bay 55, Buccaneers 10
At Green Bay, Wisconsin, the Packers
had a league-record 49-point performance
in the first half en route to a 55-14 win over
Tampa Bay, now 0-5, which made the win

ners' record 3-2. Among the Packers first
half touchdowns were a 90-yard punt
return by Phillip Epps, Jessie Clark's score
on a 75-yard pass-run play and Mike
Douglas' 35-yard run with a fumble.
Saints 17, Dolphins 7
Miami stumbled in a bid to go 4-1 when
Ken Stabler passed for one touchdown and
Wayne Wilson, subbing for injured George
Rogers, rushed for 161 yards on 13 carries
as the Saints beat the Dolphins 17-7 at New
Orleans. Each club is now 3-2.
Seahawks 24, Browns 9
Cleveland also dropped to 3-2, when the
Browns' three-game winning streak was
snapped 24-9 by the Seattle Seahawks, 3-2,
at Cleveland. Rookie Curt Warner had two
short touchdown runs for the Seahawks,
who capitalized on three Cleveland tur
novers.
Colts 34, Bengals 31
Ken Anderson threw for four touch
downs for the Bengals, 1-4, at Cincinnati,
but Curtis Dickey's 3-yard run in the fourth
quarter won it for the Colts, 3-2, who had
moved to within winning range on field
goals of 29 and 53 yards by Raul Allegre.
Steelers 17, Oilers 10
With the Steelers, 3-2, trailing 10-7
against the Oilers, 0-5, at Pittsburgh, quar
terback Cliff Stoudt, who had been booed
roundly, combined with Walter
Abercrombie on a 51-yard pass-and-run

play. It was Pittsburgh's second victory
over Houston this season.
Eagles 28, Falcons 24
Philadelphia pulled out its victory over
the Falcons at Atlanta when Ron Jaworski
combined with Mike Quick for a touch
down on a 53-yard pass-and-run with 1:45
