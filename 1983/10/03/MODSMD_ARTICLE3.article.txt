# McCloskey course
## ASSU report defends GPB actions 
### BRYCE LEE 
Six students here have responded to a report
criticizing the ASSU's handling of Guest Prof. Paul
"Pete" McCloskey's spring quarter political science
course, defending the actions of the Council of Presi
dents (COP) and the Guest Professorship Bureau (GPB)
during the controversy here last spring.
The students, ASSU senators Jim McGrath, Roc
Blumenthal and Doug Puffert, Senate Chair Jug
Jagadish and COP members Su Uhland and Karol Wat
son, wrote in their report that the "COP and the GPB
neither interfered with the contents of the course
reading list" after the course had been given final ap
proval nor threatened to decrease McCloskey's salary.
In a July 27 report, a Political Science Department
committee claimed the GPB and the ASSU "seriously
misunderstood the permissible limits of student action
in instructional matters in the University" and "went
beyond the traditional limits of student participation in
instructional matters and in the process abridged aca
demic freedom."

Following the Political Science Department review of
the controversy, Provost Albert Hastorf formally
apologized to McC'oskey and warned that academic
credit would not be granted for future guest professor
classes unless the GPB bylaws are changed.
The controversy began last winter quarter with
arguments over whether McCloskey would use his
class as a forum for promoting his views on Israel.
Later GPB Chairman Seth Linfield made efforts to con
trol portions of McCloskey's reading list and choice of
guest lecturers.
The Political Science Department committee was
formed to investigate the controversy. Further prob
lems arose when Hastorf recommended that the GPB
pay McCloskey more money to make up for an appar
ent discrepancy between his actual salary and what was
promised him for teaching the course.
"Essentially, the purpose of the report is to clarify
some factual errors in the political science report and
to protest the method of investigation," said Jug
