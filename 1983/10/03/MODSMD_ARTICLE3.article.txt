# McCloskey course
## ASSU report defends GPB actions 
### BRYCE LEE 
Six students here have responded to a report
criticizing the ASSU's handling of Guest Prof. Paul
"Pete" McCloskey's spring quarter political science
course, defending the actions of the Council of Presi
dents (COP) and the Guest Professorship Bureau (GPB)
during the controversy here last spring.
The students, ASSU senators Jim McGrath, Roc
Blumenthal and Doug Puffert, Senate Chair Jug
Jagadish and COP members Su Uhland and Karol Wat
son, wrote in their report that the "COP and the GPB
neither interfered with the contents of the course
reading list" after the course had been given final ap
proval nor threatened to decrease McCloskey's salary.
In a July 27 report, a Political Science Department
committee claimed the GPB and the ASSU "seriously
misunderstood the permissible limits of student action
in instructional matters in the University" and "went
beyond the traditional limits of student participation in
instructional matters and in the process abridged aca
demic freedom."

Following the Political Science Department review of
the controversy, Provost Albert Hastorf formally
apologized to McC'oskey and warned that academic
credit would not be granted for future guest professor
classes unless the GPB bylaws are changed.
The controversy began last winter quarter with
arguments over whether McCloskey would use his
class as a forum for promoting his views on Israel.
Later GPB Chairman Seth Linfield made efforts to con
trol portions of McCloskey's reading list and choice of
guest lecturers.
The Political Science Department committee was
formed to investigate the controversy. Further prob
lems arose when Hastorf recommended that the GPB
pay McCloskey more money to make up for an appar
ent discrepancy between his actual salary and what was
promised him for teaching the course.
"Essentially, the purpose of the report is to clarify
some factual errors in the political science report and
to protest the method of investigation," said Jug
Jagadish, one of the six aut
hors and chairman of the
ASSU Senate.
"The GPB never demanded'
various modifications to the
course readings. Rather Mc-
Closkey made various modifi
cations without consulting the
GPB/' said the student report,
which went on to say that the
"relationship between the
parties was on the whole a
cooperative one."
According to the students,
the investigative techniques
employed by the faculty com
mittee were at times unsound
and"the manner in which the

committee went about the
business of collecting facts
gives rise to questions about
the impartiality of its inquiry."
Jagadish said, "By issuing
our report, we are trying to
shift the emphasis from aca
demic freedom to that of aca
demic integrity, which is the
real issue ....
"In our report we did not
explicitly say that McCloskey's
(academic freedom) was not
abridged in the manner that
the report said it was, but we
feel that the University
guidelines simply do not ade
quately cover the situation we
are in."
Furthermore, the students
argue that the entire question
of academic freedom does not
apply when the instructor

changes the entire focus of
the class.
"The genuine concern by
the CPB was that the course
was veering away from con
gressional decision-making
and becoming a course on
American foreign policy," the
students wrote.
"The academic freedom of
an instructor simply does not
extend to converting an Eco
nomics 1 class into a Physics 51
class."
