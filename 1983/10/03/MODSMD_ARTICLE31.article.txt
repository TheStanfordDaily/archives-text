# Women third in tourney
## 
### 
The Stanford women's soccer team kicked
off its first official varsity season last
weekend with a trip to compete in the Na
tional Women's College Budweiser Tourna
ment. The tournament was the Cardinal's
first opportunity to test any team east of
Colorado.
Stanford passed easily through the first
round of the tournament, handing
Maryville College a resounding 13-0 defeat.
Goalkeeper Helen Norton and the Stanford
defense saw little action during the game.
Players Betsy Swan, Lisa Schaeffer and Sue
Moore all contributed two goals apiece to
the victory.
In the second match, Stanford faced
defending tournament champions Univer
sity of Missouri at St. Louis, the team that
placed fourth in last year's NCAA tourna
ment. Stanford pulled ahead in the first half
with an unassisted goal by Sue Moore, but
UMSL evened the score early in the second
half, capitalizing on a free kick from just
outside the 18-yard line.

Stanford's subsequent scoring attempts
were repeatedly frustrated by the quick and
effective UMSL defense. Later in the second
half, an UMSL striker flicked in a ball from a
corner kick giving UMSL a 2-1 victory.
UMSL went on to take first in the tourna
ment.
Stanford regrouped for the consolation
game, shutting out Southern Illinois Univer
sity 2-0 to give Stanford an overall standing
of third place in the field of 10 teams. The
aggressive play of the Stanford midfield
halted SlUs attacks at an early stage, and
sweeper Carol Berryman quickly cut off the
few balls that passed beyond the midfield.
Amy Geisse scored Stanford's first goal
early in the game. Sue Moore put in the
finishing goal on an assist from Geisse. For
wards Sarah MacPherson and Sue Moore
were named to the All-Tournament squad.
In league play, Stanford stands 1-0 after a
first game victorv of 4-1 over University of
Santa Claru Stanford takes on prime com
petitor UC-Berkeley this Saturday at Cal.
