# Men booters halt losing streak

### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
Despite losing two previous
games along with their high
scorer Angel Vasquez, the
Stanford's men soccer team
bounced back to take an im
portant 2-1 win over Cal State
Fullerton Friday.
This victory gives Stanford a
5-2-1 record for the year. But,
more importantly, it proves
the Cardinal has the depth
and ability to cover the loss of
Vasquez.
With Coach Nelson Lodge's
new system of four
midfielders, Stanford got 11
shots on goal from eight dif
ferent players. In the last
game, only three players got
decent shots off. The system
also allowed certain players to
take on new roles.
For example, Walter
Kingson, who leads the team
in assists got his first goal of
the season. Similarly, Phil
Bronson got his first goal of
the year.
Kingson scored in the first
two minutes of the game.
"We had a new system
where the forwards work on
defense up front," Kingson
said. ''That way they
(Fullerton) had to go the
whole field to score. On my
goal, Todd (Rafalovich) stole it
from their defender and
passed it to me. )orge
(Titinger) let it go for me. His
fake took two men off me
which allowed for the score."
Further evidence of Lodge's
role reversal is apparent in
the play of Titinger. Last year
he was the Cardinal's leading
scorer and is second in that
category this year. However,
in Friday's game, he passed off
with perfection and got assists
on the two goals.
Since Stanford's style of
play has changed, more
players have become in
volved. But this also forces
Lodge to substitute more of
ten.
"It's important to get as
many people in the game as
possible," said Lodge. "We
have good depth. Why not use
it?"
Bronson, who scored on
the second goal, said, "Lodge
played a lot of people which
won the game for us ... I felt
fresh the whole game."
Stanford also worked bet
ter as a team. It seemed that
more players were looking to

set up an open man to score
rather than force a futile shot
themselves.
On the other side of the
field, Fullerton lacked this
kind of unity. In fact, the times
they came closest to scoring
were on solo breakaways by
Fullerton players Marty Blair
and Glenn Argerent. But
these same two players also
swore at each other and even
pushed each other after a
miscue. When asked about
this skirmish, Blair replied,
"Whenever we yell at each

other, it's usually con
structive.
Fullerton's lack of communi
cation showed on the second
goal. "The defender got
confused and the goalie was
out of position," explained
Bronson. "I faked to the left,
the goalie fell for it and the
goal was wide open."
"We gave it away in the first
half," commented Fullerton's
Blair. "Definitely our best
effort in a long time," Kingson
said. "We'll get better but this
was an important one."

In today's 1 p.m. game at the
Harry Malone field, Stanford
must face San Diego State.
Lodge sums up Stanford's,
game plan.
"Basically to improve what
we're doing," he said. "We
have a tougher midfield but
San Diego was ranked nation
ally last year. I expect them to
be somewhat like (University
of Nevada Los Vegas)."
UNLV was one of Stanford's
toughest games but perhaps*
with the Cardinal new team"
style of play, Stanford will put
more shots on goal.
