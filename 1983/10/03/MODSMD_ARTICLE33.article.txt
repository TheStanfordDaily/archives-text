# Spikers sweep Arizona teams

### TOM MOORE 
Displaying the sharp, ag
gressive style that has lifted
it to the country's No. 3
ranking, the Stanford wo
men's volleyball team
blitzed Arizona State in
Tempe Friday night 3-1 and
Arizona in Tucson a day
later 3-0.
The victories upped
Stanford's overall record
to 6-2 and conference mark
to 2-0, good for first place
in the WCAA.
Though the No. 9 rated
ASU team was considered
another tough test for the
Cardinal spikers, they
demolished the Sun Devils
in four games: 15-2, 12-15,
15-6 and 15-6.
"Arizona State's a good
team," said assistant coach
Don Shaw, "but we've
been playing pretty well. It
was a solid effort."
The match in Tempe was
played in the small, hot
Physical Education East
Building before 454 vocal
Sun Devil fans, but Shaw
said the heat was not a fac
tor for the physically fit
Card spikers.
While the Sun Devils are
a much taller team, Stan
ford used its disciplined
ball control to its advan
tage.
"We're the smaller team
out there," Shaw said. "We
try to be as organized as
we can and play smart."
Against the Sun Devils,
the Card had an impressive

.387 hitting percentage, in
cluding an astounding .500
percentage in the third
game. ASU had a hitting
percentage of just .133 for
the four games.
Kim Oden led the Stan
ford attack with nine kills,
while Kari Rush and Deidra
Dvorak had eight apiece.
Arizona State's Tammy
Webb had a whopping 17
kills in the losing effort,
which dropped the Sun
Devils to 3-6 overall and 0-3
in the WCAA.
Buoyed by their win in
Tempe, the women spikers
traveled Saturday to Tuc
son to combat the Arizona
Wildcats. The Cardinal
played sluggishly in the
first game, falling behind
early 0-7, but roared back
to take the game en route
to a 15-9,15-7,15-12 sweep.
"Sure it (the match) was
a bit of a letdown after
beating ASU," Shaw com
mented after the Arizona
contest, "but our team
pulled together and came
back."
The Cardinal squad ap
pears to be in a favorable
position at this point in the
season. With only two
losses, both to top-ranked
University of Hawaii team,
the women spikers' record
stands at 6-2.
The team travels to
Southern California to take
on Long Beach State and
Cal State Fullerton this
weekend.
