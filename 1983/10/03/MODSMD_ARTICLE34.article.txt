# Card mediocre in NorCal water polo tourney
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
It is not often that a Stanford
water polo team wins only
three games in five tries. But
that is exactly what happened
when the Cardinal and UC-
Berkeley entertained a dozen
other clubs in the two-day
NorCal Tournament Friday
and Saturday. California
copped the tournament's
mythical title by sweeping five
games without a loss.
The results left the 1983
Cardinal squad with six losses -
more than any of Head Coach
Dante Dettamanti's previous
eight teams-and a 5-6-1 season
mark.
It all began innocently
enough on Friday morning as
Stanford blasted UC-San
Diego 14-2 behind sophomore
Chris Woolfolk's four goals
and then raced to a 12-6 vic
tory over the Air Force
Academy as another sopho
more, Marvin Mouchawar,
pumped in four more goals.
In similar fashion the young
Cardinal club, sporting five
freshman starters, belied
their inexperience by syste
matically building a 7-5 cus
hion over No. 10 ranked
Loyola of Chicago with 2:49
remaining in the contest.
But just as quickly as some
ominous clouds rolled in over
De Guerre pool, Loyola
struck back with two goals to
send the game into sudden
death overtime.
As lightening flashed over
head and driving rain sent
spectators fleeing for cover,
Loyola ended the drama when
a shot whistled by a shocked
Steve Moyer at 3:11 into the
second overtime.
"I'm really disappointed,"
snapped a visibly disturbed
Dettamanti, "We never lose to
a team outside of California."
Even the improvement of

the Card's host nf freshmen
and sophomores seemed to be
overshadowed by the fourth
quarter collapse.
"We had a 7-5 lead with 2:30
to go — you ought to be able to
protect it," Dettamanti said. "I
just can't put my finger on it.
We'rp not fouling so we aren't
giving up goals 6-on-5. Teams
are just coming down and
scoring on us."
Maybe a good night of sleep
helped as senior goalie Martin
Fisher blanked Fresno State
through two periods and a
balanced scoring attack
scored five first halt goals en
route to a 7-3 win.
But the big test came on Sat
urday afternoon against No. 3
ranked UC-Santa Barbara, a
game Dettamanti saw as a po
tential stepping stone to the
national championships in No
vember.
Stanford looked sharp — es
pecially defensively-through a
scoreless first period. But a
bad outlet pass by junior
goalie Steve Moyer led to one
goal and a long desperation
shot by UCSB slipped by a
puzzled Moyer just as the 35-
second clock sounded. That
gave UCSB a 4-1 bulge at
halftime.
Fisher entered the net in
the second half, but Santa Bar
bara used its size offensively
and the spectacular play of
goalie Andy Byrnes defensive
ly to build a 7-1 lead.
"Their goalie just played a
super game," commented an
impressed Dettamanti. "That's
the best game I've seen a
goalie play this year. And he
played right here in our sum
mer league a few years back.
Sometimes those things come
back to haunt you."
