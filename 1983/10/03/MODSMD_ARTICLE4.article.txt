Gemayel calls emergency meeting
Beirut, Lebanon — President Amin Gemayel, con
cerned that opposition leader Walid lumblatt might
be trying to create a Druze mini-state that could
lead to the partitioning of Lebanon, held emergency
meetings with key advisers yesterday to examine
Jumblatt's creation of a new civil authority in the
Shouf Mountains, traditional homeland of the
Druze.
After the meetings, Farouk Jaber, a political ad
viser to the president, told reporters that Syria is
using Jumblatt, whose militia it supported during
the recently ended Lebanese fighting, as a tool for
the division of Lebanon into cantons, or separate
states.

"I believe there is an attempt to partition Lebanon
on a canton basis," Jaber said. "The action taken by
Mr. Jumblatt falls in the long-term strategy of the
Syrian government to extend its hegemony over
parts of Lebanon."
The same fear was expressed in the Beirut press.
But Jumblatt, who on Saturday announced crea
tion of a "Peoples Authority for Civil Administra
tion" in the Shouf, declared yesterday that his
movie is "not a step towards partition.
"It is merely a question of organizing the lives of
the (local Druze) population and bringing them aid,
nothing more," Jumblatt insisted, speaking at a cer
emony in Hammana, about 15 miles northeast of
Beirut.
The administration, he said, would deal with
pressing social and economic matters in the absence
of a strong central government. He said it would be
responsible "in exceptional circumstances" for run
ning civilian business and could turn itself into a
"pressure group," acting on the official administra
tion.
Jumblatt, who is head of the opposition Progres
sive Socialist Party as wel as the maximum chieftain
of the Druze, added that the administration would
consist of a general congress, people's committees
from towns and villages, a central committee re
sponsible for planning and an eight-member admin
istrative body to apply policies.
lumblatt's Saturday announcement, made in the
mountain village of Beit Ed Dine, avoided using the
word government, calling his new entity an author
ity and adding that it was "for purely organizational
matters."
However, the Gemayel government obviously saw
it as more than that. State-run Beirut Radio said that
lumblatt's move points "to a secessionist trend" and
proclaimed that the government "will launch a large
scale political offensive to take the steps necessarv
for confronting this development as well as similar
moves, to spare the country the danger of parti
tion."
Salvadoran rightists fight back
San Salvador, El Salvador — Far-right death squads
re-emerging from the shadows of Salvadoran
politics have launched a new terror campaign
against the leftist opposition here, claiming respon
sibility for a spate of murders and bombings and
warning of more "exterminations" to come.
The publicized vigilante attacks reflect
heightened tension here, mainly over faltering go
vernment attempts to begin a dialogue with rebel
leaders and a crucial Constituent Assembly debate
over a U.S.-promoted agrarian reform program bit
terly resented by El Salvador's landowners.
They come at a time when the Salvadoran political
right, led by former Major Roberto D'Aubuisson's
Nationalist Republican Alliance, no longer enjoys an
assured Constituent Assembly majority and
D'Aubuisson himself is trying to moderate his image
in preparation for presidential elections. As a

result, the country's extreme right has found its
above-ground tools of powers dulled.
For the first time in El Salvador's almost four-year
old civil war, the death squads also appear to have a
clandestine publicity arm, Radio Sovereignty, which
gives expression to the radically rightwing senti
ments thought to motivate their abductions, bom
bings and killings. Radio Sovereignty, which calls
itself "the voice of a people struggling against the
Marxist international," broadcasts in short wave
four times a day with denunciations of Salvadoran
guerrillas and the professors and labor activists
who it says are promoting their cause.
Rightist death squads are thought by U.S.
diplomats to contain members of security forces
free-lancing alongside politically connected offi
cers. They have functioned with varying ferocity
throughout the struggle here.
British Laborites elect new leader
London — The opposition Labor Party elected new
leadership yesterday in a move aimed at bolstering
its position for an eventual challenge to Prime Mini
ster Margaret Thatcher for control of the govern
ment of Britain.
At its annual conference at Brighton, Labor
picked as its new leader Neil Kinnock, 41, a member
of the party's left wing and an articulate, charismatic
Welshman.
Kinnock replaces Michael Foot, who led the party
to its greatest defeat in modern times in the general
election of last spring, won overwhelmingly by
Thatcher's Conservative Party.
As its new deputy leader, Labor chose Roy Mat
tersley, 50, a veteran politician of the party's center
right, who had run against Kinnock for the top post.
After the party elections, some political observers
in Brighton began calling the Kinnock-Mattersley
team a "dream ticket."
That was meant to suggest that with a left-winger
in Kinnock — who seems to be moving toward the
right — and a right-winger like Mattersley — who is
moving leftward — the Labor Party would have ener
getic Nos. 1 and 2 likely to appeal to the broad mass
of British voters.
Under a complex system of balloting, that includes
the British trade unions, Labor members of Parlia
ment, and grass roots constituency parties, Kinnock
was elected with 71 percent of the vote compared to
Mattersley's 19 percent in the leadership contest.
Two minor candidates shared the remaining 10 per
cent of the ballots.

Reagan shuns blame for recession
Washington — Thirteen months before election day,
President Reagan and his Treasury secretary are
shunning responsibility for the recession that sent
unemployment soaring last year and for deficits that
are more than three times those of the Carter ad
ministration.
He and Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, in a
recent economic rewriting, are also denying what
most economists and many of Reagan's own officials
have assumed as facts:
That a relatively severe recession arrived six
months after the new president took office in 1981.
And that high interest rates, due largely to the
possibility of ever-growing federal budget deficits,
are the biggest threat to the current recovery from
that recession.
With the denials comes a clearly implied warning
to Democratic opponents: You can assume no fact
in criticizing the president's economic performance
during the coming campaign — if he decides to seek a
second term. As muddy as the waters of economics
are for the average voter, the president and his aide
are adding a little extra goo.
The president, for his part, is being subtle about
it.
In a low-key interview shown on television last
week, he told talk-show host Merv Griffin, "there
was a recession when we came" into office. He
didn't say that to a reporter who might have chal
lenged it. And he didn't say it as if he were arguing
one side of a controversial matter. He just slipped it
in for millions of Americans to hear.
But when Reagan took office the economy was
racing ahead. The government figures, for the
record, show real gross national product surging at
an annual rate of 9 percent for the first three
months of 1981, the fastest in three years.
Democrats race on opposite paths
Washington — Walter Mondale's Dream Week, a
production months in the making, treated America
to the year's most striking demonstration of how the
two Democratic front-runners are racing in oppo
site directions toward the presidency.
And it was the week that laid bare dramatic differ
ences in strategies: former Vice-President Mondale
mastered the machinery of traditional Democratic
politics, while Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) basked in
consolation and even comfort at the message and

imagery that reached the public.
Mondale's week was everything his strategists
had hoped and politicked for during the last year
and was the key to the nomination, they believe. In
Hollywood, Fla., Saturday, he swept the endorse
ment of the AFL-CIO board, in Washington he did
the same with the National Education Association,
and in Maine he trounced the field in a heavily con
tested party straw poll.
Vet Mondale's Dream Week began with Glenn
looming large on the newsstands. Newsweek maga
zine devoted its cover and an extraordinary 13 up
front pages to reports about Glenn and The Right
Stuff, the movie that depicts the heroics of
America's first seven astronauts even as one is
trying to capture the nation's hearts, minds and
votes.
That fits into Glenn's master plan. For on Oct. 15,
eve of the movie's glittering Kennedy Genter
premiere, the Glenn campaign is to launch itself into
the living rooms of an estimated 17 million people
with a five-minute political commercial spectacular
on prime time at 8:55 p.m. over the CBS network.
The plan is to build on Glenn's fame as one of the
original Mercury astronauts by laying out a theme
and platform for his campaign, according to a senior
Glenn official.
For the prime-time slot and the hope of adding
some substance to its candidate's celebrity luster,
the Glenn camp will spend less than $50,000.
But Glenn's strategists say they have found a
pleasant spell of relief in the way television pre
sented the results of Mondale's Dream Week to
viewers Saturday night.
CBS correspondent Bruce Morton followed the
report of the AFL-CIO decision with a lengthy
presentation of a poll, casting it in terms that raised
doubt about the endorsement's value.
Turning to the Maine results, he told viewers:
"As for the straw poll, well, if Mondale had lost,
everyone would have said it was a defeat. But he
won, so everyone can forget about it."
Today's weather
Sunny. Highs in the 70s to near 80. Tonight and
Tuesday: Mostly fair except patchy low clouds near
the ocean night and morning. Lows in the 50s and
highs in the upper 60s to mid-80s.

lumblatt's Saturday announcement, made in the

Salvadoran rightists fight back
San Salvador, El Salvador — Far-right death squads
re-emerging from the shadows of Salvadoran
politics have launched a new terror campaign
against the leftist opposition here, claiming respon
sibility for a spate of murders and bombings and
warning of more "exterminations" to come.
The publicized vigilante attacks reflect
heightened tension here, mainly over faltering go
vernment attempts to begin a dialogue with rebel
leaders and a crucial Constituent Assembly debate
over a U.S.-promoted agrarian reform program bit
terly resented by El Salvador's landowners.
They come at a time when the Salvadoran political
right, led by former Major Roberto D'Aubuisson's
Nationalist Republican Alliance, no longer enjoys an
assured Constituent Assembly majority and
D'Aubuisson himself is trying to moderate his image
in preparation for presidential elections. As a

result, the country's extreme right has found its
above-ground tools of powers dulled.
For the first time in El Salvador's almost four-year
old civil war, the death squads also appear to have a
clandestine publicity arm, Radio Sovereignty, which
gives expression to the radically rightwing senti
ments thought to motivate their abductions, bom
bings and killings. Radio Sovereignty, which calls
itself "the voice of a people struggling against the
Marxist international," broadcasts in short wave
four times a day with denunciations of Salvadoran
guerrillas and the professors and labor activists
who it says are promoting their cause.
Rightist death squads are thought by U.S.
diplomats to contain members of security forces
free-lancing alongside politically connected offi
cers. They have functioned with varying ferocity
throughout the struggle here.
British Laborites elect new leader
London — The opposition Labor Party elected new
leadership yesterday in a move aimed at bolstering
its position for an eventual challenge to Prime Mini
ster Margaret Thatcher for control of the govern
ment of Britain.
At its annual conference at Brighton, Labor
picked as its new leader Neil Kinnock, 41, a member
of the party's left wing and an articulate, charismatic
Welshman.
Kinnock replaces Michael Foot, who led the party
to its greatest defeat in modern times in the general
election of last spring, won overwhelmingly by
Thatcher's Conservative Party.
As its new deputy leader, Labor chose Roy Mat
tersley, 50, a veteran politician of the party's center
right, who had run against Kinnock for the top post.
After the party elections, some political observers
in Brighton began calling the Kinnock-Mattersley
team a "dream ticket."
That was meant to suggest that with a left-winger
in Kinnock — who seems to be moving toward the
right — and a right-winger like Mattersley — who is
moving leftward — the Labor Party would have ener
getic Nos. 1 and 2 likely to appeal to the broad mass
of British voters.
Under a complex system of balloting, that includes
the British trade unions, Labor members of Parlia
ment, and grass roots constituency parties, Kinnock
was elected with 71 percent of the vote compared to
Mattersley's 19 percent in the leadership contest.
Two minor candidates shared the remaining 10 per
cent of the ballots.

Reagan shuns blame for recession
Washington — Thirteen months before election day,
President Reagan and his Treasury secretary are
shunning responsibility for the recession that sent
unemployment soaring last year and for deficits that
are more than three times those of the Carter ad
ministration.
He and Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, in a
recent economic rewriting, are also denying what
most economists and many of Reagan's own officials
have assumed as facts:
That a relatively severe recession arrived six
months after the new president took office in 1981.
And that high interest rates, due largely to the
possibility of ever-growing federal budget deficits,
are the biggest threat to the current recovery from
that recession.
With the denials comes a clearly implied warning
to Democratic opponents: You can assume no fact
in criticizing the president's economic performance
during the coming campaign — if he decides to seek a
second term. As muddy as the waters of economics
are for the average voter, the president and his aide
are adding a little extra goo.
The president, for his part, is being subtle about
it.
In a low-key interview shown on television last
week, he told talk-show host Merv Griffin, "there
was a recession when we came" into office. He
didn't say that to a reporter who might have chal
lenged it. And he didn't say it as if he were arguing
one side of a controversial matter. He just slipped it
in for millions of Americans to hear.
But when Reagan took office the economy was
racing ahead. The government figures, for the
record, show real gross national product surging at
an annual rate of 9 percent for the first three
months of 1981, the fastest in three years.
Democrats race on opposite paths
Washington — Walter Mondale's Dream Week, a
production months in the making, treated America
to the year's most striking demonstration of how the
two Democratic front-runners are racing in oppo
site directions toward the presidency.
And it was the week that laid bare dramatic differ
ences in strategies: former Vice-President Mondale
mastered the machinery of traditional Democratic
politics, while Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) basked in
consolation and even comfort at the message and

imagery that reached the public.
Mondale's week was everything his strategists
had hoped and politicked for during the last year
and was the key to the nomination, they believe. In
Hollywood, Fla., Saturday, he swept the endorse
ment of the AFL-CIO board, in Washington he did
the same with the National Education Association,
and in Maine he trounced the field in a heavily con
tested party straw poll.
Vet Mondale's Dream Week began with Glenn
looming large on the newsstands. Newsweek maga
zine devoted its cover and an extraordinary 13 up
front pages to reports about Glenn and The Right
Stuff, the movie that depicts the heroics of
America's first seven astronauts even as one is
trying to capture the nation's hearts, minds and
votes.
That fits into Glenn's master plan. For on Oct. 15,
eve of the movie's glittering Kennedy Genter
premiere, the Glenn campaign is to launch itself into
the living rooms of an estimated 17 million people
with a five-minute political commercial spectacular
on prime time at 8:55 p.m. over the CBS network.
The plan is to build on Glenn's fame as one of the
original Mercury astronauts by laying out a theme
and platform for his campaign, according to a senior
Glenn official.
For the prime-time slot and the hope of adding
some substance to its candidate's celebrity luster,
the Glenn camp will spend less than $50,000.
But Glenn's strategists say they have found a
pleasant spell of relief in the way television pre
sented the results of Mondale's Dream Week to
viewers Saturday night.
CBS correspondent Bruce Morton followed the
report of the AFL-CIO decision with a lengthy
presentation of a poll, casting it in terms that raised
doubt about the endorsement's value.
Turning to the Maine results, he told viewers:
"As for the straw poll, well, if Mondale had lost,
everyone would have said it was a defeat. But he
won, so everyone can forget about it."
Today's weather
Sunny. Highs in the 70s to near 80. Tonight and
Tuesday: Mostly fair except patchy low clouds near
the ocean night and morning. Lows in the 50s and
highs in the upper 60s to mid-80s.

Gemayel calls emergency meeting
Beirut, Lebanon — President Amin Gemayel, con
cerned that opposition leader Walid lumblatt might
be trying to create a Druze mini-state that could
lead to the partitioning of Lebanon, held emergency
meetings with key advisers yesterday to examine
Jumblatt's creation of a new civil authority in the
Shouf Mountains, traditional homeland of the
Druze.
After the meetings, Farouk Jaber, a political ad
viser to the president, told reporters that Syria is
using Jumblatt, whose militia it supported during
the recently ended Lebanese fighting, as a tool for
the division of Lebanon into cantons, or separate
states.

"I believe there is an attempt to partition Lebanon
on a canton basis," Jaber said. "The action taken by
Mr. Jumblatt falls in the long-term strategy of the
Syrian government to extend its hegemony over
parts of Lebanon."
The same fear was expressed in the Beirut press.
But Jumblatt, who on Saturday announced crea
tion of a "Peoples Authority for Civil Administra
tion" in the Shouf, declared yesterday that his
movie is "not a step towards partition.
"It is merely a question of organizing the lives of
the (local Druze) population and bringing them aid,
nothing more," Jumblatt insisted, speaking at a cer
emony in Hammana, about 15 miles northeast of
Beirut.
The administration, he said, would deal with
pressing social and economic matters in the absence
of a strong central government. He said it would be
responsible "in exceptional circumstances" for run
ning civilian business and could turn itself into a
"pressure group," acting on the official administra
tion.
Jumblatt, who is head of the opposition Progres
sive Socialist Party as wel as the maximum chieftain
of the Druze, added that the administration would
consist of a general congress, people's committees
from towns and villages, a central committee re
sponsible for planning and an eight-member admin

gives expression to the radically rightwing senti
ments thought to motivate their abductions, bom
bings and killings. Radio Sovereignty, which calls
itself "the voice of a people struggling against the
Marxist international," broadcasts in short wave
four times a day with denunciations of Salvadoran
guerrillas and the professors and labor activists
who it says are promoting their cause.
Rightist death squads are thought by U.S.
diplomats to contain members of security forces
free-lancing alongside politically connected offi

throughout the struggle here.
British Laborites elect new leader
London — The opposition Labor Party elected new
leadership yesterday in a move aimed at bolstering
its position for an eventual challenge to Prime Mini
ster Margaret Thatcher for control of the govern
ment of Britain.
At its annual conference at Brighton, Labor
picked as its new leader Neil Kinnock, 41, a member
of the party's left wing and an articulate, charismatic
Welshman.
Kinnock replaces Michael Foot, who led the party
to its greatest defeat in modern times in the general
election of last spring, won overwhelmingly by
Thatcher's Conservative Party.
As its new deputy leader, Labor chose Roy Mat
tersley, 50, a veteran politician of the party's center
right, who had run against Kinnock for the top post.
After the party elections, some political observers
in Brighton began calling the Kinnock-Mattersley
team a "dream ticket."
That was meant to suggest that with a left-winger
in Kinnock — who seems to be moving toward the
right — and a right-winger like Mattersley — who is
moving leftward — the Labor Party would have ener
getic Nos. 1 and 2 likely to appeal to the broad mass
of British voters.
Under a complex system of balloting, that includes
the British trade unions, Labor members of Parlia
ment, and grass roots constituency parties, Kinnock
was elected with 71 percent of the vote compared to
Mattersley's 19 percent in the leadership contest.
Two minor candidates shared the remaining 10 per
cent of the ballots.

Reagan shuns blame for recession
Washington — Thirteen months before election day,
President Reagan and his Treasury secretary are
shunning responsibility for the recession that sent
unemployment soaring last year and for deficits that
are more than three times those of the Carter ad
ministration.
He and Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, in a
recent economic rewriting, are also denying what
most economists and many of Reagan's own officials
have assumed as facts:
That a relatively severe recession arrived six
months after the new president took office in 1981.
And that high interest rates, due largely to the
possibility of ever-growing federal budget deficits,
are the biggest threat to the current recovery from
that recession.
With the denials comes a clearly implied warning
to Democratic opponents: You can assume no fact
in criticizing the president's economic performance
during the coming campaign — if he decides to seek a
second term. As muddy as the waters of economics
are for the average voter, the president and his aide
are adding a little extra goo.
The president, for his part, is being subtle about
it.
In a low-key interview shown on television last
week, he told talk-show host Merv Griffin, "there
was a recession when we came" into office. He
didn't say that to a reporter who might have chal
lenged it. And he didn't say it as if he were arguing
one side of a controversial matter. He just slipped it
in for millions of Americans to hear.
But when Reagan took office the economy was
racing ahead. The government figures, for the
record, show real gross national product surging at
an annual rate of 9 percent for the first three
months of 1981, the fastest in three years.
Democrats race on opposite paths
Washington — Walter Mondale's Dream Week, a
production months in the making, treated America
to the year's most striking demonstration of how the
two Democratic front-runners are racing in oppo
site directions toward the presidency.
And it was the week that laid bare dramatic differ
ences in strategies: former Vice-President Mondale
mastered the machinery of traditional Democratic
politics, while Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) basked in
consolation and even comfort at the message and

imagery that reached the public.
Mondale's week was everything his strategists
had hoped and politicked for during the last year
and was the key to the nomination, they believe. In
Hollywood, Fla., Saturday, he swept the endorse
ment of the AFL-CIO board, in Washington he did
the same with the National Education Association,
and in Maine he trounced the field in a heavily con
tested party straw poll.
Vet Mondale's Dream Week began with Glenn
looming large on the newsstands. Newsweek maga
zine devoted its cover and an extraordinary 13 up
front pages to reports about Glenn and The Right
Stuff, the movie that depicts the heroics of
America's first seven astronauts even as one is
trying to capture the nation's hearts, minds and
votes.
That fits into Glenn's master plan. For on Oct. 15,
eve of the movie's glittering Kennedy Genter
premiere, the Glenn campaign is to launch itself into
the living rooms of an estimated 17 million people
with a five-minute political commercial spectacular
on prime time at 8:55 p.m. over the CBS network.
The plan is to build on Glenn's fame as one of the
original Mercury astronauts by laying out a theme
and platform for his campaign, according to a senior
Glenn official.
For the prime-time slot and the hope of adding
some substance to its candidate's celebrity luster,
the Glenn camp will spend less than $50,000.
But Glenn's strategists say they have found a
pleasant spell of relief in the way television pre
sented the results of Mondale's Dream Week to
viewers Saturday night.
CBS correspondent Bruce Morton followed the
report of the AFL-CIO decision with a lengthy
presentation of a poll, casting it in terms that raised
doubt about the endorsement's value.
Turning to the Maine results, he told viewers:
"As for the straw poll, well, if Mondale had lost,
everyone would have said it was a defeat. But he
won, so everyone can forget about it."
Today's weather
Sunny. Highs in the 70s to near 80. Tonight and
Tuesday: Mostly fair except patchy low clouds near
the ocean night and morning. Lows in the 50s and
highs in the upper 60s to mid-80s.

Gemayel calls emergency meeting
Beirut, Lebanon — President Amin Gemayel, con
cerned that opposition leader Walid lumblatt might
be trying to create a Druze mini-state that could
lead to the partitioning of Lebanon, held emergency
meetings with key advisers yesterday to examine
Jumblatt's creation of a new civil authority in the
Shouf Mountains, traditional homeland of the
Druze.
After the meetings, Farouk Jaber, a political ad
viser to the president, told reporters that Syria is
using Jumblatt, whose militia it supported during
the recently ended Lebanese fighting, as a tool for
the division of Lebanon into cantons, or separate
states.

"I believe there is an attempt to partition Lebanon
on a canton basis," Jaber said. "The action taken by
Mr. Jumblatt falls in the long-term strategy of the
Syrian government to extend its hegemony over
parts of Lebanon."
The same fear was expressed in the Beirut press.
But Jumblatt, who on Saturday announced crea
tion of a "Peoples Authority for Civil Administra
tion" in the Shouf, declared yesterday that his
movie is "not a step towards partition.
"It is merely a question of organizing the lives of
the (local Druze) population and bringing them aid,
nothing more," Jumblatt insisted, speaking at a cer
emony in Hammana, about 15 miles northeast of
Beirut.
The administration, he said, would deal with
pressing social and economic matters in the absence
of a strong central government. He said it would be
responsible "in exceptional circumstances" for run
ning civilian business and could turn itself into a
"pressure group," acting on the official administra
tion.
Jumblatt, who is head of the opposition Progres
sive Socialist Party as wel as the maximum chieftain
of the Druze, added that the administration would
consist of a general congress, people's committees
from towns and villages, a central committee re
sponsible for planning and an eight-member admin
istrative body to apply policies.
lumblatt's Saturday announcement, made in the
mountain village of Beit Ed Dine, avoided using the
word government, calling his new entity an author
ity and adding that it was "for purely organizational
matters."
However, the Gemayel government obviously saw
it as more than that. State-run Beirut Radio said that
lumblatt's move points "to a secessionist trend" and
proclaimed that the government "will launch a large
scale political offensive to take the steps necessarv
for confronting this development as well as similar
moves, to spare the country the danger of parti
tion."
Salvadoran rightists fight back
San Salvador, El Salvador — Far-right death squads
re-emerging from the shadows of Salvadoran
politics have launched a new terror campaign
against the leftist opposition here, claiming respon
sibility for a spate of murders and bombings and
warning of more "exterminations" to come.
The publicized vigilante attacks reflect
heightened tension here, mainly over faltering go
vernment attempts to begin a dialogue with rebel
leaders and a crucial Constituent Assembly debate
over a U.S.-promoted agrarian reform program bit
terly resented by El Salvador's landowners.
They come at a time when the Salvadoran political
right, led by former Major Roberto D'Aubuisson's
Nationalist Republican Alliance, no longer enjoys an
assured Constituent Assembly majority and
D'Aubuisson himself is trying to moderate his image
in preparation for presidential elections. As a

result, the country's extreme right has found its
above-ground tools of powers dulled.
For the first time in El Salvador's almost four-year
old civil war, the death squads also appear to have a
clandestine publicity arm, Radio Sovereignty, which
gives expression to the radically rightwing senti
ments thought to motivate their abductions, bom
bings and killings. Radio Sovereignty, which calls
itself "the voice of a people struggling against the
Marxist international," broadcasts in short wave
four times a day with denunciations of Salvadoran
guerrillas and the professors and labor activists
who it says are promoting their cause.
