# Panel supports Reagan library
## 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
A committee of Hoover Institution scholars,
saying that the proposed Reagan presidential li
brary complex would be "an immensely
valuable academic resource to the entire Stan
ford community," has recommended unani
mously that the president be invited to locate
his library, museum and center for public af
fairs here.
The panel, headed by Hoover Senior Fellow
Martin Anderson, a former Reagan assistant, is
the first of three committees looking into the li
brary complex to report its findings.
Recommendations from two University panels
are still forthcoming.
The more important of the two, a nine
member faculty committee headed by Econom
ics Prof. James Rosse, is assessing the academic
merit of the proposed complex. Its report to
University President Donald Kennedy was due
Saturday, but it is still being revised, according
to knowledgeable sources who spoke under
the condition that they not be identified.
Those sources have said that there are dis
agreements among members of the nine

member panel, and that it is likely that one or
more dissenting reports will be included with
the committee recommendation when it is sub
mitted to Kennedy later this week.
The Anderson committee report suggested
that the Reagan complex be located in the foot
hills next to the Center for the Advanced Study
of Behaviorial Sciences. The committee called
that site, which would be built on an extension
of Campus Drive, the "optimal" one.
That site, like two other locations being
evaluated by the second University committee,
a site panel headed by University Planner Phil
Williams, would also virtually eliminate the
parking, traffic and environmental problems
that critics have charged would be brought by
the proposed center, the report said.
Stanford is "the logical choice" for a Reagan
library, the committee said, because "of Stan
ford's international reputation for academic
freedom and academic excellence," because
Reagan is a former governor of California, and
because of "Reagan's long association with the
Hoover Institution and his high regard for the
staff and faculty" at Hoover and Stanford.
The library itself, according to the report,

would be of "incalculable academic benefit" to
the Stanford community, giving it "special and
expanded access" to official papers of the pres
ident and Cabinet officers, and to the re
sources of other presidential libraries and to
the National Archives in Washington, D.C.
The museum, the committee said, "if properly
done, can add a rich part of American history to
the entire community."
The proposed center for public affairs would
be of great academic value not only to the com
munity but to the entire nation, it said. The cen
ter, which would be run by 'he Hoover Institu
tion, would include spacious conference
facilities for periodic seminars on major issues,
and would run a program of advanced study
and research consisting of visiting fellows ap
pointed for specific terms.
Among the 12 members of the Anderson com
mittee, which was made up entirely of Hoover
officials, were two Nobel laureates in econom
ics — Milton Friedman, a senior research fellow,
and George Stigler, a University of Chicago
professor who heads the Domestic Studies Ad
visory Committee of the Hoover Institution.
