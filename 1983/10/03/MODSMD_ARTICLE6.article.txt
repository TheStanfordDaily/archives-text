# SSRL chief discusses weapons research
## 
### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Arthur Bienenstock, director of
the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL) told a small
group in Roble Lounge last night
that the controversial newly
accepted project at the laboratory
will involve at least some weapons
related research.
"Most, but not all, the work
carried out will be basic research,"
Bienenstock said, "and the basic
work is unequivocably linked with
weapons research."
The types of research carried out
under the proposal, submitted by
the Lawrence Livermore, Los
Alamos and Sandia National Labora
tories and the University of Califor
nia over a year ago and accepted by
Bienenstock last Tuesday, include
several kinds of "basic research"
which could fc>«? appliod to munitions
testing.
The SSRL director presented a
list that included the development
of more sophisticated x-ray optics,
the development of x-ray lasers and
the analysis of the arrangement of
molecules in actinide compounds
and in compounds under high pres
sure.
The revised research proposal
that Bienenstock accepted states
that there will be "no direct calibra
tion" of detectors, which are used
to measure the amount of radiation
emitted in the actual explosion of a
nuclear weapon. But Bienenstock
said there is no way SSRL could
prevent researchers from develop
ing and testing a new detector
during the SSRL project.
Furthermore, Bienenstock ex
plained that now that the proposal
has been accepted, there is no way
to determine exactly what kind of
research will be conducted using

SSRL's beam line.
"Once a project has been started,
it's always possible for someone to
slip in work that we don't know
about," Bienenstock said. "We
don't police the laboratory."
Therefore, he said it is possible
that there will be some testing and
research over which SSRL will have
no control. "Right now,
however," he added, "it would be
possible for, say, a chemical compa
ny to submit a proposal for testing
rocks that had nothing to do with
weapons and then slip in a sample
directly related to munitions re
search."
SSRL can control the project by
reviewing it annually to see if it
should continue and also by moni-

toring the scheduling of the beam
time. The original proposal asked
that the researchers be allowed to
schedule time on the beam and that
SSRL allocate 100 percent of the
beam time to the weapons laborato
ries and UC, instead of the two
thirds that will be granted under
the new proposal.
Bienenstock also explained how
he made his decision to accept the
proposal.
"From the first time I saw the pro
posal, I knew it was going to be con
troversial," he said. "I was in a
quandry, but I didn't have to face
the same dilemma everyone else was
facing. For me, it was not a question
of whether it was morally right or
wrong to do munitions testing at
SSRL."

Bienenstock said the eventual
decision was made in his capacity as
a University administrator rather
than as an individual scientist. "Nine
months ago I personally wouldn't
have touched weapons research,"
he said.
He explained, however, that he is
not personally opposed to weapons
research.
"Looking at history, one can see
that those who are weak usually get
it,"he said. "If you stop research
now, there will come a time when
people will not have the knowledge
that they need to keep up. This
leads to military one-sidedness,
which increases the probability of
nuclear war."
