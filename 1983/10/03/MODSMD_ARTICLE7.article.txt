# Students abroad to tour Poland
## 
### CAROL CINI 
Students who attend the Stan
ford overseas campuses in Berlin
and Vienna this spring quarter
will be able to go on a 10-day trip
to Poland.
Overseas Studies and the Uni
versity of Krakow have organ
ized a trip where Stanford stu
dents will actually be able to visit
a Polish university and live with
Polish students.
"That's what's really exciting,"
said Prof. Mark Mancall, direc
tor of Overseas Studies, in refer
ence to the trip. "We've been
trying to create this opportunity
for a long time."
Students will spend six days in
Krakow and will live at the jagiel
lonian University of Krakow with
Polish students. Since "a lot of
Poles speak English," there will
be no language barrier, accor
ding to Mancall.
The Stanford group will meet
with Polish workers, attend
lectures by government and uni
versity officials and visit religious
shrines, industrial centers and
the site of the Auschwitz concen
tration camp.
Lecturers will cover topics on
the present political situation in
Poland, as well as the history, so
ciety, economy, art and religion
of the country.
"We're trying to tie the field
trips directly into the lectures so
that each day is a different aspect
of Poland," said Mancall. For in
stance, the lecture on religion in
Poland will be accompanied by a
visit to the Black Madonna, the
holiest shrine in Poland, and the

lecture on the situation of Poles
and Jews during World War II
will be followed by a trip to
Auschwitz.
The trip to Poland will involve
"learning as much as possible
about one country in one week,"
according to Karen Kramer, as
sociate director of Stanford in
Berlin. "Krakow is a beautiful
city," and in addition to field
trips and lectures, there will be
"time for students to explore
things on their own" and see the
"hot spots in Krakow," she said.

"American students will be a
great attraction at the University
of Krakow," said Stanford Uni
versity Bursar Joseph Jedd, who
worked to make the program
possible. "I think when students
go they should take t-shirts with
Stanford and American names on

them, as long as it's something in
English, (the Polish students)
love it," Jedd said, who is Polish.
Students will also be able to go
on to Warsaw for three days. For
the stay in Warsaw, no specific
lectures or visits are planned.
Students will be free to explore
and do "anything they want to
do," according to Mancall.
He sees no dangers for stu
dents in Poland right now, but
"obviously if the political situa
tion gets worse, we would
reconsider. . . .We don't know
what Poland will be like in the
spring, but that makes it interest
ing to go."
Mancall stressed that "Poland
is very different from what we
believe." Early last month he
visited Krakow with Jedd, Kramer
and Hedi Thimig, associate direc
tor of Stanford-in-Vienna, to
make plans for the students' trip
in the spring.
"I was amazed that Poland is a
very different place than I
thought it would be. Poland is
not a closed society. People
travel around very easily. I was in
a theater sitting next to a man
who was from Columbia Univer
sity. He said he was bumming
around' Poland."
Kramer was in Poland 20 years
ago, when the "people were
frustrated with their political sit
uation." Today in Poland, she says,
there is "no timidness in public
places to openly speak" and
there is an "ongoing resistance,
one of the things one does not
notice in East Germany."
