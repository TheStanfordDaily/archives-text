Frigid superpower relations, chilled
by the downing of a commercial jet
liner one month ago, may have been
exacerbated by recent actions both
in the Soviet Union and the United
States.
President Reagan's new plan to
reduce medium-range nuclear
missiles in Europe, unveiled Mon
day at the United Nations General
Assembly in hopes of breaking the
deadlocked arms control talks in
Geneva, was dubbed "a step against
peace" in an unusually sharp
denunciation by Soviet Chief Yuri
Andropov.
In the United Nations address,
Reagan said the United States was
willing to:
1) forgo the effort to counter So
viet medium-range missiles with an
equal number of American war
heads in Europe and instead deploy
some of the new cruise and Persh
ing II missiles in the United States or
elsewhere;
2) include medium-range bom
bers as "nuclear-capable" weapons
in any arms control dialogue, as the
Soviets have repeatedly insisted,
and
3) promise that any overall weap
ons reductions agreements would
include Pershings, which are sched
uled to be stationed in Europe in
December and could strike Soviet
targets within minutes.
Andropov's lambasting of Wash
ington's planned Pershing deploy
ment was dramatically amplified by
carefully orchestrated anti-war
demonstrations, in which thousands
of civilians in cities throughout Rus
sia gathered to praise Soviet arms
control initiatives and assail the
Reagan administration's foreign
policy.
Soviet figures put total rally atten
dence at between 500,000 and

800,000, but most Western analysts
estimated substantially lower partic
ipation and noted that police and
soldiers were on hand to coor
dinate activities.
Western analysts believe the
demonstrations may mark the start
of an aggressive Soviet publicity
campaign aimed at preventing
Pershing deployment in Europe.
The momentum of previous drives
to block Pershing installation was
stalled by the defensive stance the
Soviet government assumed in the
wake of the Korean airliner inci
dent.
•
The frantic search to recover the
flight recorders from Korean Air
Lines flight 007 suffered a severe
setback last week when the identify
ing electronic "pings" from the two
canisters either moved out of detec
tion range or stopped completely.
The high visability orange-red
"boxes,", which recorded the last
30 minutes of 007's flight before a
Soviet pilot shot down the airliner
and killed all 269 people aboard, are
the subjects of an intensive search
by Soviet and joint American-
Japanese naval forces.
The target area is 15 square miles
of rugged terrain varying from 300
to 2500 feet deep, with underwater
mountains that have repeatedly
obstructed sonar scanners.
Soviet military authorities have
handed over five wooden crates
containing 76 items of clothing and
debris but no human remains or re
vealing data. "They said it was
everything, but do you believe in
Santa Claus?" remarked an Ameri
can official who attended the ex
change on Sakhalin Island.
Attempts to affix blame for the dis
aster continued in a series of verbal

clashes between Washington and
Moscow. In Monday's speech to the
United Nations, President Reagan
said that the incident offered "new,
unwelcome evidence of brutal dis
regard for life and truth." Soviet
Leader Yuri Andropov maintained
his government's position that KAL
007 was engaged "in unprece
dented criminal subversion" as part
of a carefully calculated spy mission
"by the American special services."
Air traffic to the Soviet Union
returned almost to normal as sanc
tions either expired or were lifted
by various airlines. In Montreal, the
international pilots union said
Friday that the progress toward a
new code to protect civilian air
liners was sufficient to justify res
cinding its original call for a 60-day
suspension of flights to Moscow.
•
Lebanon's 179 th cease-fire in 10
years was greeted with pessimism by
Arab analysts, who charge that the
latest American attempts to suspend
fighting by creating a national
reconciliation committee differ little
from the past 178 attempts.
"What is disillusioning is that we
have not learned from history," said
one expert at the American Univer
sity of Beirut. "Even if we liberate
the whole country, even if we
rehabilitate it, there remains the
basic question of how you put to
gether groups who perhaps don't
want to be interacting and living to
gether."
The present Lebanese govern
ment is based on a 1943 pact that
guarantees certain political offices
to members of specific ethnic and
religious groups. Some critics con
tend that 40 years of demographic
change in Lebanon have resulted in
an antiquated political system that
cannot address the present needs
of the war-torn country.
•
Depressed exports and high interest
rates, coupled with mounting debts
in the Third World and the Commu
nist Bloc, prompted President
Reagan to reaffirm American com
mitment to the International Mone
tary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank
at last week's annual meetings in
Washington.
While Reagan assured confer
ence participants that Congress
would assist in attempts to avert an
international financial crisis, Trea
sury Secretary Donald Regan gave a
flat "no" to more extended United
States emergency support and also
announced that America wants to
cut back World Bank loans to poor
countries.
Immediate IMF concern centered
on Brazil, which cannot service its
$90 billion in postponed debts.

Much of the conference's activities
involved the formation of an $11 bil
lion rescue package for Brazil, al
though it is not clear whether or
not the emergency funds can be se
cured.
Defense Secretary Casper
Weinberger, in China for negotia
tions last week, announced that
Chinese Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang
will visit the United States in january
and that President Reagan will be
going to Peking in April.
Washington's recent decision to
reclassify China as a "friendly
power" eligible for more high tech
nology exports and an American
agreement to import $800 million in
Chinese textiles had raised specula
tion that China might be interested
in pursuing a closer military alliance
with the United States.
But last week, in a move that some
analysts claim is designed to assert
Chinese non-alliance, Peking said
that talks on normalizing Sino-
Soviet relations would resume on
Thursday.
•
Rioting continued in the Philippines,
and President Ferdinand Marcos
drew fire from various fronts, in
cluding members of the country's
business community, for his alleged
role in the assassination of opposi
tion leader Benigno Aquino.
Saturday, the Marcos govern
ment quoted a former Aquino
bodyguard as saying that Commu
nists had recruited his former em
ployer's assassin. Aquino's widow,
Corazon Aquino, dismissed the ac
count, calling the man "a liar to
begin with."

The War Powers Act was exercised
for the first time by Congress,
which agreed in strongly partisan
votes in the House and Senate to
limit Lebanon intervention by Amer
ican Marines to 18 months.

designed to avoid national elections
next year. Congress also limited the
size of the Marine force, which

presently stands at 1200.
•
Fiscal Year 1983 ended last week
with a formal deficit forecast at
$209.8 billion. Because of post
recessionary corporate profits, tho
exact figure may be slightly less than
$200 billion — or some $90 billion
more than the previous record of
$110.7 billion set last year.

Frigid superpower relations, chilled
by the downing of a commercial jet
liner one month ago, may have been
exacerbated by recent actions both
in the Soviet Union and the United
States.
President Reagan's new plan to
reduce medium-range nuclear
missiles in Europe, unveiled Mon
day at the United Nations General
Assembly in hopes of breaking the
deadlocked arms control talks in
Geneva, was dubbed "a step against
peace" in an unusually sharp
denunciation by Soviet Chief Yuri
Andropov.
In the United Nations address,
Reagan said the United States was
willing to:
1) forgo the effort to counter So
viet medium-range missiles with an
equal number of American war
heads in Europe and instead deploy
some of the new cruise and Persh
ing II missiles in the United States or
elsewhere;
2) include medium-range bom
bers as "nuclear-capable" weapons
in any arms control dialogue, as the
Soviets have repeatedly insisted,
and
3) promise that any overall weap
ons reductions agreements would
include Pershings, which are sched
uled to be stationed in Europe in
December and could strike Soviet
targets within minutes.
Andropov's lambasting of Wash
ington's planned Pershing deploy
ment was dramatically amplified by
carefully orchestrated anti-war
demonstrations, in which thousands
of civilians in cities throughout Rus
sia gathered to praise Soviet arms
control initiatives and assail the
Reagan administration's foreign
policy.
Soviet figures put total rally atten
dence at between 500,000 and

800,000, but most Western analysts
estimated substantially lower partic
ipation and noted that police and
soldiers were on hand to coor
dinate activities.
Western analysts believe the
demonstrations may mark the start
of an aggressive Soviet publicity
campaign aimed at preventing
Pershing deployment in Europe.
The momentum of previous drives
to block Pershing installation was
stalled by the defensive stance the
Soviet government assumed in the
wake of the Korean airliner inci
dent.
•
The frantic search to recover the
flight recorders from Korean Air
Lines flight 007 suffered a severe
setback last week when the identify
ing electronic "pings" from the two
canisters either moved out of detec
tion range or stopped completely.
The high visability orange-red
"boxes,", which recorded the last
30 minutes of 007's flight before a
Soviet pilot shot down the airliner
and killed all 269 people aboard, are
the subjects of an intensive search
by Soviet and joint American-
Japanese naval forces.
The target area is 15 square miles
of rugged terrain varying from 300
to 2500 feet deep, with underwater
mountains that have repeatedly
obstructed sonar scanners.
Soviet military authorities have
handed over five wooden crates
containing 76 items of clothing and
debris but no human remains or re
vealing data. "They said it was
everything, but do you believe in
Santa Claus?" remarked an Ameri
can official who attended the ex
change on Sakhalin Island.
Attempts to affix blame for the dis
aster continued in a series of verbal

clashes between Washington and
Moscow. In Monday's speech to the
United Nations, President Reagan
said that the incident offered "new,
unwelcome evidence of brutal dis
regard for life and truth." Soviet
Leader Yuri Andropov maintained
his government's position that KAL
007 was engaged "in unprece
dented criminal subversion" as part
of a carefully calculated spy mission
"by the American special services."
Air traffic to the Soviet Union
returned almost to normal as sanc
tions either expired or were lifted
by various airlines. In Montreal, the
international pilots union said
Friday that the progress toward a
new code to protect civilian air
liners was sufficient to justify res
cinding its original call for a 60-day
suspension of flights to Moscow.
•
Lebanon's 179 th cease-fire in 10
years was greeted with pessimism by
Arab analysts, who charge that the
latest American attempts to suspend
fighting by creating a national
reconciliation committee differ little
from the past 178 attempts.
"What is disillusioning is that we
have not learned from history," said
one expert at the American Univer
sity of Beirut. "Even if we liberate
the whole country, even if we
rehabilitate it, there remains the
basic question of how you put to
gether groups who perhaps don't
want to be interacting and living to
gether."
The present Lebanese govern
ment is based on a 1943 pact that
guarantees certain political offices
to members of specific ethnic and
religious groups. Some critics con
tend that 40 years of demographic
change in Lebanon have resulted in
an antiquated political system that
cannot address the present needs
of the war-torn country.
•
Depressed exports and high interest
rates, coupled with mounting debts
in the Third World and the Commu
nist Bloc, prompted President
Reagan to reaffirm American com
mitment to the International Mone
tary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank
at last week's annual meetings in
Washington.
While Reagan assured confer
ence participants that Congress
would assist in attempts to avert an
international financial crisis, Trea
sury Secretary Donald Regan gave a
flat "no" to more extended United
States emergency support and also
announced that America wants to
cut back World Bank loans to poor
countries.
Immediate IMF concern centered
on Brazil, which cannot service its
$90 billion in postponed debts.

Much of the conference's activities
involved the formation of an $11 bil
lion rescue package for Brazil, al
though it is not clear whether or
not the emergency funds can be se
cured.
Defense Secretary Casper
Weinberger, in China for negotia
tions last week, announced that
Chinese Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang
will visit the United States in january
and that President Reagan will be
going to Peking in April.
Washington's recent decision to
reclassify China as a "friendly
power" eligible for more high tech
nology exports and an American
agreement to import $800 million in
Chinese textiles had raised specula
tion that China might be interested
in pursuing a closer military alliance
with the United States.
But last week, in a move that some
analysts claim is designed to assert
Chinese non-alliance, Peking said
that talks on normalizing Sino-
Soviet relations would resume on

Rioting continued in the Philippines,

ment quoted a former Aquino
bodyguard as saying that Commu
nists had recruited his former em
ployer's assassin. Aquino's widow,
Corazon Aquino, dismissed the ac
count, calling the man "a liar to

The War Powers Act was exercised
for the first time by Congress,
which agreed in strongly partisan
votes in the House and Senate to
limit Lebanon intervention by Amer
ican Marines to 18 months.
The time frame was specifically
designed to avoid national elections
next year. Congress also limited the
size of the Marine force, which

presently stands at 1200.

Fiscal Year 1983 ended last week

votes in the House and Senate to
limit Lebanon intervention by Amer
ican Marines to 18 months.
The time frame was specifically
designed to avoid national elections
next year. Congress also limited the
size of the Marine force, which

presently stands at 1200.

Fiscal Year 1983 ended last week
with a formal deficit forecast at
$209.8 billion. Because of post
recessionary corporate profits, tho
exact figure may be slightly less than
$200 billion — or some $90 billion
more than the previous record of
$110.7 billion set last year.
