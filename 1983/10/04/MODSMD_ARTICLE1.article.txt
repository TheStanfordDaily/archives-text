# Campus bus line to expand
## 
### ALAN ZAFRAN 
A newly improved and expanded
Marguerite shuttle service — free to
all Stanford students, faculty and
staff — is scheduled to replace the old
campus transit system and begin
operations in mid-November, ac
cording to the University Commit
tee on Parking and Transportation.
The new service will replace the
three Peninsula transit buses, now
in service, which were under-used
and expensive.
The new Marguerite line plans to
expand its service, improve the
buses and advertise extensively.
Six custom-made, cardinal
colored vans with the distinct Mar
guerite logo (a galloping horse) will
replace the old, unmarked buses.
Complete with stereo, air condi
tioning, and two-way radio in case
of breakdowns, these 16-
passenger vans will make inner
campus travel much more com
fortable and dependable.
By doubling the number of
vehicles in operation, Marguerite's
service will expand to both sides of
campus. Service will include the
two-way loop around Serra Street,
Tresidder and Escondido Village,
trips to and from the Palo Alto train
station, and noon runs to the Stan
ford Shopping Center. In addition,
the Marguerite's new route will
pass by the Medical Center, Center
for Information Technology, Roble
Hall, Terman Engineering Center,
Florence Moore Hall and 558
Mayfield.
The attempt to improve the Mar
guerite largely stems from the Per
sonnel Task Force Report of
February 1983. An overview of Stan
ford as an employer, the study
surprisingly concluded that severe
campus parking problems top the
Stanford community's few griev
ances. Consequently, plans for an
improved, more reliable transit ser
vice were quickly proposed and
adopted.
"In the past, the Marguerite has
not been well-publicized, nor has it
received adequate financial sup
port,'' said Mason Yearian, profes
sor of physics and chairman of the
