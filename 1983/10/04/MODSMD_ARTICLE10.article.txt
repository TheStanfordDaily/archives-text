## Why the Stanford football team is losing 
### 
I wish to refute the rumors that the interview reported
below with a University administrator — termed below "DK"
(short for "Don't Know") — ever took place. For anyone to say
so is a scurrilous lie. No! I only dreamt that it took place. (I
had fallen asleep while listening to the broadcast of the game
between Arizona State University and the Comatose Cards.)
Daily: Sir, the media have reported that serious considera
tion is being given to replacing head football coach Paul Wig
gin.
DK: Let me be the first to deny it. We are quite pleased with
the progress he's been making.
Daily (incredulously): Progress?
DK: Certainly. Last year Stanford reached the maximum
number of television appearances permitted by the NCAA.
And that with a losing team!
Daily: Uh, some fans might not accept television appear
ances as the correct measure of progress.
DK: Let me clear up a misconception. We in the administra
tion are concerned about Stanford's image. Winning against
respectable competition makes people believe that you've de
emphasized academics. Look at the Ivy League. You certainly
don't see them doing anything that degrading.
Daily: Well then, you seem to be encouraging the develop
ment of a losing mentality.

DK: There you've got it! If we can't compete on the athletic
fields, it's got to be because we're stars in the classroom. And
we'll have to make a concerted effort to schedule teams that
are more appropriate to our level of mentality. I envision on
going series with our natural rivals in the south: CalTech and
Occidental College.
Daily: So, playing competitively with them wouldn't be so
embarrassing?
DK: Heavens, no! You still don't understand, do you? We'd
hope to lose to them, too. Our "recruiting efforts" in South
ern California would be greatly enhanced by convincing
people down there that we're even more serious about
academics than those schools are.
Daily: Ingenious. But if Stanford stays in the Pac-10,
wouldn't it be reasonable to try to win and go to The Rose
Bowl?
DK (with clear consternation in his voice): Let me stress for
you the ten in Pac-10. That means that a team should go to the
Rose Bowl an average of once every 10 years. Stanford went
twice at the beginning of the 19705. If we were to go even
once more anytime soon, we'd be interpreted as not being
sufficiently academically oriented. So, I'm afraid that going to
the Rose Bowl is out of the question for the remainder of this
centurv.

Daily: Sir, many people across the nation hold a special af
fection for Stanford's football program. They like to hold the
school up as an example of one where bright people con
gregate, study hard, prepare to succeed in life, and yet are
competitive in sports. Don't you feel that there is widespread
disappointment and frustration with the way that Stanford has
performed under Wiggin and the fact that Stanford started
the season picked among Penthouse's "Bottom Twenty?"
DK: Let me first respond by saying that I was delighted to
see Stanford discussed in my favorite journal. By the way, I
was a bit irritated that they didn't contact me for a personal
interview. But, more to the point, I believe that the attitude
that you mention is one foreign to the American spirit. It's
Classical Grecian to believe this nonsense about a strong
mind in a strong body.
Daily: But, sir, your well-known early morning excursions
to the Dish?
DK: Yes, I have a strong body. . . .
And at that point I awoke. Music was blaring over the radio.
The game was over. But somehow I didn't wonder who had
won.
