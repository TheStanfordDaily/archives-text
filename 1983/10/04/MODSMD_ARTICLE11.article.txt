## James Watt's overwhelming sense of humor 
### 
I noticed a new group at registra
tion this year. I was used to the
usual bunch, ranging from windsur
fers and religious groups all the way
to the Revolutionary Communist
Party and the ASSU.
I thought I was prepared for
anyone, but these guys really threw
me: the Stanford Republican
League.
It wasn't so much the fact that they
were Republicans - after all, some of
my best friends are conservative. It
was their slogan:
"For a Progressive Republican
Majority."
Think about that. I've heard
people accuse activists of living in
the '60s, but these were the first
ones I've met who were living in the
1860s.
To confuse me further, they had a
picture of Ronald Reagan taped to
their table. What did this mean? Is
Reagan a progressive? Will the Stan
ford Progressive Alliance start lob
bying for the taxing of unemploy
ment insurance and ketchup as a
vegetable?
It might not be such a bad thing
for SPA, anyway - they might get fun
ding from Hoover.
Fleeing from Maples in confusion
and poverty, I arrived at my dorm
only to find an SRL flyer posted in a
prominent place. Being an avid
reader of flyers — Saturday nights
usually find me hanging around a
kiosk, with a flashlight -1 took it back
to my room for an in-depth analysis.
It was headed, "An Agenda for
Republican Victory in 1984." First, I
thought, don't use that date so
much. It makes people nervous.
But no, there was only one item
on the agenda: "REPLACE JAMES
WATT as Secretary of Interior."

It went on to say, "The GOP can
no longer afford Watt's humor
when it harms our goal of a majority
for limited government."
I get it — Watt was joking when he
tried to sell all of America's coal at
less than a penny a ton. Quite a
sense of humor, James. Indian
reservations are an example of the
failure of socialism? Hilarious.
Mineral exploration — in wilderness
areas? Ha-ha, ho-ho-ho.
It's not Watt's sense of humor
that's the problem. It's just that
people don't realize he's kidding
when he tries to emasculate all our
environmental protection laws and

give away resources to corpora
tions.
The Stanford Republican League
asks on its flyer, "What do YOU
think?" Well, I think that if I were
Ronald Reagan I would hold on to
James Watt and in fact be extra nice
to him — maybe let him come out to
the ranch to chop wood. Watt is a
political asset, not a liability.
Huh, you might ask? First of all,
most people who don't like Watt
wouldn't vote for Reagan anyway.
Most of his supporters are old fat
men, and how many old fat men go
backpacking? Let's face it, if you can
support someone who thinks trees

cause pollution, you're not much of
an environmentalist.
Secondly, Watt keeps the crazy
people on the right wing happy — an
important part of Reagan's con
stituency. Ever since Haig left, there
haven't been too many crazy people
in prominent positions. And the far
right never liked Haig anyway. I
guess they thought the idea of a
"nuclear warning shot" was too
wimpy.
But most importantly, Watt
creates an important diversion for
the president. Look at all the stories
about Watt's coal sales or Watt's
plans to open up huge areas to off

shore drilling. Reagan's name is
hardly ever mentioned.
One gets the impression that
Reagan doesn't even hear about
these things until the next day when
he reads them in the paper (or
more likely next month, when he
reads them in Reader's Digest). But
you're kidding yourself if you don't
think Reagan gives his personal ap
proval to these things — or even
dreams them up himself.
The GOP can no longer afford
Watt's humor? The only one laugh
ing may be Reagan — but he's laugh
ing himself into a second term.
