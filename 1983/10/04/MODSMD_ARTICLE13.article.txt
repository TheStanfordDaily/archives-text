Dead review
Reading through Charles Ponce
de Leon's Viewpoint on the Grate
ful Dead (Sept. 30), I couldn't help
but visualize Charles as a highly
intellectual Stanford being who,
dressed in general-purpose rock
and roll garb, strolled confidently
into his first Dead show and calmly
nodded and smiled to himself the
entire time, mental typewriter
going clackity-clunk.
"Why this band is not such an
enigma," whispered Charles as a
beautiful blonde dancer almost
knocked his glasses off with her
flowing tresses. As he straightened
the glasses on his nose (constantly
irritated by the smoke and smell of
burning things; funny, it wasn't
even autumn . . .), Garcia began
spinning notes into the air like a
greying master weaver who never

accepted the polyester age, while
Phil smiled to show that the deep,
primal bass licks rattled his teeth
just like everybody else.
Seriously though Charles, the
column was an interesting,
detached account of your first
Dead show. It brought back
feelings and memories of my first
show, too, and I thank you for that
The Dead didn't try to please you,
and you weren't ready to be
pleased anyway. Your column was
written before you went to the
show, and during the show you
simply proofread the text.

No on Reagan library
The committee collecting advice
on the Reagan library, center and

museum have had the grace to
solicit opinions from librarians, a
rare and welcome courtesy, since
members of the staff — the institu
tion's second largest constituency
are all too seldom consulted on
policy decisions affecting the Uni
versity at large. I thus feel offic iall\
invited to join the fray.
A Reagan library and center
would most likely become a magnet
for scholars and researchers in
ideological accord with its subject
and thereby further tend to
alienate those of differing views.
Stanford is even now not always
thought of as host to the full spec
trum of ideologies. Acting as the
home to a Reagan monument would
merely tend to exacerbate this
image outside — and the reality of it
here.
Nor do I have much faith that the
library would serve "as an archival
depository for all of the papers and
other media of record" (the com
mittee's words, italics mine) of this
administration. In an age in which
governmental lying, deceit and
mythification have become common
practice, one is entitled to doubt
that what would get deposited in
such a library would meet the
above description. It is altogether
possible that the present White
House staff has learned some
valuable lessons from the discom
fiture of some of their predeces
sors and that a good bit of material
of interest to scholars routinely
finds its way into the shredder
rather than the archives. The re
sulting collection might therefore
not quite have the breadth and
diversity one normally associates
with the idea of a valid research
library.
The thought of a museum is ap
palling. A museum of what — of 1981
Adolfos? Of White House china? Of
school lunches made of ketchup?
Or, in modest imitation of a
Napoleon exhibit in the Musee de
I'Armee in Paris, of Ronald
Reagan's fingernail clippings?
For the people of Palo Alto, a citv
that has made mighty efforts to
preserve its residential character,
the thought of what the influx of
some 500,000 persons a year — and
their cars — would do is not a beguil
ing one — except, of course, to those
who own a restaurant or motel.
For the residents of the sur
rounding communities, the pro
posed complex would be a
scourge. For the University it
would be a disgrace. I sincerely
hope that those who make the
choice will see more honor in the
rejection of this dubious offer than
in its acceptance.

Student pets
On campus this past summer I
witnessed with astonishment the
death of an abandoned cat. I will
not subject the reader to the
details of its death, but it was starv
ing and had untreated wounds
from a fight. It was one of ap
parently a substantial number of
cats which have "graduated" from
Stanford student living quarters to
"make it on their own" in the wild.
Even in its condition, it was pretty
and appealing and quite unafraid of
people.
When the Humane Society
arrived to end its pathetic condi
tion, they told me sadly of the many
animals they find on campus starv
ing, dying of abscesses from fights,
or the victims of raccoons and
other natural forces these
presumably student pets are incom
petent to handle on their own. In
most cases, as in the one I saw, the
death is prolonged and extremely
painful.
Now that nesting instincts are
strong on The Farm, with students
lonesome for their pets at home or
their lovers at Princeton, may I
plead for long-term planning for
any adoptive creature: If you can
not take it away or give it away
when you leave, please make do
with a teddy bear.
