# Quad revamping will soon add splash of color

### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
The Inner Quad Courtyard will
become a little more green and a lot
more red if a renovation plan
developed by the Project Manage
ment Office is accepted later this
year by two University review
boards.
The project, which is projected to
cost $828,000 and to begin sometime
next summer, is on the agenda to be
discussed by the Administrative
Council Nov. 16 and the Board of
Trustees Dec. 12.
The Project Management Office's
plans, developed this summer, call
for enlarging the eight planting
circles in the Quad from 56 feet in
diameter to 90 feet. These will be
surrounded by three-foot concrete
seat walls and they will contain grass
as well as various types of trees and
other plants.
Also, the North-South and East-
West pathways will be repaved, and
the remaining area of the Quad will
be surfaced with red brick.
Under the management office's
plans, motor vehicles will be
prohibited from the Inner Quad
area once the project is completed,
in order to preserve the "relaxed"
nature of the courtyard and to alle
viate the damage caused by such
vehicles. And although bicycle traf
fic will continue to use the two path
ways, all bike racks in the courtyard
will be removed and bicyclists will
be encouraged to park between the
buildings just outside the Quad.
Also, the plans call for the elimi
nation of the current "prison yard"
lighting and its replacement with
lamps placed in the concrete seat
vvalfs. These, project manager Max
Mazenko says, will "open up the
space visually" by lighting areas of
the courtyard not presently lit by
the floodlamps, which are located at
the points where the two pathways
cross the walls of the Quad.
As far back as 1914, the son of
Frederick Olmsted, who planned
the layout of the campus, expressed
dismay at the "disagreeable"

surface of the Inner Qua d .
However, until last year money
could never be found in the Univer
sity budget to repair the courtyard.
At that time several anonymous
donors targeted $1 million specifi
cally for repair of the Inner Quad,
and plans for renovation of the area
were drawn up. These plans went
through a design analysis stage last
spring, during which the landscape
architects for the project, Anthony
Gazzardo and Associates of San
Francisco, presented three ver
sions of the project. At a meeting of
the Advisory Committee for the
project on Aug. 1, one of the three
was approved and returned to Gaz
zardo with the Committee's revi
sions.
The Project Management Office
has begun a community information
program on the project, aimed es
pecially at students. Working with
the ASSU student affairs committee,
Mazenko hopes to include students
in the project as much as possible.
Toward this goal he will place the
plans for the courtyard in Tresidder
Union, set up an information booth
on the project in While Plaza and
arrange a series of community
meetings to discuss the project.
After the outreach effort ends,
the plans revised and final details on
the project decided, the schematic
designs for the project will return
to the Administrative Council for its
approval.
Although little opposition has ap
peared to the current plan, one
possible opponent might have been
Olmsted himself, who was also the
designer of New York's Central
Park and San Francisco's Golden
Gate Park. In his recommendations
for the Inner Quad, he suggested
that grass not be used because it
could not be properly irrigated.
However, modern technology has
eliminated this concern, and
Mazenko feels that the plan, al
though not exactly what Olmsted
envisioned, is "true at least in con
cept to the original Olmsted idea."
