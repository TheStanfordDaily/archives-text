## Cardinal soccer team scores 3 times in last 20 minutes to beat San Diego 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
The Stanford men's soccer
team made yesterday's game
exciting by waiting until the
final 20 minutes to break a 1-1
deadlock with San Diego State
and go on to win 4-2.
Coming into the game, Stan
ford chose to use the same
four-player midfield system
that was effective in its previ

ous game against Fullerton
State. Sure enough, the same
type of play got the Cardinal
its first goal in the first 10
minutes of play.
"In practice we've been
working on quick shooting on
the ground," said Robby
West, the star of the after
noon. "I just shot the ball
hard on the ground and when
it's going on the turf fast

enough, something usually
happens."
What happened was that
West shot a bullet which was
slightly deflected by a
defender into the goal mouth
However, one goal was not
enough and San Diego began
to come back.
On a pass from San Diego's
Steve Maxwell, Doug Nealy
took the ball on his chest,
leapt backwards and ham
mered the ball home with a
spectacular bicycle kick. "It
was more like a sideways
kick," explained a modest
Nealy. "The goalie didn't even
see it until it was already by
him."
At the beginning of the half,
tension began to mount. Both
teams were threatening, but
neither could score.
Finally, the Cardinal's Wal
ter Kingson drove towards
the corner and centered the
ball to Michael Mossmer.
Coming out of nowhere, Mos
smer ripped the net to give
Stanford the lead for good.
"The ball was right in front of
me," he said. "I was wide
open so I volleyed in the near
post."
Without taking credit from
Mossmer's smashing goal,
Coach Nelson Lodge deserves
his share of praise. "Our two

man up system wasn't
working," Lodge explained.
"Midway through the second
half we changed. Instead of
looking for the open space we
created the space.
After Stanford took the lead
they had confidence on their
side. On the third goal, lorge
Titinger simply beat two men
with sheer speed. He broke
away at half-field and took the
ball all the way in for the score
to make it 3-1.
The Aztecs, however, cut
Stanford's lead to 3-2 with 12
minutes left by connecting on
a penalty kick. In the final
minutes of the game, things
got a bit out of control and
two players were issued red
cards and consequently
ejected.
West scored the Card's final
goal in the final minute of play.
"I called for Tom Rafalovich to
flick it in and I jumped over a
couple of guys to get my head
on it,"he said.
Stanford finished the after
noon with a quite respectable
6-2-1 record but lost Cassio
Conceicao due to a red card.
He will be prohibited from
playing in the Cardinal's up
coming game against
Westmont College.
