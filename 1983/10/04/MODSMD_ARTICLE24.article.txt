Dodgers vs. Phillies

Los Angeles — The aging Philadelphia
Phillies and the young Los Angeles
MDo'lgers now can forget the troubles and
turmoil of their summer of 1983 and con
centrate on tonight's opener of the Na
tional League Championship Series.
The Phillies overcame a July managerial
change, constantly shifting lineups,
anemic hatting, and public bit kering to
win the NL East title.
v The Dodgers survived a prolonged
slump, the loss of their first- and second
string catchers to injuries, the continuing
personal problems of relief pitc her Steve
Hpwe, and a long period of adjustment
by some of their young players to win the
West title.
The managers, Philadelphia's Paul
Owens and Los Angeles' Tom Lasorda,
• feel vindicated l>y the results.
"I came down here with some idea as to
what it was going to take for us to win,"
said Owens, the Phillies' general
manager who assumed the managing
chores when Pat Corrales was fired on
July 18. "My own satisfaction in this is that
those ideas worked."
| Lasorda, who had guided the Dodgers
to four division titles in his seven years at
the helm, said, "ll was a special season
for us. We had a lot of bad times to
overcome and we did."
Heading into the best-of-five league
championship op en e r at D o d g e r
Stadium, Owens and the Phillies might
like to forget something else about the
past regular season — they lost 11 of 12 to
the Dodgers.
"Everytime we faced them we were on

a down cycle," said Owens. "We usually
play the Dodgers tough, particularly at
home. Even if we had split with them, we
might have run away with the division
sooner than we did."
Philadelphia third baseman Mike
Schmidt said: "I think they just got on top
of us, so that everytime we hit a ground
ball in the hole, they stuck out their glove
and it went right out. Everytime there was
a close call, they got the call."
White Sox vs. Orioles
Baltimore — The Chicago White Sox and
Baltimore Orioles, similar teams with
similar records, will begin the best-of
