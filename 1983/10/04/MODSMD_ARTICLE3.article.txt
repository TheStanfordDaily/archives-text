# Arrow to chair Advisory Board
## 
### ELISE CHAPIN Staff writer 
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow, a
Nobel Laureate for his work in
equilibrium theo r y, has been
elected chairman of the Advisory
Board.
Arrow, who won the Nobel Prize
in 1972, was re-elected to the board
last spring and to the chairmanship
in early September. He was vice
chairman last year.
The Advisory Board is consulted
after a promotion request has been
reviewed by each department and
the provost. The provost recom
mends a decision to the president
who then asks the board's opinion.
This is the final step before the re
quest is presented to the Board of
Trustees.
One representative from each of
the schools within the University
serves on the Advisory Board. Ihe
group advises University President
Donald Kennedy about professorial
appointments. While the board has
no legal ability to enforce its recom
mendations, Arrow said its advice is
usually followed.
The vice-chairman tor this year is
George Dekker, a professor of En
glish. Prof. Eugene Webb of the
School of Business will serve as sec
retary.

Because the makeup ot the board
has not changed very much in the
past two years, Dekker said he ex
pects tew changes this year. "We
seem to be re-elected. We had one
new member last year and one this
year," said Dekker. Each member is
elected for a three-year term by his
colleagues, with one third of the
board elected each year.
Other board members are James
Adams, a professor in the School of
Engineering, Robert Chase, a Medi
cal School professor, Sydney Drell,
a professor at the Stanford Linear

Accelerator Center and Dirk
Walecka, a physics professor.
During the monthly meetings,
which usually last three hours, Ar
row said the board reviews an
average of 25 requests for promo
tions. Dekker said the board "tries
to see whether it's a convincing
case."
The time spent in the actual
meeting is only part of a member's
commitment. Each file that is pro
posed is read by either the chair
man or the vice-chairman, in addi
tion to another committee member.
Dekker said while the extra work
detracts from time spent teaching or
researching, he stressed that being
on the board "is one of the jobs that
I've really enjoyed doing for Stan
ford. It really is an honor."
Dekker, who is on sabbatical this
quarter, said, "On the one hand it's
a time-consuming job, but it's one of
the most interesting jobs in the Uni
versity. It gives an individual on the
board a wonderful opportunity to
see what's happening."
Arrow received his B.S. in social
science from City College in New
York and his M.A. from Columbia in
1940 and 1941 respectively. He com
pleted his doctoral work for Colum
bia in 1951 before joining the faculty
here. In the 19(i0s, Arrow went to
Harvard., but returned to the Uni
versity in 1979.
