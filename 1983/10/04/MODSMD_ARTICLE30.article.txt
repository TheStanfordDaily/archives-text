# Wham! U.K.— Fantastic
## 
### 
This debut album from
two 19 year-old Britainers
is a shoe-in for the KZSU
picks. Featuring hits like
"Bad Boys,'' "Young
Guns," "Club Tropicana,"
and the cocky "Wham
Rap," it is definitely taking
the airwaves by storm.
While at times it mav be dif

ficult to take their bac
chanalian attitudes serious
ly, Wham! U.K. music is cer
tainly worth listening to. It
is the ideal record to turn
that dull "standing'' party
into a wild dancing one.
Look tor a U.S. tour from
these guys in December or
january.—Frank Bird
