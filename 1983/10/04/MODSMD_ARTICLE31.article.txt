### 
It you haven't heard of
Big Country yet, you've
probably been in hiberna
tion all summer. Big
Country is a British band
that has been getting big
ger and better reviews
from every realm of the
music world. The three
main cuts on the album in
clude "In a Big Country,"
"Fields of Fire,'' and the

new U.K. release,
"Chance." To tully under
stand this band's sound, lis
ten to it personally. Trust
us. We think you'll really
like this country/Scottish
Folk Percussion Distortion
guitar combo. They've just
started their U.S. tour and
should be arriving in the
Bay area in a month or so.
