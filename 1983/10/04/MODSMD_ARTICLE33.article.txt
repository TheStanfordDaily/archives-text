# Kommunity — The Vision and the Voice
## 
### 
This disk lives up to the
label's repution of present
ing the best in avant-garde
post-punk doom-and
gloom bands. Kommunity
F.K. uses vocals and
layered drums reminiscent
of early Killing Joke
combined with driving

guitar and synth textures to
produce a hypnotic sound.
What results is a compel
ling musical style that
demands listening from any
post-punk enthusiast. If
you're looking for a true
alternative sound, this is
it. —Johnathan Pregler
