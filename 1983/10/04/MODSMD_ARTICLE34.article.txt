# Santana brings rare, special music
## 
### STEFAN MALMOLI 
There is something very
unique and \er\ magic al about
listening to beautiful music on
a gorgeous day. In such a
case, one is able to escape the
rigors ot work and life, and
transcend into the spiritual
realm of the music. Surely,
such concerts are rare oc
curences because very few
bands can generate (or care
to generate) this ambiance of
complete m us i c a I c o m -
munalism.
However, this past Sunday,
Frost Amphitheater (yes, early
library dwellers, there are
concerts on c a m p us this
year!) was host to the band,
Santana, and the audience was
blessed with one of these rare
and special concerts. When
Carlos Santana struck the first

note of his guitar in the shim
mering Stanford sun, he
struck a chord that commun
icated not only his musical ex
cellence, but also his desire to
unite and captivate his lis
teners. Bv the end ot San
tana's t vv o -hour- a 11 d - 4 5 -
minute performance, there
was not one body that hadn't
been absorbed into the uplift
ing aura ot the band's music.
Santana, the group, is the
most famous proponent of
"Latin- rock." The band
utilizes its various ethnic
b.u kt'rmind- Mat k. Mexu an
v\bite to its hrst advantage h\
ulending a mixtuie ot u>ck,
blues, and Latin m us i c .
Powered by the blistering
guitar ot the band's leader,
Carlos Santana, success has
been prevalent ever since

thev emerged out of the Son
Francisco ballroom scene ol
the late l%()s. However, the
ke\ to theii suciess has been
Carlos Santana s unwilling
ness to limit or categorize his
music. He has continually
striven to improve his meth
ods, his styles, and his ability
to communicate the joys ot
music.
a\i Frost, Santana and his
band thoroughly enthralled
the crowd. Playing with more
verve and incorporating the
harder blues stance that was
the forte ot the band's early
career, Santana was in su
pieme form. Opening up with
a rollicking Latin-flavored in
strumental and then continu
ing into the ever popular
rocker, 'Nobody I Can
Depend On,'' the band
showed their abilities to en
rapture the audience. Dis
playing a diverse array of tal
ent and an ability to play in al
most any style of music, San
tana was able to appeal to and
exceed the expectations of the
audience. Whether the band
pI ayed blues (a beautiful
rendition of the Elmore James
classic, "Shake Your Money
Maker" was the hardest and
finest song of the afternoon),
soul, jazz, Latin chants, rock
(such as "Havana Moon," the
Chuck Berry song which was
the title track of Carlos San
tana's last solo album), or San
tana's own mixture of all of the
above (such as "Open Invita
tion" and "Black Magic Wo
man"), the band never failed
to reach new heights as the
day went on.
What was personally satisfy
ing (and what I think was the
most satisfying aspect for the
performers themselves) was
the incredible warmth and
camaraderie that developed
throughout the audience. The
crowd at Frost was quite a
multi-racial one and to see

such a crowd dancing without
inhibitions with one another
just proves how powerful
music, especially Santana s,
can be.
Of course, to ac hieve sue h a
unique crowd reaction, the
band has to be exceptional
and Santana is |ust that Karelv
does a band display such an
array of talent as Santana
does. The band is a precise,
tight outfit which includes a
rowdy three-piece conga and
percussion section, the great
drumming of Graham Lear
(who excelled on the 30-
minute instrumental "Soul
Sacrifice"), and the soulful
singing ol Greg Walker (the
original Santana from the ear
ly 19705).
And then there was Carlos
Santana and his guitar. He
shined throughout the whole
afternoon especially on the
sensual instrumental
"Europa" and the steaming
"She's Not There." The ten
sion that he could create with
just one note being held tor 10
or IS seconds, was the work
of a master.
The opening band for San
tana was a Texas blues band
called the Fabulous Thunder
birds (who, incidentally,
backed up Carlos Santana on
his last album, Havana Moon).
The band's key strengths
were solid understanding ot
the blues and boogie idiom.
Led by the Clapton styled
guitarist, Jimmy Vaughan, and
the mean harmonica-playing
lead vocalist, Kim Wilson, the
band was so accomplished
that they were invited out to
participate in a "Super Boogie
jam" (as Carlos called it) at the
end of Santana's set. I his was
a beautiful communal event as
all the musicians joined to
gether to uplift the crowd
through music. It was a fitting
finish for Santana and their
musical excellence.

However, this past Sunday,
Frost Amphitheater (yes, early
library dwellers, there are
concerts on c a m p us this
year!) was host to the band,
Santana, and the audience was
blessed with one of these rare
and special concerts. When
Carlos Santana struck the first

note of his guitar in the shim
mering Stanford sun, he
struck a chord that commun
icated not only his musical ex
cellence, but also his desire to
unite and captivate his lis
teners. Bv the end ot San
tana's t vv o -hour- a 11 d - 4 5 -
minute performance, there
was not one body that hadn't
been absorbed into the uplift
ing aura ot the band's music.
Santana, the group, is the
most famous proponent of
"Latin- rock." The band
utilizes its various ethnic
b.u kt'rmind- Mat k. Mexu an
v\bite to its hrst advantage h\
ulending a mixtuie ot u>ck,
blues, and Latin m us i c .
Powered by the blistering
guitar ot the band's leader,
Carlos Santana, success has
been prevalent ever since

thev emerged out of the Son
Francisco ballroom scene ol
the late l%()s. However, the
ke\ to theii suciess has been
Carlos Santana s unwilling
ness to limit or categorize his
music. He has continually
striven to improve his meth
ods, his styles, and his ability
to communicate the joys ot
music.
a\i Frost, Santana and his
band thoroughly enthralled
the crowd. Playing with more
verve and incorporating the
harder blues stance that was
the forte ot the band's early
career, Santana was in su
pieme form. Opening up with
a rollicking Latin-flavored in
strumental and then continu
ing into the ever popular
rocker, 'Nobody I Can
Depend On,'' the band
showed their abilities to en
rapture the audience. Dis
playing a diverse array of tal
ent and an ability to play in al
most any style of music, San
tana was able to appeal to and
exceed the expectations of the
audience. Whether the band
pI ayed blues (a beautiful
rendition of the Elmore James
classic, "Shake Your Money
Maker" was the hardest and
finest song of the afternoon),
soul, jazz, Latin chants, rock
(such as "Havana Moon," the
Chuck Berry song which was
the title track of Carlos San
tana's last solo album), or San
tana's own mixture of all of the
above (such as "Open Invita
tion" and "Black Magic Wo
man"), the band never failed
to reach new heights as the
day went on.
What was personally satisfy
ing (and what I think was the
most satisfying aspect for the
performers themselves) was
the incredible warmth and
camaraderie that developed
throughout the audience. The
crowd at Frost was quite a
multi-racial one and to see

such a crowd dancing without
inhibitions with one another
just proves how powerful
music, especially Santana s,
can be.
Of course, to ac hieve sue h a
unique crowd reaction, the
band has to be exceptional
and Santana is |ust that Karelv
does a band display such an
array of talent as Santana
does. The band is a precise,
tight outfit which includes a
rowdy three-piece conga and
percussion section, the great
drumming of Graham Lear
(who excelled on the 30-
minute instrumental "Soul
Sacrifice"), and the soulful
singing ol Greg Walker (the
original Santana from the ear
ly 19705).
And then there was Carlos
Santana and his guitar. He
shined throughout the whole
afternoon especially on the
sensual instrumental
"Europa" and the steaming
"She's Not There." The ten
sion that he could create with
just one note being held tor 10
or IS seconds, was the work
of a master.
The opening band for San
tana was a Texas blues band
called the Fabulous Thunder
birds (who, incidentally,
backed up Carlos Santana on
his last album, Havana Moon).
The band's key strengths
were solid understanding ot
the blues and boogie idiom.
Led by the Clapton styled
guitarist, Jimmy Vaughan, and
the mean harmonica-playing
lead vocalist, Kim Wilson, the
band was so accomplished
that they were invited out to
participate in a "Super Boogie
jam" (as Carlos called it) at the
end of Santana's set. I his was
a beautiful communal event as
all the musicians joined to
gether to uplift the crowd
through music. It was a fitting
finish for Santana and their
musical excellence.

There is something very
unique and \er\ magic al about
listening to beautiful music on
a gorgeous day. In such a
case, one is able to escape the
rigors ot work and life, and
transcend into the spiritual
realm of the music. Surely,
such concerts are rare oc
curences because very few
bands can generate (or care
to generate) this ambiance of
complete m us i c a I c o m -
munalism.
