# 'Best of Broadway' series: the stars come up short
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
It's a musical with everything — comedy,
drama, political satire, singing, dancing,
acting, even cartoons —with a leading lady
who has everything and portrays a char
acter who seems to have everything. But
with all that it has going for it, Woman of
the Year starring Lauren Bacall and
playing as part of the Best of Broadway
series at the Golden Gate Theater in San
Francisco is missing something.
Not that Woman of the Year isn't a good
show. It is. But it's not great, and that's
what's puzzling.
Lauren Bacall has won a Tony Award
for her Woman of the Year portrayal of
Tess Harding, a Barbara-Walters-type
broadcast journalist who knows
everybody who's anybody but can't hold
onto a man. Author Peter Stone won a
Tony for his book version of the musical.
Producer Stewart Lane received a Tony
nomination for the show. Audiences
across the country have raved about this
musical; the experts tell us that Woman
of the Year is great theatre.
To some extent, Woman of the Year
fans have a point.
This musical addresses some very real
problems present in modern society. It is
a story of a very successful woman with a
personal life that is in shambles, and the
story of a man both attracted and

repulsed by a strong woman. The theme
of reversed sexual and social roles oc
curs throughout the production and is
certainly intriguing to a modern audi
ence. But though intriguing, the show
doesn't have any unusual conclusions.
Most people would agree that pursuits
independent of a romantic relationship
are important. Most would also agree
that careers are not the end-all-be-all of
life. Woman of the Year addresses these
points, but it doesn't go much further.
The supporting actors set the stage
aglitter with talent. Harry Cuardino, as
the cartoonist who lambasts Tess in his
strip and eventually marries her, is coolly
entertaining. Emory Bass as Harding's
censorious personal secretary Gerald,
and Kathleen Freeman as Helga, Har
ding's beefy, militaristic house maid are
show-stoppers in their active disapproval
of Harding's marriage to Craig. Some of
the dancers in the corps seem to fuse the
class of Fred Astaire with the sensuous
ness of John Travolta. The choreography
of joe Layton and Tony Charmoli, espe
cially in the"It isn't working" sequence,
showcase the dancer's talent.
The sets throughout the show are as
flashy as the dancers. Set designer Tony
Walton won an Oscar for his designs in
Bob Fosse's All That Jazz and his work on
Woman of the Year is of comparable

quality. I he interaction between the pro
jection of Sam Craig's cartoon chara< ter
"Katz" and the actor portrays the fuzzy
relationship between artist and strip
character more effectively than any song
and dance routine.
All this is terrific , and with all the solid
support it would seem that the show
should be as great as the critic s say it iv
But in fact, Woman of the Year is a little
flat.
Perhaps the production falls flat be
cause there is a lot of support but not
that much glitter at the top. Lauren Bacall
was certainly endowed with dynamism
during the days when she was seen at the
arm of Humphrey Bogart, but she seems
to have faded a bit with age. As a swan
song, Woman of the Year is a valiant ef
fort, and a good one. But Bacall simply
doesn't electrify the audience, though
she had more advance press than an an
ticipated royal visit.
The last two Best of Broadway produc
tions -The King and I and Zorba have also
had high visibility stars (Yul Brynner and
Anthony Quinn) who were accented
while the supporting cast remained un
noticed. Maybe if the producers of the
Best of Broadway series were to choose
their leading stars as carefully as their
supporting casts the series would be the
better for it.
