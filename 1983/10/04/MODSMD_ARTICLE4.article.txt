Reagan cancels Philippine trip
Washington — In the face of Philippine political unrest and violence,
President Reagan yesterday scrubbed the Philippines, Indonesia and
Thailand from his November trip to Asia, citing as the official reason
the press of congressional business.
II was clear however, that the Manila leg of the trip was dropped
because Reagan's advisers believed that a visit with Philippine Presi
dent Ferdinand Marcos would be too controversial in the wake of the
assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino on Aug 21.
Reanan still will visit lapan and South Korea as planned, probably
around the dates originally scheduled, Nov. 9-15, White House offi
cials said And future visits to the Philtppinesg, Indonesia and
Thailand could be tacked onto a trip to China that the president in-

tends to make in April, they said
The official reason gi\en for the altered trip was
that Congress now intends to be in session in No
vember and that the tirst two weeks of the month
will be crucial because the lawmakeis will be debat
ing key appropriations bills.
A stopgap spending resolution to keep the go
vernment operating, which Reagan signed
Saturday, will expire Nov. 10.
The White House said that when the \sian trip
originally was scheduled last June Congress ex
pected to recess Oct. 28.
But one Republican congressional son ct who is
a Reagan ally, said that the White F-loiis. had known
since early August that the lawmakers intended to
stay in session until neark Thanksgiving. He also
said that the stopgap spending resolution could
have been written to expire at Reagan's conveni
ence, if he had requested it. The White House ac
knowledged that the president did i n ittempt to
have the Nov. 10 date changed.
"The congressional session gives the White
House a reason to make the (trip) dc, ision it wanted
to make," said the source, who asked not to be
identified.
Court allows handgun ban
Washington — In an important vie tors tor advocates
of gun control, the Supreme Court yesterday left
the local ordinance prohibiting the possession ot
handguns in Morton Grove, 111., on the books, and
refused to take up complaints that sue a ban is un
constitutional.
The justices, on the opening dav of a new term, let
stand a ruling by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Ap
peals in Chicago that gave a narrow interpretation
to the Second Amendment s g,i nte i right to
keep and bear arms. The lown r: lc ided that
that provision was intend
Congress from interfering with tl >112 states to
form their own militias and not to insure an absolute
right to private gun ownership.
The Supreme Court's action does not set a prece
dent and does not signitv that th«. trices agree with
all the reasoning of the appeals a . t Hut it means
that, at least for now, other locate govern
ments will be free to adopt limits the possession

o! handguns without tearing that by doing so the\
art> \: lating private c itizens Second Amendment
rights.
Morton Groves gun-control ordinance, enacted
in 1%1 was the first ban on handguns in the nation.
Since its pass a g e , a tew other cities and
municipalities have passed similar legislation. San
Francisco imposed a ban on sale or possession ot
handguns last sear, but the California Court of Ap
peal ruled that the cit\ s ordinance conflicted with
state laws allowing firearms to be kept in businesses
and private homes without a license.
Mondav - action will have no effect on the San
Franc isco dispute Ihe ruling the Morton Grove
case does not present state governments from pas
sing their own legislation guaranteeing a right to
gun ownership or prohibiting cities from banning
handguns Ihtiv the practical effect of the courts
action will be to shift the immediate battles over gun
control to ah councils and to state legislatures and
courts across the nation.
Arms talks to include 'build-down'
Washington — President Reagan will announce
toda\ moditications ot the U.S. proposal at the stra
tegic arms talks that will incorporate the concept
build-down. U.S. officials said yesterday.
Under the "build-down" concept, which is
backed b\ arms-control supporters, more old nu
clear weapons are retired than new ones are
deployed.
As he provided new instructions to U.S.
negotiators who will resume the Strategic Arms Re
duction Talks in Geneva, Switzerland, Thursday,
Reagan also was expected to make some concession
to Soviet wishes to discuss limits on bombers and
air-launched c rinse missiles, officials said. Until now
the U.S. proposal has been largely limited to ballis
tic missiles.
\ group of kev congressmen, briefed by Reagan
veste r d a v on the new START position, told
re pi <i !i s later that they were enthusiastic about
ihe new approach. Fhey said it would help ensure
continued support in Congress for the controver
sial MX missile.
The chances of getting an arms control agree
ment in (Reagan's) first term are enhanced
signiticantK b\ the new proposal, said Sen. Sam
Sunn (D-Ca.i, an influential member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.

And son. Charles Percy (R-lll.), chairman of the
senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said, "This pro
posal is the most dramatic opportunity it the Soviet
Union is realK serious about arms control. The
world will judge it by its response.
Percv also called the bipartisan input into the new
proposal .1 historic moment," and predicted that, if
achieved, a resulting Soviet-American agreement
would be ratified, unlike the SALT II treaty, which
never was approved bv Congress. Reagan also met
vesterdav with members of the expert Scowcrott
Commission, which advises him on strategic arms.
Afterwards, the commission chairman, Brent
Scowi rott who was a national security adviser to
President lord, said that the new Reagan proposals
are "a verv useful step forward."
Court to decide gay rights issue
Washington — 1 he Supreme Court yesterday set the
stage for what is potentially the most far-reaching
lest of gav rights in a decade by agreeing to decide
whether a New York law used to prevent
homosexuals from gathering in public places is un
constitutional.
Ihe court agreed to hear an appeal by
prosecutors in Buffalo, N.Y., from a ruling by the
New York Court of Appeals striking down the law.
The justices probably will hear arguments in the
case earlv next year and hand down a decision by
luly.
The provision that the court will review
prohibited loitering fro the purpose of engaging in
sodomy. In Buffalo, the law was enforced both
against homosexuals and against female prostitutes
who waited for male customers on the city's streets.
Ihe New York Court voided the law primarily be
cause it had previously ruled that state officials may
not prohibit sexual behavior conducted in private
between consenting adults.
Over the past 20 years, the Supreme Court has
ruled that a right to privacy implicit in the U.S. Con
stitution protects the right of an individual to use
birth control devices, to keep obscene literature at
home or to have an abortion in the early months of
pregnancy.
However, in the past decade, the justices have
repeatedly turned down all suggestions that they
review whether state sodomy laws violate that right
to privacy. Ihe New York case will be the first time
the court will review the question.

It is not certain that the court will rule on the
privacy issue. The prosecutors who urged the Su
preme Court to hear the lase argued that even it
states may not prohibit acts of sodomy in private,
they still may make it illegal lor individuals to meet in
public and arrange to engage in sodomy. It is possi
ble the justices will rule on the validity ot a
"loitering" law without deciding whether
homosexuals are protected by a right to privacy.
But the New York Court ot Appeals concluded
that "the object of the loitering statute is to punish
conduct anticipatory to the ail ot consensual
sodomy." The state court reasoned that because it
had already ruled that bans on sodomy are uncon
stitutional, it followed that the loitering law should
be struck down, too.
Helms filibusters King holiday
Washington — Accusing Dr. Martin Luther king of
widespread Communist connections, Sen. lesse
Helms (R-N.c.) launched a filibuster yesterday
against House-passed legislation to honor the slain
civil rights leader with a national holiday.
Helms' attack, which included a charge that the
late President Kennedy warned king against as
sociating with Marxists, brought an angry retort
from Kennedy's brother, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.).
Allegations of King's involvement with Commu
nists were "first raised by archsegregationists bent
on retaining the rule of racism, Kennedy said.

Court to decide gay rights issue
Washington — 1 he Supreme Court yesterday set the
stage for what is potentially the most far-reaching
lest of gav rights in a decade by agreeing to decide
whether a New York law used to prevent
homosexuals from gathering in public places is un
constitutional.
Ihe court agreed to hear an appeal by
prosecutors in Buffalo, N.Y., from a ruling by the
New York Court of Appeals striking down the law.
The justices probably will hear arguments in the
case earlv next year and hand down a decision by
luly.
The provision that the court will review
prohibited loitering fro the purpose of engaging in
sodomy. In Buffalo, the law was enforced both
against homosexuals and against female prostitutes
who waited for male customers on the city's streets.
Ihe New York Court voided the law primarily be
cause it had previously ruled that state officials may
not prohibit sexual behavior conducted in private
between consenting adults.
Over the past 20 years, the Supreme Court has
ruled that a right to privacy implicit in the U.S. Con
stitution protects the right of an individual to use
birth control devices, to keep obscene literature at
home or to have an abortion in the early months of
pregnancy.
However, in the past decade, the justices have
repeatedly turned down all suggestions that they
review whether state sodomy laws violate that right
to privacy. Ihe New York case will be the first time
the court will review the question.

It is not certain that the court will rule on the
privacy issue. The prosecutors who urged the Su
preme Court to hear the lase argued that even it
states may not prohibit acts of sodomy in private,
they still may make it illegal lor individuals to meet in
public and arrange to engage in sodomy. It is possi
ble the justices will rule on the validity ot a
"loitering" law without deciding whether
homosexuals are protected by a right to privacy.
But the New York Court ot Appeals concluded
that "the object of the loitering statute is to punish
conduct anticipatory to the ail ot consensual
sodomy." The state court reasoned that because it
had already ruled that bans on sodomy are uncon
stitutional, it followed that the loitering law should
be struck down, too.
Helms filibusters King holiday
Washington — Accusing Dr. Martin Luther king of
widespread Communist connections, Sen. lesse
Helms (R-N.c.) launched a filibuster yesterday
against House-passed legislation to honor the slain
civil rights leader with a national holiday.
Helms' attack, which included a charge that the
late President Kennedy warned king against as
sociating with Marxists, brought an angry retort
from Kennedy's brother, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.).
Allegations of King's involvement with Commu
nists were "first raised by archsegregationists bent
on retaining the rule of racism, Kennedy said.

Reagan cancels Philippine trip
Washington — In the face of Philippine political unrest and violence,
President Reagan yesterday scrubbed the Philippines, Indonesia and
Thailand from his November trip to Asia, citing as the official reason
the press of congressional business.
II was clear however, that the Manila leg of the trip was dropped
because Reagan's advisers believed that a visit with Philippine Presi
dent Ferdinand Marcos would be too controversial in the wake of the
assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino on Aug 21.
Reanan still will visit lapan and South Korea as planned, probably
around the dates originally scheduled, Nov. 9-15, White House offi
cials said And future visits to the Philtppinesg, Indonesia and
Thailand could be tacked onto a trip to China that the president in-

tends to make in April, they said
The official reason gi\en for the altered trip was
that Congress now intends to be in session in No
vember and that the tirst two weeks of the month
will be crucial because the lawmakeis will be debat
ing key appropriations bills.
A stopgap spending resolution to keep the go
vernment operating, which Reagan signed
Saturday, will expire Nov. 10.
The White House said that when the \sian trip
originally was scheduled last June Congress ex
pected to recess Oct. 28.
But one Republican congressional son ct who is
a Reagan ally, said that the White F-loiis. had known
since early August that the lawmakers intended to
stay in session until neark Thanksgiving. He also
said that the stopgap spending resolution could
have been written to expire at Reagan's conveni
ence, if he had requested it. The White House ac
knowledged that the president did i n ittempt to
have the Nov. 10 date changed.
"The congressional session gives the White
House a reason to make the (trip) dc, ision it wanted
to make," said the source, who asked not to be
identified.
Court allows handgun ban
Washington — In an important vie tors tor advocates
of gun control, the Supreme Court yesterday left
the local ordinance prohibiting the possession ot
handguns in Morton Grove, 111., on the books, and
refused to take up complaints that sue a ban is un
constitutional.
The justices, on the opening dav of a new term, let
stand a ruling by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Ap
peals in Chicago that gave a narrow interpretation
to the Second Amendment s g,i nte i right to
keep and bear arms. The lown r: lc ided that
that provision was intend
Congress from interfering with tl >112 states to
form their own militias and not to insure an absolute
right to private gun ownership.
The Supreme Court's action does not set a prece
dent and does not signitv that th«. trices agree with
all the reasoning of the appeals a . t Hut it means
that, at least for now, other locate govern
ments will be free to adopt limits the possession

o! handguns without tearing that by doing so the\
art> \: lating private c itizens Second Amendment
rights.
Morton Groves gun-control ordinance, enacted
in 1%1 was the first ban on handguns in the nation.
Since its pass a g e , a tew other cities and
municipalities have passed similar legislation. San
Francisco imposed a ban on sale or possession ot
handguns last sear, but the California Court of Ap
peal ruled that the cit\ s ordinance conflicted with
state laws allowing firearms to be kept in businesses
and private homes without a license.
Mondav - action will have no effect on the San
Franc isco dispute Ihe ruling the Morton Grove
case does not present state governments from pas
sing their own legislation guaranteeing a right to
gun ownership or prohibiting cities from banning
handguns Ihtiv the practical effect of the courts
action will be to shift the immediate battles over gun
control to ah councils and to state legislatures and
courts across the nation.

Reagan cancels Philippine trip
Washington — In the face of Philippine political unrest and violence,
President Reagan yesterday scrubbed the Philippines, Indonesia and
Thailand from his November trip to Asia, citing as the official reason
the press of congressional business.
II was clear however, that the Manila leg of the trip was dropped
because Reagan's advisers believed that a visit with Philippine Presi
dent Ferdinand Marcos would be too controversial in the wake of the
assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino on Aug 21.
Reanan still will visit lapan and South Korea as planned, probably
around the dates originally scheduled, Nov. 9-15, White House offi
cials said And future visits to the Philtppinesg, Indonesia and
Thailand could be tacked onto a trip to China that the president in-

tends to make in April, they said
The official reason gi\en for the altered trip was
that Congress now intends to be in session in No
vember and that the tirst two weeks of the month
will be crucial because the lawmakeis will be debat
ing key appropriations bills.
A stopgap spending resolution to keep the go
vernment operating, which Reagan signed
Saturday, will expire Nov. 10.
The White House said that when the \sian trip
originally was scheduled last June Congress ex
pected to recess Oct. 28.
But one Republican congressional son ct who is
a Reagan ally, said that the White F-loiis. had known
since early August that the lawmakers intended to
stay in session until neark Thanksgiving. He also
said that the stopgap spending resolution could
have been written to expire at Reagan's conveni
ence, if he had requested it. The White House ac
knowledged that the president did i n ittempt to
have the Nov. 10 date changed.
"The congressional session gives the White
House a reason to make the (trip) dc, ision it wanted
to make," said the source, who asked not to be
identified.
Court allows handgun ban
Washington — In an important vie tors tor advocates
of gun control, the Supreme Court yesterday left
the local ordinance prohibiting the possession ot
handguns in Morton Grove, 111., on the books, and
refused to take up complaints that sue a ban is un
constitutional.
The justices, on the opening dav of a new term, let
stand a ruling by the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Ap
peals in Chicago that gave a narrow interpretation
to the Second Amendment s g,i nte i right to
keep and bear arms. The lown r: lc ided that
that provision was intend
Congress from interfering with tl >112 states to
form their own militias and not to insure an absolute
right to private gun ownership.
The Supreme Court's action does not set a prece
dent and does not signitv that th«. trices agree with
all the reasoning of the appeals a . t Hut it means
that, at least for now, other locate govern
ments will be free to adopt limits the possession

o! handguns without tearing that by doing so the\
art> \: lating private c itizens Second Amendment
rights.
Morton Groves gun-control ordinance, enacted
in 1%1 was the first ban on handguns in the nation.
Since its pass a g e , a tew other cities and
municipalities have passed similar legislation. San
Francisco imposed a ban on sale or possession ot
handguns last sear, but the California Court of Ap
peal ruled that the cit\ s ordinance conflicted with
state laws allowing firearms to be kept in businesses
and private homes without a license.
Mondav - action will have no effect on the San
Franc isco dispute Ihe ruling the Morton Grove
case does not present state governments from pas
sing their own legislation guaranteeing a right to
gun ownership or prohibiting cities from banning
handguns Ihtiv the practical effect of the courts
action will be to shift the immediate battles over gun
control to ah councils and to state legislatures and
courts across the nation.
Arms talks to include 'build-down'
Washington — President Reagan will announce
toda\ moditications ot the U.S. proposal at the stra
tegic arms talks that will incorporate the concept
build-down. U.S. officials said yesterday.
Under the "build-down" concept, which is
backed b\ arms-control supporters, more old nu
clear weapons are retired than new ones are
deployed.
As he provided new instructions to U.S.
negotiators who will resume the Strategic Arms Re
duction Talks in Geneva, Switzerland, Thursday,
Reagan also was expected to make some concession
to Soviet wishes to discuss limits on bombers and
air-launched c rinse missiles, officials said. Until now
the U.S. proposal has been largely limited to ballis
tic missiles.
\ group of kev congressmen, briefed by Reagan
veste r d a v on the new START position, told
re pi <i !i s later that they were enthusiastic about
ihe new approach. Fhey said it would help ensure
continued support in Congress for the controver
sial MX missile.
The chances of getting an arms control agree
ment in (Reagan's) first term are enhanced
signiticantK b\ the new proposal, said Sen. Sam
Sunn (D-Ca.i, an influential member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.

And son. Charles Percy (R-lll.), chairman of the
senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said, "This pro
posal is the most dramatic opportunity it the Soviet
Union is realK serious about arms control. The
world will judge it by its response.
Percv also called the bipartisan input into the new
proposal .1 historic moment," and predicted that, if
achieved, a resulting Soviet-American agreement
would be ratified, unlike the SALT II treaty, which
never was approved bv Congress. Reagan also met
vesterdav with members of the expert Scowcrott
Commission, which advises him on strategic arms.
Afterwards, the commission chairman, Brent
Scowi rott who was a national security adviser to
President lord, said that the new Reagan proposals
are "a verv useful step forward."
Court to decide gay rights issue
Washington — 1 he Supreme Court yesterday set the
stage for what is potentially the most far-reaching
lest of gav rights in a decade by agreeing to decide
whether a New York law used to prevent
homosexuals from gathering in public places is un
constitutional.
Ihe court agreed to hear an appeal by
prosecutors in Buffalo, N.Y., from a ruling by the
New York Court of Appeals striking down the law.
The justices probably will hear arguments in the
case earlv next year and hand down a decision by
luly.
The provision that the court will review
prohibited loitering fro the purpose of engaging in
sodomy. In Buffalo, the law was enforced both
against homosexuals and against female prostitutes
who waited for male customers on the city's streets.
Ihe New York Court voided the law primarily be
cause it had previously ruled that state officials may
not prohibit sexual behavior conducted in private
between consenting adults.
Over the past 20 years, the Supreme Court has
ruled that a right to privacy implicit in the U.S. Con
stitution protects the right of an individual to use
birth control devices, to keep obscene literature at
home or to have an abortion in the early months of
pregnancy.
However, in the past decade, the justices have
repeatedly turned down all suggestions that they
review whether state sodomy laws violate that right
to privacy. Ihe New York case will be the first time
the court will review the question.

It is not certain that the court will rule on the
privacy issue. The prosecutors who urged the Su
preme Court to hear the lase argued that even it
states may not prohibit acts of sodomy in private,
they still may make it illegal lor individuals to meet in
public and arrange to engage in sodomy. It is possi
ble the justices will rule on the validity ot a
"loitering" law without deciding whether
homosexuals are protected by a right to privacy.
But the New York Court ot Appeals concluded
that "the object of the loitering statute is to punish
conduct anticipatory to the ail ot consensual
sodomy." The state court reasoned that because it
had already ruled that bans on sodomy are uncon
stitutional, it followed that the loitering law should
be struck down, too.
Helms filibusters King holiday
Washington — Accusing Dr. Martin Luther king of
widespread Communist connections, Sen. lesse
Helms (R-N.c.) launched a filibuster yesterday
against House-passed legislation to honor the slain
civil rights leader with a national holiday.
Helms' attack, which included a charge that the
late President Kennedy warned king against as
sociating with Marxists, brought an angry retort
from Kennedy's brother, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.).
Allegations of King's involvement with Commu
nists were "first raised by archsegregationists bent
on retaining the rule of racism, Kennedy said.
