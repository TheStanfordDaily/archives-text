# S.F. Bay Area hit hard by AIDS
## 
### MADELINE KIRBACH 
Eleven percent of Americans known to be afflicted
by the killer disease Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) live in the Bay Area, according to
Medical School Prof. Dennis McShane.
Fifteen to 20 persons in Santa Clara County have
been treated for the disease, according to Dr.
David Stewart of the AIDS/Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS)
Foundation, a non-profit group responsible for
projects to promote public awareness of AIDS and
KS. 271 AIDS cases have been reported in San Fran
cisco.
AIDS jeopardizes the body's ability to fight a vari
ety of rare diseases by attacking the immune system.
While figures van/ widely, some authorities estimate
that as of last month as many as 2259 were reported
in the United States. 917 cases Droved fatal.
Two Santa Clara County groups, the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic and the Stanford Blood Bank, are
currently conducting research on the treatment
and prevention of AIDS.
The Palo Alto facility has spent one million dollars
researching toxoplasma gondii, an organism that of
ten causes encephalitis in AIDS victims. The Stan
ford Blood Bank is currently investigating the use of
lnterleukin-2 (IL-2), a substance which could pos
sibly increase immune system activity.
Despite the relatively large number of people suf
fering from AIDS in Santa Clara County, Stewart
said no local clinics exist specifically for the treat
ment of the disease. AIDS sufferers who survive the
acute phase of the illness are usually treated as out
patients with private doctors, he added.
Contentions that the AIDS mortality rate may be
declining have yet to be confirmed by long-term
statistics, due mainly to the relatively recent dis
covery of the disease.

Homosexuals comprise the majority of AIDS vic
tims, according to McShane, who recently founded
a clinic in Redwood City to serve the gay and lesbian
community. Stewart noted that nearly 95 percent of
documented AIDS cases have involved people in
"high risk groups," specifically gays and bisexuals.
Homosexual men account for over 70 percent of all
victims in the high risk category, Stewart added.
Haitian immigrants, intravenous drug users and
hemophiliacs comprise the rest of the high risk
group, Stewart said, adding that no health officials,
friends, relatives or coworkers of AIDS sufferers
have contracted the disease as a direct result of
routine physical contact.
Although researchers are not positive as to the
source of AIDS, transmission appears to be linked
to sexual contact among homosexual men. Blood on
contaminated needles used by drug users and in
blood products such as Factor VIII, a clotting agent
given in large quantities to hemophilia patients, are
also believed to transmit the AIDS disorder.
Public attention has recently focused on the pos
sibility of directly contracting the disease from AIDS
blood donors via transfusions. Dr. left I ipson of the
Stanford Blood Bank claimed that the chances of
catching AIDS in such a manner "are about one in
one-half to one in a million," but stressed that the
chances are nonetheless real.
Dr. Benjamin luft of the Palo Alto Medical Foun
dation's research division offered two theories to
account for the AIDS disorder. He said the first hy
pothesis suggests thai the disease is caused by a
virus, possibly one present in the blood and/or
body fluids, such as semen. This bug knocks out the
victim's immune system and leaves him or her
defenseless against virus and parasites commonly
tended off by healthy per
sons.
A second hypothesis is the
"multiple hit theory. Luft said
this theory states that people
stricken with AIDS have been
concurrently attacked by a
number of infections leading
to the breakdown of the
immune system.
The AIDS treatments cur
rently being investigated in
Santa Clara County and else
where focus on ridding the

patient of "opportunistic in
fections' which often accom
pany contraction of the
disease, Lipson said.
AIDS prevention is widely
recognized as the best short
term cure for the disease, ac
cording to the Public Health
Service. Ihe service advises
members of high-risk groups
to avoid donating blood and
recommends that physicians
restrict the use of transfu
sions as much as possible.
Dr. Edward tngleman of the
Stanford Blood Bank warned
that this self-screening of

blood donors may not be
enough. He added that as of
last July, Stanford's blood
facility began screening all
blood donations for the risk
of transmitting AIDS.
Both tngleman and Lipson
noted that Stanford's blood
screening process is not per
fect, due in part to the fact
that AIDS is not entirely un
derstood. They expressed
concern that this lack of infor
mation might allow some indi
viduals to pass undetected
through ihe present AIDS
screening system.

facility began screening all
blood donations for the risk
of transmitting AIDS.
Both tngleman and Lipson
noted that Stanford's blood
screening process is not per
fect, due in part to the fact
that AIDS is not entirely un
derstood. They expressed
concern that this lack of infor
mation might allow some indi
viduals to pass undetected
through ihe present AIDS
screening system.
Eleven percent of Americans known to be afflicted
by the killer disease Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) live in the Bay Area, according to
Medical School Prof. Dennis McShane.
Fifteen to 20 persons in Santa Clara County have
been treated for the disease, according to Dr.
David Stewart of the AIDS/Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS)
Foundation, a non-profit group responsible for
projects to promote public awareness of AIDS and
KS. 271 AIDS cases have been reported in San Fran
cisco.
AIDS jeopardizes the body's ability to fight a vari
ety of rare diseases by attacking the immune system.
While figures van/ widely, some authorities estimate
that as of last month as many as 2259 were reported
in the United States. 917 cases Droved fatal.
Two Santa Clara County groups, the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic and the Stanford Blood Bank, are
currently conducting research on the treatment
and prevention of AIDS.
The Palo Alto facility has spent one million dollars
researching toxoplasma gondii, an organism that of
ten causes encephalitis in AIDS victims. The Stan
ford Blood Bank is currently investigating the use of
lnterleukin-2 (IL-2), a substance which could pos
sibly increase immune system activity.
Despite the relatively large number of people suf
fering from AIDS in Santa Clara County, Stewart
said no local clinics exist specifically for the treat
ment of the disease. AIDS sufferers who survive the
acute phase of the illness are usually treated as out
patients with private doctors, he added.
Contentions that the AIDS mortality rate may be
declining have yet to be confirmed by long-term
statistics, due mainly to the relatively recent dis
covery of the disease.

Homosexuals comprise the majority of AIDS vic
tims, according to McShane, who recently founded
a clinic in Redwood City to serve the gay and lesbian
community. Stewart noted that nearly 95 percent of
documented AIDS cases have involved people in
"high risk groups," specifically gays and bisexuals.
Homosexual men account for over 70 percent of all
victims in the high risk category, Stewart added.
Haitian immigrants, intravenous drug users and
hemophiliacs comprise the rest of the high risk
group, Stewart said, adding that no health officials,
friends, relatives or coworkers of AIDS sufferers
have contracted the disease as a direct result of
routine physical contact.
Although researchers are not positive as to the
source of AIDS, transmission appears to be linked
to sexual contact among homosexual men. Blood on
contaminated needles used by drug users and in
blood products such as Factor VIII, a clotting agent
given in large quantities to hemophilia patients, are
also believed to transmit the AIDS disorder.
Public attention has recently focused on the pos
sibility of directly contracting the disease from AIDS
blood donors via transfusions. Dr. left I ipson of the
Stanford Blood Bank claimed that the chances of
catching AIDS in such a manner "are about one in
one-half to one in a million," but stressed that the
chances are nonetheless real.
Dr. Benjamin luft of the Palo Alto Medical Foun
dation's research division offered two theories to
account for the AIDS disorder. He said the first hy
pothesis suggests thai the disease is caused by a
virus, possibly one present in the blood and/or
body fluids, such as semen. This bug knocks out the
victim's immune system and leaves him or her
defenseless against virus and parasites commonly
tended off by healthy per
sons.
A second hypothesis is the
"multiple hit theory. Luft said
this theory states that people
stricken with AIDS have been
concurrently attacked by a
number of infections leading
to the breakdown of the
immune system.
The AIDS treatments cur
rently being investigated in
Santa Clara County and else
where focus on ridding the

patient of "opportunistic in
fections' which often accom
pany contraction of the
disease, Lipson said.
AIDS prevention is widely
recognized as the best short
term cure for the disease, ac
cording to the Public Health
Service. Ihe service advises
members of high-risk groups
to avoid donating blood and
recommends that physicians
restrict the use of transfu
sions as much as possible.
Dr. Edward tngleman of the
Stanford Blood Bank warned
that this self-screening of

blood donors may not be
enough. He added that as of
last July, Stanford's blood
facility began screening all
blood donations for the risk
of transmitting AIDS.
Both tngleman and Lipson
noted that Stanford's blood
screening process is not per
fect, due in part to the fact
that AIDS is not entirely un
derstood. They expressed
concern that this lack of infor
mation might allow some indi
viduals to pass undetected

screening system.
