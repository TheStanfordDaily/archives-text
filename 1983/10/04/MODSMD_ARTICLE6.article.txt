# GSB grads continue to enter electronics firms

Graduates of the business school
here are joining electronics
manufacturers more and consulting
firms loss, according to statistics
released by the Graduate School of
Business (GSB).
Electronics firms hired 20 percent
of the University's business school
class last year. This caps a five-year
trend toward increased employ
ment of Stanford's MBAs in that in
d ustrv.
Twenty percent of the business
school graduates also joined con
sulting firms. This figure is the
lowest since 1979. Overall, the num
ber of MBAs who took jobs with

non-manufacturing firms dropped
to 63 percent.
Ayse kenmore, acting director of
the GSB Career Placement Center,
said the growth in the popularity of
electronics is fairly well explained
by the "excitement caused by
emerging companies" in that field.
An alumnus' description of a firm
has an impact on a student's choice,
Kenmore said. Lately, electronic
firms have gotten rave reviews.
MBAs find "seductive" the re
sponsibility and potential for
growth that electronics firms pro
vide, according to Kenmore. She
adds that Stanford business
graduates have particularly strong

technical backgrounds yet bring
marketing skills much needed by
emerging technical firms.
Electronic firms are seeking con
sumer goods marketers, and this is
apparent in figures here. This year,
28 percent took such positions

compared to 18 percent last year.
54 percent of the MBAs took jobs
in the Far West, but the number
taken in the Northeast increased
from 24 percent in 1982 to 37 per
cent in 1983. Only one percent went
to the South, dropping from six per
cent last year, and eight percent
went to the Midwest, an increase
from last year's three percent.

Corrections
Last Wednesday's Daily incor
rectly stated Tresidder Union
receives a percentage of profits
from the Coffee House. In fact, the
Union receives a percentage of the
gross sales.

Friday's Daily said incorrectly that

a 25-month study of insanity pleas in
Santa Clara County showed that 24
percent of all arraigned criminal
defendents are found not guilty In
reason of insanity. The figure
should have read .24 percent.
