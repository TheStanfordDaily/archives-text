## Exercise without work: Electricity is key 
### CATHY JANUS 
Capitalizing on the latest
craze in the United States, the
possession of a healthy, trim
and fit body, entrepreneurs
hope to find a market in this
country for a passive exercise
machine long used in Europe.
Promoters bill the elecronic
stimulator machine as capable
of achieving the results of ex
ercise without the perspira
tion, time and pain usually in
volved. Stanford physical
therapist, Jim Liukkonen,
however, suggests these
claims be viewed with caution.
The sales pitch is that one
loses inches without moving a
muscle. In fact, says )an Danis
of the )an Danis Salon in Los
Altos, "many of my clients fall
asleep during the treatment.
"The machine, used in the
United States for medical
purposes for 50 years, first
appeared in salons for cos
metic treatments three years
ago after an FDA ruling per
mitted electronic stimulators
to be used under trained
guidance ," said Danis.
Called "passive fitness" or
"effortless exercise", salons
around the country offer ses
sions on their electronic
stimulators to help men and
women of all ages lose inches.
A session lasts about 45
minutes during which the
client is hooked to the pads
which conduct the electric
current, contracting and
relaxing various muscle
groups.
"Anyone can use it as long
as there are no contraindica
tions such as soft-tissue in
juries. I have ladies in their
70s using the machine. An
electronic stimulator tones
muscles, but does not involve
the cardiovascular system. It is
an adjunct to exercise. The
purpose is to firm and tone
those particular muscles or
sets of muscles which need ex
tra work or are difficult areas
to exercise," she said.

"An advantage of this treat
ment is that exercises such as
leg lifts take a long time to
achieve desired firming of the
inner thighs. Passive exercise
gives results more quickly.
Many women are often dis
couraged when they go to a
spa and are put on an exercise
regimen which will only show
the results they want after a
year of effort. Our wonderful
machine shows results much
more quickly," she said.
"Each body differs, and
younger bodies respond bet
ter and more quickly. The
more often a person comes in
for treatment, the more rapid
the change. There is no pain
associated with the treatment,
no morning-after soreness,"
claims Danis. "People can
come in for treatment on a
daily basis, paying about $20 a
treatment," she said.
"Once a person is satisfied
with the results, there will be
a reversal of benefits unless
they begin an exercise pro
gram. Some people also come
here for muscle toning to con
dition and prepare for ex
ercise, " she said.
At Stanford, the varsity ath
letic training headquarters
treats injured athletes with a
similar electronic device
called a galvanic muscular
stimulator.
Over the past four years,
Stanford has used the instru
ment to treat patients for spe
cific injuries, but never for
body toning," said Liukkonen.
"If someone told me the ma
chine can be used in place of
exercise, I would be very
skeptical. From what I've seen
it is not the total answer. You
want to build up voluntary
control of muscles. The goal is
'nerve recruiting' which
means calling in more nerve
innervation to make the

muscles work in synergy,"
said Liukkonen.
"I'm worried that usage in
the salon may be too frequent.
This may not be good for the
nerves. I think salons are mis
leading people into thinking
it's an easy way to fitness. As
with dieting, there is no 'easy
way'. It is necessary to retrain
eating habits. Diet should
mean 'watch what you eat,'

not 'deny yourself and eat
kelp, seaweed and vitamins,' "
he said.
"Balance is necessary. For
fitness, this means aerobic ex
ercise, muscle toning and
proper diet. I don't think this
machine does anything
aerobic. I'm open to any
literature saying otherwise,
but at the moment I'm skepti
cal," said Liukkonen.

Selling exercise devices is
big business. "On the average
one to two salesmen a week
try to sell us devices to heal
athletic injuries. We don't buy
all of them because not all
really work."
"The electronic stimulator
is a rehabilitation modality,
like ultrasound, said liuk
konen. We use the machine to
aid in healing or relief of pain

for the majority of contusions
(bruises caused by blows),
pulled muscles, quadricep
and hamstring strains as well
as other strains and sprains,"
he said. The stimulation ma
chine, in conjunction with ice
packs, assists in reducing
swellings more rapidly. It is
not just a placebo effect," he
said.
"There are no set amounts

ot voltage to use, although we
try to use general guidelines.
We monitor a person,
gradually increasing the in
tensity of stimulation to reach
a threshold of strong contrac
tion. We stop before we get to
the point where the athlete
grits his teeth. If a person
complains of discomfort, we
turn the machine down," he
said.

the salon may be too frequent.
This may not be good for the
nerves. I think salons are mis
leading people into thinking
it's an easy way to fitness. As
with dieting, there is no 'easy
way'. It is necessary to retrain
eating habits. Diet should
mean 'watch what you eat,'

not 'deny yourself and eat
kelp, seaweed and vitamins,' "
he said.
"Balance is necessary. For
fitness, this means aerobic ex
ercise, muscle toning and
proper diet. I don't think this
machine does anything
aerobic. I'm open to any
literature saying otherwise,
but at the moment I'm skepti
cal," said Liukkonen.

Selling exercise devices is
big business. "On the average
one to two salesmen a week
try to sell us devices to heal
athletic injuries. We don't buy
all of them because not all
really work."
"The electronic stimulator
is a rehabilitation modality,
like ultrasound, said liuk
konen. We use the machine to
aid in healing or relief of pain

for the majority of contusions
(bruises caused by blows),
pulled muscles, quadricep
and hamstring strains as well
as other strains and sprains,"
he said. The stimulation ma
chine, in conjunction with ice
packs, assists in reducing
swellings more rapidly. It is
not just a placebo effect," he
said.
"There are no set amounts

ot voltage to use, although we
try to use general guidelines.
We monitor a person,
gradually increasing the in
tensity of stimulation to reach
a threshold of strong contrac
tion. We stop before we get to
the point where the athlete
grits his teeth. If a person
complains of discomfort, we
turn the machine down," he
said.

Capitalizing on the latest
craze in the United States, the
possession of a healthy, trim
and fit body, entrepreneurs
hope to find a market in this
country for a passive exercise
machine long used in Europe.
Promoters bill the elecronic
stimulator machine as capable
of achieving the results of ex
ercise without the perspira
tion, time and pain usually in
volved. Stanford physical
therapist, Jim Liukkonen,
however, suggests these
claims be viewed with caution.
The sales pitch is that one
loses inches without moving a
muscle. In fact, says )an Danis
of the )an Danis Salon in Los
Altos, "many of my clients fall
asleep during the treatment.
"The machine, used in the
United States for medical
purposes for 50 years, first
appeared in salons for cos
metic treatments three years
ago after an FDA ruling per
mitted electronic stimulators
to be used under trained
guidance ," said Danis.
Called "passive fitness" or
"effortless exercise", salons
around the country offer ses
sions on their electronic
stimulators to help men and
women of all ages lose inches.
A session lasts about 45
minutes during which the
client is hooked to the pads
which conduct the electric
current, contracting and
relaxing various muscle
groups.
"Anyone can use it as long
as there are no contraindica
tions such as soft-tissue in
juries. I have ladies in their
70s using the machine. An
electronic stimulator tones
muscles, but does not involve
the cardiovascular system. It is
an adjunct to exercise. The
purpose is to firm and tone
those particular muscles or
sets of muscles which need ex
tra work or are difficult areas
to exercise," she said.

"An advantage of this treat
ment is that exercises such as
leg lifts take a long time to
achieve desired firming of the
inner thighs. Passive exercise
gives results more quickly.
Many women are often dis
couraged when they go to a
spa and are put on an exercise
regimen which will only show
the results they want after a
year of effort. Our wonderful
machine shows results much
more quickly," she said.
"Each body differs, and
younger bodies respond bet
ter and more quickly. The
more often a person comes in
for treatment, the more rapid
the change. There is no pain
associated with the treatment,
no morning-after soreness,"
claims Danis. "People can
come in for treatment on a
daily basis, paying about $20 a
treatment," she said.
"Once a person is satisfied
with the results, there will be
a reversal of benefits unless
they begin an exercise pro
gram. Some people also come
here for muscle toning to con
dition and prepare for ex
ercise, " she said.
At Stanford, the varsity ath
letic training headquarters
treats injured athletes with a
similar electronic device
called a galvanic muscular
stimulator.
Over the past four years,
Stanford has used the instru
ment to treat patients for spe
cific injuries, but never for
body toning," said Liukkonen.
"If someone told me the ma
chine can be used in place of
exercise, I would be very
skeptical. From what I've seen
it is not the total answer. You
want to build up voluntary
control of muscles. The goal is
'nerve recruiting' which
means calling in more nerve
innervation to make the

muscles work in synergy,"
said Liukkonen.

the salon may be too frequent.
