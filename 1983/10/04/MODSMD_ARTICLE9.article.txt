## The 						Stanford Daily SSRL decision unsettling 
### 
Arthur Bienenstock found out months ago
that he couldn't please all of the people all of
the time when it comes to the proposal to in
volve the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lab
oratory (SSRL) in nuclear weapons .research
for the first time ever. Last week, he tried to
please some of the people, at least for a little
while, and it appeared that he was successful.
Student, staff and faculty opponents of the
weapons research seemed somewhat ap
peased by Bienenstock's acceptance of a
watered-down version of the proposal. But we
remain unappeased.
Bienenstock approved the project last week
after extensive discussions with its sponsors â€”
the Lawrence Livermore, Sandia and Los
Alamos National Laboratories and the Univer
sity of California. Bienenstock succeeded in
"clarifying" a key question of the proposal:
Lawrence Livermore, not SSRL, will be respon
sible for calibration of instruments for direct
use in nuclear weapons testing. This was one
of the most pernicious aspects of the original
proposal, which was vague in locating the site
of the calibration.
The clarification was hailed as a "small vic
tory" by some of the project's opponents. And
though these opponents have expressed dis
approval of many aspects of the research, not
much has been heard from them yet. Last
spring they marched, protested and signed
petitions with a fervor that was reminiscent of
the 19605.
A few things make us question this quarter's
lack of nay-saying. Despite the fact that
Bienenstock has poo-pooed the extent to
which SSRL will take part in nuclear weapons
research, he does not deny the laboratory's
direct future involvement in such projects.
Nor can we blithely dismiss the fact that the
country's three largest weapons laboratories
will be controlling two-thirds of the beam time
on the new project. It is also troubling that the

Department of Energy's Office of Military Ap
plications will be funding most of the project,
increasing the University's already-close ties
to the military.
But most sobering of all is Bienenstock's
ready admission that nobody really knows how
much of the work conducted at the facility will
eventually benefit weapons projects. Research
of this sort is an inexact science, Bienenstock
says, because an experiment that studies basic
properties of nature today could be tomor
row's super-weapon. Bienenstock also says it
will be very difficult for him to ensure that the
researchers are conforming to all University
regulations.
To criticize the acceptance of the proposal is
not to criticize the amount of thought and care
that was put into the decision. Few would have
wanted to be in Bienenstock's shoes this sum
mer as he struggled to choose between two
principles: one, his expressed distaste for
weapons work and the other his love of any
research that furthers knowledge of nature.
No one denies that much of the project would
benefit basic science. At the same time, no one
denies that the influx of prestigious scientists
who will work on the project will boost the
laboratory's reputation.
But Bienenstock received some help in his
decision that to us is a bit frightening. Though
no one talked about it, scientists and policy
makers in Washington were a bit peeved that
the project gained the controversy it did. The
specter of spiteful decision-makers stopping
the flow of money that keeps SSRL and the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center alive
probably put more than subtle pressure on
the laboratory's director.
We are left wondering whether the pro
posal was ever under the University's control.
It is to us a disturbing reminder that in the nu
clear age decisions made from far away control
and determine our destinv.
