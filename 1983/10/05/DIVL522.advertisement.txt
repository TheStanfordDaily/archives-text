Great Western
has something
better than
the Guaranteed
Student Loan:
The FAST.
Guaranteed
Student Loan.
Anywhere you go for a California Guaranteed Student Loan, you'll get a low interest
rate and a long time to pay it back. .
But with Great Western Savings, you'll get something more: Fast Service. You'll get an
answer within 30 days. And, because Great Western is a major California lender, you get
your money fast. You can even get a loan from Great Western if you already have a student
loan with another lender.
We lend to California residents and nonresidents, as long as the school is in California.
Freshmen and half-time students are also eligible. You can borrow up to $2,500 a year if you
are an undergraduate, and up to $5,000 for graduate study. The low interest rates mean
comfortable monthly payments during the first few years after school when money may be
tight. You can pay nothing while you're in school, and when you finish there is a grace period
before your payments begin.
It's easy to apply for a student loan with Great Western Savings, hill out the forms at
your Financial Aid Office, and send your application to the address below.
You can get a Guaranteed Student Loan from other lenders, but with Great Western,
you get guaranteed fast service.
