# Weekend hours cut at Meyer Library
## 
### JULIE RYAN 
Some students were shocked
when they found Meyer Library
closed this weekend—and some
are preparing to do something
about it.
They had been unaware that in
a trade-off for lenghtening li
brary hours during dead week
and finals, library officials have
decided to close at 10 p.m. on
Friday nights and 6 p.m. on
Saturdays for most of the quar
ter.
At least two students say they
may organize other students to
protest the new hours.
After experimenting with ex
tended hours last year, the li
brary decided to "reduce other
hours during low operation so
that we can make these late
hours a regular part of our oper
ation," according to Elizabeth
Salzer, who heads the library.
During dead week and finals
this year, the library will remain
open every day until 1 a.m.
"We've tried to make people
very aware of the hours," said
Salzer, who added that it was too
early to judge student response.
Yet most students seem to have

missed the announcements. Bob
Slater, an ASSU senator, said he
"found out about it the same way
as everyone else; when I went
over Saturday night and saw the
new hours posted."
Slater says that people he's
talked to think it's "a little unfair"
and that he is planning to con
duct a survey for the ASSU to see
if this is the general feeling. "It
seems we can work out someth
ing a little better than this," he
said.
Senior Dean Avary went to the
library about 7:10 p.m. Saturday
night and was surprised to see
people walking in and out al
though all the lights were off. Ap
parently one door had been mis
takenly left open and according
to Avary about 50 people were
inside walking around. People
were either confused about the
new hours or were just taking
advantage of the situation, he
said.
"It was like walking into a set of
2001," Avary said. "People had
been in there about an hour and
nobody did anything." Avary said
He then called the police who came
and \ocked the place up.
Even who are aware of
the changes are sometimes
confused by the reasons behind
Ihem. "Are they encrouraging
cramming?" asked Avary.
Others point out that while eight
hours are being cut from the hours

each week, at most 14 hours will be
added at the end of the quarter.
"It infuriates me," said sopho
more Heidi Molbak, who called
Meyer to complain. She said an em
ployee there told her to get a list of
500 signatures and that she has
already talked to a lot of people who
want to use the library on Saturday
nights.
According to Salzer, the late
night study rooms outside Meyer
will be open until 2 a.m. every night

so that students can find a place to
study.
But, according to Slater, there
were already "quite a few people in
them this weekend and they were
pretty uncomfortable."
While some students are upset by
the change, others are like junior
Nell O'Donnell who said "I think it's
a pretty fair trade." Sophomore
Tom Belin had a suggestion for
those students who are complain
ing: "Go to Yale; we don't want any
open libraries on Saturday night."
