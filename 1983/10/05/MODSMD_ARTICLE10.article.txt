## 
### KATHLEEN O'ROURKE 
A Mills College professor
revealed startling statistics
about the prevalence of rape
in our society during a
presentation on sexual vio
lence Monday night at Cub
berley Auditorium.
Defining rape as forced in
tercourse or intercourse with
someone on drugs or other
wise incapable of giving con
sent to the act, Prof. Diana
Russell reported that of a ran
dom sample of 930 women
who participated in her study,
44 percent had been raped
sometime during their life.
Only 9 1/2 percent of those
rapes were reported to
police, she said.
Of the people doing the
raping, 35 percent were ac
quaintances of the women, 11
percent strangers, 8 percent
were husbands or ex
husbands and 3 percent
relatives. The statistics explain
why so many rapes go un

reported, she said. Most
sexual abuse occurs between
people who know each other.
Russell said she also sur
veyed a sample of male stu
dents. When asked if they

would sexually force them
selves upon a woman of an
aloof or bitchy manner, 17
percent said there would be
some likelihood and 55 per
cent said they might after

being assured of avoiding
punishment.
When the students were
asked if they had ever wanted
to rape, most answered that
they had entertained the
thought at one time or an
other. Russell also found that
a majority of men wanted to
rape aloof women, women
who teased and previous
sexual partners who no
longer wished to engage in in
tercourse.
All the statistics and
responses obtained by Rus
sell's surveys may reveal that
sexual violence is more an ele
ment of societal norms than
most people realize because
of public unwillingness to
report incidences of sexual
abuse.
Russell, a professor of wo
men's studies, has done consi
derable influence on sexual
violence, such as pornogra
phy, sexual abuse of children,
wife beating and sexual
harassment in the workplace.
