## The 						Stanford Daily Release Mosher case info 
### 
Though thousands of words have been writ
ten on the subject, it is impossible to deter
mine which side to take in the controversy
over the case of Steven Mosher, the former
anthropology Ph.D. candidate who was dis
missed last spring for "illegal and seriously un
ethical conduct" while doing field research in
China.
As the appeals case moves up the administra
tive ladder — Dean of Graduate Studies and Re
search Gerald Leiberman recently rejected
Steven Mosher's latest appeal and the matter
will next be taken up by University President
Donald Kennedy — the report outlining the spe
cific reason for Mosher's dismissal remains
classified information.
Because it is claimed that release of the
report would endanger innocent people, only
Mosher and the 15 or so people who have
reviewed his case are privy to the contents of
that secret report. In a case which so intimate
ly involves internal review standards, academ
ic freedom and Stanford's reputation as an
honorable proponent of both, we question
the wisdom of keeping the reason for Mos
her's dismissal so vague.
While we respect the effort to protect inno
cent people, it is impossible to determine
which is the equitable side until some clarifica
tion of the decision is released and hence it
must be assumed that both sides are culpable.
This is not fair to the University and it certainly
isn't fair to Mosher.
Though the University has repeatedly in
sisted the dismissal has nothing to do with
Mosher's articles about abortion practices in
China, the limitation of secrecy has robbed
these arguments of their credibility.
Mosher has fared better with the national
p ress _ he is usually portrayed as a persecuted
scholar in search of the truth about Chinese
abortions — but in the search for a solution to

this Chinese puzzle box the press has indulged
in all sorts of wild speculation. Some have re
ported that Mosher was smuggling coins out of
the country, some that he was bribing officials,
some that he was traveling in areas where he
was not authorized to do so. Some have sug
gested that Mosher was dismissed because of
things he did before he even left for China.
Of course, the stories about the University
and the tales about Mosher can neither be
proved nor refuted. But the University seems
to lose more from the secrecy than Mosher
does.
Mosher attacks the University for not
releasing the report, refuses to release it him
self because, he says, he does not want to be
responsible for libeling himself, threatens to
sue the University if it releases the report, and
walks away with a fairly good media image.
Stanford, in contrast, has lost some respect in
the effort to appear reasonable and protect in
nocent people.
It is hard to believe that the administration
could not be a little more specific than "illegal
and unethical conduct" when putting forth a
reason for Mosher's dismissal, however deli
cate the situation of those the University says it
is trying to protect. By specifying whether the
trespasses were committed in China or in the
United States, by saying that Mosher's acts
were unethical but not criminal, by saying that
the issue involved research techniques or per
sonal actions, by saying that Mosher's publica
tions were suspect, by giving any hint more
concrete than "illegal and seriously unethical"
conduct, the University might clear some of
the smoke that clouds this institution's reputa
tion due to the Mosher case.
But as things stand, it is all speculation —
speculation which up to this point has ironical
ly hurt the University much more than it has
hurt Mosher.
