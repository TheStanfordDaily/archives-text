The Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band, better known as the Band, is
suffering from an acute case of paranoia. We
suggest an old cure — don't worry about the
outside world and have fun.
After the Band valiantly tried to stop Cal's
Kevin Moen from entering the end zone last
November, the red-coated musicians started
to get some bad press and some nasty mail.
Suddenly concerned with their image, band
officials went on a campaign to become, as
manager Gary Robinson says,"the most
popular university band in the world." The
band tightened up on its rules, self-censored
their half-time shows and reveled in the praise
they received from alumni, the Athletic Depart
ment and the Chrysler Corporation.
Not all these recent changes are for the
worse. Musically, the Band sounds great. It
also is loved. When the Band stopped in
Chicago on its way to the Illinois game three
weeks ago, not only did Chrysler put members
up for the night at the Chicago Inn, but Windy
City commuters jammed traffic to watch them
play on Michigan Avenue.
What's worrying us is that out of the desire
to be acceptea, the band will stray from what

makes it The Band. Conformism is one thing
that can ruin the Band . In an effort to paten
relations with the alumni, the University and
America, the band may forget its real con
stituency — the fun-loving crazy people who
want to be fun-loving and crazy on Saturday af
ternoons.
This is not to say the Band has done wrong —
we still love it. The Band should merely recog
nize that what is so loving is the spirited atmo
sphere, the lack of regimented marching, half
time shows that come close to offending, and a
clean break from the stuffiness that dominates
the world the other six days of the week.
The Band is a great asset to the spirit of the
University. What some people refer to as
mistakes on the field (Big Came, San Jose State)
should be remembered but not used as inspi
ration for self-censure, and the Band should
stop worrying so much. If band officers are in
need of positive reinforcement to cure their
paranoia, they should turn to their fellow stu
dents, who will back them up in the name of
honest-to-goodness fun. As far as we're con
cerned, the Band has always been the most
popular in the world, but such labels are not
what makes the Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Marching Band the band we love.
