## Watt's right about the "Perfect Mix" 
### 
James Watt makes a bad joke and
the nation has a fit. Okay, it was a
really bad joke but he didn't say it
because he was trying to be rude.
He said it because he thought he
would play on that fascinating Amer
ican passion for the ultimate in bu
reaucratic fashion — the Perfect Mix.
The Perfect Mix is, of course, that
magical blend of ethnic gender
which is a prerequisite for any fair
and democratic commission,
congress, faculty, etc. The Perfect
Mix is similar to a well-made sand
wich. You've got, say, turkey on
whole wheat - that's the WASP foun
dation. It's the bulk of the sandwich
but it needs spicing up. Tomato
slices are the women, and the
lettuce leaves are the blacks. Asian
American sprouts or native Ameri
can pickles would be a nice touch.
Top it all off with a spicy Hispanic
sandwich spread. Voila, the Perfect
Sandwich/Perfect Mix.
The point of this strange little
analogy, of course, is that the more
one jazzes up a bland edible
(commission), the easier it is for the
consumer (American public) to
swallow. America wants Perfect Mix
representation at a cost. But some
of us just won't let go of our elitist
ideals. Some of us want representa
tives from one group and one
group only, that of The Most
Qualified.
That's not to say that some folk
are not qualified by virtue of their
socio-racial-economic back
grounds, but a Perfect Mix should
be icing on the cake, not the
desired end. Lord knows the Per
fect Mix is uncommon, but we
should not be top-down in our
thinking. One can't build equality
from on high. Equality has got to
build itself out of understanding
and achievement. People earn self
worth — they don't receive it.

Our Perfect Mix mentality, like
our little quotas here and there,
whether influenced by social con
sciousness or real, do nothing more
than lower the value of those
"minorities" who make the grade.
Warranted or not, all minorities at
one time or another face those nod
ding heads and knowing eyes. "Say
no more, I know why you got ac
cepted."
But the key issue is not perception
—it's qualification. A member of a
commission on coal leasing should
know about the issues. A civil rights
commission member should know
about the history and policy of civil
rights.
A little tragic-comic incident here
at ol' SU last year raises the same
questions. What appeared to be an
excellent course was boycotted be
cause, well, one of the instructors
just didn't seem right. It appeared
that members of the BLSA just
couldn't break ranks with their
chums at Harvard, who had decided
earlier that what someone taught is
somehow less important than what
that somebody was. Ah well, what
can a white person know about civil
rights anyway? Or a male about
feminist studies. Oversimplification?
Sure, but the question is easy and
so is the answer. Racism is wrong.
Sexism is wrong. Either way.
But some people don't feel that
way, and that makes a certain
Mexican-American English major
think twice about pursuing his area
of academia. One day it will happen.
He'll be sitting in a seminar on early
American Writers. He'll make a
small, uncontroversial statement
concerning Samuel Adams. Sudden
ly, the Yank sitting across the table
will blurt it out.
"How can you say that? How can
you really know what the Protestant
Work Ethic is? It's just not deep
within you. You don't understand.

You should be reading Garcia-
Marquez."
That little scenario was brought to
mind when a local English professor
told a very small audience that, yes,
he'd taught a feminist literature
course, back in the days when a
male teaching feminist literature
was a tad more legitimate. And it's
too bad he's not still teaching it be
cause he's a terrific professor.
We don't need any more aliena
tion in our society. Our own Profes
sor Estelle Freedman's victory
should make us all see more clearly
where our academic values lie.
Freedman, from our scholarly point
of view, is a good professor first, a
woman second.

can pickles would be a nice touch.
Top it all off with a spicy Hispanic
sandwich spread. Voila, the Perfect
Sandwich/Perfect Mix.
The point of this strange little
analogy, of course, is that the more
one jazzes up a bland edible
(commission), the easier it is for the
consumer (American public) to
swallow. America wants Perfect Mix
representation at a cost. But some
of us just won't let go of our elitist
ideals. Some of us want representa
tives from one group and one
group only, that of The Most
Qualified.
That's not to say that some folk
are not qualified by virtue of their
socio-racial-economic back
grounds, but a Perfect Mix should
be icing on the cake, not the
desired end. Lord knows the Per
fect Mix is uncommon, but we
should not be top-down in our
thinking. One can't build equality
from on high. Equality has got to
build itself out of understanding
and achievement. People earn self
worth — they don't receive it.

Our Perfect Mix mentality, like
our little quotas here and there,
whether influenced by social con
sciousness or real, do nothing more
than lower the value of those
"minorities" who make the grade.
Warranted or not, all minorities at
one time or another face those nod
ding heads and knowing eyes. "Say
no more, I know why you got ac
cepted."
But the key issue is not perception
—it's qualification. A member of a
commission on coal leasing should
know about the issues. A civil rights
commission member should know
about the history and policy of civil
rights.
A little tragic-comic incident here
at ol' SU last year raises the same
questions. What appeared to be an
excellent course was boycotted be
cause, well, one of the instructors
just didn't seem right. It appeared
that members of the BLSA just
couldn't break ranks with their
chums at Harvard, who had decided
earlier that what someone taught is
somehow less important than what
that somebody was. Ah well, what
can a white person know about civil
rights anyway? Or a male about
feminist studies. Oversimplification?
Sure, but the question is easy and
so is the answer. Racism is wrong.
Sexism is wrong. Either way.
But some people don't feel that
way, and that makes a certain
Mexican-American English major
think twice about pursuing his area
of academia. One day it will happen.
He'll be sitting in a seminar on early
American Writers. He'll make a
small, uncontroversial statement
concerning Samuel Adams. Sudden
ly, the Yank sitting across the table
will blurt it out.
"How can you say that? How can
you really know what the Protestant
Work Ethic is? It's just not deep
within you. You don't understand.

You should be reading Garcia-
Marquez."
That little scenario was brought to
mind when a local English professor
told a very small audience that, yes,
he'd taught a feminist literature
course, back in the days when a
male teaching feminist literature
was a tad more legitimate. And it's
too bad he's not still teaching it be
cause he's a terrific professor.
We don't need any more aliena
tion in our society. Our own Profes
sor Estelle Freedman's victory
should make us all see more clearly
where our academic values lie.
Freedman, from our scholarly point
of view, is a good professor first, a
woman second.
