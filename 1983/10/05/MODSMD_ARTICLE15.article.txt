## A
						guide to the 1984 elections 
### 
Well, it looks as if it's time once
again for the people of this country
to go through that organized
masochism known as a presidential
election. And, as happens every
four years, most of the electorate is
confused about the candidates, the
issues, and how the candidates
relate to the issues, if at all. In fact,
most people don't even know what a
non-binding straw poll is, much less
why the candidates spend so much
money trying to win one.
With all this in mind, I have taken
it upon myself to help dispell the
confusion with a quick guide to the
1984 presidential race. Feel free to
cut this guide out, tape it to your
mirror, dashboard, nose, or anyth
ing else where it will always be
handy for quick reference. We'll
begin by looking at the candidates
for the Democratic nomination:

John Glenn is trying to
go beyond his image as
a hero, which he is, to
an image of an intelli
gent, creative public
official, which he isn't.

Walter Mondale is the current
Democratic front-runner, because
he is able to appeal to everyone.
Unfortunately, by appealing to
everyone, he ends up alienating
most everyone. He also suffers from
a mixed image in the media —
reporters like him because he
seems to appeal to everyone, at
least before alienating them, but po
litical columnists don't like him be
cause by appealing to everyone in
general, he doesn't appeal to
anyone in particular, particularly
not to those whom he alienates by
appealing to.
John Glenn is the current Demo
cratic runner-up. He is trying to go
beyond his image as a hero, which
he is, to an image of an intelligent,
creative public official, which he
isn't. He will be aided in this quest
by the movie "The Right Stuff,"
which portrays him, much to his
consternation, as a larger-than-life
national hero, but which does not,
at least, portray him as the bald and
boring man he is. In essence, then,
Glenn is weakest when he seems to
be what he wants to be, but isn't,
and strongest when he is what he
isn't and doesn't even want to be
any more.
Alan Cranston has been running a
one-issue campaign against nuclear
weapons. Unfortunately for him,
everyone agrees with him, which
denies him the violent opposition
which can be such an effective tool
in fund-raising letters to get sup
porters to contribute out of fear of
the opposition gaining power (the

James Watt Lffect). If Cranston
could gain some enemies, he'd have
a lot more friends.
Gary Hart has John Glenn's prob
lem in reverse: he's a serious ideas
oriented candidate who needs to be
seen as a national hero, or at the
very least to gain some recognition
through the making of some mildly
amusing old movies. So far, though,
he's too serious to be a serious can
didate.
George McGovern is running to
prove that he can win by losing,
since in 1972 he lost by winning. The
public thinks he can't win enough to
lose, while the press thinks he can't
lose enough to win. Still, he bears
watching.
Fritz Hollings and Reuben Askew
aren't well-known enough to
become popular enough to get the
media coverage they need to
become well-known enough to be
popular. Askew also suffers from
having a silly last name — can you im
agine people saying, "The Presi
dent's Askew?"
Jesse Jackson isn't a candidate yet,
because he wins by not running un
til he can lose in such a way that he
can win even more. If, however, he
wins, he may lose by not having won
enough to win.
Now, we will take a quick look at
the much less-crowded field for the
Republican nomination:
Ronald Reagan gains by staying
out of the race as long as possible,
and would win by a landslide if he
never entered the race at all. On
the other hand, if he enters the race
he can only attract opposition and
lose. In sum, if he's out, he's in,
while if he's in, he's out, but the
former will probably be the case.

Ronald Reagan gains by
staying out of the race
as long as possible, and
would win by a
landslide if he never en
tered at all.

Harold Stassen has been running
for President longer than half the
American population has been alive,
and is so good at losing that he
wouldn't know what to do if he
won, so it's good that he won't.
John Anderson is running as an
Independent, because there isn't a
moderate wing of the Republican
Party any more, and if there were,
he wouldn't be in it anyway, be
cause they would resent him having
left it when it wasn't there.
That, in sum, is how the campaign
is shaping up. I hope it's all much
clearer to you now.
