Cartoon offensive
We were extremely offended by
your editorial cartoon of Septem
ber 30. In it, you imply that it is
impossible to enjoy a non-alcoholic
Stanford party, that it takes alcohol
to raise a college student above the
level of the third grade, and that
freshmen should somehow prove
themselves by getting drunk during
their first few days free from pa
rental influence.
Not only did you insult all of the
non-drinkers on campus, but you
also belittled all of the work put in
by hundreds of staff and
who help make orientation such a
success every year.

"Hard line needed with Soviets"
{Daily, Sept. 27) deserves space in a
metropolitan newspaper or a Voice
of America broadcast. Robert
Larkins will go far in his chosen
field. But in a university daily, one
expects some critique of the sub
stance, if not of the emotional con
tent. The subject of KAL flight 007 is
shrouded like an onion with
propaganda. Is there any simple
way to cut through it?
Let me demonstrate AAI, which
stands for "Admission Against
Interest." When our delegates
played the Japanese recording of
the USSR pilot/ground communica
tions to the UN Assembly, it was
accompanied by our translation ot
the garbled Russian. The USSR was
roundly condemned for firing
rockets at the 747 without warning.
This is obviously not an AAI, and
therefore must be dismissed with
out credence. However, the U.S.
soon determined that one phrase
of the translation was in error: it
indicated that the Russian pilot
fired his guns at the 747.
(International custom requires
firing tracers where the trespass
ing pilot can see them.)
Now that is an AAI by the U.S.
and promotes the event to the
status of a fact: the 747 was
warned.
Other AAl's involved in the tragic
flight: there were 240 passengers
but 29 crew. In other words, if
there were activities aboard that
did not relate to a passenger flight,
there were many hands to ac
complish them. There were three
inertial navigation instruments, a
radar that U.S. airlines flying that
route keep trained on the
coastline, and the pilot had both a
watch and a compass; yet the flight
path given to the newspapers by
the U.S. indicated a turn to the East
over the southern end of Sakhalin.
Another AAI was that the 747
pilot was a full Colonel in the Air
Force and senior KAL pilot. Also
that nearly all KAL officers hold
active Air Force rank.
The most startling AAI was simply
that a U.S. spy plane was in the
area when there seems to be no
reason for such an admission at all.
