### BRYCE LEE 
"Ultimately, if we want to elimi
nate rape, we must replace our sys
tem of monopolistic capitalism with
socialism," political activist Angela
Davis said in Kresge Auditorium last
night.
Speaking before a crowd of near
ly 300, Davis, a professor at Univer
sity of California at San Francisco,
blamed the present "epidemic of
rape" on racism and its relationship
to "the kind of of society we live in."
Davis, in her speech entitled
"Rape and the History of Oppres
sion" was part of the week-long se
ries of lectures and films organized
by the Stanford Rape Education
Project."Facing Rape" week is de
signed to examine the the images
and experiences of sexual violence.
The noted civil and women's
rights activist said that rape has al
ways been an inherent part of
capitalistic American culture, even
before the Civil War.
"Rape was an integral part of the
slave system in this country," Davis
said, adding that sexual abuse has
been "heaped" upon black women.
"The function of rape can easily
be understood through slavery . . .
and slaveowners had unlimited
sexual access to women through
rape."
Davis said that the myth that

rapists are predominantly black
began in the political situation of the

South after the Civil War. The er
roneous assumption that blacks are

rapists is an example in the "history
of black suppression."
Davis added that the "myth of the
black rapist" as an excuse to lynch
blacks.
"Ihe myth of the black rapist led
to black massacres and promoted
the view that blacks are a race of
rapists," Davis continued.
Davis added that after the Civil
War, black women were portrayed
as "bad, immoral and as whores."
If we call black women whores,
then "if they are raped then they
really haven't been raped," Davis
said.
Davis stressed the fact that wo
men of the working classes are the
most susceptible to being raped.
She explained that the crime of rape
is still perceived to be a crime com
mitted against the husband, adding
that the "working class man has no
power" to fight rape since working
class husbands must always work.
"The bourgeosie are much more
able to fight back," Davis said.
Concluding that "rape must be
combatted on every level," Davis
suggested that women learn to
defend themselves physically
through anti-rape campaigns and
movements.
Davis added that rape can be
talked about so openly now is be
cause of the women's movement.
