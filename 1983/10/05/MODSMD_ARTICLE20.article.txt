## Fun at the Flicks 
### SHEILA HENNESSEY Staff writer 
ASSU's Sunday Flicks movie
series attracts the largest
audiences during tall quarter,
but this fall promises to be a
box office blockbuster for the
ASSU. The first selection ot
the season, "Tootsie" drew
the second largest Flicks
crowd in history and a record
number of season passes have
been sold for the fall quarter.
Although attendance por
mally declines as the quarter
progresses, Flicks Manager
Richard Geist feels that this
quarter's strong lineup will
ensure large crowds every
week. One reason for the
quality of the schedule, Geist
said, is that film distributors
are releasing popular films
sooner than ever before.
Founded in 1935, the Flicks
are the oldest ASSU-run proj
ect. Geist credits a low admis
sion price and a selection of
currently popular films for
the series' popularity with stu
dents here. "They like to go to
the popular movies at such a
cheap price," Geist explained.
"It's a good deal."
Although admission was in
creased from $1.00 to $1.50
two years ago to keep up with
inflation, Geist said he sees no
reason for a further increase
to $2.00. If that were to occur,
Geist said, the Flicks would
have to compete with off
campus theaters and would
lose customers.
Geist is also faced with com
petition from film series
sponsored by other groups
on campus, such as the
Chaparral and the Law
School. For this reason, he
continues to book films which
are currently popular, while
other film series managers
prefer to choose their movies
using different criteria.
Although he feels he is of
ten criticized for booking
popular movies at the expense
Of films of quality, Geist said,
"We can't afford to go into an
older movies market or a cul
tural movies market."
