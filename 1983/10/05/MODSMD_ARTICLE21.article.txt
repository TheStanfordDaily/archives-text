### JOSEFINE NAUCKHOFF 
The ASSU provides a number ot
services to help students with the task
they came to Stanford for in the first
place— study.
Among the services offered are the
ASSU Lecture Notes, the Course
Guide, Guest Professorship Board
and Speakers Bureau.
The ASSU Lecture Notes are the
most widely used of these services.
The notes are released weekly and
provide summaries of lectures from
the previous week. The service is used
by students and professors alike, who
occasionally resort to the notes to
review their own lectures.

Before a note-taker is hired for any
class, the Lecture Note Service must
send a letter to the professor for ap
proval, which is usually granted. "The
faculty is extremely supportive of this
service and often recommends note
takers , usually a teaching assistant or
a grad student who has taken the
course," said Hubert Chang, Lecture
Notes coordinator.
Although the ASSU stresses that
lecture notes are "not intended to be
a substitute for a student's own notes
or attendance, but rather is a valuable
supplememt to the student's own
work," the notes are occasionally
abused. "I went to five lectures all

quarter and got an A- in the class —
thanks to the lecture notes," one stu
dent said.
The ASSU Course Guide is a free
publication which contains critical
evaluations of courses based on the
results of a questionnaire given out at
the end of each quarter. The evalua
tions include statistics from the ques
tionnaires along with brief written
reviews of the classes surveyed.
A common complaint about the
Course Guide is that it doesn't review
enough classes. Because professors
tend to only turn in favorable results
from questionnaires, not all classes
are listed in the Course Guide, and
those which are generally have posi
tive reviews.
The Guest Professorship Board
brings prominent individuals to Stan
fnrH to Iprtiirp for nnp nuarter. Al
though the number of sign-ups for
guest professors' classes is high, actu
al attendance is often lower than sign
ups would indicate. Because the
classes are non-credit and guest
speakers are sometimes unac
customed to lecturing, attendence
sometimes drops after the first few
weeks of class.
Among the prominant figures who
have taught at Stanford in the past are
former presidential candidate John
Anderson and former congressman
Paul "Pete" McCloskey.
Because guest professorships are
department-sponsored, there is much
faculty discussion over who is respon
sible for the courses and their con
tents.
The Speakers Bureau offers
quarter-long lecture series, and like
the guest professorship program, of
ten features political figures. The
lectures are generally well-attended,
and unlike guest professors, the
speakers are independent of depart
ment sponsorship and are subject to
little departmental review.
