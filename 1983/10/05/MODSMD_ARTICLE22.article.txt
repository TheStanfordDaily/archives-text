## On the Mark Mark Zeigler Feel sorry, but don't feel sorry for the man with a 0-4 record 
### 
Paul Wiggin stood up at
his corner table in Stick
ney's Restaurant's press
conference room yester
day, slid his big frame past
two chairs and walked to
the podium at the other
end of the room.
He held his head up as he
walked. His crew-cu: style
hair was freshly trimmed.
Stanford's head football
coach stepped behind the
wooden podium with a pair
of microphones attached to
it. He looked around the
room, his ears and eyes
poised to field the first
question like an crouched
infielder awaiting a ground
ball.
The first question dealt
with controversy. Wiggin
was asked to comment on
Arizona State coach Darryl
Rogers' alleged attempt to
run up the score last Satur
day by inserting his field
goal kicker into the line-up
twice in the late going,
once with 11 seconds left

and once with two, in an ef
fort to tie a NCAA single
game field goal record.
"It didn't change the w's
or I's on the thing," said
Wiggin, whose team lost 29-
11. "That's past. It's over."
The following questions
were innocent ones,
though. Stanford's 0-4
record in 1983 and seven
straight losses dating back
to last season weren't even
mentioned.
Something else was.
About 30 minutes into the
10 a.m. press conference, a
reporter asked Wiggin
about a column written on
him recently. The column
appeared in the Monday
San Francisco Chronicle
and was written by Glenn
Dickey. It began, "Paul
Wiggin should announce
immediately that he will
resign as Stanford football
coach at the end of the
season."
Wiggin, shaken by the
question, hesitated. He

looked at the writer, then
looked around the room
tor an awkward split
second. He opened his
mouth. "I . . . don't want to
talk about that."
A few more awkward mo
ments. Wiggin, his face
tixed in the frown that only
Paul Wiggin can make,
glanced one last time
around the room. He
looked down at Stanford
Sports Information Direc
tor Steve Raczynski seated
at the table closest to the
podium. "Is that all,
Steve?" he murmured.
Most of his four words
were swallowed by the
loud silence that had en
gulfed the room.
The 6-foot-5 frame of
Wiggin did not waste any
time leaving. Only its
shadow waited for an an
swer from Raczynski.
The column, no doubt,
had hit a Wiggin soft spot.
Paul Wiggin, the coach as
well as the man, had taken a
punch and was on the

canvas. In less than the time
it took to read just one line
of the column, the referee
had counted to 10.
Wiggin, as in physique,
wasn't floored. VViggin, as
in pride, was.
After Wiggin lett, Stan
ford defensive lineman
Mike Wyman, who has
been at Stanford as long as
Wiggin, had his turn be
hind the podium. It wasn't

long before his coach's
name came up.
Asked to comment on the
pressure Wiggin faces, the
6-6, 242 pound Wyman an
swered slowly, his voice
shaking like a young kid's
before he is going to cry.
"It makes us really angry.
I'm inside. I know what's
happening isn't coach's
fault."
Then, a few minutes

later, Wyman dropped the
real bombshell. "As a
whole, as a team, we prob
ably don't have the talent of
other teams," he said.
Stanford is not a good
football team. Most 0-4
teams aren't. But whether
that is Wiggin s fault or
simply due to a lack of tal
ent is open to speculation.
Wiggin, however, has to
live with that won-loss
statistic. "It's too bad that
we're 0-4, but that's the
bottom line for a coach,"
he said yesterday.
Wiggin also has to live
with the fact that he may
not get a fifth chance to
bring home a winning
record for Stanford. In
three full years and part of
a fourth, he is 15-22. )ohn
Elway, labeled the greatest
quarterback ever, played
on all three of those four
teams.
Wiggin is probably not
the right man to coach
Stanford football in 1983.

Then again, maybe no one
is. But win or lose, the
bedrock of the man is
pride, and any thought of
leaving the Farm hurts and
hurts bad. Seeing it in print
is worse.
Wiggin has said he's
made three great decisions
in his life: transferring
from Modesto lunior Col
lege to Stanford, propos
ing to his wife, Carolyn,
and accepting an offer to
become Stanford's head
football coach.
Coming back to coach at
his alma mater obviously
means a lot to Wiggin.
Facing the possibilty of a
one, two, or three-win
season means embarrass
ment. Watching one of the
three most important
things in your life explode
in your face can't be much
of a picnic.
But feeling sorry for him
is no solution. Paul Wiggin
is too decent a man to let
pity weaken his pride.
