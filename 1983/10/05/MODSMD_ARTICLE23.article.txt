# Goalie Mover helps Card maintain water polo status
## 
### BETH KLEID 
As the only returning
starter on this year's water
polo team, junior goalie
and All-America third team
player Steve Moyer feels
the pressure.
For the first time in the
last eight years Stanford's
water polo dynasty is
threatened. During those
eight years, the Cardinal
has not been ranked lower
than fourth in the nation,
and it has accumulated four
NCAA titles. But gradua
tion has taken a toll on the
team, and six of last year's
starting players are gone.
This year the team is
ranked No. 8.
Moyer is one of the last
remaining links to Cardinal
water polo's glorious past,
and he is a key to their
future.
"I feel pressure from
being the 'experienced
one' among the starters,"
said Moyer. "We have a
very young team. We are
starting five freshmen, and
they lac k experience and
the ability to play together
as a unit."
A second pressure that
Moyer deals with is that of
being a goalie. "Goalie is a
very visible position.
People just have to look up

at the scoreboard to see
how the goalie is doing,"
he said. "As goalie I tend to
take full responsibility for
losses, which helps
motivate me. I don't like to
let people down."
Moyer is under yet an
other pressure. Stanford
goalies have held the first
team All-America goalie
spot in seven of the last
eight years, and Moyer is
expected to continue this
tradition.
"During my summer
workouts my goal was to
make the first team, but
now I just have to put that
away and focus on how the
team is doing," he said.
But despite these pre
ssures, Moyer is optimistic
about the season. "We
have an incredible crop of
freshmen â€” the best," he
said. "Saturday starts Pac
-10 play against UCLA. If we
do well against them I think
we can salvage a decent
season.
"This season we may not
be winning all the time, but
we will still hang in there."
Moyer has been in the
water for a long time. At
age six, Moyer was
"thrown into the pool" by
his parents to channel his

energies. He then started
swimming on the swim team
in his hometown of Mission
Viejo, California.
Because of the fierce
competition on the swim
team Moyer dropped out,
and began to play water
polo during his freshman
year at Mission Viejo High
School. He had an auspi
cious high school career,
winning CIF player-of-the
year and first team All -
American.
After his senior year in
high school Moyer played
on the lunior National
Team, and traveled to
Puerto Rico and Italy. Fol
lowing his freshman year
here the Junior National
Team gave him the chance
to see Copenhagen and
Budapest.
As for his water polo
playing on the Farm, Moyer
is satisfied with his playing
during his freshman and
sophomore years. But
now, possibly because of
the pressures he is under,
Moyer said he is in a slump.
This slump has a great ef
fect on Moyer. His attitude
of dissatisfaction with his
water polo play is carrying
over to his personality.
"I'm really struggling

with this slump now. I don't
want to walk around with a
frown, or take it out on my
friends," he said. "I have to
pep up a bit."
Once he gets out of his
slump, M oyer's first
priority is to help his team
get to the Nationals. Moyer
is a true team player. "I
have to concentrate on the
team getting to the Nation
als, and not on myself."
The senior hopes that his
team will win all Pac-10
home games and one game
on the road. "Then we will
be in good shape."
Hi s prediction for the Big
Splash, Stanford's water
polo competition against
UC-Berkeley on the day of
Big Game, is a Cardinal vic
tory "because we will have
home pool advantage."
Regarding his personal
future, Moyer sees himself
leaving the years of water
polo behind, and heading
in different directions. The
philosophy major aspires
to join the ministry and
study at a theological semi
nary.
Water polo has served its
purpose for Moyer."But
after college, once I hang
up my Speedo, I'm on to
new things."
