# Athletes' use of steriods: misguided, dangerous
## 
### ALEX TARG 
Despite clear evidence that
anabolic steroids can damage
one's health, athletes con
tinue to use these drugs on a
widespread basis in a mis
guided attempt to increase en
durance and strength.
The term, anabolic steroid,
describes a class of synthetic
derivitives of the male
hormone testosterone. Tes
tosterone in the blood stream
powerfully commands the
body to initiate a host of
chemical and structural
changes. These effects include
both the masculinizing and
muscle building seen at pu
berty and is responsible for
the transformation of boys
into men.
Chemists synthesized these
drugs to stimulate the
building-up, or anabolic,
processes in the body, en
deavoring to maximize the
tissue building and minimize
the masculinizing effects. In a
woman, repeated administra
tion of testosterone can cause
growth of facial hair,
deepened voice, body fat re
duction and increased sexual
desires.
Accepted medical use of
anabolic steroids includes ad
ministration to help patients
heal more rapidly after cer
tain types of surgery by ac
celerating protein synthesis
and muscle repair. Another
important application, supply
ing testosterone analogues to
male patients, relieves
hormone deficiencies which
prevent normal development
and sexual function.
However, recent evidence
suggests that athletes, not
patients, consume between 70
to 80 percent of the anabolic
steroids distributed in the
United States. Although
steroids are prescription
drugs, athletes can easily and
cheaply purchase them on the
black market.
From an athlete's point of
view, a drug which increases
muscle mass would be ideal
because increases in muscular
strength are directly propor
tional to increases in the

cross-sectional diameter of
the muscles being trained.
Despite the claims of its
proponents, steroids do not
tit this description. Although,
they may increase apparent
muscle volume, the actual
muscle tissue volume seems
little affected.
According to Dr. Allen
Rvan in Federation Proceed
ings (October 1981), the
claims made by some inves
tigators that the use of
anabolic steroids by male ath
letes in conjunction with pro
gressive weight resistance
training will afford a greater
increase in lean muscle bulk
and greater strength than
weight resistance training
alone are unsupported, and
there is a substantial body of
evidence that weight training
alone produces similar
results. "On the contrary,
there is a substantial body of
evidence that will stand very
close scrutiny to indicate that
anabolic steroids will not con
tribute significantly to gains in
lean muscle bulk or muscle
strength in healthy young
adult males," he said.
Studies show that muscles
sometimes get bigger with
steroid use, but they do not
get stronger. "The generally
observed increases in total
body weight are due to the
retention of salt and water,"
according to Ryan, and not
due to muscle development as
athletes had hoped. In sports
such as body building, foot
ball, weight lifting, as well as
javelin and discus throwing,
increased body mass may in
and of itself improve perfor
mance.
Describing another possi
ble effect, Ryan notes that
temporarily increased testos
terone levels may increase ag
gression and that this "might
then lead to a more vigorous
and sustained approach to
training, which could account
for the few small improve
ments."
According to Dr. Andy Hof
fman, assistant professor of
medicine at the Medical Cen
ter, "There is no scientific

proof that anabolic steroids
help build muscles in males,
but they may increase perfor
mance in woman athletes. Ad
ditionally, at the extraor
dinarily high steroid dosages
some athletes inflict upon
themselves, no one knows
what can happen since the
dangers are too great for con
trolled studies. However, at
least for women, the cosmetic
effects such as facial hair and
loss of subcutaneous fat are
serious enough to make the
drugs undesirable to most.
"Although chemists had
hoped to eliminate the mas
culinizing effects of these
drugs, so that women would
find them more acceptable for
conventional therapies, now
most people don t believe you
can make a drug which will
cause muscle mass increase
without masculinization," said
Hoffman.
Steroids administered in
tablet form pose a special haz
ard because they tend to
seriously damage the liver.
"In a clinical setting, when we
treat patients for hormone
deficiency, we almost never
use the oral androgens be
cause of the liver complica
tions. These include hepatitis,
and a disease which causes
lakes of blood to form in the
liver," he said.
Additional symptoms range
from a mild swelling of the
face due to water retention,
to decreased size and activity
of the testes, sometimes
leading to infertility.
Reliable methods used to
detect steroids in interna
tional competitions have so far
failed to discourage the use of
these drugs. Testing is costly
and counterproductive in that
it draws attention to drug use
and may actually encourage
male athletes to mistakenly
think they will gain a competi
tive edge through "doping."
"The only hope to get rid of
this practice in sports is by a
continuing and accelerated
program of education of
athletes, of all ages and all level,
and all those who coach and
supervise them," said Ryan.

program of education of
athletes, of all ages and all level,
and all those who coach and
supervise them," said Ryan.
Despite clear evidence that
anabolic steroids can damage
one's health, athletes con
tinue to use these drugs on a
widespread basis in a mis
guided attempt to increase en
durance and strength.
The term, anabolic steroid,
describes a class of synthetic
derivitives of the male
hormone testosterone. Tes
tosterone in the blood stream
powerfully commands the
body to initiate a host of
chemical and structural
changes. These effects include
both the masculinizing and
muscle building seen at pu
berty and is responsible for
the transformation of boys
into men.
Chemists synthesized these
drugs to stimulate the
building-up, or anabolic,
processes in the body, en
deavoring to maximize the
tissue building and minimize
the masculinizing effects. In a
woman, repeated administra
tion of testosterone can cause
growth of facial hair,
deepened voice, body fat re
duction and increased sexual
desires.
Accepted medical use of
anabolic steroids includes ad
ministration to help patients
heal more rapidly after cer
tain types of surgery by ac
celerating protein synthesis
and muscle repair. Another
important application, supply
ing testosterone analogues to
male patients, relieves
hormone deficiencies which
prevent normal development
and sexual function.
However, recent evidence
suggests that athletes, not
patients, consume between 70
to 80 percent of the anabolic
steroids distributed in the
United States. Although
steroids are prescription
drugs, athletes can easily and
cheaply purchase them on the
black market.
From an athlete's point of
view, a drug which increases
muscle mass would be ideal
because increases in muscular
strength are directly propor
tional to increases in the

cross-sectional diameter of
the muscles being trained.
Despite the claims of its
proponents, steroids do not
tit this description. Although,
they may increase apparent
muscle volume, the actual
muscle tissue volume seems
little affected.
According to Dr. Allen
Rvan in Federation Proceed
ings (October 1981), the
claims made by some inves
tigators that the use of
anabolic steroids by male ath
letes in conjunction with pro
gressive weight resistance
training will afford a greater
increase in lean muscle bulk
and greater strength than
weight resistance training
alone are unsupported, and
there is a substantial body of
evidence that weight training
alone produces similar
results. "On the contrary,
there is a substantial body of
evidence that will stand very
close scrutiny to indicate that
anabolic steroids will not con
tribute significantly to gains in
lean muscle bulk or muscle
strength in healthy young
adult males," he said.
Studies show that muscles
sometimes get bigger with
steroid use, but they do not
get stronger. "The generally
observed increases in total
body weight are due to the
retention of salt and water,"
according to Ryan, and not
due to muscle development as
athletes had hoped. In sports
such as body building, foot
ball, weight lifting, as well as
javelin and discus throwing,
increased body mass may in
and of itself improve perfor
mance.
Describing another possi
ble effect, Ryan notes that
temporarily increased testos
terone levels may increase ag
gression and that this "might
then lead to a more vigorous
and sustained approach to
training, which could account
for the few small improve
ments."
According to Dr. Andy Hof
fman, assistant professor of
medicine at the Medical Cen
ter, "There is no scientific

proof that anabolic steroids
help build muscles in males,
but they may increase perfor
mance in woman athletes. Ad
ditionally, at the extraor
dinarily high steroid dosages
some athletes inflict upon
themselves, no one knows
what can happen since the
dangers are too great for con
trolled studies. However, at
least for women, the cosmetic
effects such as facial hair and
loss of subcutaneous fat are
serious enough to make the
drugs undesirable to most.
"Although chemists had
hoped to eliminate the mas
culinizing effects of these
drugs, so that women would
find them more acceptable for
conventional therapies, now
most people don t believe you
can make a drug which will
cause muscle mass increase
without masculinization," said
Hoffman.
Steroids administered in
tablet form pose a special haz
ard because they tend to
seriously damage the liver.
"In a clinical setting, when we
treat patients for hormone
deficiency, we almost never
use the oral androgens be
cause of the liver complica
tions. These include hepatitis,
and a disease which causes
lakes of blood to form in the
liver," he said.
Additional symptoms range
from a mild swelling of the
face due to water retention,
to decreased size and activity
of the testes, sometimes
leading to infertility.
Reliable methods used to
detect steroids in interna
tional competitions have so far
failed to discourage the use of
these drugs. Testing is costly
and counterproductive in that
it draws attention to drug use
and may actually encourage
male athletes to mistakenly
think they will gain a competi
tive edge through "doping."
"The only hope to get rid of
this practice in sports is by a
continuing and accelerated
program of education of
athletes, of all ages and all level,
and all those who coach and
