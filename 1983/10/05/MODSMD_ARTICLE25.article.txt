# Ex-high school jocks keep playing

For most athletes, high school is the
plate where they achieve the greatest
athletic glor\. They find that when
they come to Stanford, the varsity
teams are stocked with scholarship
athletes, many of whom are among the
finest in the country.
How they react to this sudden shift
away from the thrills and glory of var
sity athletics varies. Some quickly ac
cept the situation and turn their atten
tion toward intramurals. Others plan
to tr\ out tor varsity teams their soph
omore year, spending freshman year
working out to make the squad. And
still others come in not expecting to
play at Stanford, but soon find they
miss being a part of a varsity team.

'Sure, it would be great to
play in front 12,000
people again, but that
doesn't take anything
away from IMs/

Easily, the largest number choose to
participate in intramurals. Over 45
percent of Stanford undergraduates
take part in this program, ranging in
skill from all-State players to raw
neophytes.
Director of Intramurals Howie Dal-
Imar said that the IM program at Stan
ford is a strong one. He thinks there is
a lot of good competition, and attri
butes this in part to the division of
manv sports into three skill levels.
"The intramurals are enjoyable,"
said Dallmar, "but they're also com
petitive because of the different divi
sions.'' Dallmar also pointed out that
since Stanford eliminated junior var
sity and freshman teams in several
sports, many athletes who would have
competed at these levels now play in
tramurals. >
The high interest in IMs is illustrated
by the existance of 230 basketball
teams and 180 football teams in the
"A", "B" and "C" divisions.
Senior Joe Coyne, assistant director
of intramurals, is one of the athletes
who immediately turned their atten
tion to IMs. At Servite High School in
Anaheim, California, Coyne was an all
league basketball player.
When he came to Stanford, Coyne
became involved in the intramural
program, not only as a player, but as a
referee. He began supervising during
his sophomore year, and last year did

much of the scheduling for the pro
gram.
Coyne said that most athletes who
play IMs don't play sports for glory
and recognition. "I don't think people
are out there to play before a crowd —
they're out there just to play the
game."
Coyne said that he didn't miss the
supposed glory of high school ath
letics because "for me, it wasn't really
ever there."
Another senior who said he feels
the same way is Stathi Marcopulos. He
was an all-sectional basketball player
at Lincoln High School in Stockton,
California, and played before 12,000
people in the Oakland Coliseum
during his high school career.
Marcopulos appreciated his expo
sure as a high school athlete, but has
taken to intramural play well, compet
ing in football and racquetball in addi
tion to basketball.
"Sure, it would be great to play in
front of 12,000 people again," he said,
"but that doesn't take anything away
from IMs. It's fun to go out and play
with the other guys, get involved in
the competition, and then go out and
have a few beers."
Upperclassmen seem to have ac
cepted the end of their varsity playing
days easier than some of this year's
freshmen. For freshman Rob Pietras
the goal of playing a varsity sport is
still there.
Pietras played tailback for St. Mary's
Prep outside of Detroit and made the
all-Catholic team in Detroit. Though
he is not yet on the team, Pietras is
currently working out on weightlifting
and running program reccommended
by the football coaching staff.
Pietras said that he wishes he were
playing football. "Hell, yeah, I miss it,"
he said. "That's the main reason I'm
going out." Pietras said he didn't miss
the big crowds of high school football
because, as he put it, "We never had
them. I want to play in college so I can
know what it's like to play before a big
crowd."
Another freshman who has designs
on making the football varsity is Chris
Pike. A tight end at Hawken School
outside of Cleveland, Pike made first
team all-Ohio and had 46 receptions
his senior year.
Pike is also working out on the foot
ball coaches' lifting and running pro
gram, and like Pietras, will go out for
the team in the spring. Pike, however,
does not long for a return to his
playing days just yet.

"I don't really miss it now, to tell you
the truth,"he said. "There are just too
many things happening here to worry
about football now." Both Pike and
Pietras do plan to play intramural foot
ball this fall.
John Dearborn is a freshman who
doesn't have to worry about being big
enough or fast enough or skilled
enough to make the varsity. At
Acalanes High School in Layfayette,
California, Dearborn was a high
school ail-American water polo player
who was ranked 11th in the U.S. in the
100-yard breaststroke in the 18-and
under age group.
Dearborn worked this summer to
help pay for tuition, and therefore
could not practice with the water polo
team. He has also decided to take the

'It's fun to go out. . . get
involved in the competi
tion, and then go out and
have a few beers/

year oft from competitive swimming,
though still working out on his own.
Dearborn isn't sure which sport he
will pursue, but he does expect to
make a varsity team next year. In the
meantime, he is playing intramural
football, and plans to participate in IM
swimming and water polo.
Steve Phillips is a sophomore who
didn't come to Stanford to be a varsity
athlete, but soon found he couldn't
stay away. Like Pike, Phillips went to
Hawken School, where he made first
team all-Ohio in basketball. Phillips,
however, wanted to stay away from
athletics and enjoy his freshman year.
"High school was just sports and
academics," he said. "Here, there's a
whole lot more to life."
Phillips found in spite of this that he
missed being a part of a team. "I went
to most of the basketball games, which
tempted me to go out," he said. "It was
very difficult. I wanted to be out on
the floor with the guys on the team."
Unlike most athletes in his position,
Phillips did not actively take part in in
tramurals. "I played a little bit of IMs,"
he said, "but I think it was good to get
to get away from it for a while."
Phillips admitted he missed the
recognition that went along with being
a varsity athlete. "It did bother me
when people asked me if I played bas
ketball and I had to say no."
Philips currently plans to walk on to
the basketball team this season.

the competition, and then go out and
have a few beers."
Upperclassmen seem to have ac
cepted the end of their varsity playing
days easier than some of this year's
freshmen. For freshman Rob Pietras
the goal of playing a varsity sport is
still there.
Pietras played tailback for St. Mary's
Prep outside of Detroit and made the
all-Catholic team in Detroit. Though
he is not yet on the team, Pietras is
currently working out on weightlifting
and running program reccommended
by the football coaching staff.
Pietras said that he wishes he were
playing football. "Hell, yeah, I miss it,"
he said. "That's the main reason I'm
going out." Pietras said he didn't miss
the big crowds of high school football
because, as he put it, "We never had
them. I want to play in college so I can
know what it's like to play before a big
crowd."
Another freshman who has designs
on making the football varsity is Chris
Pike. A tight end at Hawken School
outside of Cleveland, Pike made first
team all-Ohio and had 46 receptions
his senior year.
Pike is also working out on the foot
ball coaches' lifting and running pro
gram, and like Pietras, will go out for
the team in the spring. Pike, however,
does not long for a return to his
playing days just yet.

"I don't really miss it now, to tell you
the truth,"he said. "There are just too
many things happening here to worry
about football now." Both Pike and
Pietras do plan to play intramural foot
ball this fall.
John Dearborn is a freshman who
doesn't have to worry about being big
enough or fast enough or skilled
enough to make the varsity. At
Acalanes High School in Layfayette,
California, Dearborn was a high
school ail-American water polo player
who was ranked 11th in the U.S. in the
100-yard breaststroke in the 18-and
under age group.
Dearborn worked this summer to
help pay for tuition, and therefore
could not practice with the water polo
team. He has also decided to take the

'It's fun to go out. . . get
involved in the competi
tion, and then go out and
have a few beers/

year oft from competitive swimming,
though still working out on his own.
Dearborn isn't sure which sport he
will pursue, but he does expect to
make a varsity team next year. In the
meantime, he is playing intramural
football, and plans to participate in IM
swimming and water polo.
Steve Phillips is a sophomore who
didn't come to Stanford to be a varsity
athlete, but soon found he couldn't
stay away. Like Pike, Phillips went to
Hawken School, where he made first
team all-Ohio in basketball. Phillips,
however, wanted to stay away from
athletics and enjoy his freshman year.
"High school was just sports and
academics," he said. "Here, there's a
whole lot more to life."
Phillips found in spite of this that he
missed being a part of a team. "I went
to most of the basketball games, which
tempted me to go out," he said. "It was
very difficult. I wanted to be out on
the floor with the guys on the team."
Unlike most athletes in his position,
Phillips did not actively take part in in
tramurals. "I played a little bit of IMs,"
he said, "but I think it was good to get
to get away from it for a while."
Phillips admitted he missed the
recognition that went along with being
a varsity athlete. "It did bother me
when people asked me if I played bas
ketball and I had to say no."
Philips currently plans to walk on to
the basketball team this season.
For most athletes, high school is the
plate where they achieve the greatest
athletic glor\. They find that when
they come to Stanford, the varsity
teams are stocked with scholarship
athletes, many of whom are among the
finest in the country.
How they react to this sudden shift
away from the thrills and glory of var
sity athletics varies. Some quickly ac
cept the situation and turn their atten
tion toward intramurals. Others plan
to tr\ out tor varsity teams their soph
omore year, spending freshman year
working out to make the squad. And
still others come in not expecting to
play at Stanford, but soon find they
miss being a part of a varsity team.

'Sure, it would be great to
play in front 12,000
people again, but that
doesn't take anything
away from IMs/

Easily, the largest number choose to
participate in intramurals. Over 45
percent of Stanford undergraduates
take part in this program, ranging in
skill from all-State players to raw
neophytes.
Director of Intramurals Howie Dal-
Imar said that the IM program at Stan
ford is a strong one. He thinks there is
a lot of good competition, and attri
butes this in part to the division of
manv sports into three skill levels.
"The intramurals are enjoyable,"
said Dallmar, "but they're also com
petitive because of the different divi
sions.'' Dallmar also pointed out that
since Stanford eliminated junior var
sity and freshman teams in several
sports, many athletes who would have
competed at these levels now play in
tramurals. >
The high interest in IMs is illustrated
by the existance of 230 basketball
teams and 180 football teams in the
"A", "B" and "C" divisions.
Senior Joe Coyne, assistant director
of intramurals, is one of the athletes
who immediately turned their atten
tion to IMs. At Servite High School in
Anaheim, California, Coyne was an all
league basketball player.
When he came to Stanford, Coyne
became involved in the intramural
program, not only as a player, but as a
referee. He began supervising during
his sophomore year, and last year did

much of the scheduling for the pro
gram.
Coyne said that most athletes who
play IMs don't play sports for glory
and recognition. "I don't think people
are out there to play before a crowd —
they're out there just to play the
game."
Coyne said that he didn't miss the
supposed glory of high school ath
letics because "for me, it wasn't really
ever there."
Another senior who said he feels
the same way is Stathi Marcopulos. He
was an all-sectional basketball player
at Lincoln High School in Stockton,
California, and played before 12,000
people in the Oakland Coliseum
during his high school career.
Marcopulos appreciated his expo
sure as a high school athlete, but has
taken to intramural play well, compet
ing in football and racquetball in addi
tion to basketball.
"Sure, it would be great to play in
front of 12,000 people again," he said,
"but that doesn't take anything away
from IMs. It's fun to go out and play
