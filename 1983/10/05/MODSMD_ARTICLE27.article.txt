### 
The Great Race at Stanford will be held
Sunday at 9 a.m., and will start on Campus

This race is the favorite race of many
local joggers, and race director Oz

Federal Savings. Entry fees will benefit
the Cardinal Club for women's athletic
scholarships.
The Great Race has gained a reputation
as a premier event in the Bay Area due to
the fast and scenic course (five national
age-group records have been set in the
past), accurate results and Olympic-style

finish in the stadium.
"I have run four personal bests in this
event," said race volunteer Nancy Ditz.
"Each of us on the committee takes great
pride in the quality of the race and we're
constantly looking for ways to improve
it."
This year's race features separate start
ing lines for men and women to give
everyone, especially the front runners, a
faster start.
There will be tough competition in
every age group, with Sal Vasquezg

Jaclyn Caselli aiming for the national 60-64
10-kilometer record, and 88-year-old
Ivor Welch returning to defend his
"oldest finisher" title.
All finishers will be eligible for a
drawing for an RCA video cassette recor
der, and the elite runners will by vying
for $2000 in developmental prize money.
The entry fee is $4 on race day and a lim
