# Phillies shutout Dodgers on Schmidt home run
## 
### 
Los Angeles â€” Mike Schmidt hammered a
first-inning home run and Steve Carlton
made the single run stand up, with late
inning help from Al Holland, pitching the
Philadelphia Phillies to a 1-0 victory over the
Los Angeles Dodgers in last night's opening
game of the National League Championship
Series.
Carlton, baseball's all-time strikeout king,
hurled a masterful game into the eighth in
ning, outdueling Jerry Reuss in a battle of
southpaws before a Dodger Stadium crowd
of 49,963.
Schmidt provided him with an early run,
smashing a two-out homer in the first inning
against Reuss, who has been the Phillie slug
ger's favorite target over the years. It was
the 10th time Schmidt has connected against
the Dodger left-hander in his career and no
pitcher has surrendered more homers to
him.
It was to be the only run the NL East cham
pions would get this night but it was enough
for Carlton, the crafty 38-year-old left
hander who won the 300 th game of his
career Sept. 23.
He worked through a jam in the sixth in
ning and then got help from Holland when
the Dodgers loaded the bases in the eighth.
Steve Sax opened the sixth with his
second of three singles in the game. Carlton
had picked him off base the first time he
reached and Sax was more careful this time,
advancing to second on a sacrifice by Bill
Russell.
Then Carlton made one of his few
mistakes all night, uncorking a wild pitch on
his first delivery to Dusty Baker. Sax ad
vanced to third and came halfway home
before pulling up.
Now Carlton was in trouble. The Phillies
drew their infield in but the four-time Cy
Young Award winner made that unneces
sary, forcing Baker to pop up in front of the
plate. Three Phillies surrounded the ball

but it was Carlton who caught it.
That brought up the Dodgers' cleanup
hitter, Pedro Guerrero, who led the team
with 103 runs batted in. Carlton worked
carefully and, with the count 3-2, he walked
Guerrero, barely missing a called third
strike.
Young Mike Marshall was next and he was
simply overmatched. He fouled off the first
two pitches and then swung and missed at
strike three, leaving the runners stranded.
In the eighth, Carlton got into trouble
again. With one out, Sax punched his third
hit. After Russell popped up, Baker
dropped a single to right, sending Sax to
third.
Now, it was Guerrero's turn again and,
again, Carlton walked the Dodgers slugger.
That brought up Marshall and Phillies
Manager Paul Owens went to the ace of his
bullpen, Holland.
The left-hander, who saved Carlton's
300 th career victory, got Marshall into a 1-2
hole and then retired him on a line drive to
right.
Holland put out a threat in the ninth, after
Derrel Thomas got on through Schmidt's
two-out error and stole second, by getting
Greg Brock to ground out. Reuss' only
mistake came on a 1-1 pitch to Schmidt in the
first inning. The slugger, who led the majors
in home runs for the sixth time in his career
with 40 this season, sent a shot over the 395-
foot sign in left-center field. It was one of
just five hits the Phillies got off Ruess in
eight innings before Tom Niedenfuer
pitched the ninth.
The victory was only the second all season
for Philadelphia against the Dodgers. LA
won 11 of the 12 regular season contests,
beating Carlton twice.
Game 2 in the best-of-five series will be
played tonight with 19-game winner John
Denny going for the Phillies against Fer
nando Valenzuela, 15-10.
