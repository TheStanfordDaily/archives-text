# THE 						LIBRARIES OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY

### 
J983-84

Welcome to the Libraries of Stanford. This
publication has been designed to provide an
overview of the varied range of services and
facilities available to faculty, students, and
staff. These libraries are not only an
outstanding reservoir of knowledge and a
vast academic resource, but also a point of
access to regional and national scholarly
resources.
Those of you who are new to Stanford will
find this particularly valuable as an
introduction, but even those who are familiar
with the Libraries will find the results of
change. The rapid growth of computer and
communication technologies has combined
with the information explosion and greatly
increased publication levels to produce a
quiet revolution in the libraries. The most
notable recent development of this kind is
SOCRATES, Stanford's new online catalog
which debutes this Fall. But a glance at the
article titled "Facts of Note" will show that a
growing and significant number of scholars
utilize the skills of library staff for in-depth
searches of automated databases and that
the libraries engage in a surprising number of
cooperative programs. Those of you who
have used the libraries regularly have noticed
that library staff routinely use computer
terminals to respond to your information
requests and that every service point is now
equipped with at least one terminal.
These few manifestations of the essential
relationship between the new technologies
and the information function of the library
mask the depth and the power of the
changes taking place just as the Tiro Project
and the LOTS Program are only
symptomatic of the changes taking place in
the ways that scholars communicate with
each other and in the kinds of skills that the
University will impart to its students. The
Libraries are becoming vastly more complex
to use and profoundly different although they
retain the reading rooms and bookstacks of
the past. We encourage you to call upon the
expertise and assistance of library staff in
exploiting these resources to make your
research easier and your study time more
profitable.
