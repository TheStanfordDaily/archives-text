# SOCRATES ... Stanford's Online Catalog
## 
### 
Stanford's online catalog, named
ouCRATES, was made available to the
Stanford community this month via library
terminals and all other terminals connected
to the CIT 3081 A computer. Consisting of
over 900,000 records the database contains
material cataloged since 1973 in the Univer
sity Libraries, all material in the Meyer
Undergraduate Library and recent material
in the Libraries of Business, Food Research,
Hoover, Law and Medicine. The database of
books, serials, films, maps, records and
scores is increasing at about 90,000 to
100,000 records per year and represents
about 15% of the holdings of Stanford's libraries
Public access terminals for SOCRATES
will be in the Greer. Library, Meyer Library,
the Engineering Library and Biology Library
during 1983-84. However, anyone with a CIT

account at Stanford or anyplace in the
country will be able to use Stanford's online
catalog by just typing "Search Socrates"
after logging on. The name SOCRATES was
chosen to suggest the dialogue or question
and-answer way in which people usually
work with an online catalog.
SOCRATES can be searched in LOOKUP
mode, in which the user fills in the author,
title, or subject of an item or in the
COMMAND mode in which there are 13
indexes and a large number of commands to
search and display records. Lookup mode,
requiring no knowledge of the system, is
useful for a quick search for a title and
command mode is useful for complex
searches such as those involving several
topic words. In either mode, there is a
general help command and over 140 individual

help commands, such as "Help Indexes,"
that explain specific features of the online
catalog. Online help is supplemented by
printed guides, training sessions and
assistance from the library staff.
Development of the online catalog began
in January of this year and is a joint project
of ClT's Database Management Group
headed by John Sack and a University
Libraries Task Force headed by Associate
Director, James N. Myers. During the first
year of operation, the online catalog's
performance will be evaluated to plan for
future improvements and development. The
Libraries and CIT welcome comments or
suggestions from people using SOCRATES.
While online just type the command
SUGGEST and then enter any notes on
SOCRATES or the data which has been retrieved
