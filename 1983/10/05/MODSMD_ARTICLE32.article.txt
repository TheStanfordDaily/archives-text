The Libraries and the Humanist
In speaking of the libraries and the humanist or social scientist, one is
reminded that the historian may have a foot in both camps and hence may find
the dichotomy somewhat flawed. Historians should read both the humanities
and the social science statements.
With the exception of Art and Music, both of which are served by research
libraries of their own, the major humanities and history collections at Stanford
are housed in Green Library. The types of material found in these collections
include books; journals and other serial publications; government documents;
pamphlets, reports and working papers; newspapers; maps; photographs; and
archival and manuscript material. Some material in other formats is found in
the Music Library, e.g., phono-discs and musical scores; Meyer Library is the
location of Audio/Visual Services, and the Archive of Recorded Sound
contains tapes, discs and cylinders from the early 1900's to the present. Data
tapes, while housed in the Center for Information Technology (CIT), are
actually a part of Green Library's collections. For more information on data
tapes see the statement on Social Sciences.
Although much of this material is available in its original form, a great deal of
research material in microform is held by Green Library; and most of this is
found in the Current Periodicals, Newspaper and Microtext (CPM) Division or
the Lower Level of Green's East Wing. Current unbound periodicals and
newspapers are also shelved there. For more information on some of the
major microform collections one should consult Microtext Collections and
Series in the Humanities and Social Sciences, available at the Reference Desk,
or the collection of printed guides shelved in the CPM Division. Since the
contents of some of these microform collections are not fully reflected in the
Main Card Catalog, the Stanford Union List of Serials, SOCRATES
(Stanford's online catalog), or RLIN (Research Libraries Information Network),
one should inquire at the Reference Desk when in doubt.
Green Library serves as the principal bibliographic center for the Stanford
University Libraries, since it houses the Main Card Catalog and the General
Reference collection. The latter includes national and trade bibliographies from
many countries; printed catalogs of national libraries and major research
institutions; numerous specialized bibliographies, guides and research aids;
newspapers and periodical indexes; union lists and directories of periodicals,
newspapers and microforms; guides to archival and manuscript repositories;
encyclopedias; dictionaries; biographical compendiums, and other such
reference works. Some idea of the range of this material is given in Guide to
Selected Reference Materials, which is available at the Reference Desk.
Specialized reference collections may also be found in Special Collections and
the University Archives.
Together with some of the traditional printed sources listed above, the RLIN
database provides some bibliographic access to monographic and journal
holdings of a number of major research libraries; though neither their holdings
nor those of Stanford are completely listed in RLIN. RLIN can be particularly
useful in locating recently published works or for purposes of Interlibrary
borrowing. Staff at the Reference Desk or in the Interlibrary Services office
can assist researchers in finding locations for material not held by Stanford, as
can the staff in the Art and Music Libraries and the Government Documents
Department. RLIN terminals are located at public service desks throughout
the Library system.
In approaching the humanities and history collections in Green Library,
one's first recourse would normally be to the Main Card Catalog, since it
contains the most complete record of Stanford's holdings, or to the Stanford
Union List of Serials (SULS) for periodical holdings. The former is located on
the first level of Green Library. Copies of the latter, on microfiche, are located
in all campus Libraries. Commencing this September, users will have access to
the Stanford Libraries own online catalog SOCRATES. The Library and the
Center for Information Technology have developed the catalog, a SPIRES file,
which contains the holdings records for the Stanford University Libraries'
collections processed since 1973 and all of the Meyer Library collections.
Coordinate Libraries began the input of their collection data around 1978.
Initially, terminals will be located in the Green, Meyer, Engineering, and
Biology Libraries. Before SOCRATES, which allows users to retrieve
Stanford's holdings online, such information was only available by inquiring at
public servicc desks where library staff check the RLIN database in which
Stanford's records are interfiled with those of other libraries. Now users, with
the help of online aids and printed handouts, will have direct access to a
valuable part of Stanford's library holdings records. One should perhaps note
here that the Serials file in SOCRATES and RLIN is likely to be more accurate
than the SULS microfiche. It should also be noted that manuscripts and
archival collections are not represented in the Main Card Catalog or
SOCRATES or RLIN. Researchers should consult the staff in the Special
Collections Department and the University Archives for access to this
material.

Library staff at the Information Desk, adjacent to the Main Card Catalog,
can assist the researcher in using that Catalog,or SULS.or SOCRATES and
can check the RLIN database as weil. If there is any doubt as to whether Stan
ford holds the material, however, one should come to the General Reference
Desk. Staff there can assist one in finding alternative locations, or in finding
material at Stanford which may not be bibliographically accessible or is
otherwise difficult to find.
The staff in Art, Music, Government Documents, Special Collections, the
Archive of Recorded Sound and the Stanford University Archives can provide
more detailed information and specialized assistance with regard to their own
collections. The card catalogs in these branch libraries and departments also
provide more information, so far as their own collections are concerned, than
does the Main Card Catalog.
Information, reference and research assistance, including dissertation
consultation, is provided for the humanities and history generally by the
General Reference Department staff and by the curatorial staff of the
Collection Development Program (CDP) in Green Library. The staff of the Art
Library, the Music Library, Government Documents, the Archive of Recorded
Sound, Special Collections, and the Stanford University Archives provide a
similar service with regard to their own collections and areas of expertise.
A variety of bibliographic instruction and orientation is offered, ranging from
classroom lectures to individual or ad hoc presentations. Green Library has a
self-guided cassette tour available from the Graduate Reserve Desk and there
are staff guided tours at the beginning of Fall Quarter.
Computerized literature searching is available in the Art and Music Libraries
and the General Reference Department. Because such databases, unlike
RLIN, are available to us only from commercial vendors, it is necessary for the
Stanford University Libraries to charge a fee for such literature searches.
Examples of bibliographic databases (primarily journal and report literature)
searchable online include the MLA (Modern Language Association)
Bibliography; Historical Abstracts; the Philosopher's Index; America: History
•and Life; and the Comprehensive Dissertation Index. Historians may also be
interested in a number of other databases which are generally considered as
social science in nature.
Requests for purchase of material by Stanford should be directed to the
appropriate subject selector, or such requests can be made via the Suggestion
Box, at the Information Desk in Green Library. If in doubt one should inquire
at the Reference Desk.
FASTBOOK, which is managed by the Access Services Department in
Green Library, is a service designed to retrieve and deliver materials requested
by faculty, graduate students and academic staff from one Stanford Library to
another and to send a photocopy to office, home or campus library. There is a
charge for photocopy. The phone number is 497-FAST.
The U.C. Berkeley/Stanford Research Library Cooperatiue Progam allows
faculty, graduate students and academic staff to submit telephone requests for
materials or photocopy from U.C. Berkeley libraries, as well as on-site access
and borrowing. There is a charge for photocopy. This service normally
provides a more expeditious delivery of material than does traditional
interlibrary borrowing. On-site access and delivery is expedited by the
Gutenberg Express which operates between Berkeley and Stanford Monday
through Friday. There is a fee for riding on the Gutenberg Express.
1 raditional interlibrary borrowing for Stanford faculty and students is
provided by the Interlibrary Services Division in Green Library, which can
borrow material from Libraries around the country, including institutions
belonging to the Research Libraries Group (RLG) of which Stanford is a
member. Thus one has considerable access, either through borrowing the
ac tual item or by obtaining photocopy, to the collections of institutions such as
Yale University, the New York Public Library, University of Michigan, Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Rutgers, Princeton, and Columbia.

The Libraries and the Social Scientist
Researchers in the social sciences will not find their collections in a single
ocation; instead, they are housed in libraries across campus. While the major
soctal science collections tend to be in the Green Library stack and the
Jonsson Library of Government Documents, the Hoover Institution, and the
u i ier (jy ibrary, you may find material also, depending on your subject
interest, at the Lane Medical Library, the Jackson Library at the Graduate
School of Business, the Robert Crown Law Library, the Food Research
nstitute any of the science branches, Art, Music, or the Meyer Memorial
t:ACTDAni/ om ' :)enSate .' or s P ersa ' °112 collections, the library provides a
... service which delivers books from other campus locations to the
i rary you use most. Call 497-FAST to request a book from another campus
library.
