# COLLECTIONS AND SERVICES
## 
### 
The Libraries' collection number 5 million volumes and includes current
subscriptions to approximately 46,000 journal and other serial titles. Given the
size of the collection, its dispersion across campus, and varying bibliographic
organization, it may be difficult to locate all materials of interest. While the
card catalog in Green Library is the union catalog for Stanford's holdings, it is
not comprehensive â€” for example, it excludes most government documents,
computer tapes and the Meyer collection, and it does not provide subject
access to all materials on campus. If you are having difficulty locating material
of interest, it is wise to contact the reference staff of the library you are using.
Reference librarians will search the RLIN (Research Libraries Information
Network) database to look for recently acquired material which may not be
represented in the card catalog. They will also assist you in locating material
which is not owned by Stanford Libraries.
Starting this Fall the Stanford Libraries will have their own online catalog
SOCRATES. Initially, terminals will be located in the Green, Meyer,
Engineering, and Biology Libraries. The catalog, a SPIRES file developed by
the Library and the Center for Information Technology, contains the holdings
records for all of the Meyer Library collections and the Stanford University
Library collections processed since 1973. Coordinate Libraries began inputting
their collection data around 1978. SOCRATES will allow users to retrieve
Stanford's holdings online. Previously, users were able to access such informa
tion only through Library staff at public service desks where the RLIN
database was available. In RLIN, Stanford's records are incorporated with
those of other libraries making the file more difficult to use. SOCRATES will
have online aids, and printed handouts will also be available to assist users.
Each department or school in the social sciences is represented by a
bibliographer who is responsible for selecting material in certain subject areas
and for serving as liaison with the faculty and students. In addition to subject
bibliographers, there are also librarians who specialize in language and area
studies (e.g., Germanic, Slavic, Romance Languages, Iberian and Latin
American, African, Middle East, etc.) and in the selection of government
publications. The bibliographers welcome suggestions concerning the
collections and are available to discu#6 any concerns you may have regarding
collections or services. In addition, bibliographers will provide orientation
and/or instruction on either an ad hoc basis or as a part of classroom
instruction.
Stanford participates in a number of interlibrary loan arrangements in order
to provide access to materials not available on campus. Our cooperative
arrangement with the University of California at Berkeley provides access to
another major research collection within easy reach. Faculty members, gradu
ate students, and academic staff may apply at the Privileges Desk at Green
Library for a Cooperative Program Card which entitles the user to request
books by telephone from Berkeley and have them delivered to Green via the
Gutenberg Express. The Gutenberg Express also provides round-trip
transportation between Stanford and Berkeley for a fee of $4.50 per person.
Reservations are not necessary.
For material available at neither Stanford nor Berkeley, you may fill out an
Interlibrary Loan request. Many interlibrary loan requests are now transmitted
by electronic mail making the process considerably faster and more effective
than it has been in the past. In addition, the Stanford libraries have joined a
number of other research libraries in a network used to expedite each other's
requests. These systems have allowed libraries to make the best use of their
own resources while also being able to draw on a wider pool of resources from
other institutions.
In addition to traditional reference services, most libraries on campus
provide a fee-based computerized information retrieval system. Many of the
databases searched have print equivalents such as the Social Science Citation
Index and Dissertation Abstracts International. Computerized searches are
advantageous as they save time necessary for a thorough manual search and
they provide the capability of linking search terms in a manner which is not
normally available in print indexes. For example, a search may be structured
to retrieve only those articles pertaining to the delivery of health services to
Hispanics in California. The charge for this service is based on the connect
time with each database searched and the number of citations printed. The
average cost for a search is $30. General Reference and Cubberley staff
provide most of the searches in the social sciences.
The Libraries have many materials which are not necessarily represented in
the card catalog. Such materials include U.S., U.N., and California
government documents, Machine-Readable Data Files (MRDF), maps, films,
sound recordings, manuscripts, and archival materials. Stanford is a
depository library for U.S., U.N., and California government documents and
has sizeable collections of foreign documents, international, and state and local
documents as well. Most depository documents are not found in the main
catalog in Green Library and you should consult the catalog and reference
staff in the Jonsson Library of Government Documents (Green Library) to
locate material of interest in this area. The Documents Library also holds
major reference tools such as the Monthly Catalog and the American Statistics Index

The Stanford University Libraries and the Center for Information
Technology (CIT) provide access to several hundred machine-readable data
files. The data is predominately, although not exclusively, of interest to social
scientists and runs the gamut from election returns to public opinion polls and
has a wide geographical and chronological range. Many of the files come from
the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research in Ann
Arbor, Michigan through our membership supported by the Department of
Political Science. The most up-to-date list of data holdings is the Data File
Directory, which is available as a public file on SPIRES. If a researcher is inter
ested in data which does not appear in the Directory, contact the subject
bibliographer for the discipline or contact Karen Wittenborg, General
Reference, Green Library (497-1811). The Libraries also support a member
ship in the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. Typically, codebooks
for MRDF are shelved in Green Library or in the appropriate branch, and the
tapes themselves are kept at the Center for Information Technology.
Most of the maps are housed in either the Central Map Collection, Green
Library (West Wing) or in Branner Earth Sciences Library. The Central Map
Collection has approximately 75,000 maps ranging from the 18th century to
the present day and covering a number of subjects (agriculture, population,
climate, etc.) on a worldwide basis. In addition to sheet maps, a number of wall
maps are available to support teaching. Few maps are represented in the card
catalog, so it is wise to consult the map catalog and the map specialist directly.
The Audio/Visual Services unit in the Meyer Memorial Library is the best
source of information concerning films and other audio/visual materials. Meyer
also operates a film rental service for classroom instruction. While most
recordings may be found in this location, there are also social science sound
recordings (mostly in linguistics) in the Archive of Recorded Sound.
Manuscript material and holdings of the University Archives are also not
represented, at present, in the card catalog. Consult with the General
Reference staff or with Special Collections and Archives if such material is of
interest.
Current issues of the most heavily used periodicals may be found in the
Current Periodicals and Microtext Room in the Lower Level of Green Library
East. Recent issues of newspapers will be found there as well as the
microfilmed backruns. Major microfilm sets (including the Human Relations
Area Files) are housed in the same area and are accompanied by viewing
equipment and several reader/printers. Portable microfilm/fiche readers are
available for use in your home or office.
A variety of assistance in using the library is available depending on the level
of need. Green Library offers a self guided cassette tour which is available
from the Graduate Reserve Desk on the main floor of Green Library. Green
Library staff also provides regularly scheduled tours at the beginning of the
Fall Quarter. Other tours may be arranged by request to the General
Reference Department or by contacting the bibliographer or curator of the
subject area. Bibliographers provide dissertation consultations at an
individual's request and will provide course-related library instruction upon a
faculty member's request. The bibliographers are also generally available on a
more informal basis to assist with a specialized reference question.
The Libraries' staff is interested in shaping the collections and services to
best meet the research and teaching needs of the faculty and students. If you
have any suggestions, comments, or criticisms, please feel free to make them
either in person (to the bibliographer, curator or individual responsible in a
given area) or through the suggestion box in Green Library.

access to all materials on campus. If you are having difficulty locating material
of interest, it is wise to contact the reference staff of the library you are using.
Reference librarians will search the RLIN (Research Libraries Information
Network) database to look for recently acquired material which may not be
represented in the card catalog. They will also assist you in locating material
which is not owned by Stanford Libraries.
Starting this Fall the Stanford Libraries will have their own online catalog
SOCRATES. Initially, terminals will be located in the Green, Meyer,
Engineering, and Biology Libraries. The catalog, a SPIRES file developed by
the Library and the Center for Information Technology, contains the holdings
records for all of the Meyer Library collections and the Stanford University
Library collections processed since 1973. Coordinate Libraries began inputting
their collection data around 1978. SOCRATES will allow users to retrieve
Stanford's holdings online. Previously, users were able to access such informa
tion only through Library staff at public service desks where the RLIN
database was available. In RLIN, Stanford's records are incorporated with
those of other libraries making the file more difficult to use. SOCRATES will
have online aids, and printed handouts will also be available to assist users.
Each department or school in the social sciences is represented by a
bibliographer who is responsible for selecting material in certain subject areas
and for serving as liaison with the faculty and students. In addition to subject
bibliographers, there are also librarians who specialize in language and area
studies (e.g., Germanic, Slavic, Romance Languages, Iberian and Latin
American, African, Middle East, etc.) and in the selection of government
publications. The bibliographers welcome suggestions concerning the
collections and are available to discu#6 any concerns you may have regarding
collections or services. In addition, bibliographers will provide orientation
and/or instruction on either an ad hoc basis or as a part of classroom
instruction.
Stanford participates in a number of interlibrary loan arrangements in order
to provide access to materials not available on campus. Our cooperative
arrangement with the University of California at Berkeley provides access to
another major research collection within easy reach. Faculty members, gradu
ate students, and academic staff may apply at the Privileges Desk at Green
Library for a Cooperative Program Card which entitles the user to request
books by telephone from Berkeley and have them delivered to Green via the
Gutenberg Express. The Gutenberg Express also provides round-trip
transportation between Stanford and Berkeley for a fee of $4.50 per person.
Reservations are not necessary.
For material available at neither Stanford nor Berkeley, you may fill out an
Interlibrary Loan request. Many interlibrary loan requests are now transmitted
by electronic mail making the process considerably faster and more effective
than it has been in the past. In addition, the Stanford libraries have joined a
number of other research libraries in a network used to expedite each other's
requests. These systems have allowed libraries to make the best use of their
own resources while also being able to draw on a wider pool of resources from
other institutions.
In addition to traditional reference services, most libraries on campus
provide a fee-based computerized information retrieval system. Many of the
databases searched have print equivalents such as the Social Science Citation
Index and Dissertation Abstracts International. Computerized searches are
advantageous as they save time necessary for a thorough manual search and
they provide the capability of linking search terms in a manner which is not
normally available in print indexes. For example, a search may be structured
to retrieve only those articles pertaining to the delivery of health services to
Hispanics in California. The charge for this service is based on the connect
time with each database searched and the number of citations printed. The
average cost for a search is $30. General Reference and Cubberley staff
provide most of the searches in the social sciences.
The Libraries have many materials which are not necessarily represented in
the card catalog. Such materials include U.S., U.N., and California
government documents, Machine-Readable Data Files (MRDF), maps, films,
sound recordings, manuscripts, and archival materials. Stanford is a
depository library for U.S., U.N., and California government documents and
has sizeable collections of foreign documents, international, and state and local
documents as well. Most depository documents are not found in the main
catalog in Green Library and you should consult the catalog and reference
staff in the Jonsson Library of Government Documents (Green Library) to
locate material of interest in this area. The Documents Library also holds
major reference tools such as the Monthly Catalog and the American Statistics Index

The Stanford University Libraries and the Center for Information
Technology (CIT) provide access to several hundred machine-readable data
files. The data is predominately, although not exclusively, of interest to social
scientists and runs the gamut from election returns to public opinion polls and
has a wide geographical and chronological range. Many of the files come from
the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research in Ann
Arbor, Michigan through our membership supported by the Department of
Political Science. The most up-to-date list of data holdings is the Data File
Directory, which is available as a public file on SPIRES. If a researcher is inter
ested in data which does not appear in the Directory, contact the subject
bibliographer for the discipline or contact Karen Wittenborg, General
Reference, Green Library (497-1811). The Libraries also support a member
ship in the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. Typically, codebooks
for MRDF are shelved in Green Library or in the appropriate branch, and the
tapes themselves are kept at the Center for Information Technology.
Most of the maps are housed in either the Central Map Collection, Green
Library (West Wing) or in Branner Earth Sciences Library. The Central Map
Collection has approximately 75,000 maps ranging from the 18th century to
the present day and covering a number of subjects (agriculture, population,
climate, etc.) on a worldwide basis. In addition to sheet maps, a number of wall
maps are available to support teaching. Few maps are represented in the card
catalog, so it is wise to consult the map catalog and the map specialist directly.
The Audio/Visual Services unit in the Meyer Memorial Library is the best
source of information concerning films and other audio/visual materials. Meyer
also operates a film rental service for classroom instruction. While most
recordings may be found in this location, there are also social science sound
recordings (mostly in linguistics) in the Archive of Recorded Sound.
Manuscript material and holdings of the University Archives are also not
represented, at present, in the card catalog. Consult with the General
Reference staff or with Special Collections and Archives if such material is of
interest.
Current issues of the most heavily used periodicals may be found in the
Current Periodicals and Microtext Room in the Lower Level of Green Library
East. Recent issues of newspapers will be found there as well as the
microfilmed backruns. Major microfilm sets (including the Human Relations
Area Files) are housed in the same area and are accompanied by viewing
equipment and several reader/printers. Portable microfilm/fiche readers are
available for use in your home or office.
A variety of assistance in using the library is available depending on the level
of need. Green Library offers a self guided cassette tour which is available
from the Graduate Reserve Desk on the main floor of Green Library. Green
Library staff also provides regularly scheduled tours at the beginning of the
Fall Quarter. Other tours may be arranged by request to the General
Reference Department or by contacting the bibliographer or curator of the
subject area. Bibliographers provide dissertation consultations at an
individual's request and will provide course-related library instruction upon a
faculty member's request. The bibliographers are also generally available on a
more informal basis to assist with a specialized reference question.
The Libraries' staff is interested in shaping the collections and services to
best meet the research and teaching needs of the faculty and students. If you
have any suggestions, comments, or criticisms, please feel free to make them
either in person (to the bibliographer, curator or individual responsible in a
given area) or through the suggestion box in Green Library.

The Libraries' collection number 5 million volumes and includes current
subscriptions to approximately 46,000 journal and other serial titles. Given the
size of the collection, its dispersion across campus, and varying bibliographic
organization, it may be difficult to locate all materials of interest. While the
card catalog in Green Library is the union catalog for Stanford's holdings, it is
not comprehensive â€” for example, it excludes most government documents,
