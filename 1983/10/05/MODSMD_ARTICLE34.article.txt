The Libraries and the Scientist & Engineer
Dispersal of Literature
Engineering and natural sciences collections are dispersed among the research
branches of the Stanford University Libraries (SUL), the Lane Medical Library
at the Stanford Medical Center, and the Libraries at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC). This brief introduction emphasizes the collections
and services of the research branches of the Stanford University Libraries,
composed of the Branner Earth Sciences Library, the Engineering Library,
Falconer Biology Library, the Hopkins Marine Station Library in Pacific Grove,
California, the Mathematical and Computer Sciences Library, the Physics
Library, and Swain Library of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. A
description of each of these libraries' collections along with the other library
collections on campus is found later in this handout. The map on the back
page will help you locate these branches.
In addition to the SUL science branch libraries, Lane Medical Library, and
SLAC libraries, literature of interest to engineering students and researchers
may be found in the Jackson Library of the Graduate School of Business. The
Jonsson Library of Government Documents, housed in the Green Library,
augments the collections of the science/engineering branches for
environmental engineering, energy studies, pollution, earth sciences, natural
resources, and the social sciences aspects of engineering and the natural
sciences. The Energy Information Center also augments the collections at
Engineering, Physics, Branner, Swain, and SLAC in energy studies.
To compensate for the dispersal of collections, the library provides a
FASTBOOK service which delivers books from other campus locations to the
library you use most. Call 497 FAST to request a book from another campus
location. The Stanford community may borrow materials from the Hopkins
Marine Station Library in Pacific Grove through Interlibrary Loan, by inquiring
at the Reference Desk in Green Library, or at the Falconer Biology Library.
Advanced Research & Undergraduate Education
The research branch libraries strive to provide the literature support for
research and graduate educational programs of Stanford faculty, students, and
postdoctorates. The research branches have also taken on an increasing role
in providing learning resources for undergraduates. Thus, through their course
reserves, videotaped lectures, undergraduate bibliographic instruction, and
study hall facilities, they have begun to take on the character of specialized
Learning Resource Centers, complementing some of the Meyer
Undergraduate Library's functions for science and engineering students.
Cooperative Agreements with Other Libraries
No single university nowadays is able to stock its libraries with totally
comprehensive collections to cover every discipline and subdiscipline.
Accordingly, Stanford University Libraries extends its ability to provide
literature by making effective use of several cooperative agreements with other
libraries. The most heavily used of these is the Stanford/U.C. Berkeley
Cooperative Program. Graduate students, postdoctorates, and faculty may
obtain a Cooperative Program Card from the Privileges Desk at Green Library
by presenting Stanford ID. The card entitles a user to request books by
telephone from U.C. Berkeley, and have them delivered to Green Library via
the Gutenberg Express. The Gutenberg Express also provides round trip
transportation between the two campuses for $4.50. U.C. Berkeley students
and faculty receive reciprocal privileges with the Stanford Libraries, of course.
For materials available at neither Berkeley nor Stanford, Stanford users may
fill out Interlibrary Loan requests at any public service desk. In recent years
more types of materials have become available through Interlibrary Loan and
the time it takes to receive materials has decreased largely because of
Stanford's membership in the Research Libraries Group (RLG). RLG
Libraries, which include Yale, University of Michigan, the New York Public
Library, and dozens of other major research institutions, grant high priority to
each others interlibrary loan requests, and are also developing electronic
technologies capable of expediting loans.
Informal agreements exist among the SUL science branches and several
local special libraries, including NASA/Ames, GTE/Sylvania, and Lawrence
Livermore Laboratories. These agreements permit us to offer very quick ser
vice for technical reports, engineering standards and specification patents, and
other literature requested too infrequently to justify our buying for the Stan
ford Libraries. Often, the reports and other materials obtained through these
agreements are simply given away to the requestor, who is then responsible
for sharing with interested colleagues.
Reference Services
Professional reference librarians are available during normal daytime working
hours to assist you in finding the literature you need. We invite reference

queries from the Stanford community in person or by phone.
All the science research branches on the main campus offer online
computerized literature searching, providing comprehensive, precise
bibliographies of journal articles and technical reports on a requestor's
specialized topic of interest. Typical searches range in cost from $5 to $70;
more extensive searches may cost more. Library users are invited to inquire
into learning to do their own computer searching or they may simply rely on
the librarian as an intermediary. Extensive collections of printed indexes to
journal articles are also available in the branches. The librarians are very
familiar with these indexes and will gladly help you find what you need.
Formal bibliographic instruction by a professional librarian is available at the
request of faculty, teaching assistants, or groups of students. Instruction may
be incorporated into existing academic courses, or may be presented as
separate seminars, at the discretion of the requestors. A special orientation to
the Engineering Library is offered for foreign language students; contact
Charles Early (497-9164) for more information.
Each branch library has its own card catalog with listings of books and
journals in that individual branch. In addition, the Research Libraries Group's
computerized catalog, RLIN, can discover the existence and location of
materials catalogued since 1973 at most Stanford libraries, as well at the other
RLG libraries. A Stanford-only online catalog, SOCRATES, will be available
for public access beginning this quarter. The catalog is easy to use and can be
accessed by anyone with a computing account at the Center for Information
Technology (CIT). Moreover, free-use terminals are to be available in the En
gineering Library and in the Falconer Biology Library this year, as well as in
the Green Library and Meyer Undergraduate Library. Later, free-use terminals
will be available in all Stanford Libraries. We urge you to try out SOCRATES,
which promises to be a very powerful replacement of the card catalog in future
years. Library staff are eager to assist you in learning the initial steps, so ask
us for help when you want to start using SOCRATES.

and faculty receive reciprocal privileges with the Stanford Libraries, of course.
For materials available at neither Berkeley nor Stanford, Stanford users may
fill out Interlibrary Loan requests at any public service desk. In recent years
more types of materials have become available through Interlibrary Loan and
the time it takes to receive materials has decreased largely because of
Stanford's membership in the Research Libraries Group (RLG). RLG
Libraries, which include Yale, University of Michigan, the New York Public
Library, and dozens of other major research institutions, grant high priority to
each others interlibrary loan requests, and are also developing electronic
technologies capable of expediting loans.
Informal agreements exist among the SUL science branches and several
local special libraries, including NASA/Ames, GTE/Sylvania, and Lawrence
Livermore Laboratories. These agreements permit us to offer very quick ser
vice for technical reports, engineering standards and specification patents, and
other literature requested too infrequently to justify our buying for the Stan
ford Libraries. Often, the reports and other materials obtained through these
agreements are simply given away to the requestor, who is then responsible
for sharing with interested colleagues.
Reference Services
Professional reference librarians are available during normal daytime working
hours to assist you in finding the literature you need. We invite reference

queries from the Stanford community in person or by phone.
All the science research branches on the main campus offer online
computerized literature searching, providing comprehensive, precise
bibliographies of journal articles and technical reports on a requestor's
specialized topic of interest. Typical searches range in cost from $5 to $70;
more extensive searches may cost more. Library users are invited to inquire
into learning to do their own computer searching or they may simply rely on
the librarian as an intermediary. Extensive collections of printed indexes to
journal articles are also available in the branches. The librarians are very
familiar with these indexes and will gladly help you find what you need.
Formal bibliographic instruction by a professional librarian is available at the
request of faculty, teaching assistants, or groups of students. Instruction may
be incorporated into existing academic courses, or may be presented as
separate seminars, at the discretion of the requestors. A special orientation to
the Engineering Library is offered for foreign language students; contact
Charles Early (497-9164) for more information.
Each branch library has its own card catalog with listings of books and
journals in that individual branch. In addition, the Research Libraries Group's
computerized catalog, RLIN, can discover the existence and location of
materials catalogued since 1973 at most Stanford libraries, as well at the other
RLG libraries. A Stanford-only online catalog, SOCRATES, will be available
for public access beginning this quarter. The catalog is easy to use and can be
accessed by anyone with a computing account at the Center for Information
Technology (CIT). Moreover, free-use terminals are to be available in the En
gineering Library and in the Falconer Biology Library this year, as well as in
the Green Library and Meyer Undergraduate Library. Later, free-use terminals
will be available in all Stanford Libraries. We urge you to try out SOCRATES,
which promises to be a very powerful replacement of the card catalog in future
years. Library staff are eager to assist you in learning the initial steps, so ask
us for help when you want to start using SOCRATES.

The Libraries and the Scientist & Engineer
Dispersal of Literature
Engineering and natural sciences collections are dispersed among the research
branches of the Stanford University Libraries (SUL), the Lane Medical Library
at the Stanford Medical Center, and the Libraries at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC). This brief introduction emphasizes the collections
and services of the research branches of the Stanford University Libraries,
composed of the Branner Earth Sciences Library, the Engineering Library,
Falconer Biology Library, the Hopkins Marine Station Library in Pacific Grove,
California, the Mathematical and Computer Sciences Library, the Physics
Library, and Swain Library of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. A
description of each of these libraries' collections along with the other library
collections on campus is found later in this handout. The map on the back
page will help you locate these branches.
In addition to the SUL science branch libraries, Lane Medical Library, and
SLAC libraries, literature of interest to engineering students and researchers
may be found in the Jackson Library of the Graduate School of Business. The
Jonsson Library of Government Documents, housed in the Green Library,
augments the collections of the science/engineering branches for
environmental engineering, energy studies, pollution, earth sciences, natural
resources, and the social sciences aspects of engineering and the natural
sciences. The Energy Information Center also augments the collections at
Engineering, Physics, Branner, Swain, and SLAC in energy studies.
To compensate for the dispersal of collections, the library provides a
FASTBOOK service which delivers books from other campus locations to the
library you use most. Call 497 FAST to request a book from another campus
location. The Stanford community may borrow materials from the Hopkins
Marine Station Library in Pacific Grove through Interlibrary Loan, by inquiring
at the Reference Desk in Green Library, or at the Falconer Biology Library.
Advanced Research & Undergraduate Education
The research branch libraries strive to provide the literature support for
research and graduate educational programs of Stanford faculty, students, and
postdoctorates. The research branches have also taken on an increasing role
in providing learning resources for undergraduates. Thus, through their course
reserves, videotaped lectures, undergraduate bibliographic instruction, and
study hall facilities, they have begun to take on the character of specialized
Learning Resource Centers, complementing some of the Meyer
Undergraduate Library's functions for science and engineering students.
Cooperative Agreements with Other Libraries
No single university nowadays is able to stock its libraries with totally
comprehensive collections to cover every discipline and subdiscipline.
Accordingly, Stanford University Libraries extends its ability to provide
literature by making effective use of several cooperative agreements with other
libraries. The most heavily used of these is the Stanford/U.C. Berkeley
Cooperative Program. Graduate students, postdoctorates, and faculty may
obtain a Cooperative Program Card from the Privileges Desk at Green Library
by presenting Stanford ID. The card entitles a user to request books by
telephone from U.C. Berkeley, and have them delivered to Green Library via
the Gutenberg Express. The Gutenberg Express also provides round trip
transportation between the two campuses for $4.50. U.C. Berkeley students
and faculty receive reciprocal privileges with the Stanford Libraries, of course.
For materials available at neither Berkeley nor Stanford, Stanford users may
fill out Interlibrary Loan requests at any public service desk. In recent years
