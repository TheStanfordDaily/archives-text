Library Services for the Undergraduate
Undergraduates are welcome to use any of Stanford's Libraries. The J. Henry
Meyer Memorial Library, located at the junction of Escondido Road and
Galvez Mall, and known to most students as "UGLI", has collections and
services specifically designed to support the undergraduate curriculum.
Collections
Meyer's book collections are somewhat stronger in the social sciences and
humanities than in the pure and applied sciences or technology; but the
Library is the main housing facility for all collections in non-book formats,
regardless of subject. Research collections in the social sciences and
humanities are housed in the Cecil H. Green Library, which also contains
several centralized departments, such as Government Documents and Special
Collections. The other parts of the Stanford University Libraries (SUL) system
include three research branches in the social sciences and humanities: Art,
Music, and Education; the Archive of Recorded Sound; and six campus
science branches: Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Biology,
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Physics, and Earth Sciences. One
additional science library, in the field of marine biology, is located at the
Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, just south of Monterey.
There are also six Coordinate Libraries which are part of the University's
professional schools; law, business, and medicine, and its institutes and
research centers: Hoover, Food Research, and SLAC. Undergraduates may
use the Coordinate Libraries when they contain unique materials needed as
part of the student's program.
Since the Meyer Library's particular focus is on curriculum support, most
students will find that this library serves as a good starting point. It provides
most undergraduate course reserves, library instruction, and individualized
term paper help, along with such practical necessities as calculators,
photocopy machines, and coin-op typewriters.
Services
Each Autumn Quarter, Meyer offers tours to freshmen and transfer students.
These tours, which last approximately thirty minutes, take students to
selected areas of the first and second floors and include information about the
lay-out of the physical facility, location of basic services, and circulation
policies. Students who are unable to take one of these tours can pick up a
printed Self-Guided Tour near the second floor reference desk. This will
provide similar information at an individual pace.
Instruction in library use is available to students in several ways. The second
floor reference desk is staffed during most hours. Librarians here will answer
basic informational questions, provide guidance with the Library's catalog, or
help students to find information in library materials. Instruction is also
provided through one-hour lectures that are associated with the library needs
of a particular class, such as Freshmen English, or in Library I, a three-credit
course taught each quarter during the academic year. There are also a
number of short printed handouts or longer guides available to assist students.
Meyer offers a Term Paper Advisory Service, whereby students make an
appointment with a library subject specialist or bibliographer and receive indi
vidual help with their term paper research. The Jonsson Library of
Government Documents provides a similar service to undergraduates needing
information found in documents.
Library Catalogs
One of the first things that undergraduate students must learn is how to use
the library catalogs.
The Green Library contains the main card catalog for all of the Stanford
libraries, providing author, title, and subject access to all SUL libraries except
Meyer, and partial information, usually by author only, for the Coordinate
Libraries. This catalog is arranged in "dictionary" form, with authors, titles,
and subjects interfiled in a single alphabet.
The Meyer Library has never used a card catalog. Historically, the Library
used a "book catalog," a computer-produced listing, bound in a book-like
format. In 1979, Meyer moved to a "COM" (computer-output microform)
catalog in fiche format. Both of these catalogs were "divided," that is, authors
and titles were listed in one alphabet and subjects, both topical and personal,
appeared in another. Initially, books and audio/visual materials were listed in
separate catalogs; but materials in all formats, e.g., books, sound recordings,
motion picture films, can now be found in the same catalog. Undergraduate
course reserves are listed in a separate COM catalog by author, title,.and
course number.
In addition to card and COM catalogs, the Libraries now have an online
catalog, which contains records in machine readable format for all holdings of
the Meyer Library and for materials processed since approximately the mid-

1970's for all other Stanford University Libraries. Most of the Coordinate
Libraries began to use the system in the late 70s, so these files are less
complete than those of other libraries. Although this type of catalog has been
available to library staff through the Research Libraries Information Network
(RLIN) for some time, users have not been able to use the online catalog
directly. However, beginning this Fall, the catalog will be available through the
Center for Information Technology (CIT) as a SPIRES file; and students will be
able to access the online catalog, called SOCRATES, through terminals
located initially in the Meyer Library, Green Library, and the Engineering and
Biology Libraries. Over a period of time, terminals will be made available in all
campus libraries. The online catalog will provide much greater searching
flexibility than the Libraries' printed catalogs and will help users to find needed
materials housed in several libraries via a terminal located in a different library.
For example, a student using the online catalog in Meyer will be able to find a
book in Meyer, another copy of this same book in the Biology Library, and
another book by the same author in the Chemistry Library. Non-book
materials, such as sound recordings and video tapes, will also be accessible
through the online catalog. Since the online catalog will be new this year, all
students, whether new or returning, will be facing a big change. The catalog
will have online aids, supplemented by printed handouts; and the library staff
will also assist users in becoming familiar with this helpful new tool.
Finding & Using Materials
Finding materials in the various campus libraries is usually facilitated by
posters or guides giving the locations of various call numbers. Most Stanford
Libraries currently shelve materials according to the Library of Congress "LC"
classification number, but many libraries also have older materials in the
Dewey classification. Some libraries or collections, such as Government
Documents, use other specialized classification systems because of the nature
of their materials. In the Meyer Library, all books are shelved by LC call
number. Reference materials and periodicals/newspapers are shelved
separately in two wings of the second floor. All of the Library's audio/visual
collections are on the first floor.
As with the catalogs and classification systems, loan periods and circulation
policies vary from library to library. Students should pick up copies of the
policies in the different libraries that they use and become familiar with them.
For example, do books circulate to undergraduates for two weeks or four?
Can two-hour reserve materials be taken out overnight? Are there fees for
items which are returned late or only for materials that have been recalled? In
the Meyer Library, all books, except those on course reserve, circulate for
four weeks and may be renewed if not needed by another borrower. Books on
reserve for courses circulate for two hours or one, two, or three days and may
be taken out overnight beginning two hours before the library closes.
Audio/visual materials, reference books, and periodicals must be used in the
library buildings.
All libraries require students to present their Stanford ID's when charging
out materials. Some libraries, such as Green and the Jackson Library of the
Graduate School of Business, also require identification to enter the facility.
The Meyer Library and several others require students to present library
materials as they leave the building. This ensures that all items have been
properly charged out.
The Stanford libraries are large and complex, but they contain a wealth of
information. Students should use the full range of library resources, both per
sonal and physical, that are available to them as a part of their education. We,
in the Libraries, want your undergraduate library study and research to be a
positive experience, one which opens new doors that will help you to be an
efficient and effective user of information, in whatever format, for the rest of
your life. Many of the libraries have "Action Boxes" so that students can
provide feedback on our collections or services; we invite you to use these or
to give us your comments in person. We welcome them !

Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Physics, and Earth Sciences. One
additional science library, in the field of marine biology, is located at the
Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California, just south of Monterey.
There are also six Coordinate Libraries which are part of the University's
professional schools; law, business, and medicine, and its institutes and
research centers: Hoover, Food Research, and SLAC. Undergraduates may
use the Coordinate Libraries when they contain unique materials needed as
part of the student's program.
Since the Meyer Library's particular focus is on curriculum support, most
students will find that this library serves as a good starting point. It provides
most undergraduate course reserves, library instruction, and individualized
term paper help, along with such practical necessities as calculators,
photocopy machines, and coin-op typewriters.
Services
Each Autumn Quarter, Meyer offers tours to freshmen and transfer students.
These tours, which last approximately thirty minutes, take students to
selected areas of the first and second floors and include information about the
lay-out of the physical facility, location of basic services, and circulation
policies. Students who are unable to take one of these tours can pick up a
printed Self-Guided Tour near the second floor reference desk. This will
provide similar information at an individual pace.
Instruction in library use is available to students in several ways. The second
floor reference desk is staffed during most hours. Librarians here will answer
basic informational questions, provide guidance with the Library's catalog, or
help students to find information in library materials. Instruction is also
provided through one-hour lectures that are associated with the library needs
of a particular class, such as Freshmen English, or in Library I, a three-credit
course taught each quarter during the academic year. There are also a
number of short printed handouts or longer guides available to assist students.
Meyer offers a Term Paper Advisory Service, whereby students make an
appointment with a library subject specialist or bibliographer and receive indi
vidual help with their term paper research. The Jonsson Library of
Government Documents provides a similar service to undergraduates needing
information found in documents.
Library Catalogs
One of the first things that undergraduate students must learn is how to use
the library catalogs.
The Green Library contains the main card catalog for all of the Stanford
libraries, providing author, title, and subject access to all SUL libraries except
Meyer, and partial information, usually by author only, for the Coordinate
Libraries. This catalog is arranged in "dictionary" form, with authors, titles,
and subjects interfiled in a single alphabet.
The Meyer Library has never used a card catalog. Historically, the Library
used a "book catalog," a computer-produced listing, bound in a book-like
format. In 1979, Meyer moved to a "COM" (computer-output microform)
catalog in fiche format. Both of these catalogs were "divided," that is, authors
and titles were listed in one alphabet and subjects, both topical and personal,
appeared in another. Initially, books and audio/visual materials were listed in
separate catalogs; but materials in all formats, e.g., books, sound recordings,
motion picture films, can now be found in the same catalog. Undergraduate
course reserves are listed in a separate COM catalog by author, title,.and
course number.
In addition to card and COM catalogs, the Libraries now have an online
catalog, which contains records in machine readable format for all holdings of
the Meyer Library and for materials processed since approximately the mid-

1970's for all other Stanford University Libraries. Most of the Coordinate
Libraries began to use the system in the late 70s, so these files are less
complete than those of other libraries. Although this type of catalog has been
available to library staff through the Research Libraries Information Network
(RLIN) for some time, users have not been able to use the online catalog
directly. However, beginning this Fall, the catalog will be available through the
Center for Information Technology (CIT) as a SPIRES file; and students will be
able to access the online catalog, called SOCRATES, through terminals
located initially in the Meyer Library, Green Library, and the Engineering and
Biology Libraries. Over a period of time, terminals will be made available in all
campus libraries. The online catalog will provide much greater searching
flexibility than the Libraries' printed catalogs and will help users to find needed
materials housed in several libraries via a terminal located in a different library.
For example, a student using the online catalog in Meyer will be able to find a
book in Meyer, another copy of this same book in the Biology Library, and
another book by the same author in the Chemistry Library. Non-book
materials, such as sound recordings and video tapes, will also be accessible
through the online catalog. Since the online catalog will be new this year, all
students, whether new or returning, will be facing a big change. The catalog
will have online aids, supplemented by printed handouts; and the library staff
will also assist users in becoming familiar with this helpful new tool.
Finding & Using Materials
Finding materials in the various campus libraries is usually facilitated by
posters or guides giving the locations of various call numbers. Most Stanford
Libraries currently shelve materials according to the Library of Congress "LC"
classification number, but many libraries also have older materials in the
Dewey classification. Some libraries or collections, such as Government
Documents, use other specialized classification systems because of the nature
of their materials. In the Meyer Library, all books are shelved by LC call
number. Reference materials and periodicals/newspapers are shelved
separately in two wings of the second floor. All of the Library's audio/visual
collections are on the first floor.
As with the catalogs and classification systems, loan periods and circulation
policies vary from library to library. Students should pick up copies of the
policies in the different libraries that they use and become familiar with them.
For example, do books circulate to undergraduates for two weeks or four?
Can two-hour reserve materials be taken out overnight? Are there fees for
items which are returned late or only for materials that have been recalled? In
the Meyer Library, all books, except those on course reserve, circulate for
four weeks and may be renewed if not needed by another borrower. Books on
reserve for courses circulate for two hours or one, two, or three days and may
be taken out overnight beginning two hours before the library closes.
Audio/visual materials, reference books, and periodicals must be used in the
library buildings.
All libraries require students to present their Stanford ID's when charging
out materials. Some libraries, such as Green and the Jackson Library of the
Graduate School of Business, also require identification to enter the facility.
The Meyer Library and several others require students to present library
materials as they leave the building. This ensures that all items have been
properly charged out.
The Stanford libraries are large and complex, but they contain a wealth of
information. Students should use the full range of library resources, both per
sonal and physical, that are available to them as a part of their education. We,
in the Libraries, want your undergraduate library study and research to be a
positive experience, one which opens new doors that will help you to be an
efficient and effective user of information, in whatever format, for the rest of
your life. Many of the libraries have "Action Boxes" so that students can
provide feedback on our collections or services; we invite you to use these or
to give us your comments in person. We welcome them !

Library Services for the Undergraduate
Undergraduates are welcome to use any of Stanford's Libraries. The J. Henry
Meyer Memorial Library, located at the junction of Escondido Road and
Galvez Mall, and known to most students as "UGLI", has collections and
services specifically designed to support the undergraduate curriculum.
Collections
Meyer's book collections are somewhat stronger in the social sciences and
humanities than in the pure and applied sciences or technology; but the
Library is the main housing facility for all collections in non-book formats,
regardless of subject. Research collections in the social sciences and
humanities are housed in the Cecil H. Green Library, which also contains
several centralized departments, such as Government Documents and Special
Collections. The other parts of the Stanford University Libraries (SUL) system
include three research branches in the social sciences and humanities: Art,
Music, and Education; the Archive of Recorded Sound; and six campus
science branches: Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Biology,
Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Physics, and Earth Sciences. One
