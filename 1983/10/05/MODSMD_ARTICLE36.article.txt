# SUBJECT GUIDE
## 
### 
The following list of selective subjects shows
examples of topics on which information may
be found in more than one library on campus.
It is by no means comprehensive in either the
topics for which selection of materials is shared
by more than one library nor are the libraries
listed the only ones where information may be
found on a given topic. But it does serve to
show the extent of the research collections at
Stanford.
On pages 8 and 9 is a list of all the libraries
referred to in the subject guide along with a
brief description of their subject strengths.
The hours the libraries are open and a map
showing their location is found on the back
page.
For further information on the holdings of
particular libraries, please consult the library
directly. For general information on which
libraries have holdings in particular subject
areas contact the General Reference Depart
ment in Green Library (497-1811).
