# Rigorous new requirements strengthen economics major
## 
### TAREK HAMADA 
The undergraduate major in eco
nomics, the most popular among un
dergraduates here, will be
restructured beginning next year,
with the department offering two
major programs instead of one.
One program will emphasize
quantitative study, while the other
will focus o ' qualitative methods of
economic analysis.
Economics lajors who declare
after June *0, 19d4 will have to en
roll in one ot the two programs. Un
til then, those students beginning
economics majors will have the op
tion of enrolling in the current
major program or in one of the new
programs.
The changes were adopted by the
department last March.
The programs were established
on the recommendations ot a tive
member departmental committee
headed by Prof. Victor fuchs that
last winter discussed the current
major program with economics un
dergraduates, graduates and
professors

More than 350 students are
majoring in economics, making it
the most popular department in the
University. Human biology and bio
logical sciences are, respectively,
the second and third most popular.
The program in quantitative eco
nomics will require students to take
Mathematics 43, calculus and ana
lytic geometry; Economics 51Q, mi
croeconomics using the methods of
calculus; Economics 52, macro
economics; Economics 102,
econometrics; two 100-level eco
nomics courses; and a two-quarter
course in applying quantitative
techniques to study economic prob
lems.
Economics 51Q, 52 and 102 will be
the pre-requisites for the two
quarter course in applying quan
titative economic analysis.
The qualitative studv program will
be the same as the current major
program, with two requirements
added: a quarter-long course on
economic policy and a research
paper on economic problems.
Asst. Prof. ]ose Vinals, a member

ot therommittee, said the committee
received many suggestions irom
students.
Ideas came trom many different
places," he said. "We on the com
mittee tried to integrate our experi
ence in teaching with the
perspectives of the students."
Prof. Bert Hickman, director of
undergraduate studies in the de
partment, said the reforms have
been made with student and faculty
support.
"Students have requested the op
portunity to do more work at the
quantitative level," Hickman said.
"In addition, the faculty has felt for
some time that it would be a good
idea to upgrade the quality of the
preparation of students."
The new programs will give eco
nomics majors greater choices,
Hickman said. Students interested
in quantitative economics will be
able to pursue a rigorous course of
study, he said, while the qualitative
economics program will allow stu
dents to study economics in depth
without having to use much math.
Hickman said probably less than
one-half of economics majors will
enroll in the quantitative program.
Asst. Prof. George Evans said the
quantitative program responds to
the requests from many students for

more courses in quantitative eco
nomics.
"Many undergraduates who went
off into business feel that they were
not taxed enough in our program,"
Evans said. "They didn't have the
kinds of skills which people feel
economists should be good at."
Vinals said the programs will
reduce class sizes by dividing eco
nomics majors into two groups.
Smaller class sizes mean closer con
tact between students and faculty,
he said.
