Services to the
Physically Limited
In conjunction with Stanford's efforts to
assist physically limited students, faculty and
staff, the University Libraries staff is commit
ted to providing the opportunity for all members
of the Stanford community to benefit fully from
library resources and services.
Questions and comments are welcome at all
public service desks. Every effort will be made
to explain the possibilities and limits of library
access and services and to make arrange
ments which are mutually satisfactory and
convenient.
The Green and Meyer libraries are accessi
ble to persons with limited mobility. Other
libraries are housed with the department or
school they serve,and since not all are readily
accessible, physically limited patrons should
call ahead to the specific library for advice on
access.
A resource room for visually impaired stu
dents is located on the lower level of the Green
Library and is available for use during regular
library hours for visually impaired students to
utilize accessibility resources including an
Apollo Reader, a variable-speed cassette re
corder/player, a variable speech compressor,
a Perkins Brailler, a braille dictionary and a
variety of braille accessories. The resource
room remains locked to protect the equip
ment. Keys are issued to visually impaired stu
dents upon request by the Office of Disabled

ces starting at 25T for paperbacks,and $1.50 for
