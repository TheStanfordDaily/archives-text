# COLLECTION REVIEW

Green Library Collection Review
Green Library is rapidly filling with books,
journals, microfilms, reports, documents, and
a myriad of other materials. Without efforts to
prune collections so that the most accessible
space remains occupied by the mosf-needed,
most-used materials, the library will have to
double its shelving space in 20 or 25 years at
unbearable cost. In addition, the accumulation
of obsolete or unneeded duplicate titles in
creasingly occupies much-needed, active shelf
space. Without some effort to prune obsolete
or little-used materials from the Green stack,
the shelves may become completely filled
within the decade.
For these reasons, and also because of the
need to identify books requiring conservation

action, bibliographers have begun a long-term,
title-by-title shelf review of all books in the
Green stack, beginning with the Dewey classi
fied books. They are identifying candidates for
(1) off-site storage, (2) potential discard, (3)
preservation treatment, and (4) serial titles to
be cancelled.
Candidate titles are identified by placing one
of three different color-coded slips into the
books. A fourth slip, the conservation slip,
identifies books requiring special care because
of brittle papev, broken binding, or other dam
age, and should not be removed from the
book. All slipped books can be charged out as
usual.
Slipped books will be left in the stack for one
or two years before the action proposed is

taken. If during this period, users believe that
any particular book with a Storage, Discard, or
Serial Review slip in it should be retained in the
Green collection, they can note their reason or
concern on the slip, and turn the slip in at the
Loan Desk. These slips will then be returned to
bibliographers for reconsideration.
Signs describing the Review Project have
been placed throughout the library. If users
want to discuss the review of materials in their
fields, they should contact the appropriate
library bibliographers. (Names and addresses
are available at the Green Library Reference
Desk, 7-1811.) Information about the Review
Project in general is available from Paul Mosher,
Director of Collection Development, Direc
tors' Office, Green Library, 7-2019.
