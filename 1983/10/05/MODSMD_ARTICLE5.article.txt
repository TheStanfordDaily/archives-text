Reagan unveils arms control plan
Washington — While complaining thai the United
States has had to "push, pull, probe and prod" the
Soviets toward arms control, President Reagan
spelled out a new proposal yesterday for the Strate
gic Arms Reduction Talks (START) which features "a
mutual, guaranteed build-down of nuclear weap
ons on both sides at a rate of 5 percent per year or
better.
This approach, to be presented to the Soviets in
Geneva tomorrow, would reduce each superpower
arsenal by roughly 30() to 400 warheads each year,
with an initial goal of bringing strategic arsenals
down to 5000 warheads tor each side within a de
cade, according to an administration official.

Reagan, who announced the new offer at a Rose
Garden cereinonv said an agreement could be
signed at a summit with Soviet President Yuri
Andropov. There seemed little prospect for such a
meeting in the immediate future, however.
A White House "fact sheet" said the U.S. START
delegation was also given authority to:
—Extend the build-down principle to bombers and
discuss limits on the size and capability of bomber
launched cruise missiles — two weapons that stir par
ticular concern in Moscow because of U.S.
advantages in these fields — if the Soviets show
reciprocal flexibility on items of concern to the
United States, such as Moscow's very large missiles.
—"Negotiate trade-offs, taking into account Soviet
advantages in missiles and U.S. advantages in bom
bers," to provide maximum flexibility for both sides
in designing their nuclear arsenals. Presumably,
some formula for comparing the "value' of differ
ent weapons — land-based missiles, sub-based
missiles, and bombers — will be sought in negotia
tions.
—Set up a working group within the STAR! talks to
deal with details of the build-down initiative and
speed its consideration.
An administration official who briefed reporters
on the new U.S. proposal said it was premature to
expect any Soviet-American interim agreement on
the build-down concept to emerge spearate from a
START treaty when Soviet reaction to the idea is not
known. The administration is aware, however, that
the concept could be advanced by such an interim
declaration of principles on how to achieve the
build-down, an agreement which could be signed at
a Soviet-U.S. summit meeting, sources said.
Asked "what would it take to get a summit,"
Reagan told reporters: "An agreement,' apparently
on arms control.
Moscow has said a summit should promise
"concrete results." But last week's harsh statement
by Andropov seemed to rule out doing business
with the Reagan administration in view of the presi
dent's bitter denunciations of the Kremlin over the
Korean airliner incident.
New obstacles to Lebanese peace
Beirut, Lebanon — New obstacles emerged yesterday
in U.S.-supported efforts to arrange for a Lebanese
national reconciliation conference with Syria re
ported to be opposed to its convening in Saudi
Arabia.
The delay in the opening of the conference of
Lebanon's leading political figures has caused
growing concern here because of the continuing
fragile nature of the Sept. 28 cease-fire that halted a
month of fighting.
There were some exchanges of fire between
guerillas and army positions yesterday in the south
ern predominantly Shiite suburbs of Beirut, but
otherwise the country was relatively calm after
Monday's sudden flare-up of fighting in and around
Beirut's Shiite districts.
The national news agency said that, contrary to
press speculation, no agreement had yet been
reached concerning the date or location of the con
ference. Press reports had said it would be held in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and start possibly tomorrow.
Lebanese government sources said that Syria was
now blocking the way for the opening of the nation
al reconciliation meeting by proposing that it be

held in Tunis rather than leddah.
In addition, one of the opposition leaders,
former President Suleiman Franjieh, said at a press
conference in his northern home town of Zaghorta
that he was against the meeting being held before
the May 17 Lebanese-Israeli withdrawal agreement
was canceled.
"Until this agreement is canceled, any dialogue,
any talk of meeting is out of the question in my per
sonal opinion," Franjieh was quoted as saying.
Because of Franjieh's close ties to Syria, there was
speculation here that the Syrians might be using him
to raise more problems for the conference as well
as to send a message to the Lebanese government
that they want the issue of the Lebanese-Israeli ac
cord high on the conference's agenda.
The main purpose of the reconciliation meeting is
to draw up a new power-sharing formula between
Lebanon s Moslem and Christian communities.
Franjieh s statement was all the more curious
since he had repeatedly said in the past week that he
was ready to attend the conference without posing
any conditions.
His statement yesterday was one more example of
the kind of problems cropping up now as arrange
ments for the political talks drag on and all parties
harden their bargaining positions.
Reagan cancellation causes worry
Manila, Philippines — Opposition leaders said yes
terday the cancellation of President Reagan's Manila
visit could signal the beginning of the withdrawal of
American support for President Ferdinand Marcos
and a tougher crackdown by Marcos on his oppo
nents.
"Now that he is not coming, I think it's open
season," said former Foreign Minister Salvador
Lopez. "President Marcos is no longer on good be
havior."
Some opposition leaders said privately that the
cancellation could prove a boon to the embattled
Philippine leader. They explained that Reagan's
presence would have provided a target for major
anti-Marcos demonstrations that would have
dominated foreign TV screens and made headlines
in all the foreign papers.
Marcos said he didn't think Reagan's action indi
cated flagging U.S. confidence in him, but
diplomatic observers took it as a blow to his pres
tige at a time of increasing domestic opposition to
his authoritarian regime.
Manila's afternoon newspapers carried the White
House announcement under front-page banner
headlines. A major television network flashed the
news on its screen, and coffee shops buzzed with
speculation about the impact on Marcos' 18-year
grip on the country.

It could be the beginning of the withdrawal of
(U.S.) support tor the Marcos regime," said former
Sen. Salvador Laurel, president of the United
Nationalist Democratic Organization, the biggest
anti-Marcos political group.
He said the cancellation "somewhat defused"
anti-American sentiment among Filipinos who would
have viewed Reagan's visit as condonation of the as
sassination Aug. 21 of Marcos' chief rival, former
Sen. Benigno Aquino.
But Laurel said Reagan would have gained more
points' among Filipinos if he had said he was not
coming to show disapproval of the Marcos govern
ment. Instead the president attributed his decision
to the press ot unfinished legislation in Congress.
Nicaraguan aggression cited
Washington — Costa Rica's foreign minister yester
day charged that a recent Sandinista attack on a
Costa Rican border post and two towns was part of
a "premeditated plan" of aggression by Nicaragua.
Foreign Minister Fernando Volio )imenez told a
special session of the Organization of American
States that on Sept. 28, soldiers of the Sandinista
army fighting anti-Sandinista guerrillas "from and in
Nicaraguan territory" attacked the two towns and
the border post on Penas Blancas. The Nicaraguan
government contends that the anti-Sandinista forces
are based in Costa Rica.
The Nicaraguan representative, Edgar Parrales,
responded with impassioned claims that the Costa
Rican allegations "had no logic" and that Sandinista
soldiers were attacked from Costa Rican territory.
Volio Jimenez, citing a threat last week by
Nicaragua's defense minister to send his troops up
to a third of a mile into foreign territory in pursuit
of the guerrillas, said Costa Rica is facing "its
gravest threat in many decades."
The U.S. ambassador to the inter-American body,
). William Middendorf, expressed "strong support"
for the Costa Rican statement and said the United
States would deal with Nicaraguan aggression un
der the provisions of the Rio Treaty of 1947. The
mutual defense agreement calls for nations in the
western hemisphere to aid one another when at
tacked or threatened.
Parrales charged that Costa Rica — although it is of
ficially neutral and some of its leaders are
uncomfortable with the guerrillas' presence — is in
part to blame for the actions of the anti-Sandinista
forces of the Costa Rica-based Nicaraguan Demo
cratic Alliance (ARDE), led by former Sandinista
hero Eden Pastora. Parrales said planes that
recently bombed Nicaraguan targets, including the
Managua airport, had taken off from Costa Rican
bases. Pastora's group publicly claimed responsibil
ity for the bombings.

Oakland teachers strike
Oakland — Oakland teachers struck the state's
fourth-largest school district yesterday for the
second time in seven years, and thousands of stu
dents stayed home as all but elementary schools shut
their doors.
Officials of the striking Oakland Education Associ
ation estimated that 88 percent of the 3500 teachers,
counselors, nurses, librarians, substitutes and
psychologists were honoring picket lines.
Administration officials said about 83 percent of
the regular staff stayed home and less than half of
the district's 49,000 students reported to class.
Even as strikers gathered at the district's 91
schools, negotiations were continuing with a state
mediator.
Roger Cooden, president of the OEA, said "some
progress" had been made, but he vowed the strike
would continue if the Oakland Unified School Dis
trict did not improve its latest contract offer.
Gooden declined to provide details of the latest
offer, but he said the union had reduced its salary
request from 10 percent this year to 8.5 percent.
As of Monday night, the district had offered a 10
percent wage increase over a two-year period, with
new teachers and veteran teachers with extra col
lege units getting the biggest boosts.
District officials had assured parents that classes
would continue with substitute teachers. But
Marian Magid, district spokeswoman, said new,
tougher state requirements for substitutes had
reduced by about half the list of those eligible to
take over classes.
All middle, junior and senior high schools were
shut down by noon, and a number of elementary
schools also were forced to close when only a hand
ful of regular teachers and substitutes showed up.
Stock market rebounds
New York — The stock market rebounded from a
week-long decline with a moderate rally yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 29.47
points in the last five trading days, rose 5.39 to
1236.68 by the end of trading yesterday.
Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2
among New York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
Today's weather
Sunny with highs in the upper 60s to mid-80s.

Reagan unveils arms control plan
Washington — While complaining thai the United
States has had to "push, pull, probe and prod" the
Soviets toward arms control, President Reagan
spelled out a new proposal yesterday for the Strate
gic Arms Reduction Talks (START) which features "a
mutual, guaranteed build-down of nuclear weap
ons on both sides at a rate of 5 percent per year or
better.
This approach, to be presented to the Soviets in
Geneva tomorrow, would reduce each superpower
arsenal by roughly 30() to 400 warheads each year,
with an initial goal of bringing strategic arsenals
down to 5000 warheads tor each side within a de
cade, according to an administration official.

Reagan, who announced the new offer at a Rose
Garden cereinonv said an agreement could be
signed at a summit with Soviet President Yuri
Andropov. There seemed little prospect for such a
meeting in the immediate future, however.
A White House "fact sheet" said the U.S. START
delegation was also given authority to:
—Extend the build-down principle to bombers and
discuss limits on the size and capability of bomber
launched cruise missiles — two weapons that stir par
ticular concern in Moscow because of U.S.
advantages in these fields — if the Soviets show
reciprocal flexibility on items of concern to the
United States, such as Moscow's very large missiles.
—"Negotiate trade-offs, taking into account Soviet
advantages in missiles and U.S. advantages in bom
bers," to provide maximum flexibility for both sides
in designing their nuclear arsenals. Presumably,
some formula for comparing the "value' of differ
ent weapons — land-based missiles, sub-based
missiles, and bombers — will be sought in negotia
tions.
—Set up a working group within the STAR! talks to
deal with details of the build-down initiative and
speed its consideration.
An administration official who briefed reporters
on the new U.S. proposal said it was premature to
expect any Soviet-American interim agreement on
the build-down concept to emerge spearate from a
START treaty when Soviet reaction to the idea is not
known. The administration is aware, however, that
the concept could be advanced by such an interim
declaration of principles on how to achieve the
build-down, an agreement which could be signed at
a Soviet-U.S. summit meeting, sources said.
Asked "what would it take to get a summit,"
Reagan told reporters: "An agreement,' apparently
on arms control.
Moscow has said a summit should promise
"concrete results." But last week's harsh statement
by Andropov seemed to rule out doing business
with the Reagan administration in view of the presi
dent's bitter denunciations of the Kremlin over the
Korean airliner incident.
New obstacles to Lebanese peace
Beirut, Lebanon — New obstacles emerged yesterday
in U.S.-supported efforts to arrange for a Lebanese
national reconciliation conference with Syria re
ported to be opposed to its convening in Saudi
Arabia.
The delay in the opening of the conference of
Lebanon's leading political figures has caused
growing concern here because of the continuing
fragile nature of the Sept. 28 cease-fire that halted a
month of fighting.
There were some exchanges of fire between
guerillas and army positions yesterday in the south
ern predominantly Shiite suburbs of Beirut, but
otherwise the country was relatively calm after
Monday's sudden flare-up of fighting in and around
Beirut's Shiite districts.
The national news agency said that, contrary to
press speculation, no agreement had yet been
reached concerning the date or location of the con
ference. Press reports had said it would be held in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and start possibly tomorrow.
Lebanese government sources said that Syria was
now blocking the way for the opening of the nation
al reconciliation meeting by proposing that it be

held in Tunis rather than leddah.
In addition, one of the opposition leaders,
former President Suleiman Franjieh, said at a press
conference in his northern home town of Zaghorta
that he was against the meeting being held before
the May 17 Lebanese-Israeli withdrawal agreement
was canceled.
"Until this agreement is canceled, any dialogue,
any talk of meeting is out of the question in my per
sonal opinion," Franjieh was quoted as saying.
Because of Franjieh's close ties to Syria, there was
speculation here that the Syrians might be using him
to raise more problems for the conference as well
as to send a message to the Lebanese government
that they want the issue of the Lebanese-Israeli ac
cord high on the conference's agenda.
The main purpose of the reconciliation meeting is
to draw up a new power-sharing formula between
Lebanon s Moslem and Christian communities.
Franjieh s statement was all the more curious
since he had repeatedly said in the past week that he
was ready to attend the conference without posing
any conditions.
His statement yesterday was one more example of
the kind of problems cropping up now as arrange
ments for the political talks drag on and all parties
harden their bargaining positions.
Reagan cancellation causes worry
Manila, Philippines — Opposition leaders said yes
terday the cancellation of President Reagan's Manila
visit could signal the beginning of the withdrawal of
American support for President Ferdinand Marcos
and a tougher crackdown by Marcos on his oppo
nents.
"Now that he is not coming, I think it's open
season," said former Foreign Minister Salvador
Lopez. "President Marcos is no longer on good be
havior."
Some opposition leaders said privately that the
cancellation could prove a boon to the embattled
Philippine leader. They explained that Reagan's
presence would have provided a target for major
anti-Marcos demonstrations that would have
dominated foreign TV screens and made headlines
in all the foreign papers.
Marcos said he didn't think Reagan's action indi
cated flagging U.S. confidence in him, but
diplomatic observers took it as a blow to his pres
tige at a time of increasing domestic opposition to
his authoritarian regime.
Manila's afternoon newspapers carried the White
House announcement under front-page banner
headlines. A major television network flashed the
news on its screen, and coffee shops buzzed with
speculation about the impact on Marcos' 18-year
grip on the country.

It could be the beginning of the withdrawal of
(U.S.) support tor the Marcos regime," said former
Sen. Salvador Laurel, president of the United
Nationalist Democratic Organization, the biggest
anti-Marcos political group.
He said the cancellation "somewhat defused"
anti-American sentiment among Filipinos who would
have viewed Reagan's visit as condonation of the as
sassination Aug. 21 of Marcos' chief rival, former
Sen. Benigno Aquino.
But Laurel said Reagan would have gained more
points' among Filipinos if he had said he was not
coming to show disapproval of the Marcos govern
ment. Instead the president attributed his decision
to the press ot unfinished legislation in Congress.
Nicaraguan aggression cited
Washington — Costa Rica's foreign minister yester
day charged that a recent Sandinista attack on a
Costa Rican border post and two towns was part of
a "premeditated plan" of aggression by Nicaragua.
Foreign Minister Fernando Volio )imenez told a
special session of the Organization of American
States that on Sept. 28, soldiers of the Sandinista
army fighting anti-Sandinista guerrillas "from and in
Nicaraguan territory" attacked the two towns and
the border post on Penas Blancas. The Nicaraguan
government contends that the anti-Sandinista forces
are based in Costa Rica.
The Nicaraguan representative, Edgar Parrales,
responded with impassioned claims that the Costa
Rican allegations "had no logic" and that Sandinista
soldiers were attacked from Costa Rican territory.
Volio Jimenez, citing a threat last week by
Nicaragua's defense minister to send his troops up
to a third of a mile into foreign territory in pursuit
of the guerrillas, said Costa Rica is facing "its
gravest threat in many decades."
The U.S. ambassador to the inter-American body,
). William Middendorf, expressed "strong support"
for the Costa Rican statement and said the United
States would deal with Nicaraguan aggression un
der the provisions of the Rio Treaty of 1947. The
mutual defense agreement calls for nations in the
western hemisphere to aid one another when at
tacked or threatened.
Parrales charged that Costa Rica — although it is of
ficially neutral and some of its leaders are
uncomfortable with the guerrillas' presence — is in
part to blame for the actions of the anti-Sandinista
forces of the Costa Rica-based Nicaraguan Demo
cratic Alliance (ARDE), led by former Sandinista
hero Eden Pastora. Parrales said planes that
recently bombed Nicaraguan targets, including the
Managua airport, had taken off from Costa Rican
bases. Pastora's group publicly claimed responsibil
ity for the bombings.

Oakland teachers strike
Oakland — Oakland teachers struck the state's
fourth-largest school district yesterday for the
second time in seven years, and thousands of stu
dents stayed home as all but elementary schools shut
their doors.
Officials of the striking Oakland Education Associ
ation estimated that 88 percent of the 3500 teachers,
counselors, nurses, librarians, substitutes and
psychologists were honoring picket lines.
Administration officials said about 83 percent of
the regular staff stayed home and less than half of
the district's 49,000 students reported to class.
Even as strikers gathered at the district's 91
schools, negotiations were continuing with a state
mediator.
Roger Cooden, president of the OEA, said "some
progress" had been made, but he vowed the strike
would continue if the Oakland Unified School Dis
trict did not improve its latest contract offer.
Gooden declined to provide details of the latest
offer, but he said the union had reduced its salary
request from 10 percent this year to 8.5 percent.
As of Monday night, the district had offered a 10
percent wage increase over a two-year period, with
new teachers and veteran teachers with extra col
lege units getting the biggest boosts.
District officials had assured parents that classes
would continue with substitute teachers. But
Marian Magid, district spokeswoman, said new,
tougher state requirements for substitutes had
reduced by about half the list of those eligible to
take over classes.
All middle, junior and senior high schools were
shut down by noon, and a number of elementary
schools also were forced to close when only a hand

Even as strikers gathered at the district's 91

Roger Cooden, president of the OEA, said "some

Gooden declined to provide details of the latest
offer, but he said the union had reduced its salary
request from 10 percent this year to 8.5 percent.
As of Monday night, the district had offered a 10

new teachers and veteran teachers with extra col

District officials had assured parents that classes
would continue with substitute teachers. But
Marian Magid, district spokeswoman, said new,
tougher state requirements for substitutes had
reduced by about half the list of those eligible to
take over classes.
All middle, junior and senior high schools were
shut down by noon, and a number of elementary
schools also were forced to close when only a hand

Reagan unveils arms control plan
Washington — While complaining thai the United
States has had to "push, pull, probe and prod" the
Soviets toward arms control, President Reagan
spelled out a new proposal yesterday for the Strate
gic Arms Reduction Talks (START) which features "a
mutual, guaranteed build-down of nuclear weap
ons on both sides at a rate of 5 percent per year or
better.
This approach, to be presented to the Soviets in
Geneva tomorrow, would reduce each superpower
arsenal by roughly 30() to 400 warheads each year,
with an initial goal of bringing strategic arsenals
down to 5000 warheads tor each side within a de
cade, according to an administration official.

Reagan, who announced the new offer at a Rose
Garden cereinonv said an agreement could be
signed at a summit with Soviet President Yuri
Andropov. There seemed little prospect for such a
meeting in the immediate future, however.
A White House "fact sheet" said the U.S. START
delegation was also given authority to:
—Extend the build-down principle to bombers and
discuss limits on the size and capability of bomber
launched cruise missiles — two weapons that stir par
ticular concern in Moscow because of U.S.
advantages in these fields — if the Soviets show
reciprocal flexibility on items of concern to the
United States, such as Moscow's very large missiles.
—"Negotiate trade-offs, taking into account Soviet
advantages in missiles and U.S. advantages in bom
bers," to provide maximum flexibility for both sides
in designing their nuclear arsenals. Presumably,
some formula for comparing the "value' of differ
ent weapons — land-based missiles, sub-based
missiles, and bombers — will be sought in negotia
tions.
—Set up a working group within the STAR! talks to
deal with details of the build-down initiative and
speed its consideration.
An administration official who briefed reporters
on the new U.S. proposal said it was premature to
expect any Soviet-American interim agreement on
the build-down concept to emerge spearate from a
START treaty when Soviet reaction to the idea is not
known. The administration is aware, however, that
the concept could be advanced by such an interim
declaration of principles on how to achieve the
build-down, an agreement which could be signed at
a Soviet-U.S. summit meeting, sources said.
Asked "what would it take to get a summit,"
Reagan told reporters: "An agreement,' apparently
on arms control.
Moscow has said a summit should promise
"concrete results." But last week's harsh statement
by Andropov seemed to rule out doing business
with the Reagan administration in view of the presi
dent's bitter denunciations of the Kremlin over the
Korean airliner incident.
New obstacles to Lebanese peace
Beirut, Lebanon — New obstacles emerged yesterday
in U.S.-supported efforts to arrange for a Lebanese
national reconciliation conference with Syria re
ported to be opposed to its convening in Saudi
Arabia.
The delay in the opening of the conference of
Lebanon's leading political figures has caused
growing concern here because of the continuing
fragile nature of the Sept. 28 cease-fire that halted a
month of fighting.
There were some exchanges of fire between
guerillas and army positions yesterday in the south
ern predominantly Shiite suburbs of Beirut, but
otherwise the country was relatively calm after
Monday's sudden flare-up of fighting in and around
Beirut's Shiite districts.
The national news agency said that, contrary to
press speculation, no agreement had yet been
reached concerning the date or location of the con
ference. Press reports had said it would be held in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and start possibly tomorrow.
Lebanese government sources said that Syria was
now blocking the way for the opening of the nation
al reconciliation meeting by proposing that it be

held in Tunis rather than leddah.
In addition, one of the opposition leaders,
former President Suleiman Franjieh, said at a press
conference in his northern home town of Zaghorta
that he was against the meeting being held before
the May 17 Lebanese-Israeli withdrawal agreement
was canceled.
"Until this agreement is canceled, any dialogue,
any talk of meeting is out of the question in my per
sonal opinion," Franjieh was quoted as saying.
Because of Franjieh's close ties to Syria, there was
speculation here that the Syrians might be using him
to raise more problems for the conference as well
as to send a message to the Lebanese government
that they want the issue of the Lebanese-Israeli ac
cord high on the conference's agenda.
The main purpose of the reconciliation meeting is
to draw up a new power-sharing formula between
Lebanon s Moslem and Christian communities.
Franjieh s statement was all the more curious
since he had repeatedly said in the past week that he
was ready to attend the conference without posing
any conditions.
His statement yesterday was one more example of
the kind of problems cropping up now as arrange
ments for the political talks drag on and all parties
harden their bargaining positions.
Reagan cancellation causes worry
Manila, Philippines — Opposition leaders said yes
terday the cancellation of President Reagan's Manila
visit could signal the beginning of the withdrawal of
American support for President Ferdinand Marcos
and a tougher crackdown by Marcos on his oppo
nents.
"Now that he is not coming, I think it's open
season," said former Foreign Minister Salvador
Lopez. "President Marcos is no longer on good be
havior."
Some opposition leaders said privately that the
cancellation could prove a boon to the embattled
Philippine leader. They explained that Reagan's
presence would have provided a target for major
anti-Marcos demonstrations that would have
dominated foreign TV screens and made headlines
in all the foreign papers.
Marcos said he didn't think Reagan's action indi
cated flagging U.S. confidence in him, but
diplomatic observers took it as a blow to his pres
tige at a time of increasing domestic opposition to
his authoritarian regime.
Manila's afternoon newspapers carried the White
House announcement under front-page banner
headlines. A major television network flashed the
news on its screen, and coffee shops buzzed with
speculation about the impact on Marcos' 18-year
grip on the country.

It could be the beginning of the withdrawal of
(U.S.) support tor the Marcos regime," said former
Sen. Salvador Laurel, president of the United
Nationalist Democratic Organization, the biggest
anti-Marcos political group.
He said the cancellation "somewhat defused"
anti-American sentiment among Filipinos who would
have viewed Reagan's visit as condonation of the as
sassination Aug. 21 of Marcos' chief rival, former
Sen. Benigno Aquino.
But Laurel said Reagan would have gained more
points' among Filipinos if he had said he was not
coming to show disapproval of the Marcos govern
ment. Instead the president attributed his decision
to the press ot unfinished legislation in Congress.
Nicaraguan aggression cited
Washington — Costa Rica's foreign minister yester
day charged that a recent Sandinista attack on a
Costa Rican border post and two towns was part of
a "premeditated plan" of aggression by Nicaragua.
Foreign Minister Fernando Volio )imenez told a
special session of the Organization of American
States that on Sept. 28, soldiers of the Sandinista
army fighting anti-Sandinista guerrillas "from and in
Nicaraguan territory" attacked the two towns and
the border post on Penas Blancas. The Nicaraguan
government contends that the anti-Sandinista forces
are based in Costa Rica.
The Nicaraguan representative, Edgar Parrales,
responded with impassioned claims that the Costa
Rican allegations "had no logic" and that Sandinista
soldiers were attacked from Costa Rican territory.
Volio Jimenez, citing a threat last week by
Nicaragua's defense minister to send his troops up
to a third of a mile into foreign territory in pursuit
of the guerrillas, said Costa Rica is facing "its
gravest threat in many decades."
The U.S. ambassador to the inter-American body,
). William Middendorf, expressed "strong support"
for the Costa Rican statement and said the United
States would deal with Nicaraguan aggression un
der the provisions of the Rio Treaty of 1947. The
mutual defense agreement calls for nations in the
western hemisphere to aid one another when at
tacked or threatened.
Parrales charged that Costa Rica — although it is of
ficially neutral and some of its leaders are
uncomfortable with the guerrillas' presence — is in
part to blame for the actions of the anti-Sandinista
forces of the Costa Rica-based Nicaraguan Demo
cratic Alliance (ARDE), led by former Sandinista
hero Eden Pastora. Parrales said planes that
recently bombed Nicaraguan targets, including the
Managua airport, had taken off from Costa Rican
bases. Pastora's group publicly claimed responsibil
ity for the bombings.

Oakland teachers strike
Oakland — Oakland teachers struck the state's
fourth-largest school district yesterday for the
second time in seven years, and thousands of stu
dents stayed home as all but elementary schools shut
their doors.
Officials of the striking Oakland Education Associ
ation estimated that 88 percent of the 3500 teachers,
counselors, nurses, librarians, substitutes and
psychologists were honoring picket lines.
Administration officials said about 83 percent of
the regular staff stayed home and less than half of
the district's 49,000 students reported to class.
