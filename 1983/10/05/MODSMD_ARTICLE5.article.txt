Reagan unveils arms control plan
Washington — While complaining thai the United
States has had to "push, pull, probe and prod" the
Soviets toward arms control, President Reagan
spelled out a new proposal yesterday for the Strate
gic Arms Reduction Talks (START) which features "a
mutual, guaranteed build-down of nuclear weap
ons on both sides at a rate of 5 percent per year or
better.
This approach, to be presented to the Soviets in
Geneva tomorrow, would reduce each superpower
arsenal by roughly 30() to 400 warheads each year,
with an initial goal of bringing strategic arsenals
down to 5000 warheads tor each side within a de
cade, according to an administration official.

Reagan, who announced the new offer at a Rose
Garden cereinonv said an agreement could be
signed at a summit with Soviet President Yuri
Andropov. There seemed little prospect for such a
meeting in the immediate future, however.
A White House "fact sheet" said the U.S. START
delegation was also given authority to:
—Extend the build-down principle to bombers and
discuss limits on the size and capability of bomber
launched cruise missiles — two weapons that stir par
ticular concern in Moscow because of U.S.
advantages in these fields — if the Soviets show
reciprocal flexibility on items of concern to the
United States, such as Moscow's very large missiles.
—"Negotiate trade-offs, taking into account Soviet
advantages in missiles and U.S. advantages in bom
bers," to provide maximum flexibility for both sides
