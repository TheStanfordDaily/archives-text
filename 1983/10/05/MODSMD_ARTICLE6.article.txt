East Palo Alto is a cits at least
for the moment.
Although it has been incor
porated since the lune 7 elec
tion, its enemies are slill hoping
to declare the election a fraud,
and its skeptics are predicting a
rocky road for a city with big
problems and little money.
The election that incoporated
East Palo Alto last lune also gave
birth to a lawsuit that, though
overruled, is still pending.
Several local realtors, notably
Arn Ct-nadella, and an anti
incorporationist member of the
EPA city council, Gertrude VVilks,
charge that the election was in
valid because of voter fraud.
According to former Rep. Paul
''Pete'' McCloskey, who

represents the anti
mcorporationists, the circum
stances surrounding the collec
tion of absentee ballots were
more than a little unusual. Many
absentee ballots were filled out
by pro-incorporationists lohn
Goodwill and lames Blakey,
though with the consent of the
voter; and many of the ballots
were hand-delivered both to and
from the home of the voter by
Blakey and Goodwill.
"What happened here is that
these people went around and
registered a lot of voters just
before the election, which is per
fectly legal," McCloskey said. "It
isn't very hard to do â€” you take a
pad with about SO spaces and
everyone writes down their
name and address."
After registering voters, Mc-

Closkey explained, the pro
incorporationists noted the
names of those who applied for
absentee ballots, waited eight
clays, and then reappeared at the
homes of those voters to
"collect" ballots. In several cases
the ballots were both picked up
and delivered to the homes of
voters; court evidence includes
seventeen cases where Goodwill
put his own address instead of
the voter's address on the paper.
"Now, it is perfectly legal for
someone to show an absentee
ballot to a friend or relative, and
even have then fill it out accor
ding to the voter's wishes," Mc -
Closkey said. "But when a com
plete stranger comes into your
home and says 'here's a ballot,'
