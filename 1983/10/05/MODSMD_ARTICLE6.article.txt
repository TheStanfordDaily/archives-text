# Opponents challenge EPA cityhood

### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
East Palo Alto is a cits at least
for the moment.
Although it has been incor
porated since the lune 7 elec
tion, its enemies are slill hoping
to declare the election a fraud,
and its skeptics are predicting a
rocky road for a city with big
problems and little money.
The election that incoporated
East Palo Alto last lune also gave
birth to a lawsuit that, though
overruled, is still pending.
Several local realtors, notably
Arn Ct-nadella, and an anti
incorporationist member of the
EPA city council, Gertrude VVilks,
charge that the election was in
valid because of voter fraud.
According to former Rep. Paul
''Pete'' McCloskey, who

represents the anti
mcorporationists, the circum
stances surrounding the collec
tion of absentee ballots were
more than a little unusual. Many
absentee ballots were filled out
by pro-incorporationists lohn
Goodwill and lames Blakey,
though with the consent of the
voter; and many of the ballots
were hand-delivered both to and
from the home of the voter by
Blakey and Goodwill.
"What happened here is that
these people went around and
registered a lot of voters just
before the election, which is per
fectly legal," McCloskey said. "It
isn't very hard to do â€” you take a
pad with about SO spaces and
everyone writes down their
name and address."
After registering voters, Mc-

Closkey explained, the pro
incorporationists noted the
names of those who applied for
absentee ballots, waited eight
clays, and then reappeared at the
homes of those voters to
"collect" ballots. In several cases
the ballots were both picked up
and delivered to the homes of
voters; court evidence includes
seventeen cases where Goodwill
put his own address instead of
the voter's address on the paper.
"Now, it is perfectly legal for
someone to show an absentee
ballot to a friend or relative, and
even have then fill it out accor
ding to the voter's wishes," Mc -
Closkey said. "But when a com
plete stranger comes into your
home and says 'here's a ballot,'
and they obviously want you
to vote a different way, that's a
different story. That seems a
bit like coercion."
Despite the objections, the
court found no evidence of
fraud or coercion in the June
election and awarded East
Palo Alto official incorpora
tion status on Sept. 23. A five
member city council was offi
cially apointed: Omowale Sat

terwhite, Ruben Abrica, James
Blakey, and the anti
incorporationist Gertrude
Wilks.
Barbara Mouton, who had
been acting as mayor during
the election battle, was given
the position and offices were
set up in East Palo Alto.
The young government of
the city is optimistic about East
Palo Alto's future. "Of course
we're going to make it,"
Abrica said, "We've survived
a major lawsuit and we're on
our way now." According to
Abrica, the city has already

begun accomplishing things
they had promised: a rent
freeze ordinance has been
enacted, a rent task force has
been formed and plans are
being made to open the
former Ravenswood High
School for community use.
"Not only am I convinced
that the city is going to
survive," Abrica said, "I think
it is going to prosper."
According to Mouton,
there are no immediate
threats to the future of the
city. "We just survived a major
lawsuit," Mouton said, and

now we're going to go about
our business."
Commenting on the lawsuit,
Mouton said, "It there was
any fraud, it was on the part of
the anti-incorporationists.
Council member Sat
terwhite does not find EPA's
financial situation quite so
precarious. He explained that
the financial prognosis of East
Palo Alto had been studied
carefully by several research
firms, including SKI Interna
tional, and these firms had
found the prospect of incor
poration financially sound.
Concerning the trial, Sat
terwhite said, "If you asked
someone to fill out a ballot for
you and they filled it out, with
your consent, would you con
sider that a violation of your
rights?"
The present situation in East
Palo Alto seems to be one of
clear objectives, clouded et
hics and determination on
both sides.
