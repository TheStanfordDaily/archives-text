# Red tape stalls Financial Aids Office

Bv VALERIE ( RITES
A new law linking draft registration to receipt of
federal aid and an unusually high number of requests
for revaluation has caused a huge slowdown in the
processing of financial aid offers here, according to
financial aid officers.
"Draft registration is one problem in a sea of many,
but it is a major problem," according to Vincent
DeAnda, associate director of financial aid-
DeAnda said awards would have been ready on time
except for delays caused by the draft issue, which
arose this summer after the Supreme Court allowed
regulations to go into effect requiring male students 18
and older to be registered for the draft in order to
receive federal financial aid.
"The draft issue delayed us and, a> a result, students
did not receive as early an opportunitv to review their
awards and request revisions," he said.
The regulations were originally put into law last fall
in the so-called Solomon Amendment, which was intro
duced by Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-New York). Under
the regulations, clarified last spring, students must
sign a form stating that they have registered for the
draft or are not required to register '.before receiving
Pell Grants, Guaranteed Student loans, or other forms
of financial aid from universities

Stanford's financial Aids Office had mailed about
half of its aid offers to students this summer when Stan
ford Against Conscription (SAC) requested a halt to
the proceedings, and a two-week delay ensued before
the mailings were resumed.
According to Roberta Johnson, assistant director for
advising and awarding, the SAC request was based on
the University's decision to send out registration forms
without stating that Stanford's policy is to meet the
financial needs of students regardless of whether they
have complied with the registration law or are eligible
for federal funds.
"We had finalized our aid offers in late lune for all
those students who had applied for aid by the April 15
deadline," lohnson said.
"We were ready to mail these computer notices by
mid-July, but were requested bv Stanford Against Con
scription to delay the remaining portion of that
mailing. The impact of those procedures has changed
our timing. Our staff is limited and has little flexibility
as far as the calendar is concerned, she said.
The University continued the mailing without includ
ing any additional statement, Johnson said, but has ful
filled the needs of all students tor assistance.
"There are about 20 stu
dents who have made them
selves known as conscientious
objectors to draft registra
tion. For these students the
University has replaced the
federal funds, usually
Guaranteed Student Loans,
with University loans of an
equivalent amount," she said.
One such conscientious ob
jector, sophomore Andrew
Shields, said the Financial Aids
Office has been "absolutely
phenomenal" in its assistance
efforts.
Shields, like some other
conscientious objectors, is
hoping for a Supreme Court
reversal of the Solomon
Amendment, which would
mean that aid could be
received regardless of
registration status.
Complicating the picture is
the fact that more revisions of
aid packages have been re

quested this year than in the
past—"near 1000" requests, ac
cording to Johnson.
According to DeAnda, "The
added revisions have led to
later processing of the forms.
This delay has prompted more
questions from the students;
these questions add to the
processing delay because
while we are dealing with
them it takes time away from
the actual processing. The
questions and processing
delay feed upon one another
and we become trapped in the
cycle."
Most of the revision re
quests stem from lower-than
projected earnings by stu
dents and their parents.
"The main problem has not
been with the financial aid for
mulas (hanging, they haven't,
but rather with families fin
ding it increasingly difficult to
apportion funds for school
ing," Johnson said.
DeAnda echoed those com
ments, saying, "The economic
situation has been a problem,
and has required more revi

sions because students have
had to change their original
financial aid statements. In
many cases job loss and an in
ability to finance the original
amount have been given as
reasons by those requesting
revisions."
According to lohnson, the
students who have not yet
received their financial aid of
fers include those who filed
late or incomplete applica
tions, those who were un
available to be contacted for
follow-up information and
those who have filed appeals
for revision in their aid
packages.
Students still awaiting their
final aid offers were advised at
registration to defer the
amount they expected to
receive and told if that is the
amount that is offered, the
deferment charges will be
cancelled.
If the award is not enough,
however, the student will still
be charged a deferment fee,
according to Sue Ward, an as
sistant director.

ing," Johnson said.
DeAnda echoed those com

ability to finance the original

According to lohnson, the
students who have not yet
received their financial aid of
fers include those who filed
late or incomplete applica
tions, those who were un
available to be contacted for
follow-up information and
those who have filed appeals
for revision in their aid
packages.
Students still awaiting their
final aid offers were advised at
registration to defer the
amount they expected to
receive and told if that is the
amount that is offered, the
deferment charges will be
cancelled.
If the award is not enough,
however, the student will still
be charged a deferment fee,
according to Sue Ward, an as

Bv VALERIE ( RITES
A new law linking draft registration to receipt of
federal aid and an unusually high number of requests
for revaluation has caused a huge slowdown in the
processing of financial aid offers here, according to
financial aid officers.
"Draft registration is one problem in a sea of many,
but it is a major problem," according to Vincent
DeAnda, associate director of financial aid-
DeAnda said awards would have been ready on time
except for delays caused by the draft issue, which
arose this summer after the Supreme Court allowed
regulations to go into effect requiring male students 18
and older to be registered for the draft in order to
receive federal financial aid.
"The draft issue delayed us and, a> a result, students
did not receive as early an opportunitv to review their
awards and request revisions," he said.
The regulations were originally put into law last fall
in the so-called Solomon Amendment, which was intro
duced by Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-New York). Under
the regulations, clarified last spring, students must
sign a form stating that they have registered for the
draft or are not required to register '.before receiving
Pell Grants, Guaranteed Student loans, or other forms
of financial aid from universities

Stanford's financial Aids Office had mailed about
half of its aid offers to students this summer when Stan
ford Against Conscription (SAC) requested a halt to
the proceedings, and a two-week delay ensued before
the mailings were resumed.
According to Roberta Johnson, assistant director for
advising and awarding, the SAC request was based on
the University's decision to send out registration forms
without stating that Stanford's policy is to meet the
financial needs of students regardless of whether they
have complied with the registration law or are eligible
for federal funds.
"We had finalized our aid offers in late lune for all
those students who had applied for aid by the April 15
deadline," lohnson said.
"We were ready to mail these computer notices by
mid-July, but were requested bv Stanford Against Con
scription to delay the remaining portion of that
mailing. The impact of those procedures has changed
our timing. Our staff is limited and has little flexibility
as far as the calendar is concerned, she said.
The University continued the mailing without includ
ing any additional statement, Johnson said, but has ful
filled the needs of all students tor assistance.
"There are about 20 stu
dents who have made them
selves known as conscientious
objectors to draft registra
tion. For these students the
University has replaced the
federal funds, usually
Guaranteed Student Loans,
with University loans of an
equivalent amount," she said.
One such conscientious ob
jector, sophomore Andrew
Shields, said the Financial Aids
Office has been "absolutely
phenomenal" in its assistance
efforts.
Shields, like some other
conscientious objectors, is
hoping for a Supreme Court
reversal of the Solomon
Amendment, which would
mean that aid could be
received regardless of
registration status.
Complicating the picture is
the fact that more revisions of
aid packages have been re

quested this year than in the
past—"near 1000" requests, ac
cording to Johnson.
According to DeAnda, "The
added revisions have led to
later processing of the forms.
This delay has prompted more
questions from the students;
these questions add to the
processing delay because
while we are dealing with
them it takes time away from
the actual processing. The
questions and processing
delay feed upon one another
and we become trapped in the
cycle."
Most of the revision re
quests stem from lower-than
projected earnings by stu
dents and their parents.
