A new law linking draft registration to receipt of
federal aid and an unusually high number of requests
for revaluation has caused a huge slowdown in the
processing of financial aid offers here, according to
financial aid officers.
"Draft registration is one problem in a sea of many,
but it is a major problem," according to Vincent
DeAnda, associate director of financial aid-
DeAnda said awards would have been ready on time
except for delays caused by the draft issue, which
arose this summer after the Supreme Court allowed
regulations to go into effect requiring male students 18
and older to be registered for the draft in order to
receive federal financial aid.
"The draft issue delayed us and, a> a result, students
did not receive as early an opportunitv to review their
awards and request revisions," he said.
The regulations were originally put into law last fall
in the so-called Solomon Amendment, which was intro
duced by Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-New York). Under
the regulations, clarified last spring, students must
sign a form stating that they have registered for the
draft or are not required to register '.before receiving
Pell Grants, Guaranteed Student loans, or other forms
of financial aid from universities

Stanford's financial Aids Office had mailed about
half of its aid offers to students this summer when Stan
ford Against Conscription (SAC) requested a halt to
the proceedings, and a two-week delay ensued before
the mailings were resumed.
According to Roberta Johnson, assistant director for
advising and awarding, the SAC request was based on
the University's decision to send out registration forms
without stating that Stanford's policy is to meet the
financial needs of students regardless of whether they
have complied with the registration law or are eligible
for federal funds.
"We had finalized our aid offers in late lune for all
those students who had applied for aid by the April 15
deadline," lohnson said.
"We were ready to mail these computer notices by
mid-July, but were requested bv Stanford Against Con
scription to delay the remaining portion of that
mailing. The impact of those procedures has changed
our timing. Our staff is limited and has little flexibility
as far as the calendar is concerned, she said.
The University continued the mailing without includ
ing any additional statement, Johnson said, but has ful
filled the needs of all students tor assistance.
