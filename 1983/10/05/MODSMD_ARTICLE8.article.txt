## Brazilian professor warns of impending financial disaster 
### DAVID HALE 
A political scientist from
Universidade de Brasilia, a
Brazilian University, called
the current political situation
in Brazil "explosive" in a
speech at Bolivar House Mon
day.
"If something is not done,
the country will fall into a
near-default situation next
month," Prof. David Fleischer
said in a speech about
"Brazilian Democracy After
The 1982 Elections."
Stanford History Prof. John
Wirth, an expert on Brazil,
said "Brazil is moving back to
a rule of law and procedures
in order to allocate power, a
system of classic democratic
politics."
Brazil has been ruled by mil
itary interests since 1964, and
this transition has been very
trying for the Brazilian go

vernment and economy.
In 1974, the Brazilian go
vernment sought a "quick fix"
to its problem of eroding
legitimacy, Fleischer said.
The military government
allowed relatively free elec
tions and thus began a "slow,
gradual process of liberaliza
tion."
The second stage of
liberalization, which he called
"abertura," began in 1978,
Fleischer said.
In the first phase of aber
tura, the old Brazilian two
party system was abolished.
The government also under
took numerous other
reforms, such as the release
of some political prisoners
and the return of exiles.
In the second phase, the go
vernment assumed a "divide
and conquer" system for
dealing with opposition par

ties, according to Fleischer.
Using this strategy, the go
vernment maintained a
majority in both houses and
remained in control.
The third phase began
when the head of the military
controlled government
resigned in 1981. Phase four
includes all events from the

November 1982 elections to
the present.
In the face of Brazil's
gloomy economic future,
Fleischer offered a few possi
ble political scenarios, but
concluded that the govern
ment would call for direct
elections only as "a last
resort."
