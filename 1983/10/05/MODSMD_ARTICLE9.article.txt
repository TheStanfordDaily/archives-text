# ASSU grad committee meets

### GLYNIS COSTIN 
Graduate student housing,
weapons research and the
proposed Reagan library
were the main topics of dis
cussion at the Graduate Edu
cation and Research (GER)
Committee's first meeting of
the quarter last night.
The eight members present
discussed a report written by
the Committee on Graduate
Student Housing and decided
that it would need several
revisions before being pre
sented to the Administrative
Council for final approval.
Some of the GER members
felt that the report, which
took a year to write, was
"weak"' and "too cautious."
Chairman lames McGrath
said the report did not repre
sent the demand for graduate
student housing strongly
enough, and motioned that
the committee advise a
redrafting of the report
before any further steps are
taken.
The committee also dis
cussed the proposed re

search at the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Labo
ratory which could be applied
to weapons.
It recommended that the
Committee on Graduate Re
search reevaluate current re
strictions, but made no defi
nite decisions.
The issue of the proposed
Reagan library complex
brought on some heated dis
cussions, as members of the

CER tried to assess possible
consequences of the pro
posed complex.
The committee decided to
wait until the current inves
tigations are finished.
"There are already three
committees looking into the
proposal," McGrath said,
"none of which has any stu
dent members. What can we
do?"
