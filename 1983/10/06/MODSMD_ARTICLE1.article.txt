# Union will give Kennedy petition
## USW protests $40 increase in permits 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Senior staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers
(USW) labor union is circulating a
petition asking that the University
lower the new $100 fee for "A"
parking stickers back to last year's
rate of $60.
The petition will be presented to
University President Donald Ken
nedy in a few weeks, according to
Barbara Hanfling-Martin, USW field
representative.
The fee increase, which went into
effect Oct. 1, represents a 66 per
cent increase for USW members,
who paid $60 last year for "A"
parking stickers. Non-USW
employees and students paid $75 for
the same stickers.
Robin Hamill, director of housing
and transportation programs, ex
plained that the increase was neces
sary to raise funds to extend the
Stanford Marguerite bus system,
which will begin expanded opera
tion in November.
The $20 fee for "C" parking per
mits was not changed, according to
Hamill. "C" parking lots are gener
ally further from campus buildings
than "A" parking lots.
Since the fee increase is larger for
USW employees, the union has, in
an August newsletter to its mem
bers, claimed that it is "being
penalized for negotiating an attrac
tive fee structure."

However, Priscilla Wheeler, the
University managing attorney for
labor, told The Daily that the
original discrepancy between the
union rate and the regular rate was
essentially a clerical error, and that
the USW understood that the lower

fee was temporary.
"They were beneficiaries last year
of a lower rate for 'A' stickers than
other employees because . . . we, as
a gesture of good faith, said that we
would not change something that
we had put forward to them," said

Wheeler. "And they were quite
aware at that time that that was for
that time period only, so I think its
unfortunate that they did not make
that fact known to their own mem
bers."

USW President Patrick Smith told
The Dailv yesterday that it was not
clear to the union that the lower fee
rate was temporary, but he
conceded that the lower union rate
was the result of a University
mistake.
The USW has charged that the
University acted in "less than good
faith" by failing to give the union iO
days notice before increasing the
parking fee, and by failing to discuss
how the increase will affect USW
members, as is required by a con
tract signed by the union and the
University last year.
Wheeler said, however, that the
University corrected its mistake by
postponing the fee increase until
Oct. 1. She also said that the Univer
sity and the union have recently met
to discuss the impact the increase
will have on USW members.
Smith told The Daily that the USW
is not satisfied with Stanford's
response to the union protest, and
has filed a grievance with the Uni
versitv. The USW president said that
the dispute will likely lead to ar
bitration.
Smith called the University's ac

tion "institutional discrimination,
noting that many employees
needing "A" parking cannot afford
to pay the $100 fee. He said that the
University is, in effect, forcing
people who do not make much
money to park further away from
their place of employment than
those who can afford the "A" stick
ers.
