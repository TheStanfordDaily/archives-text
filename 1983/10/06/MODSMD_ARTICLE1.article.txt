# Union will give Kennedy petition
## USW protests $40 increase in permits 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Senior staff writer 
The United Stanford Workers
(USW) labor union is circulating a
petition asking that the University
lower the new $100 fee for "A"
parking stickers back to last year's
rate of $60.
The petition will be presented to
University President Donald Ken
nedy in a few weeks, according to
Barbara Hanfling-Martin, USW field
representative.
The fee increase, which went into
effect Oct. 1, represents a 66 per
cent increase for USW members,
who paid $60 last year for "A"
parking stickers. Non-USW
employees and students paid $75 for
the same stickers.
Robin Hamill, director of housing
and transportation programs, ex
plained that the increase was neces
sary to raise funds to extend the
Stanford Marguerite bus system,
which will begin expanded opera
tion in November.
The $20 fee for "C" parking per
mits was not changed, according to
Hamill. "C" parking lots are gener
ally further from campus buildings
than "A" parking lots.
Since the fee increase is larger for
USW employees, the union has, in
an August newsletter to its mem
bers, claimed that it is "being
penalized for negotiating an attrac
tive fee structure."

However, Priscilla Wheeler, the
University managing attorney for
labor, told The Daily that the
original discrepancy between the
union rate and the regular rate was
essentially a clerical error, and that
the USW understood that the lower

fee was temporary.
"They were beneficiaries last year
of a lower rate for 'A' stickers than
other employees because . . . we, as
a gesture of good faith, said that we
would not change something that
we had put forward to them," said

Wheeler. "And they were quite
aware at that time that that was for
that time period only, so I think its
unfortunate that they did not make
that fact known to their own mem
bers."
