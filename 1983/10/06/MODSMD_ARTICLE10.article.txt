## The
						Stanford Daily Reformulate alcohol policy 
### 
It's a problem that nobody wants to talk
about. A problem that won't go away. But it's
clearly something that affects most on-campus
students, and one that deserves some thought.
Stanford, like most universities, is caught in
a quandary with regard to alcohol policy. The
problem would be easier to deal with if the
drinking age in California was 18. But the law is
explicit: Persons under 21 years of age shall not
purchase or consume alcoholic beverages.
Yet, just as speed limits don't stop all drivers
from speeding, legal regulations don't stop un
derage students from drinking. A recent poll of
San Mateo County high school seniors
revealed that 90 percent of the students drink
at least once a month. We may reasonably con
clude that most of Stanford's entering fresh
men have tried alcohol, and that many plan to
drink at parties on campus. The University
enters into the picture because these underage
students will be drinking in campus
residences.
No quick and easy solutions are available for
this problem. In the past, the University (under
the auspices of the Residental Education office)
has by and large ignored the situation. Incom
ing students are told in orientation packets to
use alcohol wisely by drinking in moderation.
Resident assistants have traditionally done
little to ease the pressure to drink. Rather, they
often went out to purchase kegs for freshman
parties â€” the RAs being the only ones "of age."
In many cases, "alternative beverages" were
not provided at orientation and dorm parties
(not to mention fraternity parties.)
But now the pendulum has swung too far in
the other direction. Last week the Res. Ed. of
fice indicated that, "RAs were encouraged to
de-emphasize drinking alcohol at all parties
during the year." Is this the first step towards

the prohibition of alcohol in all dorms?
While prohibition is not yet a part of the offi
cial University policy, it appears to be making
headway in some residences. Freshmen orien
tation parties at Florence Moore Hall were dry,
and similar parties at Wilbur served non
alcoholic "Pina Coladas" and "Daiquiris."
RAs are "encouraged" to have non-alcoholic
parties in a number of ways. The 21 RAs at Flo
Mo will probably receive free dinners in San
Francisco for having the best freshman party
because they did not serve alcohol. What
would you do if you were an RA?
Even more ridiculous is the new proposal
which would require the elimination of all
alcohol-related terms from the announce
ments of on-campus events. The proposal,
which is now circulating in the Dean of Student
Affairs and Res. Ed. offices, would ask eating
clubs and other organizations to rename
"happy hours." The term "Fridays at Five," is
suggested as a replacement.
Clearly though, a policy of alcohol repres
sion won't solve the basic problem. It will only
drive the drinkers underground into dorm
rooms and nearby bars.
The time has come for the University to sit
down with students and develop a balanced at
titude toward alcohol. Such a statement should
encourage RAs to provide both alcoholic and
"equally attractive" non-alcoholic beverages at
all dorm parties. The needs of all students
could then be met. A program could also be
developed to educate students on the rational
use of alcohol and on the problems associated
with alcohol abuse.
The University should spend its time think
ing of constructive solutions to the alcohol di
lemma. New names such as "Fridays at Five"
fool no one except their creators.
