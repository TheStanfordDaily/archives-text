## Accounting for a biased press 
### 
Over the past few weeks, we have been innundated
with press reports on the shooting down of a Korean
airliner by the Soviet Union. The myriad of articles have
speculated about what seems to be every conceivable
detail of the incident. We can read discussions of a lot
of things we never even thought to wonder about, such
as translations of Russian fighter pilot jargon, 747 iner
tial navigation systems, and broader discourses on the
incident's affect on the SALT talks. But, perhaps it is
time to try to put the incident in perspective. In reality,
how important was it?
Two-hundred sixty-nine people died, one of them a
U.S. congressman. A $40 million plane disappeared.
And we have another incident of Soviet brutality to use
in the propaganda wars. However, we can easily find
similar incidents, but with a far larger scale.
In 1981, the Syrians put down a Moslem Brotherhood
rebellion, destroying the city of Hama and killing be
tween 10,000 and 25,000 people. In the mid 19705, the
Indonesians killed many tens of thousands of people in
East Timor. In comparison, 269 deaths seems almost in
significant. Today, a $40 million deal is hardly men
tioned in the financial section.
The continuing wars in Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq,
Angola and Kampuchea (Cambodia), all involve more
deaths and property destruction than the Korean inci
dent. They are all actual or potential superpower con
frontations. Vet, they have all received less publicity
than the KAL jet. It is worth considering why.
The reasons are varied. First and foremost, an
airplane crash, especially a shooting makes a dramatic
story. The drama interests viewers and readers, boost
ing ratings and selling more newspapers.
In this case, the press coverage helped lead to
worldwide protests. Many countries' airline pilot as
sociations suspended flights to the USSR in protest. A
Korean government protest rally attracted 100,000
people. These protests became news events them
selves, leading to more press coverage.
Second, the attack occurred in the public eye. Al
though Kamchatka is not the center of the news world,
both the Korean and the U.S. governments have tried
to focus attention on the incident. They have held a

multitude of press conferences on various aspects of
the shooting.
The press has followed these leads. In general, the
news media tends to report the stories that are pre
sented to them, rather than deciding on their own what
is important. While there are outstanding investigative
reporters who find their own stories, they are rare.
Many of them work for smaller, less widely read
publications.
Sometimes reporters just report what they are told,
by governments or others. More frequently, they rely
on news sources to tell them which stories are impor
tant, rather than performing their own investigation.
Rarely do they find a story on their own. Almost always,
they report on the stories to which they have the
easiest access. Even the press coverage of the recent
congressional page scandal was the result of an FBI in
vestigation, rather than vice-versa.
This tendency is especially evident on the interna
tional scene. The war in Lebanon received extensive
coverage, even before the Marines were deployed,
while the far larger, longer running war between Iran
and Iraq was virtually ignored. In Lebanon, the press
had relatively easy access to both sides, while both Iran
and Iraq bar reporters from the front. Afghanistan is a
similar story. Likewise, when the Syrians destroyed
Hama, killing tens of thousands of people, the San
Francisco Chronicle barely mentioned the story. Only a
few small magazines gave the incident significant
coverage. The Indonesian killings on East Timor also
received little press coverage, most of it from small
magazines. So, few people know of the incidents. But,
when the Phalangists killed a far smaller number of
Palestinians in Lebanon, within easy reach of the press,
it became one of the biggest stories of the year.
Although the American news media generally tries to
be fair and objective, biases do creep in. There are
enough biases built into our system of choosing, gat
hering and reporting news to color any report or non
report. These biases must be accounted for in any at
tempt to understand world events.

coverage, even before the Marines were deployed,
while the far larger, longer running war between Iran
and Iraq was virtually ignored. In Lebanon, the press
had relatively easy access to both sides, while both Iran
and Iraq bar reporters from the front. Afghanistan is a
similar story. Likewise, when the Syrians destroyed
Hama, killing tens of thousands of people, the San
Francisco Chronicle barely mentioned the story. Only a
few small magazines gave the incident significant
coverage. The Indonesian killings on East Timor also
received little press coverage, most of it from small
magazines. So, few people know of the incidents. But,
when the Phalangists killed a far smaller number of
Palestinians in Lebanon, within easy reach of the press,
it became one of the biggest stories of the year.
Although the American news media generally tries to
be fair and objective, biases do creep in. There are
enough biases built into our system of choosing, gat
hering and reporting news to color any report or non
report. These biases must be accounted for in any at
tempt to understand world events.
