Defining the news
If well-known opponents of
Hoover's proposed Reagan com
plex set up a committee on the
Hoover project, and that committee
reported negatively, would The
Stanford Daily treat this as news
worthy of front-page attention?
The danger of running the report
of the Hoover committee on the
Reagan complex as news (Oct. 3) is
not merely that it raises questions
about The Daily's judgment as to
what constitutes news, but that it
gives the false impression to the
Stanford community that a credible
committee has reported favorably
on the project. Surely the Daily
reporter who wrote the story
should have included a phrase such
as "to no one's surprise" the com
mittee headed by a former Reagan
assistant endorsed the complex, as
you did in your editorial generally
opposing it.
Over the past several months
Daily coverage of the Hoover con
troversy has not always been as

partial to our side as I would have
liked, which probably means it has
been good journalism. In the case
of your October 3 lead story I think
it would be only fair to run a box
emphasizing the partisan source of
the story. I realize that the Ander
son committee is identified as
Hoover-connected, but it still mis
leads the public to treat such a
report prominently as a news story.

While debate freely abounds at
Stanford regarding weapons re
search and the role of the Hoover
Institution among other controver
sies, elsewhere debate does not
abound at all.
On September 14,1983, in San
Salvador, El Salvador, Prof. Fran
cisco Carrillo Cabrara, director of
the international relations depart
ment at the University of El Sal
vador, and another professor,
Pedro Flores, were abducted by

armed men in civilian clothes.
Pedro Flores' body was found 10
days later. He had been murdered.
The whereabouts of Professor Car
rillo is unknown.
Earlier, Professors Emile Martinez
and Carlos Urquei of the depart
ment of economics at the Univer
sity of El Salvador were abducted in
the same manner and their
whereabouts is still unknown. Their
disappearance has effectively meant
the end to the economics depart
ment at the university.
The government denies any
knowledge of their whereabouts
but the university has been a fre
quent target of the right-wing go
vernment and of their paramilitary
forces (death squads).
I hope that as members of an
academic community, all of us
would realize the courage of these
professors in pursuing academic
freedom in such a climate, a pursui'
that may well have cost them their
lives.
