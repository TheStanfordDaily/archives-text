## A
						society of veggies and peace pipes

As I find myself surrounded more
and more by the junior executive at
titude that was supposed to have
gone out of style in the 19605, I have
often wondered what it would have
been like to go to school in a differ
ent time â€” a time when political
idealists, rebellious youth and in
ventive artists set the cultural pace.
This summer I discovered a place
where the frustrated have joined in
rebellion against today's cultural
norms and in conformity with those
of the past. The place is Isla Vista,
adjacent to the University of Califor
nia at Santa Barbara. Isla Vista is a
small but active town of student lef
tists, vegetarians and co-op mem
bers.
In Isla Vista, the courageous ga
ther. Every young person has the
moral strength to resist the draft,
but none can resist mushrooms.
"Mushrooms expand my mind,"
said one resident. "They give me in
sight and imagination I never had
before. Draft resisters today need
imagination to cope with the cruel
fact that there is no real draft for us
to resist."
Mushrooms are the primary staple
in the diet of the Isla Vistans since
they are, naturally, vegetarians.
Second only to mushrooms in their
vegetarian diet is grass. Explained
one herbivore, "We in Isla Vista love
vegetables. In fact, many of us are
vegetables."

The motto of Isla Vista is "The
People, Yes." But the first thing that
catches one's attention in Isla Vista
is not the people, but their bumper
stickers. One ardent collector said,
"Bumper stickers educate the
public. I learned all of my politics
from bumper stickers. Now I'm
trying to repay the public that ed
ucated me. Check it out. I need only
one more sticker to totally cover my
Volkswagen and complete my state
ment."
I had gone to Isla Vista to visit my
high school friend, Lenny Baruch,
who now lives there even in the
summer. I did not really know what
to expect. The only clue I had that
Lenny had rediscovered the ideals
of the '60s was when he came home
from school one Christmas vacation
with splotchy clusters of facial hair.
"I'm growing this beard for peace,"
he told me defensively.
Anyway, I thought it would be
nice to visit him in his new environ
ment. But upon entering his apart
ment, I was assaulted by peace.
Hanging right in his entryway was a
huge banner asking, "What have
you done for peace?" This made me
feel very guilty since I had shaved
that morning.
In addition to the banner, there
was peace paraphernalia every
where: peace posters, peace
pamphlets, peace postcards, peace
plants and peace pipes. I had not
seen so much peace paraphernalia
since the war. Lenny's most prized
possession was his button collection
on his bulletin board near his bed.
Buttons," he told me, "educate
even better than bumper stickers.
Bumper stickers can get wordy and
cloud the issue, while buttons,
being smaller, have to be more
concise."
Upon closer examination of his
peace posters, I noticed one that
declared, "The First Priority is
Peace." Another advertised a rally
"In Solidarity with the Salvadoran
Guerrillas." (Guerrilla is derived
from the Spanish guerra meaning
'war.') So I asked Lenny, "Do you
support the cause of the guerrillas,
or their armed struggle as well?"
"I support both. An armed
struggle is their only path to
freedom. Why do you ask?"
"Isn't peace the first priority?"
Leon, you didn't come here so
we could argue politics. Let me
show you the town."

His first friend's apartment was
decorated with peace paraphernalia
of every kind: peace posters, peace
pamphlets, peace postcards, peace
plants and peace pipes. His most
prized possession was his button
collection on his bulletin board near
his bed.
His second friend's apartment was
decorated with peace paraphernalia
of every kind: peace posters, peace
pamphlets, peace postcards, peace
plants and peace pipes. His most
prized possession was his button
collection on his bulletin board near
his bed.
It turned out that every single stu
dent in Isla Vista decorated his or
her apartment the same way, a fan
tastic coincidence since all of them
were non-conformists in high
school. Not only did these non
conformists decorate their rooms
the same way, they supported all the
same political causes, ate the same
co-op food, used the same drugs
and listened to the same music.
After I met Lenny's friends, we all
went out for vegetarian burgers and
tea. Desperate by this time for any
kind of meat, but not wanting to em
barrass Lenny in front of his friends,
I inconspicuously purchased a pack
age of smuggled-in beef bouillon
cubes, which I later secretly dis
solved in my herb tea.
The conversation, like the restau
rant, served a variety of platitudes.
"If only everyone in the world were
like everyone in Isla Vista, there
would be no need for wars,'
proclaimed one of Lenny's friends,
wearing a "Nuke Reagan" T-shirt.
A more highbrow member of the
party put her knowledge of historv
to good use, quoting Lenin: "All we
are saying is give peace a chance."
Lenny and his friends have been
to a lot of rallies in the last three
years. He keeps on going because
he is convinced that his participa
tion has kept the United States out
of war, halted the draft and
prevented U.S. government over
reaction to small Soviet manifesta
tions of fear like the downing ot
flight 007. His biggest worry right
now is that if he keeps it up, the
public might give Reagan rather
than the Isla Vistan peace lover*
credit for all of this restraint. That
would mean at least another four
years without meat or razor blades.
