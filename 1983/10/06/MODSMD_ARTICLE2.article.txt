# Weapons project still displeases many researchers

### LISA LYNCH Senior staff writer 
Despite an apparent lull in organ
ized opposition to a recently ap
proved weapons-related project at
the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL), workers at the
laboratory and at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) say they
remain discontented with the plan.
At least five people on the 55-
person staff of SSRL remain
"extremely opposed" to the project
and are considering quitting, accor
ding to Robert Mayer, a vacuum
technician there. Mayer said this fig
ure may be higher and that there
"may be others who haven't talked
to me about it."
Mayer said at first many of the
staff members at SSRL were
"appeased" by the project, which
was accepted last week by SSRL
Director Arthur Bienenstock after
months of deliberation.
Bienenstock said he accepted a
revised version of the proposal
which "clarified" past misinforma
tion about what kind of research will
take place at SSRL.
Some of the research that the

project's opponents object to will
not be included in the plan,
Bienenstock said.
Many workers at SSRL and SLAC
oppose the project, sponsored by
Los Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratories and
the University of California and
funded by the Department of Ener
gy's Office of Military Applications
and UC, because some of the work
will involve nuclear weapons re
search.
Mayer said, however, that there is
about an equal number of staunch
supporters and opponents of the
plan, and that the majority of the
SSRL staff has not made a firm deci
sion against or in support of the
project.
Mayer, who has worked at SSRL
for four years, said he has not
decided if he will quit because of
the project.
"I can't see myself participating in
this, though," he said.
Twenty-three of 30 SLAC faculty
members signed a petition this sum
mer addressed to Bienenstock and
SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky
that "opposed work directly
motivated by nuclear weapons re
search."
"It was just an indication of our
feelings," said SLAC faculty member
Roger Miller, who signed the peti
tion. "I just believe that if you
develop nuclear weapons, they will
be implemented. The arms race is
counterproductive. I wouldn't put it
as a question of morality, but of sur
vival."
SLAC Deputy Director Sidney
Drell said, however, that opposition
to the project has diminished since
it was accepted by Bienenstock.
"I don't see major, extensive ac
tion on the part of the SLAC fac
ulty, " he said.
