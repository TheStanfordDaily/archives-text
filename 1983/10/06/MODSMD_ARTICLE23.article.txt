# Food Research: not a Food Service training ground
## 
### BOB ORTTUNG 
Contrary to popular belief,
the Food Research Institute
(FRI) is not a place where Food
Service chefs dream up new
and ingenious ways to prepare
eggplant.
Rather, the institute is actu
ally a group of applied
economists working on food
and agriculture problems, not
food technology. Faculty at
FRI analyze such topics as the
agricultural and economic im
pact of Portugal joining the
European Common Market
and the issues of emigration,
rural development and secur
ity in U.S.-Mexican relations.
In addition, FRI has a special
demographics unit which in
vestigates population growth
and its effect on agriculture.
The goal ot FRI is to "try to
interest and inform the gen
eral policy- makers about spe
cific agricultural food issues
and how they affect what deci
sion makers should be
doing," said FRI Director Wal
ter Falcon.
FRI also "analyzes issues in
macropolicy and how they af
fect the food system," Falcon
added.
One of FRI s projects in
volves research on Indonesia's
cassava crop. Cassava, an
edible root, is a good source
of energy and one of the
cheapest food sources
available in Indonesia. Its
drawbacks, however, are that
it has little protein and its skin
contains cyanide.The in
stitute's researchers are trying
to determine who eats cassava
and the effects of consump
tion.

Thev are also interested in
export markets in Western
Europe. As a result of agricul
tural policy in Europe, the
price ot cassava is unnaturally
high. This helps the In
donesian producers but hurts
low income European buyers.
The institute considers itself
a little different than most re
search institutes because it
has two distinct views of the
tood system. One involves the
conventional aspects of
production-consumption,
marketing, trade and macro
policy.
The other view points out
that there is more to feeding
the world population than just
increasing actual food produc
tion. "When dealing with food
systems one is dealing with
multiple objectives: growth,
income distribution and
employment, nutrition, issues

of food security, how selt
reliant a country can he and
how they can best use interna
tional trade," Falcon said.
Drawing from the experi
ence ot teaching these ideas in
six countries, Falcon and Scott
Pearson have written Food
Policy Analysis to tocus on
their twotold view of the tood
system and "to show to what
extent each individual country
is going to have to learn to
make sensible policy and live
with some international in
stability versus the extent to
which they can hope lor and
expect international policy to
take care of them," Falcon
said.
"At some point you say,
'Now, what do I really
believe?' We tried to write the
book in a way we thought
people would read and under
stand, so there are not a lot of

equations. It was a difficult,
frustrating, invigorating expe
rience to try to put down what
you really think are the impor
tant things," Falcon said.
In terms ot actually solving
the problem of world hunger,
researchers say that the ques
tion to ask is, "Who are the
hungry and why are they
hungry?"
Two-thirds of the world's
hungry live in 10 countries â€”
China, India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Cambodia, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Eth
iopia, /aire and Brazil.
"Anybody serious about
hunger has to deal with these
countries," Falcon said.
"Most of the hungry live in
rural areas, and don't have
access to land; most have only
the most minor jobs. Most are
hungry because they don't

have income, in short, it's
poverty," Falcon said.
To solve the problem a
country must have some sort
of development program to
give the poor a source of
income or one must have a
welfare system to give the un
dernourished access to food,
Falcon said.
But these programs are ex
pensive and difficult to run. It
is difficult politically and
economically to reach into the
countryside in a society that
doesn't have very good rural
facilities. In addition it is com
plicated to do this in such a
way that will not destroy the
farmer's incentive for long-run
production potential, Falcon
said.
"Most countries have the
capacity to teed themselves,
or at least to grow something
to export and then import the
food they need," according to
Falcon.
But before this ideal is ac
complished a lot of things
have to go right. "You have to
have good economic policy,
some help, and some luck."
Although FKI is called an
"institute," scholars there ac
tually consider it a "graduate
teaching, research depart
ment." Students do work in
applied economics and ap
plied fields of food and
agriculture development, in
cluding field work in the
countries they are studying.
Founded in 1921, the in
stitute now has 13 faculty
members, and a budget of
$1.7 million. Fifty graduate stu
dents study there, half ot
whom are foreign.

LOOKING INTO EDIBLES: No matter what anyone thinks, the Stanford Food Research In
stitute is not a training ground for Food Service chefs. Rather, it's home for many types of
food-related research.
