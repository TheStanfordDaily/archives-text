# A 						U.S. Marine tells the inside story
## 
### BRAD BARHAM 
Panama City, Panama — On the train
going from Colon to Panama City,
most of his buddies slept. Joe, a
Marine mortarman from upstate New
York, obliged my questions, im
pressed, he said, by my courage in
coming on my own to Central America
and especially to Nicaragua.
"We're here on a three-week train
ing mission, doing counterinsurgency
exercises and learning how to survive
in the jungle," Joe explained.
Panama is the center of the U.S.
Southern Command Zone and the site
of American training facilities for sol
diers from the United States and much
of Latin America. Joe and his buddies
were at the Marine Camp Lejeune.
Other branches of the armed services
were busy carrying on their own
maneuvers at other camps.
"Yeah, we may go to Central
America. You never know in the
Marines. One day they tell you you're
going home. The next day you find
yourself in battle. "
Joe spoke slowly and in simple sen
tences. His battalion of 700 fellow
Marines had spent three days and
nights in the jungle on an exercise that
week. All three nights rain had poured
on them as they lay in their clothes on
the ground without any waterproof
covering. He had hardly slept at all be
cause pf,the rain. Yet he seemed in no
hurry to answer my questions. He wds
on weekend leave, relaxed and ready
"to get drunk and raise some hell."

"Naw, the Marines ain't really an ad
venture. It's, well, more or less a job. "
Joe was entering his second year of a
five-year stint at E-2, one rank above
the lowest, an E-1. During his first year
he had earned $571 per month, and he
was now earning $671. He hoped by
his fifth year to be a sergeant, earning
over $1000 a month.
"It's hard to save any money. On
weekends you want to have fun, party
with your buddies. You've got to keep
your uniform looking good, and then
you fly home a few times. The money
goes quickly.''

'/S/aiv, the Marines ain't
really an adventure. It's,
well, more or less a job/

Joe graduated from high school in
1981 and began working full time in a
warehouse. "At $3.50 an hour, I was
getting nowhere. I was living at home.
Jobs that paid any better were just not
available, especially in 1981.
"My parents agreed with me. The
Marines might be one way to get a
start. We all knew that more school
wasn't for me."
Joe's buddies, by his description,
iwere pretty similar. Many had chosen
the Marines over the unemployment
lines. They were, like himself, mortar
men. In our coach about a third were

black and all were young, 18- to 22-
years-old. They looked too young to
fight, but Joe assured me that they
were ready to do their job.
"El Salvador and, uh, Nicaragua are
hot spots right now. We're all wonder
ing what they're waiting for. I guess
public opinion is holding them back.
"Yeah, maybe the 1984 elections
too. I don't know. We keep expecting
to go there or to Lebanon. That's one
thing I don't like about the Marines, al
ways being jerked around like a yo-yo
and kept in the dark. I suppose they
are afraid we'd desert or something if
they told us the plans. But, heck, it's
our job. We'll do what they order."
Joe seemed to be growing weary. I
suggested we talk about the future.
"I'm not sure I'll stay with the
Marines after 1987 when my stint ends.
I can't evaluate it yet. It's only been a
year. Depends on my opportunities, I
guess. It's not really a very good job,
you know. Pay's low and work's hard.
But it was better than going nowhere.
"Dying? Naw, I'm not afraid of it. I
guess that comes with the training, but
I don't think about it much. Part of my
job .... Hey, do you mind if I go to
sleep for a while? We're going to have
a wild time tonight, you know."
"Naw," I said. "Thanks for talking
this long."
"My pleasure, sir. Take care of your
self, especially in Nicaragua. That's a
hot spot, you know."
"Same to you," I offered as he fell
asleep.

I can't evaluate it yet. It's only been a
year. Depends on my opportunities, I
guess. It's not really a very good job,
you know. Pay's low and work's hard.
But it was better than going nowhere.
"Dying? Naw, I'm not afraid of it. I
guess that comes with the training, but
I don't think about it much. Part of my
job .... Hey, do you mind if I go to
sleep for a while? We're going to have
a wild time tonight, you know."
"Naw," I said. "Thanks for talking
this long."
"My pleasure, sir. Take care of your
self, especially in Nicaragua. That's a
hot spot, you know."
"Same to you," I offered as he fell
asleep.

Panama City, Panama — On the train
going from Colon to Panama City,
most of his buddies slept. Joe, a
Marine mortarman from upstate New
York, obliged my questions, im
pressed, he said, by my courage in
coming on my own to Central America
and especially to Nicaragua.
"We're here on a three-week train
ing mission, doing counterinsurgency
exercises and learning how to survive
in the jungle," Joe explained.
Panama is the center of the U.S.
Southern Command Zone and the site
of American training facilities for sol
diers from the United States and much
of Latin America. Joe and his buddies
were at the Marine Camp Lejeune.
Other branches of the armed services
were busy carrying on their own
maneuvers at other camps.
"Yeah, we may go to Central
America. You never know in the
Marines. One day they tell you you're
going home. The next day you find
yourself in battle. "
Joe spoke slowly and in simple sen
tences. His battalion of 700 fellow
Marines had spent three days and
nights in the jungle on an exercise that
week. All three nights rain had poured
on them as they lay in their clothes on
the ground without any waterproof
covering. He had hardly slept at all be
cause pf,the rain. Yet he seemed in no
hurry to answer my questions. He wds
on weekend leave, relaxed and ready
"to get drunk and raise some hell."

"Naw, the Marines ain't really an ad
venture. It's, well, more or less a job. "
Joe was entering his second year of a
five-year stint at E-2, one rank above
the lowest, an E-1. During his first year
he had earned $571 per month, and he
was now earning $671. He hoped by
his fifth year to be a sergeant, earning
over $1000 a month.
"It's hard to save any money. On
weekends you want to have fun, party
with your buddies. You've got to keep
your uniform looking good, and then
you fly home a few times. The money
goes quickly.''

'/S/aiv, the Marines ain't
really an adventure. It's,
well, more or less a job/

Joe graduated from high school in
1981 and began working full time in a
warehouse. "At $3.50 an hour, I was
getting nowhere. I was living at home.
Jobs that paid any better were just not
available, especially in 1981.
"My parents agreed with me. The
Marines might be one way to get a
start. We all knew that more school
wasn't for me."
Joe's buddies, by his description,
iwere pretty similar. Many had chosen
the Marines over the unemployment
lines. They were, like himself, mortar
men. In our coach about a third were

black and all were young, 18- to 22-
years-old. They looked too young to
fight, but Joe assured me that they
were ready to do their job.
"El Salvador and, uh, Nicaragua are
hot spots right now. We're all wonder
ing what they're waiting for. I guess
public opinion is holding them back.
"Yeah, maybe the 1984 elections
too. I don't know. We keep expecting
to go there or to Lebanon. That's one
thing I don't like about the Marines, al
ways being jerked around like a yo-yo
and kept in the dark. I suppose they
are afraid we'd desert or something if
they told us the plans. But, heck, it's
our job. We'll do what they order."
Joe seemed to be growing weary. I
suggested we talk about the future.
"I'm not sure I'll stay with the
Marines after 1987 when my stint ends.
I can't evaluate it yet. It's only been a
