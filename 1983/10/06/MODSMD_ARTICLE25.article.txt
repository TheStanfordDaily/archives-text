# Why do we get keyed?
## Bug Me 
### 
We invite you to join our
editor in celebrating the tri
umphant, albeit belated
return of Bug Me to the pages
of The Daily after a slightly ex
tended summer vacation.
Before we get too deeply in
volved with the first Bug Me
question of the year, let's
briefly go over the rules of the
game.
Vou get to bug us with all of
those annoying, trivial ques
tions that have been bugging
you, causing sleep-loss, lack
of concentration, inattention
to personal hygiene and tem
porary bouts of insanity. We
get to spend our days and
nights searching through
dusty books buried deep in
the archives and basements of
Green and Meyer, begging
bits of information from the
great bureaucratic machines
of the University and chasing
down the stories and recollec
tions of the alumni and faculty
who "made it happen."
Whether your question con
cerns the past, present or
future of Stanford, from
"whatever happened to such
and-such" to "why on earth
are they doing so-and-so," if
we can't find out, you'll prob
ably never know. But then,
that's what we're paid for. So
without further ado, on to Bug
Me.
Why does everybody shake
their keys during football games
and how long has this ritual
been going on?
--Keyed but confused
The initial investigation into
your question turned up dis
couraging, if not completely
unexpected results; as far as
anyone on campus can re
member, Stanford students
have been rattling their keys at
rival schools and more specifi
cally, at their band, forever.
Gary Robinson, manager and
spokesperson for the incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band this
year, explained that people
who shake their keys are
saying that "the other band is
shitty and ours is great," but
confessed ignorance of the ac
tual genesis of the gesture.
Other explanations people

have given for the waving of
keychains in the air range
from "I'm getting keyed for
Big Game" to "It makes a cool
sound and drowns out the San
Jose State fight song." And
besides, "we've always done
it."
We turned next to the ranks
of the Stanford alumni, un-

covering several more ex
planations for the key phe
nomenon which were, if noth
ing else, definitely more crea
tive than contemporary ver
sions.
Mike Whalen, class of '77,
placed the first key-rattling in
cident during the half-time
show of a Big Came played at
Berkeley in either 1976 or
1978. The incident, says
Whalen, was a part of the
Bands'latest rendition of "My
Old School" which included a
drum solo, a horn solo and fi
nally a solo wherein the
manager stood up and played
his keys. The act was ap
parently well-received by the
key-bearing Stanford student
body.
Jim Polk, class of '76, also
claims that the first key
shaking occurred at the 1976
Big Game. His recollection is
that key-shaking stemmed di
rectly from the Cal/Stanford
rivalry. After Cal put on a half
time show ridiculing the
stereotypically rich Stanford
student, someone (Polk is
unsure if it was in fact a Band
member) stood up and shook
his or her new car keys at Cal.

Thus the initial symbolism of
the keys was "a flaunting of
the materialistic superiority of
our school," and a "punitive
display of monetary wealth."
After that, Polk claims, every
one realized "Wow, this is a
nice noise!" and all it took was
for someone to shout out "I'm
keyed!"

Finally, I talked to Hal Mick
elson, "Voice of the Band" for
the past decade or so, who
generally confirmed the
alums' story. He placed the ex
act time of the first key
shaking on or around the 1976
Berkeley game and claimed
that Mary Setrakian, class of
'81, was the first person he
had seen waving keys.
However he admitted that "it
could very well have been a
band member who started the
tradition." He reminded us,
on the other hand, that no
band manager for the past 10
years has had a car worth brag
ging about, and he vigorously
denied a suggestion that the
Band had prepared a version
of "My Old School" entitled
"My New Car," claiming that
"My New Car" was too long to
spell. Mickelson left us with
this thought, though: The
Stanford Fight Song, long for
gotten by everyone but him,
begins, "Sons of the Stanford
Red, fight for your alma
mater." The first words of the
Cal parody of the Stanford
Fight Song, sung to this day,
are "Sons of the wealthy few,
fight for the four-holed
Buick."
