## No. 15 Cardinal kilters beat Chico State 3-1 
### JOHN LIS 
The Stanford women's field
hockey team took another
step toward a possible NCAA
tournament berth yesterday,
defeating visiting Chico State,
3-1, to raise the Card record to
5-3.
The game was scoreless
through the first 50 minutes of
play, though the 15th-ranked
Cardinal clearly dominated
play throughout the first half.
Chico State came out after
halftime, and took the play to
the Card.
In the first 12 minutes Chico
State had several opportuni
ties to score, but Cardinal
goalie Bonnie Warner was
equal to the task.
Stanford got its first tally at
the 15:29 mark of the second
half. )unior forward Jennifer
Bleakley took a centering pass
off of a penalty corner and
knocked it home to put the
Cardinal ahead. It was Bleak
ley's third goal of the year.
Two and a half minutes later
Stanford made it 2-0. Senior
All-America forward Patsy
Huntington scooped up a
loose ball in front of the Chico
State net and drilled it home
for her fourth goal of the
season, coming at the 17:56
mark.
Despite being down 2-0,
Chico State refused to be
counted out, coming right
back into the Cardinal end.
junior Karen Schweikardt took
a pass from teammate Linda
Lambert following a penalty
corner and beat Warner to
close the gap to 2-1 at 20:20.
The Card struck right back.
Sophomore forward Karen
Chamberlain put the final nail
into the Chico State coffin,
taking a pass from freshman
midfielder Mary Chung after a

penalty corner and beating
Chico State goalie Cheryl
DeCrasse to put the Cardinal
on top 3-1 at 21:43. It was
Chamberlain's second goal,
and Chung's second assist.
Chico State made a last
ditch effort with tour minutes
left to pull even, but the Stan
ford defense cleared its end
with just over a minute left,
and ran out the clock tor the
win.
The Cardinal dominance of
the first half was born out in
the statistics. Stanford un
loaded 14 shots on goal,
compared with only two for
Chico State. The second half
was another story, as Chico
State outshot the Cardinal, 13-
9.
Warner played an outstand
ing game in goal to keep the
Card in the game, making 10
saves. Eight of those came in
the second half, and some
verged on larceny, robbing
Chico State of several fine
scoring opportunities.
In spite of the victory, coach
Onnie Killefer was not entirelv
pleased. "We played kind of
slow the first half," she said.
"We did pick up the second
half, though."
This weekend the Cardinal
will travel to Evanston, Illinois
to play in the Northwestern In
vitational. The Cardinal will
face three of the Midwest's
top teams - third-ranked lowa,
10th-ranked Northwestern,
and 12th-ranked Southwest
Missouri.
The NCAA tournament will
take the top 12 teams in the
country. Stanford, currently
ranked 15th, could reach the
elite dozen with a couple of
victories.
