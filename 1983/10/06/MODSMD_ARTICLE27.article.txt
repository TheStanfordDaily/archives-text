Baltimore - In .1 game lh.it was a paradigm ot pressurized,
nerve-shredding plavott baseball, the Baltimore Orioles
came unglued lit the seams vesterday in Memorial
Stadium and lost .111 e\( rue iating championship series
opener to the Chicago White Sox, 2-1.
A week ot confession couldn't expiate the sins commit
ted bv these two learns, nor could a short highlight film do
justice to the magnificent plays that counterpointed those
mistakes so starkh.
The one man, however, who bad narv a mark against his
namewas C hicago s Incredible Bulk - right-hander LaMarr
Hoyt who allowed only five hits and walked no one in a
classic October eitort. The White Sox's 24-garne winner
overmatched the Orioles for the third time in two months
with his marvelous control and combative attitude.
Hovt weathered only one crisis in his almost stainless
game. But that crisis was a beauty. Riding a 2-0 shutout
into the ninth the ()rioles having had only three base run
ners and o n |y one man past iirst base, Hoyt hit a snag.
Murray swung at the tirst pitch â€” a low-away fast ball off
the plate thai lie could not possibly have struck with au
thority and sent a grounder back through the mound tor a
routine game-ending force .it second base. Thus ended
Murray's /ero-tor-toui day and a continuation of his
bi/arre postseason miseries.
The visitors, who have won Wot their last 48 games,
plaved <i steady game defensively and showed none of the
anguish in the presence of batted balls that plagued the
Orioles. The White Sox, however, could not truthfully
look at this game and say that they were a pressure-proof
team.
In the seventh, eighth and ninth innings, they left men
at second and third base three times.
