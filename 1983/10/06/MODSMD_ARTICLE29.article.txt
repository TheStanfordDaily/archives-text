Ivatching Daniel, Sidney
lumet's film of the E.L. Doc
lorow novel The Book of
vaniel, adapted by Doctorow
liimself. The movie offers
large chunks of the book — an
[epic construction that bridges
the two great eras of American
'socialism by postulating that
the children of Communists
executed for conspiracy in the
early 1950s (when Joe McCar
thy, the Cold War and the Sta
lin purges crushed the first
hopeful era) might become
the protesters of the Vietnam
years — delivered by a large, im
pressive cast, and it contains
moments of undeniable
power. It certainly isn't a
stupid, cartoon misreading,
like Milos Forman's movie of
Ragtime was, but it's mostly an
incoherent jumble, full of
confused signals and half
formed ideas.
Doctorow used the story of
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg,
represented by a couple
named Paul and Rochelle
Isaacson, as a starting point,
but though the book has been
read by Rosenberg champions
as an indictment of the for
ces that convicted and elec
trocuted them (because
Doctorow provides no
evidence of the Isaacsons'
guilt), to take these fictional
figures as literal stand-ins for
Julius and Ethel would be as
foolhardy as perceiving Citi
zen Kane as an authentic biog
raphy of William Randolph
Hearst. Doctorow was inter
ested in how the Rosenberg
trial sifted the sands of the
Jewish immigrant experience
in this country in the early

20th century, in how it re
flected the creation of a
leftist sensibility in second
generation ghetto Jews, and in
its implications for the third
generation. The book con
cerns the disenchantment and
despair with America that
formed men and women like
the Rosenbergs, and it makes
an imaginative stab at what
dark magic the public trial and
execution of parents might
work on the awakening con
sciousness of their children.
"This is what happens to us, to
the children of trials; our
hearts run to cunning, our
minds are sharp as claws,"

The movie offers large chunks of the
book . . . delivered by a large, impressive
cast, and it contains moments of un
deniable power. It certainly isn't a stupid,
cartoon misreading, like Milos Forman's
movie of' Ragtim e' was, but it's mostly an
incoherent jumble, full of confused
signals and half-formed ideas.

writes Daniel Isaacson, who
acts as narrator and inter
preter in Doctorow's fine, im
passioned novel.
But Daniel doesn't narrate
the movie, so we are deprived
of a perspective that would
guide us in evaluating the
emotionally saturated material
Lumet and Doctorow throw at
us. Remnants of the feverish
first person point of view—like
Daniel's obsession with the
history of torture, surviving in
monologues rendered by
Timothy Hutton to the camera
in close-up — bewilder us, be
cause they are no longer
plugged into any vision of the
events in the plot. And,
removed from their place in
the novel's organization,
scenes like the execution take
on a new political weight.
When Daniel described his
parents' deaths in the novel,
we recognized the sig
nificance of the horrendous
details for him. In the film,
Daniel is not part of the nar
rative process and it is we who
undergo the torture of watch

ing the bodies of the Isaacsons
writhing in the electric chair.
And since Doctorow incor
porated the well-known detail
of the additional volts admini
stered to Ethel Rosenberg
(who was not legally dead after
the first dose), fact and fantasy
become hopelessly entangled
in this sequence in the movie -
we seem to be watching a
pointlessly gruesome re
creation of history, as the cul
mination of a piece of fiction
suggested by history. Coming
out just subsequent to the
publication of The Rosenberg
Trials, in which Ronald Radosh
and Judith Milton conclude

that the Rosenbergs were like
ly not framed by the FBI,
Daniel may appear to be a
muddleheaded refutation of
Radosh and Milton's findings,
when in fact Doctorow clearly
intended something quite dif
ferent in his novel.
Because I haven't read the
screenplay, I don't know how
much of Doctorow's plan was
sabotaged by Sidney Lumet or
by the editor, Peter Frank, but
it's impossible to make sense
of a movie carved up in this
fashion. There's an unfat
homable flashback structure:
The selection of 1940s and '50s
scenes to follow '60s scenes
struck me as completely arbi
trary,and one crucial incident
the attack by American
Legionnaires on buses return
ing from the Paul Robeson
concert at Peekskill — is
chopped into two segments,
separated by nearly an hour of
screen time, so that by the
time Lumet returns to the se
quence we have forgotten the
first part of it. The PeekskiH
concert was a great symbolic

rallying point for American
socialists who felt that they
had been beaten down by
House Un-American Activities
Committee and the anti-
Sovietism of the Cold War, but
none of that is clarified in
Daniel, so the scene - in which
Paul Isaacson (Mandy Patinkin)
confronts the armed assailants
out of a feeling of outraged
indignation - has no resonance.
And viewers unaware of what
Robeson meant to leftists of the
Rosenberg epoch may wonder
why this warm, immense basso
profurtdo rings through the
movie.
They may be left with a lot of
other unanswered questions
too: Does Lumet satirize the
Peekskill concertgoers singing
folk songs on the bus, or is the
autumnal light on their faces
just incompetent sentimen
talizing? Why is the black
janitor who tells the children
that their mother has been ar
rested presented as a creepy,
menacing figure? Why are we
given the impression that
Daniel's sister Susan (Amanda
Plummer), institutionalized
following a suicide attempt, is
dead when he visits her hospi
tal room — until she opens her
eyes at the end of the scene?
Why does Lumet stage
Daniel's reunion with the
daughter (Tovah Feldshuh) of
the chief witness against his
parents as though it were a
sketch on Saturday Night Live?
Lumet's last picture, The
Verdict, looked over
rehearsed, and the photogra
phy and editing had an
overbaked veneer, but in
Daniel, Sidney Lumet, king of
the shooting schedule slaves,
resurfaces-Sidney Lumet, who
is famous in Hollywood for
bringing a movie in under
budget and ahead of time. His
talent manifests itself in
beautifully realized moments
like the passing of the children

over the heads of the crowd at
a rally to free the Isaacsons, or
the boy Daniel's thrusting his
arms in the air so that the
prison guard can frisk him
when he goes to see his par
ents. But his catch-as-catch
can technique garbles the
meaning of what he has as
sembled and plays hell with
the performances. I can't re
member when I've seen so
many good actors so poorly
lit, haphazardly costumed,
and carelessly shot.
Whenever we see Ellen
Barkin, who plays the severely
underwritten role of Daniel's
wife Phyllis, part of her head is
sliced out of the frame or she
is hidden behind other actors,
yet she gives a peerless
demonstration of how a first
rate actress creates a whole
character out of a few shreds
of dialogue. Barkin plays this
sensuous, full-hearted, not
especially-bright woman with
the same acute consciousness

But his catch-as
catch-can technique
garbles the
meaning of what he
has assembled and
plays hell with the
performances. I
can't remember
when I've seen so
many good actors
so poorly lit, hap
hazardly costumed
and carelessly shot.

of milieu that marked her very
different characterizations in
Diner and Tender Mercies.
That powerhouse actress Julie
Bovasso (she was John
Travolta's mother in Saturday

Night Fever and Staying Alive,
and the older nurse in Thi.
Verdict) does comic wonders
with the small part of Paul's
sister Frieda, who adopts the
children for a while when the
Isaacsons are in jail, but half of
her performance is inaudible
because Lumet chose to cover
it with a voice-over of one of
Rochelle's letters to Daniel
and Susan. As Rochelle's
crazy, tormented mother, Rita
Zohar makes a striking impres
sion, but she's barely written
into the film at all.
Some highly respected New
York stage actors turn up in
performances that do nothing
to explain their reputations:
lee Richardson (as a New York
Times reporter), Maria Tucci
and John Rubinstein (as
Daniel's foster parents).
Lumet and Doctorow don't
give poor Timothy Hutton any
assistance at all; Daniel is the
starring role, but it's not an ac
ting role, really—it's all on one
slightly preposterous emo
tional note (rage rounding the
corner into sarcasm). Hutton
tries hard to get Daniel's
Jewishness and he's even
developed a lopsided amble
that's right in period, but we
don't understand the point at
which he sets out on his quest
to put his childhood together,
and his cruelty to others
around him (especially Phyllis)
comes across as uncon
scionable and unprovoked.
Rochelle Isaacson doesn't
make sense, either—it's a rags
and-patches role—but Lindsay
Crouse finds the key to acting
it: She plays each scene with
such convincing intensity that,
moment to moment, she
seems to have a deep fix on
the character, and we don't
question the overall scheme
of her performance until the
movie is over. As Paul, Mandy
Patinkin has the two show
piece scenes— one in which he

bursts into a Russian peasant
dance (an idea filmmakers
should have abandoned after
the silent era) and one in
which he visits his kids for the
last time. It's the kind of per
formance you remember, be
cause it has invention and en
ergy, but it lacks a throughline
(though Paul is the best writ
ten character in the film by
far), and often Patinkin
doesn't seem to be connect
ing to anyone or anything else
except the camera. Nothing
he does in the whole movie
matches the way Lindsay
Crouse, leaving her apartment
to speak to the FBI (and not to
return), asks Daniel to fasten
the clasp on her bracelet — an
invitation that expresses an al
most frightening intimacy — or
the way she rushes into the
visitors' room to see her
children, her feet claiming the
right to each inch of space as
she moves toward them.
Perhaps it's partly the
struggle of the good actresses
in this movie to make someth
ing of their performances that
moves us when they are on
screen. Amanda Plummer's
role is dreadfully ill conceived
she's a Cassandra whose de
mented warnings to Daniel
the movie can't cope with, and
so they hang uselessly in the
air. Yet she has an audacious,
crackling strength, even when
she looks so pale that you're
afraid she might vanish while
you watch. And when she
throws her brother a final
over-the-shoulder look and
tells him, obliquely, "They're
still fucking us, Daniel. Get
the picture?," she gives the
word "piqture" a mocking
Jewish intdrv&tion that calls up
the Isaacsons' heritage and
satirizes it at the same time.
This line reading burns
through the whole haunting
mess of a movie — it's brilliant,
just brilliant.
