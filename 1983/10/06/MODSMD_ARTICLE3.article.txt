A Stanford tradition as old as the University itself —
construction sites — resurfaced this fall all over
campus.
The most prominent of these is the Braun Music
Center near Dinkelspiel Auditorium. John Planting,
an administrator in the Music' Department, said if
the project remains on schedule, "we hope to move
in Dec. I."
Planting added that the building was originally
scheduled for completion by the end of the summer
in order to minimize the inconvenience both to stu
dents and to those who will be moving into the
building, but "winter rains just did us in."
Other construction projects in progress include the
Center for Integrated Systems (CIS), the Cardiovas
cular Research Center and the Research Animal
Facilities (RAF).
Roger Carnes, project manager for CIS, said he
anticipated completion of the project "around Octo
ber of next year." But the center, located on
Campus Drive across from the Medical Center, will
not be opened then since it must first go through
"an instrumentation stage," he said.
Funding for CIS is being provided by several
prominent corporations which will "participate in
the research of integrated systems and chips" that
will be conducted in the CIS building, Carnes said.
Funding for the Cardiovascular Research Center is
also being provided by sources outside the Univer
sity. Project manager David Jerome said, "The entire

project is being financed through donors," adding
that the University even collects a "general plant im
provement tax" equivalent to 7 percent of the proj
ect cost to cover its expenses for roads and utilites.
The RAF will be "a single-story underground, con
crete structure" designed to "create a humane envi
ronment (for animals), while being responsive to the
critical issues of animal care . . . (and) productive re
search," according to the RAF project summary
statement.
Keiser said the facilities should be finished by the
fall of next year.
