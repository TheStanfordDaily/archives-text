Fridays at Five
Due to gentle prodding from Resi
dential Education, The Daily will no
longer mention the words happy,
fun, alcohol, beer, wine, gin, tonic,
hour, or Icelandic reindeer in kinky
fishnet stockings. Therefore, if staf
fers come to the offices tomorrow at
5 p.m., they will see none of the
above there. Oh yes, the Chief
wants everyone to show up at 4: JO
for a Special Staff Meeting before
our melancholy Friday at 5.
