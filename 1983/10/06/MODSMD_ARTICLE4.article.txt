## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
Twenty-six experts on nuclear
war-related issues will speak here
this weekend at the Physicians for
Social Responsibility's (PSR)
Prescription for Prevention confer
ence in Memorial Auditorium.
Former C.I.A. Director William
Colby, former PSR President Helen
Caldicott and former Soviet
Academy of Sciences Research Fel
low Alexander Sakharov will high
light the two-day conference on
"Nuclear War — Our Greatest Health
Hazard."
According to PSR President Gary
Lapid, the symposium is intended to
be a "non-political examination of
the greatest public health threat to
mankind. It is an invitation for think
ing people to consider what al
ternatives exist to resolve conflicts
in ways other than military
response."

The conference is based on PSR's
notion that if war begins in the
minds of men it can also end in the
minds of men.
Other conference speakers in
clude Admiral Noel Cayler, former

director of the U.S. National Secur
ity Agency; Sidney Drell, deputy
director of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center; Robert Manoff,
managing editor of Harper's Maga
zine; Robert Hamerton-Kelly, dean

pura, dean of the Medical School;
and University President Donald

A small group of students is plan
ning to pass out leaflets protesting

conference tomorrow morning.
The students complain that Ken
nedy has hypocritically affiliated
himself with an effort to prevent nu
clear war after allowing a weapons
related research project begin at the
Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lab
oratory.

"It's not a protest of the confer
ence. It's a protest of Donald Ken
nedy," said Ross Boylan, one of the
students planning the "low-key"
demonstration.
"We feel he has not played a
helpful role in stopping the arms
race here. He has not supported the
people who don't want to partici
pate in nuclear weapons research.
We don't feel he has been socially
responsible, and that's what this
conference is all about," Boylan
said.
