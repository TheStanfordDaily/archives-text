Walesa wins Peace Prize

Warsaw, Poland â€” Lech Walesa, the mustachioed
Polish electrician whose personal charisma and
negotiating skills propelled him to leadership of the
Soviet Bloc's first independent trade unions, was
awarded the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize yesterday for
his struggle on behalf of workers' rights.
The award, which surprised and angered the
Polish government but delighted supporters of the
since-banned Solidarity union movement, was an
nounced in Oslo, Norway, Where the Norwegian
Nobel committee said it honored the popular Pole
for his "contribution, made with considerable per
sonal sacrifice, to ensure workers' rights to establish
their own organizations."

A jubilant Walesa, who joins dissident Soviet
physicist Andrei Sakharov as the only peace winners
from the East Bloc, learned of his award from
reporters while he was picking mushrooms near his
home in suburban Gdansk, on the Baltic Sea coast.
"I don't regard awards, and especially this one, as
my own," said Walesa, who has been on sick leave
for stomach ulcers. "I consider this for the people."
Walesa added that he will donate the $190,000 to a
fund being organized by the Roman Catholic
Church in Poland to aid private farmers.
About 1000 supporters greeted the stocky unionist
outside his apartment yesterday afternoon as he
returned from his outing. They chanted "Solidarity,"
waved flowers, and raised their hands in victory
signs.
