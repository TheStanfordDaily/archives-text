Walesa wins Peace Prize

Warsaw, Poland — Lech Walesa, the mustachioed
Polish electrician whose personal charisma and
negotiating skills propelled him to leadership of the
Soviet Bloc's first independent trade unions, was
awarded the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize yesterday for
his struggle on behalf of workers' rights.
The award, which surprised and angered the
Polish government but delighted supporters of the
since-banned Solidarity union movement, was an
nounced in Oslo, Norway, Where the Norwegian
Nobel committee said it honored the popular Pole
for his "contribution, made with considerable per
sonal sacrifice, to ensure workers' rights to establish
their own organizations."

A jubilant Walesa, who joins dissident Soviet
physicist Andrei Sakharov as the only peace winners
from the East Bloc, learned of his award from
reporters while he was picking mushrooms near his
home in suburban Gdansk, on the Baltic Sea coast.
"I don't regard awards, and especially this one, as
my own," said Walesa, who has been on sick leave
for stomach ulcers. "I consider this for the people."
Walesa added that he will donate the $190,000 to a
fund being organized by the Roman Catholic
Church in Poland to aid private farmers.
About 1000 supporters greeted the stocky unionist
outside his apartment yesterday afternoon as he
returned from his outing. They chanted "Solidarity,"
waved flowers, and raised their hands in victory
signs.
Soviets assail U.S. in U.N.
United Nations — Virtually ignoring Presiden
Reagan's appeal for negotiation of U.S.-
Soviet differences, the Soviet Union's U.N.
ambassador yesterday delivered a hard-line
speech bristling with anti-American in
vective.
Soviet Ambassador Oleg Troyanovsky's
statement to the U.N. General Assembly
referred only indirectly to Reagan's offer last
week of new U.S. flexibility in the negotia
tions on intermediate-range missiles in
Europe, citing Soviet President Yuri
Andropov's rejection of the idea as a ruse.
If the United States deploys Pershing 2 and
cruise missiles in Western Europe, the Soviet
statement said, "we, of course, will have to
take countermeasures to preserve the bal
ance of forces on both European and global
scale. It is to be hoped that Washington and
other NATO capitals will ponder again and
again the obtaining situation and the grave
consequences which would result from an
other twist in the spiral of the arms race.
Troyanovsky asserted at the outset that
"the forces which are heating up the interna
tional atmosphere to pursue their pathologi
cal ambitions have now sharply intensified
their activity."
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Cromyko
would normally have given the Soviet speech
here but he refused to attend the General As
sembly session after the governors of New
York and New Jersey said they could not
guarantee his safety at local airports. Their
action came during intense U.S. protests
against the Sept. 1 shooting down of a South
Korean airliner by Soviet jets.
Troyanovsky's speech also included a for
mal Soviet proposal for a nuclear weapons
freeze, which he said would stop the buildup
of all nuclear components, including both
delivery vehicles and weapons. He added
that it would renounce the deployment of
new kinds and types of nuclear weapons, es
tablish a moratorium on all tests of new kinds
and types of weapons and stop the produc
tion of fissionable materials for arms use.

Such a freeze, he said, would take place
"under effective verification" but he gave no
details.
Watt resignation imminent
Washington — Interior Secretary James Watt
who left Washington yesterday for a vacation
in California, will resign from office shortly,
administration officials said last night.
One informed official said that the secre
tary, who had breakfast yesterday with White
House Counselor Edwin Meese, plans to
leave his post after an "interim'' period.
This official said that Watt, faced with
rising opposition in the Republican
controlled Senate over remarks he made two
weeks ago about an advisory panel, has
come to the realization that he cannot
remain in office for a few more months, as
had been considered likely by White House
officials last week.
Senate Republicans yesterday warned in
blunt, harshly criticial terms that Watt faces
repudiation in that chamber later this month
unless he resigns.
The bleak assessment of Watt's standing in
the Senate, confirmed by his strongest sup
porter there, Assistant Majority Leader Ted
Stevens (R-Alaska), came as President Reagan
defended the embattled secretary and said
Watt shouldn't be forced out because of a
"stupid remark."
Watt has been in trouble with Senate
Republicans and others since he referred two
weeks ago to members of an advisory com
mission on coal leasing as "a black ... a wo
man, two Jews and a cripple."
Immigration bill bitterness
Washington — Democrats and Republicans
angrily blamed each other yesterday for the
apparent demise of the bill that would make
sweeping changes in the nation's immigra
tion laws, with each party accusing the other
of bad faith and political subterfuge.
Behind the bitter accusations, however,
each side appears relieved at having dodged —
for the time being — the no-win job of coming
up with a new set of laws aimed at curbing
the rising flow of illegal aliens into the United
States.

Both the House and Senate versions of the
bill would set up a system of stitt penalties
against employers who hire illegal aliens,
which critics say would give rise to
widespread employment discrimination
against Latinos.
Among the other emotional issues raised
in the bill were provisions that would grant
amnesty, as well as federal aid, to millions of
illegal aliens now living in the United States.
"It's a horrendous snake pit," conceded
Rep. Leon Panetta (D-Calif.), echoing a senti
ment widely shared on Capitol Hill. But he
added, "To some extend, we're probably
putting our heads in the sand. There will
never be an easy time on legislation like this
... At some point, we'll have to face up to
it."
"When you come down to it, they really
don't want to change the status quo," Sen.
Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), sponsor of the mea
sure in the Senate, said.
Although the bill was the product of more
than five years of bipartisan work — it was
sponsored in the House by Romano Mazzoli
(D-Ky.) — it had drawn loud opposition from
interests that rarely find themselves allied:
liberals, who feared it would violate the civil
liberties of minorities, conservatives, angry
over its costs and the burdens it placed on
employers, farmers, who rely upon an
available, low-cost alien work force to har
vest their crops, and many other groups.
Stocks gain ground
New York — Stock prices gained more
ground yesterday in an advance paced by
blue-chip issues.
Trading was fairly active.
Analysts said traders remained optimistic
about the likely trend of third-quarter ear
nings reports due out over the next few
weeks.
Today's weather
Morning fog or low clouds along the coast
and locally around the Bay, clearing to the
coast by early afternoon. Elsewhere sunny.
Highs from the 60s near the coast to the mid
80s inland.
