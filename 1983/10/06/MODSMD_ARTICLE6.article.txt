# Presidential libraries preserve political history, workers there say
## 
### TAREK HAMADA 
Presidential libraries are valuable
educational centers which teach
scholars and the general public
about U.S. political history, accor
ding to archivists at the seven estab
lished presidential libraries.
The libraries contain millions of
government and personal docu
ments used by thousands of
scholars each year, the archivists
said.
The museums adjoining the libra
ries have educated millions of
people about presidencies, they
added.
The value of presidential libraries
and museums has been debated at
Stanford since President Reagan in
dicated last year that he would like
to establish a Ronald Reagan library,
museum and center for public af
fairs here.
Two University panels are study
ing the proposal. A committee of
Hoover Institute scholars has unani
mously supported inviting Reagan
to locate the library complex here.
Some Stanford students and
professors oppose the complex.
They claim it would glorify the presi
dent and tie the University too
closely to the Reagan administra
tion.
The archivists interviewed by The
Daily are at the following libraries:
The Herbert Hoover Library in West
Branch, Iowa; the Franklin D.
Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, New
York; the Harry S. Truman Library in
Independence, Missouri; the
Dwight D. Eisenhower Library in
Abilene, Kansas; the John F. Ken

nedy Library in Boston; the Lyndon
B. Johnson Library in Austin, Texas;
and the Gerald R. Ford Library in
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The presidential libraries are
owned by the federal government,
which uses private funds to pay for
the operation and maintainence of
the libraries after they are built.
Hoover Library
Bob Wood, assistant director of
the Hoover Library in lowa, said ob
jections to the Reagan library com
plex are unwarranted.
"I think all of the presidential li
braries and museums put the best
foot forward for the particular presi
dent they are devoted to," Wood
said. "But I don't think any of them
put forward falsehoods."
Those opposed to the library com
plex should appreciate the substan
tial resources a presidential library
can bring to a university, he said.
"It seems to me that a presidential
library would enrich the university,
whether people like Reagan or not,"
Wood said.
The 60,000 visitors who tour the
museum adjoining the library each
year see exhibits about what is con
sidered Hoover's biggest failure:
the Great Depression.
"We have a graph that runs across
the museum which shows the un
employment rate and other eco
nomic indicators during Hoover's
administration. The graph shows an
overall pattern of decline â€” there's no
getting around it," Wood said.
Hoover was convinced by Truman
in the late 1950s to establish a library
in Hoover's birthplace, West

Branch, lowa. A private group, the
Herbert Hoover Presidential Library
Association, raised about $2 million
to build the library complex in 1962,
Wood said.
Roosevelt Library
Frances Seeber, senior archivist at
the Roosevelt Library, acknowl
edged that some view presidential
library complexes as monuments to
large egos.
"A presidential library is ded
icated to the person it was named
after. President Roosevelt was very
dominant in the lives of many
people. What we try to do is present
his story as realistically as possible, "
Seeber said.
The library has about 16 million
pages of documents about
Roosevelt. The collection attracts
about 400 researchers each year. An
other 225,000 visitors come to the
museum yearly.
The library complex was built in
1940 for $376,000, with a large
amount of support by Roosevelt. He
donated 16 acres of the Roosevelt
estate for the library complex.
Truman Library
Ben Zobrist, director of the
Truman Library, said the individual
president sets the tone of a
presidential library complex.
Truman made sure the library
never glorified him, Zobrist said.
"We were not allowed to put up a
painting of Truman until after his
death. Truman would not let us sell
