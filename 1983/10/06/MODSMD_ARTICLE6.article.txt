# Presidential libraries preserve political history, workers there say
## 
### TAREK HAMADA 
Presidential libraries are valuable
educational centers which teach
scholars and the general public
about U.S. political history, accor
ding to archivists at the seven estab
lished presidential libraries.
The libraries contain millions of
government and personal docu
ments used by thousands of
scholars each year, the archivists
said.
The museums adjoining the libra
ries have educated millions of
people about presidencies, they
added.
The value of presidential libraries
and museums has been debated at
Stanford since President Reagan in
dicated last year that he would like
to establish a Ronald Reagan library,
museum and center for public af
fairs here.
Two University panels are study
ing the proposal. A committee of
Hoover Institute scholars has unani
mously supported inviting Reagan
to locate the library complex here.
Some Stanford students and
professors oppose the complex.
They claim it would glorify the presi
dent and tie the University too
closely to the Reagan administra
tion.
The archivists interviewed by The
Daily are at the following libraries:
The Herbert Hoover Library in West
Branch, Iowa; the Franklin D.
Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, New
York; the Harry S. Truman Library in
Independence, Missouri; the
Dwight D. Eisenhower Library in
Abilene, Kansas; the John F. Ken

nedy Library in Boston; the Lyndon
B. Johnson Library in Austin, Texas;
and the Gerald R. Ford Library in
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The presidential libraries are
owned by the federal government,
which uses private funds to pay for
the operation and maintainence of
the libraries after they are built.
Hoover Library
Bob Wood, assistant director of
the Hoover Library in lowa, said ob
jections to the Reagan library com
plex are unwarranted.
"I think all of the presidential li
braries and museums put the best
foot forward for the particular presi
dent they are devoted to," Wood
said. "But I don't think any of them
put forward falsehoods."
Those opposed to the library com
plex should appreciate the substan
tial resources a presidential library
can bring to a university, he said.
"It seems to me that a presidential
library would enrich the university,
whether people like Reagan or not,"
Wood said.
The 60,000 visitors who tour the
museum adjoining the library each
year see exhibits about what is con
sidered Hoover's biggest failure:
the Great Depression.
"We have a graph that runs across
the museum which shows the un
employment rate and other eco
nomic indicators during Hoover's
administration. The graph shows an
overall pattern of decline — there's no
getting around it," Wood said.
Hoover was convinced by Truman
in the late 1950s to establish a library
in Hoover's birthplace, West

Branch, lowa. A private group, the
Herbert Hoover Presidential Library
Association, raised about $2 million
to build the library complex in 1962,
Wood said.
Roosevelt Library
Frances Seeber, senior archivist at
the Roosevelt Library, acknowl
edged that some view presidential
library complexes as monuments to
large egos.
"A presidential library is ded
icated to the person it was named
after. President Roosevelt was very
dominant in the lives of many
people. What we try to do is present
his story as realistically as possible, "
Seeber said.
The library has about 16 million
pages of documents about
Roosevelt. The collection attracts
about 400 researchers each year. An
other 225,000 visitors come to the
museum yearly.
The library complex was built in
1940 for $376,000, with a large
amount of support by Roosevelt. He
donated 16 acres of the Roosevelt
estate for the library complex.
Truman Library
Ben Zobrist, director of the
Truman Library, said the individual
president sets the tone of a
presidential library complex.
Truman made sure the library
never glorified him, Zobrist said.
"We were not allowed to put up a
painting of Truman until after his
death. Truman would not let us sell
a biography of him, " he said.
"He never allowed honorary
degrees to be displayed in
public areas of the museum."
The museum does not
glamorize Truman, Zobrist
said. For example, he said, it
has exhibits on Truman's deci
sion to drop atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The library has 13 million
pages of documents about
Truman and his administra
tion. Each year, 400 scholars
visit the library and 200,000
tourists visit the museum.
The library, dedicated in
1957, cost $14 million to build
in Independence, Missouri,
Truman's home town, Zobrist
said.
Eisenhower Library
John Wickman, director of
the Eisenhower Library, said
the library complex is a center
for research and education on
Eisenhower and his genera
tion.
"There really isn't any at
tempt to deify the man,"
Wickman said.
Several important
biographies of Eisenhower
could not have been written
without information from the
library, he said.
Eisenhower was an enthusi
astic supporter of the library
and the museum, Wickman
said. "Eisenhower took an ac
tive role in contacting people
who had been with his admin
istration and getting them to
put their documents in the li
brary."
The library has a collection
of 20 million pages of docu
ments on Eisenhower's years
as president, general, leader
of NATO and president of Co
lumbia University.
Hundreds of scholars visit
the library and 200,000 people
visit the museum each year.
The museum was built in
1954 and the library in 1962.
The buildings cost $7 million,
Wickman said.
Kennedy Library
William lohnson, research
and reference archivist at the
Kennedy Library, said a skilled

staff can prevent a presidential
library from becoming gaudy.
"I am an archivist, an admin
istrator ot historical materials.
Its not my task to glorify
anyone," Johnson said. "It is
my job to administer a library
for the people."
The museum tells visitors
everything about Kennedy's
career, including such embar
rassing moments as the Bay of
Pigs operation, Johnson said.
The library contains about
32 million pages of documents
about Kennedy. Together with
the museum, it attracts 5000
researchers and 300,000
tourists each year.
The library complex was
built at a cost of $15 million in
1979. The Kennedy family has
contributed documents, time
and money to the library, lo
cated at the University of Mas
sachusetts in Boston.
Johnson Library
Charles Corkran, assistant
director of the Johnson Li
brary, said the nation's largest
presidential library complex
has become an integral part of
its home, the University of
Texas at Austin.
The library's 35 million
pages of documents are a very
valuable resource on campus,
Corkran said.
The museum hosts
numerous traveling exhibi
tions and has not shied away
from addressing Johnson's dif
ficult Vietnam War years,
Corkran said.
Johnson supported the li
brary by donating all of his
documents to it, Corkran said.
The library complex and a
building for the Lyndon B.
Johnson School of Public Af
fairs cost $18 million to build
in 1971.
Ford Library
William Stewart, deputy
director of the Ford Library,
said the nation's newest
presidential library is making
rapid progress.
"The library'is active. The
fact that we're on a university
campus makes the library at
tractive and accessible to the
academic community. Our re
sources and visibility will in
crease," Stewart said.
The library is on the campus
of the University of Michigan,

Ford's alma mater, while the
museum is in Grand Rapids,
Michigan, Ford's hometown.
Ford decided to put the
museum in Grand Rapids be
cause he did not want to
ignore his birthplace, Stewart
said.
The library has 14 million
pages of documents on Ford.
The library and the museum
were built at the cost of $4.2
million in 1981.
The Richard Nixon and
limmy Carter Libraries
The libraries have not been
built yet, but plans have been
drawn up for both.
The Nixon Library will be
built in San Clemente, the lo
cation of Nixon's summer
White House and current
residence. Chapman College
will be associated with the li
brary and museum and will
administer a public policy in
stitute on its grounds.
Nixon decided on the San
Clemente site after his pro
posal faced opposition at
Duke University, where Nixon
graduated from law school in
1937.
Several Duke students and
professors objected to the
proposal, arguing it would be
inappropriate for the univer
sity to associate itself with a
president who resigned in a
controversy. The Duke aca
demic council rejected the
proposal at first. But the coun
cil later voted to accept the
proposal if the museum were
located elsewhere.
Nixon had decided to find
another site by the time of the
second vote.
The Carter Library will be
built south of the Emory LJni
versity campus. Construction
of the library complex, which
will include a museum and
public policy center, should
begin this year and end in
1985, said Steve Hochman,
senior research associate of
the newly-formed public
policy center.
The complex will probably
cost $25 million to build, he
added.
The library will have about
27 million pages of documents
about Carter, Hochman said.

Wood said.
The 60,000 visitors who tour the
museum adjoining the library each
year see exhibits about what is con
sidered Hoover's biggest failure:
the Great Depression.
"We have a graph that runs across
the museum which shows the un
employment rate and other eco
nomic indicators during Hoover's
administration. The graph shows an
overall pattern of decline — there's no
getting around it," Wood said.
Hoover was convinced by Truman
in the late 1950s to establish a library
in Hoover's birthplace, West

Branch, lowa. A private group, the
Herbert Hoover Presidential Library
Association, raised about $2 million
to build the library complex in 1962,
Wood said.
Roosevelt Library
Frances Seeber, senior archivist at
the Roosevelt Library, acknowl
edged that some view presidential
library complexes as monuments to
large egos.
"A presidential library is ded
icated to the person it was named
after. President Roosevelt was very
dominant in the lives of many
people. What we try to do is present
his story as realistically as possible, "
Seeber said.
The library has about 16 million
pages of documents about
Roosevelt. The collection attracts
about 400 researchers each year. An
other 225,000 visitors come to the
museum yearly.
The library complex was built in
1940 for $376,000, with a large
amount of support by Roosevelt. He
donated 16 acres of the Roosevelt
estate for the library complex.
Truman Library
Ben Zobrist, director of the
Truman Library, said the individual
president sets the tone of a
presidential library complex.
Truman made sure the library
never glorified him, Zobrist said.
"We were not allowed to put up a
painting of Truman until after his
death. Truman would not let us sell
a biography of him, " he said.
"He never allowed honorary
degrees to be displayed in
public areas of the museum."
The museum does not
glamorize Truman, Zobrist
said. For example, he said, it
has exhibits on Truman's deci
sion to drop atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The library has 13 million
pages of documents about
Truman and his administra
tion. Each year, 400 scholars
visit the library and 200,000
tourists visit the museum.
The library, dedicated in
1957, cost $14 million to build
in Independence, Missouri,
Truman's home town, Zobrist
said.
Eisenhower Library
John Wickman, director of
the Eisenhower Library, said
the library complex is a center
for research and education on
Eisenhower and his genera
tion.
"There really isn't any at
tempt to deify the man,"
Wickman said.
Several important
biographies of Eisenhower
could not have been written
without information from the
library, he said.
Eisenhower was an enthusi
astic supporter of the library
and the museum, Wickman
said. "Eisenhower took an ac
tive role in contacting people
who had been with his admin
istration and getting them to
put their documents in the li
brary."
The library has a collection
of 20 million pages of docu
ments on Eisenhower's years
as president, general, leader
of NATO and president of Co
lumbia University.
Hundreds of scholars visit
the library and 200,000 people
visit the museum each year.
The museum was built in
1954 and the library in 1962.
The buildings cost $7 million,
Wickman said.
Kennedy Library
William lohnson, research
and reference archivist at the
Kennedy Library, said a skilled

staff can prevent a presidential
library from becoming gaudy.
"I am an archivist, an admin
istrator ot historical materials.
Its not my task to glorify
anyone," Johnson said. "It is
my job to administer a library
for the people."
The museum tells visitors
everything about Kennedy's
career, including such embar
rassing moments as the Bay of
Pigs operation, Johnson said.
The library contains about
32 million pages of documents
about Kennedy. Together with
the museum, it attracts 5000
researchers and 300,000
tourists each year.
The library complex was
built at a cost of $15 million in
1979. The Kennedy family has
contributed documents, time
and money to the library, lo
cated at the University of Mas
sachusetts in Boston.
Johnson Library
Charles Corkran, assistant
director of the Johnson Li
brary, said the nation's largest
presidential library complex
has become an integral part of
its home, the University of
Texas at Austin.
The library's 35 million
pages of documents are a very
valuable resource on campus,
Corkran said.
The museum hosts
numerous traveling exhibi
tions and has not shied away
from addressing Johnson's dif
ficult Vietnam War years,
Corkran said.
Johnson supported the li
brary by donating all of his
documents to it, Corkran said.
The library complex and a
building for the Lyndon B.
Johnson School of Public Af
fairs cost $18 million to build
in 1971.
Ford Library
William Stewart, deputy
director of the Ford Library,
said the nation's newest
presidential library is making
rapid progress.
"The library'is active. The
fact that we're on a university
campus makes the library at
tractive and accessible to the
academic community. Our re
sources and visibility will in
crease," Stewart said.
The library is on the campus
of the University of Michigan,

Ford's alma mater, while the
museum is in Grand Rapids,
Michigan, Ford's hometown.
Ford decided to put the
museum in Grand Rapids be
cause he did not want to
ignore his birthplace, Stewart
said.
The library has 14 million
pages of documents on Ford.
The library and the museum
were built at the cost of $4.2
million in 1981.
The Richard Nixon and
limmy Carter Libraries
The libraries have not been
built yet, but plans have been
drawn up for both.
The Nixon Library will be
built in San Clemente, the lo
cation of Nixon's summer
White House and current
residence. Chapman College
will be associated with the li
brary and museum and will
administer a public policy in
stitute on its grounds.
Nixon decided on the San
Clemente site after his pro
posal faced opposition at
Duke University, where Nixon
graduated from law school in
1937.
Several Duke students and
professors objected to the
proposal, arguing it would be
inappropriate for the univer
sity to associate itself with a
president who resigned in a
controversy. The Duke aca
demic council rejected the
proposal at first. But the coun
cil later voted to accept the
proposal if the museum were
located elsewhere.
Nixon had decided to find
another site by the time of the
second vote.
The Carter Library will be
built south of the Emory LJni
versity campus. Construction
of the library complex, which
will include a museum and
public policy center, should
begin this year and end in
1985, said Steve Hochman,
senior research associate of
the newly-formed public
policy center.
The complex will probably
cost $25 million to build, he
added.
The library will have about
27 million pages of documents
about Carter, Hochman said.
Presidential libraries are valuable
educational centers which teach
scholars and the general public
about U.S. political history, accor
ding to archivists at the seven estab
lished presidential libraries.
The libraries contain millions of
government and personal docu
ments used by thousands of
scholars each year, the archivists
said.
The museums adjoining the libra
ries have educated millions of
people about presidencies, they
added.
The value of presidential libraries
and museums has been debated at
Stanford since President Reagan in
dicated last year that he would like
to establish a Ronald Reagan library,
museum and center for public af
fairs here.
Two University panels are study
ing the proposal. A committee of
Hoover Institute scholars has unani
mously supported inviting Reagan
to locate the library complex here.
Some Stanford students and
professors oppose the complex.
They claim it would glorify the presi
dent and tie the University too
closely to the Reagan administra
tion.
The archivists interviewed by The
Daily are at the following libraries:
The Herbert Hoover Library in West
Branch, Iowa; the Franklin D.
Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, New
York; the Harry S. Truman Library in
Independence, Missouri; the
Dwight D. Eisenhower Library in
Abilene, Kansas; the John F. Ken

nedy Library in Boston; the Lyndon
B. Johnson Library in Austin, Texas;
and the Gerald R. Ford Library in
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The presidential libraries are
owned by the federal government,
which uses private funds to pay for
the operation and maintainence of
the libraries after they are built.
Hoover Library
Bob Wood, assistant director of
the Hoover Library in lowa, said ob
jections to the Reagan library com
plex are unwarranted.
"I think all of the presidential li
braries and museums put the best
foot forward for the particular presi
dent they are devoted to," Wood
said. "But I don't think any of them
put forward falsehoods."
Those opposed to the library com
plex should appreciate the substan
tial resources a presidential library
can bring to a university, he said.

Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The library has 13 million
pages of documents about
Truman and his administra
tion. Each year, 400 scholars
visit the library and 200,000
tourists visit the museum.
The library, dedicated in
1957, cost $14 million to build
in Independence, Missouri,
Truman's home town, Zobrist
said.
Eisenhower Library
John Wickman, director of
the Eisenhower Library, said
the library complex is a center
for research and education on
Eisenhower and his genera
tion.
"There really isn't any at
tempt to deify the man,"
Wickman said.
Several important
biographies of Eisenhower
could not have been written
without information from the
library, he said.
Eisenhower was an enthusi
astic supporter of the library
and the museum, Wickman
said. "Eisenhower took an ac
tive role in contacting people
who had been with his admin
istration and getting them to
put their documents in the li
brary."
The library has a collection
of 20 million pages of docu
ments on Eisenhower's years
as president, general, leader
of NATO and president of Co
lumbia University.
Hundreds of scholars visit
the library and 200,000 people
visit the museum each year.
The museum was built in
1954 and the library in 1962.
The buildings cost $7 million,
Wickman said.
Kennedy Library
William lohnson, research
and reference archivist at the
Kennedy Library, said a skilled

staff can prevent a presidential
library from becoming gaudy.
"I am an archivist, an admin
istrator ot historical materials.
Its not my task to glorify
anyone," Johnson said. "It is
my job to administer a library
for the people."
The museum tells visitors
everything about Kennedy's
career, including such embar
rassing moments as the Bay of
Pigs operation, Johnson said.
The library contains about
32 million pages of documents
about Kennedy. Together with
the museum, it attracts 5000
researchers and 300,000
tourists each year.
The library complex was
built at a cost of $15 million in
1979. The Kennedy family has
contributed documents, time
and money to the library, lo
cated at the University of Mas
sachusetts in Boston.
Johnson Library
Charles Corkran, assistant
director of the Johnson Li
brary, said the nation's largest
presidential library complex
has become an integral part of
its home, the University of
Texas at Austin.
The library's 35 million
pages of documents are a very
valuable resource on campus,
Corkran said.
The museum hosts
numerous traveling exhibi
tions and has not shied away
from addressing Johnson's dif
ficult Vietnam War years,
Corkran said.
Johnson supported the li
brary by donating all of his
documents to it, Corkran said.
The library complex and a
building for the Lyndon B.
Johnson School of Public Af
fairs cost $18 million to build
in 1971.
Ford Library
William Stewart, deputy
director of the Ford Library,
said the nation's newest
presidential library is making
rapid progress.
"The library'is active. The
fact that we're on a university
campus makes the library at
tractive and accessible to the
academic community. Our re
sources and visibility will in
crease," Stewart said.
The library is on the campus
of the University of Michigan,

Ford's alma mater, while the
museum is in Grand Rapids,
Michigan, Ford's hometown.
Ford decided to put the
museum in Grand Rapids be
cause he did not want to
ignore his birthplace, Stewart
said.
The library has 14 million
pages of documents on Ford.
The library and the museum
were built at the cost of $4.2
million in 1981.
The Richard Nixon and
limmy Carter Libraries
The libraries have not been
built yet, but plans have been
drawn up for both.
The Nixon Library will be
built in San Clemente, the lo
cation of Nixon's summer
White House and current
residence. Chapman College
will be associated with the li
brary and museum and will
administer a public policy in
stitute on its grounds.
Nixon decided on the San
Clemente site after his pro
posal faced opposition at
Duke University, where Nixon
graduated from law school in
1937.
Several Duke students and
professors objected to the
proposal, arguing it would be
inappropriate for the univer
sity to associate itself with a
president who resigned in a
controversy. The Duke aca
demic council rejected the
proposal at first. But the coun
cil later voted to accept the
proposal if the museum were
located elsewhere.
Nixon had decided to find
another site by the time of the
second vote.
The Carter Library will be
built south of the Emory LJni
versity campus. Construction
of the library complex, which
will include a museum and
public policy center, should
begin this year and end in
1985, said Steve Hochman,
senior research associate of
the newly-formed public
policy center.
The complex will probably
cost $25 million to build, he
added.
The library will have about
27 million pages of documents
about Carter, Hochman said.
Presidential libraries are valuable
educational centers which teach
scholars and the general public
about U.S. political history, accor
ding to archivists at the seven estab
lished presidential libraries.
The libraries contain millions of
government and personal docu
ments used by thousands of
scholars each year, the archivists
said.
The museums adjoining the libra
ries have educated millions of
people about presidencies, they
added.
The value of presidential libraries
and museums has been debated at
Stanford since President Reagan in
dicated last year that he would like
to establish a Ronald Reagan library,
museum and center for public af
fairs here.
Two University panels are study
ing the proposal. A committee of
Hoover Institute scholars has unani
mously supported inviting Reagan
to locate the library complex here.
Some Stanford students and
professors oppose the complex.
They claim it would glorify the presi
dent and tie the University too
closely to the Reagan administra
tion.
The archivists interviewed by The
Daily are at the following libraries:
The Herbert Hoover Library in West
Branch, Iowa; the Franklin D.
Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, New
York; the Harry S. Truman Library in
Independence, Missouri; the
Dwight D. Eisenhower Library in
Abilene, Kansas; the John F. Ken

nedy Library in Boston; the Lyndon
B. Johnson Library in Austin, Texas;
and the Gerald R. Ford Library in
Ann Arbor, Michigan.
The presidential libraries are
owned by the federal government,
which uses private funds to pay for
the operation and maintainence of
the libraries after they are built.
Hoover Library
Bob Wood, assistant director of
the Hoover Library in lowa, said ob
jections to the Reagan library com
plex are unwarranted.
"I think all of the presidential li
braries and museums put the best
foot forward for the particular presi
dent they are devoted to," Wood
said. "But I don't think any of them
put forward falsehoods."
Those opposed to the library com
plex should appreciate the substan
tial resources a presidential library
can bring to a university, he said.
"It seems to me that a presidential
library would enrich the university,
whether people like Reagan or not,"
Wood said.
The 60,000 visitors who tour the
museum adjoining the library each
year see exhibits about what is con
sidered Hoover's biggest failure:
the Great Depression.
"We have a graph that runs across
the museum which shows the un
employment rate and other eco
nomic indicators during Hoover's
administration. The graph shows an
overall pattern of decline — there's no
getting around it," Wood said.
Hoover was convinced by Truman
in the late 1950s to establish a library
in Hoover's birthplace, West

Branch, lowa. A private group, the
Herbert Hoover Presidential Library
Association, raised about $2 million
to build the library complex in 1962,
Wood said.
Roosevelt Library
Frances Seeber, senior archivist at
the Roosevelt Library, acknowl
edged that some view presidential
library complexes as monuments to
large egos.
"A presidential library is ded
icated to the person it was named
after. President Roosevelt was very
dominant in the lives of many
people. What we try to do is present
his story as realistically as possible, "
Seeber said.
The library has about 16 million
pages of documents about
Roosevelt. The collection attracts
about 400 researchers each year. An
other 225,000 visitors come to the
museum yearly.
The library complex was built in
1940 for $376,000, with a large
amount of support by Roosevelt. He
donated 16 acres of the Roosevelt
estate for the library complex.
Truman Library
Ben Zobrist, director of the
Truman Library, said the individual
president sets the tone of a
presidential library complex.
Truman made sure the library
never glorified him, Zobrist said.
"We were not allowed to put up a
painting of Truman until after his
death. Truman would not let us sell
a biography of him, " he said.
"He never allowed honorary
degrees to be displayed in
public areas of the museum."
The museum does not
glamorize Truman, Zobrist
said. For example, he said, it
has exhibits on Truman's deci
sion to drop atomic bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The library has 13 million
pages of documents about
Truman and his administra
tion. Each year, 400 scholars
visit the library and 200,000
tourists visit the museum.
