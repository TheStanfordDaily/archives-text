## GSB construction plan in millions 
### VALERIE CRITES 
Finding that it has out
grown its current tacilities,
the Graduate School of
Business has begun plan
ning a $12 to $15 million
building to supplement its
existing four-story building
on campus.
The Board of Trustees
recently approved the con
cept of an additional build
ing for the school, thus
opening the way for the
planning process to
proceed.
Architectural planning
for the building will begin
shortly; also to be worked
out is funding for the
venture.
Richard Kurovsky, direc
tor of news and publica
tions for the school, said,
"We are still in the early
stages of an ongoing
process to finalize the
details of the architectural
specifics of the building, as
well as the methods of fun
ding we will employ for the
project. These details will

come into shape toward
spring this year."
The actual site for the
building, which will contain
approximately 40,000 to
50,000 gross square feet,
has not yet been deter
mined. It will probably be
located near the site of the
existing facility. It is sched
uled to be completed in the
spring of 1987.
The new building is ex
pected to become a focal
point for the school's Exec
utive Program, an eight
week program designed to
advance the professional
capabilities of senior-level
managers, and a series of
two-week programs cover
ing financial management,
marketing management,
management of organiza
tional change, and manage
ment of smaller companies.
The new facility will ac
comodate increases in the
size of the student body,
faculty and staff that have
occurred since the CSB

building was completed in
1966. It will contain a mini
mum of 45 offices for fac
ulty members, a total of 50
to 60 private offices, a num
ber of classrooms and
lecture halls of varying sizp
and function, and space for
support activities and
storage.
The new building is ex
pected to meet the space
needs for a planned expan
sion in the size of the fac
ulty over the next five to 10
years.
The need for additional
faculty space has become
critical: The 125 current fac
ulty members, including
regular, part-time, visiting
and retired/emeriti profes
sors, are housed in a facility
that was built to handle
only 86.
Current projections cite
the need for 140 faculty
offices by 1993, and offices
for support staff are also far
below the projected need.
The existing CSB build
ing has been modified

several times since its com
pletion in order to keep
pace with the growth of the
school. Recent alterations
have included the addition
of a third floor to the Jack
son Business Library, major
remodeling of the library's
first and second floors and
expansion of the school's
lower lounge.
In addition, some of the
overcrowding of the facility
was temporarily alleviated
by the addition of 4000
square feet of modular
space two years ago. Adja
cent to the CSB building,
the modulars house the
school's Office of Career
Planning and Placement
and study spaces for doc
toral students.
Plans call for the
modulars to be removed
when the new building is
completed. The offices cur
rently using the modwlars
will be relocated in either
the existing or new build
ing.
