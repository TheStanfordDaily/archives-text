# Professor predicts slowing of Mexican growth rate

### LARRY GREEN 
A Stanford professor has forecast a sharp
decline in Mexico's population growth rate,
disputing the common belief that the nation's
population will double by the year 2000.
Prof. Dudley Kirk of the Food Research In
stitute predicts that Mexico's population may
only grow by 50 to 60 percent by the turn of the
century, making a population of 25 to 30 million
less than most published predictions.
Kirk, in a recently-published paper entitled
"Recent Demographic Trends and Present
Population Prospects for Mexico," writes that
family planning and rapid urbanization may
help to keep the growth rate down.
Contraceptive "use has become more com
mon in Mexico since the government declared
its support for family planning in 1973 and in
troduced a coordinated plan in 1977. Use in
creased by 9 percent between 1977 and 1979
among women aged 15 to 44 who were married
or living in unions, Kirk said.
Pointing to the fact that Mexico's economy is
improving and urbanization is accelerating
rapidly, Kirk said the birth rate will continue to
fall steadily because "urban areas have lower
birth rates: children are not as valuable as in
rural areas."
Kirk believes immigration will also be a (ac
tor.
"Although it is extremely hard to know, I es
timate that two million migrants will enter the
U.S. by the year 2000," he said. "Many will have

children in the States." This would mean that a
substantial portion of Mexico's future popula
tion would he removed.
Other estimates tend to downplay the migra
tion effect, Kirk said.
"Migration, illegal aliens entering the U.S.,
will continue to be a problem,'' he said. "The
differences in wages, for instance, between
Tijuana and Mexico could be three times as
much."
Kirk stresses that Mexico's birth rate is drop
ping steadily. From 1971 to 1982, the number of
persons per family dropped from 6.7 to -4.1
Kirk said he predicts "there will be an average
of 2.8 persons per family in Mexico by 2000.''
Kirk pointed out that if the rate continues to
fall there will be "less pressure for immigra
tion."
It Kirk's predictions are correct, Mexico will
be blessed with lower food requirements, and
have fewer problems allocating tunds for edu
cation, health and public services.
"It I am right, it will be both good and bad tor
Mexico," Kirk said. "Since it is such a young
population now, there will be more working
aged people by 2000, and there will be a severe
need for jobs."
Living standards, though, are apparently im
proving in Mexico. However, Kirk still stressed
the importance of American aid to Mexico.
"They have so tar to go. . .1 think we have a
real obligation to help them," he said.
