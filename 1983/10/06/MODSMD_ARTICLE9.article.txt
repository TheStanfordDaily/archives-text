### MIKE MAZARR 
The Stanford football team is
a much-maligned organization
today.
Since its Rose Bowl victories
in the early 19705, the team
has been in a state of slow but
constant decline. Only the
outstanding performances of

individual players such as
quarterback John Elway have
kept the program healthy. This
season, many fans would con
sider the Cardinal lucky if it
could manage to win a game;
even the Band is being
penalized.
Yet Stanford retains its at

traction as an excellent school
tor quarterbacks and
receivers, providing experi
ence in a pro-style offense as
well as a good academic pro
gram. As such, Stanford at
tracts some of the finest high
school prospects in the na
tion, especially at the skill
positions of quarterback and
receiver.
But even at Stanford, the
promise of talented youth and
the promises of a high
powered recruiter are not al
ways borne out. On the Stan
ford football team, even less
than-sparkling careers can be
rewarding.
During his senior year of
high school, it must have
seemed to quarterback Fred
Buckley that he had the world
in his pocket. In the course of
the year he threw 19 touch
down passes for his Florida
high school team, completing
59 percent of his throws for a
total of almost 2000 yards-stats
which earned him a ranking as
the top high school quarter
back in the United States.
National Football League
greats Roger Staubach and Joe
Namath called Buckley, pitch
ing some of the many colleges
that wanted him. But despite
the presence of Elway, Buck
ley chose Stanford as the place
to develop his football talents.
Don Lonsinger, while he
played for a team which didn't
pass very much and wasn't
very effective when it did,
compiled impressive receiving
numbers in high school and
was recruited by a number of
colleges. Stanford recruited
him only lightly, but he was
impressed with the pro-style
offense and wide-open pas
sing game, so he enrolled and

received a football scholar
ship.
Buckley and Lonsinger are
examples of the sort of hiyh
school players Stanford draws
talented, highly recruited, in
telligent. But unlike many
others, they demonstrate what
happens when a promising
football career goes awry.

'Sure, it's
disappointing to
me. But I came
back here to have
some fun and to
help the team in
any way I can.
That's my only
goal/

Buckley was struck with a
viral infection before his fresh
man year, an illness which, he
says, took a full year to run its
course. Elway was cast in gold
at the quarterback spot until
the current season, and now
another freshman sensation,
John Paye, has arrived to vie
for the starting job.
Buckley is as high as third
string now only because Greg
Topp transferred out from in
front of him.
After an initial breaking-in
period, Lonsinger started four
games two years ago, badly
pulled a hamstring, and has
been on the bench ever since,
watching Emile Harry take
over the split-end duties.
One would expect these
men, whose football careers
have been temporarily side
tracked if not completely un
dermined, to be depressed,
angry, resentful.
They say they are not.
"Sure, it's disappointing to
me," Lonsinger admits. "But I
came back here (to the team)
to have some fun and to help
the team in any way I can.
That's my only goal."

Buckley said, "Even if I had
no chance at starting, I'd stay
on the team. Being a quarter
back or receiver at Stanford,
we could jump in anywhere
(and play). Stanford is the
prep school for quarterbacks
and receivers. I didn't come
here solely for the football."
Buckley reflects the attitude
that most Stanford football
players take to the game: It is
fun and can be rewarding both
athletically and perhaps finan
cially, but the main purpose of
attending Stanford is to obtain
an education. "I've never
thought of myself exclusively
as a football player," he said.
"I've always been raised to go
to a good academic school."
Academics aside, the com
mitment these — and other —
football players make is huge.
Quarterbacks such as Buckley
are involved daily in practice
and meetings from noon until
after dinner — almost 8 p.m.;
other players work from 1 to 8
p.m. Seven or eight hours on
the football field and in train
ing rooms do not fit well with
the demands of Stanford
classes.
By playing football,
Lonsinger counters, he learns
a sense of dedication and
teamwork and makes impor
tant contacts. "The people
you meet — alumni and so on -
are really fantastic. You make
some contacts you wouldn't
make anywhere else. The
alumni are great; the people
who support me, my alumni,
have been friends both when I
started and now that I'm not."
Nevertheless, the long
practices, the double
sessions, grueling summer
training, complex plays and
long hours watching films

must surely tax the patience of
even the most dedicated foot
ball player. They taxed the pa
tience of Greg Topp, and he is
now at Cal State San Diego.
"Greg left because he
definitely wanted a shot at the
pros and he thought he

wouldn't get that playing
third-string here," Lonsinger
explains.
Lonsinger said that he's
"never considered transfer
ring. I'm happy here. I wasn't
highly recruited by Stanford,
but I was by other schools. If I
had gone only for football, I'd
have gone somewhere else.

'I've never
thought of myself
exclusively as a
football player.
I've always been
raised to go to a
good academic
school/

But I like it here; I can't say I
regret anything."
Buckley concurs. "The train
ing you get as a backup here is
much better than you would
get starting at a mediocre foot
ball school."
As for the future, Lonsinger

is a fifth-year senior who will
probably never start a game.
And while he supports the
team in practice and on the
sidelines, he is completing a
double-major in economics
and human biology.
Buckley has three years
eligibility left, and he intends
to use them to the best advan
tage. "I feel fine now. I've got
the mental part of my game to
gether, and I'm in good
shape."
What about the starting
quarterback spot? Buckley
said, "I've got three years left.
A lot of funny things can hap
pen. Look at (49er quarter
back) Joe Montana — he didn't
start until half way through his
senior year, and look where
he is now."
If such intangibles as player
dedication, academic stand
ing, calibre of training or ob
jectivity could win football
games, Stanford, while it still
probably wouldn't quite get to
the Rose Bowl, might play in a
Tangerine Bowl or two. Games
are won and lost, however, by
tough defenses and sustained
offensive drives, all of which
have been in short supply for
the Cardinal this year. But the
players know pride in a foot
ball team can originate in
things beside a win-loss
record.

PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT: Although Fred Buckley ma\
throw a lot of passes in practice, as third-string quarterback
it's unlikely he'll get to use his skills in many games this
season.
The Stanford football team is
a much-maligned organization
today.
Since its Rose Bowl victories
in the early 19705, the team
has been in a state of slow but
constant decline. Only the
outstanding performances of

individual players such as
quarterback John Elway have
kept the program healthy. This
season, many fans would con
sider the Cardinal lucky if it
could manage to win a game;
even the Band is being
penalized.
Yet Stanford retains its at

traction as an excellent school
tor quarterbacks and
receivers, providing experi
ence in a pro-style offense as
well as a good academic pro
gram. As such, Stanford at
tracts some of the finest high
school prospects in the na
tion, especially at the skill
positions of quarterback and
receiver.
But even at Stanford, the
promise of talented youth and
the promises of a high
powered recruiter are not al
ways borne out. On the Stan
ford football team, even less
than-sparkling careers can be
rewarding.
During his senior year of
high school, it must have
seemed to quarterback Fred
Buckley that he had the world
in his pocket. In the course of
the year he threw 19 touch
down passes for his Florida
high school team, completing
59 percent of his throws for a
total of almost 2000 yards-stats
which earned him a ranking as
the top high school quarter
back in the United States.
National Football League
greats Roger Staubach and Joe
Namath called Buckley, pitch
ing some of the many colleges
that wanted him. But despite
the presence of Elway, Buck
ley chose Stanford as the place
to develop his football talents.
Don Lonsinger, while he
played for a team which didn't
pass very much and wasn't
very effective when it did,
compiled impressive receiving
numbers in high school and
was recruited by a number of
colleges. Stanford recruited
him only lightly, but he was
impressed with the pro-style
offense and wide-open pas
sing game, so he enrolled and

received a football scholar
ship.
Buckley and Lonsinger are
examples of the sort of hiyh
school players Stanford draws
talented, highly recruited, in
telligent. But unlike many
others, they demonstrate what
happens when a promising
football career goes awry.

'Sure, it's
disappointing to
me. But I came
back here to have
some fun and to
help the team in
any way I can.
That's my only
goal/

Buckley was struck with a
viral infection before his fresh
man year, an illness which, he
says, took a full year to run its
course. Elway was cast in gold
at the quarterback spot until
the current season, and now
another freshman sensation,
John Paye, has arrived to vie
for the starting job.
Buckley is as high as third
string now only because Greg
Topp transferred out from in
front of him.
After an initial breaking-in
period, Lonsinger started four
games two years ago, badly
pulled a hamstring, and has
been on the bench ever since,
watching Emile Harry take
over the split-end duties.
One would expect these
men, whose football careers
have been temporarily side
tracked if not completely un
dermined, to be depressed,
angry, resentful.
They say they are not.
"Sure, it's disappointing to
me," Lonsinger admits. "But I
came back here (to the team)
to have some fun and to help
the team in any way I can.
That's my only goal."

Buckley said, "Even if I had
no chance at starting, I'd stay
on the team. Being a quarter
back or receiver at Stanford,
we could jump in anywhere
(and play). Stanford is the
prep school for quarterbacks
and receivers. I didn't come
here solely for the football."
Buckley reflects the attitude
that most Stanford football
players take to the game: It is
fun and can be rewarding both
athletically and perhaps finan
cially, but the main purpose of
attending Stanford is to obtain
an education. "I've never
thought of myself exclusively
as a football player," he said.
"I've always been raised to go
to a good academic school."
Academics aside, the com
mitment these — and other —
football players make is huge.
Quarterbacks such as Buckley
are involved daily in practice
and meetings from noon until
after dinner — almost 8 p.m.;
other players work from 1 to 8
p.m. Seven or eight hours on
the football field and in train
ing rooms do not fit well with
the demands of Stanford
classes.
By playing football,
Lonsinger counters, he learns
a sense of dedication and
teamwork and makes impor
tant contacts. "The people
you meet — alumni and so on -
are really fantastic. You make
some contacts you wouldn't
make anywhere else. The
alumni are great; the people
who support me, my alumni,
have been friends both when I
started and now that I'm not."
Nevertheless, the long
practices, the double
sessions, grueling summer
training, complex plays and
long hours watching films

must surely tax the patience of
even the most dedicated foot
ball player. They taxed the pa
tience of Greg Topp, and he is
now at Cal State San Diego.
"Greg left because he
definitely wanted a shot at the
pros and he thought he

wouldn't get that playing
third-string here," Lonsinger
explains.
Lonsinger said that he's
"never considered transfer
ring. I'm happy here. I wasn't
highly recruited by Stanford,
but I was by other schools. If I
had gone only for football, I'd
have gone somewhere else.

'I've never
thought of myself
exclusively as a
football player.
I've always been
raised to go to a
good academic
school/

But I like it here; I can't say I
regret anything."
Buckley concurs. "The train
ing you get as a backup here is
much better than you would
get starting at a mediocre foot
ball school."
As for the future, Lonsinger

is a fifth-year senior who will
probably never start a game.
And while he supports the
team in practice and on the
sidelines, he is completing a
double-major in economics
and human biology.
Buckley has three years
eligibility left, and he intends
to use them to the best advan
tage. "I feel fine now. I've got
the mental part of my game to
gether, and I'm in good
shape."
What about the starting
quarterback spot? Buckley
said, "I've got three years left.
A lot of funny things can hap
pen. Look at (49er quarter
back) Joe Montana — he didn't
start until half way through his
senior year, and look where
he is now."
If such intangibles as player
dedication, academic stand
ing, calibre of training or ob
jectivity could win football
games, Stanford, while it still
probably wouldn't quite get to
the Rose Bowl, might play in a
Tangerine Bowl or two. Games
are won and lost, however, by
tough defenses and sustained
offensive drives, all of which
have been in short supply for
the Cardinal this year. But the
players know pride in a foot
ball team can originate in
things beside a win-loss
record.
