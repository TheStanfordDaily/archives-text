# Faculty pressed to open senate sessions
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior staff writer 
Acting on the request of Tim
Clark, Palo Alto Weekly editor, the
Steering Committee of the Faculty
Senate has undertaken a review of
the senate's policy which prohibits
all media from its meetings except
The Daily, K/SU and the Senate In
formation Officer.
At a meeting Wednesday, the
Steering Committee decided to ask
for the opinion of individual
senators on the matter at the sen
ate's next meeting Oct. 13, and it
will probably decide on the issue at
its next meeting Oct. 19, according
to Academic Secretary Clara Bush.
Clark protested the policy in a
June 20 letter to Bush after he was
barred from the senate meeting last
May which approved the investiga
tion of the Hoover Institution. Clark
also asked to attend the Sept. 29
senate meeting which discussed the
proposed Reagan library, but his re
quest was denied.

The Los Angeles Times, The New
York Times and The Washington
Post also requested to attend the
faculty Senate meeting on thr
Hoover investigation, hut all were
denied access.
The issues discussed at Faculty
Senate meetings are "ot interest to
people off the campus," and a more
open media policy would be of
benefit to the broader public and
the Faculty Senate itself," Clark said.
At present, Clark depends on the
reporting of Senate Information Of
ficer Bob Beyers in the Campus
Report and on The Daily for infor
mation, but he would like "to be
able to cover those (meetings)
firsthand."
The Steering Committee of the
Faculty Senate postponed a decision
Wednesday on whether to allow
media from outside the Stanford
community to attend senate
meetings and instead plans to ask
individual senators for their views
on the issue at a meeting of the full
Senate on October 13.
Robert Freelen, vice-president for
public affairs, who with Beyers was
asked to comment on the proposed
rules change at the Wednesday
Steering Committee meeting, said
that "I think the current policy
makes a lot of sense." Reports on
meetings are released in a "timely
and accurate way," he said, and he
has received no complaints on the
coverage of meetings. Thus, the sys
tem has in his view "worked well"
and he sees no reason to change it.
If the policy were changed, he
continued, relatively inconsistent
coverage of the Faculty Senate
would result because the people
who cover the meetings need a
"sense of context of the Senate and
the University" and can only obtain
this context by covering all the
meetings, and not just the important
ones.
Beyers, who admits that he has a
"built-in conflict ot interest" by
virtue of his position as both Senate
Information Officer and Director of
the News and Publications News
Service, does not "think the effects

of increased coverage will be that
severe," but he did comment that
increased media exposure could
"impact on the quality of discus
sion" at meetings and would also
lead to problems with the limited
space in the Law School room where
the senate now meets.
Craig Heller, chair of the faculty
senate and a professor of biological
sciences, also said that continuity
would be a problem in the reporting
of senate meetings by outside news
agencies.
"They (campus media) under
stand the context of the senate," he
said, and "in terms of the University
community there is coverage
of the Senate." However, he added
that "we are all in favor of open
ness," even though the Steering
Committee was unable to reach
agreement on a specific media
policy.
Clark disputed the idea of conti
nuity, saying that it leads to a policy
whereby "you can't cover any
meeting because you don't cover
all." He refused to state that his
paper would cover every meeting,
but he did say that "it is likely that
we'll be there on a regular basis."
Academic Secretary Bush also
called for more openness in Faculty
Senate meetings, but said she is
"aware also of problems" which
would be caused by a more open
press policy.
"Everybody recognizes that that
(opening senate meetings) would
be the ideal," but she mentioned
four problems, discussed at the
Wednesday Steering Committee
meeting, which could arise from this
policy:
Seating problems, both because
of the size of the room where the
Senate currently meets and because
professors have first call on seats.
The senate might function differ
ently with of the press in
attendance. "They don't want to see
a variable introduced that might
change the way the body func
tions," Bush said.
.Fear on the part of the committee
members that the media might
prove distractive to the meeting;
and
.The problem as to what to do
with various types of media, such as
print, radio and television.
However, she did say that "no
serious consideration was given to
allowing the impediment of TV
cameras" in the meeting room.
A suggestion to open meetings to
outside media on a trial basis with
ground rules proposed by the sen
ate information officer and ap
proved by either the senate chair,
the steering committee or the full
senate has been proposed by
Beyers and was tentatively agreed to
by Clark in an Oct. 5 letter to Bush.
However, Bush said that the steer
ing committee "as a whole is ambi
valent" on the issue, and had thus
deferred to individual senators for
their feelings on the matter because
committee members could not
reach agreement on a specific
policy.
"I think they do intend to decide
at that (their Oct. 19 meeting) to
bring a resolution to the senate,"
Bush said, but she would give no in
dication what that resolution might
say.
And if Clark should lose?
"There's no place to pursue that,"
Clark said, and although he wishes
to increase his campus coverage,
reporting on the senate is not
"critical or essential" in achieving
that goal.
The current Faculty Senate policy
is more open than its original rules,
which limited coverage to use of
only the language of senate resolu
tions, according to Beyers, who has
functioned as senate information
officer since the creation of that
body in 1968.
