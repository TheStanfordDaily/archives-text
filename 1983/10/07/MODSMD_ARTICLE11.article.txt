Better recruiting?
As a part-time athlete, and a
person who derives his status in
the world vicariously through my
connection with a winning school,
I would like to suggest the follow
ing remedies for our "athletic
problem."
First we need a change at the
top. Andy Ceiger has his virtues
but he does not have the right
attitude nor sufficient assets to
really bring winning teams to the
Farm. We should replace him with
George Steinbrenner. He knows
the importance of tradition and
how to put on a class show. In
addition, he could make us less
dependent on the Buck Club.
Then we need to bring on some

first-rate teachers and people as
coarhps. Frank Kush and Billy
Martin immediately spring to mind.
George would undoubtedly be
able to find others of similar
quality.
Finally, we need to change our
recruitment policies. Everybody
knows the problem there. While
we are at it, I would suggest some
further changes. Last year the
performance in my Family Law
class was not up to expectations. I
was not totally satisfied with drama
on campus. And the quality of
student journalism was dreadful. If
the Stanford faculty is to produce
winning academics, winning enter
tainers and winning teams, we'd
better improve the material given
us. Or, on second thought, maybe
I should resign and DK should fire

the Drama and Journalism
faculties.

Magareda analysis
The article entitled, "Soviet con
duct guided by fear, not inherent
evil" (Daily, Sept. 29) was one ot
the most carefully thought out
analyses of this political situation
that I have read.
Richard Nagareda's verv logical
conclusion was that all our capacity
to negotiate and keep peace with
people who simply do not accept
our moral propositions is necessary
to save both Western and Soviet
civilizations.
