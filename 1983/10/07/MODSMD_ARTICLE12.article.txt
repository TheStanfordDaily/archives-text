## Soviet expansionism threatens U.S. 
### 
It happened on Aug. 31. By now, many of us
feel nauseated when we see yet another televi
sion documentary defining the "true story" or
vet another newspaper editorial exposing the
"real tragedy" of KAL 007. In fact, perhaps we
are too sick of them. America has a regrettable
history of forgiving and then forgetting inci
dents of Soviet aggression. If Reagan and com
pany admonish the public about the dangers of
Soviet expansion or aggression, it is dismissed
as another example of inflamed government
rhetoric designed to justify further defense
spending. I hear other students at dinner say
mockingly, "Yeah, we'd better nuke them
before they nuke us!"
But let's refresh our short memories for a mo
ment. Lenin and Stalin both publicly avowed
that the destiny of Russia was to realize world
hegemony. The pertinent questions for us are
these: 1) Ihese are just words. Have Soviet ac
tions made this objective manifest?, and 2) If so,
is this policy still dominant in the Politburo
today?
To answer these questions, we need only
review the expansion of the Soviet sphere since
World War 11. In the years immediately follow
ing Hitler's surrender, Russia's "occupation" of
what are known as the Eastern Bloc countries
subtly became "control." Romania, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia are
nothing more than Communist puppets. In
1956, Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary and fired
on civilian protestors. In 1968, a liberal faction in
the Czech Communist party proposed some
minor domestic changes. Apparently, the
Soviets considered this to be some breach of
their sovereignty, and they responded in the
distinctive Soviet way by filling Prague with So
viet tanks by night and "reshuffling" the Czech
government in a ruthless purge in which many
lost their lives as well as their membership cards
for the Communist party.
The withdrawal of the British and French from
former colonies in Africa and Asia created a
vacuum for the Soviets. Our foreign policy
bumbling resulted in Communist control of

North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Cambodia, and
Laos; these victories provided a base for infiltra
tion into inailand. In Africa, they employed
Cuban troops to double-cross their Eritrean
allies and obtain control of Ethiopia, with its
strategic Red Sea shoreline. In other parts of
Africa, the Soviets have graciously offered to
replace European colonialism with their own.
Where there were formerly no Communist
regimes in Africa, now there is no nation in
Africa that doesn't border on a Communist na
tion. No nation with a Communist government
has ever overthrown the government, and no
country has ever elected a Communist govern
ment. Furthermore, there is no Communist go
vernment that doesn't maintain power through
martial force.
Turning to the Miouie East, we find that in the
last 10 years, the Soviets have extended their
domination to South Yemen and Afghanistan,
and are presently in part responsible for contin
ued Syrian bellicosity in Lebanon. It doesn't re
quire a geopolitical genius to find the pattern:
they are after control of the oil reserves so
valuable to the West. The U.S. has been reduc
ing its dependence on foreign sources.
Nonetheless, we, and particularly our European
allies and Japan, still depend for our economic
livelihood on a reliable supply of OPEC oil.
The Soviets have succeeded in exporting
revolution throughout the globe. They seek not
to destroy America in the next decade, but
rather to force a slow, crippling death by jeopar
dizing our supplies of oil and minerals, by ac
quiring new allies in strategic places, by ruining
the reputation of the United States, and by
using selective detente to break apart the West
ern alliance system.
After each incidence of Soviet imperialism,
Democrats usually join Republicans in deplor
ing the act as inhumane and reprehensible. But
weeks later, Congress is back demanding cuts
in the defense budget, progress in arms
negotiations, increased cultural exchanges, and
lambasting the administration for creating
"another Vietnam." The short-lived outburst of
anger and dismay following the KAL 007 tragedy

is subsiding in America and around the world,
and we are completing another cycle in the
indignation-forgiveness process. This is exactly
what the Russians are counting on. Each un
defied challenge and each unsupported ally em
boldens the Soviets to accelerate their pace of
terrorization and subversion. Our feeble
responses to Soviet aggression produce an ad
ditional benefit for the Soviets: they encourage
our allies to reconsider the true value of U.S.
friendship.
The Russians are bent on victory, but they
don't mind waiting for it. Confident that the
West will continue not to learn from slowly ex
panding Soviet subversion and aggression, their
transgressions have accelerated since World
War 11. The invasion of Afghanistan was a
gamble for the Soviets, but it has taught them
that regardless of their actions, propaganda and
time will repair any damage of reputation. Now
they will wait some more.
This policy of waiting is extant in all facets of
their foreign policy. Why should they negotiate
seriously about removing missiles trained on
Europe when they can wage a propaganda war
against America in Europe and swing public
opinion enough to beget a unilateral Western
concession? Why should they negotiate serious
ly about curbing the undeniably dangerous
arms race if domestic pressure in America will
eventually produce a unilateral nuclear freeze?
Why should they encourage their Syrian allies to
be forthcoming in negotiating a mutual Syrian-
NATO withdrawal from Lebanon when they can
wait six or 18 months for Congress to throw the
Marines out of Lebanon?
Reagan's election victory was the worst possi
ble turn of events for the Soviets. Finally, they
would not be allowed to traipse unrebuffed
through the world annexing new lands. But if
this conservative trend in America doesn't con
tinue, there will be bad news and good news for
all Americans. The good news is that there will
be no nuclear war. The bad news is that the
Soviets will bring America to her knees without
one.

martial force.
Turning to the Miouie East, we find that in the
last 10 years, the Soviets have extended their
domination to South Yemen and Afghanistan,
and are presently in part responsible for contin
ued Syrian bellicosity in Lebanon. It doesn't re
quire a geopolitical genius to find the pattern:
they are after control of the oil reserves so
valuable to the West. The U.S. has been reduc
ing its dependence on foreign sources.
Nonetheless, we, and particularly our European
allies and Japan, still depend for our economic
livelihood on a reliable supply of OPEC oil.
The Soviets have succeeded in exporting
revolution throughout the globe. They seek not
to destroy America in the next decade, but
rather to force a slow, crippling death by jeopar
dizing our supplies of oil and minerals, by ac
quiring new allies in strategic places, by ruining
the reputation of the United States, and by
using selective detente to break apart the West
ern alliance system.
After each incidence of Soviet imperialism,
Democrats usually join Republicans in deplor
ing the act as inhumane and reprehensible. But
weeks later, Congress is back demanding cuts
in the defense budget, progress in arms
negotiations, increased cultural exchanges, and
lambasting the administration for creating
"another Vietnam." The short-lived outburst of
anger and dismay following the KAL 007 tragedy

is subsiding in America and around the world,
and we are completing another cycle in the
indignation-forgiveness process. This is exactly
what the Russians are counting on. Each un
defied challenge and each unsupported ally em
boldens the Soviets to accelerate their pace of
terrorization and subversion. Our feeble
responses to Soviet aggression produce an ad
ditional benefit for the Soviets: they encourage
our allies to reconsider the true value of U.S.
friendship.
The Russians are bent on victory, but they
don't mind waiting for it. Confident that the
West will continue not to learn from slowly ex
panding Soviet subversion and aggression, their
transgressions have accelerated since World
War 11. The invasion of Afghanistan was a
gamble for the Soviets, but it has taught them
that regardless of their actions, propaganda and
time will repair any damage of reputation. Now
they will wait some more.
This policy of waiting is extant in all facets of
their foreign policy. Why should they negotiate
seriously about removing missiles trained on
Europe when they can wage a propaganda war
against America in Europe and swing public
opinion enough to beget a unilateral Western
concession? Why should they negotiate serious
ly about curbing the undeniably dangerous
arms race if domestic pressure in America will
eventually produce a unilateral nuclear freeze?
Why should they encourage their Syrian allies to
be forthcoming in negotiating a mutual Syrian-
NATO withdrawal from Lebanon when they can
wait six or 18 months for Congress to throw the
Marines out of Lebanon?
Reagan's election victory was the worst possi
ble turn of events for the Soviets. Finally, they
would not be allowed to traipse unrebuffed
through the world annexing new lands. But if
this conservative trend in America doesn't con
tinue, there will be bad news and good news for
all Americans. The good news is that there will
be no nuclear war. The bad news is that the
Soviets will bring America to her knees without
one.

It happened on Aug. 31. By now, many of us
feel nauseated when we see yet another televi
sion documentary defining the "true story" or
vet another newspaper editorial exposing the
"real tragedy" of KAL 007. In fact, perhaps we
are too sick of them. America has a regrettable
history of forgiving and then forgetting inci
dents of Soviet aggression. If Reagan and com
pany admonish the public about the dangers of
Soviet expansion or aggression, it is dismissed
as another example of inflamed government
rhetoric designed to justify further defense
spending. I hear other students at dinner say
mockingly, "Yeah, we'd better nuke them
before they nuke us!"
But let's refresh our short memories for a mo
ment. Lenin and Stalin both publicly avowed
that the destiny of Russia was to realize world
hegemony. The pertinent questions for us are
these: 1) Ihese are just words. Have Soviet ac
tions made this objective manifest?, and 2) If so,
is this policy still dominant in the Politburo
today?
To answer these questions, we need only
review the expansion of the Soviet sphere since
World War 11. In the years immediately follow
ing Hitler's surrender, Russia's "occupation" of
what are known as the Eastern Bloc countries
subtly became "control." Romania, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia are
nothing more than Communist puppets. In
1956, Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary and fired
on civilian protestors. In 1968, a liberal faction in
the Czech Communist party proposed some
minor domestic changes. Apparently, the
Soviets considered this to be some breach of
their sovereignty, and they responded in the
distinctive Soviet way by filling Prague with So
viet tanks by night and "reshuffling" the Czech
government in a ruthless purge in which many
lost their lives as well as their membership cards
for the Communist party.
The withdrawal of the British and French from
former colonies in Africa and Asia created a
vacuum for the Soviets. Our foreign policy
bumbling resulted in Communist control of

North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Cambodia, and
Laos; these victories provided a base for infiltra
tion into inailand. In Africa, they employed
Cuban troops to double-cross their Eritrean
allies and obtain control of Ethiopia, with its
strategic Red Sea shoreline. In other parts of
Africa, the Soviets have graciously offered to
replace European colonialism with their own.
Where there were formerly no Communist
regimes in Africa, now there is no nation in
Africa that doesn't border on a Communist na
tion. No nation with a Communist government
has ever overthrown the government, and no
country has ever elected a Communist govern
ment. Furthermore, there is no Communist go
vernment that doesn't maintain power through
martial force.
