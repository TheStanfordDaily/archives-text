## Lessons from Chile and the Philippines 
### 
While the attention of the Bay
Area media has been focused on the
Korean jet tragedy, Lebanon, and
the resurgence of the 49ers, events
of potentially more long-lasting sig
nificance elsewhere are passing with
little comment and less analysis.
Decade-old dictatorships are slowly
but violently collapsing in the
Philippines and in Chile. Of course,
third-world dictatorships collapse all
the time, and in a lot of countries 10
years is actually an unusually long
period of stability. What makes the
Philippines and Chile more
noteworthy is the fact that the U.S.
was heavily involved in the es
tablishment of both of their present
governments, and stands to lose
greatly from their demise.

No American interest is
ever served by support
ing repression abroad
which we would not
tolerate at home.

In 1972 Philippine President Fer
dinand Marcos, behind in the
opinion polls, cancelled then
upcoming elections and declared
martial law. The degree of prior U.S.
consultation and approval for
Marcos' actions is not clear. At the
least, former U.S. President Nixon
could sympathize with Marcos' dis
taste for free, fair elections. The
U.S. strongly supported Marcos and
his martial law decrees after the can
cellation of the elections.
In 1973, Salvador Allende, the
elected Left Socialist president of
Chiie, was ousted and killed in a
coup that was unusually bloody
even by Latin American standards.
Many allegations have been made
about that coup, most notably in the
movie Missing. The CIA and several
important corporations were very
unhappy with Allende. On the other
hand, nobody in the U.S. would
have chosen Augusto Pinochet, Al
lende's military liaison and erstwhile
ally, as his successor. Again, as in
the Philippines, the U.S. unques
tionably supported Pinochet with
vigor as soon as the coup was over.
Until these events, the Philippines
and Chile had been notable in their
respective regions for the strength
and longevity of their democratic in
stitutions. In both countries, the
end of democracy is inextricably
linked in popular belief to the ac
tions of the United States.
Nixon and all succeeding presi
dents have supported Marcos. The
Pentagon believes that U.S. Air
Force and Navy installations in the
Philippines are irreplacable. Presi

dent Carter, at least, distanced him
self from Pinochet. But the thought
of Chile's long, strategic coastline in
unfriendly hands is enough to chill
any U.S. defense analyst.
America's support for Marcos and
Pinochet may be understandable,
but it may not be forgiven. Anti-
Marcos demonstrations have begun
to take a strongly anti-American
tone. Popular opinion in Chile has
shifted against the U.S. ever since
the Pinochet coup there. Even third
world countries have pride, as
American administrations are
sometimes prone to forget. Any
country resents perceived inter
ference in its political processes, es
pecially when the interference
short-circuits democratic elections.
Imagine American reaction if the
roles were reversed. Supporting dic
tators, as in the Philippines and
Chile, who stifle the press, torture
political opponents, harass priests,
tamper with the courts, and shoot
demonstrators, is just not a popular
or effective policy for the U.S. in the
long term.
The same processes continue
today. The U.S. is dissipating its
enormous World War 11-era reser
voirs of goodwill in the Philippines.
Marcos' opponents in 1972 may not
have been much less venal than
Marcos himself, but now the U.S. is
identified with all the failures of the
regime it supported. If the U.S. had
let Allende's economic experiments
continue to fail, Chile would prob
ably have avoided any further far left
governments for decades. Instead
of learning from its mistakes, Chile
will likely swing even further to the
left after Pinochet, and then blame
its problems on the "arrogant, im
perialistic" United States.
It may be too late to "save" the
Philippines and Chile. President
Carter disowned Somoza, the U.S.-
installed dictator of Nicaragua, but
this left little goodwill there among
the current Sandinista rulers (who
take their name from a general
killed by invading American Marines
in the 19305). If there is a lesson to
be learned here, it is that no Ameri
can interest is ever served, in the
long term, by supporting repression
abroad which we would not tolerate
at home. Our bases and short term
strategic gains are about to be lost
for good. Even more, tampering
with the political processes of other
countries eventually rebounds to
our discredit. If America has an ad
vantage over Moscow, it is our
democracy and freedom. Chile and
the Philippines received the benefits
of neither.
