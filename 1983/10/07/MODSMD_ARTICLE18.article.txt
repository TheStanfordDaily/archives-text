# Students maintain their addiction with daily injections of soaps

### TINA MARIE BASKIN 
There's an addiction that
grips the nation. But it doesn't
cause cancer. It isn't fattening.
It isn't even illegal.
It's Greg and Jenny and
Meryl and Roger. It's romance
and treachery and adultery
and lust.
It's a lot of commercials for
Ivory Snow and Hefty trash

'These things that happen to these
characters have happened to me. I've gone
out with older guys my parents disapproved
of. I've been ragged on, hit by a car, been in
accidents. Some of this has happened to
everyone, I'm sure. I can relate on that
level.'

bags and please-don't
squeeze the Charmin and
Pampers with stay-dry lining
and Arm & Hammer Baking
Soda.

It's One Life to Live, General
Hospital, All My Children and
As the World Turns.
And it's hit Stanford just as
hard as it's hit the rest of the
nation.
About 20 Toyon residents
cram themselves into a loft at
lunchtime in the Los Arcos
eating club every weekday to
watch their favorite soap: All

My Children.
As the familiar theme of All
My Children filled the room
earlier this week, conversation
stopped, bodies leaned for

ward, eyes got bigger. Any dis
cussion of the soap opera
craze would have to wait until
the first commercial.
"There's a big run for food
around 12:15 and empty plates
stack up around 12:45. You
know, some people don't eat
until the first commercial," ex
plained Donald Nagle, a has
her at the eating club.
Nagle was one of the few
people at Los Arcos willing to
talk during the show.
"It's All My Children, isn't it?
Well, I watched it over the
summer. I knew some guys
who were Stanford graduates
and they taped it on their
Beta Max everyday. We'd all
watch it after work. I was al
most addicted. It was close."
Wayne Hegarty, an admitted
soap junkie, spoke for a min
ute during a commercial. "I've
been watching soaps for five
years on and off. I'm usually
here at noon and sure to be
back by 2:00."
Another soap-junkie, Amy
Wilson, said she has tried to
schedule her classes around
her favorite soap, Loving. But
academic requirements being
what they are, Wilson was
forced to switch soaps. "But
it's OK because now I have
two one-hour soaps instead of
just one half hour soap."
However, Amy Ardell has
had amazing success schedul
ing her life around All My
Children every day since
junior high school. She talks
quickly, stopping frequently
to yell at the screen.

"I lived close to the school
so I'd go home with friends
and watch it during lunch."
She shouts something at a
character on the screen, then
continues. "I've been watch
ing this since I was born. I
knew all the old characters
before. Do you like this new
guy? I know all of the little
subplots, their pasts.
"It's like watching dramatic
life. I don't care how much
people say these soaps aren't

realistic. They are. This can
happen. There are snakes in
the world like Tad. Heck, my
life is a soap," said Ardell, who
lives off campus but joined the
eating club just to watch the
soaps.
"The things that happen to
these characters have hap
pened to me. I've gone out
with older guys my parents
disapproved of. I've been
ragged on, hit by a car, been
in acrirlenN Snme of this has

happend to everyone, I'm
sure I can relate on that level."
She said watching soaps is
"like knowing a bunch of
people but not having to get
involved."
A Stanford staff member
who once wrote a soap opera
newsletter agreed with Ardell.
"It (a soap opera) gives a lot
of people something to talk
about that isn't vicious to
someone else. A lot of women

get together and talk about
people who aren't there. But if
you can talk about Luke and
jenny and Meryl and Roger
you don't hurt anyone," she
said.
But in the meanwhile, there
are more immediate concerns.
Will luke ever appear again?
Will the romance between
Greg and jenny survive? Will
Rick ever operate again?
There's only one way to find
out...
