## Two 'worst' teams battle it out Stanford, UCLA try for win No. 1 
### ADAM BERNS 
The nation s top two football teams
will square oft tomorrow at Stanford
Stadium. Unfortunatelv, UCLA and
Stanford are ranked tirst and second in
the Los Angeles Times' traditional bot
tom ten.
Both teams have not yet won a
game, although UCLA tied with
Arizona State, but the similiarit\ be
tween the teams does not just stop
there. Neither the Bruins nor the Car
dinal have run the ball effectively this
year, and both have made a midseason
quarterback change.
The readv excuse tor both teams has
been the schedule. UCLA has the
hardest rated schedule in the nation,
while Stanford's schedule is ranked
No. 6.
The Bruins have lost to Georgia (19-
8), No. 1 ranked Nebraska (42-10), tied
with Arizona State (26-26) and last
week lost to BYU (37-35).
UCLA has had problems with its run
ning game this vear. Despite the pres
ence of highly regarded tailbacks
Kevin Nelson (Darrin's brother) and
Danny Andrews, the Bruins rank 97th
in the nation in rushing with only 335
yards in 165 carries for a 2.0 average.
The leading ball carrier is Andrews
with 143 yards in 34 carries followed by
Nelson with 138 yards in 42 carries.
Last year against Stanford, Nelson ran
for 90 yards on 13 carries, leading the
Bruins to a 38-35 victory.
"I think they are a better offensive
football team than they are perform
ing," Stanford football coach Paul Wig

gin said about the UCLA offense. "I
think they are capable of running the
ball much better than they ha\e been.
Their offense is on the brink of jel
ling."
The Bruiri passing game, however,
has been a different story. UCLA is
ranked sixth in the nation in passing,
averaging 287 yards a game.
Quarterback Risk Neuheisel who
started the season tor UCLA was
replaced last week by junior Steve
Bono. In his first collegiate start, Bono
completed 25 of <4 passes tor i99 yards
and would be ranked first in the nation
in passing efficiency it he had only
three more passing attempts.
Sophomore wide receiver Mike
Sherrard is the top receiver for the
Bruins with 21 receptions tor 544 yards.
Stanford's oftense has the same
strengths and weaknesses as does
UCLA.
The Cardinal ranks dead last in the
nation (105 th) in rushing, averaging
onlv 29.7 yards a game, and its leading
rusher sophomore Kevin Scott is still
out with a shoulder injury.
Freshman Thomas Henley, who is
slated to start tomorrow at halfback
has 89 yards rushing, while receiver
Mike Tolliver is third with 24 yards on
one carry â€” a reverse play.
The passing game is the only area
where the offense has had any
semblance of success. Stanford is
ranked fifth nationally in passing of
fense with a 292.7 yard average per
game.
Freshman quarterback John Pave is

expected to start his second game
torn orrow. With 894 passing yards
Paye has already thrown tor more
yards in tour games than John Elway
did during his entire freshman season.
"John will probably start on Satur
day," Wiggin said at a press confer
ence earlier in the week. "He's really
coming along very well. He stays
poised and hangs in there. Keep in
mind that the kid is only 18 years old."
Senior receiver Mike Tolliver leads
Stantord in receiving with JO catches
tor JB7 yards and is ranked second na
tionally. Junior Emile Harry has only 12
receptions but is averaging a whop
ping 28.2 yards a reception.
Stanford may get one of its best op
portunities this season to run the ball
this weekend against a UCLA detense
which is ranked 98th in the nation
against the run.
Unlike the past two teams Stanford
has played (San Jose State and Arizona
State), UCLA is not a blitzing team and
does not like to gamble.
"UCLA is a young football team,"
Wiggin said. "They are not a blitzing
football team. From a defensive stand
point, they don't like to take chances.'
They play the percentages."
The most dominating player for
UCLA has been senior tree safety Don
Rogers. Wiggin said that Rogers con
cerns him more than anyone else on
the Bruin defense; the All-America
candidate had 1 1 solo tackles last
week. Wiggin feels that his defense
is very similar in its philosophy
to that of UCLA. But more
than just the philosophy is
similar.
Like UCLA, Stanford's rus
hing defense is among the na
tion's worst. The Cardinal
ranks 103 in the nation against
the run, giving up an average
of 275.7 yards a game.
Cardinal defensive tackle
Mike Wyman does not feel
that the defensive line is as
bad as the statistics indicate.
"Our defensive line has
dominated every offensive
line we've played so far,"
Wyman said. I think our
defense has been on the field
too long. But that's something
that we're working on.
"When teams run up the
middle on us, it's a blown as
signment. With Pat Mitchell,
myself, and my brother
(middle linebacker Dave
Wyman), no one can run up

the middle."
Pass defense, however, has
been an area of great improve
ment for Stanford. The Car
dinal is ranked 13th nationally
against the pass, giving up
only 142.5 yards a game.
Senior cornerback Kevin
Baird, however, is question
able for tomorrow's game be
cause of rib problems.
Several Stanford players are
suffering from minor injuries.
Defensive tackle Carin Veris
has a mild shoulder bruise.
Linebacker Tom Briehl is suf
fering with an ankle problem
and quarterback Paye had sore
knees earlier in the week.
UCLA has two Bay Area
players on its squad, center
Terry Theordore from
Fremont High School and de
fensive tackle Mark Whalen
from Burlingame High School.
UCLA currently leads the se
ries between the two schools,
with a 28-22-3 record against
Stanford.
Tomorrow's game will be
telecast by ESPN to a national
audience.
