UCLA 38,
Stanford 35
Pasadena, Calif., Nov. 15,
1982 — The Pacific-10 version of
the arms race was unilaterally
disarmed long enough for
UCLA to rush for 351 yards Sat
urday and roll past Stanford
38-35, eliminating the Cardinal
from the post-season bowl
picture.
Bruin quarterback Tom
Ramsey added 314 yards in the
aerial circus that featured two
of the premier passers in the
nation.
UCLA's piercing attack
rolled up 651 yards, pouring
through a Stanford defense
that was little more efficient
than a sieve.

Stanford Heisman Trophy
candidate John Elway com
pleted 29-of-39 passes for 352
vards, but watched helplessly
as UCLA's offensive machine
was slowed to a punt only
once.
"There is no question we
gave up a lot of yardage,"
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin
said. "We just couldn't stop
their momentum. They had
the ability to run the plays they
had to. They had a very good
game plan — displaying a good
balance between the run and
the pass."
Bruin tailback Danny
Andrews rushed for 148 yards,
sweeping and punching
through gaping holes and past
would-be tacklers. Kevin Nel
son, brother of former Stan
ford great Darrin, rushed for
90 yards on 13 carries.
Wide receivers Jojo
Townsell and Cormac Carney
had six receptions each for a

combined 202 yards and two
touchdowns.
"We were just trying to
keep the defense off
balance," Ramsey said. "We'll
take yards any way we can get
them. They (UCLA's offensive
line) protected us when we
were throwing and opened
some holes when we were
running."
Ramsey orchestrated his
linemen, mixing the run with
the pass, as they opened holes
that were as large as the ones
Ramsey found in the Stanford
secondary.
"There were two things that
stood out in this game from a
defensive standpoint," Wiggin
said. "First was our inability to
tackle cleanly, and second was
our inability to contain the
quarterback."
Ramsey rolled away from
numerous would-be sackers
and completed passes for big
yardage.
