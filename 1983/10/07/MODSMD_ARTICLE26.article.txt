# Stanford's Price is right for the Cardinal secondary
## 
### BETH KLEID 
junior right cornerback Eric
Price for the Cardinal aims to
help improve the defense this
season.
"I want the defense to
develop to the point where
they are a force to be
reckoned with," he said. "In
the past Stanford was known
for its offense. I want to see
people talk about defense
when they talk about Stan
ford."
If the Card defense is to at
tain Price's goal, Price himself
will probably be one of the es
sential reasons for its achieve
ment. He is a hard-hitting
tackier who does not know
the meaning of the word
"no."
The junior, who has become
a fixture on the Cardinal
defense, describes himself as
tough player. "I try to be
tough mentally as well as
physically," he said. "I feel
that you build a mental tough
ness while you are preparing
yourself physically — it serves as
a foundation. It is a mental
struggle to learn how to do
what it takes to get the job
done."
And Price's record shows
that he has obviously learned
ways to overcome this mental
struggle, and he has learned
to do his job. In 1982 he
boasted 17 solo tackles; he

made seven tackles in a single
game against USC, and in his
sophomore year he made 29
tackles in his final eight games
of the season.
Price started his career on
the Farm with great success.
Fie remembers his freshman
year as his favorite. "When I
was a freshman everything
was so new to me. It was excit
ing to see myself develop my
ability as a football player," he
said
"The best game of my
career also was during my
freshman year," Price said, re
ferring to the 1981 Big Game in
which he made six tackles,
one pass deflection and one
interception. "Everything that
I was taught just fell into
place, and it was even more
exciting because it was Big
Game."
Price became a starter the
third game of his freshman
year, which he said "felt very
good." During his sophomore
year he pounded many oppo
nents during the first eight
games of the season, but was
sidelined during the last three
because of a groin injury.
Price is healthy now, and he
is not pessimistic about this
season — despite the Card's
losing record. "I don't think
that anyone has given up yet.
The team spirit seems to be
there generally," he said.

Price said that he would like
to see the team win the
remaining games this season,
but he would especially like to
see the Card win the Big
Game. "This team wants Cal
beaten badly," he said. "It
should be an extremely emo
tional game, and very physical
with a lot of collisions and
bodies flying everywhere."
The cornerback started
playing football "in the back
yard about as far back as I can
remember." He joined his first
football team when he was
seven years old and living in
Missouri. Young Price found
his parents to be supportive
and encouraging about his
playing football.
In high school in Santa Ana,
California, Price was an All-
CIF and All-County player. But
he was not heavily recruited.
Stanford was the only Pacific:-
10 school that offered him a
scholarship.
"The Stanford scholarship
worked like a dream," Price
said. I had already been at
tracted to Stanford because of
its strong engineering depart
ment, and I had applied
before I was recruited. When I
was recruited, everything fell
into place."
Price is happy with life on
the Farm. "Wiggin's football
program has worked out well
