It's put up or shut up time
tor the Stanford water polo
team.
Atter losing six of seven
starters and his top seven
scorers to graduation, Head
Coach Dante Dettamanti has
had 12 games to mold a
cohesive and competitive unit
from a host of treshmen and
sophomores.
Whether Dettamanti directs
a squad capable of defending
last year's Pacific-10 Confer
ence title (Stanford's seventh
in eight yearsi and grabbing a
berth in the NCAA may be de
termined today and tomorrow
when the Cardinal defends its
national championship against
No. 3 ranked UC-lrvine and
No. 4 UCLA respectively.
"The pre-season is
finished," Dettamanti said.
"This is the start of a new
season and a chance to
redeem ourselves."
In the "old" season Stan

ford finished 5-6-1 with five
freshman starters and without
Chris Thompson, the Card's
starting hole man.
Freshman Mark Imbernino
and sophomore Jaime Velez,
with lb and 13 goals
respectively, spearhead an at
tack that will try to avenge a
b-4 loss to UC-lrvine in the
Irvine tournament two weeks
ago.
The Irvine Anteaters' of
fense revolves around junior
Jeff Campbell and senior Mike
Evans, both All-America can
didates according to Detta
manti. But a lack of depth has
plagued the defending
champs, producing an incon
sistent attack recently
evidenced by a six-goal thrash
ing at the hands of UCLA.
UCLA will be the opening
game of Stanford's Pac-IO
schedule and the Bruins also
have experienced some ups
and downs early this season.
But being a "big, strong and

physical team with more
depth than UCSB,' UCLA fig
ures to utilize the bullying
stvle that hampered the Car
dinal in their 7-2 loss to UCSB
last weekend.
"We're going to have to play
tough defense against both
teams and eliminate the errors
that plagued us in the last
match," said the Stanford
coach.

In an attempt to shore up
the defense, Dettamanti will
start senior Martin Fisher in
goal against Irvine. The Reed
ley native gets the call over
1982 third team Ail-American
Steve Moyer.
