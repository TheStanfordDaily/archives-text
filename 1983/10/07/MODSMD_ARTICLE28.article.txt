# Westmont booters no walkover

### MAC KINLAY POLHEMUS 
Coming off two exciting
victories, the Stanford men's
soccer team takes on National
Athletic Intercollegiate Associ
ation (NAIA) Westmont Col
lege of Santa Barbara at 11
a.m. tomorrow on Harry
Maloney Field.
Although Westmont Col
lege is not exactly a big-name
team, it will put up quite a
fight against the Cardinal.
They beat a very strong Santa
Clara team who has in turn
beat Stanford 4-2.
Scoring will be no trouble
for Westmont since their at
tack is led by Louie Cuevas, a
bonafide Ail-American who
has shredded the nets for nine
goals this season.
Despite Westmont's strength,
Stanford's game plan will
remain the same. "We're work
ing on strengthening our
two-front system," said Coach
Nelson Lodge. Since the sys
tem has been put into use,
Stanford has been able to
confuse its opponents enough
to average three goals per
game.
Lodge hopes that by the end
of the year his team style of
soccer will reach its peak.

"Since Angel (Vasquez) is
gone, we had to rebuild and
find another peak," Lodge
said. "We will probably reach
it by the USF game (the
second to last game of the
year).
"I am switching people
around as much as possible
and checking them out,"
Lodge said when asked how
he was preparing for the
mighty Westmont team.
The Cardinal, 6-2-1, is
looking for its seventh win of
the season. As of today, Stan
ford is ranked sixth in the Far
West. However, they have lost
midfielder Cassio Conceicao
due to a red card in the wild
game against San Diego State.
He will only be out for one
game, but any loss of person
nel to the already thin Stan
ford team is significant.
With the added strength of
new Head Coach Ron Fortosif,
Westmont will be a contender
against Stanford as well as in
the NAIA division. Fortosif is
said to have luck on his side
and often wears certain arti
cles of clothing during impor
tant games to keep his luck
from running out.
