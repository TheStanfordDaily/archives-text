## 
### TOM MOORE 
Riding a six-match winning streak, the
women's volleyball team hopes to con
tinue its success on the road against con
ference foes Cal-State Long Beach and
San Diego State this weekend.
Coming off impressive victories in
Arizona, the women spikers own a per
fect 2-0 WCAA mark and stand at 6-2 over
all.
Tonight tne Card squares off against
what Stanford Coach Fred Sturm calls a

"much improved" Cal-State Long Beach
squad. Though CSLB is 0-1 in conference
play and only 7-8 overall, Sturm warned
against taking them lightly. "Long Beach
can surprise you," he said, "and they play
well at home."
Saturday night should prove to be a
major test for the Cardinal. San Diego
State finished third in the nation last year,
and with tive returners from that team,
SDS is 22-4 thus far this season with a 3-1
NCAA record.

Known for its vocal crowd, San Diego
State is a tough team to beat on its own
floor. Coach Sturm expects an exciting
contest. "Our matches (against SDS) have
always been hard fought, well played
ones. I he team that can best execute its
game plan should be successful."
After its trip to Southern California this
weekend, the team returns to Maples
Pavilion for seven straight home matches.
The Card faces UC Berkeley in its home
opener Tuesday at 7:30 p.m.
