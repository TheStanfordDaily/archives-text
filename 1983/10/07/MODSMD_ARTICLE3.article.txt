# ResEd to review the campus role of fraternities
## 
### HARA LEVY Staff writer 
Increasing numbers of fraternities
and sororities petitioning for
recognition by the University has
prompted Dean of Student Affairs
lames Lyons to appoint a special
committee to study these organiza
tions.
Lyons said the committee will be
looking at all aspects of fraternal or
ganizations here and expects to
release its review in two to three
weeks.
The committee will also announce
the members of a student task force
which will work with Residential
Education in formulating a consis
tant policy for the fraternity system.
The ASSU Nominations Committee
will select six students to be part of
the dozen or so members of the task
force
The official purpose of the task
group will be "to sort through the
complexities, conflicting goals, mul
tiple loyalities and myriad possible
outcomes, and to develop policies
designed to see through the next
decade of Stanford's history."
Lyons said the increase in the
percentage of those residences
which would be closed to the draw,
if all the recognized organizations
wanted on- campus housing, will be
an important issue for the group.
"The situation is sort of a catch

22," Lyons said, because the Univer
sity does not have that much
housing to allocate. The main ques
tion, he said, is how the University
can allow the new organizations on
campus and still promote diversity
within the residential housing sys
tem.
As of October 1982, Res Ed put a
freeze on one aspect of organization
recognition, which allows for use of
the University name in a title and
access to University resources, by
having a specific moratorium on the
eligibility for housing.
Under the previous policy, once
an organization was granted
recognition they were eligible for
campus housing.
Lyons said the freeze on housing
eligibility will allow time for the
entire Stanford community to
debate the issue.
The task force will submit their
recommendations to Lyons who will
in turn submit those recommen
dations to the Administrative Coun
cil so that a policy can be form
ulated.
Answers should be provided
when the review of current system
has been completed and recom
mendations for new policy have
been made.These are expected by
the end of the year.
