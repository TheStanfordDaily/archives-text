The action begins with the
Corporate Race at 9:30

men's race at 10 a.m. and
the men's competition at

Stanford's formidable
squads will face a multitude
of challenges from the 10
plus teams expected to run.
According to Coach Brooks
Johnson, opponents to
watch out for include the
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
women's team (1982 NCAA

Division II champs) and the
men's squads from UCLA,
Fresno State and Nevada-
Reno.
In the women's race, any
one of Stanford's outstand
ing top five could break the
tape. The team consists of
198* World Cross Country
runner-up Alison Wiley,
1982 NCAA 3000-meter
champion Ceci Hopp, 1982
and 1983 3000-meter

800-meter finalist Regina
lacobs, and freshman
phenom Cory Schubert.
Also running varsity are
Michelle Mason and Hillary

Ellin. One non-Car d in a I
who could upset is Amy
Harper from Cal Poly-SLO.
Individually the men's
race is a hard one to call.
Several runners, including
Cardinals Jim Smith, Marc
Oleson, Charles Alexander,
Ed Callaway and David
Erank have a shot at win
ning the race.
Other top-notch efforts
should come from Derrick
May (Nevada-Reno), Inn

Rounding out Stanford's
men's squad are Mike
Kubitschek, Jeff Alkinson
and Brian Pettingill.
