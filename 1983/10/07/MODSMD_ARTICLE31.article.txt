Baltimore (AP) — Rookie Mike Bod
dicker, striking out a record-tying 14,
pitched a five-hitter and Gary Roenicke
slugged a two-run homer as the Bal
timore Orioles beat the Chicago White
Sox 4-0 last night and squared their
American League Championship Se
ries at one victory apiece.
The Orioles, with the victory,
avoided a gloomy situation. No team
in the best-of-five series has ever
survived losing the first two games at
home. The final three games — if they all
are necessary — are scheduled for Com
iskey Park at Chicago tonight, tomor
row and Sunday night. Mike Flanagan
will start for the Orioles in Came Three
against Rich Dotson.
Roenicke, a platoon player who did
not start in Baltimore's 2-1 loss in Wed
nesday's opener, homered in the sixth
inning, doubled, walked twice, scored

three times and had two RBI. Ken
Singleton doubled home one run and
the other scored on an error by
Chicago third baseman Vance Law.
Boddicker's 14 strikeouts, a career
high, tied the AL Championship Series
record and were the most by any
American League pitcher this year. He
recorded No. 14 by getting Julio Cruz
swinging in the ninth. The right
hander, who started the season in the
minor leagues, and White Sox left
hander Floyd Bannister began the
night in a struggle of power.
Boddicker, throwing an assortment
of breaking pitches and curly-cue
tastballs, struck out two in the tirst in
ning, and Bannister tanned three.
In the top of the second, Boddicker
struck out Greg Luzinski to start. He
then hit Tom Paciorek with his next
pitch and walked Ron Kittle on a 3-1
pitch to give the White Sox two

baserunners. But, as thev had in their
Game One victory when thev stranded
10 baserunners, Chicago let another
opportunity slip bv.
On a i-2 pitch, Boddicker struck out
Vance Law, and Paciorek, on the front
end of an attempted double steal, was
thrown out at third by catcher Rick
Dempsey for a double play.
In the bottom half ot the inning,
Roenicke led off with a double. It was
his sixth hit off Bannister in IB career
at-bats and all have been for extra
bases, including four home runs.
The next batter, designated hitter
Ken Singleton, then hit a hard
grounder toward third and Law, a con
verted shortstop, let it bound off his
glove. When he recovered, his throw
went over Paciorek's head into the
White Sox's dugout, allowing
Roenicke to score.
