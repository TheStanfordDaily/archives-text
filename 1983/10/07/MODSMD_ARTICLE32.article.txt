On the Waterfront (1954) ★
Kresge Auditorium
■ Terry Malloy, has-been
fighter turned dock worker,
'represented the smashed
dreams of a generation when
this film was released in the
mid-50s, and there is still much
;1n this portrait of a decent, in
expressive guy trying to deal
'with the web of corruption he
lis caught in to move
iaudiences. Crude as parts of
Budd Schulberg's script (out of
his novel) are, and despite Karl
[Maiden's characteristic mug
ging in the role of the priest,
the movie still packs a hell of a
punch. As Terry, Marlon
Brando gives his most amazing
early performance; one can
just imagine how the
audiences of the time
responded to those magnetic
Neanderthal looks and the im
passioned earnestness of his
acting. Eva Marie Saint and Rod
Steiger are excellent, but
Brando blows everyone else
off the screen. Directed by Elia
Kazan, whom every young ac
tor in America was dying to
work with (having discovered
Brando-for A Streetcar Named
Desire-he went on to find
)ames Dean), shot by Boris
Kaufman, and with a classic
Leonard Bernstein score.
Plays tonight.
The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie (1972) ★
Terman Auditorium
Luis Bunuel whips up a wick
edly amusing comedy out of a
single joke: the characters
keep trying to eat a meal and
for some reason they never
can. It's not much of a movie,
but you'll be amazed at how
graceful it is. (He wrote it with
lean-Claude Carriere.) With a
dazzling cast, used mostly for
their elegance and panache:
Stephane Audran, Julien Ber
theau, Fernando Rey, Del
phine Seyrig, lean-Pierre
Cassel, Bulle Ogier, Michel
Piccoli.
Plays Tuesday evening.

Rashomon (1950) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
"Often men won't speak the
truth even to themselves,"
says one of the characters in
Akira Kurosawa's unforget
table film, and-adapting a story
by Akugatawa-the director sets
out to prove that the truth is
undiscoverable. The plot is
devilishly simple: a bandit
(Toshiro Mitune) robs a noble
(Masayuki Mori) in the forest
and rapes his wife (Machiko
Kyo); the noble dies — at the
bandit's hands or at his own.
Kurosawa plays out the story
four times, communicating the
perception of each of the
major characters and that of a
woodcutter (Takasi Shimura)
who claims to have witnessed
the entire episode. Machiko
Kyo, later the Lady Macbeth of
Kurosawa's Throne ot Blood,
gives a remarkably versatile
performance.
Plays Thursday with Gate of
Hell.

The Verdict (1982)
Cubberley Auditorium
David Mamet's script ser
monizes earnestly about the
need for the poor and weak to
believe in the possibility of
justice, and the director, Sid
ney Lumet, keeps his camera
discreetly distant from the ac
tion so that we can admire how
carefully sets have been built
and compositions arranged.
This movie about a down-and
out lawyer who sees the
chance to redeem himself and
reverse the course of his pro
fessional life with a malpractice
case is a real Oscar contender,
and though Paul Newman
gives a very good performance

on and off, Lumet has directed
him to make his bid for an
Academy Award, which means
that his big scenes are slowed
down and seem a little over
rehearsed and dried out.
Besides, this movie makes him
as noble as a Frank Capra hero,
and that doesn't give him
much to play. Mamet has pro
vided some nice roles,
however, for James Mason,
lack Warden and Julie
Bovasso.
Plays tonight.
Octopussy (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
The remarkably clear plot
(by George Macdonald Fraser,
Richard Maibaum and Michael
B. Wilson) links a sophisticated
jewel smuggling outfit with the

scheme of a bellicose Soviet
general (Steven Berkoff) to dis
rupt disarmament talks by set
ting off a bomb. Director John
Glen furnishes a highly varied
series of action sequences and
a grab bag of smiling refer
ences to other adventure
movies and famous literary ad
ventures as well. It's one of the
best )ames Bond movies, with
Roger Moore, surprisingly
human in the second half,
which is designed as more of a
Hitchcockian suspense picture
than a standard high-tech
Bond.
Plays Sunday evening.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest (1976) *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Kesey's novel, one of
the signal books of the 60s, Is
the tale of a renegade in a psy
chiatric hospital, told by an
other patient, a paranoid
schizophrenic; feverous and
eruptive, it probably would re
quire a director of Martin Scor
sese's caliber to translate it to
the screen faithfully — it's cer
tainly beyond the talents of
Mitos Forman. But the
screenwriters, Lawrence
Hauben and Bo Goldman,
turned it into a conventional,
third-person narrative — a first
rate one-and Forman did a fine
job with it. It's his best sus
tained movie. Readers of the
novel pegged fnek Nicholson
tor the role of McMurphy, the
rebel, even before Forman did,
but though he might have
been tempted to simply skate
through it, Nicholson gives an
unpredictable performance
that may be, along with The
Last Detail, his most impres
sive work. The more unusual
casting coups are in the selec
tion of two relative unknowns,
Louise Fletcher and Brad
Dourif, for the roles of Nurse
Ratched (who must, in order
for the script to work, be con
siderably more comprehensi
ble than in the book) and Billy
Bibbitt; both are superb.

On the Waterfront (1954) ★
Kresge Auditorium
■ Terry Malloy, has-been
fighter turned dock worker,
'represented the smashed
dreams of a generation when
this film was released in the
mid-50s, and there is still much
;1n this portrait of a decent, in
expressive guy trying to deal
'with the web of corruption he
lis caught in to move
iaudiences. Crude as parts of
Budd Schulberg's script (out of
his novel) are, and despite Karl
[Maiden's characteristic mug
ging in the role of the priest,
the movie still packs a hell of a
punch. As Terry, Marlon
Brando gives his most amazing
early performance; one can
just imagine how the
audiences of the time
responded to those magnetic
Neanderthal looks and the im
passioned earnestness of his
acting. Eva Marie Saint and Rod
Steiger are excellent, but
Brando blows everyone else
off the screen. Directed by Elia
Kazan, whom every young ac
tor in America was dying to
work with (having discovered
Brando-for A Streetcar Named
Desire-he went on to find
)ames Dean), shot by Boris
Kaufman, and with a classic
Leonard Bernstein score.
Plays tonight.
The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie (1972) ★
Terman Auditorium
Luis Bunuel whips up a wick
edly amusing comedy out of a
single joke: the characters
keep trying to eat a meal and
for some reason they never
can. It's not much of a movie,
but you'll be amazed at how
graceful it is. (He wrote it with
lean-Claude Carriere.) With a
dazzling cast, used mostly for
their elegance and panache:
Stephane Audran, Julien Ber
theau, Fernando Rey, Del
phine Seyrig, lean-Pierre
Cassel, Bulle Ogier, Michel
Piccoli.
Plays Tuesday evening.

Rashomon (1950) ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
"Often men won't speak the
truth even to themselves,"
says one of the characters in
Akira Kurosawa's unforget
table film, and-adapting a story
by Akugatawa-the director sets
out to prove that the truth is
undiscoverable. The plot is
devilishly simple: a bandit
(Toshiro Mitune) robs a noble
(Masayuki Mori) in the forest
and rapes his wife (Machiko
Kyo); the noble dies — at the
bandit's hands or at his own.
Kurosawa plays out the story
four times, communicating the
perception of each of the
major characters and that of a
woodcutter (Takasi Shimura)
who claims to have witnessed
the entire episode. Machiko
Kyo, later the Lady Macbeth of
Kurosawa's Throne ot Blood,
gives a remarkably versatile
performance.
Plays Thursday with Gate of
Hell.

The Verdict (1982)
Cubberley Auditorium
David Mamet's script ser
monizes earnestly about the
need for the poor and weak to
believe in the possibility of
justice, and the director, Sid
ney Lumet, keeps his camera
discreetly distant from the ac
tion so that we can admire how
carefully sets have been built
and compositions arranged.
This movie about a down-and
out lawyer who sees the
chance to redeem himself and
reverse the course of his pro
fessional life with a malpractice
case is a real Oscar contender,
and though Paul Newman
gives a very good performance

on and off, Lumet has directed
him to make his bid for an
Academy Award, which means
that his big scenes are slowed
down and seem a little over
rehearsed and dried out.
Besides, this movie makes him
as noble as a Frank Capra hero,
and that doesn't give him
much to play. Mamet has pro
vided some nice roles,
however, for James Mason,
lack Warden and Julie
Bovasso.
Plays tonight.
Octopussy (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
The remarkably clear plot
(by George Macdonald Fraser,
Richard Maibaum and Michael
B. Wilson) links a sophisticated
jewel smuggling outfit with the

scheme of a bellicose Soviet
general (Steven Berkoff) to dis
rupt disarmament talks by set
ting off a bomb. Director John
Glen furnishes a highly varied
series of action sequences and
a grab bag of smiling refer
ences to other adventure
movies and famous literary ad
ventures as well. It's one of the
best )ames Bond movies, with
Roger Moore, surprisingly
human in the second half,
which is designed as more of a
Hitchcockian suspense picture
than a standard high-tech
Bond.
Plays Sunday evening.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest (1976) *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Kesey's novel, one of
the signal books of the 60s, Is
the tale of a renegade in a psy
chiatric hospital, told by an
other patient, a paranoid
schizophrenic; feverous and
eruptive, it probably would re
quire a director of Martin Scor
sese's caliber to translate it to
the screen faithfully — it's cer
tainly beyond the talents of
Mitos Forman. But the
screenwriters, Lawrence
Hauben and Bo Goldman,
turned it into a conventional,
third-person narrative — a first
rate one-and Forman did a fine
job with it. It's his best sus
tained movie. Readers of the
novel pegged fnek Nicholson
tor the role of McMurphy, the
rebel, even before Forman did,
but though he might have
been tempted to simply skate
through it, Nicholson gives an
unpredictable performance
that may be, along with The
Last Detail, his most impres
sive work. The more unusual
casting coups are in the selec
tion of two relative unknowns,
Louise Fletcher and Brad
Dourif, for the roles of Nurse
Ratched (who must, in order
