## An Italian Cafe – meet friends, enjoy life, and eat gelato 
### Sheri Sobrato 
BRAVO FONO
99 Palatine Court
Stanford Shopping Center

It Let's Co to Europe could
recommend European cafes in
the States, Bravo Fono at Stan
ford Shopping Center would
receive a "moto bene."
Italian social life centers at
the cate — it is a place to meet,
rest and enjoy the culinary
wizardry of European chefs. If
you have been overseas and
thought you could never find
some of the tastes and atmo
sphere you have enjoyed in
Florence, Paris, or even Hun
gary; or if you want the
pleasures without traveling
10,000 miles, Bravo Fono will
satisfy your palate and your
eye. Like the cafes in Europe,
once you visit you will soon
frequent it and become part of
the social atmosphere of the
cafe.
Bravo Fono is tucked behind
I. Magnin's near Nivens at the
shopping center. One practi
cally needs Thomas Cooke
navigating skills to find the
place, yet it is jammed all af
ternoon. It's comforting to
know the reputation preceeds

the place. The manager was
proud to tell us that one
couple comes all the way from
Marin each week to their fa
vorite cafe.
The cafe may be known to
students only as a Gelateria,
an Italian ice cream vendor.
Although their ice cream is
rated No. 1 in the Bay Area
gelaterias, perhaps it should
be considered as a grand
finale to an Italian entree,
pasta specialitv or light lunch.
Upon entering, one may not
recognize the decor as Italian.
No red, white and green flags
wave at the doorway, no
decorative baskets are filled
with Italian breads and no
framed prints of Italian
scenery adorn the walls. A
trained eye might recognize
the interior from the pages of
Architectural Digest, but all
will be impressed with the
"nuevo modern" design. The
display counter resembles a
disco — large radius curves
highlighted by running neon
light strips. One wall is entire
ly glass brick, half the roof is
glass and all the corners
rounded. Bare trees twinkle
with white Christmas lights.
Interior designers flock to
the cafe, so if you see a similar

design elsewhere you will
know its origin. All the equip
ment is European, from the ice
cream spatulas to the ice
cream makers. You can also sit
in the outdoor terrace and sip
an authentic Italian soda
(syrup and soda water). Be
cause Bravo Fono offers take
outs, there is constant bus
tling and a blur of background
noise. It is lively but not partic
ularly distracting, unless you
are planning to whisper
French sweet nothings to your
dinner guest.
The aim is to be unique, but
the decor is not the cafe's only
claim to uniqueness. I find it
unique that an Italian/French
cuisine cafe is owned by a
Hungarian. Bravo Fono is a
spin-off of Paprika Fono in
Ghirardelli Square, a Hun
garian restaurant. The Hun
garian tradition followed to
Stanford and originally the
cafe served only small con
tinental entrees and Hun
garian dishes.
Now the dinner menu hosts
large Italian entrees served
with salads. The customers
would not dare let them take
the deep fried peasant
"Langos" bread or Cuylas
soup from the menu. Dinner

and grill specialties include
four kinds ot chicken iherbed,
Milanese, white wine and par
mesan), beet, lamb and
prawns ($9.95 to $11.95).
My guest had chicken par
migiana — well spiced, but not
overpowering. I began with a
delicately marinated cucum
ber salad, its tanginess
balanced by sour cream. I
chose the house specialty
pasta, the linguini alia Casa

Fono — egg noodles tossed with
julienne chicken breast, pros
ciutto, peas, mushrooms,
herbls and parmesan cheese.
My palate was a bit contused;
it expected rice with the "stir
fry," yet it was pleasantly
surprised at the taste

combined with "al dente"
pasta.
There are also conventional
pastas, but prepared in uncon
ventional ways — with
homemade pasta the treshest
spices and imported cheeses,
(fettuccine Alfredo, Bolognese
and Pesto; spinach tortellini in
cream sauce and linguini in
clam sauce —$b b.95). Many
loaded pizzas with mounds of
cheese made oi.r mouths

water, even on a full stomach —
quite the test (medium-sized
$5.95).
One word of caution: do
not come to dinner at Bravo
Fono unless you plan to return
for lunch. The menu tempts
you to salads and French

entrees that are not available
at dinner. The salads include a
seafood salad (shrimp,
avocado, marinated cucum
ber, mushrooms and tomato
served with a piquant sauce),
fresh fruit, cold pasta
vegetable salad, chicken
salad and a Meditteranean
salad (tuna, anchovy, potato,
green bean, tomato, celery
root olves, with mustard
vinagrette — all $5.95 to $7.25).
They also offer quiche ($4.95),
puff pastry with veal or
spinach ($5.50) and open
faced Italian omelettes ($5.95).
Bravo Fono's dessert experi
ence is the most unique
around — 35 dessert specialties
12 kinds of gelato and 12 sor
bettos. The tortes and pastries
($2 to $3) include such items as
almond torte with mocha
cream, Viennese chocolate
torte with raspberry
preserves, truffle cakes, fruit
tarts and strudels, and fresh
fruit soaked in wine.
On a dare I chose cheese
strudel. I never thought that I
would experience the sweet
cheese flavor of the cheese
desserts I had in Paris — but
after one bite, did I smile! My
friend ordered three scopes of
"artisan flavor" gelato ($3) and

quit talking tor tive minutes as
he savored — a good sign! They
also serve gelatos in more in
triguing ways — in shakes and
floats (something compltely
normal like "The Cowboy" —
vanilla gelato with Coca Cola
and popcorn), cream puffs
filled with gelato topped with
fudge, to even tresh orange
rinds filled with sorbetto made
with fresh squeezed orange
juice.
The service is attentive and
conscientious as well as
friendly. I felt like a guest
rather than a customer. We
were assured that we could
have fast-paced service if we
desired, yet they sensed that
we wanted to relax and did not
rush us. Special orders are no
problem since all items are
made upon ordering.
Bravo Fono's aim is to make
you feel as far away from Stan
ford as possible. European
food, comfort and decor are
awaiting you within walking
distance. Perhaps you can
have worldly intellectual dis
cussions on a rainy night over
a specialty coffee or bring
pictures and reminisce about
overseas excursions over a
relaxed continental dinner.

tinental entrees and Hun
garian dishes.
Now the dinner menu hosts
large Italian entrees served
with salads. The customers
would not dare let them take
the deep fried peasant
"Langos" bread or Cuylas
soup from the menu. Dinner

and grill specialties include
four kinds ot chicken iherbed,
Milanese, white wine and par
mesan), beet, lamb and
prawns ($9.95 to $11.95).
My guest had chicken par
migiana — well spiced, but not
overpowering. I began with a
delicately marinated cucum
ber salad, its tanginess
balanced by sour cream. I
chose the house specialty
pasta, the linguini alia Casa

Fono — egg noodles tossed with
julienne chicken breast, pros
ciutto, peas, mushrooms,
herbls and parmesan cheese.
My palate was a bit contused;
it expected rice with the "stir
fry," yet it was pleasantly
surprised at the taste

combined with "al dente"
pasta.
There are also conventional
pastas, but prepared in uncon
ventional ways — with
homemade pasta the treshest
spices and imported cheeses,
(fettuccine Alfredo, Bolognese
and Pesto; spinach tortellini in
cream sauce and linguini in
clam sauce —$b b.95). Many
loaded pizzas with mounds of
cheese made oi.r mouths

water, even on a full stomach —
quite the test (medium-sized
$5.95).
One word of caution: do
not come to dinner at Bravo
Fono unless you plan to return
for lunch. The menu tempts
you to salads and French

entrees that are not available
at dinner. The salads include a
seafood salad (shrimp,
avocado, marinated cucum
ber, mushrooms and tomato
served with a piquant sauce),
fresh fruit, cold pasta
vegetable salad, chicken
salad and a Meditteranean
salad (tuna, anchovy, potato,
green bean, tomato, celery
root olves, with mustard
vinagrette — all $5.95 to $7.25).
They also offer quiche ($4.95),
puff pastry with veal or
spinach ($5.50) and open
faced Italian omelettes ($5.95).
Bravo Fono's dessert experi
ence is the most unique
around — 35 dessert specialties
12 kinds of gelato and 12 sor
bettos. The tortes and pastries
($2 to $3) include such items as
almond torte with mocha
cream, Viennese chocolate
torte with raspberry
preserves, truffle cakes, fruit
tarts and strudels, and fresh
fruit soaked in wine.
On a dare I chose cheese
strudel. I never thought that I
would experience the sweet
cheese flavor of the cheese
desserts I had in Paris — but
after one bite, did I smile! My
friend ordered three scopes of
"artisan flavor" gelato ($3) and

quit talking tor tive minutes as
he savored — a good sign! They
also serve gelatos in more in
triguing ways — in shakes and
floats (something compltely
normal like "The Cowboy" —
vanilla gelato with Coca Cola
and popcorn), cream puffs
filled with gelato topped with
fudge, to even tresh orange
rinds filled with sorbetto made
with fresh squeezed orange
juice.
The service is attentive and
conscientious as well as
friendly. I felt like a guest
rather than a customer. We
were assured that we could
have fast-paced service if we
desired, yet they sensed that
we wanted to relax and did not
rush us. Special orders are no
problem since all items are
made upon ordering.
Bravo Fono's aim is to make
you feel as far away from Stan
ford as possible. European
food, comfort and decor are
awaiting you within walking
distance. Perhaps you can
have worldly intellectual dis
cussions on a rainy night over
a specialty coffee or bring
pictures and reminisce about
overseas excursions over a
relaxed continental dinner.

BRAVO FONO

Stanford Shopping Center

It Let's Co to Europe could
recommend European cafes in
the States, Bravo Fono at Stan
ford Shopping Center would
receive a "moto bene."
Italian social life centers at
the cate — it is a place to meet,
rest and enjoy the culinary
wizardry of European chefs. If
you have been overseas and
thought you could never find
some of the tastes and atmo
sphere you have enjoyed in
Florence, Paris, or even Hun
gary; or if you want the
pleasures without traveling
10,000 miles, Bravo Fono will
satisfy your palate and your
eye. Like the cafes in Europe,
once you visit you will soon
frequent it and become part of
the social atmosphere of the
cafe.
Bravo Fono is tucked behind
I. Magnin's near Nivens at the
shopping center. One practi
cally needs Thomas Cooke
navigating skills to find the
place, yet it is jammed all af
ternoon. It's comforting to
know the reputation preceeds

the place. The manager was
proud to tell us that one
couple comes all the way from
Marin each week to their fa
vorite cafe.
The cafe may be known to
students only as a Gelateria,
an Italian ice cream vendor.
Although their ice cream is
rated No. 1 in the Bay Area
gelaterias, perhaps it should
be considered as a grand
finale to an Italian entree,
pasta specialitv or light lunch.
Upon entering, one may not
recognize the decor as Italian.
No red, white and green flags
wave at the doorway, no
decorative baskets are filled
with Italian breads and no
framed prints of Italian
scenery adorn the walls. A
trained eye might recognize
the interior from the pages of
Architectural Digest, but all
will be impressed with the
"nuevo modern" design. The
display counter resembles a
disco — large radius curves
highlighted by running neon
light strips. One wall is entire
ly glass brick, half the roof is
glass and all the corners
rounded. Bare trees twinkle
with white Christmas lights.
Interior designers flock to
the cafe, so if you see a similar

design elsewhere you will
know its origin. All the equip
ment is European, from the ice
cream spatulas to the ice
cream makers. You can also sit
in the outdoor terrace and sip
an authentic Italian soda
(syrup and soda water). Be
cause Bravo Fono offers take
outs, there is constant bus
tling and a blur of background
noise. It is lively but not partic
ularly distracting, unless you
are planning to whisper
French sweet nothings to your
dinner guest.
The aim is to be unique, but
the decor is not the cafe's only
claim to uniqueness. I find it
unique that an Italian/French
cuisine cafe is owned by a
Hungarian. Bravo Fono is a
spin-off of Paprika Fono in
Ghirardelli Square, a Hun
garian restaurant. The Hun
garian tradition followed to
Stanford and originally the
cafe served only small con
tinental entrees and Hun
garian dishes.
