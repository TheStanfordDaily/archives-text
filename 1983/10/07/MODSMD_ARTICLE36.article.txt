SANDY'S KITCHEN
153 Stanford Shopping Center

I Sandy's Kitchen, a coffee shop located
from Macy's in the Stanford Shop
japing Center, offers its customers a clean res-
Raurant and good food.
112 While most people elect to sit at one of
■the 15 tables, others choose to eat their meal
Rat the large counter. Because I sat at the
■counter, I had the opportunity of watching
■ the chef prepare my meal at the open grill, a
■ unique characteristic of Sandy's.
I hose people who desire to eat at Sandy's
I should remember that this particular restau-
K rant is only a coffee shop. For this reason, I
I do not suggest trying the Welsh rarebit. As
I Amy, rny efficient and polite waitress, ex
| plained, "People should not order dinners
| or the complex foods; instead, they should
order hamburgers, eggs and other simple
dishes that one usually finds in a coffee
| shop." While I cannot comment on the
quality of Sandy's rarebit, chicken or spag
hetti dinners, I can say that I found both the
eggs and hamburgers quite good.
One look at the menu shows the custom
er that Sandy's believes in variety. Not only
does Sandy's serve a regular hamburger for
the reasonable price of $2.55, but the restau

rant also prepares a teriyaki burger (though
not as good as The Rusty Harpoon's teriyaki
burger on Maui's Kaanapali beach) for $2.95,
While Sandy's does serve a country break
fast that consists of three pancakes, three
strips of bacon or sausage, one egg and cof
fee for $4.25, which I believe is quite ex
pensive, the restaurant also offers two
breakfast specials from 7:30 to 10:30 a.m.,
Monday through Friday. One special con
sists of one egg, two pieces of bacon, hash
browns, toast and coffee for a reasonable
price of $3.10. The other special consists of
three pancakes or French toast, one egg and
coffee for a respectable price of $2.75.
Sandy's, a fine restaurant which has
served the Palo Alto area for over 26 years,
offers its customers quality breakfasts, good
hamburgers, clean facilities, good service
and reasonable prices.
I often use two criteria to accurately judge
the quality of a restaurant. First, I examine
the actual quantity of people that eat at the
restaurant. Secondly, I observe to see if
these customers are satisfied with their ser
vice and food. My waitress explained to me
that many people hang out at Sandy's during
all hours of the day. For this reason and
through mv own personal observation, I
conclude that Sandy's satisfies its customers
and maintains a strong regular clientele.
