The Perfect Recipe in Stan

combines an attractive atmo

vide Stanford students with a
pleasant and convenient place
to enjoy a light lunch or din

Although The Perfect Recipe

For the more traditional, the restaurant
boasts a Kosher-style hot pastrami sand
wich. One, however, should only reluc
tantly order pastrami at a restaurant that
places flowers in little Perrier bottles.

originally offered indoor and
outdoor dining, the restaurant
was recently remodeled so
that it is all enclosed. The Per
fect Recipe, however, did not

lose vegetation for lack of sun
light. It is generously ap
pointed with various plants
which help to establish the
restaurant's airy and relaxing
atmosphere. The tables are ar
ranged to promote intimate
dining and the restaurant's
decor is punctuated at each
table with small flowers.

The salads looked large and,
with the exception of the
vegetable salad, are usually or
dered as a main course. They
run from $3.75 to $4.75. The
quiches are served not as a
slice, but as an individual
quiche. The quiches cost $4.50
and appeared filling.
The soups were the high
light of the meal. When this
reviewer dined, The Perfect
Recipe daily specials were
Minestrone and Tamale. The
bowls for $1.45 were large por
tions and were prepared ex
cellently. The Minestrone was
slightly spicy and contained
large chunks of potatoes with
an abundance of pasta and
beans. The Tamale was the big
winner. It was made of corn,
zucchini and other vegetables
in a rich tomato broth topped
with a dab of sour cream. Both
soups were smothered with

delicious croutons and
parmesan cheese.
The Perfect Recipe also of
fers a variety of light sand
wiches. These concoctions are
all from owner Bob Jacobson's
personal recipes and are a bit
off-the-wall. For instance, the
turkey, cream cheese and
sprouts combination had a
tendency to cement on the
roof of this reviewer's mouth.
(But I am told some people en
joy that.) For the more tradi
tional, the restaurant boasts a
Kosher-style hot pastrami
sandwich. One, however,
should only reluctantly order
pastrami at a restaurant that
places flowers in little Perrier
bottles. The most popular
sandwiches are the baby
shrimp with dill dressing and
the Danish ham. The sand
wiches cost $4.25 and are on
the small side.
Pastries are a big plus for
The Perfect Recipe. The res

taurant offers a wide assort
ment, from carrot cake to
chocolate mousse tort. The
moist, homemade poppy seed
bread for $.95 was excellent as
was the very rich cheesecake
for $1.75. Patrons can wash
down these desserts with a
dizzying array of teas and cof
fees. The restaurant, in addi
tion, sells these teas and cof
fees at retail for those who
wish to enjoy them at home.
Soup, sandwich, dessert
and beverage for two people
totaled $23 including tip. This
might be beyond the budgets
of many Stanford students. A
student, to stay within his or
her means, might simplv order
soup and dessert. The restau
rant is open until 11 p m.
Wednesday through Friday
and until 5:30 p.m. on
weekends. The Perfect Recipe
also features a new Sunday
brunch from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
