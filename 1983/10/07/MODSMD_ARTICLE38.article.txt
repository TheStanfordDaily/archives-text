Fridays at noon and five
Editorial board meets today at noon. Members
should remember to come prepared with questions
for Rep. Ed Zschau. All staffers should come to the
staff meeting at 4:30, followed by a melancholy hour
at five. Kristen has promised to solemnly serve you
know-what and tonic. Non-you-know-what al
ternatives will also be served.
