# Religious studies prof, filing tenure grievance
## 
### REBECCA SPEER 
Diana Paul, the assistant professor of religious
studies who was denied tenure early this year, is
filing a formal grievance with the Religious
Studies Department in hopes of reopening her
case.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, who is acting as
Paul's chief adviser, said this week that he
believes "the Religious Studies Department
committed serious procedural errors in review
ing Diana Paul's case."
Religious Studies Department Chairman Van
Harvey is forbidden by University law to com
ment on the case. He stresses, however, that he
plans to investigate the validity of Paul's griev
ance in order to ensure that her case is handled
"fairly and justly."
Rebholz questioned the appropriateness of
the 11 referees called upon by the department
to evaluate Paul's work. The opinions of these
outside referees, whose own work should lie
within Diana Paul's field of interest, are taken
into consideration by the five-member religious
studies "personnel committee" which decides
tenure appointments for the department.

Rebholz said that the department wrongly
defined Paul's field as "Chinese thought and re
ligion," rather than her more focused field of
"Chinese Buddism," when searching the nation
for the evaluators.
Rebholz also attacked the department's evalu
ation of Paul's teaching. Though she earned a
vote of "very good" for her teaching of such
popular undergraduate courses as "Buddism,"
Rebholz says the department put much greater
weight on Paul's graduate teaching, which is far
less frequent and which involves fewer students
than her undergraduate teaching.
In addition, of the few graduate students who
were interviewed by the department, most gave
evaluations of the undergraduate courses they
had taken from Paul.
Rebholz also claimed Paul received the wrong
timetable for the tenure review. This resulted in
the submission by Paul of an unrevised manu
script to the outside referees.
Rebholz added that the department omitted
several important documents, such as the
reviews of two of her books, from the material
the outside referees examined, and that it failed

to include her record of service to the Univer
sity which includes five years as a resident fel
low in Wilbur's Soto House, from the review.
Rebholz also said that, considering Paul is
both a woman and a member of a minority
group (she is partly Japanese), "the department
has not satisfied standards of special care called
for by the faculty affirmative action report."
Rebholz did not accuse the department of
blatant sexual discrimination, though he did
point to its possible "unconscious sexual bias."
"On the surface," Rebholz said, "there seems
to be no sexual discrimination, but one cannot
ignore the fact that there are no tenured women
in the department."
Rebholz emphasized that he is merely in pur
suit of a fair review of Paul, whom he praises.
"While I have not observed Diana Paul in the
classroom," Rebholz said, "I have observed her
in informal talks in my residence in Trancos, and
in my opinion, she is not an excellent but an
outstanding teacher; she has the competence
to make complex issues clear to freshmen with
out downplaying the complexity of those is
sues."
