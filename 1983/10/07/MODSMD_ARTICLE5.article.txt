# ABC producer says Poland crisis hurt youth most
## 
### LAURA ALBORNOZ 
The Polish government will have a
difficult time regaining the confi
dence of the young people there,
according to Margery Upton, an
ABC field producer who was sta
tioned in Poland during the past two
and a half years.
"The young believed in Solidarity.
They saw themselves in the future of
the union," Lipton told more than
60 people at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center yesterday.
Lipton said the young were hard
est hit by the imposition of martial
law almost two years ago and that
she does not see how the govern
ment of Poland can ever regain their
confidence.
lipton, who is currently a Profes
sional Journalism Fellow here, said
the reason that Solidarity was so
popular throughout Poland, espe
cially with the younger generation,

is because Solidarity offered hope
for change in the system, and the
young could realistically see them
selves as a part of the union rather
than a part of the Communist party.
Although the lecture was entitled
Considering Poland and its Future,
the informal speech and discussion
centered around Liplon's personal
experiences in what she described
as a complex and long-suffering
country.
According to Lipton, people
will continue to muddle on until the
next period of unrest. Yet, they will
continue to hope.
The people of Poland are loyal
and nationalistic, and they are also
adaptable, Lipton said. The church
unites the people and although food
lines may be incredibly long, and
store shelves may be empty, the
Polish people have a strong sense of
national unity, according to Lipton.

"lhe government may be doing
terrible things, but they're Poles,"
Lipton said. "Young people think
about leaving, but loyalty to their
country prevents them."

Lipton said the imposition of mar
tial law in Poland and the breakup of
Solidarity left the country in confu
sion and horror.
"Hope had died and people were
scared," she said.
The night martial law was instated
militia trucks covered the roads,
people were left with no phones,
and there were rumors of arrests.
The country was left in chaos until
the following morning when
laruzelski announced officially that
martial law had been declared.
She said Poland's main problem is
its geographic location; it is situated
between the Soviet Union and East
Germany, and Soviet control of
Poland is inescapable. According to
Lipton, three Soviet military divi
sions are stationed in Poland and 20
in East Germany which binds the
communist influence in Poland.
