CIA gave planes to Pastora
Washington — The Central Intelligence Agency pro
vided anti-Sandinista rebels with at least one of the
planes used in bombing raids inside Nicaragua last
month, intelligence sources said.
One source said it was a CIA-supplied plane,
piloted by two Nicaraguan rebels, that crashed at the
base of the control tower at Managua's international
airport during a Sept. tt bombing raid. Another
source said the CIA has provided five light planes to
the Costa Rican-based forces of former Sandinista
hero' Eden Pastora, who claimed responsibility tor
the airport raid.
Although CIA "covert" support for Honduran
based, Nicaraguan counter-revolutionaries has been

known lor months, Pastora's source of arms and
money has remained shrouded in secrecy. Pastora,
who broke with the Sandinista government 18
months ago, has repeatedly refused to sav where he
gets his support.
CIA spokesman Dale Peterson said yesterday"it is
not our policy to comment on such allegations."
Three U.S. intelligence sources who confirmed
the existence of U.S. aid to Pastora spoke on condi
tion they not be identified.
One said that only the plane that crashed at the
airport killing the two rebels on board came from
the CIA, and that other planes used by Pastora's
forces were provided bv the rightist Salvadoran go
vernment without U.S. involvement.
However, another source, who has access to the
ledger listing CIA aid to Pastora, said the CIA
supplied him three two-engine Cessnas and two

one-engine Cessnas. He added that the agency also
provides Pastora's rebels with "the normal comple
ment of arms" that go to the Honduras.
Watt may resign
Washington — A White House spokesman said yes
terday thp Senate is "welcome" to vote on whether
James Watt should be tired, but President Reagan
will not feel bound by it. Another source said the
interior secretary will resign, however, rather than
be repudiated on Capitol Hill.
This administration official, who spoke on condi
tion that he not be named, said Watt probably will
step down in the next two weeks, in light of what
looms as a lopsided margin against him in the
Republican-controlled Senate.
"Rather than be repudiated in a Senate vote, he
will resign," the source said.

Deputy White House press secretary Larry
Speakes, meanwhile, insisted that Watt has not been
asked to resign. But Speakes refused to say whether
Watt is still an effective cabinet member. "He's on
vacation right now," he said.
Speakes, in discussing the pending Senate vote,
said "We'd prefer that it not come up. We'd prefer
that the Cabinet secretary be allowed to do his job."
Asked if President Reagan would seek Watt's
resignation if the Senate demands it, Speakes said
"the president would certainly welcome a Senate
expression of its views of anything, but it would not
be binding."
For his part, Watt was described by aides as enjoy
ing his California vacation in the rolling hills above
Santa Barbara.
