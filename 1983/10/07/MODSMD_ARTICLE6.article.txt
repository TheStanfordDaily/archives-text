CIA gave planes to Pastora
Washington — The Central Intelligence Agency pro
vided anti-Sandinista rebels with at least one of the
planes used in bombing raids inside Nicaragua last
month, intelligence sources said.
One source said it was a CIA-supplied plane,
piloted by two Nicaraguan rebels, that crashed at the
base of the control tower at Managua's international
airport during a Sept. tt bombing raid. Another
source said the CIA has provided five light planes to
the Costa Rican-based forces of former Sandinista
hero' Eden Pastora, who claimed responsibility tor
the airport raid.
Although CIA "covert" support for Honduran
based, Nicaraguan counter-revolutionaries has been

known lor months, Pastora's source of arms and
money has remained shrouded in secrecy. Pastora,
who broke with the Sandinista government 18
months ago, has repeatedly refused to sav where he
gets his support.
CIA spokesman Dale Peterson said yesterday"it is
not our policy to comment on such allegations."
Three U.S. intelligence sources who confirmed
the existence of U.S. aid to Pastora spoke on condi
tion they not be identified.
One said that only the plane that crashed at the
airport killing the two rebels on board came from
the CIA, and that other planes used by Pastora's
forces were provided bv the rightist Salvadoran go
vernment without U.S. involvement.
However, another source, who has access to the
ledger listing CIA aid to Pastora, said the CIA
supplied him three two-engine Cessnas and two

one-engine Cessnas. He added that the agency also
provides Pastora's rebels with "the normal comple
ment of arms" that go to the Honduras.
Watt may resign
Washington — A White House spokesman said yes
terday thp Senate is "welcome" to vote on whether
James Watt should be tired, but President Reagan
will not feel bound by it. Another source said the
interior secretary will resign, however, rather than
be repudiated on Capitol Hill.
This administration official, who spoke on condi
tion that he not be named, said Watt probably will
step down in the next two weeks, in light of what
looms as a lopsided margin against him in the
Republican-controlled Senate.
"Rather than be repudiated in a Senate vote, he
will resign," the source said.

Deputy White House press secretary Larry
Speakes, meanwhile, insisted that Watt has not been
asked to resign. But Speakes refused to say whether
Watt is still an effective cabinet member. "He's on
vacation right now," he said.
Speakes, in discussing the pending Senate vote,
said "We'd prefer that it not come up. We'd prefer
that the Cabinet secretary be allowed to do his job."
Asked if President Reagan would seek Watt's
resignation if the Senate demands it, Speakes said
"the president would certainly welcome a Senate
expression of its views of anything, but it would not
be binding."
For his part, Watt was described by aides as enjoy
ing his California vacation in the rolling hills above
Santa Barbara.
Israel violated pact, Lebanon says
Beirut, Lebanon — Prime Minister Shafik Wazzan
accused Israel yesterday of a "flagrant violation" of
the May 17 troop withdrawal accord and indicated
Lebanon might scrap the pact.
In southern Lebanon, meanwhile, an Israeli
backed militia commander switched on the ignition
of his car, setting of a bomb that killed him and
critically wounded his wife in a towering ball of
flame.
The victim, ' sein Wahbe, a Shiite Moslem,
headed the Is upported militia known as the
National Guard in Adloun, ■iO miles south of Beirut,
israeli forces sealed off the town and arrested 40
members of the Shiite Amal militia, which has
vowed to punish anv collaborator with Israel.
Wazzan, in a statement to reporters broadcast
nationwide, accused Israel of violating the pullout
agreement by its partial withdrawal of troops from
the Chouf and Aley Mountains Sept. 4.
"Israel has violated this agreement by staging its
sudden, partial withdrawal, which caused the very
massive misery and destruction that we sought to
avert by speeding up the negotiations to conclude
the accord," Wazzan charged.
Because of this "flagrant violation of the agree
ment, we will not rule out a reconsideration of the
accord," he said.
Wazzan added that the Lebanese government has
never exchanged ratified treaty documents with Is
rael because "we reached a stage where we felt the
accord would not yield the fruits we hoped it would
produce."
Soviets may deploy SS-21s in Syria
Washington — The Soviet Union is apparently
preparing to deploy to Syria surface-to-surface
missiles which would represent a significant new
threat to Israel, U.S. intelligence sources said yester
day.
These sources, speaking on condition they not be
identified, said there is evidence the Soviets will
probably send to Svria the 75-mile range SS-21,
which never betore has been deployed outside of
the Warsaw Pact region in Europe.
Senior defense officials have said the SS-21 is part
ot a new generation of Soviet surface-to-surface
missiles which can carrv high explosives or nuclear
warheads. If the Soviets were to station SS-21s in
southern Syria, such weapons could cover targets in
Israel. SS-21s could also pose a threat to Lebanon.

The SS-21 was described in a Pentagon report ear
lier this year as a mobile missile, carried on a six
wheeled transporter-launcher.
Designed to replace an earlier type ot
surface-to-surface missile called FROG-7, the SS-21
was said by the Pentagon to be more accurate, "thus
enabling greater targeting flexibility and deeper
strikes" than previously possible.
Following Syria's battlefield setbacks at the hands
of Israeli forces in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon last
year, the Soviet Union replaced all of Syria's losses
in planes, tanks and other equipment, according to
U.S. intelligence sources.
Going beyond replacement, the Soviets installed
SAM-5 surface-to-air missiles never before deployed
in the Middle East and sent military personnel to
operate those missiles, intelligence officials said.
The Soviets provided an integrated air defense
system tor the Syrians and erected a complex
through which Soviet military advisers in Syria could
communicate di recti y with Soviet military
headquarters in Moscow.
Walesa award embarrasses regime
Warsaw, Poland — "It would have been easier to
understand last year," a Polish official said, wonder
in his voice. "His activities since are not very typical
for anyone to be nominated for a peace prize."
The perplexed official was, of course, talking
about Lech Walesa, head of the banned Solidarity
independent trade union and 1983 winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize.
And his bemusement more than 24 hours after the
surprise announcement in Oslo was understan
dable, western and Polish analysts agreed here yes
terday.
The award is clearly embarrassing for a
government which has been doing its best to dis
credit the unionist. But more importantly, it is a
serious practical complication at a time when the
leadership confronts important tests of both its
domestic and foreign policies.
Next week, Gen. Wojciech laruzelski's team faces
its first full meeting of the ruling Communist Party
Central Committee since martial law was lifted in
July. Polish sources said hard-line critics of his
policies may use the Nobel award as ammunition
against him.
Golding wins Nobel Prize
Stockholm, Sweden — British writer William Golding,
whose novels, including Lord of the Flies, depict the
savage side of human nature, won the 1983 Nobel
Prize in literature yesterday.
The Swedish Nobel Committee cited Golding's

novels lor their clarity, diversity and "universality of
myth" that "illuminates the human condition in the
world today."
London Times literary editor Philip Howard called
Golding one of the three great living British
novelists, along with Graham Greene and Anthony
Burgess. He is a very powerful novelist and it's a
good award," Howard said "I don't always feel that
about the Nohel Prize, but I do this time."
"I really am delighted," Golding said by telephone
from his cottage in Wiltshire, England.
Pointing out that it was the tirst Nobel literature
award to a Briton since Winston Churchill won in
195.1, he said "In a sense one can say I'm in ex
traordinary company ... I have enough old
fashioned patriotism to be glad not just for mvselt
but because the prize has been won after 10 years by
an Englishman."
Golding, 72, wrote stories from the time he was
seven, but did not begin his professional writing
career until he was 41, with the publication of his
best-known newel Lord of the Flies.
New York's Cardinal Cooke dies
New York — Cardinal Terence Cooke, Roman Catho
lie archbishop of New York since 1968 and a leader
in the church's moral and legislative efforts against
abortion, died yesterday morning of leukemia at the
age of 62.
When it was announced 41 days ago that he was
terminally ill, Cooke elected to spend his last days at
his official residence behind St. Patrick's Cathedral.
Cooke suffered a setback Tuesday, but as he grew
weak a spokesman said the cardinal wanted "his
suffering to be a beautiful gift for others."
The cardinal had received chemotherapy and
blood transfusions over the last eight years for can
cer of the lymph system, but he decided against in
creased chemotherapy to treat his leukemia because
of his feeling that it would detract from the dignity of
life.
Cooke spoke of the "gift of life" in a letter to be
read at all masses in the 1.8 million-member
archdiocese this Sunday in connection with annual
"pro-life" observances. Cooke headed the U.S. Bis
hops' Committee for Pro-Life Activities for 10 years.
Life "is no less beautiful when it is accompanied by
illness or weakness, hunger or poverty, mental or
physical handicaps, loneliness or old age," he
wrote.
Pope John Paul II personally announced Cooke's
death to 200 prelates assembled at the Vatican for a
month-long synod of bishops, then led them in
prayer. In a telegram to Archbishop ]ohn Roach,
president of the U.S. Bishops Conference, the Pope
praised Cooke for his "pastoral charity and apostolic
zeal."

the Oakland Unified School District and the striking
Oakland Education Association (OEA). However,
after a short meeting with Wilson, it was announced

the face."
Harold Boyd, executive director of the OEA,
representing 3500 teachers, librarians, nurses, coun
selors, psychologists and substitutes, especially as
sailed district determination to eliminate teacher
preparation periods and change class size maxi
mums.
"They really are not serious about having our

said ot district negotiators. "The latest district offer
is a slap in the face to the students of Oakland."

in the church's moral and legislative efforts against
abortion, died yesterday morning of leukemia at the
age of 62.

archdiocese this Sunday in connection with annual
"pro-life" observances. Cooke headed the U.S. Bis

death to 200 prelates assembled at the Vatican for a
month-long synod of bishops, then led them in

CIA gave planes to Pastora
Washington — The Central Intelligence Agency pro
vided anti-Sandinista rebels with at least one of the
planes used in bombing raids inside Nicaragua last
month, intelligence sources said.
One source said it was a CIA-supplied plane,
piloted by two Nicaraguan rebels, that crashed at the
base of the control tower at Managua's international
airport during a Sept. tt bombing raid. Another
source said the CIA has provided five light planes to
the Costa Rican-based forces of former Sandinista
hero' Eden Pastora, who claimed responsibility tor
the airport raid.
Although CIA "covert" support for Honduran
based, Nicaraguan counter-revolutionaries has been

known lor months, Pastora's source of arms and
money has remained shrouded in secrecy. Pastora,
who broke with the Sandinista government 18
months ago, has repeatedly refused to sav where he
gets his support.
CIA spokesman Dale Peterson said yesterday"it is
not our policy to comment on such allegations."
Three U.S. intelligence sources who confirmed
the existence of U.S. aid to Pastora spoke on condi
tion they not be identified.
One said that only the plane that crashed at the
airport killing the two rebels on board came from
the CIA, and that other planes used by Pastora's
forces were provided bv the rightist Salvadoran go
vernment without U.S. involvement.
However, another source, who has access to the
ledger listing CIA aid to Pastora, said the CIA
supplied him three two-engine Cessnas and two

one-engine Cessnas. He added that the agency also
provides Pastora's rebels with "the normal comple
ment of arms" that go to the Honduras.
Watt may resign
Washington — A White House spokesman said yes
terday thp Senate is "welcome" to vote on whether
James Watt should be tired, but President Reagan
will not feel bound by it. Another source said the
interior secretary will resign, however, rather than
be repudiated on Capitol Hill.
This administration official, who spoke on condi
tion that he not be named, said Watt probably will
step down in the next two weeks, in light of what
looms as a lopsided margin against him in the
Republican-controlled Senate.
"Rather than be repudiated in a Senate vote, he
will resign," the source said.

Deputy White House press secretary Larry
Speakes, meanwhile, insisted that Watt has not been
asked to resign. But Speakes refused to say whether
Watt is still an effective cabinet member. "He's on
vacation right now," he said.
Speakes, in discussing the pending Senate vote,
said "We'd prefer that it not come up. We'd prefer
that the Cabinet secretary be allowed to do his job."
Asked if President Reagan would seek Watt's
resignation if the Senate demands it, Speakes said
"the president would certainly welcome a Senate
expression of its views of anything, but it would not
be binding."
For his part, Watt was described by aides as enjoy

Israel violated pact, Lebanon says
Beirut, Lebanon — Prime Minister Shafik Wazzan
accused Israel yesterday of a "flagrant violation" of
the May 17 troop withdrawal accord and indicated
Lebanon might scrap the pact.
In southern Lebanon, meanwhile, an Israeli
backed militia commander switched on the ignition
of his car, setting of a bomb that killed him and
critically wounded his wife in a towering ball of
flame.
The victim, ' sein Wahbe, a Shiite Moslem,
headed the Is upported militia known as the
National Guard in Adloun, ■iO miles south of Beirut,
israeli forces sealed off the town and arrested 40
members of the Shiite Amal militia, which has
vowed to punish anv collaborator with Israel.
Wazzan, in a statement to reporters broadcast
nationwide, accused Israel of violating the pullout
agreement by its partial withdrawal of troops from
the Chouf and Aley Mountains Sept. 4.
"Israel has violated this agreement by staging its
sudden, partial withdrawal, which caused the very
massive misery and destruction that we sought to
avert by speeding up the negotiations to conclude
the accord," Wazzan charged.
Because of this "flagrant violation of the agree
ment, we will not rule out a reconsideration of the
accord," he said.
Wazzan added that the Lebanese government has
never exchanged ratified treaty documents with Is
rael because "we reached a stage where we felt the
accord would not yield the fruits we hoped it would
produce."
Soviets may deploy SS-21s in Syria
Washington — The Soviet Union is apparently
preparing to deploy to Syria surface-to-surface
missiles which would represent a significant new
threat to Israel, U.S. intelligence sources said yester
day.
These sources, speaking on condition they not be
identified, said there is evidence the Soviets will
probably send to Svria the 75-mile range SS-21,
which never betore has been deployed outside of
the Warsaw Pact region in Europe.
Senior defense officials have said the SS-21 is part
ot a new generation of Soviet surface-to-surface
missiles which can carrv high explosives or nuclear
warheads. If the Soviets were to station SS-21s in
southern Syria, such weapons could cover targets in
Israel. SS-21s could also pose a threat to Lebanon.

The SS-21 was described in a Pentagon report ear
lier this year as a mobile missile, carried on a six
wheeled transporter-launcher.
Designed to replace an earlier type ot
surface-to-surface missile called FROG-7, the SS-21
was said by the Pentagon to be more accurate, "thus
enabling greater targeting flexibility and deeper
strikes" than previously possible.
Following Syria's battlefield setbacks at the hands
of Israeli forces in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon last
year, the Soviet Union replaced all of Syria's losses
in planes, tanks and other equipment, according to
U.S. intelligence sources.
Going beyond replacement, the Soviets installed
SAM-5 surface-to-air missiles never before deployed
in the Middle East and sent military personnel to
operate those missiles, intelligence officials said.
The Soviets provided an integrated air defense
system tor the Syrians and erected a complex
through which Soviet military advisers in Syria could
communicate di recti y with Soviet military
headquarters in Moscow.
Walesa award embarrasses regime
Warsaw, Poland — "It would have been easier to
understand last year," a Polish official said, wonder
in his voice. "His activities since are not very typical
for anyone to be nominated for a peace prize."
The perplexed official was, of course, talking
about Lech Walesa, head of the banned Solidarity
independent trade union and 1983 winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize.
And his bemusement more than 24 hours after the
surprise announcement in Oslo was understan
dable, western and Polish analysts agreed here yes
terday.
The award is clearly embarrassing for a
government which has been doing its best to dis
credit the unionist. But more importantly, it is a
serious practical complication at a time when the
leadership confronts important tests of both its
domestic and foreign policies.
Next week, Gen. Wojciech laruzelski's team faces
its first full meeting of the ruling Communist Party
Central Committee since martial law was lifted in
July. Polish sources said hard-line critics of his
policies may use the Nobel award as ammunition
against him.
Golding wins Nobel Prize
Stockholm, Sweden — British writer William Golding,
whose novels, including Lord of the Flies, depict the
savage side of human nature, won the 1983 Nobel
Prize in literature yesterday.
The Swedish Nobel Committee cited Golding's

novels lor their clarity, diversity and "universality of
myth" that "illuminates the human condition in the
world today."
London Times literary editor Philip Howard called
Golding one of the three great living British
novelists, along with Graham Greene and Anthony
Burgess. He is a very powerful novelist and it's a
good award," Howard said "I don't always feel that
about the Nohel Prize, but I do this time."
"I really am delighted," Golding said by telephone
from his cottage in Wiltshire, England.
Pointing out that it was the tirst Nobel literature
award to a Briton since Winston Churchill won in
195.1, he said "In a sense one can say I'm in ex
traordinary company ... I have enough old
fashioned patriotism to be glad not just for mvselt
but because the prize has been won after 10 years by
an Englishman."
Golding, 72, wrote stories from the time he was

ot a new generation of Soviet surface-to-surface
missiles which can carrv high explosives or nuclear
warheads. If the Soviets were to station SS-21s in
southern Syria, such weapons could cover targets in
Israel. SS-21s could also pose a threat to Lebanon.

The SS-21 was described in a Pentagon report ear
lier this year as a mobile missile, carried on a six
wheeled transporter-launcher.
Designed to replace an earlier type ot
surface-to-surface missile called FROG-7, the SS-21
was said by the Pentagon to be more accurate, "thus
enabling greater targeting flexibility and deeper
strikes" than previously possible.
Following Syria's battlefield setbacks at the hands
of Israeli forces in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon last
year, the Soviet Union replaced all of Syria's losses
in planes, tanks and other equipment, according to
U.S. intelligence sources.
Going beyond replacement, the Soviets installed
SAM-5 surface-to-air missiles never before deployed
in the Middle East and sent military personnel to
operate those missiles, intelligence officials said.
The Soviets provided an integrated air defense
system tor the Syrians and erected a complex
through which Soviet military advisers in Syria could
communicate di recti y with Soviet military
headquarters in Moscow.

savage side of human nature, won the 1983 Nobel
Prize in literature yesterday.

but because the prize has been won after 10 years by
an Englishman."

CIA gave planes to Pastora
Washington — The Central Intelligence Agency pro
vided anti-Sandinista rebels with at least one of the
planes used in bombing raids inside Nicaragua last
month, intelligence sources said.
One source said it was a CIA-supplied plane,
piloted by two Nicaraguan rebels, that crashed at the
base of the control tower at Managua's international
airport during a Sept. tt bombing raid. Another
source said the CIA has provided five light planes to
the Costa Rican-based forces of former Sandinista
hero' Eden Pastora, who claimed responsibility tor
the airport raid.
Although CIA "covert" support for Honduran
based, Nicaraguan counter-revolutionaries has been

known lor months, Pastora's source of arms and
money has remained shrouded in secrecy. Pastora,
who broke with the Sandinista government 18
months ago, has repeatedly refused to sav where he
gets his support.
CIA spokesman Dale Peterson said yesterday"it is
not our policy to comment on such allegations."
Three U.S. intelligence sources who confirmed
the existence of U.S. aid to Pastora spoke on condi
tion they not be identified.
One said that only the plane that crashed at the
airport killing the two rebels on board came from
the CIA, and that other planes used by Pastora's
forces were provided bv the rightist Salvadoran go
vernment without U.S. involvement.
However, another source, who has access to the
ledger listing CIA aid to Pastora, said the CIA
supplied him three two-engine Cessnas and two

one-engine Cessnas. He added that the agency also
provides Pastora's rebels with "the normal comple
ment of arms" that go to the Honduras.
Watt may resign
Washington — A White House spokesman said yes
terday thp Senate is "welcome" to vote on whether
James Watt should be tired, but President Reagan
will not feel bound by it. Another source said the
interior secretary will resign, however, rather than
be repudiated on Capitol Hill.
This administration official, who spoke on condi
tion that he not be named, said Watt probably will
step down in the next two weeks, in light of what
looms as a lopsided margin against him in the
Republican-controlled Senate.
"Rather than be repudiated in a Senate vote, he
will resign," the source said.

Deputy White House press secretary Larry
Speakes, meanwhile, insisted that Watt has not been
asked to resign. But Speakes refused to say whether
Watt is still an effective cabinet member. "He's on
vacation right now," he said.
Speakes, in discussing the pending Senate vote,
said "We'd prefer that it not come up. We'd prefer
that the Cabinet secretary be allowed to do his job."
Asked if President Reagan would seek Watt's
resignation if the Senate demands it, Speakes said
"the president would certainly welcome a Senate
expression of its views of anything, but it would not
be binding."
For his part, Watt was described by aides as enjoy
ing his California vacation in the rolling hills above
Santa Barbara.
Israel violated pact, Lebanon says
Beirut, Lebanon — Prime Minister Shafik Wazzan
accused Israel yesterday of a "flagrant violation" of
the May 17 troop withdrawal accord and indicated
Lebanon might scrap the pact.
In southern Lebanon, meanwhile, an Israeli
backed militia commander switched on the ignition
of his car, setting of a bomb that killed him and
critically wounded his wife in a towering ball of
flame.
The victim, ' sein Wahbe, a Shiite Moslem,
headed the Is upported militia known as the
National Guard in Adloun, ■iO miles south of Beirut,
israeli forces sealed off the town and arrested 40
members of the Shiite Amal militia, which has
vowed to punish anv collaborator with Israel.
Wazzan, in a statement to reporters broadcast
nationwide, accused Israel of violating the pullout
agreement by its partial withdrawal of troops from
the Chouf and Aley Mountains Sept. 4.
"Israel has violated this agreement by staging its
sudden, partial withdrawal, which caused the very
massive misery and destruction that we sought to
avert by speeding up the negotiations to conclude
the accord," Wazzan charged.
Because of this "flagrant violation of the agree
ment, we will not rule out a reconsideration of the
accord," he said.
Wazzan added that the Lebanese government has
never exchanged ratified treaty documents with Is
rael because "we reached a stage where we felt the
accord would not yield the fruits we hoped it would
produce."
Soviets may deploy SS-21s in Syria
Washington — The Soviet Union is apparently
preparing to deploy to Syria surface-to-surface
missiles which would represent a significant new
threat to Israel, U.S. intelligence sources said yester
day.
These sources, speaking on condition they not be

probably send to Svria the 75-mile range SS-21,
which never betore has been deployed outside of
