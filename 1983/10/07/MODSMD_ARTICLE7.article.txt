## Recruitment process leads to decrease in GSB applications 
### CLAY CALVERT Staff writer 
The number of applicants
to the Graduate School of
Business has declined tor
the last two years because
of a "more selective and
systematic" recruitment
process, according to Kath
leen Cwynn, the school's
director of admissions.
Cwynn also attributed
the 6 percent decline last
year to a shrinkage in the
number of 22- to 25-year
old candidates, a symptom
of the post baby-boom era.
The new recruitment ef
fort focuses on attempting
to "manage the application
pool," according to
Gwynn, by being more
open with perspective ap
plicants, giving them an

idea ot the competitiveness
of the admissions process.
In particular, re
applicants are given candid
comments on their chances
for acceptance the second
time around.
The recruiting emphasis
has shifted from under
graduates to those who
have been members of the
work force for one to two
years. This change is
retlected in the reduction
of recruitment trips made
to college campuses from
nearly 60 per vear to 35,
Gwynn said.
"We're enrolling only 6
to 9 percent of students
straight out ot college,"
Gwynn said. This is out of a
total of 4,b86 applicants in
1982-83.

To attract those with
work experience, Gwynn
said she and two assistants
now travel to large
metropolitan areas and
hold receptions tor as many
as 100 perspective can
didates.
Gwynn said 502 fewer ap
plicants this year fell into
the "risky" catagory, while
169 more placed in the
"academically viable"
group.
Gwynn characterized the
entering class as being "an
extremely capable,
talented, and diverse group
of students."
The average age for stu
dents in this year's class has
increased from 26.4 years
to 27.
