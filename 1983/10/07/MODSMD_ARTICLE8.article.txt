## Stanford volunteers teach the handicapped to swim 
### SHAUN SKELTON 
What a rare thing in our col
lege lives to have a chance to
help others while learning our
selves! You have given us the
opportunity to gain more in
sight and understanding about
people and the beauty of life
than any book or lecture will
ever approach. Most important
of all you have opened our
eyes to a truth that too few
people ever come to know -
that every human being, be he
blind, retarded or unable to
walk, can find a place to be
happy and to feel a sense of
being loved and worthwhile. —
Excerpt from a letter of thanks
from Betty Wright's first
SWOPSI class.
For the past eight years, the

indefatigable Betty Wright has
inspired over 500 Stanford stu
dents in her overwhelmingly
successful SWOPSI class
"Experienced Based Study on
the Meaning of Being Handi
capped." Now titled Psychol
ogy 185, the class is taught
each quarter through the
Community Association for
Retarded (CAR) swim program
in Palo Alto, a program which
Wright founded.
The amazing sep
tuagenarian has a way of en
veloping students in her un
bridled enthusiasm. From the
specially designed pool to the
smiles of her numerous
pupils, an unmistakable
feeling of good permeates the
entire program. One can easi

ly "get hooked" on the unique
swim center, which involves
therapeutic as well as handi
capped swimming.
The class begins with a short
training course, after which
students teach swimming to
children and adults with men
tal, physical, emotional and
learning handicaps.
Students say the class is no
mick. There are lectures,
reading and a lot of work.
The lectures consist of pre
sentations every Thursday
night by handicapped individ
uals as well as family mem
bers, doctors and profes
sionals in related fields. Em
phasis is placed on their life
experiences rather than pat
hological descriptions of
various handicaps. Group
projects have included every
thing from building a wheel
chair ramp to a major handi
capped accessibility study of
the Stanford campus.
Biology junior Herman Mor
ris, who has volunteered as a
swim instructor during the
past two years, said Wright's
class was excellent. "Most of
the people who spoke were
interesting and very honest. It
broadened my experience a
lot. Stanford students lead a
pretty sheltered life. Everyone
owes it to themselves to try
it."
Due in part to confusion
with the new listing as a psy
chology course instead of its
usual SWOPSI heading, en
rollment in this quarter's class
is uncharacteristically low.
Wright emphasized that it is
not too late to sign up for the
class. Anyone is invited to sit
in on the Thursday night ses
sions or volunteer at the pool,
there is no need to be a stu
i

dent. "We always need volun
teers," stated co-class instruc
tor Calvin Herrick. The swim
program would not exist with
out them." Included in CAR's
long list of Stanford volun
teers is head football coach
Paul Wiggin. CAR swim
director Will Sanford is an '81
Stanford graduate who took
Wright's course in the fall of
his freshman year. "I was
looking for a class that was a
smidge different." He found
CAR "A great break, a chance
to get off campus. When
you've been working with
somebody with a severe dis
ability you realize how little
your Calculus midterm really
matters."
The only skill needed to
work at the center is "a wil
lingness to give of oneself."
Sanford stressed that being a
good swimmer or having tre
mendous patience are not
requisite to becoming an ef
fective instructor. "You need a
sense of humor and the ability
to relax."
Nearly all of the current
swim staff of 14 started their
association with CAR thru
Wright's class. A current part
time staff member, human bi
ology senior Kristi Scheumann
sees her four quarters at CAR
as "fulfilling a need to give to
people. Many feel they won't
become personally involved.
But normal' people get old,
have hip problems and have
children with Down's
syndrome. Working with the
disabled is preparation for
later in life when you will have
to deal with disabilities."
According to junior Patti
McCormac, a current volun
teer who applied her early
work at CAR to her human bi

ology workshop, working with
the handicapped is not always
easy. "It's kind of scary at first.
Sometimes you have to rack

your brain to find something
that interests them. It's great
just to get them to smile. But
when you teach them someth

ing they may be so proud that
they will run and tell
everybody. I always feel good
afterward."

Wright's course in the fall of

looking for a class that was a

CAR "A great break, a chance

you've been working with
somebody with a severe dis
ability you realize how little
your Calculus midterm really
matters."
The only skill needed to
work at the center is "a wil

Sanford stressed that being a
good swimmer or having tre
mendous patience are not
requisite to becoming an ef
fective instructor. "You need a
sense of humor and the ability
to relax."
Nearly all of the current
swim staff of 14 started their
association with CAR thru
Wright's class. A current part
time staff member, human bi
ology senior Kristi Scheumann
sees her four quarters at CAR
as "fulfilling a need to give to
people. Many feel they won't
become personally involved.
But normal' people get old,
have hip problems and have
children with Down's
syndrome. Working with the
disabled is preparation for
later in life when you will have
to deal with disabilities."
According to junior Patti
McCormac, a current volun
teer who applied her early
work at CAR to her human bi

ology workshop, working with
the handicapped is not always
easy. "It's kind of scary at first.
Sometimes you have to rack

your brain to find something
that interests them. It's great
just to get them to smile. But
when you teach them someth

ing they may be so proud that
they will run and tell
everybody. I always feel good
afterward."

What a rare thing in our col
lege lives to have a chance to
help others while learning our
selves! You have given us the
opportunity to gain more in
sight and understanding about
people and the beauty of life
than any book or lecture will
ever approach. Most important
of all you have opened our
eyes to a truth that too few
people ever come to know -
that every human being, be he
blind, retarded or unable to
walk, can find a place to be
happy and to feel a sense of
being loved and worthwhile. —
Excerpt from a letter of thanks
from Betty Wright's first
SWOPSI class.
For the past eight years, the

indefatigable Betty Wright has
inspired over 500 Stanford stu
dents in her overwhelmingly
successful SWOPSI class
"Experienced Based Study on
the Meaning of Being Handi
capped." Now titled Psychol
ogy 185, the class is taught
each quarter through the
Community Association for
Retarded (CAR) swim program
in Palo Alto, a program which
Wright founded.
The amazing sep
tuagenarian has a way of en
veloping students in her un
bridled enthusiasm. From the
specially designed pool to the
smiles of her numerous
pupils, an unmistakable
feeling of good permeates the
entire program. One can easi

ly "get hooked" on the unique
swim center, which involves
therapeutic as well as handi
capped swimming.
The class begins with a short
training course, after which
students teach swimming to
children and adults with men
tal, physical, emotional and
learning handicaps.
Students say the class is no
mick. There are lectures,
reading and a lot of work.
The lectures consist of pre
sentations every Thursday
night by handicapped individ
uals as well as family mem
bers, doctors and profes
sionals in related fields. Em
phasis is placed on their life
experiences rather than pat
hological descriptions of
