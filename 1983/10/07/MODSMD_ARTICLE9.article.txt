Ever since ASSU Special Services lost $92,000
in 1979-80, the University infrastructure for or
ganizing and promoting campus concerts has
been inefficient in the best of times and in
tolerable in the worst. The system has since
undergone more changes than Leonard Zelig,
and yet each new proposal fails to achieve the
most primary goal: to bring big-name musical
talent to campus on a regular basis.
Recognizing the system's deficiencies, Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy recently or
dered a ban on all future concerts here on
campus. We find this a questionable move. If
the purpose of the moratorium is to provide a
chance to work diligently on the creation of an
efficient concert-organizing body, we can — al
beit reluctantly — accept it; if, however, the Uni
versity is simply buying time and is not serious
about remedying this problem soon, we see
the ban as another in a long list of blunders on
the campus concert scene. Assuming the
former, the need for a moratorium still remains
questionable.
Kennedy's office says "security problems"
and "administrative burdens" necessitated the
action. Citing this summer's Grateful Dead
concerts — where 15 were arrested during two
gigs — University and police officials claim safety
problems and the number of man hours spent
in organization and patrol are excessive. And
yet there were only three arrests made at last
Sunday's packed Santana concert, all drug
related.
Clearly this problem merits consideration.
The most recent history of campus concerts
suggests childish politics and competition
among various agencies as well as reams of un
necessary paperwork. Since Special Events fell
into the red, student groups, University
agencies and professional promoters have all
been working — often against each other — to
produce discouragingly few concerts. The
Campus Entertainment Board folded soon after
organization, and the Committee on Campus
Entertainment (CoCE) and the Concert Net
work have worked in irregular spurts.
In addition, professional powers like Bill
Graham Presents have been called in for al
most every concert. The old system forced

Special Events to compete directly with Bill
Graham, landing it in bankruptcy. More
recently, student groups, like the Concert Net
work, would offer a written proposal to
produce a concert to CoCE. If the CoCE ap
proved the group on a basis of financial
stability and feasible planning, the group had
to submit a second form detailing a particular
concert, subject to approval.
Meanwhile, other groups could have been
competing for the same open day at Frost or
Maples. And if a concert ever reached the plan
ning stages, invariably Bill Graham would be
called in to absorb the financial risk.
The use of professional promoters raises the
much bantered-about issue of student involve
ment. Student groups classically want more in
put. They want to organize and promote con
certs independently from the pros. The educa
tional value of undertaking such an endeavor is
undeniable. Yet the risks are greater — who will
foot the bill if a sold-out show turns into a
rained-out one?
Some fear that the University may opt to sti
fle student involvement in order to reduce
"security problems" and "administrative bur
dens." Another fear is that concerts may never
again be staged here; many officials complain
that not enough Stanford students attend them
anyway. What they fail — or refuse — to recognize
is that nearly all the major concerts in the last
year, including Pat Benetar, James Taylor, The
Tubes and The Dead, were scheduled during
school vacations.
The new concert scheme — and there had bet
ter be one or this moratorium may be, as many
suspect, nothing but a big stall — should
combine University representatives and re
sponsible students into one efficient concert
body. We don't need professional promoters;
we can breed our own.
If the University deems this moratorium nec
essary we trust that the end result will be some
thing we all expect and deserve: an efficient
system based on student involvement which
leads to more concerts during the school year.
After all the task forces and committees this
issue has faced, there is no reason why this
simple goal cannot be realized.
