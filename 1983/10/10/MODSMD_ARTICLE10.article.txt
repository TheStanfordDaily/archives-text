# Cologne prof, explains Nazi ideology

### ANGELA GARCIA 
Anti-semitism as a basic concept of Nazi ideology
dominated a Thursday evening speech by Andreas
Hillgruber, professor at the University of Cologne in
Germany.
About 65 people attended the lecture,
"Imperialism and Racism: Basic Concepts of Nazi
Ideology," a talk that prompted one woman to
declare, "I'm a survivor of Cristalnacht (night of
glass) and I've waited 45 years to hear such objective
treatment of the subject."
Hillgruber, a visiting professor here, began her
speech talking about Germany's political history
since the 1880 sand its concentration in imperialism,
but quickly moved onto the subject of anti
semitism.
During the movement of the 70s and 80s, he said,
the anti-semitic sentiment was divided into two
groups: nationalistic and racial. Those with
nationalistic ideals believed that the Jews who had
separated themselves from society should integrate
completely into the German nation, while the
racially-oriented maintained that the Jews were not
real Germans and that they had different blood.
Race-oriented solutions includedthe expulsion of
Jews from Germany and the founding of a Jewish
state or physical extermination of the Jews.

According to Hillgruber, Adolf Hitler became ac
quainted with anti-semitism in Vienna, Austria trom
1907 to 1913. It was then when Hitler developed the
ideas of the breeding of a "blonde master" race, the
killing of so-called "inferiors" and the demand for
complete physical annihilation.
"There can be no compromise with the Jews,'
Hitler wrote in "Mein Kampf."
Several questions followed the speech. Hillgruber
answered in German, which was then translated by
James Sheehan, a Stanford history professor.
When asked how it was possible that a relatively
large number of Germans cooperated in mass mur
der, Hillgruber said that obedience from the people
is almost always taken for granted in events such as
this one.
"There is a problem when leadership changes
drastically," Hillgruber said. Since there were no
negative reactions in Germany to Hitler's policies,
history must devise a rational explanation of the
events, he said.
According to Hillgruber, most Germans had only a
half-knowledge of the mass execution of the Jews,
and almost none knew about Hitler's concentration
camps.
Hillgruber is presently working on a study of Ger
many as a world power.
