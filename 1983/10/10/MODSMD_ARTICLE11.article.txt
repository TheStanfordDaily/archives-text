## Watt resigns ... finally 
### 
The scene: Saturday's football game against
UCLA. The actors: the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band. The time: pre-game.
The subject of the Band's latest pre-game show:
not University President Donald Kennedy, not
UC Berkeley Head Coach Joe Kapp, not an in
nocent gargantuan phallus, not even President
Reagan. The victim? James Watt, the secretary
of the interior.
The Band's show presaged by about 25 hours,
yesterday's announcement that the controver
sial secretary would resign. Though the
connection between the two is dubious, we
applaud the Band's timeliness. We only wish
Watt's letter of resignation had been sent two
years ago.
The national embarrassment some call a sec
retary of the interior has offended the senti
ments of even the most apathetic Americans.
Watt's off-the-cuff remarks about liberals, non-
Christians, native Americans, blacks, Jews, wo
men and the handicapped have slighted, by
our estimation, 85 percent of the population.
The only people who haven't been the target of
Watt's diarrhetic mouth are conservative,
Christian white men who aren't handicapped.
People just like him.
He recently described the members of a
newly appointed coal-leasing commission in
what he thought were glowing terms. "We
have every kind of mix you can have," he said,
"a black ... a woman, two Jews and a cripple."
The remark is only the latest in a series of

diatribes. He has questioned the patriotism of
liberals and described the plight of native
Americans as an example of the failures of
socialism. And these were comments made in
public. We can only imagine how much fun the
secretary had in private with his buddies at the
office, laughing at the poor and putting women
in their place. What a guy.
This is not to mention his policies, which
have outraged environmentalists and made a
sham of the office that once had the purpose of
protecting the environment. He has made
every attempt to allow offshore drilling on the
California coast and his resignation comes in
the wake of an even more embarrassing con
troversy. The above-mentioned commission
was established to investigate charges that
Watt was virtually giving away federal coal
leases by offering them for sale at a time of
slack demand.
Watt's resignation is sobering for us,
however, for a number of reasons. It is not
likely that his replacement, chosen by Presi
dent Reagan, will be much more sympathetic
to environmental protection. And, as a number
of Democrats have pointed out, Watt could
have been one of Reagan's biggest political
liabilities in the president's expected re
election bid.
We can still hope, however, that the secre
tary's departure will mean an end to the bigotry
and environmental short-sightedness that he
represents.
