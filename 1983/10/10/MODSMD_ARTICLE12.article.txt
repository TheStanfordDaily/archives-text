"Cot a nickel?"
That question has become common recent
ly. Too common. Annoying even. And all be
cause of a change some mysterious person
made sometime during the summer.
That person snuck into dorms and offices,
and tinkered with coin slots — and most disturb
ingly changed a 0 to a 5. It takes some time to
discover the hassles accompanying the in
crease to 55 cents for a soft drink, but they
clearly exist.
Although many lamented the increase from
45 to 50 cents for a Coca-Cola, Tab, Mountain
Dew or whatever, at least the new coin combi
nation — two quarters or a quarter plus two
dimes and a nickel — was easy.
But now your mouth gets dry — or maybe you
just need some caffeine — and you start to think,
"A quarter plus three dimes, a quarter plus two
dimes and two nickels," or just the standard,
"Cot a nickel?" Whoever even realized before
that a quarter and three dimes adds up to 55
cents?

The role of a quarter roll has also changed
lately. You used to be able to buy one on Mon
day, purchase two drinks per day (14 used) and
still have enough left late Saturday night for
two loads of wash (four) and one load of drying
(two). But no longer.
And there's a new fear. The drink machines
across campus are notorious already for dis
playing six lights indicating "empty." Now we
creep up to the machine with three quarters or
some other inexact combination scared that
"Exact change only" will be lit in red.
There's guilt too. In the past, many hard
workers would feel greedy and lazy for not
taking some extra steps to go to The Store at
Tresidder Union or a department lounge to get
a bargain thirst-quencher for only 45 cents.
Now that guilt has been doubled.
Rarely has a nickel meant so much. Maybe
someone is trying to remind us of the true
value of five pennies. But that's doubtful.
