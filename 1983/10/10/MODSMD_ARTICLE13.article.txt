# Let time be on your side
## 
### 
Albert Einstein, in his most revolu
tionary contribution to modern
physics, theorized that as you ap
proach the speed of light, time
speeds up. Now, Einstein was a bril
liant man, and I don't claim to be a
physicist, but I really think he
missed a more obvious, and for
most people, more relevant corol
lary of this theory: Time accelerates
not only as you go faster, but as you
get older, too.
Remember when you were a little
kid, and a year lasted forever? Each
one was an epoch, stretching as far
back as you could recall, and ex
tending into the future as a dim vi
sion of next year's birthday
presents. They turned over slowly
and regularly, differentiated only by
the color of the new pants (usually
burgundy or lime-green) your mom
bought you for the school year.
Even in high school, time seemed
to unfold in a sane, predictable way:
Sophomore year slowly followed
treshman year, senior year wouldn't
come for a while, college was a
nebulous four-year grind far off in
the future, and life beyond college
was inconceivable. You played oboe
in the high school band, worked on
the yearbook and studied never
really expecting to graduate.
But you did. And then you came
here. And at that moment, without
your realizing it, time shifted from
second gear into overdrive. Things
probably haven't been the same
since.
The first signs that time was ac
celerating were subtle. Sure, mid
terms caught you a little off balance,
and yes, maybe finals did rush up
and jump you, but that was probably
because you had studied too little,
or more likely, procrastinated too
much. Time wasn't misbehaving.
Besides, being home for the

holidays would surely offer some
respite.
But no. You arrived home, kissed
your mom and dad hello, ate some
turkey, opened some presents,
went sledding (or water-skiing) and
suddenly, two weeks later, arrived
back here, champagne bubbles still
floating in your head. Some break.
Winter quarter began and the rain
flying horizontally into your face as
you raced around campus on your
bicycle only served to confirm your
suspicion that time was speeding
up. And the surprise attacks by mid
term tests and finals - which you had
thought were mere flukes in the fall -
began to assert themselves as dead
ly statistical regularities. Clearly this
was a battle in which time was
gaining the upper hand.
Spring break was a few days of fun
in the sun or snow. Spring quarter
never really existed at all — it was
simply an illusion induced by one
too many parties. Summer came,
and you worked and played your
way through it in a few mad weeks.
The next couple of years went by
as an undistinguishable blur of
faces, places and feelings. You did
an internship in Washington.
"Studied" in Florence. Theoretically
designed a major. Ate Christmas
turkey a couple more times. Now
you're a senior at Stanford and time
stands over you like a great, leering
dentist, saying, "Now, that didn't
take long, did it?"
It's scary, because it really didn't
take long, and you sometimes find
yourself wishing you could stop
time altogether, and make some of
the good times come back. Yet you
know time is only going to speed up
even more. (Somewhat like the den
tist turning up the rpms on his high
speed drill after apologizing for
making it hurt so much.)
At the rate most of us have been
going, we'll be married and settled

in two years, middle-aged in five
and resting in peace in 10. It's like a
mad dash to the finish line of life,
and not a good way to live.
So don't let time hurl you through
life; step out of the tempest once in
a while and see how enjoyable it is
just to watch it go by.
I don't know too many ways to
slow down time, but a good start
might be to watch a sunset from
somewhere in the foothills with a
good friend, a basket of bread and a
bottle of wine. Then, at moments
like this, you may be able to slow
down the rush of time and say,
along with Mick )agger, "time is on
my side."

Remember when you were a little
kid, and a year lasted forever? Each
one was an epoch, stretching as far
back as you could recall, and ex
tending into the future as a dim vi
sion of next year's birthday
presents. They turned over slowly
and regularly, differentiated only by
the color of the new pants (usually
burgundy or lime-green) your mom
bought you for the school year.
Even in high school, time seemed
to unfold in a sane, predictable way:
Sophomore year slowly followed
treshman year, senior year wouldn't
come for a while, college was a
nebulous four-year grind far off in
the future, and life beyond college
was inconceivable. You played oboe
in the high school band, worked on
the yearbook and studied never
really expecting to graduate.
But you did. And then you came
here. And at that moment, without
your realizing it, time shifted from
second gear into overdrive. Things
probably haven't been the same
since.
The first signs that time was ac
celerating were subtle. Sure, mid
terms caught you a little off balance,
and yes, maybe finals did rush up
and jump you, but that was probably
because you had studied too little,
or more likely, procrastinated too
much. Time wasn't misbehaving.
Besides, being home for the

holidays would surely offer some
respite.
But no. You arrived home, kissed
your mom and dad hello, ate some
turkey, opened some presents,
went sledding (or water-skiing) and
suddenly, two weeks later, arrived
back here, champagne bubbles still
floating in your head. Some break.
Winter quarter began and the rain
flying horizontally into your face as
you raced around campus on your
bicycle only served to confirm your
suspicion that time was speeding
up. And the surprise attacks by mid
term tests and finals - which you had
thought were mere flukes in the fall -
began to assert themselves as dead
ly statistical regularities. Clearly this
was a battle in which time was
gaining the upper hand.
Spring break was a few days of fun
in the sun or snow. Spring quarter
never really existed at all — it was
simply an illusion induced by one
too many parties. Summer came,
and you worked and played your
way through it in a few mad weeks.
The next couple of years went by
as an undistinguishable blur of
faces, places and feelings. You did
an internship in Washington.
"Studied" in Florence. Theoretically
designed a major. Ate Christmas
turkey a couple more times. Now
you're a senior at Stanford and time
stands over you like a great, leering
dentist, saying, "Now, that didn't
take long, did it?"
It's scary, because it really didn't
take long, and you sometimes find
yourself wishing you could stop
time altogether, and make some of
the good times come back. Yet you
know time is only going to speed up
even more. (Somewhat like the den
tist turning up the rpms on his high
speed drill after apologizing for
making it hurt so much.)
At the rate most of us have been
going, we'll be married and settled

in two years, middle-aged in five
and resting in peace in 10. It's like a
mad dash to the finish line of life,
and not a good way to live.
So don't let time hurl you through
life; step out of the tempest once in
a while and see how enjoyable it is
just to watch it go by.
I don't know too many ways to
slow down time, but a good start
might be to watch a sunset from
somewhere in the foothills with a
good friend, a basket of bread and a
bottle of wine. Then, at moments
like this, you may be able to slow
down the rush of time and say,
along with Mick )agger, "time is on
my side."
