## Lessons from history apply to Lebanon 
### 
From Sarajevo to the Shout Moun
tains, the 20th century has chafed it
self raw through lessons misapplied.
So awesome has been the carnage,
and seemingly so forseeable, that
each generation has committed it
self to applying the lessons of the
past to its own time. This may be as
it should be. But a lesson misapplied
is no better than a lesson never
learned, and too often this has been
the case.
Consider precedent. In World
War I, leaders relied on the 19th
century idea of the balance of power
to guide their course through a
ghastly introduction to the industrial
world — and war — that they had
created.
A generation later, the United
States kept to its own side of the At
lantic, as it had always done,
unmoved by the pesky European
conflicts half a world away. Another
world war resulted.
Another generation removed,
Washington had finally learned its
lesson, but saw the spectre of
Munich in the face of Ho Chi Minh.
Why Washington chose not to apply
the more relevant lesson of the
French at Dienbienphu is unknown,
but the outcome of its failure is all
too vivid.
Today, such errors continue. The
"lessons'" of Vietnam are now
invoked with every U.S. military
move anywhere, regardless of the
circumstances. This, too, may be as
it should be. Phnom Penh is as fixed
in our childhood imagery as is
Snoopy; it falls to us not to be
queath a similar legacy.
But the allusions threaten to run
afoul of the lessons with regard to
Lebanon. It is essential to apply
what we should have learned from
Vietnam, while not fearing to tread
where that war has no relevance.
Two main "right" lessons apply.
First, in Vietnam, Washington des
cended carefully into a position
from which it could not escape. No
terminal dates were ever set, no es
timate of the cost of victory made,
no contemplation of withdrawal en
tertained. In short, the U.S. had no
long-range plan.
In Lebanon, however, the Ameri
can goal is clear, limited and ac
hievable. The government must be
shored up. Though admittedly con
trolled by a minority of elites, the
government is the only legitimate
coalition of interests in Lebanon,
however unbalanced the coalition
may be. Amin Gemayel is not his
brother: He eschewed the family
"business" in large part because of
the Phalangists' ruthlessness. That
he enjoys wary respect from respon
sible members of all groups attests
to his genuine desire for a united
and free Lebanon.
The second of Vietnam's salient
lessons lies in the need to secure

informed, bipartisan cooperation in
foreign policy. Last week's compro
mise on war powers recognizes the
right of Congress to "bring the boys
home" if the task seems hopeless 18
months hence, while giving Reagan
the room he needs — far removed
from the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution's
"blank check." Moreover, the
media are now eager to report every
error, every danger, every death.
Compared with the ignorant and ac
quiescent press and Congress of the
19605, Lebanon could not be less
like Vietnam in this regard.
Yet as important as applying the
right lessons is avoidance of the
wrong ones. Paramount among
these stands is the untempered con
viction that the use of force is anat
hema to a free state. What non
sense! The lessons of Munich
remain valid despite their misuse in
Indochina. Negotiation must always
be foremost, but it can't always
work alone. In Lebanon, it was not
until the army splintered and the go
vernment could no longer control
the militias or the PLO that civil war
and collapse ensued. When
peacekeeping was tried by the
United Nations, it failed for the lack
of a mandate that allowed the use of
force.
The other wrong lesson is the nag
ging presumption that after Iran,
Vietnam, Angola and others, Wash
ington is incapable of backing the
right side. Again, applicability
depends on circumstances. In
Central America, Reagan is certainly
failing to support progressive
reform or popular groups.
Not so in Lebanon. Washington is
supporting the only government —
the only hope of re-establishing au
thority and of ousting the occupying
neighbors. Cemayel's efforts to get
Israel and Syria out of his country
and to regroup his army speak di
rectly to the continuing causes of
strife. He deserves U.S. support.
The U.S. remains Lebanon's best
hope. It cannot do it alone, cannot
impose a solution. But Lebanon
needs U.S. strength against Syria,
and American influence on Israel.
Even without Soviet designs, no
power in Lebanon would prove pre
dominant if the peacekeepers left,
and partition would loom just a shot
away.
If it is accepted politically that we
must back up our commitments
with force, then Lebanon is worth it,
for it is a prototype of the complex
solution the Middle East itself will
require. If we are not willing to use
force to defy hegemonic encroach
ment and to support well-meaning
governments against certain an
nihilation, then all our strength and
promises are without meaning ex
cept for our own rhetoric.

From Sarajevo to the Shout Moun
tains, the 20th century has chafed it
self raw through lessons misapplied.
So awesome has been the carnage,
and seemingly so forseeable, that
each generation has committed it
self to applying the lessons of the
past to its own time. This may be as
it should be. But a lesson misapplied
is no better than a lesson never
learned, and too often this has been
the case.
Consider precedent. In World
War I, leaders relied on the 19th
century idea of the balance of power
to guide their course through a
ghastly introduction to the industrial
world — and war — that they had
created.
A generation later, the United
States kept to its own side of the At
lantic, as it had always done,
unmoved by the pesky European
conflicts half a world away. Another
world war resulted.
Another generation removed,
Washington had finally learned its
lesson, but saw the spectre of
Munich in the face of Ho Chi Minh.
Why Washington chose not to apply
the more relevant lesson of the
French at Dienbienphu is unknown,
but the outcome of its failure is all
too vivid.
Today, such errors continue. The
"lessons'" of Vietnam are now
invoked with every U.S. military
move anywhere, regardless of the
circumstances. This, too, may be as
it should be. Phnom Penh is as fixed
in our childhood imagery as is
Snoopy; it falls to us not to be
queath a similar legacy.
But the allusions threaten to run
afoul of the lessons with regard to
Lebanon. It is essential to apply
what we should have learned from
Vietnam, while not fearing to tread
where that war has no relevance.
Two main "right" lessons apply.
First, in Vietnam, Washington des
cended carefully into a position
from which it could not escape. No
terminal dates were ever set, no es
timate of the cost of victory made,
no contemplation of withdrawal en
tertained. In short, the U.S. had no
long-range plan.
In Lebanon, however, the Ameri
can goal is clear, limited and ac
hievable. The government must be
shored up. Though admittedly con
trolled by a minority of elites, the
government is the only legitimate
coalition of interests in Lebanon,
however unbalanced the coalition
may be. Amin Gemayel is not his
brother: He eschewed the family
"business" in large part because of
the Phalangists' ruthlessness. That
he enjoys wary respect from respon
sible members of all groups attests
to his genuine desire for a united
and free Lebanon.
The second of Vietnam's salient
lessons lies in the need to secure

informed, bipartisan cooperation in
foreign policy. Last week's compro
mise on war powers recognizes the
right of Congress to "bring the boys
home" if the task seems hopeless 18
months hence, while giving Reagan
the room he needs — far removed
from the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution's
"blank check." Moreover, the
media are now eager to report every
error, every danger, every death.
Compared with the ignorant and ac
quiescent press and Congress of the
19605, Lebanon could not be less
like Vietnam in this regard.
Yet as important as applying the
right lessons is avoidance of the
wrong ones. Paramount among
these stands is the untempered con
viction that the use of force is anat
hema to a free state. What non
sense! The lessons of Munich
remain valid despite their misuse in
Indochina. Negotiation must always
be foremost, but it can't always
work alone. In Lebanon, it was not
until the army splintered and the go
vernment could no longer control
the militias or the PLO that civil war
and collapse ensued. When
peacekeeping was tried by the
United Nations, it failed for the lack
of a mandate that allowed the use of
force.
The other wrong lesson is the nag
ging presumption that after Iran,
Vietnam, Angola and others, Wash
ington is incapable of backing the
right side. Again, applicability
depends on circumstances. In
Central America, Reagan is certainly
failing to support progressive
reform or popular groups.
Not so in Lebanon. Washington is
supporting the only government —
the only hope of re-establishing au
thority and of ousting the occupying
neighbors. Cemayel's efforts to get
Israel and Syria out of his country
and to regroup his army speak di
rectly to the continuing causes of
strife. He deserves U.S. support.
The U.S. remains Lebanon's best
hope. It cannot do it alone, cannot
impose a solution. But Lebanon
needs U.S. strength against Syria,
and American influence on Israel.
Even without Soviet designs, no
power in Lebanon would prove pre
dominant if the peacekeepers left,
and partition would loom just a shot
away.
If it is accepted politically that we
must back up our commitments
with force, then Lebanon is worth it,
for it is a prototype of the complex
solution the Middle East itself will
require. If we are not willing to use
force to defy hegemonic encroach
ment and to support well-meaning
governments against certain an
nihilation, then all our strength and
promises are without meaning ex
cept for our own rhetoric.
