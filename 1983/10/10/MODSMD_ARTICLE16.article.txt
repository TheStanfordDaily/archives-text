Davis missed the mark
"Activist links rape to capitalism"
(Daily, Oct. 5) points out the
glaring misconceptions that
abound today concerning
capitalism. Rape, rather than being
a product of capitalism, can only
be prevented in a purely capitalist
society.
Capitalism is the only system in
the history of man based complete
ly on individual rights. In a
capitalist society, the use of force
by individuals is banned. The only
segment of society permitted to
use force is the government. That
government, however, is limited to
using force for the defense of the
country and to enforce an ob
jective set of laws. Those laws are
determined by the people — the best
system found to do this so far is
democracy — but are subject to the
restriction of the sovereignty of
individual rights.
Thus, rape is outlawed because it
is a total affront to the morality
upon which capitalism is based.
This is the most important point,
and is one which people like An
gela Davis seem to not understand
or conveniently forget.
Rape is the most personal affront
possible to the individual rights of
a woman. A socialist society gives
the power to decide what is
"right" to one group of peop\e al
the expense of another group.
This is the same mentality that
encourages the crime of rape. The
only difference is that in rape one
person is deciding that his rights
are more important than the vic
tims', while in socialism it is the
"majority" that is making this deci
sion.

Capitalists as rapists
I am shocked and outraged by
the claim of Angela Davis that all
capitalists are rapists. Many of my
best friends are capitalists and only
some of them are rapists.

Glorifying Reagan
I am writing to express full
agreement with the Daily editorial
of Oct. 3, "Reagan library a la
carte." A recent visit to the John F.
Kennedy Library in Boston made it
very clear to me that presidential
"libraries" do much more than
store historically important docu
ments. They serve to glorify the
personality, ideology and policies
of the past president. The library,
per se, could benefit the Univer
sity. However, we must ask the
question: Is Stanford University
the appropriate place to house an
eternal monument glorifying the
political ideology of the Reagan
administration?
