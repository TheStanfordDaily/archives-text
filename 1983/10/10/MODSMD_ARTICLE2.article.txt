# Zschau backs Reagan foreign policy
## 
### JEFF BIDDULPH 
The Reagan administration has
not overcommitted the U.S. military
so that it is defending more
countries than it has the ability to
protect, Rep. Ed Zschau (R-
Sunnvvale) told a meeting of The
Daily's editorial board and represen
tatives of the ASSU Friday.
Zschau defended the use of U.S.
Marines in Lebanon and justified
military aid to El Salvador in an hour
long meeting at The Daily office.
U.S. troops are in Lebanon
"because it's a situation where it
looks like we can be helpful," the
freshman congressman said.
Zschau said, however, that he
voted for an 18-month limit on U.S.
troop activity in the Mideastern
country and agreed with the state
ment that "if we're there to fight
we're too few and if we're there to
die we're too many."
The congressman said a recently
negotiated cease fire in Lebanon
"might provide the basis for some
sort of reconciliation."
Zschau, who recently returned
from an 11-day fact-finding tour of
Central America, said he saw exam

pies of "various viewpoints" there.
He defended military assistance to El
Salvador because he said it will help
the people there.
Zschau said he voted for ending
covert U.S. aid to the counter
revolutionaries fighting the San
dinista government in Nicaragua.
His tour of the region "tended to
confirm" his opposition to the
covert aid.

The congressman, who is widely
known as one of the few moderates
in California's Republican delega
tion, said the fact that he is the only
California Republican to vote
against the covert aid did not
diminish his standing among that
group.
The vote, which went against the
wishes of the national Republican
leadership, also did not hurt his re
lations with President Reagan,
Zschau said.
"I have a close relationship with
the White House," he said.
Zschau also said he doesn't sup
port draft registration, but "given
that we have a registration, I think
people should register."
He said he has not yet decided
whether he supports withholding
federal financial aid from students
who have not registered, but said he
is "troubled by using something that
promotes education to implement
another policy."
The congressman also said he
supports placing the proposed
Reagan library and policy center
here, but said he has reservations
about a Reagan museum.
