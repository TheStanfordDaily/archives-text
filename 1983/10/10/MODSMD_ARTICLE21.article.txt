# Christians fight loneliness
## 
### ERIC ROSENFELD 
You walk into your room at 10 p.m. after
checking your empty P.O. box for the third
time since lunch. Your roommate is off
playing Pigmania with the cute girl from
down the hall. Written on your assignment
calendar you see that two papers, a novel
and problems 1-99 inclusive are due tomor
row. You're out of beer nuts and your room
reeks because micro-organisms are growing
in the overstuffed laundry bag hanging in
your closet.
What do you do?
You start by closing the closet. But what
you really need is a miracle — some sort of
divine intervention. Otherwise, in the pre
med eat pre-med world, you haven't got a
prayer.
Or do you?
Dave Horner, director of Campus Crusade
for Christ, says you do. Praying may not nec
essarily bring you A's, or even beer nuts for
that matter. But the many Christian groups
on campus do offer an opportunity for stu
dents to assemble in a non-academic envi
ronment, with the non-academic purpose of
seeking spiritual fulfillment. Cod will not do
your laundry, but He may help you feel bet
ter about yourself and give you, as many
students have found, an added perspective
to college life, Horner said.
"We offer fellowship meetings, small
group study, retreats and training semi
nars," he said. "It's a matter of helping
people to grow to maturity with Christ. We

want to help you. We're here to meet needs,
and the most fundamental need is to meet
God."
As for University academics, Horner sup
ports "closing the gap between science and
religion. Ideally, I'd like to see more ob
jective Christian faculty members who are
intellectually honest, and who could present
a variety of views, including the Christian
perspective."
Actually, fundamentalist Christians at
Stanford hesitate to impress their convic
tions on non-believers specifically because
of what Horner calls the "intellectually
liberal environment here." They would
rather have people come to them on their
own initiative, and decide "what's best for
them."
According to some Christians inter
viewed, enjoying "sex, drugs and rock and
roll" doesn't preclude one from knowing
Jesus Christ. "The Bible never puts down
sex," one said.
"Jesus isn't going to stop me from party
ing," another added.
Is this a watered-down, tailored form of
Christianity? "No," said Creg Read, director
of the Stanford Christian Fellowship. "We
follow the same doctrine on campus as is
used in the real world."
"Loneliness is probably the biggest prob
lem on campus," Read said. "We are imper
fect people getting together ... to restore
the primary relationship between man and
Cod."
