## Stanford hands UCLA 7 turnovers Cardinal close, but coughs it up 
### ADAM BERNS 
The Stanford football team finally
found an offense that can put points
on the board in a hurry. Unfortunately
Saturday, those points were for the
other team.
Giving new meaning to the term
"instant offense," Cardinal quarter
back Steve Cottrell had two passes in
tercepted and returned for touch
downs as the UCLA Bruins scored 28
points in the fourth quarter, overcom
ing an eight point deficit, to win the
game 39-21.
After fhe game, Stanford Coach Paul
Wiggin summed up his feelings with
one word: "frustration."
"I think our whole team feels that,"
he said. ' Thev (the players) were emo
tional tor this game. I feel badly for
them. I was disappointed that the
defense let them take it down and
score when we had the (8-point) lead.
"They (the players) are hurting.
They're damn well hurting, but what's
inside of them I like. I |ust wish they
were a better football team."
The loss drops Stanford's record to
0-5 overall and 0-2 in the Pacific-10,
while UCLA got its first win, moving its
record to 1-3-1 overall and 1-0-1 in con
ference pla\.
Turnovers plaved a big part in the
game. Stanford had five passes inter
cepted, two of which were returned
for touchdowns, and fumbled the ball
three times, two of which were
recovered bv the Brums. UCLA, on the

other hand, turned over the ball only
twice once on a tumble and once on
an interception.
"It was a very important and much
needed victor\ by the UCLA football
team, IJCLA Coach Terry Donahue
said after the game. "It was very im
portant tor us to come up here and win
in Palo Alto I v\as impressed by our
players morale. The only negative is
that we lost (tirst string quarterback)
Steve Bono tor the rest of the season."
Bono was knocked out of the game,
and later it was learned the season,
when he suttered a shoulder separa
tion on UCLA's second series. Stan
ford defensive end John Bergren
blindsided Bono on a crushing sack.
UCLA finally got its running game
going Saturday, gaining 189 yards on
the ground, compared with just 70 net
rushing yards tor the Cardinal.
Stanford's pass defense, however,
was excellent. The Cardinal gave up
just 12" \ards through the air against a
UCLA offense which was ranked No. 6
nationally in passing and had 399 pas
sing yards last week.
Stanford defensive end Bergren may
have had a large part to do with it by
sending Bono out of the game, but ex
cellent pass coverage was really the
key to the increased pressure this
week by the defensive line.
Seldom-used Cardinal receiver Don
Lonsinger provided some fireworks
early in the game for the Cardinal,
catching a perfectly thrown 45-yard

bomb from quarterback John Paye to
give the Cardinal a 7-3 lead in the iirst
quarter. Lonsinger ended the after
noon with three catches tor 74 yards.
"Don did an excellent job,' Wiggin
said after the game. "He made some
things happen."
After UCLA scored 10 unanswered
second quarter points, Wiggin
replaced starting quarterback fresh
man )ohn Paye with senior Steve Cot
trell in what was perhaps the key stra
tegic move of the game.
"It was my decision all the way,"
Wiggin said about the change. "John
just wasn't sharp today. I didn't feel
that he was comfortable."
For a moment the move looked bril
liant and it looked like Stanford had a
chance to win the game With 4:25 to
play in the third quarter, Cardinal
quarterback Steve Cottrell threw a 7-
vard scoring strike to halfback Thomas
Henley with blitzing Bruin safety Joe
Gasser hanging on to his leg, giving
Stanford a 14-13 lead.
Just over a minute later, Card
linebacker Mike Noble intercepted a
Rick Neuheisel pass intended tor tight
end Paul Bergmann. Noble ran the in
terception in for a touchdown, and
suddenly Stanford led 21-13.
But holding a lead is not something
at which the Cardinal has had practice
Immediately following the Stanford
touchdown, UCLA mounted a 76-yard
drive, capping it with a 1-yard run by
running back Danny Andrews for the

score. UCLA's two-point try failed
when Cardinal cornerback Kevin Baird
drove halfback Kevin Nelson out ot
bounds at the 1-yard line on a sweep to
the right side.
After the kickoff, Stanford took pos
session at its own 20-yard line. On the
first play, Cottrell had a pass inter
cepted by Bruin safety Don Rogers on
the let! sideline. Rogers returned the
ball 29 yards for a UCLA touchdown,
and suddenly, LJCLA led 26-21 tollow
ing John Lee's extra point.
After that, the game became a com
edy of errors. Running back Stan Gill
tumbled on Stanford's next possession
and the Bruins took over on their own
4'-yard line. Atter driving down to the
Cardinal 6-yard line, defensive end
lohn Bergren sacked Neuheisel for an
8-yard loss and UCLA settled for a field
goal.
On the next series, Cottrell had an
other pass intercepted by Rogers.
UC LA took possession on the Stan
ford 57-yard line and although the Car
dinal defense held, lee booted a 47-
yard field goal, boosting the Bruin lead
to 11 points.
The next Stanford possession
brought more of the same. Bruin
safety Lupe Sanchez stepped in front
of a Cottrell pass and returned it il
yards for a touchdown, putting the
finishing touches on the Bruin victory

Rogers had two interceptions on the day, one of which he
returned for a fourth-quarter touchdown.
who left the game early with a
pinched nerve in his neck and
was taken to the hospital for
X-rays, is OK and is expected
to be ready for next week's

game.
Although Cottrell replaced
Paye on Saturday, Wiggin left
no doubt that Paye is still the
No. 1 quarterback and will
start next week.

Stanford punter Tripp Har
din may be the Cardinals only
bright spot this season. Satur
day Hardin's punts averaged
47.2 yards.
