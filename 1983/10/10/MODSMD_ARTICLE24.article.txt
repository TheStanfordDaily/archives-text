# Women win invitational, but may lose star Plumer

### RICK BILODEAU 
Allison Wiley pulled away trom a pack ot
fellow Cardinals atter two miles to lead the
Stanford women's cross country team to vic
tors at the Stanford College Invitational Sat
urda\. Her time of 16:17.8 established a new
record for the home course.
However, the victory was tarnished when
star runner Patti Sue Plumer twisted her
ankle as she crossed the finish line. Plumer
's a major cog in the Stanford running ma
chine and her loss may severly jeopardize
Stanford's chances to win the NCAA title this
year. Whether Plumer will compete again is
not known.
As for the race itself, Coach Brooks
Johnson was "immeasurably pleased" with
the team's performance as they defeated a
formidable Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo squad
18-47.
Stanford established itself early by taking
the lead as a pack, but was followed dogged
ly by a triplet ot Cal Poly women. Halfway
through the race however, SLO's women
began to fall back and the Cardinal took
control.
After two miles, Wiley and Plumer pulled
away and the sophomore won the race at
the tape. Plumer (16:20), Regina Jacobs
(16: 12) and Ceci Hopp (16:33) followed
closely to assure the Stanford victory. Cory

Schubert closed out the scoring by placing
eighth while Cardinals Michelle Mason and
Hill a r\ Ellin finished 3-41 hand 54th
respectively.
In the men's competition, the race was
won easily by Ed Evestone ot Brigham Young
Universitv in 30.13.6 while UCLA captured
the team titie.
Stanford's runners struggled through the
10,000 meter course to a fifth place tinish.
Johnson was not disappointed, however.
"Sometimes you have to gauge yourselves
by how good you look when you have a bad
day, and we did well," he said.
The race started off well enough as Stan
ford runners formed a pack behind the
leaders. Thev were able to hold together for
a little over two miles, where Charles Alex
ander developed a cramp and the pack
broke up. By the three-mile mark only Jim
Smith was in contention, running a strong
second- half race to place fifth in 30:29.7.
Other Cardinals placed as follows: Marc
Oleson, 14th, Ed Calloway, 25th, Ryan Stoll,
28th, and Jeff Atkinson, 66th.
Alexander finished 82nd. It is not un
reasonable to assume however that if he had
been able to run a strong race and it Brian
Pettingill had not been sidelined with a
groin injury, Stanford would have been vic
torious.
