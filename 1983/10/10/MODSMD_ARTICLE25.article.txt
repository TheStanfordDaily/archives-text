Mike Tolliver is probably
still wondering what hit him.
In the fourth quarter of
UCLA's 39-21 win over Stan
ford, Cardinal receiver Tolliver
ran a pass pattern that took
him over the middle. Quarter
back Steve Cottrell threw the
ball, Tolliver turned for it and
. . . boom.
Tolliver lay flat on his back.
The ball lay five yards in front
of him. UCLA free safety Don
Rogers stood over him.
Besides being perhaps the
most intimidating safety in the
college ranks the 6-foot-1, 208
pound Rogers is also one of
the best at making the big de
fensive plays. Against Stan
ford, he showed why.
During the day, Rogers re
corded nine tackles, one pass
break-up, two interceptions
and one fumble recovery. He
returned his tirst interception
29 yards for a touchdown and
his other interception and
fumble recovery each set up
john Lee field goals. In a
word, Rogers was awesome?.
"He's a fine player, a fine
player,'' praised Stanford

Coach Paul Wiggin. "I think
he's in the category of a Kenny
Easley or a Ronnie Lott — that
type of college football
plaver."

Funny of Wiggin to compare
Rogers to Easley. Rogers actu
ally learned his position from
Easley, the three-time Ail-
American at UCLA who now is
a Pro Bowl safety for the NFL's

Seattle Seahawks.
Not only did Rogers learn
the position of safety, he
learned it well. Rogers seemed
to be in the right place at the
right time all day Saturday.
His tirst interception came
just 14 seconds into the fourth
quarter and put UCLA back in
front 26-21 after Stanford had
assumed a 21-13 lead in the
third quarter.
"I was surprised to see him
(Cottrell) throw the ball,"
Rogers said of the intercep
tion. "We were disguising like
we were in two deep and we
rolled over into three deep.
He threw the ball right to me."
The Bruin tree salety picked
off his second Cottrell pass of
the afternoon with 3:17 left in
the game. Rogers returned it
to the Stanford \7 and then
UCLA's offense took it seven
more yards to the 40, where
Lee kicked his fourth field goal
of the day Lee's kick iced the
game for the Bruins, giving
them a 32-21 lead.
"On the second one
(interception) were were in
man-to-man coverage and the
guy (Cardinal receiver Don

Lonsinger) tried to release
outside then tucked back un
derneath me and I was able to
jump in front of the pass."
The victory was UCLA's first
of the season and no one was
more elated about it than
Rogers. "It's been tough (not
winning). We've been getting
pressure from the outside and
walking around campus with
out a win is pretty tough."
Saturday's game also was
important to the Bruins be
cause the defense "regained
respectability," according to
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue.
"What we've done is just
kept fighting and, like coach
said, we worked hard this
week," Rogers said. "The
team morale was up and we
played the type of ball we're
capable of playing."
Not only did the Bruin
defense as a whole gain
respectability, Rogers gained a
lot of personal respect as well,
especially Wiggin's.
Asked if Rogers' intercep
tion he ran back for a touch
down turned the game
around, Wiggin replied, "Sure
got my attention."
