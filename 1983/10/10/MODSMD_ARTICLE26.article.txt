League East Division title, then defeat
ing AL West < hampion Chicago in four
games in the AL Championship Series.
The Orioles eliminated the White Sox
in four games with a series-clinching
3-0, lOth-inning victory Saturday in
Chicago.
The Orioles last were in the World
Series in 1979, losing in seven games to
the Pittsburgh Pirates. They are experi
enced, with I \ players from that team.
"This is a gutsy team," Singleton
said. "We've come through more this
year, especially with the injuries.
These are the greatest clutch players
I've ever played with.

Philadelphia — The Philadelphia
Phillies, winners of the National
League pennant on the strength of the
hitting of Gary Matthews and the
pitching of Steve Carlton in the NL
Championship Series against the Los
Angeles Dodgers, will start john Den

Nl series Saturday night with a 7-2 vic

in the first inning, and Carlton won his
second game, with relief help from
Ron Reed and Al Holland.

After naming the right-handed Den
ny, who was 19-6 during the regular
season, as his opening-game pitcher in
the World Series that opens at
Philadelphia, Phillies' Manager Paul
Owens indicated that he would use
Charlie Hudson in Game Two Wednes
day night. Owens said he was con
cerned about Carlton, who worked six
innings against the Dodgers Saturday
night, before leaving with back
spasms.
"He (Carlton) really gutted it out the
last two innings," Owens said. "Right
now I'd say Hudson for Wednesday
and Carlton for Friday (in Game 3 at
Baltimore). But that could change."
