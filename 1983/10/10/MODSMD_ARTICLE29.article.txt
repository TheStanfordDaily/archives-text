# Lonsinger finally gets his chance
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER 
Despite the general
feeling of gloom and disap
pointment after Stanford's
39-21 loss to UCIA Saturday
afternoon — the Cardinal's
fifth loss in as manv tries —
one Cardinal plavt-r could
feel satisfied after the
game.
Don Lonsinger a relative
unknown to most Stanford
football followers until Sat
urday, had to be somewhat
pleased after the Cardinal's
second Pac-10 defeat.
Until Saturday, Lonsinger
played sparingly this year
so little that he had re
corded no receptions from
his split end position
before UCLA came to town.
In fact, the Bruins' visit to
Stanford Stadium was the
reason Lonsingei saw more
playing time Saturday than
had seen all season. The
Cardinal coaching staff
decided to install a special
offensive formation to give
Stanford more firepower in
certain situations. The new
set's look and effectiveness
revolved around I onsinger.
Essentially, Lonsinger
replaced the tight end
when the Cardinal used the
new plan. He would line up
in the tight end's position
against LJCI.A, which fre
quently use 1 - a two-man
deep zone defense in its
secondary, to put a speed
threat in the middle of the
field during passing situa
tions.
The formation's results
were dramatic.
In the first quarter, Stan
ford trailed UCLA 3-0 and
had the ball on the Bruin
45-yard line after beginning
a drive on the Cardinal 20.
It was third down, 11 yards
for a tirst down. During
Stanford's tirst four losses,
it had shown an inability to
convert third down plays to
first downs, especially
when one or two yards
were needed. But, as

Lonsinger explains, the
Cardinal got more than a
first down.
"I lined up in a tight end
position, split out a little
bit, and my job was to hug
the hashmark — we were on
the right hashmark — and I
was to take an outside
release and I'm supposed
to nod him (the defender)
out on the lett hash and just

go right down the middle,''
Lonsinger said. "And then
if the safeties are wide on
the receivers, the quarter
back is supposed to throw
it to me in the middle, and I
got enough room where he
bit on the nod just enough
where I could get behind
him and make the catch."
The catch enabled Stan
ford to go ahead 7-3 with

5:45 left in the first quarter.
More importantly, the Car
dinal fans came alive. After
seeing the Bruins light the
scoreboard first, the catch
established momentum for
the Cardinal rarely seen
during the season's first
four games.
The reception also
represented the first time
Stanford had scored in the
first quarter this season.
For those now wonder
ing why-in-goodness-sake
Lonsinger is not in the
lineup, there is one good
reason. Emile Harry, an All-
America candidate, is also a
split end.
"I played a lot two years
ago, then I got hurt,"
Lonsinger, a fifth-year
senior, said after the game.
"Emile Harry took my
place."
Lonsinger caught 13
passes and averaged over
14 yards per catch in 1981.
He caught one before
being injured last season.
Lonsinger eclipsed his
1982 statistics impressively
Saturday. During the series
which culminated in his
touchdown, he grabbed a
John Paye pass for 10 yards
on third-and-seven. In the
third quarter, Lonsinger
caught a pass over the
middle for 19 yards. That
catch, which proved to be
his last, was a pretty one.
Lonsinger had to make a
difficult adjustment to
reach back and catch Steve
Cottrell's off-target pass,
but he snagged the ball
without breaking stride and
continued for additional
yardage.
The final numbers read:
three catches for 74 yards.
Mike Tolliver was the
nearest teammate in
yardage with 31. Not bad
for someone who is "just
trying to do my best for the
team."
He succeeded Saturday.
