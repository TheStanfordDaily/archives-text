# Physicians call for freeze
## 
### TROY EID 
Twenty-six experts on nuclear
war-related issues focused on the
' erne that a nuclear freeze is essen
"l to human survival at a Physicians
1 r Social Responsibility conference
•Id this weekend at Memorial
iditorium.
The conference, entitled
Prescription for Prevention," was
attended by between 1200 and 1500
people, according to Dr. Gary Lapid,
president of the Mid-Peninsula and
Stanford PSR chapter.
A nuclear freeze "would be easier
to verify" than the "complex and
difficult" arms control initiatives
currently proposed by the Reagan
administration, according to William
Colby, who served as director of the
Central Intelligence Agency in the
Nixon and Ford administrations.
"The major problem of today's
world is how to handle these ter
rible" nuclear weapons, Colby
assented, adding that "today we
have developed our intelligence sys
tems so that we don't need to trust
the Russians."
Alexander Sakharov, former re

search fellow at the Soviet Academy
of Sciences and brother of Nobel
prize-winning Soviet dissident
Andrei Sakharov, echoed Colby's
contention that questions of trust
should not become impediments in
arms control negotiations between
the superpowers.
"I do not care about trust ... or
abstract concepts," Sakharov
declared. "It is not a question of
trust. It is the hand of a partner
sharing the common" interest in
world preservation.
"The U.S. can stretch that hand —
then the Soviet Union will put down
the shield," Sakharov said. "If you
stretch out your hand to them . . .
they would feel that they are people
first and foremost" rather than "one
lump of power."
Sakharov, who was granted politi
cal asylum and emigrated to the
United States in 1981, expressed dis
may at the actions of Soviet
emigrants who have "declared war"
on the Soviet system upon arriving
in the West.
"When we declare war on the So
viet system, the system is strong and

terribly dangerous," he said.
"We should realize that the sys
tem becomes a consolidation of
forces" only when the Soviets are
treated as one indistinguishable
mass instead of as individuals, Sak
harov said.
Sakharov noted that this American
tendency to "lump" all the Soviet
people together contributes to the
"hatred of the U.S." prevalent in So
viet society. He stressed that this
anti-American sentiment "is not in
herent" in Soviet thought.
"The Soviet people hate the fact
that their fear is being fed" by go
vernment propaganda, Sakharov
contended, adding that the Soviet
citizenry is ignorant of most U.S.-
Soviet trading agreements — "but
they know about American em
bargoes."
Sakharov's prescription tor im
proving superpower relations
focuses on improved communica
tion, which he says is the major way
in which Americans "can help the
Soviet people beat their own sys
tem." He noted that any serious
communication effort must include
discussions between President
Reagan and Soviet leader Yuri
Andropov.
Disarmament is feasible when the
two leaders permit communication
"on all possible levels," Sakharov
said, adding that anything less than
this communication will inevitably
"lead to an arms buildup."
Dr. Harold Sandler, chief of the
National Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration's biomedical research
division, the Ames Research Center,
also noted the need to communi
cate with the Soviets in any in
itiatives designed to promote peace.
He stressed that the United States
should not use such communica
tions ventures merely as opportuni
ties to attempt to convert Soviets to
American values.
"Detente has not worked because
it was done on the wrong basis,"
Sandler said. "We thought we could
bring them (the Soviets) around to
our way of looking at things" if we
"compelled them to buy our food."
Sandler contrasted the human
price of war between the super
powers, noting that war-related fac
tors have been responsible for the
death of 50 million Russians in the
past 80 years.
"There isn't a single Russian fam
ily that hasn't been touched by
these events," he said, adding that
Americans "have lost 1 million
people in our entire history" to
similar causes.
Dr. Helen Caldicott, former na
tional president of the PSR, stressed
that "America hated Russia even
before" the 1917 Bolshevik Revolu
tion and that present Reagan admin
istration policy is indicative of this
hatred. In 1933, the United States
became the world's last country to
diplomatically recognize the Soviet
government, a fact that was
repeatedly referred to by confer
ence speakers.
"This hatred of the Russians is al
most archetypal. It is almost
stamped into our genes," Caldicott
said.
Caldicott described a recent
meeting with Reagan, in which she

said the president referred to the
Russians as "godless communists."
She stressed that in the same
meeting the president also claimed
"never to have met a Russian."
"They (Reagan administration offi
cials) are not the appropriate people
to be in power in the world today,"
Caldicott said.
The Reagan administration has
not accounted for differences be
tween the superpowers in the for
mulation of American policy, accor
ding to Caldicott.

"We're all very different, the na
tions of the world. We have to live
together or we'll die together," she
said.
Caldicott also dismissed concepts
of "winnable nuclear war" with an
explanation of electro-magnetic
pulse, a phenomenon which she
said could be generated if a atomic
bomb were detonated 200
kilometers above the North Ameri
can continent.
Such an event "would destroy"
most of computers and solid state
equipment that the U.S. military
relies upon towage nuclear war, she
said.
The extensive list of conference
speakers also featured Robert
Manoff, managing editor of Harper's
magazine; retired U.S. Admiral Noel
Gayler; University President Donald
Kennedy; Stanford Medical School
Dean Dominick Purpura; Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center Deputy
Director Sidney Drell; and aut
horities from universities and hospi
tals worldwide.
