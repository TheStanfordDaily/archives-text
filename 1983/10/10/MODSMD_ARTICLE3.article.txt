### TROY EID 
Twenty-six experts on nuclear
war-related issues focused on the
' erne that a nuclear freeze is essen
"l to human survival at a Physicians
1 r Social Responsibility conference
•Id this weekend at Memorial
iditorium.
The conference, entitled
Prescription for Prevention," was
attended by between 1200 and 1500
people, according to Dr. Gary Lapid,
president of the Mid-Peninsula and
Stanford PSR chapter.
A nuclear freeze "would be easier
to verify" than the "complex and
difficult" arms control initiatives
currently proposed by the Reagan
administration, according to William
Colby, who served as director of the
Central Intelligence Agency in the
Nixon and Ford administrations.
"The major problem of today's
world is how to handle these ter
rible" nuclear weapons, Colby
assented, adding that "today we
have developed our intelligence sys
tems so that we don't need to trust
the Russians."
Alexander Sakharov, former re

search fellow at the Soviet Academy
of Sciences and brother of Nobel
prize-winning Soviet dissident
Andrei Sakharov, echoed Colby's
contention that questions of trust
should not become impediments in
arms control negotiations between
the superpowers.
"I do not care about trust ... or
abstract concepts," Sakharov
declared. "It is not a question of
trust. It is the hand of a partner
sharing the common" interest in
world preservation.
"The U.S. can stretch that hand —
then the Soviet Union will put down
the shield," Sakharov said. "If you
stretch out your hand to them . . .
they would feel that they are people
first and foremost" rather than "one
lump of power."
Sakharov, who was granted politi
cal asylum and emigrated to the
United States in 1981, expressed dis
may at the actions of Soviet
emigrants who have "declared war"
on the Soviet system upon arriving
in the West.
"When we declare war on the So
viet system, the system is strong and

terribly dangerous," he said.
"We should realize that the sys
tem becomes a consolidation of
forces" only when the Soviets are
treated as one indistinguishable
mass instead of as individuals, Sak
harov said.
Sakharov noted that this American
tendency to "lump" all the Soviet
people together contributes to the
"hatred of the U.S." prevalent in So
viet society. He stressed that this
anti-American sentiment "is not in
herent" in Soviet thought.
"The Soviet people hate the fact
that their fear is being fed" by go
vernment propaganda, Sakharov
contended, adding that the Soviet
citizenry is ignorant of most U.S.-
Soviet trading agreements — "but
they know about American em
bargoes."
Sakharov's prescription tor im
proving superpower relations
focuses on improved communica
tion, which he says is the major way
in which Americans "can help the
Soviet people beat their own sys
