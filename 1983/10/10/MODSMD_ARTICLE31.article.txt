# Officials center of action in tie
## 
### MACKINLAY POLHEMUS 
Although the Stanford
men's soccer team and
Westwood College tied 1-1 on
Saturday morning, there was
one apparent winner.
" The official was a predomi
nant figure tor both teams,"
said Stanford Coach Nelson
Lodge. "It's unfortunate that
the officiating played such a
dominant role in the game.''
The referee did make his
presence known. In fact, the
spectators watched what the
officials would call next rather
than watching where the ball
would go next. "The fans
weren't watching a game, they
were watching the referee,"
Lodge said.
At one point in the game,
Giancarlo Ferruzzi, who
scored the only goal for Stan
ford, was obviously tackled in
the penalty box. Normally this
would give Stanford a penalty
shot. Instead the referee
called a direct kick outside the
box, taking an almost sure
goal away from the Cardinal.
On the other side of the
field, a similar play occurred,
but the official would show no
favoritism. "We're even
now!" shouted Westmont
Coach Ron Fortosif to Lodge.
Charging incompetence on
the part of the officials, the
crafty Fortosif approached
them during halt'time in an ef
fort to sway them towards his
team.
"You guys want something
to drink?" inquired the
benevolent Fortosif. "Hey, by
the way, you guys are doing a
really great job."
Although the score indi
cates otherwise, Stanford did
dominate most of the game.
"Stanford plays such high
pressure ball because they're
bigger and faster than we
are," Fortosif commented.
"We had to pass quickly. If we
held the ball too long, they'd
clean our clocks."
The officials may have felt

the game was getting a little
lopsided, prompting them to
their very controversial call
which forced Stanford to play
with one man down for the
last 20 minutes of the game.
On that play, the official
issued Todd Rafalovich a red
card for charging the goalie.
"That was a terrible call," For
tosif admitted.
After the game, fans and
players alike swore at the offi

cials. The verbal abuse
reached the point where the
referee wanted to call the
police, saying to the other offi
cial, "We're going to need se
curity."
Ferruzzi said, "Westmont
capitalized on the times we
got frustrated about the offi
cial's calls. That's why they
seemed like a larger threat
than they were."
On Stanford's goal, "Walter

(Kingson) gave a nice through
ball and Robby (West) shot it
in front of the goal mouth,"
Ferruzzi explained "The
defender was asleep waiting
for the goalie to get it. I was
left unmarked and hit the near
post."
Westmont scored its only
goal on a penalty shot from its
All-American Louie Cuevas.
"Luckily I shot in the opposite
direction that the goalie was
going," Cuevas said.
