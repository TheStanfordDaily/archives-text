# Card water polo team beats No. 5 Irvine, loses to No.4 UCLA
## 
### ROB ZWEIG 
UCLA used five unanswered
second-half goals to sink the
upstart Stanford water polo
team's hopes for a sweep of
two teams ranked among the
nation's top five as the No. 2
ranked Bruins rolled to a 1 3-7
victory Saturday morning at
De Guerre pool.
The loss dropped the Car
dinal's season slate to b-7-1
overall and 0-1 in the Pacific
-10, and came on the heels of
Stanford's impressive 9-6
drubbing of the No. 5 ranked
UC-lrvine Anteaters one day
earlier.
Against the Anteaters, the
young Cardinal squad came
out breathing fire, displaying
the team's savvy and individ
ual brilliance of a veteran club.
"I thought they'd be ner
vous," said Cardinal Coach
Dante Dettamanti, "but they
came out so cool I just
couldn't believe it."
Cool indeed. Sophomore
Jaime Velez started the show,
converting a Craig Klass pass
into a 1-0 Cardinal lead just 25
seconds into the first quarter.
Irvine cut the lead to 2-1,
but Stanford capitalized on a

h-on-5 man advantage when
freshman Greg Gamble
stuffed home a beautiful cross
cage feed from fellow fresh
man Klass.
Meanwhile, senior goalie
Martin Fisher was working on
a gem in the biggest start of
his career. Fisher finished with
nine saves and wreaked fur
ther havoc for the Anteaters
by roaming out of the cage to
disrupt the UCI offense a la ice
hockey goalie Gary Cheevers.
Craig Klass' hook shot just
before the halt gave Stanford a
5-3 lead and a margin they
would never relinquish. With
his back to the goal, Klass took
a pass on the left side of the
cage, faked a backhand then
pivoted to his right and
lobbed the ball into the far
side of the net.
After trading goals through
the second half, the Card iced
the game in the fourth quarter
when freshman Greg Ocasek
hauled in a long outlet pass,
eluded a UCI defender, and as
coach Dettamanti pleaded
"No, No, No!" in an effort to
work the clock, fired the ball
by Maizel giving the Cardinal a
9-5 lead, leaving the Stanford

mentor shrugging his
shoulders in pleasant dis
belief.
Things turned sour on Sat
urday though as UCLA used its
physical size to punish the
Card and score five times in
the last eight minutes to break
open an 8-7 game.
In that spurt, the Bruins,
now 10-5-1, showed why an 8-
4 triumph over No. 1 ranked
UC-Berkeley on Friday was no
fluke.
"UCLA's probably the num
ber one team in the nation.
They dominated us in the
second half and just wore us
down physically," said Detta
manti.
Stanford's team defense,
which had looked so mag
nificent on Friday, collapsed
as UCLA benefited from
numerous 6-on-5 man advan
tages and even burned Fisher
when he ventured into un

friendly waters.
The failure of the defense
was the key to the game accor
ding to Dettamanti.
The Bruins jumped to a 3-1
lead behind two goals by
junior hole man Carl Salyer.
But goals by Velez and fresh
man Robert Abbott evened
the game at three after one
stanza.
Each club scored twice
within the first two minutes of
the second period, with Stan
ford enjoying leads at 4-3 and
5-4.
Fisher then took a sure goal
awav by rejecting a penalty
shot by UCLA's Scott
Thornton. Unfortunately, he
gave one back when UCLA
scooped up his outlet pass
and South African import Gary
Roberts tallied on the counter
to give the Bruins the lead for
good just before the half.
