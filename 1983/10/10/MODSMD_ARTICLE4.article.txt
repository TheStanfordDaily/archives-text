# Reagan center may violate University charter
## Students oppose complex 
### DOUGLAS JEHL Senior staff writer 
Students opposed to the proposed Reagan library
complex have obtained a legal opinion indicating that
placement of a Reagan center for public affairs here
would violate a provision of the amended Stanford
Charter stating that the University "shall forever be
kept out of politics."
The center, "because of its affiliation with a political
partv and a political figure" would violate this amend
men;, according to the opinion, which was issued by
Public Advocates Inc., the state's leading public inter
est law firm.
Either the state attorney general or a University trus
tee would have standing to enjoin the public affairs
.renter from being placed at Stanford, while students,
faculty and alumni may have standing to bring a suit tor
breach of trust, the opinion says.
The work was done free of charge for the students,
who have formed a group calling itself Stanford Com
munity Against Reagan University, according to senior
Luke Cole, a spokesman.
According the opinion, it is "possible that the viola
tion would be compounded by the fact that the (public
affairs) center will be under the control of the Hoover
Institution rather than the University."
The charge that a Reagan center for public affairs,
and particularly one under the auspices of the Hoover
Institution, would be inherently political has been
disputed by proponents of the complex. They say that
the proposed center, like Hoover, would do quality,
non-political academic research in the area of public
policy.

Only the proposed public affairs center is mentioned
in the opinion as being a violation of the Charter. "It is
unlikely that the placement of the proposed Reagan
library alone would violate the Charter," the opinion
says.
No mention is made of the Reagan museum, which is
a third part of the proposed center.
According to Cole, "at least 12" undergraduate and
graduate students have come to an organizational
meeting or otherwise helped the group this year. Many
of them were active in the drive to gather signatures on
petitions questioning the relationship between the
Hoover Institution and the University, he said.
"The group reorganized because we saw the need
for renewed action and attention because at the same
time the relationship is supposed to be being
reassessed, Hoover is proposing a grandiose new com
plex that would extend its reach into the University
immeasurably," Cole said.
The group's name comes from the idea that an ex
pansion of the influence of the Hoover Institution on
campus would politicize the University to such a
degree that its name might just as well be changed to
Ronald Reagan University.
The student group's release of the legal opinion and
its peddling of red buttons asking the question "Ronald
Reagan University?" at Saturday's football game appear
designed to influence members of the Board of Trus
tees, who are scheduled to meet on campus today and
tomorrow.
University President Donald Kennedy's presentation
to the Board of the long-awaited fac
ulty committee report on the pro
posed complex is expected to come
tomorrow afternoon and will not be
made public by the University until
then.

Kennedy has said the Board will
not make any commitments either
way on the Reagan complex this
month. But both the faculty report
and the preliminary discussion at
this month's meeting are expected
to have a substantial impact on the
final decision, which is likely to be
reached at the next Board meeting
in early December.
