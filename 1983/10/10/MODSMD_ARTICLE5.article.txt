# Experts discuss economic and social alternatives for Central America
## 
### BOB BARCKLAY 
Academicians from Stanford and
Latin America, as well as busines
smen and government advisers, gat
hered here Thursday for the
"Conference on Viable Economic
and Social Alternatives in Central
America and the Caribbean."
Jointly sponsored by the Mon
ticello West Foundation and the
Center for Latin American Studies,
the two-day conference attracted a
prominent group of individuals
from diverse backgrounds to dis
cuss problems currently threatening
the region.
"I don't believe there has ever
been such a distinguished group put
together to work on this subject,"
said Prof. Clark Reynolds, director
of the Monticello West Foundation
and the principal organizer of the
conference.
Organizers said that the confer
ence was a success, but some won
dered whether it will have any effect
on the increasingly volatile condi
tions in Central America.
Prof. Gordon Lewis warned that
people "should not be tempted by
romantic enthusiasm." He said that
the conference was a kind of "think

tank" which is a "peculiar American
institution."
Lewis was not convinced that any
government would follow the ad
vice of "this distinguished group of
professors."
Implied throughout the confer
ence was the need for some kind of
action or leadership by American or
European powers. Lewis, wary of
this attitude, said,"l detect,
couched in sophisticated language,
the old imperialist spirit in which it
is the function of the colonies to
receive leadership from these larger
powers."
History Prof. )ohn Wirth, former
director of the Center for Latin
American Studies, criticized Lewis'
opinion.
"For him (Lewis), the U.S. is part
of the problem," Wirth said, "but he
would probably say, if you pushed
him, that the U.S. was also a part of
a viable solution."
Clint Smith, assistant director of
Monticello West, similiarly criticized
any kind of isolationist attitude and
said that in this time of global inter
dependence it is "extremely narrow
and shortsighted to see it as only a

Central American or Caribbean
problem."
The conference organizers em
phasized the need for a "spirit of
cooperation" in this age of
"economic and social interdepen
dence among nations."
"The members (of the Monticello
West Foundation) share a common
interest in global interdependence

and the belief that events through
out the world are inextricably bound
economically and socially," Smith
said.
Reynolds sees Monticello West,
and specifically this, their first con
ference, as a "facilitating mecha
nism for cooperation" between
people of differing ideologies.
The group's agenda was divided
into three areas of discussion. First,
a historical perspective for the
region's current conditions was es
tablished in papers presented by
Lewis, who is from the University of
Puerto Rico, and Prof. Eduardo
Lizano of the University of Costa
Rica.
The second session carefully
analyzed the economic structure
and problems of the countries.
Papers were read by Reynolds and
Economics Prof. Donald Harris,
Prof. Sidney Mintz from John Hop
kins University and Antonio
Palacios, a member of an organiza
tion which studies Central American
economic integration issues.
Finally, the group discussed the
role of other nations in the develop
ment of Central America and the

Caribbean. Prof. Leslie Manigat, a
Haitian exile from the University
Simon Bolivar, gave a paper entitled
"The Role of the Major and Regional
Powers in the Search for Viable Al
ternatives in the Caribbean Basin,"
which inspired heated, but
amicable, discussion among confer
ence members.

Only about three students atten
ded the conference, a figure which
was suprising to Wirth, who noted
that it is "really puzzling why there
isn't more of a group of people that
come to these things. There needs
to be a more sustained involvement
in public issues. The Farm has tradi
tionally not been too good at that."
