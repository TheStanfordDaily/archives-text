Watt resigns
Washington — Interior secretary
James Watt submitted his
resignation to President Reagan
yesterday, climaxing 18 days of
mounting criticism over his com
ments about a coal advisory
panel and more than 2 1/2 years
of controversy over his steward
ship of the nation's natural re
sources.
To the end, Reagan stood
loyally by Watt, even as the inte
rior secretary's political support
evaporated on Capitol Hill and
Republicans led a chorus of

demands for his ouster.
"Jim has done an outstanding
job as a member of my cabinet
and in his stewardship of the nat
ural resources of the nation,"
Reagan said in a statement ac
cepting Watt's resignation.
Reagan said Watt will continue
to serve "until his successor is
confirmed."
Watt telephoned Reagan at
Camp David, Md., late yesterday
afternoon to offer a letter of
resignation, in which Watt said
he is leaving because his
"usefulness" to the president
"has come to an end."
Later, Watt read his letter to reporters assembled
in a cow pasture near the California ranch where he
has been vacationing since late last week. He and his
wife, Leilani, then mounted horses for a ride around
the ranch with its owner, Thomas Barrack, a former
Watt aide at the Interior Department.
White House Counselor Edwin Meese said last
night that discussions about selecting a successor to
Watt would begin today and that no one has been
approached about the job.
Speculation within the administration and on
Capitol Hill was centered on former Sen. Clifford
Hansen (R-Wyo.), who was Reagan's first choice for
the job in 1981, Rep. Manuel Lujan (R-N.M.), former
Sen. James Buckley (R-N.Y.) and Energy Secretary
Donald Hodel.
In his statement last night, Reagan made no men
tion of the furor stirred by Watt Sept. 21, when he
characterized the members of a coal-leasing advi
sory panel as "a black ... a woman, two Jews and a
cripple . . Watt's letter of resignation did not
mention the controversies over earlier Watt state
ments and his coal-leasing and other policies that
steadily eroded his support in the Republican
controlled Senate, even among those who had been
his staunch supporters.
Investigation commission resigns
Manila, Philippines — All members of the commis
sion investigating the assassination of opposition
leader Benigno Aquino resigned early this morning,
saying they wanted to open the way for appointment
of a more credible investigative panel.
The announcement, greeted by a standing ovation
from an audience of about 300 people, came as the
commission was to reopen public hearings on the
Aug. 21 slaying.
Acting commission chairman Felix Antonio, a
former Supreme Court justice, said the commission
wanted to give a "free hand" to chairman-designate
Arturo Tolentino, who announced earlier he could
not accept leadership of the group as it had been
appointed by President Ferdinand Marcos.
Tolentino, who did not appear at the hearing, said
in a separate statement released by his office, "My
conclusion was that under the present circum
stances my designation would only serve as a cos
metic for the commission."
He proposed that a new investigative body be set
up that would include non-politicians.
Bomb kills South Korean officials
Rangoon, Burma — A terrorist bomb apparently
meant for South Korean President Chun Doo-Hwan
ripped through a memorial site yesterday, killing
four of his Cabinet ministers, the ambassador to
Burma and several top aides.
The governments of Burma and South Korea said
16 South Koreans and three Burmese journalists
were killed by the explosion at the Martyr's
Mausoleum in Rangoon minutes before Chun
arrived for the ceremony. They said at least 48
people were wounded, including two Burmese
Cabinet ministers and 15 high-ranking South
Koreans.

South Korean officials accused North Korea of en
gineering the explosion, which devastated the
senior leadership of Chun's government. It came on
the first day of a scheduled 18-dav presidential good
will tour.
Burmese and South Korean officials said Chun and
his wife immediately flew back to Seoul, canceling
the remainder of the trip. In Seoul, police sealed off
the airport before the arrival and stopped reporters
from entering.
South Korean Prime Minister Kim Sang-Hyup held
two emergency Cabinet meetings, decreed a
nationwide alert for the armed forces and dis
patched an emergency medical team to Rangoon to
care for the South Korean wounded.
Lootings spread in Brazil
Riode Janeiro, Brazil — It began on a Tuesday night,
the eve of a Brazilian work holiday. Nothing had
happened in Vila Kennedy, a poor outlying suburb,
until shortly after midnight. Then the word swept
through the streets like a storm blowing in.
From the main square, people came running un
der the rail tracks to the narrow crescent that holds
the Lead and Carneiro supermarkets. The looting
had started. Cray security shutters had been
wrenched open, and 10-pound sacks of rice and
black beans were being cleaned out.
Hundreds joined in. The doors of a third super
market were broken down. By the next afternoon,
150 troops on the scene were confronted by a crowd
of more than 1000.
The rioters answered tear gas with volleys of
stones and shouts of "We are hungry."
That was the fourth day of Rio's supermarket sack
ings, when the count was 17 break-ins all along the
federal rail tracks of the city's poor northeastern
suburbs. A month later, after the first week of Octo
ber, the count was more than 85 — and the looting had
spread to towns all over this economically stricken
country.
Looting has become the most dramatic reflection
of the tensions Brazil's economic crisis — and its $90
billion foreign debt — caused in the country. Since the
beginning of September more than 225 super
markets, food warehouses and shops have been at
tacked bv crowds and stripped in Rio de Janeiro, Sao
Paulo and drought-stricken northeastern Brazil.
Politicians, police and businessmen have ran
corously deoated the blame for the sackings and the
government's inability to stop them. A sense of
panic has overtaken some middle-class neighbor
hoods and merchants are patrolling stores with pis
tols and shotguns.
Opposition leaders, meanwhile, have used the
incidents to mobilize support against new economic
austerity measures by the military-backed federal
government. The pressure comes even as the go
vernment struggles to meet the terms of new agree
ments with foreign banks and the International
Monetary Fund.

Kissinger begins tour of region
Panama City, Panama — Former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger began a week-long tour through
this turbulent region yesterday in his effort to design
a long-term policy backdrop for the Reagan adminis
tration's battles in Central America.

Kissinger and nine of the 12 members of his
presidential commission, along with two dozen
aides aboard an Air Force jet, began their visit to all
six countries in the isthmus here last night. They will
spend one day in each nation and will finish the tour
in Nicaragua Saturday.
President Reagan and his top aides have defined
U.S. policy in the region as a vital struggle to prevent
the Sandinista government in Managua from con
solidating pro-Soviet rule and promoting leftist chal
lenges to pro-American governments elsewhere,
particularly in El Salvador. As a result, there is little
expectation in the region that Kissinger's commis
sion will change or even slow down U.S. diplomatic
and military actions directed against Nicaragua and
El Salvador's leftist rebels.
"What can Kissinger do?" President Ricardo de la
Espriella of Panama asked in an interview on the eve
of the commission's arrival here. "The Nicaraguans
have to do it."
At the same time, Kissinger's reputation as a
master of diplomacy and power wielding has
aroused broad expectations that something good for
Central America might come out of the report he has
promised to deliver to the White House by Jan. 10.
Marines wounded in Beirut
Beirut, Lebanon — The sporadic gunfire that has
been exchanged by Lebanon's army and the nation's
rival militia factions since a cease-fire was agreed
upon two weeks ago has inflicted slight wounds on
two U.S. Marines, an official spokesman said yester
day, and sniper fire struck an American helicopter.
Maj. Robert Jordan, a spokesman for the corps,
said that neither wounded Marine was seriously
hurt. The first casualty occurred late Saturday when
a stray bullet struck an off-duty Marine on the heel
of a foot. The second was injured yesterday morning
when a sniper's bullet grazed his shoulder while he
was standing duty at the Marine position at the
Lebanese University.
A short while after the second Marine was hurt,
gunfire ripped through the fuselage of a Marine
helicopter sitting on a landing pad near the Univer
sity.
"There seems to be a small group trying to
provoke the Marines into firing (back)," Jordan said
of yesterday morning's incidents. He added that he
was certain that the Marines were the intended tar
gets in yesterday's sniping.
"We're about the only people in the area," he
said. "So obviously the fire was directed at the
Marines."
Jordan said that the Marines of Alpha Company,
who are stationed at the university, were ordered to
remain in their foxholes and not return the fire. He
said the episode of shooting lasted about two hours.
"They just hunkered down out there," he said.
The latest injuries brought to 41 the number of
Marines wounded in Lebanon since July. Four U.S.
soldiers have been killed since late August.
Meantime, three questions continued to be up
permost in the minds of most Lebanese: Will the
cease-fire of Sept. 26-shaky as it is-continue to hold?
When will the country's official and factional leaders
begin the reconciliation talks that are the key reason
for the cease-fire? Will Syria launch attacks on guer
rillas loyal to Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat in the northern port city of
Tripoli?

Gas prices continue to decline
Los Angeles — A few lucky West Coast drivers are
paying less than a dollar a gallon for regular gasoline
as prices continue a two-month decline nationwide,
an oil industry analyst said yesterday.
It is the first time pump prices have dropped
below a dollar since the federal gas tax rose 5 cents a
gallon in April, said Dan Lundberg, who publishes
the Los Angeles-based Lundberg Letter.
Nationally, gas averaged $1.23.8 per gal lon — down
0.54 cents since Sept. 23, said Lundberg, who sur
veys 17,500 filling stations in all 50 states every two
weeks.
In the past month, the average price for all grades
fell by 1.35 cents per gallon nationwide and by more
than 4 cents in the competitive West Coast market.
Wholesale prices dropped even faster in the past
two weeks, falling by 0.97 cents per gallon. That sig
nals still lower pump prices in the near future, as
dealers sell off their older, more expensive gas,
Lundberg said.
Somali rebels claim wells poisoned
Nairobi, Kenya — Anti-government guerrillas of the
Democratic Somali Salvation Front claimed Sunday
that Somali government troops had poisoned civil
ian water wells in the Ugaden Desert, killing at least
10 persons and thousands of cattle.
The rebels made the claim in a broadcast moni
tored here of Radio Halgan, the Ethiopia-based radio
of the Somali rebels.
The radio said that at least two wells in the central
Calgaduud region occupied by the guerrillas for
more than a year had been poisoned.
"The (Somali President Siad) Barre regime has
started poisoning or blocking wells including the
popular oasis at Adaado in Galgaduud region. It was
there that 10 people died because of the poison and
hundreds of others were taken seriously ill.
Thousands of livestock and camels have perished
because of the poisoning," the radio said, quoting
Col. Abdullahi Vusuf Yey, head of the executive
committee of the rebel forces.
Yey said that the well poisonings took place in
what the rebels say were areas liberated from the
government in an attempt to drive the rebels out of
Somalia by depriving them of vital water.
He also condemned the American military build
up in Somalia that resulted after last year's invasion
of Somalia by Ethiopian and rebel forces. He termed
U.S. military bases in the Horn of Africa country "a
dangerous development" in the region, the radio
said.
The rebels occupy some sections of Central
Somalia along the border with Ethiopia and have
declared these areas "Liberated Somalia."
