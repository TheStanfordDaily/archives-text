Watt resigns
Washington â€” Interior secretary
James Watt submitted his
resignation to President Reagan
yesterday, climaxing 18 days of
mounting criticism over his com
ments about a coal advisory
panel and more than 2 1/2 years
of controversy over his steward
ship of the nation's natural re
sources.
To the end, Reagan stood
loyally by Watt, even as the inte
rior secretary's political support
evaporated on Capitol Hill and
Republicans led a chorus of

demands for his ouster.
"Jim has done an outstanding
job as a member of my cabinet
and in his stewardship of the nat
ural resources of the nation,"
Reagan said in a statement ac
cepting Watt's resignation.
Reagan said Watt will continue
to serve "until his successor is
confirmed."
Watt telephoned Reagan at
Camp David, Md., late yesterday
afternoon to offer a letter of
resignation, in which Watt said
he is leaving because his
"usefulness" to the president
"has come to an end."
