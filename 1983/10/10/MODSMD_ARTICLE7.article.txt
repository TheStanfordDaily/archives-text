University President Donald Kennedy ex
pressed "grave concern" that the drop in
federal support for university education will
cause a "significant and long-term reduction in
our innovative capacity as a nation," in a speech
in Boston yesterday.
In the printed text of remarks prepared for
the installation of fellow biologist Evelyn Hand
ler as president of Brandeis University, Kennedy
cited major threats to university research pro
grams and to the cultivation of "human intellec
tual capital," especially in the area of minority
student enrollment.
Kennedy noted that federal funding for the
construction of research facilities died in 1968
and that a 1980 proposal to boost the National
Science Foundation budget for that purpose

was tabled by the present administration.
As a result, "there is a dramatically growing
disparity between the quality of the research
tools available in universities and those
availalbe in commercial laboratories."
Kennedy attributed the recent rise of interest
in education to a "neo-Sputnik concern" about
japanese applicaton of high technology.
The other major consequence of diminished
federal support — a hike in the cost of university
education — encourages students to select pro
fessional careers over graduate academic pro
grams and represents "a serious threat to this
country's store of intellectual capital," Kennedy
said.
Kennedy discounted charges of "rampant
careerism" among undergraduates as being
"somewhat exaggerated," but added that "a

discouraging economy, like the threat of execu
tion, tends to focus the mind."
Consequently, many students enter the pro
fessions to pay off their education debts and to
avoid the financial insecurity they experienced
as students.
Minority students, "with disproportionately
high financial need, see the government's ac
tion as yet another piece of evidence that their
plight is now taken less seriously by society,"
Kennedy said.
In a supportive note for liberal education over
vocational training, the University president
said "the data show only the weakest relation
ship between undergraduate concentration and
ultimate career." Universities must "strengthen
