President Reagan's second arms
control plan in two weeks, aimed at
breaking the deadlock between
American and Soviet negotiators at
the Geneva weapons reduction
talks, was accompanied by a
renewed pledge by the president to
"remind the world" about "what is
right and what is wrong."
At the heart of the plan is the
"build-down" concept, which calls
for the destruction of more than one
old nuclear warhead for each new
warhead deployed.
While a "two-for-one" exchange
is often used to illustrate the idea,
"build-down" is complicated by dif
ferences in warhead capabilities,
such as varying yields and accuracy
and-depending on whether the war
head is carried by bombt/; or ballis
tic missiles — different flight times to
targets.
The joint Chiefs of Staff criticized
the "two-for-one" ratio, stressing
the need to retain some of the old
warheads scheduled to be
destroyed by 1989-90, when all of
the new 10-warhead MX missiles are
to be operational. The Joint Chiefs
hope to prolong the lifespan of
some older weapons systems by 10
years beyond the introduction of
the MX, and also want to "build
down" different warheads at differ
ent rates.

A Soviet nuclear freeze proposal,
introduced at the U.N. General As
sembly by Soviet Ambassador Oleg
Troyanovsky, was coupled with anti-
American rhetoric and a declaration
"to take countermeasures to
preserve the balance of forces"
worldwide unless the Reagan ad
ministration cancels its planned
December deployment of Pershing
II and cruise missiles in Europe.
Troyanovsky said the Soviet
freeze plan would stop the buildup
of all nuclear components, includ
ing both delivery vehicles and weap
ons. He added that it would prohibit
the deployment of new nuclear

arms and prevent testing of various
weapons technologies, including
fissionable materials.
Such a freeze, Troyanovsky said,
would take place only "under effec
tive verification." He did not elabo
rate on the verification procedure.
While only indirectly referring to
Reagan's recent arms control offers,
Troyanovsky asserted that an Ameri
can move to install new nuclear
missiles in Europe would become
yet "another twist in the spiral of the
arms race."

Syria may receive Soviet SS-21
surface-to-surface missiles, accor
ding to U.S. intelligence sources
These missiles, which have never
been deployed outside of the War
saw Pact region in Europe, can be
equipped with high explosives or
nuclear warheads, which experts say
may pose a threat to Israel.
Speaking on the condition that
they not be identified, the sources
also noted that the Soviet Union
replaced all of Syria's losses in
planes, tanks and other military

equipment following Syria's bat
tlefield setbacks by Israeli forces in
the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon last
year.
The Soviets augmented this
"replacement" by deploying SAM-5
surface-to-air missiles in Syria, the
sources said, adding that Soviet mili
tary crews were sent to operate the
SAM-5 system.

Lech Walesa was awarded the 1983
Nobel Peace Prize for his role in the
since-banned Solidarity labor move
ment. Walesa and dissident Soviet
physicist Andrei Sakharov are the
only peace winners from the Soviet
Bloc.
The award, which surprised and
angered the Polish government but
delighted supporters of the Eastern
Bloc's first independent trade uni
ons, was announced in Oslo, Nor
way by the Norwegian Nobel com
mittee, which praised the Pole for
his "contribution, made with consi
derable personal sacrifice, to ensure
workers' rights to establish their
own organizations."
' In reaction to the Nobel an
nouncement, one Polish official
said, "It would have been easier to
understand last year. His activities
since are not very typical for anyone
to be nominated for a peace prize."
General Wojciech Jaruzelski's
regime faces its first full meeting of
the ruling Communist Party Central
Committee since the lifting of mar
tial law in July. Polish informants say
hard-line critics of Jaruzelski's
policies might use the Nobel award
as ammunition against the regime.

'Lord of the Flies' author William
Golding was selected for the 1983
Nobel Prize in literature.
The Swedish Nobel committee
cited Golding's novels for their
clarity, diversity and "universality of
myth" that "illuminates the human

condition in the world today."
In a rare public dissent, commit
tee member Artur Lundkvist
denounced the choice of Golding
and argued that the prize should
have gone to avant-garde French
phil osopher and novelist Claude
Simon.
The 72-year-old Golding became
the seventh British author to win the
literary prize since it was established
in 1901. The prize is today worth
$191,815.

Five weeks after a Soviet fighter
downed a South Korean airliner,
United States intelligence officials
say they have reviewed all available
evidence and have found no indica
tion that Soviet air defense person
nel knew it was a commercial plane
before the attack.

The sources say most American
intelligence specialists are confident
that the SU-15 fighter that fired rock
ets at Korean Airlines flight 007 was
below and behind the plane, rather
than parallel to it, as high-level offi
cials in Washington first believed.
Most experts have generally con
cluded that the Soviet pilot did not
know what kind of aircraft he was
attacking, the sources say, adding
that the Soviet Air Defense Force
had displayed a poor capacity to in
tercept the 747 in Soviet airspace.

Sino-Soviet arms control talks
resumed in Peking, beginning the
third round of formal discussions in
the past year aimed at normalizing
relations between the two nations.
In a speech to the U.N. General
Assembly last week, Chinese
Foreign Minister Wu Xuequain as

sailed arms buildups by the United
States and the Soviet Union. Wu
proposed an international confer
ence on disarmament for all states
possessing nuclear arms, but onlv
after the superpowers reduce their
nuclear arsenals and delivery sys
tems by half.

A Reagan re-election bid has been
given "aquiescence and accep
tance" by the president, according
to a senior White House official. The
informant says that Reagan ap
proved a plan by White House Chief
of Staff james Baker to initiate a
committee Oct. 17 to raise campaign
funds and map a 1984 re-election
strategy.

The operator of the Three Mile Is
land nuclear plant will face indict
ments within the next few weeks,
according to the Justice Depart
ment, which has been conducting a
three-year investigation at the plant
site in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
The inquiry centers on charges
that shortly before the accident, in
which radioactive gases and water
escaped from a crippled reactor, the
company's management falsified
data concerning a leaky valve to
avoid having to shut down part of
the plant for repairs.

President Reagan cancelled visits to
the Philippines, Indonesia and
Thailand, citing pressing congres
sional business. Various sources,
however, claim that the Manila leg
of the trip was dropped because
Reagan's advisors believe that a visit
with Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos would be too controversial
in the wake of the assassination of
opposition leader Benigno Aquino
Aug. 21.
