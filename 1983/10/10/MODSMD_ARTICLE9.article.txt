## More than 70 students will work overseas Peace Corps picks scores of Stanford students 
### DAVID SANCHEZ Senior staff writer 
Recruiting for the Peace Corps continues to
be very successful here, according to Lon Ran
dall, the organization's associate director for in
ternational operations.
Randall said that approximately 70 Stanford
students made it through the Peace Corps'
rigorous screening process 'zst year, and were
nominated to become Peace Corps volunteers
overseas. In general, only one out of seven ap
plicants receive nominations, but Stanford's
success rate was far better, Randall said.
Randall was on campus Friday with Peace
Corps recruiters during the Career Fair in White
Plaza. He said he did not know why so many
students here choose to become volunteers.
Peace Corps recruiter Rick Mead said that he
was pleased with the turnout and that he had
received many requests for applications at the
Career Fair.
Randall said that the volunteers who join the
Peace Corps today are different from those who
joined in the 19605.
"People who come in the Peace Corps still are
human service motivated," Randall said. They
have that sense of idealism that comes with
people who want to help others improve their
lot in life, and improve the human condition.
"But we are finding also that it's not the blind
idealism, or the very broad, linear idealism that
existed in the 60s, where people wanted to go
somewhere to do something for someone in
some place," he continued. "They (recent vol
unteers) come at it with a much more specific

idea in mind, and also with what we call a career
idealism.
"They want this kind of experience to be that
base for something that they are going to do
later on."
Randall said that a lot of corporations and
businesses with international programs value
Peace Corps volunteers because, besides
having the academic and technical training they
are looking for, the volunteers have "pre
qualified" themselves as good employees be
cause they have had an international experi
ence.
Successful Peace Corps volunteers have
shown that they can adapt to foreign cultures,
Randall said.
Randall also noted that many Peace Corps vol
unteers have gone on to serve the government.
Many are now in the State Department, he said,
and some have become U.S. ambassadors, con
gressmen and senators.
More than 500 former Peace Corps volunteers
are now serving in the Agency for International
Development, according to Randall, and many
have joined programs such as Save the Children
and the Catholic Relief Services.
The Peace Corps is a very cost-effective way to
generate worldwide good will and friendship,
said Randall. The Corps spends only $20,000 per
year to recruit, train, deliver, transport and sup
port a volunteer, while other government
agencies spend upwards of $125,000.
Randall said that President Reagan has been
very supportive of the Peace Corps because the
Peace Corps' philosophy is similar to Reagan's.
"We are not a grant-making agency," Randall

said. "We don't give any money to anyone. We
just give technical skills and perform volunteer
services."
The Peace Corps leaves a skill in place, Ran
dall said, "so that people can improve them
selves, and consequently the whole level of the
economy and social development of that
country increases."
Candidates for the Peace Corps must meet
three qualifications to be considered: be at least
18 years of age, a U.S. citizen and in good
health. If a person meets these requirements,
possesses the skills that are needed or re
quested by a host country and is considered
likely to be a good representative of the U.S.
government overseas, then he or she is recom
mended to the Peace Corps' Washington place
ment office, which tries to match the volunteer
with the request of a host country.
After being matched with a country, the
volunteer must participate in a cross-cultural
training program which lasts 12 weeks. The
volunteer is expected to serve in the Peace
Corps for two years.
Randall said that the Peace Corps currently
serves about 62 countries with about 5200 vol
unteers.
The Peace Corps, which was founded in 1961
by President John F. Kennedy, has three ob
jectives, according to Randall: to promote
world peace and friendship; to provide techni
cal skills to developing nations and assist them
in learning about the United States; and to help
Americans learn more about the culture of de
veloping nations.

and some have become U.S. ambassadors, con
gressmen and senators.
More than 500 former Peace Corps volunteers
are now serving in the Agency for International
Development, according to Randall, and many
have joined programs such as Save the Children
and the Catholic Relief Services.
The Peace Corps is a very cost-effective way to
generate worldwide good will and friendship,
said Randall. The Corps spends only $20,000 per
year to recruit, train, deliver, transport and sup
port a volunteer, while other government
agencies spend upwards of $125,000.
Randall said that President Reagan has been
very supportive of the Peace Corps because the
Peace Corps' philosophy is similar to Reagan's.
"We are not a grant-making agency," Randall

said. "We don't give any money to anyone. We
just give technical skills and perform volunteer
services."
The Peace Corps leaves a skill in place, Ran
dall said, "so that people can improve them
selves, and consequently the whole level of the
economy and social development of that
country increases."
Candidates for the Peace Corps must meet
three qualifications to be considered: be at least
18 years of age, a U.S. citizen and in good
health. If a person meets these requirements,
possesses the skills that are needed or re
quested by a host country and is considered
likely to be a good representative of the U.S.
government overseas, then he or she is recom
mended to the Peace Corps' Washington place
ment office, which tries to match the volunteer
with the request of a host country.
After being matched with a country, the
volunteer must participate in a cross-cultural
training program which lasts 12 weeks. The
volunteer is expected to serve in the Peace
Corps for two years.
Randall said that the Peace Corps currently
serves about 62 countries with about 5200 vol
unteers.
The Peace Corps, which was founded in 1961
by President John F. Kennedy, has three ob
jectives, according to Randall: to promote
world peace and friendship; to provide techni
cal skills to developing nations and assist them
in learning about the United States; and to help
Americans learn more about the culture of de
veloping nations.
