# Opinions
## The 						Stanford Daily Rape awareness week 
### 
If the entire female population is like the 930
women surveyed in a recent random sample,
44 percent of them have been raped sometime
in their lives.
Whether one decides to believe that shock
ingly high statistic — reported by Mills College
Prof. Diana Russell during last week's "Facing
Rape" series — is a matter of opinion. What
shouldn't be left to judgment, however, is that
rape is an unusual and prevalent crime.
The definition of "rape" is itself troubling.
Russell considers it forced intercourse or inter
course with someone on drugs or otherwise
incapable of giving consent to the act. The le
gal description is equally unspecitic, similarly
open to random judgment.
On the law books, there are two types ot
rape — statutory and forcible; the rules and cir
cumstances required to officially identify both
are odd and in many cases arbitrary. Convict
ing a rapist is not easy. Consent may be a
defense in many crimes, but as Law Prof. John
Kaplan points out, it is a serious and hard
fought issue in rape cases. The character and
even clothing of the victim are mentioned
more frequently and vigorously in these trials
than in any others.
Most states give what is termed a "cautionary
instruction" to the jury in rape cases. Rape is
easy to charge but difficult to prove, the in

struction says, so testimony should be given
more than the usual careful consideration.
These legalities exist to protect the innocent -
a basic tenet of our legal system. But statistics,
cited by Russell on the basis of her study and
generally agreed upon by experts, indicate that
too many rapes are occuring without sufficient
retribution for the criminal.
In Russell's study, only 9.5 percent of all
rapes had been reported to the police. Kaplan
concurs that most victims do not pick up the
phone or march into a police station after an
attack, but he astutely notes that measuring the
low reporting rate accurately is not possible.
The law professor goes on to say that of the
rape reports that do get filed, many of them are
pushed aside or fall flat somewhere in the legal
system because someone along the line
suspects they are false.
Another distressing statistic is that most
rapes occur between people who know each
other — in Russell's study only 11 percent of the
rapes were committed by strangers. That fact
may explain the low reporting rate and
suspicions of falsehood.
But whatever the reasons behind the strange
nature of rape as a crime, people in the Stan
ford community must realize that the apparent
absence of this crime on campus in the last
year and a half is probably nothing more than a
sad illusion created by painful silence.
