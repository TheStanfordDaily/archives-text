# Helms' latest disturbance
## 
### 
What do the Polish government and Sen.
Jesse Helms have in common? Last week they
both denounced their country's most inspira
tional Nobel Peace Prizewinners.
While the martial law regime continued to
suppress Lech Walesa, the hero of the Polish
worker, Helms was opposing a holiday for Mar
tin Luther King Jr., a hero who symbolizes
freedom for most Americans, with unfortunate
exceptions such as Helms. We deplore the
senator's attacks against Dr. King, and encour
age President Reagan to publicly support the
holiday and express his opinion of Helms' dis
turbing rhetoric.
Helms' filibuster opposing the King holiday
was based on economic concerns and two out
landish charges against the civil rights leader.
While claiming the federal holiday would cost
the country $4 to $12 billion in lost produc
tivity, Helms also asserted that King was a
Marxist-Leninist and criticized him for "the cal
culated use of nonviolence as a provocative
act." We are horrified that Helms invoked the
spirit of McCarthyism to attack a national hero,
whose desire to work within the system and to
strengthen democracy made clear he was no
Communist. We also are alarmed by Helms'
aversion to non-violent protest, with the impli
cation that millions of oppressed Americans

should have silently accepted their longstand
ing mistreatment.
Unfortunately, we are not surprised by
Helms' opposition to honoring Martin Luther
King Jr. Helms has consistently refused to
publicly disavow his blatantly racist radio
messages of the 1950s and 19605, an apology
which even Sen. Strom Thurmond and other
old Dixiecrats have made. Helms has no blacks
on his staff despite representing North
Carolina, a state with a 25 percent black
population. And when asked how his criticisms
of King would affect his re-election bid next
year, Helms replied, "I'm not going to get any
black votes, period." As Rep. Robert Garcia (D-
N.Y.) aptly described: "Jesse Helms has been
out of step with America for many years."
Helms joined in supporting a unanimous
Senate resolution praising Lech Walesa last
week, and we find it ironic that the senator
applauds the struggle for freedom abroad
while denouncing a hero of freedom at home.
Helms' attacks are a stain on this country, but
we are hopeful that a remembrance of King will
lead more and more Americans to embrace the
ideals which the civil rights leader so eloquent
ly voiced. "It's not necessarily malicious," said
King's 25-year-old son about Mr. Helms' at
tacks. "He just doesn't understand Martin Lut
her King."
