# Why the Democrats will lose in '84
## 
### 
Some of the more humorous
memories of a wide-eyed freshman
year come to mind with the ap
proach of the presidential election.
Back in November of 1980, when
Ronald Reagan won, we were as
saulted with vigils, protests, etc., all
bewailing the demise of Our Great
Republic. One of the cutest forms of
protest called for the heartbroken,
non-closet Reaganite to place a
noose over his head, and to walk
around the campus like a moron. It
was funny. Cod, they looked stupid.
And the black cloud hovers again,
as Reagan and the U.S. look brighter
and brighter. Not perfect, no. But
the two are looking better when it
counts the most.
While the Demos shuffle and
scuffle like madmen, Reagan only
has to act cool (Flight 007). Barring
economic catastrophe, which is
unlikely, the Reagan Papers (who
will be lucky enough to procure
them?) will grow to the tune of four
more years.
But everyone knows that, and the
SPA types are getting their nooses
ready once again. Maybe, in '84,
they'll go all the way with their sym
bolism, when hopelessness reigns.
How much worse can it get under
Reagan's iron rule. Alas, he has
pillaged our everything.
Predictions are premature, of
course. Who knows how the elec
tions will turn out (McG.overn?). But
one must ask, why do the Demos
look so boring.
They look boring because they of
fer absolutely nothing new to the
American voter. Nobody voted for
Carter in '80 because they liked his
policies. They voted for Carter be
cause they disliked Reagan. The
same will go for this next election,
especially since Reagan-hatred has
remained so chic among political
non-watchers.
Which means of course that the
Democrats must get exciting, or at
least likable. They haven't let last
election's defeat really get them

down, and that's tragic, from a Dem
ocratic viewpoint. It's going to take
a defeat in '84 to get them to com
pletely regroup, to blow off all their
old, tired and lukewarm alliances
and to start a New Campaign, a New
Beginning.
The New Campaign has to be one
which is unfettered by selfish,
screaming, bone-headed, l-want-a
piece-of-the-pie clones. The Demos
appear to be catering just a little too
much, promising too much, and in a
two-party system, that can be dan
gerous. No matter how you slice the
system, the U.S. is a conservatively
moderate country with many and
varied special interests. If the
Demos want a piece of the action,
they are going to have to embrace
the whole territory, and not just
scattered (although powerful) seg
ments, like labor, education and
blacks.
That's not to say that these various
forces are in conflict with each
other. But the problem with the
Democrats is focus. They are court
ing many, but they have failed to
show us just what their vision for
America is. They have many plans,
but no real goals.
Focus was the key to the Republi
can victory in '80. That focus may
have been too simple (and too ex
treme) for some, but at least people
could grasp and understand it.
Then, as now, we know that the
Democrats would like to make ev
reyone happy, but we still have to
wonder how they are going to
achieve the goal. And the old ways
will always be old.
But what about now. What do the
Democrats offer?
Walter Mondale is so busy kissing
up to liberal/labor groups that it is
impossible to figure out what he
would do if he were elected. His
policies hearken back to earlier
days, days whose policies were
supposed to help certain disad
vantaged groups. Well, those
groups are still disadvantaged, but

Monaaie appears willing to keep on
with the tried and untrue.
John Glenn would be an all right
president.
That's about it for the Democrats.
Whatever the outcome, though,
things won't change all that much.
As stated earlier, the U.S. is a
pluralistic monopsyche. A Reagan is
a Glenn is a Bush (but probably not a
Jerry Brown), as far as the bulk of
the American public goes. And no
matter who wins the election, ws'll
go on living as we have, keeping an
eye on the Reds, feeling guilty about
not buying American and always
reaching for that great and elusive
American Dream. From Sea to
shining Sea. And all that stuff.
