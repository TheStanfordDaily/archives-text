## Rent control needed 
### 
Those of you who have recently
gone through the frustrating task of
finding an affordable, off-campus
apartment are undoubtedly aware
that this area is in the midst of a se
vere housing crisis. For most Stan
ford students, however, high rents
are merely a temporary inconveni
ence. For most tenants in East Palo
Alto, the sacrifices imposed by the
housing crisis are sharper and more
enduring.
That is why the East Palo Alto
Council of Tenants has asked the
newly formed City of East Palo Alto
to enact a rent stabilization and just
cause eviction ordinance. This gras
sroots drive for more affordable and
secure rental housing provides a
perfect case for examining the
merits of rent control.
The impact of the housing crisis
on East Palo Alto tenants has been
particularly severe. In 1980, the
median family income in East Palo
Alto was $16,128 compared with
$26,400 for all of San Mateo County.
Since the average renter earns only
55 percent that of the average
homeowner, it is not surprising to
find that 75 percent of the renters in
East Palo Alto have low or very low
incomes according to County
criteria.
Yet rents in East Palo Alto are com
parable to those in more affluent
surrounding areas. Per unit rent is
somewhat lower in East Palo Alto
than in surrounding cities but this is
entirely accounted for by the fact
that units are smaller. If rent is cal
culated on a per room basis, 1980
census figures show that renters in
East Palo Alto paid $88.30 per room
while the County average was
$79.80. As a community plagued by
poverty and unemployment, the
economic burden of high rents is
felt much more strongly in East Palo
Alto than in surrounding com
munities.
The rent control law under con
sideration in East Palo Alto would
return the rate of rent inflation to
that which would likely obtain in a
more normal market situation.
Landlords would be allowed to pass
through legitimate cost increases
except, in certain cases, expenses
resulting from refinancing or sale of
the property. Landlords would still
be able to make a reasonable profit,
but not a windfall. Tenants would
gain much needed relief, specula
tion would largely subside, and
rents on comparable units would
tend to equalize.
How would new construction and
maintenance of existing buildings
be affected? The law is carefully de
signed to mitigate negative effects.
New construction would be exempt
and the City would gain the power
to preserve the existing housing
stock through restrictions on the

conversion or demolition of struc
turally sound units. Increased main
tenance costs could be passed on to
tenants.
No rent increase would be
allowed on any substandard
housing unit until it is brought up to
health code standards (at least 700
units are currently considered sub
standard). Low cost rehabilitation
financing is available and bonus rent
increases would be allowed in cases
where truly major improvements oc
curred. This mix of positive and
negative incentives should prompt
landlords to provide habitable
housing.
There is one major problem with
rent control. Rather than focus on
low income tenants, most laws
spread benefits thinly among
tenants at all income levels. Provi
sions of the law under consideration
in East Palo Alto provide some in
novative solutions to this problem.

Landlords would still be
able to make a
reasonable profit
(while) tenants would
gain much needed
relief.

First, landlords would be allowed
to exempt two units from rent con
trol for every unit rented to very low
income tenants at rents they can af
ford. There is good reason to
believe that landlords could make
more money under this arrange
ment than under conventional rent
control. Yet the benefits of control
would be shifted more heavily
toward those who need relief the
most.
Second, tenant's security deposits
would be placed in a City fund de
signed to provide seed money for
the financing of permanently affor
dable cooperative housing. Collec
tion and distribution of deposits
would be handled much as before
but instead of earning interest for
the landlord, this money would be
put to use in promoting low cost,
tenant-owned housing.
The ordinance also includes other
crucial tenant safeguards. Presently,
landlords can evict tenants without
even stating a reason. More than
12,000 evictions, many arbitrary in
nature, took place in California last
year. The proposed law would allow
evictions only where the landlord
can prove just cause such as
destruction of property or non
payment of rent.

even stating a reason. More than
12,000 evictions, many arbitrary in
nature, took place in California last
year. The proposed law would allow
evictions only where the landlord
can prove just cause such as
destruction of property or non
payment of rent.

Those of you who have recently
gone through the frustrating task of
finding an affordable, off-campus
apartment are undoubtedly aware
that this area is in the midst of a se
vere housing crisis. For most Stan
ford students, however, high rents
are merely a temporary inconveni
ence. For most tenants in East Palo
Alto, the sacrifices imposed by the
housing crisis are sharper and more
enduring.
That is why the East Palo Alto
Council of Tenants has asked the
newly formed City of East Palo Alto
to enact a rent stabilization and just
cause eviction ordinance. This gras
sroots drive for more affordable and
secure rental housing provides a
perfect case for examining the
merits of rent control.
The impact of the housing crisis
on East Palo Alto tenants has been
particularly severe. In 1980, the
median family income in East Palo
Alto was $16,128 compared with
$26,400 for all of San Mateo County.
Since the average renter earns only
55 percent that of the average
homeowner, it is not surprising to
find that 75 percent of the renters in
East Palo Alto have low or very low
incomes according to County
criteria.
Yet rents in East Palo Alto are com
parable to those in more affluent
surrounding areas. Per unit rent is
somewhat lower in East Palo Alto
than in surrounding cities but this is
entirely accounted for by the fact
that units are smaller. If rent is cal
culated on a per room basis, 1980
census figures show that renters in
East Palo Alto paid $88.30 per room
while the County average was
$79.80. As a community plagued by
poverty and unemployment, the
economic burden of high rents is
felt much more strongly in East Palo
Alto than in surrounding com
munities.
The rent control law under con
sideration in East Palo Alto would
return the rate of rent inflation to
that which would likely obtain in a
more normal market situation.
Landlords would be allowed to pass
through legitimate cost increases
except, in certain cases, expenses
resulting from refinancing or sale of
the property. Landlords would still
be able to make a reasonable profit,
but not a windfall. Tenants would
gain much needed relief, specula
tion would largely subside, and
rents on comparable units would
tend to equalize.
How would new construction and
maintenance of existing buildings
be affected? The law is carefully de
signed to mitigate negative effects.
New construction would be exempt
and the City would gain the power
to preserve the existing housing
stock through restrictions on the

conversion or demolition of struc
turally sound units. Increased main
tenance costs could be passed on to
tenants.
No rent increase would be
allowed on any substandard
housing unit until it is brought up to
health code standards (at least 700
units are currently considered sub
standard). Low cost rehabilitation
financing is available and bonus rent
increases would be allowed in cases
where truly major improvements oc
curred. This mix of positive and
negative incentives should prompt
landlords to provide habitable
housing.
There is one major problem with
rent control. Rather than focus on
low income tenants, most laws
spread benefits thinly among
tenants at all income levels. Provi
sions of the law under consideration
in East Palo Alto provide some in
novative solutions to this problem.

Landlords would still be
able to make a
reasonable profit
(while) tenants would
gain much needed
relief.

First, landlords would be allowed
to exempt two units from rent con
trol for every unit rented to very low
income tenants at rents they can af
ford. There is good reason to
believe that landlords could make
more money under this arrange
ment than under conventional rent
control. Yet the benefits of control
would be shifted more heavily
toward those who need relief the
most.
Second, tenant's security deposits
would be placed in a City fund de
signed to provide seed money for
the financing of permanently affor
dable cooperative housing. Collec
tion and distribution of deposits
would be handled much as before
but instead of earning interest for
the landlord, this money would be
put to use in promoting low cost,
tenant-owned housing.
The ordinance also includes other
crucial tenant safeguards. Presently,
landlords can evict tenants without
even stating a reason. More than
12,000 evictions, many arbitrary in
nature, took place in California last
year. The proposed law would allow
evictions only where the landlord
can prove just cause such as
destruction of property or non
payment of rent.
