Take peace seriously
Leon Dayan's Viewpoint entitled
"A Society of Veggies and peace
pipes" (Daily, Oct. 7) is a real
disappointment. Dayan writes good
humour; his story is funny in itself,
but in a broader context his
ridicule of the peace movement is
a disgrace.
It's good to poke fun at serious
issues that weigh on us, like war in
this case, but Dayan's jokes are
more of an attempt to encourage
us to completely ignore the issue's
importance. His approach isn't at
all original; he's just reinforcing
the rhetoric we hear these days
(it's strong in the recent movie The
Final Option) that the proponents
of peace deserve at best to be
scoffed at; at worst they should be
feared and hated more than the
threat of war itself.
Peace as a first priority is the
dominant characteristic of the
group Dayan describes, and since
his commentary on the members'
lifestyles and personalities is
derogatory, we're supposed to
associate a desire for peace with all
these negative qualities. He covers
most of the bases: peace lovers
support guerrilla warfare and other
forms of violence (he has one
wearing a "Nuke Reagan" T-shirt),
they're hopelessly ignorant about
information related to their cause
(one of his characters confuses
Lenin with John Lennon), and it's a
given that they take drugs.
Then the lighter stereotypes to
belittle the cause. Peace lovers are
"naturally vegetarians" (a practice,
he implies, that alters their minds),
they attach great political sig
nificance to posters, buttons, and
personal protests like growing a
beard, and they're childishly naive
(he portrays this little group as
being convinced that its activism
alone is affecting international
relations).
Because they follow the same
lifestyle as a group they lose their
non-conformist status, somehow
invalidating their cause; but why
does peace have to be a far-out
idea? Can't even the straightest
people benefit from it? Since their
ideals are from the 19605, don't
they count anymore?
Is there any peace cause we can
admire, or is peace itself il
legitimate? Is there something
about it that threatens the lifestyle
desired by Dayan and the others
that ride on the same bus? You can
laugh at vegetarianism and liberal
lifestyles if you think they're funny,
but come on and tell us straight
(you know the song) just "what is
so funny about peace, love, and
understanding?"
