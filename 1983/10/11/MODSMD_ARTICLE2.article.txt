# Trustee discusses proposed Reagan library with students
## 
### SHELLY WENTKER Staff Writer 
The Board of Trustees has not reached a consensus
as to whether the proposed Reagan library, museum
and policy center should be located here, according to
Trustee James Gaither, who met informally with mem
bers of Delta Upsilon fraternity last night.
"A library is one thing, a museum is another, and a
policy center is still another," Gaither said, adding that
the Board has not decided if these issues will be dealt
with separately or all together.
Gaither, who is currently the chairman of the Board's
Finance and Administration Committee and a partner in
a San Francisco law firm, was one of several Board
members who spoke last night in student residences.
The Board met yesterday and today, but is not expected
to address the Reagan Library issue during the
meetings.
Gaither also said the committee chaired by Board
president William Kimball was not organized as a
response to the request for an inquiry into the Hoover
Institution. It was something University President
Donald Kennedy and Kimball "felt should be done . . .
the decision was consistent with an experiment that
had been tried before with the Hospital," he said.
Gaither explained that at one time an ad-hoc commit
tee was set up to serve as a liaison between the Board

and the Hospital and "worked well" so Kennedy and
Kimball "decided to use the same system."
Other questions raised referred to the University's
investment policy. Calling this a "very difficult" area in
which to make decisions, Caither said the main issue is
deciding what investments to make and how to shift
assets from one category to another. He added that the
purposes of the investment policy are "to protect the
substantial endowment we have" and "to generate a
reasonable return."
Gaither said the important issue ot academics is
maintaining the quality of education. Emphasizing "the
need to remain strong and balanced as an academic
institution," he added that though the sciences draw a
lot of national attention, there is still "a lot of focus in
the Humanities and Sciences departments about
making sure the social remain strong."
Responding to an inquiry regarding the University's
"blind admission" policy, Gaither said Stanford will
continue to adhere to this policy. "It's a question of
priorities," he said.
According to Gaither, "There's enormous support
among the Board" for retaining this policy. In reference
to those institutions which have abandoned "blind ad
missions" policies for financial reasons, Gaither said
that he "thinks they're giving up on something that's
too important to give up."
