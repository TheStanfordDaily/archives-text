## NFL coach quits 
### 
HOUSTON (AP) — Embattled
Houston Oilers Coach Ed
Biles, his team in a 13-game
losing streak including six
losses this season, resigned
yesterday, saying he was tired
of being used as a punching
bag.
There was no immediate an
nouncement from the Oilers'
management on a successor,
but there was speculation that
either defensive coordinator
Chuck Studley or offensive
coordinator Kay Dalton would
be named interim coach.
Oilers General Manager
Ladd Herzeg met with the
coaching staff yesterday while
players went through a brief
workout.
Biles, looking relaxed and
smiling, strode into his regular
Monday post-game news con

ference as he had done
throughout the season.
"Gentlemen, I have just
resigned as head coach of the
Houston Oilers," he said
calmly. "I started thinking
about this a week ago and I've
talked it over with my wife and
I talked to Ladd last night.
"He told me to sleep on it
but I have not changed my
mind."
Biles, 8-23 in his two-plus
season as the Oilers' head
coach, never was able to
escape the shadow of Bum
Phillips, whom he replaced in
January 1980. Nor could he
make a success of his plan to
rebuild the Oilers by stockpil
ing draft choices.
"I don't feel that I failed; I
just ran out of time," Biles
said.
