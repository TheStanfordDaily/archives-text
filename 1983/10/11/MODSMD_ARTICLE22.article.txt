# Card puts 8-game win streak on line
## Spikers to battle Bears in opener 
### TOM MOORE 
With eight straight road
wins to its credit, including an
impressive come-from-behind
victory over San Diego State
Saturday, the Stanford wo
men's volleyball team returns
to Maples Pavilion tonight tor
its home opener against cross-
Bay rival UC-Berkeley at 7:30
p.m.
"Cal usually has very strong
serving and blocking," said
Cardinal assistant coach Don
Shaw, "and they always play
us really tough."
The defending NorPac
champion, Cal has been strug
gling a bit this year. With an
11-11 overall mark, the Bears
have steadily overcome a poor
start. "They've had a slow
start, but their team seems
now to be coming on strong,"
Shaw said.
While Stanford upset San
Diego State (11-15, 7-15, 15-5,
15-12, 15-0) Saturday and
downed Long Beach State (3-
15, 15-3, 15-1, 15-11) a day ear
lier, Cal had a pair of impres
sive road wins of its own this
weekend.
The Bears upset UC-Santa
Barbara on the Gauchos'
home floor in three games and
also defeated Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo over the weekend.
Perched at the top the
WCAA Conference, the Car
dinal is undefeated in league
play. Executing a quick, agile
version of the 6-2 volleyball of
fense in which two setters and
three eligible hitters are
utilized at all times, the wo
men spikers have been ex
tremely successful this
season.
"Since we're a smaller team
compared to the others
around the league, we try to
control the ball more and out
smart our opponents," Shaw

explained.
The spikers will take the
floor tonight with senior Kari
Rush at one setter spot and
junior Diedra Dvorak at the
other. As the captain of the
team, Rush sets the tone of
the action on the court.
"She (Rush) does things that
a lot of people don't notice,"
Shaw said, "but nonetheless is
extremely important to our
success."
Dvorak serves as the other
quarterback on the floor.
"They (Rush and Dvorak) work
well together. They know
what has to be done and how
to run the offense effectively,"
Shaw noted.
First team Ail-American Kim
Oden anchors the middle
blocker spot. Oden led the
WCAA in kills, hitting
percentage and blocks last
year. "She (did that even
though our opponents, in es
sense, double covered her,"
Shaw said. "She's definitely
one of the top players in the
country."
junior Lisa Murphy, who
redshirted her freshman year
and thus has two more years
of eligibility remaining after
this season, consistently turns
in a good performance at the
Cardinal's other middle block
er position, according to
Shaw.
Senior Julie Baker, who
played brilliantly in the clutch
against San Diego State Satur
day, and freshman Barbara
Fontana round out the starting
line-up at the outside hitter
positions.
The Stanford six will rely on
a game plan of execution as
they take on a taller Cal squad.
The teams split their two
games last season.
