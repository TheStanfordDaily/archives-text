# KZSU Picks
## 
### 
The KZSU PICKS are a new addition to The
Stanford Daily Entertainment section. The
records that appear here each week are
those that the music staff at k/St' reels have

exceptional merit. Tracks off these albums
are highlighted during /OO Preview airing
Tuesdays from 5-8 p.m. and on Dance for
Your Dinner Thursdays from 5-8 p.m.
