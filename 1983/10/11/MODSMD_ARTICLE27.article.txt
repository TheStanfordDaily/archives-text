# Paul Young— No Parlez
## 
### 
In the United Kingdom,
the single Wherever I Lay
mv Hat (That s m\ Home)"
was number one on the
British charts tor five
weeks. The album has also
hit the number one slot. So
who i> Paul Young? He's a
gu\ with a great \oice who
writes \er\ tew ot his own
songs, but is able to do
wonders with with others'
music. He's sort of like a
new-wave Frank Sinatra.

The debut album consists
of a wide variety ot
pop/love songs. But, this
being the 1980s, acoustic
instruments have been
largely replaced by syn
thesizers for the "new
wave" ballad effect. Look
for "Come Back and Stav,"
"Iron Out the Rough
Spots," and "Sex" to
receive heavy airplay on all
radio formats.
