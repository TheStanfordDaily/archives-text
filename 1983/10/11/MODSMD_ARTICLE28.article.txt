# X-More Fun in the New World

### 
X has done something
very few bands can do.
After developing their stvle
deliberately on their
second and third albums
(Wild Gift and Under the
Big Black Sun), they have
revived the vitality and
statement of their music.
These were the very ele
ments that made Los An
geles the most acclaimed
debut album of 1980 and
will more than likely make
this latest release their big
gest success yet. The most

energetic cuts on the al
bum, De\il Doll" and"I
See Red are reminiscent
of their early material. "I
Must Not Think Bad
Thoughts" restates the
group's anti-commercial
radio rhetoric which has
remained dormant since
their song "The Unheard
Music" from the first al
bum. Yet \ has not gone
back in time. Songs like
"True Love Pt. 2" combine
all the textures and rhvthms
that the group has

developed over the past
three years. X has definitely
taken a step forward on this
release.—Johnathan Pregler
