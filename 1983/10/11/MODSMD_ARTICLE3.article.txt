# Grad student attacks quad plans
## 
### STEVE TROUSDALE Senior Staff Writer 
A doctoral candidate in art history
has called the proposed design of
the Inner Quad "cause for serious
concern" because it is not true to
the intentions of the University's
designer, noted landscape architect
Frederick Olmsted.
Max Mazenko, project manager of
the Quad renovation, responded by
saying "We still feel the plan we
have is conceptually accurate to the
Olmsted plan."
In a letter to Mazenko dated Oct.
5, the student, Gerard Koskovich,
criticized two parts of the proposal
for the renovation:
• the biaxial pathways in the Quad,
which, he claimed, were not part of
the original Olmsted proposal; and
• the proposed seat-walls around
the planting circles and the enlarge
ment of these circles themselves.
"The height, size and coping of the
planting circles as they now appear
is beyond doubt that desired by
both Olmsted and (Leland) Stan
ford.'' The coping of a wall is its top
layer.
However, Mazenko — who has not
yet received the letter — noted that
"part of the issue is that we have no
idea of how Olmsted would plan"

the Quad "down to detail." Several
aspects of the current Quad were
not planned by the designer be
cause he never really completed his
design for the Inner Quad. For in
stance, Olmsted "had a strong ob
jection to asphalt," said Mazenko,
but there is crushed asphalt in the
Quad.
To uphold the "historical in
tegrity" of the Quad, Koskovich sug
gested in his letter that the entire
area, excluding the planting circles,
be surfaced like the two pathways,
and that the plans for the seat-walls
and extension of the planting circles
be abandoned. The implementation
of these plans, he wrote, would
transform "a fundamentally formal,
rather austere late 19th century
space into something akin to a
modern shopping mall."
In his letter, Koskovich also
criticized the proposed use of grass
in the planting circles, calling it "an
absolute violation of the fundamen
tal principles Olmsted developed
for his work at Stanford." Crass was
planted in other areas of the
campus, he noted, but in the areas
of the Quad he said that Olmsted
was able to convince Stanford that
grass would be inappropriate.
In an earlier article Mazenko

defended the use of grass because
Olmsted's concern that it could not
be properly irrigated had been
eliminated by modern technology.
Koskovich claims in his letter that
Olmsted shunned grass for both
"economic and aesthetic reasons."
Mazenko defended the current
plans for the project because, he
said, the "plan has to reflect the his
tory of the site itself and the con
temporary plans of the University."
Besides, he contended, "there's
some things (in the Olmsted plan)
that are not as good as they could
be," and because of this a historical
ly accurate plan would not be the
best use of the Quad.
Koskovich claimed that a histori
cal reconstruction of the Quad
would be superior to the proposed
renovation, saying that "doing ab
solutely nothing to the Quad would
be better than what the Facilities
Project Management office is
proposing."
Mazenko said that Koskovich
would have an opportunity to pres
ent his views to the design commit
tee on the project, but he added
that there were strong opinions on
the renovation and the committee
did not expect to "make everyone
happy." The project is to be
discussed by the Administra
tive Council Nov. 16 and the
Board of Trustees Dec. 12.
Both Mazenko and Kos

kovich do agree that an ar
cheologist or historian should
be at the work site and inspect
it for any archeological items
of interest. In fact, Mazenko
suggested that Koskovich him
self could perform this task
because of his research into
the history of the design of the
Quad.
