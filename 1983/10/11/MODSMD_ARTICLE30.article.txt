## Connery as Bond: better than new 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
After all the steel trap ad
venture movies we've been
squeezed through in the past
years, watching Irvin
Kershner's Never Say Never
Again, starring Sean Connery
as lames Bond, is like taking a
marvelous vacation. This
leisurely, laid-back spy whirl
may seem perverse to those
who go to it seeking the thrills
available in the best parts of
The Spy Who Loved Me and
this summer's Octopussy, but
why should kershner waste
his time trying to beat skillful
hacks like Lewis Gilbert and
John Glen at their own game?
Kershner, whose last film was
The Empire Strikes Back
(possibly the fastest paced and

most sensuous adventure ever
made) chose a sly, relaxed
style tor Sean Connery's
return engagement as 007.
The set-up ot the movie
demands it. In Lorenzo
Semple's script, "M" (Edward
Fox, in a parody of all the con
stipated generals he's played)
decides that Bond's taste tor
rich food and drink has worn
him down, and so he sends
him to a health clinic to ex
ercise and lose weight. When
you see how great Connery
looks in this picture, you
realize what a fine joke this is,
and how appropriate for Con
nery's first Bond picture in a
dozen years.
This acknowledgement of
the passing of time introduces

a human dimension into the
movie, and it precludes the
necessity for the kind of
streamlined, ostentatious
stunts that characterize the
Salzman-Broccoli Bonds. Gun
nery's Bond proves himself fit
as a fiddle in Never Say Never
Again, but it's a mature man's
fitness.
kershner works in such an
unstressed manner here, com
pletely eschewing excitation
techniques, that you're not
forced to notice how beauti
fully designed and structured
each sequence is. A face-oft
between Connery and a tow
ering brute in the health spa
climaxes with a gag so funny
and apt that while we're laugh

ing at it, kershner can catch us
by surprise with a violent
flourish. An underwater scene
has a nearly abstract beauty,
and there's a ballroom se
quence, shot through a deli
cate mist (the specialty of the
cinematographer, Douglas
Slocombe), in which mirrored
f-rench windows fragment the
images of the heroine (Kim
Basinger) and the villainess
(Barbara Carrera). Visually, the
film is layered with references,
often parodistic, to laws, The
Wizard of Oz, The Lovers, Top
Hat, Eisenstein's Ten Days
That Shook the World,
kershner's own The Empire
Strikes Hack, and he even in
cludes a nod to the famous
