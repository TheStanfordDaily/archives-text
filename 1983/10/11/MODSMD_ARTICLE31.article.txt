## A 						week on the town: clubs in the area 
### 
Armed only with an ID and an open
mind, you can sample some of the Bay
area's various dance clubs. The diver
sity of nightclubs in the region should
be able to satisfy anyone's passion for
dancing. From excruciatingly trendy
modern music spots which cater to the
average KQAK listener, to offbeat funk
clubs located in the nether regions of
San Francisco, most dance enthusiasts
can find an appealing niche. Many
places have opened their doors to
anyone over 18, but determined
youngsters can usually gain access to
all but the most discriminating clubs.
•: I have compiled a weekly dance
• guide which highlights a cross section
of clubs. Most venues have peak
nights for dancing, and you might be
subjected to a disturbingly esoteric
'.performance by a local band if you
wander into a club on one of its off
nights. A good rule is is to call before
you go, and find out the cover charge
and the evening's festivities. Also keep
in mind that most of these places are
deserted by 11 p.m.
Monday: The Berkeley Square has
"recently reopened under a new
restaurant-nightclub format so that

anyone 18 or older may enter. DJ Doug
Wendt spins reggae discs on Mondays,
and live bands appear midweek.
Fridays and Saturdays feature new
wave dancing. Located on University
Avenue, this is one of the few East Bay
dance alternatives. Berkeley Square,
1333 University Avenue, Berkeley, 849-
3374.
• • •
Tuesday: San Francisco's l-Beam,
nestled on Haight Street, has a very fa
vorable fun:cost ratio. The hired guns
at the door will carefully scrutinize
your identification, but upon entry you
will find good sound, lighting, and
video. A D) sits in an enclosed glass
booth overlooking the dance floor,
screening videos you never get to see
on MTV. As befits the Haight-
Ashbury's cultural heritage, this place
attracts a very friendly crowd. Punks,
gays, and even preppies can feel com
fortable here. I-Beam, 1748 Haight
Street at Cole, San Francisco, 668-6006.
• • •
Wednesday: Just blocks away from
the sexual gauntlet of Broadway Street,
Earl's offers an intimate setting and a
low cover charge. The DJs here play

new wave and occasionally throw in a
reggae or funk number. Unaccom
panied females should beware ot the
young executives who come here to
shop for coeds. This place serves as a
pleasant waystation between the Em
barcadero Center bars and the
numerous Broadway clubs. Earl's, 370
Pacific at Battery, San Francisco, 981-
3402.
• • •
Thursday: The 181 Club is located in
the Tenderloin, San Francisco's
seediest district. It is wise to park in
the lot directly across from the club
unless you usually carry some foim of
chemical repellent. This club has a
great bar and a nice musical mix of
funk and new wave. There is plenty of
room to dance on the stage, and the
atmosphere is conducive to hanging
out and watching some of the more
exotic dancers. 181 Club, 181 Iddy
Street, San Francisco, 771-2393.
• • •
Friday: Echo Beach is essentially a
new wave warehouse, with capacity
crowds everv weekend. An intricate
lighting system dominates the huge
dancing area. The initial impression

that you are trapped in a rerun of
American Bandstand quickly wears off,
and you gradually get used to the
prevalent homogenized trendiness.
From suburban Flashdance devotees
to urban sophisticates, this club offers
temporary shelter to all those able to
get past the doorman. Thursday night
here is "Club Soda" time, when no al
coholic beverages are served and
minors are welcome. Echo Beach's
varied visual stimuli should be able to
keep you occupied for a few hours un
less, of course, you are catatonic to
begin with. Echo Beach, Third and Har
rison, San Francisco, 543-4709.
• • •
Saturday: The Oasis is the only Bay
Area nightclub I know of that has a
swimming pool; if you are feeling ad
venturous bring your bathing suit and
take the plunge. The crowd here tends
to wear a lot of black and likes to affect
an alienated look, but that is not re
quired for entry. Music ranges from
the cold wave of The Cure to the latest
scratch tunes. The patio is a good
place to cool off after exhibiting your
talents on the dance floor. The Oasis,
Eleventh and Folsom, San Francisco,
621-8119.

Friday: Echo Beach is essentially a
new wave warehouse, with capacity
crowds everv weekend. An intricate
lighting system dominates the huge
dancing area. The initial impression

that you are trapped in a rerun of
American Bandstand quickly wears off,
and you gradually get used to the
prevalent homogenized trendiness.
From suburban Flashdance devotees
to urban sophisticates, this club offers
temporary shelter to all those able to
get past the doorman. Thursday night
here is "Club Soda" time, when no al
coholic beverages are served and
minors are welcome. Echo Beach's
varied visual stimuli should be able to
keep you occupied for a few hours un
less, of course, you are catatonic to
begin with. Echo Beach, Third and Har
rison, San Francisco, 543-4709.

Saturday: The Oasis is the only Bay
Area nightclub I know of that has a
swimming pool; if you are feeling ad
venturous bring your bathing suit and
take the plunge. The crowd here tends
to wear a lot of black and likes to affect
an alienated look, but that is not re
quired for entry. Music ranges from
the cold wave of The Cure to the latest
scratch tunes. The patio is a good
place to cool off after exhibiting your
talents on the dance floor. The Oasis,
Eleventh and Folsom, San Francisco,
621-8119.
Armed only with an ID and an open
mind, you can sample some of the Bay
area's various dance clubs. The diver
sity of nightclubs in the region should
be able to satisfy anyone's passion for
dancing. From excruciatingly trendy
modern music spots which cater to the
average KQAK listener, to offbeat funk
clubs located in the nether regions of
San Francisco, most dance enthusiasts
can find an appealing niche. Many
places have opened their doors to
anyone over 18, but determined
youngsters can usually gain access to
all but the most discriminating clubs.
•: I have compiled a weekly dance
• guide which highlights a cross section
of clubs. Most venues have peak
nights for dancing, and you might be
subjected to a disturbingly esoteric
'.performance by a local band if you
wander into a club on one of its off
nights. A good rule is is to call before
you go, and find out the cover charge
and the evening's festivities. Also keep
in mind that most of these places are
deserted by 11 p.m.
Monday: The Berkeley Square has
"recently reopened under a new
restaurant-nightclub format so that

anyone 18 or older may enter. DJ Doug
Wendt spins reggae discs on Mondays,
and live bands appear midweek.
Fridays and Saturdays feature new
wave dancing. Located on University
Avenue, this is one of the few East Bay
dance alternatives. Berkeley Square,
1333 University Avenue, Berkeley, 849-
3374.

Tuesday: San Francisco's l-Beam,
nestled on Haight Street, has a very fa
vorable fun:cost ratio. The hired guns
at the door will carefully scrutinize
your identification, but upon entry you
will find good sound, lighting, and
video. A D) sits in an enclosed glass
booth overlooking the dance floor,
screening videos you never get to see
on MTV. As befits the Haight-
Ashbury's cultural heritage, this place
attracts a very friendly crowd. Punks,
gays, and even preppies can feel com
fortable here. I-Beam, 1748 Haight
Street at Cole, San Francisco, 668-6006.

Wednesday: Just blocks away from
the sexual gauntlet of Broadway Street,
Earl's offers an intimate setting and a
low cover charge. The DJs here play

new wave and occasionally throw in a
reggae or funk number. Unaccom
panied females should beware ot the
young executives who come here to
shop for coeds. This place serves as a
pleasant waystation between the Em
barcadero Center bars and the
numerous Broadway clubs. Earl's, 370
Pacific at Battery, San Francisco, 981-
3402.

Thursday: The 181 Club is located in
the Tenderloin, San Francisco's
seediest district. It is wise to park in
the lot directly across from the club
unless you usually carry some foim of
chemical repellent. This club has a
great bar and a nice musical mix of
funk and new wave. There is plenty of
room to dance on the stage, and the
atmosphere is conducive to hanging
out and watching some of the more
exotic dancers. 181 Club, 181 Iddy
Street, San Francisco, 771-2393.
