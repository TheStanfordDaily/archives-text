# The 						verdict in on Joel: guilty as charged
## 
### PETER QUINN 
Paranoid? Vou decide! After
releasing an innovative, unin
hibited and somewhat daring
quasi-concept album, The
Nylon Curtain, Billy joel must
have decided he and his band
needed a rest. Although The
Nylon Curtain was by no
means a commercial failure,
critics panned it as a rip-off of
the Beatles, with Joel even
trying to make his voice sound
like a combination of Lennon
and McCartney. Of course the
critics were totally wrong.
The Nylon Curtain was a
great departure from all of
Joel's previous work, it was an
album on which he allowed
his players, in particular drum
mer Liberty DeVitto, a great
deal of freedom to explore dif
ferent sounds and styles. This
attitude paid off in a beefy al

bum rich in interesting
melodies and thick with har
monic layering. Even the lyrics
on T.N.C. were good beyond
any argument, although many
of the songs were the result of
Joel's break-up with his wife
Elizabeth (of "She's Got a
Way," "She's Always a Wo
men," and "She's Right On
Time"). On the whole T.N.C.
was inspired, well produced
and commerciallv palatable.
What more could one want?
Most artists seem to be
satisfied with acquiring wealth
and recognition, like journey,
or they only care about the
money, like Joe Walsh; but it
seems that Joel needs to take
the extra step: to have impact
and change music. That
T.N.C. had similarities to
some Beatles work is tes
timony to this desire. The

Beatles themselves had such
desires, but the critical differ
ence was the time that the fab
four played in., They were
from the start unchallenged.
They began the Anglicization
of rhythm and blues, and were
the standard against which all
other rock was measured.
Thus when they moved to
more advanced forms they
changed the standard.
With his latest album, An In
nocent Man, Joel seems to be
exhibiting all of the signs of
musical paranoia, backlashing
against the pitfalls of The
Nylon Curtain. The title song
"Innocent Man" almost seems
to speak to the critics of
T.N.C. who accused Sgt. Joel
of being a Pepper saying,
"Some people run from a pos
sible fight/ Some people figure
they can never win/ Although

this is a fight I can lose/ The
accused is an innocent man."
The meaning here seems clear
enough. If you can't start your
own trend, then join one that
is already acceptable and work
within it.
Although the new album
isn't bad, it is a musical step
backward for Billy Joel. He is
trying to play it safe and stay in
the mainstream. The result is
that the performances of his
players are as lack-luster as
their pictures on the back cov

er and the album lacks the
drive of most of his previous
releases. Note-worthy songs
on the album are "Christie
Lee" with brillant sax work by
either David Sanborn or Mark
Rivera (Richie Canada's
replacement), "Uptown Girl"
a Four Season's special, "Easy
Money" from the Dangerfield
movie of the same name,
"This Night"taken from Lud
wig V. Beethoven, "An Inno
cent Man" the title track, and
the hit single "Tell Her About
it" which has a great video.
