Comes a time
The following meeting will
be MANDATORY at The Daily
offices Thursday at noon: a
staff lunch, featuring those
paragons (not paramours) of
student government, the
members of the Council of
Presidents. The chief asks that
all attend so they may fire
questions at the COP mem
bers. The meeting will be on
the record, open and properly
journalistic.
