Lebanese talks planned
Beirut — President Amin Gemayel, after two weeks
of delays, issued invitations yesterday for national
reconciliation talks aimed at bringing together
Lebanon's warring factions.
News of the invitations came from a senior Ameri
can official, who also said a preliminary meeting to
set the agenda for the conference was expected to
be held tomorrow.
The official, who asked that his name not be used,
said that the first major round of talks among the
leaders of Lebanon's factions could take place as
early as the middle of next week. Meanwhile, state
run Beirut radio said in a broadcast that the first
session of the conference would take place Oct. 19

at Lebanon's presidential palace in suburban
Baabda.
The site of the talks has been a major problem in
convening such a conference. At first, the Lebanese
government suggested a neutral country, preferably
Saudi Arabia. But Syria, which is playing a major role
in the negotiations, opposed such a site. The Syrians
also initially opposed Baabda but apparently agreed
to a compromise after negotiations with American
and Saudi Arabian emissaries.
U.S. special envoy Robert McFarlane, who was a
major negotiator in arranging the current cease-fire
in the fighting in the Lebanese mountains and then
in helping to set up reconciliation talks, said yester
day that the "events of the last 48 hours have
hrnuohf lis tn a nn<;itinn whprp thp>rp'c ovor*/ nmm.
ise that the national reconciliation process is about
to begin.
"What we need is tor all the leaders who will take
part in this process to enter this dialogue with the
same sense of commitment and compromise aimed
at achieving a Lebanese solution for all Lebanese.
There are a lot ot nay-sayers — some sav it can't hap
pen. Many point to the history of bitterness, the
history of violence and the history ot struggle and
disunity in this country. That history is accurate."
"But, as President Reagan said not long ago,
there's a time to stop reading about history and try
to make a little. That's what we intend to do here."
Watt may leave legacy
Washington — james Watt's resignation as secretary
of the interior may not mean an end to the contro
versial policies he followed as chief steward of the
nation's public lands and natural resources, his poli
tical and environmental foes said yesterday in the
wake of Watt's decision to step down.
In language often as tart-tongued and combative
as that Watt frequently used to berate them, his op
ponents said that Watt was simply pursuing goals set
by his boss, President Reagan, and that any succes
sor was likely to get similar marching orders.
"Right to the end, the president defended this
right-wing extremist, who almost gleefully has ex
hibited disregard for millions of our people as well
as our national heritage," said Democratic National
Chairman Charles Manatt. "James Watt has been
speaking for Ronald Reagan. The president has been
letting Watt be Reagan, wielding the hatchet against
political enemies as well as our forests."

Liz Railbeck, legislative analyst for the San
Francisco-based environmental group Friends of the
Earth, put it this way: "We are delighted to see Watt
go, but we teel Ronald Reagan has the responsibilitx
tor three years of environmental wreckage. You
don't change Ronald Reagan by getting rid ot James
Watt. The mouth is gone, but the policies are apt to
be the same."
Indeed, some critics of Watt's tenure as secretarv
of interior argued that a less combative and out
spoken person in the job might make the opposi
tion's task harder.
"By constantly shooting himself in the foot, he has
made it easy for environmentalists," said Michael
Herz, director of the California-based Oceanic Soci
ety. "A quieter person who pursued the same objec
tives would be more difficult to defeat."
Despite the tidal wave of criticism, Watt's
supporters defended his performance as secretar\
ot the interior and bemoaned his being forced to
resign because of verbal gaffes.
Watt, who has described environmentalists as "a
left-wing cult'' and divided the LJnited States into
"liberals and Americans," was once given a plaster
model of a foot with a hole in it by the president for
making a controversial remark about the Beach Boys
smging group. But, as he conceded to reporters
Sunday in announcing his resignation, it was his
description a few weeks ago of a Department of the
Interior advisory panel as a "black ... a woman, two
Jews and a cripple" that hastened his decision to
depart the government.
Aquino panel resigns
Manila, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos
suffered another political setback yesterday when all
five panelists investigating the murder of opposition
leader Benigno Aquino resigned because their im
partiality had been questioned.

"It appears that the image of the commission for
impartial its and capacity of its members to do justice
to everv man are being questioned," tour ot the five
resigning commissioners said in a letter to Marcos.
Opposition leaders and Aquino's family have
charged the panel was biased and under Marcos'
control.
The presidential palace said in a news release that
Marcos "remains receptive to suggestions in order
to allow a full, impartial and unrestricted inquiry . .
and to punish whoever might be guiltv."
Aquino was gunned down at the Manila airport
Aug. 21 as he returned from voluntary exile in the
United States. The government says the assassina
tion was a communist plot carried out bv a gunman
who was shot and killed at the scene by guards. The
opposition claims it can produce witnesses who saw
government soldiers kill Aquino and Rolando Gal
man, the man the government savs shot Aquino.
Aquino's death sparked big demonstrations by
opponents calling tor Marcos' resignation. Two
protests ended in riots killing 12 people.
The commission's collapse was the latest in a se
ries of blows to Marcos. President Reagan has can
celed a November visit to Manila, and a day later a
21.4 percent currency devaluation was ordered.
American wins Nobel Prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Barbara McClintock, the 81-
year-old American botanist whose research an
ticipated the revolution in genetics by more than 20
years, won the Nobel Prize in medicine yesterday.
The faculty of Sweden's Karolinska Institute said it
awarded McClintock the prize mainly for her 1951
discovery of moveable genes in Indian corn — a dis
covery that was largely ignored for two decades.
Only in the 19705, after genes were found to move
in bacteria, did other scientists begin to look at her
work more seriously.
McClintock, who still works at the Cold Springs

Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y., is the first
woman to receive the prize in medicine for work she
did alone.
Two other women have won Nobel science
awards on their own: France's Marie Curie in 1911
and Britain's Dorothy Crowfoot-Hodgkin in 1964,
both for chemistry. Two women have shared the
prize in medicine with men: Rosalyn Valow in 1977
and Theresa Cori in 1947, both Americans.
McClintock said she was overwhelmed by the
award, which includes $190,000 in prize money.
Stock prices close high
New York — Stock prices came on strong near the
close yesterday to post record highs for the third
straight session as investors continued to register
confidence in the economic recovery and the bull
market on Wall Street.
Trading volume was relatively light, with many
banks and other investing institutions closed for Co
lumbus Day.
The Dow )ones average of 30 industrials, down
more than 7 points in early trading, finished with a
gain of 12.50 at 1284.65. The average thus eclipsed
the new highs it set last Thursday and Friday.
For the first time since early summer, other,
broader market measures joined the Dow at new
highs. For instance, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index rose .91 to 99.63, passing the peak
of 99.01 it reached on June 22.
Today's weather
Sunny with highs in the 60s to mid 70s. Tonight
and tomorrow: Fair except for patchy late night and
early morning fog. Lows from the mid 40s to the mid
50s. Highs from the mid 60s to the upper 70s.

Lebanese talks planned
Beirut — President Amin Gemayel, after two weeks
of delays, issued invitations yesterday for national
reconciliation talks aimed at bringing together
Lebanon's warring factions.
News of the invitations came from a senior Ameri
can official, who also said a preliminary meeting to
set the agenda for the conference was expected to
be held tomorrow.
The official, who asked that his name not be used,
said that the first major round of talks among the
leaders of Lebanon's factions could take place as
early as the middle of next week. Meanwhile, state
run Beirut radio said in a broadcast that the first
session of the conference would take place Oct. 19

at Lebanon's presidential palace in suburban
Baabda.
The site of the talks has been a major problem in
convening such a conference. At first, the Lebanese
government suggested a neutral country, preferably
Saudi Arabia. But Syria, which is playing a major role
in the negotiations, opposed such a site. The Syrians
also initially opposed Baabda but apparently agreed
to a compromise after negotiations with American
and Saudi Arabian emissaries.
U.S. special envoy Robert McFarlane, who was a
major negotiator in arranging the current cease-fire
in the fighting in the Lebanese mountains and then
in helping to set up reconciliation talks, said yester
day that the "events of the last 48 hours have
hrnuohf lis tn a nn<;itinn whprp thp>rp'c ovor*/ nmm.
ise that the national reconciliation process is about
to begin.
"What we need is tor all the leaders who will take
part in this process to enter this dialogue with the
same sense of commitment and compromise aimed
at achieving a Lebanese solution for all Lebanese.
There are a lot ot nay-sayers — some sav it can't hap
pen. Many point to the history of bitterness, the
history of violence and the history ot struggle and
disunity in this country. That history is accurate."
"But, as President Reagan said not long ago,
there's a time to stop reading about history and try
to make a little. That's what we intend to do here."
Watt may leave legacy
Washington — james Watt's resignation as secretary
of the interior may not mean an end to the contro
versial policies he followed as chief steward of the
nation's public lands and natural resources, his poli
tical and environmental foes said yesterday in the
wake of Watt's decision to step down.
In language often as tart-tongued and combative
as that Watt frequently used to berate them, his op
ponents said that Watt was simply pursuing goals set
by his boss, President Reagan, and that any succes
sor was likely to get similar marching orders.
"Right to the end, the president defended this
right-wing extremist, who almost gleefully has ex
hibited disregard for millions of our people as well
as our national heritage," said Democratic National
Chairman Charles Manatt. "James Watt has been
speaking for Ronald Reagan. The president has been
letting Watt be Reagan, wielding the hatchet against
political enemies as well as our forests."

Liz Railbeck, legislative analyst for the San
Francisco-based environmental group Friends of the
Earth, put it this way: "We are delighted to see Watt
go, but we teel Ronald Reagan has the responsibilitx
tor three years of environmental wreckage. You
don't change Ronald Reagan by getting rid ot James
Watt. The mouth is gone, but the policies are apt to
be the same."
Indeed, some critics of Watt's tenure as secretarv
of interior argued that a less combative and out
spoken person in the job might make the opposi
tion's task harder.
"By constantly shooting himself in the foot, he has
made it easy for environmentalists," said Michael
Herz, director of the California-based Oceanic Soci
ety. "A quieter person who pursued the same objec
tives would be more difficult to defeat."
Despite the tidal wave of criticism, Watt's
supporters defended his performance as secretar\
ot the interior and bemoaned his being forced to
resign because of verbal gaffes.
Watt, who has described environmentalists as "a
left-wing cult'' and divided the LJnited States into
"liberals and Americans," was once given a plaster
model of a foot with a hole in it by the president for
making a controversial remark about the Beach Boys
smging group. But, as he conceded to reporters
Sunday in announcing his resignation, it was his
description a few weeks ago of a Department of the
Interior advisory panel as a "black ... a woman, two
Jews and a cripple" that hastened his decision to
depart the government.
Aquino panel resigns
Manila, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos
suffered another political setback yesterday when all
five panelists investigating the murder of opposition
leader Benigno Aquino resigned because their im
partiality had been questioned.

"It appears that the image of the commission for
impartial its and capacity of its members to do justice
to everv man are being questioned," tour ot the five
resigning commissioners said in a letter to Marcos.
Opposition leaders and Aquino's family have
charged the panel was biased and under Marcos'
control.
The presidential palace said in a news release that
Marcos "remains receptive to suggestions in order
to allow a full, impartial and unrestricted inquiry . .
and to punish whoever might be guiltv."
Aquino was gunned down at the Manila airport
Aug. 21 as he returned from voluntary exile in the
United States. The government says the assassina
tion was a communist plot carried out bv a gunman
who was shot and killed at the scene by guards. The
opposition claims it can produce witnesses who saw
government soldiers kill Aquino and Rolando Gal
man, the man the government savs shot Aquino.
Aquino's death sparked big demonstrations by
opponents calling tor Marcos' resignation. Two
protests ended in riots killing 12 people.
The commission's collapse was the latest in a se
ries of blows to Marcos. President Reagan has can
celed a November visit to Manila, and a day later a
21.4 percent currency devaluation was ordered.
American wins Nobel Prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Barbara McClintock, the 81-
year-old American botanist whose research an
ticipated the revolution in genetics by more than 20
years, won the Nobel Prize in medicine yesterday.
The faculty of Sweden's Karolinska Institute said it
awarded McClintock the prize mainly for her 1951
discovery of moveable genes in Indian corn — a dis
covery that was largely ignored for two decades.
Only in the 19705, after genes were found to move
in bacteria, did other scientists begin to look at her
work more seriously.
McClintock, who still works at the Cold Springs

Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y., is the first
woman to receive the prize in medicine for work she
did alone.
Two other women have won Nobel science
awards on their own: France's Marie Curie in 1911
and Britain's Dorothy Crowfoot-Hodgkin in 1964,
both for chemistry. Two women have shared the
prize in medicine with men: Rosalyn Valow in 1977
and Theresa Cori in 1947, both Americans.
McClintock said she was overwhelmed by the
award, which includes $190,000 in prize money.

awarded McClintock the prize mainly for her 1951
discovery of moveable genes in Indian corn — a dis
covery that was largely ignored for two decades.
Only in the 19705, after genes were found to move
in bacteria, did other scientists begin to look at her
work more seriously.
McClintock, who still works at the Cold Springs

Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y., is the first
woman to receive the prize in medicine for work she
did alone.
Two other women have won Nobel science
awards on their own: France's Marie Curie in 1911
and Britain's Dorothy Crowfoot-Hodgkin in 1964,
both for chemistry. Two women have shared the
prize in medicine with men: Rosalyn Valow in 1977
and Theresa Cori in 1947, both Americans.
McClintock said she was overwhelmed by the
award, which includes $190,000 in prize money.
Stock prices close high
New York — Stock prices came on strong near the

straight session as investors continued to register
confidence in the economic recovery and the bull
market on Wall Street.
Trading volume was relatively light, with many
banks and other investing institutions closed for Co
lumbus Day.

the new highs it set last Thursday and Friday.
For the first time since early summer, other,
broader market measures joined the Dow at new
highs. For instance, the New York Stock Exchange
composite index rose .91 to 99.63, passing the peak
of 99.01 it reached on June 22.
