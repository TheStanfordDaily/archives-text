Lebanese talks planned
Beirut â€” President Amin Gemayel, after two weeks
of delays, issued invitations yesterday for national
reconciliation talks aimed at bringing together
Lebanon's warring factions.
News of the invitations came from a senior Ameri
can official, who also said a preliminary meeting to
set the agenda for the conference was expected to
be held tomorrow.
The official, who asked that his name not be used,
said that the first major round of talks among the
leaders of Lebanon's factions could take place as
early as the middle of next week. Meanwhile, state
run Beirut radio said in a broadcast that the first
session of the conference would take place Oct. 19

at Lebanon's presidential palace in suburban
Baabda.
The site of the talks has been a major problem in
convening such a conference. At first, the Lebanese
government suggested a neutral country, preferably
Saudi Arabia. But Syria, which is playing a major role
in the negotiations, opposed such a site. The Syrians
also initially opposed Baabda but apparently agreed
to a compromise after negotiations with American
and Saudi Arabian emissaries.
U.S. special envoy Robert McFarlane, who was a
major negotiator in arranging the current cease-fire
in the fighting in the Lebanese mountains and then
in helping to set up reconciliation talks, said yester
day that the "events of the last 48 hours have
