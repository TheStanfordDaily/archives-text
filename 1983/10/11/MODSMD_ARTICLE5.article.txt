### CLAY CALVERT Staff Writer 
Despite efforts to generate inter
est in the ASSU Graduate Senate
election Oct. 18 and 19, no students
in the Schools of Education or
Medicine filed statements of can
didacy, according to elections com
missioner Brian Mariscal.
The two senate seats open to edu
cation students and one seat
available for medical students will
remain vacant this year. "It's a recur
ring problem," Mariscal said, noting
that six empty seats remained after
last spring's annual ASSU election.
The lackadaisical turnout came
despite the ASSU's efforts to
generate more interest in the elec
tions this fall by running ads in the
local press and distributing flyers
around the campus.
"Graduate student races are more
or less if you volunteer to serve,
you're elected," said |im McGrath,
chair of the graduate education and
research committee.
Commenting on the apathy
among graduate students toward
the ASSU, Council of Presidents

member Peter Spivack said that
graduate students "are here for
more serious academic studies and
frequently don't have the time to
dabble in other activities."
Mariscal was pleased, however,
by the "enthusiasm and interest"
shown by the seven students from
the School of Engineering who filed
declarations of intent for the
remaining three vacancies on the
senate. He predicted a wide-open
race between write-in candidates for
the Schools of Education and
Medicine.
"A write-in candidate definitely
has a chance to win with some cam
paigning," he said.
The ASSU senate consists of 40
members, half of whom are elected
by undergraduate students and half
of whom are elected by separate
graduate schools.
Voting will take place at the Med
Center, the ERL/physics tank and
Cubberley from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.,
and at the Terman engineering
building from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on
Oct. 18 and 19.
