# Department head questions physician's pregnancy leave
## 
### JENNIFER ROSEN Staff Writer 
A memo written by the director
of the Obstetrics and Gynecology
Department here has spawned
controversy concerning the role
of women in women's medicine.
Dr. Leroy Heinrichs, depart
ment program director, wrote
the memo requesting that Zeria
Levine, chief resident, postpone
a planned vacation for schedul
ing reasons. The effects of the in
cident, among other issues, will
be discussed at a special review
committee meeting scheduled
for Oct. 16.
Levine, who is to complete her
residency this academic year,
planned on taking a temporary
leave to have a child.
Heinrichs wrote a memo re
questing that Levine postpone
the vacation and sent it to every
faculty member of the ob/gyn de
partment.
Heinrich's memo said in part:
"The attitude of most of us on the
faculty has been that planning a
pregnancy during a training per
iod as intense and demanding as
that of a three-year ob/gyn pro
gram is presumptous and a dis
service to oneself and certainly to
one's professional colleagues.
"Pregnancy can also ultimately
affect patients who must bear the
frustrations of your colleagues
who must work with you or those
who remain in your absence.
Some faculty express the modern
view that responsible career wo
men do not risk incurring the
age-old criticism of women as un
reliable professional colleagues
and some advise me, for that rea
son, to appoint no more women
as residents in this program."
Heinrichs later apologized to
Levine and her colleagues and
disavowed the remarks in a
second memo, describing them
as "opinions (he) heard ex
pressed by the faculty."

Heinrichs could not be
reached yesterday for comment.
Medical School Dean
Dominick Purpura called the
memo "highly offensive" and
"equated it with Atilla the Hun,
or having been written before the
Age of Reason."
Purpura later retracted his
remarks, describing them as "a
poor choice of historical metap
hor" which bordered on charac
ter defamation.

A faculty-resident-staff com
mittee will meet Oct. 16 to deal
with internal difficulties created
by the memo, according to
Levine.
"Heinrich's second memo
does not wipe out the first, but
it's a step in the right direction,"
she said.
Levine says she is "hopeful"
that the committee will help
create better internal communi
cation and stressed that
responsiveness to all resident is
sues, and not just her own, will
be the committee's main objec
tives.
Similarly, Purpura said the
committee will attempt to es
tablish guidelines for
"harmonious interaction" within
the department, including gen
eral illness and vacation

procedures.
"No one ever said women
should wait until after their
residency to get pregnant. . . .if
someone is on extended leave,
no burden should be placed on
residents over and above their
normal responsibilities," he said.
Levine agreed.'The structure
of residency doesn't need to be
quite as tight. Other jobs provide
time off for maternity, why not
medicine?"
While Purpura described the
number of female residents in
the ob/gyn department as "quite
remarkable," Levine noted that
the proportion of applicants is
rising nationwide, and that Stan
ford is merely mirroring these
trends. "We are not more or less
than the national average. Noth
ing exceptional is going on here
at Stanford," she said.
Third-year resident Dr. Toni
McCain agreed. "They've hired
more women than they used to
here, but not more women than
men," she said. McCain also said
the department has a higher
percentage of women than other
departments on campus.
Unlike Purpura, who views the
committee as "positive by its very
nature," McCain expressed pes
simism over the fact that Hein
richs is currently on a three
month leave of absence from
Stanford.
"I'm very skeptical. To try to
solve problems without the key
figure is kind of pointless," she
said.
Both McCain and Levine added
that they have not personally en
countered a great deal of sexual
discrimination during their medi
cal careers. "I'm not a vehement
feminist, but I am interested in
equality and independence â€” wo
men can be as good doctors as
men," said McCain.
Levine agreed, adding that,
despite the memo incident, "I
think Stanford is a good place for
a women to be."
