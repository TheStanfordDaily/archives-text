## X-ray telescope to fly on shuttle 
### CORDON READE 
How do you see the un
seeable?
Use an X-ray telescope.
A new type of space borne
telescope, developed by the
Stanford Institute for Plasma
Physics, promises to help
astronomers study the atmo
spheres of white dwarves,
neutron stars and black holes,
stars so dense and tiny that
they defy study with conven
tional tools.
The X-ray telescope, which
has a focal length of 128.2 cen
timeters and a total geometric
collecting area of 184 square
centimeters is just completing
its test flights in preparation
for launch aboard the space
shuttle.
In its most recent test flight
aboard a Black Brant sounding
rocket launched from the
White Sands Missile Range,
New Mexico, the telescope
functioned as planned and
was successfully recovered by
parachute from its sub-orbital
flight. The device returned to
earth unscathed and has been
returned to Stanford where it

is being prepared for its final
test flight.
On its latest flight the tele
scope spent only seven
minutes in space, but future
flights aboard the shuttle will
greatly extend the time
available for observation.
On the test flight, the \-ray
telescope was used to observe
Hz 43 which is a white dwarf
star about 188 light years from
our sun. Hz 43 was inves
tigated by the Apollo-Soyuz
mission in 1975 and also in
1980 bv a Berkeley group using
a rocket based spectrometer.
However, none of the previ
ous investigations of Hz 43, or
of any other white dwarf star,
has produced the data needed
to make an accurate calcula
tion of its temperature.
Accurate calculation at
tempts are thwarted as a result
of the low abundance of
helium around white dwarves
which makes the comparison
of the star's spectra with that
of the "black body spectra"
extremely difficult. The black
body spectrum is a gauge
commonly used in astronomi
cal temperature measure

ments. A much simpler matter
is to calculate the temperature
ot a star that has an abundance
ot helium. This is possible be
cause the light emitted by
"excited'' helium atoms con
tains a unique set of absorp
tion lines to indicate how
"excited" the helium atoms
are, which thus indicates their
temperature.
Estimates of the tempera
ture of Hz 43, which is one of
the two hottest white dwarfs
known, have ranged from
55,000 to 100,000 degrees Kel
vin. This variation is not due to
inconsistencies in observa
tional data, it is the result only
ot the uncertainty in chemical
composition of the atmo
sphere of Hz 43. The X-ray tele
scope is uniquely suited to de
termining the consistency of
the atmosphere of white
dwarves, thus making a more
accurate determination of
their temperatures possible.
White dwarves have several
unique characteristics, making
their study very important to
astronomers. White dwarves
have been referred to as
"bankrupt stars" because they

have consumed their fuel,
quenching the nuclear "tire."
As a white dwarf, the star is
in its last active stage. The
density of the star has become
enormous v\ith its densitv
reaching millions of grams per
cubic centimeter. Vet the den
sitv is not as great as that of
neutron stars (also referred to
as "pulsars") or of black holes
which are believed to have in
finite density. Unlike neutron
stars or black holes, white
dwarves emit visible light,
making them more accessible
to observational research.
The \-ray telescope will not
limit its studies solely to
neutron stars. It is a highly
flexible instrument which can
easily be modified to tailor it
to the needs of specific
studies. Among other proj
ects, it will be used to study
the Sun and the interstellar
medium.
The overall goal of the pro
gram is to produce more effi
cient techniques for
astronomical spectrascopic
observations. One additional

suborbital flight has been
planned for the telescope
flight test program. The test
flights are expected to yield
much useful data.
The capabilities of the in
strument are severely
diminished by the limited ob

servation time afforded by the
suborbital flights. To increase
observation time and data ac
quisition capabilities, the tele
scope is slated to be flown on
board the space shuttle.
The program is directed by
Arthur Walker, professor of

applied physics and is funded
by a grant from the National
Aviation and Space Adminis
tration. The graduate student
involved in this project is
Joakim Linblom who will be
traveling to White Sands for
the next launch in 1984.

is to calculate the temperature
ot a star that has an abundance
ot helium. This is possible be
cause the light emitted by
"excited'' helium atoms con
tains a unique set of absorp

"excited" the helium atoms
are, which thus indicates their
temperature.
Estimates of the tempera
ture of Hz 43, which is one of
the two hottest white dwarfs
known, have ranged from
55,000 to 100,000 degrees Kel
vin. This variation is not due to
inconsistencies in observa
tional data, it is the result only
ot the uncertainty in chemical
composition of the atmo
sphere of Hz 43. The X-ray tele
scope is uniquely suited to de
termining the consistency of
the atmosphere of white
dwarves, thus making a more
accurate determination of
their temperatures possible.
White dwarves have several
unique characteristics, making
their study very important to
astronomers. White dwarves
have been referred to as
"bankrupt stars" because they

have consumed their fuel,
quenching the nuclear "tire."
As a white dwarf, the star is
in its last active stage. The
density of the star has become
enormous v\ith its densitv
reaching millions of grams per
cubic centimeter. Vet the den
sitv is not as great as that of
neutron stars (also referred to
as "pulsars") or of black holes
which are believed to have in
finite density. Unlike neutron
stars or black holes, white
dwarves emit visible light,
making them more accessible
to observational research.
The \-ray telescope will not
limit its studies solely to
neutron stars. It is a highly
flexible instrument which can
easily be modified to tailor it
to the needs of specific
studies. Among other proj
ects, it will be used to study
the Sun and the interstellar
medium.
The overall goal of the pro
gram is to produce more effi
cient techniques for
astronomical spectrascopic
observations. One additional

suborbital flight has been
planned for the telescope
flight test program. The test
flights are expected to yield
much useful data.
The capabilities of the in
strument are severely
diminished by the limited ob

servation time afforded by the
suborbital flights. To increase
observation time and data ac
quisition capabilities, the tele
scope is slated to be flown on
board the space shuttle.
The program is directed by
Arthur Walker, professor of

applied physics and is funded
by a grant from the National
Aviation and Space Adminis
tration. The graduate student
involved in this project is
Joakim Linblom who will be
traveling to White Sands for
the next launch in 1984.

How do you see the un
seeable?
Use an X-ray telescope.
A new type of space borne
telescope, developed by the
Stanford Institute for Plasma
Physics, promises to help
astronomers study the atmo
spheres of white dwarves,
neutron stars and black holes,
stars so dense and tiny that
they defy study with conven
tional tools.
The X-ray telescope, which
has a focal length of 128.2 cen
timeters and a total geometric
collecting area of 184 square
centimeters is just completing
its test flights in preparation
for launch aboard the space
shuttle.
In its most recent test flight
aboard a Black Brant sounding
rocket launched from the
White Sands Missile Range,
New Mexico, the telescope
functioned as planned and
was successfully recovered by
parachute from its sub-orbital
flight. The device returned to
earth unscathed and has been
returned to Stanford where it

is being prepared for its final
test flight.
On its latest flight the tele
scope spent only seven
minutes in space, but future
flights aboard the shuttle will
greatly extend the time
available for observation.
On the test flight, the \-ray
telescope was used to observe
Hz 43 which is a white dwarf
star about 188 light years from
our sun. Hz 43 was inves
tigated by the Apollo-Soyuz
mission in 1975 and also in
1980 bv a Berkeley group using
a rocket based spectrometer.
However, none of the previ
ous investigations of Hz 43, or
of any other white dwarf star,
has produced the data needed
to make an accurate calcula
tion of its temperature.
Accurate calculation at
tempts are thwarted as a result
of the low abundance of
helium around white dwarves
which makes the comparison
of the star's spectra with that
of the "black body spectra"
extremely difficult. The black
body spectrum is a gauge
commonly used in astronomi
cal temperature measure

ments. A much simpler matter
is to calculate the temperature
ot a star that has an abundance
ot helium. This is possible be
cause the light emitted by
"excited'' helium atoms con
tains a unique set of absorp
tion lines to indicate how

are, which thus indicates their
